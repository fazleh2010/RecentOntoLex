When he moved to New York City, he studied screenwriting with Paul Schrader and acting with William Hickey at the Herbert Berghof Studio. In 1974 he took two sabbatical years and journeyed to the Orient. He chronicled his life-changing experience in a book called Mundos sin campanarios (\"Worlds without bell towers\"). He returned to Argentina where he wrote scripts for television and worked as an assistant director in films. His opera prima, the 1988 film A Dos Aguas, won a Special Mention at the prestigious 40th Locarno International Film Festival. In 1991, Olguin-Trelawny moved to Los Angeles. There, he studied screenwriting at UCLA, directed shorts and documentaries, wrote for Telemundo/NBC and several screenplays and experimented with digital art. In April 2007 he moved back to his home town Buenos Aires to write two screenplays: La carta (\"The letter\") and Mujeres de mi familia (\"Women of my family\").
