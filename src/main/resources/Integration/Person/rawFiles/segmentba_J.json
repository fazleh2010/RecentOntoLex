  "text" : "John Cantine (October 20, 1735 – April 30, 1808) Born in Marbletown, New York, Cantine served in both houses of the New York Legislature. Cantine also served in the New York state convention concerning the ratification of the United States Constitution. In 1801, Cantine was elected to the United States House of Representatives, for the New York Seventh Congressional District, but declined to take the office. His son was Moses I. Cantine. JOHN CANTINE Johannis (John) Cantine was born in Marbletown, New York Oct. 20. In 1760, as a Lieut., John Cantine was a member of the 2nd Regiment Ulster Co. New York Provincial Troops during the French and Indian War. He signed the Articles of Association in 1775 and belonged to the Committee of Safety with his brother Matthew in 1777. In 1775 John Cantine was found on the rolls of the Third NY Regiment, Continental Line with Col. James Clinton, being listed as a Captain. This regiment, known also as the \"Ulster Regiment,\" or \"3rd Yorkers,\" was one of the four regiments raised by the Province of New York in the early summer of 1775, for the Continental service. These four New York regiments were brigaded under Brigadier General Montgomery and were with him in all his movements, ending in the assault of Quebec. At the Battle of Saratoga, at Bemis heights. John Cantine had risen to the rank of Major in Graham's Dutchess/Ulster Co. NY regt. With Glover's brigade from Massachusetts. He was made Commander of the 3rd Ulster County of Militia in 1778 by Gov. George Clinton. He provided valuable information to George Washington about the movements of Tories and Indians in the New York frontier while Washington was planning the Sullivan/Clinton Campaign. General Washington spoke of John Cantine in a letter he wrote to Gen. Philip Cortlandt, specifying a list of intelligence to seek from John: “Dear Sir: In October last, his Excellency Governor Clinton informed me, that a Colonel Cantine, who I believe lives somewhere in the neighbourhood of Rochester, was remarkably well acquainted with the Country between the North River and the Susquehanna, and of the most practicable Routes from the one to the other. If he is within your reach, be pleased to make the following enquiries: What is the nearest distance from the North River to Anaquaga and to Tioga upon the Susquehanna; Whether there are any Roads already made, and of what kinds they are, if none, Whether the Face of the Country is such, that Roads can easily be made? Whether in the nearest Route from the North River to Tioga, you do not go thro' or very near Anaquaga, or if that should be somewhat out of the way, how far? Whether the face of the Country, upon the shortest Route from the North River to the above places is the best adapted to make good Roads. Because a Route, tho' somewhat more distant, if the Roads were better, would be preferable to the nearest thro' difficult ways.” Subsequently, on May 3, 1779, at his headquarters at Middle Brook, George Washington again spoke of John Cantine in a letter he wrote to Gov. Clinton: \"Dear Sir: I am honored with your favor of the 25th of last month. The readiness with which you comply with all my requests, in prosecution of the Public service has a claim to my warmest acknowledgements. I am glad to hear of the measures the state has taken for raising a thousand men, and of your expectation that the number would be soon completed. I hope the intelligence from Col. Cantine will not materially retard the progress of a business on which the general security of the frontier so much depends.” John Cantine was a surveyor by trade and was one of the three \"Chemung Commissioners\" whose job it was to survey and lay out lands that were claimed in western New York after the Revolutionary War. A grant of land consisting of 3,200 acres was given to him in the present town of Caroline, New York for his work during the Revolution and as a Commissioner. John was a delegate to the convention for the adoption of the Constitution. He was an Anti-Federalist in his politics and voted against the ratification of the Constitution. He was a State Assemblyman from 1780 to 1798 and was a member of the first State Assembly that met in Kingston Sept 1777. He served as State Senator from 1790 to 1797 and was elected to Congress in 1801 during the administration of Thomas Jefferson. However, he was stricken with paralysis on his way to Philadelphia and was replaced by Josiah Hasbrouck. He negotiated treaties with the Cayuga and Onadaga Indians. In 1804 he was elected high Sheriff of Tioga County. John Cantine died April 30th, 1808.",
