  "text" : "Thomas Thompson (October 3, 1933 – October 29, 1982) was a journalist and author. He was born in Texas and graduated from the University of Texas in 1955. He then worked as a reporter and editor at the Houston Press. Thompson joined Life Magazine in 1961 and became an editor and staff writer. While at Life he covered the JFK assassination and was the first writer to locate Lee Harvey Oswald's home and wife. Among his stories were coverage of the making of Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band by the Beatles, in which he revealed the group's extensive drug use; an in-depth look at Frank Sinatra and his alleged Mafia ties; and the 40th and 50th birthdays of Elizabeth Taylor. His book Hearts (1971) concerned the rivalry between Houston surgeons Michael DeBakey and Denton Cooley at the dawn of the heart transplant era. Richie: The Ultimate Tragedy Between One Decent Man and the Son He Loved (1973) was the story of a Long Island man who killed his drug-addicted son. This was made into a TV-movie called The Death of Richie. Thompson's most successful book, \"LOST\" (1975), was his unapologetic telling of the true story of two men who were lost at sea after a tragic boating accident. Their brutal 'against all odds' struggle to survive was brilliantly captured in this riveting expose of human torture so unimaginable as to shock and disturb readers to their core. The story unveils the awesome truth of what the human spirit can endure in graphic but restrained detail. Thompson's \"LOST\" was retold in a made for TV movie in 1984. Blood and Money (1976) was based on a true story of scandal and the murders of Houston socialite Joan Robinson Hill and her husband John Hill, and the alleged involvement of Mrs. Hill's father, Ash Robinson, a wealthy Texas oil magnate. The book sold four million copies in fourteen languages. There were three lawsuits against Thompson after the book's publication. Ann Kurth, John Hill's second wife, sued Thompson for his description of her as a \"sex bomb\". Kurth's suit and that of a Longview, Texas police officer, were both dismissed. Ash Robinson, the father of Joan Robinson Hill, also sued Thompson for his portrayal in the book; Robinson was unsuccessful in his suit against Thompson. Robinson had been allowed to read the book prior to its publication and initially said he approved of what Thompson had written about him. His only criticism was that he believed the book was too long. Thompson's publishers withheld his royalties until all suits connected with the book were settled. Thompson also wrote Serpentine (1979), the story of convicted murderer Charles Sobhraj. Thompson wrote one novel, Celebrity (1982), which was on the national best-seller list for six months. That novel became the basis for a five-hour mini series in 1984. Thompson received the National Headliner Award for investigative reporting.

  "text" : "Thomas Bancroft (1756–1811), was a vicar of Bolton-le-Moors in Lancashire, England. Bancroft was the son of Thomas Bancroft, a thread-maker, was born in Deansgate, Manchester. At the age of six he was admitted into the Manchester Grammar School, where, in course of time, he became a teacher. He held a school exhibition from 1778 to 1781, and graduated B.A. at Brasenose College, Oxford, 10 October 1781. In 1780 he obtained the Craven scholarship; in the same year he assisted in correcting the edition of Homer published by the Clarendon Press, and further helped Dr. Falconer in correcting an edition of Strabo. Being disappointed of a fellowship at Oxford, he returned to Manchester grammar school as assistant master, and remained there until he was appointed head-master of King Henry VIII's school at Chester. ‘Towards the end of last century,’ writes Dr. Ormerod, ‘the school attained a considerable degree of classical celebrity under the direction of the late Rev. Thomas Bancroft, afterwards vicar of Bolton-le-Moors in Lancashire. Plays were occasionally performed by the boys, and a collection of Greek, Latin, and English exercises, partly written by the scholars and partly by Mr. Bancroft, was published at Chester (1788) under the title of “Prolusiones Poeticæ”’. While at this school he married Miss Bennett, of Willaston Hall, against the wishes of her father, a wine merchant in Chester. Her father prevented an attempted elopement by running his sword through Bancroft's leg, a feat for which he had to pay Bancroft 1,000l. compensation. A marriage soon afterwards took place in defiance of the father, who was never reconciled to his daughter. He bequeathed, however, 1,000l. each to her two daughters. In 1793 Bancroft was presented by Bishop Cleaver to the living of Bolton-le-Moors, then worth about 250l. a year. In 1798 Bancroft was made chaplain to the Bolton volunteers by royal warrant, and four years previously he had been appointed domestic chaplain to Viscount Castle-Stewart. He was made one of the four ‘king's preachers’ allowed to the county of Lancaster by Dr. Majendie, bishop of Chester, in 1807. He continued vicar of Bolton until his death on 5 February 1811. There is a tablet to his memory in the parish church. He published various sermons, the ‘Prolusiones’ already mentioned, and wrote three dissertations (Oxford, 1835). Two tracts, ‘The Credibility of Christianity vindicated,’ Manchester, 1831, and ‘The Englishman armed against the Infidel Spirit of the Times,’ Stockport, 1833, were privately printed for his son-in-law, J. Bradshaw Isherwood. There remain several of his manuscripts in possession of the family of Major Fell, of Bolton, who married one of Bancroft's granddaughters.",
