Very few people realize however just how generous and helpful he has been to these other collectors over the years.  He has made these contributions anonymously, and without an inflated ego.  Hopefully that anonymity will become lost at the museum in Missouri and in his upcoming book.  What's more he is the only collector alive who spent more than a year traveling around the world, from continent to continent, collecting and documenting his finds.  If history teaches any lessons at all, Bert will be remembered as the one individual in our time who preserved treasures of the past, which would have otherwise been completely lost or forgotten.  I am confident future generations will realize the value of his work even more than today" ]
