He had an interest in flying and during World War II Colonel Reiter served as a B-24 Liberator Consolidated B-24 Liberator pilot in the Army Air Forces, flying over North Africa and Italy. He was shot down over Foggia in Italy in 1943  and taken prisoner by the Germans. He was sent to an Italian prison hospital as he had dislocated both his thighs on landing. He later escaped from the hospital before his legs were properly mended when he learned he was being moved to Germany. He had managed to get fairly fit but his thighs were still partly dislocated. He lived with the partisans (Garibaldi Brigade Romagna under Riccardo Fedel) in the Apennines for some months. He joined up with a group of British officers who had escaped from Castello di Vincigliata prison PG 12 camp during the Italian Armistice in September 1943. They included Brigadier ‘Rudolf’ Vaughan, Lieutenant-Colonel John Combe (John Frederick Boyce Combe), Brigadier ‘Ted’ Todhunter, (Edward Joseph Todhunter), Captain Guy Ruggles-Brise (Guy E Ruggles-Brise) and Lieutenant, ‘Dan’ Ranfurly, (Thomas Daniel Knox, 6th Earl of Ranfurly). In March 1944 with the help of Italian guides they made an astonishing 250 mile walk across the mountains to keep a rendezvous with agents on the coast. The travelling was difficult through snow, and the efforts of ‘Rudolph’ Vaughan with his game leg and Jack Reiter with his dislocated thighs became an inspiration to them all.

In May they sailed the leaking boat about seventy miles along the coast just past the front line and were taken in tow by a passing Italian fishing boat into Ortona Harbour. After he returned to the United States, he put his experience to use by training military personnel in escape and survival techniques behind enemy lines. Colonel Reiter was later posted by the Air Force to Italy and as a senior briefing officer to General Curtis LeMay at Strategic Air Command headquarters. After leaving the Air Force, Reiter became a member of the Air Force Association and Army Navy Country Club in Arlington, Virginia. He was vice president for government affairs for World Airways and the Washington representative for Flying Tigers International and Japan Airlines.

Mudholkar was educated at Elphinstone High School, Bombay; Elphinstone College, Bombay; Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge, Lincoln’s Inn, London. He practised at the Bar at Amravati during 1925–1929 and at Nagpur during 1930-1941. He was the son of Rao Bahadur Raghunath Narasinha Mudholkar, a distinguished lawyer and President of the Indian National Congress at the 1912 session in Bankipur. He became District & Sessions Judge during September 1941 – June 1948. He became High Court Judge at Nagpur High Court during June 1948 – October, 1956. He went to the Bombay High Court as Judge during November 1956 – September 1960 and was acting Chief Justice of the Bombay High Court during August – September 1960. He was amongst the first Indian Supreme Court justices to proclaim the notion that later became known as the Basic Structure of the Indian Constitution. In his separate concurring judgment agreeing with the majority to dismiss the petition of Sajjan Singh v. State of Rajasthan, Mudholkar averred, somewhat hesitatingly, that constitution had certain \"basic features\" that cannot be amended by Parliament through its amending powers under Article 368: Before I part with this case I wish to make it clear that what I have said in this judgment is not an expression of my final opinion but only an expression of certain doubts which have assailed me regarding a question of paramount importance to the citizens of our country: to know whether the basic features of the Constitution under which we live and to which we owe allegiance are to endure for all time -or at least for the foreseeable future - or whether the yard no more enduring than the implemental and subordinate provisions of the Constitution. After his retirement, Mudholkar served as a Special Judge inquiring into allegations of corruption against several Orissan politicians, including then Chief Minister R. N. Singhdeo and former Chief Minister Hare Krushna Mahatab. Dr. Mahtab, represented by Siddhartha Shankar Ray, sued to quash Mudholkar's recommendations in the Orissa High Court. In Dr. Harekrushna Mahtab vs The Chief Minister Of Orissa and Others Chief Justice G Mishra ruled against Mahatab, stating in his order, \"...The criticism that the conclusions of Sri Mudholkar were such as could not be reached by any reasonable man is unfounded. ...The State Government fully acted within jurisdiction in getting the alienations verified by Sri Mudholkar, even though earlier it had the satisfaction that there was no prima facie case.\"",
