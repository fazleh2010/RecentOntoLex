  "text" : "Dharma Pala (1035-1060) was ruler of Pala Dynasty (900–1100) of Kamarupa Kingdom. Harsha Pala's son, named Dharma Pala, left three copper plates: 1. Khonamukh Plates 2. Subhankarapataka Grant 3. Pushpabhadra Plates The first and second charters were composed by the same poet since they are couched in similar language and were issued by Dharma Pala (resplendent in the grandiosity and pomposity of usual titles). The Khonamukh charter was issued in the first year of his reign. The donee was Bhatta Mahabahu who was son of Vishnu and grandson of Ummoka and sprang from a Brahmin family, belonging to the Kashyapa gotra and the Kanva sakha of the Yajurveda and hailing from Madhya Desa. The charter at serial 2 was issued in the third regnal year. The donee hails from village Krodanja in Sravasti, famous for its learned Brahmins. The said village has been identified with Karanja in Dinajpur district of Bangladesh. The name of Krodanja is elsewhere found as Krodanchi and Kolanchi, which was centre of learned Brahmins in the Kanauj region of UP and the Brahmins of this place, who settled in north Bengal appears to have given the name of their old habitation to their new habitat as in the cases of Sravasti and Tarkari. The introduction of the first two Prasati is exception in the sense that it has the name of its composer, Prasthanakalsa, unlike the earlier inscription in Assam, excepting the Gachtal copper plate inscription of Gopala, composed by Balabhadra. The mention of Dharmapala as \"flourishing in a city called Kamarupanagar\" in Aniruddha's Prasati has created controversy, for the capital of Brahma Pala line is named Hadappaka in some records and Durjaya in others. It is also accepted that Ratna Pala transferred his capital to Durjaya and Gopala restored it to Hadappaka. It is thus difficult to determine if Kamarupanagar is same as Hadappaka or it is different and new city altogether. Bhattacharya (1933) thinks that Dharmapala's capital has to be identified with the city that later was known as Kamatapur on the Dharla, a tributary of the Brahmaputra. Since the ruins of Kamatapur lie 14 miles south-west of Cooch Behar and 40 miles from Dhubri on the Brahmaputra, observations of Bhattacharya lacks credence, more so because of the evidence later revealed by the Gachtal plates. Some other related facts need attention. In 1809, Buchanan Hamilton spoke of the ruins of Dharma Pala's city near Dimla in Rangpur district of Bangladesh, about 2 miles from the Tista and regarded the King as belonging to Pala Dynasty of Kamarupa.

Weissman released a solo album \"The Things That Trouble My Mind\" for Capitol in 1964, before moving into a career as a studio musician, record producer and songwriter. In 1972 Weissman moved to Colorado and began writing instructional books for banjo and guitar, which were published by Mel Bay. To date, he has written 15 published books on music and the music business and has written over fifty instructional folios for various music publishers. He later became a tenured professor in the Music & Entertainment Industry program at the University of Colorado at Denver. In 1979, Dick recorded a solo album on Kicking Mule Records, Inc. Its name is \"Modern Banjo - Mountain Style\". As stated on the jacket, this was a great challenge for him and he dedicated the album to guitarist Sam Brown. He dedicated to Sam because he \"thought that he (Sam) might have liked some of the music on this record\" and because \"Sam Brown (was) one of my favorite guitarists.\" Sam Brown died shortly after the album was completed. According to Dick, \"a victim of the music business, New York City, and his own frustrations.\" Between 1994 and 2005, Weissman recorded three additional solo albums, for the Folk Era, Wind River and Long Bridge folk labels.",
