He was minister at the Methodist Church in Georgetown, D.C. while he served as chaplain of the US House. He then served from 1838-1847 as a minister in Philadelphia. He next took up a position as minister in Cincinnati, Ohio. In 1850 Stockton attempted to set up an independent, non-denomination church. He was elected president of Miami University but declined the appointment. Later in 1850 Stockton returned to Baltimore and the Methodist Protestants. Stockton gave the opening prayer at the consecration of the National Cemetery at Gettyburg, the ceremony during which Abraham Lincoln later gave the Gettysburg Address.

  "text" : "Theodore A. \"Ted\" Morde (May 18, 1911 – June 26, 1954) was an adventurer, explorer, diplomat, spy, journalist, and television news producer best known for his claim of discovering the \"Lost City of the Monkey God\". Morde began his career as a radio announcer before getting into journalism. In 1940, he was hired to lead an expedition to search for the \"Lost City of the Monkey God\" in Honduras. After five months, he claimed to have found the city and brought thousands of artifacts back to the United States to prove it. He promised to return soon for a proper excavation, but never did, nor did he reveal the precise location of his find. Morde spent the later years of his life as a diplomat, then a producer of news films. He took his own life in 1954. In 2013, Christopher S. Stewart wrote a book about Morde and his hunt for a legendary \"lost city\" that some have equated with la Ciudad Blanca.",
