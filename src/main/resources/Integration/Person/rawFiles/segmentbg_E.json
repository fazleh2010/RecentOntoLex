  "text" : "Edward Oramel Austin, (December 1825 – August 1909) was a settler and founder of Austin, Pennsylvania, USA. Austin was born in December 1825 in Greene, New York. He traveled to Whites Corners, Potter County, Pennsylvania in 1841 along with his parents. He stayed there until 1856, when he settled in Freeman Run, Potter County, Pennsylvania. Austin lived in a small cabin he built which is now Main Street in Austin. In 1878 he built a larger home. There now stands a replica of Austin's home very close to where it originally stood. It houses a museum dedicated to him, the Austin Dam, the flood of 1911, and the overall history of the town. The original home was destroyed by the 1911 flood. He was a surveyor by trade. Also, he was a Justice of the Peace his entire life. After first settling in Austin, which at the time was part of Sylvania Township, Austin built a road of 3 miles (4.8 km) from his place to Costello, formally North Wharton. Later, in 1870, he built a state road from Austin to Keating Summit, to give a railroad connection to Austin. The clearing of his tract of land in Austin ultimately led to great manufacturing interests, and industrial development. Therefore, he was able to bring in the business of Goodyear and Mr. Garretson. The borough of Austin was named after him and it was officially incorporated in October 1888. He actually owned the 147 acres on which the town was built. Because of his skills as a civil engineer and land surveyor he was able to draw plans to lay out the town as he saw fit. From 1847 to 1849, Austin spent time studying law, although he had no intention of practicing. He also did some writing about Potter County which was incorporated in Egle's History of Pennsylvania. He was a Justice of the Peace for 55 years. It is possible he was the oldest serving in the state for a time. He was a school director for 40 years. Austin was elected County Commissioner in 1863 and served two terms. He served in the Civil War from late 1862 until July 1865. He was a member of the Masons at the level of Master Mason.",
