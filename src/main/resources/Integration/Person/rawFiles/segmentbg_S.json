Professor Wiessner teaches U.S. Constitutional Law and International Law. He has published widely in the fields of constitutional law, international law, human rights, international indigenous law, the law of armed conflict, arbitration, space law and refugee law. In 1989, he published a book on the function of nationality, and he is the co-author, with Michael Reisman of the Yale Law School, of a leading casebook on international law, International Law in Contemporary Perspective (2004).Throughout his life, Professor Wiessner has pushed the envelope in favor of social justice, protection of the poor and marginalized. In Germany, as a young lawyer in 1980, he safeguarded the due process rights of asylum seekers through a novel interpretation of the country’s constitution which was, in essence, adopted by the country’s Federal Constitutional Court. Coming to Yale Law School in 1982, he was immersed in that institution’s distinctive problem-oriented approach to law, saw it as a liberation from the straitjacket of positivism, and redefined the role of the lawyer as leader and problem solver in society, a “doctor of the social order.” By taking into account conflicting claims, past trends in decision and evaluating past decisions in light of a public order of human dignity, he suggests developing decisions best suited to maximize access by all to all things humans value. He applied this “New Haven Approach” to issues of mass atrocities as well as conflicts over the allocation of resources. His main contribution to an order of human dignity worldwide has been, as of yet, his research on, and subsequent development of, the law regarding the rights and status of indigenous peoples. He first made the argument, laid out in the Harvard Human Rights Journal in 1999, that customary international law protects indigenous peoples’ rights to land, their cultural traditions, and self-government. As Chair of the International Law Association’s Committee on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples he led 30 experts from around the globe to a thorough review of this position, culminating in the organization’s emphatic approval of Resolution No. 5/2012 confirming those rights to their lands, culture and autonomy at its meeting in Sofia, Bulgaria in August 2012. His other abiding achievement is the creation of the Graduate Program in Intercultural Human Rights, founded in 2001. This combination of a unique and most successful LL.M. Program with a highly selective J.S.D. program requiring publication of students’ theses has made St. Thomas known and respected globally and locally. Many graduates of the program are now working in the field and transporting values of human dignity. In the 303 students graduating from the LL.M. program so far, it sent out “warriors for dignity” who are confidently using the arms of the law and other peaceful instruments to bring about positive change in all four corners of the world.On March 14, 2013, Professor Wiessner received the Law Professor of the Year Award by the humanitarian organization Lawyers to the Rescue.",
