Thomas Laxton was born in the village of Tinwell, Rutland in 1830. He practised as a solicitor in Stamford before his interest in horticulture led him to become an authority on plant hybridisation. By 1858 Laxton was breeding plants. initially he worked from St Mary's Hill, Stamford and corresponded with Charles Darwin from this address. Early correspondence with Darwin referred to Laxton's work on hybridising peas. Laxton applied scientific methods to plant breeding, making careful observations of parent plants. Laxton recognised the susceptibility of plants to disease and resistance of these diseases by their American counterparts. Laxton made observations on gooseberries and Darwin corresponded with him during the 1860s and 1870s on his work. Laxton is probably widely remembered for his contribution to strawberry breeding. In 1872 Laxton began to introduce strawberry varieties from his plant breeding work. Laxton moved the business to Bedford in 1879 and in 1885 Kelly’s directory identifies him as a ‘seed grower and merchant’ listed at 1 Harpur Place Bedford. In 1884 Laxton introduced his first major strawberry success 'Noble' a chance seedling of 'Excelsior' and 'American Sharpless'. Followed by 'King of the Earlies' in 1888. These two varieties formed the parentage of Laxton’s 'Royal Sovereign' in 1892. Laxton married twice with three daughters from his first marriage and four sons from his second marriage. Two sons William and Edward went into partnership to form Laxton Brothers in 1888. Thomas Laxton died in August 1893. The brothers recognised their father's horticultural contribution by introducing the pea 'Thomas Laxton' in his honour in 1898.",
