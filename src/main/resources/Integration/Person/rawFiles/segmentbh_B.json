  "text" : "Brent Hodge (born July 9, 1985) is a Canadian-New Zealander documentary filmmaker and entrepreneur. He is best known for his documentaries I Am Chris Farley, A Brony Tale and The Pistol Shrimps. He has been nominated for six Leo Awards for his documentary movies Winning America, What Happens Next? and A Brony Tale, winning one for A Brony Tale in 2015,. He was nominated for two Shorty Awards under the \"director\" category in 2014 and 2015 for his work on The Beetle Roadtrip Sessions and A Brony Tale. Hodge also won a Canadian Screen Award in 2014 for directing The Beetle Roadtrip Sessions with Grant Lawrence. Hodge's documentary, The Pistol Shrimps (2016), follows a LA-based female basketball team, The Pistol Shrimps—including actress Aubrey Plaza and founder Maria Blasucci (Drunk History)—who come together for weekly matches filled with trash-talking, hard-fouling, wisecracking action. The documentary was co-produced with Warrior Poets and Morgan Spurlock as Executive Producer. The documentary won a Founders Award at Michael Moore's Traverse City Film Festival in July 2016. The Pistol Shrimps is distributed by NBC's subscription streaming service, Seeso and available online. Hodge directed I Am Chris Farley in 2015 with Derik Murray of Network Entertainment. The documentary is based on the life of comedian actor Chris Farley and features interviews with numerous actors, comedians and others who worked with Farley during his career. The film was long listed for an Academy Award. In 2014, Hodge released his critically acclaimed documentary A Brony Tale. It delves into the world of the teenage and adult fans of the television show My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic (called bronies) through the eyes of musician and voice actress Ashleigh Ball on her trip to the 2012 BronyCon. He has also done corporate work for Time Magazine, CBC Music, Tourism Alberta, National Film Board of Canada (for the movie Hue: A Matter of Colour), as well as technology startups Uber, Hootsuite and Steve Russell's analytics startup Prism Skylabs. Hodgee Films partnered with Morgan Spurlock in 2014 when Spurlock picked up their A Brony Tale documentary for theatrical distribution, under his \"Morgan Spurlock Presents\" label, a partnership between Warrior Poets, Virgil Films and Abramorama. A Brony Tale was the first film released under this label. The company worked with Spurlock again on the web series Consider the Source, also partnering with Disney's Maker Studios.",

  "text" : "Bertha of Milan or Bertha of Luni (c. 997-c. 1040), was a member of the Obertenghi dynasty. Bertha was married to Ulric Manfred II of Turin. She is sometimes identified with the Bertha who was married to Arduin of Ivrea. Although it is known that Bertha was a member of the Otbertenghi dynasty, there is some debate about who her parents were. Her father is often said to be Oberto II, but others argue that Bertha’s father was in fact Otbert III of Milan. By 1014 at the latest, Bertha had married Ulric Manfred (that year, Emperor Henry II confirmed their joint donation to the abbey of Fruttuaria). Her dowry included lands in the counties of Tortona, Parma and Piacenza. In May 1028 with her husband, Ulric Manfred, Bertha founded the convent of Santa Maria at Caramagna. The following year, in July 1029, along with her husband and his brother, Bishop Alric of Asti, Bertha founded the Benedictine abbey in of S. Giusto in Susa, which housed the relics of Saint Justus of Novalesa. The church of the Abbey of San Giusto is now Susa Cathedral. After Ulric Manfred’s death (in December 1033 or 1034), Bertha briefly acted as regent for their daughter, Adelaide of Susa. In 1037 Bertha captured envoys who wished to cross the Alps from Piedmont to Champagne, thus foiling a conspiracy against Emperor Conrad II. Conrad II rewarded Bertha for her part in suppressing the rebellion against him by issuing an imperial diploma which confirmed her donations to the abbey of S. Giusto in Susa. With Ulric Manfred, Bertha had three daughters: \n* Adelaide \n* Immilla \n* Bertha",
