He was a member of the Gereformeerde Kerk (or 'Dopper' church) and served as a ‘kerkraadslid’. Elected leader of the trekkers, he left Pretoria on 27 May 1874. Alberts led ten families across the Kalahari, taking 50 oxwagons and 1,400 cattle with them.

Three families turned back before they crossed the Kgalagadi Desert, where a handful of cattle were lost during the waterless journey. Reaching Lake Ngami on 29 April 1875, they demanded Hendrik Matthys Van Zyl, a trader based in Ghanzi with a reputation for ruthlessness, access to his wells, but he initially refused. He ultimately agreed to let them have water, and the trekkers continued to Rietfontein, on the border with German Southwest Africa.
