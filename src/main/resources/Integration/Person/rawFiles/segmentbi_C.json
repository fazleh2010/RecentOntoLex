  "text" : "(Caroline) Mary Ridding (30 August 1862 – 9 November 1941) was a scholar of Sanskrit and Pali, and a librarian. She is known for translating Banabhatta's Kadambari into English in 1896. She was born in Meriden, West Midlands (then in Warwickshire). Her father, William Ridding (1830-1900), was the vicar of Meriden and also played cricket, and her mother was Caroline Selina Caldecott. She was also close to Lady Laura (Palmer) Ridding, the wife of her uncle George Ridding. She won a scholarship to read Classics at Girton College in 1883 and was there until 1886. After this, she financed her further studies by taking up tutoring, including a job as a classics tutor in London. She was one of the first (and possibly the first) English woman Sanskrit scholars, and published a translation of Bāṇabhaṭṭa's portion of the Kādambarī in 1896. She was a student of E. B. Cowell and, following his death in 1903, was instrumental in getting about 260 books of his as an acquisition (\"Cowell Library\") into the Girton College Library in 1904. She catalogued these books herself, and was the first woman to be officially employed in the Cambridge University Library, going on to catalogue many important collections. In 1923, when Cambridge University began to allow women to receive titular degrees, she got her Master of Arts degree. Apart from being a scholar in Sanskrit in Pali, she also knew a bit of Bengali and Hindi. In later life she was particularly interested in Tibet, and was a reviewer for Tibetan books in the Journal of Asiatic Studies. She was an admirer of Charlotte Mary Yonge, and presented her collection of Yonge's work to Girton College before and at her death. The Ridding Reading Prize competition at Girton College was founded in her honour.",

  "text" : "Clifford Y. Stephens (1891 – April 1971) was the owner of High's Dairy Store. Stephens started out as a farmer and dairyman. He went to Iowa State and graduated in 1925 working locally. Later he worked for Pet in Greensboro North Carolina. At the peak of the depression in 1933, he bought controlling interest in the Washington based High's Dairy Products Corporation. With a $1,800 loan he operated ten ice cream stores and a plant at 1326 Half street SE in Washington. In 1941, Stephens took over as sole owner of the High's Dairy Store Corporation. Stephens opened plants in Washington and Frederick to process milk. The Frederick plant opened in 1959 with a production capacity of 100,000 gallons daily. He became active in politics regarding milk cooperatives, creating \"Marylander for Milk Freedom\" in 1959 to oppose price controls on state milk production. In 1961, Stephens created the East Coast Ice Cream Novelty Company which constructed a large Ice cream manufacturing plant on Whiskey Bottom Road. The plant in later years would be expanded to become the second largest Ice cream plant on the east coast, operated by Nestle, with the offices later becoming the Phillips School for students with youth with cognitive, emotional, social learning or behavioral challenges. Stephens became a trustee of Hood College in Frederick and Glenelg Country School. In 1962, Stephens donated all of his stock to his alma matter, the Campus of Iowa State University which in turn named a auditorium after him. The Capitol Milk Producers of Frederick repurchased the stock, retaining Stephens as president. In 1962, Senator Frank E. Shipley bypassed the state school board nominating commission recommendation of Fred Schoenbrodt, and installed C.Y. Stephens.In October 1963, Stephens was indicted with multiple milk producers for price fixing between 1956 and 1960. A month later, Stephens died outside of Annapolis, Maryland colliding his car with another on the Severn River Bride on 29 November 1963. \n* Stephens Road in North Laurel is named after C.Y.
