  "text" : "John Hayward (1819 – March 13, 1885) was a lawyer, judge and politician in Newfoundland. He served in the Newfoundland House of Assembly from 1852 to 1866. He was born and educated in Harbour Grace. He studied law with George Henry Emerson and was called to the Newfoundland bar in 1841. He served as chief clerk and registrar for the northern circuit court and as sub-collector of customs at Harbour Grace. In 1849, John and his young family headed for Washington County in Wisconsin. They traveled during a week and a half. They took a boat from Newfoundland to New York, then up the canals to Albany, another boat to Buffalo. They traveled to Wisconsin by wagon and bought a farm and had land cleared. After a few months, in a letter to his father-in-law, he seems full of optimism. In spite of that, he was back in Harbour Grace at the end of 1850, and was sub-collector of Customs in 1851.
