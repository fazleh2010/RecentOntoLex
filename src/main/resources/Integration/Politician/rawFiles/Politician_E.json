He was born in 1837 in Delmar, Maryland and died in 1907 in the City of Baltimore, Maryland. He is buried at the Parsons Cemetery in Salisbury, Maryland, the county seat of Wicomico County. He was part owner of Pemberton Hall, listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1971. Governor Jackson is also known as having attended the ceremonies at Gettysburg Battlefield in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania from the largest military battle on the North American continent in July 1863, dedicating several regimental and battle monuments for engagements participated in by the Union Army (United States Army), and even visiting some already erected and privately funded Confederate States Army monuments, and showing equanimity towards both sides with several regiments of Maryland troops in both armies, including regiments from the former pre-war State Militia. During the ceremonies and travels through the battlefield areas, he and his staff carried a revived Maryland state flag incorporating the shield from the coats-of-arms of the old colonial proprietary family of the Calverts and Crosslands, with both the black/gold chevrons of the paternal Calvert family and the red/white colors of the split bottony crosses (trefoil) of the maternal Crossland family. The ancestral parents of the first Lord Baltimore, Sir George Calvert, (1579–1632), the first Baron Baltimore (Lord Baltimore) who originally received the granting charter in 1632 from King Charles I of England for the new third English colony and Province of Maryland, which after his sudden death, was transferred to his eldest son and heir, Cecilius Calvert, [1605-1675], (the second Baron Baltimore and Lord Baltimore) who then became the first Lord Proprietor of the Colony while still living in England. It was he who sent the first two ships (the \"Ark\" and the \"Dove\") to the shores of the Potomac River and the Chesapeake Bay with colonists who first briefly visited Virginia further south, then landed in March 1634, established the new capital St. Mary's City, under his younger brother Leonard Calvert, (1606–1647), as the first colonial governor. By the end of the 19th century, carrying the old colonial armorial bearings from the shield emblazoned on a newly revived state flag, now seemed symbolic of the revival of reconciliation and sense of moving forward in the state so deeply torn asunder during the recent Civil War. There are several photographs of the Governor and his staff arrayed in front of several of the Maryland military monuments at Gettysburg, dressed in military uniforms and with the new state flag prominently posted alongside. It was officially adopted in 1904 as the state flag by act of the General Assembly of Maryland in the historic 18th-century Maryland State House in the later state capital of Annapolis.",

In 1799, he graduated from Williams College, then made his way to Oneida County, New York where he studied law. In 1806, he was admitted to the New York State bar and moved to Buffalo. For nearly two years Walden was the only lawyer west of Batavia. He invested heavily in real estate in this area, owning what became known as Walden Farm at what is now Fillmore and Walden Avenue. In 1812, he married Suzanna Marvin. He was a member of the New York State Assembly (Cattaraugus, Chautauqua and Niagara Co.) in 1812. During the War of 1812 Walden leased land to the Federal government and the Buffalo Barracks are erected. The front portion of the barracks later became what is the Theodore Roosevelt Inaugural National Historic Site. He was one of the few who stayed behind during the burning of Buffalo and trying to save as many lives as possible. Walden's home was used by General Winfield Scott as his headquarters. After the war, he erected the first brick dwelling in Buffalo. He was one of the four original trustees of the village of Buffalo and served as a member of the Buffalo Harbor Company, which improved Buffalo's harbor to attract the village as the western terminus of the Erie Canal. Walden became the first judge of Erie County Court in 1823 and held the position for five years. He was a presidential elector in 1828. On March 13, 1838, the Common Council met and made Walden its choice for mayor. During his term, the entire school system was reorganized. After his term as mayor, Walden retired to his farm in Lake View, New York. He died there on November 10, 1857, and was buried in the Myer-Walden mausoleum in Forest Lawn Cemetery.",
