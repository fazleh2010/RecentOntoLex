  "text" : "John Golding (9 March 1931 – 20 January 1999) was a Labour Party politician and Trade Union leader in the United Kingdom. He was educated at Chester City Grammar School, Keele University and the London School of Economics. After some time working in the Civil Service he took up a research job with the Post Office Engineering Union. Golding was elected Member of Parliament (MP) for Newcastle-under-Lyme at a by-election in 1969. He served in the governments of Harold Wilson and Jim Callaghan, as PPS to Eric Varley as Minister of Technology, a Labour whip in opposition, and Minister for Employment. He was an outspoken opponent of Labour left-wingers such as Tony Benn and Eric Heffer, whom he regarded as idle dreamers out of touch with the working-class. Golding was a key figure in opposing the entryist Militant group, and especially in mobilising moderate trades union leaders to exercise their block votes to achieve this end. After he died, his writings were published under the title Hammer of the Left: My Part in Defeating the Labour Left by John Golding and Paul Farrelly (see below). In 1986 he left Parliament (by applying for the Chiltern Hundreds) to take up the post of General Secretary of the National Communications Union. He held this post until 1988. He had served as a member of the council of the Trades Union Congress. After he vacated the Newcastle-under-Lyme seat, the resulting by-election was won by his wife Llin, who held the seat until 2001; her successor in the seat was Paul Farrelly. John Golding's most unusual claim to fame is that he once made a speech in committee lasting eleven hours and fifteen minutes. It nominally concerned a small amendment to the bill to privatise British Telecom. This filibuster was instrumental in delaying the privatisation until after the 1983 general election, but with Margaret Thatcher obtaining a massive parliamentary majority the privatisation was soon forced through. Changes in British parliamentary procedure mean that Golding's record is unlikely ever to be beaten.",

  "text" : "Josiah Trowbridge (1785–1862) was mayor of Buffalo, New York, serving in 1837. He was born in Framingham, Massachusetts on September 29, 1785. In 1808 or 1809, he was licensed to practice as a physician and began work in Weathersfield, Vermont. He arrived at Buffalo in 1811. During the War of 1812, he joined the Buffalo Light Artillery Company and tended to the wounded during the first assault on Black Rock and during the burning of the village on December 31, 1813, Trowbridge was one of the last to leave, helping to secure the safety of the women and children. On September 22, 1813, he married Margaret Wintermute of Fort Erie, Ontario. He was among the many of Buffalo 's early pioneers who suffered from the economic collapse of 1836–1837, and from the speculation of Benjamin Rathbun. In 1816, he was elected as the first Treasurer of the Village of Buffalo, then elected Supervisor of Buffalo in 1823, 1825, and 1827. He was elected mayor by the Common council and accepted the office of Mayor on March 14, 1837. During his term, several new positions with the city were created, including superintendent of schools and the office of police justice. Also during his short term, the Canadian revolutionary movement, or \"Patriot War\" resulted in so much unrest in the city that it was becoming difficult to keep order. On June 17, 1837 he took a leave of absence and resigned as mayor on December 21, 1837. The council appointed Alderman Pierre A. Barker as mayor pro tem. Trowbridge resumed his medical practice and was actively engaged in his profession for 50 years. In 1839 he was president, and from 1843 to 1853, librarian, of the Erie County Medical Society and, in 1845, served as the first president of the Buffalo Medical Association. In 1847, was elected the first President of the Buffalo General Hospital and was on the medical board of the Buffalo Hospital of the Sisters of Charity.

He was known as Johnny De Pow by his constituents. Along with Bathhouse John Coughlin and Hinky Dink Kenna, Powers was considered one of the leaders of the \"Gray Wolves\" of Chicago politics. Powers arrived in Chicago in 1872 and began working as an apprentice to a grocer. After opening his own grocery store, he added a tavern next to it and used his exposure there to begin a political career as a ward captain. In 1888, Powers ran for alderman of Chicago's 19th ward and won, after which he closed his grocery, but continued to run his saloon, eventually going into business with fellow an alderman, William O'Brian, to open a larger saloon which included gambling. Powers introduced the practice of distributing free turkeys, ducks, and geese to voters at Christmas, but his inability to keep his ward clean of garbage or maintain the schools led Jane Addams to target him. Addams also focused on Powers' corruption, citing instances of cronyism and bribery. Powers, in turn, used Addams's attacks on him to brand her as anti-Catholic, but he also hired her to be the ward's garbage inspector, the only paying job she ever held. In 1903, Powers ran against incumbent Peter F. Galligan for the state senate. During the campaign, Galligan showed up at Powers's home and attacked him with a brickbat. Powers won the election, but the following year he returned to Chicago and was reelected to serve as the 19th ward alderman, a position he retained until 1927. By the 1910s, the ethnic makeup of his ward had begun to change. Instead of being 90 percent Irish, it was only about 50 percent Irish, with the remainder being made up of Italian and Jewish immigrants. On September 28, 1920, a bomb exploded at Powers' home at 1284 Macalister shortly after he arrived, this proved to be the opening salvo in the 1921 aldermanic election. In 1921, Anthony D'Andrea, who Powers had supported for ward committeeman in 1919, but pulled his support after the Supreme Court negated D'Andrea's initial victory, challenged Powers for his seat as alderman. The election was marked by violence, which continued after Powers won the election by 381 votes. Shortly after the election, D'Andrea was assassinated. This election was the culmination of the Aldermen's Wars. Powers died as his home at 6038 Sheridan Road, on May 19, 1930, suffering from pulmonary edema and anemia, although he had been suffering throat tumors since 1929.",
