  "text" : "Alan F. Mitchell (4 November 1922 – 3 August 1995) was a British forester, dendrologist and botanist, and author of several books on trees. He almost single-handedly measured every notable tree in the British Isles, founding the Tree Register of the British Isles (T.R.O.B.I.), which held records of over 100,000 individual notable trees at the time of his death. During the Second World War, he served with the Fleet Air Arm in the Far East. Returning by troop ship in the Red Sea at the end of the war, he pondered his future and decided it would be trees. In 1976, the Royal Forestry Society of England, Wales, and Northern Ireland awarded him its Medal for Distinguished Service to Forestry (Gold Medal) during a Society meeting at Westonbirt. (From a tribute by Esmond Harris, Quarterly Journal of Forestry, January 1996, page 67). His 1987 book The Guide to Trees of Canada and North America is dedicated to his sister Christine. The book makes occasional oblique reference to a trip to North America in 1976. Mitchell's Rule states: \"If there are tree stumps or felled trunks nearby, count the annual growth rings and measure the trunk circumference to find local growth rates\"."

  "text" : "Nur al-Din `Ali ibn Abi Bakr ibn Sulayman, Abu al-Hasan al-Haythami (735AH 1335 – 807AH 1404) was a Sunni Shafi`i Islamic scholar from Cairo, whose father had a shop on a desert road. He was born in the month of Rajab in 735 H. corresponding to 1335 CE. He learned the Qur'an and memorized it, and when he was a teenager, he became a disciple of a highly renowned scholar of Hadith, Abd Al-Raheem ibn Al-Hussain ibn Abd Al-Rahman, who was better known as Zain Al-Deen Al-Iraqi. Al-Haythami became a committed associate of Al-Iraqi, staying with him all the time, traveling with him when he traveled, and offering the pilgrimage in his company. He attended with him every circle he attended in Cairo, other cities in Egypt, Makkah, Madinah, Jerusalem, Damascus, Baalbak, Aleppo and other places. The only teacher under whom Al-Haythami read, without being attended by Al-Iraqi, was Ibn Abd Al-Hadi, from whom he heard the Sahih collection of Imam Muslim. On the other hand, Al-Iraqi heard from only four teachers without Al-Haythami taking part. Al-Iraqi, who was only ten years older than Al-Haythami, was a highly distinguished scholar of Hadith. Al-Haythami was also to distinguish himself as a scholar of Hadith, but despite his broad scholarly achievement, he preferred to remain in the shadow of his teacher and friend, Al-Iraqi. Indeed, Al-Iraqi relied on Al-Haythami in conducting much of his affairs, and gave him his daughter in marriage. He trained him in a particular area of Hadith scholarship and Al-Haythami was to achieve distinction in this field and to produce highly valuable works in it. This is the area of Zawa’id which we will presently discuss. Al-Haythami was exemplary in his religious devotion, and his serious approach to Hadith scholarship. He cared little for worldly matters, which are the main preoccupation of many people, dedicating himself to the study of Hadith, and associating only with Hadith scholars. While Al-Iraqi was alive, he taught Hadith in his presence. Similarly, Al-Iraqi rarely taught without Al-Haythami being present. But after Al-Iraqi’s death, he was sought by many students who wished to read under him. He taught unhesitatingly, but without assuming any personal distinction. He is praised by many scholars for his humility, kindly manner, and dedication to learning. Ibn Hajar, a Hadith scholar of the highest caliber who studied much under Al-Haythami, describes him as very kind, highly critical of anyone indulging in a practice that is unacceptable to Islam, yet he was extremely tolerant when it came to personal grievances. When other students of Al-Iraqi repeatedly tried to irritate him, he simply tolerated them without much complaint. While many scholars mention his commitment to his teacher, showing him great respect in all situations, all are agreed that his own knowledge was broad, and that he distinguished himself by his great achievement in Hadith scholarship. They are also agreed that he was highly devoted in his worship, very pious and very kind in his dealing with other people. As we have already said, Al-Haythami distinguished himself in a particular area of Hadith scholarship, namely Zawa’id, which linguistically means ‘addition or increase’. This is a comparative study seeking to identify all the Hadiths that are listed in a collection by a distinguished Hadith scholar but are not listed in any of the six main Hadith collections. This is highly useful for students of Hadith, because it identifies for them which Hadiths they need to learn from any particular collection, if they have already learned the six main ones. Moreover, many of these collections, from which Al-Haythami extracted the Zawa’id, are not arranged according to topics of Fiqh, while Al-Haythami arranged them on this basis, which makes for easier reference. Hence, his work is highly valuable. In all, Al-Haythami extracted the Zawa’id from Al-Musnad by Ahmad ibn Hanbal, and also from Al-Bazzar’s collection, Ibn Hibban’s Sahih, Al-Musnad by Abu Ya’la, as well as the three collections named Al-Mu’jam by Al-Tabarani, and then collected all these and listed them all in one voluminous work which he called Majma’ Al-Zawa’id wa Manba’ Al-Fawa’id. He dropped all chains of transmission and arranged his book according to the topics of Fiqh, which is the pattern used in the six main collections of Hadith. He graded each Hadith, pointing out which were authentic and which lacked in authenticity. Alternatively, he would mention names of narrators who were questioned or regarded as unreliable. It should be pointed out that not all Al-Haythami’s gradings were acceptable to later Hadith scholars. The book was published in 10 volumes by Qudsi in Cairo about 70 years ago, but more recently, a new annotated edition was published by Dar Al-Fikr in Beirut, Lebanon. The omission of chains of transmission, justified on grounds of brevity, has been felt as a defect in this work, but it remains a great encyclopedia of Hadith. Al-Haythami was praised for it by his contemporaries and by later scholars. Al-Haythami died on 19 Ramadan 807 H, corresponding to 1405 CE. May God bestow abundant mercy on his soul."

Prozorovsky's career was furthered by his maternal Galitzine relatives, who helped him to get appointed to the office of Kursk's governor in 1780. He resigned two years later and spent the following years at his country estates. In 1790 he returned to the active service as the Governor General of Moscow. Emperor Paul, however, couldn't get along with him and discharged Prozorovsky from his office. His ancient services were recalled in 1808, when the Russian army resumed its hostilities against Turkey, and Prozorovsky became its Commander-in-Chief. His reputation suffered a blow when his storm of Brăila ended in his army being repelled at enormous loss of life on Russian side. The old and ailing general asked Alexander I to dispatch a younger and more energetic Mikhail Kutuzov to his aid. Two months later, when Prozorovsky's army was crossing the Danube, the Field-Marshal died. His body was transported to St Petersburg and interred in the Alexander Nevsky Lavra.

  "text" : "Atu Emberson Bain is a Fijian political leader. A leading figure in the Fiji Labour Party (FLP), she served from 1999 to 2006 as one of 8 Senators nominated by the Leader of the Opposition. Bain is known for her outspoken opinions. She called for the voting age (then 21) to be lowered, for the national flag bearing the British Union Jack to be changed, and for the portrait of Queen Elizabeth II to be removed from the national currency. In 2005 she said that after 18 years as a republic, Fiji should consider whether it was appropriate to retain the symbols of its colonial past. Bain had a tense relationship with fellow-Senator Ratu George Cakobau, one of 14 nominees of the Great Council of Chiefs. Parliamentary debates between the two sometimes turned acrimonious, with Cakobau questioning her right to speak on matters pertaining to indigenous Fijians on the grounds that she was not indigenous. (Bain was registered as a General Elector, an omnibus category including Caucasians, Chinese, and other minority groups). He attacked her for commenting on the Vola ni Kawa Bula (VKB, or Native Land Register), saying that only registered members of the VKB had the right to make comments on it. Indigenous landowners, however, defended her, saying that she was taking up their cause at their own request. In late 2005, a Senatorial committee investigated a complaint from Bain that Cakobau insulted her. First appointed to the Senate in 1999 by then-Prime Minister Mahendra Chaudhry, Bain was kidnapped along with many of her colleagues and held as a hostage by gunmen led by George Speight, during the Fiji coup of 2000. Bain was not reappointed to the Senate in 2006, and differences between her and the FLP leadership subsequently became public when she joined fellow-FLP politicians Krishna Datt, Felix Anthony, Agni Deo Singh, and Poseci Bune in criticizing Mahendra's leadership style."

  "text" : "Anker Boye (born 12 February 1950) is a Danish politician representing the Social Democratic Party. He is a painter by profession. Anker Boye was elected as mayor of Odense, Denmark's third-largest city, in 1993 and served in that capacity until 2005. In 2001, he got a historic number of votes and carried almost all fourteen members of the Social Democratic group into the City Council. He was defeated in the 2005 municipal elections by the Conservative challenger, Jan Boye, County Mayor of Funen (no relation). The elections were a massive defeat for the Social Democrats, losing four of their fourteen seats in Odense City Council. The election on 15 November 2005 resulted in a tie with both wings carrying 14 of the 29 seats, the last being carried by Erik Simonsen from the Social Liberal Party. Anker Boye admitted defeat and tried to persuade Simonsen to become the new mayor with Social Democratic backing - in a live broadcast. Simonsen refused the offer and gave his support to Jan Boye from the Conservatives. Anker Boye's administration has been criticized in several respects, including his membership of a total of 47 committees taking time from his duties as mayor. Boye has also been criticized for the low number of jobs created in Odense, compared to Copenhagen and Århus, and for a number of slips in the celebration of the 200th anniversary of the birth of Hans Christian Andersen; most importantly, the huge deficit created by a charity concert starring Tina Turner. In the municipality-election 17 November 2009 Anker Boye reclaimed his former post as mayor of Odense, by winning the municipality election. The coalition made of Enhedslisten, Socialistisk Folkeparti and the Socialdemocrats won 17 out of 29 seats in the city counsel, thereby winning the majority."

  "text" : "Alexander Staliyevich Voloshin (Russian: Александр Стальевич Волóшин) (born 3 March 1956) is a Russian politician who briefly was chairman of the board of directors of RAO UES, the former Russian state power utility, which was liquidated as part of the country's comprehensive power sector reforms on 1 July 2008. In 1997, he was appointed as an assistant to the chief of the Russian presidential administration under Boris Yeltsin. He then went on to serve as a deputy chief from September 1998 to March 1999 and the Chief of Presidential Administration from 19 March to 31 December 1999. Voloshin retained his position after Vladimir Putin became acting president on 31 December 1999 and was reappointed as the Chief of the Administration after Putin's inauguration as president in May. Voloshin quickly became a core member of Putin's team and was especially praised for his intellect and his ability to \"devour work\". According to Tatyana Dyachenko, \"At work he is like some complex well-maintained machine that does not know tiredness. I sometimes don't know how he can stand it.\" Voloshin resigned on 29 October 2003. While Chief of Staff, Voloshin was widely regarded as pro-business, and his resignation amidst the prosecutorial focus on Yukos Oil Company, was seen as part of a broader turn away from free-market systems. Alexander Voloshin has been a non-executive director of Yandex since August 2010 after serving as an advisor to the company for two years. Since February 2012, Alexander Voloshin serves chairman of the board and independent director at JSC Freight One. Voloshin also served as chairman of the board of directors of Uralkali from 2010 to 2014. Voloshin served as chairman of the board of MMC Norilsk Nickel from 2008 to 2010 and as chairman of the board of directors of RAO \"UES of Russia\" from 1999 to 2008."

  "text" : "Alexander \"Alex\" Taylor (February 28, 1947 – March 12, 1993) was an American singer. Alexander Taylor was the eldest child of Dr. Isaac M. Taylor and Gertrude Taylor. He was a member of a family which produced a number of musicians, the most famous of whom is James Taylor, but also includes Livingston, Hugh and Kate Taylor. Alex Taylor had two sons, Edward and James. The elder son, Edward was adopted, and lives in North Carolina; his second son James, who resides on Martha's Vineyard, is the namesake of Alex's brother James, and inspired his uncle's 1970 hit \"Sweet Baby James.\" Alex Taylor traveled around Florida gigging and recording his finest work at a little studio in Tampa called Progressive Music. Taylor suffered a heart attack on March 7, 1993, in Sanford, Florida, while recording a third album at King Snake Records Studio. He died without regaining consciousness on March 12, 1993 (James' birthday), age 46. He was survived by his wife Brent B. Taylor, then age 46, of West Tisbury, his two sons, and granddaughters Caroline, Anna Kate, Paige, and Claudia. According to the official Rolling Stone biography of James Taylor, Alex Taylor's death has been attributed to alcoholism. Livingston Taylor has said in an interview that Taylor suddenly stopped breathing while sleeping in a Kingsnake Records studio and that this occurred shortly after Taylor downed almost a bottle of vodka (\"what was for him... not an exceptional amount of booze\"). James Taylor wrote his song \"Enough To Be On Your Way\" with Alex's funeral in mind then changed some of the details to commemorate a fictional \"Alice\". Livingston Taylor called him \"generous to the very fiber of his soul\" and \"the greatest older brother ever.\" Livingston also said that Alex supported and protected him during his troubled childhood."

  "text" : "Alexander Kobrin (Александр Кобрин, born 1980 in Moscow) is a Russian pianist. At age five, he enrolled in the Gnessin Special School of Music in Moscow where his primary teacher was Tatiana Zelikman. When he turned eighteen, he enrolled at the Moscow Tchaikovsky Conservatory, as a student of the legendary teacher, Lev Naumov, and he holds a graduate degree from that institution. As a teenager Kobrin won several youth piano competitions, but he won his first adult competition, the Scottish International Piano Competition when he was 18. The next year, in 1999, he won the Busoni Competition, after several years in which the first prize had not been awarded because no competitor's performances had been deemed worthy. In 2000, the year Yundi Li was the winner, Kobrin was third at the International Chopin Piano Competition in Warsaw, and Li says that one of his favorite memories of the competition occurred at the awards ceremony, when Kobrin lifted him in celebration of his victory. Kobrin later tied for second prize, with no first awarded, at Japan's Hamamatsu competition together with Rafal Blechacz. In June 2005 he won the Van Cliburn International Piano Competition. Among his prizes included a $20,000 cash award, a compact disc recording, concert tours and professional management both in the United States and Europe, a professional attire stipend and subsidized travel in the United States. Even before his Cliburn victory, Kobrin maintained an extensive schedule of engagements in Europe and Asia. He has performed with the Moscow Virtuosi, the Orchestre de la Suisse Romande, the Virtuosi of Salzburg Chamber Orchestra, the Moscow State Symphony Orchestra, the Rio de Janeiro Symphonic Orchestra, the English Chamber Orchestra, and the Osaka and Tokyo Symphony Orchestras. Kobrin is especially interested in the music of the classical and romantic periods. He has recorded an all-Chopin compact disc along with the compact disc of some of his performances at the Van Cliburn competition. Kobrin formerly taught at the Gnessin State Academy of Music in Moscow, but in the fall of 2009 he relocated to the United States. He currently teaches at the Schwob School of Music at Columbus State University and the Steinhardt School at New York University. Alexander Kobrin is a Yamaha Artist."

  "text" : "Abdellatif Laâbi is a Moroccan poet, born in 1942 in Fes, Morocco. Laâbi, then teaching French, founded with other poets the artistic journal Souffles, an important literary review in 1966. It was considered as a meeting point of some poets who felt the emergency of a poetic stand and revival, but which, very quickly, crystallized all Moroccan creative energies: painters, film-makers, men of theatre, researchers and thinkers. It was banned in 1972, but throughout its short life, it opened up to cultures from other countries of the Maghreb and those of the Third World. Abdellatif Laâbi was imprisoned, tortured and sentenced to ten years in prison for \"crimes of opinion\" (for his political beliefs and his writings) and served a sentence from 1972-1980. He was, in 1985, forced into exile in France. The political beliefs that were judged criminal are reflected in the following comment, for example: \"Everything which the Arab reality offers that is generous, open and creative is crushed by regimes whose only anxiety is to perpetuate their own power and self-serving interest. And what is often worse is to see that the West remains insensitive to the daily tragedy while at the same time accommodating, not to say supporting, the ruling classes who strangle the free will and aspirations of their people.\""

  "text" : "Abe Turner (1924 – October 25, 1962) was an American chess master. He had a chess rating over 2400 and played several times in the U.S. Chess Championship. He was best known as a blitz chess hustler, and was one of few masters who had a winning record against Bobby Fischer. The games were when Fischer was 14, which was the same year Fischer won his first U.S. Championship. In fact, his last round draw with Turner in the 1957 Championship clinched first for the young Fischer. Turner was born in New York City, learning how to play chess in 1943 at a naval hospital while recovering from shrapnel wounds inflicted during World War II. It was said Turner played chess mostly by grabbing a pawn and swapping pieces to reach an endgame. He frequented the Chess and Checkers Club of New York in Times Square next to the New Amsterdam Theatre, better known as the \"flea house,\" where anyone could play chess for ten cents an hour. Fischer also attended the club and was a student of Turner's. Turner placed second in the Manhattan Chess Club championship on five occasions. He considered his best performance to be fourth place at the U.S. Open at Long Beach, California in 1955, but tied for first shortly after at San Diego with William Lombardy and James Sherwin. Turner was found stabbed to death in the basement of an Upper West Side building where he had been working as a clerk for Al Horowitz for the magazine Chess Review. He had sustained nine wounds and his body had been placed inside a safe. He was found by the superintendent of the building later that afternoon. After the body was discovered, the police arrested a clerk-typist employed by the publication, who said he killed Turner (and dragged the body along a corridor to the safe) because Secret Service agents had told him to. Turner, who was 38, never married and lived with his father."

He is accused of committing, or overseeing, acts of physical and psychological torture on Bahraini citizens from 1980s until 1997. He was released from his duties in December 2002 due to protests and pressures from human rights organizations worldwide. In March 2000, King Hamad awarded Flaifel with the Order of Shaikh Isa bin Salman Al Khalifa (Third Class). Flaifel has never been charged with any crime. In the Royal Decree 56 of 2002, an edict issued by King Hamad ibn Isa al-Khalifah granted amnesty to human rights abuses committed by security officers prior to 2001. Torture allegations against Flaifel have been documented by the international human rights organizations, Human Rights Watch, and Amnesty International. Protests have been held regularly in Bahrain since 2002 demanding prosecution of Flaifel for carrying out torture. Flaifel has been accused of carrying out torture along with former Bahrain State Security chief Ian Henderson. In November 2002, 8 Bahraini torture victims lodged complaints against Flaifel with Directorate of Public Prosecutions, however no charges have been taken against him by the government of Bahrain."

  "text" : "Anthony Creighton (1922, Swanage – 22 March 2005), a British actor and writer, is best known as the co-author of the play Epitaph for George Dillon with John Osborne. He served in the RAF during the war as a navigator on bomber aircraft. He was awarded the DFC for gallantry for saving the crew of his Halifax bomber over Hamburg. During the war he met Terence Rattigan who was then a wireless operator and air gunner. They appeared together in entertainment for fellow servicemen at RAF ground stations. After the war he completed a course at RADA and subsequently joined a company at Barnstaple in Devon. Shortly afterward he formed his own travelling company, the Sage Repertory Group, with £200 given to him by his mother and was joined by three other actors from Barnstaple. An advertisement in The Stage in 1949 offering actors no salary but a share of the profits was answered by John Osborne who joined the company in Ilfracombe. His company took their plays from village to village but enjoyed little success, they presented a summer residency at the Victoria Theatre on Hayling Island but this too was short-lived. Shortly after he collaborated on two plays with Osborne, the first Personal Enemy fell foul of the censors at the time, the second was An Epitaph for George Dillon. Although Creighton had little other dramatic success, he remained a close friend and confidant of Osborne, and was living with him on a houseboat in the Thames in 1954, the year Osborne wrote Look Back in Anger. Creighton is believed to have been the model for Cliff in the play. The friendship between Osborne and Creighton faded over time. In 1960 Creighton co-wrote another play with the American writer-director Bernard Miller, Tomorrow with Pictures which was produced at the Lyric Hammersmith in 1961. It was critically well received and was to be Creighton's last produced play. Subsequently he taught drama at various London education establishments. He met Osborne on one last occasion in 1994, at Osborne's country home, to discuss George Dillon royalty payments. Osborne was by then diagnosed as diabetic and a near shadow of his former self, he died shortly after the meeting. Creighton said of the melancholy visit that he would prefer to remember the impecuniously happier times of the 1950s, \"I look back on Osborne with love\". In recent years, Creighton has attracted controversy for a different reasons. After Osborne's death in 1994, Creighton claimed in an interview with the critic Nicholas de Jongh that he and Osborne had lived together as lovers. Osborne's surviving family were quick to refute any suggestion of homosexuality on Osborne's part. Creighton finally admitted in an interview with Osborne's biographer, John Heilpern, that he had lied to de Jongh and no homosexual relationship had ever existed. Creighton's proximity to the Angry Young Men of the 1950s and 1960s make his extensive collection of letters and diaries of considerable historical importance."

  "text" : "Ann Leslie Brown (1943–1999) was an educational psychologist who developed methods for teaching children to be better learners. Her interest in the human memory brought Brown to focus on active memory strategies that would help enhance human memory and developmental differences in memory tasks. Her realization that children's learning difficulties often stem from an inability to use metacognitive strategies such as summarizing led to profound advances in educational psychology theory and teaching practices. Brown was born in an air raid shelter in Portsmouth, England, during World War II. She was dyslexic and did not learn to read until she was 13. Just before entering the University of London, she saw a documentary about how animals learn in their natural environments and decided to major in psychology. Brown received a PhD in psychology from the University of London for research on “Anxiety and Complex Learning Performance in Children.” She moved to the United States where she met her husband and collaborator Joseph Campione. Brown received several prestigious awards for her research and served as president of American Educational Research Association. She died at 56 on June 4, 1999 in San Francisco. She was survived by husband Joseph Campione, son Richard Campione, two brothers Peter and Michael Taylor, and granddaughter Sophia Campione. In the words of one fifth-grade student quoted by Palincsar (2003): Ann Brown—she’s really very sophisticated. She knows a lot about a lot of things.It’s no wonder people picked her to be president of AERA. She’s good at organizingand she keeps track of all our work no matter how much we do. She spends a lot oftime with kids. Yeah, that’s what I like. When she comes to school she spends timewith the kids instead of the adults. She listens to make sure that we have learned.

Chosen by the emperor Andronicus II Palaeologus as patriarch, he opposed the reunion of the Greek and Roman Churches and introduced an ecclesiastic reform that evoked opposition within the clergy. He resigned in 1293 and was restored in 1303 with popular support. The pro-Union clerical faction forced him into retirement in early 1310. He is commemorated as a saint in the Orthodox Church with his feast day observed annually on October 28."

  "text" : "Arnfinn Bergmann (14 October 1928 – 13 February 2011) was a ski jumper from Norway. He won the individual large hill event at the 1952 Olympics and 1952 Holmenkollen ski festival and placed third at the 1950 World Championships. In 1956 he was awarded the Holmenkollen medal (shared with Borghild Niskin and Arne Hoel). As a junior Bergmann won the national title and the ski jumping competition in Holmenkollen in 1948. The same year he won the national football title with SK Freidig. Next year he started competing as a senior and placed third at the national championships. In 1950 he was included to the national team and unexpectedly won a bronze medal at the world championships. For the 1950–51 season he stayed in Canada, where he won his every competition. In 1952 he returned to Norway and won the Olympic gold medal, the Holmenkollen and the national championships. He defended his national title in 1953, but got injured in early 1954 and missed the season. He qualified for the 1956 Olympics, but withdrew due to a flu. In 1958 he was included to the 1958 World Championships team, after he unexpectedly won the national title, but he withdrew again, for unknown reasons. He retired in 1959 after placing third at the national championships. In 1956 Bergmann moved from Trondheim to Oslo, and for the next 30 years worked as a school teacher in Oslo and Bærum. After that he returned to Trondheim and spent the rest of his active life on maintaining the local ski museum."

  "text" : "Alphonse Verville (October 28, 1864 – June 20, 1930) was a Canadian politician and trade unionist. Born and raised in the Côte-Saint-Paul neighbourhood of Montreal, Verville was a plumber by trade. At the age of 18 he moved to Chicago and joined the International Plumbers' Union. He returned to Montreal in 1893 and worked to organize plumbers. He became leader of the plumbers' union in Montreal and in 1904 became president of the MTLC, Montreal's Trades and Labour Council. Verville served as president of the Trades and Labour Congress of Canada from 1904 to 1910. Politically, Verville was an early advocate of the trade union movement running their own candidates for political office. He was elected to the Canadian House of Commons as a Labour candidate in a 1906 by-election in Maisonneuve, defeating a Liberal opponent, and was re-elected as a Labour MP in the 1908 and 1911 federal elections. Upon entering parliament he became a supporter of the Liberals and was often billed as a Liberal-Labour MP. In his re-election contests he was supported by the Liberals who ran no candidate of their own against him. In the 1917 federal election caused by the Conscription Crisis of 1917, Verville ran and was elected as a Laurier Liberal in the riding of St-Denis. He remained in the Commons until 1921. After nine years in retirement, he died on 20 June 1930 in Montreal, at the age of 65, following stomach surgery."

He spent 1822 to 1850 engaged in mercantile pursuits in New York City before moving to St. Augustine, Florida in 1865. An early advocate of abolitionism, Gilbert was a strong supporter of the Whig Party and, later on, the Republican Party. He was elected to represent Florida in the United States Senate as a Republican, and served from 1869 to 1875 as part of the Reconstruction effort. During that period of time, he missed 40.4% of roll call votes. Gilbert retired from business and political life after his Senate term ended while continuing to live in St. Augustine. He moved back to Gilbertsville shortly before his death in 1881. He is buried in Brookside Cemetery in Gilbertsville."

Born in Tumlingen, Artur Fischer was the son of Emil Fischer, a German chemist. His mother, who ironed collars to make ends meet, recognized her son’s mechanical aptitude and encouraged him at every turn, helping him set up a workbench at home and buying him the German equivalent of an Erector Set. In the second world war, Fischer survived the Battle of Stalingrad, leaving on the last plane, and later in the war was captured in Italy and sent to a prisoner-of-war camp in England. After returning to his hometown in 1946, he found work as an assistant at an engineering company and began making lighters and loom switches out of military scrap. In 1948, he founded his own company, the Fischer Group."

By the War of 1812 he was one of America's most well-known button makers, notably for his military uniform buttons. He lived and worked on Middle Street in Boston. His peak production years were in the early 1820s. In 1809, he married Lois Woodward in Charlestown, Massachusetts. In 1818 he was awarded a patent for a reed attachment to organs. He also invented some valuable improvements in calico printing. About 1826 or 1827 he and his family resettled in Dayton, Ohio, where he was known as a skillful engraver and die-sinker. He was the owner of Peasley & Mead, noted for their skill in working with metal and wood. In his later years he owned the first \"Pleasure Gardens\" in Dayton, on the west side of Warren street, at the south side of Seely's Basin, near the present location of the University of Dayton. He envisioned parties to be taken to the garden by boat down the canal to the basin. After a trial of two or three years, it was closed as it was an idea before its time. He died in Dayton on April 6, 1837, aged 61. His buttons for military uniforms are still sought after by collectors today."

Aurelia Plath was born in Boston, Massachusetts, the daughter of Franz (Frank) Schober of Bad Aussee, Styria, and his wife Aurelia Grünwald (Greenwood). Sylvia Plath made reference to her grandmother by making \"Esther Greenwood\" the name of the heroine in her semi-autobiographical novel The Bell Jar. The relationship between Aurelia and her daughter was a rather problematic and ambiguous one, for on the one hand they were exceptionally close to each other, and on the other hand Sylvia Plath often claimed that she hated her mother. Their relationship is portrayed in Plath's novel The Bell Jar, and in the poem Medusa. In 1975, Aurelia Plath published her daughter's letters from 1950-1963 as Letters Home. Aurelia died, aged 87, of complications from Alzheimer's disease in Needham, Massachusetts."

He was also renowned as a prodigious reader. Shirk read the entire 23-volume 1911 Encyclopædia Britannica from cover to cover in four and a half years, reading on average 3 hours per evening, and taking two to six months per volume. As of 1938 he had begun reading the 14th edition, saying he found it a \"big improvement\" over the 11th, and saying that \"most of the material had been completely rewritten\". Shirk did not limit himself to Britannica. He also read Henry Smith Williams's 24-volume Historians' History of the World, which took him two years. Among his other feats of prodigious reading were an eighteen-volume set of Dumas (read twice), a thirty-two-volume set of Balzac (twice), and a twenty-volume set of Charles Dickens (three times). Shirk had other hobbies including painting, walking the dogs and record collecting."

The song What can you do, with only one heart (Greek: Τί να σου Κάνει μια Καρδιά), with lyrics by Eftichia Papagianopoulou, marked the start of his national career."

Adrienne grew up on the Lane Cove River (part of Sydney Harbour) in Australia. After learning how to sail as a teenager, she began to race lasers and was a member of the twelve-foot skiff club. Since then Adrienne has been part of the Cheyenne crew which broke the Round the World World Speed Record in 2004; she has circumnavigated the globe on several projects, and has had four World Yachtswoman of the Year nominations. This is all with also having experience in three Volvo Ocean Races (formerly known as the Whitbread Round the World Race) prior to her race in the 2005–2006 Volvo Ocean Race. Her education was at Marist Sisters' College, Woolwich, an all girl secondary school in the suburbs of Sydney. She came and gave a speech to her old school (11 March 2015), some of her words were; \"33 years ago, I sat in those seats. When I sat there I didn't know I would leave and become a professional sailor and maritime lawyer.\" She told them what she has achieved after stepping out of those doors of high school. She told them that she has set a world record for going around the world on a yacht in less than 64 days. She said she once told her crew when they were absolutely exhausted, “If you don’t try now and we lose that world record by one second, you will never forgive yourself but if you put everything into it, then you know you’ve done what could be done to complete it.” She has been the navigator on four line honours winners in the Sydney to Hobart Yacht Race including Wild Oats."

  "text" : "Capt. Abram Kean (July 8, 1855 – May 18, 1945) was a controversial sealing captain and politician from Flowers Island, Newfoundland and Labrador. He was famous for his success in sealing, with capturing over a million pelts, and infamous for his role in sending 78 men to their deaths in the 1914 Newfoundland Sealing Disaster. He embarked upon a career in the Newfoundland cod fishery at the age of 18 but quickly shifted his interests to the seal fishery in which he spent the vast majority of his marine career. Kean was a very relevant part of The Commission of Enquiry report regarding the 1914 Sealing Disaster, which was submitted on February 27, 1915 to Hon. Justice Johnson in St. John's, Newfoundland. In 1917, he was named skipper of the Royal Naval Reserve in St. John's by the British Emperor. In the 1920s and 1930s, he ran in the Newfoundland general elections. Once elected he was subsequently appointed to the upper house of Newfoundland, which played a similar role as the Canadian Senate."

In 1972, he obtained a degree in Political Science and International Relations from the Catholic University of Louvain, Belgium. He continued his education at the Paris Institute of Political Studies in Paris, graduating in 1974. Safieh became president of the Belgian section of the General Union of Palestinian Students from 1969 until 1971, then President of the French branch in 1974-1975. From 1976 to 1978 he served as deputy director of the Palestine Liberation Organization Observer Mission to the United Nations Office at Geneva. In 1978 he worked as a staff member in Yasser Arafat's office in Beirut, in charge of European Affairs and UN institutions. In 1981, he became a researcher at the Centre for European Studies in the Catholic University of Louvain, and from 1985 to 1987 was invited as visiting scholar at the Centre for International Affairs, Harvard University. From 1987 until 1990, Safieh served as PLO representative to the Netherlands. During his service, he was involved in the 1988 Stockholm negotiations that led to the first official and direct American-Palestinian dialogue. In 1990, he became Palestinian General Delegate to the United Kingdom. In January 1995, he was invited to join the International Board of Trustees of the Vatican-sponsored Bethlehem University.

He only served in Washington for two and a half years, having lectured students and US citizens from the west coast to the east coast about the Palestinian struggle at a wide range of universities and institutes. In May 2008, Afif Safieh was appointed to serve as the Palestinian ambassador to the Russian Federation, he presented his letter of credentials to President Medvedev on September 18, 2008. It was reported in March 2009 that he had been dismissed from this post by Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas, apparently because he had spoken at a rally organised by Hamas to protest against the Israeli attack on Gaza. Afif Safieh was nominated in June 2009 as Palestinian Roving Ambassador for Special Missions, based in London. During the Fateh sixth national conference held in Bethlehem, August 2009, Ambassador Safieh was elected to the Fateh Revolutionary Council - the parliament of the Fateh movement. In October 2009, Safieh was invited by the Commissioner for International Relations for the Fateh movement Dr Nabil Sha'ath to be Deputy Commissioner for International Relations. Afif Safieh is considered the most experienced and skilled Palestinian diplomat having served in the three most politically significant capitals: London, Washington, and Moscow.He is married to Christ'l Leclercq and has two daughters: Diana and Randa."

  "text" : "Alexander William Roberts (4 December 1857–27 January 1938) was Scottish-born, South African teacher and an amateur astronomer. He was born in Farr, which lies in the county of Sutherland, Scotland. As a youth he developed an interest in astronomy, but was dissuaded from a career by Charles Piazzi Smyth, the Astronomer Royal for Scotland. From 1877 until 1881 he served as an assistant teacher at the North School, in Wick, Scotland. He emigrated to South Africa in 1883, where he took a teaching position at the Lovedale Missionary Institution. (He would later serve as acting Principal at the institute, then Principal at Lovedale Training School.) The following year he was married to Elizabeth Dunnett. The couple would have three children. In 1894 he received a F.R.A.S., then a F.R.S.E. in 1898. He was awarded a Doctor of Science from the University of the Cape of Good Hope in 1899. In South Africa he pursued his interest in astronomy, first measuring the parallax and proper motion of Alpha Centauri and Beta Centauri. He then became a prolific observer of variable stars, particularly those that were members of a binary system. He continued his observations for over thirty years, and pioneered the study of close binary systems. He published over 100 works on these topics. Between 1891 and 1920 he made over 250,000 observations of 98 variable stars. In 1913 he served as president of the S.A.A.A.S. Much of his work was communicated through Edward C. Pickering, the director of the Harvard College Observatory. However, with the death of Pickering in 1919 he ceased further research. Instead he began to focus on politics and race relations in South Africa. The Prime Minister Jan Smuts appointed him as a senator to represent the interests of native Africans on the Native Affairs Commission. Later in 1925, however, he did serve as the South African delegate to the I.A.U. generalassembly. The crater Roberts on the Moon is co-named for him and Sir Isaac Roberts."

  "text" : "Andy Davidson is the creator of the original Worms computer game by Team17, the company who also released Alien Breed and Alien Breed 2, Assassin, Project-X, Superfrog and Body Blows. The game \"Worms\" is based on the 2D classic \"Artillery\", and originally did not feature worms, but the \"Lemmings\" from the popular game of the same name. Andy was working on a program called \"Jack the Ripper\" for the Amiga personal computer, which allowed him to trawl the residual contents of RAM after applications had been run and quit. In this way, he \"ripped\" the graphics from Lemmings, and used them while developing his version of \"Artillery\". The original name of the game was Lemartillery, and it was created purely as a bit of fun for him and his school friends in 1993. The positive reaction he witnessed encouraged him to develop it further. Knowing he could never commercially release the \"Lemmings\" characters, he changed them for worms and changed the name of the game to Total Wormage. Andy entered the game into a publishing competition run by popular magazine Amiga Format but was unsuccessful. Undeterred, Andy took his then incomplete game to the European Computer Trade Show in London in September, 1994, where he introduced it to Team17 Producer Martyn Brown who offered to help develop and publish it. Andy, often described by his co-workers as 'a bit mad' left Team17 after (or around) the release of Worms Armageddon, and told fans that he was working on a new, 3D game unrelated to the Worms series (although supposedly containing many Worms references and in-jokes), but this has not yet materialised. On April 5th, 2007, Andy opened an \"ibar\" in Bournemouth, Dorset. On April 2nd, 2012, Team17 announced that Andy had returned to the company."

  "text" : "Alfred Lemmnitz (27 June 1905 – 23 September 1994) was East Germany's National Education Minister. Lemmnitz was born in Taucha, Saxony and completed training as a typesetter and studies in economics at the University of Leipzig. From 1927 to 1931, he was a member of the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD) and youth leader of the Socialist Worker Youth in Moers. In 1931, he switched to the Communist Party of Germany (KPD) and joined the Communist Youth League of Germany (Kommunistischer Jugendverband Deutschlands; KJVD), becoming leader of the KJVD subdistrict of Duisburg-Hamborn. In 1933, after the Nazis had seized power, he was working illegally for the KPD and ended up in \"protective custody\" many times. From October 1933 until 1936, he was at Börgermoor and Esterwegen concentration camps, and until 1937 in pre-trial custody in Duisburg. He was sentenced by the Volksgerichtshof to one year and nine months in prison, released from custody, and banished from the Ruhr area. In April, Lemmnitz emigrated to the Netherlands, where he became a member of the KPD leadership in Amsterdam. After the Wehrmacht marched into the Netherlands, he was once again arrested and then sentenced by the Volksgerichtshof to ten years in labour prison (Zuchthaus). Until 1945, he was an inmate at the labour prison in Brandenburg-Görden. In 1946, Lemmnitz joined the Socialist Unity Party of Germany (SED), took his studies up once again, graduating from the University of Leipzig in 1948. From 1948 to 1953, he held the chair for political economy at the Party College, and then until 1955, he was Professor of Political Economy and Dean of the Faculty of Economics at the University of Rostock. Until 1956, he was Rector of the College for Financial Science in Potsdam-Babelsberg, and until 1958, he held the same position at the Berlin College for Economics. In 1958, he succeeded Fritz Lange as Minister for National Education, thereby also becoming a member of the Council of Ministers of the GDR and the Ideological Commission at the SED Central Committee's Politburo. From 1963 to 1965, he was a scientific associate at the Economic Institute of the Academy of Sciences, until 1971, Acting Director of the German Economic Institute, and finally Associate of the Institute for International Politics and Science. Lemmnitz received in 1958 the Medal for Fighters against Fascism, in 1959 the National Prize of East Germany, in 1959 and 1970, the Fatherland Order of Merit, in 1975 the Clasp of Honour on the Patriotic Order of Merit, in 1980 the Order of Karl Marx, and in 1985 the Star of People's Friendship."

He was an associate king, raised on the shield by the warriors at his father's request, when still young. Upon becoming sole king as a teen, he reigned under his mother as regent. Adaloald went insane and lost the support of the nobles. He was deposed in 626 by Arioald, a Lombard noble from Turin and husband of the king's sister Gundeberga, who was hostile to the Catholic Church. Adaloald died mysteriously in Ravenna shortly after (628)."

Kazbegi was the great grandson of Kazibek Chopikashvili, a local feudal magnate who was in charge of collecting tolls on the Georgian Military Highway. Alexander Kazbegi studied in Tblisi, Saint Petersburg and Moscow, but on returning home, decided to become a shepherd to experience the lives of the local people. He later worked as a journalist, and then became a novelist and playwright. In his later life, he suffered from insanity. After his death in Tbilisi, his coffin was carried across the Jvari Pass to his hometown of Kazbegi (now renamed Stepantsminda), which also preserves his childhood home as a museum in his honor. His most famous work, the novel The Patricide is about a heroic Caucasian bandit named Koba, who, much like Robin Hood, is a defender of the poor. Koba has nothing but contempt for authority, a proclivity towards violence, and a firm belief in vengeance. Kazbegi's work was a major inspiration to Iosif Jughashvili, later known as Joseph Stalin, who used Koba as a revolutionary pseudonym."

He was Second Secretary (deputy leader) to Leningrad CPSU gorkom (city committee) and obkom (oblast committee), and, during the Siege of Leningrad, helped organize the city's defense. For his work during the siege, he was promoted to First Secretary in 1945. Zhdanov was thought to want Kuznetsov to replace him as CC Party Chairman. Kuznetsov was also believed to be a possible replacement for Stalin on the latter's death. He was a strong supporter of Stalin, who appointed him to head the security functions of the party, showing how much the Soviet leader trusted him. The beginning of Kuznetsov’s fall came when Stalin demoted him and returned him to a minor post in Leningrad (a frequent sign that the subject was destined for a final fall). This may have been because Kuznetsov had been digging into Kirov's death - suspicion of Stalin’s involvement in this murder has never been put to rest. Eventually Kuznetsov was arrested, tried and sentenced to death in a secret trial during the Leningrad Affair. He was executed in 1950. His death consolidated the power of Malenkov, Beria and Bulganin – with the inference that they may have been involved in the charges – fabricated or not. He was rehabilitated posthumously."

  "text" : "Aleksander Wojtkiewicz (Latvian: Aleksandrs Voitkevičs; January 15, 1963 – July 14, 2006) was a Polish chess grandmaster. He was born in Latvia. In his early teens he was already a strong player; a student of ex-world champion Mikhail Tal whom he assisted in the 1979 Interzonal tournament in Riga. He won the Latvian Chess Championship in 1981. His promising chess career was interrupted when he refused to join the Soviet Army. For several years he went undercover but in 1986 he was sentenced to two years in prison. After one year he received an amnesty after the meeting of Presidents Ronald Reagan and Mikhail Gorbachev. Following his release he moved from Riga to Warsaw where he won two Polish Chess Championships. He played for Poland in the Chess Olympiads of 1990 and 1992. He later resided in the United States, whereupon he became one of the most active players on the tournament circuit, constantly flying around the world. Several times he won the annual $10,000 first prize for Grand Prix chess tournaments in the United States. Wojtkiewicz played in the FIDE World Chess Championship 2004. In his final months, he tied for first at the 2006 World Open in Philadelphia and won the 2006 National Open in Las Vegas. He died on the evening of 14 July 2006 from a perforated intestine and massive bleeding. Wojtkiewicz's strategies have been investigated in the online series \"How Wojo Won\" by chess master Jonathan Hilton. The six-part series began in December 2006 and continued until April 2008. Hilton has also co-authored a book, Wojo's Weapons: Winning with White, Volume I, focusing on Wojtkiewicz's opening play."

  "text" : "Arthur Charles Gook (11 June 1883–1959) in London, England is primarily known today for having translated Reverend Hallgrímur Pétursson's Passion Hymns into English. The third of five sons, Arthur Gook's father was a teacher. Gook distinguished himself as a student and won a university scholarship. His father, having taken up a new profession as an estate agent, would not allow him to attend a university. Instead, Gook was made to work in the family business. Later, he became personal secretary to a London publisher, and it was there he trained for the literary and publishing work he undertook later in life. Arther Gook was converted in a Bible class, and the Bible became his favourite book. He determined to reform his life and joined with the Open Brethren, which was a branch of the Plymouth Brethren religious sect."

Of the eight candidates in the 2006 election, Arto Lahti was the last who entered as a candidate. This is mostly because he was the only candidate not affiliated with any party, so he had to gather 20,000 supporter cards to be qualified. Lahti finished last out of the eight candidates in the first round of the election on January 15, getting a vote share of 0.4% (12,989 votes).

He became one of the Europeans to see the fabled Okapi, and the Bongo, a brown Lyre horned antelope with white stripes. He was an enthusiastic amateur radio operator, his callsign in the Belgian Congo was OQ5ZZ, and tried to operate from the Congo deep inland regions. He knew the Pygmy peoples of the Congo Regions very well. He wrote many books on his expeditions, including Killers All!, The New Africa, Here is Africa, Saranga the Pygmy, Africa is Adventure, Kamanda the African Boy, Great Mother Forest, Mediterranean Spotlights, Here is the Veld, Tom Toms in the Night, and South of the Sahara, (Robert McBride & Company 1945). Gatti's books contain invaluable anthropological material from his descriptions of the native peoples he met. Gatti also took good photos of Pygmys and Watussi. He met an important female python shaman. He became experienced with African magic and an entire world that no longer exists."

In the 1970s he criticized the Soviet political system, sacrificing his high academic station in Moscow. Eventually Zinoviev faced exile in 1978, after his novels Yawning Heights and The Radiant Future were published in Europe. He continued to develop his socio-philosophical ideas in subsequent publications, at times employing his original genre of the sociological novel. After the Collapse of the Soviet Union, Zinovyev wrote a book A Russian Tragedy (Русская Трагедия) about the USSR's collapse, calling it a catastrophe. In his later life, he championed the Soviet system and regarded post-Soviet Russia with disdain. He considered Stalin as one of the greatest personalities in history."

  "text" : "Abraham Cohen de Herrera (Hebrew: רבי אברהם כהן בן דוד דה-הירירה), also known as Alonso Nunez de Herrera or Abraham Irira (c. 1570 – c. 1635), was a religious philosopher and cabbalist. He is supposed by the historian Heinrich Graetz to have been born in 1570. He is widely supposed to have been descended from a Marrano family: place of birth is unknown but may (according to Barbosa Machado the biographer) have been Lisbon, Portugal. Other sources link him to Italy, specifically Tuscany, and as the son of the last Chief Rabbi of Córdoba in Spain. He is known to have married a Sara de Herrera in Amsterdam in 1600; however, it is unlikely that this is the wife's original surname. It is also reasonably certain that he had an uncle, Juan de Marchena, who worked as a factor for the Sultan of Morocco Moulay, Ahmad al-Mansur. While in Cadiz on the Sultan's business, Herrera is supposed to have been captured by the English, was released again after an exchange of diplomatic correspondence between the Sultan and Queen Elizabeth I, and travelled thereafter to Amsterdam, where he returned to Judaism. His date of death is between 1635 and 1639: Wiener believes it was 1635. According to Rodriguez de Castro he may have died in Vienna. He wrote several works, originally in Spanish but later (in accordance with his will) translated to Hebrew."

Dwyer married Harold Russell in 1893 but entered a lifelong separation a few years after their marriage. The couple never sought divorce. In 1909 Russell met writer Amy Lowell. The two entered into long-term lesbian relationship, or a \"Boston marriage\" (the term for a 19th-century romantic female relationship) beginning in 1912, which would last until Lowell's death in 1925. Russell was the subject of many of Lowell's explicit poems, such as the Taxi. Russell was also the executrix of Amy Lowell's will, and burned all her items upon request. In The Taxi, Lowell conveys a strong sense of her separation from Russell and her pain. Collected in Sword Blades and Poppy Seed (published in September 1914), The Taxi serves as an excellent example of Amy Lowell's \"polyphonic prose\", in which she experimented with different \"rhythmic units\". Lowell left her fortune in a trust to Ada Russell."

  "text" : "Arch Oboler (December 7, 1909 – March 19, 1987) was an American playwright, screenwriter, novelist, producer, and director who was active in radio, films, theater, and television. He generated much attention with his radio scripts, particularly the horror series Lights Out, and his work in radio remains the outstanding period of his career. Praised as one of broadcasting's top talents, he is regarded today as a key innovator of radio drama. Oboler's personality and ego were larger than life. Radio historian John Dunning wrote, \"Few people were ambivalent when it came to Arch Oboler. He was one of those intense personalities who are liked and disliked with equal fire.\""

  "text" : "Angelos Messaris (1910-1978) was a Greek footballer. He played for Panathinaikos and he is widely regarded as the best Greek player of the pre-war era. This is probably also due to the myth that for decades followed his sudden and mysterious early leaving from football. He made his last appearance in the football field on 23 April 1931 at the age of 21, in a match against AEK Athens. Panathinaikos were losing 2-0 but Messaris tied the score with two reverse headers and he received great cheering. That was his last appearance. He never played football again. Messaris was descended from people of Kefalonia, an island in the Ionian sea, but he was born in Cape Town of South Africa in 1910. In 1924, he came to Athens and after spending three years at the team of Goudi he was transferred to Panathinaikos. His dribbling skills, his perfect control together with his versatile mind and hard work in the football field elevated him to the top. During his short football career he scored 53 goals: 23 in the Athens FCA Championship, 11 in the Panhellenic Championship, 2 with the Greece national team (he played four times) and 17 in international and friendly games of Panathinaikos and the mixed team of Athens. He was first scorer in the 1929-30 season with 7 goals. At the legendary victory over Olympiakos with 8-2 he scored the first three goals and actually served three more. Another famous victory was that over Aris with 4-1 in Thessaloniki which called forth the following chant: \"We scored eight against Olympiakos and four more against Aris - hooray Angelos Messaris!\" After giving up football, Messaris concentrated on his studies at the National Technical University of Athens. Then he returned to South Africa where he concluded his studies and following this he came back to Greece where he became an executive manager at the Doxiadis enterprises. It is said that the reason why he left Panathinaikos rests on the unbearable pressure Apostolos Nikolaidis was putting on him in order to persuade him to commit himself to football and forget about his studies at NTUA. In a short telephone talk that he had with journalist Dimitris Liberopoulos back in 1973 Messaris said: \"Please leave me alone... The football player you are asking for died in 1931\". He died in 1978 and his funeral was attended by thousands of people."

He was born in Băilești, Oltenia, and attended the Carol I High School. He later played at the Craiova Theatre, then at the Small Theatre, Nottara Theatre, Comedy Theatre and the National Theatre Bucharest, being also a professor at the Academy of Theatre and Film in Bucharest. Pellea played numerous comic and serious roles. In the cinema was most noted for his roles as historical leaders. His earliest leading roles were as Romanian national heroes, beginning with Decebalus in Dacii (1967) and Columna (1968). He also portrayed Michael the Brave in Mihai Viteazul (1971). His most famous comic role was as \"Nea Mărin\" (Uncle Marin), a character representing the archetypal Oltenian peasant. Mărin first appeared in TV comedy sketches. The character graduated to the cinema in Nea Mărin miliardar (Uncle Marin, the Billionaire), in which Pellea played the dual role of the naive Marin and the American billionaire he is mistaken for. Nea Mărin miliardar is ranked 1 in the top most viewed Romanian films of all time. He played other historical figures such as Vladică Hariton in Tudor din Vladimiri and Voivode Basarab in Croitorii cei mari din Valahia. He also appeared in Răscoala and Haiducii. In 1977 he won the award for Best Actor at the 10th Moscow International Film Festival for his role in The Doom. He is buried at Bellu Cemetery. In a 2006 poll conducted by Romanian Television to identify the \"greatest Romanians of all time\", Pellea came in 58th."

  "text" : "Alistair Cameron Crombie (4 November 1915 – 9 February 1996) was an Australian historian of science who began his career as a zoologist. He was noted for his contributions to research on competition between species before turning to history. Born in Brisbane, Australia, Crombie was educated at the Church of England Grammar School and Geelong Grammar School. He then undertook tertiary study in Science at the University of Melbourne, where he was a resident from 1935 at Trinity College. During his studies in Melbourne, he won the First Brunning Prize in Botany Part I (1935) and the Exhibition in Zoology Part III (1937). Crombie undertook postgraduate study at Jesus College, the University of Cambridge, receiving his doctorate in 1942 in the area of population dynamics. He married Nancy Hey in 1943 and had five children. He undertook research at the Cambridge Zoological Laboratory for the British Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries from 1941 until his appointment as lecturer at University College London in 1946. Involved in the establishment of the British Society for the History of Science in 1947 (President from 1964 to 1968), he was an early editor of their British Journal for the Philosophy of Science. Following publication in 1952 of his textbook Augustine to Galileo: The History of Science A.D. 400–1650, in 1953 Crombie was selected to establish the teaching of History of Science subjects at Oxford, and after a year as Visiting Professor at the University of Washington, Seattle, he took up his lectureship at Oxford in 1954. During Crombie's tenure at Oxford, the history of science was added to the graduate level offerings of Oxford's history faculty. He was one of the founders of the review journal History of Science in 1962, and was awarded the Galileo Prize by the Domus Galileana in Pisa in 1964. Crombie served as President of the Académie Internationale d’Histoire des Sciences from 1968 to 1971. He became a Fellow at Trinity College, Oxford, in 1969, but was passed over for the Chair in History of Science when it was created at Oxford in 1971. He retired in 1983 and took up a half-time appointment as Kennedy Professor in the Renaissance at Smith College, Massachusetts, and was Professor of History of Science and Medicine there from 1983 to 1985. He also held many visiting professorships in France, Germany and Japan. He was made a Senior Fellow of the British Academy in 1990 and was also made a member of the Pontifical Academy of Sciences (1994) and the Academia Leopoldina in Halle, Germany. He received the Forschungspreis (Research Award) of the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation, honorary doctorates from Durham (1978), Paris, X-Nanterre and Sassari, and the European Premio Dondi (1995). During his career as a historian of science, Crombie identified thematic threads or \"styles\" in the development of European approaches to science. He published his ideas in 1994 in a definitive 3-volume work, entitled, Styles of Scientific Thinking in the European Tradition: The History of Argument and Explanation especially in the Mathematical and Biomedical Sciences and Arts. The main argument about six distinct styles of scientific thinking in the history of Western science was also published in the brief 1995 article Commitments and styles of European scientific thinking. During his tenure he supervised several students, including Robert Fox (Professor of the History of Science, Oxford University), David M Knight (Professor of the History and Philosophy of Science, Durham University); German E Berrios (Professor of the Epistemology of Psychiatry, University of Cambridge) and Trevor Levere (Professor of the History of Science, University of Toronto)."

  "text" : "Abram Moiseyevich Deborin (Joffe) (Russian: Абра́м Моисе́евич Дебо́рин Ио́ффе; June 16 [O.S. June 4] 1881 – March 8, 1963) was a Soviet Marxist philosopher and academician of the Soviet Academy of Sciences (1929). Entering the revolutionary movement by the end of the 1890s, Deborin joined the Bolshevik faction of the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party in 1903. By 1907, however, he switched to the Menshevik faction and became known as one of Georgi Plekhanov's disciples, both in politics and philosophy. In 1908, Deborin graduated from the philosophy department at Bern University (L. I. Akselrod had received her doctorate there in 1900). He soon began publishing major books and articles on philosophy from a Marxist perspective. Soon after the October Revolution of 1917, Deborin left the Mensheviks and began lecturing at the Sverdlov University, the Institute of Red Professors and the Institute of Philosophy. He soon assumed editorial duties at the journal, \"Under the Banner of Marxism,\" which he headed from 1926-1931. Following the 1917 October Revolution, Soviet philosophy found itself divided itself between two factions: the \"dialecticians,\" headed up by Deborin, and \"mechanists,\" whose leading figure was the philosopher Lyubov Akselrod (the then prominent Bolshevik leader Bukharin was seen as an ally of the \"mechanists,\" although he did not entirely agree with them). In 1931, Joseph Stalin decided the issue of the debate between dialecticians and mechanists by publishing a decree which identified dialectical materialism as pertaining solely to Marxism-Leninism. He then codified it in Dialectical and Historical Materialism (1938) by enumerating the \"laws of dialectics\", which are the grounds of particular disciplines and in particular of the science of history, and which guarantees their conformity to the \"proletarian conception of the world\". Thus, diamat was imposed on most Communist parties affiliated to the Third International. Diamat became the official philosophy of the Soviet Union and remained as such until its dissolution. When Stalin decided in favor of dialectical materialism, Deborin made a show of support for Stalin's position. For some years afterwards, Deborin kept a low profile, and most of his writings were suppressed. However, he lived long enough to see all of his works republished in the Soviet Union during the \"thaw\" under Nikita Khrushchev."

  "text" : "August von der Heydt (15 February 1801 – 13 June 1874) was an influential German economist. Von der Heydt was born in Elberfeld in the Duchy of Berg. During the Revolution of 1848 he was appointed as Minister to the newly created Ministry of Commerce and Industry in the Kingdom of Prussia, serving during the reigns of kings Frederick William IV and William I. He helped increase circulation of money at the rate of 12.5%/year. He was responsible for the railways in Prussia and organized new railroad construction and purchased private ones. He reformed the old mining laws, by lowering the tax on the mining industry, ending state supervision, and eliminated the privileges of the miners guild. He also allowed government to be less restrictive of its attitude toward the formation of banks. The formation of many new banks revolutionized Germany by supplying a lot of much needed capital. In 1862 he resigned his position, but he took it back from 1866-67 to help finance the Austro-Prussian War. Von der Heydt died in Berlin. He is also the great grandfather of the banker, art collector, and patron Eduard von der Heydt."

Ashok Chandwani taught briefly at St Francis de Sales College, in Nagpur as a lecturer for English Literature at the B.A. undergraduate study program level in 1972, when he must have been about twenty two years of age, barely a little older than some of his students. He is remembered as an affable and competent teacher who was well regarded for his interesting and slightly non-conventional methodologies for teaching classic English poetry in his inimitable style. Ashok Chandwani immigrated to Canada from India in 1973 and in 1979, began working at The Montreal Gazette. He wrote a weekly Monday column for the newspaper based on his experiences as an immigrant. Ashok Chandwani was also an assistant management editor and restaurant critic. In 2002 he bought his own restaurant. Ashok Chandwani won several journalism awards, including a Media Human Rights Award with Glen Allen for a series on racism in Canada in 1982, and is the author of the book Buntys and Pinkies."

  "text" : "Allan Beswick (born 8 October 1948) is a radio broadcaster who used to present the breakfast show on BBC Radio Manchester in Manchester. He now presents the late night phone in on BBC Radio Manchester and BBC Radio Lancashire.Prior to becoming a radio presenter, Beswick worked as a soldier, a bus driver and a mental health nurse and for the Citizen's Advice Bureau; during his time at the C.A.B. he began to appear as a guest on Dave Lincoln and Friends, a programme on Radio City 194m MW (1548 kHz) and 96.7MHz VHF / FM, an independent commercial station in Liverpool. In the mid to late eighties, he worked for Lancashire station Red Rose Radio [ 97.3MHz later 97.4MHz FM and 301m MW (999 kHz) ] where he initially presented an afternoon show which won him a Sony national radio award. He then presented a late-night phone-in The Allan Beswick Late Night Show. which drew listeners and controversy in nearly equal measure. His listening figures for this late night slot often drew audiences equal to those of many radio stations breakfast shows. The overall 'audience reach' of the programme drew in the region of 100,000 listeners per night, but a total listenership across the North West, West Yorkshire and North Wales often approached 500,000 listeners. He was well known for his straight-talking, uncompromising style, ability to argue his case stubbornly, and penchant for insulting callers with whom he disagreed or didn't like. He was also known for his on-air professed dislike of Liverpudlians (\"scousers\"), which perversely made him extremely popular with Liverpool listeners, as they felt he typified woollybacks - people from outside the city - and all that was wrong with them. He has since said it was an act and he has no problem with Merseysiders. Other groups to incur his ire were train spotters. Callers were met usually with the introduction of 'How do'. The show ran from 10pm-2am Monday through Friday, with the first hour usually having music content, which turned virtually exclusively to talk after the 11pm news. The show 'or programme' as he referred to it, drew comparisons with similar late night northern based late night phone in shows with James Whale at Red Rose Radio's sister station Radio Aire in Leeds, James H Reeve and James Stannage at Piccadilly Radio in Manchester on 261m MW and 97.0MHz FM later 103.0MHz FM (Key 103). During the Red Rose era Allan released, in limited quantities, 2 'Best of' cassettes and one 7\" single record. 'Beswick's Big Blue Cassette', which featured some of the funniest callers to the programme on 01772 561000. During his time at Red Rose Radio, Beswick also hosted a Sunday morning call in game show called 'It's Your Turn.' His assistant was credited as Wobbly Warren. Allan occasionally took his show to live venues throughout the Red Rose area, mainly in Lancashire and on Merseyside. He recorded Jehovah's Witness At The Door for the double CD 'Guide Cats For The Blind' (songs and poems of Les Barker) in 2008 An on-air incident led to his being banned for a period by the Independent Broadcasting Authority for being abusive to a caller. Red Rose held a ballot to see if he should be re-instated, which he subsequently was. This second coming lasted about a year. He soon moved to BBC Radio Manchester where he presented a lunchtime show, the morning show and later the breakfast show, moving back to his familiar late night spot in early 2015. In April 2007 a humorous comment Beswick made about the death of Alan Ball on a lunchtime broadcast drew complaints, resulting in an apology both from the BBC and Beswick himself. Beswick has also worked on Radio 5 live, presenting late night sporadically in the early part of the last decade, and on television, including a slot as presenter of \"Beswick's Beat\", a local current affairs segment on North West Tonight. On 2 February 2015 Allan took over the networked late show on both BBC Radio Manchester and BBC Radio Lancashire. The show is mainly a phone in with one or two music tracks at the beginning of the first hour."

He lived his entire life in the town of Tarim in Yemen’s Valley of Hadramawt and died there in 1720 CE (1132 Hijri). In Islamic history, he was considered one of the great Sufi sages. He was an adherent to the Ashari Sunni Creed of Faith (Aqeedah), while in Islamic jurisprudence (Fiqh), he was a Shafi'i. In spite of being a major source of reference among the Sunni Muslims (especially among Sufis), only recently have his books began to receive attention and publication in the English-speaking world. Their appeal lies in the concise way in which the essential pillars of Islamic belief, practice, and spirituality have been streamlined and explained efficiently enough for the modern reader. Examples of such works are The Book of Assistance, The Lives of Man, and Knowledge and Wisdom."

  "text" : "Alfred John Barnes PC (1887 – 26 November 1974) was a British Labour Co-operative politician. Born in North Woolwich, he was the youngest child of William Barnes, a docker. Barnes lost a leg in a fairground accident at the age of 8. He was educated at the Northampton Institute and the Central School of Arts and Crafts. Barnes worked originally as an artist in gold and silver. He was an early member of the Independent Labour Party and was heavily involved in the co-operative movement. He was chairman of the London Co-operative Society for nine years until 1923 and was a founder of the Co-operative Party. He became the Party's chairman in 1924 and served until 1945. He was also a director and President of the National Cooperative Publishing Society. In November 1922, Barnes was elected as the Member of Parliament (MP) for East Ham South. In 1925 he was appointed a Labour Whip and served as a whip in Government, as Junior Lord of the Treasury. However, he was forced to resign in October 1930 - although his position as a director of the National Cooperative Publishing Society was unpaid, parliamentary rules dictated that a minister cannot be a director of a public company (although they could be of a private company): Barnes chose to remain on the co-op board rather than as a whip. Like many Labour MPs, he lost his seat in the 1931 general election but regained it in 1935. In 1945, Barnes was made a Privy Counsellor and Minister of War Transport, later Minister of Transport, serving until the fall of the Labour government in 1951. He stood down as a Member of Parliament at the 1955 general election."

  "text" : "Adriano Tilgher (born 1 October 1947 in Taranto) is an Italian far right politician. Tilgher began his career as a member of the Italian Social Movement, although in his youth he was also associated with the extremist National Vanguard, and attempted to refound it in 1970. He was given a prison sentence for what was judged an attempt to refound the Fascist Party. In 1987 he founded the Lega Nazionalpopolare, later rebranded as Alternativa Nazional Popolare. Both movements proved short-lived and lacking in support. After giving up on the idea of leading his own movement he joined radical Fiamma Tricolore (a splinter group of the newly constituted National Alliance) in 1996. He was, however, expelled from Fiamma Tricolore in 1997 for his criticism of the leadership of Pino Rauti and in September of that year he set up his own party, Fronte Nazionale, initially in imitation of the Front National, whose leader Jean-Marie Le Pen Tilgher invited to Rome during the elections of that year. The party changed its name to Fronte Sociale Nazionale and was part of Alessandra Mussolini's Alternativa Sociale coalition until that group dissolved after a poor showing in the 2006 general election. He subsequently formed an alliance with The Right in 2008. Tilgher has been associated with Stefano Delle Chiaie and 1994 co-authored a book with him entitled Un meccanismo diabolico: Stragi Servizi segreti Magistrati. The book dealt with what the authors claimed has been their victimisation by the Italian legal system."

He was born at Tordarroch House, Pitlochry, Scotland around 1740 and came to Staten Island, New York around 1770. He joined the Queen's Rangers at the start of the American Revolution, later becoming a captain. After the British surrender at Yorktown, Virginia, he settled in the Nashwaak River area of New Brunswick. He rejoined the re-formed Queen's Rangers and moved to Kingston in Upper Canada in 1792. When he was appointed to the Executive Council and Legislative Council of Upper Canada in 1794, he moved to Niagara. In 1793, he helped prepare the site for the new capital at York (Toronto). In 1796, he was appointed lieutenant for the county of York. In 1811, as tensions heightened with the United States, Shaw became a major-general in the militia responsible for training. However, the legislation only required recruits to train for three days a month. Shaw's troops did not perform well during the first capture of York during the War of 1812. He died at York in 1814. Shaw's daughter, Sophia, is said to have been engaged to Major-General Sir Isaac Brock, who died at the Battle of Queenston Heights in 1812."

After assuming power he called for new elections and opposed the candidacies of members of the Muslim Brotherhood, against whom he had declared a fatwa.Mahir then declared war against the Axis Powers in World War II, primarily to gain a diplomatic advantage at the end of the war (which was seen as imminent). Immediately after his announcement, Mahir was assassinated at parliament by 28-year-old Mahmoud Elessawy. Although it was assumed that Essawy was a member of the Muslim Brotherhood, he later confessed that he was actually a member of the Wafd Party instead. Ahmed Mahir Pasha was the grandfather of Ahmed Mahir, Egypt's Foreign Minister from 2001 to 2004, as well as Ambassador Ali Mahir."

His elegy \"Tears of Khorasan\", translated into English in 1789, is considered to be one of the most beautiful poems in Persian literature. The Cambridge History of Iran calls Anvari \"one of the greatest figures in Persian literature\". Despite their beauty, his poems often required much help with interpretation, as they were often complex and difficult to understand. Anvari's panegyric in honour of the Seljuk sultan Sultan Sanjar (1117–1157), ruler of Khorasan, won him royal favour, and allowed him to go on to enjoy the patronage of two of Sanjar's successors. However, when his prophecy of disasters in October 1185 failed, he fell out of favour with the kingship, and was forced into a life of scholarly service, eventually taking his own life in 1189."

  "text" : "Aripert II (also spelled Aribert) was the king of the Lombards from 701 to 712. Duke of Turin and son of King Raginpert, and thus a scion of the Bavarian Dynasty, he was associated with the throne as early as 700. He was removed by Liutpert, who reigned from 700 to 702, with the exception of the year 701, when Raginpert seized the throne. After his father's death, he tried to take the throne, too. He defeated Liutpert and the regent Ansprand's men at Pavia and captured the king, whom he later had strangled in his bath. He seized the capital and forced Ansprand over the Alps. He was firmly in power by 703. He thence reigned uninterrupted until his death. His reign was a troubled one. In 703, Faroald, duke of Spoleto, attacked the Exarchate of Ravenna, but Aripert refused to assist him, for he wanted good relations with papacy and empire. He tried nevertheless to assert his authority over Spoleto and Benevento in the Mezzogiorno. He nursed friendship with Pope John VI by donating vast tracts of land in the Cottian Alps to the Holy See. This friendship helped him little, for he had many rebellions to deal with and many Slovene raids into Venetia. In 711, Ansprand, whom he had exiled, returned with a large army from the duke of Bavaria, Theudebert. Many Austrians (the men of Venetia and the east) joined the returning regent and battle was joined by Pavia. Aripert fled to his capital when the tide went against him, but he hoarded the treasures and tried to cross over into Gaul by night. He drowned in the River Ticino and Ansprand was acclaimed sovereign. He was the last Bavarian to wear the Iron Crown."

  "text" : "August Johann Gottfried Bielenstein (Latvian: Augusts Bīlenšteins) (March 4, 1826 – July 6, 1907) was a Baltic German linguist, folklorist, ethnographer, and theologian. Bielenstein was born in Mitau (Jelgava), where he also died. He studied at the University of Halle (in Prussian Saxony) like numerous prominent pastors in the Baltic region, and received a doctorate in theology from the University of Dorpat in 1850. He was granted an honorary doctorate from the University of Königsberg in 1883. The editor of the major Latvian language newspaper Latviešu Avīzes and a member of the St. Petersburg Academy of Sciences, Bielenstein was the author of numerous major works on linguistics and ethnography, including Die lettische Sprache, nach ihren Lauten und Formen (The Latvian Language, Its Phonetics and Forms, 2 volumes, 1863–64) and Die Grenzen des lettischen Volksstammes und der lettischen Sprache in der Gegenwart und im 13. Jahrhundert (The Borders of the Latvian Tribes and the Latvian Language in the Present and in the 13th Century, 1892). He encouraged the collection of dainas, studied traditional wooden architecture, and examined castle mounds to identify them according to their description in ancient chronicles. Whilst Bielenstein made many seminal contributions to the study of the Latvian language and culture, he was also a fierce opponent of the Young Latvians and a staunch defender of the Baltic German tradition."

He named his estate Russell Hill after his family's farm in Ireland. In 1822, he became a magistrate of the Home District. In 1832, he was appointed to the Legislative Council for the province. When the Executive Council resigned to protest actions taken by Lieutenant Governor Sir Francis Bond Head, Baldwin accepted an appointment as a new member of the council. In 1841, he was re-appointed to the Legislative Council of the Province of Canada, but he resigned some time later. He was a director of the Bank of Upper Canada and the British America Assurance Company. Although retired from the navy, he was promoted to admiral in 1862. Unlike his brother William Warren Baldwin and his nephew Robert Baldwin, Augustus was conservative in his politics. He died on his estate near Toronto in 1866."

Previously he was Organist at St. John's Church, Ladywood. He also taught at the Birmingham and Midland Institute and the King Edward VI High School for Girls. Gaul wrote a large quantity of choral music in a simple melodious style influenced by Spohr and Mendelssohn. His cantatas became very popular with Victorian provincial choirs and The Holy City (1882; not to be confused with the song of the same name by Stephen Adams) may still occasionally be heard.

In the 1956 New Year Honours she was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire for services in the fields of entertainment and broadcasting. A recipe book, \"The Aunt Daisy Cookbook with Household Hints\" was a natural result of the popularity of her show, edited by her daughter Barbara Basham. It ran to several editions, and is still being reprinted almost 40 years after her death. Seven others of her cookery books were also published. The cookbook was reprinted in 1977, edited by her daughter Barbara Basham and published by Hodder and Stoughton. 2010 saw the 22nd reprint of the book In 1963, Aunt Daisy died at the age of 84 years.

Porter is notable for being an exonerated death row inmate who was once 50 hours away from execution. The way in which the exoneration was obtained remains controversial. Another Chicago man, Alstory Simon, was identified by the Medill Innocence Project as the true culprit. Simon allegedly \"confessed\" to the crime on videotape, pleaded guilty, and was convicted in 1999. But Simon later revealed that his confession was coerced with false pretenses and made under duress. One of the two professors, David Protess, was suspended by Northwestern University in 2011 as a result of the controversy, and Simon was himself exonerated in 2014."

  "text" : "Al Jewer is a Native American flutist from Wisconsin. He has worked as a record producer and engineer, and as a studio musician, but he has become well known internationally for his work on the Native American flute. His original training was with the concert flute, and he has been performing classical music with that instrument since the early 1980s. In 1984, he established Laughing Cat Studio, and in 1994, Laughing Cat Records to give himself control over the recording, production and distribution of his music. This has given him the chance to work with many other musicians of the Midwestern United States, including Blackhawk, David Storei and Roxanne Neat, Natty Nation, Adrian Belew and Weekend Wages. Laughing Cat Records currently features artists who perform in Ambient, Native American, Reggae, Classical and Folk. Al has released two solo albums: River Crossing and Prairie Plain Song as well as Two Trees and Music of the Earth (with Andy Mitran). He also previously formed a duo with Christine Ibach called Cedar Wind. Cedar Wind released two albums, Feather on the Wind and Kindred Spirits. His recent music often features harmonies on the alto and bass flute with melodies on the Native American flute. In 2000, he started working with co-composer Andy Mitran to create music for TV and film.

His first rebellion against King Perctarit failed, but the king captured, pardoned, and released him. He rebelled again in 688 when Perctarit's son Cunipert succeeded. He forced Cunipert to a castle on an island in the middle of Lake Como, but his rule was burdensome and tyrannical, and so he lost the support of the people. Finally, in 689, Cunipert issued forth with the men of Piedmont and defeated Alahis and the men of Venetia at the Battle of Coronate, on the Horn of the Adda, near Lodi. Alahis was defeated and slain in battle."

  "text" : "Arthur Heygate Mackmurdo (12 December 1851 – 15 March 1942) was a progressive English architect and designer, who influenced the Arts and Crafts Movement, notably through the Century Guild of Artists, which he set up in partnership with Selwyn Image in 1882. Mackmurdo was the son of a wealthy chemical manufacturer. He was educated at Felsted School, and was first trained under the architect T. Chatfield Clarke, from whom he claimed to have learnt nothing. Then, in 1869, he became an assistant to the Gothic Revival architect James Brooks. In 1873, he visited John Ruskin's School of Drawing, and accompanied Ruskin to Italy in 1874. He stayed on to study in Florence for a while; despite the influence of Ruskin, the Italian architecture he was most impressed by was that of the Renaissance. That same year, Mackmurdo opened his own architectural practice at 28 Southampton Street, in central London. In 1882, Mackmurdo founded the Century Guild of Artists. Other members included Selwyn Image, Herbert Horne, Clement Heaton and Ruskin's protegee, the sculptor Benjamin Creswick. It was one of the more successful craft guilds of its time. It offered complete furnishing of homes and buildings, and its artists were encouraged to participate in production as well as design; Mackmurdo himself mastered several crafts, including metalworking and cabinet making. In 1884, the guild showed a display in the form of a music room at the Health Exhibition in London; the stand was shown, with variations, at subsequent exhibitions in Manchester and Liverpool. It incorporated two of Mackmurdo's favourite motifs. One was foliage twisted into sinuous curves. Nikolaus Pevsner described Mackmurdo's use of such foliage on the title page of the designer's own Wren's City Churches (1883) as \"the first work of art nouveau which can be traced\", identifying its main influences as Rossetti and Burne-Jones, and ultimately, through them, William Blake. The second motif was the use of thin square columns, topped with flat squares instead of capitals. These columns influenced the furniture designs of C.F.A. Voysey, and, through him, Charles Rennie Mackintosh. Mackmurdo used them architecturally on his own house at 8 Private Road, Enfield (1887), and on a house for the artist Mortimer Menpes, at 25 Cadogan Gardens, Chelsea (1893–94), where he incorporated them into a kind of Queen Anne style."

Prior to this appointment he served for two years as the university’s Interim Provost and Chief Academic Officer, and eight years as Associate Provost. He chaired the Self-Study Executive Committee in preparation for the decennial reaffirmation of the university’s accreditation by the Middle States Commission on Higher Education (MSCHE). He also chaired the university’s Presidential Commission on Academic Renewal (PCAR,) which assessed each of the university’s academic programs and recommended strategic changes. Thornton chaired the presidentially appointed committee charged with revising the university’s 1993 Faculty Handbook. In his capacity as Associate Provost, Thornton had oversight for the university's largest colleges and schools (the College of Arts and Sciences, the School of Business, the School of Communications and the School of Education), the Ralph Bunche International Affairs Center, and the Office of Institutional Assessment and Evaluation. He had oversight responsibility for the Enrollment Management units, and directed the university's Amgen Scholars and Leadership Alliance Programs. Prior to joining the Office of the Provost, Thornton served for twenty years as a faculty member in the university's Political Science Department. From July 1995 to January 2002, he served as chair of the Political Science Department, one of the university's largest academic departments. At the conclusion of his tenure as chair of the department, he received an award from the department's faculty, students and staff for distinguished service. Thornton is the author of two books and articles and book chapters dealing with public education and political behavior. He made contributions to the expansion of democratic rights in Prince George's County, Maryland, chairing major citizens committees that addressed redistricting (Citizens for Representative Redistricting); and police accountability (Coalition Against Police Brutality). He served as a legislative aide to Congressman John Conyers, Jr. helping to promote advocacy for the national holiday honoring Martin Luther King, Jr. In 1980, he was a Research Fellow with the US Department of Labor, UNCF Summer program. He is the recipient of outstanding leadership and service awards: including the NAACP Image Award (Prince George’s County, Md.); Friend of Education Award (Maryland State Teachers’ Association); the Emma Mae Posner Award (Prince George’s County Historical Society); and two Fannie Lou Hamer Service Awards (National Conference of Black Political Scientists).

  "text" : "Alexander Crummell (March 3, 1819 - September 10, 1898) was a pioneering African-American minister, academic and African nationalist. Ordained as an Episcopal priest in the United States, Crummell went to England in the late 1840s to raise money for his church by lecturing about American slavery. Abolitionists supported his three years of study at Cambridge University, where Crummell developed concepts of pan-Africanism. In 1853 Crummell moved to Liberia, where he worked to convert native Africans to Christianity and educate them, as well as to persuade American colonists of his ideas. He wanted to attract American blacks to Africa on a colonial, civilizing mission. Crummell lived and worked for 20 years in Liberia and appealed to American blacks to join him, but did not gather wide support for his ideas. After returning to the United States in 1872, Crummell was called to St. Mary's Episcopal Mission in Washington, DC. In 1875 he and his congregation founded St. Luke's Episcopal Church, the first independent black Episcopal church in the city. They built a new church on 15th Street, NW, beginning in 1876, and celebrated their first Thanksgiving there in 1879. Crummell served a rector there until his retirement in 1894. The church was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1976."

  "text" : "Aharon Rokeach (19 December 1880 – 18 August 1957) was the fourth Rebbe of the Belz Hasidic dynasty. He led the movement from 1926 until his death in 1957. Rebbe Aharon inherited the mantle of leadership from his father, Yissachar Dov Rokeach, upon the latter's death in 1926. Known for his piety and mysticism, Rebbe Aharon was called the \"Wonder Rabbi\" by Jews and gentiles alike for the miracles he performed. His reign as Rebbe saw the devastation of the Belz community, along with that of many other Hasidic sects in Galicia and elsewhere in Poland during the Holocaust. During the Holocaust, Rebbe Aharon was high on the list of Gestapo targets as a high-profile Rebbe. With the support and financial assistance of Belzer Hasidim in Israel, England and the United States, he and his half-brother, Rabbi Mordechai of Bilgoray, managed to escape from Poland into Hungary, then into Turkey, Lebanon, and finally into Israel in February 1944. After Rabbi Mordechai's sudden death in November 1949, Rebbe Aharon raised his half-brother's year-old son, Yissachar Dov, and groomed him to succeed him as Belzer Rebbe."

Logan ties the Gnostic movement to the worship of Seth and contends that the main thrust of the different factions was a rebellion against the religion or religions of the Empires in the Ancient World."

  "text" : "Alfred J. Lewy, a.k.a. \"Sandy Lewy\", graduated from University of Chicago, in 1973 after studying Psychiatry, Pharmacology and Ophthalmology. He is a full professor and Vice-Chair of the department of Psychiatry at OHSU, Oregon Health & Science University, and holds an MD and PhD. Prior to moving to Oregon in 1981, Lewy was at the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) in Bethesda, Maryland, working with senior colleague Thomas Wehr. In Oregon he has worked closely with Robert L. Sack. As of December 2005, he had 94 publications available on Pubmed. He describes his research as follows: \"My laboratory studies chronobiologic sleep and mood disorders. These disorders include winter depression, jet lag, maladaptation to shift work and certain types of sleep disturbances. Relying on a very precise assay for plasma melatonin (a hormone that has a clearly defined 24-hour pattern of secretion), biological rhythm disorders can be assessed and their treatment can be monitored. Current research is focused on developing bright light exposure and melatonin administration as treatment modalities for these disorders. Treatment must be precisely scheduled. Morning light exposure and evening melatonin administration cause circadian phase-advance shifts; evening light exposure and morning melatonin administration cause circadian phase-delay shifts. Totally blind individuals have 25-hour circadian rhythms, drifting an hour later each day, unless they take a melatonin capsule at a certain time every day.\""

  "text" : "Annie Lin is a US-based songwriter and the founder of the Ariadne Record label. She was born on January 14, 1980 in Taiwan, and moved to Southern California by the age of six. Majoring in English at Rice University, Annie balanced a busy national touring schedule (100+ dates/year) with classes. After forming the Ariadne Record label in the year 2000, she released her first studio album in 2001 Kicking Stars. The album was made up of original acoustic pop songs which showed a strong Lisa Loeb influence. Annie soon expanded Ariadne to a full-service label, booking other bands and launching the Asian-American Songwriters Showcase, an event she created to spotlight Asian American talent. The AASS toured nationwide from 2001 to 2003 and featured such artists as Vienna Teng and Emm Gryner. East Coast Songs, a collection of music written on the road, was released in 2002 and received positive reviews from the Houston Chronicle, Boston Phoenix, and Village Voice. In 2003, Annie graduated from Rice and began law school. Truck Was Struck was released on April 16, 2004, becoming Annie’s best selling effort thus far. Annie was also a judge for the 7th annual Independent Music Awards to support independent artists' careers. Annie received her law degree from the University of Houston. In November 2006, Billboard magazine reported that Annie had been promoted to director of creative licensing at The Orchard (music label). Annie has started her own law practice in entertainment matters out of San Francisco."

  "text" : "Antonio G. James (c. 1954 – March 1, 1996) was an American murderer. He was tried and executed in Louisiana for the murder of Henry Silver. This case is notable not for any unusual or intrinsic aspect, but for being one of the few such cases that ever comes to the attention of the general public. Like the case of Edward Earl Johnson whose last days on death row in Mississippi were filmed for the BBC in 1987 as Fourteen Days in May, this case came to light precisely because it was so ordinary, and was seen to be so. To some it demonstrated the need for capital punishment to protect the public from such dangerous people. To others it demonstrated the inhumanity of death row. Whatever conclusions were reached, this case remains one of the few such cases in the public domain that does not involve a celebrity perpetrator or victim, and so reminds all concerned of nature of most capital cases in the USA."

  "text" : "Andreas Khol (born 14 July 1941 in Bergen, Germany) is an Austrian politician of the centre-conservative Austrian People's Party, President of the National Council from 2002 to 2006. Andreas Khol was raised in the town of Sterzing in South Tyrol, Italy, but his family eventually relocated to Innsbruck, Austria, where Khol attended school (Akademisches Gymnasium Innsbruck) and served as a Boy Scout. Trained as a lawyer, Andreas Khol achieved a habilitation in constitutional law as a student of Felix Ermacora. One of the most senior politicians of his party, he held the position of the first president of the National Council of Austria between 2002 and 2006. Along with former chancellor Wolfgang Schüssel, he held considerable power within the Austrian People's Party. Andreas Khol assumed the post of head of the Senior Citizens Organisation in the Austrian People's Party. He resigned from the post after he accepted the nomination to stand as candidate for the post of Federal President in 2016. He immediately challenged the government's open door policy on accepting refugees and managed to bring about a U-turn both in his Party and the Government. Despite this he came one but last in the presidential race gaining just over 11 percent of the vote trailing behind the Social Democratic candidate. Internal squabbles in the ÖVP and a lack of engagement by the party machine were cited as reasons as well as a swell in support for the far right candidate Norbert Hofer (FPÖ) who topped the poll. Visibly shaken on election night, Khol announced he would no longer play an active role in politics. Khol is proficient in English and French and is editor of an annual political science book called the Austrian Politics Yearbook. A member of A.V. Raeto-Bavaria Innsbruck, a Catholic fraternity that belongs to the Cartellverband, Andreas Khol is known to be religious and has often voiced conservative opinions on social policy. He represents the Catholic-conservative wing of his party. His youngest son Julian is an internationally known male model and married with German TV host Nazan Eckes. Andreas Khol has six children, three boys and three girls and 15 grandchildren."

  "text" : "Lieutenant General Andrew Thomas Blayney, 11th Baron Blayney (30 November 1770 – 8 April 1834) was an Anglo-Irish peer. He ruled the Blayney estate at Castleblayney, County Monaghan for fifty years from 1784 to 1834, and was one of the most illustrious soldiers ever to come from Co. Monaghan. As commander of the 89th Regiment of Foot, 'Blayney's Bloodhounds' as they were called, he fought with distinction in the Napoleonic Wars. He was taken prisoner at the Battle of Fuengirola, when making a raid from Gibraltar into Spain against a small group of Polish soldiers a tenth his number, and was kept prisoner for four years by the French government. His sabre is currently on exhibition in the Czartoryski Museum, in Kraków. He wrote a two-volume account of his experiences in the Napoleonic Wars - Narrative of a Forced Journey through Spain and France as a Prisoner of War in the Years 1810 to 1814, by Major-General Lord Blayney (London, 1814). He was captured by one of the O'Callaghans of Cullaville, a colonel in the French army and a prominent United Irishman who escaped after 1798. It is said he insisted on Blayney being held to ransom for some of the United Irishmen who were in British prisons. During Blayney's long incarceration, the 2nd Earl of Caledon looked after his financial, domestic, and political affairs, and on his return, Blayney was given a seat in parliament for Caledon's infamous \"rotten borough\" of Old Sarum, Wiltshire. Lord Blayney died on 8 April 1834 and was succeeded by his son Cadwallader, the 12th and last lord."

  "text" : "Alesha Dixon (born 7 October 1978) is a British singer, dancer, rapper, model and television presenter from Welwyn Garden City, England. She found fame in the all-female R&B/garage trio Mis-Teeq. The trio disbanded in 2005 and Dixon pursued a music career as a solo artist, signing to Polydor Records. She began recording her debut solo album, Fired Up, in 2006, but due to poor record sales of her first two singles, \"Lipstick\" and \"Knockdown\", she was dropped from Polydor. In 2007, Dixon won Strictly Come Dancing. Her television exposure led to a successful comeback, which included her signing to Asylum Records, an offshoot of Warner Music Group. Dixon then released a second album, entitled The Alesha Show, in 2008, which received platinum certification from BPI in the UK and spawned four singles including \"The Boy Does Nothing\" and \"Breathe Slow\", the latter of which became her highest charting single and earned her a Brit Award nomination. In September 2009, Dixon became a judge on the seventh series of Strictly Come Dancing, replacing Arlene Phillips. The replacement of Phillips by Dixon attracted criticism, as some questioned the extent of Dixon's dancing knowledge.  In 2010, Dixon returned for the eighth series of Strictly Come Dancing and released her third studio album, The Entertainer. In January 2012, shortly after completing the ninth series and her third year as a judge on Strictly Come Dancing, Dixon quit to become a judge on Britain's Got Talent."

  "text" : "Arachidamia (Greek: Αραχιδάμεια) was a wealthy Spartan queen, wife of Eudamidas I, mother of Archidamus IV and Agesistrata, grandmother of Eudamidas II, great-grandmother and grandmother of Agis IV. The earliest accounts of her depict her leading Spartan women against Pyrrhus during his siege of Lacedaemon in the 3rd century BC. In the face of Pyrrhus's invasion, the Spartan Gerousia considered sending the Spartan women to Crete for their safety. Arachidamia, speaking on behalf of the Spartan women, entered the Gerousia, \"with sword in hand,\" and contested this proposal, questioning whether the Spartan women were expected to survive the ruin of their own city. With the matter settled, the Spartans initiated the construction of a defensive trench running parallel to Pyrrhus's camp. It is likely that Arachidamia helped direct the Spartan women in this respect, since it is reported that the Spartan women impressively \"completed with their own hands a third of the trench.\" Consequently, it is likely that Arachidamia led the efforts of Spartan women during the subsequent battle against Pyrrhus, as they are noted for supplying the defenders with weapons and refreshment during combat, and extracting wounded from the battlefield. Later records of Arachidamia date three decades later, with her assisting in the revolutionary designs of her grandson Agis IV, as he attempted to restore Lycurgan institutions to a Sparta then thoroughly corrupted by wealth and greed. Because Arachidamia and Agesistrata were the wealthiest two people in all of Lacedaemon, Arachidamia's support of Agis was instrumental in gaining support for the cause. She was among those who first pledged to contribute their wealth to a common pool, which was then to be distributed equally amongst both old and new Spartan citizens. However, these revolutionary designs were foiled by the corruption of Agis's uncle and erstwhile supporter, Agesilaus, and the machinations of a rival party, led by the Agiad King, Leonidas II. Leonidas and the Ephors had Agis illegally imprisoned and executed, unbeknownst to a mob that had gathered out of concern and a possible desire to see him freed. Arachidamia and Agesistrata were subsequently lured into the prison on the premise that they were to see Agis; and there they too both met their ends at the hands of their political rivals."

  "text" : "Anna Madgigine Jai Kingsley (born Anta Madjiguene Ndiaye) (18 June 1793 – April or May 1870) was a West African slave from present day Senegal turned slaveholder and planter in early 19th-century Florida. When she was 13 years old, she was captured and sent to Cuba, where she was purchased by and married to Zephaniah Kingsley, a slave trader and plantation owner. They had four children together. Kingsley freed Anna in 1811 and gave her responsibilities for his plantations in East Florida. For 25 years, Kingsley's unusual family lived on Fort George Island in modern-day Jacksonville, where Anna managed a large and successful planting operation. After gaining freedom, she was given a Spanish land grant for 5 acres (20,000 m2) and held 12 slaves. She later was awarded a land grant of 350 acres (1.4 km2) by the Spanish government. After the United States took control of Florida and American discriminatory laws threatened the multi-racial Kingsley family, most of them moved to Haiti. Kingsley died soon after, and Anna returned to Florida to dispute her husband's relatives' contesting Kingsley's will; they sought to exclude Anna and her children from their inheritance. The court honored a treaty between the United States and Spain, and Anna was successful in the court case, despite a political climate hostile toward blacks. She settled in the Arlington neighborhood of Jacksonville, where she died in 1870 at 77 years old. The National Park Service protects Kingsley Plantation, where Anna and Kingsley lived on Fort George Island, as part of the Timucuan Ecological and Historic Preserve."

  "text" : "Asa Fowler (February 23, 1811 – April 26, 1885) was a New Hampshire politician, lawyer and jurist. He served as a justice of the New Hampshire Supreme Court from August 1, 1855 until February 1, 1861 and in the New Hampshire House of Representatives 1845, 1847, 1848 and 1871 to 1872. In 1872 he was Speaker of the House. During all other years in the House, he served on the judiciary committee. He was nominated for governor of New Hampshire by the Free Soil Party in 1855. He was born in Pembroke, New Hampshire to Benjamin and Mehitable (Ladd) Fowler on February 23, 1811. From an early age, he was put to work on the family farm along with his ten siblings, but Asa contracted typhoid fever when he was fourteen and was thereafter unable to do anything other than light farm work. This proved to be a blessing in disguise because Asa was allowed to return to the education that he and his brothers and sisters had abandoned in order to work on the farm. After attending Blanchard Academy in Pembroke on a part-time basis (he still had to do light work on the farm), Asa was admitted as a sophomore to Dartmouth College where he was Phi Beta Kappa and graduated in 1833. After briefly working as a schoolmaster in Topsfield, Massachusetts, Fowler went to work for James Sullivan, Esq. in Pembroke where he began the study of law. In 1834, he moved to Concord, New Hampshire where he continued to study law in the office of Charles H. Peaslee. At the same time, he worked as a feelance journalist and co-edited a literary gazette. In 1835, Fowler was elected clerk of the New Hampshire State Senate, which office he held for five years. Admitted to the bar in February 1837, Fowler was in practice by himself until September 1838 when he formed a partnership with Franklin Pierce, the future president of the United States. This partnership continued until April 1845. Other legal colleagues included John Y. Mugridge from 1854 to 1855 and William E. Chandler from 1861 to 1864. Fowler retired from the practice of law in 1877. He was a U.S. Commissioner for the State of New Hampshire from 1846 until his death; in February 1861, he was a delegate to the Peace Congress held in Washington, D.C., which sought in vain to prevent the American Civil War; and he was the solicitor of Merrimack County, New Hampshire from 1861 to 1865. Following his departure from the last office, he served on a three-man commission charged with the revision of New Hampshire’s laws, and he shepherded through the legislature the resulting general statutes, which were approved in 1867. In his community, Fowler took a keen interest in public libraries and schools, and he served on the Board of Education in Concord. Fowler also served as director of a railroad and two banks, additionally serving as president of the railroad and one of the banks. He is said to have resigned as president and director of the First National Bank when “he lost confidence in the cashier.” (Did this mean that Fowler believed the head cashier to be shady or incompetent, but no one else on the board was willing to fire him??) On July 13, 1837, Fowler married Mary Dole Cilley Knox (1815–1882). They had five children—four sons and a daughter—between 1842 and 1853. All five lived at least to adulthood. From 1878 until his death, Fowler enjoyed extensive travel despite bouts of ill health and the deaths of his wife, a daughter-in-law, and grandson within less than two years. He spent the summer of 1878 in western Europe with his wife; daughter, Clara; and son, William. (His youngest son, Edward “Ned” Cilley Fowler, appears to have become estranged from the family.) After the death of his wife, he seems to have travelled alone, spending several months in Florida before returning to Europe for a last visit. In 1884, he travelled to California, visiting Santa Barbara, Monterey, and San Francisco. Asa Fowler died in San Rafael, California April 26, 1885. His embalmed body was shipped home and buried in New Hampshire on May 9, 1885. Fowler’s religious affiliation was Unitarian, and he was active in that church. His political affiliations were, perhaps, emblematic of his times. His family of origin had belonged to the Democratic Party, but his opposition to slavery led him to his abandon the party for nearly thirty years. From 1846 to 1856, he belonged to the Free Soil Party which was largely made up of ex-democrats and was also called the Independent Democratic Party. In 1856, he became a republican and remained one until 1875, near the end of Reconstruction, when he once again became a democrat."

  "text" : "Her parents were farmers, and since childhood, Agnes and her six siblings attended the Methodist Episcopal Church in Nebraska, Wisconsin. As a young woman, Ozman participated in biblical institutions and eventually attended the Bethel Bible School in Kansas. Parham, Ozman's teacher at the school, taught his students in line with the Holiness movement, from which he introduced the concepts of Divine healing and Sanctification. Parham told his students to ponder over what the Bible verse \"receive the gift of the Holy Spirit\" (Acts 2:38) might mean and whether any evidence specifically related to this gift could be found, giving them three days, while he was absent, for this assignment. By the time he returned his students collectively agreed that if the Holy Spirit had descended upon an individual, then speaking in tongues would be present and constitute sufficient proof of that. The students pointed out that this type of event was mentioned four times in the Acts of the Apostles. Therefore, on New Year's Eve, Parham and his students planned to pray for the gift of the Holy Spirit. In 1901, after midnight of January 1, Ozman asked her mentor to pray specifically so that she could be filled with the Holy Spirit through the laying on of hands, so that she might speak in tongues. According to Stanley Frodsham's book entitled, \"With Signs Following--The Latter Day Pentecostal Revival\", \"On 11:00 p.m. January 1, 1901, Agnes N.O. Ozman La Berge, who began attending Bethel Bible College in Topeka, Kansas (Stone’s Folly or Mansion), requested that hands, most likely those of Charles Parham, be laid upon her so that she would receive the gift of the Holy Ghost, while typically praying the benediction of Hebrews 13:20-21Now the God of peace, that brought again from the dead our Lord Jesus, that great shepherd of the sheep, through the blood of the everlasting covenant, Make you perfect in every good work to do his will, working in you that which is wellpleasing in his sight, through Jesus Christ; to whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen. Frodsham’s book also states that Agnes Ozman-La Berge said:It was common for me to pray the verses while praying, and it was as [if] hands were laid upon my head that the Holy Spirit fell upon me and I began to speak in tongues, glorifying God. I talked several languages, and it was clearly manifest when a new dialect was spoken. I had the added joy and glory my heart longed for, and a depth of the presence of the Lord within that I had never known before. It was as if rivers of living water were proceeding from my innermost being. According to her fellow students, their prayers were heard, and her colleagues reported that a halo had surrounded both her face and head and that she started speaking Chinese. Not long after, Parham and thirty-four other students also began speaking in unknown languages. It is said that Ozman could not speak English for three days and was only able to write in Chinese characters. Many that day experienced other gifts of the Holy Spirit, and soon the group went off from Kansas City to spread the news. Out of this experience, Charles Parham and nine others received the experience of speaking in tongues. Parham then opened Bible colleges in Houston, Texas, which led to Lucy Farrow speaking in tongues in 1906, and an estimated 13,000 others speaking in tongues on 214-216 Bonnie Brae Street in the city of Los Angeles, California. By 1909, at the Los Angeles Azusa Street Mission under the Pastorate of William J. Seymour and with the aid of Lucy Farrow, an estimated 50,000 people had received this experience of speaking in tongues. Later in her life Agnes admitted that she had been wrong to believe that all people would speak in tongues when they were baptized with the Holy Spirit. Writing in The Latter Rain Evangel of January 1909 she wrote, \"Some time ago I tried but failed to have an article printed which I wrote calling attention to what I am sure God showed me was error. The article maintained that tongues was not the only evidence of the Spirit’s Baptism. When that article was refused I was much tempted by Satan, but God again graciously showed me He had revealed it to me, and satisfied my heart in praying that He might reveal this truth to others who would spread it abroad. For awhile [sic] after the baptism I got into spiritual darkness, because I did as I see so many others are doing these days, rested and reveled in tongues and other demonstrations instead of resting alone in God.” In 1937, Ozman died from heart failure."

  "text" : "Hider Hanani (b. 1963), alias Amar Makhlulif and kunya Abu Doha (Arabic: ابو ضحى‎‎), is an Algerian alleged to be member of the al-Qaeda and GSPC terrorist networks. Hanani claimed asylum when he first arrived in Britain in 1994. He left the country for Afghanistan from 1996 to 1999, where he admittedly attended the Khalden training camp. Hanani was held in Belmarsh Prison. As a result of a German terrorism investigation, Hanani was arrested at London Heathrow Airport in February 2001 while attempting to travel to Jeddah, Saudi Arabia on a forged passport. Hanani was held on terrorism charges while his traveling companion Rabah Kadre was suspected of an immigration violation. Hanani was indicted in the United States in August 2001 for being the mastermind of the plot to bomb the Los Angeles airport during the 2000 millennium. When Ahmed Ressam was apprehended, he had a business card with Hanani’s number and calling cards which were used to call it 11 days earlier. Ressam's testimony provided evidence for the indictment, and after he stopped cooperating with prosecutors, they dropped the case in 2005. Hanani has admitted meeting Ahmed Ressam in Jalalabad, but not being involved in the millennium bombing plot. After the U.S. extradition request was dropped, Hanani was held in prison under immigration powers by the British government. In July 2008, the Special Immigration Appeals Commission released him on bail, under 24-hour house arrest. Although the British press was forced to identified him only as \"U\", details in the ruling identifies him clearly as Hanani. In February 2009, Hanani was returned to Belmarsh Prison on the orders of the Home Secretary Jacqui Smith. After writing a statement that said he and his world views had changed, Hanani was released to house arrest again in a ruling in July 2011."

  "text" : "Alonso González de Berruguete (Alonso Berruguete) (c. 1488 – 1561) was a Spanish painter, sculptor and architect. He is considered to be the most important sculptor of the Spanish Renaissance, and is known for his emotive sculptures depicting religious ecstasy or torment. Born in the town of Paredes de Nava, Berruguete studied art under the tutelage of his father, the painter Pedro Berruguete. Following his father's death in 1504, Berruguete travelled to Italy to continue his study of art, spending most of his time in Florence and Rome. It is here that he studied sculpture under the Italian master, Michelangelo. His paintings produced in Italy showed a mannerist influence, with his art being compared with contemporaries such as Jacopo Pontormo and Rosso Fiorentino. Berruguete returned to Spain in 1517, and in 1518, was appointed to the position of court painter and sculptor by Charles V of Spain. From this point in his career forward, Berruguete concentrated on sculpture. Works of his include an altarpiece at the Irish college in Salamanca (1529–1533), choir stalls at the Cathedral of Toledo (1539–1543) and a tomb for the Archbishop of Toledo Juan de Tavera at the hospital that Tavera founded, the hospital of St. John the Baptist in Toledo (1552–1561)."

  "text" : "Aaron the Tyrant (Romanian: Aron Tiranul), sometimes credited as Aron Emanoil or Emanuel Aaron (d. 1597 in Vințu de Jos), was twice Moldavian Voivode (Prince): between September 1591 and June 1592, and October 24, 1592 to May 3, 1595. He was Alexandru Lăpușneanu's son. Emanuel Aaron was placed on the Moldavian throne through the efforts of Solomon Ashkenazi, an influential Jew. He is alleged to have paid officials at the Ottoman court the sum of one million guilders; the moment he came to the throne signified an increase in taxes, one high enough to justify his moniker and to lead to an uprising. Despite Ashkenazi's support, he increased the persecution of Jews in Moldavia, and executed without trial 19 of his Jewish creditors. The events called for the Porte's intervention, and the Ottomans deposed Aron without delay. He was soon after appointed ruler for the second time, owing to pressure from his creditors. Aron Tiranul was, however, determined to end his cohabitation with the Ottomans, especially after the offers for an alliance made by Pope Clement VIII and Wallachian Prince Michael the Brave. He and Michael convened on November 5, 1594, after which Aron swiftly moved against the Ottomans, getting them out of Moldavia and briefly conquering part of Dobruja in 1595. The hatman (a high boyar rank) who led the anti-Ottoman campaigns and who became very popular among the soldiers, Ștefan Răzvan, ousted Aron, whose image increasingly eroded among the people. While Răzvan took charge of affairs in Iași, Aron Tiranul and his family were captured in Transylvania by the troops of Prince Sigismund Báthory, being imprisoned in Alvinc (Vințu de Jos) – where he died, being buried in the Eastern Orthodox church in Alba Iulia."

  "text" : "Alexander Masters is an author, screenwriter, and worker with the homeless. He lives in Cambridge, United Kingdom. Masters is the son of authors Dexter Masters and Joan Brady. He was educated at Bedales School, and took a first in physics from King's College London. He then went to St Edmund's College, Cambridge for a further degree in maths, and then the beginnings of a PhD in the philosophy of quantum mechanics. He was studying for an MSc degree in mathematics with the Open University, and working as an assistant at a hostel for the homeless in Cambridge, when he wrote his first book. He is the writer and illustrator of Stuart: A Life Backwards (ISBN 0-00-720037-4), the biography of Stuart Shorter. It explores how a young boy, somewhat disabled from birth, became mentally unstable, criminal and violent, living homeless on the streets of Cambridge. As the title suggests, the book starts from Shorter's adult life, tracing it back in time through his troubled childhood, examining the effects his family, schooling and disability had on his eventual state. Masters wrote the book with Shorter's active and enthusiastic help. Alexander Masters won an Arts Council Writers' Award for Stuart and went on to win the Guardian First Book Award and the Hawthornden Prize. The book was also shortlisted (in the biography category) for the Whitbread Book-of-the-Year Award, the Samuel Johnson Prize, and the National Book Critics Circle Award in the United States. He also wrote a screenplay adaptation, filmed in 2006 for the BBC and HBO, and broadcast in September 2007. It won the Royal Television Society Award in the Single Drama category and the Reims International Television award for the Best TV Screenplay. In 2007, he collaborated with photographer Adrian Clarke on the book Gary's Friends, chronicling the lives of drug and alcohol abusers in North East England. Masters is also the author of The Genius In My Basement (ISBN 9780007243389), a biography of mathematician Simon P. Norton. Alexander Masters has been portrayed by Benedict Cumberbatch in Stuart: A Life Backwards, the 2007 BBC dramatization of his biography of Stuart Shorter."

He gained popularity as a fighter against serfdom and Russian colonial rule in Georgia. Born in a village Marabda (hence his nickname) to a typical Georgian peasant family, he led from the 1820s a small band which moved from region to region organizing assaults on police forces and loyal landowners. Eventually he was killed in 1842 in a skirmish with a Cossack unit at Mtskheta. His popularity has been reflected in several fictional settings, particularly in folk poetry and patriotic Georgian literature. A Soviet-era silent movie about him was shot in 1923."

He was nicknamed kukhi, meaning \"the Immature\". Ashot was the younger son of Gurgen I of Tao. After the death of his elder brother Adarnase in 896, he probably stepped in and co-reigned with his nephew David who was still underage at that time. When David died in 908, Ashot became a sole ruler which he remained until his own death in 918. The Georgian chronicles Kartlis Tskhovreba and contemporary hagiography such as the Vita of Grigol Khandzteli by Giorgi Merchule evidence that Ashot was a keen supporter of monasticism and cultural projects in Tao-Klarjeti. He sponsored the construction of a cathedral at Tbeti in Shavsheti (now Cevizli, Turkey) and installed as its first bishop Stepane Mtbevari from whom Ashot commissioned the hagiographic novel Martyrdom of Mikel-Gobron. A statue purportedly showing Ashot Kukhi which was removed from Tbeti towards the end of World War I is now on display at the Art Museum of Georgia in Tbilisi."

  "text" : "Ashot II (Georgian: აშოტ II) (died 954) was a Georgian prince of the Bagratid dynasty of Tao-Klarjeti with the Byzantine title of curopalates. Ashot was the second son of Adarnase I, king of Iberia/Kartli and younger brother of David II (r. 923–937). David succeeded Adarnase as titular king of Iberia, but not as curopalates, this honorific being granted by the Byzantine emperor to Ashot. Ashot's original holding was the duchy of Lower Tao to which he added Upper Tao obtained following the death of his relative Gurgen II of Tao in 941. Ashot II also ed and received from the emperor, c. 952, the Armenian canton of Phasiane. By virtue of holding the title of curopalate, Ashot rivaled the influence and prestige of elder brother David II, King of Iberia. During Ashot's tenure, the Vita of Saint Grigol Khandzteli was composed by Giorgi Merchule. Ashot actively supported the development of monasticism in Tao-Klarjeti and rebuilt the main church of the monastery at Opiza. Ashot died without heir and his lands and titles passed to his brother King Sumbat I. According to the art historian W. Djobadze, the bas-relief from Opiza which was brought to Georgia at the end of World War I and which is now on display at the State Museum of Fine Arts in Tbilisi, does not render Ashot I Kuropalates (died 830) and the Biblical King David as it has been sometimes assumed, but the 10th century re-builders of the monastery, Ashot II and David II."

  "text" : "Allan Marquand (1853–1924) was an art historian at Princeton University and a curator of the Princeton University Art Museum. Marquand was the son of Henry Gurdon Marquand, a prominent philanthropist and art collector. After graduating from Princeton in 1874, Allan obtained his Ph.D. in Philosophy in 1880, at the Johns Hopkins University. His thesis, supervised by Charles Sanders Peirce, was on the logic of Philodemus. In June 1896, he married Eleanor Cross Marquand daughter of Richard J. Cross and Matilda Redmond Cross. He returned to Princeton in 1881 to teach Latin and logic. During the 1881–82 academic year, Marquand built a mechanical logical machine that is still extant; he was inspired by related efforts of William S. Jevons in the UK. In 1887, following a suggestion of Peirce's, he outlined a machine to do logic using electric circuits. This necessitated his development of Marquand diagrams. According to Lavin (1983: 8), the President of Princeton, McCosh, deemed \"unorthodox and unCalvinistic\" Marquand's relatively mathematical approach to the teaching logic, an approach he had learned at Peirce's feet. Hence in 1883, Marquand was offered a position teaching art history, a position he held until his death and at which he excelled. He was elected chairman of the Department of Art and Archaeology in 1905. He also served as the first director of the Princeton University Art Museum, a position he held until his 1922 retirement."

  "text" : "Saint Alexandra of Rome (Αλεξάνδρα) — Christian martyr and saint, known from \"Martyrdom of Saint George\" as either Emperor Diocletian's wife or the wife of Dacian, a Roman Prefect. She is also sometimes mistaken with Priscilla or Prisca. According to Frederick George Holweck Saint Alexandra was the reputed wife of the Emperor Diocletian and was secretly converted to Christianity. Jacobus de Voragine listing her name as “Alexandria” describes her as the wife of Dacian the Roman Prefect who persecuted Saint Caprasius of Agen and Saint Maginus. While Saint George was being tortured, Alexandra went to the arena, bowed before him and professed her faith openly. When she questioned whether she was worthy of paradise and of martyrdom without being baptized, Saint George told her “Do not fear, for your blood will baptize you.” She was denounced a Christian and imprisoned on her husband’s orders in Nicomedia, then sentenced to die. Her husband was so outraged by her conversion that he is said to have uttered “What! Even thou hast fallen under their spell!” Alexandra quietly accepted her sentence and prayed as the guards walked her to the place of execution. She asked if she could rest for a moment. The guards allowed this. She rested by the place of Saint George’s execution at Nicomedia’s City Wall. Her three servants Apollo, Isaac and Codratus went to prison with her, the first two died of hunger while the last was beheaded with her on April 21, 303 a.d. Her feast day is usually celebrated on April 23, when she is commemorated at the same time along with the soldier martyrs Anatolios and Protoleon and the 630 others who were martyred for professing faith while witnessing George's martyrdom. The Coptic Church venerates her on April 8. She is sometimes confused with Saint Prisca. Holweck believes that her story was fabricated, de Voragine presents it as legendary but not outright fiction.Prisca was either a Christian or lenient towards Christianity, but never rebelled towards her husband. When Diocletian retired to Spalatum in 305, Prisca stayed with her daughter, Galeria Valeria and son-in-law, Galerius in Thessalonica. When Galerius died in 311, Licinius was entrusted with the care of Prisca and her daughter Valeria. The two women, however, fled from Licinius to Maximinus Daia. After a short time, Valeria refused the marriage proposal of Maximinus, who arrested and confined her in Syria and confiscated her properties. At the death of Maximinus, Licinius had Prisca and her daughter killed in 315."

After earning a degree in aeronautical engineering in 1933, he decided to travel in Asia. He first went to Japan, but the Japanese government labeled him a “Communist”, and refused to let him stay. Buchman then went to China and spent the following six years in Shanghai where he got in touch with a mixed group of Trotskyists from the U.S. and South Africa. He also got to know Wang Fanxi, a prominent Chinese Trotskyist and one of the leaders of the Chinese Left Opposition. In Shanghai, he also met Debby Bloomfield who became his wife. When Alex Buchman left China in 1939, he went to Mexico to meet Leon Trotsky. Buchman spent five months, from autumn 1939 to April 1940, in Coyoacán and worked as one of Trotsky’s guards. As an amateur photographer, Buchman documented a lot of Trotsky’s last year in life, including in black-and-white motion pictures. Alex Buchman died in Los Angeles on January 7, 2003. Alex Buchman never officially joined any party. He was avowedly not a Communist, but supported the philosophies of socialism. He stridently did not approve of Lenin's and Stalin's policies."

  "text" : "Alexey Borisovich Vyzmanavin (sometimes written Vyzhmanavin; Алексе́й Бори́сович Выжмана́вин; 1 January 1960 – 6 January 2000) was a Russian chess Grandmaster. During the early part of his career, he regularly played in the Moscow Championships and in 1981, with an Elo rating of 2200, finished sixth, ahead of several strong grandmasters including David Bronstein, Yuri Razuvaev, Artur Yusupov, Alexey Suetin, Rafael Vaganian and Evgeny Vasiukov. He went on to win the event in 1984 and 1986. Qualifying as a grandmaster in 1989, he went on to tie for first place at the 1990 USSR Championship in Leningrad (the title going to Alexander Beliavsky on tie-break). He placed 5th-9th the following year at the final (58th) Soviet Championship, held in Moscow. These championship successes contributed to his selection for the national team and this included participating at the 1992 Manila Olympiad. Playing reserve board 2, he scored +3 =6 −0, helping the Russian team to the gold medal. Among his international tournament successes were wins at Nałęczów 1986 and Tashkent 1987. He shared first place at Moscow 1988 (with Razuvaev, Gregory Kaidanov and Lev Psakhis) and won at Sochi 1989 (ahead of Joël Lautier and Alexander Khalifman). There followed his victory at the 1990/91 edition of the Rilton Cup in Stockholm and further success at the Gelsenkirchen 1991 tournament, where he won ahead of Vasily Smyslov. He surprised the chess world at Leon in 1993, by placing second behind tournament victor Leonid Yudasin and thereby restricting Anatoly Karpov to a share of third prize (with Veselin Topalov and Peter Leko). As a player of rapid and blitz chess, his reputation was that of a 'speed demon', competing at the PCA rapidplay events of the 1990s and frequently outplaying his more illustrious opponents. At the Moscow event in 1994, he reached the semi-final, narrowly losing out to Vladimir Kramnik, having already beaten Alexei Shirov and Viktor Korchnoi. Commentating at one such PCA event, Maurice Ashley described Vyzmanavin in predatory terms—\"He's a dangerous one, the V-man, looking like a cat, ready to pounce.\" His highest Elo rating was 2620 and he ceased playing around 1997. Vyzmanavin's early death, aged 40, was officially described as being caused by a heart attack. He lived alone, but had been out with friends in Moscow on 6 January 2000 (the Russian Christmas) and his body was discovered some six days later. There were also reports of poverty and depression. Grandmaster Alexander Baburin believes that there had been serious problems with drinking, which had worsened following the breakdown of his marriage."

In September of that year, Arnulf supported an attempt to place his uncle Charles, duke of Lower Lorraine, on the throne. Charles briefly held Rheims and Laon. In 990, Arnulf refused to attend a synod at Senlis and he and Charles were imprisoned (March 29). In June, 991, Seguin, Archbishop of Sens presided over a Synod of Reims in the Basilica of Saint Basle, which deposed Arnulf for alleged high treason in favour of Gerbert, later Pope Sylvester II. This deposition was much opposed, however. Pope John XV sent Leo, abbot of Saints Boniface and Alexius at Rome, as legate to preside over a synod at Mouzon, June 2, 995. Gerbert was suspended from the episcopum. A second synod, held July 1, declared the whole process of deposition and elevation to be illegal and invalid. Thus, Arnulf was reinstated. He crowned Hugh, the son of Robert II, co-king in the Capetian tradition in 1017. At this time, any resistance to the new dynasty had died in him. He held the see until his death in 1021, then the only direct male line descendant of the Carolingian family in the eldest living branch."

  "text" : "Alfred Ezra Mirsky (October 17, 1900 – June 19, 1974) was an American pioneer in molecular biology. Mirsky graduated from Harvard College in 1922, after which he studied for two years at the Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons until 1924 when he moved to the University of Cambridge on a US National Research Council fellowship for the academic year 1924–1925. He received his PhD from Cambridge in 1926, with a dissertation under Lawrence J. Henderson on the Haemoglobin molecule, completing work begun under Joseph Barcroft. On May 25, 1926 Mirsky married Reba Paeff, who went on to become a renowned children's author; they had a daughter, Reba Goodman and a son, Jonathan Mirsky. In 1927 Mirsky was appointed Lab Assistant to Alfred E. Cohn at the then Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research, beginning his association with Rockefeller University. During a sabbatical year at the California Institute of Technology, Mirsky published a paper with Linus Pauling on the general theory of protein structure, suggesting that the structure of proteins are coiled in a specific configuration that accounts for the function in the body, and that the protein is denatured when that configuration is lost by breaking the hydrogen bonds that stabilize the structure. One of Mirsky's more notorious contributions while at the Rockefeller Institute was his attempt to discredit Oswald Avery. Avery had correctly shown that DNA was likely the agent of heredity. However, Mirsky went to great lengths to block Avery's discovery because of doubts that DNA was the sole genetic material. It is said he even urged the Karolinska Institute in Sweden not to award Avery the Nobel Prize. Eventually Mirsky's efforts were successful. Avery did not win the prize, despite as Erwin Chargaff claims, Avery's work was worth two Nobel Prizes. Mirsky became an official Member of the Rockefeller Institute in 1948, and in 1950 was internationally congratulated for the \"grand discovery\" of DNA constancy, which proved the concept of DNA as the hereditary material. He served as an editor of The Journal of General Physiology in 1951–1961. Mirsky was made Professor in 1954 when the Institute became Rockefeller University. He was also elected to the United States National Academy of Sciences in the same year. Mirsky was highly involved in university affairs, and in 1959 he initiated a series of lectures for high school students, now named the Alfred E. Mirsky Holiday Lecture on Science in his honour. In 1962 Mirsky chose a new lab assistant from a pool of candidates, in choosing a woman, Ellie Donoghue, he set a precedent by making her the first female lab assistant in the Institute's history, the very same position which he first held upon his initial association with Rockefeller Institute. Mirsky proceeded to entrust Ms. Donoghue with assistance in his research and the running of his laboratory, setting an early precedent for the advancement of women in the labs at Rockefeller University. Following retirement from his laboratory in an official capacity in 1964, he served as librarian of the Rockefeller University from 1965 until 1972, all the while being allowed to maintain his laboratory at the university for his personal research. He continued to make groundbreaking contributions to the study of cell nuclei in rodents and bovines in direct parallels to the structure of cell nuclei in humans. After his wife, Reba Paeff Mirsky, died in 1966 he donated her valuable jewelry collection, save for a few pieces distributed to family and close friends, to the university's collection. This collection of jewelry, acquired during their many trips around the world, is a part of the university's holdings to this day. He went on to marry fellow Rockefeller employee Sonia Wohl in 1967. Mirsky became professor emeritus in 1971, after forty-four years at the Rockefeller Institute and University. Mirsky traveled widely and was quite knowledgeable in archaeology and art history; his priceless collection of art and historical objects was willed to the Rockefeller University upon his death in 1974 and remains in their permanent collection."

  "text" : "Alfred A. Cohn (March 26, 1880 – February 3, 1951) was an author, journalist and newspaper editor, Police Commissioner, and screenwriter of the 1920s and 1930s. He is best remembered for his work on The Jazz Singer, which was nominated for (but did not win) an Academy Award for Writing Adapted Screenplay in the 1st Academy Awards of 1929. Cohn was born in Freeport, Illinois but subsequently moved to Cleveland, Ohio where he began work as a newspaper editor and journalist. He then moved to Galveston, Texas where he ran a newspaper. Following his career in journalism, he moved to Arizona and participated as a secretary in the Arizona constitutional convention which led to its statehood in 1912. In the 1920s, he moved to Los Angeles, California and began working as a writer, first doing title cards for silent films and, later, scripts and adaptations. He was a co-writer on the 1926 film The Cohens and Kellys, the first of the six-film Cohens and Kellys franchise. His work on adapting The Jazz Singer, one of the first motion pictures with sound, from a play and short story by Samson Raphaelson, led to his first and only nomination for an Academy Award. During this period, he was a prolific writer and wrote more than 100 scripts, roughly 40 of which were produced into films. In the 1930s, he retired from screenwriting and was appointed the Police Commissioner of Los Angeles, and he continued writing as a short story writer. He died of a heart condition in 1951."

  "text" : "Armand Massonet (Sint-Gillis, 22 February 1892 – Jette, 11 March 1979) was a Belgian painter. He studied at the Académie Royale des Beaux-Arts of Brussels and the Ecole National des Beaux-Arts in Paris (in the studio of Fernand Cormon), where he followed the steps of Van Gogh and Toulouse-Lautrec. During World War I, Massonet served as a stretcher-bearer for the Belgian Army while working for the art section of the Army, capturing scenes of war and devastation throughout Belgium. He published an art and literary paper called Le Claque à Fond while on the front line. After the war, he taught drawing in different schools and academies of Brussels while publishing books and articles on art and sketch techniques. He worked with different artists and writers of the time, such as Victor Horta, René Lyr and Victor Boin. After World War II he moved to Paris, where he painted regularly and continued to publish books on art and painting. There he became acquainted with painters such as Vlaminck. Massonet's work demonstrates a particular skill for sketching and capturing movement and light. As a painter, he produced numerous portraits and views of cities (Brussels, Paris, Venice) as well as interior scenes. His paintings also developed the theme of music and dance, portraying jazz bands and piano players. He produced numerous posters and publicity drawings for companies such as Philips and Agfa-Gevaert. His work can be found in museums in Brussels, Belgium; Rheims, France; and Riga, Latvia."

  "text" : "Antonello Trombadori (April 24, 1917, Rome – January 18 or March 7, 1993, Rome) was an Italian politician, art critic and journalist. Born in Rome into a family of artists (his father Francesco Trombadori was a painter) Trombadori lived a happy life in the Villa Strohl-Fern studio-home of his city, coming into contact with numerous intellectuals of the era. An intimate friend of Renato Guttuso and Corrado Cagli, he collaborated with them in his youth on a series of important magazines, including La Ruota, Primato, Città, Corrente and Cinema. Between the years of 1937 and 1940 he participated in a secret propaganda effort to convince Italian youth to abandon fascism. He was caught in 1941 and brought in front of the Special Tribunal, where he was found guilty and sentenced to imprisonment. Due to his family’s celebrity, Benito Mussolini offered him absolution in return for a public apology and admission of tort. Trombadori refused and was consequentially jailed.On July, 1943 he escaped from prison and in collaboration with Giorgio Amendola, he attempted to defend Rome from the Nazis and was subsequently arrested by the Germans on February, 1944. He managed to escape in August of the same year. Soon after the Liberation of Rome he organized an exhibition titled “L’arte contro la barbarie [Art against barbarism]”. In 1945 he presented Renato Guttuso’s album of drawings, Gott mit uns and in the same year helped Roberto Rossellini and Carlo Lizzani in filming the masterpiece Roma, città aperta (Rome, Open City). Trombadori was an influential member of the Italian Communist Party (PCI), becoming a member of its Central Committee. In 1967 he was envoyee to Vietnam for the party's journal, L'Unità. He collaborated also with Rinascita. Trombadori was elected four times in the Italian Chamber of Deputies for PCI, but in 1993 he declared himself \"No more a Communist\" and a voter of the Italian Socialist Party. Amongst his most important critical contributions were his introductions to the retrospective publications Donghi (Antonio Donghi) and Scipione (Gino Bonichi; both of 1985); Scuola romana (1986) and Roma appena ieri (Rome Just Yesterday) (1987). He also served as editor of the catalogue of artworks at Palazzo Montecitorio, the seat of the Chamber of Deputies. He married Fulvia Trozzi, daughter of the famous lawyer and socialist parliamentary Mario Trozzi and had two children: Duccio and Lucilla, and later have three granddaughters, Cecilia (1976), Hortense (1979) and Charlotte (1991)."

  "text" : "Alex Emanuel Fagan (2 November 1950 – 8 November 2010) was the former Chief of the San Francisco Police Department. Fagan was raised in the East Bay community of Richmond, California, and graduated from UC Berkeley in 1973 with a bachelor's degree in criminology. He joined the San Francisco Police Department in 1973. He received three silver and five bronze medals of valor. In 1976, he helped save 30 men from a fire at a gay bathhouse. In 1979, he swam 200 yards into San Francisco Bay to save a suicidal woman. He also oversaw the department's budget and ran the Northern Station. In November 2002, while Fagan was a deputy chief, two men reported that they had been attacked by a group of off-duty police officers, including Fagan's son, who was a rookie with the department. Fagan was charged by a grand jury with conspiring to cover up the incident, which became known as \"Fajitagate.\" Fagan was ultimately cleared and the charges dismissed. He was appointed by San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown as acting police chief in March 2003 and chief in August 2003. In January 2004, newly elected Mayor Gavin Newsom removed Fagan as chief and put him in charge of the city's emergency services office. Fagan died in November 2010 after collapsing while walking his dog on a street in London, England. Fagan had moved to London to join his partner who had recently been transferred to Britain."

  "text" : "Alyse Gregory (July 19, 1884 Norwalk, Connecticut, United States – August 27, 1967 Morebath, Devon, England) was an American suffragist and writer. Her father, James G. Gregory, was a doctor in Norwalk. She showed musical talent at an early age, was sent to Paris, France to receive a musical education when she was fifteen years old, and continued her study of music upon her return to the United States. She was invited by famous concert singer Mrs. Catherine Fiske to return to Paris, live with her, and be trained as a professional singer. She remained in Paris with Mrs Fiske for a year. She was drawn gradually into public movements because of her interest in social justice. After returning to her home country, she decided to give up her singing ambitions. She became involved in local politics and the woman suffrage movement for which she was a fearless public speaker. Gregory decided to start a grassroots women's suffrage club in Connecticut, as she explains in her autobiography The Day Is Gone (page 100). The first meeting brought together herself and five other women. Gregory went on to become a key leader in the Connecticut Woman Suffrage Association through which she directed activities such as meetings, plays, and parades alongside Cromwell native Emily Miller Pierson. She later (page 104, op. cit.) worked as assistant state organizer for the New Jersey Woman Suffrage Association during a referendum on woman suffrage in 1915 and was also active for the cause in the State of New York. After a visit to England during the 1914–18 First World War, she settled in Patchin Place in New York City, where she formed close friendships with a group of young artists and writers. She worked for two years as a copywriter in an advertising agency, which position she left in order to earn her living as a freelance writer. She began contributing articles to such publications as The Freeman, The New Republic and The Dial, becoming Managing Editor of this last journal in February, 1924. Six months later, she married the English writer Llewelyn Powys, and in June 1925, resigned her position with The Dial to accompany her husband to England, where for five years they lived in a coastguard cottage on White Nothe, one of the wildest headlands of the Dorset coast. Her first novel, She Shall Have Music was published in 1926, followed by King Log and Lady Lea (1929) and Hester Craddock (1931), both of which were written in Dorset. She and her husband visited Palestine in 1928, and they spent the winter of 1930 in a house in the Berkshire Hills lent to them by Edna St. Vincent Millay and Eugen Boissevain. From there, they paid a visit to the West Indies. On their return to England, Llewelyn Powys suffered a relapse from an old illness, and in the winter of 1936, they went to Switzerland, where she wrote a book of essays, Wheels on Gravel (1938). After Llewelyn Powys' death from tuberculosis in Switzerland in December 1939, Alyse went to live in the same remote house as his sisters, Gertrude and Philippa Powys, on Chaldon Down near East Chaldon, and wrote her autobiographical reminiscences, entitled The Day Is Gone, published in New York by E. P. Dutton (1948). She was a friend of many eminent people, including Florida Scott-Maxwell (who had been a pupil of Jung), Randolph Bourne, Van Wyck Brooks, Lewis Mumford, Amy Lowell, William Rose Benét and his brother Stephen Vincent Benét, Malcolm Elwin, Theodore Dreiser, Edna St. Vincent Millay, Marianne Moore and Sylvia Townsend Warner. She tended to remain in the shadow of her late husband (whose work and reputation she did much to promote), while continuing to contribute her own articles to a variety of journals up until the late 1950s. In 1957, Alyse Gregory moved into Velthams Cottage, Morebath, Devon, as the tenant of Mrs Rosamund Mary Rose (née Rosamund Mary Trafford), at a rent of \"one peppercorn a year (if demanded)\". After the sudden death of her landlady on 12 May 1958, Velthams was bought at auction in 1960 by the writer Oliver Stonor, who had known Alyse previously; they were both present at local celebrations in East Chaldon on 7 or 8 May 1945, for the end of the Second World War in Europe, which took the form of a large bonfire near the Five Marys, a local group of prehistoric barrows. In her last years, many friends visited her, in spite of the rural isolation of Morebath, which had a railway station until 1966. Alyse had long been an advocate of voluntary euthanasia, and planned her departure from this life. She took a lethal overdose in 1967, and was cremated in Taunton, Somerset. Her last visitor was the historical novelist Rosemary Sutcliff. Excerpts from her diaries were published in 1973 under the title The Cry of a Gull. In 1999, Alyse Gregory: A Woman at her Window by Jacqueline Peltier was published (London, Cecil Woolf). The Sundial Press reissued Gregory's third novel, Hester Craddock, at the end of January 2007 with a new introduction by Barbara Ozieblo."

  "text" : "Marie-Jean-Augustin Vestris, known as Auguste Vestris (27 March 1760 - 5 December 1842), was a French dancer. He was born in Paris as the illegitimate son of Gaétan Vestris and Marie Allard (1742–1802). His father was a Florentine dancer who had joined the Paris Opéra in 1748, his mother was a French dancer in the same theatre. He was dubbed \"le dieu de la danse\", (the god of dance), a popular title bestowed on the leading male dancer of each generation (previous 'Gods of the Dance' included his father Gaétan and Gaétan's teacher, Louis Dupré). He made his debut at the Paris Opéra (as had his mother, Marie Allard) in the third divertissement of the pastorale La Cinquantaine (written by Desfontaines-Lavallée and set to music by Jean-Benjamin de La Borde) in 1772 and was immediately recognized for his talent. He was accepted as a regular member of the troupe in 1775, became a soloist in 1776, a \"premier danseur\" (principal dancer) in 1778, and finally he was appointed \"premier sujet de la danse\" (roughly corresponding to modern étoile) in 1780, holding this rank in the corps de ballet for the next 36 years. After his retirement he trained many famous dancers of the 19th century including August Bournonville, Marius Petipa, Lucien Petipa, Fanny Elssler, Jules Perrot and Marie Taglioni. It was with Taglioni in 1835 that he performed a minuet at the age of 75. Auguste Vestris is not to be confused with his son, Armand Vestris, who married the English actress-manager Lucia Elizabeth Vestris in 1813. Both Armand and a cousin Charles Vestris, son of a brother of Auguste's, were also dancers."

He and his wife Emma Minnie (née à Beckett) established a lifestyle of being artists which many generations followed to create the popular image of the Boyd family. Boyd was born in Opoho, Dunedin, New Zealand, son of Captain John Theodore Thomas Boyd, formerly of County Mayo, Ireland, and his wife Lucy Charlotte, daughter of Dr Robert Martin of Heidelberg, Victoria. The Boyds moved to Australia in the mid-1870s, and on 14 January 1886 Boyd married Emma Minnie à Beckett, also an artist, daughter of the Hon. W. A. C. à Beckett of Melbourne. In 1890 they moved to England and lived for a time at Penleigh House, Westbury, Wiltshire, and in 1891 husband and wife each had a picture in the Royal Academy exhibition. Boyd then travelled and painted a good deal on the continent of Europe, and returned to Australia about the end of 1893, where he lived mostly in Sandringham and other suburbs of Melbourne for the rest of his life. He occasionally sent good work to the exhibitions of the Victorian Artists' Society, but never mixed much in the artistic life of his time. Mrs. Boyd died at Melbourne on 13 September 1936 and her husband, on the property of his son, Merric at Murrumbeena, on 30 July 1940. Each is represented by a picture in the National Gallery of Victoria at Melbourne. They left three sons, Theodore Penleigh Boyd (1890–1923), Martin à Beckett Boyd (1893–1972), a popular writer of fiction firstly under the name 'Martin Mills' and then his own, and Merric Boyd (1888–1959), a potter, and a daughter Helen à Beckett Boyd, a painter."

  "text" : "Alexander Alexandrovich Vasiliev (Russian: Алекса́ндр Алекса́ндрович Васи́льев; 4 October 1867 – 30 March 1953) was considered the foremost authority on Byzantine history and culture in the mid-20th century. His History of the Byzantine Empire (vol. 1–2, 1928) remains one of a few comprehensive accounts of the entire Byzantine history, on the par with those authored by Edward Gibbon and Fyodor Uspensky. Vasiliev studied under one of the earliest professional Byzantinists, Vasily Vasilievsky, at the University of St Petersburg and later taught Arabic language there. Between 1897 and 1900, he furthered his education in Paris. In 1902, he accompanied Nicholas Marr in his trip to Saint Catherine's Monastery in Sinai. During his stay at the Tartu University (1904–12), Vasiliev prepared and published a highly influential monograph, Byzantium and the Arabs (1907). He also worked in the Russian Archaeology Institute, established by Fyodor Uspensky in Constantinople. In 1912, he moved to the St Petersburg University as a professor. He was elected to the Russian Academy of Sciences in 1919. In 1925, during his visit to Paris, Vasiliev was persuaded by Michael Rostovtzeff to emigrate to the West. It was Rostovtzeff who ensured a position at the University of Wisconsin–Madison for him. Several decades later, Vasiliev moved to work in Dumbarton Oaks. Towards the end of his life, he was elected President of the Nikodim Kondakov Institute in Prague and of the Association Internationale des Études Byzantines."

  "text" : "Adolphe Cohn (1851 – 1930) was a Franco-American educator, born in Paris. He was graduated \"bachelier ès lettres\" from the University of Paris in 1868, and studied law, historical criticism, and philology at various institutions of higher learning in Paris, receiving the degrees of LL.B. in 1873. A pupil of the École des Chartes, his thesis was called Vues sur l’histoire de l’organisation judiciaire en France du IXe au XIIIe siècle considérée au point de vue des juridictions extraordinaires and he got the diploma of \"archiviste paléographe\" in 1874. At the commencement of the Franco-Prussian War in 1870, he enlisted and served in the French army throughout the struggle. Cohn emigrated to New York City on May 13, 1875, and from 1876 to 1884 was the American correspondent of La République française, then edited by Léon Gambetta, whom he had known in France, and whose political views he had adopted. In March, 1882, Cohn was appointed tutor in French at Columbia College, and soon afterward made an instructor. By a popular vote of the French residents of New York he was chosen to deliver the funeral oration on Gambetta in 1883 at Tammany Hall, and in 1885 was called from Cambridge, Massachusetts, for a similar purpose, upon the death of Victor Hugo. In 1884 Cohn was made instructor in French at Harvard University. From 1885 to 1891 he was assistant professor of French at the same institution, and during this time wrote much in French and English, especially for the Atlantic Monthly. He became American correspondent of Le Temps in 1884, and continued to act as such until 1895. While at Harvard he was temporary head of the French department in Wellesley College, and in 1888 and 1889 conducted a summer school of languages at Oswego, New York. In 1891 Cohn was appointed Professor of the Romance Languages and Literatures in Columbia College. He was president of the New York committee of L'Alliance Française from 1888 to 1902, and was made its honorary president. In 1897 he was made a knight of the Crown of Italy, and in 1900 an Officier of the Legion of Honor. He edited many French classics for educational purposes."

  "text" : "Anastase Dragomir (1896–1966) was a distinguished Romanian inventor, most famous for his \"catapultable cockpit\" patent (with Tănase Dobrescu) as an early form of ejection seat, although preceded by Everard Calthrop's 1916 compressed air ejection seat, and others. Anastase Dragomir, born 6 February 1896 in Brăila, Romania, was the sixth child of his family. He worked in France at several aircraft factories where he perfected a system to save pilots and passengers in case of accidents. On 3 November 1928 he applied for French patent #678566, \"Nouveau système de montage des parachutes dans les appareils de locomotion aérienne\". Issued on 2 April 1930, the invention was, \"a new system of parachuting from the apparatus for air locomotion, each passenger having his own parachute that allows, in critical moments, the assembly detaching from the plane, so the parachute with seated passenger passes through an opening.\" After several attempts, Dragomir managed to obtain financing and began construction of his \"catapulted cockpit\". The invention was tested in a Farman airplane piloted by Lucien Bossoutrot at Paris-Orly, France airport on 28 August 1929. French newspapers later reported on the invention's success. Dragomir returned home to Romania after the Paris-Orly experiment where, with Romanian aviation engineer captain Constantin Nicolau, he successfully repeated the experiment in an Avia airplane at Băneasa Airport in Bucharest, Romania on 26 October 1929. He continued to refine his invention and obtained Romanian patent #40658 in 1950 for his \"parachuted cell\". In 1960, he received Romanian patent #41424 for a transport aircraft equipped with ejection cabins. Anastase Dragomir died in Bucharest, Romania in June 1966. The photograph shown on the stamp is of a British-designed and built Martin-Baker ejection seat. Founded by Sir James Martin, Martin-Baker ejection seats are used by more than 80 air forces around the world today with over 16,500 seats currently in service. The Martin-Baker Aircraft Company is still run by the Martin family today."

  "text" : "Alondra Johnson (born July 22, 1965) was a Canadian Football League linebacker who played sixteen seasons in the CFL, mainly for the Calgary Stampeders. Johnson was a three-time All Star and won Grey Cups with Calgary in 1992, 1998 and 2001. He was inducted into the Canadian Football Hall of Fame in 2009. Johnson first became a Stampeder back in 1991, playing the next 13 seasons as what many referred to as the 'heart of the Stampeder defence'. After being granted free agency in February 1991 from the B.C. Lions, Johnson signed with the Stampeders the same month and spent 13 years with the Stamps, winning three Grey Cup championship rings (1992, 1998, and 2001) and playing in three other Grey Cup finals. From his linebacker spot, he finished with 1,095 tackles (second all-time in CFL history) and 83 special teams tackles for a grand total of 1,178 in 248 games. Johnson also had 45 quarterback sacks for 333 yards, 43 tackles for a total loss of 113 yards, 16 fumble recoveries with three for touchdowns, eight forced fumbles, 17 interceptions (one for a TD), and 10 pass knockdowns. In 19 post-season games, Johnson registered 83 tackles and seven special team tackles for a total of 90, two QB sacks for 22 yards, seven tackles for a loss of eight yards, two interceptions, one forced fumble, and one pass knockdown. In six Grey Cups, Johnson had 27 total tackles, a Grey Cup record, with one quarterback sack for 13 yards in the 2001 game and two tackles for loss in the 1991 final. In the 1998 Grey Cup victory, 26-24 over the Hamilton Tiger-Cats, he set the CFL record for the most defensive tackles in a Grey Cup game with eight. That 1998 season a total of 87 tackles spurred him to the Norm Freidgate Trophy as the Most Outstanding Defensive Player in the West Division, as well as being named a West Division and CFL All-Star. He was also a CFL All-Star in 1995, 1998 and 2000, a West Division All-Star also in 1991, 1992, 1997, 1998 and 2000, and a North All-Star in 1995. Johnson was also the first CFL player to score on a two-point conversion in 1989. In 2001 and 2002, he received the Stampeder President's Ring Award, voted by his teammates for his inspiration on and off the field. In 2005, Johnson was inducted into the WTSU Hall of Champions. In 2009, Johnson was inducted into the Canadian Football Hall of Fame. In 2010, Johnson was inducted to the Calgary Stampeders Wall of Fame."

  "text" : "Aubrey de Vere, 2nd Earl of Oxford (c. 1163 – 1214), hereditary Master Chamberlain of England, served in military campaigns under King Richard and King John. He was succeeded in the earldom by his brother, Robert de Vere, 3rd Earl of Oxford. Aubrey de Vere, the eldest son and heir of Aubrey de Vere, 1st Earl of Oxford, by his third wife, Agnes of Essex, the daughter of Henry of Essex, lord of Rayleigh, was born in 1163 or later. He had three brothers, Ralph, Robert and Henry, and a sister, Alice. His brother Ralph predeceased him, and his brother Robert succeeded him as 3rd Earl in 1214. The first notice of Aubrey de Vere is as a young boy witnessing his father's charters for Colne Priory. In 1194 Vere was with King Richard I in France, and succeeded to the earldom on the death of his father on 26 December of the same year. In 1195 he was assessed to pay 500 marks towards the ransom of King Richard, who was being held captive by the Emperor Henry VI. In 1197 Oxford was again with King Richard in Normandy when a dispute was litigated between Abbot Samson of Bury St Edmunds and some fifty tenants of the Abbey, including the earl of Oxford. Ultimately most of the tenants came to the King's court in London and acknowledged the Abbey's right to certain feudal aids. Earl Aubrey, the last to hold out, finally capitulated when the abbot seized and sold his plough-beasts. In 1204 Oxford paid 200 marks for the third penny of Oxfordshire and 'that he might be Earl of Oxford', a confirmation of the title which had been granted to his father in July 1141 by the Empress Matilda during a time of civil war. The title had already confirmed to his father by Matilda's son, King Henry II and Aubrey III had been acknowledged earl of Oxford by Richard I and John. This payment five years after John took the throne is thus unusual. In March 1208 Pope Innocent III placed England under an interdict. At the time of the interdict Oxford is said to have been regarded as one of the King's 'evil counsellors'. In the summer of 1209 he was among the courtiers who met the Pope's agents in Dover to try to prevent King John's excommunication. Their mission failed; Pope Innocent excommunicated the King in November of that year. In what may have been his last military service, the earl of Oxford was with King John's forces during a nine-week campaign in Ireland from June to August 1210. Among other appointments, Oxford was Keeper of the manor of Havering in 1208, Sheriff of Essex and Hertfordshire from 1208 to 1213, and steward of the Forest of Essex in 1213. On 20 June 1213 he had the King's greyhounds in his charge. Oxford died in 1214, in or before the month of October, and was buried at Colne Priory. He was succeeded by his younger brother, Robert de Vere, 3rd Earl of Oxford, later one of the guarantors of Magna Carta."

  "text" : "Andrew Strempler is former president and chief executive officer of Mediplan Health Consulting Inc. and RxNorth.com, which he founded in 1999.  In June 2012, he was arrested in Florida on multiple charges relating to the sale of foreign and counterfeit medicines. In October 2012, he pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit mail fraud in connection with his role as owner and president of Mediplan Health Consulting Inc., a Canadian company, that also operated under the name RxNorth.com. He was sentenced to four years in a U.S. prison, ordered to pay a forfeiture of US$300,000 and a $25,000 fine. Strempler's company, RxNorth.com, was found by the US Food and Drug Administration to be selling counterfeit medicines to customers in the United States. In 2010, Strempler was stripped of his license to practice as a pharmacist in Manitoba for dealing in unapproved medicines, and had left Canada to \"an island off the coast of Venezuela,\" where the Winnipeg Free Press located him \"distributing generic drugs from an online pharmaceutical business.\" Strempler helped establish the Canadian International Pharmacy Association (CIPA) in November 2002. His company, RxNorth.com, was sold in part in 2007 to the CanadaDrugs.com Group of Companies; the effective date of change for service provided to customers was January 31, 2008.  He also helped form the Manitoba Internet Pharmacists Association (MIPA) in 2003 and sat as vice-chairman on the board of directors for the Manitoba Chamber of Commerce. He holds a bachelor's degree in pharmacy from the University of Manitoba. He grew up in Winnipeg, Manitoba. Strempler spent most of his prison time in a privately owned prison in the state of Georgia. He was transferred to a minimum-security prison in Manitoba in July 2015. Strempler is currently a free man as of October 2015."

  "text" : "Sheikh Azahari bin Sheikh Mahmud (1928/29–2002), better known as A.M. Azahari, was a Brunei politician turned rebel. Born of mixed Arab-Malay heritage in Labuan, he was educated in Java and later fought against the Dutch there. He was the leader of the Brunei People's Party which sought to reduce the power of Sultan Omar Ali Saifuddin III to a constitutional monarch during the Brunei Revolt in 1962. Azahari's party won all 16 elected seats in the 33-member legislative council and as a left-leaning politician, Azahari strongly objected to the Sultan's idea for Brunei's membership in the Federation of Malaysia, along with British North Borneo (which was later renamed to Sabah), Sarawak and Singapore. The idea of the North Kalimantan was originally proposed by Azahari, who had forged links with Sukarno's nationalist movement, together with Ahmad Zaidi Adruce, in Java in the 1940s. The idea supported and propagated the unification of all Borneo territories under British rule to form an independent leftist North Kalimantan state. Azahari personally favoured Brunei's independence and merging with British North Borneo and Sarawak to form the federation with the Sultan of Brunei as the constitutional monarch. However, the Brunei People’s Party was in favour of joining Malaysia on the condition it was as the unified three territories of northern Borneo with their own Sultan, and hence was strong enough to resist domination by Malaya, Singapore, Malay administrators or Chinese merchants. The North Kalimantan (or Kalimantan Utara) proposal was seen as a post-decolonization alternative by local opposition against the Malaysia plan. Local opposition throughout the Borneo territories was primarily based on economic, political, historical and cultural differences between the Borneo states and Malaya, as well as the refusal to be subjected under peninsular political domination. During the Brunei Revolt, Azahari was in Manila and managed to avoid capture by British and Commonwealth forces that help quell the revolt. He was even involved in the Limbang raid."

He was a director of an agricultural society, the Highland Society of Scotland, and was sent by them in 1831 to determine the state of agriculture in Canada and the United States. Impressed by his visit, he settled with his family on a farm, which he also named Woodhill, near Waterdown in East Flamborough Township, Upper Canada in 1833. In 1834, he established the village of Fergus with James Webster. He commanded a militia unit during the Upper Canada Rebellion of 1837. In 1839, he was appointed to the Legislative Council of Upper Canada and was a member of the Legislative Council for United Canada until his death in 1862. Although loyal to Britain, prosperous and well-connected, he supported the Reformers. He remained interested in improving agriculture in Upper Canada. He imported cattle from Britain and established a competition, the Fergus Cup, for the best Durham heifer. He was the first president of the Agricultural Association of Upper Canada in 1846 and a member of the Board of Agriculture of Upper Canada. He was a senator at the University of Toronto and played an important role in establishing the Upper Canada Veterinary School which became the Ontario Veterinary College, now part of the University of Guelph. He suffered a stroke in 1860 which left him paralyzed and died at Waterdown in 1862. His son Adam Johnston Fergusson Blair served in the legislative assembly for the Province of Canada and was later named to the Senate."

He was born in 1888, the second son of Arthur O'Connor of Elm Hall, Celbridge, County Kildare (1834–1907) and his second wife Elizabeth (née Saul). He was educated at Blackrock College, County Dublin. He obtained the dispensation which was at that time required by Catholics in order to study engineering at the then almost exclusively Protestant Trinity College, Dublin, from which he duly graduated in 1911. O'Connor was elected Sinn Féin MP for Kildare South at the 1918 general election. In January 1919 Sinn Féin MPs, who had been elected in the Westminster elections of 1918, refused to recognise the Parliament of the United Kingdom and instead assembled as a unicameral revolutionary parliament called Dáil Éireann. In the 1st Dáil, he was appointed Substitute Director of Agriculture during the absence of Robert Barton. In the 2nd Dáil he held the position of Minister of Agriculture from 26 August 1921 to 9 January 1922. O'Connor subsequently opposed the Anglo-Irish Treaty and joined the Republican side. He lost his Dáil seat in the 1923 general election and failed to be elected again in 1927. He retired from politics, returned to Trinity College Dublin to study law, after graduating in law he was called to the bar, subsequently appointed as Senior Counsel, eventually being appointed Circuit Judge for Cork city. He never married and died suddenly at his family home, Elm Hall, in 1950, and is buried in Donacomper Cemetery, Celbridge. His brothers were also involved in the Irish Republican movement and his sister Fanny was a member of Cumann na mBan. His brother Daniel was the State Solicitor for Kildare. He was a first cousin of Seamus O'Connor, a Dublin solicitor who was also involved in the Irish Republican movement (one of those who met at Wynns Hotel, Dublin on 11 November 1913 to found the Irish Volunteers) and who was later appointed the Sheriff of the City of Dublin."

  "text" : "Arthur Kelvin Barnes (6 December 1909 – 11 March 1969) was an American science fiction author. Barnes wrote mostly for pulp magazines in the 1930s and 1940s. Barnes was most noted for his vivid and believable portrayals of alien life. As such, he is compared to Stanley G. Weinbaum. Before Barnes (and Weinbaum), SF writers usually portrayed aliens as earth-like monsters, with little originality. He was a member of the Mañana Literary Society. Barnes wrote a series of stories about \"interplanetary hunters\" Tommy Strike and Gerry Carlyle, collected in the books Interplanetary Hunter (1956) and Interplanetary Huntress (2007)."

  "text" : "Alicia Bay Laurel (born Alicia Kaufman, 14 May 1949 in Hollywood, California) is an American artist, author, and musician. Laurel is best known for her 1970 book \"Living On The Earth\", a notable guide for participants in the American back-to-the-land movement of the 1960s and 1970s. Laurel grew up exposed to the arts, intellectual ideas and political activism. Her mother, Verna Lebow, was a sculptor and her father, Paul Kaufman, was a doctor. She briefly attended the Otis Art Institute, San Francisco State University, and San Francisco Fashion Institute before seeking her own course driven by these influences. She studied music as well, and learned open-tuned guitar improvisation from John Fahey, who at the time was married to her cousin Janet Lebow. Laurel lived on Wheeler Ranch near Occidental, California, in Sonoma County in the early 1970s, where she wrote her book, Living on the Earth. Designed to be a guide for others at the commune, the book was first published by The Bookworks in Berkeley, California, in 1970 and sold out the first printing. It was picked up by Random House in 1971 and sold more than 350,000 copies. It appeared on the New York Times Best Seller list. Laurel's distinctive drawing style is featured also in Home Comfort: Life on Total Loss Farm, and in this book, income from Living on the Earth is cited as one source of support for that southern Vermont commune. Moving to Maui in 1974, she had many professions, including photographer, teacher, musician and businesswoman. She updated Living on the Earth in 2000, travelled around the U.S., and returned to Hawaii. Laurel still makes art and music, and is currently working on several book projects."

Davie travelled widely and in Venice became influenced by other painters of the period, such as Paul Klee, Jackson Pollock and Joan Miró, as well as by a wide range of cultural symbols. In particular, his painting style owes much to his affinity with Zen. Having read Eugen Herrigel's book Zen in the Art of Archery (1953) he assimilated the spontaneity which Zen emphasises. Declaring that the spiritual path is incompatible with planning ahead, he has attempted to paint as automatically as possible, which is intended to bring forth elements of his unconscious. In this, he shares a vision with surrealist painters such as Miró, and he has also been fascinated by the work of psychoanalyst Carl Jung. Like Pollock, many of Davie's works have been executed by standing above the painting, which is laid on the ground. He added layers of paint until sometimes the original painting has been covered over many times. Despite the speed at which he worked (he usually had several paintings on the go at once), however, he was adamant that his images are not pure abstraction, but all have significance as symbols. Championing the primitive, he saw the role of the artist as akin to that of the shaman, and remarked upon how disparate cultures have adopted common symbols in their visual languages. In addition to painting, whether on canvas or paper (he has stated that he prefers to work on paper), Davie has produced several screenprints. He found a public for his work on the continent and in America some time before the British art public could reconcile itself to his mixture of ancient and newly invented of symbols and his explosive brushwork. His paintings appear at once apocalyptic and triumphant. In his lectures Davie stressed the importance of improvisation as his chosen method. His stance was that of an inspired soothsayer resisting the inroads of rational civilization. Musically, Davie also played piano, cello and bass clarinet. In the early 1970s his interest in free improvisation led into a close association with the percussionist Tony Oxley. His paintings have also inspired music by others, notably the bassist and composer Barry Guy. Davie designed the jacket for RW Feachem's book Prehistoric Scotland, published by Batsford in 1963. The design was based upon motifs found on Pictish symbol stones. He died aged 93 in Hertfordshire, England on 5 April 2014."

  "text" : "Alfred L. Werker (December 2, 1896 – July 28, 1975) was a film director whose work in movies spanned from 1917 through 1957. After a number of film production jobs and assistant directing, Werker co-directed his first film, Ridin' the Wind in 1925 alongside director Del Andrews. He was brought in by Fox Film Corporation executives to re-shoot and re-edit Erich von Stroheim's film Hello, Sister! (1933), co-starring Boots Mallory and ZaSu Pitts. Most of Werker's work is unremarkable, but a few were well received by critics. Those films included House of Rothschild (1934) and The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes (1939); the latter film is considered one of the best in the Sherlock Holmes series. During the early 1940s, he directed a number of comedies including Laurel & Hardy's A-Haunting We Will Go (1942). In the late 1940s, Werker worked for the B-picture film studio Eagle-Lion Films. Notable films from that period include the unique mystery thriller Repeat Performance and He Walked by Night. The latter film, however, was taken over by uncredited director Anthony Mann. Werker was nominated in 1949 for the Locarno International Film Festival's Best Police Film category for He Walked By Night (1948) and won. The following year, he was nominated for, but did not win, the Directors Guild of America Outstanding Directorial Achievement in Motion Pictures for Lost Boundaries (1949)."

De Gaulle's relatives all testified that the General, who was normally undemonstrative in his affections for his family, was more open and extroverted with Anne. He would entertain her with songs, dances, and pantomimes. In October 1945, Yvonne de Gaulle bought the Château de Vert-Cœur at Milon-la-Chapelle (Yvelines), where they installed a private hospital for handicapped young girls: the Fondation Anne de Gaulle. Anne died of pneumonia on 6 February 1948, aged 20, at Colombey-les-Deux-Églises. Upon her death, her father said: \"Now, she's like the others.\" (\"Maintenant, elle est comme les autres.\") On 22 August 1962, Charles de Gaulle was the victim of an attempted assassination at Petit-Clamart. He later said that the potentially fatal bullet had been stopped by the frame of the photograph of Anne that he always carried with him, placed this particular day on the rear shelf of his car. When he died in 1970, he was buried in the cemetery of Colombey beside his beloved daughter."

  "text" : "Alexander Griggs (1838–1903) was an American steamboat captain. He is acknowledged as the founder of the city of Grand Forks, North Dakota and is called \"The Father of Grand Forks.\" He first traveled to the confluence of the Red River of the North and the Red Lake River (the site of present-day Grand Forks) in 1870 using flatboats to carry cargo downstream on the Red River of the North. During the fall of 1870, Griggs and his crew embarked on another such trip through the confluence area, but were stranded when their boat froze in the icy waters of the Red River one evening. The crew built a small cabin and lived there during the winter of 1870-1871. They soon decided that the area would be a good spot for a new town. Others soon joined Griggs at the site and the community of Grand Forks was formed. Griggs officially platted the town site of Grand Forks in 1875. He also became the fifth mayor of Grand Forks, serving from 1888 to 1889. Griggs was also the city’s third postmaster, served on the Grand Forks City Council, as a Grand Forks County Commissioner, and on the North Dakota state constitutional convention. In addition, he founded the Second National Bank, established a gas works, built the Grand Forks Roller Mill, constructed the first brick commercial building in Grand Forks, and opened a hotel (the Grigg House). A statue of Griggs sits on the grounds of the Grand Forks County Courthouse. Alexander Griggs is the namesake of Griggs County, North Dakota."

  "text" : "Anna Kuliscioff (or Anna Kulischov, Kulisciov; Russian: Анна Кулишёва; born Anna Moiseyeva Rosenstein (Анна Моисеевна Розенштейн); 9 January 1857 – 27 December 1925) was a Jewish Russian revolutionary, a prominent feminist, an anarchist influenced by Mikhail Bakunin, and eventually a Marxist socialist militant; she was mainly active in Italy, where she was one of the first women graduated in Medicine. Persecuted by the Imperial Russian authorities, Kulischov took refuge in Paris, where she met the Italian anarchist Andrea Costa, her first husband. After being expelled from France in 1878, she settled in Italy and became the editor of Critica Sociale, a major socialist paper, in 1891. An activist for causes such as women's suffrage, Anna Kulischov was tried and imprisoned on several occasions. Her views on Marxism influenced Filippo Turati, who became her partner. Together, they contributed to the creation of the Italian Socialist Party (PSI) as leaders of a reformist wing that came to oppose both Communism (causing the split of the new Italian Communist Party in 1921) and the irredentist attitudes of Benito Mussolini (who subsequently left the PSI). Their group was itself expelled from the PSI later in 1921, leading to the creation of a United Socialist Party (PSU) - led by Turati, Kulischov, and Giacomo Matteotti in opposition to the emerging Fascism."

  "text" : "Andrew Ray (31 May 1939 – 20 August 2003) was an English actor, who was best known as a child star. He was born Andrew Olden (Ray was his father's stage name) in Southgate, Middlesex, now known as North London, the son of the famous radio comic Ted Ray and his wife, showgirl Dorothy Sibil. Ray's life was transformed at the age of 10 when he was cast in the title part of The Mudlark, a 20th Century Fox film starring Alec Guinness and Irene Dunne. He played a street urchin who ends up meeting Queen Victoria. The film was chosen as the Royal Command Performance in 1950 and catapulted Ray to child stardom. He featured in numerous films during the next few years, including The Yellow Balloon (1953), Escapade (1955), Woman in a Dressing Gown (1957), The Young and the Guilty (1958), Serious Charge (1959) with Cliff Richard, Twice Round the Daffodils (1962), and The System (1964). He also portrayed Herbert Pocket in the ITC remake of Charles Dickens's Great Expectations (1974) opposite Michael York. His later films included Rough Cut (1980), The Bunker (1981), Pope John Paul II (1984) and Paris by Night (1988). Noteworthy theatre roles included Flowering Cherry (with Sir Ralph Richardson and Celia Johnson), and A Taste of Honey on Broadway (with Angela Lansbury and Joan Plowright). At the age of 19, he married the Rhodesian actress Susan Burnet and they later had two children. Despite a rocky period in his twenties, Ray subsequently appeared in numerous film, theatre and television roles over the years, including as nuclear scientist Klaus Fuchs for Anglia Television and as King George VI in Crown Matrimonial on stage and television. So successful was his depiction on stage of the stammering George VI that he was cast in the same role (though then Prince Albert, Duke of York) in the television series Edward & Mrs. Simpson (1978). He starred in episodes of the television series Tales of the Unexpected titled 'The Wrong 'Un', and ′Royal Jelly' plus Upstairs, Downstairs, Inspector Morse, and Peak Practice. In later years, Ray was a committed member of Equity and served as a Councillor of the actors' union. Andrew Ray died, at the age of 64, in 2003 from a heart attack. His brother, Robin Ray, was a well-known television and radio personality, who died in 1998, also at the age of 64."

  "text" : "Alexei Vladimirovich Stanchinsky (Russian: Алексей Владимирович Станчинский; 9 March (OS)/21 March 1888 - 25 September (OS)/6 October 1914), was a Russian composer. From a young age Stanchinsky was a gifted musician, composing and performing his first works at the age of six years. At the age of 16, he continued to develop his skills by taking lessons from music educators such as Josef Lhévinne and Konstantin Eiges for piano, and Nikolai Zhilyayev and Alexander Grechaninov for counterpoint, harmony, and composition. At the age of 19, Stanchinsky entered the Moscow Conservatory to continue his musical studies with Taneyev and Igumnov to assist his musical growth.Stanchinsky had always shown great promise as a musician even at a young age, but was often viewed as “unstable” and a victim of his own nerves. This became very prominent when his father died in 1910, as Alexei became quite delusional and suffered from this state for many years. After a brief hiatus from music, Stanchinsky returned to his roots by gathering folk tunes for a personal collection and eventually returned to the conservatory life-style by studying with his colleagues again. However, his life would never again be what it was. In October 1914, he was found dead next to a stream near Logachyovo after wandering the countryside. His death is still a mystery, as details were never found or revealed about his last days."

During the Siege of La Rochelle (1572–1573), he successfully engineered a mine under a bastion and breached the fortification, making him popular with his commander, Henri d'Anjou, who later became King Henri III of France. In 1588 Ramelli published Le diverse et artificiose machine del Capitano Agostino Ramelli, or The various and ingenious machines of Captain Agostino Ramelli. The book contains 195 designs, over 100 of which are water-raising machines, such as water pumps or wells. Other designs include bridges, mills, and a possible forerunner to the Wankel engine. The bookwheel is one of the most famous designs from this book. Le diverse et artificiose machine is still printed and sold."

  "text" : "Angelo A. Rizzuto (born Deadwood, South Dakota, 1906; died New York City, 1967) was an American photographer who worked in Manhattan from 1952 until his death. His street photography opus of 60,000 images lay in file cabinets unviewed until 2001. Little is known of Rizzuto's life. He grew up in Omaha, Nebraska, and graduated from Wittenberg College in Ohio in 1931. He attended Harvard Law School in mid-1930s. His father had a successful construction business, but when the father died Rizzuto and his brothers fought over the estate, which drove Rizzuto to a suicide attempt. After drifting around the country and working odd jobs, he settled in Manhattan. For many years he was psychiatrically unfit, variously tormented by the belief that he was the victim of a global conspiracy of communists, perverts and Jews. Every day at 2 p.m. between May 1952 and June 1964, Rizzuto would venture out with a camera to record images for what was to be a vast encyclopedic kaleidoscope of Manhattan, a book to be called Little Old New York. Rizzuto photographed New York's inhabitants and ended every roll of film with a portrait of himself. His images include cityscapes, compassionate photographs of children and confrontational pictures of angry women, along with anguished self-portraits. Before he died, knowing that he would not live to see his intention realized, Rizzuto bequeathed 60,000 photographs and $50,000 to the Library of Congress, where they languished until photo historian Michael Lesy discovered and compiled them into book form entitled Angel’s World: The New York Photographs of Angelo Rizzuto. Except for Lesy's book, Rizzuto's work is largely unknown. His collection of 60,000 images in the Library of Congress is still unprocessed by library staff and is not available online."

  "text" : "Ahmed or Ahmad Karamanli or Qaramanli or al-Qaramanli, (most commonly Ahmed Karamanli) (1686–1745) was of Turkish origin and a Member from the Karamanids. He founded the Karamanli dynasty (1711–1835) of Tripolitania or Tripoli (in present-day Libya). He reigned (1711–1745), as the first Karamanli Pasha of Tripolitania. In the early 18th century, the Ottoman Empire was losing its grip on its North African holdings, including Tripoli. A period of civil war ensued, with no ruler able to hold office for more than a year. Ahmed Karamanli, a Janissary and popular cavalry officer, murdered the Ottoman governor and seized the throne in the 1711 Karamanli coup. After persuading the Ottomans to recognize him as governor, Ahmed established himself as pasha and made his post hereditary. Though Tripoli continued to pay nominal tribute to the Ottoman padishah, it acted otherwise as an independent kingdom. An intelligent and able man, Ahmed greatly expanded his city's economy, particularly through the employment of corsairs on crucial Mediterranean shipping routes. Nations that wished to protect their ships from the corsairs were forced to pay tribute to the pasha. On land, Ahmed expanded Tripoli's control as far as Fezzan and Cyrenaica before his death in 1745. Ahmed's successors proved less capable rulers, however, and the kingdom was soon wracked by internal strife. The Karamanli dynasty would end a century later as the Ottomans retook control."

  "text" : "Abel Lafleur (4 November 1875 – 27 January 1953) was a French sculptor who designed and made the FIFA World Cup trophy, first simply called 'Coupe du Monde', later renamed the Jules Rimet Trophy. The trophy was 35 cm in height, weighed 3.8 kg and was made of gold-plated sterling silver, with a blue base of semi-precious stone (lapis lazuli). On the four sides of the base there were four gold plates, onto which would be written the names of the winners of the trophy. The sculpture, although based on the incomplete Nike of Samothrace (\"The Goddess of Victory\"), which remains on display at the Louvre, was designed to include the shallow, octagonal cup supported by upraised arms and a garland surrounding the model's head. Lafleur knowingly dispensed with the faithful, dynamic design (as used by Rolls-Royce to adorn their vehicles) but decided on a static representation that would assist in how the trophy was held. Lafleur was born in Rodez, in South-West France in the Midi-Pyrénées region. He attended the École des Beaux-Arts in Paris and was heavily influenced as a pupil by the French medallist Jules-Clément Chaplain (1839–1909), and François-Joseph-Hubert Ponscarmé (1827–1903) and worked alongside Alexandre Charpentier (1856–1909), who had been an assistant to Ponscarmé. Lafleur specialised in the naked female form, as a subject for medallic sculpture. From 1901 Lafleur exhibited regularly at the Salon des Artistes Français, at the Salon des Indépendants and at the Salon d'Automne. Lafleur was awarded a gold medal and on August 8, 1920 he was nominated to the grade of Chevalier of the Légion d'honneur. Lafleur was a contemporary of René Gregoire (1871–1945) and Pierre Charles Lenoir (1871–1953). He also competed in the art competitions at the 1932 Summer Olympics."

  "text" : "Allan Stratton (born 1951) is a Canadian playwright and novelist. Stratton was born in Stratford, Ontario, and began his professional arts career while he was still in high school when James Reaney published his play The Rusting Heart in the literary magazine Alphabet. It was broadcast on CBC Radio in 1970. The focus of his early work, however, was acting. While working on an Honours degree in English at Victoria University in the University of Toronto (1973), he performed with the Stratford Festival and the Huron Country Playhouse. After completing his M.A. at The Graduate Centre for the Study of Drama, University of Toronto (1974), he appeared with regional theatres across the country, originating a range of roles in new works by playwrights such as James Reaney, Rex Deverell and Sharon Pollock. Throughout this period, Stratton continued to write, and in 1977 his first professional stage play, 72 Under the 0, was produced by Christopher Newton at the Vancouver Playhouse. A few years later, he turned to writing full-time, thanks to the success of Nurse Jane Goes to Hawaii, a play that has had over three hundred productions internationally. Rexy!, a satire about Mackenzie King, was premiered in the winter of 1981. It was performed across Canada, and won the Chalmers Award, the Canadian Authors' Association Award, and the Dora Mavor Moore Award, all for Best New Play. In 1982, he moved to New York City, where he was a member of the Playwright/Director Unit of Lee Strasberg's Actors Studio, chaired by Arthur Penn. While there, Christopher Newton commissioned Stratton to write an adaptation of the classic Labiche farce Célimare for the Shaw Festival Mainstage. The production went on to tour to the National Arts Centre, and was the first Shaw production aired on CBC television. Papers, another of his plays with an international publication and production record, followed soon after. It premiered at the Tarragon Theatre, and won a Chalmers Award for Outstanding New Play, as well as being nominated for the 1986 Governor General's Award for English language drama the Dora Mavor Moore Award. Stratton returned to Canada in the late 1980s, and moved to Montreal, where he wrote the comedy-of-bad-manners Bag Babies, which opened at Theatre Passe Muraille in 1990. It was nominated for the City of Toronto Book Award and produced across Canada, as well as in the United States, Edinburgh and London. A few years later, he was commissioned to adapt Dracula for the Skylight Theatre. A female van Helsing, a comic look at Victorian mores, and a recreation of the novel's sweep distinguish this adaptation which was nominated for the Dora Mavor Moore Award for Best New Play, Large Theatre Division, 1995. Other plays include The 101 Miracles of Hope Chance, which premiered at the Manitoba Theatre Centre; Joggers, which premiered at Toronto Free Theatre (now Canadianstage); A Flush of Tories, which premiered at Prairie Theatre Exchange, and aired as a drama special on CBC television; and the radio play When Father Passed Away. In the mid-1990s, Stratton headed the Drama Department at the Etobicoke School of the Arts, where he taught senior directing, acting and playwriting. His students won many awards, including three consecutive Best New Play Awards at the Sears Drama Festival provincial championships. However, classroom and administrative duties restricted his creative time and consequently he returned to full-time writing. For the past few years, his focus has been fiction. The results of this work include two novels released in fall 2000: The Phoenix Lottery, a social satire about art, commerce and untidy family relationships, published by the Riverbank Press; and Leslie's Journal, a young adult novel about sexual abuse in adolescent dating relationships, published in Canada and in the United States by Annick Press, and in foreign translation in Korea, Slovenia, France, and Germany. The Phoenix Lottery was nominated for the Stephen Leacock Medal for Humour, the Canadian National Institute for the Blind's Talking Book of the Year Award, and the TORGI Award; it received a Stephen Leacock Award of Merit. Leslie's Journal was selected for the American Library Association's \"Best Books for Young Adults, 2002\", \"Popular Paperbacks for Young Adults, 2003\" and \"Best Reading List, 2003\". Other citations include The Canadian Bookseller's \"The Best of Canadian Young Adult: Gems of 2000\", the Young Adult Learning Services Association (A.L.A.)'s \"Quick Picks for Reluctant Young Adult Readers 2001\", the McNally Robinson Booksellers' \"Our Choice 2001\", and the Canadian Children's Book Centre's \"Best Books for Young Adults\".

A revised edition incorporating cyberbullying in its narrative structure was released in 2008. Allan's next novel was the internationally acclaimed bestseller Chanda's Secrets, 2004.

In 2010, Chanda's Secrets was made into the award-winning film Life, Above All. The film, a German/South African co-production, premiered at the Cannes International Film Festival, where it won the Prix François Chalais. A winner at various other international film festivals, it was South Africa's entry for Best Foreign Film at the 2011 Oscars, and was one of nine finalists. Allan followed up Chanda's Secrets, with the stand-alone sequel Chanda's Wars, 2008. It was published to acclaim by Harper Collins in the US and Canada, by Deutscher Taschenbuch Verlag in Germany, Van Goor Uniebok in the Netherlands, Editora Pruno in Brazil, and Bayard Jeunesse in France. It won the Canadian Library Association's Best Young Adult Canadian Book Award and was a Junior Library Guild selection.

It is a Times of London's Children's Book of the Week and has been nominated for The Governor General's Award and the Silver Birch Award. Curse of the Dream Witch will be published by Faber and Faber in spring 2013 and by Scholastic Canada, with publication by Bayard Jeunesse, France, and others, scheduled later. Allan's second adult novel, The Resurrection of Mary Mabel McTavish will be published by Dundurn Press in 2014. Aside from his novels and plays, Allan has written for international events, including the evenings for Stephen Sondheim, Robert Rauschenberg and Guy Laliberté at The Harbourfront Centre World Leaders' Festival, Toronto. He also maintains an active public speaking and theatre adjudication schedule. In private life, he enjoys reading, weightlifting, and travel; his interests have taken him to Africa, Asia, the Middle East, the Caribbean and throughout Europe and North America. For several years, he volunteered at a Manhattan soup kitchen, and has undergone Santerian purification rituals, witnessed an exorcism in Botswana, and slept between rail cars behind the former Iron Curtain. His work is published internationally by HarperCollins, Faber and Faber, Penguin Books, Samuel French, The Riverbank Press, Annick Press, Deutscher Taschenburg Verlag, Allen and Unwin, The Chicken House, Bayard Jeunesse, Asunaro Shobo, Hsiao Lu Publishing, Random House: Joong Ang, Zalozba Mis, Van Goor, Thuong Huyen Books, Hangilsa Publishing Company, Editora Planeta, Editora Pruno, Sinnos, Scholastic Canada, Coach House Press, and Playwrights Canada, among others, and has been widely anthologized.

  "text" : "Aelius Nicon was a Greek architect and builder in 2nd century AD Pergamon. Nicon is known only as the father of the ancient anatomist and philosopher, Galen. Nicon was a mathematician, architect, astronomer, philosopher, and devotee of Greek literature. Nicon closely supervised Galen's education and tutored him at home, intending his son to study philosophy or politics. However according to Galen, Nicon was visited in a dream by Asclepius, Greek god of healing, who told to him to allow his son to study medicine. Galen soon began his studies at the major sanctuary of Asclepius located in Pergamon. In his book, On the Passions and Errors of the Soul, Galen says that his \"father’s training lay chiefly in the sciences of geometry, arithmetic, architecture, and astronomy. He also describes his temperament: \"But I did enjoy the good fortune of having the least irascible, the most just, the most devoted, and kindest of fathers. My mother, however, was so very prone to anger that sometimes she bit her handmaids; she constantly shrieked at my father and fought with him—more than Xanthippe did with Socrates. When I compared my father’s noble deeds with the disgraceful passions of my mother, I decided to embrace and love his deeds and to flee and hate her passions. Just as in these respects I saw the utter difference between my parents, so also did I see it in the fact that my father (seemed) never to be grieved over any loss, whereas my mother was vexed over the smallest things.\""

He was born Augustin Cuvillier in Quebec City in 1779 and was hired by a Montreal auctioneer, eventually taking over the business when his employer retired. After he formed a partnership with two other men, the business went bankrupt. By this time, Cuvillier had adopted the anglicized first name Austin. By 1807, he was back in the auction business. During the War of 1812, he served with the militia. In 1814, he was elected to the Legislative Assembly of Lower Canada representing Huntingdon County, as a member of the Parti canadien. He played an important role in the founding of the Bank of Montreal and was one of its first directors. He also helped found the Montreal Fire Insurance Company and became president in 1820. In 1821, he was part of a commission negotiating the sharing of customs duties between Lower and Upper Canada. He opposed the union of the two Canadas. In 1828, he helped present petitions against Governor Dalhousie's policies in London. In 1829, he began to distance himself from the Parti patriote. He opposed the Ninety-Two Resolutions that were presented in 1834. By 1836, he was one of the most important auctioneers in Montreal and served as president on the city's Committee of Trade, later the Montreal Board of Trade. He commanded a battalion in the militia during the Lower Canada Rebellion. In 1841, he was elected to the 1st Parliament of the Province of Canada representing Huntingdon and was elected speaker. In 1844, he defended Governor Charles Theophilus Metcalfe against the Reformers when the governor wished to retain exclusive control over patronage. This led to the end of his political career and Cuvillier returned to his auction business. He died of typhus at Montreal in 1849."

  "text" : "Albert Beier (September 28, 1900 – September 21, 1972) was a German footballer. He was a physically inclined, robustly built player. Beier was born in Lokstedt, and started his footballing career at Eintracht Lokstedt, before moving to FC Union 1903 Altona and Hamburger SV. His first success came with a North German championship victory and appearance in the German Cup final with a town from Hansa, after achieving two draws against 1. FC Nuremberg. In 1922 he also won the North German championship title after victories against Union Oberschöneweide. In the 1923/24 season he became victorious for a third time with Hamburger, but in the next season he lost in a cup final match versus Nuremberg. He played his first international match on December 14, 1924 against Switzerland, a 1-1 stalemate. He achieved eleven caps in total for the international team. In 1925 he won the North German championship for a fourth time with Hamburg, but, with Beier suffering with injuries part of the way through the season, other domestic competitions were out of Hamburg's reach. He played in two more federal cup finals in 1927 and 1928, and he played in the Olympic football tournament in 1928."

  "text" : "Angela Jane Johnson (born Forest City, Iowa)  is the first woman sentenced to death by a United States federal jury since the 1950s. Forty-nine women have been executed under state laws since 1900. In 2005, Johnson was found guilty of involvement in the murder of five people in Iowa during a 1993 attempt to derail a federal methamphetamine investigation. Iowa is one of fourteen US states without capital punishment. The jury that convicted her handed down four death sentences. The presiding judge stated \"I am troubled by the lack of certainty in the record concerning the precise involvement of Angela Johnson in these crimes\". Under federal law, the judge is bound by the jury's verdict. In July, 2007, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit upheld the conviction, finding sufficient evidence to conclude that Johnson had participated in the murders. Her former boyfriend, Dustin Honken, is currently on death row, also convicted of the murders. Although it was Honken who actually pulled the trigger, killing three adults and two children, Johnson received the death penalty for only four of the victims, while Honken was sentenced to death for only the two children. Johnson, who lured four of the victims to their death by posing as a lost sales person in need of a phone book, gained entrance into the victim's home, allowing access for Honken. Honken then videotaped a forced confession from one of the victims in hopes of exoneration from a previous drug charge. Afterwards, the victims were taken to a remote location before being murdered. The fifth victim, who previously dated Johnson and allegedly owed drug money to Honken, was also baited by Johnson when she requested they meet at a local country club where she was working. They then drove to a local farm where Honken was waiting with a loaded handgun. The Court of Appeals described her participation thus: \"[T]he killings resulted from her substantial participation in the murders; namely, that she procured the murder weapon, participated in the hunt for Nicholson, employed a ruse so that she and Honken could gain entry to the Duncans’ residence, bound and gagged at least one of the victims, and exploited her relationship with DeGeus to lure him to the remote location where he was killed.\" Johnson, who had a child from a previous marriage, was also pregnant by Honken at the time of the murders. Johnson, Federal Bureau of Prisons #08337-029, is being held at Federal Correctional Institution, Waseca. On March 23, 2012, Federal Judge Mark W. Bennett vacated Johnson's death sentence, citing a failure to introduce evidence about her mental state from an \"alarmingly dysfunctional\" defense team. Her punishment phase will either be re-heard in front of a new jury or she will be sentenced to life without parole. The vacating of her death sentences did not affect her convictions in the case. Johnson was re-sentenced to life without parole in December 2014. Federal authorities had stopped pursuing the death penalty for Johnson."

His father was a Southwark baker. He slept in the Bank of England itself for 25 years, so he was largely a stranger to his own house adjoining Highbury Fields. When he resigned in 1807, he declined an annuity but accepted a 1000-guinea service of plate. When he died, he bequeathed many legacies to various family members, including Edmund Edwin, Yeoman Gentleman of Aldbury. He made his money mostly by speculating in shares of loans to the government, as a private investor. He is perhaps best known among collectors of trivia for his self-written epitaph: \"Beneath this stone old Abraham lies; / Nobody laughs, and nobody cries. / Where he has gone, and how he fares / Nobody knows and nobody cares.\""

  "text" : "Alain Mesili (born 24 February 1949 in Paris) is a climber and mountain guide, photographer and political activist based in La Paz, Bolivia. He was a political activist in France during the 1968 student riots. In 1969 he left the country, disgusted by the French Communist Party's failures, for Argentina. Over the period of a year Mesili explored Patagonia, crossing the Southern Patagonian Ice Field; he may have been the first person to travel through modern-day Los Glaciares National Park. He further explored the Cordillera Darwin and crossed into Chile. He later moved to La Paz, where he worked as a mountain guide. In 1991 Mesili was accused of being driver for the extreme left Commission Nestor Paz Zamora (CPNZ) during an attack on the US Marine barracks in La Paz in October 1990. He fled, eventually to his native France. In May 1994, he was arrested at Miami airport and held without trial for 9 months. He was then extradited to Bolivia in February 1995, in exchange for a Bolivian colonel accused of drug trafficking by the US authorities. He was released in 1997 without facing trial. By 1999, he had resumed his career as a mountain guide."

In 1600, on his father's death, he became head of the Abe clan, and inherited his father's 5,000 koku holding in Hatogaya, Musashi Province. In 1610, he was transferred to Kanuma, Shimotsuke Province. He distinguished himself as a general during the 1614 Siege of Osaka, taking the most enemy heads of any of Ieyasu's generals. He was awarded with the rank of daimyō in 1617, and was given the 30,000 koku Ōtaki Domain in Kazusa Province. In 1619, following the disgrace of the Ōkubo clan, he was reassigned to Odawara Domain (50,000 koku) in Sagami Province. In 1623, he was reassigned, this time to Iwatsuki Domain (55,000 koku) in Mutsu Province, where his descendants remained for the next several generations. In 1626, he was appointed Osaka jōdai, a position which he held for the next 22 years until his death, and which raised his revuenues to 86,000 koku. In 1637, he played an active role in the suppression of the Shimabara Rebellion. On April 22, 1638, he divided his holdings between his sons Abe Shigetsugu (46,000 koku) and Abe Masayoshi (10,000 koku), while retaining the remaining 30,000 koku for himself. Msatsugu died in Osaka in 1647; his grave is at the temple of Zōjō-ji at Shiba in Tokyo."

  "text" : "Anatole Jakovsky (13 August 1909 – 24 September 1988) was a French art critic who wrote substantially, collected widely, and established a museum in Nice for Naïve art, Musée international d'Art naïf Anatole Jakovsky. Atole Jakovsky was born in Chişinău (now Republic of Moldova). In 1932, he moved from Romania to Paris. He met the secretary of Prokofiev who introduced him amongst the artistic colony of Montparnasse. There he developed a binding friendship with Jean Hélion and mingled with the abstract artists who revolved around Michel Seuphor and Joaquín Torres García. Soon Anatole Jakovsky became an art critic focusing on the abstract painters and in particular the Abstraction \"movement - Creation \" of Auguste Herbin of whom he wrote the first monograph. His first papers are devoted to Calder, Arp, Delaunay, Hélion, Mondrian, Nicholson, Pevsner, Seligmann, Villon, Vulliamy, Braque, Picasso, Zadkine… All of whom become friends. He also maintained a very close relationship with Robert Delaunay. Together, in 1939, they created \"The Keys of the Paving Stones\", the first plastic book. It is a collection of poems signed \"Anatole Delagrave\", illustrated by Robert Delaunay and made of plates of rhodoïde fluorescent. It is the first and last time that Anatole Jakovsky had recourse to a pseudonym. The work was drawn with 100 plates which are on show at the In the process of exploring various avenues of interest, Jakovsky met the naïve painter Jean Fous. There, in 1942, while helping him unpack books and various objects, he discovered canvases in a portfolio case of a Rousseau Customs officer which caught his interest. From that moment on, Anatole Jakovsky officially devoted himself to defend, promote and collect naïve painting. In 1949, he made his first appearance with the Editions J Damase in Paris, his first significant work on this artistic expression: \"Naive painting\". He did not cease writing forewords, monographs, and critical pieces as well as organizing international exhibitions of Naïve art, gathering little by little probably the most significant collection of naïve paintings, which he eventually donated with all his files to the town of Nice in 1978. Four years later, the Museum of the Castle of Sainte-Hélène bearing her name, preserved 600 canvases and drawings, sculptures, paintings under glass recalling the complete history of the Naïve art from the 17th century to the present time. Jakovsky's files have been integrated into the museum archives which holds exceptional documents legitimating the existence of this art among the first steps of all autonomous creations of the 20th century. Parallel with his interest in naïve painting, Anatole Jakovsky developed an interest in Gaston Chaissac of whom he wrote the first biography; Alphonse Allais, whom he discovered; the history of tobacco, the collections of pipes which it compared with Marcel Duchamp; old robots; old postcards; the history of the Eiffel Tower; the Palate of the Factor Horse and the Rocks of Rotheneuf; art populaire… Atole Jakovsky was a man in constant quest of discovery. He knew how to anticipate the taste of his contemporaries. He foresaw man on the moon and predicted WWII war as early as 1935.His eclecticism, his perspicacity, his pugnacity and stubbornness allowed us all to discover a whole new art culture."

As made men in the Patriarca crime family, they were placed in control of the racketeering throughout Massachusetts, until Irish Mob groups such as the Winter Hill Gang and the Charlestown Mob decided to run the rackets in their own neighborhoods. During this time Winter Hill Gang members James J. Bulger and Stephen Flemmi were informing on their Italian mob colleagues by allowing the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) to bug their headquarters during the early 1980s. Gennaro \"Jerry\" Angiulo was born in Boston’s North End on March 20, 1919, to the late Cesare and Giovannina (Femiani) Angiulo. He grew up with his brother Francesco, and his late siblings Stella Orlandella, Nicolo, Donato, Antonio, and Michele Angiulo. Gennaro Angiulo enlisted in the U.S. Navy at the beginning of World War II and served 4 years in the Pacific Theatre. He achieved the rank of Chief Boatswain's Mate. Upon completion of his service to the United States, he moved back to the North End of Boston. The FBI had been after him since the early 1960s. With the help of the FBI's own criminal informants James \"Whitey\" Bulger and Stephen \"The Rifleman\" Flemmi, they were able to gain a great deal of incriminating information regarding Angiulo's racketeering operations. The FBI was able to successfully plant listening devices in a bar he owned on Tremont Street. He was arrested September 19, 1983 at his North End hangout, then convicted three years later on racketeering charges. Gennaro Angiulo was granted parole and was released from federal prison on September 10, 2007. He died from kidney failure at Massachusetts General Hospital on August 29, 2009."

  "text" : "Afferbeck Lauder was the pseudonym used by Alastair Ardoch Morrison (21 September 1911 – 15 March 1998), an Australian graphic artist and author who in the 1960s documented Strine in the song With Air Chew and a series of books beginning with Let Stalk Strine (Ure Smith, Sydney, Australia, 1965). Morrison illustrated the books and also used the pseudonym Al Terego. Let Stalk Strine was followed by Nose Tone Unturned (1967), Fraffly Well Spoken (1968), and Fraffly Suite (1969). The first two presented Australian written phonetically to appear as another language, the next two lampooned the clipped, almost strangled variety of upper-class English speech in the same way. The titles, and the author pseudonym, are all examples in themselves (Afferbeck Lauder = alphabetical order). Some further examples are: \n* Strine \n* \"Spewffle climber treely\" - It's a beautiful climate, really \n* \"Emma chisit\" - How much is it ? \n* \"Egg nishner\" - air-conditioner \n*  Fraffly \n* \"Egg wetter gree\" - I quite agree \n* \"Gray chooma\" - Great humour The books themselves contained no clues as to the identity of the author. In October 2009 Text Publishing, Melbourne, re-published all four books in the series in an omnibus edition, Strine: The complete works of Professor Afferbeck Lauder. In the early 1960s Morrison was appointed chairman of the Currency Note Design Group, an advisory committee which assisted with the design of new banknotes which were issued when Australia replaced its pounds, shillings, and pence with \"dismal guernsey\" (decimal currency) on 14 February 1966. He was the brother of the journalist and playwright Guy Morrison."

  "text" : "Archibald Dixon (April 2, 1802 – April 23, 1876) was a U.S. Senator from Kentucky. He represented the Whig Party in both houses of the Kentucky General Assembly, and was elected the 12th Lieutenant Governor of Kentucky in 1844, serving under Governor William Owsley. In 1851, the Whigs nominated him for governor, but he lost to Lazarus W. Powell, his former law partner. Dixon represented Henderson County at the Kentucky constitutional convention of 1849. In this capacity, he ensured that strong protections of slave property were included in the Kentucky Constitution of 1850. Later, the General Assembly chose Dixon to fill the unexpired Senate term of Henry Clay. He served from September 1, 1852, to March 3, 1855, and did not stand for re-election. During his short tenure, Dixon's major accomplishment was convincing Stephen Douglas to include language in the Kansas-Nebraska Act that explicitly repealed the Missouri Compromise's prohibition on slavery north of latitude 36°30'. Despite his pro-slavery views, Dixon was loyal to the Union during the Civil War. He represented his county and his state in a number of failed conventions that sought to resolve the upcoming conflict before it began. In 1864, he joined Kentucky governor Thomas E. Bramlette in an audience with President Abraham Lincoln protesting the recruitment of former slaves as Union soldiers in Kentucky. Dixon died on April 23, 1876."

After years of an Arab dominated government under Saddam Hussein, many Kurds celebrated the election of a Kurdish political representative. Abdel Rahman Mustafa repeatedly denies allegation from Turkey and some Turkmen representative that any attempts have been made to change the demographic character of Kirkuk or to \"re-kurdify\" the city after Arabization program under the former Saddam Hussein regime. In 2006, there was an unsuccessful assassination attempt aimed at Mustafa by a suicide bomber, but he managed to survive. Mustafa submitted his resignation from his position as governor of Kirkuk in early 2011, citing the numerous problems facing Kirkuk and problems faced when trying to satisfy different parties in the province."

Marin was born in France and arrived in Romania at 3 months, with his father Gaston Marin, who was Jewish. He received his Ph.D. in physics from the Central Institute for Physics in Bucharest in 1977. Before moving to the United States in 1983, he worked on high energy physics and astrophysics experiments in Romania, the Soviet Union and CERN. He was Principal Investigator for experiments carried out at CERN and at Dubna from 1974 to 1979, and from 1974 to 1983 was Principal Investigator for the Transition Radiation Experiment on the Intercosmos 17 satellite, and for the ASTRO1 and ASTRO2 experiments on the Romanian Astronaut flight. After moving to the United States, Marin played leading roles in several large international experiments. He designed and built a laser calibration system for MACRO, a search for magnetic monopoles and other exotic hypothetical particles. He worked on the PBAR and EXAM anti-matter balloon experiments, which contributed to the design of the AMS magnetic spectrometer that was later flown on the Space Shuttle. For LIGO, the sensitive gravity wave experiment, Marin designed and built environmental monitoring systems. At CERN, Marin designed and built the radiation monitor for the silicon tracker of the L3 experiment on LEP. In 1991, he proposed and developed a muon system concept for the Superconducting Super Collider that was virtually identical to the one later chosen for the ATLAS experiment. Marin was a long-term member of the ATLAS Muon Collaboration, and helped construct and install 81 end-cap muon chambers. Marin was co-author on 266 publications during his career. He died suddenly in 2005 after contracting necrotizing fasciitis, a rare and rapidly progressing infection."

  "text" : "Aioulf or Ag(r)iwulf (died June 457) was an obscure King of Galicia from 456. In 448, after eight years in captivity, the Roman ambassador Censorius was executed by one Agiulf at Seville (Hispalis). This Agiulf has sometimes been identified with Aioulf. According to the local and contemporary chronicler Hydatius, after the sack of Braga and the execution of Rechiar, the previous Suevic king, by the Visigoths, the Gothic king, Theodoric II, led his army south into Lusitania while one of his commanders, Aioulf, deserted him and remained behind in Galicia hoping to make himself king of the Sueves there. However, the later, Pannonian historian Jordanes records that Aioulf was a Warnic cliens (retainer) of Theodoric appointed by the king to administer the Suevi and who, being provoked by the Suevi themselves, sought to make himself king but was defeated by Theodoric's army in the first engagement, captured, and executed. According to E. A. Thompson, Jordanes is less reliable than Hydatius for three reasons: he lived further way both in time and space from events in Galicia, his record for accuracy is less reputable, and his bias for the Goths led him to make the disloyal Aioulf a Warni and to involve the Suevi themselves in the act of betraying Theodoric. More significantly, however, Jordanes mentions the Suevic bishops being greeted by Theodoric \"with the reverence due to episcopal rank (pontificali reverentia)\", an anachronism considering the Suevi were pagans in 457. After Aioulf, the Suevi chose Remismund to be their king and he was accepted by Theodoric."

He studied at the Accademia Rossiniana in Pesaro and made his debut in August 1989 at the Rossini Opera Festival there. After perfecting his technique with Rodolfo Celletti, he won the 1992 Luciano Pavarotti International Competition in Philadelphia. He has developed a special technique where only the front parts of the vocal cords vibrate, and in this way, he is able to avoid having to use the falsetto, obtaining a clear voice, remarkably similar to a woman's voice. His first recording, Arie di Farinelli (Bongiovanni, 1995), was awarded the \"Timbre de Platine\" by Opéra International."

In December 2009 he was arrested on his way to Qom to attend the funeral of Grand Ayatollah Hossein Ali Montazeri. According to the reformist website kaleme.com he was freed on bail after 170 days in jail but then re-arrested in the summer 2010 for exposing \"secret mass executions at Vakilabad Prison in Mashhad and his criticism of the Supreme Leader,\" according to kaleme.com. (According to the Washington Post newspaper \"any criticism\" of Supreme leader Ali Khamenei, \"who has the final say on all state matters, is interpreted by authorities as insulting the supreme leader.\" He has been working on a project entitled \"wisdom and religion\". Earlier, while working as a journalist for Hayat-é-No he was arrested on 31 December 2001, upon orders of the Special Court for the Clergy. This earned the protest of the \"international press watchdog\" group Reporters Sans Frontieres (Reporters Without Borders)  After his release he went into exile in Tajikistan. Ghabel has issued a fatwa about hijab or head and neck covering for Muslim women. He argues that only covering the body of Muslim women is obligatory, and covering other parts of the body like hair and neck are recommended."

  "text" : "Aden Robleh Awaleh (born 1941-31 October 2014) is a Djiboutian politician and President of the National Democratic Party (PND). He is currently a member of the National Assembly of Djibouti. Awaleh, an Issa, was born in Ali-Sabieh. Opposing French colonial rule in Djibouti, he went to Somalia in 1969 and became the leader of the Front for the Liberation of the Somali Coast (FLCS). As a result of his activities, he was convicted of \"endangering state security\" in absentia by the French authorities in 1970 and sentenced to 27 years in prison. He was later arrested in Somalia in 1975 for \"anti-revolutionary\" activities and spent a year in solitary confinement there. He was attacked and injured on June 24, 1977, three days before Djibouti became independent from France; his injuries caused him to be hospitalized for a year. In the period following independence, he was a member of the government, Vice-President of the Popular Rally for Progress (RPR) ruling party, and a member of the RPR Political Bureau. He was included in the first post-independence government, named on July 15, 1977, as Minister of the Port, and he was subsequently moved to the position of Minister of Commerce, Transport, and Tourism in 1978. He was also elected to the National Assembly in 1982. In 1983, he denounced the authoritarianism of the RPR's single-party regime and resigned from his government and party positions. A book written by Awaleh, Djibouti: Key to the Red Sea (Djibouti Clef de la Mer Rouge), was published in February 1986. He clandestinely left Djibouti in May 1986 and went into exile in France. As an exiled opposition leader, he founded the Djiboutian National Movement for the Establishment of Democracy and the Union of Democratic Movements while in France. In Djibouti, he was accused of \"attempting to destabilize the government and murder senior officials\" and was sentenced in absentia to life in prison on September 7, 1986, along with two others. In 1992, Awaleh founded the National Democratic Party (PND) in Paris. Immediately after a successful referendum was held on the introduction of multiparty politics, Awaleh announced on September 7, 1992 that he intended to return to Djibouti within days and would seek the legalization of his National Democratic Party (PND). The PND was then established in Djibouti on September 13, 1992. He received 12% of the vote in the May 1993 presidential election, placing third; along with the other opposition candidates, he denounced the election as fraudulent. On October 27, 1995, a PND protest was broken up by the police and Awaleh was among those arrested. Accused of organizing an illegal protest, he received a suspended sentence of one month imprisonment in November 1995. At this time, he was the head of an opposition coalition, the Union of Democratic Movements. He stood as the first candidate on the PND's candidate list for Ali Sabieh Region (the only district in which the party presented candidates) in the December 1997 parliamentary election, but the party did not win any seats. The PND experienced internal division in the late 1990s. In May 1997, Awaleh suspended PND spokesman Farah Ali Wabert from the party, a move that reportedly exacerbated the situation. By November 1998, a rival leadership under Mahdi Ahmed Abdillahié controlled the PND headquarters, and in December 1998 Awaleh was reported to be missing. The factions apparently reconciled by 2002. In September 1998, Awaleh accused Ismail Omar Guelleh of working to make Djibouti a colony of Ethiopia. Awaleh and the PND supported opposition candidate Moussa Ahmed Idriss in the April 1999 presidential election; Guelleh officially won the election with 75% of the vote, but Awaleh alleged that this was due to \"massive fraud\" and said that Idris had actually won. During the election, he served on the district supervision commission in Ali-Sabieh District as Idris' representative. Awaleh was denied a passport on June 5, 2000, preventing him from travelling to Nigeria for an African Leadership Forum.In April 2001, Awaleh was convicted and given a six-year suspended sentence for alleged involvement in a terrorist attack at the Cafe du Paris in Djibouti in 1990; although prosecutors said that Awaleh was the leading figure in the plot, he was given the lightest sentence of the four defendants. Awaleh and the PND left the opposition and participated in the January 2003 parliamentary election as part of the ruling coalition, the Union for a Presidential Majority (UMP), which won all the seats in the National Assembly. Awaleh was included as the seventh candidate on the UMP's candidate list for the District of Djibouti and therefore won a seat. On March 10, 2004, Awaleh was chosen by the National Assembly as one of Djibouti's five members of the Pan-African Parliament (PAP); as a result, he was present for the opening of the PAP later in the month, and he was elected as a member of the Pan-African Parliament's ad hoc committee responsible for verification of powers. In the National Assembly of Djibouti, he has served as a member of the Legislation and General Administration Commission. Awaleh and the PND supported Guelleh in the April 2005 presidential election. On February 21, 2007, Awaleh was re-elected as President of the PND. He was a member of the general staff of the UMP's campaign for the February 2008 parliamentary election. In the same election, he was the fourth candidate on the UMP's candidate list for the District of Djibouti. He was re-elected to a seat, and after the election, he was designated as the representative of the National Assembly in the Pan-African Parliament on 25 February 2008. Awaleh and the PND split from the ruling coalition in 2010 after Guelleh pushed through constitutional changes allowing him to run for a third term. The party re-joined the opposition and boycotted of the 2011 election."

  "text" : "Albert C. Goodyear III is an archaeologist who is founder and director of the Allendale PaleoIndian Expedition in South Carolina, where he has unearthed controversial evidence that may greatly move back the date of occupation of North America by humans to 50,000 years or more before the present. His area of expertise includes the Clovis culture which dates back about 13,000 years in North America. Goodyear has been a professor at the South Carolina Institute of Archaeology and Anthropology, a branch of the University of South Carolina since 1974. He has a bachelor's degree from the University of South Florida, a masters from the University of Arkansas, and a PhD from Arizona State University. The Allendale, South Carolina site, known as the Topper site, which has had ongoing excavations for several years, has unearthed many artifacts, as it was a long lasting site of human occupation due to an outcrop of chert, which was valuable for making stone tools. Goodyear has authored over 100 articles and other publications and is a frequent lecturer on paleo-Indian archaeology."

In 1995 she starred in the World Championships, and she almost reached old heights by jumping 15.08 metres. Women's triple jump had progressed, however, and she only managed a bronze medal behind Iva Prandzheva (15.15m) and Inessa Kravets, who jumped a world record of 15.50 metres which still stands. Anna Biryukova also competed in long jump from time to time, and her personal best is 6.64 metres."

  "text" : "Arthur Koehler (1885–1967) was a chief wood technologist at the Forest Products Laboratory in Madison, Wisconsin, and was important in the development of wood forensics in the 1930s through his role in the investigation of the Lindbergh kidnapping. Koehler’s particular research interest in the identification, cellular structure and growth of wood gave him the specific training and abilities necessary for the careful examination of the ladder which had been used by the abductor of Charles Lindbergh, Jr., aged twenty months, and the tracing of the ladder to a company in McCormick, South Carolina. Koehler, from there, traced the wood of the ladder to a Bronx lumber yard. In the trial of Bruno Hauptmann, Koehler brought out his evidence which helped to indict Hauptmann of the kidnapping and sent Hauptmann to the electric chair. After it was discovered that plank had disappeared from Hauptmann's attic, Koehler brought out his evidence: the wood he traced to Hauptmann. He proved, by fitting the two pieces together, that the attic board matched with the ladder rail used by the kidnapper, giving evidence that Hauptmann built the ladder. His evidence brought to the jury's decision to execute Bruno Hauptmann. In the film J. Edgar Koehler was played by actor Stephen Root.Arthur Koehler was a proud grandfather of Tommy Koehler a famous social studies teacher in Franklin, TN at Grassland Middle School."

  "text" : "Al Lawrence (born in Illinois, United States) is a chess expert and author. After serving in the US Army in Vietnam, Lawrence returned to the University of Missouri-Columbia, earning graduate degrees in English literature and education. After teaching school in Lincoln, Nebraska, he came to work for the United States Chess Federation in 1981. In 1988 he was appointed Executive Director. During his time in office, Lawrence greatly increased both the membership and the revenues of the USCF. Membership rose from about 50,000 to 84,000 and annual sales and revenues rose from less than $4 million to more than $6.5 million, which is still a record. Lawrence was especially effective in increasing sales of books and equipment, which he helped grow to over $3.5 million annually. Lawrence later became Vice President of Excalibur Electronics in Miami. Excalibur also maintained the World Chess Hall of Fame, for which Lawrence served as volunteer Executive Director. In 2009, he helped move the Hall's artifacts to its current location in St. Louis. In 2012 Lawrence became director of the Texas Tech Chess Program, which was suddenly left without a competitive team when former director Susan Polgar took the championship squad to Webster University. (College chess is not governed by NCAA rules.) By December 2013, the new Tech team had qualified for the Final Four of College Chess and continued to qualify through 2015, when Lawrence left Texas Tech University to become Managing Director of the U.S. Chess Trust. In December 2015, Texas Tech University won the Pan-American Intercollegiate Team Chess Championships for the first time in its history. Lawrence is the author of 12 books on a variety of nonfiction topics including chess and astronomy and is a monthly columnist and feature writer for Chess Life magazine. He is also a World Book Encyclopedia Yearbook contributor. Lawrence won the Chess Journalist of the Year Award in 2000 from the Chess Journalists of America. In a rare repeat of this honor, Lawrence was again named Chess Journalist of the Year in 2016."

Cary was born in Hammersmith, to Lucius Viscount Falkland and Caroline Butler. He grew up in Chelsea, where his neighbours were actors André Morell and Joan Greenwood. He knew from the age of twelve that he wanted to work in the film industry. He was initially educated at Westminster School, but was expelled before his A-levels, and sent instead to Loretto in Scotland. He left with unremarkable grades and, after a brief stint as a runner in a New York theatre, joined the army on a whim: \"I had a bet with a friend who didn't think I could do it, but I loved it. Having been a total pain in the neck about authority at school, I took a perverse enjoyment in being given instructions and carrying them out.\" He graduated from Sandhurst Military Academy in 1985 and was posted to Northern Ireland during the height of the Troubles. He saw active service during the Gulf War, in which he was attached to a company of American marines. He left the military shortly after the war, and went to Hollywood to pursue a career as a screenwriter. After a decade of little success, he achieved a spot in the writers' room for the first series of Lie to Me in 2009. He later became a writer and producer for Homeland, and has also worked on The Riches and In Plain Sight. In 2013 he became engaged to American actress Jennifer Marsala, a cast member in Homeland. The marriage took place in Somerset on 31 December 2013. He has a son, Lucius (born in Los Angeles on 6 February 1995), from his first marriage, as well as a natural son, Sebastien (born 2004). He appeared in the BBC program The Gift on 10 February 2015, in which met a fellow ex-soldier who wished to thank him for saving his life."

A vice admiral, Chaste commanded the French-Portuguese naval forces supporting António, Prior of Crato's attempt to defend the Azores from Spain to use as a staging point to liberate Portugal. However, he was defeated by Álvaro de Bazán, Marquis of Santa Cruz at the Battle of Terceira in 1583. After agreeing to command an expedition to the Saint Lawrence River with former officers Pierre Dugua, Sieur de Mons, François Gravé Du Pont, and Samuel Champlain, Chaste was appointed Viceroy of Canada by King Henry IV on February 6, 1602. Chaste would preside over New France as lieutenant governor later forming the \"Canada and Acadia Trading Company\", which would eventually establish French domination of the North American fur trade for more than a decade, overseeing the company until his death in 1603, shortly before this first expedition return to France."

Among his accomplishments was the creation of the world's first static locomotive test facility at the Pennsylvania Railroad's Altoona Works, enabling locomotives to be exhaustively and repeatably tested under load – essentially, a locomotive version of the chassis dynamometer. Under his supervision, the PRR designed and produced many noteworthy steam locomotive designs, such as the E6 Atlantics, K4s Pacifics and L1s Mikados. He was also instrumental in the Pennsylvania's electrification development, although it did not reach full fruition until after his death. He held many patents in the field of railway engineering."

Educated in the Soviet Union, he served as an air force pilot under the monarchy of Mohammed Zahir Shah, and later as the air force garrison commander under President Mohammed Daoud Khan in 1973. When the Communist government took over he was appointed head of the Afghan intelligence service in 1978. In September 1979 Sarwari was involved in a plot to oust Prime Minister Hafizullah Amin. After the failure of the plot, he escaped to the Soviet Embassy, where he was given asylum until the Soviet invasion and the fall of Amin in December 1979. After the invasion, under the government of Babrak Karmal, Sarwari was first given the task of deputy prime minister, but he was soon removed from the government and posted as ambassador to Mongolia. In 1992, after the collapse of the Communist regime, Sarwari was arrested and remained in prison for more than 13 years. On December 25, 2005, he was charged with the involvement in the arbitrary arrest, torture and mass killing of hundreds of opponents during his tenure as head of Afghan intelligence for a period of one year. On February 25, 2006, he was sentenced to die by firing squad for ordering the killing of over 400 people; he was cleared of charges involving conspiracy against the post-Communist government. His was the first trial involving war crimes in Afghanistan. Reuters reported that he received a death sentence in January 2006. In 2008 a court of appeal commuted his sentence to 19 years' imprisonment."

He was able to interpret fossil insects in terms of comparative morphology of recent species, and his description of the evolutionary relationships of the various insect orders was ahead of its time. A number of major lineages that he proposed are still accepted in current insect classification."

  "text" : "Alexandr Aleksandrovich Morozov (Russian: Александр Александрович Морозов, October 16, 1904, Bezhitsa (now part of Bryansk), Oryol Governorate – June 14, 1979) was a Soviet engineer and tank designer. He was in charge of the Soviet tank design bureau for thirty-six of the most critical years in Soviet tank development (1940–76). Among Morozov's achievements were leading the design team for the T-54/55 tank series, the tank with the largest production in history, and designing the drive train and later overall refinements for the T-34 tank series, the tank with the second largest production in history. A graduate from the Moscow Mechanical Institute, in 1928 Morozov started work at a new design bureau headed by I. Aleksiyenko, at the Kharkiv Locomotive Factory of Kharkiv (then part of the USSR, now of Ukraine). Here he contributed to the lacklustre T-12 and T-24 tanks, and the highly successful BT fast tanks. Under Mikhail Koshkin he was responsible for the drive-train design of the famous T-34 medium tank in 1937–40, and led the design bureau from Koshkin's death in 1940. As chief designer of the bureau, Morozov presided over its temporary relocation to Nizhniy Tagil during the war years of 1941–44, and his bureau redesigned components of the T-34 to make production as efficient as possible. He led the development of the T-44 medium tank and the T-54 and T-64 main battle tanks, receiving the Lenin Prize for the latter. Morozov retired due to ill health in 1976 and died soon after. In 1979, the bureau where he worked for over fifty years was renamed Morozov Design Bureau in his honour."

  "text" : "Andrea Adami da Bolsena (30 November 1663 – 22 July 1742) was an Italian castrato, musician later secretary to Cardinal Ottoboni. Bolsena was born in Bolsena. Until 1690 he was serving the former queen Christina I of Sweden, like Archangelo Corelli and the cellist Filippo Amadei. They performed in operas by Flavio Carlo Lanciani (1667-1706) and Alessandro Stradella. Through the influence of and being the favourite of Cardinal Ottoboni he was appointed master of the papal choir in 1700. He left a history of this institution, with portraits and memoirs of the singers (in the Sistine Chapel), under the title of \"Osservazioni per ben regolare il coro dei cantori della Cappella Pontificia\" (Rome, 1711). He was reportedly highly esteemed by the Romans for his personal as well as his musical gifts. He helped his nephew Lionardo Adami becoming the librarian. He died in Rome.

It was during Suharto's New Order rule when gangsters were used in politics, business and government agencies. In 1998, Anton Medan was used as a scapegoat for the orchestration of the Jakarta Riots after which the allegation was then quietly dropped. The riot, which was initially a student demonstration to protest against the Indonesian president Suharto, turned into an anti-Chinese demonstration in the capital Jakarta. Anton Medan is of Chinese descent, but he took to the street and joined the riot to prove that he was loyal to the people but he himself became a target. In the political turmoil of 1998, it was also reported that Prabowo Subianto, Suharto's son-in-law and the commander of Kopassus, the Indonesian Special Forces, had recruited and manipulated Anton Medan to gain militant supporters. During the investigation of the 1998 riot, Anton Medan denied the accusation that he was actively involved behind the scenes, although he admitted that he was in the middle of the mob. However, he refused to testify unless the National Human Rights Commission rehabilitated his name first."

After establishing himself as a lead rebellion actor in a number of commercially successful films, he became synonymous with the term \"rebel star\" and has since continued to hold a matinee idol status in the popular culture of Karnataka state. He's currently the MLA with the Indian National Congress party, winning the assembly election of the Mandya constituency, by a margin of 42,937 votes. He served as Minister of Housing,Karnataka Government in the Cabinet of Chef Minister Siddaramaiah from May 2013 to June 2016.

Shankar's blockbuster Gentleman which opened to positive reviews, while Arjun went on to win the State Award for Best Actor. During this time, he starred in hits such as Jai Hind (1994), Karnaa (1995), and the crime drama film Kurudhipunal (1995), for which Arjun won positive acclaim for his role while the film became India's official entry for the 68th Academy Awards Best Foreign Language Film category. In 1999, he starred in the political drama Mudhalvan (1999). Portraying an ambitious TV journalist who receives the opportunity to become the Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu for a day, Arjun offered bulk dates for filming the project to Shankar. The film subsequently won positive reviews with Arjun described as having \"acquitted himself with aplomb in the challenging role\". Arjun received the Tamil Nadu State Film Award for Best Actor for his role as well as numerous other nominations. Arjun then briefly experimented in softer roles with Kannodu Kanbathellam (1999) and as an energetic civil service officer in Vaanavil (2000). He was then featured in Vasanth's romantic drama film Rhythm, where he played a photographer, who eventually falls in love with a widow. Featuring a popular soundtrack and opening to positive reviews, Rhythm also became a commercial success. He carried on with a lighter theme in his next directorial venture, the love story Vedham (2001), while he ventured into Telugu cinema again by appearing in Raja's Hanuman Junction and the Kannada devotional film Sri Manjunatha (2001). In 2012, he appeared in his 150th film, the Kannada film Prasad screened at the Berlin Film Festival. Arjun won the Karnataka State Film Award for Best Actor for his work in the film."

In 2000 he was awarded the title Greek Australian of the Century by the Melbourne-based Greek newspaper Neos Kosmos. He held controversial opinions on a number of medical issues. He was a supporter of Linus Pauling's controversial theory that many diseases result from overproduction of free radicals and can accordingly be prevented or cured by Vitamin C; this led him to treat many conditions with high intravenous doses of vitamin C. He also believed that vaccination schemes have been used for deliberate genocide (among indigenous Australians, and in spreading HIV in Africa); and that the US government systematically planned to get rid of undesirables such as criminals by encouraging people with known heart problems to be vaccinated."

  "text" : "Axel Gudbrand Blytt (19 May 1843 – 18 July 1898) was a Norwegian botanist and geologist. His father was Matthias Numsen Blytt, also a botanist. Axel Blytt served at the Christiania Herbarium at the University of Oslo from 1865, first as a conservator, then, from 1880, as a professor. Based partly on his father's work, he published in the 1870s the book Essay on the Immigration of the Norwegian Flora during Alternating Rainy and Dry Periods. He is today best known for developing the Blytt-Sernander theory of climatic change. His work, Essay on the Immigration of Norwegian Flora. (1876) was read by, and influenced, Charles Darwin. Blyttberget, a high crag southeast of Nordlaguna on the Norwegian island of Jan Mayen, is named for him. The German botanist Wilhelm Schimper named several mosses after him as well. The remaining existent specimens Blytt collected on his studies are held at the Botanical Museum of the University of Oslo. The Buffalo Museum of Science in Buffalo, New York also holds a collection of specimens attributed to a collector identified as \"Blytt\", who is likely Axel Blytt. This is evidenced by Charles Peck, the New York State Botanist from 1883 to 1913, in his 1872 Report of the Botanist to the New York Senate. Peck wrote that he had received 22 specimens of lichens from the University of Norway, Christiana (Oslo), Norway, for the New York State Cabinet. There is also a mention of Blytt in correspondence between the Swiss botanist Leo Lesquereux and George William Clinton, then President of the Buffalo Museum of Natural Sciences, regarding specimens and a visit to the Buffalo Museum by Lesquereux. Though the existing correspondence only provides Lesquereux's letters, he refers to Blytt as \"a good Norwegian Botanist I do not know his address in any other way than as you write it. Christiania Norway.\" The standard author abbreviation A.Blytt is used to indicate this individual as the author when citing a botanical name."

He is said to have been once seized with an attack of delirium, brought on by want of sleep, from which he was delivered by his pupil Archigenes, who ordered his head to be fomented with a great quantity of warm oil. He is frequently quoted by Galen, who mentions him among the Pneumatici. None of his writings are now extant. The precise opinions of his sect are not known, but they were probably nearly the same as those of the Eclectici."

  "text" : "Antonio Breschi, also known as Antóni O’Breskey (born in Florence, Italy 1950, with Argentine roots) is a classical and minimalist composer, pianist and trumpet player, folk singer, writer, poet and music educator.Oliver Sweeney, in the Irish music magazine Hot Press, wrote of him: “He is a genius whose music is without frontiers, and whose originality makes him one of the most innovative artists in the varied musical genres of today.”As composer and pianist he is very original and eclectic, and he composed enormous varieties of music, creating a very personal style: “one of the most exciting sounds we have heard in years\" (The 20th Queen Festival at Queen, Belfast 1981).His compositions for cello and piano and for oboe and piano as well as his world music became soundtracks for films, television programs, theatre and ballets. His album \"Ode to Ireland\" won the award for the best album of the year. His roots are classical music and jazz, but he began to explore many other ethnic traditions. He was also an anticipator of minimalism and many other styles:“The categories of “World” and “New Age” music did not exist when Breschi began his trailblazing journey”.He is also a jazz innovator introducing piano in a creative way, mixing Irish and Flamenco music together with blues. Later he did the same with the Italian Pizzica and Taranta traditional music. He also developed a new trumpet sound mixing Irish sean-nós and blues, as Harry Long describes in his music anthology: “Breschi’s unique approach [...] the playing is superb and his style successfully combines Irish traditional and blues styles”.He has been breaking barriers among many different kinds of music, “yet he was the first to combine Flamenco, Basque, Arabic, Latin and Irish elements, his virtuoso jazz-styled piano uniting these traditions in remarkably original compositions.” With his work \"Orekan: The Ethnic Symphony\" he created a new “symphonic” concept bringing together piano (the top classical instrument which started the new “well tempered” system) with a vast variety of \"not tempered” instruments, belonging to many different ethnic traditions. For many years and predating the times he was gathering together extraordinary musicians from all over the world, and recording more than 25 albums which form \"The Nomadic Piano Collection\".About his ability to anticipate the times, Oliver Sweeney in the Hot Press said about his work Orekan: “Orekan is not only a masterpiece gathered together by the peculiar genius of Antóni O’Breskey; it is above all a unique social document which gives us a strong idea of our roots, and in addition points out a few possible roads we might take in the future”.He is also known to be the inspirer of the show Riverdance:“Bill Whelan developed Breschi’s synthesis of Flamenco, jazz and Irish traditional strands as a key structure in his Irish music and dance spectacular, Riverdance.”;“Well pre-dating Riverdance.”;“Ahead of his time… in 1979 Antóni O’ released a track called “Sunrise”, some of which sounds almost exactly like Riverdance” (Victoria Clarke, Sunday Independent). The track “Sunrise” was composed with the contribution of his great friend and musician Velemir Dugina. For this and many other reasons in various concerts his contribution to Irish music and culture was celebrated in the National Concert Hall in Dublin.In 2008 the Swiss National Radio Television presented his book \"Heyoka: The Soul Shaster\" with a big evening and concert, and through the notes and the reading, recalled and celebrated all his career as composer, performer, music educator, and his social work through music with Italian and Spanish emigrants, contributing hugely to the dialogue among all people and cultures.He has written 4 books: “Ecologia: Salviamo Anche la Musica”, “Semiminime”, “When Bach Was an Irish Man and Mozart a Gipsy Boy” and “Heyoka: Il Giullare dell'Anima”."

  "text" : "Dr. Archibald Keightley (1859–1930) joined the Theosophical Society in 1884. In the London Lodge of the TS at the time were: A.P. Sinnett, Dr. Anna Kingsford, William Kingsland, Prof. William Crookes, Frank Podmore, F.W.H. Myers, Edmund Gurney, Charles Massey. Keightley was a prominent member of the TS who helped in the editing of Helena P. Blavatsky's magnum opus, The Secret Doctrine. He served as the General Secretary of the English Theosophical Society from 1888 to 1890. He was married to Julia van der Planck a.k.a. \"Jasper Niemand\", the author of a number of Theosophical tracts. Bertram Keightley, his uncle (although younger by one year), was also a Theosophist. He later sided with William Quan Judge and his American branch over that led by Annie Besant, and then the faction associated with Ernest Temple Hargrove over that led by Katherine Tingley. After the death of his wife, he relocated to New York City, where he participated in the activities of the \"Hargrove\" branch until his death in 1930."

  "text" : "Armen Terzian (1915–1989) was an American-Armenian American football official in the National Football League (NFL) from 1961 to 1981. He was a field judge and wore uniform number 23, which was later worn by two African-American referees: Johnny Grier, and currently, Jerome Boger. He officiated Super Bowl XI, but Terzian is most remembered from an NFC Divisional Playoff game in 1975 at Metropolitan Stadium between the Minnesota Vikings and the Dallas Cowboys, in which he didn't call an offensive pass interference penalty against Cowboy wide receiver Drew Pearson after there was contact between him and Viking cornerback Nate Wright, who fell. Minutes after Pearson scored the winning touchdown in the final seconds, an angry fan threw a whiskey bottle that hit Terzian in the back of the head, rendering him momentarily unconscious. He did not require stitches, but had to wear a large white bandage around his forehead for the final few seconds remaining in the game. According to Jerry Bergman, one of the officials working the game, said \"The substitute official came in after the kickoff and got $5,500 for working 11 seconds.\" Terzian also became infamous by an NFL Films video that highlighted the league's best-ever coaches in 1981. During a segment that features coaches wired for sound, Marv Levy, then coaching the Kansas City Chiefs, screams, \"Hey Armen! Hey you over-officious jerk!\" at Terzian during a game against the Buffalo Bills in 1978. The game was played at Rich Stadium, the same stadium where Levy would go on to a Pro Football Hall of Fame career as the Bills' coach from 1986 to 1997, leading the once woebegone Bills to four consecutive (losing) Super Bowl appearances. Another non-call ended Terzian's career in the NFL, this time as a replay booth official in a 1988 game between the New York Giants and Dallas Cowboys. Terzian failed to review a play where the on-field officials had erroneously awarded a safety to the New York Giants. Terzian's mistake provided the margin of victory, as the Giants defeated the Cowboys by a score of 12-10. NFL Commissioner Pete Rozelle suspended Terzian for two games following the error, but Terzian chose to resign."

  "text" : "Honorata de la Rama-Hernandez (January 11, 1905 – July 11, 1991), commonly known as Atang de la Rama, was a singer and bodabil performer who became the first Filipina film actress. Atang de la Rama was born in Tondo, Manila on January 11, 1905. By the age of 7, she was already starring in Spanish zarzuelas such as Mascota, Sueño de un Vals, and Marina. At the age of 15, she starred in the sarsuela Dalagang Bukid, where she became known for singing the song, Nabasag na Banga. During the American occupation of the Philippines, Atang de la Rama fought for the dominance of the kundiman, an important Philippine folk song, and the sarsuela, which is a musical play that focused on contemporary Filipino issues such as usury, cockfighting, and colonial mentality. Generations of Filipino artists and audiences consider Atang de la Rama's vocal and acting talents as responsible for much of the success of original Filipino sarsuelas like Dalagang Bukid, and dramas like Veronidia. She has also been a theatrical producer, writer and talent manager. She was the producer and the writer of plays such as Anak ni Eva and Bulaklak ng Kabundukan. For her achievements and contributions to the art form, she was hailed Queen of the Kundiman and of the Sarsuela in 1979, at the age of 74. Atang believed that art should be for everyone; not only did she perform in major Manila theaters such as the Teatro Libertad and the Teatro Zorilla, but also in cockpits and open plazas in Luzon, the Visayas, and Mindanao. She also made an effort to bring the kundiman and sarsuela to the indigenous peoples of the Philippine such as the Igorots, the Aetas, and the Mangyans. She was also at the forefront of introducing Filipino culture to foreign audiences. At the height of her career, she sang kundimans and other Filipino songs in concerts in such cities as Hawaii, San Francisco, Los Angeles, New York City, Hong Kong, Shanghai, and Tokyo. On May 8, 1987, \"for her sincere devotion to original Filipino theater and music, her outstanding artistry as singer, and as sarsuela actress-playwright-producer, her tireless efforts to bring her art to all sectors of Filipino society and to the world,\" President Corazon C. Aquino proclaimed Atang de la Rama a National Artist of the Philippines for Theater and Music. Atang de la Rama died on July 11, 1991. She was married to National Artist for Literature, Amado V. Hernandez."

  "text" : "Agnieszka Lipska Baranowska (1819–1890) was a Polish playwright and poet. Born on 16 April 1819 in Gostków near Łęczyca in a Polish szlachta family of Lipscy to Jacob Lipski and Marjania Zaluska, she spent her life in the Prussian partition, including the Grand Duchy of Posen (Poznań). She had one brother, Konstanty, who died when she was six. She was married in 1838 to Stanisław Baranowski (1806–1843), who was an officer in the Polish forces during the January Uprising. They had four children: \n*  Maria-Antonina Baranowska (1840–1880), mother of noted Pole Rodryg Dunin \n*  Aniela Zofia Baranowska (1842 – c. 1917) (married to Edmund Taczanowski in 1860) \n*  Stefan Baranowski \n*  Stanisława Baranowska (1844–1927) After her husband's death in 1843, while she was pregnant with their daughter Stanisława, she became the head of the family at the age of 24, and took care of their lands in Marszew. She had many friends and colleagues among the Polish writers of the Great Emigration, some of whom visited her manor in Marszew. They included Karol Baliński, Teofil Lenartowicz, Franciszek Mickiewicz and Eweryst Estkowski. She took part in many activities designed to promote Polish culture, and sponsored and organized various festivities or organizations (such as the Society of Scientific Help for Girls (Towarzystwo Pomocy Naukowej dla dziewcząt)). She wrote several plays for the local theater in Pleszew, likely inspired by and with the encouragement of Stanisław Sczaniecki from Karmin. She also wrote many poems, some of which she dedicated to the great Polish poet Adam Mickiewicz. Most of her works were dedicated to rekindling the patriotic spirit of Poles, and used many elements from myths and legends of Greater Poland. Some of them were printed in the women's press (\"Lechu\", \"Dwutygodniku dla Kobiet\"). She died on 15 December 1890 in Posen."

  "text" : "Alfred \"Alfie\" Shrubb (12 December 1879 – 23 April 1964) was an English middle and long distance runner. During an amateur career lasting from 1899 to 1905 (when he was barred from amateur competition for receiving payment for running) and a professional career from 1905 to 1912 he won over 1,000 races of about 1,800 started. At the peak of his career he was virtually unbeatable at distances up to 15 miles, often racing against relay teams so that the race would be more competitive. On 4 November 1904, at Ibrox Park, Glasgow, he broke the one hour run record as well as all amateur records from six to eleven miles, and all professional records from eight to eleven miles, running eleven miles, 1137 yards (18.742 km) in one hour. Altogether he set 28 world records. He raced ten times against the record-holding Canadian First Nations marathoner Tom Longboat, winning all the races shorter than 20 miles and losing all the longer races. In 1908 he became coach of the Harvard University cross-country team, leading it to a national title. From 1919 to 1928 he coached the Oxford University Athletics Club. In 1928 Alfred made his home permanently in Canada, where he operated the Cream of Barley Mill in Bowmanville, Ontario until 1949. He died there in 1964. He is commemorated by the annual Alfie Shrubb Museum Run in Bowmanville, and the annual Alf Shrubb Memorial 5 mile cross-country run in Slinfold."

Andersson set a 1500 metres world record in Gothenburg in August 1943 with a time of 3:45.0 min. He was born in Trollhättan, Sweden. Andersson set three world records in the mile: the first in Stockholm in July 1942 in (4:06.2); this record was broken in the same year by Hägg (4:04.6). Andersson recaptured the world record in Gothenburg in July 1943 (4:02.6), and improved it further in Malmö in July 1944 (4:01.6). However, Hägg had the last word when he ran (4:01.4) in Malmö in 1945 (Hägg's record was not broken until Roger Bannister ran the first sub-4 mile in Oxford in 1954). Andersson won the Svenska Dagbladet Gold Medal in 1943. Andersson won seven national titles: two individual (1500 m, 1943–44) and five in relays (1940–42). In 1946 he was disqualified for violating amateur rules, together with Gunder Hägg and Henry Jonsson."

In 1844 he became an associate of the Old Watercolour Society, progressing to full membership in 1846, and ultimately becoming its secretary from 1870 onward. Following the death of his first wife in 1850, he spent a decade in Italy, where he became friends with Frederick Leighton and Edward Poynter. On his return in 1859 he continued to paint British subjects, with a particular interest in Dorset scenery around Lulworth. He died, aged 72, in London."

  "text" : "Archduke Ferdinand Karl Joseph of Austria-Este (25 April 1781 – 5 November 1850) was the third son of Archduke Ferdinand of Austria-Este and of his wife Princess Maria Beatrice Ricciarda d'Este, last member and heiress of the House of Este. For much of the Napoleonic Wars he was in command of the Austrian army. Ferdinand was born at Milan. He attended the military academy in Wiener Neustadt before embarking on a military career. In 1805 in the war of the Third Coalition against France, Ferdinand was commander-in-chief of the Austrian forces with General Karl Freiherr Mack von Leiberich as his quartermaster general. In October his army was surrounded at Ulm. General Mack surrendered, but Ferdinand managed to escape with 2000 cavalry to Bohemia. There he took command of the Austrian troops and raised the local militia. With a total of 9,000 men he set out for Iglau to distract attention from the Coalition's movements. He succeeded in holding the Bavarian division of Prince Karl Philipp von Wrede in Iglau thereby and preventing it from joining the Battle of Austerlitz. In 1809 in the war of the Fifth Coalition against France, Ferdinand commanded an Austrian army of 36,000 men. In April he invaded the Duchy of Warsaw hoping to encourage a local uprising against Napoleon (see Polish–Austrian War). But the Poles rallied to Prince Józef Antoni Poniatowski. Ferdinand was defeated at the Battle of Raszyn, but managed to occupy Warsaw. In June, however, Ferdinand was compelled to withdraw from Warsaw, and to give up Kraków and Galicia as well. In 1815 in the war of the Seventh Coalition against France, Ferdinand commanded two divisions of the Austrian Reserve. The following year he was appointed military commander in Hungary. In 1830 Ferdinand was appointed military and civil governor of Galicia, taking up residence in Lviv. After the Revolution of 1848 he resided mostly in Italy. Ferdinand never married. In 1850 he died at Schloss Ebenzweier in Altmünster near Gmunden, Austria."

  "text" : "Aurel Boleslav Stodola (10 May 1859, Liptovský Mikuláš, Slovakia – 25 December 1942 Zürich, Switzerland) was a Slovak engineer, physicist, and inventor. He was a pioneer in the area of technical thermodynamics and its applications and published his book Die Dampfturbine (the steam turbine) in 1903. In addition to the thermodynamic issues involved in turbine design the book discussed aspects of fluid flow, vibration, stress analysis of plates, shells and rotating discs and stress concentrations at holes and fillets. Stodola was a professor of mechanical engineering at the Swiss Polytechnical Institute (now ETH) in Zurich. One of his students was Albert Einstein. In 1892, Stodola founded the Laboratory for Energy Conversion."

  "text" : "August Emil Daniel Ferdinand Wilhelmj (German pronunciation: [vɪlˈhɛlmi]; 21 September 1845 in Usingen – 22 January 1908 in London) was a German violinist and teacher. Wilhelmj was considered a child prodigy. When Henriette Sontag heard him in 1852, when he was seven, she said \"You will be the German Paganini\". In 1861, Franz Liszt heard him and sent him to Ferdinand David with a letter containing the words \"Let me present you the future Paganini!\". His teachers included: Ferdinand David, for the violin, Moritz Hauptmann, for music theory and composition, and Joachim Raff for composition. A personal friend of Wagner, he led the violins at the première of Der Ring des Niebelungen in Bayreuth in 1876. He visited Australia in 1881, playing in the old Freemasons' Hall, but though appreciated by those who attended his concerts, their number was not sufficient to make the tour a financial success. It was not until introduced to London audiences by Jenny Lind in 1886 that Wilhelmj became a \"household name\". He has become famous for his late nineteenth century arrangement of the second movement of J. S. Bach's Orchestral Suite No. 3 for violin and piano, known as Air on the G String and for his re-orchestration of the 1st movement of Niccolò Paganini's Violin Concerto No.1 in D major Op.6 (1883/84). From 1894 on he was a Professor of violin at the Guildhall School of Music and Drama. Among his pupils were American violinist Nahan Franko, Canadian musician Donald Heins, and the Australian conductor Aylmer Buesst. Wilhelmj owned a Stradivarius 1725 violin from 1866 until his retirement, which later came to be known by his name. His 1785 Guadagnini was later owned (as \"ex-Wilhelmj\") by Jack Liebeck."

Hassoun, a Lebanese-born Palestinian who first moved to the United States in the late 1980s, was first arrested in 2002 for overstaying his visa. Hassoun was a computer programmer and resident of Broward County, Florida. Sofian Abdelaziz, a member of the American Muslim Association of North America, who knew Hassoun from his activity in the Florida Muslim community, made this comment on Hassoun: \"I would consider him that he's against violence, but he has a strong tongue, you know, he has a strong tongue!\" Hassoun has been accused of financing Jose Padilla's trip to Egypt. Hassoun has also been accused of setting up a local office of the charity Benevolence International, which has fallen under suspicions of having been used as a front for al Qaeda. A 2011 NPR report claimed he was in a highly restrictive Communication Management Unit."

  "text" : "Alberto T. Arai (March 29, 1915 – May 25, 1959) was a Mexican architect, theorist and writer, of Japanese descent. Born in Mexico City, the fourth son of a Japanese ambassador in Mexico, Dr. Kinta Arai, Alberto T. Arai studied also philosophy, espousing Neo-Kantianism and becoming politically a socialist artist. He became a supporter of Functionalism, with its emphasis on the social applications of architecture, and was also a founder, with Enrique Yañez, of the Unión de Arquitectos Socialistas (1938), helping to draw up a socialist theory of architecture. He was one of the most active participants and attempted to put his socialist theory into practice on two unexecuted projects in the same year: the building for the Confederation of Mexican Workers and the Ciudad Obrera de México, both with Enrique Guerrero and Raúl Cacho (1937), and his social worries on the unexecuted General Hospital project (to be built in the city of Leon, Gto). He was one of the commissioners to take topographical records from the recent discovered Mayan ruins of Bonampak, in an expedition organized by the National Institute of Fine Arts (1949). His urbanistic knowledge give him the opportunity to make urban planning to several cities along the country. Also he developed the theory of architectural regionalism, which attempt the use of material resources and take care of the human needs of each particular area. Later, when Mexico opted for a developmental policy, Arai became a standard-bearer for nationalism in architecture. He re-evaluated traditional building materials, such as tree trunks, bamboo, palm leaves and lianas, using them in a plan for a country house that was adapted to the warm, damp climate of the Papaloapan region, and various essays to improve the country and popular houses. The building of the Ciudad Universitaria, Mexico City, gave him his greatest architectural opportunity when he designed the \"Frontones\" de Ciudad Universitaria (1952). In these he used the volcanic stone of the area to great effect in truncated pyramid shapes inspired by Pre-Columbian pyramids. This was his contribution to the early landscaping-architecture, by using the volcanoes surrounding the view as a theme for his design. His numerous books and articles addressed conceptual problems in Mexican architecture and art. His last building was the clubhouse (Kaikan) of the Japanese Association, see Japanese community of Mexico City, who was inspired on ancient Japanese and ancient Mexican architectural design, but with modern techniques and materials, successfully a modern looking piece."

Ahmad's paternal grandfather, Ali Akbar Farahani, was also a talented musician. Ahmad started learning music at an early age. At the age of seven, he was able to play tombak to accompany his father. Unfortunately he lost his father soon thereafter, but continued his education with his sisters, especially Moloud Khanom. He became one of the best setar players of all time. For years he played on Iranian radio especially in a program called Golha, produced by Davood Pirnia. Ebadi had a unique style in playing the setar. He also invented a variety of different tunings for setar. He died in 1992 and is buried in Emamzadeh Taher Cemetery in Karaj."

  "text" : "Abraham Zabludovsky (born Abraham Zabludowski Kraveski; June 14, 1924 – April 10, 2003) was a Mexican architect. He was the brother of the well-known journalist Jacobo Zabludovsky. Abraham Zabludovsky was born in Białystok, Poland. He studied at the Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México, graduating in 1949. In his early years he produced a large number of outstanding residential buildings and offices in Mexico City, making rigorous use of the International style and demonstrating an impeccable handling of contemporary design, techniques and materials. Also notable from this period was the Centro Cívico Cinco de Mayo (1962), Puebla, on which he collaborated with Guillermo Rossell. In 1968 Zabludovsky began working in collaboration with Teodoro González de León, although the two architects continued to work on some projects individually and retained their separate stylistic identities. Their collaborative work was remarkable for its quality and maturity, establishing functional and formal solutions that were later widely imitated. Clear examples of their characteristic proposals for constructions of massive, linear volume are the Delegación Cuauhtémoc (1972–3; with Jaime Ortiz Monasterio (b 1928) and Luis Antonio Zapiain (b 1942)), the headquarters of INFONAVIT (Instituto del Fondo Nacional de la Vivienda para los Trabajadores, completed 1975) and the new building for the Colegio de México (1974–5; see MEXICO, fig. 7), all in Mexico City. Zabludovsky also carried out a number of works individually in the same style. Outstanding among these was the Centro Cultural Emilio O. Rabasa (1983), Tuxtla Gutiérrez, Chiapas, a construction with sculptural aspects that manages faithfully to fulfil the need for both theatricality and diffusion. He also designed two multipurpose auditoriums in Celaya and Dolores Hidalgo, Guanajuato (1990), two theatres in Guanajuato, Guanajuato, and Aguascalientes, Aguascalientes (1991), and a convention centre in Tuxtla Gutiérrez, Chiapas (1994). He died in Mexico City, aged 78."

  "text" : "Alejandro Zohn (born Alexander Zohn; born 8 August 1930, in Vienna - 2000, in Guadalajara) was a Mexican architect. He was a Holocaust survivor who grew up in Western Mexico. Alejandro Zohn studied at the Universidad de Guadalajara, Mexico, graduating as an engineer in 1955 and as an architect in 1963. His abilities as an engineer are reflected in several bold and ingenious structures. Notable examples are the acoustic shell (1958) in Agua Azul Park, the Libertad Market (1959) and the 'Adolfo López Mateos' sports centre (1962), all in Guadalajara. The market is especially noteworthy for its roof of hyperbolic paraboloids, which allow for wide areas without supports. He also built residential blocks, paying careful attention to details of interior functionality, the durability and maintenance of materials and residents’ individuality. The housing complex 'CTM-Atemajac' (1979), Guadalajara, is one of his main achievements in this area, comprising several buildings with brick facing, none more than five stories. Among his numerous other designs in Guadalajara, the most notable are the Banco Refaccionario de Jalisco (1973), the Plaza del Sol, the 'Mulbar' shopping centre and car park and the Archivo del Estado de Jalisco building (1989). The latter is in exposed concrete and has a minimum of openings, emotional style and has affinities with the vernacular architecture of the Jalisco area."

  "text" : "Alex Sanders (6 June 1926 – 30 April 1988), born Orrell Alexander Carter, who went under the craft name Verbius, was an English occultist and High Priest in the Pagan religion of Wicca, responsible for founding the tradition of Alexandrian Wicca during the 1960s. Raised in a working-class family, he was introduced to esoteric ideas by his mother and grandmother from a young age, and as a young man began working as a medium in the local Spiritualist Churches before going on to study and practice ceremonial magic. In 1963, he was initiated into Gardnerian Wicca before founding his own coven, through which he merged many aspects of ceremonial magic into Wicca. He claimed to have been initiated by his Grandmother as a child, though evidence for this is lacking. Throughout the 1960s, he would court publicity in the press, appearing in a number of documentaries, marrying the far younger Maxine Sanders, and being declared to be the \"King of the Witches\" by his followers, something that led to other prominent Gardnerian Witches, such as Patricia Crowther and Eleanor Bone, attacking him in the press. In the late 1970s and 1980s, he went on to work with a ceremonial magical group known as the Ordine Della Luna, prior to his death. The tradition he founded with Maxine Sanders became known as Alexandrian Wicca."

Azam was introduced to squash by his older brother, Hashim Khan, who was also one of the world's top squash players in his time. After winning the British Open in 1951, Hashim recruited Azam as his practice partner in the summer of 1952. (The British Open was considered to be the effective world championship of the sport at the time.) Azam progressed so quickly under his older brother's tutelage that he would go on to face Hashim in the final of the 1954 British Open, which Hashim won in five sets. Azam was also runner-up to Hashim at the British Open in 1955 and 1958. Azam then went on to win four consecutive British Open titles in 1959-62. He also won the US Open in 1962. Later that year, a ruptured Achilles tendon effectively ended his career. After his playing career, Azam settled in the United Kingdom. Today, he owns and runs the New Grampians Squash Club in London. His granddaughter Carla Khan is currently a professional squash player on the international circuit. Azam was the second cousin of the two other leading Pakistani players of his time Roshan Khan and Nasrullah Khan, whose sons Rehmat Khan, Torsam Khan and Jahangir Khan are also squash players. He is the uncle of Sharif Khan and Aziz."

  "text" : "Abdylas Maldybaevich Maldybaev (Kyrgyz: Абдылас Малдыбаев, Abdılas Maldıbayev/Aвdьlas Maldьвajev; 1906 – 1978) was a Kyrgyz composer, actor, and operatic tenor singer. Maldybaev was one of the composers of the state anthem of the Kirghiz SSR and is still renowned for his operatic composition. He helped popularize Kyrgyz music by skillfully using Western European techniques. The Kyrgyz one som banknote pictures him. Maldybayev provided folk melodies and composed music which was organized and prepared by Russian composers Vladimir Vlasov and Vladimir Fere into six Soviet state opera and other works. Their first full opera was Ai-churek. The collective is usually hyphenated as Vlasov-Fere-Maldybayev, which also composed the Kirghiz national anthem."

  "text" : "Alexandre \"Sacha\" Gaydamak (Hebrew: אלכסנדר גאידמק‎‎, born May 1976 in France) is a French and Israeli businessman. A member of the wealthy Gaydamak family, he is the son of Arcadi Gaydamak. In January 2006 he announced that he was following his father into association football club ownership by becoming co-owner of English Premier League club Portsmouth F.C. with Milan Mandarić. His father is the owner of Israeli side Beitar Jerusalem. In July 2006 Alexandre Gaydamak became the sole owner of Portsmouth, although Mandaric remained at the club as non-executive chairman until later that year. Gaydamak owns a Luxembourg-based company, Belvia S.a.r.l. and a British Virgin Islands company, Devondale Investments, which owned Portsmouth F.C. On 21 July 2009, Gaydamak agreed to sell Portsmouth F.C. to Sulaiman Al Fahim in principle, and therefore stepped down from the board. He remained the owner of the club until the details of the sale had been finalised on 8 June 2009. Gaydamak has been alleged to have asset stripped Portsmouth F.C. before this sale and yet still retains a claim, said to be £32,000,000, against the club as a creditor despite the huge debts at the club. Investigations into these allegations are ongoing. On 22 October 2010 Gaydamak's business acumen came into question after reports of him demanding a payment from his former club Portsmouth for an apparent £2.5million. It seems that he was unsure that his unpaid debt would be repaid. The case was made more embarrassing after Portsmouth F.C had received confirmation several times from Gaydamak himself that the terms were agreed and that he was a secured creditor meaning that not only would be paid in full, but he would also be paid before many unsecured creditors who are set to only receive 20% of any debt."

Nguema shares ownership of Triple Options, a security company with du Toit. The president's son and likely heir, Teodorín Nguema Obiang, reportedly attacked his uncle after discovering the link. Armengol also owns vast properties in Virginia. He is bitterly opposed to the succession of his nephew to the presidency, and presents himself as a stalking horse contender.

He is best known for his theory of dynamic nuclear polarization, also known as the Overhauser Effect. Born in San Diego, California, Overhauser attended high school in San Francisco at Lick-Wilmerding High School and began his undergraduate work at the University of California, Berkeley in 1942. He interrupted his studies during World War II for a two-year stint in the U.S. Navy Reserve, then returned to Berkeley to complete his education. In 1948 he received undergraduate degrees in physics and mathematics, and in 1951 he received a Ph.D. in physics. From 1951 to 1953, he was a post-doctoral researcher at the University of Illinois, where he developed an important theory on the transfer of spin polarization; once the theory had been confirmed and demonstrated by other scientists, it became known as the Overhauser Effect. He was on the faculty at Cornell University from 1953 to 1958, and then left to join the research staff at Ford Motor Company. Overhauser remained at Ford until 1973, when he joined the faculty at Purdue University. He remained at Purdue as the Stuart Distinguished Professor of Physics for the rest of his career. Overhauser died in 2011 in West Lafayette, Indiana. He was 86."

  "text" : "Rupert \"Alister\" Halls Taylor (born 1943) is an innovative and controversial New Zealand publisher. He published The Little Red Schoolbook in the 1970s (widely criticised for its subversive content), and Tim Shadbolt's autobiographical Bullshit and Jellybeans, as well as significant works on artists C. F. Goldie and Gustavus von Tempsky. Notorious in the New Zealand publishing industry for paying his debts slowly, if at all, he was bankrupted in the early 1980s at the instigation of the Publishers' Association. Discharged ten years later, he began a new publishing venture, reissuing some of his earlier publications in edited and updated form. Together with two other editors, he edited the 12th edition of Who's Who in New Zealand. He then established New Zealand Who's Who Aotearoa, with the first volume published in 1992. In 2001 he featured in the London Daily Mirror Sorted column by Penman & Greenwood - the report headlined \"Full medal racket\" alleged that Taylor had targeted national heroes in a publishing con. In 2005 he was again in financial difficulty when the New South Wales Department of Fair Trading was granted an injunction banning him from marketing a range of non-existent publications about prominent Australians. The Supreme Court found that he had solicited fees from Australians to be included in a publication entitled the Australian Roll of Honour series, which did not exist. His partner from 1978 to 2004 was the journalist and politician Deborah Coddington, with whom he had three children."

  "text" : "Albert Leffingwell, M.D. (1845–1916) was an American physician, social reformer, and vocal advocate for vivisection reform. He authored many books bringing light to the cruel abuses of animal experimentation and calling for regulation. At the same time he sought middle ground between the anti-vivisection societies which called for the abolition of all experimentation and those who rejected any restraints. Leffingwell also was concerned with meat safety, believing that lax regulations, in particular allowing cancerous animals into the food chain, were responsible for increases in the incidence of cancer. He also served as the president of the American Humane Association."

  "text" : "Alexander Borisovich Lakier (Russian: Лакиер, Александр Борисович) (1825-1870) was a Russian historian of German descent who was interested in heraldry. Alexander Lakier was born in the city of Taganrog in 1825. His father, Boris Lakier, a convert from Judaism, was the doctor who certified the death of the late Russian Emperor Alexander I of Russia who died in Taganrog in 1825. Lakier graduated from the Legal Dept. of the Moscow University and defended his thesis with On Domains and Estates (O Votchinah i Pomestyakh) released in Saint Petersburg in 1848. In 1856-1858, Lakier traveled across Europe, Palestine and the United States of America. He kept a travel diary, fragments of which were published in Sovremennik (1858) and The Russian Messenger (1858) and were later included in the book The Travel Through North American States, Canada and Cuba, which was published in Saint Petersburg in 1859. In 1858, Alexander Lakier entered the Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs, where he was involved in statistics work and worked as editor in the commission on liberation of peasants. In 1860, he returned to Taganrog, where he worked as lawyer. Alexander Lakier published The History of Russian Sovereigns' Titles (1847), On Service in Russia before Peter The Great Times (Saint Petersburg, 1850), Review of Relations between Russia and England in 16th and 17th Centuries (1854) and other. His most famous work was \"Russian Heraldry\" (Saint Petersburg, 1855). This oeuvre is still a valuable reference, where Lakier made an attempt to analyze and explain coats of arms of Russian dukes and nobility. The volume also featured the history of Russian stamps - unique until the early 20th century."

  "text" : "Albert Girard (French pronunciation: ​[alˈbɛʁ ʒiˈʁaʁ]) (1595 in Saint-Mihiel, France − 8 December 1632 in Leiden) was a French-born mathematician. He studied at the University of Leiden. He \"had early thoughts on the fundamental theorem of algebra\" and gave the inductive definition for the Fibonacci numbers.He was the first to use the abbreviations 'sin', 'cos' and 'tan' for the trigonometric functions in a treatise. Girard was the first to state, in 1632, that each prime of the form 1 mod 4 is the sum of two squares. (See Fermat's theorem on sums of two squares.) It was said that he was quiet-natured and, unlike most mathematicians, did not keep a journal for his personal life. In the opinion of Charles Hutton, Girard was ...the first person who understood the general doctrine of the formation of the coefficients of the powers from the sum of the roots and their products. He was the first who discovered the rules for summing the powers of the roots of any equation. This had previously been given by François Viète for positive roots, and is today called Viète's formulas, but Viète did not give these for general roots. In his paper, Funkhouser locates the work of Girard in the history of the study of equations using symmetric functions. In his work on the theory of equations, Lagrange cited Girard. Still later, in the nineteenth century, this work eventuated in the creation of group theory by Cauchy, Galois and others. Girard also showed how the area of a spherical triangle depends on its interior angles. The result is called Girard's theorem. He also was a lutenist and mentioned having written a treatise on music, though this was never published."

  "text" : "Agnes Maule Machar (23 January 1837 – 24 January 1927) was a Canadian author and social reformer. Machar's father, John Machar immigrated to Canada in 1827, and married Margaret Sim (a fellow Scottish immigrant) in Montreal in 1832. The couple established themselves in Kingston, Ontario (then part of Upper Canada), where her father was the pastor of St. Andrew's Church. The couple's first child died in infancy; Agnes was born in 1837; and her brother, John Maule, in 1841. Apart from a brief stint at a boarding school in Montreal, Machar was educated by her father at home. By the age of ten Machar was studying Latin and Greek, instructed by her father and aided by his extensive library. Soon after she learned French, Greek and Italian. Machar moved in influential social circles, mingling with future prime minister John A. Macdonald, politicians like Richard John Cartwright, and professors at Queen's University such as George Romanes. At her summer home in Gananoque she hosted an array of international luminaries such as Daniel James Macdonnell and Emily Pauline Johnson. Machar was a prolific writer. Her first published book, Faithful Unto Death, was a memorial to a janitor at Queen's, published in 1859. Her 1870 novel, Katie Johnstone's Cross, won the Campbell's Prize (offered by Toronto publisher James Campbell and Son), and she won the same prize again the next year for Lucy Raymond. In 1874 she received another prize, this time for For King and Country, awarded by The Canadian Monthly and National Review; the novel is probably her best known work. Writing under her own name, and the pseudonym Fidelis, Machar published at least eight novels, a biography of her father, and many poems and essays. An anthology of her poetry, Lays of the \"True North\" and Other Canadian Poems was published in 1899, and she coauthored six historical works. As an essayist, Machar frequently wrote about challenges faced by Christianity in the face of rapidly advancing scientific knowledge. Her friends included prominent Darwinists such as George Romanes and Grant Allen, and she wrote that Christians should accept evolutionary theory as part of an adapting and fuller understanding of God's word. Secularist William Dawson LeSueur, although he disagreed with her, praised her arguments. Machar also advocated for churches to deliver more charity to the poor, especially during the depressions of the late 19th century. She was particularly critical of the hypocrisy she saw where churches worked to save the souls of the poor, while disregarding their physical needs. She argued for justice, a right to work, and sufficient means to rise above a subsistence existence. Beyond her essays, she also explored these themes in her well-received 1892 novel, Roland Graeme, Knight. Machar also advocated for prohibition and proposed that the state should establish homes for the care of impoverished elderly citizens, whom she described as \"veteran[s] in the industrial army.\" She dedicated her own resources to this cause, bequeathing an endowment to establish the Agnes Maule Machar Home in Kingston \"for old ladies past earning their own livelihood.\" A witness to Confederation, Machar was concerned about English–French tensions in the young country. She wrote poetry, fiction, and historical accounts of French achievements in Canada. She also wrote (unsuccessful) letters and essays pleading for clemency for Louis Riel, and, after World War I, compiled and translated letters from French soldiers who had died in the conflict. As a feminist, Machar argued in favour of higher education and fair working conditions for women. She advocated for better conditions for women and children in shops and factories, as well as for legislation requiring shorter hours for women workers. This last demand was challenged by fellow-feminist Carrie Matilda Derick who argued that it was inconsistent with the goal of gender equality. Machar died in Kingston in 1927."

  "text" : "Alexandru Dimitrie Xenopol (Romanian pronunciation: [alekˈsandru diˈmitri.e kseˈnopol]; March 23, 1847, Iaşi – February 27, 1920, Bucharest) was a Romanian scholar, economist, philosopher, historian, professor, sociologist, and author. Among his many major accomplishments, he is the Romanian historian credited with authoring the first major synthesis of the history of the Romanian people. Born in Iaşi, where he graduated from high school, he went on to Vienna in 1870 to study law and then to Berlin, where he studied philosophy. In 1868, he made his debut in Convorbiri Literare with a series of studies on Romanian traditions and on Romanian institutions. At first, Xenopol served as a prosecutor in Iaşi, but he later decided to dedicate himself to the study of history. Starting in 1883, he was a professor of universal history at the University of Iaşi, where he served as rector from 1898 to 1901. He was named a member of the Romanian Academy in 1895. In his 1899 French-language Les Principes fondamentaux de l'histoire (\"The Fundamental Principles of History\"), his work most well-known internationally, he argued for history being a true science which follows clearly defined laws and logic, through which the reasons for historical processes could be clearly defined. His six-volume Istoria românilor din Dacia-Traiană (\"The History of the Romanians in Trajan's Dacia\"), completed between 1888 and 1893, strongly asserts that the Romanians are of predominantly Roman origin - a position further elaborated by the historian Nicolae Iorga, one of Xenopol's numerous pupils (see Origin of the Romanians). Concerning events nearly two millennia in the past and being supported by multiple archaeological findings, it was still contested by some historians. It had, however, very concrete political implications - the Roman origin implying that Romanians are inherently different from - and in the minds of some Romanian nationalists, superior to - their Slavic and Magyar neighbors. This, despite his disagreement with radical nationalists and objection to violence against Jews, unfortunately also translated to Xenopol being a noted anti-Semite and collaborator of A. C. Cuza. Though he died before the formation of the Iron Guard, Romania's notorious Fascist party, he is considered to be one of its sources of inspiration - according to the final report of the International Commission on the Holocaust in Romania."

  "text" : "Alfred Ollivant (1798 – 16 December 1882) was an academic who went on to become Bishop of Llandaff. Born in Manchester, he was educated at St Paul's School and Trinity College, Cambridge. He won the Tyrwhitt Hebrew scholarship in 1822 and was elected to a fellowship at Trinity College. In 1827, he was appointed the first vice-principal of St David's College, Lampeter. Whilst at Lampeter, he found time to learn the Welsh language and he preached regularly in that language at Llangeler, where he later became vicar. He returned to Cambridge in 1843 as Regius Professor of Divinity, but in 1849 he was nominated to the see of Llandaff, primarily because of his knowledge of Wales and of the Welsh language. Ollivant was instrumental in the move to construct churches (often by private benefactions from industrialists and landowners) in the newly populated areas of his diocese. As Bishop of Llandaff, Ollivant wrote a book, Some Account of the Condition of the Fabric of Llandaff Cathedral, from 1575 to the present time, intended to raise funds to reestablish a choir at Llandaff Cathedral, where there had been none since 1691, and to purchase an organ for the cathedral, which had been without one for some time. He died on 16 December 1882, and was buried on 21 December in the Cathedral grounds. A monument of his image was placed in the chancel of the Cathedral, near the high altar, and remarkably it escaped damage when the cathedral was bombed in 1941."

In 1901 he participated in a Dutch solar eclipse expedition to Karang Sago, Sumatra. He was noted for his observations of variable stars, and published a number of papers on the subject in Astronomische Nachrichten, and elsewhere, from 1917 until 1936. He proposed naming variable stars in each constellation using a simple numbering system beginning with V1, V2, ... and so forth. However the double-letter system starting with RR was already inwidespread use. As a result, variable stars after QZ were numbered according to Nijland's system beginning with V335. In 1923 Nijland became member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences. The crater Nijland on the Moon is named after him."

  "text" : "Avigdor Dagan (Viktor Fischl, June 30, 1912 in Hradec Králové, Austria-Hungary - May 28, 2006, Israel) was an Israeli writer, a playwright and literary translator; a diplomat. Prior to adopting the Hebraic name in 1955, his name was Viktor Fischl; Dagan, being related to the Hebrew word dag (fish), is an approximate translation of Fischl as a diminutive of \"fish\". After graduating from the Charles University in Prague, he entered the diplomatic service. In 1939 he emigrated to the United Kingdom to escape the Nazis, where he became an associate to Jan Masaryk. After the end of the war, he returned home, but on the 1948 coup d'état emigrated to Israel, thereafter changing his name to the one he held through the end of his life. In Israel he continued his diplomatic career becoming plenipotentiary; he was the first Israeli ambassador in Vienna in 1956, the ambassador in Norway and Poland. At the same time he continued writing in Czech. Most of his prose was first published in Israel, some in England or in the US. In 1990 he visited his homeland for the first time since his fleeing for refuge. After a long break, publication resumed in his home country, and his works received broader recognition. He was awarded the honorary doctorate from the Charles University. Although he was able to be employed as a diplomat and produce output as an author at the same time, from 1977 onward he devoted his time solely to writing. In his lifelong literary career, he started out as a poet, then later became known as a writer of collections of short stories and novels. He is known for his modern Czech translations of Psalms and the Song of Songs. His works were translated from Czech into Hebrew as well as other languages; his best known novel Dvorní šašci (The Court Jesters) was translated into 12 languages."

Known as Père, he would never refuse a deserving student an education - even if that meant tuition was paid in potatoes and wheat rather than dollars and cents. Leading the college until his death, he influenced generations of Canadians and the development of Canadian hockey. Said Père Murray, \"I love God, Canada and hockey -- not always in that order.\" The ice hockey team is known as the Notre Dame Hounds. More than 100 former Hounds have been drafted by National Hockey League including Wendel Clark, Curtis Joseph, Rod Brind'Amour, Brad Richards and Vincent Lecavalier. The Saskatchewan Hockey Association's Athol Murray Trophy is named in his honour. Murray played a central role in supporting the 1962 strike by Saskatchewan doctors, who were attempting to scuttle the single-payer medical insurance system introduced by the Woodrow Lloyd government earlier that year."

  "text" : "Adalgis or Adelchis (died 788) was an associate king of the Lombards from August 759, reigning with his father, Desiderius, until their deposition in June 774. His mother was Ansa. He is remembered today primarily as the hero of the play Adelchi (1822) by Alessandro Manzoni. When in 773 the Lombard kingdom was invaded by Charlemagne, the king of the Franks, Desiderius stayed in Pavia, the capital, where he unsuccessfully resisted a siege. Adalgis instead took refuge in Verona, where he sheltered the widow and children of Charlemagne's younger brother, Carloman I, who had entered an Italian monastery after abdicating the kingship. Even before the fall of Pavia, when the Frankish army approached Verona, Adalgis did not resist. He escaped to Constantinople, where he was received by the Byzantine emperor Constantine V, who raised him to the patriciate. Adalgis hoped to return to re-conquer Italy, and solicited help from Duke Arechis II of Benevento for this purpose. Many Lombards refused to submit to Frankish rule, believing that Adalgis's return was imminent. The historian Paul the Deacon reflected a widespread belief among the Lombards when he wrote, as part of his poetic epigraph for the tomb of Ansa, that \"in her, by Christ, the greatest hope of the Lombards spent a time.\" Einhard, Charlemagne's biographer, also records that \"on [Adalgis] all hope seemed to incline\" (in quem spes omnium inclinatae videbantur). Only in 787, after the efforts of the Empress Irene to obtain the hand in marriage of Charlemagne's daughter Rotrude for her son, Constantine VI, did the Byzantines move to give Adalgis the military assistance he required. An expeditionary corps was placed under the command of the saccellarius and logotheta Ihoannes and augmented by troops from Sicily under the patrikios Theodoros. The Byzantine army landed in Calabria towards the end of 788, but was met by the united armies of the Lombard dukes Hildeprand of Spoleto and Grimoald III of Benevento, who had succeeded his father, Arechis, and made peace with the Franks. These Lombard forces were accompanied by Frankish troops under Winiges. In the ensuing battle the Byzantines were defeated, but there is no further record of the fate of Adalgis."

  "text" : "Antonio Scarfoglio (1886–1969), Neapolitan journalist and author. Antonio Scarfoglio was the son of Edoardo Scarfoglio and Matilde Serao, both well-known Neapolitan writers of the turn of the 20th century and founders of il Mattino, the large Neapolitan daily newspaper. He broke into reporting with a dramatic account of the devastating 1906 eruption of Mt. Vesuvius. In 1908 he was one of the three-man team that manned the Züst, the Italian entry in the six-car around-the-word automobile race, known as The Great Race. The Italian car was one of the eventual three finishers. Scarfoglio wrote a book about that exploit: Il giro del mondo in automobile (Round the World in a Motor-Car) published in 1909. He then reported on the great earthquake in Messina in December, 1908, and in June of the following year reported from Adana, Turkey, on the infamous massacre of the Armenian population. In 1910 he published a widely read interview in the Paris paper, Le Matin, with empress Eugenie, the wife of Napoleon III; he co-founded a film journal, L'arte muta (The Silent Art) in 1915 and in 1924 was responsible for producing Italy's first newspaper photo supplement section, il Mattino Illustrato, using the new rotogravure printing process. In general, he is viewed as one who took advantage of the good fortune of living in the same age as prominent literary and political figures of the young nation-state of modern Italy such as D'Annunzio and Crispi in order to help shape early Italian journalism."

  "text" : "Adolphe Blanc (24 June 1828 – May 1885) was a French composer of chamber music. Blanc was born in Manosque, Alpes-de-Haute-Provence. At the age of 13 he was sent to study violin at the Paris Conservatoire. Though he studied under Fromental Halévy, and though his one-act comic opera Les Deux Billets was performed in 1868, Blanc's refined music lies in the Romantic Viennese tradition of hausmusik for private performance, music that was essentially peripheral to the public musical life of contemporary Paris, centered on opera, and Blanc has been largely overlooked. There are three string trios, four string quartets, seven string quintets of various configurations, 15 piano trios, piano quartets and quintets as well as settings and arrangements, songs, pieces for piano and violin, choral works and some orchestral works. He was conductor at the Théâtre Lyrique in Paris, 1855 – 1860, and died in Paris. None of his music, save perhaps the Septet opus 40, can be called familiar. The following have been recorded: \n* Trio for piano, clarinet and cello op. 23 \n* Quintet for piano, flute, clarinet, horn and bassoon op. 37 \n* Septet for clarinet, horn, bassoon, violin, viola, cello and double bass, op. 40 (1860) \n* Sonatine concertante for two pianos, op. 64"

  "text" : "Albert Tyler (June 26, 1906 – 1968) was an American biologist whose research was focused on reproductive biology and development in marine organisms. Tyler was born in Brooklyn, New York. He attended Columbia University majoring in chemistry. When he started graduate studies he took interest in the work of Thomas Hunt Morgan. Morgan took Tyler, and several other graduate students and research fellows with him, to the California Institute of Technology when he was hired to establish the new Division of Biology. Tyler completed his Ph.D. studies on reproductive biology and was appointed to the faculty at Caltech. Tyler's research looked at development and differentiation of embryos from a range of marine organisms. He made early use of immunohistochemical techniques and was one of the first researchers to recognize that maternal messenger RNA present in the ovum could affect differentiation. His research on nucleic acid and protein synthesis in sea urchin eggs was cut short when he died unexpectedly in 1968."

Granot's use of Hebrew inscriptions, handcut in calligraphic letters in his Jewish papercuts, is an integral part of his work. Many of the texts relate to Jerusalem, Judaism and Israel. Recent works include his Papercut Haggadah on which he worked for nearly a decade. The Haggadah consists of 55 individual works in which all elements, text as well as design, have been cut by scalpel."

  "text" : "Alma Johansson (1880-1974) was a Swedish missionary who worked in the city of Mush in the Ottoman Empire at the beginning of the 20th century. In 1901, the Missionary Society of Swedish women sent Johansson to Mush (Western Armenia), where she stayed until December, 1915. She worked at a German orphanage for Armenian children. On the outbreak of World War I, the atrocities against the empire's Christian minorities escalated and she became an eyewitness to these crimes against humanity. She wrote about her experiences in a book called Ett folk i landsflykt: Ett år ur armeniernas historia (\"A People in Exile: One Year in the Life of the Armenians\", Stockholm: Kvinnliga missions arbetare, 1930), both of which were translated into Armenian and French. She also made testimonies to German and American diplomats who published them later. Alma told about how women took poison so they wouldn’t be captured by the Turks, and how the soldiers transported bloody, wounded women and children through the city while other soldiers fired at them just to frighten. When the wounded fell to the ground, the soldiers would hit them with the butt ends of their rifles. \"I can never forget the sight. And nothing could you do for them!\" she wrote. She gave information about how the kids at the orphanage were handed over to a Turkish officer, and then taken to a building outside the city where they all were murdered. In 1923 Johansson moved to Salonika, and established a factory for more than 200 Armenian refugee women. She also founded an Armenian kindergarten and primary school in Charilaos (Greece). In 1997, the Johansson festival was organized in Yerevan. In 2005, on the 90th anniversary of the Armenian Genocide, a group of Swedish Armenians visited Alma Johansson's grave at Skogskyrkogården in Enskede, outside Stockholm, to remember these horrifying events and to honour her efforts. This commemoration has since theh become a standing event and part of the annual commemoration program. About Johansson and four European humanist women's lives and activities tells film \"Map of Salvation\" (2015)."

  "text" : "Roy Anthony \"Tony\" McNeill (1941–1996) was a Jamaican poet, considered one of the most promising West Indian writers of his generation, whose career was cut short by his early death. McNeill was born in Kingston, Jamaica and educated at Excelsior School and St. George's College (where he was already known to his friends as a poet) before leaving to study in the United States. He studied creative writing at Johns Hopkins University and the University of Massachusetts Amherst, from which he graduated with a PhD. He returned to Jamaica in 1975, where he worked as a journalist and assistant editor of the Jamaica Journal (1975–81), as well as in a variety of other jobs, including civil servant, encyclopedia salesman, and janitor. While a student in the US, McNeill began writing seriously. His first major collection of poems, Reel from \"The Life Movie\", appeared in 1972 and immediately established his reputation in Jamaica alongside his contemporaries Dennis Scott and Mervyn Morris. This was followed by Credences at the Altar of Cloud (1979) and Chinese Lanterns from the Blue Child, published posthumously in 1998. Other significant work remains unpublished. McNeill was known for his experimental style, influenced by contemporary jazz as well as American poets like Walt Whitman, Emily Dickinson, and E. E. Cummings. He once said, of his first collection, \"I don't think I could write if my first concern wasn't for the aesthetic.\" He also claimed that his greatest ambition was to be a jazz pianist. He was recognised by his peers as a prodigious talent, but McNeill was plagued by alcoholism and drug abuse. In one of his later poems he wrote, \"I realised very early I had no gift for conducting a life. So I shifted my focus and sang a wreath.\" He died while undergoing surgery at the University Hospital of the West Indies on 2 January 1996. In an obituary essay, poet and literary scholar Mervyn Morris wrote: \"We have lost one of the finest of our West Indian poets, an extreme talent, recklessly experimental, awesome in commitment to his gift.\""

Brinkley was awarded the top position on US Banker magazine's 2005 list of \"Most Powerful Women in Banking,\" and was number 23 on Fortune's \"50 Most Powerful Women in Business\" in 2006 and 2007  and 22nd in 2008, when she was reported to be \"a possible candidate to succeed ... Ken Lewis.\" In all, Brinkley was named to the Fortune list nine consecutive years. In addition, she was cited by The Wall Street Journal and Forbes as one of the leading women in business. As head of the Bank's risk department, Brinkley was tasked with protecting the Bank from all kinds of risk, ranging from human resources-related factors to interest rate fluctuations and credit risk. According to the Times, \"she was at Mr. Lewis’s side as the bank rapidly expanded its credit card and home equity lending, businesses that are causing charge-offs for the bank.\" Her most recent assignment was as \"the point person between the bank and the regulators during the stress tests.\" As to compensation, \"Ms. Brinkley received no bonus last year. But she took home at least $37.2 million during her tenure as Bank of America’s risk chief from 2001 to 2007, according to an analysis by Equilar, a compensation research firm. She is also entitled to pension benefits worth more than $12 million, and potentially millions more in deferred pay and accumulated stock. The figures are based on the 2008 proxy statement, the last time data was publicly available.\" Brinkley joined the Bank of America organization in 1978, as a Commercial Credit Department management trainee for NCNB. From 1993-2001, she served first as the company's Marketing executive and then as president of its Consumer Products division. Brinkley graduated Phi Beta Kappa from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. She serves on the Bank of America Charitable Foundation Board of Directors.

He graduated from Columbia College in 1897 and from Columbia Law School in 1899. He was one of a small group of white Americans who decided in the 1900s to support the radical demands for racial justice being voiced by W. E. B. Du Bois in contrast to the more ameliorative views of Booker T. Washington. He served as head of the legal committee of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) and was one of its vice presidents starting in 1911. He interrupted his legal career to serve for several years as a United States Army captain in the Sanitary Corps during World War I and protested the discriminatory treatment of African Americans in the U.S. military. He was very interested in furthering the cause of Civil Rights and improving the condition of American blacks. He succeeded his brother Joel Elias Spingarn as president of the NAACP in 1940 when the legal arm of the organization was spun off into the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund. He served as the NAACP's president until 1965. Spingarn was an avid collector and amassed a collection of materials –books, newspapers, manuscripts, and realia –related to the African-American experience worldwide, a collection \"unique in its depth, breadth, and quality,\" which he sold to Howard University, where it was incorporated into the renamed Moorland-Spingarn Research Center, the largest and most valuable research library in America for the study of Negro life and history. The rest of his collections were sold at auction in 1966. He died at home in New York City on December 1, 1971. At his memorial service, he was eulogized by Associate Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall and Roy Wilkins, executive director of the NAACP. Buell C. Gallagher, retired president of the City College of New York, called him \"the rallying center of the aggressive forward movement\" of the NAACP."

  "text" : "Alfred Kordelin (6 November 1868, Rauma – 7 November 1917, Mommila, Hausjärvi) was a Finnish industrialist, businessman, entrepreneur, and a major philanthropist. Kordelin was one of the richest Finnish entrepreneurs of his time. Kordelin had little formal education. He was the son of a poor seaman from Rauma. Kordelin invested wisely in the fields of weaving, shipbuilding and metalworking, becoming one of Finland's richest men. Risto Ryti, who later became President of Finland, was Alfred Kordelin's legal advisor and close friend. Kordelin owned the Mommila and Jokioinen manor houses and a steammill in Reposaari. He invested a large amount of money in different companies. He built a summerhouse in Naantali, called Kultaranta. Kultaranta is currently owned by the Government of Finland, and used as the President's summer residence. Kordelin himself spent only one summer at Kultaranta. On 7 November 1917, Kordelin was kidnapped by a group of Red Guards and was murdered by a Russian sailor in the so-called Mommila skirmish that followed. Kordelin was not married and was childless. Upon his death he bequeathed all his property to a Finnish cultural foundation in his will. With this money the Alfred Kordelin Foundation was later founded. The foundation gives out several million euros annually in grants and awards to promote literature, science, art, and public education in Finland. He was buried in Rauma on a chapel which was drawn by Finnish architect Lars Sonck."

He was one of the strongest junior chess players in the Soviet Union in the late 60s, qualified for the World Juniors in 1967 ahead of Karpov, Balashov and other very strong players, and was subsequently denied his shot at the title by the fact that the event was held in Israel, which at the time was a no-fly zone for Soviet sportsmen. Since then his career failed to live up to the earlier promise, but he still became an International Master and won five Leningrad (Saint Petersburg) championships, which at the time were equal in strength to a national championship of an average European country, with many titled players taking part. He combined his chess playing with a nine to five job as an engineer. Andrei went into coaching in the late 1980s and since then helped many young chess players in Saint Petersburg, leading Konstantin Sakaev to a World Junior title. In 1993 he started to work with Peter Svidler, who credits him as the biggest influence in his career."

  "text" : "Alan Berliner (born 1956) is an American independent filmmaker. The New York Times has described Berliner's work as \"powerful, compelling and bittersweet... full of juicy conflict and contradiction, innovative in their cinematic technique, unpredictable in their structures... Alan Berliner illustrates the power of fine art to transform life. \"Berliner's experimental documentary films, FIRST COUSIN ONCE REMOVED (2013), WIDE AWAKE, The Sweetest Sound (2001), Nobody’s Business (1996), Intimate Stranger (1991), and The Family Album (1986), have been broadcast all over the world, and received awards, prizes, and retrospectives at many major international film festivals. The San Francisco International Film Festival called Berliner, “America’s foremost cinematic essayist.” The Florida Film Festival called him “the modern master of personal documentary filmmaking.” Over the years, Berliner’s films have become part of the core curriculum for documentary filmmaking and film history classes at universities worldwide, and are in the permanent collections of many film societies, festivals, libraries, colleges and museums. All of his films are in the permanent collection of the Museum of Modern Art. In July 2013, Berliner was awarded the Freedom of Expression Award by the San Francisco Jewish Film Festival. In 2006, the International Documentary Association honored him with an International Trailblazer Award “for creativity, innovation, originality, and breakthrough in the field of documentary cinema.” Berliner had also been a recipient of a Distinguished Achievement Award from the IDA in 1993. In 2002, the National Foundation for Jewish Culture presented him with a Cultural Achievement Award in the Arts, and he was the recipient of the Storyteller Award from the Taos Talking Picture Film Festival in 2001. Berliner’s films have won awards at many major international film festivals, and he has received retrospectives at the Museum of Modern Art (NYC), and many other museums and film festivals all over the world. Berliner is a recipient of Rockefeller, Guggenheim and Jerome Foundation Fellowships, and has received multiple grants from the National Endowment for the Arts, the New York State Council on the Arts, and the New York Foundation for the Arts. He’s won three Emmy Awards and received six Emmy nominations from the National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences. Berliner has also served on several non-profit foundation funding panels and various international film festival juries, including the 2007 Sundance Film Festival Documentary Jury.

  "text" : "Antonio Bertali (probably March 1605 – 17 April 1669) was an Italian composer and violinist of the Baroque era. He was born in Verona and received early music education there from Stefano Bernardi. Probably from 1624, he was employed as court musician in Vienna by Emperor Ferdinand II. In 1649, Bertali succeeded Giovanni Valentini as court Kapellmeister. He died in Vienna in 1669 and was succeeded in his post by Giovanni Felice Sances. Bertali's compositions are in the manner of other northern Italian composers of the time and include operas, oratorios, a large number of liturgical works, and chamber music. Particularly his operas are notable for establishing the tradition of Italian opera seria in Vienna. Approximately half of his output is now lost; copies survive made by Bertali's contemporary, Pavel Josef Vejvanovský, some of the pieces are currently in possession of Vienna's Hofbibliothek, the library of the Kremsmünster Abbey and the Kroměříž archive. The most important source for Bertali's work is, however, the Viennese Distinta Specificatione catalogue, which lists several composers of the Habsburg court and provides titles and scoring for more than 2000 compositions. The \"Chaconne\" or Ciaccona is perhaps his best-known work."

Veracini was born in Florence, Italy, the eldest son of Francesco di Niccolò Veracini, a noted violinist who ran a music school, and from whom Antonio first learned to play the violin. When his father's health began to fail around 1708, Antonio took over the running of the school, where he taught the violin to (amongst others) his nephew Francesco Maria Veracini (1690–1768), later a celebrated violinist and composer in his own right. Unlike his nephew, who travelled widely, Antonio rarely left Florence. He did visit Rome on two occasions, where he is believed to have met Arcangelo Corelli, and in 1720 he briefly visited Vienna (). Antonio Veracini died aged 75, which for the time period was a ripe age, but not particularly old."

He later taught at the Juilliard School in New York, where he died in 1983 at age 84. In 1941, Wallenstein was given a personal Peabody Award for Outstanding Entertainment in Music. As solo cellist he recorded Strauss's Don Quixote under Beecham in 1932. For Audio Fidelity in September and October 1958, he conducted the specially-formed Virtuoso Symphony of London orchestra in Walthamstow Town Hall. The LPs included Brahms's 4th Symphony, Tchaikovsky's Pathetique, Berlioz's Symphonie Fantastique, Pictures at an Exhibition, Boléro, Romeo and Juliet, the Nutcracker Suite and a suite from Carmen. He was a descendant of Albrecht von Wallenstein."

  "text" : "Sir Augustus Moore Daniel (1866 – 1950) was the Director of the National Gallery in London, England, for five years from January 1929 to December 1933. As a young man, Daniel travelled abroad studying the attribution of paintings with Roger Fry. He was appointed as a Trustee of the National Gallery in 1925, apparently due to his being a personal friend and golfing partner of the prime minister, Stanley Baldwin. His installation as Director in January 1929 is seen as a strike against \"experts\" and the increasing professionalisation of art history, on the part of the Trustees. In 1929, the Gallery bought the Wilton Diptych and Titian's group portrait of The Vendramin Family; these are considered the two major purchases of Daniel's directorship. Also that year the highly controversial dealer Joseph Duveen became a Trustee. Jonathan Conlin's history of the National Gallery describes Daniel as a \"self-effacing nonentity\" but Fry, for one, admired his \"terrific energy and intellectual beefiness\". Like many directors of the National Gallery, he was a trustee of the Iveagh Bequest."

  "text" : "Arechis II (also Aretchis, Arichis, Arechi or Aregis) (died 26 August 787) was Duke (and later Prince) of Benevento, in southern Italy, from 758 until his death. While he sought to expand Benevento's influence into areas of Italy still controlled by the Byzantine Empire, he also had to resist attacks by Charlemagne, who was building a Frankish empire and had conquered northern Italy. Arechis descended from the Lombards who had invaded the Italian peninsula in the late sixth century and established a Lombard kingdom in northern Italy with its capital at Pavia, and two independent duchies in southern Italy, at Spoleto and Benevento. Arechis was the son of Duke Liutprand, whom he succeeded in 756. Initially Arechis continued to use the title duke of Benevento. After the Lombard kingdom fell to Charlemagne in 774, however, probably as a gesture of independence, Arechis adopted the title prince of Benevento until his death in 787. Around 757 Arechis married Adelperga, a daughter of the north Italian Lombard king, Desiderius. Arichis thus established friendly (but largely independent) relations with Desiderius, which lasted until the Lombard kingdom fell to the Franks in 774 and Desiderius was deposed. The Beneventan couple produced five children, three boys and two girls. By eighth century standards, Adelperga and Arichis were notable patrons of culture. Adelperga commissioned the major Lombard writer Paul the Deacon to produce his Historia Romana, a textbook of Roman history which was widely used during the rest of the Middle Ages. (Some historians also argue that they commissioned Paul's more famous Historia gentis Langobardorum although this is uncertain.) Arichis arranged for the transfer of saints' relics to the newly commissioned church of Santa Sofia in Benevento. This still survives, albeit heavily restored. It is decorated with rare eighth-century frescoes. He also put resources into building works at Salerno, including a new palace and castle. Salerno became an increasingly important port and city from Arechis's reign onwards. Major south Italian monasteries, such as Montecassino and San Vincenzo al Volturno, also received substantial donations from him. Arechis was the duke when Charlemagne conquered the north Italian Lombard kingdom in 774 and made himself king of the Lombards. Although Arechis refused to submit to Charlemagne, Benevento was left largely unmolested, probably because it was simply too far away to be reached easily and Charlemagne had many other calls on his time. In the same year Arechis adopted the title of \"prince of Benevento\". He also issued a handful of laws. Both these acts were probably intended as a gesture of defiance against Charlemagne, since hitherto no duke of Benevento had ever legislated - only the Lombard kings. Since Charlemagne now styled himself king of the Lombards, Arechis was effectively rejecting Charlemagne's right to this title. In 776, Arechis was probably involved in a Lombard conspiracy to throw off Frankish domination. Charlemagne successfully crushed this revolt, which was mostly focused in Friuli, in north-east Italy. Arechis does not seem to have provided much practical support for the rebellion and Charlemagne was forced to hurry back north of the Alps, rather than dealing with Arechis. Once again, geographical distance had protected Arechis from the Franks. Arechis's Beneventan state continued to skirmish with and try to seize territory from the neighbouring Byzantine duchy of Naples. At some point, however, perhaps in the mid-780s, Arechis reached an agreement with the duke of Naples set out in a document called a 'pactum'. This sets out detailed provisions dealing with landholding and dispute settlement. It was perhaps intended to free Benevento to deal with the looming Frankish threat. This crystallised in 787, when Charlemagne advanced into south Italy and besieged Capua, another important town in the principality of Benevento. Arechis left Benevento itself and retreated to his new centre, the port of Salerno. Under pressure, Arechis apparently submitted to Frankish suzerainty. As Einhard, Charlemagne's biographer, describes it in his Vita Caroli Magni: He [Charlemagne] afterwards entered Italy in person with his army [787], and passed through Rome to Capua, a city in Campania, where he pitched his camp and threatened the Beneventans with hostilities unless they should submit themselves to him. Their duke, Aragis, escaped the danger by sending his two sons, Rumold and Grimold, with a great sum of money to meet the King, begging him to accept them as hostages, and promising for himself and his people compliance with all the King's commands, on the single condition that his personal attendance should not be required. The King took the welfare of the people into account rather than the stubborn disposition of the Duke, accepted the proffered hostages, and released him from the obligation to appear before him in consideration of his handsome gift. He retained the younger son only as hostage, and sent the elder back to his father, and returned to Rome, leaving commissioners with Aragis to exact the oath of allegiance, and administer it to the Beneventans. He stayed in Rome several days in order to pay his devotions at the holy places, and then came back to Gaul [787]. Superficially, Charlemagne seemed to have imposed himself on Benevento. Arechis had paid tribute and one of his sons was being held hostage as a guarantee of Benevento's loyalty. Frankish influence was also given formal expression. Traditionally Benevento had produced and used gold coinage but from 787 the Beneventan mint began to strike silver coins too, similar to those issued by Charlemagne's Frankish kingdom. Both the new silver and the traditional gold coins, as well as Beneventan legal documents, all started to include Charlemagne's name and title alongside those of Arechis. The inclusion of titles on coins and in charters was considered an important marker of political authority. However, Einhard overstates Charlemagne's success. Frankish influence in Benevento proved to be very short-lived. When in 788, both Grimoald's elder brother, Romuald, and Arechis himself died, Grimoald, who was being held hostage by Charlemagne, succeeded as prince of Benevento. Unwisely Charlemagne released Grimoald in return for an oath of loyalty. Grimoald did not keep this promise and, by c. 791, in effect proclaimed himself independent and successfully resisted the Franks. Later, Grimoald tried to throw off Frankish suzerainty, but Charlemagne's sons, Pepin of Italy and Charles the Younger, forced him to submit in 792."

  "text" : "The Reverend Anthony Maraschi, S.J. (1820 - 1897) was an Italian-born priest of the Society of Jesus. He was a founder of the University of San Francisco and Saint Ignatius College Preparatory as well as the first pastor of Saint Ignatius Church in San Francisco, California. Born in Piedmont, Italy, in 1820, Maraschi entered the Society of Jesus in Chieti. He began his scholastic career in Nice and was ordained a priest there in 1849. Maraschi left for the United States soon thereafter, and he completed a theology degree at Georgetown University before becoming a member of its faculty. Maraschi was also assigned to teach at the College of the Holy Cross in Worcester, Massachusetts, and Loyola College in Baltimore, Maryland. In 1854, Maraschi left for San Francisco. Upon arrival, he served as an assistant pastor for both St. Francis of Assisi and St. Patrick's churches while planning the establishment of a Jesuit church and school in the City. With the approval of Archbishop Joseph Alemany and the assistance of fellow Jesuits Michael Accolti, S.J. and Joseph Bixio, S.J., Saint Ignatius Church and College were established in 1855. Saint Ignatius College was recognized by the Society of Jesus in 1859 and chartered by the State of California that same year. During the early years, Father Maraschi served as not only the church's pastor but also the college's president and treasurer, as well as an instructor in Latin, Greek, and Spanish. While he turned over the college's presidency to Nicholas Congiato, S.J. in 1862, Father Maraschi continued to supervise its financial affairs. He also continued to serve as Saint Ignatius Church's parish priest until a dispute with Archbishop Alemany in 1863 resulted in the church's parish status being rescinded. Much later on, Saint Ignatius College would split into Saint Ignatius College and Saint Ignatius High School, with the former becoming the University of San Francisco and the latter becoming Saint Ignatius College Preparatory. Anthony Maraschi died in San Francisco in 1897 and was buried in Mission Santa Clara's cemetery."

  "text" : "Alan Birkinshaw, FRGS (born 15 June 1944, in Auckland, New Zealand) is a British film director, writer, and television and film producer. The son of two physicians, his first job was as a jackaroo in the Australian outback, before becoming a horse breaker and rodeo rider. Travelling to England, he joined the camera department of Lew Grade's Associated TeleVision on his 20th birthday. He worked his way up to directing, firstly in television and then via the world of commercials, into television movies and feature films. He directed several episodes of Space Precinct, at the time the most expensive TV series ever made. One of his early was Killer's Moon. Killer's Moon was described in the acclaimed Shepperton Babylon as the most tasteless movie in the history of the British Cinema. In spite of comments like this, Killer's Moon won a prize for best Screenplay at the Sitges Horror Film Festival, and has since become a cult film. In the mid 1970s, Birkinshaw’s production of Alice in Wonderland ran into difficulties when the RSPCA banned him from using live flamingos in the croquet scene. In an interview with ITN, the director of the London Zoo described Birkinshaw as ‘barmy’. In 1986, Birkinshaw went to India where he directed an award winning film on the life of Jawaharlal Nehru, entitled But I Have Promises To Keep, which had been commissioned by Rajiv Gandhi and was made for the Government of India via Doordarshan, the national television network of India. Birkinshaw is renowned for being able to turn low budget action films into reasonably successful mainstream pieces, such as the boxing movie Punch. In the last few years, Birkinshaw's passion for telling stories has taken him to the world of sculpture, recreating some of the greatest works by the world's classical sculptors. The Creation of Adam, based on Michelangelo's work in the Sistine Chapel is one, and the story of Alexander the Great’s triumphant march into Babylon, original by the famed neo-classical sculptor, Bertel Thorvaldsen, is another. Currently, Birkinshaw is writing an action adventure novel due to be published in 2014."

He was nevertheless captured. Al-Boushi was tried before a Field Military Court, \"whose procedures fall far short of international standards for fair trials.\" Canadian authorities ostensibly conducted a long diplomatic campaign to pressure the Syrian authorities for his release. However it is also known that Canadian authorities deliberately leaked al-Boushi's name as a terrorist to CTV News, falsely suggesting he had been flagged after Maher Arar \"provided information\" to his Syrian interrogators. As part of a general Amnesty al-Boushi was freed from Syrian custody on According to Dan McTeague, the parliamentary secretary for the Canadian Foreign Affairs, who played a role in the Canadian government efforts to secure his release: \"He's in very good spirits, clearly delighted with the fact that he has been released,\" Al-Boushi returned to Canada on December 23, 2005. He says he does not know Maher Arar, Abdullah Amalki, Ahmad El Maati or Muayyed Nureddin, four other foreign-born Canadian Muslims the Syrians had imprisoned."

  "text" : "Andrew Jackson Foster (1925–1987) was a missionary to the deaf in Ghana, Rwanda and other countries in Africa from 1956 until his death in 1987. In 1954, he became the first Deaf African American to earn a bachelor's degree from Gallaudet College and the first to earn a master's degree from Eastern Michigan University. He soon earned a second master's degree from Seattle Pacific Christian College (now called Seattle Pacific University). He founded Christian Mission for the Deaf African in 1956 and eventually set out for Accra, Ghana, where he established the first school for the deaf on the entire continent of Africa. Andrew Foster was born in Ensley, Alabama, the son of a coal miner. His parents were Wiley and Veline. He and his younger brother Edward became deaf through spinal meningitis in 1936. Educational opportunities for African Americans in that era prevented him from achieving more than a sixth-grade education. At the age of sixteen, he moved to Detroit, Michigan to live with his aunt and attended Bethany Pembroke church where he later committed his life to the call of Christ. He completed high school through a correspondence course with an American School in Chicago, Ill in 1951. In 1961 Andrew was married to Berta, a deaf German, and together they had 5 children (4 boys and 1 girl). Gallaudet College awarded him an honorary doctorate in Humane Letters in 1970 for his accomplishment."

  "text" : "Alan H. Goldstein is a research scientist and futurist. He began his career in the 1970s as a molecular biologist before becoming a theoretician in the field of nanobiotechnology. He has codified the central concepts of this nascent area of knowledge into a set of operational rules termed the 'Laws of Biomimetics'. As part of this work, Goldstein has published a set of guidelines specifically designed to identify the artificial life forms likely to emerge from research at the intersection of nanotechnology and biotechnology. He has also created the 'Animat Test' as a practical bioengineering tool for monitoring the coming transformation from natural to artificial biology: Let us define a life form as an entity that reduces entropy by self-executing the minimum set of physical and chemical operations necessary to sustain the ability to execute functionally equivalent negentropic operations indefinitely across time. Given that, a life form will be considered an animat (living material) if all the information necessary to execute that minimum set of physical and chemical operations cannot be stored in DNA or RNA. The corollary: If all the information necessary to execute that minimum set of physical and chemical operations can be stored in DNA or RNA, the life form is biological. His essay \"Nature vs. Nanoengineering: Rebuilding our world one atom at a time.\" won a 2003 Shell-Economist Prize  and remains the primary reference in the nascent field of nanobioethics. He was probably the first person to use the term \"Breaking The Carbon Barrier\" to identify the future moment when humanity successfully engineers the first nonbiological life form. This concept was formally introduced and defined during a debate with Ron Bailey at the Foresight 'Vision Weekend' component of the 13th Foresight Conference on Advanced Nanotechnology."

  "text" : "Alexander McNutt (1725, near Derry, Ireland – 1811, Lexington, Virginia) was a British army officer, colonist and land agent, responsible for seeing an approximate 500 Ulster Scottish emigrants arrive in Nova Scotia during the early 1760s. McNutt emigrated to America some time before 1753 by which time he had settled in Staunton, Virginia. In 1756 he was an officer in the Virginia militia on Major Andrew Lewis's expedition against the Shawnees on the Ohio River. By September 1758 McNutt had relocated to Londonderry, New Hampshire, a town settled by Ulster Scots. Between April and November 1760, McNutt served as a Massachusetts captain at Fort Cumberland near the present-day border between Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, five years after the Expulsion of the Acadians. It was during this time that he became involved in the colonization of Nova Scotia. He concerned himself with the Cobequid Townships of Truro and Londonderry. Through McNutt's efforts, a group of fifty families from New Hampshire arrived in the spring of 1761 in the Cobequid (Truro) area of Nova Scotia. He had several proposals for settlement of some 7,000 to 8,000 Protestant Irish in Nova Scotia accepted by the Board of Trade in London, but he was not successful in getting the support of the Privy Council who feared such an out-migration would harm British interests in Ireland. He nevertheless went to the Ulster with just the Board of Trade's approval to seek out emigrants. In the spring of 1761 he advertised throughout Ulster with an offer to \"industrious farmers and useful mechanics\" of 200 acres (0.81 km2) of land to the head of a family and 50 to each member. His effort resulted in 300 colonists arriving in Halifax in October on the ships Hopewell and Nancy. The next autumn, 170 more settlers arrived out of Londonderry on the same two ships and settled the New Dublin area in present-day Lunenburg County and elsewhere in the province. McNutt also worked to settle a group of disbanded New England soldiers, which included Israel Perley, along the Saint John River. In 1764 he began negotiations with John Hughes of Philadelphia, an undertaking that culminated two years later with 60 Pennsylvania-German settlers establishing The Township of Monckton on the Petitcodiac River. Plans for huge settlements on some 2,300,000 acres (9,300 km2) of land fell through as the land boom in Nova Scotia petered out by the mid-1760s. McNutt spent time in the later part of the decade living with his brother on McNutt Island in Rosebay Harbour (near present-day Shelburne) as well as in the Cobequid region where he appeared in the 1771 census. He seems to have supported himself at this time cutting timber. He was ordered to pay several debts and forced to sell his land at Port Roseway. Other land he held in Pictou, the Minas Basin, and Beaver Harbour were escheated. He left the colony around 1780, returned around 1786, and left for good in 1794 and finally settled in Rockbridge County, Virginia in 1796. McNutt rose to the army rank of colonel."

  "text" : "Alon Ḥilu (Hebrew אלון חילו) (born Jaffa, Israel, June 21, 1972), is an Israeli novelist. His first novel, Death of a Monk (Xargol, 2004), is based on a historical blood libel against the Jews in Damascus, Syria, and offers an original homosexual interpretation for the historical events. The novel was shortlisted for the prestigious Sapir Prize in Israel (2005), was awarded the Presidential Prize for literature (Israel, 2006) and has been translated into English (Harvill Secker, London), French (Edition Du Seuil, Paris), Greek (Metaichmio, Athens) and Dutch (Ambo Anthos, Amsterdam). Hilu's second novel, The House of Rajani (Harvill Secker, Random House UK), a fictional retelling of the history of early Zionism, was published in Hebrew in February 2008 by Yedioth Sfarim. The novel initially received the 2009 Sapir Prize, but after claims were made regarding a conflict of interests among the judges (Yossi Sarid, the head judge of the committee, was related to the novel's editor) the prize was withdrawn and the award cancelled. Israel's president Shimon Peres called it \"an extraordinary book\". Hilu earned a degree in dramatic writing at Tel Aviv University, studying under Israel’s leading playwrights, such as Yehoshua Sobol and Shmuel Hasfari. His plays, \"The Wedding\" and \"The Day of the Dogs\" were produced in theatre festivals in Israel, and were both translated into English for the Harvard Radcliffe Dramatic Club. From 1987 to 1988, Hilu wrote radio plays for Israeli Radio. During the 90s, two of his short stories were published in Israeli literary magazines: \"The Biblical Zoo in Jerusalem\" (\"Iton 77\", 1992) and \"Last Seen\" (\"Moznaim\", 1993). In Addition to his writing career, Hilu also holds a law degree and practices Intellectual Property law as a legal counsel at an Israeli hi-tech company."

  "text" : "Asa Smith Bushnell III (February 2, 1900 – March 22, 1975) was the first commissioner (initially titled executive director) of the Eastern College Athletic Conference, serving from 1938 to 1970, and was board member (1945 to 1970) and secretary of the United States Olympic Committee, editing, co-editing and/or writing \"Olympic Books\" at least from 1948 to 65. He graduated from Princeton University in 1921, and a prize in his name is awarded to the Ivy League football player of the year. Bushnell was not an athlete himself, and in college another of his interests was expressed in his editorship of the college humor magazine, The Tiger. In this role, he chose to reject submissions from recent alumnus F. Scott Fitzgerald 1917, \"one of his few missteps\" according to a later alumni magazine profile, which also said he nonetheless became a friend of Fitzgerald's. Bushnell also edited the alumni magazine for five years (1925–1930) before moving full-time to athletic administration."

  "text" : "Alexandre Bisson (9 April 1848 – 27 January 1912) was a French playwright, vaudeville creator, and novelist. Born in Briouze, Orne in Lower Normandy, he was successful in his native France as well as in the United States. Remembered as a significant creator of Parisian vaudeville, in collaboration with Edmond Gondinet, Bisson's 1881 three-act comedy \"Un Voyage d'agrément\" was performed at the Théâtre du Vaudeville in Paris. In 1892, the first of a Bisson's dozen plays came to New York City's Broadway stage. Of his works, Bisson is best remembered for his play \"Madame X\" that was performed in 1910 both in Paris and on Broadway with Sarah Bernhardt in the leading role. Over the years, the play would be revived for Broadway three times and nine Madame X motion pictures in several languages have been filmed. The first silent screen adaptation was in 1916 and the latest in 2000. Better-known versions include a 1929 \"talkie\" production starring Ruth Chatterton and directed by Lionel Barrymore plus the 1966 production starring Lana Turner. In 2006 a musical has been produced in Chicago, IL based on the original play \"Madame X\". Bisson also adapted the 1910 bestselling Florence Barclay novel, The Rosary as a three-act play for the Paris stage. Widely acclaimed in the United States, Alexandre Bisson was invited to write about the theatre by The Saturday Evening Post and his articles The Dilemmas of the Theater and How the World Contributes to the American Stage were published in 1912. Alexandre Bisson died in Paris in 1912 at the age of sixty-three."

  "text" : "Asa Phillip (Ace) Borger (April 12, 1888 – August 31, 1934), the founder of Borger, Texas, was born to Phillip Borger and the former Minnie Ann West on a family farm near Carthage, Missouri. His father, a veterinarian, died when Borger was just six years old. He and his siblings were reared by their mother and grandmothers. Borger attended school in Carthage and graduated from business college. Sometime around 1907 he married classmate Elizabeth Willoughby. They spent their first years in a rented farmhouse near Carthage where Borger opened a lumber yard. The couple had three children. Borger began his career as a town promoter at the time of World War I. In 1915 Borger and his younger brother Lester Andrew, known as Pete Borger, sold land in Picher, Oklahoma, which was in the center of valuable lead and zinc deposits. In 1917 the Borgers, partnered with noted oilman Tom Slick, set up the oil town of Slick near Bristow, Oklahoma. At each town the Borgers and their associates opened hotels, gasoline stations, lumberyards, sold land, and pushed for the building of railroad lines to their towns. In 1922 they successfully started Cromwell, Oklahoma, as a boomtown. Though Borger and his family maintained a home for a short time in each of his new towns, he continued to use Carthage as his main base of operations. Borger soon became interested in the discovery of oil in the Texas Panhandle. Early in 1926 he purchased 240 acres (0.97 km2) in southern Hutchinson County from rancher John Frank Weatherly at a price of fifty dollars an acre. He then obtained a grant from Secretary of State of Texas Emma Grigsby Meharg to organize the Borger Townsite Company, with capital of $10,000 divided into 100 shares of $100. In addition to Mr. Borger the company's stockholders included C. C. Horton of the Gulf Oil Company and John R. Miller, an old friend of Borger's from the Oklahoma boom days, who became the new town's first mayor. The Borger Townsite Company laid out the town and opened the sale of lots on March 8, 1926. By the end of the day, the company had grossed between $60,000 and $100,000. Six months later Borger had sold out completely, for the price of more than a million dollars. Borger established a lumberyard in his namesake town, and opened its first bank as well. Often he took out full-page advertisements in area newspapers that promoted settlement in Borger and other oil-rich communities throughout West Texas and eastern New Mexico in which he had bought an interest. Mr. Borger also owned several wheat elevators in the area and also 19,000 acres (77 km²) of farmland in Hansford County. In 1927 Ace and Pete Borger, with Albert S. Stinnett, established the towns of Stinnett, Texas, and Gruver, Texas, and the group was influential in making the town of Stinnett the Hutchinson county seat. In 1929 Borger built a spacious two-story brick residence, the first such house in town. From the start he had set aside sites for building churches and schools. Visiting dignitaries were lavishly entertained in the Borger home, which Mrs. Borger decorated with fine antiques. Borger's overt generosity with friends and acquaintances caused hard feelings among certain folks, particularly county treasurer Arthur Huey. Huey's dislike for Borger intensified after the Borger State Bank (which Borger had established in June 1930 as president and his son Phillip as vice president) failed, causing a minor panic. The elder Borger was later convicted of taking deposits while the bank was insolvent and received a two-year prison term, which he appealed. Meanwhile, Arthur Huey was jailed for embezzlement and reportedly asked Borger to help bail him out. When Borger declined, Huey threatened his life. On August 31, 1934, Borger was getting his mail at the post office when Huey walked in with a Colt .45, cursed and shot him five times. Huey then took Borger's own .44 pistol and fired four more times. Bystander Lloyd Duncan, farm boss for the Magnolia Petroleum Company, was severely wounded in the attack and died five days later. At Huey's trial, which was held in Canadian, Texas, Huey claimed that he acted in self-defense, arguing that Borger was instead out to kill him. The jury acquitted him. Three years later, however, Huey was sentenced to the state penitentiary for theft of county funds. The funeral for Ace Borger was held in Borger, and then his body was shipped back to Missouri for burial in the family plot in Carthage."

  "text" : "Alfred Philippson (1 January 1864 – 30 January 1953) was a German geologist and geographer.He was born at Bonn, son of Ludwig Philippson. He received his education at the gymnasium and university of his native town and at the University of Leipzig (Ph.D. 1886). In 1892 he became Privatdozent at Bonn, was appointed assistant professor seven years later, and in 1904 he was called to Bern as professor of geography. Having made voyages through Italy (Apulia region), Greece, Turkey, and Asia Minor, he published: Studien über Wasserscheiden, Berlin, 1886; Der Peloponnes, ib. 1892; Europa (with Neumann), Leipzig, 1894; Thessalien und Epirus, Berlin, 1897; Beiträge zur Kenntnis der Griechischen Inselwelt, Gotha, 1901; Das Mittelmeergebiet, Leipzig, 1904. He also published essays in the technical journals, such as Das fernste Italien. Geographische Reiseskizzen und Studien, Leipzig, 1925, and Apulien, Netherlands, 1937. Since 1887 Philippson undertook, on a commission from the Berlin Akademie der Wissenschaften, an annual journey to Asia Minor for the purpose of geological investigation. His chief object in these excursions was to study, on a geological basis, the phenomena of the earth's surface both in their interrelationship and in their influence on the human race. As a Jew, he lost his position under the Nazis. During the war, he was sent to the Theresienstadt concentration camp (1942–45), where he wrote a memoir on his scholarly activity (Wie ich zum Geographen wurde, partly published in 1996). He survived the war in part thanks to the support of his friend, Sven Hedin, resuming work on his multi-volume essay on the Greek landscapes (with E. Kirsten; posthumously published and continued by Kirsten)."

While the precise circumstances remained unclear, Tafazzoli's death created a climate of fear at the university and discouraged criticism of the government."

Adelmann seems to have become bishop there in 1050, and to have taken an active share in the church-reform movement of the period, especially against the clerical abuses of simony and concubinage. Of unknown parentage and nationality, he was educated at the famous School of Chartres, in France, founded by Fulbert, and was considered one of his favourite scholars. Among his fellow students was Berengarius, to whom, at a later period, he addressed two letters. The second (incomplete) letter  is a valuable dogmatic exposition of the teaching of the Church on the Eucharist; the Benedictine editors of the Histoire littéraire de la France call it \"one of the finest literary documents of the period.\" It breathes a tender affection for Berengarius, the friend of the writer's youth. Calvin called him \"barbarus, imperitus, et sophista.\""

  "text" : "Anita Skorgan (born 13 November 1958) is a Norwegian singer-songwriter. She was once married to Jahn Teigen, another successful Norwegian singer-songwriter; constantly in the tabloids the two were considered the first superstar celebrity couple in Norway. Together they have a daughter. She represented Norway in the Eurovision Song Contest a total of five times: twice as a solo artist, once with Jahn Teigen, once as his backing singer in 1983, and also as Finn Kalvik's backing singer in his 1981 performance. In 1977 in London she sang \"Casanova\", finishing 14th. She had a bit more Eurovision success in Jerusalem two years later, lifting her song \"Oliver\" to 11th place. Back in England, she returned to the Eurovision stage with her then-husband Jahn Teigen to perform \"Adieu\", which was voted to a 12th position in Harrogate. She and Jahn between them appeared at every single Eurovision Song Contest final from 1977 until 1983 except 1980, namely 6 times in 7 years. As her music career expanded, the demand for Anita Skorgan grew also. Before she knew it, she landed multiple appearances on the hit television show \"Melodi Grand Prix\" seven times between 1976 and 1985. On 17 November 2001 she appeared with her old classmates on the popular Norwegian TV show \"Den store klassefesten\" (The Big Class Reunion). Anita again represented Norway at the Eurovision Song Contest as a co-writer and backing singer in 1988, where the song \"For vår jord\" (For our earth) was placed fifth, sung by Karoline Krueger. She was also one of the writers of \"You Used To Be Mine\", which came fifth in Norway's Melodi Grand Prix 1999, the show which selected the country's entry to the 1999 Eurovision Song Contest in Jerusalem, Israel. Additional instances of her filmographic life include appearances on Prima Veras saga om Olav den hellige in 1983 and Stjerner i sikte in 1997. In 1995 she gave her voice for the singing parts of the Disney movie Pocahontas and its sequel; in 1997 she sang as Anastasia in Anastasia, and in 1998 she sang as Kayley in the movie Quest for Camelot. In 2004 she founded the band Queen Bees. In November 2010 she was interviewed and sang live on the Jeremy Vine Show on BBC Radio 2. In July 2011 she was again interviewed, twice, on the Jeremy Vine Show following the 2011 Norway attacks."

  "text" : "Adelaide Lisetta Fries (12 November 1871–29 November 1949) was the foremost scholar of the history and genealogy of the Moravians in the southern United States. She made important contributions to the field as archivist, translator, author and editor. Fries was born in Salem (now Winston-Salem), North Carolina, the elder of two daughters (Mary Elenor Fries Blair(1873-1966)) of John William Fries (1846–1927) and Agnes Sophia (de Schweinitz) Fries (1849–1915). She never married, and lived with her parents in Winston-Salem until their deaths. In 1911, the Provincial Elders' Conference of the Moravian Church in America, Southern Province, appointed Fries as archivist of the Southern Province, and granted her the use of a warehouse in Salem as repository and offices. She immediately began collecting, organizing, translating and publishing records, a work that continued until her death. Fries was never satisfied that the warehouse was a safe repository, and over the years her friends and supporters raised enough money to convert the former office of the Vorsteher (business manager) of the Salem community into a fireproof repository. The archives moved into the new building in 1942. One of Fries' best-known books is The Road To Salem (1944), an account of the life of Anna Catharina (Antes) Ernst (1726-1816). Written in the first person, the book is based on Ernst's autobiography and on the diaries and records kept by leaders of the Moravian Church in Georgia, Pennsylvania, and North Carolina. Another well-known book, The Moravians in Georgia, has entered the public domain and is available online. Forsyth County was revised and updated in 1949, and a further revision and update was issued in 1976 under the oversight of J. Edwin Hendricks of Wake Forest University."

Open to Enlightenment ideas, and noted for his interest in hydrological engineering, Mourousis was forced to deal with the intrusions of Osman Pazvantoğlu's rebellious troops. In a rare gesture for his period, he renounced the throne in Wallachia, and his second rule in Moldavia was cut short by the intrigues of French diplomat Horace Sébastiani."

One of the first men to plant vineyards in Wisconsin, he was the founder of the Buena Vista Winery in Sonoma, California, and an early writer on California wine and viticulture. He was the first Hungarian to settle permanently in the United States and only the second to write a book about the country in his native language. He is remembered in Wisconsin as the founder of the oldest incorporated village in the state. He also operated the first commercial steamboat on the upper Mississippi River. In San Diego he is remembered as the first town marshal and the first county sheriff. In California he introduced more than three hundred varieties of European grapes."

He first began his career in 1959, when he was appointed as a legal apprentice. In 1961 he was appointed as an assistant judge to the Tokyo District and its Family Court, the judge of the Muroran branch of the Sapporo District and its Family Court, and the judge of the Civil Affairs Bureau of the General Secretariat of the Supreme Court. In 1971 he was promoted to judge of the Sapporo District and its Family Court. In 1973 he became Chief of the Budget Division, Financial Affairs Bureau, and General Secretariat of the Supreme Court. He began serving as the Chief of the General Affairs Division in 1975, and although he quit being Chief of the Budget Division, he continued to perform in his other two positions until 1977, when he became Counseller of the Cabinet Legislative Bureau. In 1983 he was appointed as a judge of the Tokyo District, and a presiding judge of the Division. From 1984 until 1991 he regained his position as General Secretariat of the Supreme Court; however, he also attained the status of Director of the Secretary and Public Information Division in 1984, which he kept until 1986 when he became Director of the Financial Affairs Bureau. In 1991 he became Chief Judge of the Kofu District Court and its Family Court. In 1993 he became Chief Judge of the Chiba District Court. In 1994 he was appointed judge of the Tokyo High Court, and a presiding judge of the Division. In 1998 he began serving as president of the Fukuoka High Court. In 1999 he became president of the Tokyo High Court. In 2000 he was appointed as a justice of the Supreme Court of Japan. He was appointed Chief Justice on November 6, 2002. One notable case his court has presided over, but he himself did not participate in, was over whether Japanese nationals living in foreign countries had the constitutional right to vote for a specific candidate in parliamentary elections. In addition, Chief Justice Machida voted with the majority to overturn a ruling from the Tokyo High Court that said the Tokyo Metropolitan Government could not bar a civil servant from her managerial exam due to her South Korean nationality. On October 15, 2006, Akira Machida retired upon reaching the age of 70. He was succeeded by Niro Shimada."

  "text" : "Aeneas of Gaza (d. c. 518) was a Neo-Platonic philosopher, a convert to Christianity, who flourished towards the end of the fifth century. In a dialogue entitled Theophrastus he alludes to Hierocles of Alexandria as his teacher, and in some of his letters mentions as his contemporaries writers whom we know to have lived at the end of the fifth century and the beginning of the sixth, such as Procopius of Gaza. Like all the Christian Neo-Platonists, Aeneas held Plato in higher esteem than Aristotle, although his acquaintance with Plato's doctrine was acquired through traditional teaching and the study of apocryphal Platonic writings, and not—to any great extent, at least—through the study of the genuine Dialogues. Like Synesius, Nemesius, and others, he found in Neo-Platonism the philosophical system which best accorded with Christian revelation. But, unlike Synesius and Nemesius, he rejected some of the most characteristic doctrines of the Neo-Platonists as being inconsistent with Christian dogma. For instance, he rejected the doctrine of pre-existence (according to which the soul of man existed before its union with body), arguing that the soul before its union with the body would have been \"idle\", incapable of exercising any of its faculties. Similarly, he rejected the doctrine of the eternal duration of the world, on the ground that the world is corporeal, and, although the best possible \"mechanism\", contains in itself the elements of dissolution Again, he taught that \"man's body is composed of matter and form\", and that while the matter perishes the \"form\" of the body retains the power of resuscitating the \"matter\" on the last day."

  "text" : "Agapetus was a deacon of the church of Hagia Sophia at Constantinople (about 500), reputed tutor of Justinian, and author of a series of exhortations in seventy-two short chapters addressed (ca. 527) to that emperor (Patrologia Graecae, LXXXVI, 1153–86). The first letters of each chapter form an acrostic of dedication that reads: \"The very humble Deacon Agapetus to the sacred and venerable Emperor Justinian\" (ἔκθεσις κεφαλαίων παραινετικῶν σχεδιασθεῖσα). The repute in which this work was held appears from its common title, viz. the Royal Sections (σχέδη βασιλικὰ). The book deals in general terms with the moral, religious, and political duties of a ruler. In form it is quite sententious and rhetorical, and resembles closely a similar work in the romance of Barlaam and Josaphat. Both of these seem to be based on Isocrates, and on Basil the Great and Gregory of Nazianzus. The work of Agapetus was eminently fitted for the use of medieval teachers by reason of its content, the purity of its Greek diction, and its skillful construction. It was widely current in Russia providing the formulations of monarchical ideology. It was translated into Latin, French and German and was highly commended by the humanists of the Renaissance. Some twenty editions of it appeared in the sixteenth century."

Lewis was the President and CEO of Kmart at the time of the merger. That job carried the distinction of making Lewis the highest ranking African-American executive in the U.S. retail industry. His authority increased immeasurably just a month later, when Kmart announced an $11 billion merger with another leading American retailer, Sears, Roebuck, which made him head of the third-largest retail chain in the United States. He holds the following academic degrees: BA in English ('76), BS in Hotel and Restaurant Management ('76), and an MBA ('90)—all from the University of Houston. Aylwin Lewis also received a master's degree from Houston Baptist University. Lewis inherited his bookworm habit from his mother, and travels the world for pleasure when not in the office.

  "text" : "Albert \"Albie\" Tedham (9 February 1926 – 16 November 1980) was a well known fiddler and pianist. Albert was born Albert Thomas Tedham in Langholm, Scotland on 9 February 1926 at 35 Kirk Wynd, Langholm. He was educated in Langholm Academy, in the original academy building which became the Langholm Primary building after the new Langholm Academy was built. He later worked at Arthur Bell's Mill. Albert had considerable musical talent from a young age. He was deaf, however was able to play through feeling and recognising each of the unique vibrations of the strings or keys of the instruments he played. Despite his disability, he managed to win over 300 trophies for his efforts. Albert was known to have performed on Border Television and played annually at the traditional Common Riding Concert and at some of the ride outs. In 1979 he and the Stewart Sneedon band together released a record named The Border Dance band at Gretna Hall. On a number of occasions he played with the great Jimmy Shand. He became one of Scotland's most renowned fiddlers of the time. Albert also had a love for his local community and was well liked and well known by many of the people of Langholm and its surrounding areas. He would often go to entertain the elderly at the Erkinholme House and would play 'Pop Goes the Weasel' to entertain local children. In 1958 he married Sarah Bell. Together they had 5 sons and 1 daughter. His children loved him greatly. He would often perform 'magic' tricks to entertain them in their younger years. One of their favourite tricks involved making sweets appear. He would do this by wrapping a towel around his hand in which the sweets were concealed and ask them to say the magic words before revealing them for his children to enjoy. Sadly, on 16 November 1980, aged 54, Albert Tedham died at home, surrounded by his family. He had been diagnosed with terminal lung cancer however, actual cause of death was coronary thrombosis. He was then buried in the Langholm Cemetery."

He successively held the posts of: district nurse, assistant matron, area officer of the Royal College of Nursing and Principal of the William Rathbone Staff College, Liverpool. He followed this by the appointment as Chief Nursing Officer over nine hospitals in the Wirral, Cheshire. He ended this part of his career by becoming Chief Nursing Officer over 17 hospitals and the community nursing services in the city of Newcastle-upon-Tyne for twelve years. During that time he was also a pastoral elder of the Assemblies of God Church Bethshan in the city. Anthony became chairman of two important working parties at the department of health. In 1975 he chaired a working party of the Education and Training of SRN/RGN in District Nursing and later chaired another group on the Education and Training of the Enrolled Nurse in the Community. Action on the former report resulted in district nurse training being moved to colleges of further and higher education and paved the way for the present degree in district nursing. For this work he was awarded a Fellowship of the Royal College of Nursing. He was one of four members of a committee (Cumberledge) set up by the Secretary of State for Health in 1985 to review the Community Nursing Services in England.The Report is entitled,Neighbourhood Nursing - A Focus for Change.

  "text" : "Adolph Goldschmidt (15 January 1863 – 5 January 1944) was a Jewish German art historian. He was born in Hamburg. After a short business career he devoted himself (1885) to the study of the history of art at the universities of Jena, Kiel, and Leipzig. He took his degree in 1889 with the dissertation Lübecker Malerei und Plastik bis 1530, the first detailed analysis of the medieval art of northeast Germany. After traveling through Germany, Denmark, Sweden, the Netherlands, England, France, and Italy, on the presentation of his work Der Albanipsalter in Hildesheim und Seine Beziehung zur Symbolischen Kirchenskulptur des 12. Jahrhunderts (1895), he became Privatdozent at the University of Berlin. His Studien zur Geschichte der Sächsischen Skulptur in der Uebergangszeit vom Romanischen zum Gotischen Stil (Berlin, 1902) traces the gradual development of German sculpture with reference to the period of its florescence in the thirteenth century. His \"Die Kirchenthür des Heil. Ambrosius in Mailand\" (1902) for the first time showed the door of the Basilica of Sant'Ambrogio in Milan to be a monument of early Christian art. He also contributed a number of important articles on North-German painting, Saxon sculpture, and early medieval miniature manuscripts to the Repertorium für Kunstwissenschaft, Zeitschrift für Christliche Kunst, and Jahrbuch der Kgl. Preussischen Kunstsammlungen. Being of Jewish origin, he had to flee Nazi Germany and died in Basel, Switzerland in 1944, aged 80."

On February 25, 70 men were secreted within the peat-filled boat, remembered by the Dutch as the Turfschip van Breda. Adriaen van Bergen however overslept, so the plan had to be delayed. The next day, Adriaen van Bergen suddenly withdrew from the operation. He had to be replaced by two nephews. With this new crew, the attack was successful and the essential fortress of Breda fell to Maurice. Adriaen van Bergen's grandson Adriaen van der Donck played an important role at the colonization of New Netherland."

  "text" : "Ambrose Godfrey-Hanckwitz FRS (1660 – 15 January 1741), also known as Gottfried Hankwitz, also written Hanckewitz, or Ambrose Godfrey as he preferred to be known, was a German-born British phosphorus manufacturer and apothecary. He was one of the first phosphorus manufacturers and was one of the best and most successful in his time. He invented and patented a machine that acted as a fire extinguisher. Godfrey was born in Nienburg in Saxony. In 1679, aged 19, he and his wife travelled to London where he was to work as an assistant to Robert Boyle, trying to produce phosphorus. Boyle is remembered as the first chemist, but his earliest interests were in alchemy, and he wanted to learn about the then new phosphorus. Boyle had employed German alchemist Johann Becher who was in London looking for work. Becher recommended Ambrose Godfrey as an assistant. Boyle knew from hints given by Daniel Kraft (when he had demonstrated phosphorus) that it was made from human urine or maybe faeces, but neither Boyle's first employee Bilger nor then Becher and Godfrey were able to make it. But Becher knew that its first discoverer Hennig Brandt had the secret. Godfrey was sent to Hamburg to see Brandt and came back with the missing key: that very high temperatures were needed. On his return Godfrey tried a new batch of urine. He used so much heat that it cracked the retort, but Boyle saw the residue in the broken container glowed faintly, so they were on the right track. Godfrey's job became making phosphorus for Boyle, and he acquired skill at it. His procedure was the same as Brandt's, namely to boil human urine down to a residue, then heat that strongly to give off phosphorus gas which would condense. Godfrey produced two forms: solid phosphorus (the white phosphorus allotrope) and a mix with oil of urine where it remains liquid at room temperature. Godfrey was not always careful handling phosphorus; his fingers were often blistered and slow to heal from touching the solid. On one occasion on his way to see Boyle, a phial of phosphorus broke and burned holes in his breeches, which Boyle \"could not look upon without some wonder as well as smiles\". Initially Becher and Godfrey had got along well and they shared lodgings in Covent Garden. When Becher's wife arrived in London it seems she took a dislike to Godfrey and there were various disagreements. Godfrey helped the Bechers move to new lodgings, yet Mrs Becher would return to shout abuse and accusations. The worst was when Boyle reduced Becher's salary over lack of success in Becher's alchemical experiments. Becher blamed Godfrey, and Mrs Becher took to following Mrs Godfrey through the streets shouting abuse. But, as Godfrey wrote, \"thank God, all in German, that the people understood her not.\" By 1682 two years of research had satisfied Boyle's curiosity and Boyle and Godfrey parted. Godfrey was still interested in phosphorus and Boyle helped finance Godfrey's manufacture of it. In 1683 Godfrey named his first son Boyle Godfrey, in Boyle's honour. (He had two more sons, Ambrose and John.) By 1685, Godfrey had a going business. He had a furnace behind his lodgings and made use of the human wastes from the adjoining Bedford House estate. He advertised phosphorus at 50 shillings wholesale or 60 shillings retail an ounce, and was selling all he could make. He improved production by melting the final phosphorus and forcing it through a chamois leather to purify. But his main employment was at Apothecaries Hall, where in time he became master of the laboratory. Others tried to make phosphorus too, without success. It was supposed there was a step missing from what Boyle had published in 1682, a step only Godfrey knew. Godfrey had every reason to keep his methods secret, but the essentials were exactly as Boyle had set out. The only extra thing Godfrey knew was that faeces could be used as well as urine. Godfrey's business grew along with his reputation, and he took on employees, becoming known for producing the best phosphorus available. He sold within Britain and exported to Europe. By the early 18th century, Godfrey was thought to be selling as much as 50 lb a year, worth about £2,000, or about £600,000 in today's money. This was not his only business, but presumably the profit from such a turnover was significant. In 1707, Godfrey was wealthy enough to buy the lease to a new shop in Southampton Street where the Bedford House estate had stood. He opened a pharmacy, and he and his family lived above it. Under the lease he could not carry on \"obnoxious\" trade there, but the narrow strip of land behind was unrestricted, so he built a workshop there, where he and his staff made phosphorus, and where he gave demonstrations of it. Godfrey died on 15 January 1741 and his oldest son, Boyle Godfrey, took over the business. But Boyle dabbled in alchemy, wasted his inheritance, and had to live on a pension provided by his brothers Ambrose and John, who took over the business in 1742. Ambrose and John were also unsuccessful and in 1746 were declared bankrupt. The business passed to their nephew, Boyle's son, named Ambrose Godfrey after his grandfather. The younger Ambrose was successful, carrying on the business until his death in 1797, when it passed in turn to his son Ambrose Towers Godfrey, who formed a partnership with Charles Cooke. The firm Godfrey and Cooke continued until 1915. The Godfrey business' dominance in phosphorus did not last. It was overtaken by new methods such as that of Bertrand Pelletier using bones in the 1770s."

Eldred was awarded the coveted distinction of Eagle Scout on September 2, 1912, becoming the first of more than two million boys in the U.S. since then to earn Scouting's most vaunted rank. Eldred also received the Bronze Honor Medal for lifesaving, and was the first of four generations of Eagle Scouts in his family. A graduate of Cornell University, Eldred enlisted at age 22 in the United States Navy in January 1918, nine months after the U.S. entry into World War I. After serving aboard various Navy vessels and seeing combat in that conflict, he then worked in the agriculture and produce transportation industries, serving as a railroad industry official. Eldred continued as an active Scout leader and school board member throughout much of his adult life."

On 11 July 1423, Arnold of Egmond, who was still a boy in years, succeeded Duke Reinald IV. Arnold was the grandson of Reinald's sister, Johanna. Although the Emperor Sigismund had invested the Duke of Berg with the duchy of Gelders, Arnold retained the confidence of the Estates by enlarging their privileges, and enjoyed the support of Duke Philip of Burgundy. Arnold was betrothed, and afterwards united in marriage to Catherine of Cleves née Valois, a niece of Philip of Burgundy. Subsequently, however, Duke Arnold fell out with his ally as to the succession to the see of Utrecht; whereupon Philip joined with the four chief towns of Guelders in the successful attempt of Arnold's son Adolf to substitute his own for his father's authority. When Charles the Bold became Duke of Burgundy in 1467, after rejecting a compromise, Adolph was thrown into prison. Arnold, against the will of the towns and the law of the land, pledged his duchy to Charles for 300,000 Rhenish florins (1471). Upon Arnold's death two years later, Charles took possession of the duchy."

He is the first person to receive the rank of \"sepahbod\" (corps general or lieutenant general) under Reza Shah Pahlavi. He and his brother-in-law Heydargholli Pessian had planned to create a more democratic Iran but he later told his sister that 'the British would not allow it'. He served as Minister of War in the cabinet of Ali Soheili in 1942, and Abdolhosein Hazhir in 1948. He also served as Senator in the Majlis. It was said he was the only man Reza Pahlavi truly respected and feared. His sister was married into the Pessian family, and after the assassination of Colonel Pessian, she arranged for his body to be hidden from Reza Pahlavi."

  "text" : "Armando Aste (born 6 January 1926) is one of the most influential Italian alpinists of the postwar period. Aste was born in Rovereto near Trento, Trentino. He led the first Italian ascent of the Eiger north face in 1962, together with Pierlorenzo Acquistapace, Gildo Airoldi, Andrea Mellano, Romano Perego and Franco Solina. He also climbed for the first time the South Tower of Paine in Patagonia, one of the three Torres del Paine. Due to his numerous ascents in the Italian Dolomites, climbing routes have been named after him (e.g. the Aste-Susatti route in the Monte Civetta, near Belluno, Italy, first ascent by Armando Aste and Fausto Susatti on 26–28 July 1954). Further selected first ascents in the Dolomites by Armando Aste were: \n*  Cima del Focobon, together with Franco Solina, 16–19 August 1958; \n*  Piz Seranto south face, with Franco Solina, 10–15 August 1959; \n*  Crozzon di Brenta, with Milo Navasa, 26–28 August 1959; \n*  Marmolada d'Ombretta, with Franco Solina, 24–29 August 1964. Reinhold Messner was the first person who climbed this route again, which is called today the \"Aste route\" or \"Via dell'Ideale\". Jerzy Kukuczka was the first to dare the ascent at the end of winter (17–23 March 1973). His most important books are Pilastri del Cielo (Nordpress, Italy, 2000) and Cuore di Roccia (Manfrini Stampatori, Italy, 1988)."

  "text" : "Sir Albert Ruskin Cook, CMG, OBE, MD (22 March 1870 – 23 April 1951) was a British born medical missionary in Uganda, and founder of Mulago Hospital and Mengo Hospital. Together with his wife, Katharine Cook (1863–1938), he established a maternity training school in Uganda. Albert Cook was born in Hampstead, London in 1870. His parents were Dr. W.H. Cook and Harriet Bickersteth Cook. He graduated from Trinity College, Cambridge in 1893 with a Bachelor of Arts degree, and from St Bartholomew's Hospital in 1895 as a Bachelor of Medicine. He became a Doctor of Medicine in 1901. In 1896, Albert Cook went to Uganda with a Church Missionary Society mission, and in 1897 he established Mengo Hospital, the oldest hospital in East Africa. In 1899 he was joined by his older brother John Howard Cook, a surgeon and ophthalmologist. Albert Cook married Katharine Timpson, a missionary nurse, in 1900, with whom he had two daughters and a son. Katharine Timpson, who later became Katharine, Lady Cook was matron of Mengo Hospital 1897–1911, and the General Superintendent of Midwives, and Inspector of Country Centres. She was involved in the foundation of the Lady Coryndon Maternity Training School and founded the Nurses Training College in 1931. Sir Albert Cook is outstanding among medical missionaries for his efforts to train Africans to become skilled medical workers. He and his wife opened a school for midwives at Mengo and authored a manual of midwifery in Ganda, the local language. (Amagezi Agokuzalisa; published by Sheldon Press, London). Albert Cook started training African Medical Assistants at Mulago during the First World War, and in the 1920s, encouraged the opening of a medical College that initially trained Africans to the level defined by the colonial government as \"Asian sub-assistant surgeon\". The school grew to become a fully fledged Medical School in his lifetime. Albert Cook established a treatment centre for the venereal diseases and sleeping sickness in 1913, which later became Mulago Hospital. He was President of the Uganda Branch of the British Medical Association (BMA) between 1914 and 1918, during which time he founded a school for African medical assistants. He was awarded the Order of the British Empire in 1918, the Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George, and received knighthood in 1932. In 1936–37, he was again President of BMA (Uganda Branch). Lady Cook died in 1938 and Sir Albert Cook died on 23 April 1951 in Kampala."

  "text" : "Arthur Sanders Way (13 February 1847 – 25 September 1930), was a classical scholar, translator and headmaster of Wesley College, Melbourne, Australia. Arthur Way, son of the Rev. William Way and his wife Matilda, née Francis, was born at Dorking, England. He was educated at Kingswood School, Bath, and graduated M.A. at University of London. From 1870 to 1876 he was classical lecturer at Queen's College, Taunton, vice-master of Kingswood School, 1876 to 1881, and in 1882 became headmaster of Wesley College, Melbourne. He had already published his translation of the Odyssey of Homer, and while at Wesley brought out his translation of the Iliad. (See English translations of Homer#Way.) At Wesley he fostered the teaching of natural science, and also brought in the teaching of commercial principles for boys likely to pursue a business career, but the number of students went down during his period, largely because of the financial depression which began in 1889. He resigned in 1892 and spent most of the rest of his life in translating from the classics. Probably no other translator could compare with Way in fertility and versatility. Way's versions give accurate renderings of the meaning of the originals expressed in vigorous verse. The list of his translations in Miller's Australian Literature includes Odyssey, the Iliad, Euripides, Æschylus, Sophocles, the Epodes of Horace, Vergil's Georgics, the Nibelungenlied, the Chanson de Roland, Theocritus, Bion, Moschus, the New Testament Biblical letters of Paul and Hebrews entitled, The Letters of St. Paul to Seven Churches and Three Friends with The Letter to the Hebrews, Aristophanes, Hesiod, Virgil, Lucretius, The Lay of the Nibelung Men, The Song of Roland and others. Way was also the author of Homer (1913), Greek through English (1926), and Sons of the Violet-Crowned, a Tale of Ancient Athens (1929). Way had been president of the Melbourne Shakespeare Society and a councillor of the Royal Society of Victoria.Way died at Ventnor, Isle of Wight, on 25 September 1930."

His Ph.D. (kandidat) dissertation Unitary representations of nilpotent Lie groups was published in 1962. He was awarded the degree of Doctor of Science. At the time he was the youngest Doctor of Science in the Soviet Union. He worked at the Moscow State University until 1994 when he became the Francis J. Carey Professor of Mathematics at the University of Pennsylvania. During his school years, Kirillov was a winner of many mathematics competitions, and he is still an active organizer of Russian mathematical contests. Kirillov is an author of many popular school-oriented books and articles. In 2012 he became a fellow of the American Mathematical Society. Kirillov's son, Alexander Kirillov, Jr., is also a mathematician, working on the representation theory of Lie groups at the State University of New York at Stony Brook."

  "text" : "Adeline Miller, alias Adeline Furman (1777 – August 24, 1859), was an American madam and prostitute. According to her contemporary George Templeton Strong, Miller was active in New York City prostitution from the late 1810s. By 1821, she was running a brothel on Church Street, where she had accumulated personal effects worth at least $500. Over Miller's 30-year career, she became quite wealthy. At one point or another, Miller ran houses on Duane, Elm, Orange and Reade streets. She owned, but did not manage, another brothel on Cross Street. Rumors suggested that, in the 1840s, she charged her girls $14 a week to stay in her brothels. By 1855, she had many personal residences; the one on Church Street alone contained effects valued at $5,000. Miller was a celebrity as well. Her name appeared in tourist guidebooks and in the diaries of rich New Yorkers. The Libertine opined that she and Phoebe Doty, another madam, should rent New York's Park Theatre and talk about their exploits. The paper predicted that \"the house would be crammed if the entrance was five dollars a head. The bigger the harlot now-a-days the more money is made.\" By the 1840s, the aging Miller had become the subject of negative press, particularly from the Whip. The paper called her a \"grey-haired hag\" and \"the most wicked procuress in the city\". Miller had children, though all entered more mainstream professions."

  "text" : "Alter Kacyzne (May 31, 1885 in Vilnius, Russian Empire – July 7, 1941 in Ternopil, General Government for the Occupied Polish Territories) was a Jewish (Yiddish) writer, poet and photographer who was killed during the Holocaust. He traveled throughout Poland after World War I, chronicling Jewish life. Kacyzne tried to escape Nazi persecution in Poland and moved to Ternopil in 1941. Unfortunately, by the time he arrived Nazis already occupied the city. He was beaten to death by Ukrainian collaborators during the extermination of the town's Jewish population. His wife Khana was killed in the concentration camp, while his daughter Sulamita survived hiding in Poland as a non-Jew."

  "text" : "Albertus Christiaan van Raalte (October 17, 1811, Wanneperveen, Netherlands – July 27, 1876, Holland, Michigan) was a 19th-century Dutch Reformed clergyman. Van Raalte was first ordained in the Secession Church in 1836, before moving to the United States, and was eventually ordained in the Reformed Church in America. When he visited the lower peninsula of Michigan, he found the area to be what he believed to be ideal for farming, the occupation of many in the Netherlands who were being burdened by high taxes and very little land, so little that farmers could no longer divide their land between their sons as an inheritance. Van Raalte sent home a handbill with such glowing descriptions of the area that many farmers' sons emigrated, cleared the heavily wooded land and found the farming to be fruitful. Van Raalte himself was the spiritual leader for the Protestant, Reformed, Dutch immigrants who founded the city of Holland, Michigan in 1846 and played an important role in establishing the school that would become Hope College. Dominee (Reverend) van Raalte's personal papers are housed at the Heritage Hall Archives of Calvin College."

Kokorinov has been house architect of the Razumovsky family and Ivan Shuvalov, the first President of the Academy. Kokorinov's surviving architectural legacy, once believed to be substantial, has been reduced by recent research to only two buildings, the Imperial Academy of Arts and Kirill Razumovsky palace in Saint Petersburg. The Academy was designed by Jean-Baptiste Vallin de la Mothe based on an earlier proposal by Jacques-François Blondel, while Kokorinov managed the construction in its early phases (1764–1772)."

According to the creation myth of the Abrahamic religions, he was the first human. In the Genesis creation narratives, he was created by God. Christian churches differ on how they view Adam's subsequent behavior of disobeying God (often called the Fall of man), and to the consequences that those actions had on the rest of humanity. Christian and Jewish teachings sometimes hold Adam and Eve (the first woman) to a different level of responsibility for the Fall, though Islamic teaching holds both equally responsible. In addition, Islam holds that Adam was eventually forgiven, while Christianity holds that redemption occurred only later through the sacrifice of Jesus Christ. The Bahá'í Faith, Islam and some Christian denominations consider Adam to be the first prophet."

  "text" : "Antonio Maria Gasparo Sacchini (14 June 1730 – 6 October 1786) was an Italian composer, most famous for his operas. Sacchini was born in Florence, but raised in Naples, where he received his musical education. He made a name for himself as a composer of serious and comic opera in Italy before moving to London, where he produced works for the King's Theatre. He spent his final years in Paris, becoming embroiled in the musical dispute between the followers of the composers Gluck and Niccolò Piccinni. His early death in 1786 was blamed on his disappointment over the apparent failure of his opera Œdipe à Colone. However, when the work was revived the following year, it quickly became one of the most popular in the 18th-century French repertoire."

  "text" : "Count Andrey Artamonovich Matveev (Russian: Андрей Артамонович Матвеев) (1666–1728) was a Russian statesman of the Petrine epoch best remembered as one of the first Russian ambassadors and Peter the Great's agent in London and the Hague. Andrey Matveyev was the son of the more famous Artamon Matveyev by a Scottish woman, Eudoxia Hamilton. At the age of eight he was granted a rank of chamber stolnik (комнатный стольник) but was exiled together with his father during Feodor III's early reign. The Matveyevs returned to Moscow on 11 May 1682, and four days later Artamon Matveyev was killed by the rebellious Streltsy during the Moscow Uprising of 1682, while Andrey fled the capital again. In 1691–1693 he served as voyevoda in the Dvina Region. Peter the Great, who had deeply respected Matveyev the elder and whose own mother had been brought up in the Matveyev family, sent him in 1700 as ambassador extraordinary and plenipotentiary, firstly in the Dutch Republic (1699–1712), afterwards in Austria (1712–1715), where he was granted in 1715 a comital title of the Holy Roman Empire. In 1705, Matveev did not succeed in his Paris mission to treat with France on trade issues. He then settled in London with the purpose of persuading Queen Anne to mediate between Sweden and Russia and not to acknowledge Stanisław Leszczyński as King of Poland. Just before leaving England, Matveyev was accosted and apprehended by some bailiffs, \"a Brutal sort of People\", who made his release contingent on payment of 50 pounds. Having suffered verbal and physical abuse, Matveyev reported to the Russian Foreign Office that the English \"have no respect for common law whatsoever\". Despite subsequent apologies from the Parliament and the Queen, the diplomatic corps in London raised such an outcry over the incident that it led the Parliament to adopt the Act Preserving the Privileges of Ambassadors (April 21, 1709), the first-ever act to guarantee diplomatic immunity. In 1716, Matveyev was recalled to St Petersburg, where he received the rank of Privy Counsellor and was appointed to run a naval academy. Three years later, he became Senator and President of Justice Collegium. For three years before his retirement in 1727 he presided over the senate office in Moscow. His daughter Maria — rumoured to have been the tsar's mistress — was the mother of Field-Marshal Peter Rumyantsev. In his declining years, presumably influenced by Pyotr Shafirov's research on Russian history, Matveyev described the Moscow Uprising of 1682, appending a summary account of the subsequent events up to 1698. The book is written in florid, antiquated language replete with outlandish spellings. It has a tangible bias: the actions of tsarevna Sofia and her party are painted as evil, while those of the Naryshkins and the author's father are immoderately glorified."

  "text" : "Abdelwahid Aboud Mackaye (born 1953) is a Chadian insurgent leader involved in the war to topple the Chadian President Idriss Déby. Originally a fighter in the Democratic Revolutionary Council (CDR) militia during the first Chadian Civil War, under Déby he became a civil servant before defecting to the rebels in 2003. After having been for a time first in the FUC and later in the UFDD, he has founded in 2007 the UFDD-Fundamental, which has participated in February 2008 to the unsuccessful attack on N'Djamena. A Missiria Arab, Abdelwahid was born in 1953 near to Oum Hadjer in Batha. He fought as a CDR militian in 1980 in the second battle of N'Djamena which saw confronted the President Goukouni Oueddei and his Defence Minister Hissène Habré; during the confrontation Abdelwahid was wounded, and since then he has always limped. Successively he became a civil servant, and occupying under the government of Idriss Déby the office of subprefect. In 2003 Abdelwahid broke with Déby and passed in open rebellion. He became secretary-general of the Chadian rebel group FIDEL, and, after the group's union with other organizations, one of the leaders of the newly formed United Front for Democratic Change (FUC) rebel alliance, founded in December 2005 and under the presidency of Mahamat Nour Abdelkerim. On January 19, 2006, Abdelwahid was arrested, along with nineteen other rebels, after participating in an interview to Radio France Internationale in the Sudanese capital of Khartoum, in which he stated that \"FUC's relations with the Sudanese government are friendly - very close\", and argued that this was in line with the tradition under which successive Chadian rebellions had seized power with some degree of support from Khartoum. The Sudanese government repeatedly denied the accusation of Chadian President Idriss Déby that the Sudanese government was providing financial and material support to the FUC. He was released from jail shortly after. His arrest was denounced by the Dakar-based human rights organization Rencontre africaine pour la défense des droits de l'homme (RADDHO) Abdelwahid organized in April together with Nour the attack on the capital, which ended in a defeat for the rebels. During those days Déby arrested for fear of collusion with the rebels the general Ahmat Fadoul Makaye, the Chadian army's Deputy Chief of Staff and cousin of Abdelwahid. He was cleared of all suspicions and freed three days later. The latter was removed on September 26 with Issa Moussa Tamboulé from the FUC's political bureau; he was allegedly suspected of secretly plotting with the Déby government. Around the same time Abdelwahid, who represented an Arab faction increasingly hostile to Nour since his failed attack, using his position of secretary-general destituted Nour. Following this, Abdelwahid with a group of FUC dissidents united with Acheikh ibn Oumar's Democratic Revolutionary Council (CDR) and Mahamat Nouri's Union of Forces for Progress and Democracy (UFPD) to found on October 22 the Union of Forces for Democracy and Development (UFDD). In April 2007, a major crisis shook the UFDD, when the Vice-President Acheikh ibn Oumar demanded Nouri a major role to his men in movement's apparatus. Nouri refused and expelled Acheikh and consolidated the control of his ethnic group, the Gorane, over the UFDD After Acheikh, also Abdelwahid, anxious to retake his freedom of movement from Nouri, left the UFDD and founded in May with Acheikh a new armed group, the Union of Forces for Democracy and Development-Fundamental (UFDD-F), an Arab-dominated group estimated to count on about 500 militians. Abdelwahid took part to the peace talks held through Libyan mediation in Tripoli between the Chadian government and the leaders of four rebel movements, the UFDD with Nouri, the Rassemblement des Forces pour le Changement (RFC) with Timane Erdimi, The Chadian National Concord with Hassan Saleh al-Djinedi and the UFDD-F. At the beginning of the talks on June 23, Abdelwahid stated that the \"problem is mostly of a constitutional order\", adding that they \"demand a revision of the constitution to reopen the road to transition\". An important stage in the talks was reached on October 3 when the government and the four rebel groups signed an accord in Tripoli on power-sharing in the government and the integration of the rebel forces in the Chadian army. Among the rebel leaders, Abdelwahid was the only one to call the paper signed a \"definitive accord\", while the others only considered it provisional. Due to the latters objection the four rebel leaders signed on October 25 a new accord in Surt, presumed to be definitive, under which the armed movements would disarm in November and become political parties. The accord was broken already on November 26, giving way to violent fighting between the rebels and the government. In December, due to Sudanese pressures, reapproached himself to Nouri and Erdimi, forming with them in mid-December a Unified Military Command with Abderahman Koulamallah as spokesman. Abdelwahit claimed that after his bases within Sudan were attacked twice by the Chad Air Force, first on December 28 and later on January 6, 2008. By the end of January, the three rebels leaders put on the ground 3,000 men for an attack on the capital to deal onca and for all with Déby. The forces reach the capital, but are defeated after a battle that leaves 160 dead on the ground, forcing the rebels to retreat."

  "text" : "Albert Sadacca (February 6, 1901 – December 1980) is credited with popularizing electric Christmas tree lights for private use. According to the legend, in 1917, at the age of 15, after a fire in New York City started by candles suspended in a tree, Sadacca adapted the novelty lighting that his parents sold for use in Christmas trees. A similar story is told about Ralph E. Morris, who created an electric light set using a telephone switchboard in 1908. Earlier electric Christmas tree lights had been used in 1885 in Grover Cleveland's White House, and in 1882 at the home of Edward H. Johnson, a vice-president of the Edison Electric Light Company. Other sources indicate that Albert and his brothers, Henri and Leon, founded their business in 1914 (three years before the fire, when Albert would presumably have been only 12 years old). Nevertheless, in 1925, Sadacca's company, enjoying success in the new Christmas light business, proposed that several companies then competing for the market join together as a trade organization. The name of the organization was The National Outfit Manufacturer's Association. The association merged into a single company the following year, and began several decades of dominance in the rapidly growing Christmas lighting market as the NOMA Electric Company."

  "text" : "Adam Easton (c. 1328/1338 – 15 September 1397) was an English Cardinal, born at Easton in Norfolk. He joined the Benedictines at Norwich moving on to the Benedictine Gloucester College, Oxford where he became one of the most outstanding students of his generation, being especially proficient in Hebrew. He is known to have accompanied Simon Langham to Rome, then Montefiascone and Avignon and he held the post of socius in Langham's household. Being a man of learning and ability, he obtained a post in the Curia. He was instrumental in the attack and subsequent condemnation of John Wycliff and supporting Catholic orthodoxy in England. He was made a Cardinal by Urban VI, on 21 September 1381. On 7 March 1381 or 1382, he was nominated Dean of York. He arranged Richard II and Anne of Bohemia's wedding coronation in the Abbey and probably composed the Liber Regalis. A document in the Abbey concerning the coronation offerings gives him as Cardinal of Santa Cecilia in Trastevere. In 1385 he was imprisoned at Nocera in Campania by Urban on a charge of conspiring with five other cardinals against the pope and was deprived of his cardinalate and deanery. With his fellow captives he was dragged across Italy arriving at Genoa in autumn 1385. Here the others were put to death but Adam was spared through the personal intervention of Richard II. The next pope, Boniface IX, restored his cardinalate on 18 December 1389. It has been suggested that for a time Easton returned to England. The Norwich Record Office documents the sending of the Cardinal's books by way of the Low Countries to Norwich for his use there. He retained benefices in England throughout this period, including Somersham, the deanery of York and a prebend in Salisbury Cathedral, which he subsequently exchanged for the living of Heygham (Heigham) in Norfolk. He wrote many works the most significant of which was a massive volume entitled the Defence of Ecclesiastical Power, of which only the prologue and first book survive. In it he defended the church's authority against the state, apparently attacking the views of Marsilius of Padua, John of Jandun and William of Occam and by implication, also refuting Wyclif's theology as false and erroneous. He was always courteous to his opponents, referring to them as 'men of great learning and abundance of sanctity'. A number of his other works still exist, as do some of the manuscripts of his library, which were shipped back to Norwich from Rome in six barrels, and he composed the Office for the Visitation of Our Lady. He also laboured for the canonization of Birgitta of Sweden in 1391 with a structured refutation of a Perugian 'Devil's Advocate', in a document in which he defended women's visionary writings. He may have been Julian of Norwich's spiritual director, editing her Long Text Showing of Love in the same way that Birgitta of Sweden's spiritual director, Alfonso of Jaen, edited her Revelationes. Alfonso became director to Catherine of Siena, whose confessor and executor was William Flete, the Cambridge-educated Augustinian Hermit of Lecceto, and to Chiara Gambacorta. Easton's Defense of St Birgitta echoes Alfonso of Jaen's Epistola Solitarii, and William Flete's Remedies against Temptations, all of which appear in Julian's text. He died at Rome, 15 September (according to others, 20 October) 1397. His tomb, constructed later, is in his Cardinalate Basilica of Santa Cecilia in Trastevere."

  "text" : "Anton Fils (also Antonín Fils, Johann Anton Fils, Johann Anton Filtz), 22 September 1733 (baptized) – 14 March 1760 (buried) was a German classical composer. Fils was born in Eichstätt, in the Bishopric of Eichstätt. Long thought to have been of Bohemian origin (e.g., ), despite having been described as \"from Bavaria\" by Friedrich Wilhelm Marpurg in 1756, his true origins were discovered in the 1960s (). Fils studied law and theology at the University of Ingolstadt, and in 1754 became part of the \"Mannheimer Hofkapelle\" as a cellist. The Mannheim orchestra at the time was led by Johann Stamitz (). In 1757 Fils married Elizabeth Range, and in 1759 the couple bought a house. Even though he died at only age 26, he left an extensive body of work, including at least thirty-four symphonies. Although he composed about thirty concertos, mainly for cello and for flute, only about half have survived (). Fils died in Mannheim and was buried on 14 March 1760 (). In his book Ideas for an Aesthetic of Music (posthumously published in 1806), author-musician Christian Friedrich Daniel Schubart called Fils \"the greatest composer of symphonies who ever lived\" (, 141). He also attributed Fils' early death to \"his bizarre notion of eating spiders\" (, 141). Retellings of this legend were elaborated to include Fils assuring horrified observers that spiders tasted like fresh strawberries (). The tale still circulates as a curious bit of classical music trivia (,)."

  "text" : "Count Aleksandr Ivanovich Shuvalov (Russian: Алекса́ндр Ива́нович Шува́лов; 1710–1771) was a Russian statesman from the Shuvalov family. His career was dependent on and overshadowed by that of his more brilliant brother, Pyotr Ivanovich Shuvalov. The Shuvalov brothers were two sons of a general who commanded the castle of Vyborg and governed Arkhangelsk during the reign of Empress Anna. They were the closest aides to Elizabeth Petrovna during the 1741 coup d'etat that brought her to the throne. Alexander, in particular, persuaded many of his fellow imperial guards to join Elizabeth's cause. He was rewarded for his allegiance with the rank of Chamberlain in 1741 and the title of count in 1746. For many years Shuvalov presided over the Secret Chancellory, a sort of political police whose victims included his personal enemies, Field-Marshals Bestuzhev and Apraksin. By the end of Elizabeth's reign, the Shuvalovs successfully eliminated all their political rivals and virtually monopolized state power. They also flirted with the future Peter III of Russia, hoping to retain their positions after his eventual accession to the throne. Their intrigues succeeded in 1761 when Peter III assumed the throne and promoted both Shuvalovs to Field Marshals, although they had never taken part in any war. But their careers were undone within a year, as the throne was usurped by Peter's wife Catherine, who detested the Shuvalovs for their pernicious influence on her husband and even accused in her memoirs Alexander Shuvalov of plotting to murder her. Thereupon Shuvalov retired from service and withdrew to his villages. His only daughter was the wife of Count Golovkin."

  "text" : "Sir Adamji Peerbhoy (1846–1913) was an Indian business magnate, philanthropist and a social reformist of Dawoodi Bohra community based at Bombay in British India. Adamji Peerbhoy was born in the year 1846 at Dhoraji in Princely State of Gondal of British India now Gujarat, in a very poor Dawoodi Bohra family to Qadir bhai and Sakina Banu Peerbhoy. Adamji Peerbhoy started his career at age of 13, as a street vendor in Bombay, selling match boxes but in one of the \"rags to riches\" stories being helped by two persons in his early life, one Seth Lukmanji and other an Englishman, Lt. Smith. Later by his untiring efforts and ability by the turn of the 19th century, became one of India's largest cotton manufacturers and wealthiest men. At one point he employed more than 15,000 workers in his cotton mills and supplied the canvas used for the tents and khaki uniforms of the British soldiers during the Second Boer War. He established several factories manufacturing thousands of tents and shoes for British soldiers and was also the owner of the Western Indian Tanneries, one of the largest tannery in Asia. It is thought that he first made his money from shipbuilding, and then diversified into trade and commercial interests. Adamji Peerbhoy became appointed as the first Indian Sheriff of Mumbai in 1897 and was also appointed as Justice of Peace. Later, Peerbhoy became the first president of the Muslim League for a time, presiding over its first session in Karachi in December 1907. In 1900 he was honoured by the title of `Qaisare-Hind'. In 1907 he was made a knight and given the title of `Sir’ by the British Government. Though an illiterate, Sir Adamji was honoured by Mohammedan Educational Conference to be its first president. He was also known as 'Rafiuddin' in the Bohra community, the 49th Dai, Sayedna Mohammed Burhanuddin had conferred title of `Rafiuddin’ on him. In 1884, Adamji Peerbhoy had built several properties, Masjid, sanatorium, kabristan, and Amanbai Charitable Hospital on Charni Road opposite the railway station. The property was built for the benefit of the poor and the needy. He wanted to provide a safe haven for the travelers, poor, or needy to rest, use the Masjid for prayers, or the hospital if they needed it. In the year 1892, plague hit numerous parts of the Bombay State. Peerbhoy appointed doctors, arranged for vaccines & medicines from abroad and treated the public free of cost at the Amanbai Charitable hospital, for the sake of the nation. Among his other philanthropic works were distribution of grain during drought of Gujarat in 1877 and 1897, relief works at Burhanpur in 1866, relief works in Yemen, building of rest houses in Mecca, Medina, Karbala, starting orphanage in Kathiawar, starting at least 27 schools and funding establishment of Prince of Wells Science Institute at Aligarh Muslim University, to name a few. Peerbhoy financed his son, Abdul Hussein Peerbhoy's construction of the Matheran Hill Railway which linked Matheran and Neral."

  "text" : "August Sabbe (September 1, 1909 – September 27 or 28, 1978) was one of the last surviving Estonian members of the Forest Brethren, a group of citizens of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania who resisted and fought against the Soviet occupation of their three nations. Sabbe hid in the forests of Estonia, living off of the land like other Forest Brethren. In 1978, at the age of 69, Sabbe was found near his birthplace of Paidra, Lasva Parish in southeastern Estonia by two KGB agents posing as fishermen. When they attempted to arrest him, he leaped into the Võhandu River and either drowned accidentally or deliberately wedged himself under a submerged log. The KGB, which took photographs before and after the attempted arrest, maintained that Sabbe drowned while attempting to escape. But some have observed that the river is narrow, sluggish and shallow at that point, an unlikely place for an accidental drowning, and that the open field on the opposite bank and the river's lazy loops gave an elderly man no place to flee from two young, physically fit pursuers. The Forest Brethren's code of conduct and the quickness of Sabbe's reaction suggest that Sabbe was prepared not to be taken alive. A stone monument to Sabbe stands in a pine grove overlooking the site of his death. It is located just west of Route 65 between Leevi and Tsolgo, almost exactly on the boundary between Põlva and Võru counties."

He published works on both classical and modern variants of this literature and argued strongly for giving local, non-standard dialects their due. Though he wrote widely and in a number of genres, Ramanujan's poems are remembered as enigmatic works of startling originality, sophistication and moving artistry. He was awarded the Sahitya Akademi Award posthumously in 1999 for his collection of poems, \"The Collected Poems\"."

  "text" : "Albert Hermann Dietrich (28 August 1829 – 20 November 1908), was a German composer and conductor, remembered less for his own achievements than for his friendship with Johannes Brahms. Dietrich was born at Golk, near Meissen. From 1851 he studied composition with Robert Schumann in Düsseldorf, where in October 1853 he first met Brahms and collaborated with Schumann and Brahms on the 'F-A-E' Sonata for Joseph Joachim (Dietrich composed the substantial first movement). From 1861 until 1890 he was the musical director at the court of Oldenburg, where Brahms often visited him and where he introduced many of Brahms’s works. It was in Dietrich’s library that Brahms discovered the volume of poetry by Hölderlin that furnished him with the text for his Schicksalslied, which he began composing while visiting Wilhelmshaven dockyard in Dietrich’s company. Dietrich was also instrumental in arranging for the premiere of Brahms’s Ein deutsches Requiem at Bremen in 1868. Dietrich’s own works include an opera Robin Hood, a Symphony in D minor (1869, dedicated to Brahms), a Violin Concerto in the same key (composed for Joseph Joachim but premiered in 1874 by Johann Lauterbach), a Cello Concerto, Horn Concerto, choral works and several chamber compositions including two piano trios. Dietrich's Recollections of Brahms, published in Leipzig in 1898, was translated into English the following year and remains an important biographical source. The Brahms scholar David Brodbeck has theorized (The Cambridge Companion to Brahms, 1999) that Dietrich is the most likely author of the anonymous Piano Trio in A major, discovered in 1924, which some scholars have attributed to Brahms; but Malcolm MacDonald (Brahms, 2nd ed, 2001) has maintained that, if any specific composer is to be sought for this work, Brahms remains the more likely candidate on balance of stylistic probabilities. Albert Dietrich died in Berlin. One of his students was Ernst Eduard Taubert."

  "text" : "Akabia ben Mahalalel (Hebrew: עקביא בן מהללאל‎‎), was a Jewish religious teacher, probably of the second tannaitic generation (1st and 2nd centuries). Of his early history nothing is known; there are no references to his teachers and comparatively few of his sayings have been preserved. The Mishnah portrays him as a man who fearlessly and persistently maintained opinions on some halakhot, even in cases where different traditions were held by the majority of his colleagues, because those opinions were founded on traditions he had received from his predecessors. On one occasion the majority demanded that he renounce his divergent opinions, but he refused. It was even intimated to him that in the event of his compliance he would be elevated to the position of Av Beit Din (president of the court), but Akabia rejected the proposition, remarking, \"I would rather be called a fool all my lifetime than be a sinner for one moment.\" His traditional burial location is in Kfar Manda in the Lower Galilee. In the course of the discussion of the halakah concerning the administration of \"the water of jealousy\" (Num. 5:11-31), Akabia declared that, if the subject of the test was not a free-born Jewess, the test-water was not to be administered; while the majority declared a proselyte or an emancipated slave to be the equal of a free-born daughter in Israel. In support of their view the majority cited a case in point, where the former associate presidents of the Sanhedrin, Shemaiah and Abtalion, had the test made on a freed woman; whereupon Akabia disdainfully exclaimed, Dugma hishḲuha. This might mean \"To one like themselves they gave to drink,\" and may be construed as an allusion to an old rumor to the effect that these associate presidents were themselves lineal descendants of proselytes; or it might mean \"They gave her a sham to drink.\" The memory of those chiefs being held in esteem, Akabia's insinuation gave offense; wherefore the sentence of nidduy (isolation, excommunication) was passed on him. This he bore to the end of his days rather than violate his convictions. However, before his death, he admonished his son to submit to the views of the majority, even in the cases where he himself had shown such persistent opposition. His son expressing surprise at so apparent an inconsistency, the dying sage replied: \"I have received my tradition from a majority of a school in my days, and so have my opponents. I was bound to conform to the tradition I had received; and so are they bound by their tradition. But thou hast heard the traditions both from myself and from my opponents; from a minority and from a majority, and it is proper for thee to reject the opinions of the individual and adopt the views of the majority\". Another characteristic trait of 'Akabia was the great stress he laid on personal merit. When, on his deathbed, he was requested by his son to recommend him to the sages, he declined to do so. His son inquired whether his father had discovered in him any trait which rendered him unworthy of such recommendation; and 'Akabia's reply was, \"No! but thine own deeds will make thee welcome, or thine own deeds will make thee obnoxious\". Akabia's motto in life was: \"Remember whence thou hast come, whither thou goest, and before whom thou must be prepared to render an account of thy doings\". Beyond this maxim and the halakot enumerated above, nothing from him has been transmitted. As to his epoch scholars are divided. While some place him in the patriarchate of Hillel I (30 BC to 10 of the present era), and even somewhat earlier, others bring him down to the first tannaitic generation (10-80); still others believe that he flourished during the patriarchate of Gamaliel II (80-117). The circumstances and scholastic achievements of the second tannaitic generation render Akabia's excommunication more reasonable. The decree of excommunication failed to obscure Akabia's merited fame; for his name reached subsequent generations surrounded by such a halo of glory as to throw doubt on the decree itself. \"God forbid,\" exclaims Judah b. Ilai, one of the tannaim of the fourth generation (139-165), \"that we should think that Akabia was excommunicated, for the Temple gates were never closed behind a man in Israel so great in wisdom and in the fear of sin as was Akabia ben Mahalalel\". This expression, which is based on the law forbidding an excommunicated person to enter the Temple court, was in later days taken literally, and gave rise to forced halakic discussions and comments, as well as to hypothetical speculations about the age of Akabia. Elsewhere  it is said, \"Whoever asserts that Akabia was ever excommunicated will have to answer before the tribunal of heaven.\" This observation is wrongly attributed to Judah b. Betera I; and conclusions as to Akabia's early age are erroneously deduced therefrom."

Tsakopoulos earned his Bachelor's from California State University, Sacramento. Tsakopoulos was fined by the United States Environmental Protection Agency for a violation of the Clean Water Act. Tsakopoulos sued the government and was able to bring his case to the U.S. Supreme Court, though the Court found against him. From the Association of State Wetland Managers: \"The case grew out of Tsakopoulos' preparations to subdivide part of the 8,350 acre (3,379 hectare) Borden Ranch into apple orchards and vineyards. He used a method of soil preparation called deep plowing or deep ripping to loosen the clay subsurface of nearly 1,000 acres (4,000 hectars) so that the roots of deep-growing trees and vines could penetrate. During the course of that work, about 2 acres (0.8 hectares) of wetlands also were plowed, although to lesser depths.\"\"But Tsakopoulos argued that normal farming practices, including deep plowing, were excluded specifically from the Clean Water Act.\"\"The government said that was true only if the plowing did not change the character of the farmland.\" Justice Anthony Kennedy had to recuse himself from the case because of his acquaintance with Tsakopoulos and only eight justices were left deciding the case. The ruling turned out to be a 4–4 tie. Because of the tie, the ruling against Tsakopoulos by the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals was automatically affirmed. In 2002, Tsakopoulos purchased a 70,000 volume collection on Hellenistic civilization and donated it to the library of California State University, Sacramento where it is available for use by the community . Tsakopoulos is a minority owner of the Sacramento Mountain Lions franchise of the United Football League."

Ollivant also published about a dozen other novels ranging from small-scale cautionary tales to grand historical stories. Alfred Ollivant was born in Nuthurst, Sussex, in 1874 and became an author after a horse-riding injury ended his brief military career. Owd Bob, his first novel, was published in 1898. Set in rural Cumbria, in northern England, the novel concerns a suspected sheepkilling collie, Bob. Even though most of the book's dialogue is written in the Cumbrian dialect, it became popular in the United States. Ollivant published a sequel, Danny, in 1902. He was also a short story contributor to the magazines The Atlantic Monthly and the Boston Evening Transcript. Alfred Ollivant died in London on January 19, 1927."

  "text" : "Alberto Remedios CBE (27 February 1935 – 11 June 2016)) was a British operatic tenor, especially noted for his interpretations of Wagner's heldentenor roles. Remedios was born in Liverpool and began his working life as a shipyard welder, but studied singing with Edwin Francis, who also taught Rita Hunter, and then at the Royal College of Music under Clive Carey. He sang a wide variety of roles with the Sadler's Wells Opera—the forerunner of English National Opera—including Alfredo in La traviata, the title role in Gounod's Faust, Samson in Saint-Saëns' Samson and Delilah, Bacchus in Ariadne auf Naxos and Max in Der Freischütz. He is especially remembered for his performances in Wagner, especially as Siegfried in the Glen Byam Shaw production of The Ring, conducted by Reginald Goodall. He was the first English tenor to sing Siegfried at Covent Garden since Walter Widdop in the 1930s. These performances were recorded in 1973, preserving Remedios' partnerships with Norman Bailey as Wotan and Rita Hunter as Brünnhilde. He was also memorable as Walther von Stolzing in the ground-breaking 1968 Sadler's Wells The Mastersingers of Nuremberg, also conducted by Reginald Goodall. Most remarkable of all was the occasion when Remedios, despite a slight chest infection, and due to the illness of another singer, played the roles of both Siegmund in Die Walküre, the title role in Siegfried, and also Siegfried in Götterdämmerung, within a complete cycle of the Ring during one week, these being at the Empire Theatre, Liverpool performances of the tour. Remedios sang the role of Mark in the first recording of Tippett's The Midsummer Marriage. Remedios performed in many of the world's leading operatic venues, including the Metropolitan Opera in New York City, Seattle, Frankfurt, San Francisco and Buenos Aires. In 1981, he was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE). His second wife was Australian and they lived in Sydney after his retirement in 1999. Remedios performed regularly in Australia – he sang in concert performances of Götterdämmerung at the Sydney Opera House in the late 1970s with Rita Hunter, conducted by Sir Charles Mackerras, and sang Lohengrin for Victoria State Opera in 1985. His brother Ramon also had a singing career as a tenor; on at least one occasion they were both in some performances by English National Opera of The Mastersingers. He died in Sydney on 11 June 2016, aged 81."

The two principal medieval Georgian chronicles – The Conversion of Kartli, and The Life of Kartli, – relate conflicting versions of Archil’s reign. The former story is extremely brief, but regretfully indicates that the positions of Zoroastrianism, an official Sasanid religion, was firm in Christian Iberia, a testimony to the effectively unchallenged Sasanid hegemony over the country. The other chronicle informs us of Archil’s successful rebellion against Iran, his victory over a punitive force and a retaliatory raid into Arran. The authenticity of this latter account has been questioned by modern scholars. Arch'il is also attested in two Armenian sources: Koryun’s The Life of Mashtots, cap. 18; and Moses of Chorene, III.60."

He served in the Royal Navy, and upon leaving the navy he became an actor. His first directorial assignment was Keep Fit. Kimmins wrote and directed many of George Formby's best comedies. During World War II he returned to the Navy, running the Navy newspaper in Sydney during the Pacific war. After the war he produced an eclectic mix of films, such as the psychological thriller Mine Own Executioner (1947), Bonnie Prince Charlie (1948) and Mr. Denning Drives North (1951). In the 1950s Kimmin's work included the Sir Alec Guinness comedy The Captain's Paradise and the children's Smiley series of films. His final film harked back to his early days – it was The Amorous Prawn (1962). He was the subject of This Is Your Life in 1961 when he was surprised by Eamonn Andrews at the BBC Television Theatre. He died in 1964, aged 62, at Hurstpierpoint, West Sussex, England."

  "text" : "Alexander Dmitriyevich Balashov (Russian: Александр Дмитриевич Балашов) (13 July 1770 in Moscow – 8 May 1837) was a Russian general and statesman. Balashov came from a noble family. When the boy turned 6 years, his father, a Privy Counsellor and Senator, had him enrolled in the Preobrazhensky Regiment though it was not until November 1781 that he entered the Page Corps, matriculating in 1787 with the rank of camer-page. On 9 January 1791 he joined the Izmaylovsky Regiment as lieutenant. From 1795 he was a lieutenant colonel in the regular army. He was promoted Colonel in April 1798 and Major General in 1799. On 21 January 1800 Balashov was dismissed from the military service, but in November of the same year he was appointed governor general and chief of garrisons regiment in Tallinn. On 23 September 1804 he resigned for family reasons, but within three months he was appointed the chief of police in Moscow. In November 1807 he became the general-krigs-komissar, on 29 March 1808 he replaced Fyodor Ertell in the office of chief of police in Saint Petersburg and thereupon his career soared. In February 1809 Alexander I conferred on Balashov the rank of Adjutant general and appointed him the War Governor of Saint Petersburg. In March 1809 he was promoted to lieutenant-general. From 1 January 1810 he was a member of the newly established State Council. In June the same year he became the Minister of Police. In 1812, during Napoleon's Invasion of Russia, Balashov was present in the front-line army stationed in Vilnius. After La Grande Armée crossed the frontier on June 12, Balashov was dispatched to deliver the Emperor's letter to Napoleon. He participated in the organization of the People's Militia (Народное ополчение) and was a member of the extraordinary committee choosing the commander-in-chief of the Russian army. After the Patriotic War of 1812 Balashov was involved in important diplomatic missions. Between 1819 and 1828, he served as the war governor general of Orel, Tula, Ryazan, Tambov and Voronezh. On 23 September 1834 Balashov resigned his office. He died on 8 May 1837 on his way to Kronstadt."

  "text" : "Artapanus of Alexandria (Gk. Ἀρτάπανος ὁ Ἀλεξανδρεύς) was a historian, of Jewish origin, who is believed to have lived in Alexandria, during the later half of the 3rd or 2nd century BCE. Although most scholars assume Artapanus lived in Alexandria, others argue he resided in the countryside. Regardless, Artapanus was of Egyptian origin. Artapanus wrote Concerning The Jews, a history of the Jews, in Greek between 250 and 100 BCE, but this text has not survived to the present. Artapanus’s writings may be interpreted as a response to those such as Manetho writing as early as the 3rd century BCE; therefore, Artapanus most likely wrote no earlier than the middle of the 3rd century. It is arguable that Artapanus wrote in the second half of the 2nd century BCE under the influence of Ptolemy IV Philopator’s reign between 221 and 204 BCE; however, Alexander Polyhistor’s citation of Artapanus in the middle of the 1st century BCE makes it likely that Artapanus wrote no later than the end of the 2nd century BCE. Polyhistor’s writings have not survived to the present. Parts of Polyhistor’s work have been preserved in the books of two later historians: \n* Eusebius of Caesarea in Præparatio Evangelica ix. 18, 23, 27 \n* Clement of Alexandria in Stromata i. 23, 154"

In 1946, immediately after Xydias was discharged from the United States Army Air Corps, he opened the So-Cal Speed Shop in Burbank, one of the first hot rod speed shops in Southern California. In 1950, he drove the first streamliner powered by a Flathead Ford to go over 200 mph (320 km/h). His hot rod was named the \"So-cal-Streamliner\" and powered by an Edelbrock V-8 60 engine. One secret to his success was a mixture of 40 percent nitromethane and not the grinding of the cam, as was commonly told. He is a member of the board of directors of the Wally Parks NHRA Motorsports Museum."

  "text" : "Count Alexander Borisovich Buturlin (Russian, in full: граф Александр Борисович Бутурлин; 1694–1767) was a Russian general and courtier whose career was much furthered by his good looks and personal affection of Empress Elizabeth. Buturlin came from the most senior Ratshid family, whose members had been prominent as boyars and voevods since the 12th century. His father, who served as the Captain of the Leub Guard, sent him to the newly established naval academy, where Alexander studied navigation, fencing, and foreign languages for four years. He graduated from the academy in 1720 and was employed by Peter the Great as his orderly and confidant, especially on several secretive missions during the Persian Expedition. In due time he was promoted Chamberlain and attached to the \"junior court\" of Tsesarevna Elizaveta Petrovna. The young officer impressed the princess so much that she was said to cherish an affection for him until her very end. It was widely rumoured that Elizabeth lost her virginity with him. Peter II of Russia, apparently jealous of Buturlin's influence on his beloved aunt, sent him away to Little Russia. During the following reign Buturlin's career slowly gathered momentum, as he operated against the Turks under Munnich and governed Smolensk in 1735. Upon Elizabeth's accession to the throne in 1741, his fortunes soared and he was sent to defend imperial interests in Lesser Russia. He then governed Livonia for a short time and commanded an army stationed in Moscow. In 1756 he was promoted Field Marshal, and four years later he was granted the hereditary title of count. The Seven Years' War was then escalating as the Russian forces approached Berlin. At the crucial moment Buturlin was unexpectedly appointed the commander-in-chief of the Russian army operating in Prussia. They say that Russian officers long refused to believe the news of his appointment, knowing Buturlin for a heavy drunkard. \"His good looks are his only merit\", a contemporary foreign diplomat commented on the issue. The campaign of 1760 justified uneasy apprehensions, as Buturlin's cautiousness often degenerated into timidity and the atmosphere was spoiled by his jealousy towards a more illustrious colleague, Laudon. The war over, he was recalled by Peter III to Moscow and given the task of preparing his coronation festivities. Buturlin died on 30 August 1767 and was interred in the Alexander Nevsky Monastery."

He was accused of majestas in AD 32, but was saved by Celsus, one of the informers. Shortly after the accession of Claudius, in AD 41, when Silanus was governor of Hispania Tarraconensis, he was recalled to Rome and married to Domitia Lepida, mother of the empress Messalina. He was treated with the greatest of distinction, but having refused the advances of Messalina herself, he was soon put to death by the emperor. Messalina and Narcissus accused him of plotting to assassinate Claudius, and claimed that they had seen Silanus attempting to murder the emperor in their dreams. Silanus' relationship to the other Junii Silani is uncertain. According to Ronald Syme, he and the Decimus Junius Silanus who had an affair with Julia the Younger, Marcus Junius Silanus, who was consul in AD 15, were the sons of Gaius Junius Silanus, the consul in AD 10. He is sometimes confused with Marcus Junius Silanus Torquatus, consul in AD 19. His marriage to Domitia was childless."

Born in Constantinople, Alexander Bogoridi was the youngest son of one of the most influential persons in the Ottoman Empire – Stefan Bogoridi – and brother of Nicolae Vogoride, who became a prominent Moldavian politician. Alexander Bogoridi studied in the Greek School in Phanar, in Constantinople and in France. He received his higher education in State Law in Germany. He held high-ranking positions as a statesman in the Ottoman Empire – member of the State Council, Minister of Public Works, Posts and Telegraphs, diplomatic agent in Moldavia, member of the diplomatic mission in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, and ambassador in Austria-Hungary (1876–1877). After the 1877–1878 War with the Russian Empire and the subsequent Treaty of Berlin with the protection of the Russian Emperor Alexander II and with the consent of the Great Powers, Alexander Bogoridi was appointed Governor-General of Eastern Rumelia on March 13, 1879. He was connected to the Liberal Party leaders expelled from the Principality of Bulgaria – Petko Slaveykov and Petko Karavelov. After the abdication of Prince Alexander I in 1886, Alexander Bogoridi was one of the candidates for the Bulgarian throne. He died in Paris."

  "text" : "Allen Campbell (December 30,1956 - August 20, 1994) was a zookeeper and elephant trainer and handler in his hometown of Jacksonville, Florida before moving to work in the Baton Rouge Zoo in the mid-1970s as the elephant keeper and trainer. He also ran the first elephant ride there. He advanced elephant care at the Baton Rouge Zoo by insisting that all of the elephants needed to be fed and watered and their enclosure cleaned every night as well as every day. He usually did this himself and was known to be a workaholic. He contracted to run the elephant ride and provide a baby elephant mascot for the Denver Zoo in 1986. He worked as an elephant consultant for many zoos including the National Zoo in Washington, D.C. He was heavily influenced by circus trainer Rex Williams and his life's ambition was to have a circus elephant act. He eventually worked as an elephant trainer for The Hawthorn Corporation. Campbell was crushed to death on August 20, 1994, at the Neal S. Blaisdell Center in Honolulu, Hawaii, after attempting to save fellow co-worker Dallas Beckwith from the performing elephant \"Tyke\", who had run amok. This is the same elephant that, according to USDA and Canadian law enforcement documents, while performing with Tarzan Zerbini Circus, \"The elephant handler was observed beating the elephant in public to the point [where] the elephant was screaming and bending down on three legs to avoid being hit. Even when the handler walked by the elephant after this, the elephant screamed and veered away, demonstrating fear from his presence.\" Allen Campbell's autopsy revealed that he had cocaine and alcohol in his system at the time of his death. Officials at the Denver Zoo confirm that Campbell was the target of complaints in the late 1980s that he abused zoo elephants while running an elephant and camel ride concession in Denver."

  "text" : "Annie Ernaux (born in Lillebonne, Seine-Maritime on 1 September 1940) is a French writer. She won the Prix Renaudot in 1984 for her book La Place, an autobiographical narrative focusing on her relationship with her father and her experiences growing up in a small town in France, and her subsequent process of moving into adulthood and away from her parents' place of origin. As a child, Annie Ernaux lived in Yvetot in Normandy. Very early in her career, she turned away from fiction to concentrate on autobiography. Her work combines historic and individual experiences. She charts her parents' social progression (La place, La honte), her adolescence (Ce qu’ils disent ou rien), her marriage (La femme gelée), her passionate affair with an eastern European man (\"Simple Passion\") her abortion (L’événement), Alzheimer's disease (Je ne suis pas sortie de ma nuit), the death of her mother (Une femme) and breast cancer (L’usage de la photo). Ernaux also wrote L'écriture comme un couteau (which should be understood as Writing as sharp as a knife) with Frédéric-Yves Jeannet. Her 2008 historical memoir Les années is considered by many to be her 'magnum opus': it was very well received by the French critics. In this book Ernaux writes of herself in the third person (elle) for the first time, providing a vivid look at French society from just after the Second World War until the early 2000s. It is the poignant social history of a woman and of the evolving society she lived in. Many of her works have been translated into English and published by Seven Stories Press. Ernaux is one of the seven founding authors of the press from which it got its name."

He subsequently joined David Cameron's personnel as communications director, until announcing his departure on 21 January 2011 because of continued media coverage of the phone-hacking affair. Coulson was arrested by the Metropolitan Police Service on 8 July 2011 in connection with allegations of corruption and phone hacking. He was detained and charged with perjury by Strathclyde Police on 30 May 2012 in relation to evidence he had given in the trial of Scottish politician Tommy Sheridan in 2010, and cleared on 3 June 2015. In June 2014 at the Old Bailey, Coulson was found guilty of a charge of conspiracy to intercept voicemails (phone-hacking). He was sentenced on 4 July 2014 to 18 months in prison. On 30 June 2014, it was announced that he would face a retrial over two counts of conspiring to cause misconduct in public office in relation to the alleged purchase of confidential royal phone directories in 2005 from a palace police officer, after the jury in the original trial was unable to reach a verdict on them. On 21 November 2014, Coulson was released from prison having served less than five months of his 18-month prison sentence. Coulson was also tried over charges that he committed perjury in the evidence he gave in HM Advocate v Sheridan and Sheridan in 2010. This trial started on 11 May 2015 because of the general election. On 3 June 2015, he was cleared of these perjury charges, since, if he had lied, it wouldn't have been relevant to the outcome."

  "text" : "Imad Eddin Barakat Yarkas alias Abu Dahdah (Arabic: أبو الدحداح‎‎ 'Abū ad-Daḥdāh) is a Syrian-born Spaniard sentenced to a 27-year prison term in Spain for his part in the September 11, 2001 attacks and for his membership in the banned terrorist organization al-Qaeda. However, on February 16, 2006, the Spanish Supreme Court reduced the Abu Dahdah penalty to 12 years because it considered that his participation in the conspiracy was not proven. He is thought to have been a high-ranking member of al-Qaeda's Madrid component. Some reports said that Yarkas's phone number was found in a Hamburg apartment rented by lead hijacker Mohamed Atta, while others say he was mentioned by name in a diary seized by police in a search of an anonymous apartment, or that his passport had been seized in a raid on the London home of Abu Qatada. He is said to have visited Indonesia and Malaysia in the years prior to the attacks, while he was under watch of Spanish authorities. Dahdah was one of 11 people arrested on November 19, 2001, and charged with fundraising for Al-Qaeda operatives, and his alleged role in convincing youths to attend camps in Afghanistan, camps run by his associates Anwar Adnan Mohamed Salah and Mustafa Setmariam Nasar. He was also said to lead the group Soldiers of Allah, which included Abdulla Khayata, Osama Darra, Jasem Mahboule, Mohamed Needl, Mohamed Zaher, José Luis Galán, Sadik Meriziak, Abdulaziz Benyaich, Najib Chaib, Hassan Al Hussein, and Mohamed Ghaleb Kalaje. His trial began April 22, and Dahdah pleaded not guilty, maintaining his innocence. Although prosecutor Pedro Rubira had sought 74,337 years imprisonment, Dahdah was sentenced to 15 years for conspiracy to commit terrorist murders, and another 12 years for leading a terrorist organization, the sentences to be served consecutively. While serving his third year in prison, Dahdah was accused by intelligence officer Rafael Gomez Menor who reported to the Spanish parliament that the Madrid train bombings in 2004 had been \"Abu Dahdah, without any doubt\". It was alleged that he helped direct the operations during prison visits from Walid al-Masri. Dahdah's sentence was later reduced by the Spanish Supreme Court, which ruled that the conspiracy charges were unproven. After serving 12 years, Dahdah was released from prison in May 2013. During the 1990s he fought in Bosnia."

Agathocles through his father was a distant relation of the Ptolemaic dynasty. Agathocles was an Egyptian Greek nobleman. He was the son born to Oenanthe of Egypt from her first husband Agathocles and also had two unnamed sisters. His paternal grandmother Theoxena of Egypt, was a Syracusan Greek Princess and Theoxena’s mother, also named Theoxena was a Greek Macedonian noblewoman, who was the second older maternal half-sister of the Greek Egyptian Pharaoh Ptolemy II Philadelphus, who reigned 283 BC-246 BC. Polybius states he had other relations who served the Ptolemaic dynasty: Nico or Nicon a nauarch under Ptolemy IV; Philo and Philammon appointed libyarch of Cyrene by himself. Agathocles and his sister were introduced to Ptolemy IV by their ambitious mother. Despite Ptolemy IV marrying his sister Arsinoe III in 220 BC, Agathoclea continued to be his favourite. According to surviving inscriptions in 216/215 BC, Agathocles served as a Priest. On the death of Ptolemy IV in 205 BC, Agathocles and his allies kept the event secret, that they might have an opportunity to plunder the royal treasury. They also formed a conspiracy with Sosibius aimed at placing Agathocles on the throne or at least making him regent for the new boy king, Ptolemy V Epiphanes. With the support of Sosibius, they murdered Arsinoe III. Agathocles then acted as guardian to the young king Ptolemy V Epiphanes. Agathocles seems to have soon killed Sosibius, although the details of this event are unknown. In 203/202 BC, the Egyptians and the Greeks of Alexandria, exasperated at Agathocles' outrages, rose against him, and the military governor Tlepolemus placed himself at their head. They surrounded the palace in the night, and forced their way in. Agathocles and his sister begged for mercy, but in vain. Agathocles was killed by his friends, to avoid an even more cruel fate. Agathoclea with her sisters, and Oenanthe, who had taken refuge in a temple, were dragged out, and in a state of nakedness exposed to the fury of the multitude, who literally tore them limb from limb. All their relations and those who had had any share in the murder of Arsinoe III were likewise put to death. Agathocles died along with his wife and their son."

Messiah was court architect to Léopold II of Belgium, but his most famous work was the Villa Ephrussi, completed in 1912. At this southern French villa, Messiah successfully synthesized the eclectic collections and ideas of Baroness Béatrice Ephrussi de Rothschild into a coherent neoclassical whole. Messiah also built the more grandiose Villa Masséna. Like the Villa Ephrussi, the Villa Masséna was an aristocratic retreat in the south of France, and represented an apotheosis of southern Europe's craft legacy. This villa was built for the prince Victor Masséna, whose family had gained title and wealth under the French emperor Napoléon. Despite its historicism, the villa included an up-to-date porte-cochere, where visitors could enter and leave automobiles without being exposed to the elements. Aaron was the father of the architect Gaston Messiah (1885-1962)."

  "text" : "Alfonso Caso y Andrade (February 1, 1896 in Mexico City – November 30, 1970 in Mexico City) was an archaeologist who made important contributions to pre-Columbian studies in his native Mexico. Caso believed that the systematic study of ancient Mexican civilizations was an important way to understand Mexican cultural roots. His notable discoveries include the excavations at Monte Albán, in particular \"Tomb Seven\", in which several gold pieces and offerings were found (now shown in the Regional Museum of Oaxaca). He also discovered many sites in the Mixteca (a region in the state of Oaxaca), such as Yucuita, Yucuñudahui and Monte Negro. As well as discovering new sites Caso also sought to interpret them, establishing the chronology of Monte Albán history, and deciphering Mixtec codices. Throughout his life Caso wrote books about native Mesoamerican cultures, including those of the Olmec, Mixtec, Zapotec, and Aztec. He was one of the first to recognize the Olmecs as the earliest Mesoamerican civilization, declaring that they were the \"cultura madre\" (Mother culture) of Mesoamerica. His argument has subsequently been debated by Mesoamerican archaeologists; it is currently unclear how the Olmec interacted with other Mesoamerican cultures."

  "text" : "Alan Michael Canfora (born August 21, 1949) was a student at Kent State University, Ohio when he was shot and wounded in the right wrist by Ohio National Guardsmen in the Kent State shootings on May 4, 1970, while protesting the invasion of Cambodia. It is estimated that Canfora was 225 feet away from the Guardsman who shot him with a military issue M1 Garand. Canfora suffered a gunshot wound with entry and exit wounds. Four students (Allison Krause, William Schroeder, Sandra Scheuer and Jeffrey Miller) were killed in the shootings, which led to protests on college campuses throughout the United States, causing hundreds of campuses to close because of both violent and non-violent demonstrations. The Kent State campus remained closed for six weeks. Just five days after the shootings, 100,000 people demonstrated in Washington, D.C. against the war. Ten days after the shootings, two more people were shot and killed on the campus of Jackson State University in Mississippi. The police were brought onto the Jackson State campus because authorities feared that protests over the Kent State shootings could turn into riots. Canfora was one of nine students injured in the shootings at Kent State that day. The others were Dean Kahler, Scott Mackenzie, Robbie Stamps, Doug Wrentmore, John Cleary, Joe Lewis, Jim Russell and Tom Grace. Their injuries ranged from minor flesh wounds to a spinal cord injury resulting in permanent paralysis. Of those wounded, Canfora has been the most outspoken about the United States government's role in the Kent State shootings, and in what he calls the cover-up of the incident in the decades since. He has been involved in public speaking and maintains a website on which he has published excerpts of his forthcoming book on the events at Kent State from 1967 to 1970. Alan Canfora currently resides in his hometown, Barberton, Ohio, where he is an election official. He is still active in politics and is the chair of the Barberton Democratic Party, a post he has held since 1992. Alan Canfora is also the Director of the Kent May 4 Center—a non-profit, tax-exempt, educational charity—since 1989."

  "text" : "Allan Bernard Temko (February 4, 1924 – January 25, 2006) was a Pulitzer Prize-winning architectural critic and writer based in San Francisco. Born in New York City and raised in Weehawken, New Jersey, Temko served as a U.S. Navy officer in World War II, graduated from Columbia University in 1947, and continued his graduate studies at the University of California, Berkeley, and at the Sorbonne in Paris, France. He taught for several years in France and produced a landmark book about the Cathedral of Notre Dame, Notre Dame of Paris, in 1955. He wrote architectural criticism for the San Francisco Chronicle from 1961 to 1993. He also taught city planning and the social sciences at the University of California, Berkeley and California State University, Hayward (now California State University, East Bay). Following Finnish-born architect Eero Saarinen's death in 1961, Temko published Eero Saarinen (1962), a critical examination of Saarinen's most famous works from the General Motors Technical Center to the Jefferson National Expansion Memorial and its Gateway Arch (still in the planning stages at the time), as a volume in George Braziller's Makers of Contemporary Architecture series. Temko was an activist critic who defended the urban character and texture of San Francisco from, in his words, \"a variety of villains: real estate sharks, the construction industry and its unions, venal politicians, bureaucrats, brutal highway engineers, the automobile lobby, and -- in some ways worst of all -- incompetent architects and invertebrate planners who were wrecking the Bay Area before our eyes.\" One of these villains, an architect named Sandy Walker, famously sued Temko over his 1978 description of Walker's Pier 39 project which began, \"Corn. Kitsch. Schlock. Honky-tonk. Dreck. Schmaltz. Merde.\" Temko was instrumental in the removal of the Embarcadero Freeway and memorably described the 1971 Vaillancourt Fountain on the Embarcadero as a thing \"deposited by a concrete dog with square intestines.\" He described the City Center Building in Hayward in the early 1970s, calling it a \"toaster\", due to its slightly elongated rectangular shape, which strongly influenced public opinion of the building. Temko, who met Jack Kerouac when they were both undergraduates at Columbia, appears in Kerouac's novel On the Road as the model for the character \"Roland Major\". Temko also appeared in Kerouac's Book of Dreams as Irving Minko and in Visions of Cody as Allen Minko. He called for an international design competition for the eastern span replacement of the San Francisco–Oakland Bay Bridge, saying that both the single-tower cable-stayed scheme (favored by T.Y. Lin) and the single-masted self-anchored suspension design ultimately chosen were incapable of being \"a world-famous work of engineering art.\" Temko was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for Criticism in 1990. He died of apparent congestive heart failure at the Orinda Convalescent Hospital in Orinda, California, in 2006."

Igbon later starred as Loggo in Boys from the Blackstuff, a BBC television drama about a group of unemployed men in Liverpool during the recession-ravaged early 1980s, written by Alan Bleasdale. He also took a leading role in the sitcom The Front Line, playing the dreadlocked Sheldon, alongside Paul Barber as his police officer brother Malcolm, and had a role in the film Water (1985). Other staple programmes in which Igbon featured include cop show The Professionals, Bleasdale drama G.B.H., medical serial Doctors and Channel 4 soap opera Brookside. He had a supporting role in the third series of Auf Wiedersehen, Pet as a bodyguard and stooge to the programme's main villain (played by Boys from the Blackstuff co-star Michael Angelis) and then took a temporary role in ITV soap Coronation Street, playing Tony Stewart the estranged father of regular character Jason Grimshaw. The character returned in 2014, but was played by actor Terence Maynard until November 2015. It was announced on 14 March 2016 that Tony would be killed-off."

  "text" : "Aisea Taoka (born 1946) is a former Fijian civil servant and police officer, who served as the Commissioner of Prisons from 1996 to 2006, when he was dismissed by the military administration that seized power on 5 December that year. He had previously served for 31 years in the Police force. Taoka hails from Ketei on the island of Totoya, in the Lau archipelago. Under the pretext of taking him to see an eye surgeon in Suva, his father Rupeni Raga smuggled him out of his village in January 1953, in order to educate him. (At that time, it was permitted to leave the village only for medical reasons). Living with relatives in Bagasau, he was educated at Suva Methodist Boys School and subsequently at Lelean Memorial School, graduating in 1964. During this time, his immediate family moved to Suva. On leaving high school, Taoka enlisted in the police training school. Home Affairs Minister Paul Manueli appointed him to lead a Commission of Inquiry into an outbreak at Naboro prison in 1994. Two years later, he was appointed Prisons' Commissioner. Taoka was a strong proponent of law and order and was unsympathetic to criticisms of prison conditions. In his submission on 14 February 2006 to the parliamentary committee studying the proposed Prisons and Corrections Bill, Taoka said that those in prison had never considered their victims' rights, so it was out of order for them to complain of their imprisonment conditions being a violation of their own rights. \"These are the people who trample on the rights of law-abiding citizens; their right to privacy, their right to ownership of property, their right to life ... these are the people who are charged with killing, and you want to read the human rights hand book to me,\" the Fiji Times quoted him as saying. The condition of prisons was what the government could afford, he said. His comments drew a sharp response from Shaista Shameem, Director of the Fiji Human Rights Commission, who was quoted in the Times on 16 February that prisoners were human beings who had the right to live with dignity. Taoka took a different position on the question of compulsory AIDS/HIV tests for prison inmates, however, saying that it would be an affront to their dignity. Patient confidentiality was as applicable in prison as anywhere else, the Fiji Times quoted him as saying on 20 February 2006. Taoka is married to Margaret and has children."

  "text" : "Anani ben Sason (also called 'Anani, 'Inani, and 'Inyani) was a Jewish Talmudist who lived in the Land of Israel, known as an amora of the third century, a contemporary of R. Ammi. He rarely discussed Halakot, and his discussions of them were not original (Shab. 64b). Once he recited a Halakah in the patriarch's mansion, without naming its author, which provoked R. Ammi to ask: \"Is it his own? It is what R. Eleazar had reported in the name of R. Oshaiah\" (M. Ḳ. 24b). In the Haggadah, he sometimes reported the sayings of others, but more often he was original. Thus, as a reason for the juxtaposition of the regulations regarding the sacrificial rites and the priestly vestments (Ex. xxviii-xxix), he points out that the priestly vestments were to have atoning effects as well as the sacrifices. He represents the miter as atoning for haughtiness, and cites R. Chanina as saying, \"That which rests highest on the priest atones for one's considering himself high\"; and similarly with the rest of the priestly garments (Zeb. 88b;  'Ar. 16a; compare Yer. Yoma, vii. 44b; Lev. R. x.). Referring to God's appearance in the thorn-bush (Ex. iii. 2-4) he remarks, \"The Holy One—blessed be He!—said to Moses, 'When I will it, one of my angels stretcheth forth his hand from heaven and reacheth to the ground,' as the Scripture says [Ezek. viii. 3], 'He put forth the form of a hand, and took me by a lock of mine head'; and when it so pleaseth me, I make three angels sit under one tree [Gen. xviii. 4]; when I choose, my glory fills the universe, as it is written [Jer. xxiii. 24], 'Do I not fill heaven and earth? saith the Lord'; 'and when I so willed, I spoke to Job in a whirlwind, as it is said [Job, xxxviii. 1, xl. 6], \"The Lord answered Job out of the whirlwind\"\" (Ex. R. iii., where the interpretation is somewhat forced). The same idea, though in different form, is found elsewhere (Gen. R. iv., Pesiḳ. R. i. 47) in the name of R. Chanina b. Issi (Sissi); and as the name of the subject of this article is sometimes written 'Inani and also 'Inyani (compare Diḳduḳe Soferim to Shab. 64b, M. Ḳ. 24b, Zeb. 88b)—which forms are dialectic variations of Chanina, though with the initial aleph instead of ayin—the circumstance probably suggested the identity of the two names (compare Bacher, Ag. Pal. Amor. iii. 547, 4-5). But this identification meets with insuperable chronological difficulties, Chanina b. Sissi being a contemporary of Johanan (Yer. Sanh. ii. 20c), while 'Anani was younger even than Johanan's pupils. Isaac Reichlin (Ha-Kerem, 1887, p. 214b) aptly suggests that 'Anani's real name was 'Ananiel, as it is still preserved in Ex. R. iii. 7, and that its apocopated form was adopted to avoid the mention of the name \"El\" (God) in common speech."

The first songs were written in 1969. From 1970 he started to participate in the Moscow KSP (Klub Samodejatel'noj Pesni, Clubs of Amateur Song) activities. Mirzayan became laureate of numerous KSP festivals at that time. In 1970-1980, Mirzayan's active civil stand and his affinity to the underground culture (poetry of Daniil Kharms, Joseph Brodsky etc.) caused conflicts with official rule. Mirzayan writes songs both for his own poetry as well as poetry of other Russian poets - V. Sosnora, J. Brodsky, D. Harms, M. Tsvetaeva, O. Chuhonzev and others. From the end of 1990, Mirzayan started research on the historical and philosophical aspects of the song phenomena."

  "text" : "Austin Stoker (born October 7, 1943) is a Trinidadian-American actor known for his role as Lt. Ethan Bishop, the police officer in charge of the besieged Precinct 9, Division 13, in John Carpenter's Howard Hawks-inspired, 1976 film, Assault on Precinct 13. This was one of the few heroic starring roles for an African-American actor in an action film of the 1970s outside of the blaxploitation genre. Stoker was born in Port of Spain, Trinidad and Tobago. Prior to his role as Lt. Bishop, Stoker appeared in several blaxploitation films, often playing police detectives. Among these films were Abby (1974), Combat Cops (1974), and Sheba, Baby (1975), in which he played Pam Grier's love interest. Some of Stoker's other notable acting roles were in Battle for the Planet of the Apes (1973), Horror High (1974), Airport 1975 (1974), Victory at Entebbe (1976), and the 1977 television mini-series Roots. Stoker is known to Mystery Science Theater 3000 fans for his role as Dr. Ken Melrose in the 1982 B-movie, Time Walker, in which he appeared with Darwin Joston, his co-star from Assault on Precinct 13."

  "text" : "Aaron Webster (June 1959 - November 17, 2001) was a gay man living in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, who was beaten by a group of men close to a gay cruising area in a woody part of Stanley Park near Second Beach on November 17, 2001. According to reports, the youths came across a nearly naked Webster and chased him to a parking area, where they beat him with baseball bats. After the beating, Webster was found beside a path in the park by his close friend Tim Chisholm, and died within minutes in Chisholm's arms. Although some media called Webster's killing the first gay-related murder in Canadian history, much like the Matthew Shepard incident in the United States it was merely the first to attract widespread media attention. The coroner's report listed the cause of Webster's death as \"a blow to the left side or back of the victim's neck. This blow caused a tear to the vertebral artery which resulted in a massive and rapidly fatal hemorrhage at the base of the brain.\" A march and vigil was organized by Little Sisters Bookstore co-owner Jim Deva, and took place the day after the killing, with hundreds of people marching through the streets of downtown Vancouver toward the site of Webster's death. Another rally, including British Columbia Human Rights Commissioner Mary-Woo Sims, was held several weeks later. Vigils were also held in several other Canadian cities. The killing was widely covered in the national news in Canada, and led to significant controversy around whether the attack constituted a hate crime. The incident also received some coverage in the mainstream media in the United States, although gay media reported it far more prominently."

Between 1980 and 1988, Bowness was Director of the Tate Gallery, realising the long-desired expansion of the site at Millbank with the creation of the Clore Wing dedicated to the work of J.M.W. Turner. Bowness was also responsible for the creation of the outpost Tate Liverpool, both projects being achieved through gifts from charitable trusts. At a time when the public grant to the Tate had been capped, Bowness established two supporters groups to fund the purchase of new work and set up the Turner Prize to promote contemporary British artists. His acquisitions for the Tate collection included Surrealist and American artworks. He also set Tate St Ives in motion by fostering links with the Cornish town of St Ives, a location favoured by many artists, where he had set up the Barbara Hepworth Museum in 1976. As a curator Bowness' main area of interest was British modern art — he has close personal links with both the Henry Moore and Barbara Hepworth families (he is married to Ben Nicholson and Barbara Hepworth's daughter Sarah) — and during his directorship the Tate's temporary programme concentrated on artists from this area. After retiring from the Tate, Bowness was director of the Henry Moore Foundation and set up the Henry Moore Institute in Leeds, Yorkshire. He was knighted in the 1988 New Year Honours. He is also an Honorary Fellow of Downing College, Cambridge."

  "text" : "Count Alexander Nikolayevich Samoylov (Russian: Александр Николаевич Самойлов) (1744 – 1 November 1814) was a Russian general and statesman. Alexander Samoylov was born into the family of senator Nikolay Samoylov. He started his military service in 1760 as a soldier of Leib-Guard Semyonovsky Regiment. Later he was moved to the front-line forces and took part in the Russo-Turkish War, 1768–1774 and, for his part in the taking of Silistra, received the Order of St. George of 4th degree. The rise to power of his relative, Prince Potemkin, led to a comital title being bestowed upon Samoilov in 1775. After that, he obtained quick promotion: in 1775 he was appointed a member of commission for the trial of Yemelyan Pugachev. Also he was promoted to kamer-yunker (cadet) and became the chairman of the Council, which existed in the reign of Catherine II in 1776–1787. In 1783 he commanded the Crimean Chasseur Corps and was prominent in the campaign that led to the Russian annexation of the Crimean Khanate. During the Russo-Turkish War, 1787–1792 he fought as General-Poruchik, commanding five infantry regiments, two corps of chasseurs, seven Cossack regiments and forty cannons. In 1788 he distinguished himself in the taking of Ochakov and was awarded the Order of St. George of 2nd degree. In 1789 he took part in the taking of Bendery and Kaushan, serving under his relative, Prince Potemkin. For this campaign he received the Order of Alexander Nevsky. On 12 December 1790, he commanded the left wing of the army of Alexander Suvorov in the storm of Izmail, winning the Order of St. Vladimir of 1st degree. For his efforts in bringing about the peace treaty with the Ottoman Empire, Catherine II personally decorated him with the Order of St. Andrew. On 17 September 1792, he was appointed General-Prosecutor of the Senate instead of seriously ill Prince Alexander Vyazemsky. Upon his accession to the throne, Emperor Paul I dismissed Samoylov. Alexander Samoilov married Princess Troubetzkoy and had one son, Nicholas, who did not leave issue from his marriage to the last Countess Skavronsky, Yulia. General Raevsky was his nephew."

His family, originally from Harran in Mesopotamia, emigrated with him to Ifriqiya. Asad studied in Medina with Malik ibn Anas, the founder of the Malikite school, and in Kufa with a disciple of Abu Hanifa, the founder of the Hanafite tradition. He collected his views on religious law in the Asadiyya, which had great influence in Ifriqiya. After his return to Ifriqiya he became a judge in Kairouan, where he soon came into conflict with the Aghlabid Emir Ziyadat Allah I (817-838) after criticising his luxurious and impious lifestyle. In order to get rid of this unwelcome critic, Ziyadat appointed Asad the leader of an expedition to Byzantine Sicily. In 827 Asad landed with a force of Arabs in Sicily and following a defeat of Byzantine troops proceeded to besiege Syracuse. However, the city could not be taken and Asad soon died of plague. Asad was prominent in establishing the Malikite Madh'hab in Ifriqiya."

  "text" : "Andrey Sergeyevich Sychyov (Russian: Андре́й Серге́евич Сычёв, also transliterated Sychev or Sychov, born November 24, 1986 in Krasnoturyinsk, Sverdlovsk Oblast) is a former Russian soldier who served in an armored forces academy in Chelyabinsk, Russia. He was tortured by at least four fellow soldiers and a sergeant on December 31, 2005. This case caused public opinion in Russia and especially NGOs like the Union of the Committees of Soldiers' Mothers of Russia (CSMR) to blame the current administration, in particular Defense Minister Sergey Ivanov, for tolerating the practice of dedovshchina, an organized system of hazing, inside the military ranks. On December 31, 2005, Sychyov and another seven soldiers were beaten for three hours by their seniors. Sychyov, then aged 19, was forced to squat for four hours with his hands tied behind his back while a sergeant beat him. On January 4, Sychyov attempted to receive medical attention, but his request was rejected by higher-rank officers. Only a few days later, due to the worsening of his health, he was transferred to the city hospital, where he was diagnosed with numerous broken bones, trauma to the genital area and gangrene of the legs. There are allegations that the military attempted to keep the case from the media and ordered the doctors to keep silent; however, one of the doctors treating Sychyov contacted Lyudmila Zinchenko, the president of the Committee of Soldier's Mothers, which, in turn, contacted Sychyov's mother, Galina Pavlovna Sychyova. Sychyov's mother's last contact with her son was on January 3, when she called to congratulate him on the New Year. On the phone, he told her that he was not doing well and was about to be taken to a hospital. Once she received the news of the transfer, she attempted to contact her son at the hospital but was told that, due to the holidays, nobody would attend to her son until January 10. On January 7, however, she was contacted by a surgeon who told her to come quickly, as her son might not survive until the next day. As a result of gangrene in the legs, which is a reduced blood flow, and lack of timely medical attention, doctors had to amputate both his legs, genitalia, and a finger. Junior Sergeant Alexander Sivyakov, also a conscript, was found guilty of the torture and was sentenced to four years in prison, along with an additional three-year ban from the army and loss of military rank. Pavel Kuzmenko and Gennady Bilimovich were also found guilty and sentenced to one year's probationary sentence. When questioned, the Defense Minister disregarded these claims at first, but was forced to take action shortly thereafter. Allegations appeared in the media during the trial, claiming that an FSB agent unsuccessfully tried to bribe the mother of Andrey Sychyov to drop the case in return for monetary assistance. In September 2007 it was reported that Andrey Sychyov tried to be included in the party election list of the Union of Rightist Forces (SPS), for the State Duma elections."

One biographical portrait  begins \"Among the titans of science, Arthur Pardee is especially intriguing.\" There is hardly a field of molecular biology that is not affected by his work, which has advanced our understanding through theoretical predictions followed by insightful experiments. He is perhaps most famous for his part in the 'PaJaMo experiment' of the late 1950s, which greatly helped in the discovery of messenger RNA. He is also well known as the discoverer of the restriction point, in which a cell commits itself to certain cell cycle events during the G1 cycle. He has done a great deal of work on tumor growth and regulation, with a particular focus on the role of estrogen in hormone-responsive tumors. And he is also well known for the development of various biochemical research techniques, most notably the differential display methodology, which is used in examining the activation of genes in cells. More recently he has championed the acceptance and adoption of the conceptual review as a valuable approach to unearthing new knowledge from the enormous stores of information in the scientific literature."

In 1932, she met composer Harold Arlen in New York City during the Broadway theatre production of Earl Carroll's Vanities. They eventually married on January 6, 1937 over the objection of both of their parents, because she was Gentile and he Jewish, but it turned out to be a lifelong love affair of inseparable devotion. In 1934 she appeared in her first of nine film roles in an uncredited part of an \"Earl Carroll girl\" in Murder at the Vanities, based on Carroll's Broadway play. In 1951 she was institutionalized in a sanatorium for seven years after repeatedly threatening her husband and others with physical harm. Anya Taranda-Arlen died from a brain tumor in 1970. She is interred next to her husband in the Ferncliff Cemetery in Hartsdale, New York."

  "text" : "Alexander Nikolayevich Saburov (Russian: Алекса́ндр Никола́евич Сабу́ров; (1 August 1908 - 15 April 1974), one of the leaders of Soviet partisan movement in Ukraine and western Russia during the German-Soviet War. Born in a peasant family of Russian ethnicity in Yarushki, Vyatka Governorate (now part of Izhevsk, Udmurtia), Saburov joined the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in 1932 and the NKVD in 1938. A few months after the German invasion of USSR in the autumn of 1941, Saburov organized first guerrilla units in Bryansk, Oryol and Sumy regions occupied by the enemy. His partisan unit numbered around 1800 men and during the winter of 1941-42 effectively harassed German troops operating behind the enemy lines. On 18 May 1942 Saburov was awarded the title Hero of the Soviet Union as well as Order of Lenin for personal heroism and his contribution to the Soviet war effort. At the end of 1942 Saburov moved his partisan unit into Ukraine and operated in central and western Ukraine. Together with Sydir Kovpak he played a key role in the leadership of partisan movement in Ukraine. In 1944 Saburov was promoted to the rank of major general. After the war he held high-ranking NKVD positions in Ukraine and in 1954 became one of the heads of the Soviet MVD. He was a member of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR between 1948 and 1958. Saburov was awarded Order of the Red Banner, Order of Suvorov, Order of Bogdan Khmelnitsky, Order of the Patriotic War and Order of the Red Star. Alexander Saburov died on 15 April 1974 and is buried at Novodevichy Cemetery in Moscow."

The comic book version of Andrea Vecchiato is an alchemist, and makes his first appearance alongside the Fantastic Four in issues 39–41 of the series Ultimate Fantastic Four, where he entraps the evil alchemist Diablo. Amidst the collectors of his fine art photography are James Birch, Lucien Pellat-Finet, the Groucho Club, Tom Parker-Bowles and Chas Smash. In 2010 the Groucho Club in London has named a tequila based cocktail, the Vecchiato, after him."

  "text" : "Born in St. Louis, the son of Italian immigrants to the United States, Amerigo Dumini traveled to the family's ancestral region, Florence, at the end of the First World War and became active in the local fascio organized by partisans of Benito Mussolini, taking pride in being referred to as \"sicario del Duce\" (\"Il Duce's hitman\"). He participated in the Sarzana incident on 21 July 1921, leading a column of 600 \"squadristi\" (Blackshirts) to Sarzana with demands for the liberation of Renato Ricci. Ricci and other fascists had been arrested following armed confrontation with the Arditi del Popolo, an antifascist organization created in 1921 by the anarchist Argo Secondari as an offshoot of the \"Arditi\" movement. In 1924 Dumini entered the ranks of Ceka, the secret police which Mussolini based on the Soviet Cheka. Shortly thereafter, on June 24, he headed the group that carried out the killing of Giacomo Matteotti, possibly on the orders of Cesare Rossi, to whom he was assistant at the time. Following the political murder, he was abandoned by the Fascist leadership, with the exception of Roberto Farinacci, who defended him during his trial. While Farinacci declared himself \"honored\" by the task, he could not prevent Dumini from receiving a five-year prison sentence, of which he only served eleven months, benefitting from an amnesty ordered by Mussolini. Once out of jail, he tried his hand at blackmailing the fascist leadership, trying to obtain rewards and the payment of his legal fees. Ostentatiously, he sought a meeting with Mussolini at the Italian Council of Ministers. He justified his entitlement with the words \"I am here in order to wash Matteotti's blood off my hands\". Arrested, he was put on trial for \"offending Il Duce\" and sentenced to eight years in prison—substantially more than for the previous crime. Freed in 1927, Amerigo Dumini left for Italian Somaliland, having been awarded a large state pension (5,000 lire). Apparently, he was still viewed as troublesome, since he was detained and interned on the Tremiti Islands. Meanwhile, he warned General Emilio De Bono that he had filed a manuscript detailing Matteotti's murder with notaries in Texas. This claim led to his release and an increase in pension to as much as 50,000 lire. He left for the Italian colony of Libya, where his pension was further increased by 2,500 lire (together with a single payment of 125,000 lire). He remained in the region for more than a decade and was captured by the British Army at Derna during the North African Campaign of World War II. Sentenced to death as a spy, he was hit by 17 bullets from a firing squad and still managed to remain alive, escaping to safety in Tunisia during the night. As Dumini returned to Italy, he was received with astonishment and offered yet another generous pension. He went into business as a transporter and bought a villa in a residential area of Florence. With the 1943 fall of Fascism in southern in Italy, he joined the German-backed Italian Social Republic. After the Allied occupation of that region, Dumini was arrested in Bologna and placed on trial for Matteotti's murder. He was given a life sentence, but spent no more than eight years in prison and, following more than a decade in quiet retirement, died at the age of 73 at Rome as the result of a domestic accident."

  "text" : "Arthur Vaughan Johnson (February 2, 1876 – January 17, 1916) was a pioneer actor and director of the early American silent film era. Born in Cincinnati, Ohio, the son of Rev. Myron A. Johnson, Arthur Vaughan Johnson left college at 19 to join a traveling Shakespearean troupe. He later appeared on stage with Sol Smith Russell, Robert B. Mantell and Marie Wainwright. Johnson began as a film actor in 1905 with the Edison Studios in The Bronx, New York, appearing in the one-reel drama The White Caps directed by Wallace McCutcheon, Sr., and Edwin S. Porter. In 1908, he went to work for Biograph Studios, where he acted in films directed by D.W. Griffith including Resurrection (1909) and In Old California (1910), the first movie Griffith ever shot in Hollywood. At Biograph, Arthur Johnson performed with stars such as Mary Pickford and Florence Lawrence. Johnson was reputed to be Griffith's favorite actor. In 1911 he accepted an offer from Lubin Studios in Philadelphia that allowed him to direct as well as act. With Lottie Briscoe, his frequent co-star at Lubin, Johnson directed and starred in The Belovéd Adventurer (1914), a 15 episode serial by Emmett Campbell Hall. After performing in more than three hundred silent film shorts and directing twenty-six, health problems ended his career in 1915. According to an interview published nine months before his death, Arthur V. Johnson married actress Maude Webb when he was 20 years old; the couple had a daughter who lived with Johnson's parents. Other sources indicate that around 1910 he married Florence Hackett, with whom he appeared in the 1913 film Power of the Cross. He died of tuberculosis in Philadelphia in 1916, a few weeks short of his fortieth birthday. Johnson's funeral services were held in Philadelphia and his remains later interred at Fairview Cemetery, Chicopee, Massachusetts. Nearby stands Grace Episcopal Church, where his father once served as rector."

  "text" : "Andrea Lo Cicero Vaina (Italian pronunciation: [anˈdrɛa lo ˈtʃitʃero]; born Catania, 7 May 1976) is an Italian rugby union footballer. Born in Catania, Sicily, Lo Cicero began his professional career in the town of his birth with Amatori Catania. Later he moved to Bologna and then to Rugby Rovigo, winning his first Italian Championship in 2000 with Rugby Roma. Subsequently he played for a season in the French team Stade Toulousain. He then played for L'Aquila and he currently plays for Racing Métro, now in France's Top 14. Lo Cicero was included in Italy's squad for the 1999 Rugby World Cup but did not see any action and had to wait until the following year to make his international debut. It came against England in 2000 when he had the difficult task of filling the gap left by the Azzurri prop and captain Massimo Cuttitta. He was named in the BBC's dream XV at the 2004 Six Nations Championship and was part of the Barbarians squad to take on New Zealand later that year. Lo Cicero was the only European player to receive a call, and he capped the feat by scoring a try. In 2005 he again represented the Barbarians for their matches against Scotland and England. In the 2007 Six Nations Championship, he celebrated his 50th appearance in the Six Nations with a thumping 37–17 victory over Scotland at Murrayfield, Italy's first away victory in the tournament. Lo Cicero won his 100th cap for Italy against Scotland in the 2013 Six Nations tournament and his 101st in the match against Wales, equalling Alessandro Troncon's record as Italy's most-capped player, breaking that record against England. Lo Cicero announced he was retiring from the Italian national team after their final game of the 2013 Six Nations against Ireland, and came on to massive cheers from Italian fans. Italy went on to win the game 22-15, thus recording their first Six Nations victory over Ireland. He was also selected for the 2013 Barbarians squad to play in Hong Kong against the British and Irish Lions and England."

He joined Viadana in 2003 and was also included in Italy's squad for the World Cup in Australia that year. He had his 2005 season disrupted by injury.In the 2008 Six Nations Championship, new coach Nick Mallett played Masi at fly-half, a role he had not played before but many experts believed this move was unsuccessful and he was moved to full-back for the start of the 2009 Six Nations Championship. In March 2011, Masi was named the 2011 Six Nations Player of the Championship. Masi scored Italy's late try in their first ever Championship win against France. In June 2011 he joined the Pro12 Italian franchise Aironi then, when the team was discontinued in 2012, he eventually joined Wasps."

  "text" : "Andrey Boreyko (Russian: Андре́й Ви́кторович Боре́йко, Andrey Viktorovich Boreyko, born July 22, 1957 in Saint Petersburg) is a Russian conductor. At the Rimsky-Korsakov Conservatory in Saint Petersburg, he studied conducting (with Elisabeta Kudriavtseva and Alexander Dmitriev), graduating summa cum laude. In 1987, he won diplomas and prizes at the Grzegorz Fitelberg conductors' competition in Katowice, and he was a prize winner in 1989 at the Kirill Kondrashin conductors' competition in Amsterdam. Boreyko was music director of the Jena Philharmonic between 1998 and 2003. With the orchestra, Boreyko received awards for the most innovative concert programming in three consecutive seasons from the German Music Critics (Deutscher Musikverleger-Verband). He now has the title of honorary conductor with the Jena Philharmonic. Boreyko served as Principal Conductor of the Hamburg Symphony Orchestra (Hamburger Symphoniker) from 2004 until his sudden resignation in November 2007. He was principal conductor of the Bern Symphony Orchestra from 2004 to 2010. In May 2008, Boreyko was announced as the next General Music Director of the Düsseldorf Symphony Orchestra, effective with the 2009–2010 season, for an initial contract of 5 years. In February 2012, the orchestra announced the scheduled conclusion of Boreyko's Düsseldorf at the end of the 2013-2014 season. In Canada, Boreyko was principal guest conductor of the Vancouver Symphony Orchestra from 2000 to 2003. He was Music Director of the Winnipeg Symphony Orchestra from 2001 to 2006. Overall, Boreyko received praise for his musicianship during his Winnipeg tenure, and contributed financial assistance to the orchestra during the financially troubled 2002–2003 season. However, he also received criticism for a lack of community outreach, and not fulfilling an intention to establish residency in Winnipeg. In September 2010, the National Orchestra of Belgium (NOB) announced the appointment of Boreyko as its next music director, effective with the 2012-2013 season, with an initial contract of 5 years.

  "text" : "Ahmed Koulamallah (11 February 1912 – 5 September 1995) was a prominent politician in Colonial Chad. He was the estranged son of the sultan of Baguirmi and the charismatic leader of the Tijaniyyah Islamic brotherhood in Chad. He entered in politics founding in 1950 the Independent Socialist Party of Chad (Parti socialiste indepéndent du Tchad or PSIT), connected to the French Section of the Workers' International (SFIO), reconstructed as Chadian section of the African Socialist Movement (Mouvement Socialiste Africain or MSA). Koulamallah campaigned in different times and places as a member of the Baguirmi nobility, a radical socialist leader, or a militant Muslim fundamentalist. He picked most of his adherents from the Chari-Baguirmi and Kanem prefectures. In regards to the main political partes, the conservative Chadian Democratic Union (UDT) and Chadian Social Action (AST) and the progressive Chadian Progressive Party (PPT), Koulamallah played a generally disruptive role in the middle. Defeated in the 1957 elections for the Territorial Assembly, he remained in the opposition until he allied himself in 1959 with Gontchomé Sahoulba forming the Chadian Popular Movement (Mouvement Populaire Tchadien or MPT), which following a motion of no confidence presented on 11 February 1959, was instrumental in causing the downfall of Gabriel Lisette and the PPT government. Sahoulba succeeded Lisette as President of the Provisional Government, forming a government of which he was the only southern Chadian. This exclusion of the south generated high resentment, and brought Koulamallah to ally himself with Lisette against Sahoulba; as a result, a new motion of no confidence was approved with 35 votes against 30, and a new government was formed by Koulamallah on 13 March 1959. The first day he brought all the ministers, Muslims or non-Muslims, to the mosque to pray thanks; and established Arabic would be the working language of the government. Also for this his government survived only eleven days, as yet another motion of no confidence overthrowed the government with 42 votes out of 52. Following this he was again relegated to the opposition, while the PPT, now led by François Tombalbaye, who became the first president of indipent Chad on 11 August 1960. In January 1962 all political parties were banned, except the PPT; and in September 1963 all the opposition leader were arrested. Koulamallah escaped with the help of his Baguirmian relatives, crossing the Chari River and passing in Cameroon. But only a few days later he was arrested by the Cameroonian authorities, and extradited to Chad where he was immediately jailed. He remained in prison till 1971, and again from 1972 till 1975, when Tombalbaye was overthrown by a coup. He died in 1995."

Together with his wife Pamela, he owns and runs a domain in Bouzeron named A & P de Villaine. This domaine has extensive plantations of Aligoté and the de Villaines were part of the campaign to create a separate appellation for the Aligoté wines of Bouzeron, which succeeded in 1998, when Bouzeron AOC was created.

  "text" : "Ahmed Yacoubi (1928–1985) was a Moroccan painter, chef and story-teller. He was born in Fes, Morocco in 1928. A Moroccan art scholar describes Yacoubi as \"the best cultural ambassador Morocco ever had\". Paul Bowles, the American composer and writer, met Ahmed ben Driss el Yacoubi in 1947 in Fez and later in Tangier. Bowles and his wife Jane Bowles encouraged him to draw and paint the characters of his tales after seeing how well Yacoubi illustrated his translations for them. Focused on recording different cultures' music for record labels in various countries, Paul Bowles invited Ahmed to continue to translate for him in Spain, Italy, Turkey, India, Malaysia, Hong Kong and Japan and then transcribed Yacoubi's own stories from Maghrebi (Moroccan Arabic) into English: \"The Man and The Woman\" (1956), \"The Man Who Dreamed of Fish Eating Fish\" (1956) and \"The Game\" (1961), and a play \"The Night Before Thinking\" which was published in the Evergreen Review in 1961 and later produced at The White Barn Theater in Westport, Connecticut. The Bowles arranged for Yacoubi's first exhibition of drawings at the Gallimard Agency bookshop on the Boulevard Pasteur in Tangier. His art was highly acclaimed and 28 works were sold. Further exhibitions were held at the Galerie Clan in Madrid, the Betty Parsons Gallery in New York in 1952, and then throughout the world. A wide range of notable collectors began acquiring his unusual and unselfconscious drawings and paintings, recognizing his level of rare talent and integrity. In 1952 Paul Bowles invited Yacoubi to his island, Taprobane, off the southern coast of Ceylon where Yacoubi prepared memorable meals for their guest Peggy Guggenheim (mentioned in her book Confessions of an Art Addict) and where she purchased several of his drawings. Although Ahmed had begun painting in oil, upon meeting in Tangier, Francis Bacon catalyzed him further by, according to Allen Ginsberg, painting four small canvases blue and telling him to 'Paint'! The two collaborated and painted together, remaining friends for the duration of their lives. Further exhibitions followed in 1957 at the Hanover Gallery in London and worldwide throughout the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s, receiving serious acclaim with his paintings being bought by collectors including the Museum of Modern Art in NYC, La Musee de l'Art Moderne in Paris, and the Museum of Modern Art in São Paulo, Brazil. Yacoubi lived and travelled with an American writer named Ruth Marthen and in 1965 in Tangier had a daughter Karima Yacoubi. Yacoubi continued to exhibit in Tangier, London, New York, Cleveland, Rio de Janeiro, Hong Kong, Paris, and Rome. Ahmed Yacoubi evolved what was originally described as a \"primitive\" style to a highly complex, sophisticated and secret technique of layering in oil glazes that produced canvases of mesmerizing depth and complexity. In 1966 Yacoubi moved to the United States and continued to work prolifically, exhibit and travel, meeting and being host to diverse and international artists, writers, collectors, politicians and connoisseurs. Befriending Peggy Hitchcock and her husband Walter Bowart, owner and publisher of Omen Press, Yacoubi collaborated with friends at their ranch in Tucson and eventually published his first cookbook, \"The Alchemist's Cookbook\". Returning to New York, thanks to the support of Ellen Stewart (La Mama of the Off Off Broadway theatrical world), Yacoubi lived and painted on Great Jones Street in the East Village where he met the artist Carol Cannon in 1976. They lived and painted together for seven years, parting as friends and still collaborating on exhibits and projects such as the screenplay of his play \"The Night Before Thinking\". Three years later, Yacoubi received news of the robbery of his paintings and Moroccan antiques from his studio in Tangier simultaneous to his being diagnosed with lung cancer. He died on December 25, 1985, at the age of 57. His heir, daughter Karima, died suddenly of respiratory problems in London in 2004 at the age of 44."

Beginning in 1822, he served as rector of the Latin school in Biberach, followed by work as a gymnasium professor in Heilbronn (1828). From 1830 until his death in 1845, he was an educator at the gymnasium in Stuttgart. In 1837 began the first edition of the classical encyclopedia \"Realencyclopädie der classischen Altertumswissenschaft\", whose later editions are commonly known as the Pauly–Wissowa. Pauly died prior to publication of the fourth volume of the initial edition. After his death, edition of the encyclopedia was continued by Ernst Christian Walz and Wilhelm Siegmund Teuffel (first edition 1837-1852, six volumes). He also published an edition involving the works of the Greek satirist, Lucian of Samosata, called \"Lucians Werke\" (1827–1832)."

  "text" : "Alice Robie Resnick (Born 1939 in Erie, Pennsylvania) is a former Justice of the Supreme Court of Ohio. In 1988, she was the second woman in Ohio elected and third to serve on the state bench, and was reelected in 1994 and 2000. Her career has included experience as a private attorney, assistant county prosecutor, municipal judge, and as a judge on the Ohio Sixth District Court of Appeals. One of her most controversial opinions was the 4-3 majority ruling that Ohio's school funding system was unconstitutional. In 2000, she was opposed by Terrence O'Donnell, in a massive, though unsuccessful, campaign. On January 31, 2005, she was arrested by the Ohio State Highway Patrol for DUI. Several motorists had used cell phones to call in a Jeep Grand Cherokee showing erratic driving. State police confronted her in a gas station and she refused a field sobriety test, resulting in the one-year automatic suspension of her license. After refusal, she ignored police orders to remain at the gas station and drove off. She was pulled over a few minutes later and failed a sobriety test. Justice Resnick registered a Blood Alcohol Concentration of 0.22, nearly three times the legal limit in the state of Ohio. A dashboard camera recorded the incident, and much of the audio showing Justice Resnick trying to use her office to get out of the DUI charge appeared on the internet. She was convicted of DUI, a first degree misdemeanor, required to take a three-day alcohol education program, and her license was suspended for six months, overriding the automatic suspension of one year. She was not charged with failure to comply with a police officer, resisting arrest, or fleeing from police. A new state law also implemented a mandatory jail sentence for offenders who refuse a sobriety test and show greater than a 0.17 BAC. The incident and penalty sparked a wave of public criticism, especially after portions of the 90-minute videotape surfaced on various internet video websites. On January 17, 2006, Resnick announced that she would not seek a fourth term, thus stepping down from the bench on January 1, 2007. Resnick was selected in 1995 to the Ohio Women's Hall of Fame."

When Parreira left, Mondelo was given the head job with the Metros. He coached the club in the 1998 season with a 14-17-0 record. He was fired with a game left in the regular season, when the MetroStars hired former U.S. national team coach Bora Milutinovic. From 1999 to 2001, Mondelo was an assistant for the U.S. national team, under head coach Bruce Arena. He went back to MLS for the 2001 season to coach the Tampa Bay Mutiny.
