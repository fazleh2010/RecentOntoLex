  "text" : "Boris Pregel (Russian: Борис Юльевич Прегель; 24 January 1893 – 7 December 1976) was a Ukrainian-born Jewish engineer and dealer in uranium and radium. He was born in Odessa, in the Russian Empire, and studied engineering in Belgium at the Universities of Brussels and Liege. He served in the Russian army in World War I, entering as a private soldier and rising to the rank of colonel of engineers. He was put in charge of Russia's only aircraft factory. He moved to Paris after the October Revolution. In Paris he came in contact with Edgar Sengier, a Belgian mining engineer, who was effectively in charge of the mining company, Union Minière, in the Belgian Congo. Pregel became interested in the radium department of this company. From the 1920s to the Second World War Pregel and Sengier controlled the world's supply of radium. He also promoted the building of many radio-therapy installations, including the Queen Sofia Hospital (Sophiahemmet) in Sweden. He ensured that Marie Curie was lent a five-gram radium source which was used in some of her important experiments. In 1937 he married the artist Alexandra Avksentiev, daughter of Nikolai Avksentiev. In 1939 he was awarded the French Legion of Honour in recognition of his role as the head of the International Organisation to Fight Cancer. The couple fled to New York in 1940, after the Nazi invasion of France. After his arrival in the USA he established the Canadian Radium and Uranium Corp of New York and became its president to sell the newly discovered rich ores in northern Canada, and later also in Colorado. George B. Pegram and his associates at Columbia University, who did some of the initial work on the Manhattan Project, sought Pregel's assistance because they did not have sufficient money to buy the uranium. Pregel gave them the first uranium used in the experiments. Pregel's company also built radioactive neutron sources and radioactive luminescent signs. Pregel was also the agent for the Canadian Eldorado Mining & Refining Co. which supplied the Manhattan Project with nearly all the uranium mined in North America. He also sold 0.23 tonnes of uranium oxide to the Soviet Union during the war, with the authorisation of the U.S. Government. In March 1945 the Canadian Foreign Exchange Control Board began formal hearings into Pregel's financial dealings. The case was settled out of court but Pregel and the other defendants paid over $1million in cash and other assets to settle. Furthermore, Pregel agreed to terminate his agency agreement between Eldorado and the Canadian Radium & Uranium Corp. He served as president and board chairman of the New York Academy of Sciences, as presidentof the French University (Ecole Libre) in New York, as trustee of the New School for Social Research and as vice-president of the American Geographical Society. He received several honorary degrees and foreign decorations. Pregel founded the Boris Pregel Awards for science, awarded by the New York Academy of Sciences."

Best known for his personal application of serial technique and for several virtuoso instrumental fantasies on well-known operatic themes, he was also active for a time in the film industry as well as being an energetic and influential teacher. His music includes works in all genres, including songs, chamber music, works for brass and wind band, orchestral music, opera and music theatre as well as film scores. In 1990 he gave up regular teaching to devote more time to composition, and lived in the Wye Valley until his death. He was not related to the composer Robin Orr."

Herself a highly educated woman, Makin was referred to as \"England's most learned lady\", skilled in Greek, Latin, Hebrew, German, Spanish, French and Italian. Makin argued primarily for the equal right of women and girls to obtain an education in an environment or culture that viewed woman as the weaker vessel, subordinated to man and uneducable. She is most famously known for her polemical treatise entitled An Essay To Revive the Antient Education of Gentlewomen, in Religion, Manners, Arts & Tongues, with an Answer to the Objections against this Way of Education (1673)."

After a short time of education in school, he started to work in his father's gallery. He soon found a great interest in furniture and especially chairs—-their function and design. Eventually he developed a special building technique for wooden chairs where the components were bent and glued under the action of hot water. He also designed houses in Sweden, Portugal and in the United States with frameworks of glass and steel."

  "text" : "Boris Slutsky (Russian: Бори́с Абра́мович Слу́цкий; 7 May 1919 in Slovyansk, Ukraine — 23 February 1986 in Tula) was a Soviet poet of the Russian language. During his childhood and youth he lived in Kharkov. In 1937 he entered the Law Institute of Moscow, and also studied at the Maxim Gorky Institute of Literature from 1939 till 1941. He joined a group of young poets including M. Kulchitzki, Pavel Kogan, S. Narovchatov, David Samoilov and others who became acquainted in autumn 1939 at the seminary of Ilya Selvinsky at the State Literary Publishing House, Goslitizdat and called themselves \"the Generation of 1940\". Between 1941-1945 he served in the Red Army as a politruk of an infantry platoon. His war experiences colouring much of his poetry. After ending the war with the rank of major, he worked in radio (1948–1952). In 1956 Ilya Ehrenburg created a sensation with an article quoting a number of hitherto unpublished poems by Slutsky, and in 1957 Slutsky's first book of poetry, Memory, containing many poems written much earlier, was published. Together with David Samoylov, Slutsky was probably the most important representative of the War generation of Russian poets and, because of the nature of his verse, a crucial figure in the post-Stalin literary revival. His poetry is deliberately coarse and jagged, prosaic and conversational. There is a dry, polemic quality about it that reflects perhaps the poet's early training as a lawyer. Slutsky's search was evidently for a language stripped of poeticisms and ornamentation; he represented the opposite tendency to that of such neo-romantic or neo-futuristic poets as Andrey Voznesensky. As early as in 1953 - 1954, prior to the 20th Congress of CPSU, verses condemning the Stalinist regime were attributed to Slutsky. These were circulated in \"Samizdat\" in the 1950s and in 1961 were published in an anthology in the West (in Munich). He did not confirm nor deny their authorship. In his works Slutsky also approached Jewish themes, including material from the Jewish tradition, about antisemitism (including in Soviet society), the Holocaust, etc. He translated to Russian from the Yiddish poetry, e.g., from works of Leib Kvitko, Aron Verghelis, Shmuel Galkin, Asher Shvartsman, and Yakov Sternberg. In 1963, The Poets of Israel was a landmark publication: the editing under his guidance of the first anthology of Israeli poetry. One of his cousins was the Israeli general Meir Amit."

  "text" : "Barbara Rogoff is an educator whose interests lie in understanding and communicating the different learning thrusts between cultures, especially within her book The Cultural Nature of Human Development (2003). Her work bridges psychology with anthropology, drawing on Vygotsky. She holds the University of California Presidential Chair as a professor at the University of California-Santa Cruz. Barbara Rogoff investigates cultural variation in learning processes and settings, with special interest in communities where schooling has not been prevalent. She is particularly interested in cultural aspects of collaboration, learning through observation, children's interest and keen attention to ongoing events, roles of adults as guides or as instructors, and children's opportunities to participate in cultural activities or in age-specific child-focused settings. Her interests include cultural variation in learning processes (especially observation), the organization of people's participation in shared problem solving, children's interest and keen attention to ongoing events, and children's opportunities to participate in cultural activities or in age-specific child-focused settings, with special interest in communities where schooling has not been prevalent. Rogoff's book, Learning Together: Children and Adults in a School Community, co-authored with teachers Carolyn Turkanis and Leslee Bartlett, profiled Salt Lake City's \"Open Classroom,\" a parent-cooperative education program that is now a K-8 charter school. Barbara Rogoff also wrote a chapter in the edited Handbook of Child Psychology. Her chapter was the 14th in the book and entitled Cognition as a Collaborative Process. In it, she discusses Constructivist theorist Piaget and Sociocultural theorist Vygotsky in relation to collaboration, the role of adult experts in the process of learning, peer interaction and community collaborative sociocultural activities. Most recently, Barbara Rogoff wrote Developing Destinies: A Mayan Midwife and Town. This book not only outlines how cultural practices guide ones participation, but how community members choose and change cultural practices."

  "text" : "Bengt Gottfried Forselius (ca 1660, Harju-Madise, Harju County, Swedish Estonia – November 16, 1688, Baltic Sea) was a founder of public education in Estonia, author of the first ABC-book in the Estonian language, and creator of a spelling system which made the teaching and learning of Estonian easier. Forselius and Johan Hornung were mainly responsible for making a start at reforming the Estonian literary language in the late 17th century. Some German constructions were abandoned, and a strict spelling system was adopted which still relied on German orthography. Forselius was a Swede born in Estonia. His father, Pastor Johann Forselius  was originally a Swede from Finland, thus the Swedish family was familiar with Finnic languages. Forselius spoke good Estonian as well as Swedish and German. He received his first education at the Tallinn (Reval) Gymnasium and then graduated with a law degree from the University of Wittenberg in Germany. In 1684, after returning to Estonia, Forselius founded the first teachers’ college, to teach Estonian schoolteachers and parish clerks, in Piiskopimõisa (Bishop’s Manor) near Tartu (Dorpat). The course there lasted for two years, with emphasis on fluent reading, religion instruction, German, arithmetic and bookbinding. Forselius introduced a new method of teaching whereby, instead of remaining passive, during lessons one student read aloud while the others followed. In 1686, an ABC-book devised by him was introduced into use in Estonian schools. Many local Baltic German aristocrats at the time disliked Forselius’ idea of encouraging peasants to aspire to education and complained that pupils of the schools were taken by the Swedish army or that school fees were expensive. Forselius countered this by taking two of his best pupils, Ignati Jaak and Pakri Hansu Jüri (Jüri, son of Hans from Pakri), from the parish of Kambja, to Stockholm, where their abilities impressed King Charles XI of Sweden. By the time of Forselius death in 1688 he had founded 38 schools with 800 pupils in the Estonian areas of Swedish Livonia and 8 schools with 200 students in Swedish Estonia. Forselius drowned during a storm on his return from Stockholm where he had just been appointed inspector of Livonian peasant schools with the power to create as many as he saw fit. Between 1687-1695 by the order of Swedish state schools were to be established in every Estonian parish. By 1898, 97 percent of Estonian population was literate."

  "text" : "Bill Miller (born January 23, 1955) is a Native American singer/songwriter of Mohican heritage. He was born on the Stockbridge-Munsee reservation, near Shawano in northern Wisconsin. Miller's Mohican name is Fush-Ya Heay Aka (meaning \"bird song\"). He began playing guitar when he was 12 years old, and is an accomplished player of the Native American flute. In 1973, he moved to Milwaukee and won an art school scholarship; today he is an accomplished artist whose drawings and paintings have been widely praised. In 1984, he moved to Nashville. His biggest break came when popular musician Tori Amos, after listening to his Red Road CD on her tour bus, asked him to serve as the opening act on her Under the Pink tour. Miller continuously gained fans with other artists from a broad musical spectrum. He went on to tour with diverse musicians such as Pearl Jam's Eddie Vedder, The BoDeans, Richie Havens, and Arlo Guthrie and wrote songs with artists such as Nanci Griffith, Peter Rowan and Kim Carnes. In 2005, Miller's instrumental Cedar Dream Songs won a Grammy Award for Best Native American Music Album. In an interview, Bill said, \"I appreciate people who have something to stand up for. I stand up for the truth. If you stand up for what you believe in you have no idea how many people you'll affect.\" Miller's songs have always been deeply spiritual and have clearly explored his Christian faith in his own indigenous language; Spirit Rain exemplifies this elegant dialog. He crossed genres with his 2000 record, Hear Our Prayer, which was released by Integrity Music as a Christian worship music project. While some songs were co-written by notable songwriters in the genre, he re-recorded some familiar songs such as \"Praises\" from The Red Road and \"Listen to Me\" from Raven in the Snow which, in a new context made clear that he could still be fully Native and fully a Christian. Perhaps the most notable cuts on the album were his cover of Bob Dylan's \"I Believe in You\" and a reinterpretation of the spiritual \"Ain't Gonna Let Nobody Turn Me Around.\" Miller has collaborated with other notable Native American musicians such as Robert Mirabal, Carlos Nakai, and Joanne Shenandoah. His project with Mirabal, Native Suite was an experimental and traditional project, featuring flute and percussion, as well as Mohican pow-wow singing. His vocals appeared on Thomas Kinkade's 2000 album Music of Light which featured Rob Mathes and Australian Christian diva Michelle Tumes; he also was featured on Cherokee singer-songwriter Jason Upton's album Great River Road. In early 2008, Miller worked on a project in La Crosse, Wisconsin for The Pump House, a regional arts center. Miller painted one of many 6-foot-tall (1.8 m) herons that will be auctioned off and placed around the city in honor of fine arts. Also in that city, on April 25-26, 2008 the world premier of his symphony, \"The Last Stand\", was performed by the La Crosse Symphony Orchestra, along with Native American musicians and dancers, with Amy Mills conducting. Co-composed with Joshua Yudkin and Kristin Wilkinson, the symphony grew out of an inspiration Miller had, after visiting the Battle of the Little Bighorn site when he was nine. Called a \"symphony of hope\", it deals with that battle, and the reconciliation Bill Miller, a man dedicated to his Native and Christian roots, feels must occur. Thirty-three photos taken by David Joseph Marcou of the \"Last Stand\" world debut's dress-rehearsal on April 24, 2008, are in the permanent collection of the Smithsonian National Museum of the American Indian. In 2015 Bill's mother died, and on her deathbed she told him what she had kept secret all his life, that he was Jewish. After his mother's death, Bill visited Israel and the Western Wall to rediscover his heritage."

  "text" : "Miyan Bayezid Baz Bahadur Khan was the last sultan of Malwa, who reigned from 1555 to 1562. He succeeded his father, Shuja'at Khan. He is known for his romantic liaison with Roopmati. Baz Bahadur as sultan did not bother to look after his kingdom nor did he maintain a strong army, being devoted to the arts and to his paramour. The Mughals defeated him and captured his queen Roopmati, who killed herself at this turn of events. In 1561, Akbar's army led by Adham Khan and Pir Muhammad Khan attacked Malwa and defeated Baz Bahadur in the battle of Sarangpur on 29 March, 1561. One of the reasons for Adham Khan's attack seems to be his love for Rani Roopmati. Rani Roopmati poisoned herself upon hearing of the fall of Mandu. Baz Bahadur fled to Khandesh. Akbar soon recalled Adham Khan and made over command to Pir Muhammad, who attacked Khandesh and proceeded up to Burhanpur but was soon defeated by a coalition of three powers: Miran Mubarak Shah II of Khandesh, Tufal Khan of Berar and Baz Bahadur. Pir Muhammad died while retreating. The confederate army pursued the Mughals and drove them out of Malwa, and thus Baz Bahadur regained his kingdom for a brief period. In 1562, Akbar sent another army led by Abdullah Khan which finally defeated Baz Bahadur, who fled to Chittor. Baz Bahadur remained a fugutive at a number of courts until he surrendered in November 1570 to Akbar at Nagaur and joined Akbar's service. Bahadur's capital was Mandu (now in Madhya Pradesh), which then became an important city in the Mughal. The Jahaz Mahal is located in Mandu. \n* Baz Bahadur's Palace in Mandu \n* The courtyard of the Palace \n* A copper coin of Baz Bahadur"

  "text" : "Abraham (\"Bram\") Robertus Lomans (born on April 19, 1975 in Roosendaal) is a former Dutch field hockey player, who twice won the gold medal at the Olympics: in Atlanta (1996 and in Sydney (2000). He made his debut for the Dutch side on June 16, 1995 in a friendly match against Ireland. Since then the defender has played 201 international matches for Holland, in which he scored 140 goals. Lomans was famous for his penalty corners. He is one of the precursors of the drag flick technique that appeared in the 1990s. Just before the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens he was removed from the team by coach Terry Walsh. Lomans played in the Dutch League for Push and HGC, and stopped at top level in the spring of 2005. He made a comeback for the 2006/07 season in the Dutch League and scored more than 20 goals once again. He was renamed in the national team in June 2007. In 2014, Lomans, now living in Singapore, reignited his career with the Singapore Dutch, and helped the side seal gold with a 5-0 victory over Hong Kong in the final of the ZOAT at HKFC's Sports Road ground. Following the disappointment of the 2015 ZOAT, in which the Singapore Dutch finished 9th in Bangkok despite only conceding one goal the entire tournament, Lomans was determined to make amends at the annual 2016 SCC sixes tournament at The Padang. The Dutch came agonizingly close to a coveted place in the finals but eventually fell to local rivals SRC in the semi-finals, 2-0. As a small measure of consolation Lomans was however, named player of the tournament, beating out team-mate Paul Rombeek, who lost out on points for his raucous behaviour on the dance floor."

He joined the first movement for independence, L'Etoile Nord Africaine, in 1930. He became its Treasurer in 1933 and was one of its president's, Messali Hadj, two principal lieutenants and advisors during the 1930s. He was voted onto the thirty member central committee of the Etoile Nord-Africaine (ENA) and remained in this position through both subsequent renaming of the organization: the Parti du Peuple Algerien in 1937 and the Mouvement pour le Triomphe des Libertés Démocratiques in 1946. The start of the Algerian War of Independence on November 1, 1954 marked the merger of the military, religious, and political independence associations into the Front de Libération nationale (FLN). Radjef became a permanent member of this organization's central committee in 1956 and remained so until the Algerian Independence in 1962. He then joined the new Algerian government as a special attaché to the Minister of Labor and Social Affairs (Bachir Boumaza). At the same time he founded Le Secours National Algerien, whose mission was to feed, lodge, and educate the neglected shoe-shining youth of the colonial era. Radjef retired in 1978. Personal Life:Radjef had three children with his French wife, Reine Bulot: Tarek, Yamina, and Patrick (né Amar)."

Middle sister Elaina played for University of the Pacific. All three were Olympians. Beverly Oden made the news in May 2007 when she was held in custody by Orange County sheriff deputies near her hometown of Irvine, California in relation to a reported incident. The Olympic volleyball player was released after being questioned and spending an hour inside a police car. Oden was found to have no connection with the incident in question and her ordeal prompted local community leaders to form the Oden Commission to hold discussions on racial profiling between residents and law enforcement. Beverly Oden is currently working as the Volleyball Guide for the popular website About.com. She is the author of numerous articles on volleyball and also releases a weekly e-mail newsletter."

Benjamin Tammuz was born in Soviet Russia. When he was five years old, he emigrated with his parents to Palestine, where he subsequently attended the Tachkemoni school and the Herzliya Hebrew High School in Tel Aviv. From an early age, he engaged in writing, sculpture, and painting. He also took an avid interest in art history, going on to study that subject at the Sorbonne in Paris. While growing up, he became a member of the Communist underground. As a youth he was a member of the Canaanite movement. More than his teachers and friends, the artist Yitzhak Danziger was an influence on him. In 1948, Tammuz joined the editorial board of Haaretz. At first he wrote the popular column \"Uzi & Co.\" Later he edited the children's newspaper Haaretz Shelanu. From 1965, he edited Haaretz's literary and cultural supplement, serving as the art critic there. From 1971 to 1975, he served as cultural attaché at the Israeli embassy in London. From 1979 to 1984, he was invited as a writer-in-residence at Oxford University. Benjamin Tammuz died in 1989 in Tel Aviv. His son Jonathan Tammuz is a film director, whose films have included a 1997 adaptation of his father's novel Minotaur."

  "text" : "Boris Abelevich Kaufman, A.S.C. (Russian: Бори́с Абра́мович Ка́уфман; August 24, 1906 – June 24, 1980) was a cinematographerand the younger brother of filmmakers Dziga Vertov and Mikhail Kaufman. Kaufman was born into a family of Jewish intellectuals in Białystok when Congress Poland was part of the Russian Empire. After the Bolshevik Revolution of 1917, Poland regained its independence and Boris moved there with his parents. Mikhail and Denis stayed in the Soviet Union and became notable filmmakers, producing avant-garde and agitprop films. The brothers later stayed in touch primarily by letters; Vertov visited Boris Kaufman in Paris twice, in 1929 and 1931. After graduating from the University of Paris Kaufman turned to cinematography, collaborating with Jean Vigo and Dimitri Kirsanoff.During World War II, he served in the French Army against the Nazis; when France fell, Kaufman escaped to Canada. After working briefly with John Grierson for the National Film Board of Canada, he moved to the United States in 1942. Kaufman supported himself by filming short subjects and documentaries until director Elia Kazan chose Kaufman to make his American film debut as Director of Photography for On the Waterfront (1954), for which Kaufman won an Academy Award for Best Cinematography (Black and White) and a 1955 Golden Globe Award. For Baby Doll (1956), he received a second Oscar nomination. Kaufman was director of photography for Sidney Lumet's first film, 12 Angry Men (1957), and The Pawnbroker (1964). Retiring in 1970, he died in New York City in 1980."

  "text" : "David Gardner (June 11, 1926 - September 22, 1983), known as Brother Dave Gardner, was a U.S. comedian, professional drummer and singer. A Tennessee native, Gardner studied drumming, beginning at age 13. After a one-semester term as a Southern Baptist ministerial student at Union University in his hometown of Jackson, Tennessee, he began a musical career as a drummer and occasional vocalist. After a pair of demo singles for Decca Records around 1956, he had a 1958 Top-20 hit on OJ Records with White Silver Sands. It was his comedic routines between songs, however, that brought him to the attention of RCA Records artist & producer Chet Atkins. The eventual result was a comedy album interspersed with a couple of songs - Rejoice, Dear Hearts! (1959), which propelled Brother Dave into the national eye, along with the first of several appearances on national television talk/variety shows such as The Tonight Show. An arrest for marijuana possession in 1962 curtailed his visibility on television. Then, it seemed, changing public tastes (i.e., the falling out-of-favor of 'beatnik'-style comedy), coupled with Gardner's holding onto his same performing style, resulted in a similar fading of his recording career. After six albums for RCA Victor Records, he made two for Capitol Records, and then others for lesser labels. He had another legal problem over tax-evasion charges in the 1970s, which his son helped clear up. Brother Dave had a role as a Southern preacher in the 1978 made-for-TV film Big Bob Johnson's Fantastic Speed Circus. He was cast in a B-grade movie, and was just beginning work on it at the time of his death. Gardner was twice married: his first wife, Millie, preceded him in death, and he was married to his second wife, Judy, at the time of his death. He had two children from his first marriage—son Dave II (deceased, 1999) and daughter Candace Gardner Hare, married to Stan Hare and has two sons Jason & Alan Hare, the grandsons of Brother Dave Gardner and two great-grandsons Eelan & Aaron Hare fathered by Jason Hare."

  "text" : "Baldwin de Redvers, 1st Earl of Devon (died 4 June 1155), feudal baron of Plympton in Devon, was the son of Richard de Redvers and his wife Adeline Peverel. He was one of the first to rebel against King Stephen, and was the only first rank magnate never to accept the new king. He seized Exeter, and was a pirate out of Carisbrooke, but he was driven out of England to Anjou, where he joined the Empress Matilda. She made him Earl of Devon after she established herself in England, probably in early 1141. He founded several monasteries, notably those of Quarr Abbey (1131), in the Isle of Wight, a priory at Breamore, Hampshire, and the Priory of St James, at Exeter. Some monastic chronicles call his father also Earl of Devon, but no contemporary record uses the title, including the monastic charters."

  "text" : "B. Ruby Rich is an American scholar, a critic of independent, Latin American, documentary, feminist, and queer films, and a professor of Film & Digital Media and Social Documentation (also known as \"SocDoc\") at UC Santa Cruz. Among her other contributions, she is known for coining the term New Queer Cinema. She is currently the Editor of Film Quarterly, the scholarly film journal published by UC Press. Her editorials are always available free online at the Film Quarterly website. Rich began her career in film exhibition after graduating from college as co-founder of the Woods Hole Film Society. She then became associate director of what is now the Gene Siskel Film Center at the Art Institute of Chicago. After working as film critic for the Chicago Reader, she moved to New York City to become the director of the film program for the New York State Council on the Arts for a decade and began writing for the Village Voice. She then moved to San Francisco, where she began teaching: first, at the University of California, Berkeley, and now at UC Santa Cruz, as Professor of Film and Digital Media, specializing in the Social Documentation graduate program. A working cultural theorist and critic since the mid-1970s, Rich has been closely identified with some important film movements, such as independent film in the U.S. and Europe, Latin American cinema and as one of the most important voices in feminist film criticism. B. Ruby Rich appears in the 2009 documentary film For the Love of Movies: The Story of American Film Criticism where she discusses the appeal of the film, Amélie, and expresses her desire for a new kind of criticism to emerge from young critics which goes beyond \"the auteur theory.\" The back cover of her classic 1998 book, Chick Flicks: Theories and Memories of the Feminist Film Movement, reads, \"If there was a moment during the sixties, seventies, or eighties that changed the history of the women's film movement, B. Ruby Rich was there. Part journalistic chronicle, part memoir, and 100 percent pure cultural historical odyssey, Chick Flicks – with its definitive, the way-it-was collective essays – captures the birth and growth of feminist film as no other book has done.\" Rich's observations cover such things as travel, sex, and voodoo, as well as the anti-pornography movement, the films of Yvonne Rainer, a Julie Christie visit to Washington, and the historically evocative film Mädchen in Uniform. She introduces each of her essays with an autobiographical prologue that describes the intellectual, political, and personal moments from which the work arose. She does this in the hope that a new generation of feminist film culture might be revitalized by reclaiming their history. Her next book, New Queer Cinema: The Director's Cut, published in 2013, again by Duke University Press, has been widely reviewed and adopted for classes. No less than John Waters, Gus Van Sant, and Ann Cvetkovich appear on its back cover. Rich is the recipient of the 2006 Lifetime Achievement Award from the Society for Cinema and Media Studies, and she is the recipient of the 2007 Brudner Memorial Prize at Yale University. In 2012, she was awarded the Frameline Award – the first critic to receive this honor since Vito Russo was given the very first one. In 2014, the Guadalajara Film Festival presented her with its \"Queer Icon\" Maguey Award. B. Ruby Rich lives in San Francisco."

Coleridge became a QC in 1892 and served as a Judge of the High Court of Justice from 1907 to 1923. Lord Coleridge married Mary Alethea Mackarness, daughter of John Fielder Mackarness (Bishop of Oxford), on 3 August 1876. They had three children, one son and two daughters.

  "text" : "Bernard Ronald Wolfe (born December 18, 1951 in Montreal, Quebec) is a retired Canadian National Hockey League goaltender. Signed as a free agent in 1975 by the Washington Capitals, Wolfe would play for four seasons before retiring in 1979 at age 27. In 120 games played, his record was 20-61-21, with 424 goals against, a 4.17 goals against average, and one shutout. He showed flashes of brilliance and was a solid performer on a team that struggled in those early years. A former all-Canadian goalie in college, Wolfe was cool under pressure with a poor team in hockey's most difficult position. Wolfe was the president of the Washington Capitals Alumni Association from 1992 to 2007. Wolfe retired from professional hockey in 1979 and began a financial planning practice. Bernie earned his Certified Financial PlannerTM designation in 1981. Bernard R. Wolfe & Associates Inc. was recognized in 2009 & 2010 by Washingtonian Magazine as one of the Washington DC area’s top financial planning firms as voted by his peers. Wolfe's NHL \"career\" was revived briefly in 1992, when the Capitals tried to sign him in order to make him the goaltender they would expose in the 1992 NHL Expansion Draft. The move was immediately denied by the NHL for obvious reasons; Wolfe had long retired from the NHL and was well into his career as a financial planner in the Washington, D.C.-metropolitan area. Phil Esposito, who had recently become part owner of the expansion Tampa Bay Lightning was quoted as saying about the incident: \"I didn't just pay $50 million for Bernie Wolfe. He wasn't any good when I played against him\". Since the Capitals were unwilling to expose any of their current goaltenders, they would eventually sign Steve Weeks for that purpose."

  "text" : "Bjarni Bjarnason is an Icelandic writer born on 9 November 1965 in Reykjavík. He started writing poetry in his teens and by twenty had a play. He has received the Tómas Guðmundsson Award, Halldór Laxness Literature Award, and in 1996 was nominated for the Icelandic Literature Prize. Bjarni's early work was self-published, and did not receive much attention. However, his 1996 novel Endurkoma Maríu ('The Return of Mary) was a critical success: 'the novel is a fantastic tale of an unusually talented young woman and an unusual young man who loves her from afar. It takes place in several cities that show distinct similarities to certain European cities but are clearly illusory spaces'. In the estimation of Ástráður Eysteinsson and Úfhildur Dagsdóttir, 'Time is an important element in all his novels; their imagery is influenced by ancient myths and invested with a fairy tale atmosphere while simultaneously referring to modern phenomena.'"

During his high school years, he had forrayed briefly into the world of modelling, but did not enjoy the experience and quickly moved on, later working as a bricklayer. His acting career to date has seen him largely appearing as military personnel or police officers, including a leading role late in the only season of Rockpoint P.D., where he appeared as Constable Dave Tyler, and a recurring role in hit Sci-fi series Stargate: Atlantis as Sgt. Stackhouse. Boyan's most recent project, supernatural thriller Within, was completed in 2005. Brad Stirling, the character he plays in the Great British Films/Horizon Motion Pictures endeavour, is something of a departure from type - a 21-year-old graduate on a post-university trip to Europe with friends."

In 1968 he returned to the University of Alberta as an assistant professor in the Department of Computing Science. His work on ALGOL 68 put the University of Alberta on the map as a center for ALGOL 68-related activity. Barry's student Chris Thomson and friend Colin Broughton established Chion Corporation, which produced FLACC (Full Language Algol 68 Checkout Compiler). FLACC proved Barry's contention that ALGOL68 could indeed be implemented, contrary to the loud complaints from e.g., Edsger Dijkstra."

Born in Kislovodsk, Russia, his initial studies were conducted under Litinsky at the Studio of the Armenian House of Culture. His studies were interrupted by World War II, for which he was decorated for his service. He resumed his post-war studies as a violin student at the Gnessin School in Moscow until his graduation in 1950. After graduation, he moved to Estonia, initially obtaining a post in the Tallinn Radio Orchestra, then later deciding to focus on composing. He entered the conservatory at Tallinn, studying composition under Heino Eller. Parsadanian became an \"adopted\" Estonian, residing there until his death. He wrote all of his major works while living in Estonia, and eventually received the distinction of Honoured Artist of the Estonian Soviet Socialist Republic. His compositions include eleven symphonies composed between 1958 and 1987, the second of them a tribute to Martiros Saryan; a violin concerto (1955), a wind quintet (1967), a string quartet (1974), a violin sonata (1986) and other music."

In 1990 Ritter was forced to resign from Covenant House after widespread reports that he had engaged in sexual relations with several youth in the care of the charity, and had financial improprieties in the operations of the organization. It was one of the most widely publicized cases of sexual abuse within the Catholic Church, which was revealed over the next two decades to be widespread. He also left the Franciscans, but retained his priestly faculties. He retired to a small town in upstate New York."

  "text" : "Bruce Oram Davidson (born December 31, 1949, in Rome, New York) is an American equestrian who competes in the sport of eventing. He grew up in a family uninterested in horses, but began to compete in Pony Club events after a family friend introduced him to riding. He began college at Iowa State University, but left in his third year to train full-time with the United States Equestrian Team. In 1974 he married, and his two children were born in 1976 and 1977. His son, Bruce Davidson, Jr., has followed in his footsteps to become a top eventing rider. At 18, Davidson tried out for the United States eventing team and was accepted. He won his first medal as a member of the silver-medal-winning US team at the 1972 Summer Olympics. After that, Davidson went to win gold at the 1976 and 1984 Olympics and silver in 1996, participating unsuccessfully in 1988. He has also competed repeatedly at both the World Equestrian Games and the Pan American Games, winning medals at both, as well as winning repeatedly at the top-level Badminton Horse Trials and Rolex Kentucky Three Day events. In the 1980s and early 1990s, Davidson was a consistently top-level rider on both the American and international eventing scenes. He is also known for his horse breeding and training abilities."

First, You Cry was made into a television movie starring Mary Tyler Moore as Rollin. Rollin's mother Ida was diagnosed with terminal ovarian cancer in 1981, and Rollin helped her mother end her life in 1983. She revealed this in her book Last Wish, published in 1985 and republished in 1998. One critic called it \"a document of personal compassion and public importance.\" The book has been published in 19 countries and was made into a TV movie in 1992 starring Patty Duke as Rollin and Maureen Stapleton as her mother. Since the book was published, Rollin has been active in the Death with Dignity movement. She is now on the Advisory Board of Compassion and Choices.

His range of interests encompasses early music, contemporary composition, jazz and improvisation, and he has worked with a wide variety of orchestras in the UK and Europe. He also taught at Guildhall School of Music. Born in London, Guy came to the fore as an improvising bassist as a member of a trio with pianist Howard Riley and drummer Tony Oxley (Witherden, 1969). He also became an occasional member of John Stevens' ensembles in the 1960s and 1970s, including the Spontaneous Music Ensemble. In the early 1970s, he was a member of the influential free improvisation group Iskra 1903 with Derek Bailey and trombonist Paul Rutherford (a project revived in the late 1970s, with violinist Philipp Wachsmann replacing Bailey). He also formed a long-standing partnership with saxophonist Evan Parker, which led to a trio with drummer Paul Lytton which became one of the best-known and most widely travelled free-improvising groups of the 1980s and 1990s. He was briefly a member of the Michael Nyman Band in the 1980s, performing on the soundtrack of The Draughtsman's Contract."

  "text" : "Mary Jane Rathbun (December 22, 1922 – April 10, 1999), popularly known as Brownie Mary, was an American medical cannabis activist. As a hospital volunteer at San Francisco General Hospital, she became known for illegally baking and distributing cannabis brownies to AIDS patients. Along with activist Dennis Peron, Rathbun lobbied for the legalization of cannabis for medical use, and she helped pass San Francisco Proposition P (1991) and California Proposition 215 (1996) to achieve those goals. She also contributed to the establishment of the San Francisco Cannabis Buyers Club, the first medical cannabis dispensary in the United States. Rathbun was arrested on three occasions, with each arrest bringing increased local, national, and international media attention to the medical cannabis movement. Her grandmotherly appearance generated public sympathy for her cause and undermined attempts by the district attorney's office to prosecute her for possession. The City of San Francisco eventually gave Rathbun permission to distribute cannabis brownies to people with AIDS. Her arrests generated interest in the medical community and motivated researchers to propose one of the first clinical trials to study the effects of cannabinoids in HIV-infected adults."

  "text" : "Bernard H. Pietenpol (1901–1984) was an aircraft designer. Father of home built aircraft, Pietenpol was a self-taught mechanic who lived most of his life in the small community of Cherry Grove in southeastern Minnesota. His most well-known design, The Pietenpol Air Camper, is an airplane he designed to be built and flown by the \"average American\" of the 1930s. The Air Camper is a two-place open cockpit monoplane with \"parasol\" wing built from material that was, in the 1930s, readily available from local sources. Powered by a Ford Model A engine, Pietenpol's design was sturdy, simple and affordable. Plans were first published in Modern Mechanics and Inventions, then in the magazine's 1932 Flying and Glider manual. With the success of the Air Camper, MMI editor Weston Farmer convinced Pietenpol to design an airplane that could be powered with the cheaper and more readily available Ford Model T engine. In response to Farmer's request, Pietenpol designed the single-place Pietenpol Sky Scout. Air Campers have been built using many (over 50 have been recorded) different power plants. Pietenpol himself liked the air-cooled Corvair engine. But his original design is well suited to the high torque, slow-turning Model \"A.\" A restored example of the Air Camper can be found in the inventory of the Mid-Atlantic Air Museum in Reading, Pennsylvania. In later years, Pietenpol sold and repaired television sets. In 1981, the Pietenpol Workshop and Garage was added to the National Register of Historic Places. His hangar was disassembled and relocated to Pioneer Airport, in Oshkosh, Wisconsin as part of the EAA AirVenture Museum. Pietenpol died in 1984, and was inducted in the Minnesota Aviation Hall of Fame in 1991."

  "text" : "Brendan McGahon (born 22 November 1936) is a former Irish Fine Gael politician. He was a Teachta Dála (TD) for the Louth constituency. Often described as 'colourful' and with a reputation as a social conservative, McGahon was first elected to Dáil Éireann at the November 1982 general election and retained his seat until retiring at the 2002 general election. McGahon was born in Dundalk, County Louth and was educated at St. Mary's College in Dundalk. His grandfather, T.F. McGahon, was one of the inaugural members of Dundalk Urban District Council when it was created along with other Irish local authorities by the British Government in 1898. T.F. McGahon was a leading member of the Irish Parliamentary Party (IPP). He started a local newspaper, the Dundalk Democrat which was supportive of the IPP. T.F. was a critic of the War of Independence campaign, of Sinn Féin, and of the then IRA, arguing that the campaign would result in the partition of Ireland. He was later succeeded on the council by his son, O.B. McGahon who in turn was followed by his nephew, Hugh McGahon. The family subsequently supported the National League Party and the Independent TD James Coburn and joined Fine Gael when Coburn joined the party. They were also prominent members of the Ancient Order of Hibernians. Brendan married Celine Lundy, a widow from Newry, County Down, and took over the running of the family newspaper business in the 1960s and succeeded his cousin Hugh, on Dundalk Town Council and on Louth County Council at the 1979 local elections. He played soccer for Dundalk F.C. in the Premier Division for a number of years. McGahon was an unsuccessful candidate at the 1981 general election and at the February 1982 general election. He was first elected to Dáil Éireann for Louth at the November 1982 general election defeating incumbent Fine Gael TD, Bernard Markey. He was re-elected at the next five general elections. A maverick and outspoken TD he was known to speak his mind on many issues including divorce, crime, single mothers, the drinks industry and was an outspoken critic of the Provisional IRA throughout his time in politics. He once advocated that paedophiles should be castrated as part of their prison sentence and was the only TD to oppose the referendum to abolish the death penalty from the Constitution. He also argued that those aged under 21 years of age should not be able to drive or drink. He did not contest the 2002 general election and retired from politics. He opposed the decriminalisation of homosexuality and said: \"I regard homosexuals as being in a sad category, but I believe homosexuality to be an abnormality, some type of psycho-sexual problem that has defied explanation over the years. I do not believe that the Irish people desire this normalisation of what is clearly an abnormality. Homosexuality is a departure from normality and while homosexuals deserve our compassion they do not deserve our tolerance. That is how the man in the street thinks. I know of no homosexual who has been discriminated against. Such people have a persecution complex because they know they are different from the masses or normal society. They endure inner torment and it is not a question of the way others view them. The lord provided us with sexual organs for a specific purpose. Homosexuals are like left-hand drivers driving on the right-hand side of the road.\" McGahon lives in Ravensdale, County Louth. His son, Conor, was a councillor from 1991–99 and his brother, Johnny, lost his seat in the 2004 local elections ending the McGahon family's 108 consecutive year representation on Dundalk Town Council and Louth County Council. His nephew, John McGahon, was elected to Louth County Council at the 2014 local elections."

  "text" : "Bruno Schweizer (3 May 1897 – 11 November 1958) was a German linguist, best known for his work with the Nazi Ahnenerbe division. Schweizer was a personal believer in the theory that a Germanic stronghold in northeastern Italy gave rise to the Cimbrians, during the Middle Ages before and after its alleged end in 774. On March 10, 1938, Schweizer organized an Ahnenerbe-sponsored expedition to Iceland, hoping to discover shrines to the Norse gods Odin or Thor. During the expedition later that year, he sent back correspondence to Heinrich Himmler complaining that the Icelandic people had abandoned traditional crafts such as forging, wood-carving, spinning, weaving and dyeing; and that they had also forgotten their traditional myths and legends, thus losing belief in the ‘transcendent nature’ that the Ahnenerbe held dearly to. The mission was eventually aborted, citing uncooperative Icelandic government officials who restricted access to certain locations. While Schweizer's tight commitment to Germanic racism is disputable, his linguistic works are fully acknowledged and appreciated by former and present linguists."

  "text" : "Barry Gray (born Bernard Yaroslaw; July 2, 1916; Red Lion, New Jersey – December 21, 1996) was an American radio personality, often labeled as \"The father of Talk Radio\". Initially a disc jockey, Gray was working for New York's WMCA radio station in 1945 when he, bored one evening with simply spinning music, decided to put the telephone receiver up to his microphone and share his conversation with the listening audience. The caller that evening just happened to be bandleader Woody Herman, one of the most popular celebrities of the day. This spontaneous live interview was such a hit with both his listeners as well as station bosses, that the talk radio format resulted. Gray subsequently began doing listener call-ins as well. However, the technical aspects of early Cold War broadcasting were challenged by the live call-in, over-the air format. U.S. government restrictions and problematic consequences could not stop Gray's talk show success in putting listeners on the air ... with or without WMCA and the government's permission. His audience loved it, and grew exponentially. Rival station WOR also saw the attraction of the talk format, and Gray worked an overnight shift there from 1945 to 1948 or 1949,   interviewing everyone from Al Jolson to Adam Clayton Powell, Jr.  He also broadcast for WMGM from the Copacabana night club in the late 1940s. . In addition during 1947 he hosted the New York-based show Scout About Town for the Mutual Broadcasting System, during which he would present an Award of the Week to popular stars of the stage such as Mitzi Green and Morey Amsterdam. Gray broadcast on WMIE AM radio from three Miami Beach nightclubs, the Copa Lounge, Danny and Doc's Jewel Box and the Martha Ray Club nightly in the fall of 1948 and into 1949 before he left the Miami area under some pressure. Gray bopped someone from his audience with his microphone,and this happened on the air. The impact was audible and the impact had been preceded by hot words of anger. This report of recollection fifty-eight years later comes from Ernest W. Bennett of Miami, Florida, who listened to Gray's broadcast every weeknight, beginning in Bennett's sophomore year at the University of Miami in the fall of 1948. Carl Warner, a retired newspaper publisher living in Clinton, Tennessee, was then the remote engineer for the Barry Gray Miami Beach broadcasts. He also recalls the bopping-mike incident. He remembers hearing a loud bang in his headphones and looking up to the Copa Lounge stage seeing the podium turned over and Barry signaling him to cut the mikes. After about 30 seconds of dead air, he asked for his mike to be turned on. Bennett recalls that period, and recalls from memory other reports of Gray's other pugnacious altercations, the final one, the audible one, was what apparently impelled Gray's departure. Gray said himself as Bennett recalls the exciting live-broadcast event, \"I just hit the guy over the head with my microphone, folks.\" In this case the victim had been the aggressor toward Gray. The so-called victim was Reubin Clein, publisher of Miami Life. Reubin Clein was considered an agitator and generally an aggressive character. He was a former boxer; there were many in Miami who felt Clein should have been put in his place, but no one would ever mess with him because he was one of toughest people you would ever meet. Clein was always into Wild West characters and would often wear a cowboy hat, boots and would have a big wooly beard. A generally gentle person would not take crap from anyone and actually broke the mayor's nose at a political rally. According to Bennett, Gray was popular on Miami radio:\"He was very big here; number one, like Larry King is known today. Indeed, Larry King began his broadcasting career from a houseboat anchored in front of the Miami Beach Fountainbleau Hotel in 1957.\" Barry Gray returned to WMCA in 1950, and stayed there for 39 years, refining the talk show format still utilized today. During the 1960s, he was in the odd position of having an 11 p.m.-1 a.m. late night talk show on a station otherwise dominated by Top 40 music and the youth-targeted \"Good Guys\" disc jockey campaign. But for teenagers who kept their radios on into the night, Gray's show was a window into the high-brow New York culture of the 1940s and 1950s. Gray would often have authors on, and he made a point of saying he had actually read their books, something not all talk show hosts did. Gray also had a tendency towards risqué (for the time) topics, such as the novel nudity found in European films playing in art houses, or characteristics of the prostitution scene in Manhattan. He was also known as a fierce critic of bigotry and survived the ugliness of McCarthyism and the Red Scare. A constant target of the blacklisting right-wing columnist Walter Winchell, who called him \"Borey Pink\" and \"a disk jerk\" in the 1950s , Barry was fearless in calling out those he found mired in hypocrisy and abusive in power. The Winchell feud seemed to haunt him, however; years after Winchell had lost influence and become a recluse, Gray would still talk darkly on air about plots and physical attacks Winchell had orchestrated against him. Indeed, a 1995 biography of Winchell would report that he kept a photograph of a bloodied Gray on his walls. After WMCA changed to an all-talk format in 1970, Gray was again fully in his element. He never backed away from discussing hot topics in politics, especially those that affected New Yorkers. A 1973 profile described him as \"brash, abrasive [and] opinionated. [He] was the talk-show titan listeners love to hate, [and] is still going after more than a quarter of a century at the mike.\" By the 1980s he had shifted from a late-night to a mid-day slot at the station. Gray left WMCA in 1989 when it dropped its talk format, and went to work slightly up the dial for a return to WOR where he enjoyed national syndication. By the time of his death, his show was considered to be politically conservative. Gray appeared as his disc jockey self in the 1949 short subject Spin That Splatter. Gray also pioneered in early television, first as the host of The Barry Gray Show on New York WOR-TV when Channel 9 went on the air in 1949, then more visibly as host of the first Goodson and Todman game show Winner Take All, replacing Bud Collyer in 1951. In 2002, industry publication Talkers magazine selected Barry Gray as the 8th greatest radio talk show host of all time."

  "text" : "Bert Cochran (December 25, 1913? – June 6, 1984) was an American Communist politician and author. Cochran was born in Poland in 1913 and moved to the US at an early age. His birth name was Alexander Goldfarb. In the 1930s, Cochran attended the University of Wisconsin–Madison where he was recruited to the Trotskyist movement by Max Shachtman. In 1938 when a group of American Trotskyists under the leadership of James P. Cannon formed the Socialist Workers Party, Bert Cochran was one of them. For a number of years, Cochran was part of the National Committee, the leading body of the SWP and became the party's main leader in Detroit. Under the pen-name E.R. Frank he was a regular contributor to the magazine of the Fourth International, which the SWP supported. In the beginning of the 1950s, Bert Cochran became the leader of a faction inside the Socialist Workers Party that opposed the leadership of Cannon and instead favoured the approach of Michel Pablo, a leader of the Fourth International. The faction, known to their opponents as the Cochranites, argued that the SWP was abstaining in a sectarian manner from the opportunity to intervene into the radical layers around the Communist Party. The SWP's leadership interpreted this as meaning that the current around Cochran no longer believed a revolution in the United States was possible, and that they had recoiled from revolutionary activity under the dual pressures of relative post-World War II capitalist prosperity and the accompanying McCarthy-era anti-communist witch-hunt. Cochran was also criticised for proposing to remove the image of Trotsky from the masthead of the SWP's newspaper, The Militant. Eventually, Bert Cochran and the Cochranites were expelled from the SWP in 1954, which meant that the party lost a great deal of its members in Detroit and the Cleveland area. James P. Cannon sent Ed Shaw to lead the reconstruction of the party's branch in Detroit. Bert Cochran, with Harry Braverman and about one hundred of his supporters founded the Socialist Union of America, which existed from 1954 to approx. 1959. After a short period out of regular political activity, he became a sponsor of the Third Camp journal, New Politics (magazine), and remained so until the journal's demise in 1976. Cochran taught labor relations at the New School for Social Research and Empire State College and was a senior fellow at the Research Institute on International Change at Columbia University. He wrote six books, one of which, Labor and Communism: The Conflict that Shaped American Unions (1977), was nominated for a Pulitzer Prize. He died from cancer the summer of 1984 before the re-launch of New Politics in the mid-1980s."

Born in Boston, he graduated from Harvard in 1929, took the M.A. in 1930, and received the Ph.D. in 1935. Otis taught at Hobart College from 1935 to 1957, then at American University of Beirut for one year before accepting a position at Stanford University as Professor of Classics. In 1970 he moved to the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill where he followed T. Robert S. Broughton as George L. Paddison Professor of Latin. While at Stanford Otis was one of the founders of the Intercollegiate Center for Classical Studies in Rome, Italy, in 1965. He was a member of the Guild of Scholars of The Episcopal Church. Otis was known for some of the most concise and penetrating critical essays written on classical literature. His first book, published at the age of 55, was Virgil: A Study in Civilized Poetry (1963), which was immediately recognized as a classic. He also wrote Ovid as an Epic Poet (1966) and the posthumous Cosmos and Tragedy: An Essay on the Meaning of Aeschylus (1981), edited with notes and a preface by E. Christian Kopff), which was part of a long manuscript left unfinished at his death, entitled \"The Transcendence of Tragedy\"."

  "text" : "Bob DeSimone (born April 15, 1946) is an American actor who has starred in several movies. He is perhaps best known for his role as Billy, the cocaine-snorting mental health worker, in the 1985 horror movie Friday the 13th: A New Beginning. His other films were Savage Streets (1984), and Angel III: The Final Chapter. DeSimone also appeared on the hit comedy show, Make Me Laugh and was a headliner at The Comedy Store and Improv during their heyday, working with Jay Leno, David Letterman, Richard Prior and Jerry Seinfeld. Before DeSimone turned to comedy and acting, he was, (and still is) an accomplished drummer. Almost immediately after arriving in California, he was in demand. The early 1970s found DeSimone playing with many top bands in and out of the studios. He was a fixture at the Ash Grove club in West Hollywood, noted for promoting up and coming blues and folk musicians. Teaming up with Bernie Pearl, they both backed Lightnin' Hopkins, Big Mama Thornton, The Bernie Pearl Band, Dr. John, Albert King, Luke \"Long Gone\" Miles, Taj Mahal and Chuck Berry. From there he signed on with Atlantic Records with a popular Country Rock band named, \"Country\". With a signature sound, beautiful harmonies, strong musicianship and all original material, they were described by many as a \"Rhythmic Cross Between Crosby Stills & Nash, and \"The Band\". Signed by Peter Asher, they opened for America, Fleetwood Mac, Linda Ronstadt, and the Bee Gees. COUNTRY featured future Grammy award winning songwriter Tom Snow, UK Fanzine FANTASTIC EXPEDITION published their full story in 2014 in conjunction with all the surviving band members. DeSimone left acting in 1983 and began his own successful business. He still plays drums and is currently working with local R&B, blues and rock bands in Southern California. As he stated in a Friday 13th interview:\"Drumming will always be in my blood\" He married his girlfriend, Lisa Stern in 1994, and together they have two daughters, Amanda and Gianna. They live in Santa Rosa Valley, California"

  "text" : "Brad Ellis is an American composer, musical director, singer, orchestrator, and jazz pianist. Ellis is perhaps most visible as the quiet teacher/piano accompanist for the high school kids on Glee, the Fox television show for which he is part of creator Ryan Murphy's musical production team. Ellis grew up in the Boston area, attending Lexington High School. One of his teachers introduced him to the music program at Boston's Berklee College of Music, where Ellis would study music composition starting in the late 1970s, earning his degree between gigs over the next fifteen years. Ellis had a long association with the continuously evolving Off-Broadway satirical revue Forbidden Broadway. His Brad Ellis Little Big Band has released recordings, as produced by Bruce Kimmel. Ellis arranged, orchestrated and conducted members of the Los Angeles Philharmonic for their 2006 album Unexpected Dreams: Songs from the Stars, in support of the Philharmonic's \"Music Matters\" fund for music education. The album featured performances by TV and film stars including Victor Garber, Lucy Lawless, and Scarlett Johansson. In 2006 Ellis orchestrated and arranged the world premiere of Billy Joel's \"Waltz Variations no.2 op.5\", performed by Christoph Eschenbach and the Philadelphia Orchestra, for the 151st Anniversary Gala celebration of Philadelphia's Academy of Music. He created, with Jason Alexander, Seven Broadway Shows in 7 Minutes. This witty medley was performed by Alexander with the Hollywood Bowl Orchestra, when the orchestra inducted its long-time conductor John Mauceri into the Hollywood Bowl Hall of Fame in 2007. Ellis is the composer of the original music for the 2009 Off Broadway run of The Tin Pan Alley Rag, which told the story of a fictional meeting between musical greats Scott Joplin and Irving Berlin. Ellis has composed or played piano for many TV shows and films, including Gilmore Girls (in the Season 5 episode \"Jews and Chinese Food\"), Close to Home, Delovely and the DVD special features for Beauty and the Beast. In 2009, Ellis joined the production team creating the new television series Glee. Ellis joined the team as a musical director and vocal coach, but received additional duties as an on-screen, virtually non-speaking character providing piano accompaniment to the glee club. From the pilot episode, Ellis' name appears in the technical credits rather than the character credits of his on-screen episodes. The enigmatic role has led to Ellis being featured in interviews with People magazine, CNN.com, National Public Radio and Entertainment Weekly. In 2009, Ellis was part of the team that created the music and lyrics for the opening number for 81st Academy Awards telecast, as performed by Oscar host Hugh Jackman. The four main creators won the 2009 Emmy Award for Original Music and Lyrics for their work, while Ellis was bestowed a certificate of honor by the Emmy award's Academy of Television Arts and Sciences, in June 2010, for his contributions of original music and lyrics to the number. In 2011, Ellis worked with Robert Ulrich, casting director for Glee, on the first special episode of The Glee Project, coaching 80 potential candidates for the show. He was featured in the music segment of the special one-hour \"Audition Process\" episode that teased in the pilot of The Glee Project.To the delight and surprise of many Glee fans, he spoke on the show. In July, 2013, Ellis was piano accompanist for Glee star Matthew Morrison's run at the 54 Below nightclub in Manhattan. The show opened the same night that Glee co-star Cory Monteith died, so the two opened each subsequent show with the song What I Did For Love, from A Chorus Line, as a tribute to Monteith. Ellis received a heart transplant in 1999, after suffering from heart failure due to a virus as a child. On June 22, 2011, he was honored by Donate Life Hollywood as their \"Person Of The Year\" for his work promoting organ transplant awareness."

  "text" : "Bryan Herbert Wynter (8 September 1915 – 2 February 1975)  was one of the St. Ives group of British painters. His work was mainly abstract, drawing upon nature for inspiration. Born in London, he was educated at Haileybury. In 1933 he began work as a trainee in his family's laundry business. In 1937-38 he studied at Westminster School of Art, and 1938-40 at the Slade School of Fine Art in London and Oxford. In the Second World War he was a conscientious objector, first working on land drainage in Oxfordshire, then looking after monkeys being studied by the zoologist Solly Zuckerman. He settled in Zennor, Cornwall in 1945, and in 1946 was co-founder of the Crypt Group. He married Suzanne Lethbridge, daughter of the writer Mabel Lethbridge whom he met in Cornwall. He taught at Bath Academy of Art, Corsham, 1951-56. He was a member of the London Group of artists, and of the Penwith Society of Arts. He died at Penzance, Cornwall. His auction record is £115,250 for his painting \"The Indias\", set at Sotheby's on 3 November 2010. In 2001 he was the subject of Bryan Wynter: A Selected Retrospective at Tate St Ives. Some of his most remarkable works are constructions which he titled IMOOS (Images Moving Out Onto Space). Using a parabolic mirror, he would hang contrasting pairs of painted shapes, which rotated freely. Their reversed reflections enlarged, appearing to move in opposite directions."

  "text" : "Beverly Garland (October 17, 1926 – December 5, 2008) was an American film and television actress, businesswoman, and hotel owner. Her work in feature films was fairly minor, consisting of small parts in a few major productions and leads in low-budget action or science fiction movies. She may be best remembered as Barbara Harper Douglas, the woman who married widower Steve Douglas (Fred MacMurray) in the latter years of the beloved sitcom My Three Sons. She played that role from 1969 until the series ended in 1972. In the 1980s, she co-starred as Kate Jackson's widowed mother, \"Dotty West\", in the CBS television series Scarecrow and Mrs. King. She had a recurring role as Ginger Jackson on 7th Heaven."

  "text" : "Burnum Burnum (10 January 1936 – 18 August 1997) was an Australian Aboriginal activist, actor, and author. He was a Woiworrung and Yorta Yorta man at Wallaga Lake in southern New South Wales. He was originally named Harry Penrith but took the name of his great grandfather, which means Great Warrior. When he was a child, he was orphaned at an early age and spent many of his early years in children's homes run by the NSW Aborigines Welfare Board, most notably Kinchela Boys Home at Kempsey. The Welfare Board promoted his achievements in his rugby league and surf lifesaving at Kempsey in Dawn, and reported that he left Kinchela to become an Aboriginal pioneer in the NSW Public Service, working for the Department of Agriculture, where he remained for 13 years. He also played first grade Rugby Union for Parramatta, and both rugby league and cricket. While attending the University of Tasmania in the late 1960s, he led a successful movement to reclaim the remains of Truganini from the Tasmanian Museum for cremation. He was awarded a Churchill Fellowship in 1975 to study other Indigenous people. He may be best remembered for planting the Aboriginal flag on the white cliffs of Dover on the Australian Bicentenary Day of 26 January 1988. This was his tongue-in-cheek way of claiming England, as Arthur Phillip had done to Burnum Burnum's homeland in 1788 when arriving with the First Fleet. A copy of the Burnum Burnum Declaration is on display among the indigenous carvings and sculptures at the Enchanted Maze (a.k.a. Arthur's Seat Maze), Mornington Peninsula, Melbourne, Australia. In 1986, Burnum Burnum played roles in three films. The first was Dark Age, a thriller set in outback and tropical Australia, and which also starred David Gulpillil as Burnum's son. The second was Ground Zero, a thriller containing themes critical of the British and Australian governments' treatment of Indigenous Australians during nuclear weapon testing at Maralinga. The third was a satirical film, Marsupials: The Howling III, in which Burnum's character becomes a werewolf in the form of a Tasmanian tiger. Burnum appeared as Uncle Albert in the TV series Bony in 1992. Burnum stood for election in the NSW parliament, in the upper house ( Legislative assembly) during the Wran government era. Former Prime Minister John Howard described Burnum Burnum as \"a very gracious man and very strongly committed to the welfare of Aboriginal Australians\". Burnum Burnum lived in Woronora in his later life and was active in the local community. He died from heart disease on 18 August 1997. A portrait of Burnum Burnum now hangs in Sutherland Library. In 2005 Jannali Reserve was renamed Burnum Burnum Reserve in his honour."

  "text" : "Big Bill Bissonnette (born February 5, 1937) is a jazz trombonist, drummer, and producer. He is a strong advocate of New Orleans jazz as played by the veteran African-American musicians. In the 1960s, he ran his own group The Easy Riders Jazz Band, formed his own label Jazz Crusade, and organized Northern tours for such veteran players as Kid Thomas Valentine, George Lewis, and Jim Robinson. After a period off the scene, with the successful publication of his 1992 memoirs, The Jazz Crusade (which has many stories about New Orleans' musicians), Bissonnette reactivated his label and began to play again. He has produced over 100 recorded jazz sessions for his Jazz Crusade label and has appeared as trombonist or drummer on over 50 recording sessions of New Orleans jazz.Big Bill Bissonnette has always been a controversial figure on the New Orleans jazz scene. He has often rushed in where \"angels feared to tread\" to make that one last recording of some obscure jazzman. His 1960s group, \"The Easy Riders Jazz Band\" was the most acclaimed revival band of the era and recorded with many of the legendary New Orleans jazzmen. He brought reedman Sammy Rimington to America when he was still just a youngster for one of his first big breaks which later led to his amazing success in the jazz field. Bissonnette came in first place as \"New Young Artist\" in the 1965 Jazzology Jazz Poll. Over 30 years later he placed #5 among all jazz trombonists in the latest edition of that same poll. He is also well known as a drummer. He was the legitimate protege of trombonist Big Jim Robinson, perhaps the greatest of all New Orleans trombonists. He studied drums with the legendary Sammy Penn. On his drumset sits the wooden ratchet used by Baby Dodds on his famous drum instruction recordings. He uses a slapstick made for him by Kid Thomas Valentine and one of Jim Robinson's mouthpieces sits on a shelf in his living room. He has now produced over one hundred and 30 recording sessions. He has spent much of the 1990s documenting the British jazz scene with his \"Best of the Brits\" CD series. He published a newsletter several times a year. He traveled the world sitting-in with local New Orleans style bands or with his own touring all-star band. He is featured on over 50 albums on both trombone and drums. Among those he has recorded or played with are: Henry Red Allen, Victoria Spivey, Edmond Hall, Jimmy Archey, Zutty Singleton, George Lewis, Big Jim Robinson, Sammy Penn, Kid Thomas Valentine, Don Ewell, Creole George Guesnon, Dr. Michael White, Gregg Stafford, Freddy Lonzo, Tuba Fats Lacen, Pat Hawes, George Probert, Bob Helm, Pops Foster, Paul Polo Barnes, Kid Sheik Colar, Alvin Alcorn, Alecs Bigard, Slow Drag Pavageau, Albert Burbank and many other top traditional jazz stars. Bissonnette retired in 2006 and now lives in Concord, North Carolina U. S. A."

  "text" : "Bennie Moten (November 13, 1894 – April 2, 1935) was an American jazz pianist and band leader born in Kansas City, Missouri. He led the Kansas City Orchestra, the most important of the regional, blues-based orchestras active in the Midwest in the 1920s, and helped to develop the riffing style that would come to define many of the 1930s Big Bands. His first recordings were made (for OKeh Records) in 1923, and were rather typical interpretations of the New Orleans style of King Oliver and others. They also showed the influence of the ragtime that was still popular in the area, as well as the stomping beat that the band was famous for. These OKeh sides (recorded 1923–1925) are some of the more valuable acoustic jazz 78s of the era and continue to be treasured records in many serious jazz collections. They signed with Victor Records in 1926, and were influenced by the more sophisticated style of Fletcher Henderson, but more often than not featured a hard stomp beat that was extremely popular in Kansas City. Moten remained one of Victor's most popular orchestras through 1930. The song Kansas City Shuffle was recorded during this time. (The band recorded prolifically and many of their records were issued in Victor's regular series, therefore not specifically marketed to the Black community.) By 1928 Moten's piano was showing some boogie woogie influences, but the real revolution came in 1929 when he recruited Count Basie, Walter Page and Oran 'Hot Lips' Page. Walter Page's walking bass lines gave the music an entirely new feel compared to the 2/4 tuba of his predecessor Vernon Page, coloured by Basie's understated, syncopated piano fills. Another boon to the band was adding Jimmy Rushing as their primary vocalist. Their final session (10 recordings made at Victor's Camden, New Jersey, studios on December 13, 1932, during a time when the band was suffering significant financial hardship) showed the early stages of what became known as the \"Basie sound\", four years before Basie recorded under his own name. By this time Ben Webster and Rushing had joined Moten's band, but Moten himself did not play on these sessions. These sides (mostly arranged by Eddie Durham) include a number of tunes that later became swing classics: \n*  \"Toby\" \n*  \"Moten Swing\" \n*  \"The Blue Room\" \n*  \"Imagination\" (vocals: Sterling Russell Trio) \n*  \"New Orleans\" (vocal: Jimmy Rushing) \n*  \"The Only Girl I Ever Loved\" (vocals: Sterling Russell Trio) \n*  \"Milenberg Joys\" \n*  \"Lafayette\" \n*  \"Prince of Wails\" (often mistitled as \"Prince of Wales\") \n*  \"Two Times\" (recorded with six musicians and with vocalist Josephine Garrison) Moten died at Kansas City's Wheatley-Provident Hospital on April 2, 1935 following a failed tonsillectomy operation. Basie, subsequently, took many of the leading musicians from the band to form his own orchestra. Moten's popular 1928 recording of \"South\" on Victor V-38021 (itself a remake of the first version on OKeh from late 1924) stayed in Victor's catalog over the years (reissued as 24893 in 1935 as Victor phased out any remaining V-38000 series that were still in the catalog) and became a big jukebox hit in the late 1940s (by then, reissued as 44-0004). It remained in print (as a vinyl 45) until RCA stopping making vinyl records."

His work led to a position at the Utica Conservatory of Music where he was head of the brass instrument department.

  "text" : "Barbara Cottman Becnel (born May 30, 1950) is an American author, journalist, and film producer. She was a close friend and advocate for Crips co-founder Stanley Williams (aka \"Stan Tookie Williams\"; a convicted murderer and former gang leader who would later become an anti-gang activist and writer), and editor of Williams's series of children's books, which spoke out against gang violence. Williams was executed in 2005. Becnel co-produced the Golden Globe-nominated film Redemption: The Stan Tookie Williams Story, which starred award-winning actress Lynn Whitfield playing the role of Becnel. Becnel was in attendance at Williams' execution as one of his chosen witnesses. After he was pronounced dead, she, along with two of his friends, television executive Shirley Neal and movie producer Rudy Langlais, stood up and yelled that California had executed an innocent man. After the execution, she said \"We are going to prove his innocence, and when we do, we are going to show that Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger is, in fact, himself a cold blooded murderer.\" Williams directed Becnel to make the arrangements for his funeral, which was held at Bethel African Methodist Episcopal Church on December 20, 2005. More than 3,000 people attended Williams' memorial service. On Sunday, June 25, 2006, Becnel and Neal released Williams' ashes into a lake in Thokoza Park, located in the black township of Soweto, Johannesburg, South Africa. In February 2009, Becnel and Neal released Tribute: Stanley Tookie Williams, 1953-2005, a documentary they directed and produced about Williams. Announcing her intention to defeat Schwarzenegger in the upcoming gubernatorial election, Becnel ran for the Democratic Party's nomination for Governor of California in 2006,  and came in third (out of eight Democrats) behind Phil Angelides and Steve Westly. She made history because Becnel was the first black female Democrat to ever run for Governor of California. Her campaign was very grassroots-based, although it received media attention. She finished with 66,544 votes overall, which amounted to 2.7% of all ballots cast. She also raised enough money in the last week of the campaign to run television and radio commercials about her candidacy. She publicly denounced Democratic Gubernatorial candidates Phil Angelides and Steve Westly for supporting the death penalty. She is also outspoken on other social issues, such as the environment and immigration. Barbara's outspoken criticism of Angelides and Westly resulted in her not being invited to a number of key Democratic Party events during the general election season . This, coupled with differences over issues such as the death penalty, led Barbara to leave the Democratic Party. In the first weeks of 2007 Barbara left the Democratic Party and joined the Green Party of California, the state affiliate of the Green Party (GPUS). When asked why she joined the Green Party, Becnel responded, \"The Green Party is right on the issues--no ifs, ands, or buts.\""

  "text" : "Brad McGann MNZM (22 February 1964 – 2 May 2007), was a New Zealand film director and screenwriter. McGann was born in New Zealand in 1964. He completed a Bachelor of Commerce degree at the University of Otago and in 1988 completed a one-year post-graduate course at the Swinburne School of Film and Television (now a part of the Victorian College of the Arts) in Melbourne. He directed the drama It Never Rains in 1996 as well as co-directing the documentary Come As You Are for the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, and the award-winning short film Possum. In 2004 and 2005 McGann won international acclaim for his first full-length feature film, In My Father's Den, which was based on Maurice Gee's novel. McGann both wrote the screenplay and directed the film. The film won the Fipresci Prize at the 2004 Toronto International Film Festival and the Mercedes Benz Youth Jury Prize at the 52nd San Sebastian Film Festival in Spain in the same year, and the Special Jury Prize at the Seattle International Film Festival in 2005. It became one of the top 10 grossing New Zealand films. McGann was made a Member of the New Zealand Order of Merit in the 2006 New Years Honours List. He died on 2 May 2007 after a long battle with bowel cancer (he was first diagnosed in 1998)."

  "text" : "Brian Brolly (21 October 1936 – 28 October 2006), was an English showbusiness entrepreneur. He was the managing director of Paul and Linda McCartney's MPL Communications, and then of Andrew Lloyd Webber's Really Useful Theatre Company. He was a co-founder of the radio stations Jazz FM and Classic FM. Brolly was born in London. His father, Tom Brolly, was born in Belfast but played football for Millwall FC and Crystal Palace FC, and played four times for Northern Ireland. Brolly was educated at St Dunstan's College, and did National Service in the Royal Ulster Rifles. He played rugby for London Irish, and worked in television from the 1957. He became a vice-president of MCA Television at the age of 26. He married his wife, Gillian, in 1963. He worked on the production of films including A Countess from Hong Kong (1967) — Charlie Chaplin's last film — and the BBC television drama series Colditz (1972–74). In 1969, Brolly encouraged Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice to develop their musical Jesus Christ Superstar (1972–80). Given the controversial topic, he encouraged them to release an album of the music first. The double album proved to be a great success, as was the musical when it opened on Broadway in 1971. He assisted Paul and Linda McCartney setting up MPL Communications in 1973, becoming its managing director. He also assisted them with the management of Wings, and produced records including Band on the Run and Mull of Kintyre. He left MPL Communications in 1978 to become managing director of Lloyd Webber's Really Useful Group. He also took a 30% interest in the company. At RUG, he developed the West End musicals Cats (1981–2002), Starlight Express (1984–92) and The Phantom of the Opera (1986–present, as of 2006), all of which have had extended runs on Broadway and elsewhere. He sold half of his interest when RUG was floated on the stock exchange in 1986. He left in 1988, by which time RUG was producing books, television and films. Brolly took an £800,000 payoff and received £14 million from Robert Maxwell for his remaining 14% stake. In addition to continuing to produce hit shows, such as The Importance of Being Earnest with Simon Callow, Brolly went on to start Jazz FM in 1990 and Classic FM in 1992, the latter in collaboration with GWR Group. He was also involved with the US leisure concept company LARC Inc, which designs theme parks such as Alton Towers. He set up a theatrical production firm called Producers Four with fellow entertainment mogul Michael Jenkins. In 2004, Producers Four launched the Broadway musical Brooklyn. He also invested in the Angelina Ballerina children's books and in Tim Waterstone's Daisy & Tom children's shops. He died of a heart attack on 28 October 2006. He was survived by his wife and their two sons."

  "text" : "James Alexander Bryan, known as Brother Bryan, (March 20, 1863, near Kingstree, South Carolina – January 28, 1941, in Birmingham, Alabama) was a well-loved pastor of Third Presbyterian Church in Birmingham, Alabama. Bryan came to Birmingham while he was still studying at Princeton University to serve as part-time pastor of Third Presbyterian Church. After graduating in 1889, he was ordained and installed as the full-time minister on August 4. As a minister, he conducted large evangelistic and prayer gatherings with various groups across the city and region. He was an outspoken supporter of civil rights and racial reconciliation in Birmingham. He is best remembered, however, for his tireless efforts to help the poor and homeless. It is said he would often arrive home at night without his overcoat because he had given it away to a stranger during the day. Though he was an ordained minister and honorary Doctor, he earned the title \"brother\" by addressing anyone he met as brother or sister. His life and ministry were recounted by author Hunter Blakely in the 1934 book Religion in Shoes. A 1934 statue of Brother Bryan kneeling in prayer by George Bridges is one of Birmingham's best-known landmarks, although it has been moved several times: From Five Points South to Vulcan Park and back to Five Points South. The \"Brother Bryan Mission\" was founded in 1940 to continue his work with the less fortunate. The City of Birmingham renamed Magnolia Park as \"Brother Bryan Park\". Bryan Memorial Presbyterian church in suburban Birmingham is also named in his honor. He was elected in 2002 to the Alabama Men's Hall of Fame."

He served as a Deputy U.S. Marshal in Oklahoma and was celebrated for capturing the outlaw Bill Doolin.

He died at the age of seventy, after being shot down on the streets of Cromwell, Oklahoma. The fame that Bill Tilghman did achieve was largely due to the efforts of his second wife, who wrote his biography in 1949."

Shimeliovich was arrested on January 13, 1949 for espionage. He was so severely beaten during the interrogations that he had to be carried on a stretcher into the court three years after. He was executed in August 1952 together with other members of JAC, which became known as the Night of the Murdered Poets. On November 22, 1955 (well after Joseph Stalin's death in 1953), military collegium of the Supreme Court of the Soviet Union withdrew the indictments against the JAC members due to the lack of evidence. Shimeliovich's Communist Party of the Soviet Union membership was restored only in 1988."

He was appointed by Governor Richard Riley in 1980 to the South Carolina Legislature Textile Study Commission, which he served on for many years. After he retired, Pittendreigh served as Industrialist in Residence at Clemson University's School of Textiles. Throughout the 1960s he served as a consultant with several developing nations in Africa in helping establish or modernize their textile industries. He was also highly involved in research. Pittendreigh frequently referred to the textile industry as \"humanity's oldest industry,\" referring to the biblical story of Adam and Eve's covering with fig leaves as evidence. However, Pittendreigh constantly argued that research in the field of textiles was lacking and continually called for companies to invest more in research and development. At the beginning of his career he was a minor participant in a project that helped develop parachutes using nylon rather than imported Japanese silk. He helped develop types of disposable diapers and held a patent on one such product."

  "text" : "Brian Lavelle (born 1972) is an experimental Scottish sound artist, born in Glasgow but now living in Edinburgh. He has been recording with varying degrees of intensity since around 1990. His recorded material could be described as resonant, textural layers of digital material, drones and processed field recordings. He has used the electric guitar in many of his recordings, often using it as a drone instrument or percussive accompaniment, rather than in a more traditional context. From 2000 to 2003, Lavelle curated the net label techNOH, which orchestrated more than thirty five releases by electronic composers from all over the world. He has recorded a number of albums with Richard Youngs, the Radios series: a ten album set of releases focussed on a particular set of sound sources, processes and the notion of chiasmus. Lavelle also recorded for a number of years, with fellow Glaswegian Alistair Crosbie, as Inversion. Very little of their material was released, but Lavelle has recently started to record again with Crosbie under their own names. His own record label, Dust, Unsettled, releases his own material as well as those of other like-minded musicians. Lavelle also maintains a website dedicated to the British writer of strange stories, Robert Aickman."

  "text" : "Beryl Drusilla de Zoete, also known as Beryl de Sélincourt (1879 in London – 4 March 1962) was an English ballet dancer, orientalist, dance critic, and dance researcher. She is also known as a translator of Italo Svevo. Born in London, she lived there for most of her life. In 1902 she married Basil de Sélincourt, though the marriage lasted for only a few years. She published poems in the modernist magazine The Open Window. She entered into a lifelong relationship with the Orientalist and translator Arthur Waley, whom she met in 1918 but never married. Her relationship with Arthur Waley was considered an indeterminate relationship in the eyes of observers such as Gerald Brenan. She traveled extensively, particularly in Bali and South Asia. In the field of dance, she taught eurhythmics, investigated Indian dance and theatre traditions, and collaborated with Walter Spies on Dance and Drama in Bali (1937), which is still a standard reference for traditional Balinese dance and theatrical forms. She studied dance, at least in part with Emile Jaques-Dalcroze in 1913 and 1915, and subsequently taught dance until sometime in the 1920s. She wrote on dance at various times for The Daily Telegraph, the New Statesman and Nation and Ballet (edited by Richard Buckle). She published books on dance in Bali (1938), India (1953) and Sri Lanka (1957). According to Harold Acton, she had a tendency to overstretch the hospitality of her friends: when Paola Olivetti, a little vexed, went away from one of her villas, Beryl stayed on; she left only when the cook told her he was going on vacation."

  "text" : "Bert Sas (1 August 1892 – 20 October 1948) was the Netherlands military attaché in Berlin at the time of the German invasion of the Netherlands in May 1940. Gijsbertus Jacobus (Bert) Sas was born in Leeuwarden. He was named after his father, a soldier who by his pension had reached the rank of Lieutenant Colonel. His mother Geertrui Huiber was 20 years younger than her husband. Bert was the youngest of 3 children, and attended a secondary school in Leeuwarden. In 1910 he went to the Koninklijke Militaire Academie in Breda. During World War I, in 1917, he was promoted to First Lieutenant and married Maria Johanna van der Minne. From 1923 until 1926 he followed the training for staff officier at the Hogere Krijgsschool. After this he obtained another staff function in The Hague. In 1928 he was promoted to the rank of Captain and became head of the most important bureau of the 2nd division where all of the important military questions were handled. However, during the period from 1928 until 1936, military expenditure was strictly limited. Between 1936 and 1937 he was the military attaché in Berlin for 10 days per month, spending the remaining 20 days in The Hague. He was then recalled to The Hague, where he functioned as the right-hand man of General Reijnders in the role of head of the operations division. In March 1939, following the German annexation of the Sudetenland, Reijnders sent him back to Berlin. This time he set up residence there with his wife Miep. In Berlin he immediately restored his friendship with the German colonel Hans Oster. Oster had obtained an important position as the right hand of Wilhelm Canaris at the German Abwehr, the espionage and counter-espionage service of the army. They were connected not only through their mutual dislike for the Nazi regime. Their friendship dated from the beginning of the 1930s, when they first met, possibly when Sas was working in The Hague. Oster passed him all important information that he obtained. He did not do this out of sympathy for Sas, but because he considered it his duty to Germany. He did not see himself as a traitor, but someone who did his duty to the decent Germany that he loved. At end of August 1939 he warned The Hague that a war with Poland was about to begin. He gave 25 August 1939 as the invasion date, but this date passed by. At 14:50 on that day Hitler gave the order for the invasion, but revoked it when he heard that England was not going to concede. Sas' credibility suffered. When he reported on 31 August that the war was now close, the head of intelligence, Van der Plassche did not believe him. Sas was the only one who delivered this report: London and Paris gave reassurance. However the Netherlands mobilised at the insistence of Queen Wilhelmina. General Reijnders, still his superior in The Hague, was positive over Sas' information. His relationship with General Reijnders remained good as long as the neutrality of Netherlands was not discussed. During September and October 1939, Sas obtained more signals that the neutrality of the Netherlands would not remain inviolate. Oster, during this time, assured him that only Belgium would be the target. However Sas did not believe this. At his insistence, Oster obtained further information from the German headquarters in Zossen. This showed that the suspicions that Sas now had were correct: the Netherlands would be invaded together with Belgium. The violation of neutrality would not be limited to a passage through southern Limburg into Belgium as had occurred in 1914. Sas died in the 1948 KLM Constellation air disaster in Scotland."

In the late 1970s Clouston established an office in Hong Kong which was managed by Alan Tate from which many large scale Landscape Design projects were completed, notably at Sha Tin Town Park. Additional offices were opened in Singapore, Kuala Lumpur and in Sydney. In the late 1980s the United Kingdom part of Clouston's company merged with RPS PLC, Clouston being Chairman until 1993.

  "text" : "Bruno Mattei (30 July 1931 – 21 May 2007) was an Italian film director, screenwriter and editor who gained a cult following for low-budget exploitation films in many genres, from women in prison (WIP) and nunsploitation to zombie and cannibal films; most of his films were meant to shock or sicken, and featured large doses of sex and gore. He used pseudonyms, including Vincent Dawn (chosen as a nod to George Romero's Dawn of the Dead), Pierre LeBlanc, Gilbert Roussel and Michael Cardoso among others."

  "text" : "Maria Belita Jepson-Turner (25 October 1923 – 18 December 2005), known professionally as Belita, was a British Olympic figure skater, dancer and film actress. Born at Nether Wallop, Hampshire, she skated (as Belita Jepson-Turner) for the United Kingdom in the 1936 Winter Olympics where she was placed 16th in the Ladies' singles competition, then her career turned towards Hollywood. She had classical Russian ballet training which carried over into her skating, and she was considered far superior to others skating at that time. As a young ballerina she was partner to Anton Dolin, appearing with the Dolin-Markova Ballet. She appeared in films including Never Let Me Go (1953) with Clark Gable and The Man on the Eiffel Tower (1949) opposite Charles Laughton. For a brief period she was Monogram Pictures highest paid star. She made several highly profitable productions for Monogram, including Silver Skates (1943), Lady, Let's Dance (1944), and the film noir Suspense (1946). In 1946 Belita married Joel McGinnis; they divorced in 1956. She remarried, to Irish actor James Berwick, né James Kenny (1929–2000). In 1956 she retired from skating and three years later gave up show business altogether. She appeared briefly on the ice at Madison Square Garden in New York City in 1981 in a short production based on \"Solitude\" by Duke Ellington. Both marriages were childless. She retired to live in Montpeyroux, Hérault, France, where she died in 2005, aged 82."

  "text" : "Butler Ames (August 22, 1871 – November 6, 1954) was an American politician, engineer, soldier and businessman. He was the son of Adelbert Ames and grandson of Benjamin Franklin Butler, both decorated generals in the Union Army during the American Civil War. Born in Lowell, Massachusetts, Ames attended the public schools and Phillips Exeter Academy, in Exeter, New Hampshire, and graduated from the United States Military Academy at West Point in 1894. He resigned from the United States Army after appointment as second lieutenant to the Eleventh Regiment, United States Infantry; took a postgraduate course at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, was a member of Theta Xi fraternity, and graduated in 1896 as a mechanical and electrical engineer. Ames engaged in manufacturing; served as a member of the common council of Lowell in 1896; like his father, he re-joined the Army during the Spanish–American War and was commissioned lieutenant and adjutant of the Sixth Regiment, Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry; appointed acting engineer officer of the Second Army Corps under General Graham, in addition to his duties as adjutant. He was promoted to lieutenant colonel in August 1898; served as civil administrator of the Arecibo district of Puerto Rico until November 1898. Ames became a member of the Massachusetts House of Representatives 1897–1899; elected as a Republican to the Fifty-eighth and to the four succeeding Congresses (March 4, 1903 – March 3, 1913); was not a candidate for renomination in 1912; resumed manufacturing pursuits; president of United States Cartridge Company, and treasurer of Heinze Electrical Co. of Lowell; at time of death was treasurer and a director of Wamesit Power Co. of Lowell, Massachusetts; director of Union Land and Grazing Co., Colorado Springs, Colorado, and vice president and a director of Ames Textile in Lowell. Ames was completely taken with Villa del Balbianello when he visited Europe for the first time in 1912, and he determined to purchase the Villa. He succeeded in 1919, beautifully restoring the Villa. On a Dictaphone Tape he tells the story (also a short autobiography). The Tape was transcribed, and his greater family published it in book form: \"Butler Ames and the Villa Balbianello, Lake Como, Italy, An American Oral History.\" Essays and introductions by Evelyn Ames, Pauline Ames Plimpton, Ezio Antonini, Sarah and George Plimpton plus period photographs and the illustrated Guest Book 1920 to 1970 was added. The book was edited by Oakes Plimpton and printed by Hobblebush Press, 2009, available through Amazon Books or Oakes Plimpton, 67 Coolidge Road, Arlington, MA 02476. Ames died in Tewksbury, Massachusetts in 1954, at the age of 83. He is buried, along with his father, grandfather and extended family, in the Hildreth family cemetery, behind the main cemetery on Hildreth Street in Lowell.  His heirs sold Villa del Balbianello in 1974 to Guido Monzino."

  "text" : "Bulent Rauf (Istanbul 1911 – Chisholme House, Roberton, Scottish Borders 1987) was a Turkish-British mystic, spiritual teacher, translator and author. From 1945 to the early sixties, he was married to Princess Faiza, sister of King Farouk of Egypt. Bulent Rauf dedicated many years of his life to teaching the Islamic concept of \"the one Absolute Unity of all existence\" (tawhid). Among other things, the British mystic and author Reshad Feild, who portrayed him as \"Hamid\" in his well-known book The Last Barrier, considered him to be his 'teacher'. However, Bulent Rauf himself emphasized the Islamic view that Muhammad was the final prophet, and that each person is taught directly by their own life with no intermediary. Rauf's chief literary work was the complete rendering into English of Ibn 'Arabi's Fusûs al-Hikam (The Bezels of Wisdom), incorporating the four volume Ottoman commentary attributed to Ismail Hakki Bursevi. Bulent Rauf was instrumental in founding the Beshara School for Esoteric Education in Scotland in 1975, which has been attended by hundreds of students from all over the world. He lived at Chisholme and Turkey from 1975 until his death and was a consultant to the school throughout that period. Bulent Rauf was the first president of the Muhyiddin Ibn Arabi Society, which is dedicated to making known the work of the Sufi mystic Ibn Arabi, and encouraged translation and publication of his writings. Rauf led the society until his death in 1987. The 2012 documentary In Search of Oil and Sand tells the story of Bulent Rauf's creation of the amateur movie Oil and Sand, together with members of the Egyptian royal family and their friends, in the weeks leading up to the Egyptian Revolution of 1952."

On 24 February 1547 Blomberg gave birth to John of Austria, who was almost immediately taken from her and sent to be raised in Spain. Shortly afterwards Blomberg married Hieronymus Kegel, an imperial official. In 1551 she moved to Brussels with her husband where Kegel was responsible for the equipment of the imperial mercenary army. They had three children. When Kegel died in 1569, Blomberg and her children were in reduced financial circumstances. At the request of the governor of the Netherlands, the Duke of Alba, she was granted a pension by King Philip II of Spain (her oldest son's agnate half-brother). In November 1576 Blomberg met her son John of Austria for the only time since his birth. Subsequently she went into a Dominican convent in Castile, 70 km south of Valladolid. After John of Austria died in 1578, Philip II allowed her to choose her own residence. She established herself first in the village of Colindres. In 1584 she purchased an estate in the village of Ambrosero in Cantabria. Blomberg died at the age of seventy at her estate in Ambrosero. She is buried in the Church of San Sebastian at the monastery of Montehano (also known as Convento San Sebastián de Hano es:Convento San Sebastián de Hano), between Ambrosero and Santoña."

Freundel was regarded as \"a brilliant scholar,\" a \"profound\" orator and an authority in several areas of halakha (Jewish law), including eruvim, which he assisted in constructing in a number of cities, including Washington. Freundel's career came to a sudden end when he was arrested by the Metropolitan Police Department of the District of Columbia and charged with voyeurism. Kesher Israel immediately suspended him without pay and later notified the congregants that he had been fired. Similarly, he was also suspended from membership in the Vaad and the Rabbinical Council of America (RCA), the main professional association for Modern Orthodox rabbis in the United States. He also was suspended from his multiple academic positions. He was assistant professor of rabbinics at Baltimore Hebrew University, where he was the rabbinic studies graduate program adviser, associate professor at Towson University and adjunct lecturer at the Georgetown University Law Center. Towson University immediately opened its own administrative review of Freundel's conduct with students, while Georgetown University began its own investigation as well. Freundel ultimately pleaded guilty to 52 counts of voyeurism and was sentenced to six-and-a-half years in prison and fined $13,000."

On 2 August 2003, he set the blind solo world land speed record on a motorbike with a speed of 164.87 mph (265.33 km/h). On August 17th 2013, Baxter lost his record to Stuart Gunn of Edinburgh, who managed a speed of 167.1 mph (268.92 km/h) at Elvington air strip. In 2004, he was a guest on the BBC television programme Top Gear and drove a lap of their circuit as the \"Star in a Reasonably Priced Car\", credited as the \"Blind Man\". He was guided around the circuit by the slightly nervous host, Jeremy Clarkson, and his official lap time was 2:02 minutes, which is faster than two of the fully sighted contestants (Terry Wogan and Richard Whiteley). Ex-Stig Ben Collins however stated in his autobiography that during practice sessions Baxter completed the lap in a time of 1:58 minutes. For the past few years, Baxter has been involved with various blind charities as a public speaker, educating groups of all ages about being blind as well as discussing his life experiences so far. He is currently enjoying life with full intensity, taking part in motorcycle riding, PSHE, learning to ski, and is now enjoying amateur dramatics. In 2007 he completed a Blind Solo Lap of Donington Park. \"My biggest challenge yet, I rode my Ducati Monster around the hallowed circuit of Donington, the home of motorcycle racing, raising awareness for Vista, a charity helping blind people in the Midlands, an amazing experience and great fun.\" Billy is a member and an employee of Blind Veterans UK In 2014 Billy Baxter was appointed the official Town Crier of Llandudno, North Wales by Llandudno Town Council."

  "text" : "Robert Thaves (October 5, 1924 – August 1, 2006) was the creator of the comic strip Frank and Ernest, which began in 1972. Thaves' desire to become a cartoonist began in his childhood. He had no formal training; instead, he practised by studying and drawing the works of other cartoonists. He was so skilled he could identify the cartoonist of a comic strip without looking at the signature. Robert Lee Thaves was born on October 5, 1924, in Burt, Iowa, where his father, John, published local newspapers. He attended the University of Minnesota, where he received both a bachelor's and master's degree in psychology. While still at university, the first of his cartoons were printed in magazines. He continued to be interested in cartooning, and developed the Frank and Ernest strip while working as an industrial psychologist. Frank and Ernest began appearing in magazines as early as the 1960s. It was first nationally syndicated November 6, 1972 and was eventually carried in 1,300 papers. It was the first single panel strip to appear in the \"panel\" format, and the first to use block letters for its dialogue. He also drew the short-lived King Baloo strip, which ran during the 1980s. Its format was identical to Frank and Ernest, but featured the titular King. His son Tom began collaborating with him on Frank and Ernest in 1997. The elder Thaves had planned on transitioning his son to take over the strip before his death. Bob Thaves died of respiratory failure in Torrance, California at the age of 81."

He left this party in late January 2006 after the rejection, by a judicial court, of his claim of having been elected as new national Secretary. Thus he founded a new movement, The Italian Socialists, of which he was the leader for a period. The party was part of the centre-left The Union, and eventually merged into the Socialist Party in 2007.

  "text" : "Barthel Beham (or Bartel) (1502–1540) was a German engraver, miniaturist and painter. The younger brother of Hans Sebald Beham, he was born into a family of artists in Nuremberg. Learning his art from his elder brother, and Albrecht Dürer, he was particularly active as an engraver during the 1520s, creating tiny works of magnificent detail, positioning him in the German printmaking school known as the \"Little Masters\". He was also fascinated with antiquity and may have worked with Marcantonio Raimondi in Bologna and Rome at some time in his career. In 1525, along with his brother and Georg Pencz, the so-called \"godless painters\", he was banished from Lutheran Nuremberg for asserting his disbelief in baptism, Christ, or transubstantiation. Although later pardoned, he moved to Catholic Munich to work for the Bavarian dukes William IV and Ludwig X. Whilst there, his exceptional talent established him as one of Germany's principal portrait painters, favoured by distinguished patrons such as Emperor Charles V. According to Joachim von Sandrart, he died in Italy during a trip under the patronage of Duke William."

His first match was between Australia and England at Melbourne on 29 December 1962 to 3 January 1963, won by England by 7 wickets. Smyth's partner in this match was Colin Egar. Smyth stood (again with Egar) in the first Test match played by Pakistan in Australia, at Melbourne on 4 December to 8 December 1964, a match drawn when Australia required only 78 further runs with 8 wickets in hand. This was Ian Chappell's debut match. Smyth's last match, also against England at Melbourne with Egar as his colleague, took place exactly three years after his first, on 30 December 1965 to 4 January 1966, resulting in a draw. He continued to umpire at lower levels until 1972. On retirement, Smyth became a long-term President of the Victorian Cricket Association Umpires' Association, adviser to the panel of VCA umpires, and lecturer on the Laws of Cricket, providing precise explanations of the complex code. He was awarded the Order of Australia in 2002 for his services to cricket. Smyth died in Melbourne at the age of 91."

  "text" : "William Henry \"Bill\" Hartley (26 October 1930 – 18 February 2006) was an Australian political activist who was State Secretary of the Victorian branch of the Australian Labor Party between 1965 and 1970. Hartley was born in Southern Cross, Western Australia and before his involvement in left-wing politics, he was a Young Liberal and was active in the University of Western Australia's Liberal Club. He also edited the student newspaper. Service in the RAAF in the early 1950s, combined with the Suez crisis and the Split in the Labor movement, radicalised Hartley and he joined the ALP in 1956. After this, he combined his journalism with his new politics, becoming co-editor of the ALP's WA newspaper, the Western Sun. Hartley lost his position as State Secretary when formal intervention in the Victorian branch by the Federal ALP Executive led to the replacement of the Victorian Central Executive of the Party in October 1970. He remained a leading figure within the Victorian ALP's Socialist Left faction until his expulsion in 1986. He was a radio broadcaster from 1978 to 1995 on community radio 3CR with an influential left-wing programme called Par Avion. He gained later public attention following his involvement with Gough Whitlam and David Combe in attempts to raise large sums of money for the Labor Party from the Iraqi Ba'ath Party (later led by Saddam Hussein) in 1975, and for his outspoken views on a variety of issues, particularly the Middle East conflict. Hartley died in Geraldton, Western Australia, aged 75."

  "text" : "Charles M. Van Artsdalen (January 31, 1941 – July 18, 1979) was a legendary surfer. He moved to La Jolla, California, from his birthplace of Norfolk, Virginia, at age 14. Van Artsdalen is best known as a pioneer of surfing 25-foot waves at such North Shore locations as Waimea Bay and Sunset Beach; and tube riding in Hawaii during the early 1960-1970s. A member of the Duke Kahanamoku Surf Team, he appeared in several surf movies and remained a fixture of the international surfing community until his death from alcohol-related illness in 1979. Van Artsdalen's athletic prowess was first noted in the years he attended La Jolla High School where he earned varsity letter in baseball, basketball, and football. He began surfing at the age of fourteen, and chose to continue in the sport because of its unstructured freedom when compared to the discipline of conventional professional sports. While in La Jolla, Van Artsdalen became part of a well-known surfing group at Windansea Beach. He moved to Hawaii after graduating high school to begin his professional career. The challenging waves of Oahu's North Shore soon became Van Artsdalen's home. He was among the first to master the powerful, hollow waves at Ehukai Beach known as the Banzai Pipeline. This, along with his reputation for riding switchfoot in the large surf at Waimea Bay, earned him the nickname \"Mr. Pipeline.\" Because of his talents, Van Artsdalen was featured in several early surf films by Dale Davis and Bruce Brown, the most notable of which was The Endless Summer. Van Artsdalen received onscreen credit in one of William Asher's \"surfploitation\" comedies, Muscle Beach Party, starring Frankie Avalon and Annette Funicello. He was recruited by artist and talent scout Michael Dormer to American International Pictures for auditions, but a violent temper precluded a film career. In 1964, Van Artsdalen was ranked among the world's best surfers by the Surfer Magazine Surfer Poll. A year later he was invited to join the Duke Kahanamoku Surf Team, becoming a global ambassador for wave riding and making appearances at shopping centers and promotional events. As surfing evolved during the late 1960s from heavier, more cumbersome longboards to lighter, shorter boards, Van Artsdalen's reputation was gradually eclipsed by a new generation of tube riders such as Gerry Lopez and Rory Russell. Still, he remained at Banzai Pipeline, working as a lifeguard in his later years. In 1969 Van Artsdalen won the 34th Annual Stone Steps Invitational Surf Contest at Stone Steps in Leucadia, California. Surfing had grown in popularity by that point, and Van Artsdalen felt the purity of the sport was being spoiled by posers. He frequently succumbed to binge drinking, and died of alcohol-related causes in 1979."

  "text" : "Barry Mitchell (born March 6, 1952) is a Brooklyn-born comedian, musician and TV producer. Mitchell is also known as \"Accordion Guy\" to viewers of ABC-TV's quirky, overnight broadcast, World News Now. Hestarted contributing topical song parodies to the program in 1992, and later became its roving feature reporter, conducting celebrity interviews andscouring the country for oddball stories and personalities. Mitchell played accordion in Long Island, NY wedding bands in the mid-1970s, and later worked as a radio newswriter for WHLI-AM. In the late 1970s he worked briefly for NBC Radio News and Information Service in Rockefeller Center before starting to earn a living as a stand-up comedian. In 1992, Mitchell wrote and performed what was to become World News Now's signature closing theme, the tongue-in-cheek \"World News Polka\". Many different versions of the Polka were created over the years, the most famous being the music video in which Mitchell was accompanied by two attractive female singers dressed in journalistic trenchcoats, who sang backup while waving large hand microphones, with many in-jokes acknowledging Disney's ownership of ABC. Other versions of Mitchell's Polka include one featuring an Elvis impersonator, another with an all-ukulele band, and onestarring a water-harpist. In June, 2015, Kermit The Frog of The Muppets sang a memorable Polka duet with Mitchell on accordion and Kermit on banjo: \"I hear they watch us in the Swamp and think that we're all right/Well, it sure beats croaking in the middle of the night.\" In the 1980s, Mitchell's uncanny impression of Woody Allen earned him parts in TV commercials and sketch work on Saturday Night Live and Late Night with Conan O'Brien. In between, he has written monologue material for The Tonight Show with Jay Leno and Wayne Cotter of Fox's Comic Strip Live. In 2004, he was part of the writing team for That Was The Week That Was, ABC's short-lived attempt to revive the 1963 BBC satire series as a segment of Primetime Live. Since May, 2005, Mitchell has worked as a producer/reporter for CUNY-TV, the public affairs cable channel of the City University of New York, available in the five boroughs of New York City on Channel 75 and online at cuny.tv."

  "text" : "Billy Reeves (born 7 June 1965) is a British songwriter, musician, record producer and broadcaster. In 1996 he formed the London-based indie-band Theaudience, (featuring Sophie Ellis-Bextor on vocals). Theaudience quickly established themselves in the Camden scene of '97. They scored two top 30 (UK) hits - 'A Pessimist Is Never Disappointed' and 'I Know Enough (I Don't Get Enough)' - and a top 20 (UK) eponymous album before Reeves left the band following a disastrous Glastonbury '98 performance. Prior to theaudience, Reeves had briefly been drummer for the bands Blow Up and The Grooveyard, and later formed indie band Congregation while working at the band's label Fire Records in the early 90s. Reeves signed to Sony Records with a new act ('Yours') in 1999. He also ran the club ('Uncle Bob's Wedding Reception') which provided The Darkness with their first London show. Around this time he also had a brief stint in Los Angeles producing new artist demos for Rondor Publishing. His performing career was interrupted by injuries sustained in a near-fatal car accident in 2001, although he returned to live music from 2006 with the short-lived pop band Friends of the Bride, among other projects. After recovering from his accident Reeves studied under the noted writer and journalist Chris Horrie at the University of Westminster. Reeves achieved a distinction in his post graduate degree under Horrie and was therefore able to reinvent himself as a radio producer and broadcaster on BBC London 94.9. His travel and sports reports are distinctive due to an eccentric delivery which his friend Danny Baker has compared to the late Cyril Fletcher. He produced the 2005 Sony Award-winning Charlie Gillett Show (which featured Mavis Staples) and as part of the BBC London Travel Team has won two Frank Gillard Awards - in 2009 and 2011. The team was nominated for the 2011 Sony in the 'Multiplatform' category (for coverage of the Tube Strike) and commended in the 2011 Online Media Awards in the 'Twitter feed of the year' category. Outside of the BBC he presents a monthly podcast for Kscope Records, the forefront of the uniquely British 'post-progressive' rock scene. Reeves has also turned his hand to sports commentary for BBC Radio. He lends an eloquence to reports from Brentford FC, and commentates live on the club's website 'Bees Player' - as well as writing a column in the match-day programme."

Her report to Eisenhower on the unfitness of American children as compared with their European counterparts led to the formation of the President’s Council on Youth Fitness. Prudden authored 16 books on physical fitness and Myotherapy for all ages and abilities including two best sellers, How to Keep Slender and Fit After Thirty (1961) and Pain Erasure: The Bonnie Prudden Way (1980). She produced six exercise albums, hosted the first regular exercise spots on national television, had a syndicated television show, and wrote a column for Sports Illustrated. Schools, prisons, summer camps, factories, hospitals, clubs, YMCAs, universities, geriatric homes and facilities for the physically and emotionally challenged all used and benefited from the many physical fitness programs she provided for them. Prudden also designed the first fitness fashions and developed numerous pieces of exercise equipment that could be built in the average garage and used by the family. Prudden developed Bonnie Prudden Myotherapy. \"A method of relaxing muscle spasm, improving circulation, and alleviating pain. Pressure is applied, using elbows, knuckles, or fingers, and held for several seconds to defuse \"trigger points.\" The success of this method depends upon the use of specific corrective exercises of the freed muscles. The method was developed by Bonnie Prudden in 1976.\""

He was born at Alawanydajawany on the East Alligator River around 1920 into the Bunitj clan of the Gagudju people. His father was Nadampala and his mother was Lucy Wirlmaka, from the Ulbuk clan of the Amurdak people. He grew up leading a traditional lifestyle in the East Alligator region, and was taught by his father, his grandfather, and others how to hunt and manage his environment. From about the age of 20 he worked first with buffalo hunters, then at a timber mill, and then on board a lugger transporting people and goods along the North Coast of the Northern Territory and to remote island communities. He was initiated at a ceremony at Ubirr in the early 1940s. During the Second World War he helped in the defence of Australia, working at the radar station at Cape Don. He was in Darwin during the Japanese bombings in 1942 and helped Aboriginal people during and after the devastation. Big Bill was instrumental in the decision to lease his traditional lands to the Commonwealth of Australia so that it could be managed as a wild area and as a resource to be shared by all Australians. After helping establish Kakadu as a National Park in 1979, he returned there to commit the rest of his life to supporting the joint management of the Park. Kakadu continues to be governed by a board with a majority of indigenous Australians. In 1988, Kakadu was featured in the February issue of The National Geographic Magazine, and was the focus of the National Geographic television documentary entitled Twilight Of The Dreamtime, in which Big Bill figured prominently. His son, Jonathan Yarramarrna appeared with him and parts of the film dealt with the future of Kakadu and specifically with Big Bill's preparation for Jonathan to assume the custodianship of his family's tribal lands. In 1989 he was awarded the Order of Australia for his services to conservation. In many indigenous Australian cultures, there are traditional secrets passed down from generation to generation, and it is taboo to reveal these secrets to a non-initiate. As he grew older, Bill Neidjie realised that he might be in the position, as one of the last Gagudju initiates, of taking these secrets to the grave with him, and so made the courageous decision to break this taboo, so that his culture might live on. In addition to entrusting some of the custodianship of tribal lands to his son Jonathan, he related many of his stories to the anthropologist Stephen Davis and others, and published two books, in which he related his passion for the land of which he was part, and insisted on the importance of managing the land in the traditional ways. He hoped that, one day, his culture might thrive once again, and his grandchildren, or their grandchildren, might pick up the threads once more. Bill Neidjie died on 23 May 2002. The Federal Minister for the Environment and Heritage, David Kemp, said, \"He was instrumental in the establishment of Kakadu National Park and was deeply committed to sharing his love for his country, his respect for the heritage of his country and his indigenous culture with countless thousands of park visitors and all who shared his love for the natural world.\""

According to Dattatreya's critics, his letter to the Education Minister, complaining about degraded student politics, had led to Vemula's suspension and ultimate suicide. Vemula's suicide letter did not blame anyone, and Dattatreya denied these allegations."

  "text" : "Barry Austin  (born 1968), of Solihull, West Midlands, England is a man widely reputed to be the heaviest man in the United Kingdom. Multiple press reports claim that at his peak weight, he weighed 50 stone (around 700 lbs or 320 kg). Austin's appearances in the press and on television are usually related to current concerns about an alarming increase in obesity among the population. He has thus been asked to comment on news and current affairs strands such as the BBC's Breakfast News. Austin has also been the star of a Sky One documentary, Inside Britain's Fattest Man, presented by fellow Silhillian Richard Hammond in the manner of the science fiction film Fantastic Voyage. According to the programme, Austin typically consumed in excess of 29,000 calories a day – over ten times the average daily intake for a UK male, and has major health problems as a result of his morbid obesity. He also claimed to drink up to 40 pints on a night out. A previous documentary on Britain's heaviest men – The Fattest Men in Britain – which saw Austin take the crown, though he was notably lighter and more mobile at the time, reported that he led an actively social life and was something of a celebrity on the Birmingham club circuit, and a very visible supporter of Birmingham City F.C. at their home games. However, he was unable to attend their victorious Wembley Stadium appearance on 27 February 2011, when they lifted the Football League Cup with a 2–1 win over Arsenal in the final as he was too big to get a seat. By this stage he weighed 40 stone. According to both documentaries, Austin's greatest problem is his legs (which have notably reduced his mobility in the latter programme). Starved of blood because of their enormous size and distance from his heart, they cause him to suffer regular terrible bacterial infections that leave him swollen and in agony, immobile at home. In September 2005, Austin committed himself to losing weight, restricting his daily intake to a mere 1,500 calories in a bid to save his life. In November 2009 it was reported that Austin currently weighed 40 stone and was starting a new diet plan to try to lose at least 10 stone. The report also gave his peak weight as 65 stone. In December 2009 Austin played 'Big Brian' in ITV1's comedy-drama The Fattest Man in Britain starring Timothy Spall and Bobby Ball. In February 2012 it was confirmed that Barry would be getting married to long term partner of 13 years Debbie Kirby."

  "text" : "William C Speidel (1912–1988), known as Bill Speidel, was a columnist for The Seattle Times and a self-made historian who wrote the books Sons of the Profits and Doc Maynard, The Man Who Invented Seattle about the people who settled and built Seattle, Washington. Speidel is also credited with being one of the leaders of the movement to preserve and restore Pioneer Square, one of Seattle's oldest neighborhoods. By the 1960s, this area was run down and in disrepair, in danger of being demolished and rebuilt. Through the efforts of many people, Pioneer Square is once again a bustling center of activity and tourism with dozens of original buildings that have been restored to their original luster. In 1964, Speidel received and printed a letter from a reader asking about the underground areas of Pioneer Square. He replied via the paper that he did not know much about it, but that he would research it and get back to her. Once he did the research, he printed a response telling her to meet him at 3 p.m. the next Saturday in Pioneer Square, and he would take her on a tour of the underground and what he had found. The reader did show up, along with 500 other people. Speidel quickly took up a collection of $1 from each of the visitors and proceeded on the first tour of the Seattle Underground. Since Memorial Day weekend 1965, the Underground Tour has given several tours a day every day except holidays and is one of the city's best known tourist attractions. As a Seattle historian, Speidel was something of a revisionist and the narration of the Underground Tour reflects that. Doc Maynard, whom Speidel called \"The Man Who Invented Seattle\", was given short shrift in what Speidel characterized as the \"Party Line\" on the city's history, in part because the longer-lived Arthur Denny was so influential on the writing of that history. Jacob Furth, whom Speidel wrote \"may even have been the most important citizen Seattle ever had\" was highly lauded at the time of his death in 1914, but later became, in Speidel's words, \"a neglected giant\", with \"scant mention in our history books\" and \"no streets, statues, parks or public buildings to honor him.\" Speidel also made claims for brothel-owner Lou Graham as a key figure in the growth of the city."

  "text" : "Bernard W. \"Bernie\" Bierman (March 11, 1894 – March 7, 1977) was an American football player and coach of football and basketball. He coached from 1919 to 1950 except for a span during World War II when he served in the U.S. armed forces. Bierman was the head coach at the University of Montana (1919–1921), Mississippi State University (1925–1926), Tulane University (1927–1931), and his alma mater, the University of Minnesota (1932–1941, 1945–1950), compiling a career college football record of 153–65–12. At Minnesota, Bierman's Golden Gophers compiled a 93–35–6 record, won five national championships and seven Big Ten Conference titles, and completed five undefeated seasons. Bierman was also the head basketball coach at Montana (1919–1922), Mississippi State (1925–1927), and Tulane (1928–1930), tallying a career college basketball mark of 89–51."

  "text" : "Ewart Bryon Butler (5 June 1934 – 26 April 2001) was an English writer and broadcaster, best known as the BBC's football correspondent from 1968 to 1991. He was born in Taunton, Somerset and educated at Taunton School. After working for a number of regional newspapers, he joined the News Chronicle shortly before its closure in 1960, soon moving to The Daily Telegraph. Around this time, he also started reporting football matches for the BBC, and in 1968 became a radio commentator and the Corporation's football correspondent. He was well known for his crisp, eloquent, precise style, with a distinctive West Country undertone to his voice. Although he often did not actually commentate on the very big occasions, frequently taking a side role as summariser (in earlier years) or presenter or reporter (in later years), he commentated on a number of World Cup finals, as well as the famous quarter-final between England and Argentina in 1986. He frequently worked alongside Maurice Edelston, Peter Jones, Alan Parry and, latterly, Alan Green and Mike Ingham. Alongside his football writing, Butler also wrote for the Daily Telegraph on cricket. He wrote or co-wrote a number of football books, and in 1991 he retired as the BBC's football correspondent to concentrate on his writing career. He also gave up commentary around this time, but continued to report matches for BBC Radio 5 Live until 1997 and present the late-night programme for the station until 2000. He also presented Sport on 4 on BBC Radio 4. On his death in 2001, he was widely mourned as a representative of a bygone era of sports broadcasting, arguably less brash and more eloquent than the present."

He was working as a freelance writer for various women's magazines when, in 1973, he published a book named \"ノストラダムスの大予言\" (Nostradamus no daiyogen; \"The Prophecies of Nostradamus\"), which introduced Nostradamus and his prophecies to a mainstream Japanese audience for the first time. He focuses particularly on a quatrain appearing to predict a catastrophe occurring in 1999. Against a backdrop of anxiety following the 1973 oil crisis, the work became a runaway bestseller and sparked a 'Nostradamus boom' in Japanese publishing."

  "text" : "William Robert \"Bob\" Boyd (June 7, 1930 – January 14, 2015) was an American collegiate men's basketball coach who was head coach at Seattle University, the University of Southern California (USC) and Mississippi State University. Boyd had a long association with the University of Southern California's men's basketball, first as a player and then as its head coach. The 3-year letterman (1950–52) was USC's most valuable player as a senior in 1952. Boyd then began his coaching career, first for five years in the high school ranks (at El Segundo, California and Alhambra, California), then for six years at the junior college level at Santa Ana College (his 1959 team finished second at the state tournament) and then collegiately, first at Seattle University, where Boyd went 41-13 in 2 seasons (1964–65). After a year out of coaching while working for Converse athletic shoes, Boyd embarked on a 13-year career (1967–79) as head coach of the USC basketball team. Boyd's teams went 216-131 overall and played in the post-season four times (the 1979 NCAA playoffs, 1973 NIT and 1974 and 1975 Commissioner's Conference tourney). Boyd's 1971 team, which went 24-2 and was ranked fifth in the nation (USC was ranked first at midseason), is regarded among USC's best (Boyd also won 24 games in 1974). Boyd's wins over UCLA in 1969 and 1970 were the UCLA's first losses in Pauley Pavilion, built in 1966. Boyd was twice named the conference Coach of the Year. Boyd sent ten players into the NBA, including Paul Westphal and Gus Williams. After USC, Boyd went on to be the head coach at Mississippi State University (1982–86), Riverside Community College (1989) and Chapman University (1990–92), and then was an assistant at LSU and Utah State University. Boyd was a member of the University of Southern California's Athletic Hall of Fame and the Pac-12 Conference Men's Basketball Hall of Honor. Boyd died of natural causes in Palm Desert, California on January 14, 2015 aged 84. \"Boyd labored quietly and effectively for the Trojans — much more effectively than most people realize,\" wrote Steve Bisheff. \"The truth is, Boyd was the best USC basketball coach of the modern era, if not any era... The only thing wrong was his timing. He just happened to coach in the same town, at the same time, as a college basketball icon."

Naoyuki served Lord Katō as a gunnery commander (teppō-taishō). Naoyuki followed his lord during the invasion of Korea in the 1590s, and for his actions in combat there he was given a stipend of 350 koku. However, at the Battle of Sekigahara in 1600, he opposed Yoshiaki's orders and subsequently left his service. After that, he served several lords, including Kobayakawa Hideaki, Matsudaira Tadayoshi, and Fukushima Masanori; however, as his former lord Yoshiaki was a hindrance, Naoyuki entered the priesthood for a time. He served the Toyotomi clan at the Osaka Winter Campaign in 1614. However, during the next year's Summer Campaign, he was killed in action fighting Asano Nagaakira's forces in Izumi province."

  "text" : "Bernard Grebanier (March 8, 1903 – March 1977) was an American drama historian, critic, writer and poet, most notable for his studies of the works of William Shakespeare. Grebanier was a professor of English at Brooklyn College from 1926 until 1964. In 1941 he was quoted in evidence presented to the Supreme Court of the United States denouncing a former associate professor as a Communist during the professor's appeal against dismissal from his position. Grebanier was friendly with other drama critics in the greater New York City but perhaps none was a better friend than New York Evening Post editor and chief drama critic Joseph Cookman. When Cookman died in 1944, the Post selected Grebanier's tribute to run in the paper among the dozens of tributes sent in. Grebanier was Brooklyn College's most popular professor between the end of World War II and his retirement in 1965. His Shakespeare classes enrolled hundreds of students every semester. His method of teaching involved a line-by-line reading of Shakespeare's plays, interspersed with commentary on art, politics, and human psychology. Most influential of his books are \"The Heart of Hamlet,\" \"The Truth About Shylock,\" and \"Playwriting\": In these he 1) characterizes Hamlet as misunderstood by critics, as the hero is neither passive, delaying, crazy, or acting crazy, but rather a Renaissance man who tackles the difficult task of proving Claudius guilty and then proceeds to exact revenge; 2) maintains that Shakespeare does not pursue the question of anti-Semitism in \"The Merchant of Venice\" but rather uses the stereotype of the Jewish moneylender to ask critical questions about cold-hearted bankers and human compassion; 3) establishes fundamental concepts in the structure of drama that still prevail in creative writing courses across the country.Among his published works are : \n* The Uninhibited Byron (1970) \n* Barron's Simplified Approach to Chaucer \n* \"An Introduction to Imaginative Literature\" (with Seynour Reiter) (1960) \n* The Heart of Hamlet (1960) \n* Playwrighting: How to Write for the Theatre (1961) \n* The Truth About Shylock (1962) \n* \"The Great Shakespeare Forgery\" (1965) \n* Then Came Each Actor (1975) \n* Last Harvest: Poems of Bernard Grebanier (1980)"

  "text" : "Brandon C. Rodegeb, better known as B-12 (born on October 9, 1977) is a music executive, film maker, and rap artist. Brandon was born in San Francisco, CA at San Francisco General Hospital and raised in Hunter's Point, SF. Living in an area rich in cultural and hip-hop history gave Brandon access to hip-hop music at an early age. The youngest son of a single mother with two brothers (one murdered in 1994) and a sister, Brandon was interested in music when very young. Growing up around such rap legends as Too Short, 11/5, RBL Posse, and others, B-12 was able to get into music early. Success followed, although not immediately, and his family later moved to the nearby suburb of Vallejo, California in 1991. In 2001 B-12, Fidel Castro & Say-So formed the group Riderlife and released the album Neva Look Back. The album featured several west coast artists including: MC Eiht, Celly Cel, Taydatay, 11/5, Young Droop, San Quinn, Luni Coleone, M.O.G., Jay Tee, Boo-Yaa T.R.I.B.E., Skee 64, Young Dru, Da' Unda' Dogg and also Eightball, who is from Memphis, Tennessee. In 2002 B-12, Jay Tee & Young Dru formed the group Free Agents and released the album Negotiations on 40 Ounce Records. The project is described as \"a loosely knit group of 'rap comrades' who came together to make a statement about independence and ownership in a turbulent time in the music industry.\""

She is also regarded as the only Catholic ruler in India, as she ruled the Principality of Sardhana in 18th and 19th century India. She died immensely rich. Her inheritance was assessed as approximately 55.5 million gold marks in 1923 and 18 billion deutsch marks in 1953. Her inheritance continues to be disputed to this day. An organisation named \"Reinhards Erbengemeinschaft\" still strives to resolve the inheritance issue. During her lifetime she had converted to Christianity from Islam."

She was born the daughter of Russian émigrés who left Czarist Russia around 1905. Born and raised in Montreal, Quebec, she was the founder of CANFAR, the Canadian Foundation for AIDS Research. Bluma married the Montreal chartered accountant Bram Appel on July 11, 1940. It was Bram's subsequent success in business which afforded Bluma the opportunity to engage in serious philanthropic activity: in 1946 he co-founded Pall Corporation. In 1979, she ran unsuccessfully as a Liberal candidate for the Canadian House of Commons in the riding of Nepean—Carleton. She lost to Walter Baker. She was a major supporter of the St. Lawrence Centre for the Arts, which named one of its theatres in her honour in March 1983 after she made a donation to help renovate the 876-seat theatre where the Canadian Stage Company (CanStage) performs. She was also a significant force behind Opera Atelier. In June 2005, the Toronto Alliance for the Performing Arts gave Ms. Appel an honorary Dora Mavor Moore Award \"for her exceptional and lifelong dedication\" to the performing arts in Canada. She is memorialized at The Canadian Stage Company's Bluma Appel Theatre in perpetuity. Four days after celebrating her 67th wedding anniversary, Appel lost her brief battle with lung cancer and died in a hospital in Toronto, aged 86. She was buried at Pardes Shalom Cemetery, north of Toronto. Bram Appel died October 8, 2007. They are survived by their two sons David (born 1941) and Mark (born 1944), and five grandchildren."

  "text" : "Austin Dean \"Bud\" Brisbois (April 11, 1937 – June 1978) was a jazz and studio trumpet player. He played all styles, including big band lead, jazz soloing, pop, rock, country, Motown, and classical, but it was his high-note playing that set him apart. At his peak he was one of the most accurate and consistent of all high-note trumpeters, and his range has never been equaled. Brisbois was born in Edina, Minnesota and began studying the trumpet at age 12. He was mainly self-taught, and reportedly had most of his range before leaving high school. He briefly attended University of Minnesota before moving to Los Angeles, where he would live most of his life, when not touring. In September 1958 he joined Stan Kenton's orchestra, where he took over the \"scream\" parts written for Maynard Ferguson, in addition to playing much of the lead trumpet. Brisbois toured with Kenton's band until the early 60's, recording over 30 albums. Around 1963 he left Kenton to work in the Los Angeles recording studios. Brisbois worked as a studio musician in L.A. from around 1963 to 1975, recording over a hundred albums. Some of the performers he recorded with are:Herb Alpert, Tony Bennett, The Chicago Symphony Orchestra, Rosemary Clooney, Nat King Cole, Bobby Darin, Neil Diamond, Duke Ellington, The 5th Dimension, The Four Freshmen, Lionel Hampton, Herbie Hancock, Harry James, Stan Kenton, Henry Mancini, Dean Martin, Onzy Matthews, Billy May, The Monkees, Bonnie Raitt, Lou Rawls, Lalo Schifrin, Bud Shank, Frank Sinatra, Nancy Sinatra, and Nancy Wilson.In addition, he played lead trumpet on the theme songs to Hawaii Five-O and The Jetsons. In early 1973 Brisbois formed the rock group Butane, featuring himself as singer and trumpeter. They recorded a demo and played regular gigs over the next two years, at one point performing on the hit television show The Midnight Special, but never secured a record contract and eventually disbanded. In 1975 following the breakup of his second marriage, Brisbois began having increasing problems controlling his manic depression, from which he had suffered all his life. He quit the music business entirely and moved to Beverly Hills, where for a time he worked as a Porsche salesman. In 1976 or 1977, he moved to Scottsdale, Arizona to be near his sister. Eventually he began playing again. When asked what inspired him, he replied, \"I was driving down a freeway in LA and heard Claus Ogerman's Gate of Dreams album.\" Brisbois began teaching privately and worked closely with the late Grant Wolf and the Mesa Community College Jazz Band. In addition, he coached the trumpets of the Musicians Union sponsored Young Sounds band. He performed in various bands in the Phoenix area. In late May or early June 1978, Bud appeared as a guest with the jazz-rock group \"Matrix\" and commented \"I played as well as I have ever played.\" Less than a week later, he committed suicide."

  "text" : "George \"Buzz\" Westfall (March 19, 1944 – October 27, 2003) was an American lawyer and politician. He served in the elected offices of Prosecuting Attorney (1978–1990) and County Executive (1991–2003) of St. Louis County, Missouri. He died, while in office, of Staphylococcus aureus meningitis at the age of 59. Westfall grew up in public housing in St. Louis. He attended St. Louis University High School and graduated from Saint Louis University with his BA and JD degrees. After completing law school, he took a position in the St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney's office as an assistant prosecutor. In 1978, Westfall was elected as head Prosecuting Attorney for St. Louis County. Westfall was re-elected in 1982 and 1986 without opposition. In 1990, Westfall was the Democratic nominee for the County Executive's position, and he defeated incumbent H.C. Milford in his bid for re-election. Westfall was re-elected County Executive in 1994, 1998, and 2002. In October 2003, less than a year into his new term of office, Westfall died after developing a meningitis staph infection. County councilman Charlie Dooley was appointed to fill the remainder of his term. Westfall was survived by his wife and three grown children. Following Westfall's death, his friends and family established a charitable enterprise, the Buzz Westfall Memorial Fund, in his honor. The Memorial Fund, now known as the Buzz Westfall Charitable Foundation, is a non-profit enterprise established to further Westfall's legacy of bettering the community through charitable works. The Foundation raises funds via an annual golf tournament, among other various events. Westfall Lane, a street in Jennings, Missouri, was dedicated to the memory of Mr. Westfall in early 2004. In 2006, the Buzz Westfall Plaza On The Boulevard opened for business, anchored by a new Schnucks supermarket and Target, on the site of the deteriorating Northland Shopping Center in Jennings. Other memorials include the Buzz Westfall Justice Center in Clayton, Missouri, and the Buzz Westfall Memorial Highway, a portion of Highway 364 in St. Louis County. Westfall served a total of 35 years in St. Louis County government, including 24 years in elected office. He left behind a legacy of public service and betterment of the community that he loved."

  "text" : "Benedict Mason, born on 23 February 1954, is a British composer. Mason was educated at King's College Cambridge (1971–75) and took a degree in film-making at the Royal College of Art (1975–78). He did not turn to composition until his early 30s, but his first acknowledged work, Hinterstoisser Traverse (1986), attracted attention from the European new music scene (Toop 2001). His early works are decidedly postmodern in inclination, with considerable use of stylistic irony (some commentators have noted in these works a similarity to the music of Mauricio Kagel). Mason then developed an interest in polyrhythmic music, and in works such as his Double Concerto one can hear a strong stylistic affinity to the later works of György Ligeti (Toop 2001). More recent works have concentrated on the spatial dimension of music, such as in his Music for European Concert Halls series, and sometimes have come very close to installation art. Mason has composed in many genres, and his soccer opera Playing Away, with a libretto by Howard Brenton, was commissioned by the Munich Biennale and premièred there in 1994 by Opera North."

His interest grew after a computer worm locked him out of his own computer in 2001. Krebs is the author of a daily blog, KrebsOnSecurity.com, covering computer security and cybercrime. From 1995 to 2009, Krebs was a reporter for The Washington Post and covered tech policy, privacy and computer security as well as authoring the Security Fix blog. He is also known for interviewing hacker 0x80. On March 14, 2013, Krebs became one of the first journalists to become a victim of swatting. On December 18, 2013, Krebs broke the story that Target Corporation had been breached of 40 million credit cards. Six days later Krebs identified a Ukrainian man who Krebs said was behind a primary black market site selling Target customers' credit and debit card information for as much as US$100 apiece. In 2014, Krebs published a book called Spam Nation: The Inside Story of Organized Cybercrime - from Global Epidemic to Your Front Door, which went on to win a 2015 PROSE Award."

The son of Henry Cunnington, a wine merchant, Benjamin was a journalist before joining his father's business. He was also for sixty years also the unpaid honorary curator of Devizes Museum. In 1889 he married Maud Pegge and the two devoted their lives to archaeology. They had one son, Edward, who was killed in the First World War. The Cunningtons carried out excavations at some of the most important sites in British archaeology. These included the first known Neolithic causewayed enclosure at Knap Hil, the Iron age village at All Cannings Cross, West Kennet Long Barrow, Woodhenge, (which they named) and The Sanctuary. This last monument they rediscovered as it had been lost since William Stukeley saw it in the eighteenth century. Woodhenge and The Sanctuary were bought by the Cunningtons and given to the nation. He died a few months before his wife, who was suffering from Alzheimer's disease."

  "text" : "Billy Ray Hamilton (a.k.a. \"Country\") (1950–October 22, 2007) was an American convicted murderer who conspired with Clarence Ray Allen to murder eight witnesses to a crime committed by Allen in 1974. Hamilton met Allen in Folsom Prison in 1979. Allen befriended Hamilton and allegedly offered to pay him $25,000 to carry out the murders. At Folsom Prison, Allen used to refer to Hamilton as his \"good dog\", though at the time of Allen's trial, he claimed to only have met Hamilton three or four times. After Hamilton was paroled from Folsom Prison, Kenneth Allen, one of Allen's sons supplied Hamilton with $100. Hamilton and his girlfriend Connie Barbo went to Fran’s Market in Fresno, California where one of the witnesses, Bryon Schletewitz worked. On September 5, 1980, Hamilton murdered Schletewitz and fellow employees Josephine Rocha, 17, and Douglas White, 18, with a sawn-off shotgun and wounded two other people, Joe Rios and Jack Abbott. Hamilton shot Schletewitz at near point-blank range in the forehead and murdered Rocha and White after forcing them to lie on the ground within the store. A neighbor, Jack Abbott, who heard the shotgun blasts came to investigate and was shot by Hamilton. Abbott returned fire and wounded Hamilton, who escaped from the scene. Five days after the events at Fran's Market, Hamilton was arrested shortly after robbing a liquor store in Modesto, California. Hamilton carried a list with the names and addresses of the witnesses who testified against Allen at the Kitts trial, including the name of Schletewitz. Hamilton was tried in Contra Costa County, California. The jury convicted Hamilton of three counts of murder, one count of attempted robbery and two counts of assault with a deadly weapon. As special circumstances making Hamilton eligible for the death penalty, the jury found that Hamilton had committed murder-robbery, and multiple murders predicated on the killing of other victims. The jury returned a unanimous verdict of death, and the Contra Costa County Superior Court sentenced Hamilton on March 2, 1981. Hamilton was on death row at the San Quentin State Prison in California where he died of natural causes on October 22, 2007 at the age of 57."

  "text" : "Frank Joseph James \"Budd\" Lynch (August 7, 1917 – October 9, 2012) was the Detroit Red Wings' public address announcer at Joe Louis Arena, a position he held from 1985 to 2012. He began his career in 1949 as the team's radio play-by-play announcer. Lynch had been with the Windsor Spitfires when Red Wings' general manager Jack Adams asked him to call the games for his organization. A native of Windsor, Ontario, Lynch joined the Essex Scottish Regiment of the Canadian Army during World War II; he lost his right arm during combat. Returning home from the war, he joined the Red Wings, with the team winning the Stanley Cup during his first season. Detroit won the Stanley Cup four times during his first five years with the club. He attempted a retirement in 1975, but was brought back to the team by Alex Delvecchio as the Director of Publicity. A second retirement attempt in 1985 failed when Marian Ilitch asked Lynch to stay on as public address announcer. His style as public address announcer was \"simply relaying information to the crowd, not to act as a cheerleader.\" He often regarded Gordie Howe as the greatest player he has ever seen. In 1985, he was the recipient of the Foster Hewitt Memorial Award, presented in recognition of members of the radio and television industry who made outstanding contributions to their profession and the game during their career in hockey broadcasting as selected by the NHL Broadcasters' Association. In 1994, Lynch was inducted into the Michigan Sports Hall of Fame. In 2005, Lynch was the recipient of the Ty Tyson Excellence in Sports Broadcasting Award awarded by the Detroit Sports Broadcasters Association. Lynch is a two-time Past President of the DSBA and an honorary lifetime member. Starting in fall 2008, he was joined on the PA at Joe Louis Arena by a second PA announcer: first with John Fossen, and later with Erich Freiny, who is now his successor. On November 5, 2009, Lynch was honored at Joe Louis Arena for the 60th anniversary of his first play-by-play television broadcast of a Red Wings game. After the ceremony, the Red Wings prevailed 2–1 over the San Jose Sharks in a shootout, and fans received Budd Lynch bobbleheads to celebrate the occasion. Lynch was the longest-tenured employee in Red Wings history. He lived in Wyandotte, Michigan, until his death on October 9, 2012. He was 95 years old. His is a voice so honored by fans, players and ownership alike, that a recording of Lynch's voice will continue to announce, \"Last minute of play in this period\" for each home game."

She made her opera debut in 1876 at the Royal Italian Opera House, Covent Garden, becoming the first American woman to sing Italian opera there. She went on to sing in concerts in Europe, having worked as a journalist from Paris in 1875. In 1879, she joined the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company and played the role of Josephine in Gilbert and Sullivan's H.M.S. Pinafore in London before travelling with the company to New York City to play the same role and to originate the role of Mabel in The Pirates of Penzance. Later in 1880, she co-founded, produced and starred in a new opera company, but this venture soon folded, and Roosevelt retired from the stage. She and her husband, the Marquis d'Alligri, returned to Europe by 1882 and she pursued a career in journalism and literature, writing biographies and novels. She became the mistress of Guy de Maupassant."

In addition to his weekly reviews, Mondello produces frequent commentaries and reported pieces on the arts, among them \"American Stages\" (2005) an eight-part NPR series exploring the history, reach and accomplishments of the regional theater movement, numerous pieces on silent films – a bit of a trick on radio – and cultural features he has produced from Argentina. Mondello also originated the \"Mondello Rule for Quickly Judging Films.\" The rule states that the fewer words you need to summarize a film, the worse it is.

Born in Beaufort, North Carolina, Taylor attended East Carteret High School, where his pitching ability caused him to be chosen by the New York Yankees with the first overall selection in the 1991 Major League Baseball Draft. After two full seasons in the minor leagues, he injured his shoulder in a fight, and was ineffective after returning to baseball. He retired in 2000, having never played a game above Class AA. Taylor was the second of two players to be picked first overall in the MLB draft to never reach the major leagues, the other one being Steve Chilcott."

  "text" : "Brad Daymond (born Bradley Daymond Ralph) is a Canadian musician, songwriter, producer and remixer also known as \"Riprock\". Growing up in Barrie, Ontario, he changed his name in his early twenties to work in the music industry. First known primarily for his membership in the band Love Inc. (and later in The South Rakkas Crew), he put his keyboard and programming skills to use remixing for other artists, having an early success with mixes for edgy electronica band Republica's \"Drop Dead Gorgeous\", the single version of which went to number seven in the UK. Daymond soon put his band on the back burner to form Riprock 'n' Alex G Productions with Alex Greggs and focus on behind-the-scenes work on hotter acts. Together, they remixed songs from 'N Sync's multi-platinum debut album, including the hits \"I Want You Back\" and \"Tearin' Up My Heart\". Following that success, the duo added production to their remixing duties for 'N Sync's second album, No Strings Attached, and co-wrote two of the album's songs with band member JC Chasez, including the title track. That album sold over 1 million copies its first day of release, and more than 2.4 million by the end of the first week, setting two sales records that have yet to be broken. The following year, they returned to the studio with Chasez to co-produce three songs they had written with him (and one co-written with Chasez and Justin Timberlake) for the band's followup, Celebrity, another multi-platinum smash which, while it didn't break the band's previous record, hit a new second place mark, selling 1.9 million in its first week. Riprock 'n' Alex G's success with 'N Sync made them an in-demand remixing team for a number of boy band singles, including A1's \"No More\" and Joée's \"Angel\". They remixed tracks from Timberlake's solo album Justified in 2002, and in 2004 they returned to the studio with Chasez for his solo debut, Schizophrenic, collaborating with the singer on songwriting, production, and remixing. The duo's teen pop activities weren't limited to the boys, however, as they remixed for some of the biggest young female singers around, including Christina Aguilera's debut \"Genie in a Bottle\", Britney Spears' \"Oops!... I Did It Again\", \"Lucky\", and \"Overprotected\", and Jessica Simpson's \"Irresistible\". Brad's Achievements include three number-one songs in Canada, and MuchMusic Video Awards for the Best Video of Year and Best Dance Video. Worldwide, Riprock 'n' Alex G has production, remixing, and/or songwriting credits on over 50 million units sold."

  "text" : "King Bridei III (or Bridei m. Beli; O.Ir.: Bruide mac Bili) (616/628?-693) was king of the Picts from 672 until 693. Bridei may have been born as early as 616, but no later than the year 628. He was the son of Beli, King of Alt Clut. His claim to the Fortrean Kingship came through his paternal grandfather, King Nechtan of the Picts. Nennius' Historia Brittonum tells us that Bridei was King Ecgfrith's fratruelis, i.e. maternal first cousin. Bridei's mother was probably a daughter of King Edwin of Deira. Bridei was one of the more expansionary and active of Fortrean monarchs. He attacked Dunnottar in 680/681, and campaigned against the Orcadian sub-kingdom in 682, a campaign so violent that the Annals of Ulster said that the Orkney Islands were \"destroyed\" by Bridei (\"Orcades deletae sunt la Bruide\"). It is also recorded that, in the following year, in 683, War broke out between the Scots of Dál Riata under Máel Dúin mac Conaill and Bridei's Picts. The Scots attacked Dundurn in Strathearn. Dundurn was Bridei's main powerbase in the south, a great 'nuclear' hilltop fortress.The Scots apparently did not take Dundurn, and Bridei backed up with an attack on Dunadd, the capital of Dal Riata. We do not know if Bridei took Dunadd, but the presence of Pictish-style carvings of that time period in Dunadd may mean that he took and occupied Dunadd. The lack of reputable contemporary sources of this conflict means that not much is known about the Scottish-Pict war of 683. But it is clear that, from his base in Fortriu (or Moray), Bridei was establishing his overlordship of the lands to the north, and those to the south, perhaps putting himself in a position to attack the Anglian possessions (or overlordship) which existed in the far south. It is very possible then that Bridei was regarded by Ecgfrith as his sub-king. The traditional interpretation is that Bridei severed this relationship, causing the invervention of Ecgfrith. This led to the famous Battle of Dun Nechtain in 685, in which the Anglo-Saxon army of Ecgfrith was annihilated. One Irish source reports that Bridei was \"fighting for his grandfather's inheritance\", suggesting that either Ecgfrith was challenging Bridei's kingship, or more likely given Bridei's earlier campaigns, that Bridei was seeking to recover the territories ruled by his grandfather in Fife and Circinn, but since taken by the English. The consequences of this battle were the expulsion of Northumbrians from southern Pictland (established through, for instance, the Anglian \"Bishopric of the Picts\" at Abercorn) and permanent Fortrean domination of the southern Pictish zone. Bridei's death is recorded by both the Annals of Ulster and the Annals of Tigernach under the year 693. Later traditions attributed a surviving lament for Bridei's death to Saint Adomnán, abbot of Iona."

By the early 1980s, James left the record business and worked for a time as an advocate for songwriters at the National Academy of Songwriters and as a Board member for the local chapter of NARAS. In the 1990s, James worked as publicist in the high-tech world. In 2016, James 2013 interview was featured in Danny Says alongside Danny Fields, Iggy Pop & Alice Cooper.

  "text" : "Buonaccorso Pitti was a prominent Florentine merchant in the late 14th and early 15th centuries. His family was very prestigious and his father very involved in politics. He was a gambler and often made unsafe investments, though he managed to make money from it several times during his life. He bought and sold horses, wine, wool, and clothing among other things. In 1422, he was elected the Standard Bearer of Justice, Florence's highest post. In 1401, while serving as the Florentine ambassador to Bavaria, he, his brothers, and their descendants were ennobled by Rupert, King of Germany, after having saved his life by thwarting a poisoning attempt by the Duke of Milan. His son, Luca, built the Palazzo Pitti in Florence, but never finished it, it was given to him, but he sold it in 1549. Buonaccorso's descendants, the Counts Buonacorsi di Pistoia, moved from Tuscany to Bavaria in the late 19th century. The family emigrated to the U.S. in the early 20th century. The patent of nobility granted to Buonaccorso and his brothers in 1401 follows: Letter of Familiaritas of Bonacorsi and his brothers, and that they can wear a coat of arms: Rupert, by the grace of God King of the Romans, always August, to the noblemen, the esteemed Peter, Franz, Bartholmew, and Alois Bonacorsi, brothers of the same Bonacorsi family and esteemed sons of the late Nero, faithfully beloved of me and of the Holy Empire: Let there be royal favor and every good. Although a royal and liberal munificence rightly exists toward all the faithful of the Holy Empire, because of a certain general clemency native to it, nevertheless, it ought to extend more richly the gifts of its generosity to those whom reputation more solemnly gives evidence that they have labored with more fervent zeal for special honors of the Holy Empire. Hence, because with regard given to the constancy of loyalty and to the useful services of sincere fidelity, which you, Bonacorsi, have faithfully shown to us and to the Holy Empire, you and your brothers inscribed above ought to show to us something else. Wherefore, we graciously admit you and anyone of your family into our friendship, and we add you to the community of our friends, with firm acknowledgement, recognizing that you enjoy and rejoice in all individual privileges, prerogatives, favors, and liberties wherever you wish, which our other friends enjoy however they wish, forever, in all things, et that in all your individual dealings and those dealings incumbent upon you, you implore the royal crown under full faith. We also grant this special favor of our royal munificence of majesty mentioned above by royal authority for the present, both to you and to anyone of your family, and to those legitimately descended from you, that you and anyone of your family ought freely to carry and wear for the performance of military display in wars, tournaments, and whatever other military acts everywhere, a coat of arms depicted with respect to its circumference and colors accordingly in the handiwork of the painter, with special figures in its images, with any impediment thoroughly removed, with the arms of any others always preserved. The shape and figure of this coat of arms contains alternating black and white waves and through the length of the shield a golden rampant lion with a red crown and red claws as is depicted in its very form in the picture below. The witnesses of this document are the Venerable Frederick, Archbishop of Cologne, Archchancellor of the Holy Roman Empire throughout Italy, Rabanus, Bishop of Spirensis, Conrad de Soltano, Prince-Bishop of Verden, the noblemen Emicho, Count of Lynnigen, Master of the Royal Curia, Guther, Count of Schwarzburg, Friederich, elder son of Morse and Count in Sarwerde, the Honorable Henry, superior of the Church of Saint Severinus, Colomanus Albert Goletus and Colbo de Buchart, soldiers, Nicloaus Buman, Prothonotary of the Royal Curia, Johann de Stamenstorff et Johann de Empache, Canons of the Church in Trent, Bertholdus de Novadomo, Rabanus de Helmstat, and Dieter Betendorffer, as testimony of this letter under the addition of the Seal of Our Royal Majesty. Given at Trent, the 15th day of the one thousandth, four hundredth first year of Our Lord, during the first year of our reign. By order of the Lord King, Johann Winheim"

  "text" : "Bernard Weiner (born 1935) is an American social psychologist known for developing a form of attribution theory which explains the emotional and motivational entailments of academic success and failure. Bernard Weiner got interested in the field of attribution after the first studying achievement motivation. He used TAT to identify differences in people’s achievement needs and then turned to the study of individual issues people face when they think of their own successes and failures. One of his students, Linda Beckman, came up with this topic, and from then on, Bernard Weiner carried on further investigation which led him to a road of the cognitive processes that have motivational influence. Being a three-stage process, attribution theory explains the causes of an event or behavior. The three stages include observations and determination of behavior, and attributing to causes. There are two types of attributions; external and internal. External attribution relates causality to outside agents, whereas, internal attribution assigns the person himself for any behavior. In one of his interviews in 1996, Bernard Weiner was asked the following: \"How does attribution contribute to high ability, high achievement, and giftedness?\" His answer is the proceeding paragraph. There are two perspectives to consider: self-perception and the perceptionof others. Certain attributions are maladaptive in that they arelikely to reduce achievement strivings. Among these are attributions of failureto lack of ability, which produce low expectancies of future success(tied to the stability dimension of causality), low self-esteem (linked withthe locus dimension), and humiliation and shame (because these are perceivedas uncontrollable). On the other hand, failure ascribed to insufficienteffort results in maintenance of expectancy of success and guilt, both motivators.Continuing commerce with the task increases specific ability (whichis unstable, as opposed to underlying \"intelligence\" which is perceived asstable). Thus, by influencing task persistence, attributions also influence actualtask ability.The same is true from the perspective of others. If I ascribe your failureto low ability, then I (as teacher) offer sympathy, do not punish forfailure, and give unsolicited help. All these are cues that you \"cannot,\"which starts the cycle indicated above. So other-perception and self-perceptionform a unity, together, which influence task persistence and, therefore,actual ability. Some of this is captured in the false-expectancyliterature."

  "text" : "Bernard Delfont, Baron Delfont (5 September 1909 – 28 July 1994), born Boris (or Boruch) Winogradsky, was a leading Russian-born British theatrical impresario. He was born in Tokmak, Russian Empire, the second son of Isaac and Olga Winogradsky. His brothers Lew Grade and Leslie Grade also entered showbusiness. His nephew Michael Grade (now Lord Grade of Yarmouth), Leslie's son, has had a career in the television and film industries. He had a sister, Rita Grade, who wrote a book about the family called \"My Fabulous Brothers\". Delfont entered theatrical management in 1941, after a career as first a dancer, then an agent. He presented over 200 shows in London and New York City, including more than 50 musicals, such as the original productions of Little Me, Stop the World - I Want to Get Off, City Of Angels and Sweet Charity. He also presented summer variety shows in many towns across the country, mainly seaside resorts. As Chief Executive of EMI, Delfont withdrew funding for the film Life of Brian in 1978 at the last moment, due to worries over the religious implications. He converted the London Hippodrome into the Talk of the Town nightclub, bringing in entertainers such as Shirley Bassey, Frank Sinatra, Eartha Kitt and Judy Garland, and also securing the exclusive rights from Paul Derval to stage the Folies Bergère for the first time outside Paris. He married the actress Carole Lynne in 1946. They had one son (David) and two daughters (Susannah and Jennifer). He was knighted in 1974 and created a life peer as Baron Delfont, of Stepney in Greater London in 1976. He died from a heart attack at his Angmering home. Lord Delfont was the life president of the Entertainment Artistes' Benevolent Fund, while his wife served as life governor. His widow Carole Lynne (Lady Delfont), 89, died as a result of motor neurone disease on 17 January 2008 at her home in Sussex, England."

  "text" : "Barry Sears, Ph.D. (born June 6, 1947, Long Beach, California) is an American biochemist and author, best-known for creating and promoting the Zone diet, which is aimed at achieving stable hormonal balance, leading to reduced inflammation, and improved health. As stated in several of his books, the Zone diet was born of his desire to avoid an early death from a premature heart attack, a fate of which all other men in his family had been early victims. In more recent years, Sears has popularized the use of high-dose Omega-3 fatty acids and polyphenols to further reduce inflammation. He recently revealed in an interview that he began studying lipids primarily because of their complexity. He released his first book in 1995, The Zone: A Dietary Road Map. It went on to sell over 2 million hardback copies and was a #1 New York Times bestseller. Since then he has frequently appeared in the United States media, including CNN, Forbes and Good Morning America."

Two brothers also immigrated to Canada and all three were involved with the fur trade and its expansion into the northwest. In 1770, the three brothers, partnered with Richard Dobie, had a successful fur trading expedition which went up the Saskatchewan River well past Fort Bourbon situated near the mouth of that river. More successful expeditions followed and in 1779 the Frobishers set up a company that owned two of the sixteen shares in the North West Company established that year. They were among the shareholders who got their fur trade goods from the London merchant John Strettell. At the time of Benjamin's death, the northwest was beginning to be the most important region in the fur trade and a time when the North West Company was on the point of having almost total control of the area's trade. He was one of the seventeen original founding members of the Beaver Club."

It has been suggested that Bruide's father was Dargart mac Finguine (d. 686) of the Cenél Comgaill, a kingroup in Dál Riata who controlled Cowal and the Isle of Bute. The parentage of his mother, Der-Ilei, is not certainly known. As well as Nechtan, a number of other brothers, half-brothers or foster-brothers of Bruide can be tentatively identified in the Irish annals: Talorgan son of Drest, Congus son of Dargart and Cináed son of Der-Ilei. Bruide was one of many important men of Ireland and Scotland who guaranteed the Cáin Adomnáin (Lex Innocentium; Law of Innocents) at Birr in 697. A battle between the Picts and Saxons in 698 in which Berhtred, son of Beornhaeth, was killed, is reported by the Irish chroniclers. A defeat of the Dál Riata is reported in 704, either at Loch Lomond or by the Leven, but it is more likely to have been at the hands of the Britons of Alt Clut than the Picts. Conflict in Skye in 701, where Conaing son of Dúnchad was killed, is most probably an internal conflict among the tribes of Dál Riata. It is reported in the Chronicon Scotorum that the winter of 700 was so cold that \"the sea froze between Ireland and Scotland\". Bruide died in 706, when his death is recorded by the Annals of Ulster and the Annals of Tigernach. He was succeeded by his brother Nechtan."

  "text" : "Ben Mitchell Williamson (October 16, 1864 – June 23, 1941) was a Democratic U.S. Senator from Kentucky. Born in Pike County, Kentucky, Williamson attended the rural schools of Kentucky and Bethany College in West Virginia. He engaged in the wholesale hardware business at Catlettsburg, Kentucky, from 1886 to 1924, and then at Ashland, Kentucky in 1924. He also engaged in banking and in coal mining. He was one of the founders of the Kentucky Crippled Children's Commission, serving as president from 1924 to 1941. He was also a member of the board of charities and correction for the State of Kentucky from 1929 to 1930, and the director of the International Society for Crippled Children. Williamson was elected as a Democrat to the United States Senate on November 4, 1930, to fill the vacancy caused by the resignation of Frederic M. Sackett and his initial replacement by John M. Robsion. He served only from December 1, 1930, to March 3, 1931, and was not a candidate for election to a full term. Afterwards Williamson resumed the wholesale hardware business at Ashland, with residence in Catlettsburg, Kentucky, and was interested financially in various other business enterprises. He died in Cincinnati, Ohio, and was interred in the Ashland Cemetery Mausoleum."

In the Amarna letters, Biryawaza was ordered by his Egyptian overlords to take armed action against Labaya's sons (EA 250). The name Biryawaza is Indo-European in origin. Biryawaza may have been of an Indo-European maryannu caste similar to that which ruled the Mitanni and later, the Hittites. Biryawaza wrote 4 Amarna Letters (EA 194-197)."

  "text" : "Ben Welden (June 12, 1901 – October 17, 1997) was an American character actor who played a wide variety of Damon Runyon-type gangsters in various movies and television shows. Born in Toledo, Ohio, Welden appeared in over 200 films between 1930 and 1966. Short, balding and somewhat rotund, he often literally played a \"heavy\", frequently in a somewhat comical or slightly dim-witted way, offsetting the sinister nature of his character's actions. Among his roles in this vein was The Big Sleep. Fans of Adventures of Superman remember him well, as he appeared in eight episodes, always as a different character and yet really the same character, in a way. His best-known Superman episode might be \"Flight to the North\", in which he tries (and fails) to outwit a country-bumpkin type (played by Chuck Connors). In 1966, he acted in episodes 47 and 48 of Batman. He was a semi-regular in the 1954-1955 CBS legal drama, The Public Defender, starring Reed Hadley as an attorney for the indigent. He appeared in a 1956 episode of The Lone Ranger entitled \"Trouble at Tylerville\". In his later years, Welden owned a confection company called Nutcorn, which supplemented his acting income. Outliving most of his peers, Welden died at age 96 on October 27, 1997. He was residing at the Motion Picture Retirement Home (Motion Picture & Television Country House and Hospital) in Woodland Hills, California at the time of his death."

She became famous both in Norway and abroad in 2003, following her performance in that year's Melodi Grand Prix, which is used to select the Norwegian entry for the Eurovision Song Contest. Her entry was the uptempo disco song Good Evening, Europe!, which is the phrase used every year when the ESC hosts address millions of viewers across Europe. As the title, almost all the lyrics were a reference to the Song Contest, usually direct quotes from past Eurovision entries, or else from other songs sung by former Eurovision participants. The song was written by Arve Furset, who also composed the winning song by Jostein Hasselgård. In 2006, Birgitte sang again, in Melodi Grand Prix 2006, performing another disco tune, Saturday. Her entry did not win direct entrance to the national final, but going through the Second Chance round, it did ultimately qualify. Singing in the grand final, she failed to make the top four."

He served as the country's Vice President from 1977 to 1980.Black Marks on White Paper, a documentary based on the life of Bennie D, Warner was produced in 2013. The documentary chronicles the life of Bishop Warner from his early years as a native Liberian, his education, his rise to leadership in the church and nation and his nomination and election to the vice-presidency of the Republic in 1977. The film tells the story of the military coup in 1980, which led to his decision to become a missionary to America for the last 35 years.Bob Hager was the producer/Director of the documentary under auspices of Tiny Seed Films. Born on 30 April 1935 in Careysburg District, Montserrado County, Warner was a bishop in the United Methodist Church for four years before he was plucked from relative obscurity to become Vice President in 1977, succeeding James Edward Greene. Warner was attending a conference of Methodist bishops in Nashville, Indiana when a military coup led by Samuel Doe overthrew the Liberian government on 12 April 1980. Warner attempted to form a government in exile in Ivory Coast to challenge the coup makers. A month after he was evicted from political power, he was removed from ecclesiastical power: Methodist minister D. Sieh Doe proclaimed the bishopric vacant, and for six months the seat was empty and the church run by Warner's administrative assistant. On 6 December, the Annual Conference elected as his successor Alfred S. Kula, formerly the dean of the Gbarnga School of Theology. Warner had been the second bishop in the history of the church in Liberia. Four years after Warner was overthrown, Commander-in-Chief Samuel Doe proclaimed clemency for him and announced that he was free to return to Liberia. Bishop Warner later established residence in Oklahoma City, where he taught at the United Methodist Oklahoma City University and pastored Quayle United Methodist Church. He then served in Syracuse N.Y, before being appointed District Superintendent of the Camden District of the United Methodist Church in Arkansas."

  "text" : "Boris Karlov (Bulgarian: Борис Карлов; August 11, 1924–December 14, 1964) was a Bulgarian accordionist. He was born in Sofia into a Romani (Gypsy) family. His father conducted an orchestra that was often heard on radio Sofia. At an early age Boris was already passionate about folk music, played first on the ocarina and later on the tambura in his father's orchestra. Here he acquired a feeling for the harmonic structure of Bulgarian music. At the age of twelve, Karlov began to play the accordion, beginning with a simple 48-bass Hohner instrument, and progressing to a 120-bass. Eventually he had an Italian Scandalli accordion custom-made for him. From 1950 to 1960, Karlov was in demand not only in Bulgaria, but also in Yugoslavia and Austria. He had a busy concert schedule and favourable reviews. Karlov developed a style of playing which was new on the accordion. Based on generally short, simple, but fast musical phrases, frequently in the irregular rhythms that were originally played on traditional Bulgarian instruments such as the gaida (bagpipe) and kaval (end-blown flute), he innovated a rondo form where the special character of Bulgarian music nevertheless remained. He died, still on tour, in Kraljevo, of a kidney infection."

  "text" : "B. J. Fogg was the first scientist to articulate the concept of \"captology,\" a word he coined to describe the overlap between persuasion and computers. As a doctoral student at Stanford University (1993-1997), Fogg used methods from experimental psychology to demonstrate that computers can change people's thoughts and behaviors in predictable ways. His thesis was entitled \"Charismatic Computers.\" Fogg founded the Stanford Persuasive Technology Lab. He directed the Stanford Web Credibility Project, which published How Do People Evaluate a Web Site's Credibility? Results from a Large Study in 2002. The Lab received a grant from the National Science Foundation in 2005 to support experimental work investigating how mobile phones can motivate and persuade people, an area the lab calls \"mobile persuasion.\"In 2003 Fogg published the book Persuasive Technology: Using Computers to Change What We Think and Do. This book lays the foundation for captology. In 2007, Fogg created a Stanford course about Facebook Apps. Using what Fogg calls \"Mass Interpersonal Persuasion,\" his students engaged over 16 million people in 10 weeks with projects done for the class. He is the founder and director of Stanford's annual Mobile Health conference. Fogg has created a new model of human behavior change. In 2011, the World Economic Forum's Wellness Workplace Alliance selected the Fogg Behavior Model as their framework for health behavior change. However, the model has been criticized as inadequate for behavior change in gamification. In December 2011, Fogg created a new way to develop permanent habits from baby steps. Fogg is the brother of Linda Fogg Phillips, an author and speaker on the issues of social media and parenting."

  "text" : "Bonafos Caballeria (died 1464) was an anti-Jewish writer. He was the son of Solomon ibn Labi de la Caballeria of Zaragoza and assumed the name of \"Micer Pedro\" upon converting to Christianity. From his early youth he devoted himself to the study of Hebrew, Arabic and Latin languages, and gradually acquired a profound knowledge of civil and Canon law. He won the favor of Queen Maria, who appointed him commissioner of the Cortes which convened at Monzón and Alcañiz (1436–37); and all the liberties and privileges which the Caballeria family had enjoyed for a long time were confirmed to him and his descendants. Caballeria was twice married: first (before his conversion) to the former wife of Luis de Santángel, who obstinately resisted baptism, and then to Violente, a daughter of the wealthy Alfonso Ruiz of Daroca, who, like Caballeria, was a convert to Christianity. In the year 1450 Micer Pedro began his Zelus Christi Contra Judæos et Sarracenos, a book full of malevolence against his former coreligionists. This work, upon which he was engaged for fourteen years, was published at Bologna in 1592 by Martin Alfonso Vivaldo, who added numerous annotations showing his hostility to the Jewish race. Soon after the completion of this work, in which he falsely accused the Jews of every imaginable vice, branding them as a cursed seed and a hypocritical, pestilential, and abandoned race, Pedro was murdered (1464), the deed having been committed, it is believed, at the instigation of Marranos. All the sons of Pedro occupied high positions in Aragon; Alfonso being vice-chancellor, Luis confidential adviser of King John, and Jaime counselor and confidential adviser of Don Ferdinand, accompanying the latter on his first visit to Naples, and traveling by his side in princely splendor. Nevertheless, Jaime in 1504, became a victim of the Inquisition, and was sentenced at Zaragoza. Another member of the family, Martin de la Caballeria, was invested with the command of the fleet at Majorca."

  "text" : "Billa Flint (February 9, 1805 – June 15, 1894) was a businessman and political figure in Ontario. He was a Liberal member of the Senate of Canada from 1867 to 1894. He was born in Elizabethtown (later Brockville) in Upper Canada and dropped out of school after six weeks to work for his father as a clerk. In 1829, unhappy with the sale of liquor at his father's hotel, he moved to Belleville and set up his own business there. In the same year, he also founded a temperance society there. In 1836, he was appointed magistrate and also became president of the Board of Police. He was elected to the Legislative Assembly of the Province of Canada in 1847 for Hastings and, in 1854, for Hastings South. In 1863, he was elected to the Legislative Council for Trent division and served until Confederation when he was appointed to the Senate. In 1866, he served as mayor of Belleville. He served over 20 years on the council for Hastings County and was warden for the county in 1873. His business had expanded from the sale of goods into the harvesting and sale of timber and the operation of warehouses and wharfs for storing and transporting goods. He also established towns along the Skootamatta River, with mills and factories, at Troy (later Actinolite) and Flint's Mills (now Flinton). He purchased mills at York Mills, later named Bancroft after his wife's mother's maiden name. Her name was Elizabeth Ann Clement (née Bancroft). He also helped promote steamships on Lake Ontario and railway links in the region. Although forceful and opinionated, he also donated land for schools and churches. He died at Ottawa in 1894, while serving as member of the Senate. Flint wrote a series of articles about the early days of Belleville which were published in the newspapers of the time."

  "text" : "Lumley's father was a clothes-dealer who had made his original fortune in Canada. The young Benjamin Levy (as he then was) was a pupil at King Edward's School, Birmingham. Lumley trained as a solicitor, and then studied for the Bar under Basil Montagu. In this capacity he gave legal advice to the financially troubled manager of what was then His Majesty’s Theatre, Pierre Laporte, who came to rely on him extensively. As Lumley had become familiar with making managerial decisions for the theatre, when Laporte died in 1841 the board of the opera company, consisting mainly of wealthy noblemen, asked him to take over. Lumley had already written a standard handbook on Parliamentary Private Bills and was launched on a promising legal career. But his memoirs clearly indicate his pleasure in mixing in high society and making a name for himself. Management of the now renamed (after the accession of Queen Victoria) Her Majesty's Theatre gave him an opportunity of close relationship with stars of the opera and ballet, to give and to be invited to ostentatious parties, and to bring high-quality Italian opera to Victorian London. The conductor at Her Majesty’s was Michael Costa. By their different natures – one a devotee of high musical standards, the other a connoisseur of the star system, Lumley and Costa should have made a perfect team. And indeed they were so for the first five years, one of the longer surviving partnerships of the age. Artistic progress – induced by Lumley, against the incliunations of the more conservatively inclined Costa - included the introduction of operas by Giuseppe Verdi to London, and new singing and dancing stars to replace the fading ‘old guard’, negotiations with Felix Mendelssohn for an opera on William Shakespeare’s Tempest – and, in 1847, the London debut of Jenny Lind. The resulting financial success led the optimistic Lumley to purchase the underlying lease of the theatre. One of the sensations of Lumley's management was the balletic 'Pas de Quatre', choreographed by Perrot, and with music by Pugni, in 1845. This divertissement, which featured as dancers Marie Taglioni, Carlotta Grisi, Cerrito and Grahn, may have been inspired by Lumley seeing four girls dancing outside the theatre. The 'Pas de Quatre' became an institution and is frequently revived."

  "text" : "Beryl Wallace (c. 1909 – June 17, 1948) was an American singer, dancer and actress. Born Beatrice Heischuber in Brooklyn, New York, she was the second of nine children of working class Jewish immigrants from Austria. Pursuing a dancing career, she was in her teens when she saw a casting call advertisement in the newspaper and landed a role in the 1928 Earl Carroll Broadway theatre production of Vanities that was billed as having the \"most beautiful girls in the world\". She adopted the surname \"Wallace\" as her stage name and went on to appear in six similar risqué productions that featured scanty costumes for the female performers and full nudity for the first time on Broadway. Beryl Wallace and producer Earl Carroll began a personal relationship that would take them to Hollywood where she would perform in film and at his Earl Carroll Theatre. The theatre-supper club's facade was adorned by what at the time was one of Hollywood's most famous landmarks: a 20-foot (6.1 m)-high neon facial portrait of Beryl Wallace of which a recreation can be seen today at Universal CityWalk, at Universal City, as part of the collection of historic neon signs from the Museum of Neon Art. Beryl Wallace made her film debut in 1934 in an uncredited role in the Paramount Pictures film production of Carroll's Broadway play Murder at the Vanities. She went on to appear in a number of small roles until 1937, when she co-starred in the Monogram Pictures \"B\" Western film production of Romance of the Rockies with Tom Keene. This led to another co-starring role in the 1938 film, Air Devils. In the early 1940s she continued appearing in bit parts, but also had good secondary roles in Republic Pictures \"B\" Westerns starring the likes of Roy Rogers and Richard Dix. While acting in twenty-two films over a ten-year period, Wallace's primary job was as a star entertainer at Earl Carroll's theatre. During World War II, Wallace sang weekly on two 15-minute radio shows and on Monday evenings hosted a half-hour entertainment show on NBC radio called Furlough Fun. In addition to helping entertain soldiers at the Masquers Club, on Sunday afternoons she was a volunteer dancer at the Hollywood Canteen."

  "text" : "Ben Dreith (born February 1, 1925) is a former American professional football on-field official who worked from 1960 to 1969 in the American Football League (AFL) and from 1970 to 1990 in the NFL. Prior to his teaching and officiating career, he was a three-sport athlete at the University of Northern Colorado. Dreith developed a reputation of being a no-nonsense, tough-minded official on the field. His career is most notable for an unnecessary roughness announcement on his microphone during a 1986 NFL season game between the Buffalo Bills and New York Jets and a controversial call during a 1976 playoff game between the New England Patriots and Oakland Raiders. During his thirty-year career, he officiated two Super Bowls, and received a playoff assignment for twenty-eight consecutive years."

He began as an engineering draughtsman but later became a metrologist at the University of Birmingham. In the late 1950s, he constructed an interference-controlled ruling machine in a home workshop, which was able to rule high-quality 3 by 2 inch gratings. In 1990, he received the H. E.

  "text" : "This 660 page book details a method for use in the analysis of fairy tales and applies it to the tales found in the repertoires of five Danish peasants collected by Evald Tang Kristensen in the mid 19th century. In brief, Holbek posits that fairy tales can be broken down into five \"moves\" which work to reconcile the three main tensions which are addressed by the fairy tale. These tensions are those between \"youths\" and \"adults\", those of \"low status\" and those of \"high status\", and \"male\" and \"female\". The relationships between these are frequently represented on a cube. Imagine a cube, place youth on the left, adulthood on the right, low status on the bottom, high status on the top, male on the front and female on the back. It is Holbek's estimation that one of the most important things that distinguish the fairy tale from the more general category of folktale is the fact that the tale ends with a marriage. By his definition, if the tale one is considering does not involve a marriage, it is not a fairy tale. At the beginning of a fairy tale, the protagonist, who can be either male or female, generally starts out as an unmarried youth of low status. This person generally becomes involved with an unmarried youth of high status and must undergo trials in order to prove their worth, thereby attaining high status so as to be worthy of their lover. Here the characters move from the bottom of the cube to the top of it. Over the course of the tale, the characters also cease to act as children and pass from the sphere of youth to the sphere of adulthood. The characters move from the left half of the cube to the right. The tension between male and female is negotiated at the end by the marriage between the protagonist and their lover, rendering the space between the front and back of the cube irrelevant. Holbek's moves can be described as follows: \n* In move two, the Low Young for the purposes of this example let us say Male (LYM) leaves home in order to make his way in the world, thereby becoming a Low Adult Male (LAM).  \n* In move three, the LAM meets the High Young Female (HYF) and they share some sort of illicit love.  \n* Move one, if it occurs, tends to occur in flashback form during move three. Move one generally involves the HYF explaining how she came to be imprisoned in whatever situation the LAM saved her from. Move one occurs first in the chronology of the tale, even if it does not occur first in the sequence of events as they are narrated. Holbek acknowledged the awkwardness of this, but decided against doing anything about it. \n* Move four, if it occurs, is generally an intensification of move three. For example, the lovers are separated again and must undergo trials in order to reunite and regain the status they enjoyed at the end of move three. \n* Move five involves the LAM being compensated for what he has done, allowing him to become a High Adult Male (HAM) and the couple is married, allowing the HYF to attain adult status and become a HAF, and also allowing negotiation of the tension between the genders."

He developed torpedoes used by the Union naval forces during the American Civil War. Maillefert was born in Barcelona, Spain and was responsible for several attempts a blasting to improve navigation through Hell Gate in New York City's East River. His obituary from the August 12, 1884 New York Times reads: Prof. Benjamin S. H. Maillefert was a member of the firm of B. Maillefert & Co., who obtained a reputation in their experiments with surface blasting, which was applied by them to the Hell Gate work. He was engaged in this work as far back as 1855. Their implements for surface blasting consisted simply of a boat and iron rod, to feel the bottom with and to let down charges with an electric battery. The firm obtained a contract to clear away Pot Rock and Sheldrake Reef, the contract ending on January 1, 1870. The result of their labor was not entirely satisfactory, as during the summer the rock was blown away only so as to give a depth from 12 to 20 feet, while the contract called for 25 feet. The Government then took charge of the work under Gen. Newton. Prof. Maillefert since then led a quiet life, not engaging in any business."

  "text" : "William \"Billy\" Bass (1921 – September 28, 1967) was an all-star and Grey Cup champion running back in the Canadian Football League and one of the first players to break the colour barrier in Canadian football. Bass attended University of Nevada, Reno and Tennessee State University, and was surrounded in controversy when a Nevada, Reno game was canceled because Mississippi State University's football team would not play them because Bass (and another teammate) were \"Negroes\". He started his pro career with the Chicago Rockets of the AAFC, where in 1947 he rushed for 44 yards and caught 8 passes for 79 yards. He then moved to Canada, where he played 11 games with the Montreal Alouettes. After trying out with the Rockets in 1949, he then moved on to the Toronto Argonauts where he would play 45 regular season and 9 playoff games in 4 seasons, also being selected an All-Star in 1951. He was also part of their 1950 and 1952 Grey Cup teams. Import player rules cost him his position with the Boatmen, but he played 1954 with the Ottawa Rough Riders and was player coach with the Toronto Balmy Beach Beachers in his final season. Bill Bass was one of the first group of African-American players to break the colour barrier in Canadian football, following the path blazed by Herb Trawick. He died September 28, 1967, at the age of 45."
