  "text" : "David Caradoc Evans (31 December 1878 – 11 January 1945), was a Welsh story writer, novelist and playwright. Evans was brought up in a Welsh-speaking community in Rhydlewis, Cardiganshire, and although he learned English at school and always wrote in English his work is influenced by Welsh syntax and vocabulary in a similar way to the way Lewis Grassic Gibbon's work in Scotland (written in roughly the same period) was influenced by Scots. Evans left school at 14 and worked throughout Wales in a series of menial jobs before moving to London where he worked as a draper's apprentice. He attended classes St Pancras Working Men's College and then became a journalist. He worked for The Daily Mirror from 1917 before editing T.P.'s Weekly from 1923 until the weekly folded in 1929. His first (and possibly most important) work of fiction was a series of short stories called My People, published by Andrew Melrose in 1915. It may be compared with Sherwood Anderson's Winesburg, Ohio and James Joyce's Dubliners. In tone, however, this work is closer to The House with the Green Shutters by George Douglas Brown. Evans wished to shock the Welsh out of their complacency and smugness by contrasting the pieties of non-conformist Christianity with the brutal realities of poverty, meanness and hypocrisy he had personally experienced. The work was savagely attacked by Welsh critics – he was known for a while in the Welsh press as \"the best hated man in Wales\"—but can now be seen as perhaps the first genuinely modern work of Anglo-Welsh literature. Evans wrote numerous other novels, plays and short story collections, but none attained the success of My People. His next collection, Capel Sion, was withdrawn from Welsh bookshops, because of the hostility he had aroused as much as for the subject matter. Dylan Thomas's early and more surreal writing is said to be influenced by Caradoc's My People. Both Caradoc Evans, and Dylan Thomas's namesake and great uncle Gwilym Marles (William Thomas) were born in Llandysul. Caradoc met (1929) and later married (1933) the Countess Helene Marguerite Barcynska, who wrote romantic novels under the name Oliver Sandys. His first wife, Rose Jesse (nee Sewell), whom he had married on Christmas Day 1907, petitioned for divorce in 1932. Living together in Aberystwyth and at Ruislip, Middlesex from 1937 to 1939, Marguerite and Caradoc were involved in theatrical ventures, both in Wales and in England. After the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939, they returned to Aberystwyth, and eventually settled in 1940 in New Cross, Cardiganshire, about five miles from Aberystwyth, where Caradoc remained with his son until his own death in 1945. In the 1940s, Marguerite wrote two autobiographical works, published by the publisher Hurst and Blackett. The first, Full and Frank: the Private Life of the Woman Novelist (1941), is a presentation of the author's life to the public. The second is a biography of Caradoc. The house they lived in, \"Brynawelon\" had spectacular views of Plynlimon, which may have inspired her book The Miracle Stone of Wales (1957). Caradoc Evans died of heart failure at the Aberystwyth and Cardiganshire General Hospital, Aberystwyth in January 1945 aged 66 and is buried in the New Cross Horeb chapel cemetery."

  "text" : "Charles-Louis Didelot (28 March 1007, Stockholm - 7 November 1837, Kiev) was a French dancer and choreographer. The son of Charles Didelot, the dance master of the King of Sweden, he studied dance with his father, who was an instructor in dance at the Swedish Opera, and debuted as dancer in the theatre of Bollhuset in Stockholm 1786. He then studied in Paris with Jean Dauberval. He followed his study with Jean-Georges Noverre, under whose lead he debuted in London in 1788. When the Russian Imperial ballet demanded a new chief choreographer, the former Imperial choreographer Charles Le Picq proposed to invite Charles Didelot. He arrived in Saint Petersburg in 1801 at the invitation of the director of the Imperial Theatres and he made his debut as the first dancer. His career ended in 1806, following an accident to his leg and the death of his wife, Rose, a brilliant ballerina. From then on, Didelot taught dance, having an important influence over the development of ballet. He received great acclaim for his choreography in \"Flore and Zephyre\" in 1796. This production featured dancers on wires (flying machines) in order to create the illusion of weightlessness. He became the first choreographer who brought a ballerina posing on the pointe (via his \"flying machine\") - in 1815 in the ballet Flora and Zephyr (1815, Paris), the main parts: Geneviève Gosselin -  Flora, Albert (dancer) - Zephyr, it was not dancing on the pointe, but it was the first release on the pointe (Geneviève Gosselin). Didelot raised the Russian ballet to unprecedented height, and it is from Didelot that the Russian ballet became to progress and has achieved global importance. He delivered more than 40 full ballets, not counting dances and fragments in other representations. He was dismissed from the Imperial troupe after a foolish quarrel with the Director of the Imperial troupe (prince Sergei Gagarin). His place of chief choreographer was taken by the Frenchman Alexis-Scipion Blache."

  "text" : "Carlo Blasis (4 November 1797 – 15 January 1878) was an Italian dancer, choreographer and dance theoretician. He is well known for his very rigorous dance classes, sometimes lasting four hours long. Blasis insisted that his students learn theories and definitions of dance steps. He trained all of Enrico Cecchetti's teachers and it is thought that Blasis's influence in his training is what led Cecchetti to create the Cecchetti method of ballet. Blasis was born in Naples. He was the first who published an analysis on the ballet techniques in 1820, in a work named Traité élémentaire, théorique, et pratique de l'art de la danse (\"Elementary, Theoretical, and Practical Treatise on the Art of the Dance\"). He is most known for the pose \"Attitude\" derived from the famous statue Mercury by Giovanni da Bologna. Enrico Cecchetti expanded his method of instruction and theories. From 1838 to 1853, Blassis was the Artistic Director of what is now the La Scala Theatre Ballet School. Prima ballerinas Fanny Cerrito, Carolina Rosati, Sofia Fuoco, Amalia Ferraris and Carlotta Brianza were among his students. Blasis died in Cernobbio."

  "text" : "Constantine Koukias (born 14 October 1965) is a Tasmanian composer and opera director of Greek ancestry based in Amsterdam, where he is known by his Greek name of Konstantin Koukias. He is the co-founder and artistic director of IHOS Music Theatre and Opera, which was established in 1990 in Tasmania's capital city, Hobart. Koukias's works range from large-scale music theatre and opera to mobile installation art events. His atmospheric compositions are characterised by mesmerising temporal, spatial and production designs, while his recent works exhibit eastern influences. His avant-garde approach to the presentation of opera has resulted in hybrid productions such as Days and Nights with Christ, To Traverse Water, Mikrovion, The Divine Kiss, Tesla – Lightning in His Hand and The Barbarians. His music theatre works include ICON, Kimisis – Falling Asleep, Borders, Orfeo, Rapture – Sonic Taxi Performance, Schwa – The Neutral Vowel, Antigone and The Da Ponte Project. Koukias was commissioned in 1993 by the Sydney Opera House Trust to compose the large-scale music theatre piece ICON to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the Sydney Opera House. His Incantation II for soprano and digital delay won the International Valentino Bucchi Vocal Prize in Rome in 1997, and in 2004 he was awarded a Sir Winston Churchill Fellowship. Prayer Bells, in which the composer draws on traditions of Latin, Hebrew and Byzantine chant, had its US premiere in 2010 at the Chicago Cultural Center. The Barbarians, which was commissioned by the Museum of Old and New Art and inspired by Constantine Cavafy's poem Waiting for the Barbarians, premiered in Hobart in 2012 as part of the MONA FOMA festival. It was nominated for a Helpmann Award for Best New Opera the same year, and Tasmanian company Liminal Spaces won the Event category of Australia's Interior Design Excellence Awards for its conceptualisation of the production's design. In 2014, Kimisis – Falling Asleep had its Netherlands premiere at Splendor Amsterdam and toured to the Karavaan Festival. His work Three Episodes from the Diary of Signaller Peter Ellis was a winner of ABC radio's Gallipoli Centenary Composer Competition, receiving its national broadcast premiere in 2015. Koukias has been the recipient of numerous other international commissions and awards, and his design credits include the internationally acclaimed Odyssey and Medea."

Leonard served in the Middlesex Regiment during the First World War; he left the army in 1919 with the rank of 2nd Lieutenant. Leonard then studied music at the Guildhall School of Music, and he subsequently toured the country as a professional musician.From the 1930s, he performed with stars like Fred Astaire, Cole Porter and Gracie Fields. He composed over 400 ballads; the most famous being \"My Love is Only For You\" (1946) and \"I heard a Robin singing\" (1948). During the Second World War, Leonard joined Laurence Wright, a music publishing firm, as an arranger - a position he held until 1969. He continued to be an active musician into his extremely old age. When he was 99 years old, his doctor advised him to \"ease up a bit\", and he accordingly cut his engagements to 75 per year. Until the age of 103 years, he played the piano every Thursday at lunchtime in the Plantation Cafe at Squire's Garden Centre in Twickenham. In 1999, Leonard was given the Golden Badge Awards by the British Academy of Composers and Songwriters."

Designed by Bartels, the Liver birds were constructed by the Bromsgrove Guild. During the First World War, Bartels was imprisoned in an internment camp on the Isle of Man, even though he had been a naturalised Briton for more than 20 years. After the war Bartels was forcibly repatriated to Germany, leaving behind his wife in England. Bartels returned to the United Kingdom and lived and worked in Harringay until his death in 1955, producing carvings for Durham Cathedral, various stately homes and even making artificial limbs during the Second World War."

She was given the \"Cell Phone Bandit\" nickname by the media because she spoke on her cell phone while committing the robberies. Candice received international notoriety when surveillance footage of the robberies was aired on newscasts worldwide, showing her talking on her cell phone during the robberies. It was later discovered that Martinez was talking to her 19-year-old boyfriend Dave C. Williams, who was also driving her getaway car. The case attracted widespread attention due to Martinez's being a young, attractive female college student, as well as the brazen way she conducted the robberies: while calmly talking on her phone. Dave C. Williams and Martinez were arrested on November 14 and 15, 2005, respectively. Martinez confessed shortly after her arrest. A total of $48,620 was stolen in the four heists. The couple bought a 1997 Acura Integra, two big-screen televisions, and plenty of designer clothes and bags, court records state. On December 13, 2005, Martinez pleaded guilty in U.S. District Court in Alexandria, Virginia, to two felony charges. On March 3, 2006, she was sentenced to 12 years in the Federal Bureau of Prisons, to be followed by 5 years supervised release (probation), a $200 special assessment (court costs), and $43,850 in restitution by U.S. District Judge Gerald Bruce Lee."

  "text" : "Charles DeLisi is the Metcalf Professor of Science and Engineering at Boston University, and also served as Dean of the College of Engineering from 1990 to 2000. Prior to moving to Boston University, he was Professor and Chair of Biomathematical Sciences and Professor of Molecular Biology at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine (1987–1989), Director of the United States Department of Energy's Health and Environmental Research Programs (1985–1987), Section Chief at National Institutes of Health (1975–1985), and Theoretical Division Staff Scientist at Los Alamos National Laboratory (1972–1975). In 1999 he initiated the Nation's first PhD program in Bioinformatics. With more than 150 Ph.D. alumni in Bioinformatics and Systems Biology, the Boston University program remains the largest and one of the most successful programs in the world. DeLisi was an early champion of the controversial idea that in cell biology, just as in the physical sciences, the mathematical formulation of concepts could predict phenomena that would not otherwise be apparent, and could thereby drive experimental research in new directions. The approach is seen in a number of investigations. His 1979 paper predicted, several years in advance of experimental demonstration, that the signal generated when nerve growth factor binds its plasma membrane receptor is transduced by receptor dimerization. In immunology, DeLisi was a strong proponent of the controversial hypothesis that the response of T-cells to antigenic stimulation involves formation of a ternary complex. Predictions based on the mathematical formulation of that idea, the amphipathic hypothesis, provided strong support for what was ultimately demonstrated conclusively by X-ray crystallography. The mathematical methods, developed initially with Jay Berzofsky, were subsequently extended and modified by many others, presaging the now widely used bioinformatic approaches to guide the design of peptide vaccines. At the same time, the Section on Theoretical Immunology (STI), which DeLisi founded several years earlier at the NIH, had introduced the use of supervised learning algorithms for the identification of functional regions in DNA and proteins. The first database integrating DNA and protein sequences with analytical tools was developed in collaboration with Minoru Kanehisa, who was then a Visiting Fellow at STI. In 1986, as Director of the U.S. Department of Energy’s (DOE) Health and Environmental Research Programs, DeLisi and his advisors proposed, planned and defended before the White House Office of Management and Budget and the Congress, the Human Genome Project. The proposal created a storm of controversy, but was included in President Ronald Reagan’s FY 1987 budget submission to the Congress, and subsequently passed both the House and the Senate, the latter with the essential support of Senator Pete Domenici (R, NM). In the spring of 1987, shortly before leaving the DOE, DeLisi established an ethical studies component of the Project. The goal was to set aside 3-5% of the funding in order to engage the best minds in the humanities and social sciences to develop a body of thought that would inform decisions about the development and deployment of the radically new technologies destined to emerge from the completion of the Project. In taking this step DeLisi was likely influenced by the fact that he was working for an agency that provided the vast majority of the Nation’s nuclear physics budget, and the awareness that the consequences of the rapid development of nucelar energy some four decades earlier continued to plague the planet. In addition to the medical and scientific advances engendered by the Human Genome Project, it and its progeny have had a profound effect on the sociology and culture of cell biology. The computer science community in particular moved with extraordinary dexterity into cell biology, transforming the field and creating a record of discovery destined to provide material for a remarkable story in the sociology of late 20th and early 21st Century science. Computational and mathematical methods are now widely viewed as central to progress in cell biology, a change that is forcing even the most conservative universities to respond to a new paradigm in biological education. Commemorating the significance of the Human Genome Project, the DOE installed a bronze plaque outside room F-202 at its Germantown, Maryland facility. The plaque reads, “FROM THIS ROOM THE HUMAN GENOME PROJECT EVOLVED FROM A MERE CONCEPT TO A REVOLUTIONARY RESEARCH PROGRAM THROUGH THE VISION AND DETERMINATION OF DR. CHARLES DELISI ASSOCIATE DIRECTOR OF ENERGY RESEARCH FOR HEALTH AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH 1985 TO 1987.” DeLisi is recipient of numerous awards including the Presidential Citizens Medal, awarded to him by President Clinton for his seminal role in initiating the Human Genome Project."

He left 60 Minutes in 1989 and began the Center for Public Integrity, a non-partisan group which reports on political and government workings, from his home, growing it to a full-time staff of 40 people.  When commenting on his move away from prime-time journalism, Lewis expressed his frustration that the most important issues of the day were not being reported. Lewis has given interviews for various publications and appeared in the 2003 documentary Orwell Rolls in His Grave and the 2005 documentary Why We Fight and others. He has discussed the difficulties facing media in trying keeping the public informed when television, newspaper and radio outlets are owned almost entirely by a few major corporations such as Comcast, Disney, and Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation. He was a Ferris Professor at Princeton University in 2005, a Shorenstein Fellow at Harvard University in the spring of 2006, and is currently a tenured professor of journalism at American University in Washington, D.C. Lewis' 2014 book is 935 Lies: The Future of Truth and the Decline of America’s Moral Integrity"

Charles was educated at Charterhouse School and was a barrister who met and married Beatrice Elvery. He was a contemporary of D. H. Lawrence, to whom he was introduced by Katherine Mansfield and John Middleton Murry on 26 July 1913. Known as Gordon Campbell, he served as Secretary of the new Department of Industry and Commerce, notably pushing for schemes to increase employment from 1922, which failed, and promoting the Shannon hydroeletric scheme with his minister Patrick McGilligan. From 1925 Campbell's influence decreased, being opposed to Patrick Hogan's policy of economic support for the larger farmers. From 1932 to 1963, Campbell served as President of the Council of the Royal Victoria Eye and Ear Hospital. He was appointed a director of the Bank of Ireland, and was involved in the transition of the Currency Commission into the Central Bank of Ireland in 1942-43."

He served as vice-chairman of the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights from 1993 to 2004. After leaving the bench, Reynoso spent ten years on the faculty of the UCLA School of Law; he is now professor emeritus. In 2000, Reynoso received the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the United States' highest civilian honor, for his efforts to address social inequities and his public service."

  "text" : "Craig \"Louisiana Lightning\" Nunenmacher is best known as the former drummer for Black Label Society and Crowbar. He joined Black Label Society (BLS) in July 2000 while playing for Crowbar, who were touring with BLS at the time. The original BLS drummer, Phil Ondich, left the band mid-tour and, to keep the tour on the road, Nunenmacher filled in for Ondich, playing for both Crowbar and BLS for the rest of the tour. A few weeks into the tour, he was asked to join the band permanently. In 2003, during a short break from Black Label Society (as front-man Zakk Wylde was focusing on a full-time tour with Ozzy Osbourne), Nunenmacher reunited with Kirk Windstein and wrote and recorded Crowbar's Lifesblood for the Downtrodden album, which had Pantera's Rex Brown on bass guitar, and a guest performance on the track \"Lifesblood\" by former BLS bass guitarist Steve Gibb on guitar. In 2006, he launched his website. However, sometime since then the domain right expired and it is now overtaken by cybersquatters, adding a faux search-page instead. He is sponsored by Pearl Drums. In March 2008, it was announced that Nunenmacher's albums — Crowbar (1993), Time Heals Nothing (1995) and Live+1 EP (1995) would be reissued in Europe on April 21, 2008, with bonus and multimedia tracks. In February 2010, it was announced that Nunenmacher had resigned as Black Label Society's drummer. Nunenmacher currently resides in Mississippi with his wife and son and has taken up a career change in logistics with a Fortune 500 3rd Party Logistics company."

  "text" : "Caroline Furness Jayne (1873–1909) was an American ethnologist. She wrote the best-known book on string figures, String Figures and How to Make Them: a study of cat's cradle in many lands, 1906. The daughter of the Shakespearean scholar Horace Howard Furness, and a graduate of Philadelphia's Agnes Irwin School, she became the wife of Horace Jayne, a biology professor at the University of Pennsylvania. Her brother, William Henry Furness III, received his M.D. from the same university and was an \"extensive traveler\" and a fellow of the Anthropological Institute of Great Britain. Her string figure mentor was Alfred Haddon, a Cambridge ethnologist who began the introduction to her book by noting that \"in ethnology ... nothing is too insignificant to receive attention\". He then goes on to defend the research invested in the unpromising amusement of string figures. Jayne, an extensive traveler herself, was the first to create a popular study of string figures building on dry academic papers which had appeared in journals like The Annual Report of the Bureau of Ethnology and the Proceedings of the Royal Geographical Society as well as in a variety of foreign language anthropological journals. (These are listed in her Bibliography (pp. 396-98) and include papers by Dr Haddon (six) and 42 other researchers.) String Figures and How to Make Them was first published in 1906 by Charles Scribner's Sons, New York (ISBN 0-8446-2318-0), and was reprinted by Dover Publications, New York in 1962 (LCCN: 62-51880); later reissues have ISBNs 0-613-81171-2 and 0-486-20152-X. It included figures illustrating every game and 16 portraits of players. The Jaynes lived in Philadelphia in a city house at 19th & Delancey Sts., designed by her uncle, the architect Frank Furness. Their son, Horace H. F. Jayne, became the first curator of Chinese art at the Philadelphia Museum of Art, and later was director of the University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology and a curator at the Metropolitan Museum of Art."

They were responsible for a series of high-profile robberies and murders which led to the embedding of the Felons' Apprehension Act (1866), a law that introduced the concept of outlawry and authorised citizens to kill bushrangers on sight. Active in the southern goldfields from 1865, Thomas, John, their brother James and several other relations were responsible for a reported 36 hold-ups and the deaths of five policemen—four of them bounty hunters looking to bring them in. Some modern-day writers have described the Clarkes as the most bloodthirsty bushrangers of all. They were captured during a shoot-out in April 1867 and hanged two months later at Sydney's Darlinghurst Gaol. Their execution ended organised gang bushranging in New South Wales."

  "text" : "Charles Tennyson d'Eyncourt (20 July 1784 – 21 July 1861), born Charles Tennyson, was a British politician, landowner and Member of Parliament (MP) for Stamford from 1831 to 1832 and for Lambeth from 1832 to 1852. He is also known for his social pretensions and his graceless behaviour towards his nephew, the poet Alfred Lord Tennyson. He was educated at St John's College, Cambridge. He was the younger son of George Tennyson, who bought the family seat of Beacons, in the village of Tealby, Lincolnshire, along with 2,000 acres (8 km²) of land, and came in time to own a large part of the village. George, as is well known, disinherited his elder son George Clayton Tennyson, the poet’s father, at the age of 12, putting him into a career in the Church, for which he felt no calling; and bestowed all his fortune on Charles. As a result, there was bad blood between the penurious Tennysons of Somersby, where George Clayton Tennyson had the living until he succumbed to drink and depression, and the opulent Tennysons of Beacons, who fancied themselves not only the wealthy but the socially superior side of the family. Old George’s wife Elizabeth Clayton was supposed to have descended from the Lords of Lovel and d’Eyncourt, and also from King Edward III. A ruined castle was part of the property, and Charles wished to establish a noble lineage for himself with a title and a castle. When his father died he changed his family’s name to Tennyson d'Eyncourt. Beacons was renamed Bayons, to make it sound like a Norman castle, and it was extensively enlarged and rebuilt in the style of a Gothic castellated manor-house. In public life Charles Tennyson d'Eyncourt was for many years MP for Lambeth, and was made a Privy Counsellor in 1832. Also in the 1830s, along with Augustus, Duke of Sussex and Admiral Sir Sidney Smith, he was one of the prime movers in a plan to have the Order of Knights Templar revived as a British order of chivalry. In this he failed, and he also failed during 1839-41 in an attempt to revive the d'Eyncourt peerage for himself and his heirs. In February 1829 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society He published, in 1850 a book of poems, Eustace, in memory of his youngest and favourite son who had died abroad; it had the misfortune to appear at the same time as Tennyson's In Memoriam, and suffered greatly by the comparison. Charles thoroughly disapproved of the poetry of his nephew Alfred (Horrid rubbish indeed . . . a discredit to British taste), and the latter’s appointment as Poet Laureate in the same year and subsequent offer of a baronetcy caused him outrage and chagrin. He did not live long enough to have to endure a 'Somersby Tennyson' being elevated to the peerage. The Tennyson d'Eyncourt family eventually gained its baronetcy at the beginning of the 20th century and still continues. Two of its later members had notable maritime roles. Charles's second son Edwin Tennyson d’Eyncourt (1813–1903) entered the Royal Navy and became an Admiral. Undoubtedly the most significant member of the family was the naval architect Sir Eustace Tennyson d'Eyncourt (1868–1951), the First Baronet, who was the Royal Navy's Director of Naval Construction in the first decades of the 20th century."

  "text" : "Craig Ellwood (April 22, 1922 – May 30, 1992) was an influential Los Angeles-based modernist architect whose career spanned the early 1950s through the mid-1970s. Although untrained as an architect, Ellwood fashioned a persona and career through equal parts of a talent for good design, self-promotion and ambition. He was recognized professionally for fusing of the formalism of Mies van der Rohe with the informal style of California modernism. Ellwood was born Jon Nelson Burke in Clarendon, Texas. Along with many others in the 1920s, Ellwood's family moved west, following U.S. Route 66, finally settling in Los Angeles in 1937. There, Ellwood, as Johnnie Burke, attended Belmont High School, where he was class president before graduating in 1940. In 1942, Ellwood and his brother Cleve both joined the U.S. Army Air Corps. Ellwood served as a B-24 radio operator, based with Cleve in Victorville, California until his discharge in 1946. After his discharge, Burke returned to Los Angeles and set up a company with his brother Cleve and two friends from the war, the Marzicola brothers, one of whom had a contractor's license. The four men called their firm 'Craig Ellwood' after a liquor store called Lords and Elwood located in front of their offices. Burke later legally changed his name to Ellwood. In 1948, he joined the firm Lamport Cofer Salzman (L.C.S.) as a construction cost estimator, having acquired this skill during his work for the Craig Ellwood Company. Ellwood also studied structural engineering through UCLA extension night school for five years. He became increasingly involved in design and architecture, resulting in Ellwood's first commissions, all for residences. Ellwood established 'Craig Ellwood Design' in 1951. There Ellwood would provide the commissions and the vision, and it was up to USC-trained architect Robert Theron 'Pete' Peters, and later others, to provide the technical realization, drawings and the required sign-off of a licensed architect. Early projects included Case Study House 16 in 1952. The designs were well received by both the trade and potential clients, often receiving favorable coverage in influential publications like John Entenza's Arts & Architecture, often arranged for by Ellwood personally. Thus the firm received a growing stream of both residential and commercial commissions, and Ellwood's style matured to fully embrace the concepts put forth by International Style architects, particularly Mies van der Rohe. By the late-1950s, though not a licensed architect, Ellwood was nonetheless a sought-after university lecturer, eventually giving a series of talks at Yale University, and teaching at the University of Southern California and California State Polytechnic University, Pomona's Department of Architecture. Though Ellwood's office expanded with the size and number of his commissions, it was never a particularly profitable enterprise. It continued through the mid-1970s, with several notable projects, including the master plan for the Rand Corporation's headquarters in Santa Monica, California, a number of Xerox and IBM offices, and the trademark \"bridge building\" dramatically spanning an arroyo and a roadway at Art Center College of Design in Pasadena. As published in the 1976, the Art Center building is recognized as the work of Craig Ellwood Associates, with James Tyler as design architect and Stephen Woolley as project architect. Some sources have sought to re-credit this building solely to Tyler, who had worked for John Sugden (a former associate of Mies) and was the architect of the Art Center addition, completed in 1991. The practice closed in 1977 and Ellwood retired to Italy to focus on painting and restoring a farm house near Ambra, Italy. Ellwood died of a heart attack in 1992 in Pergine Valdarno, Italy."

Lewis, then-president of the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO), Krause participated in the famed sit-down strike at a General Motors plant in Flint, Michigan in 1936. Like many other Americans, Krause served as a clandestine FBI informant on communist activity in the UAW during World War II, a secret only revealed to his family and other close associates decades later. So influential did he become within the union hierarchy that the Ford Motor Company allegedly offered him a position in upper management in exchange for his renunciation of the union, which Krause rejected. After moving to Los Angeles with his family in 1946, Krause became active in California politics, helping to consolidate the union voting bloc that proved vital to the electoral success of Democratic politicians throughout the state. He actively lobbied Sacramento for worker-friendly legislation, enjoying a particularly strong rapport with Jesse Unruh. He served two separate stints as president of UAW Local 923 located in Pico Rivera, California before retiring in 1973. Krause died in 2002 of complications from Alzheimer's disease, having spent his final years in relative obscurity."

His work combined many strands of both political and aesthetic discourse into his writings, addressing both the developing aesthetic of modern art and the political situation in Europe. Einstein's involvement in social and political life was characterized by communist sympathies and anarchist views. A target of the German right wing during the interwar Weimar period, Einstein left Germany for France in 1928, a half-decade ahead of the rise of Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party, later taking part in the Spanish Civil War on the side of the anti-Francisco Franco anarcho-syndicalists during the 1930s. Trapped in southern France following Nazi Germany's defeat of the French Third Republic, Einstein took his own life by jumping from a bridge on 5 July 1940."

  "text" : "Christine Arnothy (20 November 1930 – 6 October 2015) was a Budapest-born French writer. She has written numerous books, including J'ai quinze ans et je ne veux pas mourir (1955) (I am Fifteen and I Do Not Want to Die). She married Claude Bellanger (1909–1978). J'ai quinze ans et je ne veux pas mourir is based on her diary, which recorded her experience as a teenager during the 1945 siege of Budapest. She fled Hungary with her parents. When she arrived in France, her diary was the only possession she still had. The book was reviewed in Harper's Magazine in 1956. It received good reviews also from The Daily Express, The New York Times,Herald Tribune, San Francisco Examiner, Chicago Sunday Tribune and The Times. She later published a sequel, It Is Not So Easy to Live, a second part which does not come from her journal but from her memory; she chronicles her escape via Vienna to Paris, where she eventually settled and married. She also wrote several detective stories under the pseudonym William Dickinson, among other books."

He was forgotten for decades and his name was notably absent from most histories of the Silent Era, although his work was enthusiastically reviewed by André Breton and a number of his contemporaries. As his surviving films have an inventiveness and surrealism which give them a freshness appealing to modern audiences, after his rediscovery his work has sometimes been placed in the \"top tier\" of silent film accomplishments (along with those of, for example, Charlie Chaplin, Buster Keaton, Harold Lloyd). In comic style, he probably modelled himself after both Harry Langdon and Buster Keaton and was known to the French as \"Bricolo.\""

In comics, they have written several graphic novels and miniseries for independent publisher Oni Press, including Skinwalker, Three Strikes, Maria's Wedding, The Tomb, Once In A Blue Moon the Amy Devlin Mysteries, Frenemy Of The State (written with Rashida Jones), and the upcoming Bad Medicine. Their work at Oni led to work at Marvel Comics, relaunching the teen mutant book New Mutants. This book was renamed New X-Men: Academy X. Their run on these books spanned three years and created almost two dozen new super-powered mutant characters for Marvel's X-Men franchise, including Surge, Hellion, Wind Dancer, Prodigy, Wallflower, Elixir, Tag, Rockslide, Mercury, Anole, and Wither. They have also written for DC Comics, with stories appearing in Wonder Woman, Adventures of Superman and Batman Confidential. The duo also work in the expanding field of Japanese manga, providing English adaptations for the Del Rey titles Guru-Guru Pon-Chan, Sugar Sugar Rune and Kagetora. They also write original English language manga for Seven Seas Entertainment, writing one of the company's launch titles, Amazing Agent Luna and the pirate manga, Destiny's Hand as well as the current Dracula Everlasting."

In 260, he led an uprising of the Alamanni against the Roman Empire, traversing the Upper Germanic Limes and advancing as far as Clermont-Ferrand, and possibly as far as Ravenna, and he was possibly present at the Alamannic conquest of the Frankish town of Mende. According to Gregory of Tours' History of the Franks, Chrocus was a famous king of his time and was responsible for a great deal of destruction throughout Gaul, most notably of all ancient temples located in Gaul, though this may have been exaggerated. One of the temples he allegedly tore down was called the Vasso Galatæ, a marvelous structure that once stood in Clermont. Chrocus, with his troops, aided Constantine I's proclamation as emperor. In 306, he was present as a general in Roman service at the death of Constantius Chlorus in York, Britannia, and called for his son Constantinus to be declared the new Roman Emperor (Epitome de Caesaribus 41)."

Between 1921 and 1943 Dexter carried on a massive breeding program at his 76-acre (310,000 m2) estate in Sandwich, Massachusetts. There he produced between 5,000 and 10,000 seedlings annually and gave thousands of plantings away to private gardens, nurseries and public botanical collections. His estate is now operated as the Heritage Museums and Gardens which contains plantings of 125 of the known 145 Dexter cultivars."

  "text" : "(This name uses Portuguese naming customs. The first or maternal family name is Nunes and the second or paternal family name is da Silva.) Luís Carlos Nunes da Silva, nicknamed Carlinhos (19 November 1937 – 22 June 2015), played for Flamengo between 1958 and 1969. Because of his elegant football and his thin voice, he was known as \"The Violin\". In Flamengo, he won the 1961 Torneio Rio-São Paulo and twice the Rio State Championship (1963 and 1965). Carlinhos was capped for the Brazilian national team several times in the 1960s. He was one of the few players to receive the Belfort Duarte Trophy (\"fair play award\") from the Brazilian Football Confederation (CBF). The award is given to the players who have never received a red card. His career as a manager started in 1983, when he coached Flamengo for five matches. Four years later, he was back at Flamengo when former coach Antônio Lopes was fired for the bad results in the 1987 Rio State Championship finals. At that time, Flamengo's squad had Brazilian star Renato Gaúcho, veteran players (such as Zico, Leandro, Andrade, Nunes and Edinho), and young ones, that had just came from the youth squad. Zico, the main star of the club, still recovering from several knee surgeries, wasn't at his top form. Carlinhos, with a little luck and a lot of knowledge of the ways of the football, mixed veterans and newcomers to create a very competitive team, that won the 1987 Copa União. Five World Champions in the 1994 World Cup played for that team: Bebeto, Zinho, Aldair, Jorginho and Leonardo. Carlinhos returned in 1991, in similar conditions. His squad had Júnior, near retirement, Zinho and a lot of newbies (among them Djalminha and Marcelinho). After winning 1991 Rio State Championship, he won the fifth Brazilian National Championship for Flamengo in the 1992 finals against Botafogo (3-0, 2-2). He won another important title for Flamengo in 1999, the Mercosur Cup. Today he is retired, living in Leblon neighborhood, Rio de Janeiro, only a few blocks away from Flamengo's HQ, in Gávea. As professional he disputed 880 matches: 517 as player and 313 as coach. On 12 February 2011, he was honored for Flamengo, with the unveiling of a bust and a square at the headquarters of the Club. Carlinhos died on 22 June 2015."

  "text" : "Karl von Hoffman (St. Petersburg, Russia, c. 1889 – New York, New York, USA, 8 July 1982) was a soldier, adventurer, author, and photographer of German ancestry. He was a descendant of Melchior Hoffman; journalist Nicholas von Hoffman is his son. At the age of 17, von Hoffman—then a military cadet—disobeyed his mother's wishes and joined the Russian army during the Russo-Japanese War. For actions during the war he was awarded the Order of St. Anna. He participated in World War I, serving in the Russian army, and then under Admiral Kolchak on the White Russian side in the Russian Civil War. Von Hoffman is said by some sources to have been on the Roosevelt-Rondon Scientific Expedition in 1913; however, Theodore Roosevelt does not mention him in his memoir of the expedition, but footage proving von Hoffman's presence can be found here. Von Hoffman was an explorer who once led a safari from Cape Town, South Africa, to Cairo—a walk that took him three years and was the basis of his two books, Jungle Gods (New York, H. Holt and Company [c1929]) and Jerry on Safari: A 7,000 Mile Journey from Cairo to the Cape (Philadelphia: J. B. Lippincott Company, 1936). Von Hoffman's photographs of the Mexican Revolution and of Theodore Roosevelt were celebrated; his photographs of Roosevelt and Pancho Villa were exhibited in 2002 at the Martin & Osa Johnson SafariMuseum. He was the cinematographer for films including The Life of General Villa, (1914,), featuring Pancho Villa himself. The movie was produced by D. W. Griffith. Von Hoffman often said his knowledge of the use of machine guns was one of the things Griffiths offered Villa to gain his participation in the movie. (In 2003, the filming of the documentary about Villa was turned into a TV movie, And Starring Pancho Villa as Himself, directed by Bruce Beresford and written by Larry Gelbart with the minor role of von Hoffman played by Julian Sedgwick.) Von Hoffman was also cinematographer of The Marriage Bond (1916) directed by Lawrence Marston. He was a member of the Explorers Club. He was also an Honorary Life Member and past president (1962) of the Adventurers' Club of New York."

  "text" : "Claudio S. Grafulla (1812–1880) was a composer in the United States during the 19th Century, most noted for martial music for regimental bands during the early days of the American Civil War. Grafulla was born in 1812 on Minorca, an island off the coast of Spain that was occupied by the British after the Napoleonic wars. At the age of 28, he emigrated to the United States, where he became a French horn player in Napier Lothian's New York Brass Band in New York City. This band was attached to the 7th Regiment of the New York National Guard, which was honored in 1922 by John Philip Sousa's The Gallant Seventh march. In 1860, he added woodwinds to a reorganized band and continued to serve as its director until his death in 1880. Grafulla was a quiet, unassuming man who never married; his whole life centered on his music. His remarkable technical and musical skills allowed him to become well known as a composer, often writing music to order, and as an arranger. The hallmark Port Royal Band Books were composed and arranged for the 3rd New Hampshire Regiment Band, when it was formed for service during the Civil War. As a director of the 7th Regiment Band, his fame spread widely. Grafulla composed Washington Grays in 1861 for the 8th Regiment, New York State Militia. This work has been called a march masterpiece, a band classic, and the prototype of the concert march. Showing the stylistic influence of both German and Italian marches, the march has a marvelous balance of technique and melody in a continuous flow of musical ideas. It dared to break the old formulas, however, because it has no introduction, no break strain, and no stinger. Curiously, long after Grafulla's death, during the presidential contest of 1896, while McKinley and Bryan were debating the burning issue of a silver vs. gold monetary standard, his publishers issued a Solid Money March under the palindrome, \"C.S.Allufarg\"."

  "text" : "Charlie Andreas Weimers (born November 12, 1982) is a center-right Swedish politician. He was Chairman of the Swedish Young Christian Democrats (Kristdemokratiska Ungdomsförbundet - KDU) 2008-2011. He was elected Vice President of the Youth of the European People's Party at the 6th YEPP Congress in Stockholm in May 2007. Weimers was born in Karlstad, and currently lives in Hammarö. He joined the Christian Democrats and the Young Christian Democrats in 1998. He served as the district chairman of KDU-Värmland from 2000–2001 and again from 2003-04. He was elected to the KDU national board in 2003. He lost a close race for chairmanship of the KDU in 2005 to Ella Bohlin, a more centrist candidate. Weimers was later elected first vice chairman of KDU at the national convention in 2005. He pursued graduate studies in Karlstad University's political science program. Weimers was elected to the Hammarö Municipal Council in 2002. He was elected again in 2006, and currently serves as party leader for the Christian Democrats in the council. He has also been a member of the Värmland Regional Council since 2006. He was elected chairman of the KDU in 2008. After the 2010 general election, Hammarö switched majority from a socialist rule to blue-green one, consisting of five parties (Moderates, Liberal Peoples Party, Centre Party, Green Party and Christian Democrats), thus making Weimers Deputy Mayor of Hammarö. Because of this, Weimers declared in January 2011 that he would resign in June 2011, which he did."

  "text" : "Christopher Dufrost de La Jemeraye (also known as Christophe Dufrost de La Jemerais with various variations on the last name),(b. December 6, 1708 – d. May 10, 1736), was the lieutenant and nephew of Pierre Gaultier de Varennes et de La Vérendrye in the exploratory party which headed west from Fort Kaministiquia in 1731. He and Jean Baptiste de La Vérendrye established Fort St. Charles on Lake of the Woods in 1732. In the spring of 1733, he and Jean Baptiste headed down the Winnipeg River to set up a post in the Lake Winnipeg area. They were stopped by ice and La Jemeraye returned to Fort St. Charles while his cousin established a small temporary fort named La Barrière. La Jemeraye continued as an important participant in La Vérendrye's exploration and fur trading activities. He and Jean Baptiste de La Vérendrye built Fort Maurepas about six miles north of present-day Selkirk, Manitoba in 1735. Traveling from there to Fort St. Charles via the Red River/Savanne Portage route, La Jemeraye, who was very ill, died at the junction of the Red and Roseau rivers. The date of his death gives us proof that, in 1736, La Jemeraye and one of La Vérendrye's sons passed The Forks. The Forks is the site of present-day Winnipeg. An interesting and important contribution of Christopher Dufrost relates to his skill as a cartographer. He produced the first French map of the west in 1733. It was of high quality and the final copy was produced, at a later date, by the engineer, Gaspard-Joseph Chaussegros de Léry."

  "text" : "Josep Andreu i Lasserre (April 23, 1896 – July 26, 1983), best known as Charlie Rivel, was an internationally known Spanish circus clown. He was born in Cubelles (Barcelona, Spain). His parents Pere Andreu Pausas (Spanish) and Marie-Louise Lasarre (French) were circus artists as well. He debuted at the age of three and formed the group Los Rivels with his brothers Polo Rivel and René Rivel. He took his artistic first name from Charlie Chaplin whom he encountered first in 1910. Each respected the other. Legend has it that Chaplin later asked him: \"Is it you who imitate me or I who imitate you?\" He later discovered his definitive routine, featuring a chair, a guitar and a long jersey. In 1971, he appeared in Federico Fellini's film Clowns. The Charlie Rivel Hall in Cubelles is a museum dedicated to him, There is also a park dedicated to him in Vigo in the province of Pontevedra, Spain. \n* Monument to Charlie Rivel in Montjuïc, Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain. \n* Plaque on Charlie Rivel's birthplace house. \n* Charlie Rivel's birthplace house, Cubelles, Catalonia, Spain."

  "text" : "Charles Clarence \"Clare\" Laking (February 21, 1899 – November 26, 2005) was, at age 106, one of the last surviving Canadian veterans of the First World War. At the time of his death he was believed to have been the last surviving Canadian veteran of the war to have fought on the front lines. He was born and raised in Campbellville, Ontario, and defied the wishes of his Methodist father when he joined the Canadian field artillery in 1917. He served as a signaller on the front lines in France for two years. He received the French Légion d'honneur and a Golden Jubilee Medal. After the war, Laking worked in lumber until 1941, when he took over Danforth Wallboard and Insulation Ltd. He ran the company until his retirement in 1965. In his old age, he led an uncommonly active life. He went to every Toronto Maple Leafs game until he was 100, drove until he was 102, and walked a mile a day. Laking was married for many years to his wife Helen, who died in 1993. They had two children, Keith and Sheila. He died in Toronto at the Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre at the age of 106. In addition to his son and daughter, Laking was survived by four grandchildren and nine great-grandchildren."

Born in Haarlem, his family moved to Jakarta after the war. At the age of 11 he returned to the Netherlands on his own. After his study at the University of Amsterdam he worked at the Mathematisch Centrum (MC) in Amsterdam under Adriaan van Wijngaarden. There he was one of the editors of the original Report on the Algorithmic Language ALGOL 68 and was the creator of the original Compiler Description Language (CDL). He is also the creator of Affix grammars, which are a variant of Van Wijngaarden grammars. In a sense, CDL is a deterministic executable affix grammar, while Prolog is a non-deterministic executable affix grammar (a link acknowledged by the implementors of the original Prolog interpreter). In 1972 he moved to Berlin to initiate an informatics course at the Technical University of Berlin. In 1977 he became the first Professor Informatics in the Netherlands at the Radboud University Nijmegen. He died in a motor cycle accident in 2013."

  "text" : "Cunincpert (also Cunibert or Cunipert) was king of the Lombards from 688 to 700. He succeeded his father Perctarit, though he was associated with the throne from 680. Soon after his assumption of the sole kingship, Cunincpert was ousted by Alahis, duke of Brescia (who had previously been duke of Trento). Alahis had also rebelled during the reign of Perctarit but it was Cunincpert who, according to Paul the Deacon in the Historia Langobardorum had persuaded his father to show mercy. Perctarit is reported to have warned his son of the consequences. It was thus soon after Perctarit's death that Alahis forced Cunincpert to flee to Isola Comacina, an island in the middle of Lake Como. The only extant record of the rule of Alahis is contained in Book V of the Historia Langobardorum of Paul the Deacon. His rule is portrayed as burdensome and tyrannical and particularly antagonistic to the Catholic Church. Having lost the support of the Church and crucially of the 'people' (notably Aldo and Grauso) Cunincpert was able to return to Pavia and resume control. Alahis, however was able to acquire sufficient support to bring the matter to battle. Cunincpert with the men of Piedmont defeated Alahis and the men of Venetia at the Battle of Coronate, on the Horn of the Adda, near Lodi in 689. Alahis was slain in battle. Cunincpert suppressed other insurrections during his reign, including that of the usurper Duke Ansfrid of Friuli. He also successfully settled the schism in the Italian church between Aquileia and Grado. He died in 700 and was succeeded by his young son Liutpert, the regent Ansprand, and many rebels. Many wars took place during his reign. He is notably the first Lombard monarch to strike coins in his image."

  "text" : "Charles Despiau (November 4, 1874 – October 30, 1946) was a French sculptor. Despiau was born at Mont-de-Marsan, Landes and attended first the École des Arts Décoratifs and later the École nationale supérieure des Beaux-Arts. He began exhibiting at the Salon des Artistes Français, from 1898 to 1900; then at the less academic Société Nationale des Beaux-Arts, where he showed from 1901 to 1921, and finally to the Salon des Tuileries, where he exhibited from 1923 to 1944. Rodin hired him as an assistant in 1907. Despiau worked with Rodin, as well as doing his own sculpture, until 1914, when he was drafted for service in the camouflage unit in World War I. Returning to sculpture after the war, his success was established with his one-man show at the Brummer Gallery in New York in late 1927. He died in Paris in 1946. Despiau was not a prolific sculptor, preferring to work for as long as it took to realize his vision. There are several surviving plaster statues which repeat a model with only slight variations. His works, mostly portraits and nudes exemplifying a calm classicism, are in the collections of over thirty museums in France and over 100 museums around the world, including the Metropolitan Museum of Art. The Museum of Modern Art in New York owns the bronze Assia, perhaps his best-known work. The largest collection is in his native Mont-de-Marsan, in a museum he shares with Robert Wlérick, established in the Donjon Lacataye. Despiau produced a total of 150 sculptures and 1,000 drawings over a fifty-year career."

  "text" : "Claire Zeisler (April 18, 1903 – September 30, 1991) was a noted American fiber artist who expanded the expressive qualities of knotted and braided threads, pioneering large-scale freestanding sculptures in this medium. Throughout her career Zeisler sought to create \"large, strong, single images\" with fiber. Zeisler's non-functional structures were constructed using traditional weaving and avant-garde off the loom techniques such as square knotting, wrapping, and stitching. Zeisler preferred to work with natural materials such as jute, sisal, raffia, hemp, wool, and leather. The textiles were often left un-dyed, evidence of Zeisler's preference for natural coloration that emphasized the fiber itself. When she used color, however, Zeisler gravitated towards red. Her work is influenced by and has influenced fiber artists in the 1960s and 70s such as Kay Sekimachi, Barbara Shawcroft, Lenore Tawney, Magdalena Abakanowicz, and Sheila Hicks."

  "text" : "Carlo Alberto Castigliano (9 November 1847, Asti – 25 October 1884, Milan) was an Italian mathematician and physicist known for Castigliano's method for determining displacements in a linear-elastic system based on the partial derivatives of strain energy. Alberto Castigliano moved from the region of his birth, Piedmont in northwestern Italy, to the Technical Institute of Terni (in Umbria) in 1866. After four years in Terni, Castigliano moved north again, this time to become a student at the Polytechnic of Turin. After three years of study in Turin he wrote a dissertation in 1873 entitled Intorno ai sistemi elastici for which he is famous. In his dissertation there appears a theorem which is now named after Castigliano. This is stated as: ... the partial derivative of the strain energy, considered as a function of the applied forces acting on a linearly elastic structure, with respect to one of these forces, is equal to the displacement in the direction of the force of its point of application.\" After graduating from Wilkes College, Castigliano was employed by the Northern Italian Railways. He headed the office responsible for artwork, maintenance and service and worked there until his death at an early age."

  "text" : "Carson Williams is an electrical engineer from Mason, Ohio who is noted for his light shows using Christmas lights affixed to and around his house. The lights are programmed and synchronized to turn on and off with music using a computer application and set of controllers from the Light-O-Rama company. For each minute of animation synchronized to music, he spent approximately one hour to sequence 88 Light-O-Rama channels to control his 16,000 Christmas lights. His notability suddenly increased when a popular clip was widely circulated on the Internet in late 2005 showing a recording of one of his shows from 2004, accompanied by the track \"Wizards in Winter\" by the Trans-Siberian Orchestra. An urban legend even developed that it was not a video of an actual light display, but faked on a computer. With permission from both of his neighbors, he put on various displays each year at his home. Typical light shows ran between 6 p.m. and 10 p.m. each night. Viewers heard the music on an FM broadcast in their cars. This kept the speaker noise level down for his neighbors. However, on December 6, 2005, Carson closed the light display indefinitely due to immense traffic congestion in his subdivision; there was a car accident in that area and police were unable to reach the site due to the heavy traffic that had built up. Williams's Christmas display proved so popular that it was featured in a Miller Lite beer commercial in December 2005. In fact, the TSO song was so popular that many other individuals have used the same song in their own Christmas display. A light show similar to Williams' \"Wizards in Winter\" was used in a commercial for the UK's National Lottery, although according to a press release the advertising campaign \"was created by Abbott Mead Vickers BBDO\". No mention of Carson Williams' light show was made. He has taken his Internet fame and started a custom animation lighting business. ConsarLights.com is a business to provide custom designed holiday lighting. In November 2006, Williams decided to revive the display and move the show to Heritage Oak Park in Mason, Ohio. The show was converted into a \"drive-through\" style show and admission was charged on a per-car basis. According to a promotional video, officials at the Northfield Stapleton Shopping Center found William's house lights video on the Internet and asked him to design a new show in Denver, Colorado, on a commercial scale. Created with Parker 3D, the show featured over 250,000 LED lights drawing 150 amperes of electric current. It used several Trans-Siberian Orchestra songs, including \"Wizards in Winter,\" \"Christmas Eve/Sarajevo 12/24\" and \"Christmas Canon\". \"Symphony In Lights\" was a free show open to the public that ran through the month of December 2006. For 2007, Consar Lights programmed new light shows designed by Parker 3D for The Promenade Bolingbrook in the Chicago Metropolitan Area, and the Yorkdale Shopping Centre in Toronto."

  "text" : "Christopher Robin Smith (born 1959) is an American actor, director and improviser, best known for his improv workshops and his handful of appearances on Whose Line Is It Anyway?.Raised in Parma, Ohio and a Graduate of Valley Forge High School (Class of 1977),Chris began performing at an early age. Appearing in many productions throughout his high school years Chris also sang with the legendary Cleveland area Rock n' roll revival group \"The Fabulous Brylcreams\" from 1975 through August 1978. At this time he was attending Kenyon College and singing with the Kokosingers, an a cappella group that performed both locally and throughout the United States in addition to recording two albums. After graduating from Kenyon in 1981 with a degree in English, he moved to New York City to pursue an acting career. Smith, a graduate who part-studied at the University of Exeter in England, joined the Interplay improvisation troupe in New York City and later married its founder and director, Tamara Wilcox. The troupe gained good reviews and Smith, along with performing partner Jim Meskimen, was recruited to appear in two episodes of Whose Line Is It Anyway? when the British improvisation show filmed a season in New York. Their performances were at the more astute and polished end of the improvisation scale, although their debut was completely overshadowed by the presence of Ryan Stiles, who would later become the show's main star. Smith and Meskimen made one more appearance on Whose Line Is It Anyway? in 1992 when the show returned to New York for a second run, and a year later, the Smiths moved to Los Angeles to begin a new improvisation group called the Really Spontaneous Theatre Company. Meskimen remains a member and the troupe continues to perform, despite the death of Tamara Wilcox-Smith in 1998. After Meskimen failed an audition for Whose Line Is It Anyway? when it moved permanently to the USA, Smith opted not to follow suit. He has since written numerous screenplays, short stories and books, but has restricted his appearances on stage and screen, preferring instead to coach young improvisers and write. In July 2010 and August 2011, Chris returned to Parma Heights, Ohio to reunite with his former bandmates from the Fabulous Brylcreams to raise money for the Music Department at Valley Forge High School. Both concerts were a huge success, raising money to help offset the cost of participation in music programs at the high school."

  "text" : "Calvin Coolidge \"Cal\" Worthington (November 27, 1920 – September 8, 2013) was an American car dealer, best known on the West Coast of the United States, and to a more limited extent elsewhere, from minor appearances and parodies in a number of movies. He was best known for his unique radio and television advertisements for the Worthington Dealership Group, most of which began with the announcement \"Here's Cal Worthington and his dog Spot!\"—though \"Spot\" was never a dog. Often, Spot was a tiger, a seal, an elephant, a chimpanzee, or a bear. In one ad, \"Spot\" was a hippopotamus, which Worthington rode in the commercial. On some occasions, \"Spot\" was a vehicle, such as an airplane that Worthington would be seen standing atop the wings of while airborne. \"Spot\" was officially retired in the mid-1980s; however he was mentioned occasionally in his later commercials. According to a profile published in the Sacramento Bee in 1990, Worthington grossed $316.8 million in 1988, making him at the time the largest single owner of a car dealership chain. His advertising agency, named Spot Advertising, had Worthington as its only client and spent $15 million on commercials, the most of any auto dealer at the time. He sold automobiles from 1945 until his death and owned a 24,000-acre (9,700 ha; 38 sq mi) ranch located in Orland, California, north of Sacramento."

  "text" : "Clay Hine (born 1963) is a barbershop musician and arranger. He is a native Chicagoan, but has lived in the Atlanta Metro area since the late-80's since he graduated from the University of Illinois (Urbana-Champaign) in 1986 with a degree in electrical engineering. Before college he sang with The West Towns Chorus (Lombard, IL) winning 2 silver medals (1985, 1986). He started arranging when he was a teenager for fun, mostly tags and parts of songs. After college he began arranging for a newly chartered chorus in Marietta, GA (The Big Chicken Chorus) and his first post-college quartet Atlanta Forum (1987 Dixie District Champs). His early arrangements were for the purpose of helping out Atlanta-area and Dixie District quartets and choruses, but he soon had requests nationwide from internationally competing choruses and quartets. Clay has arranged music for: Keepsake, PLATINUM, FRED, Four Voices, Riptide, Backbeat, Marquis, Nightlife, BSQ, Max Q, Bank Street, State Line Grocery, Overture, Sound Standard, Svelte Brothers, and many other internationally renowned groups. Although Clay had many years of piano as a child he is a self-taught arranger having little formal music education at the university level. Clay directed the Big Chicken Chorus from 1989 through 2004 and began directing the newly chartered Atlanta Metro (Atlanta Vocal Project) chapter in 2005. In his 20 years of directing Clay has won 16 international chorus preliminary contests with the Big Chicken Chorus (1989–2004) and 6 with The Atlanta Vocal Project (2005–2008, 2011-2012). He has arranged over 300 songs in various styles although most of those songs are in the barbershop style. He also spent 8 years as a Music judge for the Barbershop Harmony Society. In 1999 Clay's quartet, FRED, won the international quartet competition in Anaheim, CA. He continues to be active with FRED, the Atlanta Vocal Project, and his current quartet A Mighty Wind and still arranges music for various groups. Clay is married to Becki Hine. They have two children, Melody and Camden."

He began his career at his father's business before taking over Arnold & Co in 1843 at 84 Strand, London. The family business, Charles Frodsham and Co. still holds the Royal Warrant of clock suppliers to the British Royal Family. He was master of the Clockmakers' Company in 1855 and 1862. An example of a clock by Frodsham is a sidereal clock clock on display in the Norman Lockyer Observatory. Time kept by a Frodsham clock was the official time piece of Australia when it was founded by the British in 1788. The clock remains on display at the Royal Observatory in Sydney. Frodsham's demonstration double-escapement skeleton clock, numbered 883, manufactured for the Great Exhibition of 1851, is believed to be unique. His father was the renowned chronometer maker and Fellow of the Royal Society, William James Frodsham."

  "text" : "Boyar Janko Prince von Racowitza (died 1865) was a nobleman from Wallachia, who participated in a notable duel on 28. August 1864. He had come from Romania to Berlin in 1856, where he studied philosophy and law at Berlin university. He became a member of a German Student Corps there. A diplomat in Bavarian service, Wilhelm von Dönniges (d. 1872), father of Helene von Dönniges (b. 1846, d. 1911) intended the prince to marry his daughter. She preferred a Social Democratic leader of the labour movement, Ferdinand Lassalle, known for his independence from persons such as Karl Marx. When her father heard of their plans to marry he locked her in a room and arranged an engagement with von Racowitza. Lasalle challenged Helene's father. When the count heard of this, he took over Lasalle's challenge - this was a common duelling procedure, when an older man was challenged by a younger one. Racowitza had no experience in the use of pistols and only one day to exercise. Shot in the groin, Lassalle died in this pistol duel in Switzerland. Following the duel Racowitza fell ill and died not long after Helene von Dönniges married him. His widow married a second time an actor named Friedmann and became an actress herself. This marriage ended in divorce in 1873. Together with her third husband, the Russian nobleman Sergej Jegorowitsch Schewitsch she then moved to America but returned to Europe 1890."

Fritts coated the semiconductor material selenium with an extremely thin layer of gold. The resulting cells had a conversion electrical efficiency of only about 1% owning to the properties of selenium, which in combination with the material's high cost prevented the use of such cells for energy supply. Selenium cells found other applications however, for example as light sensors for exposure timing in photo cameras, where they were common well into the 1960s. Solar cells later became practical for power uses after Russell Ohl's 1941 development of silicon p/n junction cells that reached efficiencies above 5% by the 1950s/1960s. Today's best silicon solar cells are over 40% efficient, with industrial average over 17%."

  "text" : "Cadwgan ap Bleddyn (1051–1111) was a prince of the Kingdom of Powys (Welsh: Teyrnas Powys) in eastern Wales. Cadwgan was the second son of Bleddyn ap Cynfyn who was king of both Powys and Gwynedd. When Bleddyn was killed in 1075, Powys was divided between three of his sons, Cadwgan, Iorwerth and Maredudd. Cadwgan is first heard of in 1088 when he attacked Deheubarth, forcing its king, Rhys ap Tewdwr, to flee to Ireland. However Rhys returned later the same year with a fleet from Ireland and defeated the men of Powys in a battle in which two of Cadwgan's nephews, Madog and Rhiryd, were killed. When Rhys ap Tewdwr was killed in 1093, Cadwgan again attacked Deheubarth, but it soon became clear that it was the Normans who would benefit from the death of Rhys. About this time Cadwgan married the daughter of one of the neighbouring Norman lords, Picot de Sai. In 1094 a Welsh revolt against Norman rule broke out, and Cadwgan played a part in this, defeating a Norman force at the battle of Coed Yspwys. Bleddyn was now an ally of Gruffudd ap Cynan, king of Gwynedd, and when Earl Hugh of Chester and Earl Hugh of Shrewsbury launched an invasion in 1098 to try to recover Anglesey for Hugh of Chester, Cadwgan was with Gruffydd. A Danish fleet hired by Gruffudd was offered a higher price by the Normans and changed sides, forcing Cadwgan and Gruffudd to flee to Ireland in a skiff. They were able to return to Wales the following year, and Cadwgan was able to reclaim part of Powys and Ceredigion, on condition of doing homage to Earl Robert of Shrewsbury. For a while Cadwgan was able to strengthen his position. Earl Robert fell out with the king in 1102 and was defeated with the assistance of Cadwgan's brother Iorwerth. Iorwerth took his other brother, Maredudd, captive and handed him over to the king. However many of the lands which Iorwerth had been promised in exchange for his help were given to Norman lords instead, and Iorwerth broke with the king. In 1103 he was arraigned before a royal tribunal and imprisoned, leaving Cadwgan as sole ruler of the parts of Powys not in Norman hands. However, in 1109 Cadwgan's son, Owain ap Cadwgan, fell in love with Nest, wife of Gerald of Pembroke and launched a daring raid on the castle of Cenarth Bychan to abduct her. Cadwgan tried to persuade his son to return Nest to her husband but failed. The justiciar of Shropshire, Richard de Beaumais promised members of other branches of the ruling house of Powys extensive lands if they would join in an attack on Cadwgan and Owain. Ceredigion was invaded and Owain fled to Ireland, while Cadwgan made his peace with the king but was allowed to hold only one border vill. King Henry I of England later allowed him to have Ceredigion back on condition of paying a fine of £100 and promising to have nothing to do with Owain in future. When his brother Iorwerth was killed by Madog ap Rhiryd in 1111, Cadwgan again briefly took over the rule of all Powys, but later the same year Cadwgan himself was also killed by Madog at Welshpool (Welsh: Y Trallwng). Madog was able to seize some of his lands, while the remainder fell to his son Owain."

  "text" : "Charles Thomas Elliott (known as Tom Elliott), FRS, CBE, is a leading scientist in the fields of narrow gap semiconductor and infrared detector research. Hailing from county Durham, after gaining his Ph.D., he worked at the University of Manchester before joining RRE in Malvern, Worcestershire in the late 1960s. In the 1970s he invented the SPRITE detector (Signal PRocessing In The Element) which was also known as the TED (Tom Elliott's Detector). This was a photoconductor device in which the infrared scene was scanned across the detector (made from HgCdTe) at the same rate as the carriers drifted under an applied controlled constant bias current. This device decame part of TICM - the standard UK thermal imaging common module used since the 1980s by UK armed forces. Tom Elliott received a Rank Prize in 1982 for this work and was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1988. Tom Elliott also contributed to the development of the semiconductor indium antimonide (InSb) as an infrared detector, magnetic sensor and fast, low voltage transistor material. He was involved in the exploitation of negative luminescence in diode structures. He retired from the successor to RRE, DERA in 1999 and is an honorary professor at Heriot-Watt University. A conference centre at DERA Malvern (by 2007 QinetiQ) was named 'The Tom Elliott Centre' in his honour when opened by the Princess Royal in 2007."

  "text" : "Clarice Blackburn (February 26, 1921 – August 5, 1995) was an American actress who portrayed three different characters on Dark Shadows. She was born in San Francisco, California but because her father was a salesman, Blackburn and her family moved around a great deal and made their home in Wisconsin, Arizona, Louisiana and Texas after California. She earned a Bachelor's Degree in speech and drama at the Texas State College for Women, then made her professional debut in 1947 on Martha's Vineyard in The Circle of Chalk. An outstanding performance in an Equity Library Theater production of The Great Big Doorstep in 1950 led to a job as understudy for Eva Gabor in The Happy Time on Broadway. The Happy Time starred Shirley Booth, with whom Clarice would appear again on Broadway in The Desk Set in 1955. Clarice's other stage credits included a lead role in a 1953 revival of The Glass Harp, a critically acclaimed lead in American Gothic, also in 1953 and also performed at Circle in the Square; The Infernal Machine in 1958; Juno on Broadway in 1959; The Miracle Worker on Broadway in 1961; and The Queen and the Rebels and Good Day, both in 1965. During the 1965–66 season, Clarice won an Obie Award for Distinguished Performance as Sara Calendar in The Exhaustion of Our Son's Love. Blackburn had extensive experience acting in the soap opera genre. She played a baby nurse & a college dean on the CBS soap opera Love of Life in the early 1960s. She played Theodora Rostand on NBC's soap opera The Doctors from 1965 to 1966, then moved on to ABC's Dark Shadows in the fall of 1966 and over the course of the next four years would play three different characters: Mrs. Sarah Johnson, Abigail Collins and Minerva Trask. When her appearances on the show began to lessen, she gladly accepted the opportunity to create the role of Mary Lou Northcote on the CBS soap opera The Secret Storm during the first half of 1970. Blackburn made a few additional appearances on Dark Shadows, making her final appearance in September, 1970. Even before she made her final appearance on Dark Shadows, Blackburn signed a long term contract to play Amy Snowden on CBS's Where the Heart Is, a role she played until the series left the air in 1973. She moved over to One Life to Live on ABC playing Hattie Frederichs, then back to CBS to As the World Turns playing Marion Connelly, R.N. and finally to Guiding Light where she played Edith Spurrier. In addition to the soaps, Blackburn guest starred in an episode of The Eternal Light entitled \"A Field of Buttercups\" in 1969 and on a Saturday morning children's special, Toby, in 1970.She also guest starred in an episode of the late night TV series Directions. During the 1974–1975 season, Blackburn guest-starred in at least five episodes of the CBS Radio Mystery Theater series. In addition to acting on soaps, Blackburn was a writer for Love of Life and was part of the Emmy-winning writing staff of All My Children. Blackburn's primetime TV credits include guest roles on The Defenders, The Nurses, East Side/West Side, Armstrong Circle Theatre, Dupont Show of the Month, U.S. Steel Hour, Robert Montgomery Presents, The Big Story, Kraft Theatre, Studio One, N.Y.P.D. and the 1967 Xerox TV drama special The Crucible. Blackburn appeared in the motion pictures The Violators, Pretty Poison, Night of Dark Shadows and Man on a Swing. Clarice was asked to bring her Dark Shadows character, Mrs. Johnson, to the big screen in House of Dark Shadows, but at the time she was under contract to The Secret Storm and her schedule on the soap was too heavy for her to get away for the filming. The role was instead played by actress Barbara Cason, who was married to Dark Shadows actor Dennis Patrick. She died in New York City from cancer at age 74."

  "text" : "Christopher \"Chris\" John Chianelli (December 26 1950 – January 20, 2009) was an American radio control expert, television personality, industry icon, and host of The Radio Control Show. This Web TV series is produced by Air Age Media and broadcast biweekly on www.rccaraction.com and www.modelairplanenews.com, and covers all aspects of R/C cars, boats, planes and helicopters, with information ranging from the basics of R/C to tips for the most seasoned pros. Chianelli was born in Mineola, New York. In addition to his hobby work, he was active in several charities, including Make-A-Wish, Habitat for Humanity, and St. Jude's. Chianelli also served as the editor-at-large for Model Airplane News magazine and hosted a Model Airplane News blog. Chianelli became a household name among R/C enthusiasts during the six years he spent as the irreverent host of DIY Network’s Radio Control Hobbies, Workin’ on the Railroad, and Robot Rivals television shows. He also made guest appearances on NBC's Today show and graced the covers of special-interest magazines. Since 1982, Chianelli was a frequent contributor to the industry's top-rated R/C magazines, including Model Airplane News, Radio Control Car Action, Backyard Flyer, Radio Control Helicopter, and Radio Control Boat Modeler, all published by Air Age Media. He was a founding editor of Radio Control Car Action and helped to revitalize Model Airplane News. Chianelli was an internationally-read author of pieces on topics that included R/C aircraft, race boats, cars, trucks, and his specialty—internal combustion engine-performance evaluations. He was dubbed the \"R/C Guru\" because of his unparalleled knowledge of the R/C hobby. Chianelli was an internal combustion miniature-engine expert for both 4- and 2-stroke engines, as well as a master model builder and scale trains enthusiast. In 2005, he received the Hobby Ambassador of the Year award from Hobby Outlook magazine and HobbyTown USA for \"Outstanding Efforts to Expand the Reach of Hobbies\" and for his charitable work. Chianelli’s experience also included stints as creative director for R/C manufacturer Megatech International, which marketed a line of ready-to-fly R/C aircraft with Chianelli’s name and caricature on them, and as a writer for Hobby Merchandiser, a hobby shop industry magazine. His love of modeling began in early childhood with toy trains and slot cars. He bought a used aircraft radio in 1971 and said, \"Ever since that fateful purchase, I've never had a boring moment in my life. So many models, so little time.\" Chianelli was also a fan of full-scale cars and was often photographed in his red Excalibur Series III. On January 20, 2009, Chianelli died of natural causes."

  "text" : "Captain Charles Barnard (1781–c.1840) was a famous castaway. In 1812, the British ship Isabella, captained by George Higton, was shipwrecked off Eagle Island (part of the Falkland Islands). Most of the crew were rescued by the American sealer Nanina which was built and operated out of the whaling port city of Hudson, NY, and commanded by Captain Charles Barnard. Barnard, realizing that the castaways were unaware of the War of 1812, informed the survivors that they were at war with each other, but agreed to rescue the crew. Realizing that they would require more provisions for the expanded number of passengers, Barnard and a few others went out in a party to retrieve more food on the nearby New Island. During his absence, the Nanina was taken over by the British crew, who left them on New Island. Barnard and his party were finally rescued by the British whalers Asp and Indispensable in November 1814. In 1829, Barnard wrote A Narrative of the Sufferings and Adventures of Capt. Charles Barnard detailing the happenings."

  "text" : "Charles Jaco (born August 21, 1950) is an American journalist and author, best known for his coverage of Iraq's invasion of Kuwait and the ensuing Gulf War. Jaco was born August 21, 1950 in Poplar Bluff, Missouri. He graduated from The University of Chicago in 1973, and received a master's degree from Columbia University in 1976. In 1976, he began his broadcast career with WXRT radio in Chicago, Illinois. He worked for NBC Network Radio from 1979 until 1988. In 1987, he was badly beaten by the security forces of Panamanian dictator Manuel Noriega. In late 1988, he became a correspondent for CNN. In 1989 while covering allegations of electoral fraud by the Panamanian government, Jaco was visited by vigilantes of Noriega. He fled the country with the aid of the U.S. military. While covering the Gulf War for CNN in 1991, he proposed to fellow CNN correspondent Pat Neal. He left CNN in 1994 and joined KMOX. He authored Dead Air, a novel about the Gulf War, and Live Shot, a novel set in Cuba. In 2002, he authored The Complete Idiot's Guide to the Gulf War, and in 2003 co-authored The Complete Idiot's Guide to the Politics of Oil. In 2003 he became a reporter and anchor for KTVI television in St. Louis, Missouri, while hosting the station's The Jaco Report. In 2009, he began work at the radio station KTRS 550, doing a daily morning talk show, also titled The Jaco Report. In February 2010 Jaco allegedly bumped into conservative blogger Adam Sharp. Based on Sharp's video of the encounter, the city prosecutor declined to pursue charges against Jaco. In October 2010, Jaco was replaced by J.C. Corcoran at KTRS. In August 2013 Jaco interviewed U.S. Representative Todd Akin on The Jaco Report in which Akin controversially claimed that women rarely become pregnant from \"legitimate rape.\" Jaco left KTVI in 2014."

He was born in Mediaş, studied first in Braşov, and then from 1556 to 1558 at the University of Wittenberg. Ruinae Pannonnicae, his best known work, was written in Latin and composed in dactylic hexameter on the model of Virgil's Aeneid. The subject of the poem deals with the events in Transylvania, Hungary, Wallachia and Moldavia over the 31-year period of 1540 to 1571. Schesaus insists on the Roman origin and heritage of Romanians, backed by evidence he presents (together with proof of Dacian contributions). The work was first printed in Wittenberg (1571), and it ensured that Schesaus was awarded the title of Poet Laureate by Prince Stephen Bathory. Around 1580, Christian Schesaus was living in Biertan; he died of the plague."

  "text" : "Charles Dennis Barney (July 9, 1844 – October 24, 1945) was an American stockbroker and founder of Charles D. Barney & Co., one of the predecessors of the brokerage and securities firm Smith Barney. Barney was born in Sandusky, Ohio, the son of a grain merchant. Barney attended the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, Michigan when the American Civil War broke out. Barney's older brother was killed and at the end of 1862, Barney was permitted by his family to enlist in the U.S Army. After the war, Barney worked briefly as a clerk at a bank in Sandusky. After two years, Barney moved to Philadelphia, where he married Laura E. Cooke, the daughter of prominent Philadelphia financier Jay Cooke, joining the firm of Jay Cooke & Company Following the collapse of his father-in-law's Philadelphia banking house, in 1873, Barney reorganized the firm as Chas. D. Barney & Co. Barney's brother-in-law, Jay Cooke, Jr., joined the new firm as a minority partner. Barney retired from day-to-day control of the firm in 1906 but remained involved through the 1930s. In 1938, Charles D. Barney & Co. and Edward B. Smith & Co. merged to form Smith Barney & Co. Barney died in 1945 at the age of 101 at Elkins Park, Pennsylvania near Philadelphia. At the time of his death, Barney was among the oldest living veterans of the American Civil War. Barney was a director of the Union League of Philadelphia."

Between 1917 and 1939, Elijah and Clara Muhammad had eight children: six boys and two girls, including Warith Deen Muhammad. Known as the First Lady of the Nation of Islam, Muhammad is credited with introducing her husband to the teachings of Nation of Islam founder W.D. Fard. She guided the organization during her husband's absence from 1935 to 1946 as he fled death threats from rival temple leaders and was then incarcerated for sedition during World War II. In the NOIs earliest days she helped establish and run the University of Islam and Muslim Girls Training schools, which provided education for NOI members' children, considered one of the nation's early versions of religious homeschooling. Children's attendance at the schools was considered truancy and resulted in prosecutions and violent confrontations between Temple members and police in Detroit, Michigan and Chicago, Illinois. Clara Muhammad died on August 12, 1972 after a long bout with stomach cancer. Her son, Warith Deen Mohammed, who assumed leadership of the Nation of Islam in 1975, renamed the University of Islam schools the Sister Clara Muhammad Schools in her honor. There are now roughly 75 Clara Muhammad Schools across the country."

  "text" : "Clayton Valli (1951–2003) was a prominent deaf linguist and American Sign Language (ASL) poet whose work helped further to legitimize ASL and introduce people to the richness of American Sign Language literature. Born in Massachusetts, Valli attended the Austine School for the Deaf in Vermont. He earned an A.A.S. in photography from the National Technical Institute for the Deaf at the Rochester Institute of Technology and a B.A. from the University of Nevada, Reno in social psychology. In 1985, he received his M.A. in linguistics from Gallaudet University. His Ph.D. in linguistics and ASL poetics from the Union Institute in Cincinnati, Ohio, which he received in 1993 made him the first person ever to achieve a doctorate in ASL poetry. He was also the first individual to identify the features of ASL poetry as a literary genre in its own right. As a poet, Valli created original works in ASL that he performed to appreciative audiences around the US. His poems make sophisticated use of handshape, movement, use of space, repetition and facial expression. Influenced by canonical American poets like Robert Frost, as well as deaf poets such as Bernard Bragg, Valli often chose nature imagery to convey subtle insights into deaf experience. His brief \"Hands\" — which makes use of the 5 handshape throughout — is a celebration of the power of sign language to describe anything in the universe. \"Dandelion\" uses simple nature imagery to convey the persistence of ASL despite oralists' best efforts to weed it out. He gave workshops and presentations across the US that raised awareness and appreciation for the movement, meter and rhythm in ASL poetry. His own poetic works, which have drawn international recognition for their aestheticism and contribution to literary scholarship, are available on video, performed both by him and by other ASL artists. Valli taught in the Linguistics Department at Gallaudet University. He researched the sociolinguistics of ASL, co-authoring such influential books as Introduction to the Linguistics of American Sign Language and The Gallaudet Dictionary of American Sign Language and numerous articles. He also made an impact in Canada, working at the Ernest C. Drury School for the Deaf in Milton, Ontario. He provided teacher training workshops in ASL poetry for the Ontario ASL Curriculum Team. He helped to pioneer the worldwide movement to develop an ASL-as-a-first-language curriculum for deaf children. Valli died from complications of AIDS. Two scholarship funds are named in his memory at Gallaudet University."

  "text" : "Charles Arthur Conant (July 2, 1861 – July 5, 1915) was an American journalist, author, and promoter who became recognized as an expert on banking and finance. He was descended from one of the earliest New England settlers (Roger Conant) and was born in Winchester, Massachusetts, studied in public schools and with private tutors, and from 1889 to 1901 was correspondent in Washington, D.C. for the New York Journal of Commerce and Commercial Bulletin. In 1901-1902 he was in the Philippines to investigate coinage and banking, on a commission organized by the U.S. Secretary of War. He returned to take a positions as treasurer of the Morton Trust Company of New York where he specialized in overseas banking. In 1915 Elihu Root sent him to Cuba, but he died of a fever there. In retrospect, Conant's most important work consists of journal articles collected in The United States and the Orient, in which he argued, before John A. Hobson and Vladimir Lenin, that imperialism was a natural, necessary, and ultimately positive outgrowth of capitalism. Conant was also among the first economists to articulate the economic utility of speculation on organized stock exchanges. In essays that were collected in the book \"Wall Street and the Country, \"He argued, in what is a familiar formulation today, that stock prices reflect all of the information available about a corporation, economic conditions, etc., and that those prices were thus a measure of a stock's \"true value.\" The trends of the market, he concluded, were an indication of where the nation's capital could most profitably be invested. His main caveat was that pure gambling by uninformed speculators could hurt the market's ability to reflect true values. He urged that speculation only be carried on by experienced investors with the ability to understand and process complex financial and economic information. He wrote many articles for periodicals and encyclopedias on American and on Latin-American finance and trade, and published: \n*  A History of Modern Banks of Issue (1896; fourth edition, 1909) \n*  The United States in the Orient: The Nature of an Economic Problem (1900) \n*  Alexander Hamilton (1901) \n*  Wall Street and the Country (1904) \n*  The Principles of Money and Banking (1905)"

After her death, he commissioned a stained glass window in her memory showing the view from their Connecticut summer home, from the firm of his relative Louis Comfort Tiffany. His publications include History of the Protestant Episcopal Church (1895) and The Prayer Book and Christian Life (1897). Tiffany was the son of Comfort and Laura Tiffany, and related to Charles Lewis Tiffany, founder of Tiffany & Co. jewelers. He served as a pall-bearer at the funeral of the Manhattan jeweler.

While a teacher in San Francisco in the 1930s, he became active in the American Trotskyist movement and joined the newly founded Socialist Workers Party in 1938. The SWP proposed that Charles Cornell go to Coyoacán, Mexico, where Leon Trotsky was living in exile to work as one of his bodyguards. Cornell served on Trotsky’s staff from June 1939 to August 1940. On May 24, 1940, Mexican Stalinists machine-gunned Trotskty's household and subsequently Charles Cornell and Otto Schüssler, one of Trotsky's guards from Germany were arrested by the police. At first the police suspected Trotsky and his secretaries of having organised the raid, but soon realized this to be wrong. After two days and at the personal intervention of Trotsky, both Schüssler and Cornell were released. Cornell, who was present, could not prevent the fatal attack on Trotsky three months later on August 20, 1940 carried out by the Stalinist agent Ramón Mercader, who had infiltrated the household and stabbed him in the back of the head with an icepick. With Joe Hansen, Cornell overwhelmed the assassin and handed him over to the police. On his return to the United States, Charles Cornell remained a member of the Socialist Workers Party in New York City for a couple of years, but never had any important role in the party. Eventually he gave up political activities and went into the real-estate business, first in Connecticut, and later in Arizona. He died on January 1, 1989."

  "text" : "Charles Webster Hawthorne (January 8, 1872 – November 29, 1930) was an American portrait and genre painter and a noted teacher who founded the Cape Cod School of Art in 1899. He was born in Lodi, Illinois and his parents returned to Maine, raising him in the state where Charles' father was born. At age 18, he went to New York, working as an office-boy by day in a stained-glass factory and studying at night school and with Henry Siddons Mowbray and William Merritt Chase, and abroad in both the Netherlands and Italy. In 1908 he was elected into the National Academy of Design as an Associate member and became a full Academician in 1911. [He studied painting under several notable artists] at the National Academy of Design and the Art Students League. Among his teachers were Frank Vincent DuMond and George de Forest Brush. But Hawthorne declared that the most dominant influence in his career was William Merritt Chase, with whom he worked as both a pupil and assistant. Both men were naturally talented teachers and figurative painters who were drawn to rich color and the lusciousness of oil paint as a medium. Chase passed on a Munich tradition of tone values and tone painting, and Hawthorne learned all he could. While studying abroad in the Netherlands as Chase's assistant, Hawthorne was influenced to start his own school of art. His winters were spent in Paris and New York City, his summers at Provincetown, Massachusetts, the site of his school. In addition to founding the Cape Cod School of Art, Hawthorne was also a founding member of the Provincetown Art Association established in 1914. While in Paris Hawthorne became a full member of the French Société Nationale des Beaux-Arts in 1917. The Cape Cod School of Art was the first outdoor summer school for figure painting and grew into one of the nation's leading art schools. Under thirty years of Hawthorne's guidance, the school attracted some of the most talented art instructors and students in the country including John Noble, Richard Miller, and Max Bohm. At his school, Hawthorne gave weekly criticisms and instructive talks, guiding his pupils and setting up ideals but never imposing his own technique or method. Another well known student was Norman Rockwell, who studied with Hawthorne one summer while he was enrolled at the Art Students League. William H. Johnson also studied with Hawthorne and later got a grant from him. Among his works: \n*  The Trousseau, Metropolitan Museum of Art \n*  Mother and Child, Syracuse Museum \n*  Net Mender, Rhode Island School of Design, Providence \n*  Venetian Girl, Worcester Art Museum \n*  The Family, Buffalo Fine Arts Academy \n*  Crew of the Philomena Manta, 1915, Provincetown Art Collection \n*  Fish Cleaners, Provincetown Art Collection \n*  Untitled (Study of girl in white), 1927, Provincetown Art Collection \n*  Girl in Yellow Scarf, 1904, Butler Institute of American Art, Youngstown, Ohio \n*  The Fisherman's Daughter, Corcoran Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C. His class studio in Provincetown on Miller Hill Road (currently known as the Hawthorne School of Art) was added August 21, 1978 to the National Register of Historic Places. His son, Joseph Hawthorne, was a successful orchestral conductor."

Jones settled near Elizabethtown (Brockville) in 1802 and opened a general store. In 1808, Jones built a new district court-house and jail in the town, allowing it to replace Johnstown as the district town. He built saw mills and flour mills west of Brockville and was involved in a number of industries in the area, including mines and ships. He was a member of the Leeds militia and represented Leeds in the 8th and 9th Parliaments in the province. His brother, Jonas, was also a member of the Legislative Assembly. He was appointed to the Legislative Council of Upper Canada in 1828. Jones died in Brockville in 1840."

  "text" : "Charles Curtiss (1908–1993) was an American Communist. Born on July 4, 1908, in Chicago as Samuel Kurz, the son of poor immigrants from Poland, he changed his name to Charles Curtiss and earned his living by working as a miner and sailor, before finally becoming a skilled printer. In 1928, Charles Curtiss joined the Communist League of America, the Trotskyist movement led by James P. Cannon. As a printer, Curtiss took responsibility for producing the movement’s weekly paper The Militant. In 1932, Curtiss moved to Los Angeles to build the Trotskyist movement on the West Coast. In 1938, the Communist League became the Socialist Workers Party. Charles Curtiss, who was fluent in Spanish, was repeatedly sent as a representative of the American Trotskyist movement to Mexico in the 1930s. There he was known as Carlos Curtiss. He also visited Leon Trotsky in Coyoacán several times. From June 1939 to August 1940, Curtiss lived in the Trotsky household and his wife, Lillian Ilstien, who he had married in 1935, served as secretary for Trotsky’s wife Natalia Sedova. Charles Curtiss functioned as Trotsky’s primary link with the Mexican Trotskyists. It would have been illegal and unwise under the terms on which Trotsky was granted asylum in Mexico for Trotsky to maintain direct political contact with radical communist revolutionaries in his host country. Curtiss also tried to resolve the personal differences between Trotsky and the famous Mexican artist Diego Rivera. Charles Curtiss was not present on August 20, 1940, when Trotsky was attacked and killed by the Stalinist agent Ramón Mercader, who had infiltrated the household, but it is said that Curtiss had always been suspicious of Mercader and had warned Trotsky to be careful around him. After the assassination of Trotsky, Curtiss and his wife returned to the United States and the Socialist Workers Party, living and working in Los Angeles for a couple of years. When 18 of the SWP’s most prominent leaders, including James P. Cannon, Farrell Dobbs and Carl Skoglund, were sentenced to jail according to the Smith Act, for opposing US involvement in World War II, Charles Curtiss moved to New York City to help take over the leadership of the party. However, Curtiss was soon drafted into the US army and sent to Italy to fight in the war. After the war, Curtiss returned to the Socialist Workers Party, but he left the party in 1951. However, his wife Lillian remained in the SWP for many years. Charles Curtiss died of heart failure in Los Angeles on December 20, 1993."

  "text" : "Carlos Saura Atarés (born 4 January 1932, Huesca) is a Spanish film director, photographer and writer from Aragon. His name, with those of Luis Buñuel and Pedro Almodóvar forms a triad of Spain’s most renowned filmmakers. He has a long and prolific career that expands for over half a century. A great numbers of his films have won many international awards. Saura began his career in 1955 making documentaries shorts. He quickly gained international prominence when his first feature length film premiered at Cannes in 1960. Although he started filming as a neo-realist, Saura quickly switched to films encoded with metaphors and symbolisms in order to get around the Spanish censors. In 1966, he was thrust into the international spotlight when his film La caza won the Silver Bear at Berlin. In the following years he forged an international reputation for his cinematic treatment of emotional and spiritual responses to repressive political conditions. By the 1970s, Saura was the best known filmmaker working in Spain. His film employed complex narrative devices and were frequently controversial. He won Special Jury Awards for La prima Angélica (1973) and Cría cuervos (1975) in Cannes; and an Oscar nomination for Best Foreign Film in 1979 for Mama cumple 100 años. In the 1980s he was in the spotlight for his Flamenco trilogy – Blood wedding, Carmen, and Love Bewitched. He continued to appear in world wide competitions earning numerous awards. He received Oscar nominations for Carmen (1983) and Tango (1993). His films are sophisticated expression of time and space fusing reality with fantasy, past with present and memory with hallucination. In the last two decades, Saura has concentrated in works uniting music, dance and images."

Prior to it, she was crowned Miss Holland in May 1962. Winning Miss Holland would therefore give her a chance to be crowned Miss International 1962 in Long Beach, California and to succeed compatriot Stam van Baer. Lodders placed 3rd Runner-Up to eventual winner Tania Verstak of Australia. She then also was crowned Miss Benelux, followed by Miss World later that year. She became the second woman (after Corine Rottschafer in 1959) from her country to win the title. The pageant was held in London. Upon winning the contest, she is quoted as saying \"I don't think I'm the most beautiful girl in the world - I am the most beautiful girl here\". On 12 December 1963, as a 21-year-old Dutch model and now former beauty queen from Haarlem, the Netherlands, Lodders accepted the marriage proposal of 22-year-old American millionaire singer/songwriter/dancer Chubby Checker. Checker said he met Lodders in Manila the prior January. They married on 12 April 1964 at Temple Lutheran Church in Pennsauken, NJ. They later raised their children in Paoli, Pennsylvania, where they moved into a fashionable stone and frame colonial house reportedly costing $80–100k. Their first child, Bianca Johanna Evans, was born in Philadelphia on 8 December 1966."

  "text" : "Charles Alphonse Doudiet (1832 - June 13, 1913) was a Canadian artist and digger present at the Eureka Stockade, Ballarat, Victoria (Australia), in 1854. His sketchbook, discovered by his descendants in 1996, has provided contemporary images of events connected to the Eureka Stockade, that were important for the authentication of the original Eureka Flag. Charles Doudiet was born in Geneva, Switzerland. In 1844, at the age of twelve, Doudiet migrated from Switzerland to Canada East. His father, Reverend Jacques-Frederic Doudiet, worked with the French Canadian Missionary Society, a job that required much travelling, which Jacques-Frederic Doudiet documented in a series of sketchbooks. When 20-year-old Charles Doudiet left his home in Belle Riviere near Montreal, he carried a sketchbook like his father, to document his travels. By riverboat, train, then the clipper Magnolia, Doudiet travelled to Melbourne, attracted by the Victorian Gold Rush. On the diggings at Ballarat, Doudiet continued to document events, including the burning of Bentley's Pub on 17 October 1854. Swearing Allegiance to the \"Southern Cross\" is an important historical work because it documents the meeting on Bakery Hill on 1 December 1854. Prior to the discovery of the sketchbook, there was no certain proof that the flag held by the Ballarat Fine Art Gallery was the original flag, as there were several different southern cross flag designs used on the gold fields at that time. Eureka Slaughter shows the troops lined up attacking the stockade on 3 December 1854. Accompanying the sketch is a descriptive passage with the footnote: \"Joyce, Penny and Fletcher along with myself carried Ross to the Star where he died in great pain at about 2am on the 5th\". This refers to fellow Canadian Captain Henry Ross, whom many believe to be the Eureka Flag's designer, who was carried to the Star Hotel after he was mortally wounded in the battle at dawn on 3 December 1854. Doudiet's Melbourne sketchbook ends in 1855, and soon after, Doudiet returned to Canada and married in March 1857. After several years, he studied theology at Queen's College, Kingston, Ontario, and was ordained as a minister in Montreal in 1869. He served several congregations before dying in Hollowell, Massachusetts, on June 13, 1913. After descendants found Doudiet's sketchbook in an attic in 1996, it was put up for sale by auction at Christie's. Money was raised by the Ballarat Fine Art Gallery who purchased the sketchbook to add to the historical collection connected to Ballarat and the Eureka Stockade. In January 2012 an article in The Age newspaper discusses a theory that the work Swearing Allegiance to the Southern Cross  is a forgery, although the writer concluded I don't for a minute believe that Doudiet's watercolours are fake, ...."

Until 1884, his nickname was Charda, which stands for \"flock of cattle\". Since a mockery in his militia work, general Von Drigalsky added \"fon\" (a German preposition denoting aristocratic origin) so his famous nickname appeared — Chardafon.He actively took part in the preparation and proclamation of the Unification of Bulgaria. He was a member of the Bulgarian Secret Central Revolutionary Committee in Golyamo Konare and led a detachment, which entered Plovdiv on 6 November 1885 and took part in the city governor's arrest. After the Unification of Bulgaria, he became a major at the cavalry. Zahari Stoyanov wrote a humorous outline for him, entitled Chardafon the Great."

Fields was born in Port Allen, Louisiana and received his undergraduate and law degrees from Southern University in Baton Rouge. In 1980, he founded the fundraising group Young Adults for Positive Action and in 1987 he was elected to the Louisiana Senate. He ran for Congress in 1990 and was defeated but was re-elected to the State Senate in 1991. He was elected to represent Louisiana's 4th congressional district in the House of Representatives in 1992 and re-elected in 1994. He ran for Governor in 1995, coming second in the jungle primary and then losing in a landslide to Mike Foster. He did not run for re-election to the House in 1996 and his seat was taken by Republican John Cooksey. He was elected back to the State Senate in 1997 and re-elected in 2003, then running unsuccessfully for the Louisiana Public Service Commission in 2004. On October 1, 2007, the Louisiana State Supreme Court ruled that Fields could not stand for re-election to his State Senate seat because of term limits. The state legislature had passed a law in 2006 that had defined the date of the swearing in of Fields and of the intended beneficiary, Shreveport Republican Wayne Waddell, in a way that would have allowed Fields and Waddell to stand for re-election in November 2007 and serve one more term, but the court ruled the law unconstitutional."

  "text" : "Chip Franklin is a nationally known talk show host, writer, producer, comedian and musician. For the last 20+ years, he's been a talk show host, and is currently on KGO in San Francisco, California. He is also former host of a talk show on KOGO in San Diego, California and WBAL AM 1090 in Baltimore, Maryland and at WMAL in Washington DC. The Washington Post's Marc Fisher says \"Franklin adds a rare dose of irony to a medium that rarely trusts its audience to get the joke.” In San Diego and Baltimore, Washington DC, Franklin is also known as a comedian and frequents clubs in the markets. A self-described political independent, Franklin often uses humor to voice his opinion on government policies. He has won 2 National Edward R. Murrow awards and five regional Murrows for his satiric essays on politics. He has also won five Achievement in Radio Best Talk Show Host awards. Talkers Magazine has listed Chip as one of the top 100 talk show hosts in the country for five straight years, most recently at #97 in the 2008 edition of the Heavy 100. Chip started at San Diego's KOGO on September 4, 2007. During his time at KOGO, Chip went through: earthquake, the La Jolla landslide in October 2007, and the October Firestorm. Franklin has appeared numerous times on everything from MTV, Showtime, A&E Evening at The Improv, The O'Reilly Factor, CNN, Paula Zahn, Fox and Friends, The Situation Room, and MSNBC. His series, CURB YOUR INTELLIGENCE, random on-the-street interviews generated national buzz and a feature on CNN in early 2007 when he asked people if they still blamed Barack Obama for 9/11. He has continued with this segment in San Diego, renaming it Arrested Intelligence. The produced segments are available as podcasts at ChipFranklin.com. A show on WBAL 1090 AM that featured the Commissioner of the Baltimore Police Department was subpoenaed by a federal grand jury. Chip Franklin was heard from 9:00 a.m., until noon in Baltimore. A veteran stand-up comic, Chip has headlined thousands of shows as a stand-up, speaker, and featured guest. He has over a dozen appearances on national television, including Evening at The Improv, Comic Strip Live, VH-1 Standup Spotlight, MTV, Comedy Central, The CBS Morning Show, and The A-List on A&E. He has also contributed jokes to The Tonight Show.

  "text" : "Chipps Chippendale (real name William Henry James Chippendale III) is a mountain biking journalist in the UK. After working as a bicycle messenger, his journalistic career started in 1994 with the UK magazine MTB Pro, on which he worked for five years. After the magazine was closed down by its publishers, Future Publishing, who said that there was not enough interest in a magazine about the 'soul' of mountain biking, he left the company and went freelance, contributing to Mountain Biking UK, Total Bike, Maximum Mountain Bike and others. He also wrote for Clarks Originals, for whom he wrote a book about 50 years of the (Clarks) Desert Boot. In early 2000, he started working for 9feet.com, a startup website based on the 'online shop with editorial content' model, specialising in outdoor gear. He worked there for nearly a year until meeting Mark Alker and Shaun Murray, then of www.gofar-mtb.com, a privately run mountain bike website. They suggested he join them and start making a print magazine. The three of them created Singletrack in 2001 with Chippendale as founding editor. He is still the editor and regularly writes and photographs for it. Chippendale is generally credited with popularising singlespeed mountain biking in the UK - an idea he claims to have stolen from Bike magazine's editor Mike Ferrentino - and is a collaborator in The Outcast, an underground singlespeed fanzine. He organised the UK's first Singlespeed National Championships in 1995 (Stow on the Wold) and subsequent ones in 1996, 1997, 1998, 1999 and 2001 (all in Cheddar, Somerset), culminating in organising the Singlespeed World Championships in Afan Argoed in 2001. He is also the organiser of the Todmorden cyclocross race, held every year since 2009 and based on a well-established event that used to take place in the town. Chipps moved to Todmorden in late 2001, coinciding with Singletrack getting its first office. He has been a resident ever since and now calls it home, despite his southern upbringing. Chippendale was awarded the Cycling Media Legend award at the 2015 Cycling Media Awards."

  "text" : "Connor Widdows (born January 27, 1992) is a Canadian actor. He appeared in the second and third film adaptation of the X-Men franchise, X2 and X-Men: The Last Stand, as Jones, a student at Professor Xavier's school who does not need sleep and can control television equipment by blinking. The character was not based on an existing mutant from the X-Men comics. Widdows has previously appeared as Boxey on the Sci Fi Channel television program Battlestar Galactica. Widdows was slated to make several appearances as Boxey, yet never made it past the miniseries and the first few episodes. As executive producer Ronald D. Moore put it, \"Boxey died a hard nasty death on the page and in the editing room, and was last seen haunting the deleted scenes area of the Sci Fi Channel website\". In 2003, Widdows played Cody Banks' younger brother Alex Banks in the movie Agent Cody Banks. He maintained the role in the 2004 sequel, Agent Cody Banks 2: Destination London."

He was a native of Campinas, São Paulo state, son of Bernardino de Campos (who also was a president of that state). He graduated with a law degree from the College of the Plaza of Saint Francis in 1887. Interested in music, he was a composer and founding member of the São Paulo Academy of Letters, and became its sixteenth chairman. His political career began when he was member of the Board of Municipal Intendancy Support in 1890. Shortly afterwards he served as state deputy, from 1895 up to 1915, being Chairman of the Board between 1907 and 1915. In 1896 already he had the busy position of Secretary of State for Justice. Between 1915 and 1918 he was a state senator. Moving up to the federal level, he was representative (1918/1923) and became leader of the majority in the government of President Epitácio Pessoa. He initiated his term as president of the State of São Paulo on May 1, 1924. As state governor, on July 5, 1924, the Lieutenants' Revolution erupted, compelling him to take refuge in Guaiaúna, where the legalist forces were concentrated. Under this administration the Guarda Civil was created, and the Public Force started to count on a flotilla of airplanes. He died in São Paulo, before fulfilling his term, on April 27, 1927. The remaining time in his term was served by the President of the State Senate, Antônio Dino da Costa Bueno, as thirteenth President."

  "text" : "Cory Jermaine Maye (born September 9, 1980), is a former prisoner in the U.S. state of Mississippi. He was originally convicted of murder in the 2001 death of a Prentiss, Mississippi police officer named Ron W. Jones, during a drug raid on the other half of Maye's duplex. Maye has said he thought that the intruders were burglars and did not realize they were police. He pleaded not guilty at his trial, citing self-defense. Nevertheless, Maye was convicted of murder and was sentenced to death. Maye's case attracted little attention until late 2005, when Reason magazine senior editor and police misconduct researcher Radley Balko brought it to light on his blog The Agitator. Balko's research raised several questions about Maye's conviction and in particular about the reliability of medical examiner Steven Hayne, who performed the autopsy on Jones and testified at the trial. According to Maye's supporters, his conviction also brought up issues such as the right to self-defense, police conduct in the War on Drugs, racial and social inequities in Mississippi and whether he received competent legal representation. On September 21, 2006, Maye's death sentence was unexpectedly overturned by Judge Michael Eubanks, who ruled that Maye had received incompetent legal representation during his sentencing phase, and ordered a new sentencing hearing. Maye was sentenced to life in prison. On November 17, 2009, the Mississippi Court of Appeals ruled that Maye's constitutional right of vicinage was violated when Judge Eubanks refused to return the case to Jefferson Davis County, where the alleged crime occurred. The en banc court reversed Maye's conviction and remanded the case for a new trial. The State of Mississippi appealed to the Mississippi Supreme Court, which agreed to hear the case. On December 2, 2010, the Mississippi Supreme Court issued its decision, in which it held that Maye was entitled to a new trial on the ground that the trial court had improperly refused to issue a self-defense instruction that would have highlighted for the jury Maye's right to act in defense of his infant daughter, who was present in the home on the night of the police raid that led to the shooting. On July 1, 2011, Judge Prentiss Harrell signed a plea agreement in which Maye pleaded guilty to manslaughter; Maye was then sentenced to ten years in prison, time he had already served. Maye was transferred to Rankin County, Mississippi for procedural paperwork and out-processing and was released on July 18, 2011."

  "text" : "Charles Spurgeon Johnson (July 24, 1893 – October 27, 1956) was an American sociologist and college administrator, the first black president of historically black Fisk University, and a lifelong advocate for racial equality and the advancement of civil rights for African Americans and all ethnic minorities. He preferred to work collaboratively with liberal white groups in the South, quietly as a \"sideline activist,\" to get practical results. His position is often contrasted with that of W. E. B. Du Bois, who was a powerful and militant advocate for blacks and described Johnson as \"too conservative.\" During Johnson's academic studies and leadership of Fisk University during the 1930s and 1940s, the South had legal racial segregation and Jim Crow discriminatory laws and practices, including having disfranchised most black voters in constitutions passed at the turn of the century. Johnson was unwavering in personal terms in his opposition to this oppressive system, yet worked hard to change race relations in terms of short-term practical gains. His grandson Jeh Johnson served as the United States Secretary of Homeland Security beginning in 2013."

  "text" : "Callicratidas (Greek: Καλλικρατίδας) was a Spartan naval commander in the Peloponnesian War. In 406 BC, he was sent to the Aegean to take command of the Spartan fleet from Lysander, the first navarch. Callicratidas's tenure as navarch was short, and he encountered a number of difficulties. Chief among these were the intrigues of his predecessor, who had apparently returned the money from which the fleet was supposed to be paid for to its source, the Persian prince Cyrus. Callicratidas needed money from Cyrus to pay his men, but, as a traditionalist Spartan, he was loath to request it from a Persian. His halfhearted attempts to secure funding from Cyrus fell through, and he was forced to find an alternative source of funds, which the city of Miletus eventually provided. After winning an initial victory against the Athenian admiral Conon, Callicratidas came up against a sizable Athenian force sent out to relieve Conon. He met this force at the battle of Arginusae in 406 BC. His force was soundly defeated, and Callicratidas himself was killed. After his death, Lysander returned from Sparta to again take up the post of navarch. Callicratidas is remembered as a Spartan of the old school. He disdained the policy of alliance with Persia that had come into favor under Lysander, and he stated that if the choice were his, he would seek peace with Athens. The increasing role of money in Spartan politics and diplomacy offended his traditionalist, antimaterialist sensibilities. Although unsuccessful in his command, he won the respect of many Spartans and allies, and was well regarded after his death."

  "text" : "Connie Kay (born Conrad Henry Kirnon; 27 April 1927 – 30 November 1994) was an American jazz drummer. He was best known for his long membership in the Modern Jazz Quartet (MJQ). He was self-taught, and began his career playing with saxophonist Lester Young's quintet from 1949 to 1955, and also with Stan Getz, Coleman Hawkins, Charlie Parker, Miles Davis and others. Kay did R&B sessions for Atlantic Records in the early to mid-1950s, and featured on hit records such as Big Joe Turner's 'Shake, Rattle and Roll'. Kay joined the MJQ in 1955, replacing original drummer Kenny Clarke, and stayed until the group's dissolution in 1974 and occasional reunions into the 1990s. He also played drums on several of Irish singer/songwriter Van Morrison's most important albums: Astral Weeks, one song on Saint Dominic's Preview and four songs on Tupelo Honey. Kay was known for incorporating percussion instruments alongside his drum kit, namely timpani, small cymbals, triangle, bell tree and darbukas, the latter referred to as \"exotic-looking\" drums in a 2006 article."

  "text" : "Claude Dablon (February 1618 – May 3, 1697) was a Jesuit missionary, born in Dieppe, France. At the age of twenty-one he entered the Society of Jesus, and after his course of studies and teaching in France, arrived in Canada in 1655. He was at once dispatched with Father Chaumonot to begin a central mission among the Iroquois at Onondaga. The diary he kept of this journey and of his return to Quebec in the year following gives a graphic account of the terrifying conditions under which these journeys were made. Many of his diary notes were published during his lifetime in Jesuit Relations. In 1661 he accompanied Father Druillettes, the Apostle of Maine, on an expedition overland to Hudson Bay, the purpose of which was to establish missions among the Native Americans in that region and perhaps to discover an outlet through Hudson Bay to China. The expedition was unsuccessful and is only chronicled as another abortive attempt to find the famous Northwest Passage. In 1668 Dablon was on Lake Superior with Claude-Jean Allouez and Jacques Marquette, forming with them what Bancroft calls the \"illustrious triumvirate\", and he was the first to inform the world of the rich copper mines of that region, which later became so valuable to the Canadian economy. It was Dablon who appointed Marquette to undertake the expedition which resulted in the discovery of the Upper Mississippi River; he also gave Marquette's letters and charts to the world. In connection with this discovery he called attention to the feasibility of passing from Lake Erie to Florida \"by cutting a canal through only half a league of prairie to pass from the end of the Lake of the Illinois (Lake Michigan) to the River of St. Louis\" (the Illinois River). This canal, projected by Dablon, was built in the 1840s as the Illinois and Michigan Canal. After founding Sault Ste. Marie, Dablon became, in 1670, Superior General of all the Canadian Missions, retaining that office until 1680. He was reappointed in 1686 and remained superior until 1693. His contributions to the \"Relations\" are historically valuable with his descriptions of places and people and his narration of events."

  "text" : "Creighton Lee Lovelace (born December 15, 1981) is Pastor of Danieltown Baptist Church in Forest City, North Carolina. Lovelace and his church received brief international attention in May 2005 over a controversial sign on church grounds that stated, \"The Koran needs to be flushed!\" This appeared in The Daily Courier, the local newspaper covering Forest City, in a story written by Josh Humphries shortly after a May 1, 2005, report in Newsweek that United States officials had flushed a Koran down a toilet at Guantanamo Bay (see Qur'an desecration controversy of 2005). That statement proved to be false and Newsweek apologized on May 15. Apparently a Koran had been desecrated in some way, but not involving a toilet. The original report received widespread international attention and sparked protests in Muslim countries. 15 people in Afghanistan died in a protest riot over the story. Lovelace and his church posted the sign as the Newsweek controversy unfolded. This inflammatory message received attention from the Associated Press, all major United States news networks, and various international publications. In a May 25 MSNBC interview, Lovelace denied that his congregation desecrated any actual Korans. Unapologetic for the sign, he said the message was \"a figure of speech.\" In conservative Christian theology Muslims cannot enter heaven. From a Christianity Today story about the Danieltown Baptist Church sign, \"Muslims have a saying: 'Kill me, but do not mock my faith.' In Islamic jurisprudence, blasphemy is considered a capital crime, and the laws of states such as Pakistan reflect this. Muslims around the world will feel this sign is an attack on their honor, and in Muslim cultures honor can only be avenged with blood. Inevitably local Christians in Iraq and Pakistan, missionaries, and anyone with white skin will be considered fair game, as will church buildings.\" No specific attacks on Christians or United States citizens have been linked to this incident. Following two days of intense and universally negative press coverage, Lovelace issued an apology. On June 8, 2005 the Associated Baptist Press reported that Danieltown Baptist Church had withdrawn from the Southern Baptist Convention, the Baptist State Convention of North Carolina and the local Sandy Run Baptist Association. Lovelace graduated from Chase High School in 2000 and was previously active in the school's Future Farmers of America program serving as Chapter President for two terms 1998-2000 and as Western Regional N.C. Vice President (1999–2000). He also advocates a King James Only position by promoting the Defined King James Bible and his annual \"Bible Revivals.\" He is married to Heather Foss. He also served as past state chairman of the North Carolina Constitution Party but left switching his party affiliation to Republican. In 2008 he endorsed U.S. Congressman Ron Paul for president. He is also a member of the Pro Geocentric Association for Biblical Astronomy. In 2011, his first book, It Could Happen To You was published by Tate Publishing of Mustang, Oklahoma."

  "text" : "Charles David Saxon (November 13, 1920 – December 6, 1988) was an American cartoonist. Born in Brooklyn, he graduated from Columbia University in 1940. He worked as an editor at Dell Publishing and served as a bomber pilot in the Army Air Corps during World War II, flying 40 missions over Germany. After the war he rejoined Dell and edited Modern Screen. He also began drawing cartoons on weekends, selling them to The Saturday Evening Post. Then starting in 1956, he became a cartoonist for The New Yorker and is best remembered for his work for the magazine, which included 92 covers and more than 700 cartoons. Many of his cartoons can be found in three collections: Oh, Happy, Happy, Happy! (1960), One Man's Fancy (1970), and Honesty Is One of the \"Better\" Policies: Saxon's World of Business (1984). He also drew numerous ads for American Airlines, Bankers Trust, I.B.M., Xerox and other companies. As his New York Times obituary noted, \"So ubiquitous was his advertising work in the late 1970s that one edition of The Wall Street Journal featured ads by Mr. Saxon for three different companies.\" He received the National Cartoonist Society Advertising Award for 1977, and their Gag Cartoon Award for 1980, 1986, and 1987. For his work with The New Yorker, he received their Reuben Award for 1980. He was married to Nancy Saxon a children's writer and artist. Saxon died of heart failure on December 6, 1988, at St. Joseph Medical Center, Stamford, Connecticut."

  "text" : "Charles Bryant Lang, Jr., A.S.C. (born March 27, 1902, Bluff, Utah – died April 3, 1998, Santa Monica, California ) was an American cinematographer. Early in his career, he worked with the Akeley camera, a gyroscope-mounted \"pancake\" camera designed by Carl Akeley for outdoor action shots. Lang's first credits were as co-cinematographer on the silent films The Night Patrol (1926) and The Loves of Ricardo (1927). After completing Tom Sawyer for Paramount Pictures in 1930, he continued working at the studio for more than twenty years. The style of lighting he introduced in A Farewell to Arms became heavily identified with all of Paramount's films during the 1930s and 1940s, though he occasionally worked for other studios, for instance on The Ghost and Mrs. Muir (1947). In 1951, he began the second phase of his career, this time as a free-lance cinematographer. His credits include The Big Heat (1953) with Glenn Ford and Lee Marvin, Sabrina (1954) with Humphrey Bogart and William Holden, Gunfight at the O.K. Corral (1957) with Burt Lancaster and Kirk Douglas, The Matchmaker (1958), Some Like It Hot (1959) with Marilyn Monroe and Jack Lemmon, The Magnificent Seven (1960) with Steve McQueen, One-Eyed Jacks (1961) with Marlon Brando, How the West Was Won (1962) in Cinerama, Charade (1963) with Cary Grant and Audrey Hepburn, Bob & Carol & Ted & Alice (1969), and Butterflies Are Free (1972). Lang received a Lifetime Achievement Award from the American Society of Cinematographers in 1991, for a career which included at least 114 feature films."

  "text" : "Charles North (born June 9, 1941) is an American poet, essayist and teacher. Described by the poet James Schuyler as “the most stimulating poet of his generation,” he has received two National Endowment for the Arts Creative Writing Fellowships, an Individual Artist’s Grant from the Foundation for Contemporary Arts, four Fund for Poetry awards, and a Poets Foundation award. Born in New York City, North earned his B.A. at Tufts University in 1962 (English and philosophy) and his M.A. at Columbia University in 1964 (English and Comparative Literature). In his mid-twenties, while copy-editing for a publishing company, he began writing poems, studied poetry-writing at The New School with Kenneth Koch, and became associated with the second generation of the New York School, in particular the poetry community at The Poetry Project, where he taught a workshop from 1975-1976. He is currently Poet-in-Residence at Pace University in New York City. North’s first poetry book, the innovative Lineups, was featured in two New York Post sports columns. He has since published nine books of poems, a book of essays on poets, artists, and critics (No Other Way), and collaborative books with the poet Tony Towle and the artist Trevor Winkfield. With Schuyler, he edited the poet/painter anthologies Broadway and Broadway 2, and with the poet Paul Violi he ran the Swollen Magpie Press from 1976-1982."

The family name Adenwalla (\"from Aden\") was a later addition, and is the name by which he is today remembered. Cowasji travelled extensively and set up trading posts in other British possessions/protectorates, most notably on the east-African coast in Zanzibar and Mombasa. He was however best known for his business acumen, and the foresight that Aden would become an important port within the framework of the (modern-day) Suez Canal. He had an entire floating dock shipped from Britain in 1895 and was known locally as \"Dinshaw Pontoon\". Although of the Zoroastrian faith (and founder of the Fire Temple in Aden), he also financed the construction of a mosque for the local Muslim population, which is known as Cowasji Masjid after him."

  "text" : "Carol Grace (September 11, 1924 – July 21, 2003) was an American actress and author. She is usually referred to as Carol Marcus Saroyan or Carol Matthau. Carol Grace was born in New York City's Lower East Side; her mother, who was sixteen when she gave birth, was the daughter of Russian Jewish immigrants. Carol never knew her biological father. She was placed in foster care until the age of eight when her mother married Charles Marcus, the wealthy head of the Bendix Corporation. Carol would take his last name as her own. She was reportedly the inspiration for the Holly Golightly character in Truman Capote's novella Breakfast at Tiffany's. She was twice married to Pulitzer Prize-winning writer William Saroyan over an eight-year period. The couple had two children: Aram Saroyan, an internationally known writer, and the late actress Lucy Saroyan, who died in 2003. She subsequently married actor Walter Matthau on August 21, 1959. The couple remained wed until his death on July 1, 2000; they had one son, Charles. She had a wide social circle and was known for her wit and good company. In 1955 she published a novella based on her experiences as a foster child, The Secret in the Daisy. In 1992 she published a memoir, Among the Porcupines. Carol Saroyan Matthau died of a cerebral aneurysm on July 21, 2003, aged 78. She was survived by her two sons and a sister, Elinor Dee Pruder."

He was born Valentine John Cecil De Vere Mathews in 1846; it is likely that he was the illegitimate son of William Cecil De Vere, a naval officer and son of the second Baronet of Curragh. His mother was Katherine Mathews, a Welsh-born household servant.He played chess effortlessly and elegantly without recourse to chess study or theory; in this respect he was not unlike José Raúl Capablanca. His meteoric rise to fame and equally dramatic decline has been compared to Paul Morphy and he is often cited as 'The English Morphy'. His great natural talent for the game was attended by an equal indolence for work. Cecil De Vere contracted tuberculosis around 1867 and later became dependent on alcohol. He lived in London for most of his life but was sent to Torquay by his chess friends in 1874 in the vain hope of recuperation. He died in Torquay, UK, aged 29, and is buried there."

  "text" : "Charles the Child (Latin Karolus puer, from the Annales Bertiniani; 847/848, Frankfurt am Main – 29 September 866, Buzançais) was the King of Aquitaine from October 855 until his death in 866. If his father, Charles the Bald, and great grandfather, Charlemagne, are counted as rulers of Aquitaine, he would be numbered Charles III. He was the second son of Charles the Bald and brother of Louis the Stammerer. The younger Charles was appointed by his father, who had previously ruled as King of Aquitaine himself from 838, as a sop to Aquitainian separatism. The Aquitainians had previously rebelled against Charles the Bald, requesting from Louis the German that he send one of his sons to rule over them. Louis had sent his second son, Louis the Younger, prompting Charles the Bald to release his rival claimant to Aquitaine, Pippin II. Pippin succeeded in rallying the nobles to support himself and Charles the Bald against Louis the Younger, who was driven out. By October, however, Pippin lost his popularity with the still-rebellious Aquitainians, prompting Charles the Bald to appoint Charles the Child as King. Charles the Child was duly anointed at Limoges. Within a year, he had been replaced by the Aquitainians with Pippin II. These same then deposed Pippin and restored Charles the Child. Pippin was captured in 864 and imprisoned at Senlis, at which point he disappears from history. Unlike previous sub-kings of Aquitaine, (Louis the Pious, Pippin I, Pippin II), Charles the Child had no real authority at all. Before 840, the kingdom had been ruled in person by an autonomous king; Charles the Bald, however, after his accession as King of Western Francia, attempted to maintain power in Aquitaine. Consequently, Charles the Child, and his brother, Louis the Stammerer, did not rule in person, had no chancery, could issue no instruments; they were no longer empowered to bestow privileges, endow religious establishments, or dispose of royal property. All the rights of the region were invested in Charles the Bald, in whose absence the nobles of the Kingdom gathered power. Nonetheless, as Charles grew older, he began to exercise what little personal authority he could. For example, in 862 he chose and married a wife against the will of his father. The name of his wife is unknown, although she was apparently the widow of a count named Humbert. Charles the Bald reasserted his power over his son in 863, forcing the younger Charles to put away his wife and be loyal to his father. A year later, he was accidentally struck with a sword in the head by a member of his own hunting party in a mock combat, leading Ado of Vienne to say that \"Charles was dishonoured (dehonestatus) by having suffered it\". The blow left him mentally incapacitated until his resultant death in 866. He died childless and was buried in Bourges."

  "text" : "Corrado Cagli (Ancona, 1910–Rome, 1976) was an Italian painter of Jewish heritage, who lived in the United States during World War II. Cagli was born in Ancona but he moved with his family to Rome in 1915 at the age of five. In 1927, he made his artistic debut, with a mural painted on a building in Via Sistina. The following year, he made another mural painting in a hall in Via Vantaggio. In 1932, he held his first personal exhibition at the Gallery of Art of Rome. Together with other artists such as Giuseppe Capogrossi and Emanuele Cavalli, he formed the group \"New Roman School of Painting,\" better known as Scuola Romana. In 1937 and 1938, he exhibited works at the \"Comet\" gallery in New York City. In 1938, when Benito Mussolini stepped up the persecution of Jews, Cagli fled to Paris and later went to New York where he became a U.S. citizen. He enlisted in the U.S. Army and was involved in the 1944 Normandy landings, and fought in Belgium and Germany. He was with the forces that liberated the Buchenwald concentration camp, and made a series of dramatic drawings on that subject. In 1948, Cagli returned to Rome to take up permanent residence there. From that time forward, he experimented in various abstract and non-figurative techniques (neo-metaphysical, neo-cubist, informal). He was awarded the Guggenheim prize (1946) and the Marzotto prize (1954). Cagli died at Rome in 1976."

Hall also recorded a series of soul music singles in the 1960s and 1970s, starting with an unsuccessful period on Mercury Records, where one of his producers was Quincy Jones. He then joined forces with leading New York R&B producer, Jerry Ragovoy to cut the now much sought-after tracks, \"You don't know nothing about love\" / \"Mean it baby\" (1967) and \"I don't want to be your used to be\" / \"The dam busted\" for the Warner Brothers subsidiary label, Loma Records, using a strong gospel-inspired style. Ragovoy also produced another single on Atlantic in 1972 and then the following year, a now in-demand track called \"What About You\" on Columbia. He co-wrote and co-produced his final single for small NYC label, Martru in 1987. Hall, who also was known as C. Henry Hall or Carl Henry Hall, also appeared on Broadway in the stage production of the musical The Wiz, among other shows."

He is one of the ten youngest people to ever be elected to the United States House of Representatives, at the age of 25. Mobley was born near Hillsboro, Jones County, Georgia; attended the common schools; and graduated from Mercer University with a law degree in 1928. While at Mercer, he was a member of Sigma Pi Fraternity. Mobley practiced law in Forsyth, Georgia before serving as secretary to Congressman Samuel Rutherford from 1929 to 1932. In 1932, Mobley was elected as a Democrat to the United States House of Representatives representing Georgia's 6th congressional district (Rutherford had died in office; Mobley was elected in a special election to replace him). Mobley did not seek reelection. Subsequently, Mobley served in Georgia's Executive Department from 1934 to 1937; as an Assistant Attorney General of Georgia from 1941 to 1943; as a Lieutenant Commander in the United States Navy from 1943 to 1946; and as a Justice on the Supreme Court of Georgia from 1954 to 1974, including a term as Chief Justice from 1972 to 1974.

  "text" : "Florindo Eleuterio Flores Hala, known as Comrade Artemio (born September 8, 1961) is a former leader of the Peruvian Maoist group Shining Path. Along with Comrade Alipio, he was one of the highest-ranking members of the Shining Path who had not been imprisoned or killed. However, on February 12, 2012, he was captured by a combined force of the Peruvian Army. Flores went to high school in Camana, Camana Province, Arequipa Department. He served in the Peruvian Army in the 221 Tank Battalion in Locumba, Tacna in 1979. He ended his service in December 1980. His face appears in the August 1989 video where Comrade Gonzalo appears dancing \"Zorba the Greek\" with all the Shining Path high command. Very little was known about Comrade Artemio. He has appeared on video tapes, but always wearing a ski mask, often with an extra piece of cloth sewed on to hide his eyes. Messages supposed to have been written by him make the claim that he is only the regional commander of the Shining Path for the Huallaga Valley, implying that he is not the leader of the entire movement. This might be because he takes the imprisoned former leaders (Abimael Guzmán and Óscar Ramírez Durand) to be the true leaders and doesn't believe their orders for the Shining Path to lay down its arms. On September 26, 2006, a news crew from the television show Panorama interviewed Artemio in a jungle base established by Shining Path. They also filmed about 50 Shining Path militants, all of whom were masked. Artemio demanded that the Peruvian government grant amnesty to imprisoned Shining Path members and open a peace dialogue with the remaining Shining Path members. Days after the report, the National Police raided the site where Artemio gave the interview. Some Shining Path members were arrested, but Artemio was not. In November, 2007, police claimed to have killed Artemio's second-in-command, a guerrilla known as JL. In September, 2008, Artemio gave his first recorded interview since 2006. In it he stated that the Shining Path would continue to fight despite escalating military pressure. On December 7, 2011, it was reported that 'Comrade Artemio' had admitted that the Shining Path were defeated. He is said to have offered 'dialogue' with the government regarding disarmament. The next day, the BBC released an interview with \"Comrade Artemio,\" identified as Florindo Eleuterio Flores-Hala. Flores-Hala admitted \"mistakes\" in continuing the Shining Path's war effort, and said he was ready to negotiate terms with the Peruvian government. On February 12, 2012, Artemio was captured by a combined force of the Peruvian Army and the Police. Doctors removed two bullets from his stomach. On June 7, 2013 Artemio was sentenced to life in prison and ordered to pay 500 million soles in civil reparations."

  "text" : "Charles V. Ryan (born c. 1928) is a former mayor of the city Springfield, Massachusetts. He served as the Mayor of Springfield from 1962 to 1967 and again from 2004 to 2008. Ryan served as the city's mayor during the 1960s for three terms and for two additional terms beginning in 2004, making him the only Springfield mayor to serve in two different centuries. His terms in the 60's occurred during a time of civil unrest and controversial urban renewal projects. Ryan was unsuccessful in preventing the closure of the Springfield Armory, a major economic blow to Springfield that he blamed on then Congressman Edward P. Boland. Ryan ran against Boland for Congress in 1968, but was defeated in a landslide. After leaving office he became a prominent attorney and continued to be active in public affairs, serving as a member of the downtown economic development group Springfield Central and leading efforts to successfully defeat attempts to institute casino gambling. He also led successful efforts to place the privately owned Springfield libraries under public control. He attempted to return to the mayoralty in 1995 but lost to City Councilor Michael J. Albano. Ryan was elected mayor in 2003 following the decision of Albano not to seek reelection. He defeated the Albano endorsed State Senator Linda Melconian in a campaign that focused on the numerous corruption scandals of the Albano years. In November 2005, Ryan won reelection defeating the city's School Committee Vice-President, Thomas Ashe. On April 12, 2007, Ryan announced that he would run for re-election in the city's municipal election and stated that this would be his final run. He lost this election to City Councilor Domenic Sarno. Now formally retired, Ryan is still a frequently seen figure at political and social events. Ryan's critics suggest the controversial urban renewal projects promulgated and overseen by his administrations during the 1960s disfigured Springfield's downtown and North End. They count the destruction of historic sites, such as the house occupied by abolitionist John Brown, among the lasting legacies of Ryan's first terms as mayor."

Supporters of Manning accused Obama of jeopardising Manning's chances of receiving a fair trial. Marinucci was punished by the White House which withdrew her privileges. The White House was then accused of hypocrisy. The San Francisco Chronicle accused the White House of a \"credibility gap on press coverage\".Carla also appears on the Ronn Owens KGO talk show in San Francisco."

  "text" : "Cadwgan also known as Cadwgan of Llandyfái or Martin (died 11 April 1241) was a Welsh cleric who was Bishop of Bangor from 1215 to 1236. According to Giraldus Cambrensis, Cadwgan was the son of an Irish priest and a Welsh mother. The annals state that he was the son of a priest famous for the eloquence of his Welsh preaching. He was Abbot of the Cistercian Abbey of Whitland. Cadwgan is sometimes referred to as Martin, which may have been his monastic name. He was consecrated as Bishop of Bangor by the Archbishop of Canterbury on 21 June 1215 at Staines. Cadwgan probably owed his election to Llywelyn the Great, who was determined to have a Welsh rather than a Norman or English bishop and was by now powerful enough to get his way. In 1234 he brought a shipload of corn from Ireland to feed the poor of his diocese. He entered the Cistercian abbey of Dore in Herefordshire in 1236 to live there as a monk, and died there on 11 April 1241. He wrote a theological work entitled De modo confitendi."

  "text" : "Carlo James Curley (August 24, 1952 – August 11, 2012) was an American classical concert organist who lived much of his later life in Great Britain. Curley was born into a musical family in Monroe, North Carolina, USA, and attended the North Carolina School of the Arts and by the age of 15 was organist at a large Baptist church in Atlanta, Georgia. He subsequently studied with Virgil Fox, Robert Elmore, George Thalben-Ball and Arthur Poister. His long-time friend and confidant Robert Noehren was another noted influence. At 18 he was director of music at Girard College in Philadelphia. Curley developed his performance style in the manner of Virgil Fox, with respect to popularising classical organ music popular to a wider audience, which included his arrangements and transcriptions of pieces from other classical genres. He was the resident organist at the Alexandra Palace in the 1970s and was the first classical organist to perform a solo organ recital at the White House, He also played before several European heads of state and toured extensively throughout the world, earning the marketing nickname \"the Pavarotti of the Organ\". he was one of only a few concert organists worldwide who supported themselves exclusively by giving recitals, concerts and master classes, without any supplement from teaching or church position. Curley used a substantial Allen touring organ where the venue lacked an instrument of sufficient scope to support his repertoire. He recorded commercially for various labels such as RCA, ProArte, Rediffusion and Decca International. He participated in several 'Battle of the Organs' concerts, and his final such concert was in June 2012 at Liverpool Anglican Cathedral with his friend Ian Tracey. He served as patron for numerous music societies as well as for the newly formed British Academy of Music. He was involved in organ design and construction and served as advisor to numerous clients, including Melbourne City Council (Australia), and The Cube, Shiroishi (Japan). His autobiography In The Pipeline was published by HarperCollins in 1998. One of his organs is now used in the Cathedral of St Michael and St George in Aldershot in the UK. A life-long bachelor, Curley died on Saturday, August 11, 2012, at age 59, in Melton Mowbray, England. His ashes are interred in the grounds of Pershore Abbey in the UK."

  "text" : "Carlo Sellitto (1581 – 2 October 1614 in Naples) was an Italian painter of the Baroque period. One of the most gifted followers of Michelangelo Merisi da Caravaggio (1571–1610), Sellitto played an important role in the spread of Caravaggism to Naples and in the development away from Late Mannerism to a greater naturalism. The son of a painter and gilder, he was apprenticed briefly to the Piedmontese painter Giovanni Antonio Ardito (c. late 16th century–early 17th) before moving (c. 1591) to the studio of the Flemish painter Louis Croys. By 1608, at the age of 27 years, he had left Croys and had set up his own workshop in the Via Donnalbina, attracting to it such artists as Filippo Napoletano, Giovan Mattea Arciero (b 1591) and Francesco Abbenante (first decade of the 17th century). The talent for portraiture that Sellitto had shown while working with Croys brought him commissions from the court and aristocracy, although none of these documented works has been identified. Sellitto would have known Caravaggio during the artist's exile in Naples in 1606/1607, but the date indicates that this Baptist (illustrated) was painted several years previously - cf. Caravaggio's own treatment of the theme of John the Baptist. He died on 2 October 1614 after a brief 6-year independent career."

  "text" : "Born Carlos de Oliveira, Carlinhos grew up in Rio de Janeiro in the 1940s. He was immersed in samba, a style of music with roots in both Africa and Portugal. Its most famous expression is in the poor and working-class neighborhoods surrounding Rio, called favelas, which host performing associations known as samba schools. These groups compete every year in Rio’s spectacular Carnaval parade, with thousands of dancers in feathered costumes and hundreds of drummers playing samba rhythms. One drum that can perform all the rhythms of the samba is Brazil’s national instrument, the pandeiro. (The pandeiro is a tunable tambourine, played with a different technique than in North American music.) Carlinhos took up the pandeiro at age seven, starting with one of his mother’s cake pans. He visited the favelas to absorb samba styles, particularly at one of the greatest samba schools, GRES Estação Primeira de Mangueira. Carlinhos would join in during rehearsals, and he soon came to the attention of Mangueira’s legendary singer, Jamelão, who invited Carlinhos to become a performing member of Mangueira, a high honor. Carlinhos’s pandeiro playing became quite theatrical, with unprecedented juggling and stunts (known as malabarismo). Soon Carlinhos was performing professionally, working with most important musicians and composers in Rio. In 1966, Brazil held a national contest to find the country’s best pandeiro player. Carlinhos out-performed 500 other players to win the first ‘Golden Tambourine’ award, thereby becoming known as Carlinhos Pandeiro de Ouro. With this recognition, Carlinhos represented Brazil in performances before the Japanese royal family, the Swedish royal family, and also in a command performance for Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Phillip of England. Carlinhos has had a wide-ranging career as a percussionist, appearing in Brazilian films, on Brazilian television, and performing around the world with Herbie Mann, Sergio Mendes, Sadao Watanabe, Ed Thigpen, Toots Thielemans, Martinho da Vila, Beth Carvalho, Maria Bethania, and many more. Carlinhos married an American singer in 1983, moved to Hawaii, and raised a family. For the last three decades, he has led parades, performed with numerous American samba bands, and taught ‘classic’ Rio-style samba to thousands of students. Today, Carlinhos lives in Los Angeles, performing nationally and teaching locally, at the 18th Street Arts Center in Santa Monica. He is a recipient of awards from the Durfee Foundation, the Alliance for California Traditional Arts, and the Department of Cultural Affairs, Los Angeles. On Friday, June 24, 2011, the National Endowment for the Arts announced that Carlinhos was one of 2011’s NEA National Heritage Fellowship Recipients."

  "text" : "Lieutenant-General Charles Schaw Cathcart, 9th Lord Cathcart KT (21 March 1721 – 14 August 1776) was a British soldier and diplomat. He was also chief of the Clan Cathcart. The son of Charles Cathcart, 8th Lord Cathcart and Marion Shaw, he was born on 21 March 1721. Opposed to the restoration of the Stuart monarchy, he became an aide-de-camp to the Duke of Cumberland and during the Battle of Fontenoy in 1745, was shot in the face. Joshua Reynolds' portrait (1753-5) shows the black silk patch he used to cover the scar on his cheek. This seemingly earned him the soubriquet 'Patch Cathcart'. The following year at the Battle of Culloden, again acting as ADC to Cumberland, Cathcart was once more wounded in battle. On 24 July 1753 he married Jane Hamilton (1722–1771), daughter of Captain Lord Archibald Hamilton and Lady Jane Hamilton. They had seven children: \n*  Jane (b. 20 May 1754 - 1790), first wife of the fourth Duke of Atholl. \n*  William Cathcart, 1st Earl Cathcart (b. 17 Sept. 1755–1843) \n*  Mary (b. 1757 - 26 June 1792), a celebrated beauty, who married Thomas Graham, 1st Baron Lynedoch  \n*  Charles (b. 1760 - 10 June 1788) \n*  Louisa (b. 1761) \n*  Archibald (b. 1765) \n*  Catherine Charlotte (b. 1770) Charles was the last Lord Cathcart to inherit the family estate of Sundrum. Upon inheriting his mother's estates in Greenock he sold Sundrum to James Murray of Broughton in 1758. In 1763 he was created a Knight of the Order of the Thistle. In February 1768 he was appointed ambassador at St Petersburg and was well received by Catherine the Great. He served at the Russian court until 1772. On his return to Britain he was elected Rector of Glasgow University in 1773. He died on 14 August 1776."

  "text" : "Charles C. \"Charlie\" Plummer served as the sheriff of the Alameda County Sheriff's Office for Alameda County, California from 1987 to 2007. He is believed to have been the longest serving police officer in California with more than 50 years of continuous service. He is a well known figure in the California law enforcement community. Plummer worked to get the ACSO certified by the Commission on Accreditation for Law Enforcement Agencies (CALEA), the American Correctional Association (ACA), National Commission on Correctional Health Care (NCCHC) and the California Medical Association (MA). Three of these accreditations are known as the \"Triple Crown\" and are considered a high honor in the law enforcement community. The ACSO is one of a handful of agencies to hold this distinction nationwide. Throughout his career, Plummer had been known to impose strict limits on the issuance and distribution of Concealed Weapons permits to Alameda County residents, maintaining that citizens should be required to show a legitimate need for protection before the permit would be issued. In the year 2000, a total of only 150 concealed weapons permits were issued, out of the thousands of applicants. In addition, Plummer required that permit holders carry liability insurance for $1,000,000 and demonstrate to his Department's rangemaster that the applicants were proficient in the use of firearms. Plummer was a field commander for the Berkeley Police Department when riots erupted in People's Park in 1969. Prior to being elected as sheriff, he was the Chief of Police for Hayward, California. Plummer retired 13 January 2007 after serving five terms as sheriff. Gregory J. Ahern, a 26 year veteran of the sheriff's office, was elected to succeed him. Plummer continues to work one or two days a week at the department's Office of Emergency Services as an unofficial \"sheriff emeritus.\" On January 8, 2007, at his retirement ceremony celebrating 50-plus years in law enforcement, outgoing Alameda County Sheriff Charles Plummer remained unrepentant about his role as a Berkeley police officer during the People's Park riots: \"I wish I would have hit some people harder during the riots,\" said Plummer, speaking of the riots in Berkeley in the late-1960s. \"I regret that.\""

After defecting from the Nacionalista Party with its left wing allies, he became one of the founders (1922) and early leaders of the increasingly Marxist Partido Obrero, which became the Progressive Workers Party. Around it, he formed a new trade union federation, one that was more radical in its goals. On November 7, 1930, the 13th anniversary of the October Revolution, Evangelista reformed his group as the Partido Komunista ng Pilipinas and subsequently led it briefly until it was banned on October 26, 1932 by the Supreme Court of the Philippines. Jailed towards the end of the decade, Evangelista was involved in informal talks with President Manuel L. Quezon, negotiating a social peace. He was arrested by invading Japanese troops along with Pedro Abad Santos, and Guillermo Capadocia, and executed after an attempt to use him as a bargaining tool in contacts with the Hukbalahap."

  "text" : "Christian Worch (born March 14, 1956) is a prominent German right-wing nationalist activist and chairman of the right-wing political party Die Rechte. In 1974 Worch started a militant group called the Hansabande in Hamburg, along with Michael Kühnen. The group defaced Jewish graveyards, assaulted leftists and foreigners, and denied the Holocaust. Worch took part in one especially well-known campaign under the motto \"I am an ass to believe that Jews were gassed in Germany\" (Ich Esel glaube, daß in Deutschland Juden vergast worden sind). The group gradually became the Aktionsfront Nationaler Sozialisten (ANS, Action Front of National Socialists) in 1977. Worch and Kühnen were also close to the now-banned Wiking-Jugend (Viking Youth). Kühnen was arrested in 1979 and Worch took over leadership of the ANS. In 1980 he was convicted, receiving a three-year prison sentence, despite being defended by Jürgen Rieger during his trial. In 1983, the organization, now known as the ANS/NA (Aktionsfront Nationaler Sozialisten/Nationale Aktivisten, Action Front of National Socialists/National Activists) was banned, so Worch joined the Free German Workers' Party (FAP) and became vice-chairman. As the Nationale Liste (National List) was founded in 1989, he became active in its executive committee. He edited its magazine, Index, until September 1991 and was especially active in Anti-Antifa work. In this campaign, lists of names and addresses of left-wing and anti-fascist activists and organizations were published; this led to attacks on some of the people listed. Worch was one of the main initiators of the campaign. After Kühnen died in 1991, Worch, along with Winfried Arnulf Priem and Gottfried Küssel, took over the Gesinnungsgemeinschaft der Neuen Front (GdNF); this led to him receiving a two-year suspended sentence in 1994. He had to serve this jail time beginning in February 1996 because he continued the ANS/NA despite its having been banned, but he was released early in 1997. For a short time in the 1990s, Worch had close relations with the National Democratic Party of Germany (NPD) and was a link between neo-Nazi groups and the NPD. In an interview, he defended his collaboration with the party, saying that \"the NPD is as a party, of course, only a means to propagate our worldview\". However, he has since distanced himself from the party. Worch also collaborates with Gary Lauck's NSDAP/AO (1972), and is known as one of the main organizers of the Rudolf Hess Memorial March, which takes place once a year in Wunsiedel, Bavaria, where Rudolf Hess is buried, and is one of the most important events for European neo-Nazis."

  "text" : "Charles A. Weaver (born April 11, 1845),(died February 19, 1906), of Moundsville, a notably successful business man, was born in York County, Pennsylvania. His father, Elijah Weaver, a native of Maryland, was a whip manufacturer by occupation, and died in 1878, at the age of sixty-one. By his wife, Caroline Erb, a native of Ireland, he had six children, the oldest of whom is Charles A. The latter embarked in the whip manufacture at the age of twenty, and though burned out in the year 1869, his business became more proportions than before. His establishment manufactured about eighty dozen whips per day, and turned out about half the leather whips used in the United States at one time. In this manufacture he is associated with John C. Bardall under the style of Weaver & Bardall, and he is also a member of the firm of Weaver & Humphreys, manufacturers of brooms, the product of whose establishment is about 125 dozen per day. Mr. Weaver's energies as a manager and financier are not confined to these extensive industries. He is also president of the Marshall County Bank, of which he is a founder. Charles is also a charter member of the Moundsville Coal company and director of the same. He is also a stockholder and director of Citizens' Natural Gas company in Beaver, Pennsylvania. Finally, he has business interests in Wheeling, and at various places in Pennsylvania and the west. His prominence as his election has recognized a citizen to the office of mayor, and he is now a member of the council. Socially he held a high rank, was a Mason of the degree of Knight Templar, and with his wife was a member of the Methodist Episcopal church. Few men in West Virginia were more prominent in business and financial circles. His success is creditable, and founded on integrity of character, alertness in affairs and superior executive ability. Mr. Weaver married December 24, 1867, to Mary Etta Richardson, daughter of W. F. and Mary Richardson, of Pittsburgh, and seven children have been born to them: May E., Charles A., William F., Harry E., Carrie, deceased, Mary Etta and Walter M."

  "text" : "Chararic or Chararich was the King of Galicia (c. 550 – 558/559) according to Gregory of Tours, who is the only primary source for a Suevic king of this name. Following Gregory's account (the Historia Francorum, written between 573 and 579), leprosy was a common disease in Galicia during the mid-sixth century and the king's son was a victim. The Suevi at that time were Arians, but Chararic, having heard of Martin of Tours, promised to accept the beliefs of the saint if only his son would be cured, and so he sent for some relics from Tours. When the relics were brought to Galicia and his son was healed by the intercession of Saint Martin, Chararic and the entire royal household converted to the Nicene faith. Gregory also notes that on the same day that Martin's relics entered the Galician harbour, another ship was landing bearing Martin of Dumio, future archbishop of Braga and saint. Gregory is unreliable on this point, however, because he adds further in his De Virtutibus S. Martini that the relics and the future bishop had both left on their journeys to Galicia on the same day as well, but as the relics travelled velociter and Martin travelled from Pannonia, their trips could not have been of identical length. Gregory's account has come under criticism in modern times, largely because it is at odds with the other accounts of the Catholicisation of the Suevi, namely Isidore of Seville, John of Biclaro, and the minutes of the First Council of Braga. If, as Gregory relates, Martin died about the year 580 and had been bishop for about thirty years, then the conversion of Chararic must have occurred around 550 at the latest. Attempts to fix the chronology and the identities of the three kings associated with the Catholicisation—Chararic, Theodemir, and Ariamir—have been numerous. Reinhart suggested that Chararic was converted first through the cure of his son and that Theodemir was converted later through the preaching of Martin of Dumio. It has also been alleged that if Chararic existed he must have been a successor of Ariamir's, since Ariamir was the first Suevic monarch to lift the ban on Catholic synods. Ferreiro believes the conversion of the Suevi was progressive and stepwise and that Chararic's public conversion was only followed by the lifting of a ban on Catholic synods in the reign of his successor, which would have been Ariamir. Chararic has also been equated with Theodemir, some even saying that the latter was the name he took upon baptism (Dahn). It has also been suggested that Theodemir and Ariamir were the same person and the son of Chararic. In the opinion of some historians, Chararic is nothing more than an error on the part of Gregory of Tours and never existed. Chararic introduced the cult of Martin of Tours to Galicia and made him the beatus patronus of the province. He died no later than 1 May 559 and no earlier than 2 May 558, the dates between which Ariamir succeeded to the throne."

Around 1971, he discovered the anomalous dispersion of numerous dyes, including aniline red (fuchsine), by recording absorption spectra. In 1884, he confirmed the Stefan–Boltzmann law. Christiansen was elected a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in 1902. He was doctoral advisor to Niels Bohr. In 1912, he retired and Martin Knudsen became professor."

  "text" : "C.J. Rapp is an American beverage inventor best known for inventing and marketing high-caffeine Jolt Cola. In 1985, C. J. Rapp developed Jolt Cola, which contains 72 milligrams of caffeine, which is the maximum amount permitted by the US Food and Drug Administration. He attended McQuaid Jesuit High School in Rochester, New York. As a sociology major at SUNY Potsdam, Rapp noticed that students concocted beverages to help them stay awake to finish term papers, complete research projects, or study for exams. At a time when beverage producers were promoting the idea that less is better - that they contained either zero or less caffeine, sugar, or calories - Rapp promoted his cola by emphasizing that it had twice the caffeine found in other colas. In the mid-1980s the slogan on every bottle and can of Jolt read \"Twice the Caffeine.\" The approach worked and gave the new product high visibility. Jolt soon appeared on the David Letterman show, Good Morning America and CNN. The maverick cola quickly found its niche market. Rapp slowly began expanding his product line, which now includes Blu Botl, DNA, Martinelli’s, Pirate’s Keg, First Tee, and XTC. His company, Wet Planet Beverages, markets ten beverage brands in 22 countries. The company tends to use creative packaging."

He was Chief Editor of New Light of Burma:. Later his own Journal Kyaw Newspaper ( The Weekly Thunderer) was well known in Burma. He was born in Okpho, Thayarwady District, and studied at Latpatan Town High School. After he passed high school, he started work for Rangoon newspapers and became newspaper. He wrote political novels with the pen name Shwe Lin Yon and adult education novels with the pen name \"Thu\". Later, Chit Maung set up his own newspaper called Journal Kyaw Newspaper (ဂျာနယ်ကျော်သတင်းစာ). Its patriotic writing style for the Burmese working class attacked the ruling British colonial government. After World War II, he started Burmese independence activities and was arrested by the British government. He actively participated in Aung San's Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League. Due to poor health, he died at the age of 34 years. He is still considered as a role model journalist in Myanmar. His wife Journal Kyaw Ma Ma Lay wrote her husband's biography, Thu Lo Lu (သူလိုလူ), which was translated into English as A Man Like Him and published. Journal Kyaw U Chit Maung's eldest son Maung Thein Dan became an actor. His daughter was Dr. Daw Khin Lay Myint, a noted French scholar who died in 2007. She translated her mother's works into French, and some French classics into Burmese. His youngest son was the poet Moe Hein."

  "text" : "Carroll Rosenbloom (March 5, 1907 – April 2, 1979) was an American businessman. He was the owner of two National Football League franchises; he was the first owner of the Baltimore Colts, and later switched teams, taking ownership of the Los Angeles Rams. During his stewardship of both franchises, Rosenbloom amassed the best ownership winning percentage in league history (.660), a total regular season record of 226 wins, 116 losses, and 8 ties, as well as 3 NFL championships (1958,1959,1968), and 1 Super Bowl (Super Bowl V). Rosenbloom has been described as the NFL's first modern owner and the first players' owner. Rosenbloom was part of the NFL inner circle that negotiated the league's network TV contracts with NBC and CBS and the NFL/AFL merger, both of which contributed to professional football becoming both profitable and the most watched spectator sport in the United States."

  "text" : "Christopher Williams (born 15 March 1972 in Mandeville) is a Jamaican track and field sprinter. Williams is best known for winning the silver medal in the 200 metres at the 2001 World Championships. In 2001 he was named Jamaica Sportsman of the Year. Williams has competed in the Olympic Games three times, in 2000, 2004 and 2008, reaching the semi-finals of the 200m on all occasions. He was on the bronze medal-winning 4 x 400 metre relay team at the 2000 Olympics. He finished seventh in the 200m final at the 2007 World Championships. Williams represented Jamaica at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing. He competed at the 200 metres and placed third in his first round heat after Brian Dzingai and Christian Malcolm in a time of 20.53 seconds. He improved his time in the second round to 20.28 seconds and placed third again, this time after Dzingai and Walter Dix. He ran his semi final race in 20.45 seconds and placed sixth, which was not enough to make it to the Olympic final. He received a two-year ban for failing a drugs test (Amphetamine and levmetamphetamine) in August 2009 in Salamanca, Spain. The sprinter described the ban as \"harsh\", reflecting that, although he had ingested prohibited substances, he had done so through a cold medicine he was taking, which he had declared on the drug test forms in Spain. He also complained that the Jamaica Amateur Athletic Association had not informed him of the failed drug test and that he first discovered the news in April 2010 after a family member read the story on the internet. \"I was retired after I came back from Europe\", he remarked, \"Why would I be using performance enhancing drugs, when I am done with the sport?\"."

  "text" : "Conrad was bishop of Utrecht between 1076 and 1099. Before becoming bishop he was chamberlain of Archbishop Anno II of Cologne and, for a time, tutor of Prince Henry, the future Emperor Henry IV. When the excommunicated Bishop William of Utrecht died in 1076, the emperor gave the episcopal see of Utrecht to Conrad, who, like his predecessor, sided with Henry IV in his conflicts with Gregory VII, and at the Synod of Brixen in 1080 even condemned the pope as a heretic. The contemporary annalist, Lambert of Hersfeld, calls Conrad a schismatic bishop, unworthy of holding an episcopal see. In a battle with Robert I, Count of Flanders, Conrad was defeated, afterwards taken captive and compelled to yield part of West Frisia to Robert. This territorial loss of the bishop was compensated by the emperor, who, in 1077, gave him the district of Stavoren, and in 1086 added the two other Frisian districts, Oostergo and Westergo. He was in Rome when king Henry was crowned by the pope as emperor in 1084. Conrad is the founder and architect of the collegiate church of Notre-Dame at Utrecht. He was assassinated, shortly after completing the Holy Sacrifice, by his Frisian architect whom he had discharged, and who, in the opinion of some, was instigated by a certain nobleman whose domains Conrad held unjustly. The church of Saint Mary in Utrecht got a chapter during his reign. He is said to have written the discourse Pro Imperatore contra Papam, and to have delivered it at the Synod of Gerstungen in 1085. It is inserted by Johannes Aventinus (d. 1534) in his Vita Henrici IV and by Goldast (d. 1635) in his Pro Henrico IV imperatore. Hefele is of the opinion that the discourse is falsely attributed to Conrad of Utrecht, and that Aventinus himself is the author. He was killed at Utrecht by a Frisian on 14 April 1099."

After studying insurance on the island and in Cape Town, South Africa, he immigrated to Canada in 1958 settling in Vancouver and then Montreal where he eventually became an insurance company executive. He entered politics and was elected to the Quebec National Assembly in 1981 as a member of the Quebec Liberal Party. The Liberals took power as a result of the 1985 election and Lincoln was appointed to Robert Bourassa's cabinet as Minister of the Environment. Lincoln resigned from cabinet in 1989, along with two other anglophone ministers, to protest the Bourassa government's language policy and its adoption of Bill 178 which invoked the notwithstanding clause of the Canadian Constitution in order to require French to be the dominant language on commercial signs. He entered federal politics as a candidate in the 1990 Liberal leadership election but withdrew from the race when he was soundly defeated by a 3 to 1 margin in the February 12, 1990 Chambly federal by-election by Phil Edmonston of the New Democratic Party. He won a seat in parliament in the 1993 federal election for Lachine—Lac-Saint-Louis and was re-elected as the MP for Lac-Saint-Louis in 1997 and 2000 but was not appointed to Jean Chrétien's federal Cabinet despite initial expectations that he would become environment minister. He served as parliamentary secretary to the Deputy Prime Minister and the Minister of the Environment from 1993 until 1996. and as Chairman of the Standing Committee on Canadian Heritage from 1997 until 2004. In the latter role he authored a report on Canadian broadcasting, Our Cultural Sovereignty: The Second Century of Canadian Broadcasting but its recommendations were largely ignored by the government. Lincoln retired from politics at the 2004 federal election and was subsequently appointed Chairman of the Panel on Access to Third-language Public Television Services by the federal government. As of 2007, Lincoln is President of the Board of Directors of the English Speaking Catholic Council of Quebec. In December 2012, Lincoln released his memoir, Toward New Horizons, which chronicles his life in politics."

  "text" : "Comins Mansfield (14 June 1896 – 27 March 1984) was a chess problem composer. He gained title International Grandmaster FIDE in 1972 and 94.33 points in FIDE Album. Mansfield was born in the village of Witheridge, near Tiverton in Devon, England, the son of Herbert John Mansfield, who had long played correspondence chess for Devon. He attended Blundell's School in Tiverton and there began to take an interest in the game. He was inspired by a 1910 article in the British Chess Magazine that contained chess problems, and soon won first prize for a two-mover published in a Plymouth newspaper. After leaving school he joined the tobacco company W. D. & H. O. Wills, which remained his employer for 45 years, firstly in Bristol and later in Glasgow. While still in Bristol, he won the Gloucestershire county chess championship every year from 1927 to 1934. In 1936 Alain C. White published A Genius Of The Two-Mover, which included 100 of the 300-or-so problems that Mansfield had composed over the past 20 years; and in 1944 White also published Mansfield's Adventures In Composition – The Art of the Two Move Chess Problem in a limited edition. This book was re-published in the UK in 1948. When Mansfield retired from Wills in around 1960 he moved to Paignton in Devon. He became FIDE's first Master for Chess Composition in 1959, becoming President of FIDE's Problem Commission in 1963. The following year he took over as the Sunday Telegraph's chess columnist and retained that post until 1978.

  "text" : "Christian Ganczarski (born 1966) is a German citizen of Polish ancestry who converted to Islam. He was born in Gliwice, Silesia, Poland. Nicolas Sarkozy, then French Interior Minister, alleged Ganczarski was a top al Qaeda leader. The Alliance Base captured Ganczarski at Charles de Gaulle Airport. Early on the morning of April 11, 2002 Niser bin Muhammad Nasar Nawar and a colleague drove a truck loaded with natural gas canisters behind a German tourist bus near the El Ghriba synagogue on Djerba island, Tunisia. Nawar then used a cell phone belonging to his brother to phone Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and Ganczarski. After his colleague fled the scene on foot, Nawar detonated the explosives. In February 2009, a French court sentenced Ganczarski to 18 years in prison for the bombing."

  "text" : "Cynaethus or Cinaethus (Greek: Κύναιθος or Κίναιθος) of Chios was a rhapsode, a member of the Homeridae, sometimes said to have composed the Homeric Hymn to Apollo. The main source of information on Cynaethus is a Scholium to Pindar's second Nemean ode. This tells us that the school of Cynaethus was prominent among the Homeridae and put out many of their own compositions under Homer's name, Cynaethus himself composing the Hymn. He was the first to recite the Homeric poems at Syracuse, which he did during the 69th Olympiad (504-501 BC). It was once argued that the dating made no sense because the Homeric poems must have reached Syracuse much earlier. However, the original date corresponds well to a probable date of composition of the Homeric Hymn to Apollo, 522 BC. No doubt basing himself on this or a similar text, Eustathius of Thessalonica names Cynaethus as the first to disseminate the Homeric poems and as a forger of Homeric verses."

Among his many business activities, Packer founded the independent Spin Records label, which released many successful singles and albums from 1966 to 1972, including The Bee Gees' \"Spicks and Specks\" (1966) and the original Australian cast recording of the rock musical Hair (1969). In 1976 Packer relocated to the United States, initially living in Los Angeles before moving to Santa Barbara. Robert Clyde Packer died of heart and lung failure on 8 April 2001, aged 65."

  "text" : "Corbitant was a Wampanoag Indian sachem or sagamore under Massasoit. Corbitant was sachem of the Pocasset tribe in present-day North Tiverton, Rhode Island, c. 1618–1630. He lived in Mattapuyst or Mattapoiset, located in the southern part of today's Swansea, MA. In the summer of 1621, he was involved in a minor altercation with the Plymouth colony involving the Patuxet refugee Squanto at present-day Middleborough, Massachusetts. Corbitant had menaced both Squanto and his companion Hobomok for their close ties with the white strangers. Fearing for their lives, Hobomok was able to get away and escaped back to Plymouth, where he rallied the pilgrims under Miles Standish. Standish led ten men of Plymouth in arms to rescue Squanto from Corbitant. They attacked the Wampanoag village at Nemasket, but by that time Corbitant had released Squanto and withdrawn from the area. Corbitant was nominally obedient to the Great Sachem Massasoit of the Pokanoket. Although described as a \"determined foe of the English,\" nonetheless, \"with other hostile chiefs he signed a treaty of peace with the English in 1621.\" Tribes of the Wampanoag federation possessed hunting grounds at Cape Cod, Plymouth, Taunton, Attleboro, Middleboro, Hanson, Duxbury, Freetown, Somerset, Swansea, Mattapoisett, Wareham, and Fall River, in Massachusetts, as well as Tiverton, Aquidneck Island (Newport), Canonicut Island (Jamestown), Little Compton, Bristol, Warren and the lands west to the Providence River. About the year 1622 the Narragansett Federation under Canonicut seized the island of present-day Jamestown from Massasoit."

  "text" : "Clement Lindley Wragge (18 September 1852 – 10 December 1922) was a meteorologist born in Stourbridge, Worcestershire, England, but moved to Oakamoor, Staffordshire as a child. He set up the Wragge Museum in Stafford following a trip around the world. He was a Fellow of the Royal Geographical Society and in 1879 was elected Fellow of the Royal Meteorological Society in London. To the end of his life, he was interested in Theosophy and spiritualism and during his tour of India, met with Mirza Ghulam Ahmad of Qadian, founder of the Ahmadiyya movement in Islam who had claimed to be the Mahdi, the messianic redeemer awaited by Muslims. Sir Arthur Conan Doyle sought him out in New Zealand to ask for his views on spiritualism before writing The Wanderings of a Spiritualist in 1921. After training in law, Wragge became renowned in the field of meteorology, winning the Scottish Meteorological Society's Gold Medal and years later starting the trend of using people's names for cyclones. He travelled widely giving lectures in London and India, and in his later years was a reliable authority on Australia, India and the Pacific Islands."

  "text" : "Constance Keene (9 February 1921 – 24 December 2005) was an American pianist, who attracted great praise for her 1964 recording of Sergei Rachmaninoff's Preludes and also won critical acclaim for her recordings of the works of Johann Nepomuk Hummel, Carl Maria von Weber and Felix Mendelssohn; as well as Rachmaninoff's complete Études Tableaux, which she recorded more than thirty years after the Preludes. She was raised in Brooklyn, New York City. One of her teachers was Abram Chasins. She won the Naumburg Piano Competition in 1943. In 1946, she stood in for Vladimir Horowitz when he was unavailable for a concert, and she claimed she was the only female pianist ever to have been given this honor. She also appeared with Benny Goodman and his Orchestra in a performance of Gershwin's Rhapsody in Blue. In 1949 she married Chasins, who died in 1987. They performed and recorded music for piano duo. Through her husband, who had himself studied with the great pianist Josef Hofmann, she became personally acquainted with many great pianists, notably including Vladimir Horowitz. She and Chasins regularly socialized and played bridge with Horowitz and his wife Wanda Toscanini Horowitz during Horowitz's 12-year retirement from the concert stage. As a teen she met Hofmann, Godowski, and Rachmaninoff; as an adult she and Chasins helped Van Cliburn before his meteoric rise to fame; she was close with William Kapell, Abbey Simon, and countless other pianists. Later in life she continued to be an important member of New York's piano community, often hosting rising young pianists such as Evgeny Kissin and Lang Lang at her Upper West Side home. She later became an accomplished teacher herself. Her pupils included the children of Arthur Rubinstein, who said of her performances of Rachmaninoff's Preludes that he was \"flabbergasted by the colour, sweep and imagination and ... incredible technique. I cannot imagine anybody, including Rachmaninoff, playing the piano so beautifully\". For many years, she was on the faculty of the Manhattan School of Music, served as the Chair of the Piano Department, and was a member of its Board of Trustees. She was also sought out as a piano competition adjudicator."

  "text" : "Charles Creighton (November 22, 1847 – July 18, 1927) was a British physician and medical author. He was highly regarded for his scholarly writings on medical history but was widely denounced for disputing the germ theory of infectious diseases. Creighton was born in Peterhead, Aberdeenshire, Scotland, the oldest son of Alexander Creighton and Agnes Brand Creighton. He received a scholarship to attend the University of Aberdeen and received his M.A. in 1867. He then enrolled as a medical student and passed his M.B. and M.S. exams in 1871. After graduation he studied for a brief time with Karl von Rokitansky in Vienna and Rudolf Virchow in Berlin. He was awarded his M.D. in 1878. After returning from Berlin in 1872, Creighton worked in London as a hospital registrar until his appointment in 1876 as demonstrator of anatomy at Cambridge University. Over the next five years he wrote his first book, Bovine Tuberculosis in Man (1881) and published several articles on anatomy in the Journal of Anatomy and Physiology. In 1879 he became co-editor of this same journal. Then, for unknown reasons, Creighton quit a promising career at Cambridge and returned to London in 1881. For the remainder of his life he worked independently on his studies and lived alone. His most significant work, A History of Epidemics in Britain, took several years to complete and the two volumes were published in 1891 and 1894. It was recognized as an important contribution to the study of medical history. Some of his other writings were not so well received. Two articles he wrote for the Encyclopædia Britannica on pathology (1885) and vaccinations (1888) cast doubt on the existence of germs and the efficacy of vaccines. He was widely condemned for these views by leading medical journals. He continued to express his unorthodox and unpopular views in The Natural History of Cowpox and Vaccinal Syphilis (1887) and Jenner and Vaccination (1889). In 1918 Creighton moved to Upper Boddington, Northamptonshire, England where he lived until his death in 1927."

She was born in New York City, where, as a young girl, she began writing books but abandoned writing to pursue a career running an interior decoration business. When poor health forced her to give up her business, she decided to dust off an old manuscript from childhood but discovered the cleaning lady had thrown it out. From memory, she rewrote the story. Freeman specialized in multi-generational stories of Jewish families, centering on a female protagonist. Her novel, No Time For Tears, was No.10 on the list of bestselling novels in the United States for 1981 as determined by the New York Times. Her books were translated into thirty-three languages, selling more than twenty million copies worldwide. Cynthia Freeman died of cancer in San Francisco in 1988, aged 73."

During the late 1890s and the Edwardian years, she spent much time in both the society and gossip columns of two continents. She was widely known, envied and admired, desired, loathed and reviled."

  "text" : "Clyde Moody (September 19, 1915 – April 7, 1989), also known as the \"Hillbilly Waltz King\" and sometimes as \"The Genial Gentleman of Country Music\" was one of the great founders of American Bluegrass music. Born in Cherokee, North Carolina, Moody got his start in the late 1938 in the string band J. E. Mainer's Mountaineers. In September 1940 he joined Bill Monroe's Blue Grass Boys on the Grand Ole Opry. He appeared on Monroe's first solo recording session for RCA Victor's Bluebird label on October 7 of that year, playing guitar and singing lead vocals and bass on the Blue Grass Quartet's first recording (\"Cryin' Holy Unto My Lord\"). He was featured on that session singing \"Six White Horses\", a blues-based original. He also has the rare distinction of having played mandolin on a Blue Grass Boys session, as he provided the rhythm chops on \"Mule Skinner Blues\" and \"Dog House Blues\", while Monroe played guitar - the only instance where a Blue Grass Boy other than Monroe played mandolin at a Bill Monroe recording session. Upon his departure from the Blue Grass Boys in 1944, he remained at WSM and the Opry for several years as a solo artist. In 1952, he recorded as a member of the Brown's Ferry Four with The Delmore Brothers on King Records. He later played at the first Bluegrass Festival at Fincastle, Virginia, in 1965. His career highlights include appearing in the White House 3 times and writing and recording the million-seller Shenandoah Waltz. He sang with a young Elvis Presley in 1955 when Tom Parker paired them for a six-week tour. It is rumored that he was considered for the role of The Lone Ranger but lost the part to Clayton Moore. He died in Nashville, Tennessee. His nephew, Bruce Moody was also a popular bluegrass musician and toured with him from 1962–1969. Moody was inducted into the North Carolina Music Hall of Fame in 2011."

  "text" : "Colin Hoy (9 May 1922 at Windsor, Queensland – 24 March 1999 at Brisbane, Queensland), was an Australian cricket Test match umpire, the first Queenslander to be appointed. Hoy took to umpiring after becoming frustrated by a run of batting failures in Brisbane's grade cricket competition, and stood in his debut First-class match in January 1952. He umpired nine Test matches between 1954 and 1961. His first match was between Australia and England at Brisbane on 26 November to 1 December 1954, won by Australia by an innings with centuries to Neil Harvey and Arthur Morris. Hoy's partner in this match was Mel McInnes. Johnnie Moyes, writing in 1959 when Hoy was a current Test umpire, stated that \"he is young, has excellent eyesight and the keenness to study his art. … He should be in the forefront for years.\" His last Test match – in front of a world record crowd of over 90,000 on the second day - was between Australia and the West Indies on 10 February to 15 February 1961, a close match won by Australia by 2 wickets. In this most dramatic of all Test series, Hoy stood in every Test with Col Egar. In the first Test, at Brisbane, Hoy gave Ian Meckiff run out to record the first tie in Test history. The West Indies' captain Frank Worrell was full of praise for the calm and unobtrusive competence of the umpiring in that tension-filled series. After that series, Hoy retired from umpiring to concentrate on business and grade cricket in Brisbane, playing for the Valley District Cricket Club until 1988. He returned to umpiring for the World Series Cricket tour of 1978-79. His working life was spent in the retail trade and with Ansett Airlines, and he was the Australian rules football reporter for the Brisbane Courier-Mail."

  "text" : "Charles Thomas Pearce (1815–1883) was an English physician and early opponent of mandatory vaccination. A member of the Royal College of Surgeons, he was a homoeopath with an interest in medical astrology, and opposed to vivisection. Born in Westminster, London, he was the son of court tailor Richard David Pearce (1780–1820) and Sarah 'Sally' Bouchet (1777–1855). His mother was of Huguenot descent, her father and brother being noted Southwark brassfounders. Charles married a woman ten years his senior named Elizabeth Eagles at St. George's, Hanover Square, the daughter of a Pimlico carpenter and sister of James Eagles, Shoreditch organ builder, who restored the great instrument in Canterbury Cathedral, in addition to furnishing a number of new churches in Tasmania and Australia. Together, Charles and Elizabeth had four children. Charles was a Philosophical Instrument maker in 1840, the year his second son Alfred John Pearce (1840–1923) was born. Alfred would become a celebrated medical astrologer and popular almanacist, who worked in collaboration with his father as his assistant in the early 1870s. Charles Thomas Pearce lived for some time at St. Dunstan's Villa, Regent's Park, the home of his sponsor, Sir Richard Rawlinson Vyvyan (1800–1879), Tory politician, Fellow of the Royal Society, a geologist and a metaphysician. Charles was \"for some years engaged with him in scientific experiments and researches on light, heat, and magnetism.\" Notes taken by Charles whilst thus \"engaged with Sir R. Vyvyan ... in researches on the magnetism of the Moon's rays,\" were later recorded in a volume entitled \"The Weather Guide Book\", published by Charles's son, Alfred John Pearce, in 1864. In 1849, as a medical student, Charles patented an \"Apparatus for obtaining light by electric agency,\" a system published in various journals, including the \"Repository of Arts\" (vol.14, page 193) and the \"Mechanics' Magazine\" (vo.51, page 189), as well as being registered at the Enrolment Office. It was also in 1849 that he was acquitted of a charge of manslaughter brought by the reformer Thomas Wakley, (an appointed coroner) after his brother David Richard Pearce's death from cholera. The prosecution dropped the case during trial after a judge concluded the death was unrelated to Pearce's attempt, authorised by another physician, to treat it by homoeopathy. The homoeopathic community raised two hundred pounds for Pearce's defence, and Pearce's barristers argued that the \"indictment was merely an attack on the homeopathic system\". Charles published his arguments against smallpox vaccination in several books including Essay on Vaccination (1868), and campaigned vigorously for the better treatment of the mentally ill. His own wife, Elizabeth Eagles (1805–79), died with \"religious mania\" in the Peckham House Lunatic Asylum. In 1868, Charles patented \"an invention of improvements in the means of disinfecting or deodorizing rooms, buildings, and ships, applicable also in other purposes.\" His principal purpose was to find a way to preserve meat and thereby bring to an end the cruel transport of livestock on long ship journeys. From 1872–76, he ran a Hydropathic & Homeopathic Clinic at 'Woodstock House', 19, Nottingham Place, York Gate, Marylebone, in London, until it was closed by a well-publicised scandal involving a fraudulent patient, named Frank Hans Hamilton, and Charles's matron – whom, it was intimated in court, had borne his child. In 1878, he founded the Hydropathic Establishment & Sanatorium at Durleston Park, on the cliffs above Swanage, Dorset, with his much younger mistress, Annie Kay, who went by the pseudonym of 'Mrs. Agnes Ann Parker'. Charles Thomas Pearce died on 9 May 1883, at a villa called 'Lessie', in Avenue Road, Torquay, on the Devonshire coast. He is the maternal 3-great grandfather of British author and charity-founder David Charles Manners."

  "text" : "In 1665, Caleb Cheeshahteaumuck became the first Native American to graduate from Harvard University. Cheeshahteaumuck, of the Wampanoag tribe, came from Martha's Vineyard and attended a preparatory school in Roxbury. At Harvard, he lived and studied in the Indian College, Harvard's first brick building, with a fellow Wampanoag, Joel Iacoomes. Cheeshahteaumuck died of tuberculosis in Watertown, Massachusetts less than a year after graduation. Apart from Cheeshahteaumuck and Iacoomes, at least two other Native American students attended the Indian College at this time. Eleazar died before graduating and John Wampus left to become a mariner. Iacoomes was lost in a shipwreck a few months prior to graduation, while returning to Harvard from Martha's Vineyard. Cheeshahteaumuck is believed to have been the only Native American to have graduated from the Indian College during its years of operation. These first students studied in an educational system that emphasized Greek, Latin, and religious instruction. On December 16, 2010, a portrait of Caleb Cheeshahteaumuck, commissioned by the Harvard Foundation, was unveiled in the University's famous Annenberg Hall. A part of the Harvard Foundation Portraiture Project diversity initiative, it was painted by the alumnus Stephen E. Coit. He conducted careful historical research and consulted with members of the Wampanoag. Rev. Peter J. Gomes chaired the project and attended with Harvard President Drew Faust and members of the Harvard Native American Program to commemorate the day."

  "text" : "Charles Allan Gilbert (September 3, 1873 – April 20, 1929), better known as C. Allan Gilbert, was a prominent American illustrator. He is especially remembered for a widely published drawing (a memento mori or vanitas) titled All Is Vanity. The drawing employs a double image (or visual pun) in which the scene of a woman admiring herself in a mirror, when viewed from a distance, appears to be a human skull. The title is also a pun, as this type of dressing-table is also known as a vanity. The phrase \"All is vanity\" comes from Ecclesiastes 1:2 (Vanity of vanities, saith the Preacher, vanity of vanities; all is vanity.) It refers to the vanity and pride of man. In art, vanity has long been represented as a woman preoccupied with her beauty. And art that contains a human skull as a focal point is called a memento mori (Latin for \"remember you will die\"), a work that reminds people of their mortality. It is less widely known that Gilbert was an early contributor to animation, and a camouflage artist (or camoufleur) for the U.S. Shipping Board during World War I."

B. White. In the cartoon, a mother at dinner says to her young daughter, \"It's broccoli, dear.\" Her daughter answers, \"I say it's spinach, and I say the hell with it.\" (The phrase \"I say it's spinach\" entered the vernacular; in 1932, Irving Berlin's popular Broadway revue Face The Music included the song \"I Say It's Spinach (And The Hell With It)\".) Elizabeth Hawes adopted it for her critique of the clothing design industry: Fashion is Spinach (1938). Rose illustrated Bennett Cerf's best-selling book Try and Stop Me and its sequel Shake Well Before Using. Rose also illustrated Have Tux, Will Travel, the supposed autobiography of actor Bob Hope (actually ghost-written by journalist Pete Martin)."

  "text" : "Chen Hansheng (Chinese: 陈翰笙; pinyin: Chén Hànshēng; February 5, 1897 – March 13, 2004), also known as Chen Han-seng and Geoffrey Chen, was a Chinese sociologist and considered a pioneer of modern Chinese social science, and also a member of legendary Soviet master-spy Richard Sorge's Tokyo ring. Chen was born in Wuxi, Jiangsu. He studied at Pomona College, where he graduated Phi Beta Kappa in 1920, and he then pursued a M.A. in history at The University of Chicago. In Spring 1922, he enrolled at Harvard University for a history PhD; there he assisted Charles Haskins. However, A year later, he left the United States for Germany, and completed his doctorate at Berlin University. In 1924, he earned an academic position at Peking University. He was recruited to the Comintern, also in 1924, by Li Dazhao, as mentioned in his 1988 autobiography My Life During Four Eras. During the 1930s he came down on the Communist side of Mao Zedong, drawing on his field research on the economic conditions of Chinese peasantry for the Institute for Social Science Research. He wrote Landlord and Peasant in China (1936) on this area. He was one of Mao's theorists, and he spent time out of China in Moscow. From 1945 to 1950, he resided in the USA. He then returned to China, an uncomfortable experience since he was accused of spying for the Kuomintang. Later in the Cultural Revolution, he was harshly treated."

A political refugee and (Jewish) survivor of the Holocaust from Romania, he arrived in Paris in 1946 and enrolled at the University of Paris. After receiving his degree, Schein joined the adhesives-formulating group at the French branch of Honeywell. There he developed the modern form of polyvinylchloride (PVC)-based seam sealant used in the manufacturing of automobiles. In the late 1950s, with Honeywell's consent, he founded Caourep. In the 1960s and 70s the Caourep Group followed French and other European OEM automotive producers as they expanded in the first postwar recovery wave of globalization. Caourep established its own plants or licensees in every country in which Renault, Peugeot, Fiat, VW, and Daimler-Benz operated directly or by licensing. By the late 1970s, Caourep had become a supplier to the overseas operations of Ford, GM, and Chrysler. By 1977, Caourep was the largest producer of OEM automotive adhesives and sealants in the world."

  "text" : "Clair Elroy George (August 3, 1930 – August 11, 2011) was a veteran of the Central Intelligence Agency's (CIA) clandestine service who oversaw all global espionage activities for the agency in the mid-1980s. According to The New York Times, George was “a consummate spymaster who moved the chess pieces in the CIA’s clandestine games of intrigue.” After serving in Korea and Japan as an enlisted man in Army Intelligence, George was one of the CIA’s earliest recruits. As such George challenged the traditional image of early CIA recruits. He was not a son of privilege and lacked an Ivy League pedigree. By many accounts, he developed a loyal following for his ebullient manner and courage working in some of the world’s most volatile regions. After a highly decorated career lasting nearly thirty years, including dangerous assignments in Beirut and Athens, George served for three years in the Reagan Administration as Deputy Director for Operations. He was the third-ranking official at the CIA under William Casey. George made headlines when he became the highest-ranking target of investigation and prosecution in the Iran–Contra affair. After a first mistrial, George was eventually found guilty by a jury on only two counts of false statements to congressional committees investigating the Iran-Contra Affair. He was pardoned by President George H. W. Bush two weeks later along with others involved and was never convicted. The special prosecutor immediately thereafter moved to vacate the indictments against George altogether. In 1996, one of the laws used against George was held unconstitutional by the U.S. Supreme Court in an unrelated case. After his retirement from the CIA, George continued to hold legendary hero status in the intelligence community and was a successful consultant on international matters. He also volunteered nightly for the Suicide Hotline. He died in Bethesda at age 81 of cardiac arrest. His wife of 45 years, Mary, a figure in her own right as a model CIA wife, died in 2008."

The Voluntaryist promotes libertarian economics, abstention from voting, nonviolence, and abolition of the state through conscious non-cooperation. The libertarian philosophy of the late Robert LeFevre, of whom he was a student, was influential in Watner's intellectual development. In addition to writing articles for The Voluntaryist, Watner researches and writes about historical libertarian texts. Murray Rothbard credited Watner for \"uncovering an unknown work by the great Lysander Spooner, one that managed to escape the editor of Spooner's Collected Works\" entitled \"Vices are not Crimes.\" His work has been discussed and cited by Roderick Long, David Gordon of the Ludwig von Mises Institute, and other scholars."

  "text" : "Chester Ashley (June 1, 1790 – April 29, 1848) was an American politician who represented Arkansas in the U.S. Senate from 1844 until his death. Ashley was born in Amherst, Massachusetts in 1790; while a child he moved with his parents to Hudson, New York. He was a graduate, with honors, of Williams College; following this, he attended the Litchfield Law School. Ashley moved west upon completion of his education, going first to Illinois, and thence to Missouri. In 1820 he arrived in Little Rock, Arkansas, soon becoming one of the best and most prominent lawyers in the Arkansas Territory; for a time, his partner in practice was Robert Crittenden. Together, Ashley and Crittenden founded Rose Law Firm. For some twenty years Ashley's practice was the largest in the state, and he became a wealthy man. This led him to try his hand at politics; in 1844 he canvassed the state campaigning for James K. Polk for president; the Democrats were victorious, and Ashley was elected by the state legislature to fill a vacancy in the Senate. Soon after entering, he was made the Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee; in 1846, he was reelected to the Senate. Two years later, he became suddenly ill in the Senate Chamber and died not long after. Chester Ashley is the namesake of Ashley County, Arkansas. One of Ashley's descendants is Sterling R. Cockrill, the Democratic Speaker of the Arkansas House of Representatives from 1968 to 1969 and the unsuccessful Republican nominee for lieutenant governor in 1970."

  "text" : "Charles Spencer \"Spen\" King (26 March 1925 – 26 June 2010) was a significant figure in the Rover Company and, after their takeover, in the British Leyland Motor Corporation. After leaving school in 1942, he was first apprenticed to Rolls-Royce. He joined Rover, run by his uncles Maurice and Spencer Wilks, in 1945 and worked initially on the gas-turbine powered JET1 and T3 experimental prototypes. In 1959, he became chief engineer of new vehicle projects and is best known for his leadership of the teams that developed the advanced Rover P6 series, introduced as the 2000 in 1963, and the hugely successful Range Rover (of which a \"CSK\" special edition later celebrated his involvement) launched in June 1970. As well, he was responsible for the Rover-based Marauder sports car in 1950 and many Rover experimental and prototype vehicles. As Rover was taken over by the Leyland Motor Corporation which subsequently became British Leyland (BL), he also led teams responsible for the Triumph TR6, Triumph Stag and Triumph TR7 models as well as the innovative design of the 16-valve cylinder head used on the Triumph Dolomite Sprint. Several other BL Group models were developed under his leadership but during a chaotic time for the British motor industry, King was frequently frustrated by the design compromises imposed by lack of adequate funding, and the poor quality of vehicles produced by an uncooperative workforce in the diverse and mainly outdated plants owned by the company. While chairman of BL Technology from 1979 he was responsible for developing a series of light, aerodynamic and technically advanced ECV (Energy Conservation Vehicle) experimental models (including the ECV3), features of which were incorporated into later BL Group products such as the Rover K-series engine, or adopted by other manufacturers. Spen King retired from the company in 1985. In 2004, he criticised SUV owners who drive their vehicles in urban areas, saying that vehicles like the Range Rover he created were \"never intended as a status symbol but later incarnations of my design seem to be intended for that purpose\". Spen King and his former Rover colleague Arthur Goddard extensively shared many of their views on the motor industry in 2010. The transcript of their discussion was published in the book They Found Our Engineer in 2011. It was announced on 28 June 2010 that King had died on 26 June after suffering complications following a cycling accident."

Copsi survived Tostig's defeat at Stamford Bridge, and when William the Conqueror prevailed at Hastings, he travelled, in March 1067, to pay William homage at Barking (where William was staying while his tower was being constructed in London). In return, William made Copsi earl of Northumbria and sent him back to York. Copsi's rule lasted a mere five weeks, at which time he was murdered by Osulf, son of Eadulf III of the ancient Bernician family —which had historically governed the area from Bamburgh, at Newburn-upon-Tyne. Osulf, however, only ruled as earl until that autumn, when he was killed by an outlaw he was tracking."

  "text" : "Claire Yvonne “Cissy” King (born January 3, 1946) is an American-born singer and dancer best known as a featured performer on The Lawrence Welk Show television program. King was born in Trinidad, Colorado. Her father was a geologist employed by an oil company. The family relocated to Albuquerque, New Mexico when Cissy was three. An accomplished dancer since she was a toddler, Cissy, along with her brother John, won first place at the National Ballroom Dancing Championships in San Francisco, California when she was fourteen. They captured first place two more times and were also named U.S Ballroom Couple Of The Year. Later, when attending the University of New Mexico, she majored in recreation and physical education and was a cheerleader, gymnast, and was on the synchronized swim team. She continued to dance, in various ballroom competitions and on stage such as the Six Flags Over Texas campus revue. In 1967, Cissy became Bobby Burgess' dance partner on The Lawrence Welk Show when his first partner, Barbara Boylan left to get married. For the next dozen years, she became one of the most popular performers on the show with her vivacious personality, singing talents and her natural dance moves. In 1974, she was honored with the Dance Masters of America award for outstanding contributions to the field of dance. After leaving the show in late 1978, she continued to perform, dancing for several years with her own solo act \"Two Fellows\"; and acting in the Broadway touring production of Always Patsy. Today, King lives in Albuquerque, where she continues to dance, and is active in creating new shows in major venues across her home state."

Hardy has secured victory for six consecutive years in the Civil Service qualifier for the hot dog circuit and he maintains records in sushi, shrimp and cabbage. Hardy is a legend on the IFOCE circuit and known to fellow eaters as \"The Godfather\". He is a former Nathan's American Hot Dog Eating Champion (personal best is 23.5 Nathan's hot dogs and buns in 12 minutes). Hardy won the 2000 Matzo Ball Eating Contest by consuming 15.5 matzo balls in 5 minutes and 25 seconds. He has competed in Japan twice, eating 15 feet of sushi in one sitting. After disappointing performances in Coney Island, skeptics murmured that the elasticity was gone from the stomach of the one-time American Hot Dog Eating Champion. However, Hardy put an end to whispers with his victory at the Hibernation Cup in Alaska, which included recorded-breaking performances in shrimp (4.5 pounds in 12 minutes) and boiled cabbage (six and a half pounds in nine minutes). Hardy supplanted Ed Krachie in the late 1990s as America's most recognized competitive eater, and is a former member of the Corrections Emergency Response Team (CERT) at Rikers Island."

Fox took over the tiny museum, in Baraboo, Wisconsin, in 1960, and began to collect and restore antique circus wagons. These wooden wagons had been built in the late 19th and early 20th century, and lay in disrepair across the United States and Europe. Today, the museum owns over 200 of these wagons. In 1963, Fox and Ben Barkin, under the sponsorship of the Schlitz Brewing Company, began the Great Circus Parade. A self-trained circus historian, Fox wrote and edited many books about circus animals, advertising and imagery, and also authored many children's stories. He died of heart disease at a nursing home in Baraboo and is survived by his wife Sophie and daughter, Barbara Fox McKellar."

  "text" : "Champion Spalding Chase (March 20, 1820 – November 3, 1898) was a Nebraska politician. Born in Cornish, New Hampshire as the son of Clement Chase (1776–1867) and his second wife, Olive Spalding (1790–1823), who was from Plainfield, NH., he was named after his mother's father, Champion Spalding. He grew up in Cornish and later attended the Kimball Union Academy in Meriden, NH. He started teaching in Cornish as an adolescent during the winter time and moved later in 1840 to continue his teaching in New York. He went on to teach at an Academy in Amsterdam, New York from 1841–1842. By 1843 he had moved to the County of Otsego to be the vice principal of the West Hartwick Seminary. But he resided in New York until the end of the 1940's and studied law in Buffalo. In 1848 he was admitted to the bar at Canandaigua and then in 1849 he moved to Racine, Wisconsin. In Racine he married Mary Sophronia Butterfield (1827–1882) that same year. They had their only son, Champion Clement Chase, who would eventually become an well-known newspaper publisher in Omaha, after they had been married 15 years. He got into politics after a few years in Wisconsin and served in the first ever Republican Nation Convention in 1856 as part of the delegation from Wisconsin which nominated John C. Fremont as a candidate for the presidency of the USA. The same year he was elected to the Wisconsin State Senate for two years, during which time he, as chairman of the judiciary committee, supervised the revision for the statutes of the state. He selected as the District Attorney in 1859 for the 2nd judicial district in Wisconsin. In 1862, just two years later, due to the influence of Salmon Portland Chase (1808–1873), who not only just happened to be his famous cousin but also happened to be the Secratary of the Treasury, he was appointed as paymaster in the Union Army. He served four years in the Union Army starting with the rank of Major of Calvary and during this time he was on special duty in the West and Southwest; was at the sieges of Knoxville, Mobile, and Vicksburg and in the later part of the war he was headquartered at New Orleans for nearly two years and would receive a commission as Lieutenant Colonel from President Andrew Johnson late in 1865. He, at this time, was brevetted or promoted by a commission to a higher rank of lieutenant colonel without an increase of pay and with limited exercise of the higher rank, (often granted as an honor immediately before retirement) for his meritorious services in the Gulf Campaign. In January of 1866 he was honorably discharged. That same year he went to Omaha, Nebraska for the first time just one year before Nebraska was admitted to the Union as the 37th state and upon its admission, he became through election in 1867 the new state's first Attorney-General of the state of Nebraska. Starting in 1869, was appointed a regent of the State University of Nebraska, for six years until 1875. At the same time as these positions, Chase was one of the early incorporators of the Omaha Street Railway Co., which, starting in 1867, came into existence. He served in the Wisconsin State Senate, and the Racine, Wisconsin Board of Education. Chase served as a paymaster and was commissioned colonel during the American Civil War. Chase moved to Nebraska where he became the state's first attorney general, serving from 1867 to 1869. He was a member of the University of Nebraska board of regents from 1869 to 1875. Before he left the Board of Regents Champion Chase was elected as Mayor of Omaha. In 1875 he was elected for another term of two years. And reelected during 1879-1881 and 1883-1884 terms. Four times he held the position of mayor of Omaha, Nebraska. During these times in office it was recorded of him as having \"favoured extensive public improvements\" such as parks and boulevards, and direct and gravitational powered waterworks. While being the mayor, Colonel Chase received, and officially entertained, a large number of distinguished people. Among them was the king of the islands in Hawaiian, the Brazilian emperor, Canada's governor-general, also President Hayes and Mrs. Hayes, General and Mrs. U.S. Grant, besides Generals Sherman, Sheridan, Custer and others. In 1871, he was elected Grand Senior Warden in the Nebraska Commandary of Knights Templar (Freemasons). He was generalissimo of the state comandery. In 1886 he was unanimously chosen president of the Nebraska State Humane Society. In 1884, his final term in office, impeachment hearings were directed toward Chase and he was removed form office on 30 June 1884 by a vote of the city council. They alleged him of being drunk, incompetent through being drunk, nervous system derangement and his duty being neglected. His wife Mary lost her life to cancer in 1882 and many think this may have contributed to his ill health and difficulties financially. Council member Patrick Murphy completed his term. But in spite of this quick removal of office, Chase launched \"quo warrant proceedings\" in 1887 stating that he had been illegally removed form office as well as having been deprived of the salary of the mayor. The jury rendered a verdict in his favor which gave him some measure of closure. He was also identified as being past commander of the U.S. Grant Post of the G.A.R. (Grand Army) and the S.A.R. (Sons of the American Revolution). In 1891 he was an organiser of the Omaha Real Estate Owner's Association. He was selected as the chairman of the International Pan-Republic Congress on Plan and Scope in the mid 1890's which furthered his distinction. He was appointed a Collector of Customs for the Port of Omaha as one of his last public acts before he died in office as a result of a fall on November 3, 1898 at the age of 78. He was devoted to the memories of his native town, often expressed his loyalty and love for it. His wife had died earlier in 1882 and they are both now buried alongside each other at the Prospect Hills Cemetery in Omaha, Nebraska. Chase County, Nebraska, and the unincorporated community of Champion in Chase County, are named after him as a complimentary act on the part of the Legislature of Nebraska."

  "text" : "Claude Ake (18 February 1939 in Omoku – 7 November 1996) was a Nigerian political scientist. Ake gained a Ph.D. from Columbia University in 1966 and during his life he held various academic positions at institutions around the world, including Yale University (United States), University of Nairobi (Kenya), University of Dar es Salaam (Tanzania) and University of Port Harcourt (Nigeria). He was active in Nigerian politics and is well known for his work in studies of development and democracy, his overriding concern being Africa. He died in an airplane crash on a flight between Port Harcourt and Lagos in Nigeria. Claude Ake, a prominent Nigerian political scientist who was a visiting professor at Yale, died on November 7 1996 when the Boeing 727 on which he was a passenger crashed into a lagoon in a mangrove jungle 25 miles northeast of Lagos, Nigeria. He was 57, and his permanent home was in Port Harcourt, Nigeria. Ake (pronounced AH-kay) was one of 142 people killed when the plane, operated by a local airline, Aviation Development Company, crashed, leaving no survivors. His death was widely believed to have been orchestrated by the then military junta of Gen. Sani Abacha of whom Ake was an uncompromising critic. This is in addition to the fact that Ake was a mentor to slain author, Ken Saro-Wiwa and a brain behind the Ogoni agitations against exploitation. While teaching at Yale he lived in temporary quarters on the Yale campus. He resigned from a commission appointed by the oil company Royal Dutch/Shell to study the ecology of the oil-producing Niger Delta. He did so to protest the execution of a minority rights activist, Ken Saro-Wiwa. Ake was a critic of Shell and the oil industry. He is quoted as saying, \"In Nigeria, companies like Shell are struggling between greed and fear.\" At his death, Ake was also the founder and director of the Center for Advanced Social Science, headquartered in Port Harcourt, which is the capital of Rivers State in southern Nigeria. Ake was born in Omoku, in that state. He had gone to Port Harcourt to hold a meeting at the center and was on his way back to the United States when he died. The center is a think-tank for social and environmental research. It also played a practical role, functioning in the early 1990s as an honest broker concerning oil revenues and environmental issues between local officials and representatives of several minority groups in the oil-producing area in southeastern Nigeria. Ake was also a critic of corruption and authoritarian rule in Africa. He wrote in 1985, in an essay on the African state: \"Power is everything, and those who control the coercive resources use it freely to promote their interests.\" George Bond, the director of the Institute of African Studies at Columbia University's School of International Public Affairs, said: \"He was one of the pre-eminent scholars on African politics and a scholar-activist concerned with the development of Africa. His concern was primarily with the average African and how to improve the nature of his conditions.\" Ake founded the center in 1991, with the mission of fostering development from within the social sciences on the African continent. Other tasks set for it were to apply scientific knowledge to actual developmental problems in Africa and to enable Africa to become more of a producer of knowledge. When the center was founded, its sole supporter was the Ford Foundation. It is now supported by the Ford Foundation and other donors in the United States and elsewhere. Mora McLean, a former Ford Foundation staff member who is now the president of the Manhattan-based African-American Institute, said that Ake was \"not just an intellectual, he was a visionary.\" At Yale, he taught two political science courses—one, called State in Africa, which was for undergraduates and graduate students, and another for undergraduates, about aspects of development and the state in Africa. The chairman of the Council on African Studies at Yale, David E. Apter, who is also the Henry J. Heinz II Professor of Comparative Political and Social Development at Yale, said of Ake: \"In the very short time he was here, he developed a following among the students, both graduate and undergraduate, which was truly extraordinary. There were graduate students who wept at his death. Everyone was really shocked. It was an amazing testimonial to the man.\" Apter said that Ake had \"crackling intelligence and an outspokenly severe view of African politics and nevertheless, underneath that, a quality of understanding which was remarkably subtle and complex. But he was able to communicate the complexity in a straightforward manner.\" He added that Ake \"was not only, in my view, the top African political scientist, but an extraordinarily courageous person. The Nigerian Government was often at odds with him, and nevertheless they recognized his stature.\" Ake specialized in political economy, political theory and development studies. He was professor of political economy and dean of the University of Port Harcourt's Faculty of Social Sciences for some years in the 1970s and 1980s after having taught at Columbia University, where he earned his doctorate in 1966. His earlier education was in Nigeria and London. Before becoming a dean at Port Harcourt, he taught at universities in Canada, Kenya and Tanzania. Afterward, he held a variety of posts, at the African Journal of Political Economy, and on the Social Sciences Council of Nigeria end elsewhere. His many writings included the book Democracy and Development in Africa (Brookings, 1996). His survivors included his wife, Anita, and three sons: Mela, Ibra & Brieri all of Rivers State."

He first became well known in the early 1970s on WMAK-AM, then a market-dominant rock and roll station, as host of its 7 p.m.–midnight program. He was called \"legendary\" among DJs. McCloud was one of the most controversial deejays of the late 1980s when he was the lead man on \"The Zoo Crew\" on Nashville's Y107 (WYHY). While enormously popular amongst his target demographic, his outlandish on-air personality drew the ire of many within the community as being a \"bad influence\" on teenagers. He was one of the subjects of a CBS 48 Hours documentary in 1992 about \"shock radio\". McCloud enjoyed his highest level of popularity while working for Y107, and had his own fan club. He worked at the station for over 10 years, from 1984 to 1995. McCloud was featured frequently in Billboard."

  "text" : "Charles Washington Merrill (December 21, 1869 – February 5, 1958) was an Americanmining metallurgist. He was born in Concord, New Hampshire to Sylvester and Clara L. (née French) Merrill. He attended elementary and high school in Alameda, California and then attended the College of Mining of the University of California, where he received a Bachelor of Science in 1891. After his graduation he was first connected with the noted old Standard Consolidated mine in Bodie, California, and from there went to the Harqua Hala mine in Arizona, thence to the Montana Mining Company in Marysville, California. In 1899, he became affiliated with the widely known Homestake Mining Company of South Dakota as a metallurgist, and in this capacity he manifested the brilliant talents which became the foundation of his future career. He became extensively known by his work, and acquired material prosperity, and his creation of new methods, particularly in the process of extracting gold from ore (the Merrill-Crowe process), brought to him wide fame. It is an established fact that he added to the value of the effective reserve in the ore property of the Homestake mine alone approximately twenty million dollars (1930's dollars). After he achieved his success in South Dakota, Merrill organized the Merrill Company in San Francisco in 1910, for the purpose of exploiting his patents in the cyanide process. He held over 25 patents in the United States and foreign countries relative to metallurgical processes and mining apparatus. From 1924-25 he served as a regent of the University of California and also served as president of the Alumni Association. During World War I he accepted the position of chief of the Division of Collateral Commodities in the Food Administration at the request of Herbert Hoover. In World War II his various enterprises were called upon by the Armed Services to extend and vary their endeavors and processes as their part in aiding the war effort. On February 9, 1898 he married Clara Scott Robinson, daughter of Dr. W.N. and Clara (née Hawkins) Robinson in Alameda, California. They had four children; Beatrice, John, Gregor, and Bruce. The family made its home in Berkeley, California in a home designed by architect Julia Morgan until the 1930s, when expansion by the University of California forced them to relocate to Orinda, California. Merrill died on February 5, 1956 of a stroke at the age of 86 while on a trip to Honolulu, Hawaii."

In December 1893 he became the first person to ski in Antarctica on the Larsen Ice Shelf which was subsequently named after him. Larsen is considered the founder of the Antarctic whaling industry and the settlement at Grytviken on the British-administered island of South Georgia. In 1910, after some years' residence on South Georgia, he took British citizenship. The Norwegian whale factory ship C.A. Larsen was named after him."

Cornelius Hardy was born in the early 1830s. Erickson claims 1831, but other records state that he was 23 years old in 1856. In that year, he was working as a clerk in the General Post Office when he and two other clerks were caught stealing money from letters. On 9 March 1856, Hardy was sentenced to fourteen years transportation. He arrived in Western Australia on board the Nile in January 1858. After receiving his ticket of leave, he was employed as a tutor by another convict, Frederick Morrell, before being appointed government schoolteacher at Northam in 1865. Attendance at the school dwindled and the school was eventually closed. Hardy then found other work in Northam, and was later elected to the committee of the Northam Mechanics' Institute."

  "text" : "Choe Chung-heon (1149 – 29 October 1219) was a military ruler of Korea during the Goryeo period. Choe's father was a Grand General in the Goryeo military, hence precipitating his own entry into the military. Choe witnessed military men become all-powerful in the quick succession of military leaders who deposed one another. Choe plotted against the long-standing war council, feigning fealty to the newly promoted supreme general and council head, a slave's son, Yi Ui-min. After many years of humiliation and hardship, Choe and his subordinates launched a coup d'état while Yi was away. After destroying the war council and killing Yi, he became a prominent leader. Although the coup was a success, Choe did not take full power. Choe became Prime Minister of the State and Royal Protector, seeing the abdication of 4 kings (asked for 2 of the 4), 3 rebellions and numerous attempts on his life. Finally during the early reign of King Gojong, Choe retired, handing his position to his eldest son Choe U (though not without bloodshed as his youngest attempted to take it for himself). Choi Chungheon died of age at 71 in 1219. Until the death of Choe's grandsons, the Choe family reigned supreme over the political and military landscape of Goryeo. Choi U, Choi Hang, and Choi Ui passed the legacy of Choe Chung-heon for sixty years until the assassination of Choi-Ui."

From 1959 to 1994, Susa was composer-in-residence for the Old Globe Theater (San Diego, California), where he wrote incidental music for over 200 productions there. In 1988, he joined the faculty of the San Francisco Conservatory of Music, and remained there as a professor of composition until his death. Susa became particularly known for his 5 operas. His 1973 chamber opera, Transformations, set to texts from the poems of Anne Sexton, is one of the most frequently performed operas by an American composer. His other compositions include choral works and incidental music for various plays. His music is published by the E.C. Schirmer Music Company."

Zeller had a fine soprano voice, and sang in the Vienna Boys' Choir before studying and composition in the University of Vienna. He worked as a civil servant at the Imperial Ministry of Education while composing songs (God Greets You All and Give Yourself Roses in Tyrol), choral works, and a number of operettas, the best-known of which is Der Vogelhändler. All of his librettos were written (or co-written) by Moritz West, often together with Ludwig Held. Legal troubles, including a perjury conviction, ended Zeller's career at the ministry and led to prison and public disgrace in the mid-1890s (although his prison sentence was later repealed). After an injury in 1895 from falling on the ice, he spent his last years physically and then mentally ill. Zeller died of pneumonia in Baden bei Wien at the age of 56."

  "text" : "Carl Philipp Christian von Gontard (13 January 1731 in Mannheim – 23 September 1791 in Breslau) was a German architect who worked primarily in Berlin, Potsdam, and Bayreuth in the style of late Baroque Classicism. Next to Knobelsdorff he was considered the most important architect of the era of Frederick the Great of Prussia. Carl von Gontard descended from a Huguenot family living in the French province of Dauphiné. He married Sophia von Erckert and had numerous children, including Carl Friedrich Ludwig von Gontard, a Prussian army officer who was granted hereditary nobility by the Holy Roman Emperor Joseph II. After two years of study in Paris under Jacques-François Blondel and a lengthy sojourn in Italy he gained a reputation as a valued court architect to Wilhelmine of Prussia, Margravine of Brandenburg-Bayreuth. In Bayreuth he designed an extension to the Bayreuth Palace and numerous palaces for the nobility and residences for prosperous citizens, buildings recognized as being of high artistic quality and giving the townscape a distinctive accent. Gontard also taught architecture at the Bayreuth Academy of Arts. When her husband, reigning prince Frederick, Margrave of Brandenburg-Bayreuth, died in 1763, Gontard no long received regular commissions because of the policy of austerity of Frederick’s successor, Frederick Christian, Margrave of Brandenburg-Bayreuth. In 1764 Gontard was employed by Wilhelmine’s brother, Frederick the Great of Prussia, who soon put him in charge of all royal construction projects in Potsdam and Berlin. From 1765 to 1769 he was the artistic director of the New Palace in Potsdam, whose construction had started in 1763. Gontard had a major role in the arrangement and design of the palace interior, as well as the architecture of the formal auxiliary buildings (Communs) facing the palace forecourt and several structures in Park Sanssouci, such as the Temple of Friendship, Frederick the Great's tribute to his sister, Wilhelmine, and the Antique Temple. His next major work in Potsdam, the Military Orphanage, was undertaken 1771-1778 and contained a distinctive central block and a spiraling stairwell. Gontard also designed and built private residences in Potsdam, such as an impressive parade of houses, Am Bassin, and Potsdam's Brandenburg Gate. Gontard’s main works in Berlin include the colonnade portico and tower of the German and French churches on Gendarmenmarkt; two decorative colonnaded bridges across the former moat, a remnant of the city’s 17th century fortifications, (in 1776 the Spittelkolonnaden on Leipziger Strasse, and in 1777/1778 the Königskolonnaden, originally near Alexanderplatz but later relocated to Heinrich-von-Kleist-Park); the Oranienburg Gate (1787/88) historic drawing; and supervision of the construction of the Royal Library on today’s Bebelplatz, which he furnished with a grand staircase and a formal hall for festivities. Immediately after the death of Frederick the Great, his successor, Friedrich Wilhelm II, commissioned Gontard to decorate the Potsdam  City Palace and Garrison Church for the funeral rites. Major royal assignments followed. Between 1787 and 1790 he furnished nine of the Royal Chambers in the Berlin  City Palace. At the same time he created the Marble Palace in Potsdam, one of his most outstanding achievements. His last work was the ‘‘Holländische Etablissement’’, an ensemble of so-called “Dutch Houses” in the New Garden, Potsdam. Under Frederick William II Gontard became a member of the Royal Prussian Academy of Arts and Mechanical Sciences, where he taught until his death. He had significant followers in G. C. Unger, F. W. Titel, and H. Gentz, but no long-lasting successors as his style did not survive the change in architectural taste that came with the end of Frederick the Great’s era."

  "text" : "Camille Bombois (February 3, 1883 – June 6, 1970) was a French naïve painter especially noted for paintings of circus scenes. Bombois was born in Venarey-les-Laumes in the Côte-d'Or, under humble circumstances. His childhood was spent living on a barge and attending a local school until the age of twelve, when he became a farm worker. During his free time he drew and competed in wrestling competitions at local fairs. He became a champion local wrestler before joining a traveling circus as a strongman and wrestler. In 1907, Bombois fulfilled his dream of moving to Paris, where he married and worked as a railway laborer, eventually finding a night job at a newspaper printing plant handling heavy newsprint rolls. Despite the exhausting nature of his job he painted from dawn to dusk, sleeping little. He showed his paintings in sidewalk exhibitions, but his earliest paintings, revealing the influence of the old masters in their subdued use of color, attracted few buyers. 1914 marked the beginning of four-and-a-half years of military service in World War I. Bombois spent much of it on the front line, earning three decorations for bravery. Upon his return home, encouraged that his wife had succeeded in selling a number of his paintings in his absence, he resumed his routine of night labor and daytime painting. In 1922, his sidewalk displays in Montmartre began attracting the attention of collectors. The art dealer Wilhelm Uhde \"discovered\" him in 1924, and exhibited Bombois' work in the Galeries des Quatre Chemins in 1927. In 1937, his works were shown in the exhibition \"Maîtres populaires de la réalité\" in Paris. His first solo show was in 1944 at the Galerie Pétridès. Critics compared Bombois' work to that of Henri Rousseau, which it resembled in its naïve drawing, crisp delineation of form, and attention to detail, although Bombois was less of a fantasist than Rousseau. The paintings of his maturity are bold in color, featuring strong contrasts of black, bright reds, blues and electric pinks. Drawing from his own experiences, he often painted circus performers and landscapes with fishermen. His paintings of women are emphatic in their carnality, and his landscapes are notable in their careful attention to space, and to the effects of reflected light on water. Bombois' works are on view in many public collections, notably the Musée Maillol in Paris."

  "text" : "Carloman (848 – c. 877) was the youngest son of Charles the Bald, king of West Francia, and his first wife, Ermentrude. He was intended for an ecclesiastical career from an early age, but in 870 rebelled against his father and tried to claim a part of the kingdom as an inheritance. Born in 848, Carloman was tonsured as a child in 854 in furtherance of his father's policy of preventing a partition of the kingdom (as had happened at Verdun in 843) by placing his younger sons in the church. Carloman was tutored by Abbot Wulfad, a future archbishop. In 860 Carloman was ordained a deacon and acquired the abbacy of Saint-Médard de Soissons. In the following decade he acquired the abbacies of Saint-Amand d'Elnon, Saint-Riquier, Lobbes and Saint-Arnould de Metz. In 865 Carloman's older brother and fellow ecclesiastic, Lothair the Lame, died and Carloman succeeded him in the abbey of Saint-Germain d'Auxerre. The next year (866), another brother, Charles the Child, whom Charles the Bald had made King of Aquitaine, died. With these deaths, Carloman became second in line to the throne after the eldest brother, Louis the Stammerer. Resenting being shunted into the church, and perhaps at heart a warrior, by 870 he had gathered an aristocratic following. No specific names have come down to us of those who supported Carloman, although they appear to have been mostly from Lotharingia and Flanders. Before his defiance of his father amounted to anything, he was arrested, tried and imprisoned at Senlis. His abbacies were forfeited. Pope Hadrian II unsuccessfully intervened to try to secure Carloman's release, but the latter escaped to Flanders, where he gathered a small army. The bishops of the province of Reims then met under the leadership of Archbishop Hincmar at Compiègne in early 871. They pronounced excommunication on all of Carloman's supporters in the province of Reims, with one dissenting voice—Bishop Hincmar of Laon, who was perhaps a supporter of Carloman himself. In 873, Carloman was re-tried and blinded, but he avoided imprisonment by escaping to East Francia, where his uncle, King Louis the German, gave him protection. He died there about 877."

  "text" : "Charles E. Bartley (1921–1996) was an American scientist, known for developing the first elastomeric solid rocket propellant formula, at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (now part of NASA) in Pasadena, California in the late 1940s. Bartley founded Grand Central Rocket Company in Redlands, California in 1952. Six years later, his company provided the fuel for the third stage of Explorer I, America's first satellite. Bartley eventually sold Grand Central and founded two other solid propellant rocket companies specializing in weather rockets and ejection seats for jets -- Rocket Power, which he formed in Mesa, Ariz., in 1959, and Universal Propulsion Co., which he established in Phoenix in 1963. He was elected to the American Rocket Society (now the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics) in 1951. In 1953, he was given a society award for outstanding contributions. A full essay on Charles Bartley's contributions to the world of solid propellant rocket motors and the business after their development is contained in:CHARLES BARTLEY interviewed by John F.

  "text" : "Cyril May is an Australian singer and songwriter who often performs with Jack McDonald. Born and raised on a farm in Hellhole Creek, Victoria, Australia. Cyril's philosophy of life is reflected in the words and music he has been writing for more than 40 years. As a young man Cyril left Australia to work his way through the South Sea Islands and Canada. He finally settled down in Long Beach, California with his American wife Dottie who contributes harmony to many of Cyril's songs. In song Cyril tells of his personal search for gold, feeling the freedom of hang-gliding, the purr of his motorcycle on the open road and his never ending love of Australia. In the early 1970s Cyril's surfboard washed him onto the beaches of San Blas, Mexico where he met Jack McDonald and introduced him to western style music. The two have since collaborated on several albums, with May performing vocals and guitar, and McDonald contributing various musical arrangements. McDonald, who now lives in Australia, collaborates long-distance with May, and the duo have recorded at least three albums together. May's first album, Off the Beaten Track, features the hit single \"Gold Fever,\" which was used in the 1999 movie remake of Dudley Do-Right and played as a lead-in to the American Outdoor Channel television show, \"Gold Fever\"."

  "text" : "Carlos Olguin-Trelawny is a film director and screenwriter. He was born in Buenos Aires, Argentina. He began courses on filmmaking at the ProDeo University in Rome. He also studied with masters such as Jean-Luc Godard in Paris. His first professional work was as second-assistant director to Academy Winner Russian director Sergei Bondarchuk for the 1970 film Waterloo. When he moved to New York City, he studied screenwriting with Paul Schrader and acting with William Hickey at the Herbert Berghof Studio. In 1974 he took two sabbatical years and journeyed to the Orient. He chronicled his life-changing experience in a book called Mundos sin campanarios (\"Worlds without bell towers\"). He returned to Argentina where he wrote scripts for television and worked as an assistant director in films. His opera prima, the 1988 film A Dos Aguas, won a Special Mention at the prestigious 40th Locarno International Film Festival. In 1991, Olguin-Trelawny moved to Los Angeles. There, he studied screenwriting at UCLA, directed shorts and documentaries, wrote for Telemundo/NBC and several screenplays and experimented with digital art. In April 2007 he moved back to his home town Buenos Aires to write two screenplays: La carta (\"The letter\") and Mujeres de mi familia (\"Women of my family\"). In 2011 Olguin-Trelawny was Executive Producer of Vidas de película, a TV series produced by the Director's Guild of Argentina (DAC) about in-depth interviews to living film directors from Argentina's golden \"60s Generation\" like Manuel Antín, José Martínez Suárez, Pino Solanas, Simón Feldman, Octavio Getino, Leonardo Fabio, and Héctor Olivera.

  "text" : "Charles Daniel Neff (24 March 1922–16 July 1991) was a missionary who had a great impact on the mission and theology of the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (now the Community of Christ). He also founded the humanitarian agency Outreach International and the Community One Resources Development Inc. also known as CORD. As an Apostle, a leadership position in the RLDS Church, from 1958 to 1984, he was responsible for helping start the church in Japan, South Korea, the Philippines, India, Nigeria, Liberia and Kenya. His missionary work in these countries challenged him to rethink the church's theology — opening it to the voices of other cultures — and confronted him with the horrific realities of massive poverty."

In Het Ierste musyck Boexken, the first collection printed in 1551, there is one chanson by Carolus Swillart or Swilliart (different spellings in different part books): Myn liefkens bruyn ooghen. In the second collection Het twueeste musyck boexken (also printed in 1551), there are five chansons by Carolus Souliaert: Een costerken op syn, Het soude een knecktken, Ick ghinck gisteravent, Ick truere/ Druck en verdriet and Wilt doch met maten. Susato also published one motet by Souliaert in the collection Liber secundus ecclesiasticarum (published in 1553). There are also a few sacral compositions by Souliaert preserved in manuscript."

  "text" : "Cesare Siepi (February 10, 1923 – July 5, 2010) was an Italian opera singer, generally considered to have been one of the finest basses of the post-war period. His voice was characterised by a deep, warm timbre, a full, resonant, wide-ranging lower register with relaxed vibrato, and a ringing, vibrant upper register. Although renowned as a Verdian bass, his tall, striking presence and the elegance of phrasing made him a natural for the role of Don Giovanni. He can be seen in that role on a famous 1954 film of the opera made during an edition of the Salzburg Festival under the baton of Wilhelm Furtwängler."

  "text" : "(For other people named Charles Harris, see Charles Harris (disambiguation).) Sir Charles Alexander Harris KCMG CB CVO (28 June 1855, Wrexham, Wales – 26 March 1947) was a British colonial administrator, Governor of Newfoundland from 1917 to 1922. Harris spent much of his first ten years in St. John's, Newfoundland after his father, a clergyman, moved to the island when Charles was a young boy. Harris began his schooling in Newfoundland before returning to England where he attended Richmond School in Yorkshire. Harris graduated from Christ's College, Cambridge in 1878 and qualified for the bar at Lincoln’s Inn. He began his career as a clerk in the Colonial Office in 1879. From 1896 to 1899, he worked on a Boundary Arbitration between British Guiana and Venezuela, and from 1901 to 1904 on another between British Guiana and Brazil. Harris became Chief Clerk of the Colonial Office in 1917. The same year, he was knighted and appointed governor of Newfoundland. Harris wrote essays on the history of Newfoundland and was a contributor to the Dictionary of National Biography. He was offered the position of Governor-General of Australia but turned it down in favour of retiring from the colonial service in 1922 at the end of his term as Governor of Newfoundland. In 1928 he edited for the Hakluyt Society Robert Harcourt's A Relation of a Voyage to Guiana by Robert Harcourt 1613."

  "text" : "Cezar Petrescu (Romanian pronunciation: [ˈt͡ʃezar peˈtresku]; December 1, 1892, Cotnari, Iaşi County–March 9, 1961) was a Romanian journalist, novelist and children's writer. He was inspired by the works of Honoré de Balzac, attempting to write a Romanian novel cycle that would mirror Balzac's La Comédie humaine. He was also under the influence of the Sămănătorul critique of Romanian society. As a journalist, Cezar Petrescu made himself known as one of the editors of the magazine Gândirea, alongside Nichifor Crainic and Lucian Blaga. For a long time, he was a member of the National Peasants' Party, and wrote extensively for its press, especially for Aurora. His major work consists of novels such as Întunecare (\"Darkening\"; 1928), Calea Victoriei (the name of a Bucharest avenue; 1930), Dumenica orbului (\"The Blind Man's Sunday\"; 1934), and Noi vrem pământ (\"We Demand Land\"; 1938). Notwithstanding his prolific output as a novelist, Petrescu is mostly remembered for his children's book Fram, ursul polar (\"Fram, the polar bear\"—the circus animal character was named after Fram, the ship used by Fridtjof Nansen on his expeditions). He is buried in Bellu cemetery, in Bucharest."

He has also released two animated Kivi and Tuki DVDs. Toiv adopted his stage name from his parodies of popular country music tunes that he reworked to convey Orthodox Jewish themes. He then transferred the name as a brand name onto the magazine, radio show, musical albums, and children's books which he has published for the mostly Orthodox Jewish market in the United States."

Chlodulf was the son of Arnulf, bishop of Metz, and the younger brother of Ansegisel, mayor of the palace of Austrasia. Before his ordination Chlodulf had married an unknown woman and had begotten a son called Aunulf. In 657, he became bishop of Metz, the third successor of his father, and held that office for 40 years. During this time he richly decorated the cathedral St. Stephen. He also was in close contact with his sister-in-law Saint Gertrude of Nivelles. He died in Metz and was buried in the church of St. Arnulf. In Nivelles he was locally venerated as Saint Clou, especially because of his connection to Saint Gertrude. His Feast Day is June 8."

  "text" : "Charles Walter de Vis (Birmingham, England, 9 May 1829 – Brisbane, Queensland, Australia, 30 April 1915), known as Devis before about 1882, was an English zoologist, ornithologist., herpetologist, and botanist. De Vis gained a BA from Magdelene College, Cambridge in 1849, became a deacon in 1852, and was rector of Breane, Somerset from 1855-1859.He gave up his ecclesiastical functions to devote himself to science, initially in England then after 1870 in Australia. De Vis also wrote under the name of Thickthorn, the name of his home in Rockhampton. He was a founder member of the Royal Society of Queensland of which he served as president in 1888-1889, and founder member and first vice-president of the Royal Australasian Ornithologists Union. His principal work concerned the fossil birds of Queensland (Darling Downs) and southern Australia (Cooper Creek), but he also described a number of extant bird species. In fact, he was more successful at the latter, because due to insufficient knowledge of stratigraphy and evolution, he—like many ornithologists of his time—mistook subfossil remains of extant birds for the remains of extinct prehistoric species. Among species he described were the white-winged robin in 1890, and the frill-necked monarch in 1895. De Vis also worked in the scientific field of herpetology, and he described many new species of reptiles. The standard author abbreviation De Vis is used to indicate this individual as the author when citing a botanical name."

He served in the Assembly of the Republic until 1991. He later became a reform member of the PCP, and was suspended due to his criticism, being spared to expelling in attention to his many and historical services. He supported Manuel Alegre, the independent Socialist candidate, in the presidential elections of 2006.

  "text" : "Cynthia Leonard (February 28, 1828 – 1908) was a suffragist, aid worker and writer, notable for her pioneering efforts toward social reform in the 19th Century. Born Cynthia Hicks Van Name, in Buffalo, New York, she married Charles E. Leonard in 1852. They had eight children, the most famous of whom was the entertainer Helen Louise Leonard (later known as Lillian Russell). While a young woman in Buffalo, Leonard became the first woman to stand behind a counter as a salesperson and later became a member of Buffalo's first Woman's Social and Literary Club. Four years after her marriage, in 1856, the couple moved from Detroit, Michigan to Clinton, Iowa, where Charles Leonard founded the Clinton Herald, that community's newspaper, still in existence today. Cynthia was on the executive committee of the Soldiers' Relief Association which established the first soldiers' home in the State of Iowa, attending to the housing needs of Union soldiers recently released from the 18th Regimental Hospital, then quartered in Clinton. In 1863, Charles Leonard sold the Herald, and the couple moved to Chicago. There Cynthia organized a fair to benefit the Freedman's Aid Society, helped found the Chicago branch of Sorosis and was its editor for a time, and was a member of the Chicago Philosophical Society. In 1869, she led the spiritualist faction of the women's suffrage movement at the Music Hall, one of the first women's suffrage meetings ever held in Chicago. Susan B. Anthony was a frequent visitor in the Leonard home. Cynthia organized the Good Samaritan Society, and after the great Chicago fire, she established a homeless shelter for the \"unfortunate\" women of the city. She was instrumental in the decision to place matrons in Chicago prisons, and she authored two novels: Adventures of Lena Rouden, or the Rebel Spy and Fading Footprints, or the Last of the Iroquois. After she separated from her husband, Cynthia took their two youngest daughters, \"Nellie\" (Helen, later Lillian Russell) and Suzanne, to New York City to launch the girls' musical careers and to broaden her own political horizons. There she organized the Science of Life Club and in 1880 managed a benefit for starving women and children in Ireland. In 1888, she became the first woman to run for mayor of New York City. She died in New Jersey in 1908. In a May 3, 1914 interview with Djuna Barnes, Lillian Russell said: \"To be a great woman, a great person, one must have suffered, even... suffered in great crises. What have I done that I should be famous--nothing but powdered a bit gently the cheeks that God gave me and smoothed the hair that I was born with, laughed and proven a faultless set of teeth. Any grinning idol, well painted, can do as well, but the real women, the big women, are those who toil and never write of it, those who labor and never cry of it, those who forfeit all and never seek reward. Begin this article with the name Lillian Russell, but end it with the name of such as was Cynthia Leonard.\" After the benefit for the Irish Famine, Leonard was accused of mismanaging (keeping for herself) some of the funds raised at that event."

Bach, whose post he attained when Bach left the court for Hamburg in 1767. In 1791 he founded the Sing-Akademie zu Berlin which quickly became an important centre of Berlin's musical life. In its concerts Fasch promoted the music of J.S. Bach and other masters of the Baroque period, as well as contemporary music. The Akademie was visited by Beethoven in 1796. Fasch also composed numerous works for the Sing-Akademie. His Mass for sixteen voices, a virtuosic mass accompanied solely by organ continuo, is a choral masterpiece of the late 18th century. Fasch died in Berlin in 1800. His grave is preserved in the Protestant Friedhof I der Jerusalems- und Neuen Kirchengemeinde (Cemetery No. I of the congregations of Jerusalem's Church and New Church) in Berlin-Kreuzberg, south of Hallesches Tor. He was succeeded as head of the Akademie by Carl Friedrich Zelter."

  "text" : "Chalom Messas (Hebrew: שלום משאש) was born in Meknes, Morocco in 1913. He was the son of Rabbi Mimoun Messas and his wife, Rachel. Chalom Messas attended an Alliance Israélite Universelle school. He was a promising Torah prodigy at a very young age, and was a leading student of Morocco's Chief Rabbi Yehoshua Berdugo. The Messas family is an old one, with roots deep within Spain and Portugal. Shalom Messas was appointed Chief Rabbi of Casablanca at the young age of 36, he later served as Chief Rabbi of all Morocco. In 1978, then-Israeli Chief Rabbi Ovadia Yosef asked Rabbi Messas to come to the holy city and become its Chief Sephardic Rabbinical authority. When he departed for Israel, Rabbi Messas was escorted to the airport by Morocco's King Hassan himself, who requested that the Rabbi bless him one last time before his departure, and with that was his last official act in Moroccan. He had worked on important matters of Halacha right up to his last days. He was said to be very exact in preserving Sephardic customs, and would work full days and nights to try to find a Halachic way to solve the issue at hand. As an author of many books, he wrote his first significant scholarly work, \"Mizrach Shemesh\" in 1930, and his last work, \"V'Cham HaShemesh\" was written in 2002.

  "text" : "Calvin L. Noble, born October 13, 1813 in Trumbull County, Ohio, United States is known primarily for spelling the name of Cleveland, Ohio incorrectly. Noble learned printing and founded a Democratic newspaper in Cleveland, the Cleveland Advertiser, in 1830, when he was but 17. As the type was too wide for his display head-line he left out one letter and changed the spelling from “Cleaveland” to “Cleveland,” and the public adopted the change. In September, 1833, he located to Fort Defiance, when all the Northwest Territory was \"a howling wilderness inhabited by Indians\". Mr. Noble was employed as a fur buyer for the American Fur Company, fur being the principal source of revenue in northwestern Ohio at the time. He later became an agent for the American Land Company, and then laid out the city of Bryan, Ohio, which became the county seat of Williams County, Ohio. He served in the Ohio House of Representatives, then as County Recorder and County Commissioner of Williams County. In 1856, Noble moved to Paulding, and became a probate judge. For 12 years, he also collected the leases of the Miami and Erie Canal, the canal having ceased operations. Judge Noble died in Paulding on April 10, 1889.

  "text" : "Camillo Berneri (also known as Camillo da Lodi; May 28, 1897, Lodi – May 5, 1937, Barcelona) was an Italian professor of philosophy, anarchist militant, propagandist and theorist. Berneri, a World War I veteran, University of Florence professor of humanities, and a member of the Unione Anarchica Italiana, had been opposed to the takeover of his country by Fascists, engaging in resistance until 1926, when he was forced to take refuge in France, then Switzerland, Germany, Belgium, Luxembourg, and finally the Netherlands. In all of these countries, Berneri was frequently placed under arrest and usually expelled. Although under constant surveillance, he nonetheless wrote on several topics, mostly anti-clerical and anti-fascist articles. With Carlo Rosselli, Berneri organized the first column of Italian volunteers to fight in the Spanish Civil War against Francisco Franco's attempted coup, where he took part in the battles of Monte Pelado and Huesca (in Aragon) together with the Spanish anarchists of Francisco Ascaso Column and the Italians of the Matteotti Battalion. He became highly critical of the involvement of Confederación Nacional del Trabajo (CNT) members in the Popular Front government, expressing his views in an open letter to Federica Montseny (Anarchist minister for Health). According to Noam Chomsky, During the Spanish Civil War Camillo Berneri “opposed participation in government and was against the formation of an army, meaning a major army to fight Franco. He said they should resort to guerrilla war.” During the Barcelona May Days, as squads of Communist Party of Spain members (apparently under orders from Joseph Stalin) took to the streets in order to hunt down leading anarchists, Berneri was dragged from his home and murdered. His body, riddled with bullets, was found during the night, near the headquarters of the Generalitat de Catalunya. He was married to Giovanna Berneri, and was father of Marie-Louise Berneri and Giliana Berneri, all of whom were also anarchists."

  "text" : "C. Kesavan (23 May 1891 – 7 July 1969) was the Chief Minister of Travancore-Cochin during 1950–1952. He was born in an Ezhava family in 1891 in the village of Mayyanad, near to Kollam in the then princely state of Travancore. Kesavan was influenced by the work of Padmanabhan Palpu, the social reform campaigner who was a member of the backward Ezhava community and a founder of the Sree Narayana Dharma Paripalana association. He became an activist for the Ezhava caste, seeking an improved socio-economic position for them, and in the 1930s he suggested that they should abandon Hinduism. He was an atheist. Kesavan wrote an incomplete autobiography, consisting of two volumes that described his life up to the time of his political prominence. A third volume was planned to cover that later period but was unwritten at the time of his death. The work combined the story of his own life with a wider narrative concerning the plight of the Ezhava caste of which he was a member. Udaya Kumar says that his \"early memories are tinged with two lines of injustice: the discrimination he suffered as an Ezhava boy on the streets and other public places, where he was forced to defer to upper-caste people, and the unjust exercise of authority by the elders and the upper sub-divisions within the Ezhava caste\"."

  "text" : "Charlotte Glennie (born c.1972) is an award-winning New Zealand journalist, who became the first Asia correspondent for Television New Zealand. She reported on the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami that followed, and won the Supreme and BestSenior Reporter Qantas Media Awards, and the New Zealand Special Service Medal (Asian Tsunami) for her coverage. She is currently the China correspondent for the Australia Network. Glennie grew up in Auckland, where she attended the Diocesan School for Girls. The school presented her in 2006 with a Women2Watch award for former pupils. She has Bachelor of Laws and Bachelor of Arts degrees from the University of Otago, and a Diploma in Journalism from the Auckland University of Technology in 1995. She has worked as a radio newsreader, and covered New Zealand's first MMP election in 1996 as a reporter in the parliamentary press gallery. She suffered a serious accident in Dubrovnik, Croatia on 4 July 2001, falling 8 m down a cliff near a seaside swimming pool. The fall came at the conclusion of a 10-month personal tour travelling from New Zealand to London through Asia. Ambulance officers airlifted Glennie to hospital with multiple injuries including an open fractured femur. Her parents flew in to see her while she received surgery and treatment at the hospital in Dubrovnik. She transferred by private jet to Wellington Hospital in London, and later flew back to New Zealand to spend several weeks in Auckland City Hospital. Reporting for Close Up, she covered the first visit of a New Zealand warship to a Russian port on 10 June 2005. To film the visit, she accompanied the Royal New Zealand Navy from Nagoya, Japan, travelling aboard HMNZS Endeavour and HMNZS Te Mana to the port of Vladivostok. During the voyage she was transferred via rope between the two New Zealand vessels. In October 2005, Glennie visited North Korea, and became the first New Zealand journalist to film there officially. For ONE News she covered the execution of Van Tuong Nguyen, reporting live outside Changi Prison. In 2006, TVNZ closed down the $500,000-a-year Hong Kong based Asia bureau due to budget constraints. TVNZ Head of News and Current Affairs Bill Ralston made Glennie an offer to run the bureau from New Zealand, but she declined, deciding to remain working as a journalist in Asia. The Australia Network employed her in June 2006, and as of 2008 she is their China correspondent based in Beijing. In this role she covered the 2008 Sichuan earthquake, and reported on the 2008 Summer Olympics including air pollution, algae at the sailing venue, and preparations of the Chinese athletes. Members of her crew were assaulted outside a university in Xining, near Tibet, on 19 March 2008, while attempting to talk to some students; someone claiming to be the director of the university attacked both her interpreter and camera operator."

  "text" : "Charles Robert \"Charlie\" Rappolt (23 August 1939 – 2 August 1999) was an Australian politician. A member of Pauline Hanson's One Nation Party, Rappolt spent five turbulent months in the Parliament of Queensland in 1998. A native of Cairns, Rappolt held a variety of jobs before he entered politics. He served in the Citizens' Military Force from 1957 until 1961. In 1961 he began working as an agent for his brother, described by One Nation leader Bill Feldman as a musician \"of some renown\". From 1974 to 1978 he ran his own building company, and was a licensed environmental auditor in Queensland and Victoria. During his time as an environmental auditor, Rappolt became interested in mining, and he soon became a mine manager, prospector and financier. He was also a commercial pilot, flying aeroplanes and helicopters for a time. Another interest of Rappolt's was football (soccer), and he volunteered as a coach and referee at junior level. On 13 June 1998, Rappolt was elected to the Legislative Assembly of Queensland, running on the One Nation ticket for the Cairns-area seat of Mulgrave. His parliamentary career lasted a little over four months, and he suffered constant media attacks after the revelation that his partner, Sandra Higgins, had taken out a domestic violence order against him. On 4 November, Rappolt resigned, citing the combined pressures of political life, ill health, and the Queensland press. The resulting by-election was won by Labor candidate Warren Pitt, who had earlier held the then-marginal seat from 1989 until 1995. Pitt's victory gave Labor a majority in its own right; indeed, Mulgrave was one of seven seats that would have gone to Labor in the 1998 election if not for leakage of Coalition preferences. Less than a week after his resignation, Rappolt attempted suicide and was hospitalised with severe depression. After his recovery he sought A$295 000 in damages from the Queensland government, arguing that his stint in Parliament had left him a psychotic manic depressive. He moved to New Zealand in 1999, in an attempt to flee the pressure of public life in Queensland. He was found dead in his home in Auckland, on 2 August 1999, apparently after having hanged himself. At a condolence motion in the Queensland Assembly, One Nation leader Bill Feldman launched a blistering attack on the Courier Mail, claiming that the newspaper was responsible for Rappolt's suicide attempts. Rappolt was survived by his partner Sandra Higgins, and three children."

  "text" : "Charles Arthur Broadwater (September 25, 1840–May 24, 1892) was a wealthy and influential Montana railroad, real estate, and banking magnate. Broadwater was born in St. Charles, Missouri. He was president of the Montana Central Railway, a spur line which ran between Great Falls, Montana Helena and Butte, Montana. He opened the Montana National Bank in Helena, and had extensive real estate holdings in the state. Montana's Broadwater County is named after him. Broadwater began his career in 1862 as a livestock trader in the gold rush town of Bannack, Montana. He soon extended his interests into transportation, becoming superintendent of the large Diamond R Freighting Company, which dominated shipping in the Territory of Montana before the coming of the railroads. In the 1870s, Broadwater allied himself with James J. Hill, founder of the St. Paul, Minneapolis & Manitoba Railway, which, in 1890, became the Great Northern Railway (U.S.). Broadwater was also one of the Democratic \"Big Four\" of early Montana politics, along with Marcus Daly, William A. Clark, and Samuel T. Hauser. He may, however, be best remembered for the luxurious but ill-fated Hotel Broadwater and Natatorium, which he built near Helena between 1888 and 1889. Broadwater died at his hotel in Helena, Montana on May 24, 1892 of the effects of influenza contracted in New York the previous year. More than 5,000 people attended his funeral. He is buried in Forestvale Cemetery."

She sang Tosca opposite every major tenor of her day, including Luciano Pavarotti, Plácido Domingo and Marcello Giordani. Vaness teaches at Indiana University. Her hire came as part of the school's \"Commitment to Excellence\" program, which also brought the matriculation of Jaime Laredo, André Watts, and Joshua Bell. She is a tenured professor of voice working with individual students as well as conducting the opera workshop classes. She began teaching in 2006. A number of her performances are on YouTube, including her most recent concert engagement in October 2008, where she performed the love duet from Pagliacci and \"Voi lo sapete\" from Cavalleria Rusticana."

  "text" : "Clarence Lee Swartz (1868–1936) was an American individualist anarchist, whose best-known work, What is Mutualism? (1927) is a book explaining the economic system of mutualism. Swartz was a friend of Benjamin Tucker, and frequent contributor of signed and unsigned editorials to Tucker's newspaper Liberty. In addition, he worked for a series of anarchist newspapers and journals: he worked in the mechanical department of Liberty beginning in 1891; he edited an anarchist journal called Voice of the People; and he served an assistant editor for Moses Harman's journal Lucifer, the Light-Bearer in 1890. Swartz was arrested in Kansas City, Missouri for distributing a newspaper called Sunday Sun in 1891. The charges were dropped when the prosecutor failed to show in court. He published two individualist anarchist periodicals at the turn of the century, I (beginning in 1898) and The Free Comrade (beginning in 1900). In 1908, Tucker's publishing business, including most of his books and plates, were destroyed in a fire, and after Tucker retired from publishing and moved to Europe, \"practically all of the literature of individualist anarchism [went] out of print.\" Swartz made efforts throughout the 1920s to revive the individualist literature, prepared and editing Individual Liberty: Selections from the Writings of Benjamin R. Tucker (New York: Vanguard Press), a collection of excerpts from Tucker's writing in Liberty, which was the first collection of Tucker's writing since Tucker's own collection, Instead of a Book; and in 1927, Swartz published his own book, What is Mutualism? a new synthesis of individualist and mutualist thought on economics and strategy. Swartz was a strong proponent of private property, in the individualist anarchism sense of the word, and critical of communist anarchism. In his 1927 What is Mutualism Clarence Lee Swartz writes: \"One of the tests of any reform movement with regard to personal liberty is this: Will the movement prohibit or abolish private property? If it does, it is an enemy of liberty. For one of the most important criteria of freedom is the right to private property in the products of ones labor. State Socialists, Communists, Syndicalists and Communist-Anarchists deny private property.\""

  "text" : "Carolyn Smart (born in England, 1952) is an author, mostly of poetry, who lives rurally north of Kingston, Ontario, Canada. She was seventeen when she published her first poem in an anthology entitled Vibrations (Gage Publishing, 1969), intended for study in schools. She continued to publish while studying English Literature and Eastern Religion at the University of Toronto. She gave her first public reading at Hart House in 1972, and began writing full-time in 1979, with her first collection of poetry appearing in 1981. As a teenager her earliest influences were ee cummings and Leonard Cohen, and in her 20s she became fascinated by Virginia Woolf, Sylvia Plath, Anne Sexton, W.S. Merwin, Galway Kinnell, Robert Bly and Michael Ondaatje. In later years she has been drawn to the work of a broad range of poets, both narrative and lyric, including Jane Kenyon, Marie Howe, Carolyn Forché, Selima Hill, Carol Ann Duffy, Mark Strand, Sharon Olds, Mark Doty, Lynda Hull, Patricia Smith, Elizabeth Bishop, Phil Hall, and Bronwen Wallace. Carolyn Smart's collections of poetry have been Swimmers in Oblivion (York Publishing, 1981), Power Sources (Fiddlehead Poetry Books, 1982), Stoning the Moon (Oberon Press, 1986), The Way to Come Home (Brick Books, 1993), Hooked - Seven Poems (Brick Books, 2009) and her poetic study of the Barrow Gang, Careen (Brick Books, 2015). Her memoir At the End of the Day was published by Penumbra Press in 2001, and an excerpt won first prize in the 1993 CBC Literary Contest. She has taught poetry at the Banff Centre and participated online for Writers in Electronic Residence. She is the founder of the RBC Bronwen Wallace Award for Emerging Writers, and since 1989 has been Professor of Creative Writing at Queen's University. She has recently returned—after a decade of narrative and persona poems—to write confessional poetry with a manuscript in progress tentatively titled \"Her, Standing There\", based on her experiences as a girl in the year 1963."

One of his centurions was put in charge of a group of captives, including Chiomara, described as \"a woman of exceptional beauty\". He made sexual advances towards her, and when these were rejected, raped her. He then offered, to assuage his shame, to ransom her back to her people, sending one of her slaves, also a captive, with the message. Her countrymen came to the appointed place with the ransom, but while the centurion was counting the gold, Chiomara indicated to them - with a nod, according to Plutarch, or by speaking to them in their own language, according to Livy and Valerius Maximus - that they were to cut off his head. She carried the head home wrapped in the folds of her dress, and threw it at the feet of her husband, saying it was right that only one man alive should have been intimate with her. The Greek historian Polybius is said to have met her at Sardis, and been impressed with her \"good sense and intelligence\"."

Bourdaloue desired for Judde to become his successor, but Judde's superiors asked him to sacrifice his talents and train his fellow Jesuits instead. He accepted this obscure office, and from 1704 to 1721 he served as teacher of the third probation at Rouen, and then rector of the Paris novitiate. His lessons were so admired that his students would copy them to preserve their memories in writing. Many of these copies can still be found today. Father Judde never published any of his works during his lifetime; however, thanks to the transcriptions made by his students, many collections have been produced posthumously."

  "text" : "Charles Cromwell Ingham (1796 or 1797 – 10 December 1863) was an Irish portrait painter and later a founder of the New York National Academy of Design during the 19th century. Ingham was a descendant of a man who went to Ireland as an officer in Cromwell's army (hence his middle name). He was born in Dublin in 1796 or 1797, studying art from 1809 to 1813 at The Dublin Institution with William Cuming before immigrating to the United States in 1816 or 1817. Settling in New York City, he distinguished himself by his oil painting, but also in watercolor on ivory, a standard medium for miniature portraits since the 18th century. His work in oil is marked by a high finish achieved by successive glazings. Ingham occupied a front rank with his brother as a portrait painter known for his paintings of young women of New York's upper class, painting over 200 portraits between 1826 and 1845, such as those including portraits as Flower Girl (1846), Day Dream, and Portrait of a Child. Later founding the National Academy of Design, he would serve as its vice president for a number of years until his death in New York on 10 December 1863, at the age of 67."

  "text" : "Clemens C.J. Roothaan (born in August 29, 1918 in Nijmegen) is a Dutch physicist. He enrolled TU Delft in 1935 to study electrical engineering. During World War II he was first detained as a prisoner of war camp. Later he and his brother were sent to the Vught concentration camp for involvement with the Dutch Resistance. On September 5, 1944, the remaining prisoners of the camp (including the Roothaan brothers) were moved to the Sachsenhausen camp in Germany ahead of the advancing Allies. Near the end of the war, the Sachsenhausen inmates were sent on a death march which Roothaan's brother did not survive. While a prisoner of war he was able to pursue his studies in physics together with other professors and students under the formal guidance of Philips. The work he was assigned to while cooperating with Philips was a foundation for his master's thesis. He obtained his master's degree in physics from TU Delft on October 14, 1945. After that he moved to USA, where he did his PhD thesis with Robert S. Mulliken from the University of Chicago, on semiempirical MO theory, while holding a post at The Catholic University of America in Washington, D.C.. He realised that the then current approach to molecular orbital theory was incorrect and changed his topic to what resulted in the development of the Roothaan equations. Prof. Mulliken mentions this work in his Nobel lecture as follows: I tried to induce Roothaan to do his Ph.D. thesis on Hückel-type calculations on substituted benzenes. But after carrying out some very good calculations on these he revolted against the Hückel method, threw his excellent calculations out the window, and for his thesis developed entirely independently his now well known all-electron LCAO SCF self-consistent-field method for the calculation of atomic and molecular wave functions, now appropriately referred to, I believe, as the Hartree–Fock-Roothaan method. He had moved to the University of Chicago in 1949 and his PhD was awarded in 1950. He then joined the Physics Department of the University of Chicago. From 1962 to 1968 he was Director of the University of Chicago Computation Centre. Later he was Professor of Physics and Chemistry at the University of Chicago. Since his retirement, in 1988, he has worked for the Hewlett-Packard Laboratories in Palo Alto, California, where his primary contribution has been in the development of the mathematical coprocessor routines for the Itanium chip. His method of analyzing pipeline architecture has been unique and innovative and greatly admired in supercomputer circles around the world. In 1982 Roothaan became a correspondent of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences. He is a member of the International Academy of Quantum Molecular Science."

Until her appointment as Undersecretary for the Environment, Loh was CEO of Civic Exchange, the Hong Kong think tank that she co-founded in 2000. She was named \"Woman of the Year for 2006\" by Hong Kong Business. She has worked in many areas, including law, business, politics, media and the non-profit sector, but is best known as a leading voice in public policy in Hong Kong, particularly in promoting democracy and environmental protection. She has long been associated with the campaign to save Hong Kong's Harbour from excessive land reclamation and overdevelopment. Loh received her Honourable degree on 15 July 2016 from University of Exeter for her contribution to environment protection. She said: \"To be among the young graduates at Exeter makes me feel young and energetic again. It's like having a second chance to do better - to make up for not having done by best when I was a student. Perhaps like me when I was at my graduation many years ago, young people don't quite understand their capabilities and capacities yet. They will learn more about themselves in time and try hard to accomplish what they wish to do\"."

Following the end of the war, he joined English forces during the Second Anglo-Dutch War serving under the Duke of York until he was killed during the Battle of Lowestoft on 3 June 1665 and later buried at Westminster Abbey. He married Lady Elizabeth FitzGerald, daughter of George FitzGerald, 16th Earl of Kildare and his wife Joan Boyle, herself daughter of Richard Boyle, 1st Earl of Cork.

He married Harriett Hodges at the parish church of St. Paul in Deansgate, Bolton on 19 July 1909. Foweraker was employed in various capacities by the club for 49 years, initially as a gateman and checker when Burnden Park first opened. At this time he was also employed by the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway Company. Acting initially as assistant to Tom Mather, when Mather was called up by the Royal Navy in 1915, Foweraker took on his duties before making the position his own in 1919. During his time there, he presided over the club's greatest triumphs. The FA Cup was won in 1923 (the White Horse Final), 1926 and 1929. He also discovered Nat Lofthouse, a player generally regarded as the best player the club has ever produced. In July 1938 Foweraker was presented with the Football League's Long Service Medal in recognition of more than 21 years' service to the club.He also served as vice-president of the Lancashire Football Association. When World War II broke out, Foweraker worked for the club on a voluntary basis, but ill health forced him to retire in 1944. He died in Bolton in July 1950."

Charles Richard Ogden was first elected to the Legislative Assembly of Lower Canada for Trois-Rivières in 1814 and was its representative until he was defeated in the general election of 1824, while he was in England. He was reelected in 1826 and served until 1833 when he was named attorney general for Lower Canada; he continued in that post until 1842. As Attorney-General, Ogden prosecuted the \"Patriotes\" who had been involved in the 1837 rebellion, 12 of whom were hanged. He also served as a member of the Special Council of Lower Canada from 1840 until the Act of Union. He was elected again for Trois-Rivières in the Legislative Assembly of the Province of Canada in 1841. Ogden's leadership as Premier in signing the Act of Union, and the rise of the reformers under Baldwin and Lafontaine reduced his political popularity. This, combined with his involvement in prosecuting the Patriotes left his reputation and standing among the French-Canadian population diminished. A complicated man, Ogden was known to be very popular among his constituents for his fluent French, his oratory and his sense of humour. He was notorious for his practical jokes, one of which was to paint moustaches on the sleeping passengers of a ship travelling from Montreal to Quebec City. Ogden left for England near the end of 1841 and returned to Canada for a while in 1842 before going back to England again, living in a kind of exile. He became a member of the English bar at Lincoln's Inn in 1844 and was named attorney general for the Isle of Man. He died near Liverpool in 1866."

In 1996, he became Georgia's first African-American Senate Majority Leader. Walker is a Democrat and is from Augusta, Georgia. Walker owned a myriad of small enterprises under the name The Walker Group. One of Walker's first ventures was a convenience store called \"Reklaw's\", which is Walker spelled backwards. Walker started a newspaper called The Augusta Focus that served Augusta's black community. It often expressed opposing viewpoints to Augusta's only daily newspaper, The Augusta Chronicle. Convicted in 2005 by a federal court in Augusta on charges including tax evasion, mail fraud and conspiracy (127 counts, in all), Walker is currently serving a ten-year sentence at a Federal Correctional Institution in Estill, South Carolina. His projected release date is September 26, 2022. An appeal of his convictions was rejected on July 6, 2007. Walker filed a petition for habeas corpus in March 2009. The federal judge who presided over his trial recused himself from presiding over Walker's petition in May 2009."

  "text" : "Charles Dove was born in 1879 in East Ham, England. He was regarded as a super-fit footballer, who in 1895 stood at nearly 6 feet and weighed 12 stone, considered large at the time for a sixteen-year-old from a working-class area of Essex. His main position was defender. He played for many local teams and was a schoolboy player of some repute, winning two medals as a right back with Park School.Upon leaving school he joined Forest Swift Juniors as a centre forward, before moving on to captain Plaistow Melville. Dove continued to make his name at Upton Park F.C. and with South West Ham, being regarded as an exceptional talent. Dove was an employee of Thames Ironworks and Shipbuilding Co. Ltd, working as an apprentice to the riveters and jumped at the chance to play for the newly formed Thames Ironworks in 1895. The half a crown (12½p) membership would have been a third of his weekly wage. On 31 December 1898 Dove completed the distinction of playing in every position for the club when he deputised for goalkeeper Tommy Moore in an away game against Maidenhead. He even kept a clean sheet and the Thames Ironworks won 4-0. Dove was an important part of the Thames team that won successive London League and Southern League Division Two titles, and had a connection with the club adopting claret and blue as their colours. Charlie had got the kits for the club at a very cheap price of £3.10s. They had come from his father William Dove, who was a professional sprinter of national repute, as well as being one of the coaches at Thames Ironworks. During the summer of 1899, Bill Dove had been at a fair in Birmingham, close to Villa Park, the home ground of Aston Villa. The scrawny looking Dove had been challenged to a race against four Villa players, who wagered money that one of them would win. Bill Dove defeated them, and when they were unable to pay the bet one of the Villa players, who was responsible for washing the team's kit, offered a complete side's 'uniforms' to Dove in payment of the bet. The Aston Villa player subsequently reported to his club that the kit was 'missing'. Dove would continue to be a major player for Thames Ironworks, and its later incarnation of West Ham United until his controversial transfer in 1901 to arch-rivals Millwall F.C.. In 1902 Dove suffered an injury which ended his playing career."

  "text" : "Colin Edward Hickey (3 July 1931 – 13 January 1999) was an Australian speed skater. He represented Australia at the 1952, 1956 and 1960 Winter Olympics. His seventh place in the 1956 Winter Olympics was Australia's best result until 1976. He was born in Fairfield, Victoria. Hickey became a \"rink rat\" when his father took him to the Glaciarium in Melbourne. \"I felt an affinity with it\" he recalled, saying \"To do it well is to feel like a bird flying.\" He earned the money to buy skates from selling newspapers. To get to the Glacarium from his place in Fairfield, he had to walk, take a bus and then a train. He tried ice hockey, but because of his small frame (he grew up to be 162 centimetres and weigh 56 kilograms), he was overlooked, and took up speed skating. He took a ship to Europe to reach the speed skating hub of Norway. He worked as a lumberjack, and learned to speak the local language. \"We did it hard, lived maybe two weeks at a time on just museli. It was difficult, but I had some of the best times of my life then. What was good was that they [the Australian authorities] had no control over me. We just did it all by the seat of our pants. All they'd do was tell me what times I had to do to qualify for selection, and it would be up to me.\" He found changing from indoor skating in Australia to skating outside in Norway a major change \"It was like going from ping-pong to lawn tennis, from dirt-track to Grand Prix ... the outdoor was so much more demanding, in terms of strength and technique.\" He said that conditions for Australian Winter Olympians used to be basic: We didn't get a uniform. I never had an Australian blazer once in three Olympics. In 1952, because King George had died, they issued us with a black armband and tie for the opening ceremony. Nothing else. You wore it with whatever you had. I had a green sweater and ski slacks. In 1956 I was issued with no gear at all, even though I was the best-performed member of the team by about a hundred per cent. I couldn't march without any kind of uniform, so I stayed in the hotel. In 1960 they gave us a duffle coat and a sweater and that covered everything you had. That was it. You had to look after yourself. Talking in 1993 about Sonnpark, a joint Australian-Austrian facility for winter and summer sports, he said \"Yeah. It's great ... I reckon it would have made life a bit easier in the old days. With that sort of back-up, we'd have given them [the Europeans] a run for their money.\""

The character of Morrie is famous for his \"Morrie's Wig Shop\" commercial which is seen as comical, and that coupled with his penchant for pestering Jimmy Conway about money leads most of the characters to see him as a nuisance. Kessler's character is based on Martin Krugman. He has had small roles in other Robert De Niro films, such as The Mission, The King of Comedy, and most notably in Sergio Leone's 1984 film Once Upon a Time in America as Deborah and Fat Moe's father. He also guest starred in a first-season episode of The Sopranos, as Shlomo Teittleman. He can also be seen in Alan Taylor's 2006 film, Kill the Poor. Low once served as Robert De Niro's real estate consultant and landlord. Low is 5' 10\" tall."

She frequently played the role of an Italian mother, and is perhaps most well known for her appearance in her son's film Goodfellas. She acted in films other than her son's. She was married to Charles Scorsese. Her father, Martin Cappa, was a stage co-ordinator and her mother, Domenica, was a shop owner. She published a recipe book, Italianamerican: The Scorsese Family Cookbook. Cappa grew up in a three-room apartment on Elizabeth Street, on the outer reaches of Manhattan's Little Italy, which was shared with 14 people, including boarders and relatives. In 1933, when she was working as a machinist in the nearby Garment District, she married Charles Scorsese, who also lived on Elizabeth Street and was also employed in the garment industry. The experience of growing up in Little Italy among first- and second-generation Italian Americans had a profound influence on her son Martin, who revisited their attitudes, values and way of life in his 1974 documentary, Italianamerican."

In Paris his brother-in-law, the painter Pierre Bonnard, introduced him to the artistic world and the avant-garde literature and art of the time. Bonnard also did several portraits of him.

  "text" : "Baldridge was admitted to the University of Chicago in 1907 and graduated in 1911 and was evermore devoted to that institution. He was poor boy with no scholarship in an elite college. During his whole life lack of money never stopped him from anything, and at the University of Chicago he paid his way by drawing signs for campus events. He became a campus leader, most likely to succeed, Grand Marshal of the University and a model for students who remembered him long afterwards. According to Harry Hansen, \"Men who knew him then will talk to you about him by the hour – but not necessarily about his drawings. They will tell you about his honesty, his candor, his sense of democracy, his unfailing good humor and his faith in his fellow man.\" After college, life for Baldridge was both struggle and an exuberant adventure. While looking for commissions as an illustrator, he worked in a Chicago settlement house and in the stockyards. He became superb rider while training in the Illinois National Guard Cavalry and with that skill worked as a cow hand on the King Ranch in Texas for a summer. When World War I began, Baldridge traveled through occupied Belgium and France as a war correspondent and illustrator. Using a German letter of passage he interacted with the conquered and their conquerors. He traveled through war zones on bicycle, horse cart and horseback until his money ran out and he returned to Chicago. Called to Mexico as a member of the National Guard he was on the Mexican/American border in 1916 to repulse Pancho Villa and in 1917 he joined the French Army as a stretcher bearer. The entrance of the United States into the war required his transfer to the American Expeditionary Forces (AEF). In the AEF he joined the talented team that brought the Stars and Stripes newspaper into being. Baldridge was the chief artist on staff that included Harold Ross, founder of The New Yorker, Alexander Woollcott, drama critic for the New York Times, and others who later achieved considerable fame. As a journalist, Baldridge traveled freely and saw as much as any general. His work appeared in virtually every issue of Stars and Stripes from March 1918 until the end of the War in November, 1918, and portrayed the full range of emotion of soldiers facing death at the Front. HaroldRoss called him the greatest illustrator of the War. Cyrus Baldridge saw as much of the War as anyone could, having traveled with the German army as a journalist in the beginning, and later being part of both the French and American campaigns. He had walked among piles of dead soldiers and lines of innocent people filling the roads after their homes had been destroyed. He had begun as an idealistic follower of the Wilsonian dream but, by the end, was dreadfully disillusioned with war and the colonialism that lay behind it. In the Chicago Evening Post he described what he had seen as \". . . a nightmare of horror: a red vision of machine guns and dead men, inspiring only a feeling of disgust for the cold efficiency with which it was accomplished.\" Baldridge's reputation as an illustrator was launched in the United States when his battlefield drawings appeared on many covers of Leslie's Weekly and Scribners. His illustrations in Stars and Stripes reached an audience of 530,000 soldiers weekly by the end of the War and many copies were sent home to family and friends. After the war he assembled his sketches as his first book, I was There with the Yanks in France. I Was There is a collection of sketches that record, better than cameras could, intimate moments of sadness, heroism and relaxation. The book's publication was more than an artistic triumph. Through it Baldridge meant to carry his perceptions of the War to the world. As he told Harry Hansen, \"If only I can make the public see what war is – what a dirty, low thing it is, and how brutal it makes men, fine clean men – then they’d fight to the last ditch for the League of Nations.\" Like most liberals in the 1920s Baldridge believed that war could be outlawed and espoused a one-world internationalism. He was a follower of Norman Thomas and at least once spoke on behalf of Jane Addams' pacifist Women's International League for Peace and Freedom. In 1922 he joined the Willard Straight Postof the American Legion in New York. Formed by John Dos Passos, Walter Lippman by other liberal intellectuals, it was the only Post to stand against the conservative leadership of the American Legion. In 1936, as president of the Willard Straight Post and chairman of the Legion's New York Committee on Americanism, Baldridge wrote and illustrated a 16-page booklet, Americanism -- What Is It, which was designed to be distributed in schools for use in the civics curriculum. Mild in tone and taking its ideas from the words of Lincoln, Washington, Jefferson and the Constitution, the booklet became the target of an attack by the American Legion leadership. Liberal thinkers like John Dewey and University of Chicago president Robert Maynard Hutchins gave Baldridge their support, but conservatives and, particularly, the Hearst newspapers loudly denounced it. The fight became national and even reached the floor of Congress where each side had its defenders. In the end, the booklet lost the support of the American Legion, but, selling in the thousands, it generated enormous discussion of important issues—starting with freedom of speech. Later Baldridge took more pride in writing and defending the little publication than anything else he had ever done and printed it in its entirety in his autobiography. In 1920, Baldridge joined his life with that of the writer Caroline Singer. They built a house in Harmon, New York, but frequently turned the key in the front door and left on long journeys around the world. Caroline Singer shared Baldridge's politics, becoming a leader in the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom. She shared his work life, her writing was often enhanced with his illustrations. But most of all she shared a need, at times an almost compulsive, to know the world through other eyes. They became wanderers who left New York time after time on adventures of discovery with hardly enough money to reach the tramp steamer that would begin their journey. Alexander Woollcott wrote of Baldridge in 1927: \"Caroline Singer is his partner in vagrancy. [They travel] light through this complicated world, will have no impediments such as contacts and neighbors and possessions hold them back. . . .[They] can lodge with equal comfort in the Ritz or the nearest haystack and move from one to the other with the readiest adaptability.\"Their travel was not tourism but was designed to help comprehend the great questions of the world. To understand better the background of the Negro in America, they moved, mostly on foot, across Africa from Sierra Leone to Ethiopia. Along the way they lived in native villages where Baldridge sketched and communicated with the Africans through pictures. They traveled light, he in a golf cap and she in anything comfortable. No pith helmets, no guns, never asking or accepting the special treatment demanded by other members of their race. In India, they never saw the Taj Mahal, but they met Rabindranath Tagore and participated in dark-of-night meetings with Gandhian nationalists. From this African journey came a marvelous book, written by Caroline Singer and lavishly illustrated by Baldridge, White Africans and Black. It is an elegant and respectful portrayal of black African culture written at a time when whites hardly even acknowledged its existence. The experience left them deeply committed to the rights of black Americans. Baldridge frequently worked for Opportunity, a journal of the Urban League, and he beautifully illustrated several books by African American authors. After his African adventure he convinced Samuel Insull to donate hundreds of his splendid sketches to Fisk University. Upon their acquisition, Charles S. Johnson, a prominent sociologist who was later to become president of Fisk, said, \"The Baldridge Collection represents the best representation available of African Life.\" Having seen the world and its people at close hand, Baldridge was intense in his refusal to work with any author who portrayed another race as inferior or foolish. More journeys followed to Asia and the Middle East, with other fine books growing out of them. Long periods spent in China and Japan brought him in contact with leading Asian artists. In 1921 he published A Chinese album, monotypes by Cyrus Leroy Baldridge in the journal Asia and later Baldridge and Singer together wrote A Turn to the East. The Baldridge style was considerably changed by his exposure to the spare lines of Asian, especially Japanese, art. For a short time in the 1920s he worked with Watanabe Shozaburo in Tokyo and the 1930s he used what he had learned to producing a number of fine woodblock prints, etchings and drypoints. This work in pure art, as contrasted with his work as an illustrator, was widely admired and in 1935 he given the annual award of the Prairie Printmakers of Chicago and at about the same time his etchings were exhibited in the Smithsonian. Baldridge's long and deep experience with the cultures of Asia, Africa and the Middle East put him in line for important commissions. He illustrated many books and articles with oriental themes the foremost of which were the stunning 1937 reissue of Hajji Baba of Isfahan by James Morier and the 1941 Translations from the Chinese by Arthur Waley. Both books were early Book-of-the-Month Club special editions and their illustrations, distributed separately by the Book of the Month Club, were framed and hung on walls in thousands of homes. In the early 1930s, Baldridge and a group of New York friends organized the Williard Straight American Legion Post to combat the dominant right-wing ideology of the Legion at that time. Baldridge was elected president of the Williard Straight Post five times and he was especially proud of a small booklet he wrote and illustrated for the Legion called Americanism: What is It. Released in 1936, the booklet was a simple restatement of American values, mostly quoted from the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution. It was distributed free by the Legion to thousands of schools, until the right wing leadership got wind that Thomas Jefferson was on the rise forced its withdrawal. In the 1940s, Cyrus Baldridge illustrated more than one hundred books and magazine articles and, in 1947, he wrote an autobiography: Time and Chance. The book is both splendidly written and lavishly illustrated. It was quite successful, being listed on the New York Times best seller list for months. Profits from Time and Chance, combined with several years of earnings from well-paid work with the Information Please Almanac, made it possible for him and Caroline to retire to Santa Fe, New Mexico in 1951. There they lived simply in a small adobe house among like-minded free-spirits. In Santa Fe, Baldridge began to seriously work in oils. His painting ranged over every possible theme, but chiefly portrayed New Mexican landscapes. In the thirty years between his retirement and his death, he hiked virtually the whole of northern New Mexico, sketching with charcoal or water colors, and returning home to complete his work in oils. A large number of these later works are in the collection of the University of Wyoming. The plan of the couple had been for Caroline to write while Cyrus painted during their years of \"retirement\", but from the time they arrived in New Mexico she suffered from a block to the great abilities that made her so successful in New York. She wrote hardly anything and completed nothing. Later it was speculated that she had begun a series of small strokes that eventually led to dementia and death. Caroline Singer died in 1963. Cyrus Baldridge remained incredibly active and vigorous, full of stories and opinions, until decline began in the mid-1970s. In 1977, he felt himself losing the battle against age. On the afternoon of June 6, 1977, he ended his own life with a pistol he had been issued in World War I. The bulk of his estate was left to the University of Chicago where a fine collection of his pre-1952 work can be found it its Smart Museum of Art."

  "text" : "Choi Eun-hee (born November 20, 1926) is a South Korean actress. She began her film career in 1947 in the film A New Oath. For the next 20 years, she was one of the biggest stars in Korean film and led the Shin Film company along with her husband, the director Shin Sang-ok. In 1978, Choi and Shin, whom she had recently divorced due to Shin having committed adultery, were kidnapped in Hong Kong to North Korea by order of Kim Jong-il. Kim's plan was to have Shin work as his propagandist and for Choi to be the star. Shortly after agreeing to the demands of Kim, they were remarried at his recommendation. The couple finally staged their escape in 1986 while on a trip to Vienna, fleeing to the United States embassy and requesting political asylum.According to the Internet Movie Database, from 1955 to 1985, Choi appeared in eighty-one films. She received the award for best actress at the 14th Moscow International Film Festival in 1985, for her part in the film Sogum. With Shin, she wrote an account of their years in Pyongyang. Shin also wrote his autobiography shortly before his death. In 2015, an English-language biography of her life (along with Shin Sang-ok) was published by Paul Fischer titled A Kim Jong-Il Production: The Extraordinary True Story of a Kidnapped Filmmaker.In January 2016, at the 2016 Sundance Film Festival, in the World Cinema Documentary Competition, a documentary about the North Korean ordeal, entitled The Lovers and the Despot and directed by Robert Cannan and Ross Adam, was presented."

He developed extensive interests in coal mines in the Swansea area of Wales, as well as mining, smelting and refining copper and lead. From 1744, he was as a government contractor supplying military and settler needs in Nova Scotia. By the time of his death, most of his money had been consumed by the mining business. Townsend was a regular supporter, in the House of Commons, of whatever government the King appointed. He represented Westbury between 1748 and 1768. He was elected for Wigtown Burghs in 1768 and sat for it until his death in 1770. He was the second Englishman to be elected and the first to actually sit in Parliament, for any Scottish constituency. Despite being a Member of Parliament for 22 years, he is not recorded as ever having spoken in the House. James Townsend MP was his son."

  "text" : "Cheryl Keeton (October 27, 1949 – September 21, 1986) was a Portland, Oregon lawyer who was found dead inside her Toyota van on the Sunset Highway (Oregon) by a passing motorist. At the time of her death, she was going through a long bitter divorce and custody battle over her three sons with her husband, Bradly Morris Cunningham. A trial that followed her 1986 murder inspired true crime writer, Ann Rule, to write her 1995 best seller, Dead By Sunset. Cheryl Keeton was interred in Bunker Hill Cemetery located in Cowlitz County, Washington (U.S. state). Bradly Morris Cunningham (born 1948 - ) was found guilty of murder and was admitted into the Oregon State Penitentiary on January 9, 1995 and is serving a life sentence. Since his incarceration, Bradly wrote and published an ebook titled \"Ann Rule Deconstructed\". The copyright is 2013. In his ebook, Bradly accused Ann Rule of being a liar and of exaggerating with regards to her \"Dead By Sunset\" book."

This was the first European translation of the pivotal work made available to a wide audience. De Meynard also translated numerous works by al-Masudi, ibn Khordadbeh and other Caliphate-era historians. He studied the history of Zoroastrianism, editing the Dictionnaire Géographique de la Perse, and wrote about the then-nascent Bahá'í Faith. He was involved in the editing of the 19th-century edition of Crusader sources in Arabic with French translations, the Recueil des Historiens des Croisades."

At Berkeley, her teachers emphasized “procedure and structure” and “compositional rigor” over emotional expression, which did not sit well with Crothers. After Lennie Tristano died in November 1978 she became President of the Jazz Foundation formed in tribute to him. She is known for works done with Max Roach in the 1980s, such as the album Swish. As a leader she headed a quartet with Richard Tabnik and Roger Mancuso. Crothers died of lung cancer in Manhattan on August 13, 2016."

  "text" : "Campanus of Novara (c. 1220 – 1296) was an Italian mathematician, astronomer, astrologer, and physician who is best known for his work on Euclid's Elements. In his writings he refers to himself as Campanus Nouariensis; contemporary documents refer to him as Magister Campanus; and the full style of his name is Magister Campanus Nouariensis. He is also referred to as Campano da Novara, Giovanni Campano or similar. Later authors (from the 16th century on) sometimes applied the forename Johannes Campanus or Iohannes Campanus. His date of birth is uncertain but may have been as early as the first decade of the 13th century and the place of birth was probably Novara in Lombardy. He served as chaplain to Pope Urban IV, Pope Adrian V, Pope Nicholas IV, and Pope Boniface VIII. His contemporary Roger Bacon cited Campanus as one of the two \"good\" (but not \"perfect\") mathematicians indicating that Bacon considered Campanus as excellent or one of the greatest mathematicians of their time. A number of benefices were conferred upon him and he was relatively wealthy at the time of his death. He died at Viterbo in 1296. The crater Campanus on the Moon is named after him."

  "text" : "Constance Eaton Hamilton (1862–1945) was the first female member of Toronto City Council and the first woman in Ontario to hold elected office at either the federal, provincial, or municipal level (one year before Agnes Macphail). The elective office of public school trustee was open to Ontario widows and unmarried women who owned property from about 1884, although the first female trustees to be elected in Toronto were in 1892. Born in Yorkshire, England in 1862 to Dr George Fowler Bodington (1829-1902) and Caroline Mary Eaton (1825-1873). She attended Conservatory of Music in Leipzig, Germany and became a pianist. Hamilton immigrated to Canada with her family in 1887 and settled in Vancouver. Hamilton married Canadian Pacific Railway land commissioner and civil engineer Lauchlan Alexander Hamilton (1852-1941), who was also Vancouver City Alderman and designed the Coat of arms of Vancouver. In 1888 the Hamiltons' moved to Winnipeg (her husband was transferred there as senior CPR land commissioner) and then to Toronto in 1899. During her time in Winnipeg, she was one of the six women who founded the Women's Musical Club of Winnipeg, and served as the first President when it was formally organized in 1899. A supporter of women's suffrage, she became president of the Equal Franchise League of Toronto. In 1919, women obtained the right to run for elected office in Ontario. Previously married women had been barred, by law, from doing so. Hamilton ran for Toronto city council and was elected for a one-year term in 1920. She was re-elected for another one-year term in 1921. After two terms in office she resigned so that she could continue to campaign for immigrant settlement and refugee issues, and for equal rights. In 1979, city council established the Constance E. Hamilton Award on the Status of Women. The award is made annually chosen by the women members of city council. To qualify, a recipient must be a resident of Toronto whose actions have had a significant impact on securing equitable treatment for women in Toronto, either socially, economically or culturally. Her husband died in 1941 and she died in 1945. They did not have any children, but Lauchlan had a daughter (Isabella) from his marriage to Isabella Hamilton (1858?-1888)."

  "text" : "Chaskel Besser (February 12, 1923 – February 9, 2010) was an American Orthodox rabbi for much of the 20th and early 21st century. He lived in Manhattan, New York. He was born in Katowice, Poland and lived there until the dual Nazi and Soviet invasion of Poland in 1939. He was affiliated with Congregation B'nai Israel in New York. He was a member of Radomsk Chassidic movement. His original family name, Koszycki, was changed by his father while the family still lived in Poland. His father, a successful businessman, and close associate of the Radomsker Rebbe, moved to pre-war Palestine. After Rabbi Besser escaped Poland and Europe in 1939, he was reunited with his family in Tel Aviv. He came to the United States in 1949, together with members of his family. He is the subject of a book written by Warren Kozak called The Rabbi of 84th Street. He appeared in the television program The Jews of New York talking about the experience of Jews in pre-World War II Germany. Rabbi Besser was the principal spiritual leader of the renewal of Polish Jewish life, and traveled their frequently to teach until not long before the end of his life. He helped to find Jews and rebuild Jewish life in Poland towards the end of the communist era, partnering with Ronald S. Lauder. This partnership established Rabbi Besser as the Director of the Ronald S. Lauder Foundation for Poland. He found Rabbi Michael Schudrich, currently Chief Rabbi of Poland, to move Poland to establish Jewish communal life, on behalf of the Lauder Foundation. In addition to his work to restore Jewish communal life, he also helped restore many Jewish holy sites in Poland, negotiating with the Polish government on preserving the legacy of Polish Jewry before the war. One of those Jewish cemeteries is in Oświęcim, where his maternal grandparents are buried. Among his children are Rabbi Shlomo Besser, a Rabbi and teacher active for the cemeteries of Eastern Europe and Aliza Grund, President of the women's division of the Agudah. His two other children are Mrs. Debbie Rosenberg of London, England and Rabbi Naftali Besser of Brooklyn, New York. Yisroel Besser, author of Warmed By Their Fire, is his grandson. Rabbi Yonah Bookstein, former Director of The Ronald S. Lauder Foundation in Poland, and currently a rabbi of Pico Shul, is one of his students. In 1992, Besser sent Bookstein to Poland to work at the Ronald S. Lauder Foundation Summer Camp with Rabbi Schudrich."

  "text" : "Cheong Liew (born Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia) is one of South Australia's most celebrated chefs. He moved from Malaysia to Melbourne in 1969 to study electrical engineering, but instead became a chef. In the 70s, Cheong opened his own restaurant Neddy's, where the menu consisted of mostly Malaysian and Chinese dishes. He used ingredients in his cooking no other chefs dared to use at that time; such as pigs feet, sea urchin and sharks lips. The restaurant closed in 1988 and Liew went on to become a cookery teacher at Regency Park, Adelaide. In 1995 Cheong took the reins at The Grange restaurant at the prestigious Hilton Hotel in Adelaide. The Grange showcased Cheong's creative cuisine and became one of Adelaide's most successful restaurants. After 14 years Cheong left The Grange and it was announced, in November 2009, that the restaurant would close at the end of the year. Liew has been honoured as \"one of the ten hottest chefs alive\" by the prestigious American Food & Wine Magazine, and inducted into the Hall of Fame in the World Food Media Awards. He was awarded the Medal of the Order of Australia in the 1999 Queen's Birthday Honours \"for service to the food and restaurant industry through involvement in developing and influencing the style of contemporary Australian cuisine."

He has hosted many shows including Casper & Mandrilaftalen, the Danish airing of Shooting Stars and Don't Forget Your Toothbrush (Husk lige tandbørsten), and the Danish version of Deal or No Deal. He also had a leading role in the Danish sit-coms Langt fra Las Vegas (Far Away from Las Vegas) and Klovn (Clown/Fool). He started his TV-career in the Danish children's show Hvaffor en Hånd? (Which Hand?) in 1991 but is also well known for hosting the very successful radio program Tæskeholdet (The Whack Pack). One of Casper Christensen's characteristics early in his career was his appearance, often including big glasses, whacky hairstyle, and an abstract clothing style. Christensen was also well known for his energetic appearance on screen. In this period, Christensen's most notable appearances were Casper & Mandrilaftalen, Tæskeholdet and Safari. In later years, Christensen has toned down his crazy appearance, and made a career shift towards more serious projects. Casper Christensen has also become one of the most sought after Danish TV hosts; hosting more mainstream shows like Grib mikrofonen, Deal no Deal and 8 out of 10 Cats, Da; 9 ud af 10. On 1 February 2007, Casper returned to radio with the programme Kongen af Danmark (The King of Denmark) on the Danish radio station TV 2 Radio. Casper Christensen quickly left TV2 Radio and instead began writing on the 5th and 6th season of Klovn with his long-time colleague Frank Hvam. The 6th season aired on TV2 Zulu in the spring of 2009. On 2 October 2009, he aired his latest project for the first time on TV 2. It is a live talk show called ALOHA!."

In October 1970, Torquay United paid £8,000 for his services, some of which was repaid in January 1971 when he scored twice as the Gulls came from 3-0 down to beat Lincoln City 4-3 in the FA Cup. In January 1972, after 32 league games (3 goals) for the Gulls, he moved to Charlton Athletic on a free transfer, but made only one substitute appearance before leaving.

Hohmann to serve as the 41st Chief of the L.A.P.D., to June 28, 1949, when he resigned under pressure during a grand jury investigation of police corruption. Clemence Brooks Horrall was born in Washington, Indiana and graduated from Washington State University. Horrall had become chief when Hohmann, under pressure from Los Angeles Mayor Fletcher Bowron, voluntarily took a demotion to deputy chief after he had become ensnared in a police corruption trial that had embarrassed the mayor. During his tenure as chief many significant events occurred that would shape Los Angeles during the decade of the 1940s, when the population of the city proper surged from 1.5 million to nearly 2 million people. Events such as World War II, Japanese-American relocation and internment (see Japanese American internment), the Zoot Suit Riots of 1943 and the Black Dahlia homicide roiled the city, as did the Brenda Allen vice scandal of 1948–49 that led to Chief Horrall's resignation after it was found that officers involved with the Hollywood madam perjured themselves under oath during grand jury testimony, as did Horrall himself. He resigned in 1949. Clemence Horrall died in 1960 from a heart attack and was buried in Forest Lawn Memorial Park, by Hollywood Hills."

In 1981 he interviewed Alan Douglas for an NPR documentary about Jimi Hendrix, which Street co-produced with then KPFA-FM 3rd World Director Bari Scott, and San Jose radio broadcaster Don West. He moved to New York in the 1980s, where he began producing records, starting with Blue Light 'til Dawn by jazz vocalist Cassandra Wilson. Wilson had just signed with the Blue Note label. The album was Wilson's commercial breakthrough and Street went on to produce often successful records of mainly female singers. Street has produced albums in a variety of genres, including pop, jazz, soul, and country. In a 1998 interview, he told the Los Angeles Times, \"I know it sounds corny, but I never learned how to separate music, to make distinctions between genres.\" His music production credits include Norah Jones, k.d. lang, Rebekka Bakken, Charlie Sexton, Meshell Ndegeocello, Joe Henry, John Legend, The Manhattan Transfer, Bettye LaVette, Chris Whitley, Geri Allen, Holly Cole, and others.

  "text" : "Major General Sir Charles Armand Powlett, KB (c. 1694 – 14 November 1751) was a British soldier. He was the younger son of Lord William Powlett, brother of the second Duke of Bolton, by his wife Louisa, daughter of Armand Nompar de Caumont, Marquis de Montpouillon, and granddaughter of Henri Nompar de Caumont, 3rd Duc de La Force. He joined the Army, rising to the rank of Lieutenant-Colonel and was appointed Lieutenant-Governor of the Isle of Wight from 1733 to his death. He was elected Member of Parliament for Christchurch on 3 April 1740, and on 27 December of that year he became Colonel of a newly raised regiment of Marines, which took his name and was later ranked as the 52nd Regiment of Foot. The regiment was disbanded on 7 November 1748. On 2 May 1749 Powlett was made a Knight Companion of the Order of the Bath, and on 1 November he was appointed Colonel of what had been George Reade's Regiment, later the 9th Regiment of Foot. On 26 January 1751 he became Colonel of the 13th Dragoons, a post he held until his death later that year. His second cousin once removed, Captain Harry Powlett, was elected for Christchurch in his place. In June 1738 he had married Elizabeth, daughter of Thomas Lewes of Stanford in Nottinghamshire and widow of Richard Dashwood, third son of Sir Robert Dashwood, 1st Baronet and a former High Sheriff of Norfolk; they had no children. Sir Charles Powlett was survived by Lady Powlett, who died in September 1756, by his stepson Robert Dashwood, and by his step-grandson Charles Vere Dashwood, of Stanford, who was later to name his eldest son Charles Armand Dashwood."

  "text" : "Charles Sheldon Hislop (1908 - 12 June 1984) was a Caymanian entrepreneur who, in 1932, began the first public supply of electricity to Grand Cayman. Hislop was born in 1908, in the district of Bodden Town in the Cayman Islands to parents Lawrence Henry Hislop and Ella Hislop. He was the third of six children. Hislop and his brother, Edward, traveled to Tampa, Florida many times bringing new luxuries back to Grand Cayman. They purchased an electric generator, the Ruston 9HRC, with which they set up the company Cayman Ice and Electric. The two were also responsible for the first ice cream shop. The store was first located on Harbour Drive near Hog Sty Bay and later moved to the corner of Cardinall Avenue and Harbour Drive. It was later relocated again to Shedden Road, where Mike’s Ice now is. At the shop, the public was also able to enjoy the island’s first jukebox, brought back from one of the many Tampa trips. Hislop married Claire Watler in 1932. Together they had seven children: Rose-Marie, Mary-Lee, Charles Delano, James Lawrence Sheldon, Ella-Kaye, Philip Clayton and René Karl."

  "text" : "Caryl Brahms, born Doris Caroline Abrahams (8 December 1901 – 5 December 1982), was an English critic, novelist, and journalist specialising in the theatre and ballet. She also wrote film, radio and television scripts. As a student at the Royal Academy of Music in London, Brahms was dissatisfied with her own skill as a pianist, leaving without graduating. She contributed light verse, and later stories for satirical cartoons, to the London paper The Evening Standard in the late 1920s. She recruited a friend, S. J. Simon, to help her with the cartoon stories, and in the 1930s and 40s they collaborated on a series of comic novels, some with a balletic background and others set in various periods of English history. At the same time as her collaboration with Simon, Brahms was a ballet critic, writing for papers including The Daily Telegraph. Later, her interest in ballet waned, and she concentrated on reviewing plays. After Simon's sudden death in 1948, Brahms wrote solo for some years, but in the 1950s she established a second long-running collaboration with the writer and broadcaster Ned Sherrin, which lasted for the rest of her life. Together they wrote plays and musicals for the stage and television, and published both fiction and non-fiction books."

At the age of twelve, Chistopher joined the British Army as an Ensign in the 31st Regiment of Foot. Before his first tour of duty in North America, Chistopher married Anne Howard, whose sister Maria was the wife of Guy Carleton. While in North America, Christopher Carleton met Sir William Johnson and lived among the Mohawk Indians, learning their language and partaking in their customs. He would remark in later life that the time spent living with the Mohawks was the happiest of his life. These skills would serve him well later. Christopher would be back in England when the American Revolutionary War broke out in 1775. In May 1776, Capt. Christopher Carleton arrived at Quebec City as part of a relief force for his uncle Guy Carleton, besieged in the city by the Continental Army forces. During the campaign leading up to the Battle of Valcour Island, Capt. Christopher Carleton served on his uncle's staff and in command of detachments of Indian allies. In 1777, Christopher purchased a major's commission in the 29th Regiment of Foot, in which his uncle Sir Thomas Carleton was a Lieutenant Colonel."

Christine launched The Mom Squad Show in January 2014 with Kyra Philips, CNN anchor and Chaz Kelly, radio veteran. The show is a brand new edgy daily podcast offering a unique perspective on parenting and family issues. Eads has worked in a wide range of jobs in television, radio, and stage. This has included commercials, voice-over work, and as a traffic reporter. She has also hosted the Washington DC show Hot on Homes seen on WUSA Channel 9. Prior to hosting Broadminded, Eads worked as a traffic reporter for XM Radio covering the Los Angeles and Detroit areas. In 2001 she starred in the controversial film The Profit as Leland Conrad Powers' wife, Helen Hughes. The film premiered at the Cannes Film Festival and was banned from release by court order in 2002 due to legal action by the Church of Scientology. Eads is also the founder of The Duffy House, a nonprofit organization which helps survivors of domestic and sexual violence .Christine has one 14-year-old son named Aidan. Christine Eads is the Executive Director of Rachel's Well, a 501c3 nonprofit organization. The mission of Rachel's Well is to empower and connect a community to advance the health and well-being of women and girls with Primary ovarian insufficiency (POI). POI is a rare disease affecting about 1 in 10,000 girls and young women by the age of 20. Christine was diagnosed with POI in early 2000 while participating in a protocol at the National Institutes of Health. Since being diagnosed with the disorder she has been an outspoken advocate for this disease. She is currently participating in a clinical trial involving genomic medicine at the National Institutes of Health. The collaboration with Washington University Saint Louis is conducting a natural history study investigating the interface of patient care and research in the genomic age. By the time she was 31 years old, Christine faced two blows to her reproductive and mental health. First, in her early 20s, she was violently sexually assaulted. Her attacker was never found. Then, a few years later, she was told she would never be able to have children due to primary ovarian insufficiency (POI). Despite this devastation, Christine uses her inner strength and past experiences to help others. Read her triumphant story on WomensHealth.gov. She believes in family support and being a patient advocate. Christine's background in radio, film and television combined with her personal experiences place her in a strong position to advocate for those in need."

Juste was embroiled in the controversy following the paper's September 2005 publication of several cartoons depicting the Islamic prophet Muhammad. In one comment Juste stated “We will not apologise, because we live in Denmark under Danish law, and we have freedom of speech in this country. If we apologised, we would betray the generations who have fought for this right, and the moderate Muslims who are democratically minded.” Juste claimed the international furor over the cartoons amounted to a victory for opponents of free expression. \"Those who have won are dictatorships in the Middle East, in Saudi Arabia, where they cut criminals' hands and give women no rights,\" Juste told The Associated Press. \"The dark dictatorships have won.\" Danish police thwarted threats on the life of Juste and Jyllands-Posten staff members. In another comment, Juste admitted that the 12 cartoons, one of which depicted Muhammad wearing a bomb-shaped turban, had caused \"serious misunderstandings\". Carsten Juste said: \"The 12 cartoons ... were not intended to be offensive, nor were they at variance with Danish law, but they have indisputably offended many Muslims, for which we apologise.\""

He is the father of Girl, Interrupted author Susanna Kaysen. He was married for 50 years to Annette Neutra until her death in 1990. In 1994, he married Ruth Butler. Carl Kaysen worked for President John F. Kennedy as Deputy National Security Advisor, and was directly under National Security Advisor McGeorge Bundy. Kaysen took over the position from Walt Rostow in 1961 and concentrated on the key issues of the Kennedy Administration such as nuclear weapons, foreign trade, international economic policy and international security policy. On President Kennedy's orders, Kaysen prepared a report on how to utilize the US nuclear arsenal to preemptively destroy the Soviet Union’s nuclear capacity and its ability to retaliate with nuclear weapons. Kaysen was also a good friend of long-serving Greek Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou, whom he had met at Harvard. After Greece was taken over by a military junta in 1967, Kaysen and John Kenneth Galbraith were instrumental in convincing President Lyndon B. Johnson to decisively intervene in order to secure Papandreou's release from prison."

  "text" : "Colby Buzzell (born July 17, 1976 in California) is an American author, blogger and former United States Army soldier. Buzzell grew up in San Ramon, California and enlisted in the United States Army at the age of 26. Prior to joining the U.S. Army he described his life as engaging in a lot of drinking, drug use, dead-end jobs and a minor criminal record. He was very optimistic about his Army service and was determined to follow the Army recruiting slogan of \"Be All That You Can Be\". He joined the service as an infantryman and spent 2003 - 2004 in Iraq, assigned to a Stryker Brigade Combat Team. In his book he expresses a great deal of enthusiasm about the benefits of wheels over traditional treaded armor in urban settings. It was in Iraq that Buzzell began publishing a blog under the title \"CBFTW\", \"Colby Buzzel Fuck The War\", as a replacement for his habitual journaling back in the States. The blog gained popularity quickly, because as an anonymous blogger, Buzzell was able to share more lucid experiences than an embedded journalist, and he was also able to share a bit more of the truth than the Army was able to. Buzzell's blog gained recognition for its realistic portrayal of gripping first hand accounts of the war in Iraq. This 'milblog' won praise as “an unfiltered, often ferocious expression of his boots-on-the-ground view of the Iraq war\" Colby published a book on his experiences entitled, My War: Killing Time in Iraq combining narrative, blog entries, and emails that evolved from his blog over time. The book received good reviews and has been recommended for public libraries. In 2004, Buzzell was profiled in Esquire's \"Best and Brightest\" issue and has since contributed regularly. In 2007, Buzzell received the 2007 Lulu Blooker Prize for My War: Killing Time in Iraq. In 2008, Buzzell was re-called for active duty. After he arrived at his post, he was examined by the medical staff at Fort Benning, and marked \"not deployable\" due to post-traumatic stress disorder. In 2011, Buzzell published the book Lost in America: A Dead End Journey, under HarperCollins about coping with his post traumatic stress disorder by taking a road trip to no where, all the while thinking about his newborn son, wife, and recently deceased mother."

  "text" : "Charles Basil Foster (born January 17, 1923) is an English-born Canadian publicist, newspaper editor, author and songwriter. He was born in Cheshire, England. During World War II he was a pilot with the Royal Air Force. The RAF sent him to a base in Alberta, Canada for flight training and while on leave he visited Hollywood. There, he met Sidney Olcott, a Canadian-born silent film star who introduced him to numerous other expatriate Canadian actors in Hollywood including Mary Pickford. After the war, Foster used these contacts to begin a career as a publicist in London and in Hollywood, working for such well-known performers as Marilyn Monroe, Richard Burton, Boris Karloff, Errol Flynn and Benny Hill. He was also a songwriter, contributing such titles as \"Goodnight Till Tomorrow\" (as Basil Foster) for Issy Bonn and others. Foster later became a writer for comedians in the 1960s including Bob Hope and Jack Benny and contributed scripts to a number of 1960s sitcoms including The Beverly Hillbillies. He returned to Canada in the 1960s where he became editor at the Brampton Times and Conservator. In the 1970s he worked as a speechwriter for the Canadian Government, and eventually came to Riverview, New Brunswick, where he still resides, to begin as newspaper editor for the Moncton Free Press. In his retirement he delved into his remarkable store of memories to publish three books on Canadians in Hollywood: Stardust and Shadows (about the silent film era), and Once Upon a Time in Paradise (about the period from the late 1920s to the 1950s), and most recent book, Donald Brian: the King of Broadway, about the nearly forgotten performer Donald Brian. For nearly a decade he has contributed monthly articles to the Seniors Advocate in Halifax, Nova Scotia. He wrote more than 100 articles for the bi-weekly Albert County Chronicle, a community newspaper, until it ceased publication in 2010. In 2010-2011 he had articles published in 21 magazines and newspapers in Canada, the United States, England and Australia. His autobiography, from Old Hollywood to New Brunswick, was released in November 2013. As the original publicist for the world's longest running play, Agatha Christie's, The Mousetrap, in London, England, he prepared a 60-page booklet of memories of Ms. Christie and the early days of the play, for the 60th anniversary performance in September 2012."

He married Jacobine Ida Sophie Motzfeldt, daughter of Peter Motzfeldt and niece of his own mother. The couple had two children; Anna Ernesta (born 1839) and Peter (born 1843). During his University studies, he had been chairman in the Norwegian Students' Society. He was a member of the social circle Intelligenspartiet, and befriended such notable figures as Anton Martin Schweigaard, Bernhard Dunker and Johan Sebastian Welhaven there. He served as mayor of Christiania in 1846. In 1847 he was appointed County Governor of Smaalenene (today named Østfold). While stationed here he was elected to the Norwegian Parliament in 1848 and 1854, representing the constituency of Moss og Drøbak. In 1855 he was appointed County Governor in the more central county of Akershus). In 1858 he was appointed Minister of Auditing. The road had been opened for Christian Birch-Reichenwald and his supporters, as Crown Prince Carl of Sweden and Norway, who was viceroy of Norway at that time, had requested first minister and head of government Jørgen Herman Vogt to \"tender his resignation\". According to historians, Birch-Reichenwald and his friend Georg Christian Sibbern \"used\" Crown Prince Carl to their own gains. Birch-Reichenwald was Minister of Auditing for one year, then became a member of the Council of State Division in Stockholm from 1859 to 1860, and then served as Minister of Justice and the Police from 1860 to 1861. In 1861, the governor-general position was discussed. Carl, who in the meantime had been crowned King, was unwilling to abolish this position, provoking Christian Birch-Reichenwald (and Ketil Motzfeldt) to resign. The governor-general office was not abolished until 1873. In 1862 Birch-Reichenwald was elected mayor of Christiania for the second time, serving through that year. He was also elected to a third parliamentary term, representing the constituency of Christiania, Hønefoss og Kongsvinger. From 1864 to 1865 he was mayor of Christiania for the third time, and in 1865 he was again elected to parliament. From 1869 to 1889 he served as district stipendiary magistrate (sorenskriver). He died in 1891 and was buried at Vår Frelsers gravlund."
