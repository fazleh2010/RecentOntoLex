Norton, 1943), Hough's career included: \n*  Working as a reporter for various St. Paul newspapers \"for about five years\" \n*  Writing for several outdoor magazines \n*  At various times between 1924 and 1936, serving as publicity director for the Izaak Walton League \n*  Proprietorship of an advertising agency in Chicago, Illinois \n*  \"Devising the application\" of the first soundproofing for airplanes and assisting in its application to the first China Clipper \n*  Invention of a type of outdoor clothing considered for purchase by the Russian army \n*  Service as a forest ranger \n*  During World War II, serving as a captain in the U.S. Army Air Force Those dust jacket notes quote Hough as saying he began writing for Colliers and The Saturday Evening Post in the 1930s \"to get my crack at the movies.\" It was in the course of moving his family to Hollywood, via Mexico City, that Hough passed through Jackson Hole, Wyoming, found himself without sufficient funds to carry through on his planned move, and settled briefly. While in Jackson Hole he pursued his writing for Colliers, inventing the characters of Hade and Steve, based on individuals he had met in the area. Hal Roach made some of those stories into the films listed below. Among the people he encountered, at least by reputation, in Jackson Hole was publishing heiress and philanthropist Cissy Patterson. Various anecdotes about her are recounted in the Cocktail Hour in Jackson Hole."

  "text" : "Drexell R. Davis (July 19, 1921 – December 16, 2009) was a Democrat who held several elective offices in Kentucky. He was born in Shelby County, Kentucky. For 100 years (1891–1992) the Kentucky Constitution did not allow any holder of statewide office to succeed themselves for a second consecutive term. As a result, a handful of Kentucky politicians became known as \"musical chairs\" officeholders because they would run for one statewide office and then another repeatedly. Thelma Stovall, Frances Jones Mills and Drex Davis were the best known musical chairs officeholders. The three often traded offices in given election years through the 1970s and 1980s. Davis began his career in statewide elective office by winning election as Clerk of the Kentucky Court of Appeals in 1963 on the Democratic ticket headed by Edward T. Breathitt. (Clerk of the Court of Appeals was a partisan elective office into the 1970s in Kentucky). Davis served as Clerk from 1964–1968. Davis ran for Kentucky State Treasurer in 1967, but lost. Davis won election as Kentucky State Treasurer in 1971 on a ticket headed by Wendell H. Ford and served in that office 1972–1976. He then ran for Secretary of State in 1975 on a ticket headed by Julian Carroll and won, serving 1976–1980. Davis then ran for State Treasurer again in 1979 on a ticket headed by John Y. Brown, Jr. and won, serving 1980–1984. Davis' last elective office was Secretary of State of Kentucky, which he won in 1983 on a ticket headed by Martha Layne Collins, serving 1984–1988. In 1991 Davis' son Drexell R. Davis Jr. ran for state treasurer but lost in a crowded Democratic primary to Frances Jones Mills who had held the office previously. Davis died on December 16, 2009 in Frankfort, Kentucky."

  "text" : "Dölpopa was born in Dölpo, but in 1309, when he was seventeen, he ran away from home to seek the Buddhist teachings, first in Mustang and then in Tibet. In time, Dölpopa became one of the most influential and original yet controversial of Tibetan Buddhist teachers. Originally a monk of the Sakya school, he developed a teaching known as shentong (Wylie: gzhan stong), which is closely tied to Yogacara and Buddha-nature traditions. Dölpopa is also considered to be one of the greatest exponents and practitioners of the Kālacakra or \"Wheel of Time\" tantra:It is important to keep in mind that Dölpopa was a consummate practitioner of the Six-branch Yoga, the perfection-stage practices of the Kālacakra tantra, and although he based his doctrinal discussions upon scripture, in particular the Kālacakra-related cycles, his own experience in meditation was crucial to the formulation of his theories.In 1314, when he was twenty-two years old, Dölpopa received full monastic ordination from the famous abbot of Choelung Monastery, Sönam Trakpa (1273–1352), and made a vow at the time to never eat slaughtered meat again. In 1321, Dölpopa visited Jonang Monastery at Jomonang (which was later destroyed during the Cultural Revolution) for the first time. He then visited Tsurphu Monastery for the first time and had extensive discussions with Rangjung Dorje, 3rd Karmapa Lama, about doctrinal issues. It appears that the Karmapa Lama almost certainly influenced the development of some of Dölpopa's theories, possibly including shentong. Other than this, Dölpopa had studied almost completely under the Sakya tradition until he was thirty years old in 1322 and he had taught for most of the previous decade at the great Sakya Monastery. In 1327, after the death of his guru Yönden Gyantso, Dölpopa decided to fulfill a prayer he had made at the great stupa at Trophu (Khro phu) to repay his master's kindness. \"He also felt that the stūpa would become an object of worship for people who were not fortunate enough to engage in study, contemplation, and meditation, and therefore provide them with the opportunity to accumulate virtue.\" In 1329 a large stūpa was quickly built at Upper Zangden (Wylie: bzang ldan), but it collapsed. In 1330 the foundations for a much larger stūpa were laid at a new site in Lower Zangden. It was a massive undertaking and involved many workers and artisans. Support flowed in from around Tibet. It was finally consecrated in 1333 and was the largest stūpa temple or kumbum (Wylie: sku 'bum in Tibet. After the construction of the stūpa, he spent many years studying and in meditation retreat. He became widely recognised as one of the great Buddhist masters of Tibet. Many offerings were sent to him including gold from Sakya Tishri Kunga Gyaltsen and a golden mandala from Rangjung Dorje. Dölpopa retired from the leadership of Jonang Monastery in 1338 and appointed the translator lotsawa Lödro Bal to succeed him. Lödro Bal remained in this role for seventeen years."

  "text" : "Debra Oswald  (born 30 August 1959) is an Australian writer for film, television, stage, radio and children's fiction. In 2008 her Stories in the Dark won Best Play in the NSW Premier's Literary Awards. She is creator and head writer of the Channel 10 drama series Offspring, for which she won the 2011 NSW Premier's Literary Award and the 2014 AACTA Award for best TV screenplay. Her novel Useful was published by Penguin in January 2015. She began writing as a teenager. Her first play was workshopped at the 1977 Australian National Playwrights Conference when she was 17, and then broadcast on ABC Radio. She studied at the Australian National University and at the Australian Film Television and Radio School and has since made her living as a writer for film, television, stage and radio as well as publishing a number of novels for children. She lives in Sydney with the author and radio personality Richard Glover; they have two sons. Her best-known play, Dags, has had many productions around Australia and has been published and performed in Britain and the United States. Debra's other plays include Going Under, produced by Adelaide's Troupe Theatre in 1983, and Lumps, which premiered at the Q Theatre in 1993. In 1996, a co-production of Debra's play Gary's House by Playbox and the Q Theatre played in Melbourne, Penrith and the Gold Coast. There have also been productions in Adelaide, Hobart, Newcastle, Canberra and Hjoerring, Denmark. Gary's House was on the New South Wales Year 12 drama syllabus. In 2000, her play Sweet Road was presented in Melbourne and Adelaide in a Playbox/STC of SA co production, and in Sydney by the Ensemble Theatre. Sweet Road, Gary's House and The Peach Season were all short-listed for the New South Wales Premier's Literary Awards. Mr Bailey's Minder and The Peach Season both premiered at Griffin Theatre Company. Mr Bailey's Minder toured nationally in 2006 and premiered in the United States in 2008 at The Walnut Street Theatre in Philadelphia. Gary's House was staged in Japanese in Tokyo by Rakutendan Theatre in 2008. Her writing for television includes the mini series Palace of Dreams (1985) as well as Dancing Daze (1986), Police Rescue (1991), Bananas in Pyjamas (1992), Wildside (1997), Swinging (1997), The Secret Life of Us (2001), and Outriders (2001). Her Police Rescue scripts have been nominated for AFI, AWGIE and State Library awards. Her telemovie Offspring was filmed in late 2009, produced by Southern Star/John Edwards and Network Ten; a series based on Offspring was broadcast in 2010. Five series of Offspring were broadcast between 2010 and 2014. Debra is also the author of the children's novels Me and Barry Terrific (1987) and The Return of the Baked Bean (1990) and The Fifth Quest (2002). She has also written three Aussie Bites – Nathan and the Ice Rockets (1998), Frank and the Emergency Joke (2000), and \"Frank and the Secret Club\". The Redback Leftovers (2000) is an entertaining story for upper primary students about the debut season of the worst soccer team ever. It has been republished in 2007. Her two most recent novels for young people are Getting Air (2007), a story about skateboarding, andBlue Noise (2009), a book about teenagers who establish a blues band. She has written four plays for teenage audiences, the most recent of which is House on Fire, performed by the Australian Theatre for Young People in June 2010. She's written two previous plays for the Australian Theatre for Young People – Skate, which toured to the Belfast Festival, and Stories in the Dark . Of Stories in the Dark, her winner in the NSW Literary Awards, the judges said: \"By engaging us with dark tales, paradoxically told as a distraction in a time of war, Oswald probes the role of imagination in survival, with insight and a sureness of craft.... Debra Oswald's clear-eyed, compassionate play shows us the role of story in making sense, and thus its place in the persistence of hope.\""

She then moved to UCLA and to Middlesex University where she received her PhD in music. Deborah Mollison is best known for her scores for films and television programmes, but she has a greater diversity of style: songs, jazz, rock and orchestral works. She has composed for commissions from the London Philharmonic Orchestra and the Britten Sinfonia. She sees the role of a composer in society as a commentator. Her ability to empathise with her subjects brings great emotional depth to her work. For example, \"Global Nation\" celebrates a multi-cultural world set into England's \"green and pleasant land\"; \"Ocean Witness\" highlights the suffering of whales and dolphins at the hands of Man. Her creativity allows her to combine her skills of orchestration with those of the MIDI studio programmer/musician."

  "text" : "Diarmuid Byron O'Connor (born 7 December 1964) is a British artist, best known for his sculpture. He attended the John Fisher School in Purley, with presenter Matthew Wright. In 1984, he started at art college in Bristol. In 1986 he joined \"Changing Places\", a community and environmental arts project, as a stone carver – leaving in 1988. In 1991 he studied conceptual fine art at Chelsea School of Art, London. Starting a decorating firm, Byron-O'Connor worked evenings sculpting with wax at home. He was commissioned to create a statue of Peter Pan to stand outside Great Ormond Street Hospital  which was given the rights to the character by creator J. M. Barrie. Following the unveiling of this work and an exhibition of small bronzes in 2000, he built a studio for private commissions. In 2005 he added a scale statue of Tinker Bell to the one of Peter Pan, unveiled by The Countess of Wessex. Byron-O'Connor's research into World War I led to him designing sets for BBC2's The Trench; BBC1's The Somme - From Defeat to Victory; and the Discovery Channel's Mud, Blood, and Tarmac. Whilst working on the set for BBC1's The Crafty Tricks of War he was asked to co present the series with Dick Strawbridge. He subsequently made Geronimo with Fearne Cotton for BBC1. Byron-O'Connor designed, built and codirected the Escape Bar and Art Gallery, a project in southwest London to get new art talent together with a new audience. In 2008, Byron-O’Connor along with teacher and fellow sculptor Adam Butcher set up Site Specific Sculpture in Schools ( SSSiS). Piloting the project at Butcher’s workplace, Chestnut Grove School, London aiming to utilise the creative process to engage students with a broad range of subjects from the perspective of an artist. The project centres on the principle that knowledge sought and applied is more likely to be retained. All students answer a brief to create a sculpture within all the real parameters of an actual sculptor right down to Health and safety and budgets. A competition decides from the leading feasible solutions and Byron-O’Connor completes the pieces collaboratively. The project recently unveiled its latest sculpture \"Big Fish Little Fish\" at Torpoint Community College, Cornwall. In the spring of 2011 Byron-O’Connor worked with over 700 Primary school children across three counties affected by the A3 tunnel at Hindhead. With the help of the tunnel constructors Balfour Beatty and Creative Partnerships he is completing a piece for each of the 5 schools involved. The aim is to create a final piece for the National Trust at the Devil's Punch Bowl,Surrey."

  "text" : "Dorothy Dobbie (born January 5, 1945) was a Canadian politician. She served in the Canadian House of Commons from 1988 to 1993, as a member of the Progressive Conservative Party. Dobbie was a publisher before entering political life, and was a founder of Association Publications Ltd. She was the first woman to serve as president of the Winnipeg Chamber of Commerce. In 1983, she was named Outstanding Business Citizen of the Year by the Manitoba Chamber of Commerce. She was narrowly elected to the House of Commons in the 1988 election, defeating Liberal candidate Allan Kaufman by 715 votes. The Progressive Conservatives won a majority government in the election, and Dobbie entered parliament as a government backbencher. She served as parliamentary secretary to several ministers between 1989 and 1993, as was co-chair of the Castonguay-Dobbie Committee on the Renewal of Canada. The committee's recommendations later formed the basis of the government's Charlottetown Accord, which was defeated in a national referendum. Dobbie supported Jean Charest's bid to succeed Brian Mulroney as Progressive Conservative party leader in 1993 (Winnipeg Free Press, 11 June 1993), and retained her own nomination over a challenge from Charles Maximilian (Winnipeg Free Press, 16 March 1993). The PC Party was resoundingly defeated in the 1993 election, losing all but two of its parliamentary seats. Dobbie lost her candidate's deposit, receiving 6,432 votes (12.29%) for a third-place finish against Liberal Reg Alcock. During the campaign, she accused the rival Reform Party of being controlled by Christian fundamentalists and criticized her own party for running advertisements that mocked Liberal leader Jean Chrétien's facial deformity (Winnipeg Free Press, 17 October 1993). She also called for the abolition of the Canadian Senate (Winnipeg Free Press, 18 July 1993). In 1997, Dobbie was appointed to the Canadian Broadcast Standards Council - Prairie Region. After Charest's resignation as Progressive Conservative Party leader in 1998, she endorsed Joe Clark to be his successor (Toronto Star, 29 June 1998). Dobbie helped to found Pegasus Publications Inc. in 1996, and still serves as its president. She is now the publisher of Manitoba Gardener, Ontario Gardener and Alberta Gardener magazines, and has written several articles on gardening. She opposed the Progressive Conservative Party's merger with the Canadian Alliance in 2003, and endorsed Liberal candidate Glen Murray in the 2004 federal election."

He served as a balloon and airship rigger in the U. S. Navy during World War II. He was one of the driving forces behind the hot-air ballooning revival after the war while a student at the University of Minnesota. He made the first post-war free flight in 1947 with a captured Japanese balloon. In 1948, he organized the first balloon club in the United States, the Balloon Club of America. This club, along with the Balloon Flyers of Akron, formed the Balloon Federation of America, today the national organization for ballooning. He pioneered plastic and Mylar balloons. In 1962, he set a new altitude record for a second-class free flight balloon, climbing to 17,000 feet. On 13 April 1963, he and Ed Yost were the first people to cross the English Channel in a hot air balloon. He also promoted ballooning as a sport and designed balloons to that end, through his company Piccard Balloons. He appeared as a \"Mr. X\" guest on \"What's My Line\" on September 1, 1963."

  "text" : "Domenico Trezzini (c. 1670 – 1734) was a Swiss Italian architect who elaborated the Petrine Baroque style of Russian architecture. Domenico was born in Astano, near Lugano, in the Italian-speaking Ticino (at that time a condominium of the Old Swiss Confederacy). He probably studied in Rome. Subsequently, as he was working in Denmark, he was offered by Peter I of Russia, among other architects, to design buildings in the new Russian capital city, St. Petersburg. Since 1703, when the city was founded, he substantially contributed to its most representative buildings. The Peter and Paul Fortress with the Peter and Paul Cathedral, the Twelve Collegia Building (now the main building of Saint Petersburg University) as well as Peter's Summer House count among his many achievements. He also helped found and design Kronstadt and the Alexander Nevsky Monastery. Domenico Trezzini was very important for another aspect of Russian architectural history: in founding a school based on the European model, he laid the foundations for the development of the Petrine Baroque. As a testimony of the cordial relationship that linked Domenico Trezzini with the Tsar, his son Pietro (who also became a noted architect, not to be confused with Pietro Antonio Trezzini) had Peter I of Russia himself as a godfather."

  "text" : "David Lim (born 1964) is a Singaporean mountaineer and motivational speaker who led the first Singapore Mount Everest Expedition in 1998. Between 1994 and 1998, he led and organised a team from the flat tropical island nation to the top of Everest. Sustaining an injury on the summit push, he did not make the summit himself though two other team members succeeded in making the top on May 25, 1998. A week after his return, and not related to the climb, he was stricken with Guillain–Barré syndrome, a rare nerve disorder where the immune system attacks the peripheral nerves. Paralysed from eyes down, he spent six months in hospitals, and emerged partially disabled in both legs. He returned to mountaineering, and since 1999, has led more than 15 expeditions, including the first all-Singapore ascent of Argentina's Aconcagua (6962m), and the world's third solo of Ojos del Salado, the highest volcano in the world (6893m). In summer 2005, he led the first Southeast Asian team to climb virgin peaks in the Tien Shan mountain range on the Kazakh-Kyrgyz border. The team summitted three peaks, now officially recognised as Temasek, Singapura, and Ong Teng Cheong peaks. In 2009, he formed another team for the Tien Shan, summitting three more virgin peak, the highest and hardest being Majulah Peak ( 5152m). His most recent expedition was to the Qinghai region of China. Lim and his fellow mountaineer partner, Mohammed Rozani bin Maarof, summitted a 6000-metre virgin peak and named it Sangay Ri. Lim has a B.A. in Law from Cambridge University. He has also authored two books, Mountain to Climb: The Quest for Everest and Beyond and Against Giants: The Life and Climbs of a Disabled Mountaineer, both published by Epigram Books. His third book, How Leaders Lead: 71 Lessons in Leading Yourself & Others is self-published. Lim is owner of a leadership and coaching consultancy (Everest Motivation Team Pte Ltd) and has delivered programmes and presentations in 71 cities and 29 countries, combining experiences in leadership in the mountains with corporate models; and delivering presentations and workshops around the world."

  "text" : "Dilawar Khan Ghori was governor of the Malwa province of central India during the decline of the Delhi Sultanate. After serving at the court in Delhi, he was appointed governor at Dhar in A.H. 793/C.E. 1390-91. Dilawar Khan took the title of 'Amid Shāh Dā'ūd and caused the khutba to be read in his name in A.H. 804/C.E. 1401-02. He passed his kingdom – the Malwa Sultanate – to his son Hoshang Shah upon his death in A.H. 809/C.E. 1406. Dilawar Khan in the reign of the Later Tughluqs (1391/92 - 1401/02) Dilawar Khan was the follower of Firuz Shah Tughluq's son, Muhammad ibn Firuz, later known as Muhammad Shah. He was imprisoned by the court officials at Delhi for his support for the rebel prince. Not only Dilawar Khan, but many important provincial governors, such as that of Gujarat, and various other important and powerful nobles of the court supported the Prince' claim to the throne. After Timur's invasion in 1398, the same prince, who was the then Sultan of Delhi, ran away from the capital and sought shelter, first in the Gujarat Sultanate, but receiving a less than enthusiastic response there, moved to the Malwa Sultanate. Dilawar Khan is said to have welcomed him with open arms and told him that his Sultanate and treasure was all for the service of the Delhi Sultan."

  "text" : "David Massengill (born 1951, Bristol, Tennessee) is an American folk singer/songwriter, guitar and appalachian dulcimer player. His best-known songs include \"On The Road to Fairfax County,\" recorded by The Roches and by Joan Baez, \"The Great American Dream,\" and \"My Name Joe,\" about an illegal immigrant restaurant worker. For some years after he began recording, Massengill maintained a day job as a restaurant dishwasher. He also contributed his poignant dulcimer-centered version of \"The Crucifixion\" to 2001's multi-artist double-disc tribute to Phil Ochs, What's That I Hear. In addition to his skills as a singer-songwriter, guitarist, and both virtuoso and educator on the appalachian dulcimer, he is also a prolific author-illustrator of pocket-sized children's books and has performed and recorded children's music. Massengill toured frequently with long-time friend and fellow songwriter Jack Hardy as a duo called the Folk Brothers, until Hardy's death in 2011. As a music educator, Massengill is famed for presenting his \"Taking the Dull out of Dulcimer\" workshops at festivals and music gatherings around North America, and is one of the instrument's prime proponents in the field of melding traditional and contemporary music styles (including alternate tunings); and is a mentor to many in the dulcimer and folk community in general."

In 1785, he began work as a clerk for a fur trading company in the Lake Nipigon area. In 1795, he joined the North West Company and became a partner in charge of the Nipigon department. In 1807, he was placed in charge of the Lake Winnipeg department with Alexander MacKay and, in 1811, took charge of the Lac La Pluie department. Throughout this period, he had been in fierce competition with the Hudson's Bay Company. In 1814, he and Alexander Macdonell were placed in charge of the Red River department. They stirred up resentment among the Métis people and led raids against the Hudson's Bay Red River Colony. He was arrested by Colin Robertson and sent back to England for trial. He was acquitted and compensated for false arrest. In 1820, he returned to Upper Canada and settled in Glengarry County. Cameron represented the county in the 9th Parliament. He died at Williamstown in 1848."

Byrnes and served as Assistant Secretary of State for Administration from 1945 to 1947. From 1952 to 1957 he served as president of the University of South Carolina. He ran for governor in 1958 but lost the Democratic primary to Ernest F.\"Fritz\" Hollings. Four years later he was elected governor. He resigned as governor in 1965 upon the death of Sen. Olin D. Johnston and was appointed by the new governor, Robert E. McNair, to fill the vacancy created by Johnston's death. In the Democratic primary for the special election in 1966 to fill the remainder of Johnston's term, Russell again lost to Fritz Hollings. McNair, however, won a gubernatorial term of his own in 1966 by defeating the Republican Joseph O. Rogers, Jr., while Hollings won election to the rest of Johnston's Senate term by defeating Republican Marshall Parker. In 1966, after his short Senate tenure ended, Russell was appointed U.S. District Judge for the District of South Carolina by President Lyndon B. Johnson to fill the vacancy created by the death of Russell's former law partner, Charles Cecil Wyche. In 1971, President Richard Nixon appointed Russell to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, where he served until his death, on his 92nd birthday in 1998. His Spartanburg home was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2007."

  "text" : "Dukinfield Henry Scott FRS (28 November 1854 – 29 January 1934) was a British botanist. He was the fifth and youngest son of architect Sir George Gilbert Scott. Born in London, he was educated at Oxford University (awarded MA) and Wurzburg University (awarded PhD), studying under the famous botanist Julius von Sachs. From 1882 to 1885 he was Assistant to the Professor of Botany at University College, London, and from 1885 to 1892 Assistant Professor in Biology (Botany) at the Royal College of Science, South Kensington. In 1892, Scott left the Royal College of Science when he was appointed Honorary Keeper of the Jodrell Laboratory, Royal Gardens at Kew, a position he held for fourteen years. He published many papers on botany in scientific journals. He did important work in paleobotany as the younger colleague of William Crawford Williamson, one of the founders of paleobotany. He was president of the Linnean Society from 1908 to 1912. He was elected a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in 1916 and a Fellow of the Royal Society in June 1894. He was awarded the Royal Medal of the Royal Society in 1906, the Linnean Medal of the Linnean Society in 1921, the Darwin Medal of the Royal Society in 1926 and the Wollaston Medal of the Geological Society of London in 1928. He died in East Oakley House near Basingstoke, Hants. He had married Henderina Victoria Klaassen in 1887; they had seven children, one of whom died in infancy. One of his most brilliant students was Harold Wager, who became his student in botany in 1886 and went on to become F.R.S in 1904. The standard author abbreviation D.H.Scott is used to indicate this individual as the author when citing a botanical name."

  "text" : "Demna (Georgian: დემნა, a hypocorism for Demetrius, დემეტრე) (born before 1155 - died c. 1178) was a Georgian royal prince and pretender to the throne proclaimed as king during the failed nobles’ revolt of 1177/8. He was the only son and heir of King David V of Georgia who had deposed his father, Demetrius I, in a palace coup in 1155. Shortly after David’s death (1155), Demetrius declared his younger son, George (the future King George III), heir apparent violating thus a principal law of succession and depriving Demna of his rights to the throne. The medieval Georgian and Armenian chronicles are confused about the circumstances in which David died. According to the medieval Armenian historians, George was somehow implicated in his murder though Georgian sources say nothing about it. An Armenian chronicler, Vardan Araveltsi, says that David was murdered “by Sumbat and Ivane [Orbeli] in a plot of the Orbels... They had made an agreement with Giorgi, Davit’s brother, that he would appoint them generals”. Ivane Orbeli was indeed rewarded by George III with the title of amirspasalar on his coronation. Another Armenian Stepanos Orbelian, a descendent of the Orbeli clan, writing shortly after Vardan, denies any family involvement in the murder of the king and claims George had sworn to his reigning brother that he would rule only until Demna reached his majority, but then reneged on his vow. He claims that the Orbelis had been the witnesses of this vow and that they led the 1177 revolt to restore Demna, who was now adult, to his rightful position. Either way, Demna was considered by many as a lawful pretender to the Georgian crown and victim of injustice. Furthermore, he had married the daughter of Ivane Orbeli and the family’s interest in the revolt was clear. Demna was also sympathized by several high-ranking courtiers and military officers who had their fiefdoms mainly in southern Georgian and Georgian-dominated Armenian lands. The rebellion led by Ivane Orbeli broke out in 1177. The insurgents crowned Demna the king at the Agara Castle and marched, with 30,000 men, to the Georgian capital of Tbilisi. However, Orbeli’s plan of a surprise attack failed. George III relied mainly on crack troops provided by the Kipchak mercenaries and Caucasian mountaineers. By force and diplomacy, he induced many of rebelled nobles to surrender. Orbeli, however, refused to comply and retired to the Lorhe fortress (now Lori, Armenia). The royal army quickly overran the fiefdoms of rebel lords and put Lorhe under siege. Orbeli requested aid from the neighbouring Seljuk rulers but his forces completely exhausted before the reinforcements could arrive. Demna was the first to surrender. Throwing himself and his followers on the mercy of his uncle, he was blinded and castrated to ensure the primacy of George’s branch of the family, and the Orbelis were extirpated and their lands and wealth seized. Imprisoned, Demna did not survive the punishment and soon died. The Georgian female poet Tamar Eristavi proposed, in 1988, a romantic though unreliable and otherwise unproved hypothesis identifying the famous Georgian poet Shota Rustaveli with Prince Demna who was allegedly in love with his cousin, Princess Tamar; survived the repressions and wrote his poem The Knight in the Panther's Skin (dedicated to Tamar) in exile under the assumed identity of Rustaveli."

By February 2010, the charges were adjusted to four counts contributing to the delinquency of a minor and one count of indecent exposure. On April 15, 2010, Fushek agreed to a plea bargain offered by the Maricopa County Attorney's Office in which he pleaded guilty to one of the charges. The four other charges were dropped and he was fined $250, in addition to being sentenced to 364 days of probation. On December 15, 2008, the Diocese of Phoenix announced that Fushek had been excommunicated by Bishop Thomas J. Olmsted for establishing the Praise and Worship Center, a community outside the Catholic Church, in defiance of the bishop's order for him to cease ministry."

  "text" : "Zachariah Daniel Miller III (September 30, 1941 – April 8, 2009), commonly known as Dan Miller, was an American television personality who grew up in Augusta, Georgia. Miller was a longtime news anchorman for WSMV (formerly WSM-TV) in Nashville, Tennessee. Beginning his tenure there as a weathercaster in 1969, he moved to the news anchor desk in 1970. In 1986, Miller left Nashville to serve as principal anchor at KCBS-TV in Los Angeles, a position he held for one year. Miller then gained fame in the United States nationally as the announcer and sidekick for his friend and one-time WSM-TV colleague, Pat Sajak, during Sajak's short-lived CBS late-night talk show, The Pat Sajak Show. Upon returning to Nashville in 1992, Dan resurrected his own interview show, Miller & Company, which originally aired Sunday nights on WSMV from 1980 to 1986. The Miller & Company revival aired weekday afternoons to a national cable audience on The Nashville Network. When it was discontinued by TNN, it was picked up locally by WSMV. In 1995, WSMV replaced Miller & Company with a 5pm newscast. A few months later, Miller returned to the WSMV anchor desk and continued his work there until his death in 2009. Miller appeared in the CBS movie, Big Dreams and Broken Hearts: The Dottie West Story, which featured Michele Lee as Dottie West. He appeared as a guest on Hollywood Squares in 1989. In 1999, he was granted an exclusive interview with the parents of murdered six-year-old JonBenét Ramsey, which led to many appearances on nationally-televised news programs. Miller was also a prolific writer of essays about life on and off the television screen, at \"Dan Miller's Notebook\"."

He subsequently returned to the stage area, drew a revolver, and was stabbed and beaten to death by Hells Angel Alan Passaro. The incident was caught on camera and became a central scene in the documentary Gimme Shelter. Passaro was charged with murder. After an eight-man, four-woman jury deliberated for 12 and a half hours, following 17 days of testimony, Passaro was acquitted on grounds of self defense."

He lectures part-time at Witwatersrand University in electronic music composition. He composes for acoustic instruments, electronic sound sources, multimedia, including dance and theatre. He bases his technical and theoretical compositional approach in scientific research e.g. Study of traffic flow patterns, biochemical dynamics of energy formation, flow / resistance of fluids travelling through various transport systems, cognitive psycho-acoustic behavioural patterns in humans and the behaviour of sound in relationship to continued environmental changes.His sociocultural interests have led him to research the survival of music in the 21st century and the impact that media and technology have on the composer. These theories help to create moments of isolation allowing for the morphological study of each individual sound source, a strategic necessity that brings a degree of order and allows for the creation of various building blocks used in the construction of micro-environments that in turn form the backbone of his compositions."

Note that it is a diameter, not a radius, even though r is used as the variable.

A tall man at 6'4\", Nyhan's writing was often characterized as bringing a \"voice to the voiceless.\" He covered national politics and was a frequent source for commentary on presidential races and on the New Hampshire primary in particular. In his last column, he wrote: \"The thing I'll miss most is the chance to shine a little flashlight on a dark corner, where a wrong was done to a powerless peon, where a scarred politician maybe deserved a better fate, where the process went awry, or the mob needed to be calmed down and herded in another direction.\" He died suddenly on January 23, 2005, suffering a heart attack after shoveling snow. The Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy at Harvard University established the David Nyhan Prize for Political Journalism in his honor. The first recipient of the prize was David Willman in 2005."

  "text" : "Dmitri Konstantinovich Belyaev (Russian: Дмитрий Константинович Беляев, 17 July 1917 – 14 November 1985) was a Russian geneticist and academician who served as director of the Institute of Cytology and Genetics (IC&G) of the USSR Academy of Sciences, Novosibirsk, from 1959 to 1985. His decades-long effort to breed domesticated foxes was described by the New York Times' as \"arguably the most extraordinary breeding experiment ever conducted.\" A 2010 article in Scientific American stated that Belyaev \"may be the man most responsible for our understanding of the process by which wolves were domesticated into our canine companions.\" Beginning in the 1950s, in order to uncover the genetic basis of the distinctive behavioral and physiological attributes of domesticated animals, Belyaev and his team spent decades breeding the wild silver fox (Vulpes vulpes) and selecting for reproduction only those individuals in each generation that showed the least fear of humans. After several generations of controlled breeding, a majority of the silver foxes no longer showed any fear of humans and often wagged their tails and licked their human caretakers to show affection. They also began to display spotted coats, floppy ears, curled tails, as well as other physical attributes often found in domesticated animals, thus confirming Belyaev's hypothesis that both the behavioral and physical traits of domesticated animals could be traced to \"a collection of genes that conferred a propensity to tameness—a genotype that the foxes perhaps shared with any species that could be domesticated\". Belyaev, who especially during the early years of his experiment was risking his life by defying the anti-Darwinian, anti-Mendelian Soviet scientific establishment, has been recognized in recent years by major scientific journals as a pioneering figure in modern genetics."

  "text" : "Darren Spedale is an entrepreneur and author who is best known as the founder of the national entrepreneurship organization StartOut, as well as the founder of the company FamilyByDesign. Spedale has appeared on CNN, the Today Show, HLN Network, the New York Times, Wall Street Journal, and several other media outlets in relation to his entrepreneurial endeavors. Spedale's work in entrepreneurship began as the co-founder of a consumer internet start-up in 1998. Upon the sale of this company in 2000, Spedale received his MBA from the Stanford Graduate School of Business and his JD from Stanford Law School. In 2008, he co-founded the media company A-List Global Media LLC, the creators of PopCardz trading cards and other consumer products for the \"tween\" market. Based on his experiences in entrepreneurship, in 2009 Spedale conceived of and founded StartOut, a nonprofit organization dedicated to fostering and developing entrepreneurship in the gay and lesbian community. He became the organization's Founding Chairman of the Board and remained Chairman until 2012. StartOut currently has over 8,000 participants nationwide, and has local chapters in New York City, San Francisco, Los Angeles, and Austin. StartOut's First Annual Entrepreneurship Awards in 2012 honored entrepreneur and investor Peter Thiel, and the 2013 Awards honored entrepreneur and philanthropist Tim Gill. Spedale has been a spokesperson for StartOut in such publications as the New York Times and Inc. Magazine. In June 2010 Spedale rang the Opening Bell on the New York Stock Exchange on behalf of StartOut, and has appeared on such shows as CNBC's Squawk Box to discuss StartOut's work to help build entrepreneurship in the United States. More recently, Spedale founded the company FamilyByDesign, which is focused on the development of modern family structures. Spedale's research on modern families began in the mid-1990s while an undergraduate at Duke University, where he published an honors thesis on opposite-sex and same-sex domestic partnership laws in the United States. The arguments in his thesis were later used by Duke faculty and staff to help secure domestic partnership benefits for Duke employees. In 1996, having been awarded a Fulbright Fellowship after his undergraduate work, Spedale enrolled at the University of Copenhagen and spent two years in Denmark researching how northern Europe was recognizing non-traditional families. As a subset of this research, Spedale analyzed the Scandinavian registered partnership laws, which beginning in 1989 (in Denmark) allowed same-sex couples to enter into legal unions and thereby receive the rights and benefits of marriage. Spedale's Scandinavian research was widely published in Hawaii in the aftermath of Baehr v. Miike in which three same-sex couples argued that Hawaii's prohibition of same-sex marriage violated the state constitution. In June 2006, his first book, entitled Gay Marriage: For Better or For Worse? was published by Oxford University Press (with co-author Professor William Eskridge). He has since published articles on his research in such publications as the Wall Street Journal and Slate Magazine, and has appeared on such TV shows as the O'Reilly Factor to discuss his findings. More recently, Mr. Spedale's modern family research has focused on the emerging concept of \"parenting partnerships\" (sometimes called \"elective co-parenting\"). Parenting partnerships are formed when persons who are not romantically linked to one another decide that they want to build a relationship with each other around the purpose of raising a child together. Spedale was inspired by his own experience of finding himself single in his mid-30s but wishing to become a parent. Having decided that single parenting was not the right option for him, he began to explore the idea of finding a parenting partner. Based on his personal experience, Spedale launched the company Family By Design as a resource for those interested in finding a parenting partner of their own. The company's website assists those interested in finding a parenting partner to learn about elective co-parenting, find their parenting partner, and connect with professional experts in the modern family as well as people who are currently co-parenting. Spedale is also completing his second book (also titled \"Family By Design\", expected publication late 2013) which will be the first book dedicated to the subject of parenting partnerships, and is based on the stories/personal experiences shared with him by dozens of parenting partners as research for his book. In December 2013, Business Insider named Spedale one of the \"Most Important Gay People in Tech\"."

Upon graduation in 1878, he moved to Durham and set up practice there. He was also president of the Durham Furniture Company. He was elected to the Durham town council in 1883 and was elected reeve in 1884 and 1885. Jamieson was an unsuccessful candidate for the Grey South seat in the Canadian House of Commons in 1887, losing to Liberal George Landerkin. He was first elected to the provincial assembly in 1898. He was defeated by a United Farmers of Ontario candidate in 1919 but was reelected in 1923. Jamieson served as Minister Without Portfolio in 1926. He was defeated when he ran for reelection later that year. Soon afterwards, he was named chairman of the Mother's Allowance Commission. He was also named chairman of the commission created by the Old Age Pensions Act of 1929. Jamieson retired from these two appointments in 1935 and returned to the practice of medicine and his other business interests in Durham."

  "text" : "David Westheimer (April 11, 1917 in Houston, Texas – November 8, 2005) was an American novelist best known for writing the 1964 novel Von Ryan's Express which was adapted as a 1965 film starring Frank Sinatra and Trevor Howard. Ironically, one of his most popular novels, and perhaps his most enduring, was not credited to him for much of its shelf life: In its original printing, he was by-lined as the author of the novelization of Days of Wine and Roses based on the screenplay by his friend J.P. Miller. But the book proved hugely popular and the story had become so iconic that its publisher Bantam Books (and one supposes the authors, by mutual arrangement) took Westheimer's name off the book to move it into the \"literature\" category and keep it in print (which they did, for decades). Subsequent printings were branded only J.P. Miller's Days of Wine and Roses without an explicit by-line for the novel. Westheimer, a Rice University graduate, worked as an assistant editor for the Houston Post from 1939 to 1946 except for those years spent with the United States Army Air Forces during World War II. As a navigator in a B-24 he was shot down over Italy on December 11, 1942 and spent time as a prisoner of war in Stalag Luft III. His first novel, Summer on the Water, was published in 1948.

  "text" : "Denis Sargent Jenkinson (11 December 1920 – 29 November 1996), \"Jenks\" or \"DSJ\" as he was known in the pages of Motor Sport, was a journalist deeply involved in motorsports. As Continental Correspondent of the UK-based Motor Sport magazine, he covered Formula One and other races all over Europe. Jenkinson became a motor sport enthusiast in the mid-1930s: \"In 1936 I saw a racing car \"in the flesh\" or should I say \"in the metal,\" for the first time, that was an E.R.A. at the schoolboys' Exhibition. Later in the year, whilst staying at Brighton, I found that the Lewes Speed Trials were quite near, so off I went to find the venue. It was there that I first saw racing-cars in action, what a thrill!\" Jenkinson was studying engineering at the Regent Street Polytechnic when the Second World War broke out. As a conscientious objector, he served in a civilian capacity at the Royal Aircraft Establishment in Farnborough. This brought him into contact with Bill Boddy, editor of Motor Sport, and other enthusiasts. In 1943 Motor Sport reported: \"D.S. Jenkinson has constructed himself a very nice motor-bicycle of Norton parts, with taper forks, much of the work being accomplished by torch-light in a small shed.\" After the war Jenkinson started competing on two and four wheels, but he lacked the funds to race regularly. He found that acting as sidecar passenger to top riders enabled him to both enjoy top-level European competition himself while being paid and to scratch a living writing about it - he was passenger to Eric Oliver (with whom he became World Champion in 1949) and Marcel Masuy. Jenkinson abandoned front-line competition to become Continental Correspondent for Motor Sport. He spent his summers touring Europe and his winters in a succession of 'digs' in England; Jenks eventually settled near Crondall in Hampshire in a tiny run-down house with no mains electricity or water, largely full of his archives and of parts of vehicles he was 'fettling'. He was legendary in the sport for the lack of basic domestic amenities in his home; to Jenks nothing mattered but racing. He became accepted as the 'elder statesman' of British racing journalists due to his closeness to the teams and drivers, his conversational writing style and his obvious and enduring passion for the sport. DSJ loved to race and drive Porsche cars and coined the term wischening (pronounced as if in German) for the manner in which one may corner successfully in a Porsche 356. He later adopted an E-Type Jaguar as his work transport, although at home he had assorted decrepit vehicles including an elderly Mercedes-Benz saloon, a Citroën 2CV and others. His most famous competitive outing was as navigator for Stirling Moss during the 1955 Mille Miglia; his article With Moss In The Mille Miglia is generally acknowledged as a classic of motor racing journalism. His book The Racing Driver was based on his experience as navigator and is a true classic worthy of any motorsports literature collection. His \"pacenotes\" while on this event were pioneering, leading up to today's use of pacenotes in rallying. One of Jenks' most famous exploits was road-testing an unregistered, unsilenced and very much not road-legal Lotus Formula Two car on the roads near his Hampshire home on Christmas Day 1958, the logic being that the roads would be quiet and few police would be active. As well as his journalism, Jenkinson went on to write several other motorsports books about Porsche, Frazer Nash, the Jaguar E-type, the 2.5 litre Formula One, Juan Manuel Fangio, the Schlumpf Collection and a particular Maserati. A compilation of some of his best pieces, and biographical articles about him, was published soon after his death as Jenks: A Passion For Motor Sport. For many years in the 1950s he produced an annual Racing Car Review for Motor Sport, but stopped doing so as he became increasingly disgruntled with the discrepancies between the chassis numbers teams quoted and what was actually being raced; rather than compromise his journalistic integrity, Jenkinson simply stopped producing the books. Jenkinson also developed the classification of a driver's effort into \"tenths\". 10/10ths being the highest, attained by only a few drivers in history; the ability to 'Tiger' (to race at ten-tenths and achieve feats that other drivers would find impossible) was seen as crucial for a champion. In the sixties Jenkinson did much to promote the sport of drag racing in the pages of Motor Sport magazine. On 14 September 1963 he rode his NorBSA motorcycle, a BSA Gold Star 500cc engine in a modified and lowered Norton frame, at the Brighton Speed Trials. He drove an Allard Dragon dragster and also rode a 648 c.c. Triumph sprint motorcycle in the 1965 Drag Festival. He remained a motorcycle enthusiast, and competed in hillclimbs and sprints on his own Triumph-BSA hybrid well into his seventies. As DSJ he contributed regular columns and features for several decades to Motor Sport's sister magazine Motorcycle Sport run from the same offices at Standard House. In his later years, he became involved with Brooklands Museum and was involved in several adventurous operations, including exploring sealed up underground air raid shelters. Despite his advanced years, he worked as hard as any of the others involved and never asked for or received any special treatment. Jenkinson suffered a series of strokes in 1996 and moved to a home administered by the motor industry benevolent fund, BEN; he died on 29 November 1996."

  "text" : "Daniel Meyer (February 6, 1932 – May 16, 1998) was the founder and president Southwest Technical Products Corporation. He was born in New Braunfels, Texas and raised in San Marcos, Texas where he earned a bachelor's degree in mathematics and physics in 1957 from Southwest Texas State. After college he married Helen Wentz, moved to San Antonio and became a research engineer in the electrical engineering department of Southwest Research Institute. He soon started writing hobbyist articles. The first was in Electronics World (May 1960) and later he had a two part cover feature for Radio-Electronics (October, November 1962). The March 1963 issue of Popular Electronics featured his ultrasonic listening device on the cover. The projects would often require a printed circuit board or specialized components that were not available at the local electronics parts store. Readers could purchase them directly from Dan Meyer. Dan Meyer saw the business opportunity in providing circuit boards and parts for the Popular Electronics projects. In January 1964 he left Southwest Research Institute to start an electronics kit company. He continued to write articles and ran the mail order kit business from his home garage in San Antonio, Texas. By 1965 he was providing the kits for other authors such as Lou Garner. In 1967 he sold a kit for Don Lancaster's \"IC-67 Metal Locator\". In early 1967 Meyer moved his growing business from his home to a new building on a 3-acre (12,000 m2) site in San Antonio. The Daniel E. Meyer Company (DEMCO) became Southwest Technical Products Corporation (SWTPC) that fall. The concept of selling a kit based on a magazine article had been around since the early days of radio. Daniel Meyer perfected the process. In 1967, Popular Electronics had six articles by Dan Meyer and four by Don Lancaster. Seven of that year's cover stories featured kits sold by SWTPC. In the years 1966 to 1971, SWTPC's authors wrote 64 articles and had 25 cover stories in Popular Electronics. (Don Lancaster alone had 23 articles and 10 were cover stories.) The San Antonio Express-News did a feature story on Southwest Technical Products in November 1972. \"Meyer built his mail-order business from scratch to more than $1 million in sales in six years.\" The company was shipping 100 kits a day from 18,000 square feet (1,700 m2) of buildings. In the first ten years, SWTPC's most popular products were audio kits followed by test equipment. There was also typical 1970s products like color organs that would synchronize colored lights with music as well as strobe lights. Dan Meyer developed a series of very low intermodulation (IM) distortion audio power amplifiers known as Tigers, many still in use today. Don Lancaster developed a series of decimal readout counters and voltmeters that used the latest technology. In mid 1975 Dan Meyer asked one of his engineers, Gary Kay, to design a computer based on the Motorola 6800 design kit. The first deliveries were in November 1975. In June 1976 SWTPC introduced the AC-30 Cassette Interface for data storage and the PR-40 printer. One could now purchase a complete computer system for about $1500. Many of the early hobbyist computer companies were founded by engineers who did not know how to run a business. They would fold in a year or so. SWTPC had been successful in the kit business for over a decade so they could deliver working products.Floppy Disk systems, full feature terminals, and many peripherals were added in 1977. The bus structure was called the SS-50 and soon many other vendors were making add-in cards and complete systems. In 1979 SWTPC introduced a new line based on the Motorola 6809 processor. These systems were produced until the mid-1980s. By then, the IBM PC was dominating the personal computer world and SWTPC shifted to point of sale (POS) systems."

  "text" : "Deva Raya II (r. 1425–1446 CE) was an emperor of the Vijayanagara Empire. The greatest of the Sangama dynasty rulers, he was an able administrator, an ambitious warrior and a man of letters. To him goes the credit of authoring well-known works in the Kannada language (Sobagina Sone and Amaruka) and in the Sanskrit language (Mahanataka Sudhanidhi). Some of the most noted Kannada poets of the medieval period, such as Chamarasa and Kumara Vyasa gained his patronage. The Sanskrit poet Gunda Dimdima, and the noted Telugu language poet Srinatha whom the king honored with the title Kavisarvabhauma (\"Emperor among poets\") were in his court. It was an age of development in secular literature as well. The noted South Indian mathematician Parameshvara, from the Kerala school of astronomy and mathematics lived in his empire. According to the historian Sastri, Deva Raya II had the title Gajabetegara, which literally means \"Hunter of elephants\", an honorific that explained his addiction to hunting elephants or a metaphor referring to his victories against enemies who were \"as strong as elephants\". Despite some reversals, Deva Raya II extended and held territories up to the Krishna river. According to an account of visiting Persian chronicler Abdur Razzak, Deva Raya II's empire extended from Ceylon to Gulbarga, and Orissa to the Malabar. According to the historians Chopra, Ravindran and Subrahmaniyan, the king maintained a fleet of ships which helped him in his oversees connections. From the account of the contemporary European explorer Nicolo Conti, the king levied tribute on Ceylon, Quilon, Pegu, Pulicat and Tenasserim."

Numerous scholarships and awards allowed him to continue his studies abroad. In 1981, he won the Internationaler Mozartwettbewerb in Salzburg. His first formal engagement took him to Gelsenkirchen's Musiktheater im Revier, then to the Staatsoper Stuttgart and Zurich Opera. He was invited to perform at the Royal Opera House in London in 1985 and there made his debut as Almaviva in Rossini’s The Barber of Seville. He was counted amongst the leading lyric tenors of his day and performed at all the world’s major opera houses, including \n* La Scala in Milan \n* the Hamburg State Opera \n* the Vienna State Opera \n* the Bavarian State Opera in Munich \n* the Zurich Opera, Switzerland \n* the Liceu in Barcelona \n* the Metropolitan Opera in New York He also performed at numerous international festivals, especially at the Salzburg Festival, where he sang Belmonte in Mozart's Abduction from the Seraglio and Ferrando in Così fan tutte under Riccardo Muti. On video, he can be seen in Handel's Semele as Jupiter, singing a long, beautifully shaped \"Where'er you walk\"; in Donizetti's Linda di Chamounix with Edita Gruberová; and in La belle Hélène. Deon van der Walt died at 47 at his wine farm in South Africa. Apparently, he was shot twice in the chest by his own father, who then committed suicide."

  "text" : "Daniel Blumenthal (25 January 1860 in Thann, Haut-Rhin – 25 March 1930 in Paris) was the mayor of Colmar from 1905 to 1914 and an elected member of the Reichstag between 1903 and 1907. He worked as a lawyer first at the Landgericht Mülhausen and then at Alsace-Lorraine's Supreme Court at Colmar. A Russian national through birth to Russian parents, who had immigrated to France in 1858, he was naturalised as German in 1882. In 1895 he founded the democratic People's Party of Alsace-Lorraine and became its first president. In 1899 he became a member of the Colmar city parliament and was elected its deputy in the district parliament (Bezirkstag) of Upper Alsace (1900 to 1914). In the German general election, 1903 he gained the majority of the votes in the Alsace-Lorraine constituency No. 9 (comprising about the rural district Straßburg-Land, not including the city of Strasbourg proper). In the next elections, he ran in two constituencies simultaneously, in No. 9 again and in No. 3 (Colmar), however, in both cases he only came second by votes and also lost the run-offs. In 1905 Colmar's city parliament elected him mayor with 15 of 29 votes. On 22 October 1911 he ran for a seat in the second chamber in the Alsace-Lorraine state election but failed, but since William II wanted him to be a member of the state parliament, he appointed him non-elected member of the upper house. After the outbreak of the First World War Blumenthal emigrated to France, where he promoted the reannexation of Alsace-Lorraine to France. He was condemned to death eight times and had sentences totaling five hundred years prison imposed upon him by the Imperial German government following his escape from Alsace to inform the world of the plight of Alsace and German Lorraine under German rule. He wrote a publication entitled Alsace-Lorraine – a study of the relations of the two provinces to France and to Germany, and a presentation of the just claims of their people, which was published in 1917, by G.P. Putnam's Sons in 1917. Blumenthal presented this publication to the United States Congress as means to gain American support for the freeing of Alsace and Lorraine from German rule and its reannexation to France without a plesbiscite of the inhabitants."

  "text" : "David Brown (1740–1812) was convicted of sedition because of his criticism of the United States federal government and received the harshest sentence for anyone under the Sedition Act of 1798 for erecting the Dedham liberty pole. Brown was a veteran of the American Revolutionary War. At the time, Brown went throughout the towns arguing against the newly formed national United States government. In November 1798, Brown led a group in Dedham, Massachusetts, including Benjamin Fairbanks, in setting up a liberty pole with the words, \"No Stamp Act, No Sedition Act, No Alien Bills, No Land Tax, downfall to the Tyrants of America; peace and retirement to the President; Long Live the Vice President,\" referring to then-President John Adams and Vice President Thomas Jefferson. Brown was arrested in Andover, Massachusetts but because he could not afford the $4,000 bail, he was taken to Salem for trial. Brown was tried in June 1799. Brown wanted to plead guilty but Justice Samuel Chase wanted him to name everybody who had helped him or who subscribed to his writings. Brown refused, was fined $480, and sentenced to eighteen months in prison, the most severe sentence then imposed under the Alien and Sedition Acts. In December 1800, at the end of his term, Brown could not afford to pay the fine and President Adams refused to set him free. In February 1801, approaching two years, the longest sentence of anyone under the Sedition Act, Brown again appealed to Adams and was again denied. In 1801, newly elected President Thomas Jefferson pardoned Brown along with all violators of the act."

Scott was a nerdy freshman and best friends with David Silver, played by Brian Austin Green. As David became increasingly close with the show's core popular group the Scott/David friendship suffered. In the second season, Emerson was no longer a full-time character but only a special guest star. His character killed himself at his birthday party, when he twirled a gun around and accidentally shot himself as David looked on in horror. After his departure from the show, Emerson enrolled in junior college and in 1993 transferred to Pepperdine University. There he met his future wife, Emily Barth. The pair married after he dropped out to join the U.S. Air Force in 1996. As of 2002, he was a staff sergeant and was stationed at Holloman AFB in New Mexico. He earned a dozen awards for, among other accomplishments, planning missions during the 1999 Kosovo War. He left the Air Force in 2003, at which time he was living in Denver with his wife and their two daughters, Hayley and Hannah."

  "text" : "Dorothy Detzer (December 1, 1893 in Ft. Wayne, Indiana - January 7, 1981 in Monterey, California) was for twenty-two years the National Executive Secretary of the U.S. of the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom (1924–1946). As a high school graduate, Detzer decided to forgo the traditional college course, opting instead to travel in the Far East and live for a time in the Philippines. Returning to the U.S., she went to live at Hull House, attending the Chicago School of Civics and Philanthropy while working as an officer of the Juvenile Protective Association. At the end of World War I, she spent a year in Austria doing relief work for the American Friends Service Committee (AFSC). She later spent two years in Russia as an AFSC famine relief administrator in the Volga valley. Seeing the ravages of war and enduring the loss of her twin brother Don, who was gassed during World War I and died from a lingering illness, convinced Detzer that social work was not enough and that she wanted to work actively for pacifist causes. Upon her return to the U.S. in 1924, Detzer assumed the national secretaryship of WILPF, U.S. Section. Detzer lobbied for the initiation of numerous legislative investigations, notably one launched by Senator Gerald P. Nye on the munitions industry (1933–1936). She was instrumental in focusing attention on the exploitation of African countries, particularly Ethiopia and Liberia, by U.S. business concessions, and was awarded the Humane Order of African Redemption by the Liberian government in 1933 for these efforts. She also secured the appointment of a woman (Mary Woolley) to the U.S. delegation to the Geneva Disarmament Conference (1932), worked for recognition of Russia as a member of the family of nations and freedom for Cuba from U.S. intervention, and argued for neutrality as the U.S. approached World War II. The events of two decades in Washington are chronicled in her book Appointment on the Hill (1948) which was written the year after she resigned her post with WILPF. She married Ludwell Denny, a journalist, in 1954 and spent the next several years freelancing as a foreign correspondent. Shortly before her husband's death in 1970, the Dennys left Washington, D.C. for the West Coast, where Dorothy Detzer Denny remained in Monterey, California, until her death."

  "text" : "David Mindich (born 1963 in New York City) is a press critic, media historian, and professor at Saint Michael's College in Colchester, Vermont where he served as the chair of the journalism and mass communication department from 2000 to 2006. He was named Vermont Professor of the year in 2006 by the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching and the Council for the Advancement and Support of Education (CASE) He currently teaches Editing and Design for online media, and is the faculty adviser for St. Michael's online student publication, the Echo. In the mid-1980s, he worked as an assignment editor for CNN. In 1996, Mindich earned a doctorate in American Studies from New York University where he worked under Mitchell Stephens, Carl Prince, and Jay Rosen. The author of two widely reviewed books, Just the Facts and Tuned Out, Mindich has also written articles that have appeared in the Wall Street Journal, New York Magazine, the Wilson Quarterly, the Baltimore Sun and academic journals. Mindich is particularly interested in the history, construction and present health of journalism. In 2006 Mindich wrote a resolution for the AEJMC) that censured the Bush administration for its \"anti-press\" policies. The resolution passed at the association's national convention in San Francisco with little opposition. In Just the Facts, Mindich argued that journalist objectivity evolved in stages over a broad period, from the 1830s to the 1890s. Looking at five separate \"elements\" of objectivity—detachment, nonpartisanship, inverted pyramid writing, facticity, and balance—Mindich pinpointed specific historical moments when newswriting advanced toward its present form. One notable chapter is chapter three, which revealed that it was the government, and not journalists, who were using the inverted pyramid during the American Civil War. Another is chapter five, which is about the practice of lynching. Here Mindich argues that despite its claim of balance, the New York Times couldn't get the lynching story right because of the cultural (and racist) baggage its reporters and sources were bringing to the table. In Tuned Out, Mindich argues that America is facing a grave threat to its democracy because the public has increasingly \"tuned out\" from politics and civic discouse. Mindich suggests a number of solutions to rectify the problem, including changing expectations for college-bound high school seniors. Since the publication of Tuned Out, Mindich has given lectures at universities, high schools, media organizations and civics groups about media and democracy. Mindich founded Jhistory, an Internet group for journalism historians, in 1994. He is currently an editor of the list. Mindich lives in Burlington, Vt."

According to Reubeni's own story this kingdom had 300,000 \"Israelite\" subjects. The king of Portugal, impressed by the idea, had initially agreed to supply Reubeni with Portuguese arms, but after five months, Reubeni fell into ill-repute with the king of Portugal, who perhaps distrusted his motives, and was asked by the king to leave his kingdom."

  "text" : "Donald Howard Yarborough (December 15, 1925 - September 23, 2009), was a liberal Democratic politician who was reportedly the first Southern politician to endorse the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Yarborough, an attorney in Houston, Texas, ran for governor of Texas in 1962, 1964, and 1968. In 1962, he came close to winning the primary runoff election against John B. Connally, Jr., having polled 49 percent of the ballots. Other intraparty rivals, considered conservatives, included the state attorney general, Will Wilson, highway commissioner Marshall Formby, and General Edwin A. Walker, who made anticommunism the centerpiece of his race. The Republican gubernatorial nominee, Jack Cox, an oil equipment executive from Houston, was also a strong conservative and a former Democratic member of the Texas House of Representatives. Although Yarborough never became governor, his campaigns contributed strongly to the reform of the Texas Democratic Party, uniting, behind Yarborough's candidacy, traditional New Deal loyalists, organized labor, African Americans, Mexican Americans, and reform-seeking liberals, thereby enabling this coalition to capture local constituencies in the Texas House and Senate and build organizations later drawn upon by Mark White and Ann Richards. Yarborough was born in New Orleans on December 15, 1925. His father was the president of a bank in New Orleans that went bust in the Great Depression, so Don was sent temporarily to spend part of his boyhood living with an aunt in Mississippi, where he helped out picking cotton in the fields of his family’s farm with the laborers. His father eventually got a job with the government and moved the family to Washington, D.C. His family also spent time during the years after the Depression living with relatives in Coral Gables, Florida. The family eventually moved together to Houston when he was 12. His mother, Inez Black Yarborough, served as head of the Women in Yellow volunteer corps at the Jefferson Davis Hospital in Houston. Upon graduating from San Jacinto High School at 17, Yarborough enlisted in the U.S. Marine Corps, entered officer’s training school and became a Company Commander at the age of 19. He served one year in China at the close of World War II. After the war, Yarborough entered the University of Texas, where he belonged to Kappa Alpha fraternity, and worked part-time to supplement the money he received under the G.I. bill. He earned his law degree in 1950. Yarborough re-entered the Marine Corps to serve during the Korean War as a member of the Judge Advocate General’s Corp (JAG Corps). He then returned to Texas to found his own law firm and take part in civic affairs. In 1956, as president of the Houston Junior Chamber of Commerce, Yarborough won the national debating championship for the organization due to his passionate speaking skills. In 1960, Yarborough married his first wife, Katherine Edwards. In 1963, Yarborough was named by LIFE magazine as one of the 100 young Americans who were \"distinguished by their dedication to something larger than private success, because they had the courage to act against old problems, the boldness to try out new ideas, and a hard-bitten, undaunted hopefulness about man. In his first run for political office, Yarborough ran for Lieutenant Governor of Texas in 1960. In 1962, he ran for the first time for governor, and in a field of five Democratic candidates, he reached a run-off with John Connally and came within 28,000 votes of winning the nomination, a nationally-noted near-upset in a state long dominated by the conservative faction of the Democratic Party. He ran for governor again in 1964 and 1968. In political life he supported civil rights, economic justice, environmental protection, and women's equality, and he challenged the big business establishment that had long dominated Texas politics. After leaving politics, Yarborough promoted science as a means to ease suffering and cure aging, which he considered to be a disease that affected everyone. He worked as a lobbyist for Paraplegia Cure Research in Washington, D.C., where lived for many years on Capitol Hill and in Mclean, Va. He also played a role in the Council for a Livable World and was a founding member of biotech research companies. Yarborough died of Parkinson's disease on September 23, 2009. Yarborough was married three times, to Katherine Edwards Yarborough in 1960, to Gail Lind in 1978, and Houston realtor Charity O'Connell Yarborough in 1984."

During his tenure at CSU East Bay, Professor Eshelman strengthened the jazz program into one of national renown. In collegiate jazz festivals the CSUEB Jazz Ensemble has won first place honors in about seventy-five percent of the competitions it has entered for over the last ten years. In 2003 the university named him Outstanding Professor of the Year, and in 2006 the California Music Educator's Association named him top collegiate music educator in the state for 2007. He was presented with the CMEA/John Swain College/University Educator Award March 15, 2007 at the CMEA State Conference Gala Awards Banquet in Ontario, CA.

  "text" : "David Empringham (born December 28, 1963, Toronto, Ontario) is a Canadian auto racing driver. He is a two-time Toyota Atlantic, one-time Indy Lights and two-time Continental Tire Sports Car Challenge champion. Most recently, Empringham won the 2012 Grand-Am Continental Tire Sports Car Challenge GS class driver's title with co-driver John Farano. Empringham began his racing career in 1987, competing in the Spenard/David Formula 2000 series. He then competed regularly in the GM Motorsport series (teammate of Canadian racing legend Richard Spenard) for several years, drove a handful of races in the IMSA Firestone Firehawk series, the Porsche Turbo Cup and Formula Toyota Atlantic. In 1992, Empringham began competing full-time in the Toyota Atlantic Championship, where he won back-to-back championships in 1993 and 1994. In 1993 David won the Championship with \"underdog\" CANASKA racing and Canadian Tire sponsorship, based out of Toronto, Ontario. 1994 saw Empringham move to the BDJS racing team, based in Indianapolis, Indiana, taking the Canadian Tire sponsorship with him. 1995 saw Empringham narrowly miss the three-peat, being beat out by Richie Hearn for the title. 1996 saw Empringham make the move to Indy Lights, replacing Greg Moore, who had moved up to the team's CART operation, in the Player's/Forsythe racing Lola. 1996 saw many wins including a thrilling victory in the fastest Indy Lights race ever run on the high banks of Michigan International Speedway during the Inaugural US 500 weekend in May, and ultimately another Championship for \"Emp's\" mantle. 1997 saw some successes, but no championship. Despite his success in Atlantics and Indy Lights, amazingly enough Empringham never started a CART race. In 2001, after several years out of the spotlight, David began competing Part-time in Grand-Am Cup and Grand-Am Motorola series races. During the 2005 season, he managed 2 victories and 8 top-ten finishes on his way to the GS series title with co-driver Scott Maxwell driving for Multimatic Motorsports. Since then, Empringham has competed in a Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution in Time Attack events for the Sierra Sierra Enterprises (USA) team. Empringham is a two-time runner up at the World Time Attack Challenge in Sydney, Australia (2010, 2011), both times losing out to Tarzan Yamada, who drives for the Japanese Cyber Evo team in a similar Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution. In 2012 Empringham returned to full-time racing in the Continental Tire Sports Car Challenge with co-driver John Farano in the #83 BGB Motorsports Porsche Carrera. After a consistent season of points finished (however no wins), Empringham and John won the 2012 driver's title. In 2013, Dave returns to Multimatic Motorsports with Farano to compete in the CTSCC series in the #15 Aston Martin Vantage V8 Grand-Am race car."

With two friends, Joe Byrne and Steve Hart, the brothers formed the Kelly Gang. They robbed banks, took over whole towns, and kept the people in Victoria and New South Wales frightened. For two years the Victorian police searched for them, locked up their friends and families, but could not find them. Dan Kelly died during the infamous siege of Glenrowan. More books have been written about the Kelly Gang than any other subject in Australian history. The Kelly Gang were the subject of the world's first full-length feature film, The Story of the Kelly Gang, made in 1906."

  "text" : "David Burt (1953) is a British actor, known primarily for his many and wide-ranging West End performances. Burt recently starred as the flamboyant Count Fosco opposite Yvette Robinson in Andrew Lloyd Webber's The Woman in White at the Palace Theatre and was featured as Captain Andy Hawks in Show Boat at the Royal Albert Hall. Other London credits include Anatoly in Chess, Orin Scrivello DDS in Little Shop of Horrors, Captain Harkness in the world premiere musical adaptation of The Far Pavilions, Vic Christian in the Pet Shop Boys' musical Closer to Heaven, and Ernest Hemingway in the musical Beautiful and Damned. He also appeared in the Royal National Theatre production of Leonard Bernstein's musical Candide. He created the role of King John in Blondel, by Tim Rice and Stephen Oliver. David Burt can be heard on the 1985 original London cast recording of Les Misérables, as Enjolras, and the 1996 London cast recording of Jesus Christ Superstar. As of August 2007, Burt is playing the role of nefarious prison officer Jim Fenner in Bad Girls: The Musical at the Garrick Theatre in London's West End. In April 2008 he will play Antarctic explorer Robert Falcon Scott in a British tour of G. M. Calhoun's The Last South. He was the only member of the original Les Miserables cast not to appear at the 25th Anniversary concert claiming he would not be able to sing the part in the encore anymore. He is the son of Pip Hinton, better known for her role in Crackerjack alongside Eamonn Andrews and later Leslie Crowther. He graduated as a student of RADA and soon became a popular choice for Lloyd Webber when casting new musicals. As of October 2011, he is playing the part of 'Zangler' in the West End version of 'Crazy for You' at the Novello theatre, London. Notable hijinks included handing a hard hat to an orchestra member during the bows, after accidentally sending a chair into the pit during Act 2."

  "text" : "Declan Costello (1 August 1926 – 6 June 2011) was an Irish jurist and Fine Gael politician, who served as a Teachta Dála (TD) for twenty years, as Attorney General for four years and as a High Court judge for another twenty years before his retirement. Costello was born in Dublin, the son of John A. Costello who served as Taoiseach on two occasions. He was educated at University College Dublin (UCD), and was an auditor of the UCD Law Society. At the 1951 general election he was elected to Dáil Éireann as a Fine Gael Teachta Dála for the Dublin North-West constituency and was re-elected at every subsequent election until he stood down at the 1969 general election. He stood again in the Dublin South-West constituency at the 1973 general election, and was elected for a final time, to the 20th Dáil. During the 1960s Fine Gael was out of power and Costello was leader of a new generation of Fine Gael politicians who wanted to move the party to the left. He persuaded the party to publish a document called Towards a Just Society which supported economic planning and more government intervention in the economy. This document went on to define what Fine Gael stood for over the following twenty years. In 1973 Fine Gael was back in government and Costello was appointed Attorney General under Taoiseach Liam Cosgrave. He served in that position until 1977 when he finally left politics to become a High Court judge. In 1979 he presided over the Costello Inquiry into the Whiddy Island Disaster. He was appointed President of the High Court in 1994 and retired in 1997. Costello died in 2011."

  "text" : "David D. Busch is a photographer and well-known award-winning author of more than 200 books with a total of more than two million copies in print, and thousands of photography- and technology-related articles for Popular Photography, Rangefinder, Professional Photographer, Computer Shopper, and other magazines. He is best known for the classic imaging handbook Digital Photography All in One Desk Reference for Dummies, which, along with Mastering Digital Photography, was named by About.com as the top two of five recommended books for digital photography beginners. He is the main author and series editor of David Busch's Quick Snap Guides, David Busch's Pro Secrets, and David Busch's Guides to Digital SLR Photography. Busch began writing about photography, electronics and computers in the early 1970s, and for 20 years was a photojournalist who roamed the United States writing illustrated articles on imaging and technology. He was the author of the popular Kitchen Table International humor column in the early computer magazine 80 Microcomputing  (also known as 80 Micro) from 1981 to 1983. In 1984, his first book, Sorry About The Explosion, based on the KTI columns, was published and won a Computer Press Association Award the following year for Best Fiction Book. In 1986, his book Secrets of MacWrite, MacPaint, and MacDraw was voted Best Product Specific Book, and Busch was asked to co-host the Computer Press Awards held at the Plaza Hotel in 1987. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, he turned from programming and application books to imaging technology, writing some of the very first books devoted to scanners (The Complete Scanner Handbook, Dow-Jones Irwin, 1990) and digital Photography (Digital Photography, MIS Press, 1995.) While working full-time as an author, Busch continued to write articles and monthly columns for magazines such HomePC, Macworld, Internet World, NetGuide, Windows Magazine, Windows Sources, and many other publications. He also reviewed digital cameras and printers for CNet Network and Computer Shopper Magazine. Today he is best known for photography books such as David Busch's Digital Photography Bucket List: 100 Great Digital Photos You Must Take Before You Die, featuring the work of members of the Cleveland Photographic Society, Digital Photography for Dummies Quick Reference, Digital SLR Cameras and Photography for Dummies, seventy-five Digital Field Guides for leading Nikon and Sony digital SLR camera models, and sixteen guidebooks for Canon dSLRs. Many of Busch's books, such as Digital SLR Pro Secrets and Digital Infrared Pro Secrets highlight often-quirky do-it-yourself projects, including equipment testing devices, camera hacks and conversions, filters, lighting equipment, and other gadgets. Busch was born in Ravenna, Ohio, but lived in Rochester, N.Y. for four years. He has a B.A. in Public Relations - Journalism from Kent State University, and has worked as a newspaper and magazine journalist, PR consultant, sports photographer, sports information director, photojournalist, and studio photographer."

The reigns of Domnall and his successor, Niall Frossach of the Cenél nEógain, had been relatively peaceful, but Donnchad's rule saw a return to a more expansionist policy directed against Leinster, traditional target of the Uí Néill, and also, for the first time, the great southern kingdom of Munster. Donnchad continued his father's support for the Columban churches, led by Iona. In his many wars he used the churches, particularly the Columban monastery of Durrow, as a source of support. He also ruthlessly attacked and plundered churches that supported his rivals among the Uí Néill and also those of Leinster and Munster. Donnchad was remembered, not always fondly, as a warrior king. He firmly established Clann Cholmáin's dominance among the Uí Néill kindreds of the midlands. His descendants shared in the High Kingship until the time of Máel Sechnaill mac Domnaill, the last traditional High King of Ireland."

While a student in London in the 1920s, she became involved in the India League and carried out other anti-imperialist work. Here she met Dr S. A. Wickramasinghe, a radical Sri Lankan moving in Communist and radical circles while a post-graduate student in London. Dr Wickremasinghe offered to find her a job in Sri Lanka. She became the principal of a Buddhist girls' school in Matara, Sujatha Vidyalaya (1930–32), where her work on the curriculum included replacing British history with Sri Lankan and world history, and permitting the teachers to get qualified, moving the school away from its emphasis on 'training for wifehood'. During this period she learnt Sinhala. In 1933 she was offered the post of principal at the leading Buddhist girls' school, Visakha Vidyalaya, but the offer was withdrawn on the news that she was to marry Dr Wickremasinghe. After marrying Dr S.A Wickremasinghe, she took up another post as principal of a leading Colombo Buddhist girls school, Ananda Balika Vidyalaya, where her work included promotion of Sri Lankan arts, and teaching Asian poetry. She was removed in 1936 because it was feared she had made the school a centre for anti-British activity - she definitely was responsible for many young women from the Buddhist schools joining the Left. She and Dr Wickremasinghe had two children, Suren (an architect) and Suriya (Amnesty International IEC Chairperson, 1982–85)."

Having first achieved notability taking a five-wicket haul against Derbyshire at the age of 17, Thomas took his chance at a place in the England youth team, and continued to bowl well through to 1995, at which point he suffered a dip in form which lasted until he regained his form in 1998, finishing top of the wicket-taking stakes with 81 wickets at an average of 24. He bowled an innings of 7 for 16, a record for Glamorgan, and was offered a chance to play for England A against South Africa and Zimbabwe. He became the leading wicket taker in 2000 and recorded his first ten-wicket innings against Durham in 2002. In 2007, after fifteen years with Glamorgan, he joined Essex County Cricket Club. However, a shoulder injury sustained in February of that year prevented his playing even once for the first team, and in September he announced his retirement."

On April 6, 1999 Sharma split from the party and constituted his own parallel Communist Party of Nepal (Masal). Sharma's party called for boycott of elections and supported the armed struggle. Soon after the split Sharma's party merged with the Communist Party of Nepal. Sharma was inducted in the Maoist politburo. Sharma represented the Maoists during the 2003 peace-talks. After the end of the 2006 democracy movement in Nepal, Sharma was included in the group sent to Kathmandu to start peace negotiations with the new government. In early 2005 Sharma was, along with Baburam Bhattarai and Hisila Yami, demoted by the party supremo Prachanda. In July of that year Prachandra reinstated Sharma into the politburo."

Parkes immediately helped with the amalgamation of the Canadian Ladies Curling Association and Curl Canada into the Canadian Curling Association in 1990. During the remainder of his tenure, he oversaw the creation of the sport's Season of Champions: a series of national and international championships, which have provided, on average, 175 hours of television coverage annually, more than any other amateur sport in Canada. Parkes came under tremendous heat during the 2004-05 season, when he was criticized for how the CCA handled its television programming. The CCA had sold the rights to television broadcasts of the Tim Hortons Brier, Scott Tournament of Hearts and Ford World Curling Championship to the CBC. This was criticized by many in the curling community, as the CBC did not show some games on the main network, and had other disorganized scheduling problems. However, the CCA was able to work things out for the following season, by bringing back TSN's broadcast of round robin curling games. Parkes stepped down as CEO on May 11, 2007 seven months ahead of schedule. Greg Stremlaw was appointed as his successor and assumed duties on October 9, 2007."

  "text" : "Dwight Heald Perkins (March 26, 1867 – November 2, 1941) was an American architect and planner. Perkins was born in Memphis, Tennessee and moved to Chicago with his family at age 4. His mother was widowed a few years after his family completed their move. Perkins attended only 3 months of high school, having to find work to help support his family. He worked initially at the Chicago Stockyards and later at the architectural firms Wheelock & Clay and for a few months for Frederick Schock. He was accepted to study architecture at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1885. A family friend, Mrs. Charles Hitchcock, helped finance his education there. He studied at MIT for two years and was so skilled that he was invited to serve as an instructor for a third year. Also while in Boston, he met Lucy Fitch, who would become his wife on August 18, 1891. Perkins left Boston in late 1888. In January 1889 he interviewed at Burnham & Root in Chicago and was employed in early February of that year. He remained for 5 years, gradually assuming more and more responsibility. He left at the end of 1893 to form his own firm. It was during this period that Perkins was associated with a group called \"The Eighteen\" that included like-minded architects such as Lawrence Buck and Frank Lloyd Wright. On January 1, 1894, he opened the office after receiving his first major commission,with help from Daniel Burnham, the Stevens Point, Wisconsin Normal School. In 1894 he was commissioned to design a new building for the Steinway Piano company. This building, Steinway Hall, bore little resemblance to the work he would do later, often in the style which became known as \"Prairie School\" of architecture. Perkins was offered the commission for Charles Hitchcock Hall as a result of his connection with the donor for the building, Mrs. Charles Hitchcock, who had previously helped fund his college education. Perkins was appointed the Chief Architect for the Chicago Board of Education by Mayor Edward F. Dunne in 1905. He was responsible for the design of 40 public schools. Among these structures was Carl Schurz High School which was described by the American Institute of Architects as \"the best and most important\" of his designs, in addition to being his \"masterpiece\" and an \"important example of early twentieth century architecture, utilizing elements of both the Chicago and Prairie Schools of Architecture.\" His five-year service in this role ended when he was accused of incompetence, inefficiency, and insubordination and was dismissed following a trial in which only the insubordination charge was upheld. However, it is generally accepted that the true reason for his firing was that he refused to bow down to the demands of the corrupt members of the Board of Education who insisted that he give contracts to their cronies. Perkins had maintained a private practice with John L. Hamilton in addition to his service on the board. In 1911, with the addition of William K. Fellows, the firm of Perkins, Fellows, & Hamilton opened with offices in Chicago's loop. Perkins left the firm in c.1929 and joined what became Perkins, Chatten, and Hammond, which he left in 1933. Perkins died in Lordsburg, New Mexico, in 1941 of a cerebral hemorrhage while traveling to his winter home in Pasadena, California. Other works by Dwight Perkins firm include the Lincoln Park Zoo Lion House, the Alfred Nobel School, and many other residential homes."

  "text" : "Donald Evans was an American artist (1945–1977), who was known for creating hand-painted postage stamps (artistamps) of fictional countries. Evans died in a fire in the Netherlands in 1977. While Evans initially painted postage stamps as a child, he returned to making them in 1971, shortly after graduating from Cornell University and training as an architectural designer with Richard Meier and Associates in New York City. During a six-year period from 1971–1977, he painted faux stamps issued by forty-two countries he conjured in his imagination. To make his art, Evans usually traced each stamp design in pencil, then completed it with a No. 2 Grumbacher paintbrush, watercolor, and pen and ink. To simulate stamp perforations, Evans pounded out a series of periods on an old typewriter. Evans catalogued all of his creations in a book he called the Catalogue of the World, which resembled a stamp-collecting catalogue in layout and style. Evans traveled widely during the six-year period in which he painted professionally, often renting small flats or staying with friends. Given the tiny scale of his art, he could pack an entire gallery exhibition under his arm. He enjoyed considerable success while he was alive, and had solo gallery shows in Amsterdam, London, New York City, Paris and Washington, D.C. On April 29, 1977, Evans’s Amsterdam apartment building caught fire. He did not escape. But after his death his reputation continued to grow, particularly after the publication of Willy Eisenhart’s The World of Donald Evans in 1980 (followed by a second edition in 1994). Several prominent critics and authors have admired Evans’s work, including Bruce Chatwin, Adam Gopnik and Nick Bantock. Chatwin's admiration was effusive: \"By common consent, the art of the drop-out generation is a mess -- and the art of Donald Evans is the antithesis of mess. Nor is it niggling. Nor is it precious. Yet I can't think of another artist who expressed more succinctly and beautifully the best aspirations of those years: the flight from war and the machine; the asceticism; the nomadic restlessness; the yearning for sensual cloud-cuckoo-lands; the retreat from public into private obsessions, from the big and noisy to the small and still.\" Evans's stamps can be found in many museums and private collections."

He was supposed to fly with his wife, Anne Buechner, to Orlando, Florida, returning from a missionary trip to Quito, Ecuador. The shooting took place on a jetway. Alpizar ran away from the aircraft and, Homeland Security officials maintain, claimed to have a bomb in his bag and then made a sudden movement toward it."

  "text" : "David Tristram (born 1957, Quarry Bank, UK) is an English comic playwright. He has published twenty three plays, videos/two films and a comedy novel. Widely performed by amateur and professional groups, his plays have parodied such pop-culture genres as soap operas and detective stories. Educated at Dudley Grammar School and Birmingham University, where he studied English and music, Tristram was a commercial copywriter before turning to comedy. In 1985 he founded the Flying Ducks Theatre Company, which has now become a professional touring company. The enterprise has expanded into the Flying Ducks Group, which stages conferences and other events, provides audio-visual and Internet production services, and represents actors. Tristram's plays take a farcical view of sex, alcohol, drugs, crime, and theatre itself. Tristram claims he writes only comedy because he can't take himself too seriously. He usually tests his new work at a small theatre in Bridgnorth near his home in Highley before wider release. His plays have been performed in South Africa, New Zealand, Mexico and Europe among other locations."

  "text" : "Dranivia was an 18th-century Lauan chief and noble of the Vuanirewa dynasty. He was the third son of Uluilakeba I and last recorded member of the noble household, Naivi, to hold the title Roko Sau of the Lau Islands. He is referred to as an usurper and often oral history does not include hims as a Roko Sau. He is said to have snatched the chieftainship during the absence of his uncle Matawalu from Lakeba, and without the consent of the Vuanirewa. On hearing of his nephew's treachery, Matawalu returned from Bau and reasserted his authority, while Dranivia was touring the Southern Lau islands. Dranivia immediately returned to Lakeba which precipitated in kin slaying amongst the Vuanirewa. Dranivia was defeated and he fled with his supporters to Nayau and establishing the village of Liku. It is recorded that Dranivia's aspiration for power does not end here. Matawalu himself was slain on Lakeba by his other nephew Malani, son of Rasolo. On hearing this Dranivia again raised an army and attempted to seize Lakeba again. His attempt was thwarted however as Malani's relative, a son of Delailoa residing on Nayau, warned him of Dranivia's impending plans. This information enabled Malani to crush Dranivia's forces and removed him from any further rebellions. It was due to the subduing of Dranivia, head the elder noble house of Naivi, by the younger noble households of Matailakeba (Malani) and Vatuwaqa (Taliai Tupou) that has completely eliminated any members of Naivi, the right to contest for the title of Tui Nayau to this day."

In the late 1960s Landee began working on recording sessions at TTG Studios on La Brea Avenue in Hollywood. The studio was owned by engineer Ami Hadani. The upstairs studio featured a custom vacuum tube console. Landee recorded \"Sky Pilot\" in this room for Eric Burdon and The Animals and created the phase effect used in the song \"The Big Hurt.\" Landee then worked at Sunwest Studios as an engineer in 1968, where he later became manager before moving on to Warner Bros. Records' Amigo Studios under Lee Herschberg and it was at Amigo that he gained a large number of music industry contacts. API desks utilizing solid state microphone preamplifiers and mix systems were used at Amigo Studios. In 1983, he helped Eddie Van Halen build his home studio, 5150 Studios. He also worked with Eddie on some instrumental scores for The Seduction of Gina and The Wild Life. The console Landee used in the Eddie Van Halen private studio was a UA featuring 1108 solid state mic pre-amps designed by noted audio engineer Bill Putnam."

After his elder brother, William Smith, 3rd Viscount Hambleden, died in 1948, Smith became the Governing Director and chairman of W. H. Smith, retaining the post until 1972. The death duties on his brother's estate were so severe, however, that a public holding company had to be formed and shares were sold to W H Smith staff and the public. Under his leadership, in 1966, W H Smith originated a 9-digit code for uniquely referencing books, called Standard Book Numbering or SBN. It was adopted as international standard ISO 2108 in 1970, and was used until 1974, when it became the ISBN scheme. After 1972, the Smith family's control slipped away, and the last family member, Philip Smith, left the board in 1996. Smith was also Lord Lieutenant of Berkshire from 1959 to 1976.

  "text" : "Mormaer Donnchad II (1154–1204), anglicized as Duncan II or Dunecan II, succeeded his father Donnchad I as a child. As a child of the previous Mormaer, he was entitled to succeed his father through primogeniture, but not to lead his kin-group, Clann MacDuib. That probably fell to his cousin, Aed mac Gille Míchéil. Like previous Mormaers of Fife, Donnchad II was appointed Justiciar of Scotia (i.e. Scotland North of the Forth). Donnchad's minority also meant that Ferchar, Mormaer of Strathearn, took supreme place as head of the Gaelic nobility and guide for the boy-king Máel Coluim IV. The scholar Geoffrey Barrow suggests that it was during Donnchad's tenure that Beinn MacDuibh took its names, i.e. when Donnchad II acquired land in that area (Barrow, 1980, 86). Donnchad, like other Mormaers of Fife, kept in close association with the king. His name is recorded, among other places, in a charter granted to the priory on the Isle of May. Donnchad's person was required to be a hostage following the defeat of William the Lion and the Treaty of Falaise, although in fact he certainly sent someone else in his place. (Barrow, 2003, 106). On Christmas Day 1160, he married Ada (Ela/Hela/Adela) who is named in official documents as a close relative of King Máel Coluim IV, translated as a half sister by his father Henry of Scotland or niece from the Latin text. Máel Coluim IV's father Henry of Scotland is believed to have had children prior to his marriage. Donnchad II had three sons, Mael Coluim, Donnchad, and Dabíd (Malcolm, Duncan, and David), two notably named for the Scottish Kings. He had a fourth child, a daughter, whose name is unknown. The Earls of Fife are considered to have been important allies of the Scottish Kings from King Dabid I onward. In 1152, on the death of Scottish King Dabid I's son Henry of Scotland, Donnchad I had escorted Máel Coluim IV, introducing him as the royal heir. His son Máel Coluim succeeded him in 1204."

  "text" : "Donnchadh III or Duncan  was Earl of Fife (or Mormaer) from 1270/2 to 1288. He succeeded as only a child, the son of the previous Mormaer Colbán, who died young. During his minority, William Wishart, Bishop of St Andrews, became custos of the Mormaerdom. Perhaps owing to a power-struggle within the Mormaerdom, the Bishop confiscated some lands from the MacDuib chief, head of Fife's Gaelic society. Later, King Edward I of England ordered the Guardians of Scotland to restore these lands. Donnchadh himself was one of these guardians, responsible for supervising the government of Scotland in the absence of the King. He had in 1284 joined with other Scottish noblemen who acknowledged Margaret of Norway as the heir of Alexander III. Donnchadh married Johanna (or Joan), daughter of Gilbert de Clare, 7th Earl of Gloucester by his first wife Alice de Lusignan (div. 1271) and had at least two sons, Duncan and an anonymous MacDuibh (=MacDuff). The latter's first name is unknown, but the style implies he was head of Clann mac Duib. He also had a daughter, Isabella, who married John Comyn, Earl of Buchan. The Mormaer's last historical appearance is in a document (possibly after his death) dated August, 1289. He was murdered in his prime at Pittillock near Falkland, while on his way to Dunfermline, the seat of Scottish government at that time, by some of his kinsmen in September. The Chronicle of Lanercost called the mormaer \"cruel and greedy beyond the average\" (Barrow, Robert Bruce, p. 332, n. 33). We can only guess why the Lanercost chronicler was so negative. He was buried at Cupar Abbey."

  "text" : "Donnchadh IV, Earl of Fife [Duncan IV] (1289–1353) was sometime Guardian of Scotland, and ruled Fife until his death. He was the last of the native Scottish rulers of that province. He was born in late 1289, the same year as his father Donnchadh III's murder. He therefore came into the Mormaerdom as a baby. He was so young that the honour of crowning John Balliol – normally the hereditary right of the Mormaer of Fife – was delegated to a knight, namely Sir John de St. John. He also missed the crowning of Robert I, owing to his captivity in England. Robert was forced to call upon Donnchadh's sister, Isabella, to officiate in his absence. His initial support for Robert has been doubted, but in 1315, a year after the Battle of Bannockburn, he resigned his Mormaerdom to King Robert for a regrant. The agreement with Robert ensured that the Mormaerdom would not be held by the king, and that the arms of Fife should always be unique from the similar royal arms. If Donnchadh were to die childless, King Robert would grant it to someone, by default Alan of Menteith. This was because Donnchadh's wife was in the custody of the English, and there was obviously some pressure from the men of Fife to retain their own regional ruler. He was present at the negotiations which led to the Treaty of Edinburgh, and a signatory to the Declaration of Arbroath. The Earl of Fife fought with the Regent Moray at the Battle of Dupplin Moor where, he being made prisoner, changed sides and, with William Sinclair, Bishop of Dunkeld, a great adherent of Robert the Bruce, crowned Edward Balliol King of Scots at Scone on September 24, 1332. The following year, on July 19, 1333, he fought with the Scottish army at the Battle of Halidon Hill, when he was again captured. In 1306, Donnchadh married Mary de Monthermer, a granddaughter of Edward I of England. He died with no male heirs. He is important because he was the last male Gaelic ruler of Fife. When he died in 1353, he was succeeded in his mormaerdom by his daughter Isabella, who married four times: \n*  William Ramsay of Colluthie. He succeeded as Earl of Fife, de iure uxoris. William and Isabella had a daughter named Elizabeth Ramsey. Alternatively she may have been married to William Felton. \n*  Walter Stewart, son Robert II King of Scotland and Euphemia de Ross. He succeeded as Earl of Fife, de iure uxoris. \n*  Thomas Biset of Upsetlington, who succeeded as Earl of Fife, de iure uxoris. \n*  John Dunbar, possibly a son of Patrick V, Earl of March and his first wife Ermengarde. John Dunbar succeeded as Earl of Fife, de iure uxoris. Isabella signed the Earldom of Fife over to Robert Stewart, 1st Duke of Albany in 1371."

  "text" : "Mormaer Domhnall of Lennox ruled Lennox in the years 1333–1365. Domhnall's reign is noted for its tension with the monarchy. King David II irritated Domhnall by residing at Dumbarton on at least twelve occasions between 1341 and 1346. Domhnall was probably one of the happier Scottish magnates when King David and his agent, Malcolm Fleming, Sheriff of Dumbarton, were captured by the English at the Battle of Neville's Cross in 1346. Domhnall was also faced with the challenge of fending off the aggressive Stewart clan. Having no male heirs, Domhnall is credited with saving the Mormaerdom by marrying off his daughter Margaret to his kinsman Baltar mac Amlaimh, the man usually known today as Walter of Faslane. This act kept the Mormaerdom within the Lennox line, and preserved it in the medium term from Stewart takeover. Domhnall died in 1365."

  "text" : "Donnchadh of Lennox was the Mormaer of Lennox, 1385-1425. He was a son of Baltar mac Amlaimh and Margaret, daughter of Domhnall, Earl of Lennox. When Domhnall of Lennox died in 1365, Donnchadh's mother Margaret became ruler of Lennox. It had been Domhnall's intention that the marriage would eventually allow the succession of a son, i.e. Donnchadh, but it is probable that Baltar intended to rule in his turn. It is not known how relations deteriorated, but it seems that Donnchadh got impatient. In the summer of 1384, King Robert II issued two charters formally conferring the Mormaerdom on Baltar. However, a year later he and his wife Margaret resigned the Mormaerdom over to their eldest son Donnchadh, and hence Donnchadh became ruler. However, in 1388, Baltar and Margaret were handed custody of the Mormaerdom for the remainder of their lives, with Donnchadh retaining the title. Donnchadh was confined to a stronghold in Loch Lomond, Inchmurrin castle. Donnchadh was forced to form strong ties with the great Robert Stewart, who was the second son of King Robert II by his first wife Elizabeth Mure of Rowallan, and who ruled much of Scotland. In 1392, Donnchadh met Robert at Inchmurrin and agreed to marry his daughter Isabella to Robert's son, Muiredach if Robert could secure him the Mormaerdom. As Domhnall was heirless, the deal ensured that the Mormaerdom would pass to the Stewarts upon Donnchadh's death. It took much of the 1390s, but nevertheless Robert managed to secure his part of the bargain. Donnchadh hence became a part of the Albany Stewart nexus when the Earl of Albany acted as regent during King James's imprisonment in England. Albany refused to ransom King James and tried to prevent his return. After the king's return, they challenged the crown's authority. These Stewart ties led to Donnchadh's downfall. In 1425, he raised his men of Lennox in a revolt against King James I in support of Muiredach and his son Walter and was executed. He was the last male ruler of his line."

Excluding Gille Christ he is counted as sixth Mormaer or Earl of Mar. In 1284 he joined with other Scottish noblemen who acknowledged Margaret of Norway as the heir to King Alexander. Domhnall was later a strong supporter of the Bruce cause during the crisis of the late 13th century. He was at Norham in 1292, probably in the camp of Robert de Brus, then Earl of Carrick. He married to Helen (sometimes called Ellen), possibly the natural daughter of Llywelyn the Great of Wales, who herself had previously been married to Mormaer Maol Choluim II, Earl of Fife. By Helen, he had three sons, including his successor Gartnait, and two daughters. His daughter Isabella of Mar was the first wife of Robert I of Scotland and mother of Marjorie Bruce who married Walter, 6th High Steward, the parents of Robert II and the Royal Stewart Kings of Scotland. The last record of a living Domhnall comes from 1297, and the earliest record of his son Gartnait as Mormaer is from 1305, creating the range of Domhnall's possible year of death to somewhere in between these two points. However, a document dating to 1302, containing terms of reconciliation between Edward I and Robert, stipulates that Robert should act as warden of Gartnait, implying that Domhnall had just died."

Based on this, Dale Martin speculates that whichever one of the Acts of Paul and Thecla and the Pastoral Epistles (including Second Timothy) was written later may have been arguing against the other."

  "text" : "Dawn Shadforth is a British music video and documentary director, as well as an editor and artist. Shadforth is one of the foremost directors in her field and has directed and edited promotional music videos for artists such as Bjork, Primal Scream, The Streets, All Seeing I, Peaches, Hurts, Florence and the Machine and Kylie Minogue. She has received several awards including Best New Director at The Creative Design Awards, Best Special Effects for Garbage’s \"Special\" at the MTV Video Music Awards, Visionary Video at the VH1 Awards and the Icon Award at the UK Music Video Awards. Her work is well known for its tightly choreographed performances and for liberating the movement of dancers rather than containing it. Shadforth at an early age was interested in art and music. she enrolled herself at Sheffield Hallam University and studied sculpture. She won the Whitworth Young Contemporaries Award for her work entitled \"Sweet Dreams\". In 1995 Shadforth directed The Friends Tale, a 10-minute documentary for Channel 4's controversial \"Battered Britain\" series. She then followed the documentary up with The Seven Year Glitch, a short film documenting the \"Warp Records Tour\". The documentary was screened at the film festival \"Onedotzero\", as well at \"Solar\" in Barcelona, Spain. In 1996 she was asked by a Mantronix band member to direct the music video for their underground hit \"Hush\" in New York City. In 1997 Shadforth moved to London, England, to work full-time as a music video director. In London her work quickly received public and industry recognition. Her music video for the All Seeing I single \"Beat Goes On\" won for Best Dance Video at the 1998 Muzik Video Awards and for Best Editing at the 1999 Creative Design Awards. In June 1998 she signed to Black Dog/RSA Films, a music video production company based in England. In 2001 Shadforth made her directing breakthrough with the Kylie Minogue video, \"Can't Get You Out Of My Head\". The video features Minogue in a computer generated futuristic city, arriving in a space-age car, seductively and rhythmically shifting the gearstick as she drives, before eventually dancing in a clipped pulsating style in front of a group of male dancers all wearing bizarre red plastic headgear. The video is well known for its tight choreography as well as for featuring Minogue in a deceptively revealing white costume with a plunging neckline and wide open front. The video was quickly picked up by many music video channels and is credited with making the song a number one hit worldwide. The exposure from the video quickly made Shadforth a \"must have\" director, and the film has been widely mimicked and parodied. She also directed the award-winning promo film for \"The Importance of Being Idle\", the acclaimed second single from 2005's comeback album by Oasis, Don't Believe the Truth. The film was a clever pastiche of 1960s black and white kitchen sink drama films, featuring a parade of high-kicking undertakers, led by the Welsh actor Rhys Ifans. (The name of the undertaking firm featured in the video is 'Shadforth and Sons'). The band themselves praised the video, and it was said by critics at the time to be the best video Oasis had ever made. It went on to win the award for Best Video of 2005 at the NME Awards in early 2006, and the song itself went to Number 1."

  "text" : "Dan West (1893–1971) was the founder of Heifer International, a charitable organization dedicated to relieving hunger and poverty. A native of Ohio, born in 1893, West was a member of the Church of the Brethren and graduated from Manchester University (Indiana) in 1917. As a church man from Indiana, West spent two years as a conscientious objector during World War I. After working for the Emergency Peace Campaign in 1936, he traveled to Spain to serve as the director of a relief program in the Spanish Civil War. He grew weary of handing out rationed supplies and thought there had to be a better way of eliminating hunger. He gave the idea to his neighbors and many congregations in northern Indiana of donating young heifers to families in need. The involvement from his community led him to bigger dreams. His idea became an official program of the Church of the Brethren in 1942 and eventually became an independent nonprofit corporation in 1953. His phrase \"not a cup of milk, but a cow\" became the mantra for Heifer International, which continues on today. Upon returning to the United States, West pushed for two more programs to be created. Alongside Alma Long, he was a key person in helping to develop the Brethren Volunteer Service (BVS) in 1948. The BVS acted as an alternative to military service for war objectors beginning in World War II. At Manchester University, West spoke to the president of the University and, together, they convinced Gladdys Muir to launch the nation’s first undergraduate program in peace studies at Manchester University. “With deep-rooted Christian values and a conviction for active peacemaking, he led by example, and motivated others to believe that ordinary people could do extraordinary things.” Biography written by Glee Yoder: Passing on the Gift : The Story of Dan West (Paperback) The Brethren Press, 1978 (reprinted 1995) ISBN 0-87178-689-3"

  "text" : "Don Schaly (October 10, 1937 – March 9, 2005) was an American baseball coach. He was the baseball coach at Marietta College in Ohio for 40 years, from 1964 to 2003. Schaly, a native of Ellwood City, Pennsylvania, retired following the 2003 season after 40 years at the helm of the Marietta baseball program. On March 9, 2005, he died after a short battle with cancer while attending the Pioneers' Spring Trip in Venice, Florida. The 1959 graduate of Marietta College played baseball and football for the Pioneers. He returned to his alma mater in 1964 and never left, guiding his teams to three NCAA Division III National Championships and seven National Runner-up finishes. He won 18 Mideast Regional Championships and 27 Ohio Athletic Conference Championships. The coach won numerous coaching awards during his career. He was inducted into the American Baseball Coaches Association (ABCA) Hall of Fame in 1995. Schaly was named the National Coach of the Year four times (1975, 1981, 1983 and 1986) and in 2000 Collegiate Baseball named him the Division III Coach of the Century. Schaly was also awarded the OAC's Coach of the Year 17 times and the Mideast Regional Coach of the year 21 times. Schaly's final record at Marietta is 1,442–329, but Schaly’s role in the Marietta College Athletics Department extended far beyond the duties of head baseball coach. He was an assistant football coach for 17 years and served as an assistant athletics director for more than 20 years. Schaly also played a primary role in the formation of the Marietta College Athletic Hall of Fame, which he was inducted into in 2004. Schaly was honored on November 8, 2003, at a banquet to celebrate his accomplishments at Marietta. He became the first person in Marietta College history to have his jersey retired. The college also renamed the main entrance of Ban Johnson Arena the Schaly Lobby in his honor. In 2006, Pioneer Park was renamed Don Schaly Stadium in his honor."

Prior to joining the Rocketplane team, Urie served as president of Concept Fusion, Inc., providing technical development services to established companies and start-up organizations. During his 30-year career with the Lockheed Martin Corporation, Urie led teams on Lockheed’s X-30 National Aerospace Plane and the HL-20 Personnel Launch System. He was Chief Engineer and then Program Manager of the SR-71 Blackbird reconnaissance system before initiating and heading the Single Stage to Orbit (SSTO) and X-33 Reusable Launch Vehicle (RLV) Programs at Lockheed. Urie's work as the program manager for the previously classified Have Region project demonstrated that rocket-powered single-stage-to-orbit vehicles were technically feasible, which led to the Lockheed Martin SSTO design approach. As a Director of the Lockheed-Martin Skunk Works SSTO/RLV Advanced Technology Demonstration Program, Urie conceived and developed the aerospike rocket propelled lifting body that was selected by NASA as winner of the X-33 competition. He holds the patent on the design(U.S. Patent D362,234), and he formed and headed a multi-company team encompassing all aspects of SSTO/RLV. Urie was also Program Manager of the Trans Atmospheric Vehicle (TAV) at Lockheed. His team built and successfully tested a large-scale cross section Mach 25 structure. He served on several advanced development projects in Flight Sciences and Operations Analysis. Throughout his distinguished career, Urie has received numerous honors and awards, including the prestigious Engineer of the Year award from the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics. He has published many articles, prepared and taught several short courses, given various lectures and presentations, and served as aerospace engineering curricula advisor to two universities."

He ran unsuccessfully for the United States Senate in 1914. He was born John Lorenzo Hubbell, but gradually came to be addressed as \"Don\", a Spanish term of respect. (NPS) He was born in Parajito, San Miguel County, New Mexico. He died in Ganado, Arizona. He spent his early years as a Spanish interpreter for the U.S. Army. He started a trading post in 1878 that became very successful financially. He eventually created an empire of 30 such trading posts in Arizona, New Mexico, and California. He helped many Navajos become economically self-sufficient by showing them the patterns of blankets most likely to sell for a profit. He was well respected in the Navajo community for his fair dealings with them. His 1878 trading post, now known as the Hubbell Trading Post National Historic Site, still stands on the Navajo reservation, and is a National Historic Landmark. Another trading post, purchased by Hubbell in Winslow, Arizona in 1921, is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. He is said to be the only Caucasian buried on Navajo land."

  "text" : "Denise O'Donnell is the Director of Justice Assistance at the US Department of Justice in the Obama Administration. She is also an attorney and Democratic politician from Buffalo, New York. She most recently served as New York State Commissioner of Criminal Justice Services and Assistant Secretary to the Governor for Criminal Justice in the Cabinet of Gov. David Paterson. She previously held the roles in the Cabinet of former Gov. Eliot Spitzer. She was a candidate in the 2006 Democratic primary for New York State Attorney General. O'Donnell attended high school at Mt. St. Joseph Academy, and then studied at Canisius College—both schools are located in Buffalo. Hers was the first graduating class from Canisius to include women. After graduating from college she worked for the New York City Department of Social Services. While doing so, she earned a master's degree in Social Work. After the birth of her two children, O'Donnell earned a Doctorate of Jurisprudence at the University at Buffalo Law School, graduating second in her class. In 1985, she became an Assistant United States Attorney. In 1998, President Bill Clinton appointed her the US Attorney for the Western District of New York. While working for the US Attorney's office she worked on two particularly prominent cases. The first was the investigation into Oklahoma City bomber and Pendleton, NY native Timothy McVeigh. She was also the leader in the successful prosecution of anti-abortion extremist James Kopp for the murder of obstratician and abortion provider Barnett Slepian. She was pushed out of her position as US attorney by the Bush administration before her term had ended. Many speculate that this was because the Bush administration was displeased with her efforts in prosecuting Kopp. Since 2001, she has practiced with the firm Hodgson Russ LLP, has lectured and campaigned for the Attorney General's office. In late 2005, former United States Attorney General Janet Reno announced her support for O'Donnell's campaign. She dropped out of the race for AG shortly after the Democratic convention where she received approximately ten-percent of the delegates' votes. In the announcement ending her candidacy she neglected to endorse any specific candidate for the Democratic nomination but, instead, emphasised her desire to see Eliot Spitzer elected governor. Spitzer announced her appointment as Criminal Justice Commissioner in January 2007. The New York State Senate unanimously confirmed O'Donnell to the post March 21, 2007. As Criminal Justice Commissioner, O'Donnell oversaw the planning and analysis of criminal justice policies and services for state government. She was appointed Assistant Secretary to the Governor for Criminal Justice on July 25, 2007 by Spitzer in the wake of a report by State Attorney General Andrew Cuomo regarding the use of the State Police by Spitzer's staff to monitor the activities of Senate Majority Leader Joseph Bruno. As Assistant Secretary, she served as the Governor's top criminal justice advisor and oversaw the State Police, Division of Parole and the Department of Corrections. She also assisted in the development of statewide criminal justice and public safety policies and worked on homeland security efforts for the state. Governor Paterson retained O'Donnell in his cabinet following his taking office on March 17, 2008. O'Donnell resigned from the Paterson administration on February 25, 2010, following reports of alleged misconduct by Paterson and members of his administration. Paterson and the State Police were accused of improperly contacting the alleged victim of domestic abuse committed by David W. Johnson, a top aide to the governor. In her resignation, O'Donnell called \"[such] actions unacceptable regardless of their intent,\" and said that the conduct was \"particularly distressing\" in an administration \"that prides itself on its record of combating domestic violence.\" She is married to John O'Donnell, a New York State Supreme Court Justice. Her son, Jack, is active in Democratic campaigns- having managed Denise O'Donnell's run and having advised that of Senator Chuck Schumer in 1998. As of 2007 he ran a consulting firm known as O'Donnell and Associates and is currently the Vice President and Communications Director at Bolton St. Johns."

He later served on the St. Louis board of election commissioners. In 2006, after several years out of elective office, Gambaro was an unsuccessful candidate for the 4th District Missouri State Senate seat being vacated by Pat Dougherty. The Democratic primary election was heavily contested, and no Republicans or third party candidates sought the seat. Gambaro finished third in the race, behind political science instructor Jeff Smith and State Representative Yaphett El-Amin, but ahead of State Representative Amber Boykins, and former St. Louis Alderman Kenny Jones . Governor Blunt appointed Gambaro to the Missouri State Board of Education in June 2007."

  "text" : "Edward David (\"Dave\") Moulton (born circa 1936, Surrey, England. Father: Edward Moulton) is a retired custom bicycle frame builder. Dave Moulton studied at Luton Technical College in England and learned bicycle frame building from Albert \"Pop\" Hodges in Luton, beginning in 1957. He opened a frame-building business around 1975 in Worcester, England. In 1976, Paul Carbutt rode one of Moulton's bicycles in the Olympics in Montreal, Canada. The bike frames were marked with Moulton's name, \"Dave Moulton\" in large lower-case letters. Moulton began receiving orders from the United States due to the increasing popularity of cycling as a sport and the scarcity of master frame-builders there. Moulton emigrated to the United States in 1979 and went to work for Vic and Mike Fraysse in Ridgefield Park, New Jersey. He built bicycles for them under the Paris Sport brand that were used by the US Olympic Cycling Team. In 1980 he went to work for Masi Bicycles in California until 1981. Shortly thereafter he rented space from Masi to start his own frame-building business. By 1983 he was doing well enough to move his business to a stand-alone location in San Marcos, California. That year he went into partnership with Olympic cyclist John Howard and manufactured bicycle frames under the John Howard name until 1984. In 1984 he began making frames under the Fuso label (Fuso is the Italian word for Molten), and, between 1985 and 1987, a small number under the Recherché label. The bicycles sold from US$1,500 to $3,000 in the late 1980s. Moulton retired from frame building in 1993. However, many of his bicycles are still in use. Moulton's bicycles have been ridden in more than 20 world championships, in major races including the Tour de France, and in Olympic events. The business was taken over by his former apprentice, Russ Denny, who manufactured his own frames under the Fuso name until 1997. Denny now markets frames under his own name. Moulton now lives in Charleston, South Carolina with his second wife Kathy and has become a writer and songwriter. He published his first book in 2003, Prodigal Child. (ISBN 0-9726693-4-5)"

  "text" : "David Carpenter (born 1947) is an English historian and writer, and Professor of Medieval History at King's College London where he has been working since 1988. He is the son of Rev. E.F. Carpenter, renowned ecclesiastical historian and Dean of Westminster Abbey between 1974–1986, and Lillian Carpenter. David Carpenter attended Westminster School along with David Piachaud, Professor of Social Policy at the LSE and Christ Church, Oxford where he gained a first class degree and went on to do his doctorate. He has written widely on English social, economic, architectural, military and political history in the thirteenth century; many of his essays on this subject being brought together in a volume of his collected papers The Reign of Henry III (Hambledon, 1996). He is a particular exponent of the ‘thickened political narrative’, which he deployed in The Minority of King Henry III (Methuen, 1990), which traced the complex political history of the years 1216-1227 out of which a new monarchy, limited by the Magna Carta, emerged. His most recent book, The Struggle for Mastery in Britain 1066-1284 (Penguin, 2004), weaves together the histories of England, Scotland and Wales in a strikingly new way, arguing that the rulers of all three, in their different fashions, were competing for mastery in Britain. Since 2005, he has directed a major AHRC-funded project on the Fine Rolls of Henry III. And, he is a Co-Investigator of the AHRC-funded project 'The Paradox of Medieval Scotland, 1093-1286'. Carpenter is a proponent of the theory that feudalism was fundamentally important to everyday English society and politics after 1166. He has provided a new description on how the Tower of London and Westminster Abbey fit into the History of England. Carpenter lives in London with his wife Jane and two children, Katie and James Carpenter. Carpenter is a supporter of Arsenal Football Club. He is the uncle of the cricketer  Ed Carpenter."

  "text" : "David the Scot (died c. 1138) was a Welsh or Irish cleric who was Bishop of Bangor from 1120 to 1138. There is some doubt as to David's nationality, as he is variously described as Welsh or Irish. Many Irish men living outside Ireland at this time had the designation Scottus, which originally denoted an Irishman, not a Scottish person. He was master of the cathedral school of Würzburg before 1110 - resting place of Irish missionary  St. Kilian and St. Kilian's Abbey, Würzburg - and in that year accompanied the Emperor Henry V to Italy. He wrote an account of this expedition. He was elected Bishop of Bangor, at the instigation of Gruffudd ap Cynan, king of Gwynedd, in 1120. The previous bishop, Hervé, had been expelled from his see by the Welsh, and deadlock between Gruffudd and the king of England concerning the choice of a new bishop had resulted in the see being vacant for around twenty years. Gruffudd threatened to get the new Bishop consecrated in Ireland, but eventually King Henry I of England agreed to the appointment of David to the see on condition that he accepted the supremacy of Canterbury. David was consecrated by Ralph, Archbishop of Canterbury on 4 April 1120 at Westminster. David was responsible for the rebuilding of Bangor Cathedral, the earliest surviving parts of which date to his episcopate. In this he was aided by a large grant of money from Gruffudd ap Cynan. David is last recorded in attendance at the deathbed of Gruffudd ap Cynan in 1137. It is thought that he may have returned to Würzburg as a monk shortly before his death."

  "text" : "Dennis Patkin Altman (born 16 August 1943) is an Australian academic and pioneering gay rights activist. Altman was born in Sydney, New South Wales to Jewish immigrant parents, and spent most of his childhood in Hobart, Tasmania. In 1964 he won a Fulbright scholarship to Cornell University, where he began working with leading American gay activists. Returning to Australia in 1969, he taught politics at the University of Sydney, and in 1971 he published his first book, Homosexual: Oppression and Liberation—considered an important intellectual contribution to the ideas that shaped gay liberation movements in the English-speaking world. Among his prophetic constructions were \"the polymorphous whole\" and his posing of the notion of \"the end of the homosexual\", in which the potential for both heterosexual and homosexual behaviour becomes a widespread cultural and psychological phenomenon. In 2005 he published Gore Vidal's America, a study of US author Gore Vidal's writings on history, politics, sex, and religion. In 1985 Altman moved to La Trobe University, where he later became professor of politics. He was appointed the Visiting Chair of Australian Studies at Harvard University from January 2005. Since 2009 Altman has been the director of the Institute for Human Security at La Trobe University. Altman has delivered speeches on the topic of sexual liberation. One of his most known speeches, Human beings can be much more than they have allowed themselves to be, was delivered at the first Gay Liberation Group meeting at the University of Sydney on 19 January 1972. In his preface to The City and the Pillar, Gore Vidal writes that Altman brought the book back with him but it was seized at Sydney Airport and subsequently declared obscene by a judge who also observed that the Australian obscenity law was \"absurd\", thus leading to its repeal some time later. Altman is also an active member of organisations that are dedicated to creating a better life for homosexuals, serving on the Australian National Council on AIDS and other international organisations including the AIDS Society of Asia and the Pacific, of which (as of the 2005 Kobe ICAAP Congress) he is president. Although strongly identified with gay rights, Altman also contributes to more widely based organisations. In October 2006 he was elected to the board of Oxfam Australia. In 2010 he stepped down from this position. In 1997 Altman wrote an essay, \"Global gaze/global gays\", in which he proposes that there are cultural connections between homosexuals in different countries, and that there is a nascent global gay culture. Altman is a longtime patron of the Australian Lesbian and Gay Archives. In March 2013 Altman wrote about the death of his partner of 22 years, Anthony Smith, who died from lung cancer in November 2012."

He was born near Smithburg in Washington County, Maryland, and graduated from the Sheffield Scientific School (Yale) with a Ph.B. in 1872. He occupied positions at Johns Hopkins, Western Maryland College, Western University of Pennsylvania (now University of Pittsburgh), and NYU, where he was dean after 1902. He was the author of Essentials of Physics for College Students (1912). Hering is credited with taking the first human x-ray in the United States on February 5, 1896 at Bellevue Hospital. Hering also was one of the original citations for Martin Gardner in his work Fads and Fallacies in the Name of Science in which it is argued he founded the modern scientific skepticism movement. Hering's work Foibles and Fallacies of Science is considered one of the key original texts on matters concerning pseudoscience."

  "text" : "David P. Weikart (August 26, 1931 – December 9, 2003) was an American psychologist and founder of the HighScope Curriculum, an early childhood education program. Weikart was born on August 26, 1931, in Youngstown, Ohio. His parents were Hubert and Catherine Weikart. One of four children, he had an older sister and two younger brothers. Weikart's parents were social workers and teachers with a deep commitment to helping others – a commitment their son embraced as his own. He attended public school in Youngstown, graduating from South High School in 1949. He enrolled in Oberlin College, Oberlin, Ohio, in the fall of 1949 and graduated in 1953 with a major in psychology and a minor in zoology. Throughout the college years, he worked at a YMCA camp in Rochester, New York, as a counselor and program director. In the fall of 1953 Weikart enlisted in the United States Marine Officer Training Corps and graduated as a lieutenant. He was honorably discharged in December 1955 after serving as a platoon commander in Korea and Japan. During the spring of 1956, Weikart taught English and biology at Canfield High School in Canfield, Ohio, and also attended Youngstown University, taking courses in education. In the fall of 1956 he enrolled in a University of Michigan joint PhD program in Education and Psychology sponsored by the School of Education and Department of Psychology. At the University of Michigan, Weikart met his future wife, Phyllis Saxton, then a master's candidate in the Department of Health and Physical Education. They were married in the summer of 1957 in Shelton, Connecticut. In the fall of 1957 Weikart began working part-time as a school psychologist for the Ypsilanti Public Schools in Ypsilanti, Michigan; he began full-time work there the following year. In 1962, Weikart collaborated with a committee of elementary education leaders (including Charles Eugene Beatty) to create the Perry Preschool Project. He and his colleagues designed this project to find the causes and cures of academic underperformance of students in Ypsilanti's poorest neighborhoods. The committee studied the teaching methods and curriculum choices for these students and zeroed in on creating a program for three- and four-year-olds to prepare them for success in elementary school and beyond. Weikart and his colleagues implemented this preschool program at Perry Elementary School in Ypsilanti. Perry Preschool's program focused on each child's intellectual maturation and supported the child's development through a process of active learning. The HighScope Perry Preschool Project was evaluated in a randomized controlled trial of 123 low-income children to examine the long-term effectiveness of the type of curriculum used in the Perry Preschool (now known as the HighScope Curriculum). The HighScope Preschool Study concluded that a high-quality program for young, at-risk children contributes positively to their school success and economic outcomes and decreases their teen pregnancy rate and involvement in criminal activity. In 1970, Weikart left the Ypsilanti Schools to establish the HighScope Educational Research Foundation to continue his work on the preschool approach that he and his colleagues developed during the Perry Preschool Project. In addition, Weikart and his wife worked as staff in leadership positions at several summer camps until they founded HighScope Camp in 1963. The couple had four daughters, all born between 1959 and 1963. Juggling full-time work, summer camp activities, a new family, and work on his PhD, Weikart received his degree from the University of Michigan in 1966. In 1991 Weikart received an honorary Doctor of Science degree from Oberlin College in recognition of his achievements. He died December 9, 2003, from leukemia."

  "text" : "David Simon Charles Goodman (born 25 February 1958 in England) is an International Master of chess, and a chess writer. Awarded the IM title in 1983, he won the World Youth Chess Championship (Cadets) in 1975. He played #10 on the English national team in Moscow in 1977. The following year he was part of the five-man English team that won the World Under-26 Team Championship in Mexico City. He was a reporter and editor for AP before becoming a full-time chess teacher in New York City in 2002. He started his career as a stringer reporting on international chess tournaments for AP, before joining the company as a full-time newsman in 1990. Goodman was educated at Latymer Upper School in London and at Keble College, Oxford. He has a BA and honorary MA from Oxford in Philosophy, Politics, and Economics. Goodman became known for helping to break the news that Soviet Defense Minister Dmitriy Ustinov was dead. The 1984–1985 Kasparov-Karpov World Championship was played in Moscow's Hall of Columns where the bodies of Soviet leaders used to lie in state. After a series of unusual timeouts at the match, Goodman was able to establish through his chess contacts that Ustinov had died. Goodman has interviewed Woody Allen and John Cleese and covered speeches by the first President Bush and former President Gerald Ford. He is the chess teacher of Don Imus and his son and has appeared on Imus in the Morning. He has a FIDE Elo rating of 2405. As of December 2009, Goodman is currently a coach for the elementary school chess team of the Abraham Joshua Heschel High School in New York City."

He also gave his consent to the Australian Dung Beetle Project (1965-1985) which saw the introduction of dung beetles to Australia as a fly control measure. While this was a risky decision because of the threat that the dung beetles could themselves become pests or disrupt the delicate ecological balance, it proved very successful and reduced the population of bush flies by 90%."

Pederson later converted to the Eastern Orthodox Church where, taking Holy Orders as an archimandrite, he served for more than a decade as the founder and head of the Orthodox Christian Prison Ministry. Now semiretired, Pederson still ministers to prisoners and those on the street, through homeless shelters, as well as serving various parishes in Southern California and Minnesota of the Antiochian Orthodox Church.

  "text" : "David Branson (February 1963 – 11 December 2001) was an Australian theatre director, actor, and writer. David Branson's father John was an Antarctic scientist, and his mother Margaret a school librarian. Branson attended Hackett Primary School, Watson High, and Dickson College in Canberra. He was regular churchgoer and a member of many youth groups. Branson was a dynamic thespian and theatre-worker. He worked with community groups, youth theatres, Repertory Theatre, and groups of his own devising to create innumerable productions. He played the violin in the Canberra Youth Orchestra and in many local bands such as The Black Dogs, The Plunderers, and The Gadflys. He was a member of among others: the Doug Anthony Allstars, Found Objects, and the Performing Arts Cafe. In 1985 Branson, Ross Cameron, John Utans, and Patrick Troy founded Splinters Theatre of Spectacle which had its origins in mediaevalist antics in Canberra's inner north. Splinters staged several large productions, sometimes involving hundreds of people, fire sculptures, giant puppets, & large moving metal sculptures. Early Splinters performances were at a now-demolished weatherboard cottage in Downer, and the Causeway Hall at Kingston, as well as backyards in the inner north. Splinters made good use of crowd manipulation. During his time with Splinters he was involved in more than 20 productions including Cry Stinking Fish (1987) as part of the Melbourne Spoleto Festival, Gumboot Full of Blood (1988), Cathedral of Flesh (1992) (winner Best Promenade Theatre Performance Award in the Adelaide Fringe Festival, Guardians of the Concourse (1993, National Festival of Australian Theatre, Canberra), Utopia/Distopia (1995, Springbank Island, Canberra), and Faust - The Heat of Knowledge (1996, 50th Anniversary Celebrations of the Australian National University). After theatre studies in Melbourne, Branson worked as an actor with many different companies including La Mama Theatre. As a director he staged The Threepenny Opera and Handel's Ariodante. His Ribbons of Steel used a mix of archival material, interpretive art, sculpture and photographic exhibits, to mark the closure of Newcastle's BHP Steelworks. Under the pseudonym 'Senor Handsome' he was a founding member, and violinist, of the cabaret group Mikelangelo and the Black Sea Gentlemen. He also directed works by Daniel Keene, Grahame Henderson, Alison Croggon, Geire Kami and Christos Tsiolkas.Branson remained with Splinters until 1996 when he became the Artistic Director of Culturally Innovative Arts, which he founded with Louise Morris. Branson remained a Canberra identity, and divided his time largely between Canberra and Melbourne. In Canberra he hosted the \"Terrace Sessions\" at the Terrace Bar, the Gypsy Bar and the \"Salons at the Street\" at the Street Theatre, where many avant-garde performances were staged. Branson often accompanying others with impromptu violin or off-the-cuff poesy. Branson coined the moniker \"Brian Desire\" for Canberra artist/poet Brian Hincksmann. He died in a car accident in Anzac Parade. An extraordinary eight hundred people attended his funeral at St Margaret's Anglican Church in Hackett, the inner-north suburb of Canberra where he grew up. And a large crowd performed and attended Memorials at the Street Theatre in Canberra and the Trades Hall in Melbourne. A street in Dunlop in the Belconnen region of Canberra is named after him."

  "text" : "Danny Lee Harris (born September 7, 1965 in Torrance, California) is an American former track and field athlete who specialized in the 400-meter hurdles. He won silver medals at the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles and the 1987 World Championships in Rome, both behind Edwin Moses. His time of 48.02 in 1984 at age 18 is still the current world junior record. Harris's greatest moment came at a meeting in Madrid in 1987 where he defeated Edwin Moses—who had been undefeated since 1977. Later in the same year, Harris came very close to defeating Moses again in a dramatic final at the World Championships, but Moses defended his title by 2/100 of a second. Harris could not take part in the 1988 Olympics, just finishing fifth at the 1988 United States Olympic trials in Indianapolis. Danny Harris is an alumnus of Perris High School in Perris, California, where he grew up. In 1983, he won the CIF California State Championship in the 300 hurdles, and ran a thrilling anchor leg vs Hawthorne High School's Henry Thomas in the team's second place 4×400 metres relay team, leading Perris to its most impressive showing at the event. He returned to coach the boys' track team in 2001, and he led them to their first League Championship since he ran for the school almost 20 years earlier. Harris competed collegiately at Iowa State University. He collected three national championships and four Drake Relay titles while at Iowa State. He was never beaten by a collegiate athlete in the 400-meter hurdles during his time at Iowa State. Harris helped lead the Cyclones to three outdoor Big Eight team titles and two indoor crowns during his three-year career, collecting 12 Big Eight career titles. Harris set Big Eight records in the 400 hurdles, 600 yards and 4x400 relay. He was inducted into the Drake Relays Hall of Fame in 1995, the Iowa State Hall of Fame in 2000, and the Iowa Sports Hall of Fame in 2005. Harris' personal best for the 400 m hurdles is 47.38 seconds, set at Lausanne in July 1991. That time still ranks him the #12 performer of all time."

  "text" : "David W. \"Dave\" Bargeron (born September 6, 1942 in Athol, Massachusetts) is an American trombonist and tuba player most famous for playing with the jazz-rock group Blood, Sweat, and Tears. He was lead trombonist with Clark Terry's Big Band, and played bass trombone and tuba with Doc Severinsen's Band between 1968 and 1970. He joined Blood, Sweat, and Tears in 1970, after Jerry Hyman departed, and first appeared on the album Blood, Sweat & Tears 4. With this group he recorded the jazz-rock solo on the tuba in \"And When I Die/One room country shack\" on the album Live and Improvised (1975). His recording credits with BS&T include eleven albums. A break in their schedule allowed Dave to join the Gil Evans Orchestra in 1972, and he remains a member of that Orchestra to this day. After leaving BS&T, Dave became a freelance recording and jazz artist. Based in New York City, he has recorded with Billy Joel, Paul Simon, Mick Jagger, James Taylor, Eric Clapton, David Sanborn, Carla Bley and Pat Metheny. Dave currently records and tours internationally with the George Gruntz Concert Jazz Band from Switzerland, the George Russell Living Time Orchestra, and was a long-time member of Jaco Pastorius' Word of Mouth Band. He also records and tours with 'Tuba Tuba', a jazz tuba band in which he plays with Michel Godard, Luciano Biondini, and Kenwood Dennard. 'Tuba Tuba' tours Europe and performs at various jazz festivals and master classes. He is also a charter member of Howard Johnson's \"Gravity,\" the 6-tuba group that has been together since 1968. Bargeron has released several CDs, both as a soloist and in collaboration with others. He now lives in New York and has four children. Bargeron often plays a King 3B with a sterling silver bell and uses a Besson EEb tuba. Examples of his work can be heard on the BS&T songs \"Go Down Gambling\", \"Redemption,\" \"Snow Queen,\" and \"No Show.\" He is often compared to trombonist James Pankow of Chicago and Jim Pugh of the Woody Herman band."

  "text" : "Diane Pretty (15 November 1958 - 11 May 2002) was a British woman from Luton who became notable after being the focus of a debate about the laws of euthanasia in the United Kingdom during the early part of the 21st century. She had attempted to change British law so she could end her own life because of the pains and problems that she endured because of the terminal illness motor neurone disease, which she suffered from. She stated \"I want to have a quick death without suffering, at home surrounded by my family\". Pretty had been diagnosed with motor neurone disease several years before. Over time, the disease worsened and made it impossible for her to move or communicate easily even though her mental faculties remained normal. The illness resulted in her having to be looked after round the clock by her husband and nurses, meaning that she could not commit suicide, which she had said she would do if she was able to. She stated a wish that her husband should be able to assist her in ending her life, but this is classed as assisted suicide, which is a criminal offence in England and Wales under the Suicide Act 1961. Because suicide is a lawful option for those capable of committing it; it could be argued that refusing the option to those disabled could be considered discrimination, which is unlawful under both UK and European law. In return, assisting someone in committing suicide who cannot themselves is not considered a 'service' in which can be deprived. Neither of these were argued in the courts. Pretty took her case to court using the Human Rights Act 1998 to argue that the Director of Public Prosecutions should make a commitment not to prosecute anybody involved in helping her to die. She focused on Articles 3 and 8 in her argument. British courts did not accept Pretty's arguments, with the House of Lords, Britain's highest court at the time, eventually turning her case down. The European Court of Human Rights refused to acknowledge that the European Convention on Human Rights provided a right to die, and her appeal to that court also failed.She stated  \"I feel I have no rights,\" after her appeal to the House of Lords was rejected. Diane Pretty died aged 43 on 11 May 2002, as her health had deteriorated over the last several months due to a series of lung and chest problems."

  "text" : "David Francis Powers (April 25, 1912 – March 27, 1998) was Special Assistant and assistant Appointments Secretary to President of the United States John F. Kennedy. Powers served as Museum Curator of the John F. Kennedy Library and Museum from 1964 until his retirement in May 1994. Powers was a military veteran who had served in the U.S. Army Air Corps during World War II from 1942 to 1945. Powers was also a very close, personal friend of John F. Kennedy. The son of Irish immigrants, Powers was born in the Charlestown section of Boston. His father died when he was two-years old. During the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, Powers and Kenneth P. O'Donnell were riding in the Secret Service follow-up car directly behind the presidential limousine and are seen in the famous Zapruder film. In 1996, the Assassination Records Review Board released three-minutes of film footage captured by Powers in Dallas prior to the assassination. Powers said he began filming when the motorcade left Love Field but ran out of film at 12:17 p.m before reaching Dealey Plaza. Powers and Kenneth O'Donnell co-authored \"Johnny We Hardly Knew Ye\": Memories of John Fitzgerald Kennedy (Boston: Little, Brown & Co., 1972). ISBN 0-316-71625-1 Powers' granddaughter, Jenny Powers, gained fame as a Broadway actress and performer. An ardent Democrat like her grandfather, she was asked to sing the National Anthem at the 2000 Democratic National Convention in Los Angeles. Judith Campbell Exner in her autobiography Judith Exner: My Story alleged that Powers assisted in setting up encounters with President Kennedy. Powers would later state that Kennedy never had an affair with Exner."

She announced December 14, 2012 that she would resign effective January 1, 2013 to return to private practice as a tax attorney, telling The Hill newspaper, \"I really want to get back in the fray and be an advocate.\" In response, the executive director of the Sierra Club, Michael Brune, called her a \"fearless leader\" for clean energy. Appointed to the Corporate Commission by Governor Frank Keating, Bode took office on August 20, 1997 and was elected on November 3, 1998 with over 60% of the vote, a record for a Republican running statewide for the first time. She was reelected to her second full term in November 2004. In January 2005 she began her second and last six-year term in office, having won reelection by the most votes ever garnered by a Republican candidate for an Oklahoma statewide office."

Eltit received a bachelor's degree in literature and works in the Universidad Tecnológica Metropolitana. She was culture attaché during Patricio Aylwin's government at the Chilean Embassy in Mexico. In her books, she breaks traditional novel conventions with sordid places, marginal characters and a prose marked by an ambiguous speech and exaltations to the body of the injured or hurt woman. She's one of the members of the so-called generación del 87, after Salvador Allende's administration. Eltit is and was, especially during the junta government, a performance artist and social examiner. Her work often subverts the norm and examines the structure of oppression and repressed desire. Eltit is married to Jorge Arrate, the communist candidate in the 2009 Chilean presidential elections. Eltit supported Arrate in his campaign."

  "text" : "Gilbert \"Danny\" McNamee (born 29 September 1960) is a former electronic engineer from Crossmaglen, Northern Ireland, who was wrongly convicted in 1987 of conspiracy to cause explosions, including the Provisional Irish Republican Army's (IRA) Hyde Park bombing on 20 July 1982. McNamee was arrested on 16 August 1986 at his home in Crossmaglen by the British Army and Royal Ulster Constabulary, then flown to London and charged with conspiracy to cause explosions. At his trial at the Old Bailey he denied even having sympathy for the IRA, and no evidence was ever presented that he had any paramilitary links. Additionally, the IRA itself stated that he was not a member, and never claimed him as a \"prisoner of war\". However, his fingerprint was found on electronic circuits in an arms cache that was linked to the Hyde Park bombing. At his trial he explained that he may have handled the circuits when working for a previous employer, who he did not know had IRA connections. After five hours of deliberation by the jury, McNamee was found guilty on all charges and sentenced to 25 years in prison. In September 1994, McNamee and Paul Magee were among six prisoners who escaped from Whitemoor Prison, shooting and wounding a prison officer as they did so, before being captured two hours later. In 1997 his case was examined by Channel 4's Trial and Error programme. McNamee was later to be the first case referred to the Court of Appeal by the Criminal Cases Review Commission, and his conviction was overturned on 17 December 1998 because of other, much more prominent, fingerprints on the same circuits, belonging to known IRA bomb-maker Dessie Ellis (who received a ten-year sentence in Ireland for possession of explosives after the bombings, but before MacNamee's trial), which were not disclosed at McNamee's original trial. Despite quashing McNamee's conviction, the appeal judges stated, \"The Crown makes a strong case that the appellant [McNamee] was guilty of a conspiracy to cause explosions.\" Supporters of the campaign to clear his name included the comedian Jeremy Hardy. In February 1999, McNamee read the IRA Roll of Honour at the Burns and Moley commemoration and the following month he sat with the Caraher family during the trial of Michael Caraher and other members of the Provisional IRA South Armagh Brigade sniper team."

  "text" : "Dick Proctor (born in Toronto, February 12, 1941) is a Canadian political activist, former New Democratic Party (NDP) Member of Parliament, and a former journalist. Proctor has been active with the NDP in a number of capacities since the 1970s. In the early part of that decade, he was communications director for Ontario NDP leader Stephen Lewis. He was cabinet press secretary to then-Premier of Saskatchewan Allan Blakeney during the 1978 and 1982 provincial election campaigns. He was executive assistant to federal NDP leader Ed Broadbent in the intervening period. In the mid-1980s, Proctor worked as the research director for the National Union of Provincial Government Employees and then as the project coordinator of the Canadian Labour Congress in Latin America. He returned to the NDP in 1989 to serve as the party's federal secretary. He then served as provincial secretary for the Saskatchewan New Democratic Party from 1993 to 1996. He also worked as a journalist for the Edmonton Journal and Toronto Telegram in the 1960s and 1970s, and as sportswriter for the Globe and Mail in the 1970s. Moonlighting for The Hockey News under the pseudonym \"Mike Gamble\", he wrote a profile of 16-year-old junior hockey player Wayne Gretzky, and may have been the first person to use the phrase \"The Great Gretzky\". Proctor entered electoral politics when he won a seat in the  federal election representing the Saskatchewan riding of Palliser. He was re-elected in the 2000 election and served as NDP caucus chair from 2000 until he lost his seat in the 2004 federal election by 124 votes. From 2004 to 2005 he served as chief of staff to NDP leader Jack Layton. He retired to Victoria, British Columbia in 2005. As an MP, Proctor forced the resignation of Solicitor-General Andy Scott in 1998 when, on a flight from Ottawa to Saint John, New Brunswick, he overheard an indiscreet conversation between Scott and a political ally discussing the inquiry into the Royal Canadian Mounted Police's handling of protesters at the Vancouver Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation meeting. According to Proctor, Scott's predicted the outcome of the inquiry thus creating the impression that the judicial inquiry's findings had been predetermined. Dick Proctor returned from retirement in October 2008 to act as Interim Federal Secretary for the NDP federal office. The vacancy he is filling was left by Éric Hébert-Daly, who resigned immediately following the 2008 campaign."

  "text" : "Deepika Padukone (pronounced [d̪iːpɪkaː pəɖʊkoːɳ]; born 5 January 1986) is an Indian film actress. She is one of the highest-paid actresses in India and is cited in the media as one of the nation's most popular and attractive personalities. Padukone has established a career in Hindi films, and is the recipient of several awards, including three Filmfare Awards. Padukone, the daughter of the badminton player Prakash Padukone, was born in Copenhagen and raised in Bangalore. As a teenager she played badminton in national level championships, but left her career in the sport to become a fashion model. She soon received offers for film roles, and made her acting debut in 2006 as the title character of the Kannada film Aishwarya. Padukone then played a dual role in her first Bollywood release—the 2007 blockbuster Om Shanti Om—and won a Filmfare Award for Best Female Debut. Padukone received praise for portraying the lead female roles in the romance Love Aaj Kal (2009) and the drama Lafangey Parindey (2010), but her performances in the romance Bachna Ae Haseeno (2008) and the comedy Housefull (2010) were met with negative reviews. The 2012 box office hit Cocktail marked a turning point in Padukone's career, earning her praise and Best Actress nominations at several award ceremonies. She rose to prominence with starring roles in the comedies Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani (2013), Chennai Express (2013), and Happy New Year (2014), and the historical romance Bajirao Mastani (2015), all of which rank among the highest-grossing Bollywood films. Padukone's acclaimed portrayal of a character based on Juliet in the tragic romance Goliyon Ki Raasleela Ram-Leela (2013) and a headstrong architect in the comedy-drama Piku (2015) won her two Best Actress awards at Filmfare. Alongside her acting career, Padukone participates in stage shows, has written columns for an Indian newspaper, is a prominent celebrity endorser for brands and products, and is vocal about issues such as feminism and depression. She has designed her own line of clothing for women and is the founder of The Live Love Laugh Foundation, which creates awareness on mental health in India."

  "text" : "David Williams is an author, journalist and theologian, based in New Zealand. He gained notoriety following the publication of his 1989 account of the failed drug run and subsequent execution of Australian drug runners, Kevin Barlow and Geoffrey Chambers. Titled This Little Piggy Stayed Home: Barlow, Chambers and the Mafia the book was one of the more controversial publications of Panorama Books. The book was never printed again following its initial release, despite continued demand, because of fears of litigation. It caused a stir in the large Italian community based in Western Australia and, for a time, was roundly rejected as an accurate account of the mafia's existence and operation in WA. That changed when famed mafia hunter, Judge Giovanni Falcone, used Williams' book to describe the formation of the mafia in the state around cells of influence. Falcone was assassinated on 23 May 1992, in a massive car bomb attack — not six months following his vindication of Williams' work. Williams took an extended break from journalism after reporting on the deaths of nine people in the Gracetown cliff collapse in 1996. Grace town is a small coastal community on the south-west coast of Western Australia, near Margaret River. His piece was the only eyewitness journalistic account of the events following the tragedy, but it was his own involvement in the community effort to recover the bodies from beneath the sand that led to his disenchantment with media. Williams pursued theological studies for some years and eventually earned a PhD. He took up an academic role at Laidlaw College, in Auckland, New Zealand, where he designed a new counselling degree programme. He left the college after some years and launched his own news magazine. Williams continues to author books and consults in the areas of communication, human relationships, epistemology and theology, through his consultancy Other Wise. His latest book is on the life and death of Dr Jared Noel, a young Auckland City Hospital surgeon who succumbed to bowel cancer in October 2014. In the five or so years that Jared fought the disease, he wrote a blog about his journey of suffering, faith and hope, which garnered a large following. Williams interviewed Jared almost daily in the final month leading up to his death, and the book, told in Jared's voice and from his perspective, is a reflection on a young person's submission to mortality, and an inspirational account of how to approach death with unending hope."

In the 1983 World Championships 5,000-metre final, Padilla was among the favourites, but he succumbed to the radically accelerating pace of top runners, such as Ireland's Eamonn Coghlan, East Germany's Werner Schildhauer and Finland's Martti Vainio, during the last lap. He lost to the winner, Coghlan, by 3.55 seconds, but managed to defeat another unlucky favourite, West Germany's Thomas Wessinghage, by 0.38 seconds. By contrast, the fast 1984 Olympic 5,000-metre final was tough for Padilla already after 3,000 metres, and he painstakingly defeated New Zealand's John Walker who finished eighth. He was ranked number 1 in the world in 1983 for the 3000-meter distance."

Rowe came to England in her forties, working at Sheffield University and was the head of Lincolnshire Department of Clinical Psychology. In addition to her published works on depression, she is a regular columnist in the UK. She spent her time working with depressed patients and, through listening to their stories, came to reject the medical model of mental illness, instead working within personal construct theory. She believes that depression is a result of beliefs which do not enable a person to live comfortably with themselves or the world. Most notably it is the belief in a \"Just World\" (that the bad are punished and the good rewarded) that exacerbates feelings of fear and anxiety if disaster strikes. Part of recovering is accepting that the external world is unpredictable and that we control relatively little of it. The BBC were required to apologise to Dorothy Rowe in 2009 after the production editing of her radio interview misrepresented her views on the impact of religion in providing structure to people's lives."

In December 2006, Karwacki addressed the Liberal leadership convention in Montreal on the topic of Liberalism in Western Canada. Karwacki ran in the Saskatoon Meewasin constituency in the 2007 Saskatchewan general election, placing third and receiving a lower percentage than in the 2003 general election.

  "text" : "Dai Zhen (Chinese: 戴震; pinyin: Dài Zhèn; Wade–Giles: Tai Chen, January 19, 1724 – July 1, 1777) was a prominent Chinese scholar of the Qing dynasty from Xiuning, Anhui. A versatile scholar, he made great contributions to mathematics, geography, phonology and philosophy. His philosophical and philological critiques of Neo-Confucianism continue to be influential. Dai's philosophical contributions included those to the Han Learning school of Evidential Learning (Evidentialism) which criticized the Song Learning school of Neo-Confucianism. In particular, two criticisms that Dai made was: First, Neo-Confucianism focused too much on introspective self-examination whereas truth was to be found in investigation of the external world. Second, he criticized the Neo-Confucian drive to eliminate human desire as an obstacle to rational investigation. Dai argued that human desire was a good and integral part of the human experience, and that eliminating human desire from philosophy had the bad effect of making it difficult to understand and control one's emotions as well as making it impossible to establish empathy with others."

In the 2002 congressional elections, Wofford was the Democratic nominee for the 6th US House district in Pennsylvania, a district gerrymandered with the goal of electing Republican State Senator Jim Gerlach. His campaign website was given \"The Candidate Vanity Award\" by the political website PoliticsPA for its large photo of Wofford. The district was more competitive than voter registration numbers suggested, and the election was close: Wofford lost 51%-49%. In 2008, Wofford was a delegate for Pennsylvania to the Democratic National Convention. He voted for Democratic nominee Barack Obama. Wofford graduated with a law degree from Georgetown University in 1983. He has a A.B. from Yale (history, 1977).

  "text" : "Donald (Don) Butcher, a squash player from England, was the first player to actually win the British Open men's title (for 1931). Butcher was a professional squash player based at the Conservative Club in London when he played in the first British Open final in December 1930. His opponent Charles Read, a former English professional champion, was designated open champion at the initiation of the event, which was a 'challenge' event without any preliminary rounds (the final was played under a best-of-three-legs format, which continued until 1947). Butcher defeated Read in the first match at the Queen's Club 9-6, 9-5, 9-5. He then won the second match at the Conservative Club 9-3, 9-5, 9-3 to claim the title and make the third match unnecessary. In 1932, Butcher successfully defended his title against Charles Arnold, winning the first match at the Conservative Club 9-0, 9-0, 9-0, and the second match at the Bath Club 9-3, 9-0, 9-5. Butcher was unsuccessful in his defence of the Championship in 1933 against Egyptian player F.D. Amr Bey and similarly unsuccessful in his challenge against Amr in 1935 (there was no challenge to Amr in 1934). Butcher also won the British Professional Championship in 1930, 1931 and 1932. Butcher was considered a very innovative player in his time. He deviated from the conventional up-and-down-the-wall style adopted by most players in his era, making full use of boasts (shots that come off a side wall before hitting the front wall), lobs, drop shots and reverse angles, as well as cultivating the serve. His lack of stamina during long matches was considered to be one of his main weaknesses, however, and this gave the athletic Amr Bey a key advantage over Butcher on the occasions they played."

Martin was born in Kearney, Nebraska and graduated from Dartmouth College in 1929 before entering the lumber business. He was a member of the Nebraska Republican Committee and Republican National Committee in the 1950s; in 1954, he was an unsuccessful primary candidate for United States Senate. Martin ran for Congress in 1960, defeating freshman Democrat Donald McGinley by a slim margin. He served as minority chairman of House Rules Committee and was also a member of the Education and Labor Committee. He was Ranking Republican on the Rules Committee in his last three terms. He cochaired with Rep. Richard Howard Ichord, Jr. of Missouri the Select Committee on the Reorganization of the Congress in 1973-74. In 1974, he was a floor leader in the confirmation of Nelson Rockefeller, his Dartmouth classmate, as Vice President of the United States. After leaving Congress, Martin became a member of the Nebraska State College Board and was a visiting professor. In 1980, he served as Nebraska chairman for the unsuccessful presidential bid of George H. W. Bush. Martin died in his hometown of Kearney after suffering from pneumonia at age 89."

He was a delegate to the 1964 Democratic National Convention and the 1968 Democratic National Convention. He became a judge in the court of industrial relations in Lincoln, Nebraska from 1976 to 1980. More than two decades later, McGinley made a political comeback as the running mate of Nebraska Gov.

As a member of the council, he was barred from being selected as a replacement mayor and James McClinton was appointed to the position in December 2003 and sworn in the following month. As a show of support for Felker, Pomeroy did not use his desk or his office during his time as acting mayor. (He moved in a separate desk and moved the old desk out of the way.) He also did not sit in the mayor's position during city council meetings, instead keeping his spot as the deputy mayor. Pomeroy was born in Topeka and attended Washburn University where he received a Bachelor's degree in political science, as well as a teaching certification. He subsequently taught government and social studies at Topeka High School, where he has been dubbed \"P-Roy\" by his students and athletes. He is also the head tennis coach for the Trojans, as well as the head coach of the school's bowling team, which, as of the 2014-2015 school year, is only in its tenth year of existence.

  "text" : "Denis Midgley Arnold, CBE (Sheffield, 15 December 1926 – Budapest, 28 April 1986) was a British musicologist. After being employed in the extramural department of Queen's University, Belfast, he became a Lecturer in Music at the University of Hull, and from 1969 to 1975 was Professor of Music at The University of Nottingham. From 1975 he was Heather Professor of Music at Oxford University. He served as editor of Music & Letters. He is best known for his editing of The New Oxford Companion to Music (1983, Oxford University Press), which under his editorship grew to a two-volume work of some 2000 pages, with a broader coverage than Percy Scholes' original; and for his work on the music of Monteverdi, Marenzio and Giovanni Gabrieli. A frequent broadcaster, he also reviewed a great many recordings (mostly in the field of Renaissance music) for Gramophone. The Denis Arnold Hall at the University of Oxford and the Denis Arnold Music Library at the University of Nottingham are both named after him."

  "text" : "David Keenan (born April 1971) is a Scottish author, critic and musician. He is the author of England's Hidden Reverse, a biography of Coil, Current 93 and Nurse With Wound, a regular contributor to The Wire since 1995, and proprietor of Volcanic Tongue, a shop, distributor, record label and mailorder business that he runs with his partner, the musician and artist Heather Leigh Murray. Keenan was a founding member of 18 Wheeler although he left after their second single and didn't appear on any albums. He played on the same bill as Oasis at their legendary debut gig at King Tut's Wah-Wah Hut in Glasgow in May 1993, where Oasis were signed to Creation Records by Alan McGee and supported them on several early tours. He later formed Telstar Ponies and Phantom Engineer. From 1997 through 1998 he was a producer at XFM Radio in London, where he was responsible for the daytime and early evening programming, producing shows by Claire Sturgess and Keith Cameron while also presenting shows himself and collaborating with Ricky Gervais on various live, improvised sketches. It is rumoured that Gervais' character of Gareth Keenan in The Office was named after him as a back-handed tribute. In 1998 Sophie Ellis-Bextor's first group, The Audience, dedicated a track to him on the B-side of their \"A Pessimist Is Never Disappointed\" single, entitled \"Bells For David Keenan\". Until 2008 he was a member of Taurpis Tula alongside Heather Leigh Murray and Alex Neilson (collaborator with Jandek, Will Oldham and Richard Youngs) and played alongside Neilson as Tight Meat Duo, who often expanded to a trio with the addition of bassist George Lyle. In November 2007, the trio undertook a UK tour in collaboration with US musician Sonny Simmons, playing as a quartet throughout. In February 2008, he performed at the Instal festival playing a three-hour set in a one-off group which featured Alan Silva, Incapacitants and Don Dietrich of Borbetomagus, amongst others. Over the years he has collaborated with players such as John Olson (Wolf Eyes), drummer Chris Corsano, Acid Mothers Temple (as part of the group Rebel Powers), bassists John Edwards and Margarida Garcia, saxophonist Paul Flaherty, Richard Youngs, Matthew Valentine, Mirror, drummers Paul Hession, Sabu Toyozumi and Ben Hall and Japanese psychedelic group Suishou no Fune. Keenan has also issued four chapbooks of poetry, published by the American small press Kendra Steiner Editions. Two are solo works: Just Another High and High All The Time. A third, More Ragas, is a collaboration with Texas poet Bill Shute and a tribute/sequel to the 1959 book Ragas by David Meltzer. The most recent chapbook, published in December 2006, is Voluntary Quicksand (In Memory of Richard Brautigan), a collaboration with Shute and with Byron Coley. In 2008 Keenan announced that he was winding up his musical activities in order to focus exclusively on his writing. He is rumoured to be currently at work on a second history of the UK underground experimental music scene entitled Crime Calls for Night, as well as his debut novel. His work for The Wire has been highly influential, helping to focus the magazine more towards coverage of new experimental rock, noise, folk, industrial and psychedelic music. His most frequently cited article is a cover story that appeared in the August 2003 issue entitled \"New Weird America\", where Keenan coined the phrase 'Free Folk', later bastardised to include 'Freak Folk' and 'Wyrd Folk' and used to describe everyone from Jack Rose and Charalambides through Devendra Banhart. He has presented several lectures on Free Folk and Industrial Culture in venues such as The Sage at Gateshead and the Colour Out Of Space event in Brighton. He also curated the Subcurrent festival, which ran for several years in Glasgow. In 2005 he was the creative consultant for the Instal festival, having retired from a similar position with Stirling's Le Weekend festival after a 5-year tenure.During the late-90s through the early 2000s, Keenan was the Jazz Critic for the Scottish Sunday Herald newspaper. Over the years his work has also appeared in Spiral Scratch (where he was first published in the late-1980s), MXpress, Melody Maker, NME, Mojo, Mojo Collections, Opprobrium, Uncut, The Ecstatic Peace Poetry Journal and The Glasgow Herald. He has contributed sleeve notes and press packs to artists such as Throbbing Gristle, Albert Ayler, Ilyas Ahmed, Paul Flaherty & Chris Corsano, Pita and Gary Smith. A 2009 quote of Keenan cited by Karl Shaw, reproduced in his article in the Wall Street Journal (Review, Sept 24-25 2011), on the Beatles: \"The Beatles are the absolute curse of modern Indie music...my favorite Beatle is Yoko Ono; without Yoko's influence, I don't think there would be any Beatles music I could listen to.\""

During the 1939-40 West Midlands (Regional) League play, McMahon had an impressive nine goals in six games for the Wolves 'A' team, when league play was halted. During the war, McMahon served with Royal Canadian Naval Volunteer Reserves. In England he guested for Chester, scoring six times against Stockport County in December 1939. In 1946 McMahon played for the Chicago Vikings in the newly formed North American Soccer Football League. He played for Eastern Canada selects against the Eastern United States in 1947 and 1948 and then Scotland in 1949. In 1948, McMahon won a Canadian championship medal with Montreal Carsteel, in a season in which he scored a Canadian record 71 goals."

Her music has at times been deemed nostalgic because of its Swing Revival style. This makes her work somewhat analogous to American swing revivalists like The Brian Setzer Orchestra or Big Bad Voodoo Daddy, though stylistically it is more similar to 1920s and 1930s swing jazz such as Django Reinhardt's. She is primarily a jazz singer, though also is a guitarist. She is signed with Avex Group's Rhythm Zone sublabel. She used to be connected with Victor Entertainment."

His patents allowed the railroad to more easily communicate with construction crews building the First Transcontinental Railroad in America. The insulator had a thick metal casing around blown glass; the assembly was held together with molten sulfur. Out of the tube extends a \"ramshorn\" rod that held the telegraph wires. It was mounted into holes drilled into the bottom of wooden crossarms attached to poles. Prior to the invention, Brooks worked for the Pennsylvania Railroad, which in the 1850s received permission to build its own telegraph line, having bought necessary patents. Brooks was the railroad's first superintendent of telegraphs, appointed in 1852."

  "text" : "David Harold Kurtzman (January 11, 1903 – February 22, 1977) was the fourteenth Chancellor (1966–1967) of the University of Pittsburgh. He had been Vice Chancellor of Finance and was appointed Acting Chancellor after the sudden death of Stanton Crawford. Crawford died of a heart attack January 26, 1966. Kurtzman's administration negotiated the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania's bailout of Pitt's fiscal woes. The university became a state-related institution on August 23, 1966. On January 13, 1967 the Board of Trustees announced its selection of Wesley Posvar as its new Chancellor, effective June 1. Kurtzman, that same day, was promoted to the full rank of Chancellor until the Chancellor-elect was installed. A ballroom in the university's William Pitt Union is named in his honor. Kurtzman was born near Odessa, Ukraine, in then-czarist Russia, and survived pogroms as a boy, eventually immigrating to the United States in 1921. He earned his undergraduate degree from Temple University and his Ph.D. from the University of Pennsylvania. He worked for many years at the Pennsylvania Economy League. There he served as a key aide to David L. Lawrence, mayor of Pittsburgh, and Richard King Mellon, financier, in their effort to build the city's first renaissance after World War II. Kurtzman joined the newly elected Governor Lawrence in 1959 in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania as his secretary of administration. He was the defendant in the landmark Supreme Court decision Lemon v. Kurtzman."

  "text" : "Dorcas (Greek: Δορκάς, Dorkás; Aramaic: טביתא‎‎ Ṭabītā) was a disciple who lived in Joppa, referenced in the Acts of the Apostles (9:36–42) in the New Testament. Acts recounts that when she died, she was mourned by \"all the widows...crying and showing (Peter) the robes and other clothing that she had made while she was still with them\" (Acts 9:39). The Greek construct used in this passage indicates that the widows were the recipients of her charity, but she may also have been a widow herself. It is likely that she was a woman of some means, given her ability to help the poor. The disciples present called upon Peter, who came from nearby Lydda to the place where her body was being laid out for burial, and raised her from the dead. This narrative concerning Tabitha/Dorcas indicates her prominence in the community at Joppa. This might also be indicated by the fact that Peter took the trouble to come to her from a neighbouring city, when requested by the community members. The name Dorcas is a Greek translation of the Aramaic name Tabitha, meaning \"gazelle\". One species of gazelle is now known as the dorcas gazelle."

  "text" : "David Malcolm Trustram Eve, 2nd Baron Silsoe QC, (2 May 1930 - 31 December 2005), who was known as David Silsoe, was a prominent British lawyer who succeeded to the title of Baron Silsoe in 1976 on the death of his father, Malcolm Eve, 1st Baron Silsoe. He assumed the familial title on succession; prior to that he was known by his family name, Trustram Eve. Silsoe rarely used his title, introducing himself as David Silsoe, and was intolerant of (and apparently embarrassed by) pomp. Educated at Elm Park Preparatory School, County Armagh, Winchester College and Christ Church, Oxford, he was called to the Bar in 1955. In 1963 he married Bridget Min Hart-Davis, daughter of Sir Rupert Hart-Davis and sister of Duff Hart-Davis and Adam Hart-Davis. He took silk in 1972. Silsoe deliberately followed a career in planning law, his favoured area, rather than spending his life in law courts, an environment he did not particularly enjoy. He was leading counsel for the proposers in notable public inquiries beginning with the Thorp nuclear fuel reprocessing plant and finishing with the Heathrow airport Terminal 5 expansion inquiry. Between the two he appeared in those for Heathrow Terminal 4, Gatwick North Terminal and Sizewell B and Hinkley Point C nuclear power stations. Silsoe never used a computer, typewriter or even a calculator, writing all communications longhand and making calculations the same way, often over many sheets of paper. He was renowned as a tireless worker, regularly working through the night on cases. His self-effacing nature and boyish demeanour served to defuse passions in many of these hotly disputed cases. He appeared to have no ego, although the consensus is that he was both highly intelligent and very persuasive. In his youth he was an excellent skier, preferring to ski off-piste on powder snow. There are stories of visitors to his chambers being treated to the sight of him hopping up the stairs as part of his training for his next skiing trip. His other passions were Russia - he was a champion of Lyra, a Russian chamber choir, and supported the family of a scientist working on the Chernobyl cleanup - and singing. Although he claimed never to have had a music lesson he was a good singer with a clear bass voice. Silsoe lived near Reading, Berkshire and was an active member of the congregation at All Saints Church, Rotherfield Peppard, acting as volunteer \"taxi driver\" for a number of infirm or learning disabled parishioners and serving for some years on the Parochial Church Council. He was instrumental in shaping the revised Henley deanery in the late 1990s. Lord Silsoe died in Reading, aged 75; he was succeeded by Simon Rupert Trustram Eve, 3rd Baron Silsoe."

  "text" : "Dale Pendell is a contemporary author who combines science and poetry in his explications of the relationship between psychoactive compounds and human beings. A long time student of ethnobotany, Pendell discusses historical and cultural uses of \"power plants\" in his works. He reads and distills the literature of pharmacology and neuroscience, of ethnobotany and anthropology, of mythology and political economics as they intersect with the direct experience of human psychoactive use. His publications include the Pharmako Trilogy: Pharmako/Poeia (1994), Pharmako/Dynamis (2002), and Pharmako/Gnosis (2005), all published by Mercury House. He covers all the major categories of psychoactives and details the use, the pharmacology, the chemistry, the political and social historical implications and effects of the use of psychoactives. He is also a myth critic. Certain of his works comment on the origins of cultural myths. Pendell has also delved into politics, introducing the concept of \"Horizon anarchism\" at his Burning Man 2006 Palenque Norte lecture."

  "text" : "David Lawrence (December 25, 1888 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania - February 11, 1973 in Sarasota, Florida) was a conservative newspaperman. He attended Princeton University (Class of 1910). While there he was a student of Woodrow Wilson. In 1916, he became the Washington correspondent of the New York Evening Post. After his reelection as U.S. President, President Woodrow Wilson fired Irish-American White House secretary (chief of staff) Joseph Patrick Tumulty in 1916 to placate anti-Catholic sentiment, particularly from his wife and his advisor Colonel Edward M. House, after which David Lawrence successfully interceded on his behalf to remain. During the presidency of Franklin Delano Roosevelt, David Lawrence criticised \"The New Deal\" in his 1934 book Beyond the New Deal, in which his observation of economic activity led him to distinguish between free enterprise and corporatism, writing that \"Theoretically, corporations are creations of the state.\" David Lawrence sharply criticised the use of the atomic bomb against Japan, comparing it to the gas chambers of Nazi concentration camps, and maintaining that the United States had become guilty and needed to apologize to the world. In 1926, Lawrence founded United States Daily, a weekly newspaper devoted to covering government, and seven years later shut it down to start United States News for an audience of community leaders, business people and politicians. In 1948, United States News merged with Lawrence's two-year-old weekly magazine, World Report to form the news magazine U.S. News & World Report. At the time of Lawrence's 1973 death, the magazine had a circulation of two million. On April 22, 1970, David Lawrence was presented with the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Richard Nixon."

  "text" : "Dorotheus (Greek: Δωρόθεος) was a professor of Roman law in the law school of Berytus in Phoenicia. While his date of birth is unknown, he must at least have died before 542. He was one of the three commissioners appointed by the Eastern Roman emperor Justinian I to draw up a book of Institutes, after the model of the Institutes of Gaius, which should serve as an introduction to the Digest (or Pandects) already completed and promulgated on 16 December 533. His colleagues in this project were Tribonian and Theophilus; and their work was accomplished in 533 and they were all granted with the highest title quaestor sacri palatii illustris. Except for the first code of 7 April 529, Dorotheus participated in the compiling of all Justinian's codes (Institutes, Digest and Codex repetitae praelectionis), including the second edition of the Codex Constitutionum (promulgated in 534). As a method of teaching, the ancient law professors (so-called antecessores) used to write commentaries (sometimes mere translations) on all parts of Justinian's law. While Justinian's law was promulgated in Latin, these commentaries were written in Greek, because lawyers (students and practitioners) were hardly able to read Latin anymore. Fragments of this commentary, which was in the Greek language, have been preserved in the Scholia appended to the body of law compiled by order of the emperor Basilius the Macedonian and his son Leo the Wise, in the 9th century, known as the Basilica. From this, it seems probable that the commentary of Dorotheus contained the substance of a course of lectures on the Digest delivered by him in the law school of Berytus. This course of lectures followed a strict order, which was prescribed by Justinian in his constitutio Omnem. According to this schedule the Institutes, a part of the Digest (Books 1 - 22) and all of the code were taught successively and most of the lecture would consist of dictation. In this dictation pattern comes firstly the Index of the statute at stake, secondly the original text in Latin and thirdly the veritable lecture on conceptual, literal and substantial problems of the respective provision."

She is most famous for her involvement in a fraud scandal at the Department of Housing and Urban Development involving the Moderate rehabilitation Program. Deborah Gore Dean is a graduate of Georgetown University and the niece of onetime Maryland GOP leader Louise Gore. Her father, Gordon Dean, who was featured on the cover of Time Magazine, won the Presidential Medal of Freedom for his work at the Nuremberg Trials, chairman of the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission, and General Dynamics executive. Her mother, Mary Benton Gore Dean was a Washington socialite and owner of the Jockey Club restaurant and Fairfax Hotel. Dean graduated with her B.A from Georgetown University. Between 1982-1987, Dean worked for the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) under secretary Samuel Pierce. Before that she served at The United States Department of Energy (DOE) as Special Assistant to the Secretary. On June 23, 1987, President Ronald Reagan announced his intention to nominate Deborah Gore Dean to be an Assistant Secretary of Housing and Urban Development. However there she was caught up in one of Washington, D.C.'s many political scandals that eventually found itself in front of the Supreme Court. A jury convicted Deborah Gore Dean of three counts of conspiracy to defraud the federal government, one count of having accepted an illegal gratuity, four counts of perjury, and four counts of engaging in a scheme to conceal material facts. The United States court of Appeals eventually threw out the bulk of the charges.The District Court had sentenced Dean to two concurrent terms of twenty-one months' confinement on the first two conspiracy counts and fined Dean $2,500 on each of those counts. On each of the remaining counts, the court sentenced Dean to twenty-one months' confinement, to run concurrently with each other and with the sentences imposed under the first two conspiracy counts. Based on the ruling of the Court of Appeals, Dean was re-sentenced and eventually served one year of home confinement and a monetary fine."

  "text" : "Margaret Daphne Hampson (born 1944) is a British theologian. Educated at Oxford and at Harvard, she held a personal Chair in 'Post-Christian Thought' at the University of St Andrews. Hampson's distinctive theological position has both gained her notoriety and been widely influential. Holding that Christianity is neither true nor moral (in not being gender inclusive), she believes the overcoming of patriarchal religion to be fundamental to human emancipation. As a theologian Hampson has always held to a 'realist' position, in which the understanding of 'that which is God' is based in human religious experience."

Prior to his role in defending the Guantanamo Bay detainees he worked with the Maryland office of the American Civil Liberties Union. Work on CAAFlog Sullivan is the founder of CAAFlog, a blog devoted to current topics in U.S. military law and the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ). CAAFlog derives the first part of its name from the acronym for the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces (CAAF), an intermediate appellate court with jurisdiction over certain courts-martial in accordance with Article 67 of the UCMJ (Title 10, United States Code, Section 867). CAAFlog currently features over a dozen contributors with experience in the field of U.S. military law. In 2008, Sullivan spotted an error in the 2008 U.S. Supreme Court decision in Kennedy v. Louisiana. The court wrote that no U.S. federal jurisdiction authorized the death penalty for child rape, but Sullivan pointed out that this was not true because Congress had specifically authorized the death penalty for such offenses as part of the 2006 amendments to the UCMJ. The Supreme Court requested briefs on the issue and subsequently modified its opinion to address the error, but the court denied a rehearing and declined to alter its decision."

At 33 seasons of ownership, Sterling was the longest-tenured owner in the NBA since the death of Los Angeles Lakers majority owner Jerry Buss in 2013. In April 2014, Sterling was banned from the NBA for life and fined $2.5 million by the league after private recordings of him making controversial comments were made public. When asked about the recordings in an interview with Anderson Cooper, Sterling stated \"I'm not a racist,\" and also told Cooper that he had made a \"terrible mistake\" and was \"here to apologize.\" In May, Sterling's wife, Shelly, reached an agreement to sell the Clippers for $2 billion to Steve Ballmer, which Sterling has contested in court. The NBA Board of Governors approved the sale of the Clippers to Ballmer on August 12, 2014."

He was very critical of the leadership under Captain Terence O'Neill, then Prime Minister of Northern Ireland. Boal opposed the manner, if not the substance, of O'Neill's attempts at improving relations with both the Irish government and the Roman Catholic/Irish nationalist minority in Northern Ireland, along with many backbenchers. Discontented with James Chichester-Clark and Brian Faulkner who came to government after O'Neill's 1969 fall from power, Boal resigned from the UUP in 1971 and joined Ian Paisley in establishing the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) in order to provide dissident unionist opinion with a viable political alternative. He worked as the first Chairman and one of the first public representatives of the DUP and continued to sit in Stormont during the years of 1971-1972. He later resumed his practice as a barrister."

  "text" : "Donald Gordon (Don) Weser (born 8 February 1937) is a retired Australian Test cricket match umpire, from Western Australia. He umpired 3 Test matches between 1979 and 1980. His first match was between Australia and England at Sydney on 10 February to 14 February 1979, won by England by 9 wickets, thus retaining The Ashes. Australian captain Graham Yallop scored 121 of the first innings total of 198, but the rest of the batting in both innings failed against Ian Botham, John Emburey and Geoff Miller. Weser's partner was fellow debutant Tony Crafter. Weser's last Test match was between Australia and New Zealand at Perth on 12 December to 14 December 1980, won by Australia by 8 wickets, with a bowling attack of Dennis Lillee, Rodney Hogg, Len Pascoe, and Jim Higgs proving too powerful. Weser's colleague was again Tony Crafter. Weser also umpired 8 One Day International (ODI) matches between 1979 and 1981. On 1 February 1981, during the third World Series Cup final at the MCG between Australia and New Zealand, Weser was informed by Greg Chappell that his brother Trevor would bowl the final ball underarm, thus denying New Zealand the chance to hit a six and tie the game. It was Weser's duty to inform both batsmen which he duly did. This incident, although legal at the time, is one of the great controversies of world cricket. He umpired one women's Test match in 1984. Altogether, he umpired 32 first-class matches in his career between 1977 and 1985. He has a son - Michael Perry Weser (born 17/9/58)"

  "text" : "Dorothy Uhnak [ˈjunæk] (April 24, 1930 – July 8, 2006; née Goldstein) was an American novelist. Uhnak was born in New York City. She attended City College of New York and the John Jay College of Criminal Justice. Uhnak worked for 14 years as a detective for the New York City Transit Police Department. Uhnak's debut book, Policewoman (1964), was a non-fiction autobiographical account of her law enforcement career. After its publication, she left police work and devoted herself to writing full-time. Her first novel, The Bait (1968), received a 1969 Edgar Award from the Mystery Writers of America for Best First Novel (in a tie with E. Richard Johnson's Silver Street). The Bait was also made into a 1973 made-for-television film of the same title. It was followed by The Witness and The Ledger, which was adapted for the TV-movie and series Get Christie Love! starring Teresa Graves. All three novels featured Christie Opara, an NYPD detective assigned to the Manhattan District Attorney Office, where Uhnak herself was assigned for many years. After the Opara trilogy, Ms. Uhnak branched out into longer, more ambitious police novels such as Law and Order, which became a TV-movie starring Darren McGavin; The Investigation, which was adapted into a TV-movie featuring Telly Savalas as Kojak; and Victims, which seemed to fictionalize the Kitty Genovese murder. Several of her later novels were bestsellers. Uhnak died in Greenport, New York, reportedly of a deliberate drug overdose."

  "text" : "Dorothy Virginia Margaret Juba (December 11, 1927 – May 3, 1990), later known as Dorothy Horan, and best known as Dovima, was an American model during the 1950s. Born in New York City, Dovima was discovered on a sidewalk in New York by an editor at Vogue, and had a photo shoot with Irving Penn the following day. She worked closely with Richard Avedon, whose photograph of her in a floor-length black evening gown with circus elephants—Dovima with the Elephants—taken at the Cirque d'hiver, Paris, in August 1955, has become an icon and sold for $1,151,976 in 2010. The gown was the first evening dress designed for Christian Dior by his new assistant, Yves Saint-Laurent. Dovima was reputed to be the highest-paid model of her time. She had a role as an aristocratic-looking, but empty-headed, fashion model with a Jackson Heights whine: Marion in Funny Face (Paramount, 1957). Dovima gave birth to a daughter named Allison on July 14, 1958, in Manhattan. Allison's father is Dovima's second husband, Allan Murray. She died of liver cancer on May 3, 1990 at the age of 62."

During World War II, his cartoons were signed Sgt. Dave Breger. Growing up in Chicago, where he was born of native Russian parents, butcher Benjamin Breger and Sophie Passin Breger, only a few weeks after they arrived in the United States from the Ukraine. As a youth, Breger had encounters with the local gangsters while working at his father's sausage factory. In 1926, he acquired his high school diploma from Crane Technical School, where he drew cartoons signed Irving Breger for the school paper. He studied architectural engineering at the University of Illinois and then transferred to Northwestern University, where he edited the campus humor magazine, Purple Parrot, while studying pre-med and psychology. He had no schooling in art or cartooning, and his college cartoons were drawn in a style similar to John Held, Jr. Graduating from Northwestern in 1931 with a degree in abnormal psychology, he spent a year traveling the world, visiting Russia and Africa; during that period he sold cartoons to the German magazine, Lustigeblaetter. He returned to Chicago and the sausage stockyard, rising to the position of office manager of his father's firm, where he devised the company slogan, \"Our Wurst Is the Best\". His first marriage, with fashion model Evelyn Breger, lasted five years."

  "text" : "George Dillwyn Parrish (July 25, 1894 – August 6, 1941) was an American writer, illustrator, and painter. Born in Colorado Springs, Colorado, Parrish was usually known by his middle name \"Dillwyn\", or \"Tim\" or \"Timmy\" by those close to him. He was the son of Thomas Parrish, who came from an artistic Philadelphia family, and Anne Lodge, who had studied at the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts, becoming a respected portrait painter, and becoming a friend of Mary Cassatt in Paris. Dillwyn Parrish was the younger brother of author Anne Parrish; they were cousins to the artist Maxfield Parrish who used them as models in some of his paintings. Dillwyn's father Thomas gained success in the Colorado mining business but died when Dillwyn was relatively young. His mother moved the family back to her hometown of Claymont, Delaware. Dillwyn Parrish studied art in Philadelphia, then attended Harvard University, where he made the acquaintance of Conrad Aiken and E. E. Cummings. During World War I he volunteered to drive ambulances for the American Field Service in France, but after being diagnosed with severe malnutrition he was sent back to the U.S. to recover. A year later he was drafted into the United States Army and served in a military hospital. While still in his twenties, medical problems began to plague him, exacerbated by the fact that he was a heavy cigarette smoker. In 1923, Dillwyn Parrish did the illustrations for a 209-page children's novel written by his sister Anne, Knee-High to a Grasshopper. They followed this publication with two more books for children, publishing Lustres in 1924 and then earning a Newbery Honor in 1925 for their third collaboration, The Dream Coach. On a trip to Switzerland the two purchased \"Le Paquis,\" a cottage in a meadow overlooking Lake Geneva not far from Lausanne between Vevey and Chexbres. For a time, Dillwyn Parrish tutored the children of a wealthy family, and eventually fell in love with Gertrude \"Gigi\" McElroy, the family's youngest girl. In 1926, Harper & Bros published his novel Smith Everlasting, and between then and 1934 three more of his books came out. In 1927 he married the fifteen-year-old \"Gigi\", and for their honeymoon the couple started out on motorcycles (see photo) from his home in Claymont, Delaware, intending to drive across the country to California. However, his new bride was severely injured in an accident in the Southwestern United States and, once she was able to travel, they completed the remainder of the journey via train. In 1929, they moved permanently to California, where a few years later, the beautiful Gigi Parrish was signed to a contract with Samuel Goldwyn's motion picture company and in 1934 she became one of the WAMPAS Baby Stars. Dillwyn and Gigi Parrish rented a beach house in Laguna Beach, next door to Mary Frances Kennedy Fisher and her husband Alfred Fisher, with whom they became friends. Dillwyn Parrish fell in love with Mary Fisher, and after encouraging her writing, helped get her culinary essays published in 1937 under the title Serve it Forth. Their relationship came at a point when his marriage was already in difficulty, and eventually both couples divorced. He married M.F.K. Fisher in 1938 and next year Harper published their co-written novel Touch and Go under the pseudonym of Victoria Berne.They lived at Le Paquis in Switzerland until 1939, when war broke out again in Europe. In January 1940 they bought land with a pinewood cabin in the San Jacinto Mountains near Hemet, California. Parrish had already contracted Buerger's disease, which resulted in the amputation of a leg. During this time, he returned to painting, creating a series of works dominated by images of angels of death that formed part of an exhibition organized by the University of California, Los Angeles. His health rapidly deteriorated, and he lived in constant pain. Faced with the necessity of further limb amputations, on August 6, 1941 he shot himself in the countryside near his home in the San Jacinto Mountains. He was cremated, his ashes buried under an overhanging rock on the mountain rim overlooking their home. He was 47 years old. Parrish's death impelled his widow into writing more books, mostly culinary. Stay Me, Oh Comfort Me: Journals and Stories 1933–1941 (1993) recounted her time with Dillwyn Parrish."

After years of working as a script reader at William Morris, Dorfman finally broke through and sold his first major script to New Line Cinemas, originally entitled The Guest, in 1998. The film's release was delayed and Dorfman's second major script, Anger Management, was actually released first. Anger Management spent two weeks at the top spot at the box office during April 2003 and grossed more than 135 million dollars. The Guest, eventually released during the summer of 2003 under the name My Boss's Daughter, could not match the major success of Anger Management, grossing almost 16 million dollars. Dorfman was rewarded for his work by being named to the list of \"Ten Hottest Voices in Comedy\" by Variety."

  "text" : "David J. Gingery (/ˈɡɪŋɡəri/; December 19, 1932 – May 3, 2004) was an inventor, writer, and machinist, best known for his series of books on how to build machine tools. Gingery is most famous for his Build Your Own Metal Working Shop From Scrap series, which details how to build a reasonably complete machine shop at low cost, often from scrap metal and other items. The hobbyist starts by constructing a small foundry capable of melting silicon-aluminum and zinc alloys from recycled automotive parts. Then green sand castings are used to make a metal lathe. The lathe is the first machine built since it can be used to help build itself. The lathe and foundry are then used to make more complicated machine tools. The books in the series are, in the suggested sequence of construction: \n*  The Charcoal Foundry \n*  The Metal Lathe \n*  The Metal Shaper \n*  The Milling Machine \n*  The Drill Press \n*  The Dividing Head & Deluxe Accessories \n*  Designing & Building The Sheet Metal Brake There is another book by Gingery, not usually counted as part of the series, entitled Building a Gas Fired Crucible Furnace, which can be substituted for that describing the charcoal foundry. The dominant themes of the series are recycling, using inexpensive and free materials, and bootstrapping the shop's capabilities. Gingery is noted for using basic methods, seldom used today, in order to make it possible for a skilled hobbyist to build the machines in the book series, usually without the aid of power tools or other expensive instruments. In addition to the Build Your Own Metal Working Shop From Scrap series, Dave Gingery and his son Vincent have published a large number of booklets on shop practices, engine construction and mechanical miscellanea. He was also a devoted amateur musician (primarily tenor banjo) and vocalist performing the music of the Great American Songbook and classic country. He told the story of practicing yodelling out in the middle of a field at his farm, before finally realizing he couldn't do it as well as he wanted."

Schippers was a lifelong Democrat but accepted and took the job in April 1998. On December 10, 1998, Schippers said to the committee: \"The President, then, has lied under oath in a civil deposition, lied under oath in a criminal grand jury. He lied to the people, he lied to his Cabinet, he lied to his top aides, and now he's lied under oath to the Congress of the United States. There's no one left to lie to.\" After an investigation, the committee in December 1998 voted to impeach Clinton, a decision supported by Schippers. In early 1999, he wrote \"Sellout: The Inside Story of President Clinton's Impeachment,\" which attacked the Clinton White House and portrayed some members of the Senate unfavorably."

  "text" : "Donald Barry de Acosta (January 11, 1912 – July 17, 1980), known as Red Barry, was an American film and television actor. He was nicknamed \"Red\" after appearing as the first Red Ryder in the highly successful 1940 film Adventures of Red Ryder; the character was played in later films by \"Wild Bill\" Elliott and Allan Lane. Barry went on to bigger budget films following Red Ryder, but none reached his previous level of success. By the 1950s, Barry was a supporting actor instead of playing leads in westerns. Early in 1955, he appeared as the bandit Milt Sharp in an episode of the syndicated series, Stories of the Century, starring and narrated by Jim Davis. Barry played \"Clete\" in the 1956 western film Seven Men from Now, starring Randolph Scott. He guest starred as Tanner in the 1958 episode \"Bullet Proof\" of the ABC/Warner Brothers series Sugarfoot, starring Will Hutchins; he was cast as Arkansas in the 1959 Sugarfoot episode \"The Return of the Canary Kid\". Barry appeared four times in the ABC/WB western Colt .45. Barry was cast as black-clad gunfighter in a 1961 episode, \"Last Stop: Oblivion\", of the ABC/WB western series, Maverick with Jack Kelly and fellow guest star Buddy Ebsen. Barry's voice in the television westerns sounded much like that of the character actor Dub Taylor. About this time, he also guest starred on two other ABC/WB dramas, Bourbon Street Beat and The Roaring 20s. He appeared as well in the syndicated crime drama, U.S. Marshal, starring John Bromfield, and the NBC education drama series, Mr. Novak, starring James Franciscus. On January 13, 1965, Barry was cast in the final episode of the short-lived Mickey ABC sitcom starring Mickey Rooney. Barry was cast as a freeloading friend who had saved Mickey's life in World War II. In 1966, Barry played Confederate soldier \"Lt. Farrow\" in the Western film Alvarez Kelly. Barry played a supporting role in the 1968 film, Shalako, with Sean Connery. Barry played supporting roles in dozens of television series, particularly westerns. He appeared eight times on the long-running NBC series, The Virginian, in the 1960s. He appeared in six episodes of Michael Landon's Little House on the Prairie as farmer Judd Larrabee, and appeared in all-star TV miniseries, such as Rich Man, Poor Man Book II and The Dream Merchants. In addition to acting, Barry was also a writer, writing the stories upon which the films Red Light (1949) starring George Raft and Virginia Mayo, Train to Tombstone (1950), and Convict Stage (1965) were based, and co-writing the screenplay as well as directing and playing the leading role of Jesse James in Jesse James' Women (1954). Prior to acting, Barry had been a high school and college football player. During the height of his Red Ryder fame, he married B-movie actress Peggy Stewart, they divorced in 1944. On July 17, 1980, Barry died by suicide after a domestic dispute. He was estranged from his second wife, Barbara at the time—with whom he had two daughters. He is interred at Forest Lawn Memorial Park in the Hollywood Hills of Los Angeles."

He attended the common schools and engaged in fur trading in 1818 near what is now Council Bluffs, Iowa. He later engaged in agricultural pursuits in Jefferson County. Meriwether studied law, was admitted to the bar, and commenced practice. He was a member of the Kentucky House of Representatives from 1832 to 1845. He was an unsuccessful candidate for election in 1847 to the Thirtieth Congress. He was a delegate to the state constitutional convention in 1849, and was Secretary of State of Kentucky in 1851. Meriwether was appointed as a Democrat to the United States Senate to fill the vacancy caused by the death of Henry Clay, and served from July 6, 1852 to August 31, 1852, when Archibald Dixon was elected his successor. He was not a candidate for renomination in 1852. He was appointed by President Franklin Pierce as Governor of the Territory of New Mexico, after the position was turned down by Solon Borland, from 1853 to 1855. He later served again in the Kentucky House of Representatives from 1858 to 1885, and served as speaker in 1859. After this he retired to his plantation near Louisville, Kentucky.

It was performed at the Stratford Festival of Canada and was aired, in part, on the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation and the Bravo Channel. Needles' childhood was divided between Toronto and his family's farm at Rosemont, Ontario. While working as editor for a local newspaper in Shelburne, he created the character of Walt Wingfield, a retired stockbroker turned farmer who told about his adventures on the farm in weekly letters to the editor. In 1985, Needles launched the series with 'Letter From Wingfield Farm' performed by actor Rod Beattie. Six sequels followed, including Wingfield's Progress (1987), Wingfield's Folly (1990), Wingfield Unbound (1997), Wingfield on Ice (2001), Wingfield's Inferno (2005), and Wingfield: Lost and Found (2009). Needles currently writes columns for Country Guide Magazine and Small Farm Canada. His book With Axe and Flask, The History of Persephone Township from Pre-Cambrian Times to the Present was the winner of the 2003 Stephen Leacock Memorial Medal for Humour. His most recent book is a collection of the first through seventh Wingfield plays entitled Wingfield's World. Letters From Wingfield Farm and Wingfield's Hope contain the first through third and fourth through sixth plays, respectively. Needles' other plays include The Perils of Persephone, Ed's Garage and The Last Christmas Turkey. On December 26, 2014, Dan Needles was appointed a Member of the Order of Canada by David Johnston, Governor General of Canada, for \"celebrating our rural communities as the playwright of the much-loved Wingfield Farm series, and for championing the dramatic arts outside of Canada’s major centres.\""

  "text" : "David T. Prosser Jr. (born December 24, 1942) is an American jurist and Wisconsin politician who served on the Wisconsin Supreme Court from 1998 to 2016. A former Republican speaker of the Wisconsin Assembly, Prosser was appointed to the court by Governor Tommy Thompson in 1998, and was elected to his first 10-year term without opposition in 2001. He ran for reelection in April 2011 against little-known Wisconsin assistant attorney general, Joanne Kloppenburg. The race received national attention and was viewed as a referendum on efforts by Republican Governor Scott Walker and the Republican-controlled legislature to curb the union rights of public workers in Wisconsin. The April 5, 2011 election was too close to call until two days later when the Waukesha County Clerk announced she had erroneously omitted more than 14,000 votes from her earlier tally. The additional votes gave Prosser a lead of over 7,000 which was sustained by a later recount. Prosser received media attention in 2010 following verbal altercations with the chief justice of the Wisconsin Supreme Court, and also in June 2011 when allegations were made of a physical altercation between Prosser and a fellow associate justice that occurred in connection with the union-curbing bill. A special prosecutor investigated but declined to press criminal charges. An ethics action against Prosser was recommended by the Wisconsin Judicial Commission, however, after three other justices recused themselves from the matter, no further action was taken. Following his graduation from University of Wisconsin Law School, Prosser worked in Washington as an attorney at the U.S. Department of Justice and as an aide to U. S. Representative Harold Vernon Froehlich. Returning to Wisconsin, he began a private practice, worked as a district attorney for two years, then served 18 years as a Republican party legislator in the Wisconsin State Assembly. He was the state house minority leader for six of those years and assembly speaker for two years. After an unsuccessful bid for the U.S. House in 1996, Prosser was appointed by Wisconsin Governor Tommy Thompson to a vacant seat on the state tax appeals board, then in 1998 to a vacant seat on Wisconsin Supreme Court."

  "text" : "Douglas Dunlop was a Scottish teacher and missionary who, during the British occupation of Egypt (1888–1922), controversially created what became known as the 'Dunlop-system' in Egyptian education. He was widely seen as an opponent of Egyptian nationalist aspirations in education. From 1882-1922, Egypt was under British military occupation, and her government heavily under the influence (control) of the British Empire. The first Consul-General, Sir Evelyn Baring (later 1st Earl of Cromer), appointed Dunlop as British 'consultant' to the Egyptian ministry of education. Dunlop was suggested for this task by Cromer's former tennis partner. Dunlop and the British had two concerns. Firstly, they were concerned with the debt-ridden Egyptian economy, and secondly with creating a suitable (and compliant) educated governing class and civil service, modelled on their experiences in British India. The education policy of the Egyptian government prior to the occupation had been to create a meritocratic system. Dunlop, on the other hand, oversaw the creation of an elitist two-tier system, with fees introduced for the elite schools. Modernisation also occurred, with elemental schooling being both centralised and expanded. Prior to the British occupation, the administrative languages of Egypt had been French and Turkish. With British influence, English became the preferred language. This brought increasing controversy, as Egyptian nationalists sought to reassert Arabic. Dunlop, even after thirty years in Egypt, like Cromer, did not speak Arabic. He primarily promoted teaching in English, preferring to employ British teachers and attempting to marginalise teaching in Arabic and French. In 1907, Saad Zaghlul (later revolutionary leader and post-independence prime minister) became minister of education. Zaghul strongly promoted Arabic in education, and necessarily locking horns with his British advisor. Dunlop became a figure associated with British resistance to Egyptian anti-colonialism. Dunlop quit his post during the Egyptian revolution of 1919."

He attended the Todd School for Boys (from which Orson Welles had graduated in 1931) from 1935 to 1937, and Lake Forest Academy during 1937-1940. He then spent a year at the Goodman Memorial Theatre Drama Department of the Art Institute of Chicago. During this time, he also directed a feature-length 16 mm version of Peer Gynt with 17-year-old Charlton Heston in the title role. His studies at Northwestern University were interrupted by three years’ service in the U.S. Army Signal Corps during World War II. He graduated in 1950 with Bachelor of Science degree from the university’s School of Speech. On the basis of the 16 mm feature Julius Caesar that he had produced and directed in Chicago (and which also starred Charlton Heston), he was hired as a directing intern by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer in 1950. After the teen drama Dragstrip Riot (1958), he went on to direct Madmen of Mandoras, padded for television into the infamous They Saved Hitler's Brain, which proved to be his final output. Bradley later taught film studies at UCLA and Santa Monica City College."

  "text" : "Don Willis (May 1, 1909 – March 2, 1984) was a colorful pool hustler from Canton, Ohio who often traveled with pool champion Luther Lassiter. In the late 1940s and 1950s, when pool was in decline and cash prizes for pool tournaments did not pay enough for a full-time income, Willis chose to travel America playing private pool games for money. According to R.A. Dyer, Willis befriended Luther Lassiter in 1948 after beating Lassiter at 9-ball. Lassiter, who went on to win 18 world championships, was perhaps America’s best 9-ball player; together, the two men formed “arguably the most formidable road team in American history.” As Willis told the Evansville Courier & Press in 1977, “I broke Lassiter one night playing 9-ball in Elizabeth City, North Carolina. He suggested that we become road partners…We split everything we made—sometimes as much as $5000 or $10,000 over a period of several days.” When hustling with Lassiter, Willis often went first, playing the lemon to set up a victim for Lassiter, who would then finish the opponent. In addition to pool, Willis played the game of ping pong so well he could win games playing with a bottle as a paddle. He also mastered a variety of other unusual skills on which he was known to gamble: for example, he could make as many as 42 wing shots in a row, beat anyone in a race running backwards, and juggle 3 pool balls along with the chalk. Willis boasted that he had even won bets “on the proposition that I can’t name in order the hundred and thirty largest cities in the U.S.” He threw 48 of 50 ringers against the Horse Shoe Champion. He was also a basketball free throw hustler and a card player. Although Willis “never won a major tournament…most of the greats acknowledged gambling losses to the Ohio-born hustler.” Willis very likely could have won tournaments had he chosen to compete, but like many hustlers, he knew he could make more money hustling if he remained unknown. To quote R. A. Dyer, “he feared not defeat…but rather exposure. He wanted no pictures in the paper.” Because Willis did not play in tournaments, his talent was never widely recognized beyond a close circle of friends and family. The little documentation available on Willis tends to mention him chiefly in connection with Luther Lassiter, who said of him, \"If I ever had to have someone else shoot pool for my life, win or lose, live or die, the man that I'd have shooting for me is Don Willis.\""

He was nominated, on 21 January 1930, Prime Minister of Portugal (President of the Council of Ministers) during the period of the Ditadura Nacional (National Dictatorship) that preceded the Estado Novo (New State). A conservative, he opposed all the attempts to restore democracy, like the failed military uprising of April and May 1931 in Madeira and the Azores Islands. The popularity and political role demonstrated by the Finance Minister, António de Oliveira Salazar, led him to resign on 25 June 1932, to be replaced by Salazar, who would retain the post for the following 36 years."

  "text" : "David Mark Berger (May 24, 1944 – September 6, 1972) was an Israeli Olympic weightlifter, and one of the eleven Israeli Olympians taken hostage and killed by the Palestinian group Black September during the Munich massacre at the 1972 Summer Olympics. Born and raised in the United States, Berger was a lawyer by education and had emigrated to Israel after taking part in the 1969 Maccabiah Games. Berger was born in Cleveland, Ohio to wealthy parents. A noted student-athlete, Berger graduated from Shaker Heights High School in 1962. He attended Tulane University from 1962 to 1966 where he was an honor student and a weightlifter. While a junior at Tulane, he won the NCAA weightlifting title in the 148-pound class. Berger earned a bachelor's degree in psychology from Tulane in 1966. He earned a master's degree in business administration and a doctor of laws degree from Columbia University (both in 1969). In addition to working toward his degrees, Berger was able to devote time to weightlifting, competing as a light-heavyweight. His father, Benjamin, was once quoted as saying, “I used to tell him ‘You may not be the best weightlifter in the world, but you’re certainly the smartest!’” After winning a gold medal in the middleweight weight-lifting contest in the 1969 Maccabiah Games, Berger emigrated to Israel, intending to open a law office in Tel Aviv after completing his compulsory military service. He met and became engaged to an Israeli student. Continuing his weightlifting competitions, he won a silver medal at the 1971 Asian Weightlifting Championships, and made the 1972 Israeli Olympic team. In late August of that year, Berger flew to Munich with his teammates. On September 2, 1972, Berger competed, but was eliminated in an early round. He died in the Munich massacre four days later."

Harvard psychologist Steven Pinker describes Symons' The Evolution of Human Sexuality (1979) as a \"groundbreaking book\" and \"a landmark in its synthesis of evolutionary biology, anthropology, physiology, psychology, fiction, and cultural analysis, written with a combination of rigor and wit. It was a model for all subsequent books that apply evolution to human affairs, particularly mine.\" Symons is Professor Emeritus in the Department of Anthropology at the University of California, Santa Barbara. His most recent work, with Catherine Salmon, is Warrior Lovers, an evolutionary analysis of slash fiction."

  "text" : "Donald Ray Lash (August 15, 1912 - September 19, 1994) was an American long-distance runner who won 12 national titles from 1934 to 1940, including seven consecutive men's national cross-country championships, and who set a world's record for the two-mile run in 1936. Born in Bluffton, Indiana, Lash grew up in Auburn, Indiana, where he graduated from high school in 1933 after setting a new Indiana state record of 4:30.5 for the indoor mile. As a student at Indiana University, Lash set an American record of 31:06.9 for 10,000 meters. In June 1936, he broke Paavo Nurmi's world record for the two mile, running 8:58.4, besting Nurmi's record by 1.2 seconds. Competing in the 1936 Summer Olympics, he placed 13th in the 5,000-meter run and eighth in the 10,000-meter. In 1938, Lash set a meet record of 14 min., 39 sec., for 5,000 meters at the Amateur Athletic Union indoor national championships. That same year he won the James E. Sullivan Award as the nation's top amateur athlete. Lash attributed his endurance to his unusual ability to store oxygen in his system. Speaking to a meeting in Auburn in 1937, Lash said that he knew when he would win a race by having a blood count before running. World War II precluded any further chance for Lash to compete in the Olympics. Having married Margaret Mendenhall in 1938, Lash began a law-enforcement career with the Indiana State Police, then became an agent with the Federal Bureau of Investigation in 1941. He retired from the FBI in 1962 to become a regional director of the Fellowship of Christian Athletes and appeared frequently as a motivational speaker. In 1973, he opened a real estate business in Rockville, Indiana. He also was elected to five terms (1973–1982) as a Republican member of the Indiana State House of Representatives, serving Fountain, Montgomery and Parke counties. Lash died of spinal cancer at a hospital in Terre Haute, Indiana, and is buried in Rush Creek Cemetery near Tangier in Parke County. Don and Margaret Lash had two sons and a daughter. Don Lash Park in Auburn is named for him. Lash was inducted into the USA Track and Field Hall of Fame in 1995. Lash's autobiography, The Iron Man from Indiana: the Don Lash Story, was published in 1999."

In 2003 he published an autobiographical book, Family Secrets, which recounts how in 1917 his father shot his mother's lover dead, but was found not guilty of murder."

She also ranks among the top ten actresses in mother roles in Hindi cinema, most notable among them were as Jodhabai in K. Asif's Mughal-e-Azam (1960), as Kaikeyi in Vijay Bhatt's classic, Bharat Milap (1942); her other memorable roles as mother were in Charnon Ki Dasi (1941), Mirza Ghalib,  Bobby (1973) and Bidaai (1974).

  "text" : "David Halliday Moffat (July 22, 1839 – March 18, 1911) was an American financier and industrialist. Moffat was one of Denver's most important financiers and industrialists in late 19th and early 20th century Colorado, and he was responsible for the development of the Middle Park area. He served as president, treasurer and as a board member of railroads, banks and city government posts. Over the years he had claims to over one hundred Colorado mines and nine railroads. Moffat died on March 18, 1911 in New York City at the age of seventy three. Some had said that he had vainly spent fourteen million dollars on the dream of a railroad directly west from Denver. The Denver, Northwestern & Pacific Railway had cost him $75,000 a mile, and Rollins Pass had cost him the rest of his fortune. He was in New York city trying to raise more money, and was stopped by what would later be learned was the doing of E. H. Harriman and George Jay Gould I. He was one of the greatest threats they had faced in years. Although Moffat was looked at the time as a vain dreamer, he would later be viewed by many as ahead of his time. His legacy would leave Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad and later Union Pacific Railroad with a railroad that would outlast most other rail lines in Colorado. He would have Moffat Tunnel and Moffat County, Colorado named after him."

  "text" : "David Josef Bach (Lemberg (now Lviv), Ukraine, August 13, 1874 – London, UK, January 30, 1947) was an important and influential figure in the cultural life of early twentieth-century Vienna. As a boy, Bach was a close friend of the young Arnold Schoenberg, who later named him as one of the three friends (the other two were Oskar Adler and Alexander von Zemlinsky) who greatly influenced him in his youthful explorations of music and literature. Describing him as \"A linguist, a philosopher, a connoisseur of literature, and a mathematician\" as well as \"a good musician\", Schoenberg paid tribute to his friend by claiming that it was D.J. Bach who furnished his character with \"the ethical and moral power needed to withstand vulgarity and commonplace popularity\" ('My Evolution', 1949). After studying Natural Sciences at the University of Vienna, where he was influenced by Ernst Mach, D.J. Bach became a journalist, being appointed as music critic of the Arbeiter-Zeitung ('Worker's Newspaper') in 1904 after the death of Josef Scheu (1841–1904). As a loyal supporter of Schoenberg and of the slightly older Gustav Mahler he supported contemporary music in a city where performances of 'modern' works would sometimes be disrupted by noisy protests. An active socialist dedicated to making the arts accessible to the working classes, it was D.J. Bach who instituted the Arbeiter-Symphonie-Konzerte ('Workers' Symphony Concerts') in Vienna in 1905. His wide-ranging activities earned him the hostility of right-wing groups, who denounced his artistic programme as part of a 'Jewish conspiracy' to undermine traditional Austrian culture. Such accusations were all the more vehement because D.J. Bach was also one of the earliest members of the Vienna Psychoanalytical Association which met under the aegis of Sigmund Freud and whose members were mostly Jewish. D.J. Bach was made editor-in-chief of the literature and art section of the Arbeiter-Zeitung in 1917. Once the Social Democratic Party came to power in 1919, however, he became highly influential politically. Immediately appointed Director of the Sozialdemokratische Kunststelle ('Social-Democratic Arts Council'), he was able to develop a dynamic programme of cultural events as an integral part of the programme of socialist reconstruction in so-called 'Red Vienna'. He organized readings for the workers of Vienna by the satirist Karl Kraus; in 1933, commissioned a painting by Oskar Kokoschka of the Wilhelminenberg Kinderheim, with its panoramic view of the City of Vienna; and invited the avant-garde stage designer Frederick Kiesler to construct a full-sized experimental stage – the ‘Raumbühne’ – in the Konzerthaus. The organization of the Theatre and Music Festival of the City of Vienna in 1924 was one of the high points of his career. But he also – year in, year out – made major musical and theatrical productions available to working-class audiences through a system of subsidized block bookings. In order to help the Workers to be better prepared for the Concerts, Operas or Plays they were planning to attend, from 1926 to 1931, the 'Kunststelle' issued a monthly Arts' magazine, 'Kunst und Volk', in which distinguished contributors from all around Europe discussed not only the artistic events in question, but also a broad range of historical, political and social matters. Music was, and remained, his central focus, and it was he who founded the amateur Vienna Singverein ('Vienna Choral Society') in 1919. This organisation, together with the Arbeiter-Symphonie-Konzerte and the 'Workers' Music Conservatoire', flourished until all were disbanded upon the new fascist government's outlawing of the Social Democratic Party and imposition of an authoritarian constitution in 1934. Anton Webern was active as a conductor of all musical organisations, and developed a close and enduring friendship with D.J. Bach: it was Bach who delivered the address which opened the concert of Webern's music given on 3 December 1933 to celebrate the composer's fiftieth birthday, and Bach who persuaded Webern not to resign from his position as president of the Vienna International Society for Contemporary Music (ISCM) chapter when his projected performance of Alban Berg's opera Wozzeck in Florence in 1934 was cancelled for political reasons. D.J. Bach can be said to have held a unique position in the cultural politics of Vienna. In a situation of increasing polarization between 'Right' and 'Left', he attempted to create a cultural consensus by including conservatives like Hofmannsthal and Kralik in his system of patronage, as well as radicals like Ernst Fischer (writer) and Alban Berg. The esteem in which he was held by the Viennese cultural community is reflected in the collection of eighty-eight large-format literary, artistic and musical dedications in a \"Kassette\" presented to him in August 1924 on the occasion of his fiftieth birthday. This collection, now in the care of Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, includes original artistic works of considerable value and forms a unique 'time capsule' of Viennese cultural life. In 1939 David Bach, his wife Gisela and nephew Herbert, emigrated to London. In England he became a leading member of the Austrian Labour Club and President of the Union of Austrian Journalists. He continued to organize musical events, particularly concerts of chamber music, supported by members of the future Amadeus Quartet. Bach died in London in 1947."

  "text" : "Davey Ray Moor is an England-based songwriter, singer, multi-instrumentalist, composer and producer. Moor was born in Beirut and raised in Australia, and now lives in England. He first came to musical prominence in Sydney as keyboard player, and occasional vocalist, for an independent rock outfit The Crystal Set and psychedelic band The Church (see Remote Luxury and Persia). After recording four singles and one album (which featured the Moor penned \"Flat Earth\") with The Crystal Set, Moor left both the band and Australia for the United Kingdom where he began working at The Beatmasters' studio as a composer. Moor later established a recording studio near Glastonbury where, for the next decade, he composed soundtracks for television, film, advertising and documentaries. In 1998, with partners Robin Brown and Zennor Alexander, Moor contributed the soundtrack to the BAFTA-winning Best Documentary for a Channel 4 \"Dispatches\" film. Other prizes included Best Short for an MTV ident at the New York Film Festival in 1993. Clients across this period include Pepsi, Budweiser, Bacardi, Nintendo, Nissan, Remington, the BBC, Channel 4, ITV, MTV, VH-1 and Sky. All the while Moor continued to dabble in original music, eventually writing all the songs that were to become the launchpad for Cousteau. Toward the end of the nineties, Moor recruited Cousteau and the band recorded a collection of his songs. In 2001, Chris Blackwell's Palm Pictures released the recordings as a self-titled album. With baritone Liam McKahey singing all but two of the songs (Moor leads the vocals on the others), Cousteau's lounge-set sound was presented with the perfect raft upon which Moor's romantic sound could float. The band received both enthusiastic reviews (Single of the Week, The Times, Album of The Week, The Guardian, 5-stars, Uncut) and sales throughout the United Kingdom and Europe and met with substantial success in the United States. Capturing the allure of its predecessor, a second album Sirena replicated its critical and substantial commercial success yet Moor departed the band prior to their third American tour. Instead he chose to work as a producer on Italian singer Cristina Donà's album, which achieved critical acclaim and went to No. 4 on the Italian Charts. In 2004, with the assistance of vocalists Sergio Cocchi, Darion Marshall, Christina Dona and Debbie Sanders, Moor released his first true solo endeavour \"Telepathy\" on NuN/Edel in Europe. 4 and 5 star reviews across publications such as Rolling Stone Magazine and All Music followed, and Telepathy was included in Musica's Critics Top 100 in 2004 - one of two albums that Moor wrote and produced - the other being Cristina Donà's debut album in English. In 2005 Telepathy was released by Lakeshore Records throughout the US. Critical reaction was again enthusiastic, some describing the album as the best work of his career. Moor co-wrote Run With the Boys, Carve My Name, Shadows Fall, Death Fires and This Is The Song on Carl Barat's (ex of the Libertines and Dirty Pretty Things) eponymous solo album, which was released in 2010."

  "text" : "Dean Everett Wooldridge (May 30, 1913 in Chickasha, Oklahoma – September 20, 2006 in Santa Barbara, California) was a prominent engineer in the aerospace industry. Something of a prodigy, Wooldridge graduated from high school at age of 14. He received his bachelor's and master's degree from the University of Oklahoma. Like his future colleague Simon Ramo, Wooldridge went on to study at the California Institute of Technology under William Smythe, from which he received his PhD in physics (summa cum laude) in 1936, studying the separation of isotopes. After leaving Caltech, Wooldridge moved first to Bell Laboratories, where he worked on the theory of magnetism. In 1946, he and Simon Ramo (his classmate at Caltech) both became director of research for the electronics department of Hughes Aircraft, and his career became coupled with that of Simon Ramo. Together they formed an incredibly successful team for many years, with Wooldridge concentrating on investment and general business aspects while Ramo led research, development and engineering efforts. By 1948, Hughes had created its Aerospace Group to work with the also newly created U.S. Air Force. Ramo and Wooldridge were particularly concerned when Howard Hughes avoided their attempts to discuss the problem. In September 1953 they jointly resigned, and within a week they formed the Ramo-Wooldridge Corporation on September 16, 1953. In 1958, Ramo-Wooldridge merged with Thompson Products to form TRW, which carried on the success of its predecessor. It handled system engineering and technical direction for numerous Air Force projects. Wooldridge served as president of TRW until he retired in 1962. He returned to Caltech as a research associate and published several books about the physical processes underlying biology and intelligence, winning the AAAS-Westinghouse award for science writing in 1963. He was a member of the National Academy of Sciences. He died of pneumonia on September 20, 2006 in Santa Barbara, California."

He will continue working with Ferrari in 2007. In 2005, while driving for the BMW Southard Motorsports team, he won the Grand-Am Daytona Prototype Sportsman of the Year Award. Grala has been a Daytona Prototype driver since the class debuted in the 2003 Rolex 24 Hours of Daytona. In that first race he ran in the top five through most of the night until a mechanical failure in the fifteenth-hour took him out of the race while running in second place overall. On June 22, 2003 Grala had his first podium finish in a Daytona Prototype at his home track in Watkins Glen, New York. Prior to the introduction of the Daytona Prototype class, Grala competed in the Grand-Am GTS class. He got his first Rolex Series win in the GTS Class, also at Watkins Glen International. Before racing in the Rolex Series, Grala competed in the Ferrari Challenge. The three-year effort netted multiple wins and pole positions, and culminated with Grala being crowned the 2002 North American Champion. His son, Kaz Grala, races part-time in the NASCAR Camping World Truck Series."

  "text" : "David E. Shanahan (September 7, 1862–October 18, 1936), Illinois Republican state legislator and political leader, was born on a farm in Lee County, Illinois. His parents moved back to Chicago when he was just three months old and he lived there for the rest of his life. Mr. Shanahan graduated from Holden Grammar School, South Division High School, and Chicago Law College. In 1885 he was elected South Town Supervisor. In 1915 he was a member of the Illinois Commission to the Panama-Pacific Exposition at San Francisco. He served on the State Council of Defense during World War I and the Illinois Commission for A Century of Progress Exposition 1933–1934. In 1919 he was elected to the Illinois Constitutional Convention. He was a member of the Chicago Real Estate Board, the Union League Club, and numerous civic organizations. Mr. Shanahan was first elected to the Illinois House of Representatives in 1894 from the Bridgeport neighborhood on Chicago's South Side and was re-elected every two years until his last election in 1934. He was serving in office when he died in 1936. He served several different terms as Speaker of the House including 1915–1921, 1923–1925, and 1929–1933. Rep. Shanahan's death in 1936 came just a few weeks before the general election with his name still on the ballot. Because the maximum of two Democrats had already been nominated from Bridgeport for the 1936 election, a third Democrat, future Mayor Richard J. Daley, ran for and was elected to the late Rep. Shanahan's seat technically on the Republican line. But Daley immediately joined the House Democratic Caucus upon his taking office in Springfield in January 1937. Rep. Shanahan was a real estate investor whose estate topped one million dollars in 1936, a large sum for the Depression era. There was an extensive battle in court for the estate when his will was contested and it was discovered that he had a \"secret marriage\" late in his life to one of his secretaries.

  "text" : "John Favara (March 4, 1929 – July 28, 1980) was the backyard neighbor of Gambino crime family godfather John Gotti, in Howard Beach, New York. On March 18, 1980, 12-year-old Frank Gotti, the youngest son of John Gotti, darted into the street on a motorized minibike from behind a dumpster where he was struck by John Favara's car and killed. Favara, 51, who lived a block behind the Gotti family, worked as a service department manager for a furniture store, Castro Convertibles in New Hyde Park, New York. He had been on his way home from work. His adopted son, Scott, was a friend of the Gotti children and had been their guest for sleepovers. He was a close childhood friend of the son of Gambino crime family caporegime Ettore Zappi, himself a distant cousin of crime family patriarch Carlo Gambino. While Ettore pursued a life in organized crime, Favara remained in the legitimate world, but the two remained close. No charges were ever filed against him. However, in the months after the accident, the word \"Murderer\" was spray-painted onto Favara's car. On May 28, Victoria Gotti, Frank's mother, attacked Favara with a metal baseball bat, nearly missing him with each swing. Favara decided not to press charges and planned to move out of Howard Beach. According to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), on July 28, 1980, before Favara and his family were able to move, he was shoved into a van by several men near his work. There were several witnesses to the abduction, and accounts ranged from him being beaten with a baseball bat, shot with a silenced .22 caliber pistol, or both. Accounts differ on what happened to Favara's body. One account says that while alive he was dismembered with a chainsaw and stuffed into a barrel filled with concrete and dumped in the ocean or buried on the chop shop lot somewhere.Favara's wife and two sons moved out of Howard Beach, having John declared legally dead in 1983. In November 2004, informants led the FBI to excavate a parking lot in New York City suspected to be a mob graveyard and the site of Favara's body. While two bodies were found, Favara's was not. When questioned by two detectives on Favara's disappearance, John Gotti said: \"I'm not sorry the guy's missing. I wouldn't be sorry if the guy turned up dead.\" His wife Victoria, when questioned said: \"I don't know what happened to him, but I'm not disappointed he's missing. He killed my boy.\" Previously prosecutors believed Favara's remains were stuffed in a barrel of concrete and tossed off a Sheepshead Bay pier, but Brooklyn federal court papers filed by federal prosecutors the week of January 5, 2009, contain allegations that mob hitman Charles Carneglia killed Favara and disposed of his body in acid."

  "text" : "Darrell Cornell was Northrop's chief test pilot in the early 1980s. He was killed on October 10, 1984 at Suwon Air Base, while performing a demonstration flight for the South Korean Air Force (ROKAF). The F-20, 82-0062, c/n GG1001, N4416T, he was piloting stalled after a series of climbing rolls performed with flaps and gear extended. Cornell was not able to recover the aircraft from the uncontrolled stall. Cornell was also the lead test pilot for Northrop's RF-5E Tigereye, a reconnaissance version of the low cost F-5E fighter aircraft. He was featured in the April 1984 issue of LIFE magazine in an article entitled Edwards Air Force Base Pilots together with Doug Benefieds, Chuck Sewell, Tony LeVier, and Russell O’Quinn. Cornell was also an astronaut candidate with NASA in 1963, although he was not selected to join Group 3. His display performances flying the F-20 in Paris, France (Le Bourget 1983) and Farnborough, England in 1984 are remembered by many as some of the finest ever performed at these airshows."

  "text" : "M. Dale Kinkade (1933–2004) was a linguist known especially for his work on Salishan languages. Born July 18, 1933, in Hartline, Washington, he graduated from Peshastin High School in 1950. He received his B.A. from the University of Washington in 1955 and his M.A. in 1957. He then moved to Indiana University, where he received his Ph.D. in 1963. After serving for three years in the United States Army, he taught at Washington State College from 1961 to 1964, and the University of Kansas from 1964 to 1973 before moving to the University of British Columbia where he remained until his retirement in 1998 as Distinguished Professor of Linguistics. Kinkade served for many years as a trustee of the Jacobs Fund of the Whatcom Museum Foundation, which supports fieldwork on Pacific Northwest languages and cultures and was one of the founders of the annual International Conference on Salishan and Neighboring Languages in 1966. He continued to work after his retirement; his last major work was his Cowlitz dictionary and grammatical sketch published in 2004. Kinkade was known for his insightful and in-depth research on all aspects of Salishan languages. Between 1960 and 1976 he conducted extensive fieldwork on several severely endangered languages. His own fieldwork together with his mastery of the literature made him the undisputed dean of Salishan linguistics. His contributions include dictionaries of three Salishan languages: Moses Columbia (1981), Upper Chehalis (1991), and Cowlitz (2004); over one hundred papers; several contributions to the Handbook of North American Indians (Volumes 7, 12, and 17); and several encyclopaedia and other general articles. As befits a specialist in a group of languages renowned for their phonetic difficulty Kinkade had a reputation as a master practical phonetician. Kinkade had a great, though dry, sense of humor and was generous with his time and extensive knowledge. He had a deep interest in classical music, especially opera, and was a strong supporter of the Seattle Opera. He was also an avid baseball fan and sometimes combined this interest with opera by listening to an opera while watching a baseball game. Although he lived and worked in Canada for more than 30 years he never became a Canadian citizen. Shortly before his death on December 19, 2004 from a brain tumor he was honored by the presentation of a Festschrift Studies in Salish linguistics in honor of M. Dale Kinkade."

  "text" : "Denis McLoughlin (15 April 1918 – 22 April 2002) was a well-known British illustrator. After a career that spanned eight decades, British illustrator Denis McLoughlin gained a degree of long overdue recognition in the late-1990s for his hard-boiled detective illustrations that graced book covers produced primarily for the London publishing house of T.V. Boardman, Ltd. (Boardman Books). It is this work, no doubt, with which McLoughlin will always be most strongly associated. Bio-bibliographer David Ashford claims for McLoughlin, \"In the history of British Illustration there is no one who can be reasonably compared to him. He does not fit anywhere into the British tradition.\" Ashford concludes that when it comes to hard-boiled illustration, McLoughlin is simply the best. Despite having produced over a hundred paperback covers, about 550 monthly Bloodhound Detective dust jacket illustrations, \"scores\" of Bloodhound Detective Story Magazine and other pulp magazine covers, and over a hundred other book covers, it is for his work in British comic books that Denis McLoughlin is best known. However, it would be impossible to consider the biography of Denis McLoughlin without touching the history of the Boardman publishing house at the same time."

Fay, Richwhite & Company was the prime focus of the \"Winebox Inquiry\" which dealt with, among other things, tax-avoidance arrangements in the Cook Islands.

  "text" : "David Bradley (November 8, 1811 – February 19, 1899) was a \"Pioneer Plowman\". David Bradley was born in Groton, New York on November 8, 1811. After working with his brother, C. C. Bradley, for several years in Syracuse, he relocated to Chicago in 1835. Initially he was in the employ of Jones, King & Co. and helped to build the first foundry in Chicago, known as the \"Chicago Furnace\". From the late 1830s until the 1850s David Bradley farmed in Lake County, Illinois, made bricks, and later farm machinery, in Racine, Wisconsin, and was a lumberman in Michigan. In 1854, he returned to Chicago and purchased a plow company from his brother in law. Later that year he partnered with Conrad Furst to create the firm of Furst and Bradley. Furst and Bradley eventually grew to occupy an entire city block at Fulton and Desplaines Streets in Chicago. In 1884 David Bradley and his sons purchased Furst's share of the business, and the company was renamed the \"David Bradley Manufacturing Company\". In 1895 the company was relocated to North Kankakee (about 50 miles south of Chicago), which was later renamed \"Bradley, Illinois\" in honor of the man and the company. In 1910, the Bradley family sold the factory to Sears, Roebuck and Co., at which time it was renamed the \"David Bradley Manufacturing Works\". The name was subsequently changed to David Bradley Manufacturing Company and in 1958 the company introduced the Garden Riding Tractor and David Bradley became the largest manufacturer of garden riding tractors in the world. Sears also owned the Newark Ohio Company and in 1962 David Bradley Manufacturing Company and the Newark Ohio Company were merged into a single unit under the name Newark Ohio Company. The new company manufactured power lawn mowers, among other products. In 1964 another merger took place and the Newark Ohio Company was merged into the Geo. D. Roper Corporation with the plant in Newark, Ohio continuing to manufacture outdoor power equipment including riding and single power lawn mowers."

Benjamin Franklin proposed to Deborah Read in 1724 when he was eighteen years old, but her mother would not consent to the marriage, citing Franklin's pending trip to England and financial instability. While Franklin was away in England, having been stranded there by Sir William Keith's failure to follow through on promises of support, Read married John Rogers, who fled soon after. Because of this, Benjamin and Deborah were not free to marry formally. John Rogers disappeared into history, after spending Deborah's dowry, incurring much debt, and using the marriage to further his own schemes. Franklin states that Rogers died in the West Indies. When Ben returned, he and Deborah began a common-law marriage in 1730. They had two children together: Francis Folger Franklin (October 20, 1732 - November 21, 1736), who died of smallpox at age four, and Sarah Franklin Bache (September 11, 1743 – October 5, 1808), called Sally. Together they also raised William Franklin (~1730 - November 17, 1814), Franklin's illegitimate son and later Colonial Governor of New Jersey. Benjamin Franklin did not leave London to visit Deborah even after she wrote to him in November 1769 saying her illness was due to “dissatisfied distress” because of his prolonged absence. She did not accompany him on his frequent trips to Europe due to a fear of travel over the sea. In spite of their separations, they remained loyal and supportive partners one to another for half a century. In the late 1760s and early 1770s, Deborah suffered a series of strokes that slurred her speech and memory. Deborah Read Franklin suffered a stroke on December 14, 1774, and died on December 19, 1774, while Benjamin was on an extended trip to England. She was buried at Christ Church Burial Ground in Philadelphia, and Benjamin Franklin was buried next to her after he died in 1790."

  "text" : "Drago Gervais (April 18, 1904, Opatija – July 3, 1957, Sežana) was a Croatian Istrian poet and playwright, and one of the most prominent poets writing in the Chakavian dialect of the Croatian language. Drago Gervais was born in 1904 in Opatija. His father Artur, a descendant of a French soldier in Napoleon's army, was a music teacher born in Severin na Kupi in the Gorski Kotar region of Croatia, then part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. His mother Klementina was from Opatija. In 1918 during the Italian annexation of Istria, he moved with his family to Bakar. In 1922 he graduated from high school in Sušak and attended Zagreb Law School. During his studies he started to collaborate with the Triestine magazine Naš Glas, in which his first two poems, Iz Improvizacija and Mi, were published. Soon after graduating he moved to Crikvenica where he worked at a local law firm. The next year he published his first collection of poems Čakavski stihovi. Later he worked in Bjelovar and Belgrade during the Second World War. In Belgrade he eventually worked for the Yugoslavian state news agency, Tanjug, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, but soon returned to Rijeka where he became the director of Rijeka's Croatian National Theater. He worked there until a car accident near Sežana suddenly took his life in 1957, at the age of 53."

  "text" : "Debbie McDonald (born August 27, 1954) is an American dressage rider who has competed in the Olympics and many international competitions. She now lives in Hailey, Idaho, with her husband Bob, a hunter/jumper and trainer. Debbie trains and teaches riders on Peggy and E. Parry Thomas's River Grove Farm in Sun Valley, Idaho. McDonald's first mount was a $800 pony. She agreed that she would pay for board if her parents bought it for her. Shortly thereafter Debbie managed to find a gaited horse trainer near her hometown who allowed her to groom horses and clean stalls in exchange for board. At age 14, when Debbie went to turn her pony out, she discovered a strange man in his stall, beating him. She went running for help and ran into a young trainer and her future husband, Bob McDonald, who ran a hunter/jumper farm and hired her as a stable hand. It was at this facility that she began her career. McDonald began her career in show jumping. However, she switched to dressage after a serious fall in which her horse somersaulted over her breaking ribs, rupturing her spleen, and fracturing a vertebra in her neck, She first met Parry and Peggy Thomas when she got a catch ride at a dressage show in Las Vegas on one of their horses whose rider was not available. The Thomases also became the owners of Brentina, a chestnut Hanoverian mare that became McDonald's primary mount. McDonald and her husband obtained the mare at an auction in Germany in 1994. Brentina, foaled in 1991, had a suitable temperament to respect McDonald, who is only five feet tall, and the team established a partnership that took them to the Olympics. McDonald and Brentina began by winning the Individual and Team Gold medals at the 1999 Pan American Games. In recognition of this accomplishment, McDonald was named the 1999 Equestrian of the Year by the United States Equestrian Federation and the United States Olympic Committee (USOC) Female Equestrian Athlete of the Year. In 2003, McDonald become the first American rider to win the Dressage World Cup, and the pair placed third at the 2005 World Cup. As members of the United States Equestrian Team they won a team silver and team bronze at the 2002 and 2006 World Equestrian Games. At the 2004 Athens Olympics, the pair won the team bronze and were individually fourth overall, and McDonald was dubbed \"First Lady of American Dressage.\" Brentina was named the 2005 Farnam/Platform USEF Horse of the Year. After the 2008 Olympics, where the mare had an uncharacteristically poor performance, she was retired to the Thomas' farm. While McDonald went on to compete with other horses, Brentina developed an impaction in early 2009 and underwent colic surgery to remove a fecalith from her small colon. She has since recovered and attended a retirement ceremony at the 2009 FEI World Cup Dressage Finals in Las Vegas. On January 22, 2010 McDonald was named the U.S. Equestrian Federation's Developing Dressage Coach, a role designed to identify and cultivate future US Dressage stars."

  "text" : "Daniel Harding (born 31 August 1975) is a British conductor. Harding was born in Oxford. He studied trumpet at Chetham's School of Music and was a member of the National Youth Orchestra at age 13. At age 17, Harding assembled a group of musicians to perform Pierrot Lunaire of Arnold Schoenberg, and sent a tape of the performance to Simon Rattle in Birmingham. After listening to this tape, Rattle hired Harding as an assistant to him at the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra for a year, from 1993-1994. Harding then attended the University of Cambridge, but after his first year at university, Claudio Abbado named him his assistant with the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra. Harding first conducted the Berlin Philharmonic at age 21. At the time of his first conducting appearance at The Proms in 1996, he was then the youngest-ever conductor to appear there. Harding has stated that he has never had formal conducting lessons. In 1997, Harding was the Music Director of the Ojai Music Festival alongside pianist Emanuel Ax. Harding has been music director of the Trondheim Symphony Orchestra (1997–2000), the Deutsche Kammerphilharmonie Bremen (1999–2003) and the Mahler Chamber Orchestra (2003-2008). Harding now has the title of conductor laureate with the Mahler Chamber Orchestra. He conducted the 2005 opening night at La Scala, Milan in Idomeneo, as a substitute after the resignation of Riccardo Muti earlier in 2005. In 2004, Harding was appointed principal guest conductor of the London Symphony Orchestra (LSO), as of 2006. One of his new projects with the LSO involves the 'Sound Adventures' program for new compositions. With the LSO, he has conducted a commercial recording of the opera Billy Budd for EMI Classics. He became the Principal Conductor of the Swedish Radio Symphony Orchestra in 2007. In September 2009, he extended his contract as the orchestra's principal conductor through 2012. In April 2013, the orchestra further announced the extension of Harding's contract to 2015. With the orchestra, he has recorded commercially for the Sony Classical label. From September 2010, Harding holds the title \"Music Partner of NJP (New Japan Philharmonic)\".  And from April 2012, Harding also holds the title of the Artistic Director of the Ohga Hall in Karuizawa, Japan.  In June 2015, the Orchestre de Paris announced the appointment of Harding as its 9th principal conductor, effective September 2016. Harding has two children, Adele and George, from his past marriage to Béatrice Muthelet, a violist and co-principal violist of the Mahler Chamber Orchestra. The marriage ended in divorce. Harding is a particular fan of the football club Manchester United."

  "text" : "Derrick Sherwin Bailey (30 June 1910 – 9 February 1984) was an English Christian theologian, born at Alcester in Warwickshire, whose 1955 work Homosexuality and the Western Christian Tradition paved the way for the production of the 1957 Wolfenden report and for the Parliament of the United Kingdom's decriminalization of homosexuality in England and Wales a decade later. \"Under the guidance of the Rev. Dr. Derrick Sherwin Bailey (1910-84), a group of clergy, doctors and lawyers studied the existing materials on homosexuality. They then produced a privately printed pamphlet titled The Problem of Homosexuality. This interim report, written by Bailey, signalled the first twentieth-century extended treatment of homosexuality by an ecclesiastical body. Not only did it examine the current medical, psychological, and sociological literature, but it also sought to address the role of the Church of England in the issue of reforming the law. The Moral Welfare Council recognized the role of the State in regulating society, but it also acknowledged that the rights of the homosexual were being violated, and this issue needed to be addressed.\"Bailey's writings helped the Church of England to respond to the theological issue of homosexuality, to homosexuals themselves, as well as to the laws of England. This 1954-5 period in the Moral Welfare Council provided important conceptual guidelines for subsequent discussions about homosexuality, not only in the Church of England but throughout Christendom.\" While working on the pamphlet, Bailey independently completed Homosexuality and the Western Christian Tradition. It was criticized for exonerating the Church for persecuting homosexuals, yet it is still considered a landmark work on this topic. He scrutinized both the Bible and subsequent thought, drawing focus to some heretofore ignored issues, such as intertestamental literature, legislation of Christian emperors, the penitentials, and the link between heresy and sodomy. Bailey testified to the Wolfenden Committee in support of the reform of the laws on homosexuality. The historian Patrick Higgins describes some of Bailey's other views an \"interesting cocktail of beliefs\". Higgins lists Bailey as believing that homosexuality will eventually disappear \"because he thought that modern people would create better marriages, which in turn would make better homes, producing children who would naturally follow the right sexual path\". He also proposed that homosexual men should be invited into the homes of married heterosexuals in order so that the heterosexuals could \"share some of their joy with them\". While he believes male homosexuality to be pitied rather than criminalised, Higgins reports that he had little sympathy with lesbians: he considered lesbianism \"socially more undesirable than male homosexuality\". In 1962 Bailey became a Canon Residentiary of Wells Cathedral, publishing works on its history and dying in the city of Wells, Somerset."

  "text" : "Drest was king of the Picts from 724 until 726. He succeeded Nechtan mac Der-Ilei when the latter abdicated and entered a monastery in 724. Neither the Annals of Ulster, nor the Annals of Tigernach, name Drest's father. The earlier versions of the Pictish Chronicle king lists simply name \"Drest and Elpin\" as kings after Nechtan. However, a late version, which includes Nechtan's second reign in 728–729, makes Drest's father one Talorgan. This version includes the otherwise unknown Carnach son of Ferach and Óengus son of Bridei, and is generally not such as would inspire great confidence. Since Nechtan abidicated in favour of Drest, some kinship between them seems probable. A number of Nechtan's sons are reported to have died, so that Drest, whether a nephew, a son-in-law or cousin may have been Nechtan's nearest male kin. It may be that Drest was the son of the Talorg son of Drostan, \"brother of Nechtan\" — a half-brother or, perhaps a foster-brother — who had been imprisoned in 713. Whatever his descent, Drest's rule appears to have been quickly challenged. In 725, Simul son of Drest was imprisoned, but by whom is unknown. In 726 Nechtan was imprisoned by Drest, following which Alpín, the Elpin of the king lists, deposed Drest. By 728 it appears that Drest, Nechtan, Alpín and Óengus mac Fergusa were engaged in a war for the Pictish throne. Drest was killed in battle against Óengus at Dromo Dergg Blathuug (possibly Drumderg, near Blairgowrie) in 729. Whether there is any relationship between this Drest and the Talorgan son of Drest, king of Atholl, who was killed by drowning in 739, can only be speculation. Drest, Talorgan and their variants are common Pictish names, too common for any argument on the basis of anthroponymy to be entirely convincing."

  "text" : "Dr. Don Shondell is the patriarch of one of the best known families in American volleyball. His career has been long and varied as a volleyball coach, author and program coordinator. He has a career record of 769-280-6 (.732), affording him the second highest number of wins in NCAA men's volleyball history, behind UCLA's Al Scates. Shondell graduated from Ball State University in 1952 and started Ball State's men's volleyball program in 1964. Shondell took a leave from the program in 1965 to complete a doctoral program at Indiana University. As head coach of Ball State's men's volleyball program, he won 20 Midwest Intercollegiate Volleyball Association (MIVA) titles in 34 seasons. In 1970, he led Ball State to the first NCAA Men's Volleyball Championship tournament. He later earned twelve more NCAA berths. Shondell was a co-founder of the MIVA, the organization's first president, and an eight-time MIVA coach of the year winner. He retired as head coach of Ball State in 1998 and was replaced by Joel Walton, a former player and assistant coach. After retirement Shondell began coaching the boys' volleyball team at Muncie Central High School in Muncie, Indiana. He also coaches youth volleyball in the Muncie, Indiana area. Shondell is the co-author and editor of the Volleyball Coaching Bible. Among his former players are Olympian Phil Eatherton and Walton. Shondell is the father of Dave Shondell, the present head women's volleyball coach at Purdue University, John Shondell, who is Dave's assistant at Purdue, and Steve Shondell, the former girls' volleyball coach at Muncie Burris High School where he accumulated over 1,000 wins. Steve has since moved on to take the head coaching position for the Ball State women's volleyball team. Don's daughter, Kim (Shondell) Fullove, works for the North Adams Community School district in Adams County, Indiana, where she has brought in millions of dollars to the district through countless grants. She has worked with other school districts to ensure that children's needs are met educationally. Shondell is also the grandfather of former Tennessee women's player and current Youngstown State assistant coach Jasmine Fullove, former Purdue women's player Lindsay Shondell, and current Rocky Valley College head coach Kyle Shondell. Shondell currently coaches for the eighth-grade volleyball team at Burris Laboratory School. Don's eighth-grade team in 2010 went 16-0 for the first time since 2006. In 2014 his eighth-grade team went undefeated in the regular season and participated in the first-ever Munciana Volleyball Club middle school state championship. The team finished third, suffering their first loss of the season. On December 15, 2010, Don's wife Betty died after fighting liver and pancreatic cancer. Her last words to her husband, three sons and daughter were \"I love you\"."

  "text" : "Dalhart Windberg (born 1933 in Goliad County, Texas) is an American painter known for his masterful use of light, color, and shadow in still life and landscape paintings. Dalhart was named for a popular entertainer of the day, Vernon Dalhart. He was in the army and did a tour of duty in Europe. In 1967, he quit working in order to paint full-time. An iconic Texas native, Windberg began to attract national attention in the 1960s. He studied under the Texas painter Simon Michael. Windberg was determined to paint like the masters, so he developed a way to have a smooth surface by using diluted modeling paste to prepare his painting surface. By using this technique he could duplicate the look of the masters without spending as much time on each painting. He has executed romantic still lifes and figurative oil paintings depicting life in Texas, Mexico, Spain and Greece. There are hundreds of his original paintings and thousands of his reproduced prints and Giclées in circulation today dating back to the late 1960s. His art is very collectable and has adorned the walls of people not just in Texas but all over the world. Much of his art reflects his travels around Texas, Louisiana, the Rocky Mountains, many National Parks such as Yellowstone, the Grand Tetons, and Glacier National Park as well as the majestic Monument Valley. His Mediterranean paintings emulate his travels to parts of Italy and Greece. His art has encapsulated beautiful scenery including fields of bluebonnets, working cattlemen, mountain lakeside cabins, roaming buffalo and deer, streams in the mountains, snow-covered barns, night-lit farmlands, lonely windmills, coastal lighthouses, romantic candlelit wine glasses, small fishing vessels, and many other dreamlike spectacles, all with an old world charm. Two biographies have been written about the artist: in The Paths of the Masters, published in 1978, and Dalhart Windberg - Artist of Texas, published by the University of Texas Press in 1984. Its title was bestowed on the artist by the state legislature in 1979. He has also written a book describing his \"smooth surface\" technique of oil painting. Along with his sons Michael and Richard Windberg, Dalhart works in Georgetown, Texas at the Windberg Art Center. As a true master of his art, he and his son Michael teach art classes, in the same manner as Dalhart learned from his instructor Simon Michael. Students travel from all over the country just to get a glimpse of how Windberg paints, many of whom return time and time again, learning something new each time. Dalhart has also created a line of fine art products tailored to his style of fine brush and palette knife oil painting, all of which is based on his many years of experience. Windberg and his wife Evelyn live and work in Georgetown, Texas."

Latta died in office, a special election was held and Stephens was elected to fill his seat in the Sixty-second Congress. He was reelected to the Sixty-third, Sixty-fourth, and Sixty-fifth Congresses serving from November 7, 1911, to March 3, 1919. He was an unsuccessful candidate for reelection in 1918. Stephens resumed his former business pursuits in Nebraska. He went on to become a member of the State board of education of Nebraska from 1923 to 1926.

He was appointed Chief Executive and Chair in February 2011. He had been Monitor's Interim Chief Executive since March 2010. He was previously Head of the Policy Directorate in Number 10 Downing Street, serving between June 2005 and July 2007, when he was replaced after Gordon Brown succeeded Tony Blair as Prime Minister. Bennett was previously at the management consultancy firm, McKinsey & Company, in a 20-year career. In April 2011 he was named as the highest paid employee (£282,500) in the English NHS. His salary (£230,000) was the highest in the NHS in 2013. He was said by the Health Service Journal to be the eighth most powerful person in the English NHS in December 2013. As of 2015, Bennett was paid a salary of between £230,000 and £234,999 by Monitor, making him one of the 328 most highly paid people in the British public sector at that time. In July 2014, Bennett’s roles at Monitor were criticised by the Public Accounts Committee of the House of Commons (PAC), which noted: “It is wholly inappropriate that the same person acted as both Chair and Chief Executive of Monitor between March 2011 and January 2014. This was contrary to corporate governance good practice and Monitor's own guidance to NHS foundation trusts”. The chief executive posts at Monitor and the NHS Trust Development Authority are to be merged, and Bennett has said he will step down in due course."

  "text" : "Dominic Anciano (born 1959) is an English producer, actor, director, writer and comedian best known for his role as Sgt. Dominic de Sade in the British comedy television series Operation Good Guys. His first notable work was in the pioneering days of the pop and rock videos, when he wrote, produced and directed a significant number of award winning shorts. His first foray into feature films was with Philip Ridley's The Reflecting Skin where he was the producer along with Ray Burdis. Dominic produced The Krays, also written by Philip Ridley and starring Gary and Martin Kemp.This film was one of the most successful, both critically and financially, in the UK indie industry, winning BAFTAS and The Evening Standard's best film award along with numerous other awards. In 1995 Dominic produced The Passion of Darkly Noon. Co-financed by the UK, Germany and Belgium this film attracted big American stars in the form of Brendan Fraser and Ashley Judd and went on to become a cult hit in the festival circuit, winning several awards, including Best Director at the Porto Film Festival. 1995 also saw Anciano step away from the arthouse fold to work on Stephen Norrington's Death Machine, where he also made a cameo appearance as a corpse is a restaurant!! In 1997 Anciano and Burdis turned to their own creations – jointly writing, directing, producing and starring in the TV series Operation Good Guys. Anciano appeared as Sgt. Dominic de Sade (the first of several productions where he would cast himself using his own forename) and Burdis appeared as Det. Sgt. Ash.Operation Good Guys was seen as a ground breaking series for the BBC and won the coveted Silver Rose D'or and Prix de la presse at Montreux.Dominic went on to Write, produce and direct three successful seasons. Anciano then turned his attentions to the world of film.Taking the award winning formula of Operation Good Guys, he then co wrote produced and directed \"Final Cut\" which starred Jude Law and Sadie Frost. Using a unique approach to film making with improvisation and video techniques, the film caught the imagination of the critics and film festivals. The Guardian called Final Cut \"Genius\" and the film showed at Cannes.The next year Anciano/Burdis was approached by the BBC to write, produce and direct \"Love Honour and Obey\" a comedy/drama based in the dark world of London's criminal gangs.Although not loved by the British critics the film went on to be one of the financially most successful in the Brit indie scene of that year. Both films had a stellar cast including Jude Law,Jonny Lee Miller, Ray Winstone, Rhys Ifans and Sean Pertwee.Since 2001 Anciano has directed and written a number of TV productions. Moving away from comedy and into action/drama he has written several TV screenplays along with film scripts that have been successfully sold around the world.In 2006 Dominic became the creative director for Warner Music Entertainment, which heralded his move into new media. Anciano still continues to write and direct and lives in Spain and London."

  "text" : "Denis-Benjamin Papineau (November 13, 1789 – January 20, 1854) was joint premier of the Province of Canada for Canada East from 1846 to 1848. His joint premiers for Canada West during this period were William Henry Draper and Henry Sherwood. Papineau was a seigneurial agent, bookseller, seigneur, merchant, office holder, justice of the peace, and politician. Born in Montreal, he was the son of Joseph Papineau and Rosalie Cherrier. He studied at the Petit Séminaire de Québec. He oversaw the operation of the Seigneury of Petite-Nation, first for his father and later for his brother Louis-Joseph; he also served as postmaster for the region. He also was a partner in a Montreal bookstore. He was named a justice of the peace for Montreal district. In 1822, he became seigneur for the fief of Plaisance. He was elected to the Legislative Assembly of the Province of Canada representing Ottawa district in Canada East in 1842 and served until the end of 1847. Besides serving as joint premier, he also was Commissioner of Crown Lands and of public works from 1844 to 1847. He died in Sainte-Angélique (Papineauville), Lower Canada. When he yielded to requests from Denis-Benjamin Viger and Sir Charles Metcalfe to accept an appointment on the Executive Council, Papineau was criticized by many French-Canadians, despite his family's association with reform. His brother Louis-Joseph Papineau had been leader of the reform movement and was exiled for a time for his role in the Lower Canada Rebellion. His son Denis-Émery later represented the County of Ottawa in the Legislative Assembly."

  "text" : "Dadu Dayal (1544–1603) was a sant from Gujarat, India. \"Dadu\" means brother, and \"Dayal\" means \"the compassionate one\". He was reputedly found by an affluent business man floating on the river Sabarmati. He later moved to Naraina (city), near Jaipur Rajasthan, where he gathered around himself a group of followers, forming a sect that became known as the Dadupanth. This organization has continued in Rajasthan to the present-day and has been a major source of early manuscripts containing songs by Dadu and other North Indian saints. Dadu's compositions were recorded by his disciple Rajjab and are known as the Dadu Anubhav Vani, a compilation of 5,000 verses. Another disciple, Janagopal, wrote the earliest biography of Dadu. Dadu alludes to spontaneous (sahaja) bliss in his songs. Much of the imagery used is similar to that used by Kabir, and to that used by earlier Sahajiya Buddhists and Nath yogis. Dadu believed that devotion to God should transcend religious or sectarian affiliation, and that devotees should become non-sectarian or nipakh. Dadu had 100 disciples that attained samadhi. He instructed additional 52 disciples to set up ashrams, 'Thambas' around the region to spread the Lord's word. Dadu ji spent the latter years of his life in Naraiana, a small distance away from the town of Dudu, near Jaipur city. Five thambas are considered sacred by the followers; Naraiana, Bhairanaji, Sambhar, Amer, and Karadala (Kalyanpura). Followers at these thambas later set up other places of worship."

  "text" : "David MacMichael is a former Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) analyst. A ten-year veteran of the U.S. Marine Corps, he was a counter-insurgency expert in South-East Asia for four years. He also served as an analyst for the National Intelligence Council from 1981-1983. MacMichael graduated with an MA and Ph.D. in History from the University of Oregon. MacMichael resigned from the CIA in July 1983 because he felt the Agency was misrepresenting intelligence for political reasons. His public resignation from the Agency gave credence and notability to his vocal indictment of the Reagan Administration's policy toward Central America. He was considered the \"key witness\" in Nicaragua v. United States. The case was heard in 1986 before the International Court of Justice, which ruled that the United States had violated international law by supporting the Contras in their war against the Nicaraguan government and by mining Nicaragua's harbors. MacMichael also testified in front of Congress on this matter. A former investigator for the Christic Institute, he was an outspoken critic of the Institute's reliance on conspiracy theory, arguing that the Institute \"was eager, perhaps overeager, to demonstrate that this enterprise was responsible for everything since Cain slaying Abel.\"< In July 2005, he testified at a special joint hearing of Congressional and Senate Democrats about the consequences of the Plame affair. MacMichael is a member of Veteran Intelligence Professionals for Sanity (VIPS), founding member of Association of National Security Alumni and the Association for Responsible Dissent, and an outspoken critic of the Iraq War and the Bush Administration.

He is the son of Jim Crockett and brother to Jim Crockett, Jr. He was usually paired in announcing duties with Tony Schiavone, with Crockett providing color commentary and Schiavone providing play-by-play announcing. From 1985 to 1988, Crockett and Schiavone were the announcing team for NWA World Championship Wrestling. When Jim Ross joined the show in 1988, Crockett stayed on but later left to become an executive producer for World Championship Wrestling television programming. Crockett also worked with Bob Caudle on Mid-Atlantic Championship Wrestling. David Crockett is remembered for being clotheslined by Nikita Koloff on World Wide Wrestling in 1985 in Asheville, North Carolina. This led to Ric Flair coming to Crockett's aid and gave birth to the first Flair/Koloff feud and their money-making bout at the 1985 Great American Bash, held at the American Legion Memorial Stadium in Charlotte. David Crockett was on board a private airplane that crashed on October 4, 1975 that also had Johnny Valentine and Ric Flair on board. Crockett was the least injured of the men on board the plane. In addition, Crockett had a very brief career as a professional wrestler under the ring name Dave Finley."

  "text" : "Sir David Lewis Macpherson, KCMG PC (September 12, 1818 – August 16, 1896) was a Canadian businessman and political figure. He was a member of the Senate of Canada from 1867 to 1896. He was knighted for his service to the country in 1884. He was born in Castle Leathers in Inverness parish, Scotland in 1818 and came to Lower Canada with his family in 1835. He became a clerk in the Montreal office of his older brother's shipping business, which transported passengers and freight in Upper and Lower Canada. In 1842, he became a senior partner in the business. In partnership with Alexander Tilloch Galt and Luther Hamilton Holton, Macpherson acquired the shares of the Montreal and Kingston Railway, knowing that their rail line was required as part of a planned railway connection between Montreal and Hamilton. He was part of a contracting firm formed to extend the Grand Trunk Railway in Upper Canada. In 1853, he moved to Toronto. He helped set up the Toronto Rolling Mills Company which supplied track to the Grand Trunk. He also served as a director of the Bank of Upper Canada. In 1864, he was elected to the Legislative Council of the Province of Canada for Saugeen division and, in 1867, he was appointed to the Senate as a Conservative and served until his death. Macpherson was a member of the arbitration board that dealt with the financial issues associated with the creation of the separate provinces of Ontario and Quebec after Confederation. He led the resistance in the Senate to John Rose's proposed changes to banking legislation and some of Macpherson's proposals made their way into the Bank Act of 1871. He served as Speaker of the Senate from 1880 to 1883. In the early eighties, the legalization of marriage with a deceased wife's sister was under discussion in the Parliament of Canada. On the day that the bill received its second reading in the Red Chamber, the Sir David Macpherson invited Mrs. Susan Anna Wiggins, whose 'The Gunhilda Letters: Marriage with a Deceased Wife's Sister', letters of support for the bill had gained attention, to take a seat on his right, an honour, which was never before accorded to any woman but the wife of a Governor-General. To commemorate his time as Speaker, Macpherson, as well as other Speakers of the Senate, had his name crafted in stained glass in the ceiling of the front foyer of the Senate Chamber. Macpherson also served in cabinet as a Minister without Portfolio from 1880 to 1883 and as Minister of the Interior from 1883 to 1885. In later life, Macpherson suffered from diabetes and he spent part of the summer and fall each year recovering at spas in Germany. He attempted to encourage settlement in western Canada along the planned route for the Canadian Pacific Railway, but settlers found land in the western United States more attractive. Problems with land policy, unwillingness to take action and a basic lack of understanding in Macpherson's ministry of the concerns of the Métis people helped set the stage for the North-West Rebellion in 1885. He resigned from his cabinet post later that year. He died at sea on August 16, 1896 on board the steamship Labrador, in mid-ocean, and his remains were buried at sea."

  "text" : "Donald Roller Wilson (born November 23, 1938) is an American artist who uses some unique items in his paintings, such as dogs and cats, chimpanzees, dill pickles, wooden matches, olives, asparagus stalks, and even cigarettes. He paints in oils in very polished realism using the same techniques of the Old Masters. He was born in Houston, Texas and is based in Fayetteville, Arkansas. According to the New York Times, \"Donald Roller Wilson's goofy, hallucinogenic, Old Master-style painting of monkeys, dogs and cats dressed up in antique costumes may be kitsch, but it's high-quality kitsch, like good beach reading.\" Some of the characters he has created include Cookie the Baby Orangutan, Jane the Pug Girl, Jack the Jack Russell “Terror,” Loretta the Actress Cat, Miss Dog America, and Patricia the Seeing Eye Dog of Houston. He was educated at Wichita State University. Some of his works can be seen in the Brooklyn Museum; Chicago Art Institute; Whitney Museum; Bank of America in San Francisco, California; Coe Kerr Gallery, New York City; and Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, Smithsonian Institution, as well as many other galleries. The majority of his work is in the hands of private collectors. He was also Frank Zappa's visual coordinator during the 1980s and 1990s. He produced the cover art for Boulez Conducts Zappa: The Perfect Stranger (1984), Francesco Zappa (1984) and Them Or Us (1984). He taught at the University of Arkansas from 1967 - 1974 and lives in Fayetteville, Arkansas, with his wife Kathleen, also an artist. His main gallery at present is the John Berggruen Gallery in San Francisco, and his paintings may be collected through Peter Sahlman in New York."

  "text" : "David Cunningham (born 1954, Ireland) is a musician and producer who lives and works in London. Cunningham's work has ranged from pop music to gallery installations, including work for television, film, contemporary dance, and a number of collaborations with visual artists. His first significant success came with The Flying Lizards' single 'Money', an international hit in 1979. Since 1993 he has created a continuing series of installation works based on real time exploration of acoustics. 'The Listening Room', Biennale of Sydney (1998) was followed by two installation works in \"Days Like These\", The Tate Triennial of Contemporary British Art, Tate Britain 2003 and subsequent installations at ICC Tokyo, Ikon Birmingham and Camden Arts Centre London. David Cunningham studied at Maidstone College of Art, one of the first students to join David Hall's pioneering Time-Based course within the Fine Art department. His degree exhibition consisted entirely of work in sound, a happy way to graduate from a visual arts college. Cunningham's involvement in art education has continued over subsequent years, lecturing in many Fine Art departments and holding the positions of Research Fellow at both University of Newcastle and London College of Communication and Visiting Professor at the Royal College of Art. Following his first album release 'Grey Scale' in 1977 he has worked as a composer and record producer; engaging with a range of people and music, from rock groups (This Heat, Martin Creed) to improvisors (David Toop, and Steve Beresford), to Michael Nyman's music for Peter Greenaway's films, plus work with Ute Lemper and others. More recently he has produced Joanne Robertson's 'The Lighter', released 'One Hundred' (Staubgold 2009), a collaboration with saxophonist Yasuaki Shimizu and curated 'A lot of pianos...', a performance of seven new compositions for up to 20 pianos. Live performance has involved collaboration and performances with John Cage, Kathy Acker, Michael Nyman, Peter Gordon, Pan Sonic, Michael Giles, Scanner and others. Music for contemporary dance has included 'Canta' for Ian Spink Group/Second Stride, 'Freedom of Information' for Bill_T._Jones/Arnie_Zane_Dance_Company, 'Kioku no Gekijyo' for Goro Namerikawa, and 'Charlotte Kello Viisi Aamulla' for choreographer Tiina Huczkowski. Music for film and television has included Ken McMullen's films Zina and (in collaboration with Michael Giles and Jamie Muir) Ghost Dance, and a series of television collaborations with visual artists which has included John Latham, David Hall, Stephen Partridge, Bruce McLean. Related work includes the production and treatment of sound for installation and broadcast artworks by Martin Creed, Brad Butler and Karen Mirza, Sam Taylor-Wood, Susan Hiller, João Penalva, Ian Breakwell, Gillian Wearing and many others."

Taylor approached the Ironworks owner Arnold Hills with the idea of starting a works football team, and with his financial aid was able to announce on 29 June 1895 the following in the company's weekly journal: \"Mr. Taylor, who is working in the shipbuilding department, has undertaken to get up a football club for next winter and I learn that quoits and bowls will also be added to the attractions.\" - Thames Iron Works Gazette. He organised the half-a-crown year's membership for fifty would-be players and spent that summer arranging the fixtures for the Thames Ironworks team and their reserves. Before Thames Ironworks played their first game Dave Taylor returned to refereeing and the organisational duties of the club were handed over to another Thames Iron Works employee, Ted Harsent, who became the first official club secretary."

  "text" : "Dieter Oesterlen (April 5, 1911 in Heidenheim – April 6, 1994 in Hanover) was German architect. He re-built the Leineschloss, the Marktkirche, and the opera house all in Hanover after the destruction of World War II. Oesterlen's father was the chief engineer of a turbine factory in Heidenheim. His family left the town for Berlin during World War I. From Berlin they moved again to Hanover after his father was appointed professor of turbine technology at the local technical college. The foundations to Oesterlen's training in architecture began here. He regularly visited exhibitions at the kestnergesellschaft. He attended evening classes in freehand drawing at the School of Applied Arts. As a young man he worked in some unorthodox places. For instance, after completing high school he worked, as part of his practical requirements, at the construction site of the Oder-Dam as a carpenter. He was a great observer and absorbed much by merely going from place to place. Before he began a formal training as an architect he was already a “student” of architecture. The strict objectivity of the Bauhaus building in Dessau, which Oesterlen visited in the years before he started his architectural degree, made a lasting impression on him."

  "text" : "David Clohessy is the St. Louis, Missouri+-basednnational director and spokesman for the Survivor's Network of those Abused by Priests (SNAP), the largest and oldest self-help group for victims of clergy molestation in the United States. Clohessy has been widely quoted by news organizations covering the sex abuse scandal, including the New York Times, and he has appeared on numerous television shows, including Good Morning America, The Oprah Winfrey Show, The Phil Donahue Show, and 60 Minutes. Clohessy has publicly stated he was the victim of sexual abuse by a priest during his teenage years (from 1969-1973). Clohessy struggled with the fact that his brother, Father Kevin Clohessy (who has since left the priesthood voluntarily), also had eventually \"a credible accusation\" against him for being inappropriate sexually while a priest. Clohessy is a 1978 graduate of Drury University in Springfield, Missouri. He has worked as a union organizer for the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now or ACORN, a public relations director and also served on the staff of St. Louis Mayor Freeman Bosley, Jr.. Recently, Clohessy has faced legal trouble for failing to release information on alleged clergy abuse victims. He has stated that he may be fined or jailed for failing to comply with the court order mandating him to release the records. The information was originally requested by the court because they believe an attorney for the plaintiff in a sexual abuse case violated a gag order by leaking details of the case to SNAP. The state Supreme Court has refused to intervene on his behalf, a decision that they made after his deposition. According to Clohessy, this is the most significant legal challenge faced by the group in its 23 years."

In his first two seasons at the club he scored over 1000 runs in the county championship and in his third season which was interrupted by injury he still scored over 700 runs. Robinson captained Leicestershire towards the latter part of the 2006 season after Jeremy Snape dropped himself because of a lack of form. Robinson impressed in the field and helped guide Leicestershire to a 4th-place finish. Midway through the 2007 season Robinson himself lost his place due to a lack of form, and the captaincy of the side to Paul Nixon. It is thought unlikely that his contract will be renewed. Robinson's highest score is 200 against the touring New Zealand side in 1999 while still with Essex.He now plays for Wickford Cricket Club."

  "text" : "Dmitri Minaevich Sinodi-Popov (Russian Дмитрий Минаевич Синоди-Попов) (1855 – 1910) was a Russian artist of Greek descent. Dmitri Sinodi-Popov was born in the city of Taganrog, where he received a good education at home: violin, French, Italian and Greek languages and was very good at the visual arts. In 1870, Sinodi-Popov entered the St. Petersburg Academy of Arts, where the amateur artist acquired good practical skills, but he had to interrupt his studies because he was suffering from epilepsy. In late 1870s, the artist returned to his home city of Taganrog, continued his art studies and painted a lot. Most of the sketches available at the Taganrog Museum of Art and Taganrog State Museum date back to late 1870s - early 1900s. Most of the visual heritage left by the artist is in the form of drawings. His portraits of local Greeks are very expressive: Portrait of Doctor Divaris, Greek Boy and An Old Greek (1870). Starting from the 1880s, the artist worked in the context of Peredvizhniki traditions. The portrait of the artist Seraphima Blonskaya goes beyond the boundaries of its genre and transforms into a portrait-painting. The image of the young woman conveys seriousness and simplicity. Sinodi-Popov exhibited in Europe and his name became well-known, bringing new orders and fans. But with his illness progressing, the artist went for medical treatment to Rome and later Paris, where he died."

Running for re election on a Party of National Unity ticket, defending his seat as Member of parliament for North Imenti Constituency, he was defeated by Silas Muriuki, who was running on a Mazingira Green Party of Kenya ticket. Prior to going into elective politics, he had a long and distinguished career in Kenya's civil service, serving in various senior positions hence his recently appearing as a witness before Kenya's Truth, Justice and Reconciliation Commission as a witness to testify on the Government of Kenya's role in the Wagalla massacre.Following allegations that he had been involved in the Anglo Leasing Scandal, he decided to resign as Finance Minister on 1 February 2006. He maintained that he was innocent and claimed that he was stepping down to pave way for investigations. Despite there being no investigation report clearing Mwiraria, President Mwai Kibaki appointed him Minister for Environment on 24 July 2007.He got his master's degree in Statistics from the Makerere University, Uganda 1966 (then part of the University of East Africa). Mwiraria features prominently in audio recordings released on the internet in 2006 by John Githongo, exiled former Permanent Secretary in the Kenya Government, which indicate Mwiraria was trying to stop Githongo's inquiries into the theft of over 777 million US Dollars in a series of 18 security related contracts, colloquially called Anglo Leasing."

While en route to London, on 23 December 1799, his ship was caught in a hurricane. Provisions, seven guns, and a quantity of shot were thrown overboard to lighten ship. Nineteen days later, on 12 January 1800, she was overtaken by a French brig, whose captain demanded that the American haul down her flag. Ross's answer was a broadside. A two-hour engagement, within pistol shot, followed; and after the Frenchman had sheered off, Belvedere, with damage to her rigging, sails, and hull, continued on. USS Ross (DD-563) was named for him. This article incorporates text from the public domain Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships."

  "text" : "Domitia Lucilla Minor (Minor, Latin for the Younger), sometimes known as Domitia Calvilla or Lucilla (died 155–161), was a noble Roman woman who lived in the 2nd century. She is best known as the mother of the Roman Emperor Marcus Aurelius. Lucilla was the daughter of Domitia Lucilla Maior (Maior is Latin for the Elder) and the patrician Publius Domitius Calvisius Tullus Ruso and was a niece to Lucanus Domitius. The maternal grandfather of the younger Lucilla, Lucius Catilius Severus served as twice consul and became city Prefect. Lucilla’s father served as consul in AD 109 and the date of his second consulship is unknown. Lucilla through her mother had inherited a great fortune, which included a tile and brick factory near Rome, close to the river Tiber. The factory provided bricks to some of Rome's most famous monuments including the Colosseum, Pantheon and the Market of Trajan, and exported bricks to France, Spain, North Africa and all over the Mediterranean. Lucilla married Marcus Annius Verus, a praetor, who came from a wealthy senatorial family. Verus' sister Faustina the Elder was a Roman Empress and married the Roman Emperor Antoninus Pius. Verus was a nephew to Roman Empress Vibia Sabina and his maternal grandmother was Salonina Matidia (niece of Roman Emperor Trajan). With Verus, they had two children, a son, the future Roman Emperor Marcus Aurelius (26 April 121) and a daughter Annia Cornificia Faustina (122/123 – between 152 and 158). In 124, her husband died. Her children were raised by herself and they were adopted by her father-in-law. Marcus Aurelius would later inherit the tile and brick factory. In Lucilla’s household, the future Roman Emperor Didius Julianus was educated and through her support he was able to start his legal career. Lucilla was a lady of considerable wealth and influence. In his Meditations, Marcus Aurelius describes her as a ‘pious and generous’ person, who lived a simple life (1.3n). She spent her final years living with her son in Rome."

  "text" : "Dominique Auguste Lereboullet was a French doctor and zoologist. He was born on 19 September 1804 at Épinal, and died of an apoplectic fit on 6 October 1865 in Strasbourg. He began his studies at Colmar before specialising in medicine at Strasbourg where he graduated as a doctor with a thesis about cholera. While practising medicine, he kept up a series of studies into comparative anatomy of animals. On the departure of Georges Louis Duvernoy to Paris, Lereboullet took the opportunity to occupy the chair of zoology and comparative anatomy at the faculty of science in Strasbourg. Lereboullet was dean of the Faculty of Sciences and professor of zoology at the University of Strasbourg, as well as the director of Musée zoologique de la ville de Strasbourg (the city's natural history museum). His zoological studies included works on the genitals of vertebrates, foie gras, comparative embryology of fish and carcinology."

  "text" : "Domenico Pellegrini Giampietro (August 30, 1899, Brienza, in Basilicata – June 18, 1970, Montevideo) was an Italian academic, economist, lawyer, politician, and (in his final years) journalist. As a young man living in Caserta, Pellegrini Giampietro founded a nationalist legion named Sempre pronti (\"Always Ready\"). He was a decorated infantry lieutenant in World War I, and joined the Fascist movement in 1922, as a member of the Benito Mussolini's Partito Nazionale Fascista (PNF), and took part in the March on Rome. In the period, Pellegrini Giampietro became associated with certain clubs of the Freemasonry. A major figure of Campanian-elected fascists (together with Alfredo Rocco, Bruno Spampanato, and the economist Alberto Beneduce), he received a diploma in Law in 1926, and became lawyer for the next eight years. He was one who took Fascism into academia, lecturing on Comparative public law and doctrinary history of Fascism at Naples University. He also worked in several credit unions. Pellegrini Giampietro was a volunteer infantry captain on Francisco Franco's side in the Spanish Civil War, and was twice decorated. Upun his return, he received numerous political appointments - notably, he was a counsellor for the Corporazioni and the Fasci, and deputy-secretary in the Ministry of Finance in 1943. He joined Mussolini in Northern Italy after the latter's ousting and Italy's commitment to the Allies in World War II, becoming an official of the Nazi German-controlled Italian Social Republic (the \"republic of Salò\"). As Finance minister, he also set up, in 1944, its infamous Brigate Nera paramilitary force. At the end of the war, Pellegrini Giampietro was arrested and charged with collaborating with the enemy. He escaped and in 1949, he took refuge in Brazil, then Argentina, and finally Uruguay. He kept on working as a banker, and edited the magazine Sintesi. Domenico Pellegrini Giampietro wrote on the theory of Fascism: his 1941 volume Aspetti spirituali del fascismo (\"Spiritual Aspects of Fascism\") dealt with the more mystical qualities of the dogma, while L'oro di Salò (\"The Gold of Salò\") attempted to explain his actions as planner for the Republic's economy (notably, in early 1945 he had printed only 10,881 million although the print of 137,840 million had been authorized), as well as launching accusations at people who would have been responsible for plundering the wealth ammased by Mussolini's government."

Born Dorothy Belle Flanagan in Kansas City, Missouri, she studied journalism and after graduating from the University of Missouri with a B.J. degree in 1924 worked in that field in Missouri, New Mexico, and New York. She did graduate work in journalism at the University of New Mexico and at Columbia University but did not receive a degree from either institution. Hughes’s first published book, Dark Certainty (1931), a volume of poetry, won the Yale Series of Younger Poets Competition. In 1940, she published her first mystery novel, The So Blue Marble. She published eight more mystery novels in the 1940s. She also wrote a history of the University of New Mexico and a critical study of writer Erle Stanley Gardner. In 1951 she received an Edgar Award from the Mystery Writers of America in the category of Outstanding Mystery Criticism, and in 1978 she was given the MWA's Grand Master award. Hughes acknowledged the influence of such writers as Eric Ambler, Graham Greene, and William Faulkner. Her writing style and suspenseful plots exemplified the hardboiled genre of crime and detective novels, and her literary career associates her with other female crime writers of the 1940s and 1950s, such as Margaret Millar, Vera Caspary, Elizabeth Sanxay Holding, and Olive Higgins Prouty. Hughes was a successful writer and popular during her day. Three of her novels were made into movies: The Fallen Sparrow (1943), starring John Garfield; In a Lonely Place (1950), directed by Nicholas Ray and starring Humphrey Bogart; and Ride the Pink Horse (1947), directed by and starring Robert Montgomery, which was remade for television in 1964 as The Hanged Man. From 1940 to 1979 she reviewed mysteries for the Albuquerque Tribune, the Los Angeles Times, te New York Herald-Tribune and other newspapers. Hughes made her home in Santa Fe, New Mexico, which she used as the setting of several novels. Hughes died in Ashland, Oregon, from complications following a stroke."

  "text" : "Dan Maraya Jos (born Adamu Wayya in 1946 - 20 June 2015) was a Nigerian Hausa Griot best known for playing the kontigi.Dan Maraya Jos, whose name means \"The Orphan of Jos\", was born in 1946 and Died Saturday, 20 June 2015 in Bukuru, near Jos in Plateau State, Nigeria. His Islamic name is Adamu, but his father died shortly after his birth and his mother died while he was still an infant, hence the name by which everyone knows him. Dan Maraya's father was a court musician for the Sarkin Hausawa of Bukuru, who took Dan Maraya under his care when his parents died. Dan Maraya showed an early interest in music and came under the influence of local professional musicians. During a trip to Maiduguri while he was still a pre-teen, he was impressed by musicians there and made a kuntigi, with which he has accompanied himself ever since. The kuntigi is a small, single-stringed lute. The body is usually a large, oval-shaped sardine can covered with goatskin. Dan Maraya and other kuntigi players are solo performers who accompany themselves with a rapid ostinato on the kuntigi. During instrumental interludes they repeat a fixed pattern for the song they are playing, but while singing, they will often change the notes of the pattern to parallel the melody they are singing. Like most professional musicians, the mainstay of Dan Maraya's repertoire is praise singing, but Dan Maraya singles out his personal heroes rather than the rich and famous. His first, and perhaps still his most famous song is \"Wak'ar Karen Mota\" [\"Song of the Driver's Mate\"] in praise of the young men who get passengers in and out of minivan buses and do the dirty work of changing tires, pushing broken down vans, and the like. During the Nigerian Civil War, he composed numerous songs in praise of soldiers of the federal army and incorporated vivid accounts of scenes from the war in his songs. Many of his songs incorporate social commentary. These include the songs on marriage in the study here, which probably date from the early 1970s. One might argue that they are really one large song, and in performance, Dan Maraya incorporates lines from each of them. However, the recordings that serve as the basis for this study have three distinct musical settings, and the songs themselves have three different themes. \"Jawabin Aure\" [\"Discourse on Marriage\"] lists the problems attendant in divorce and admonishes married couples to try to patch up their differences. \"Auren Dole\" [\"Forced Marriage\"] decries the practice of families arranging marriages for their daughters rather than letting them decide on their own mates. \"Gulma-Wuya\" [\"The Busybody\"] describes a neighborhood gossip who works in collusion with a boka (a practitioner in casting spells, removing evil spirits, etc.) to disrupt marriages by sowing dissension between women and their husbands. The latter song is amusing in that Dan Maraya performs it as a drama, imitating the voices of the different characters as they speak, a technique that he has used in other songs as well.compile by Aliyu Badeggi"

His main cinema work was: \n* Walker (1987) (sound) \n* Return of the Jedi (1983) (boom operator) \n* Dragonslayer (1981) (production sound assistant) He was involved in the radio adaptation of Espedair Street, the Iain Banks novel. When asked to take over as production mixer on Alex Cox’s Walker, on location in Nicaragua, Batchelor was only told when collected from the airport that the film was being shot in a war zone. Batchelor said calmly that he would probably need some kind of hat. Note: This is not the same Dave Batchelor who produced The Sensational Alex Harvey Band or the critically acclaimed Oasis song \"Slide Away\", which appeared on their 1994 debut Definitely Maybe."
