  "text" : "Enrico Sabbatini (January 1, 1932 – November 25, 1998) was an Italian costume designer and production designer for the theater and cinema industries. Sabbatini was born in Spoleto, in the province of Umbria. His creations were usually very lavish and detailed, made for epoch movies. In 1986 he won the award for best costume design by the British Academy, as well as a nomination for the Oscar for his work in The Mission. He also produced Seven Years in Tibet (1997), Cutthroat Island (1995), Chronicle of a Death Foretold (1987), Bloodline (1979), Giordano Bruno (1973), Sacco and Vanzetti (1971), Camille 2000, The Lickerish Quartet, the Marco Polo TV miniseries, and many others. Specifically, he was costume designer and production designer for a large series of biblical-inspired TV series in the TNT network, such as Moses, Joseph, Jesus of Nazareth, Jacob, Abraham, David, Genesis and Samson and Delilah, as well as, in his last work just before he died, in the TV series Cleopatra. He died in a road accident in Ouarzazate, Morocco, while filming on location for Cleopatra. As it appears in the credits, Jesus, a 1999 film distributed by CBS Television, was dedicated in his memory."

  "text" : "Elisedd ap Gwylog (died c. 755), also known as Elise, was king of Powys in eastern Wales. Little has been preserved in the historical records about Elisedd, who was a descendant of Brochwel Ysgithrog. He appears to have reclaimed the territory of Powys after it had been overrun by the English. His great-grandson, Cyngen ap Cadell erected a column in his memory which stands not far from the later abbey of Valle Crucis. This is known as the Pillar of Eliseg, but the form Eliseg which appears on the column is thought to be a mistake by the carver of the inscription. The Latin inscription on the pillar is now very hard to read, but was apparently clearer in the time of Edward Lhuyd who transcribed it. The translation of the part of the inscription referring to Elisedd is as follows: + Concenn son of Catell, Catell son of Brochmail, Brochmail son of Eliseg, Eliseg son of Guoillauc. + And that Concenn, great-grandson of Eliseg, erected this stone for his great-grandfather Eliseg. + The same Eliseg, who joined together the inheritance of Powys . . . out of the power of the Angles with his sword and with fire. + Whosoever repeats the writing, let him give a blessing on the soul of Eliseg. Some old poems refer to Elisedd and assert he had a \"special crown, a chain of twisted gold links, and armlets and anklets of gold which were the badges of sovereignty of Powys\". These artifacts have disappeared from history but perhaps resurfaced briefly during the coronation of Owain Glyndŵr in 1400. Elisedd was succeeded by his son Brochfael."

  "text" : "Erik Ipsen Arup (November 22, 1876 – September 23, 1951) was a Danish historian, known as the pioneer of radical-liberal history writing in Denmark. Born as the son of a Zealandian provincial doctor, he grew up during the long years of the Danish constitutional struggle. As a young man he was deeply impressed by Viggo Hørup and his political anti-militarist line. He was educated as both a theologian and a historian. During World War I Arup was connected to the social-liberal Zahle cabinet as a permanent under-secretary. From 1916 to 1947 he was a professor at the University of Copenhagen. First and foremost, Arup should be seen as one of the early Scandinavian materialist historians. His breakthrough came with his dissertation Studier i engelsk og tysk Handels Historie (Studies in German and English History of Trade, 1907), a pioneering work stressing the geographic and economic, instead of the national or ethnic, background behind the development of trade. In addition to this work, he notably wrote on economic history in Schleswig-Holstein, on medieval economy, and on 18th Century foreign policy - besides producing a quick and popular biography of his inspirational figure Hørup (1941). Arup's main work, however, is his unfinished Danmarks Historie (History of Denmark, published 1925-32) covering Danish history until 1624 (a posthumous volume, published in 1955, deals with the period until 1665). It was conceived as a textbook for the University but was, because of the considerable debate attending the publication of its first parts, never completed. What is innovative in this work is Arup's coverage of his country's evolution mainly from the angle of material development, of agriculture, of trade, and to some extent of public health. Political or international relations are not ignored, but are somewhat relegated to the background. The work is strongly influenced by the author's political views: his favourite aversions are war policy and militarism, arbitrary royal power, a number of national-patriotic myths, and in general everything he interprets as nationalist views. Among the author's ”victims” are thus Saxo Grammaticus, Absalon, King Christian IV, while men such as Christian II or some medieval opposition figures are given more approval. Arup's language is sharp and committed, marked by his unambiguous views. He concentrates on period documents rather than chronicles or other secondary narratives, and more generally introduces strict demands regarding source criticism. Demands that do not, however, preclude his own audacious conclusions. The book provoked embittered attacks from many Danish historians. Arup was accused of non-patriotic views and of superficiality (he did not mention any sources in his work). Much of this may have been a more or less predictable conservative reaction against social-liberal views that were far from broadly accepted or understood at the time. More relevant today perhaps, is the critique of Arup as lacking historical feel and holding anachronistic views (such as his attempt to find “parliamentarian” traces in medieval government). Also, it has been argued that his work is more a reevaluation of existing values than a set of new discoveries. Nonetheless, this History of Denmark is in its own country still regarded as the most consistent break with traditional historical writing, and has offered much inspiration to later social-liberal and Marxist historians. Thus if Arup, through much of his work and career, was on collision course with many colleagues of his age, he did acquire many faithful followers among younger historians. Still, the heated debate around his book wounded the polemical but also vulnerable Arup and inhibited his interest in finishing his work. Arup was also the editor of Historisk Tidsskrift (Historical Review) from 1917 to 1924, involved in editing Danish medieval sources from 1931 to 1937, and for some years collaborator to the pioneering Danish-Swedish periodical Scandia. He took a particular interest in Iceland and, as member of several organisations dealing with Danish-Icelandic relations, he generally showed himself compliant with Icelandic views. In many ways Arup considered himself a modern heir to Arild Huitfeldt. Among congenial contemporaries, Swedish Curt Weibull, founder of Scandia, should be highlighted. Arup's methodological views also appear inspired by French historians such as Charles Seignobos and Charles-Victor Langlois. He was the cousin of Sir Ove Arup."

He helped spearhead the local option movement in New York during the 1840s by which local majorities could vote their towns dry. In 1846, he received the nomination for the Governorship of New York from the Native American Party, but he declined it. He was also active in the Maine Law prohibition movement of the 1850s. He later sent a copy of a temperance tract to every soldier in the Union Army during the Civil War (a million copies in all); and sponsored a series of periodicals. They included the Journal of the American Temperance Union, the Temperance Recorder, the American Temperance Intelligencer; the Enquirer, and the Prohibitionist. Prohibition or dry towns in Illinois and Wisconsin were named in his honor. E. C. Delavan is the namesake of Delavan, Illinois and Delavan, Wisconsin."

From 1929, after finishing middle school and housekeeping school in Magdeburg, she worked in Berlin as a housekeeper and a model, and also, after additional training in shorthand typing, as an office specialist. In 1937, she married the sculptor Graf Cay–Hugo von Brockdorff, and shortly thereafter, their daughter Saskia was born. From 1941, Brockdorff put her flat at Hans Coppi's resistance movement's disposal as their radio headquarters. She was soon arrested along with the other Red Orchestra members and sent to Charlottenburg Women's Prison. She was sentenced at the Reichskriegsgericht to ten years in labour prison (Zuchthaus) in January 1943. Adolf Hitler was not satisfied with this, however, and on the very same day as the judgment, on his orders, the sentence was changed to death. Together with Mildred Harnack and Elfriede Paul, she waited another four months for the sentence to be carried out. On the evening of 13 May 1943, she was put to death, by guillotine, along with thirteen other persons at Plötzensee Prison in Berlin."

In 1894, Simmons was awarded the first commission of the Municipal Art Society, a series of murals — Justice, The Fates, and The Rights of Man for the interior of the Criminal Courthouse at 100 Centre Street in Manhattan. This court is the criminal branch of New York Supreme Court (the trial court in New York), where many New Yorkers serve on jury duty. Later Simmons decorated the Waldorf Astoria New York hotel, the Library of Congress in Washington, and the Minnesota State Capitol in Saint Paul. In the year 1914 he travelled with Childe Hassam to view the Arizona desert paintings of the rising California artist Xavier Martinez at his Piedmont studio. Simmons was a member of the Ten American Painters, who, as a group, seceded from the Society of American Artists. He was also considered a contributor to the style known as the American Renaissance, a movement after the American Civil War that stressed the relationship of architecture, painting, sculpture and interior design. Simmons published his autobiography in 1922."

  "text" : "Emilio Betti (Camerino, August 20, 1890 – Camorciano di Camerino, August 11, 1968) was an Italian jurist, Roman Law scholar, philosopher and theologian. He is best known for his contributions to hermeneutics, part of a broad interest in interpretation. As a legal theorist, Betti is close to interpretivism. Betti's intellectual support of fascism between the end of World War I and the beginning of the 1920s led him to be arrested in 1944, in Camerino. Betti remained in prison for about a month, as decided by the Comitato di Liberazione Nazionale. In August 1945, Betti was presented to court and absolved of every accusation. His political choices, anyway, have not diminished the value and importance of his work. Between many other things, Betti was one of the members of the drafting commission for the Italian civil code of 1942. Betti is perhaps best known for his work in hermeneutics. He took issue with the hermeneutic views of Hans Georg Gadamer and argued that interpreters should attempt to reconstruct the author's intentions. His work influenced the work of E. D. Hirsch, the chief English-language spokesman for authorial intention. However, his influence in English has been limited by the lack of translations of his hermeneutic work."

Following reports of drunken behaviour on and off the set, Lordan left the show in mid-2004. Before landing the role of Lynne Hobbs in EastEnders, Lordan worked as an aerobics instructor for 10 years.Lordan appeared in TV comedy drama Minder as Trish, a despatcher, Gimme Gimme Gimme as Linda La Hughes's Eurovision-singing sister Sugar Walls in two episodes (1999: credited as Elaine Morgan, 2000). She also appeared in Tucker's Luck (1983) as Michelle Passmore, Game On (1996) as Mandy's university friend Julia, and in the gangster film Face (1997) starring Robert Carlyle and Ray Winstone. She appeared on the fifth series of I'm a Celebrity, Get Me Out of Here! in November 2005, but within a day of arriving she passed out twice in the camp, and although the doctors found her to be in good health, she was removed from the jungle, the producers noting they had to consider if they felt the contestants were up to the rigors of the show. She was the first person to be voted off the 2007 series of Soapstar Superstar after performing Bonnie Tyler's \"It's a Heartache\". She married Peter Manuel in December 2005, and her baby son died a few days later, aged one, having had surgery for a diaphragmatic hernia. This tragedy came just nine months after the suicide of her mother Bernie. She became pregnant again in 2007 but suffered a miscarriage. Fresh tragedy occurred in April 2008 when her father died from a degenerative illness. She wrote about this part of her life in the book Whatever It Takes: A Story of Family Survival, published in 2008."

  "text" : "Ethel Smith (November 22, 1902 – May 10, 1996) was an American organist who played primarily in a pop style on the Hammond organ. Born Ethel Goldsmith, she performed from a fairly young age and traveled widely, learning several languages. She became proficient in Latin music while staying in South America, and it is the style of music with which she is now most associated. She was a guitarist as well as an organist, and in her later years occasionally played the guitar live for audiences, but all her recordings were on the organ. She ultimately recorded dozens of albums, mostly for Decca Records. An attractive woman with a preference for colorful outfits, particularly hats, Smith performed in several Hollywood films. She was married to Hollywood actor Ralph Bellamy from 1945 to 1947, at the height of her fame, and their acrimonious divorce made headlines. Her rendition of \"Tico Tico\" became her best-known hit. She performed it in the MGM film Bathing Beauty (1944), after which her recording reached the U.S. pop charts in November 1944, peaked at #14 on January 27, 1945, and sold nearly two million copies worldwide. Smith's recording of \"Monkey on a String\" became the theme song for Garfield Goose and Friends, a popular children's television show in Chicago that ran from 1952 until 1976. Smith died on May 10, 1996, at age 93."

In May 1998, Zanotto wrote an article in the American Journal of Physics relating to the false notion that observations of thick glass on old windows translated to the fact that glass is a liquid. Zanotto sought to calculate the flow of glass and found that at 414 Celsius (777 °F) the glass would move a visible amount in 800 years, yet at room temperature he found that it would take glass 10,000 trillion times the age of the earth."

  "text" : "Erchinoald (also Erkinoald and, in French, Erchenout) succeeded Aega as the mayor of the palace of Neustria in 641 and succeeded Flaochad in Burgundy in 642 and remained such until his death in 658. According to Fredegar, he was a relative (consanguineus) of Dagobert I's mother. Chaume cites the Notitia de Fundatione Monasterii Glanderiensis to suggest that Erchinoald was descended from the Gallo Roman senator Ansbertus through a son of that senator also named Erchinoald and that Erchinoald's son Leudesius, and was therefore a descendant of the Gallo-Roman families of the Syagrii and Ferrèoli  Erchinoald's relationship with Merovingian King Dagobert has been proposed to have been through his mother Gerberga, daughter of Burgundian dux Ricomeres (fl. 575) and Bertrude, her putative sister and mother of King Dagobert. Herchenfrida (Erchinfreda), mother of St Desiderius of Cahors will have also been of this family as is further evidenced inter alia by that Gallo Roman saint's close ties to King Dagobert, and a brother named \"Syagrius\". Erchinoald introduced Balthild, an Anglo-Saxon slave, most probably of a high-ranking Anglo Saxon family from East Anglia (later canonised), to Clovis II, king of Neustria. The king's marriage to the pious Balthild reinforced Erchinoald's position at court. It has been suggested given the rarity of the name element \"Erchin\" (Genuine or truly) among the Franks and Saxons that Queen Emma of Kent, thought to be from Frankia, and the wife of Eadbald of Kent was of this family and perhaps Erchinoald's daughter. Eadbald and Emma had a son Eorconbert b. ca 618 so Emma was probably born before 600 and was not a daughter but a sister or less likely a cousin of Erchinoald. This was a period of considerable Frankish influence in Kent and East Anglia and as one of the most powerful men in Frankia located at his estate at Peronne not far from the English channel when he was not at court, it was Erchinoald who wielded this influence during his lifetime. Erchinoald supported efforts of successors of the Augustinian mission to England. One notable manner in which he both exerted influence and aided the mission was his involvement in and support of convents within his sphere of influence in Neustria (for example Faremoutiers) into which some of the princesses of Kent, such as Eorcongota and East Anglia such as Aethelburg and Saethryth, in most cases his relations, retired and were made abbess. Erchinoald himself married Leutsinde. Through her he had a son, Leudesius, who became the mayor of the palace of Neustria in 675. Erchinoald died in 658 and was succeeded by Ebroin, chosen by the Frankish nobles. Although his son, Leudesius, and much of his family were destroyed in the conflict between the factions of Leudegar of Autun and Ebroin in 676, the name does resurface in the 7th century in Frankia suggesting he may have had some descendants who survived; Chaume has posited a sister who was ancestor to a number of powerful families during the Carolingian era such as the Guerinids, the counts of Gatinais, and the Guidonids."

  "text" : "Elihu Phinney (1756–1813) was the first printer in Cooperstown, New York. In the early 1790s he lived in Canaan, Columbia County, New York, where he published the Columbian Mercury, and Canaan Repository of Rural Knowledge. Phinney was invited to Cooperstown by Judge William Cooper, the wealthy land developer who had established the Otsego County, New York village. There in 1795, Phinney opened a printing and publishing business. In his weekly newspaper, The Otsego Herald; or, Western Advertiser, Phinney wrote that he, \"in the winter of 1793, penetrated a wilderness, and broke a track, through a deep snow, with six teams, in the 'depth' of winter, and was received with a cordiality, bordering on homage.\" It is said that James Fenimore Cooper, Judge Cooper's son and future novelist, frequented Phinney's print shop and there, for his own enjoyment, learned the art of setting type. In fact, James Fenimore Cooper's daughter Caroline married Phinney's grandson, Henry Frederich Phinney, in 1849. Early on, through his publications, Phinney provided political support for the Federalist Judge Cooper, but by the end of the first decade of the 19th century, Phinney had begun to support the Clintonian Republicans who by then had become a majority in the county. Besides endorsing Cooper's political opponents, Phinney went so far as to sponsor a petition to change the name of Cooperstown to \"Otsego Village.\" Phinney's company contributed to Cooperstown's status as a major publishing center through the first half of the 19th century. His sons, Henry and Elihu Phinney Jr., took over the business in 1813, upon their father's death and became known for the 138 Bible editions that they publishing between 1822 and 1848, when their company, H. & E. Phinney, moved to Buffalo. A copy of H. & E. Phinney’s 1828 \"Authorized\" (i.e., King James) edition of the Bible, containing Old and New Testaments, as well as the Apocrypha was used by Joseph Smith, founder of the Latter Day Saint movement, as a basis for his \"translation\" of the Bible written between 1830 and 1833. Besides operating a book shop in Cooperstown, the Phinneys sold books (both their own and those of other American publishers) from large wagons and Erie Canal \"bookboats\", which helped them expand into Western New York. From 1833 to 1840, Elihu Phinney, Jr. held office as the supervisor of the Town of Otsego (in which the Village of Cooperstown is located). Henry Phinney later held the office 1850. Elihu Phinney's name may now be associated as much with the game of baseball as it is with the publishing business. It was claimed that Abner Doubleday, the supposed inventor of baseball, regularly played the game on Phinney's farm. This led to the purchase of the lot for use as a baseball park now called Doubleday Field, which was the site of the annual Hall of Fame Game."

He taught at Elgin High School for four decades while serving as city councilman, mayor, secretary of the Board of Trustees of the Gail Borden Public Library District, and various other capacities in local government. In addition he was a part-time instructor at Elgin Community College. Alft was elected to the Elgin City Council in the at-large election in April, 1963. Four years later, he was elected Mayor, succeeding Clyde Shales. As was the custom at the time, Alft did not seek reelection when his four-year term expired in 1971. William Rauschenberger was elected to succeed him. He may be best known as a historian of Elgin. He has published several books on the history of Elgin and the surrounding area, in addition to hundreds of articles for the local newspaper Elgin Daily Courier-News. He currently writes a biweekly column on Elgin's history."

Trickett was born at Greenwich, on the Lane Cove River in Sydney. His father was a former convict and a bootmaker and his mother was Irish. The young Ned learned to scull on Sydney Harbour in New South Wales, Australia. Records show that rowing matches between crews of visiting ships had been taking place on the harbour from as early as 1805. The Sydney Gazette newspaper recorded \"The first Australian Regatta\" in 1827 with a rowing race for 20 Spanish dollars and both rowing and sailing were established sports by 1837 when the first Anniversary Regatta was held in Sydney."

  "text" : "Emmanuïl Bogdanovych Chekaliuk (Ukrainian: Емануїл Богданович Чекалюк Gnizdychev, Zhydachiv District, Lviv Oblast, May 6, 1909 – Lviv, January 5, 1990) was a Ukrainian petroleum engineer and statistical thermodynamicist. He first produced rigorous physical and mathematical evidences of petroleum thermodynamic stability at mantlean conditions. Since 1990’s the heavy hydrocarbons mixture enriched with organometallic compounds is widely known as “Chekaliuk’s petroleum”. Born in the family of a parson he graduated from Electromechanics Faculty at Lviv Polytech Institute in 1933 and then worked as an electrician at Kalush potash plant and later received the job of an engineer at the factory for domestic electric appliances in Warsaw. His first research paper on electrophysics was published in Przeglad electrotechniczny Jour. in 1938. After WW II he come back to Ukraine and linked his career with petroleum industry and passed through all positions from a field engineer to a director of large production enterprise. In 1951 Chekaliuk started to work at Central Research Lab of Ukrnafta Co. in Boryslav, and in 1955 he joined Ukrainian Research Geoexploration Institute (UkrDGRI). Defended his PhD thesis entitled “Non-stationary phenomena of homogeneous liquid inflow from porous medium” at Lviv Polytech Inst. in 1957. A Dr.Sc. dissertation in Engineering “Some thermodynamic phenomena in porous medium and the ways of their application to petroleum industry” was defended in Moscow at All-Union Research Institute for Petroleum (VNIGNI) in 1962. He studied different aspects of reservoir properties, filtration of liquids and gases, physical parameters of deep oils, pay zone testing, production well-logging, oil field development, enhanced oil recovery, thermodynamics of hydrocarbon deposits, liquidation of accidental gas gushers. Since 1964 he worked for Inst. of Geology and Geochemistry of Combustible Minerals, Nat’l Ac. Sci. Ukraine, in Lviv where he headed the Abyssal Hydrocarbons Dept. and coined new scientific trend of petroleum geology, geo-thermodynamics. With his colleagues he developed a principally new technology of enhanced oil recovery from the deep pools (to 3000 m depth) using the water with higher thermodynamic parameters. He has determined the optimal depth to preserve mantlean hydrocarbons and calculated their chemical composition and with his teammates conducted first experiments on high temperature synthesis of hydrocarbon systems in hydrocarbonate medium. Also he studied the problem of hydrocarbon systems kinetic transformation at sedimentary cover conditions. Besides, he interested in theoretical physics and published a fundamental monograph “Gnoseological potential of classical mechanics (to 300th anniversary of Isaac Newton research career)” and several articles on the topic. He generated more than 170 research publications, including 9 monographs and received 14 inventor’s certificates related to hydrocarbon fields development and enhanced oil recovery. His technology applying the special water solution for oil recovery was patented in the UK, Canada, and Mexico. Soviet authorities did not deservedly value Chekaliuk’s work because his own brother was a soldier of Ukrainian Insurgent Army (UPA) and sentenced to 25 years of imprisonment. Therefore, Prof. Chekaliuk had no chance to become a Member of UkrSSR Academy of Sciences, to head the institute or even to travel abroad. Selected publications Chekaliuk E.B, 1961.

  "text" : "Empress Mao (died 237), personal name unknown, formally known as Empress Mingdao, was an empress of the state of Cao Wei during the Three Kingdoms period. She was married to Cao Rui, the second ruler of Wei. Empress Mao became a concubine of Cao Rui's during the reign of his father, Cao Pi. Cao Rui was the Prince of Pingyuan at that time. She was not his wife or princess—that status belonged to Lady Yu. However, Consort Mao was a favored consort of Cao Rui's. When Cao Rui became emperor in 226 following his father's death, it was widely expected that Princess Yu, as his wife, would be created empress. However, Cao Rui created Consort Mao empress instead in 227. Even though her family was of low birth, her father Mao Jia (毛嘉), who was a carpenter, and brother Mao Zeng (毛曾) were promoted to honored posts, and Mao Jia was created a marquess. When Cao Rui became aware that the aristocratic families looked down at his father-in-law, he promoted Mao Jia further and ordered all important officials to attend feasts at the Mao residence. However, as the years went by, Empress Mao began to lose Cao Rui's favor. By 237, Consort Guo had replaced her as Cao Rui's favorite. Once, when Cao Rui was attending a feast hosted by Consort Guo, Consort Guo requested that Empress Mao be invited to join as well, but Cao Rui refused and further ordered that no news about the feast is to be given to Empess Mao. However, the news leaked, and Empress Mao talked about the feast with him anyway. He became exceedingly angry, and killed a number of his attendants whom he suspected of leaking the news to Empress Mao, and, inexplicably, ordered Empress Mao to commit suicide, even though she was still buried with honors due an empress, and her family remained honored."

  "text" : "Edward \"Eddie\" Carlson (June 4, 1911 – April 3, 1990), was an American businessman and Seattle, Washington civic leader. Carlson was born in Tacoma, Washington and, as a youth, helped his single mother make ends meet by working as an attendant at a gas station, as well as other odd jobs. Carlson entered the University of Washington in 1928 and, while a student, began his hotel career as a pageboy, then elevator operator, then bellhop.He dropped out of college in 1930 for financial reasons. He worked half a year as a seaman, then worked a summer job at Mount Baker Lodge, and beginning in autumn 1931 traveled the country in an unsuccessful stint as a salesman trying to sell a machine that mechanically blocked (shaped) felt hats. Returning to Seattle, he returned to hotel work, first as a room clerk and then as assistant manager of Seattle's Roosevelt Hotel, next as manager of the President Hotel in Mount Vernon, Washington. On June 26, 1936, he married Nell H. Cox. In April 1937, Carlson returned to Seattle to manage the Rainier Club, Seattle's preeminent private club.\" He retained that position until he left to join the Navy in 1942; at that time, the club awarded him a military membership, which became a regular membership upon his return from World War II. He finished World War II as a Lieutenant Commander in the Navy Supply Corps, having served in Seattle and then in Mechanicsburg, Pennsylvania Returning from the war, he took a position as assistant to S. W. Thurston, president of Western Hotels, Inc. (later Western International Hotels, then Westin Hotels). Within a year he had been named vice president, then became successively executive vice president (1953), president (1960), and finally chairman and CEO (1969). Westin merged with United Airlines in 1970, and Carlson became CEO of the newly formed company, U.A.L., a position he held from 1971–1979. In his first two years, he turned the almost bankrupt airliner into a profitable one. Carlson is credited in bringing the 1962 World's Fair—the Century 21 Exposition—to Seattle. His napkin sketch of tower with a revolving restaurant on top, inspired by the Stuttgart Tower, was the origin of the Space Needle. Harvard Business School named Carlson one of the great business leaders of the twentieth century. Carlson was also (along with Henry Broderick) one of the two leaders of the successful 1948 initiative that re-legalized the sale of liquor by the drink in Washington State."

He performed the function of leader for agitation and propaganda in the Berlin neighbourhood of Prenzlauer Berg. From 1933, he fought illegally against Nazi domination. In 1935, he was arrested for the first time, and on 2 October 1936, the Berlin Superior Court of Justice (Kammergericht) sentenced him to two years at hard labour in a Zuchthaus. After being released, Knaack joined the illegal organization around Robert Uhrig. On 26 March 1942, he was once again arrested by the Gestapo and taken to Sachsenhausen concentration camp, where he stayed more than two years until his trial. On 6 July 1944, the Volksgerichtshof handed down a death sentence to Knaack. He was executed at Brandenburg-Görden Prison in Brandenburg an der Havel. Knaackstraße, the Ernst Knaack Youth Centre – later known as the Knaack Klub (Greifswalder Straße 224 in Prenzlauer Berg, Berlin) – and the Ernst Knaack Fourth Polytechnic Secondary School (Kastanienallee in Prenzlauer Berg) are named after Ernst Knaack. The stele \"Traditionen der deutschen Arbeiterklasse\" (\"Traditions of the German Working Class\") by Heinz Worner (Knaackstraße 53-67 in Prenzlauer Berg) is dedicated to the murdered antifascists Ernst Knaack and Siegmund Sredzki."

She had a long period of work on the Sunday Times, where she became assistant editor, and from 1944 until her death in 1979 she also wrote for the magazine Country Life. In 1937 Lewis married William Graeme Hendrey and they had one daughter, Katrina. Some of her books were written with her brother Peter. She was a friend of the novelist Charles Langbridge Morgan. In the late 1930s, Lewis was briefly a member of the Peace Pledge Union. In letters written to Andrew Birkin by Nico Llewelyn Davies (part of the family that served as J. M. Barrie's inspiration for Peter Pan) it was suggested that Lewis had once been a girlfriend of Nico's brother Michael: Reverting for a second to Michael's \"girl friends\", I recommend you try to get in touch with Eiluned Lewis (author of \"Dew on the Grass\"). I've no idea whether she and Michael even held hands but she might well have a clue as to his feelings towards girls — and she loved JMB [James Michael Barrie] and all to do with us in those far off days."

  "text" : "Eric Faulkner (born 21 October 1953 as Eric Falconer) is a guitarist, songwriter, and singer, best known as a member of the Scottish pop band, the Bay City Rollers. Faulkner was born at the Edinburgh Royal Infirmary, Edinburgh, Scotland. As a youngster he learned to play the viola and played for a time in a youth orchestra. He is also plays the violin, mandolin, bass and keyboards. Faulkner joined the Bay City Rollers in 1972 as their guitarist, after a period with the group KIP (previously known as Sugar). Faulkner was a member of the Rollers for the remainder of their existence into the 1980s. He wrote more than half of the recorded catalogue of Rollers songs including the UK Singles Chart hits \"Money Honey\" and \"Love Me Like I Love You\". Although the songs were credited \"Faulkner/Wood\", in reality the vast majority were penned by Faulkner alone, many written before he had even joined the band. It was late in the band's career before any true collaboration took place. In 1976, during the Rollers heyday, Faulkner made headlines for an alleged parasuicide attempt via sleeping pill overdose. The incident was turned into a media opportunity by Bay City Rollers manager, Tam Paton who allegedly phoned the press before emergency services; Faulkner maintains the overdose was accidental and not a suicide attempt. In the 1990s, he worked as lead singer of a reformed version of the Bay City Rollers, which also featured Alan Longmuir, Stuart Wood and singer Karen \"Kass\" Prosser. He also toured with his own band, The Eric Faulkner Co-operative that he founded with Kass. Faulkner performed at Guilfest 2006 with 3 Men & Black, featuring Pauline Black from The Selecter. During the set he led a tribute to the late Syd Barrett and sang \"See Emily Play\", as well as \"Radio Heaven\", a recent song he penned, and a rendition of the Bay City Rollers hit \"Shang-a-Lang\". Faulkner continued to perform with 3 Men & Black as a support act on their 2006 concert tour. In 2007, Faulkner continued as a solo artist and appeared at the Glastonbury Festival as a protest singer in support of British politician Tony Benn. arranged for him to end his performance by introducing Tony Benn on the Left Field stage under the banner \"Another World is Possible\". He also performs all the old favourite Roller tunes as Eric Faulkner's Bay City Rollers at festivals such as Rebellion and Mathew Street. Recent festival performances for his solo acoustic set have included The Acoustic Festival of Britain, Fèis Ìle (Islay Festival of Music and Malt), Parkfest and The Edinburgh Guitar and Music Festival. Faulkner and the five other former Bay City Rollers members filed a lawsuit in 2007 against Arista Records, which alleged a breach of contract for unpaid royalties."

  "text" : "Emma Brockes (born 1975) is a British author and a contributor to The Guardian and The New York Times. She lives in New York. The daughter of a South-African born mother, Brockes read English at St Edmund Hall, Oxford University graduating in 1997 with a first. At Oxford, she was editor of the student newspaper Cherwell and won the Philip Geddes prize for journalism for her work. She worked briefly as feature writer on The Scotsman, before joining The Guardian in 1997. She has been recognised by the British Press Awards three times, winning the 'Young Journalist of the Year' award in 2001 and the 'Feature Writer of the Year' award in 2002. She was nominated as 'Interviewer of the Year' in 2006. In 2005, an interview by Brockes in The Guardian was described by its subject Noam Chomsky as a \"scurrilous piece of journalism\". The Guardian later withdrew the article from the website, acknowledging \"Ms Brockes's misrepresentation of Prof Chomsky's views on Srebrenica\", and offering \"an unreserved apology to Prof Chomsky\" for Brockes's suggestion that Chomsky denied Srebrenica to be a massacre. Historian Marko Attila Hoare derided the newspaper as \"spineless\" and the readers' editors response as \"grovelling\" partly on the basis that Chomsky had defended the content of a book by Diana Johnstone, rather than solely her right to publish. An external ombudsman review determined that the \"Readers' Editor was right to conclude that an apology and correction was deserved\", though adding that \"the removal of the original interview from the website was unnecessary and over responsive\", a view that Chomsky himself shared. The text of the original can now be found on Chomsky's official website. Brockes's first book What Would Barbra Do?  was published in 2007. The New York Times Book Review responded \"Spirited, articulate and utterly devourable ... If I could offer [Brockes] any advice, it would be ... to write as many books on as many subjects as she can, as fast as is reasonably possible.\" Another book She Left Me the Gun: My Mother's Life Before Me (London: Faber) appeared in 2013. She is now a freelance writer, but continues to write profiles of major public figures for The Guardian, as well as contributing her own work to The New York Times and other publications."

Throughout the show, Jack Benny and his cast often referred to \"Twombly, the sound-effects man.\" Eventually, a character named Twombly (voiced by Mel Blanc) appeared on the show, as an inept sound-effects man who was constantly interrupting Benny and his cast with impromptu sound effects. Later, while Bea Benaderet was co-starring in The Beverly Hillbillies as Cousin Pearl, a character, Dr. Eugene Twombly was introduced as an overly curious, bedazzled, and befuddled psychiatrist, unable to grasp (or get them to overcome) their extremely simple ways. This was a two-episode feature, and arguably, two of their funniest episodes. Gene Twombly was Bea Benaderet's second husband. He died of a heart attack on October 17, 1968, the day of Benaderet's funeral, four days after her death. She had been ill with lung cancer for more than a year. They are interred together at Valhalla Memorial Park Cemetery (Mausoleum of Hope, Row C, Crypt 34) in North Hollywood, California."

Not much is known about her, other than that her grandfather, Zhen Yan (甄儼), was a brother of Cao Fang's adoptive father Cao Rui's mother, Lady Zhen (posthumously honored Empress Wenzhao). Cao Fang created her empress in 243. She died in 251 and was buried with honors due an empress. (The reason her posthumous name was one character rather than two was because her husband was eventually deposed in 254, and therefore never given a posthumous imperial name; the customs at the time generally dictated that the empress' posthumous name carry one character from their husbands'.)"

  "text" : "For the former German football player, see Erwin Stein. Erwin Stein (7 November 1885 – 17 July 1958) was an Austrian musician and writer, prominent as a pupil and friend of Schoenberg, with whom he studied between 1906 and 1910. He was one of Schoenberg's principal assistants in organizing the Society for Private Musical Performances. In 1924 it was Stein to whom Schoenberg entrusted the delicate as well as important task of writing the first article – Neue Formprinzipien ('New Formal Principles') – on the gradual evolution of what was soon to be explicitly formulated as 'twelve tone technique'. Until 1938 he lived in Vienna, where he was respected as a music teacher and conductor as well as a writer active on behalf of the music and composers he valued. After the Anschluss he fled to London to escape the Nazis and worked for many years as an editor for the music publishers Boosey & Hawkes. His focus was mainly on Mahler, Schoenberg and Britten (all three of whom he knew personally) as well as his colleagues within the Schoenberg circle, Berg and Webern. His books include Orpheus in New Guises (a collection of writings from the period 1924–1953) and Form and Performance (1962). He was the editor of the first collection of Schoenberg's letters (Germany 1958; UK 1964). He was also instrumental in setting up the modern music periodical Tempo in 1939. Stein married Sophie Bachmann (1883?–1965), and their daughter, the pianist Marion Stein, married successively George Lascelles, 7th Earl of Harewood and the Liberal politician Jeremy Thorpe."

  "text" : "Edward Arthur Donald St George Hamilton Chichester, 6th Marquess of Donegall (7 October 1903 – 24 May 1975), was a British peer and journalist. He succeeded to the title on the death of his father in 1904. His other titles included those of Viscount Chichester and Baron of Belfast, Earl of Donegall, Earl of Belfast, and Baron Fisherwick. He was also the Hereditary Lord High Admiral of Lough Neagh. After being educated at École nouvelle de la Suisse romande, Eton and Christ Church, Oxford, he adopted a career in journalism and for many years wrote a column for the Sunday Dispatch under the title \"Almost in Confidence\". He made regular contributions to the Sunday News and Sunday Graphic, and held at the same time a staff position on the Daily Sketch. As a journalist he travelled extensively, notably covering the winter sports in St Moritz, Switzerland. He was a passenger on the maiden trip of the Queen Mary, returning on the Hindenburg. The Marquess had a lifelong interest in aviation and owned his own aircraft, which he used for pursuing news stories. He covered the Spanish Civil War and was a distinguished British war correspondent throughout the Second World War. His interest extended to cars and he was President of the Middlesex County Automobile Club from 1964 until his death in 1975. In 1949 he became a disc jockey with the BBC and in 1956 ran a Dixieland band and a jazz club in Kensington. He was also the owner of a record company. He was a long-time member of the Sherlock Holmes Society of London, and edited its magazine, the Sherlock Holmes Journal, for many years. In that context and others, he told friends and acquaintances not to stand on ceremony (\"My Lord Marquess\") but not to use his first names either: \"Call me Don!\" In 1943 he married Gladys Jean Combe, younger daughter of Captain Christian Combe. He parted from his wife after 10 years, and in 1962 moved to Switzerland. In 1968 the Marquess was granted a divorce under Swiss law and in that same year he married Mrs Maureen McKenzie, daughter of Major G C Schofield, MC, of Birkdale, Lancashire. At the time of his death, the Marquess was working on his autobiography, which he planned to call Almost in Confidence, after the newspaper column he had run. It was not ready for publication before he died. He died in Switzerland on 24 May 1975 at the age of 71. His second wife and widow died in 1999."

Professor Delabarre was a pioneer in the field of shape perception and on the interaction between mental processes and the involuntary movements of the body. He became famous, particularly in Portugal, because of his interpretation of the inscriptions present on the surface of Dighton Rock, a boulder on the shore of the Taunton River, south-eastern Massachusetts, attributing the carvings to Miguel Corte-Real, a Portuguese navigator who left Lisbon in May 1502 on an exploration trip to the western Atlantic, never to return. Delabarre claimed that the stone bears carvings of the Coat of arms of Portugal, the name of Miguel Corte-Real, and the date 1511. In 1899, Delabarre was instrumental in formation of the University Club in Providence"

  "text" : "Elmar Altvater (born 24 August 1938 in Kamen, Province of Westphalia) was Professor of Political Science at the Otto-Suhr-Institut of the Free University of Berlin, before retiring on 30 September 2004. He continues to work at the Institute, and to publish articles and books. As a student, Altvater studied economics and sociology in Munich, and attained a doctorate with a dissertation on \"Environmental Problems in the Soviet Union\". At the Otto-Suhr-Institut, he was active in socialist research groups, working with among others Klaus Busch, Wolfgang Schoeller and Frank Seelow, and he gained fame as one of Germany's most important Marxist philosophers, who strongly influenced the political and economic theory of the 1968 generation of radicals. His analysis, centered on the logic of capital accumulation crisis in state interventions is key to the Marxist theory of \"state-derivationism.\" Altvater argues that the state performs four general maintenance functions particular capitalists cannot undertake: providing an initial legal system with property and contract law, regulating the class struggle between workers and owners of capital, enforcing terms of international trade and market expansion through military presence, and providing infrastructure. In 1970, he co-founded the German journal PROKLA - Journal for Critical Social Science  of which he remains an editor. In 1971 he became university professor in political economy at the Otto-Suhr-Institut. Apart from questions of development theory, the debt crisis, and the regulation of markets, he remains preoccupied with the effects of capitalist economies on the environment. Altvater is a noted critic of \"political economy\" and author of numerous writings on globalization and critiques of capitalism. A standard work is his book The Limits of Globalization (1996), written with his companion Birgit Mahnkopf. Altvater supported the German Greens for some time, but after the military intervention in Kosovo (which as a member of the governing coalition the party had to support) increasingly maintained a critical distance. He was a member of the Bundestag Commission of Inquiry The World Economy - Challenges and Answers (1999–2002). Nowadays he is a supporter of ATTAC (he is a member of its Scientific Advisory Board) and the World Social Forum."

  "text" : "Ende (or En) was a female manuscript illuminator who worked on a 10th-century group of manuscripts, of which there are 24 known copies with illustrations. These manuscripts contain the Commentary on the Apocalypse compiled by the Spanish monk Beatus of Liébana in 786. Her signature appears in the Beatus located now at the Girona cathedral, known as Girona Beatus but maybe she worked in some other codex. The manuscripts were created in a monastery in the mountains of Leon in northwest Spain. There are a number of hands discernible in the manuscripts. The chief painter was likely a priest called Senior. Historians have also attributed elements of the manuscripts to Emetrius, whose style is attributable in comparison to an earlier signed work. The third attributable hand is that of Ende. She signed the work as DEPINTRIX (painter) and DIE AIUTRIX (helper of god). She was probably a nun. The illuminations illustrate the Apocalyptic Vision of St. John the Divine in the Book of Revelation in the Mozarabic style. This style developed in Spain after the Muslim invasions, blending elements of Islamic art and decorative traditions, particularly the emphasis on geometry, rich colors, ornamented grounds, and stylized figures."

  "text" : "Ernst Badian (August 8, 1925 – February 1, 2011) was an Austrian-born classical scholar who served as a professor at Harvard University, United States, from 1971 to 1998. Badian was one of the leading historians of Greece and Rome of the 20th century. He was born in Vienna in 1925. In 1938, in view of the growing persecution of Jews in Austria and Germany, he moved with his parents to New Zealand. There he attended Canterbury College, receiving a B.A. in 1945 and an M.A. the following year. He then went to University College, Oxford, studying under George Cawkwell and getting a B.A. (First Class in Litt. Hum.) in 1950, an M.A. in 1954, and D. Phil. in 1956. In addition, he took a Litt. D. from New Zealand's Victoria University of Wellington in 1962. After teaching in the universities of Sheffield, Durham, and Leeds in Britain, and at the State University of New York, Buffalo, he was appointed to Harvard’s Department of History in 1971, and was cross-appointed to the Department of the Classics in 1973. He became John Moors Cabot Professor of History Emeritus in 1998. Badian was elected a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1974. An active promoter of classical studies in the United States, he helped found The American Journal of Ancient History (1976), the Association of Ancient Historians (1974), and the New England Ancient History Colloquium. In 1999 Austria awarded him the Cross of Honor for Science and Art (Österreichische Ehrenkreuz für Wissenschaft und Kunst). Badian died at the age of 85 after a fall in his Quincy, Massachusetts, home. He was survived by his widow Nathlie, his children Hugh and Rosemary, and several grandchildren and great-grandchildren. The Ernst Badian Collection of Roman Republican Coins is housed by the Special Collections and University Archives of the Rutgers University libraries. At the 2012 meeting of the Association of Ancient Historians in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, ancient historians T. Corey Brennan and Jerzy Linderski delivered papers reflecting on the historical methodologies employed by Badian."

Edward Brennan was born in Chicago into a family of Sears associates: his grandfather, father and uncles all worked there, and his younger brother, Bernard F. Brennan, left Sears for the rival Chicago-based retailer Montgomery Ward and became its CEO in 1985. His mother, who also worked at Sears, left the family and went to Mexico when he was young; he worked after school to pay for bus trips with his brother to visit her. He attended Marquette University while working for Benson and Rixon, a menswear store where he had started work at 15 and where he rose to be a high-level manager before joining Sears in 1956. In March 1980 his predecessor as CEO, Edward R. Telling, appointed him president with the task of reinvigorating the company's stores. The following January the managerial structure was changed and he became chairman and CEO of the \"Merchant\" side of the company, a position he held until being appointed CEO of the company in August 1984, after which he also served as president again until Telling's retirement from the position of Chairman of the Board on January 1, 1986. During his first period as president and his chairmanship of the merchandising division, he turned around the performance of the company's stores by introducing \"challenge sales\" and by building and renovating Sears stores in a scientifically developed \"Store of the Future\" format, while closing aged and under-performing stores including the original Chicago store. As CEO, although in 1985 he presided over the introduction of the Discover Card, the first new major credit card in twenty years, during the 1990s he dismantled the conglomerate that Telling had assembled, spinning off Discover, Dean Witter, Coldwell Banker, the Sears Mortgage Banking Group, and also Allstate Insurance, which was founded in 1931 as part of Sears. During his chairmanship, the company also mortgaged and ultimately gave up and moved out of its headquarters, the Sears Tower. Brennan also served on the boards of 3M, Exelon, McDonalds, and AMR Corporation, where he was chairman of the board in 2003–04 and enabled the company to avoid bankruptcy."

  "text" : "Eva Schulze-Knabe (11 May 1907 - 15 July 1976) was a German painter and graphic artist, as well as a resistance fighter against the Third Reich. Born in Pirna, Saxony, Eva Schulze-Knabe studied from 1924 to 1926 in Leipzig and from 1928 to 1932 at the Dresden Art Academy. From 1929 she was a member of the artists' group ASSO, and from 1931 she was a member of the Communist Party of Germany (KPD). The same year, she married the artist Fritz Schulze. She was arrested in 1933 and 1934 and confined at Hohnstein concentration camp. In 1941 and 1942, she was tried before the Volksgerichtshof at Münchner Platz in Dresden, where she was sentenced to life in labour prison (Zuchthaus). After being freed from Waldheim labour prison in 1945, she lived as a freelancer in Dresden and received Dresden's Martin Andersen Nexö Art Prize in 1959. Moreover, she oversaw the painting and drawing circle founded in 1848 at the Sachsenwerk (a factory) in Niedersedlitz (part of Dresden). The Demokratischer Frauenbund Deutschlands (Democratic Women's Association of Germany, an East German organization), Group 540, bore her name. She died in Dresden in 1976."

A 1905 graduate of Barnard College, she also took courses at the New York School of Philanthropy before securing employment as a researcher of wage earners, both female and child, in Jersey City, New Jersey, Pittsburgh, and Baltimore. Beginning in 1907 she worked for Paul Kellogg's Pittsburgh Survey, funded by the Russell Sage Foundation. Her resulting 1909 book, Women and the Trades, was the first large survey of wage-earning women in America and the first of the six volumes of the Survey. Butler died of tuberculosis at age 26 in Saranac Lake, New York. Her final book, Saleswomen in Mercantile Stores: Baltimore, 1909, was posthumously published by the Russell Sage Foundation in 1912."

  "text" : "Eduard Andreevich Stoeckl (Russian: Эдуард Андреевич Стекль) (Constantinople 1804 – Paris 1892) was a Russian diplomat best known today for having negotiated the American purchase of Alaska on behalf of the Russian government. He was son of Andreas von Stoeckl, Austrian diplomat in Constantinople, and Maria Pisani, daughter of Nicolas Pisani, Russian dragoman in Constantinople. He died in Paris on January 26, 1892. In 1850 he became chargé d'affaires of the Russian embassy in Washington, and in 1854 held the post of minister, vacant after death of Aleksandr Bodisko. Like his predecessor, Stoeckl married an American woman, Elisa Howard. Stoeckl established close friendly relations with many American officials and politicians, including the senator and the future Secretary of State William H. Seward, with whom he would later negotiate the Alaska purchase. Stoeckl advocated the sale of Alaska (then known as Russian America) to the United States, asserting that this would allow the Russian government to concentrate its resources on Eastern Siberia, particularly the Amur River area. He insisted that by doing so, Russia would avoid any future conflict with the United States, viewing further U.S. expansion in North America as inevitable."

She was the last wife and the only empress of Liu Bei, the founding emperor of Shu Han, and a younger sister of Wu Yi (吳懿). Her father, whose name is not recorded in history, was a friend of Liu Yan, and followed Liu Yan to Yi Province (益州; covering present-day Sichuan and Chongqing) when Liu Yan was made the governor. Because of the friendship between her father and Liu Yan, she was married to Liu Yan's son Liu Mao (劉瑁). After Liu Mao's death, she did not remarry for some time. When Liu Bei seized Yi Province from Lady Wu's brother-in-law Liu Zhang in 214, he had been effectively divorced from his wife Lady Sun, the younger sister of Sun Quan. He married Lady Wu. When he claimed for himself the title of the \"King of Hanzhong\" in 219, he made her his queen consort. After the fall of the Eastern Han Dynasty in 220 (with Emperor Xian's abdication to Cao Pi), Liu Bei claimed for himself the Han imperial title in 221, establishing Shu. Later that year, he made her empress. After his death in 223, his son and successor Liu Shan honoured her as empress dowager. She died in 245. (The Records of the Three Kingdoms is inconsistent in stating whether she, or Liu Shan's mother Lady Gan, was buried with Liu Bei.)"

During that period, he was elected Cathaoirleach (chairman) of the Council on several occasions and was a prominent member of the Association of County and City Councils.

  "text" : "Ewen Adair Whitaker (22 June 1922 – 11 October 2016) was a British-born astronomer who has specialized in Lunar studies since 1951. During WW2 he was engaged in quality control—by UV spectrographic analysis—of the lead sheathing of hollow cables strung under the English Channel as part of the secret Project PLUTO (Pipe Line Under The Ocean) to supply gasoline to Allied military vehicles in France. After the war he obtained a position at the Royal Greenwich Observatory working on the UV spectra of stars, but became interested in lunar studies. As a sideline, Whitaker drew and published in 1954 the first accurate chart of the South Polar area of the Moon and served as director of the Lunar Section of the British Astronomical Association. After meeting Dr. Gerard P. Kuiper, Director of Yerkes Observatory, Wisconsin, USA, at an International Astronomical Union meeting in Dublin in 1955, he was invited to join Kuiper's fledgling Lunar Project at Yerkes to work on producing a high-quality photographic atlas of the moon. The dawn of the Space Age with the launch of the Russian Sputnik 1 soon put the Lunar Project in NASA's limelight. In 1960 Whitaker followed Kuiper to the University of Arizona where the small Lunar Project evolved into the Lunar and Planetary Laboratory (LPL) with over 300 scientists, technicians, and supporting staff. The resulting Photographic Lunar Atlas, Orthographic Atlas of the Moon (giving accurate positions on the lunar surface), and the Rectified Lunar Atlas (giving astronaut-eye views of the whole lunar nearside) proved to be invaluable for the planning and operational stages of later spacecraft missions to the moon. Whitaker was involved with several NASA missions, including successfully locating the landing site of the Surveyor 3. This was used to set the landing site for the Apollo 12 mission whose astronauts visited the Surveyor lander. Whitaker has been considered by some to be the world's leading expert on lunar mapping and nomenclature. He has been active in the IAU's Task Group for Lunar Nomenclature. In 1999 he published a book on the history of lunar mapping and nomenclature, titled \"Mapping and Naming the Moon.\" Ewen Whitaker retired from the LPL in 1978 becoming research scientist emeritus. He resided in Tucson, Arizona and died on 11 October 2016. His wife Beryl died in 2013."

  "text" : "Elie Siegmeister (also published under pseudonym L. E. Swift; January 15, 1909 in New York City – March 10, 1991 in Manhasset, New York) was an American composer, educator and author. His varied musical output showed his concern with the development of an authentic American musical vocabulary. Jazz, blues and folk melodies and rhythms are frequent themes in his many song cycles, his nine operas, his eight symphonies, and his many choral, chamber, and solo works. His 37 orchestral works have been performed by leading orchestras throughout the world under such conductors as Arturo Toscanini, Leopold Stokowski, Dimitri Mitropoulos, Lorin Maazel, and Sergiu Comissiona. He also composed for Hollywood (notably, the film score of They Came to Cordura, starring Gary Cooper and Rita Hayworth, 1959) and Broadway (Sing Out, Sweet Land, 1944, book by Walter Kerr). His Western Suite was premiered by Toscanini and the NBC Symphony Orchestra during a broadcast concert on November 25, 1945, in NBC Studio 8-H. Maurice Abravanel and the Utah Symphony Orchestra later made a stereo recording of the music, which incorporates familiar cowboy tunes. Biographer Mortimer Frank said Toscanini's premiere (preserved on transcription discs) is a remarkable performance led by a conductor whose roots went not to the Old West but the Parma conservatory. Siegmeister wrote a number of important books on music, among them \"Treasury of American Song\" (Knopf, 1940–43, text coauthored with Olin Downs, music arranged by Siegmeister), second edition revised and enlarged (Consolidated Music Publishers); \"The Music Lover's Handbook\" (William Morrow, 1943; Book-of-the-Month Club selection), revised and expanded as \"The New Music Lover's Handbook\" (1973); and the two-volume \"Harmony and Melody\" (Wadsworth, 1985), which was widely adopted by college and conservatory curricula. In 1960, Siegmeister also recorded and released an instructional album of music, Invitation to Music, on Folkways Records, on which he discusses the fundamentals of music. From 1977 until his death, he served on the Board of Directors of ASCAP and chaired its Symphony and Concert Committee. Among his signal achievements, he was composer-in-residence at Hofstra University 1966-76, having organized and conducted the Hofstra Symphony Orchestra; established 1971 and chaired the Council of Creative Artists, Libraries, and Museums; and initiated 1978 the Kennedy Center's National Black Music competition. In 1939, he organized the American Ballad Singers, pioneers in the folk music renaissance whom he conducted for eight years in performances throughout the United States. He was the winner of numerous awards and commissions, among them those of the Guggenheim, Ford, and Elizabeth Sprague Coolidge Foundations, the Library of Congress, the National Endowment for the Arts, and the USIA. Siegmeister earned a B.A. cum laude at the age of 18 from Columbia University, where he had studied music theory with Seth Bingham. He studied conducting with Albert Stoessel at the Juilliard School and counterpoint with Wallingford Riegger. He was among the numerous American composers, including Aaron Copland and Virgil Thomson, who were students of the influential teacher Nadia Boulanger in Paris. The best known of his own students was Stephen Albert (1941–92), winner of a 1985 Pulitzer Prize for music. For other students, See: List of music students by teacher: R to S#Elie Siegmeister."

  "text" : "Joseph Eric Buhain (born April 12, 1970) is the chairman of the Philippines' Games and Amusement Board. Buhain is also a champion swimmer, winning several Southeast Asian Games medals for the Philippines and participating in the 1988 and 1992 Summer Olympics. Eric ventured into swimming not because he dreamed of winning an Olympic gold medal, but because his doctor advised him to venture into sports to improve his lungs. Eric was born with Primary Lung Complex. He enrolled in a two-week swimming program at the age of seven. Yet his training was breached by another illness, hepatitis. However, this didn't stop him; a year later he was training again and taking the advance course in swimming, the competitive course, at age nine. It was at this age that he got into the varsity swimming team of De La Salle-Santiago Zobel School and vowed to win a gold medal in the sport. By 1981, he was a member of the Philippine Team and swam in the 400-meter individual medley at age eleven. But it was in his first Southeast Asian Games in 1985, held in Bangkok, Thailand, where he snatched the gold in the same category at the age of fifteen. He participated in the 1988 Summer Olympics and was also chosen as the country's flag bearer for the opening ceremonies. In the 1989 Southeast Asian Games in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, Buhain broke one of the existing SEA Games swimming records. In the 1991 Southeast Asian Games, where the Philippines was the host, he made a huge contribution to the gold medal record of the host country by winning most of the events in swimming. With great jubilation, he was chosen to represent the Philippines in the 1992 Summer Olympics. Unfortunately he didn't win any medals in that sporting event. Even though he won several gold medals in the 1993 Southeast Asian Games, Buhain decided to retire from his swimming career. He was disappointed on poor government management that led to a mediocre performance of the Philippine team in that sporting event. In 2001, President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo appointed Buhain as the chairman of the Philippine Sports Commission after learning the Philippines poor international ranking in sports. He instituted reforms that led to protest to some commissioners and employees. In 2003, the Philippines increased its rank in the medal tally in the Southeast Asian Games and the country won several medals in the 2002 Asian Games after getting only a bronze medal in the 1998 Asian Games. Barely six months before the 2005 Southeast Asian Games he was appointed by President Arroyo as the chairman of the Games and Amusement Board, a public agency that handles professional sporting and gambling events."

  "text" : "Eddie Jack Jordan Jr. (born October 6, 1952), was the district attorney for Orleans Parish, Louisiana from 2003 until 2007, when he resigned. A member of the Democratic Party, Jordan was the first African American to have held the elected position. He announced his resignation on October 30, 2007, when a court rendered a large judgment against his office on behalf of white employees that the D.A. had earlier dismissed on account of their race. Jordan was born to Mr. and Mrs. Eddie J. Jordan Sr. He grew up in the middle class Pontchartrain Park neighborhood of the Ninth Ward of New Orleans. He graduated from Wesleyan University in Middletown, Connecticut in 1974, and was then awarded a scholarship to the Rutgers University School of Law in New Jersey, from which he graduated in 1977. After being admitted to the bar and practicing in Pennsylvania for some four years, Jordan returned to Louisiana in 1981 to teach law at Southern University in Baton Rouge. He became a member of the Louisiana bar the following year. In 1984 Jordan returned to New Orleans to serve as assistant U.S. attorney under then-U.S. Attorney John Volz, a Republican appointed by U.S. President Ronald W. Reagan. In 1994, Jordan he was named United States Attorney for the Eastern District of Louisiana by his fellow Democrat, President Bill Clinton. As U.S. Attorney, he supervised the prosecution of Governor Edwin Washington Edwards which resulted in the imprisonment of Edwards and several conspirators. Jordan has been criticized for not also having indicted former U.S. Representative Cleo Fields as an Edwards conspirator despite Federal Bureau of Investigation video showing Fields stuffing $20,000 into his pockets. Jordan became a well-known figure on television with his trademark moustache and derby hat. In 2001, Jordan retired as U.S. attorney to enter private practice. On November 5, 2002, Jordan was elected district attorney to succeed the retiring Harry Connick Sr. (father of singer Harry Connick Jr.). Jordan defeated fellow Democrat Dale Atkins, 62,155 votes (52 percent) to 57,977 (48 percent). In the October 5 primary, six Democrats and one Republican had filed for the office. The combined Democratic candidates polled 98 percent of the primary vote in the historically Democratic city and parish. Jordan took office in 2003. A jury determined that Jordan violated employment discrimination laws when, after having taken office, he ordered the wholesale firing of white employees and replaced almost all of them with black workers. New Orleans, which since Hurricane Katrina has balanced its budget by securing federal loans, will have to determine a way to pay Jordan's legal tab or risk watching the prosecutors' office shut down for financial reasons. Mayor C. Ray Nagin said that the city cannot pay the judgment rendered to the former white employees. On March 30, 2005, Jordan was found liable for racial discrimination by a federal jury for the mass firing of forty-three white employees immediately after he took office. These employees were replaced almost entirely by African Americans. As a result of Jordan being found liable while acting in his \"capacity as a public official\", the Orleans Parish District Attorney's Office was required to pay $2.4 million to the plaintiffs. Jordan lost an appeal of the case. On December 28, 2006, a grand jury indicted seven New Orleans Police Department officers on first-degree murder charges for the death of two men on the Danzinger Bridge in the turmoil after Hurricane Katrina (see NOPD for more information). While he was celebrated for his supervision of the Edwards trial, Jordan has not garnered similar praise for his performance as district attorney. Under Jordan's reign, the murder and attempted murder conviction rate was only 12 percent in 2003 and 2004, compared to the 80 percent national average. His office also had an overall prosecution rate of only 7 percent Jordan has also faced widespread criticism for releasing suspects in high-profile murder cases. In July 2007, Jordan released Michael Anderson, a suspect in the murders of five teens. Jordan said that his office was unable to find a key witness in the case; the NOPD subsequently held a press conference a short time later, at which police officials presented the witness. As of mid-2007, many in New Orleans had voiced complaints about Jordan regarding the low conviction rates of murderers at a time of rising violent crime. On July 12, 2007, City Council member Shelley Midura called for Jordan's resignation. Jordan's performance led State Senator-elect Steve Scalise to call for the D.A.'s impeachment. Jordan's performance was an issue in the November 17, 2007 general election for Louisiana attorney general. Republican candidate Royal Alexander called for Jordan's ouster even before the D.A. stepped down. On the other hand, Democratic candidate and eventual winner of the election Buddy Caldwell was noncommital on the Jordan case. Eddie Jordan has been a close political ally of embattled New Orleans Congressman William Jefferson, a fellow Democrat. As the pressure built against him, Jordan resigned as District Attorney. In 2005, Jordan was inducted into the Louisiana Political Museum and Hall of Fame in Winnfield."

  "text" : "Ella Cora Hind (September 18, 1861 – October 6, 1942) was Western Canada's first female journalist and a women's rights activist. On September 18, 1861, a woman by the name of Ella Cora Hind was born in Toronto. Ella Hind is the daughter of Edwin Hind and Jane Carroll. Ella was Edwin and Jane Carroll’s third child. She had two brothers by the name of Joseph and George. These three children lost their parents at a young age. Ella was only two years old when she lost her mother Jane Carol Hind. Later after losing their mom, her mother and father’s family come down near Toronto to be near the children. Not long after that Joseph, George, and Ella than moved in with their grandfather Joseph Hind. Their father was always working, which made it had to attend to the kids so because of their fathers hard work he thought it would be best if the kids were relocated to a farm in Ontario with their grandfather. A few years after being away from their dad he died in Chicago from cholera while working in 1866. After losing her parents Cora and her grandfather became very close. Cora’s grandfather taught her about farming, horses, and cattle. These were helpful tools that would help her in the future. Living with her grandfather they lived off livestock and grain. This was hard, because growing livestock some years were better than others. Cora also grew up several miles away from school. This delayed her education until she was eleven, so her aunt Alice taught her at home until 1872 when they built a school; on her grandfather’s land. Her family finally relocated to Flesherton, Ontario where Cora finished her primary education. In Orillia, Ontario where Cora lived with her uncle George Hind, and completed high school. This is where she wrote her third class teacher examination. After high school Cora moved with her Aunt Alice and Cousins Jean and Jacques out west, because her cousins told her teachers were needed in Manitoba. By the time Ella became old enough to better her education she attended the Collegiate Institute of Orillia, Ontario. In 1882 when Cora arrived in Winnipeg instead of going to Manitoba they decided it was best to begin their lives in Winnipeg. Cora’s Aunt ran a dressing shop to earn enough to live, but a few weeks later Cora received a letter saying that she failed her algebra part of the teacher’s exam, which stated that her credentials were inadequate. This did not affect her because she had dreams of becoming a journalist. So Cora took the time out to get in contact with her Uncle George’s friend W. F. Luxton. He had a friend that was an editor of the Manitoba Free Press. The editor Luxton told her “that a newspaper office was no place for a woman who was totally inexperienced.” A few months later Cora decided to write an article and sent it to Luxton the editor of Manitoba Free Press. He accepted the letter, but chose not to acknowledge her as an author. This situation forced her into becoming a typist. “She worked there until 1893, when she opened her own business as a stenographer .” Ella became the first public typewriter in Manitoba. Now that Ella Cora Hinds was doing well for herself, she and her Aunt Alice joined The Women’s Christian Temperance Union. Woman's Christian Temperance Union (WCTU) is the oldest continuing non-sectarian women's organization worldwide. Founded in Evanston, Illinois in 1873, the group spearheaded the crusade for prohibition. Cora also linked up with Dr. Amelia Yeomans, because she wanted women to have rights to vote. They both formed Manitoba Equal Suffrage Club. Their motto was “Peace on earth, good will towards men.\" Cora Hind and Dr. Yeomans worked hard to improve the lives of women and the poor, Cora than became a member of The Winnipeg Chapter of Canadian Women's Press Club. Along with all of the duties that Ella had dedicated herself she still had a strong interest in farming. Living in Winnipeg and knowing about the grain trade center of the west, Cora finally became a regular reporter and the commercial and agricultural editor of the Manitoba Free Press. J. W. Dafoe was the editor of the paper helped Cora become a famous for her accurate analysis of crop yields, and other livestock. Cora Hind then formed the Political Equality League with Lillian Beynon Thomas and Nellie McClung in 1912. Their campaign for women’s voting rights later were granted in 1916. After all her successful movements in life she received many honors from The Western Canada Livestock Union, Wool Grower's of Manitoba, and Canadian Society of Technical Agriculturists. The University of Manitoba also presented her with an honorary LLD degree in 1935. Cora died in 1942 and the United Grain Growers created the Cora Hind Fellowship for research in agriculture, and the Free Press created the Cora Hind Scholarship in home economics."

It is alleged that he stole the lead off his own church roof to sell for scrap. He also impregnated several of his housekeepers, allowed swine to desecrate the graveyard, and had been publicly abusive, both sober and drunk. His downfall came when he attempted to get the churchwarden Montagu Burgoyne fined for non-attendance at church using a law passed during the reign of Elizabeth I. He was removed from his living at the parish in 1830. He died in 1843 when a cart hit him in a road accident."

Jewish by ethnicity and a native of Kiev, Bystritskaya was chosen to play Axinia by Sholokhov himself over several distinguished candidates, notably Nonna Mordyukova. Before that, she co-starred with Sergey Bondarchuk in the Unfinished Story, an archetypal Socialist Realist film. In the 1960s, Bystritskaya turned to theatre work in the Maly Theatre and her appearances on screen grew sporadic. She was named People's Artist of the USSR in 1978. 20 February 2014 Bystritskaya together with a group of other Ukrainians in Russia appealed to the President of Ukraine Viktor Yanukovych to end the Euromaidan and arrest its participants whom they accused of being anti-Russian and followers of Stepan Bandera. On 11 March 2014, in a similar appeal, she expressed support for the 2014 Russian annexation of Crimea."

  "text" : "Eligius Fromentin (1767 – October 6, 1822) was an American politician. Fromentin was born and raised in France, where he later became a Roman Catholic priest. Fromentin fled the country during the French Revolution and arrived in the United States. He at first settled in Pennsylvania, but then moved to Maryland, where he was a schoolteacher and a priest. By the early 19th century, Fromentin decided to leave the church and moved to Louisiana, which was being purchased by the United States. He settled in New Orleans, Louisiana, and became a lawyer. Fromentin was a member of the territorial house of representatives from 1807 to 1811. He was part of the constitutional convention that developed Louisiana's state constitution when it became a state in 1812. In 1813, he was elected to the United States Senate from Louisiana, and served for one term, retiring in 1819. He may have been the first former priest to serve in Congress. Fromentin was elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society in 1814. Upon his retirement, Fromentin returned to Louisiana and became judge of the New Orleans criminal court in 1821. He soon left this position to become a federal judge in Florida, but resigned from that position as well. Fromentin then returned to New Orleans, where he died the following year."

  "text" : "Enrico Viarisio (3 December 1897 in Turin – 1 November 1967 in Milan) was an Italian theatre and cinema actor. Equipped of a fine and elegant humour, Viarisio was discovered by actress Paola Pezzaglia, who cast him at 19 as \"brillante\" in her own theatre company. His career continued with the role of amoroso or male lover in the Carini-Gentili-Betrone theatre company, then passed to Talli-Melato-Betrone, Antonio Gandusio, Dyne Galli, and Nino Besozzi, and the Merlini-Cialente-Bagni company. To raise the company's small profits, Viarisio became the repertory comedian. Bourgeois audiences appreciated Viarisio's \"brilliance\" — richly communicative, effervescent, and perfectly to their comfort — in amusing light comedies. In the sentimental comedies and white-telephone cinema of the 1930s, Viarisio was a constant figure, with his moustache and his black, shining hair combed to the back. He was the elegant interpreter of various pleasant stories adapted to film from the stage, such as Non ti conosco più (1936) by Nunzio Malasomma, L'uomo che sorride (1936) and Questi ragazzi (1937) by Mario Mattoli. Often he remained in the limits of the genre, but in some cases showed admirable creativity in his performances, keeping them fresh and memorable. This can be seen to best advantage in films like Il cappello a tre punte (1934) by Mario Camerini, Cavalleria (1936) by Goffredo Alessandrini and Quattro passi fra le nuvole (1942) by Allesandro Blasetti. During the postwar period he was dedicated above all to the revue, playing opposite Wanda Osiris (Domani è sempre domenica, 1946–47; Si stava meglio domani, 1947–48; Il diavolo custode, 1950–51) and Isa Barzizza (Valentina, 1955). In the 1950s and '60s he lent his impeccable style and his sense of irony to television as well. Still memorable is his participation in Carosello in the spot for Germany (on the air from 1957 to 1965). He remains known for his signature phrase, \"Ullalà è una cuccagna!\""

She was the woman Filipino movie audiences loved to hate, often playing a villainous aunt, mother-in-law or even a witch. While her roles were hardly predisposed to have made her a star, she nonetheless was one of the more famous (or infamous) and durable stars of Filipino films. Many of her films were produced by Sampaguita Pictures, the studio under which she was under contract for a significant part of her career. Discher was born to a German father and a Filipina mother, with a sister named Elaina Discher. her extended family reside on the West Coast of the United States in Washington State and California. (Niece) She began her career in showbusiness as a chorus girl in the bodabil stage shows of Katy de la Cruz. Her son, Panchito, became a famous film comedian in his own right, usually cast as the comedic foil to Dolphy."

  "text" : "Elfodd, Elvodug or Elfoddw (Latin: Elbodus or Elbodius; died 809) was a Welsh bishop. He induced the Welsh church to accept the Roman computus for determining the date of Easter endorsed elsewhere in Britain at the Synod of Whitby in 664. This was after centuries of continuing the practice they had taught to the Irish. Elfodd appears to have been associated with the monastery at Holyhead on Anglesey as a young man and must have still been comparatively young when in 768 he persuaded the Welsh church to come into line with Rome as regards the method of calculating the date of Easter. The annals Brut y Tywysogion state: \"Eight years after that [768] Easter was moved for the Britons, and Elbodius the servant of God moved it\". Elfodd's death is recorded under the year 809. Brut y Tywysogion describes him as \"archbishop of Gwynedd\", making him bishop of Bangor. Nennius, who says in the History of the Britons that he was a pupil of Elfodd's, describes him as a \"most holy bishop\" and reveals that Elfodd studied the works of Bede. One later source states that he was consecrated as a bishop in 755, but may not be reliable."

  "text" : "Ernest Harry Vestine (May 9, 1906 – July 18, 1968) was an American geophysicist and meteorologist. He was born in Minneapolis, Minnesota to Swedish parents. At the age of two his family moved to Alberta, Canada, where he was raised. He earned a B.S. in math and physics in 1931 from the University of Alberta. The following year he joined the Canadian Meteorological Office in Toronto. During the Second International Polar Year, 1932-3, he led a Canadian expedition to Meanook, which lies in the northern part of Alberta. The team established a magnetic observatory at the site. In 1934 he left to study at the University of London, where in 1937 he earned a Ph.D. in applied mathematics. During the early 1930s he began a collaboration with the Carnegie Institution of Washington, and in January, 1938 he was hired as an assistant by the Institute's Department of Terrestrial Magnetism. He was soon promoted to chief of the department's Land Magnetic Survey section. In 1946 he became the head of the Section on Theoretical Geophysics. In 1947, E. H. Vestine et al. produced a comprehensive, two-volume work detailing all the geomagnetic data of the Department. In addition to his research into geomagnetics, he collaborated with studies into seismology and cosmic rays. In 1957 he performed work relating to the International Geophysical Year. The same year he left the Department of Terrestrial Magnetism to join the RAND Corporation. There he performed studies on planetary and space science, as well as issues concerning national security. From 1964 until 1968 he served as president of the American Geophysical Union's Geomagnetism section. He died in Santa Monica, California. His son, Henry Vestine, became a famous guitarist, playing with Frank Zappa's The Mothers of Invention and Canned Heat. The crater Vestine on the Moon is named after him."

  "text" : "Ernst Otto Stalinski (1944–2005) was a German humanist and entrepreneur. He died in San Pedro Sula, Honduras, on 8 December 2005 of natural causes. His involvement in a variety of agricultural enterprises led him to be a participant in what became known as the banana wars in the nineties. Stalinski's legal cases in Honduras alleged that while representing the European company Fyffes he became the object of strong-arm tactics by the multinational Chiquita Brands that included an alleged kidnapping attempt. When – in his opinion – the legal cases in Honduras became entangled in a web of power and corruption, he filed a claim against the State of Honduras before the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights in Washington D.C. The Stalinski saga continued throughout the nineties and into the new century consuming his time, fortune and health as it is suspected that adverse news related to his legal cases ultimately cause him a stroke that finished with his life. Stalinski's legacy lies in his idealism put in practice as he worked to do business while improving the lives of those less fortunate. While involved in litigation against Chiquita and its competing banana purchasing agent Stalinski was also involved in trying to expand a business he owned making children's furniture."

  "text" : "Eupalinos (Ancient Greek: Εὐπαλῖνος) or Eupalinus of Megara was an ancient Greek engineer who built the Tunnel of Eupalinos on Samos Island in the 6th century BC. The tunnel, presumably completed between 550 and 530 BC, is the second known tunnel in history which was excavated from both ends and the first with a methodical approach in doing so. Being also the longest tunnel of its time, the Tunnel of Eupalinos is regarded as a major feat of ancient engineering. It was constructed for the tyrant Polycrates of Samos, and was a remarkable 1,036 meters (3,399 ft) long. It brought water to the city, passing through limestone at the base of a hill; this tunnel still exists. The Greek historian Herodotus describes the tunnel briefly in his Histories (3.60) and calls Eupalinos of Megara its architect: I have dwelt rather long on the history of the Samians because theirs are the three greatest works (ergasmata) of all the Greeks. One is a tunnel (orygma amphistomon) through the base of a nine hundred foot high mountain. The tunnel's length is seven stades, its height and length (width) both eight feet. Throughout its length another cutting (orygma) has been dug (ororyktai) three feet wide and three feet deep, through which the water flowing in pipes is led into the city from an abundant spring. The builder (architekton) of the tunnel was the Megarian Eupalinus, son of Maustrophus. Eupalinos is supposed to be the first hydraulic engineer in history whose name has been passed down. Apart from that, though, nothing more is known about him. A large road tunnel, named after Eupalinos has been recently built under the Geraneia mountains in Corinthia, to facilitate the new expressway connection between Athens and Corinth. Eupalinos tunnel is the longest of three subsequent tunnels of the same width at this expressway."

Bourne is considered one of the founders of Latin American history as a field in the United States. The publication of his Spain in America (1904), was \"a major landmark in the development of the field,\" which \"gave a lucid synthesis of the institutional life of Spanish America, ranging also through economic, social, and cultural developments....\" In an assessment of Bourne's work, Charles Gibson and Benjamin Keen state that \"He may justifiably be termed the first scientific historian of the United States to view the Spanish colonial process dispassionately and thereby to escape the conventional Anglo-Protestant attitudes of outraged or tolerant disparagement.\""

  "text" : "Ellen Rometsch(born 1936 in Kleinitz, Germany) was rumored to be an East German Communist spy who was assigned on diplomatic cover to the West German embassy in Washington, D.C. during the early 1960s. She had fled East Germany with her parents in 1955. She married German air force sergeant Rolf Rometsch, who was stationed at the West German embassy. She is also widely thought in some Washington journalism circles to have been one of President John F. Kennedy's girlfriends during the height of the Cold War. However, the FBI never turned up \"any solid evidence\" that Rometsch was a spy or that she had relations with President Kennedy. She was expelled from the U.S. in August 1963 \"because of her behavior in Washington\", behavior which threatened to have scandalous overtones reminiscent of the Profumo Affair in England. Rometsch had worked as a hostess at the Quorum Club located in the Carroll Arms Hotel adjacent a Senate office building. It was a place for lawmakers and other influential men to meet for food, drink, and ladies. She disclosed details of the hostess service which provided members of the United States Senate and the United States House of Representatives with access to prostitutes. A news report by Clark R. Mollenhoff said her circle included \"some high White House figures\" and that she led a life that \"could not be financed on the pay of a non commissioned West German soldier.\" According to Wesley Pruden, a White House reporter of the time, later editor of the Washington Times, \"Just when a few brave Republicans were screwing up the courage to make something out of it, on the grounds that a president really shouldn't be taking off his clothes with a femme fatale from the Evil Empire, Bobby Kennedy, JFK's attorney general, sent J. Edgar Hoover to Capitol Hill with a not-so-friendly word to the wise. 'Don't investigate this,' he told the Republicans. 'Because if you do, we're going to open up everybody's closets.' J. Edgar Hoover, as every Republican knew, held the key to a lot of closets and was familiar with what was in all of them.\" Hoover met privately with Senators' Mike Mansfield and Everett Dirksen, telling them he had \"no evidence\" that Rometsch was a spy, but then proceeded to tell them details about the senators who had been \"entertained\" by Quorum Club girls. Robert Kennedy's desire to squelch any press reports of his brother's alleged involvement with Rometsch, led him to seek Hoover's help in discouraging any mention of the Rometsch \"allegations\" in the Senate investigation of Bobby Baker, who held the post of Senate Secretary for the Majority until he resigned in October, 1963."

  "text" : "Ebbo or Ebo (c. 775 – 20 March 851) was archbishop of Rheims from 816 until 835 and again from 840 to 841. He was born a German serf on the royal demesne of Charlemagne. He was educated at his court and became the librarian and councillor of Louis the Pious, king of Aquitaine, son of Charlemagne. When Louis became emperor, he appointed Ebbo to the see of Rheims, then vacant after the death of Wulfaire. He was an important figure in the spread of Christianity in the north of Europe. At the insistence of Louis, in 822, he went to Rome and asked Pope Pascal I to become the papal legate to the North. He was licensed to preach to the Danes and he and Halitgar, bishop of Cambrai, and Willerich, bishop of Bremen, went there in 823. He made short subsequent trips, but all with little success. Ansgar was more successful a few years later. When Louis's sons by his first marriage to Ermengarde of Hesbaye (Lothair, Louis, and Pepin) rebelled in 830, Ebbo remained loyal. But in 833 he joined the insurrection and on 13 November presided over the synod in the church of Saint Mary in Soissons which deposed Louis and forced him to publicly confess many crimes, none of which he had, in fact, committed. As a reward, Lothair gave Ebbo the Abbey of Saint Vaast. He then became a loyal follower of Lothair. He remained with him even after Louis's reinstatement in March 834. When Lothair had to flee to Italy, however, Ebbo was too ill with gout to follow and took shelter with a Parisian hermit. He was found by Louis' men and imprisoned in the Abbey of Fulda. Events of the previous year were soon reversed. He was brought to the Synod of Thionville (2 February 835) and made to admit, in front of 43 bishops, that Louis had never committed the crimes of which he had accused him. Ebbo publicly recanted from the pulpit in Mainz on 28 February. The Synod then promptly deposed him. He was again imprisoned in Fulda and later given to Fréculf, bishop of Lisieux, and later to Boso, abbot of Fleury. Ebbo was restored when Louis died and Lothair succeeded him in December 840. A year later, however, Charles the Bald was in control of France and Ebbo was deposed a second time. Hincmar was appointed to succeed him in 845 and refused to recognise his acts during his reinstatement. They were declared invalid by the Council of Soissons in 853. Ebbo went to the court of Lothair, but Pope Sergius II ignored his pleas to be reinstated (again). When Lothair had no use for Ebbo, however, he was forced to leave that court and go to that of Louis the German. Louis made him Bishop of Hildesheim (between April 845 and October 847) and it was in this position that he died on 20 March 851, in the seat of his diocese. He wrote the Apologeticum Ebbonis in defence of his reinstatement. It was probably one of his ordinations from the period of his reinstatement who penned the Pseudo-Isidorean Decretals. He also assembled artists at Hautvillers who transformed Carolingian art into a new thing and founded the so-called Reims School. The beautiful Gospel Book of Ebbo is their most well known product. His influence in the Carolingian Renaissance is enormous in the realm of art and illumination."

  "text" : "Edward Lucas White (May 11, 1866 – March 30, 1934) was an American author and poet. Born in the USA in Bergen, New Jersey, he attended Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, where he lived for the rest of his life. From 1915 until his retirement in 1930 he was a teacher at the University School for Boys in Baltimore. He published a number of historical novels, including The Unwilling Vestal (1918), Andivius Hedulio (1921) and Helen (1926), but he is best remembered for fantasy horror stories such as \"The House Of Nightmare\" and \"Lukundoo\" that were based on his own nightmares. Two collections of his short fiction were published in his lifetime, The Song of the Sirens (1919) and Lukundoo and Other Stories (1927). \"Lukundoo\", White's most frequently anthologized story, is the tale of an American explorer in a remote section of Africa who incurs the wrath of the local witch doctor, who casts a spell on him. Hundreds of sore pustules erupt all over the explorer's body. As these develop, it becomes clear that each sore is actually a sort of homunculus: a tiny African man, emerging head-first from within the explorer's flesh. He is able to terminate the development of individual homunculi by beheading them as they develop, but there are too many for him to defeat them all – and some of them are on portions of his back which he cannot reach. The explorer's only option is suicide. Two posthumous collections of his fiction have been published by Midnight House: The House of the Nightmare (12547ac) edited by John Pelan and Sesta and Other Strange Stories (2001) edited by Lee Weinstein. The latter contains mostly previously unpublished and uncollected material. During 1885 White began a utopian science fiction novel, Plus Ultra. He destroyed the first draft and started over in 1901, then worked on it for most of the rest of his life. The resulting monumental work—estimated by one critic at 500,000 words—remains unpublished, although a portion of it was released separately in 1920 as the novella From Behind the Stars. On March 30, 1934, seven years to the day after the death of his wife, Agnes Gerry, he committed suicide by gas inhalation in the bathroom of his Baltimore home. His last book, Matrimony (1932) was a memoir of his happy marriage to her."

Koivistoinen has worked as a musician, composer, arranger, conductor, producer and educator. He first heard jazz from the records his sailor brother had brought in from his travels. As a youngster Koivistoinen studied classical violin, saxophone and also composition at the Sibelius Academy, and later jazz at Berklee College of Music in Boston. His first line-up featured the drummer Edward Vesala and bassist Pekka Sarmanto. Koivistoinen was also a member of the seminal Finnish rock band Blues Section in the years 1967 and 1968. In 1968 he released his first solo album, a \"literary record\" called Valtakunta which featured songs composed to the texts of such poets as Pentti Saarikoski, Jarkko Laine, Tuomas Anhava and Hannu Mäkelä; interpreted by the vocalists Vesa-Matti Loiri, Eero Raittinen and Seija Simola. Eero Koivistoinen's later solo albums such as Wahoo (1972) enjoy a considerable international reputation. His hip hop-influenced 2006 album X-Ray features such people as the vocalists Charles Salter and Bina Nkwazi, DJ LBJ (also known as Jonas Verwijnen) and the rap artist Redrama (also known as Lasse Mellberg). Eero Koivistoinen was one of the founder members of the UMO Jazz Orchestra where he played from 1975 to 1990 and worked as its artistic director from 1996 to 1998.

  "text" : "Elie Carafoli (September 15, 1901, Veria, Salonica Vilayet, Ottoman Empire–October 24, 1983, Bucharest, Romania) was an accomplished Romanian engineer and aircraft designer. He is considered a pioneering contributor to the field of Aerodynamics. Carafoli was of Macedo-Romanian (Aromanian) descent. In 1915, he left Greece for Bitola, and then Bucharest, where he studied at Gheorghe Lazăr High School. In 1919 he entered University Politehnica of Bucharest, graduating with a degree in electrical engineering. He pursued his studies at the University of Paris, while also working at the Institut Aérotechnique in Saint-Cyr-l'École, France. He obtained a Ph.D. in 1928, with a thesis entitled Contribution to the theory of aerodynamic lift. In 1928, Carafoli returned to Bucharest, where he joined the faculty at the Polytechnic University, and founded the Aerodynamics chair; later in 1936 he was promoted to full professor. It was here that he built the first wind tunnel in South-Eastern Europe, and elaborated some of the theory on which calculations of wing profiles of supersonic aircraft are based. From 1930 to 1937 Carafoli worked at Industria Aeronautică Română in Braşov. Together with Lucién Virmoux from Blériot Aéronautique, he designed the IAR CV-11, a single-seat, low-wing monoplane fighter aircraft. A prototype was flown in 1931 by Captain Romeo Popescu, in an attempt at breaking the flight airspeed record, but the plane crashed, and the pilot lost his life. Carafoli also designed the IAR 14 and IAR 15 aircraft, and later in 1937 initiated the development of the legendary IAR 80 fighter aircraft, at the urging of Prime Minister Armand Călinescu. In 1948, he was elected to the Romanian Academy. In 1949 he became director of the Institute of Applied Mechanics of the Academy. Carafoli was President of the International Astronautical Federation from 1968 to 1970. In 1971, he reorganized, along with Henri Coandă, the Department of Aeronautical Engineering of the Polytechnic University of Bucharest, spinning it off from the Department of Mechanical Engineering. Carafoli was awarded the Louis Breguet Prize (Paris,1927), the Gauss Medal, and the Apollo 11 Medal (1971)."

  "text" : "Eudokia Palaiologina or (Greek: Ευδοκία Παλαιολογίνα) (c. 1265 – 18 September 1302) was the third daughter of Byzantine Emperor Michael VIII Palaiologos and his wife, Theodora Doukaina Vatatzaina, a grandniece of Emperor John III Doukas Vatatzes of Nicaea. In 1282 Eudokia married in Constantinople John II Megaskomnenos, Emperor of Trebizond with whom she had two sons, Alexios and Michael. In 1298, after her husband's death and the ascension of her son Alexios II, she returned to her brother's court at Constantinople taking her younger son Michael with her. Andronikos II Palaiologos received his sister, planning to use her to seal a diplomatic settlement with Stefan Uroš II Milutin, King of Serbia: the hand of Eudokia in return for a negotiated peace. King Stefan was agreeable to this proposal, for one of his three wives had recently died. \"But nothing that Andronikos could do would influence his sister to entertain the prospect of life with a lecherous barbarian in the wilds of Serbia,\" writes Donald M. Nicol. King Stefan was forced to settle for Andronikos' daughter Simonida by his second wife, Irene of Montferrat. Meanwhile, Alexios II decided for himself to marry Djiadjak Jaqeli, an Georgian princess. His uncle Andronikos II, who had been appointed his guardian by his father, wanted this marriage annulled; he had planned for Alexios to marry the daughter of the high court official Nikephoros Choumnos. Eudokia used the pretext of inducing her son to dissolve the marriage to obtain her brother's permission to return to Trebizond in 1301; upon arriving, she instead advised her son to keep his Georgian wife. Eudokia died in the following year, and William Miller speculates she was buried in the church of Saint Gregory of Nyssa. Anthony Bryer has proposed that a Eudokia, who became a nun by the monastic name Euphemia, mentioned in a painted inscription recorded by Fallmerayer from the Panagia Theoskepastos Church, may have been Eudokia Palaologina. This Eudokia has not been satisfactorily proven to be a member of the house of the Great Komnenoi, and Bryer offers a number of objections to any identification. He notes that there is \"a strong independent local nineteenth-century tradition\" that Eudokia founded the church of St. Gregory of Nyssa before her death. Lastly, Bryer notes that \"it would not be surprising if she would have wished to put not only distance but a nun's veil between herself and her brother's ruthless and alarming marital plans (which included Mongol and Turkish alliances for other female members of his family) before she died in 1302.\""

  "text" : "Earl \"Snakehips\" Tucker (1905–1937) was an American dancer and entertainer. Also known as the \"Human Boa Constrictor\", he acquired the nickname \"snakehips\" via the dance he popularized in Harlem in the 1920s called the \"snakehips (dance)\". Tucker frequented Harlem music clubs and was a regular at the Savoy Ballroom. He built his reputation by exhibiting his odd style of dance, which involved a great deal of hip motion. Tucker would make it appear that he was as flexible as a snake, and eventually the dance became his calling card. He became popular enough to eventually perform at Connie's Inn and the Cotton Club. The snakehips dates back to southern plantations before emancipation. Riding this wave of popularity, in 1930 he appeared in Benny Rubin's 16 minute short film \"Crazy House\", a comedic introduction to residents at the fictitious \"Lame Brain Sanitarium\". Tucker's 2 minute dance number, performed in a shiny white shirt and shiny, baggy gold pants, displays his amazing dance innovations, his style a precursor to modern street and stage dance. His name appears in the opening credits only as \"Snake Hips\". In 1935, Tucker appeared in a short film called Symphony in Black: A Rhapsody of Negro Life. The film was inspired by a Duke Ellington composition, and included clips of Ellington composing, as well as Billie Holiday singing and Tucker doing the snakehips."

However, the high-ranking officials in the Western Xia government became more corrupt as time passed, starting the irreversible decline of the Western Xia. The rising of the Mongols under Genghis Khan began to pose threats as Mongols began raiding border villages. In 1205, Huanzong changed the name of the Western Xia capital to Zhongxing (now Yinchuan). Also in 1205, the Mongols began their first invasion of the Western Xia, pillaging and burning many outlying villages and cities. In 1206, his cousin Li Anchaun started a coup d'état and took power from Huanzong. Huanzong died in the same year."

  "text" : "Edward \"Teddy\" Sinclair Perry, known as Edward Sinclair (3 February 1914 – 29 August 1977) was an English actor best remembered for his role as the verger Maurice Yeatman in Dad's Army. He also made appearances in Z-Cars and Danger Man. Sinclair was born in Oldham, Lancashire, the son of a stage actor. His father died when he was 14. Drama school was too expensive so he worked for amateur theatre companies. He served in the Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire Light Infantry in the Second World War, and was a salesman before deciding to become a professional actor in his late forties. Although born into a theatrical family, Edward had to resist the temptation to turn professional until he had safely brought up his family. In the meantime, he continued to perform with amateur dramatics societies, enjoying the experience while continuing to earn a living from being a salesman. The earliest work in his belated main career was in radio before being noticed and offered small parts on TV. His first appearance in Dad's Army was in the fifth episode (before audiences had been introduced to the Vicar) as the caretaker, playing the verger from the second series. He also appeared in several films and theatre productions, and was being offered work in panto just as the series finished, but died soon after from a heart attack while living in Cheddar, Somerset. This came as a shock to all the cast members, and it was Arthur Lowe, who stated at his funeral service, \"With the loss of Teddy, it is now quite clear that there will be no more Dad's Army.\""

  "text" : "Erik Ehn is an American playwright and director known for proposing the Regional Alternative Theatre movement. The former dean of theater at CalArts, the California Institute of Arts, he is head of playwriting and professor of theatre and performance studies at Brown University. His published works include The Saint Plays, Beginner, and 13 Christs. Ehn is a playwright, educator and theorist of contemporary theater. Nearly a decade ago, he collaborated with Janie Geiser on Invisible Glass, which is itself inspired by Edgar Allan Poe's short story, \"William Wilson.\" It premiered at the Roy and Edna Disney/CalArts Theater (REDCAT) in April 2005. His play Maria Kizito is based on the 1994 genocide in Rwanda and is the result of his research in that Central African country. Its premiere launched Atlanta's 7 Stages 2004-05 season. Ehn's work includes The Saint Plays, an ongoing cycle of plays loosely based on the lives of the saints and biblical characters. Other plays include Book of Tink, Heavenly Shades of Night are Falling, No Time Like the Present, Wolf at the Door, Tailings, Beginner, Ideas of Good and Evil, 13 Christs and an adaptation of William Faulkner's The Sound and the Fury. Additionally, he co-wrote the musical Shiner with Octavio Solis. His dramas have been produced in San Francisco, Seattle, Austin, Dallas, New York City, San Diego, Baltimore, and Chicago. In 2004, he served as dramaturge on Peach Blossom Fan - the inaugural production by CalArts Center for New Theater at REDCAT. Ehn's Soulographie: Our Genocides, a series of 17 plays, was presented as a two-day marathon at La MaMa in 2012. Together the plays examine the relationship of 20th century America to genocide in the United States, Central America, and East Africa. About half of the plays in the cycle incorporated puppetry. Although most of the plays in the cycle had previously been performed individually, the production presented them together for the first time. Ehn is co-founder and co-artistic director, alongside Lisa Bielawa, of the Tenderloin Opera Company in San Francisco and also an artistic associate of San Francisco's Theatre of Yugen. He is a co-founder of the RAT movement, an international network of alternative theaters. He was a recipient of the Alpert Award in the Arts in 2002 and a  Whiting Award in 1997. Ehn is the founder of an annual conference called \"Arts in the One World,\" which brings together performing artists, scholars, and human rights activists to investigate theater on the subject of genocide and reconciliation. Ehn also travels to Rwanda and Uganda annually with students and other professionals, to explore the role of art in recovery from violence."

  "text" : "Ernst Uhrlau (born 7 December 1946) was the President of the German Bundesnachrichtendienst (BND). After attending Gymnasium Eppendorf, he graduated from University of Hamburg with specialization in political science. In 1981, Uhrlau became an assistant to the Head of the Department for Protection of the Constitution of Hamburg, Christian Lochte, and in 1991 he took Lochte’s place. From 1996-98, Ernst Uhrlau was the Chief of Hamburg Police. In 1998, Uhrlau was appointed a Coordinator of the Intelligence Community in the office of the Chancellor. On 1 December 2005, he was appointed to the post of the head of the BND. The most outstanding of Uhrlau’s achievements in the post of Intelligence Community Coordinator was organizing the exchange between Israel and the Lebanese Hezbollah of the bodies of captured Israeli soldiers for captured militants in January 2004. In the BND documents this operation received the name \"The Blue-White Sky Action\" (\"Die Aktion Himmel blau-weiß\"). During its realization Uhrlau had numerous contacts with representatives of both parties and repeated visits to Beirut, and he proved himself, above all, an outstanding diplomat. It is believed Uhrlau was a mediator between Hezbollah and Israel for the return in 2008 of the remains of two Israeli soldiers, Ehud Goldwasser and Eldad Regev, whose kidnapping triggered the 2006 Lebanon war."

  "text" : "Erik Eriksen (25 February 1820 - died 1888) was a Norwegian polar captain. Eriksen was the first to sight and shore Kong Karls Land. The strait Erik Eriksenstretet between Kong Karls Land and Nordaustlandet, commemorates him. Eriksen also contributed to the invention of the grenade harpoon used in modern whaling. Erik Eriksen was born at Lyngør in Aust-Agder, Norway. In 1844, he moved to Hammerfest in Finnmark, Norway. He sailed as a helmsman and from 1846 as skipper in the surrounding fishing grounds. He also married Anna Birgitte Dehle (1825–1895) with whom he had 10 children. He later designed a whale harpoon which he carved into a wooden model. He subsequently travelled to Tønsberg to meet with whaling and shipping magnate Svend Foyn to present him with the model of a proposed grenade harpoon. In July 1868 Erik Eriksen emigrated to the United States leaving his wife and children in Norway. In 1870, Svend Foyn successfully patented and pioneered the modern exploding whaling harpoon and gun. He industrialized production and use of the deck cannons and heavy-caliber harpoons. Erik Eriksen gained neither profits nor the honor for his contribution as Foyn had financed production and development of the harpoon and it was designed while Eriksen was employed by him. However, Svend Foyn did provide financial assistance to Eriksen's family in Hammerfest. Erik Eriksen later died during a blizzard in Dakota. (Most likely the \"Schoolhouse Blizzard\" of 1888)"

  "text" : "Ellis Wynne (7 March 1671 – 13 July 1734) was a Welsh clergyman and author of one of the most important and influential pieces of Welsh language literature. Born in Lasynys Fawr (grid reference SH596327) near Harlech, Gwynedd, Wynne excelled at school and entered Jesus College, Oxford on 1 March 1692. There is historical debate as to whether or not he graduated, and little evidence to support either claim, but local tradition suggests that he was studying law before he was convinced to take holy orders by his friend Humphrey Humphreys, Bishop of Bangor and, afterwards, of Hereford.Wynne married for the first time in Llanfihangel-y-traethau Church in 1698.He was ordained a priest in December 1704. During his life, he was priest of the parishes of Llandanwg, Llanbedr and Llanfair. Although a respected priest, Welsh translator and hymn writer, Wynne is remembered today largely because of his literary output. His Gweledigaetheu y Bardd Cwsc ('Visions of the Sleeping Bard'), first published in London in 1703, is regarded as a Welsh language classic. It is generally said that no better model exists of such 'pure' idiomatic Welsh, before writers had become influenced by English style and method. On the title page of the book, the words Y Rhann Gyntaf ('The First Part') appear; it has been suggested that Wynne had indeed written a second part - a 'Vision of heaven' - but on hearing that he had been charged with plagiarism of the first part, destroyed the manuscript. The charges of plagiarism were never substantiated and are, today, regarded as false. Wynne's later life is as obscure as the early part of his life, and we know little of what became of him after the publication of the Gweledigaethau. He was buried under the altar at Llanfair (near Harlech)."

Williams was arrested the week of December 22, 2005 on charges of shoplifting from an Irvington, New Jersey discount store. Following her arrest, both the Newark Star-Ledger and political website PoliticsNJ.com ran a series of articles on Williams, exposing her alleged theft of a hefty state pension normally reserved for policeman and firemen in active duty that she should not have qualified for. In January 2006, Williams would also be accused of failing to pay election workers assisting with the gubernatorial campaign of fellow Democrat Jon Corzine. On January 6, 2006, Williams submitted a letter of resignation to Essex County Democratic Chair Phil Thigpen announcing her intentions to step down to clear up \"misconceptions\" regarding her conduct, and was replaced by Oadline Truitt at a meeting of the Essex County Democratic Committee on January 9, 2006, one day before the New Jersey General Assembly reorganized for the 2006 session. During her service as an assemblywoman, Williams attended one voting session of the Assembly. Assemblywoman Williams worked in social services for the Essex County Department of Corrections until she was fired in December 2005 of charges related to improperly collecting her pension. She previously served as Deputy Mayor of Newark and as President of the Newark Board of Education."

His parents were William Evesham of Burghope Hall and his wife, Jane Haworthe, daughter of Alexander Haworthe. The family moved to London in the early 1580s. Evesham studied sculpture under Richard Stephens, a Dutchman who specialised in alabaster work in the 'Southwark' style, at his studio in that town. He also studied metal engraving, and one such inscription remains: a memorial to one Edmond West, dated 1618. This can be found in the parish church in Marsworth, Buckinghamshire. He is known as one of the first members of the gentry to train as a sculptor. Between 1600 and 1615, Evesham was living and working in Paris, creating monuments for major figures, including one of the Archbishop of Sens, for the cathedral of Notre-Dame. His many English works include monuments to the poet John Owen, which was in the old St Paul's Cathedral, destroyed in the Great Fire of London. A monument to Christopher Roper, 2nd Baron Teynham was executed in the 1620s, and still stands in the family chapel in Lynsted church, Kent. His memorial to Lady Parry (1585) can be seen in Welford church in Berkshire. Other works included memorials for several members of the Collyns family. Two of these are extant in Hythe church, and another in Mersham church."

  "text" : "Erasmus Haworth (1855–1932) was an American geologist. Born on a farm near Indianola, Iowa, he graduated from the University of Kansas with a bachelor of science degree in 1881 and received a master's degree there in 1884. He received his doctoral degree from Johns Hopkins University in 1888. He taught at various colleges, and was appointed professor of geology and mineralogy at the University of Kansas in 1892, where he remained until 1920. Today, Haworth Hall, a building named after Haworth, houses the Division of Biological Sciences at the University of Kansas. He organized the Kansas Geological Survey in 1894, and wrote several volumes of the survey from 1896 to 1904. He was state geologist from 1894 to 1915. In this position, he was instrumental in finding an ample water supply for Wichita and Newton. In 1903, he collected a sample of gas from a well drilled in Dexter, Kansas and had it analyzed by colleagues in the university's Department of Chemistry. The sample was found to contain helium, which was previously believed to be rare on earth. In the late 1890s and early 1900s, Haworth repeatedly used his position as state geologist to warn against investing in phony zinc and gold deposits in Trego and Ellis counties, Kansas. The politically influential promoters threatened to have Haworth fired from the University for his interference, but it eventually became clear that the deposits were an illusion and a swindle, and Haworth was vindicated. Haworth was connected with the United States Geological Survey, and wrote several of its bulletins as well as bulletins for the Missouri Geological Survey and annual bulletins of statistics of the mineralogy and geology of Kansas. He also worked professionally for the Union Pacific Railroad company in Wyoming and Kansas, and for private parties in Kansas and adjacent states. He was a fellow of the Geological Society of America and other scientific societies."

  "text" : "Edgar Thomas (Eddie) Stapleton, (21 November 1930 – 13 November 2005) was an outstanding Australian Rugby union winger who made his mark with the Wallabies and the St George Rugby Club in Sydney in the 1950s. He was a curiosity in that he played a match for the New Zealand All Blacks in 1960. Stapleton was a strong bulky winger and he played 16 test matches for Australia between 1951 and 1958, touring New Zealand with the Wallabies in 1952, 1955 and 1958. He played many games for the NSW Waratahs and was outstanding in Sydney club rugby, playing a record 236 games for St George and scoring 144 tries. He was captain when St George won the premiership in 1957, and he retired from the Wallabies the following season. In 1960, the All Blacks stopped in Australia for warmup matches on their way to a tour of South Africa. Depleted by injuries, the All Blacks were short of players for the match against Queensland and Stapleton was invited to don the black jersey. He did so to become the 613th player to be selected as an All Black. He had lost none of his dash and repaid the selector's confidence in him by scoring the first try for the All Blacks who easily won the match. Another Australian, Maurice Graham, of NSW, also played in that match, at fullback"

When the expedition returned to Europe in 1862, von Martens continued to travel around Maritime Southeast Asia for 15 months. Back in Berlin, von Martens was curator of the malacological and other invertebrate sections until his death. Von Martens described 155 new genera (150 of them molluscs) and almost 1,800 species (including around 1,680 molluscs, 39 crustaceans, and 50 echinoderms).

  "text" : "Espen Eckbo (born 22 April 1973) is a Norwegian actor, writer and comedian. He was born in Oslo, and grew up in Bestum. He now lives in Ullevål Hageby with his wife Rebekka Strandenes and his dog Andreas. Eckbo has no formal training as an actor, but has a background as a law student for two years at the University of Oslo. Internationally, he is best recognised for having helped to create the fictional boy band Boyzvoice and the subsequent mockumentary Get Ready to be Boyzvoiced (2000) together with Henrik Elvestad. Eckbo first appeared on Norwegian television in 1998, when he got his own segment in the news satire program Mandagsklubben, where he would portray a different character every week in a mock documentary style. These segments were also the launching pad for Boyzvoice. The short-lived show I kveld, with Thomas Giertsen, and Rebekka Strandenes followed in 1999. He later made fun of the reality TV phenomenon in the mock reality show Nissene på låven (2001, together with Kristian Ødegård). This show also introduced three of his most familiar characters, Asbjørn Brekke, Rebekka Strandenes and Rhino Thue. By that time, Eckbo had established the production company Seefood together with Kristian Ødegård. Eckbo and his characters has also featured in the game show TV2-nøttene which was presented by Ødegård and aired during Christmas and Easter, and is a parody of the Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation programs Julenøtter and Påskenøtter. His characters also featured in Henrik Elvestad's mock talk show Tonight med Timothy Dale (2003) and Eckbo's show Tett på tre (2008). He had segments in Otto Jespersen's Rikets røst. In 2006 Eckbo created the live show Team Eckbo together with Atle Antonsen, Harald Eia and Bård Tufte Johansen."

She also adds that her spoken Spanish was poor. For this reason, Burgos took on the role of assembling Menchu's testimony. Menchu's story speaks to her experience as an indigenous woman, as well as atrocities committed by the Guatemalan military. Menchu's story is considered one of the major texts of Latin American \"testimonio.\" In the U.S., the title of the narrative went by the name of I, Rigoberta Menchu, and in the original Spanish (Me llamo Rigoberta Menchú y así me nació la conciencia. In the text, Burgos also adds quotes from the Popol Vuh, the sacred book of the Mayans. Those epigraphs foreshadow the narrative of the testimonial of Menchu. The translation into English became an international phenomenon."

His work was influenced by the Pre-Raphaelites. In 1884 he married the painter Henrietta Rae (1859–1928). They both painted the nude in lush settings, and were criticised for an apparent tendency towards an excess of sensuality in some of their paintings. He and his wife were based in London from the early 1890s, where he had his studio and received support from the circle around Lord Leighton. Normand painted the \"King John Granting the Magna Carta\" fresco at the Royal Exchange in London (painted 1900, restored 2001)."

  "text" : "Ethel Davis Wilson, OC (January 20, 1888 – December 22, 1980) was a Canadian writer of short stories and novels. Born in Port Elizabeth, South Africa, she moved to England in 1890 following the death of her mother. In 1898, after the death of her father, she was taken to live with her maternal grandmother in Vancouver, British Columbia. She received her teacher's certificate in 1907, and for thirteen years taught in Vancouver elementary schools. In 1921 she married Wallace Wilson, President of the Canadian Medical Association and professor of medical ethics at the University of British Columbia. In the 1930s Wilson published a few short stories and began a series of fictionalized family reminiscences which were later published as The Innocent Traveller (1949). Her first published novel, Hetty Dorval, appeared in 1947, and was followed, seven years later by Swamp Angel (1954), generally thought of as her most accomplished work. Her final book was Mrs Golightly and Other Stories (1961). In 1980 she was hospitalized and suffering from a series of small strokes. The day before she died, she was in physical distress from passing a kidney stone. A doctor injected her with medication to ease the pain. Wilson is the subject of one work of criticism, Ethel Wilson by Desmond Pacey, and two biographies, The Other Side of Silence: A Life of Ethel Wilson by Mary McAlpine and Ethel Wilson: A Critical Biography by David Stouck. The Ethel Wilson Fiction Prize is named in her honour."

  "text" : "Colonel Eduardo Abaroa Hidalgo (October 13, 1838, San Pedro de Atacama – March 23, 1879) was Bolivia's foremost hero of the War of the Pacific (1879–1883), which pitted Chile against Bolivia and Peru. He was one of the leaders of the civilian resistance to the Chilean invasion at the Battle of Topáter. Abaroa was an engineer by trade, working in a silver mine located in the coastal region of Litoral, which Chile took from Bolivia during the War of the Pacific. During the Battle of Topáter (23 March 1879), the first armed clash of the war, Colonel Abaroa was part of a badly outnumbered Bolivian force defending a bridge that crossed the Topáter River and gave access to the city of Calama, an important desert oasis on the road to Bolivia. Refusing to surrender, after the outnumbered Bolivian military forces withdrew, he fought to his last breath, a feat that later transformed him into a revered national hero. When, injured and surrounded, he was asked to surrender by the Chilean forces, he provided an answer that has gone into Bolivian folklore: \"¿Rendirme yo? ¡Que se rinda su abuela, carajo!\" (\"Surrender? Your grandmother [is who] should surrender, you bastard!\", or \"Surrender, me? Let your grandmother surrender, dammit!\", or, more literally, \"Surrender, me? That your grandmother surrender herself, fuck!\"), equivalent to saying \"Surrender? Surrender my ass!\". According to Chilean folklore he answered: \"¿Quién, Yo?\" (\"Who, me?\")"

He is recognized today as a founder of the modern Olympic Games, who sponsored the Olympic Games of 1859, 1870, 1875, and 1888 and preceded the Olympic Games that came under the auspices of the International Olympic Committee. These Games, known at the time simply as Olympics, came before the founding of the International Olympic Committee. The legacy of Evangelis Zappas, as well as the legacy of his cousin Konstantinos Zappas, was also used to fund the Olympic Games of 1896. During his youth, Zappas joined the Greek War of Independence (1821–1832), achieving the rank of Major and fighting in several significant battles. Following Greek independence, he moved to Wallachia where he had a successful career as a businessman, becoming one of the richest men of that time in Eastern Europe. Aside from being the only major sponsor of the Olympic revival at that time, he is also known in Greece as a national benefactor, thanks to the foundation of several institutions and schools as well as sports and exhibition facilities."

  "text" : "Edward Zelinsky is a tax scholar on the subject of United States tax law, professor at Cardozo Law School in New York City, and frequent visiting professor at the Yale Law School. He has also taught at Cornell, NYU and Columbia. Zelinsky has testified before the United States Congress and the House Judiciary Committee. He has served on the New Haven Board of Aldermen, and when elected was the first person to be elected to the Board while a student at Yale University. In 2003, he challenged the State of New York on its so-called \"convenience of the employer\" doctrine which enabled New York to engage in what Zelinsky and others have alleged is unconstitutional double taxation of telecommuters. The case, Zelinsky v. Tax Appeals Tribunal, was denied certiorari by the U.S. Supreme Court after the New York Court of Appeals decided against Zelinsky. Connecticut Senator Chris Dodd subsequently attempted to introduce federal legislation that would prevent New York and other states from engaging in such taxation. Zelinsky and Justice Samuel Alito attended Yale Law School together. In November 2005, during Samuel Alito's confirmation process for the US Supreme Court, Zelinsky supported Alito in the press, identifying himself as \"a Democrat for Sam\". He has written a book titled The Origins of Ownership Society, published in 2007 by Oxford University Press, which examines the political and social implications of a defined contribution paradigm."

Then he would recite the title and cast: \"Maverick! Starring Jack Kelly and Roger Moore!\" He narrated several episodes of the first Brian Keith series, Crusader, which aired on CBS from 1955 to 1956. Reimers was also the original announcer for Do You Trust Your Wife? when Edgar Bergen hosted, but was replaced by Bob LeMond in the fall of 1956. He appeared as Admiral Fitzpatrick in 1967 in the Star Trek episode \"The Trouble With Tribbles\". Reimers is perhaps best known, though, as spokesman for the Allstate Corporation in their long-running series of television commercials in the United States, advising viewers that they were \"in good hands with Allstate.\" Reimers was the TV spokesman for Allstate for 22 years, from 1957 until 1979. Reimers was also a popular narrator of industrial films, especially those made by Lockheed Space and Missile Systems Division, Sunnyvale, California, and by the Aerojet-General Corporation Solid Rocket Plant in Sacramento, California. Reimers was a native of Moline, Illinois, and died on 16 August 2009 in Saratoga Springs, New York."

  "text" : "Elgar Howarth (born 4 November 1935), is an English conductor, composer and trumpeter. Howarth was born at Cannock, Staffordshire. He was educated in the 1950s at Manchester University and the Royal Manchester College of Music (the predecessor of the Royal Northern College of Music), where his fellow students included the composers Harrison Birtwistle, Alexander Goehr, Peter Maxwell Davies, and the pianist John Ogdon. Together they formed New Music Manchester, a group dedicated to the performance of new music. He has worked with all leading British orchestras, as well as many orchestras worldwide. He played the opening bars of Tippett's King Priam at its Coventry premiere in 1962, (conducting the whole work years later for English National Opera).He has conducted many operas, and premiered György Ligeti's Le Grand Macabre at the Grand Opera Stockholm in 1978, and four operas by Harrison Birtwistle: The Mask of Orpheus at English National Opera (1986), Yan Tan Tethera for Opera Factory (1986), Gawain at the Royal Opera House in London (1991) and The Second Mrs Kong at Glyndebourne (1994). He was Principal Guest Conductor of Opera North from 1985 to 1988, and Music Advisor to the company from 2002 to 2004. As a composer and former trumpet player, he writes mainly for brass instruments. Swedish trumpeter Håkan Hardenberger has premiered several of his works on cornet, including his Cornet Concerto, Canto, and Capriccio. He has written arrangements such as The Carnival of Venice Variations for brass ensemble  and Modest Mussorgsky's Pictures At An Exhibition arranged for brass band. Composer Roy Newsome remarks that \"Howarth's masterly rendition of Mussorgsky's Pictures at an Exhibition (1979) dwarfed all previous transcriptions.\" He was brought up in a brass band family and has maintained his interest in the art form. Howarth has made a huge contribution to the modern repertoire of brass band music. Many of his works are recorded, most notably by the Grimethorpe Colliery Band and the Eikanger-Bjørsvik band. He also was one of the trumpeters who performed with The Beatles on the song Magical Mystery Tour. A number of personal copies of works he has conducted (some including annotations) are catalogued at the University of East Anglia's School of Music."

In 1980, Whitehorse earned her Bachelor of Arts degree in painting from the University of New Mexico in Albuquerque (UNW). She earned her master's degree in art in 1982, also from UNM, majoring in printmaking and minoring in art history. Whitehorse's paintings draw upon a personal iconography, based on her reflections of her natural surroundings. She brings together Navajo cosmological perspectives with abstraction in her work. Whitehorse's work is deliberately apolitical. Her paintings are usually oil on paper, mounted on canvas. Her work is represented in public collections throughout North America, Europe, Japan, Uzbekistan and Morocco. Now Emmi Whitehorse's abstract work is exhibited internationally, and she travels to Europe often."

  "text" : "Frances Edwina Dumm (1893 – April 28, 1990) was a writer-artist who drew the comic strip Cap Stubbs and Tippie for six decades and is also notable as the nation’s first full-time female editorial cartoonist, She used her middle name for the signature on her comic strip, signed simply Edwina. One of the earliest female syndicated cartoonists, Dumm was born in Upper Sandusky, Ohio, where her father, Frank Edwin Dumm, was an actor-playwright turned newspaperman. In 1911, she graduated from Central High School in Columbus, Ohio and then took the Cleveland-based Landon School of Illustration and Cartooning correspondence course. Her name was later featured in Landon's advertisements. She drew editorial cartoons for the Columbus Daily Monitor from its first edition (August 7, 1915) until the paper folded (July 1917). In the Monitor, her Spot-Light Sketches was a full-page feature of editorial cartoons, and some of these promoted women's issues. Elisabeth Israels Perry, in the introduction to Alice Sheppard's Cartooning for Suffrage (1994), wrote that artists such as Blanche Ames Ames, Lou Rogers and Edwina Dumm produced: ...a visual rhetoric that helped create a climate more favorable to change in America's gender relations... By the close of the suffrage campaign, women's art reflected the new values of feminism, broadened its targets, and attempted to restate the significance of the movement."

He graduated from the University of Utah in 1877 and then became a teacher in Weber County, Utah. In 1881, he married Jane Ballantyne, a daughter of Richard Ballantyne, the founder of the LDS Church's Sunday School movement. In about 1880, Anderson entered the newspaper business in Ogden, Utah. He later served on the staff of The Contributor. From 1890 to 1892, Anderson served as president of the Scandinavian Mission of the LDS Church. In 1893, he became a member of the Young Men's Mutual Improvement Association (YMMIA) General Board and in 1899 succeeded B. H. Roberts as associate editor of the Improvement Era. In 1900, Anderson became a member of the Weber Stake High Council. Anderson served in the YMMIA until 1907. Anderson was still listed as co-editor of the Improvement Era in 1922, with Heber J. Grant, the President of the LDS Church, listed as the other editor. In addition to his biography of Brigham Young, Anderson also wrote A Brief History of the Church. Andrew Jenson also included some of writings by Anderson in his Latter-day Saints Biographical Encyclopedia. Anderson served as the clerk of the LDS Church's general conference on several occasions in the 1910s and 1920s. In 1900, Anderson was elected to the Utah House of Representatives. He was appointed surveyor-general for Utah, a federal appointment, in 1901. Anderson and his wife Jane had seven children."

  "text" : "Erich Gottlieb Eliskases (15 February 1913 – 2 February 1997) was a chess Grandmaster of the 1930s and 1940s, who represented Austria, Germany and Argentina in international competition. Born in Innsbruck, Austro-Hungarian Empire, he learned chess at the age of twelve and quickly displayed an aptitude for the game, winning the Schlechter chess club championship in his first year at the club, aged just fourteen. At fifteen, he was the Tyrolean Champion and at sixteen, joint winner of the Austrian Championship. His college education in Innsbruck and Vienna centred on business studies; it was chess, though, that captured his imagination and he had exceptional results at the Olympiads of 1930, 1933 and 1935. After the Anschluss of March 1938, he won the German national championship at Bad Oeynhausen in 1938 and 1939. He played under the German flag at the 1939 Buenos Aires Olympiad, during which World War II began, when Eliskases (along with many other players) decided to stay in Argentina (and for a while in Brazil) rather than return to the scene of the conflict. Brazilian authorities threatened to intern and expel Eliskases as they had severed all links with Nazi Germany. Some Brazilian chess enthusiasts helped Eliskases avoid that fate by hiring him as a chess teacher. After some years in the wilderness, when he struggled to make a living, he eventually became a naturalized Argentine citizen and represented his new country at the Olympiads of 1952, 1958, 1960 and 1964. FIDE awarded Eliskases the titles of International Master and Grandmaster in 1950 and 1952, respectively. He had many fine tournament results, including outright or joint first place at Budapest 1934 (the Hungarian Championship), Linz 1934, Zürich 1935, Milan 1937, Noordwijk 1938 (his greatest success, ahead of Euwe and Keres), Krefeld 1938, Bad Harzburg 1939, Bad Elster 1939, Vienna 1939, Águas de São Pedro/São Paulo 1941, São Paulo 1947, Mar del Plata 1948, Punta del Este 1951 and Córdoba 1959. His victory in Noordwijk began a streak of eight consecutive tournaments in which he was undefeated. He won matches against Efim Bogoljubov (1939) and Rudolf Spielmann (thrice, in 1932, 1936 and 1937). Towards the end of the 1930s, along with Keres and Capablanca, Eliskases was regarded as a potential contender for a World Championship encounter with Alexander Alekhine. Indeed, Alekhine spoke out in favour of a match with the Austrian, who had acted as a second during his successful attempt to regain the title from Max Euwe in 1937. However, Eliskases' defection to South America was badly timed, as documentary evidence later showed that the Nazi regime had scheduled him a 1941 match with the World Champion, but due to circumstances, had subsequently abandoned the idea. In terms of his credentials for such a contest, he was one of very few masters to have beaten three world champions (Capablanca, Euwe and Fischer). Indeed, he had a plus score against Euwe (3-2), and even scores against Capablanca (2-2) and Fischer (1-1). Eliskases' critics may have pointed to the impressive credentials of Keres, his main rival, but the Estonian too had twice fallen victim to Eliskases in tournament play. He carried on playing through the 1950s, 60s and even into the 70s but his results were less convincing. He married the Argentinian María Esther Almeda in 1954 and had a son, Carlos Enrico. In 1976, he and his wife went back to the Austrian Tyrol, but the couple failed to settle and returned to Córdoba. Eliskases was also a strong correspondence player and his notes showed that he scored over 75 percent during his most active period. He was considered an expert in the endgame—at Semmering 1937, he outplayed and beat Capablanca in this phase, despite this being the forte of the Cuban ex-world champion. Dutch grandmaster Hans Ree observes that Eliskases is one of only four players (Keres, Reshevsky and Euwe being the others) to beat both Capablanca and Fischer."

In 1877, he began a dig at Telloh (the ancient Girsu, as it transpired, rather than Lagash as once supposed). The site, in present-day Iraq in the southern delta lowlands, had been drawn to his attention by local dealers in antiquities. During the 1880s he succeeded in finding evidence of the reign of Gudea. He continued to work on the site until 1901."

  "text" : "Edward Harold Litchfield (April 14, 1914 – March 8, 1968) was an American educator and the twelfth Chancellor (1956–1965) of the University of Pittsburgh. He is best known for a major expansion of the university, but also a failure to raise sufficient capital to fund such growth, eventually leading to his resignation in July 1965. He earned the B.A., M.A., and Ph.D. at the University of Michigan. He taught political science at Brown University for a year, then from 1942 to 1945 taught public administration at the University of Michigan and also was Deputy Director of the Michigan State Civil Service Commission. In 1945 he served as director, civilian affairs in the U.S. Military Government in Germany, where he participated in the reconstruction of the occupied country. In 1953 he was appointed second dean of Cornell University's School of Business and Public Administration. His selection as Dean of the Johnson School coincided with a change in school curriculum, designed to bring the program into closer ties with the business community. Litchfield was born in Detroit, Michigan, and died in a plane crash over Lake Michigan. He was a member of the Executive Board of the International Political Science Association. Litchfield Towers, a set of three high-rise student residence halls on the University of Pittsburgh campus, are named in his honor. Virgil Cantini's 1966 steel with bronze and glass sculpture Ode to Space was commissioned as a tribute to Litchfield after his death. It sits outside the entrance to David Lawrence Hall and contains the inscription, labore ad astra or \"to work toward the stars.\""

He joined the Bolsheviks during his years as a student in the medical faculty of Kiev University, from which he graduated in 1916; he was immediately drafted into the army, where he served as a doctor and became prominent in the clandestine military organizations of the Bolsheviks. At the time of the October Revolution he was a member of the Military Revolutionary Committee of the Petrograd Soviet; on meeting him in November, Leon Trotsky was so impressed with his \"great creative élan combined with concentrated attention to detail\" that he appointed him his deputy on the Revolutionary Military Council, where he served with distinction during the Russian Civil War (1918-1920) and helped improve the fighting condition of the Red Army—Trotsky called him the Carnot of the Russian Revolution. In 1924 his position as Trotsky's deputy was taken over by Grigory Zinoviev's ally Mikhail Frunze. Instead, he was made chairman of the Mossukno state textile trust, and the following May he left on a tour of Germany, France, and the United States to acquire technical information. On August 27, 1925 he died in a boating accident on Long Lake (New York) along with Isay Khurgin, the first head of Amtorg Trading Corporation."

Self-taught, he began translating and publishing Hafez within the year. On the death of his father in 1842 he took over the family business. He married in 1845, and in 1850 entered Magdalen College, Oxford, where he studied and catalogued Persian manuscripts for the Bodleian Library. From 1856-1867 he lived in Calcutta as professor of English history at Presidency College. He was also as principal of Sanskrit College from 1858 to 1864. In this year he discovered a manuscript of Omar Khayyám's quatrains in the Asiatic Society's library and sent a copy to London for his friend and student, Edward Fitzgerald, who then produced the famous English translations (the Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam, 1859). He also published, unsigned, an introduction to Khayyám with translations of thirty quatrains in the Calcutta Review (1858). Having studied Hindustani, Bengali, and Sanskrit with Indian scholars, he returned to England to take up an appointment as the first professor of Sanskrit at Cambridge. He was professor from 1867 until his death in 1903. He was made an honorary member of the German Oriental Society (DMG) in 1895, was awarded the Royal Asiatic Society's first gold medal in 1898, and in 1902 became a founding member of the British Academy."

At the commencement ceremonies that year, he received an honorary doctorate from the College. Mrs. Priscilla Payne Hurd, Chair of the Moravian Board of Trustees, observed that “Erv Rokke has been one of Moravian’s finest and most successful presidents. Even by the standards of an institution that has existed for 264 years, his leadership, his integrity, and his achievement are extraordinary. By a huge measure, he has raised the quality of our students and programs, he has raised new buildings on our campuses, and he has raised our hopes and ambitions for an even brighter future. For nine very good years, we have been blessed and honored by his leadership and by his friendship.” Pamela Rokke was also honored for her extensive and steadfast support of College activities at every level, and most especially its students. Mrs. Hurd noted that “Pam Rokke is certainly one of the most gracious individuals who has lived in the president’s house. She is deeply admired by all members of our campus family: students, faculty, and administration alike.” For six years, Mrs. Rokke also served as an active member of the Board of Directors of New Bethany Ministries in Bethlehem. Following retirement from Moravian, the Rokkes have relocated to Monument, Colorado."

Empress Dan's father Dan Zheng (單徵) was a Di chieftain, who submitted to Han Zhao in 308. It is not known when she married Liu Yuan, but he made her his wife and empress in early 310, while also creating his son Liu He, by his first wife Empress Huyan crown prince. (However, Empress Dan's son Liu Ai (劉乂), while described as young in 310, was already capable of independent thinking, implying that he was probably born before 300.) Liu Yuan died later that year and was succeeded by Liu He, who was however overthrown and killed by Liu Cong after only a week as emperor. Liu Cong initially offered the throne to Liu Ai, but Liu Ai declined, and Liu Cong took the throne himself. He honored Empress Dan as empress dowager and created her son Liu Ai crown prince. Empress Dowager Dan was described as still young and beautiful at this point, and she carried on an affair with Liu Cong, which was considered incest in traditional Chinese tradition. Crown Prince Ai became aware of the affair and tried to persuade her to end it. Knowing that her son knew about the affair, she died late in 310, being described of having died \"of her shame,\" implying the possibility that she might have committed suicide."

Zhang Huiguang was the daughter of Zhang Shi (張寔, not to be confused as the Jin official whose domain later evolved into Former Liang), the nephew of Liu Cong's mother Empress Dowager Zhang. In 312, at Empress Dowager Zhang's insistence, Liu Cong took Zhang Huiguang and her sister to be his concubines. Later that year, he wanted to create another concubine, Liu Ying (劉英), empress, but Empress Zhang insisted that he create Zhang Huiguang empress. He did so in early 313. Three months later, Empress Dowager Zhang died. Empress Zhang mourned her so greatly and was so depressed that she died as well."

  "text" : "Empress Liu E (劉娥) (died 314), courtesy name Lihua (麗華), formally Empress Wuxuan (武宣皇后, literally \"the martial and responsible empress\") was an empress of the Chinese/Xiongnu state Han Zhao. She was Liu Cong (Emperor Zhaowu)'s third wife. Liu E was the daughter of one of Liu Cong's honored officials, Liu Yin (劉殷), who was described as someone who was willing to point out Liu Cong's faults, but only doing so in private, thus earning the temperamental and impulsive emperor's respect. She was initially taken as a concubine by him in 312, along with her sister Liu Ying (劉英) and four of her nieces. This move was opposed by Liu Cong's brother and crown prince Liu Ai (劉乂), who argued it would be a violation of the prohibition against endogamy. Liu Cong, however, rationalized the move in that Liu Yin was ethnically Han, while he himself was ethnically Xiongnu, and therefore were not of the same ancestor. Liu E and her sister Liu Ying were both favored by Liu Cong. Initially, in 312, Liu Cong wanted to create Liu Ying empress to replace Empress Huyan, who died earlier that year, but at his mother Empress Dowager Zhang's insistence, he created another concubine, Zhang Huiguang empress instead. Liu Ying died soon thereafter. In 313, Empress Zhang died. Liu Cong created Liu E empress and wanted to build a palace for her. His minister Chen Yuanda (陳元達) tried to persuade that it was overly wasteful, and Liu Cong, in anger, ordered Chen's execution. However, the new empress interceded, and Chen was spared and further promoted. For the next year, under Empress Liu's and Chen's advice, Liu Cong was said to have corrected his behavior to some extent. Empress Liu herself was described as intelligent and kind. However, she died in 314. It was said that from that point on, Liu Cong's palace would be thoroughly in a confused state, and Liu Cong's own personal behavior appeared to degenerate after this, without her counsel."

Daniel McGilvary and Mrs. Sophia McGilvary. He came to the United States to study, graduating from Davidson College (N.C.) in 1884 and from Princeton University (A.M.) in 1888. In 1891, he returned to northern Thailand to join his parents in the Laos Mission of the Presbyterian Church USA. Although assigned to translate the Bible into northern Thai, McGilvary was soon embroiled in a denominational controversy over biblical inerrancy. In the wake of the 1893 heresy trial of Charles Augustus Briggs, whose views on Scripture he agreed with, McGilvary resigned from the Laos Mission in 1894 and returned to the United States. For five years, he taught at the University of California where he received the degree of Ph.D. in 1897. His exploits included a fellowship at Princeton Theological Seminary; the translation into northern Thai of Matthew, Luke, John, and the Acts of the Apostles; serving as Sage professor of ethics at Cornell University in 1899; serving as professor of philosophy at the University of Wisconsin–Madison (1905); being president of the Western Philosophical Society in 1910-1911; and serving as president of the American Philosophical Association in 1912-1913."

  "text" : "Captain Edward \"Ned\" Low (also spelled Lowe or Loe; c.1690—c.1724) was a notorious English pirate during the latter days of the Golden Age of Piracy, in the early 18th century. He was born around 1690 into poverty in Westminster, London, and was a thief from an early age. Low moved to Boston, Massachusetts, as a young man. His wife died in childbirth in late 1719. Two years later, he became a pirate, operating off the coasts of New England and the Azores, and in the Caribbean. He captained a number of ships, usually maintaining a small fleet of three or four. Low and his pirate crews captured at least a hundred ships during his short career, burning most of them. Although he was active for only three years, Low remains notorious as one of the most vicious pirates of the age, with a reputation for violently torturing his victims before killing them. Sir Arthur Conan Doyle described Low as \"savage and desperate,\" and a man of \"amazing and grotesque brutality\". The New York Times called him a torturer, whose methods would have \"done credit to the ingenuity of the Spanish Inquisition in its darkest days\". The circumstances of Low's death, which took place around 1724, have been the subject of much speculation."

By the time David was twenty (in 1885), it is believed he was already doing business under his own name. By 1888 he was making musical instruments. By 1904 his business had grown to become a small instrument factory. After his death the factory kept the name of Ernst David, but was owned by his son Albert David. The instrument company specialized in making brass instruments, many of which were used by Posaunen (brass horns) choirs in Protestant congregations in Germany and beyond. Johannes Kuhlo collaborated with Ernst David to develop the Kuhlohorn for use by Posaunen choirs.Some Ernst David instruments are still in regular use. Several examples can be found in musical instrument collections. Presently it is not clear when the instrument factory stopped operating; most likely it was during World War II. \n* Business Letter, Instrumentmaker Ernst David, Bielefeld (Germany), 1935 \n* Kuhlo-Flügelhorn (Kuhlohorn) \n* Johannes Kuhlo playing a Kuhlohorn crafted by Ernst David"

  "text" : "Elmer Truesdell Merrill (1860 – 20 April 1936) was an American Latin scholar, born at Millville, Massachusetts. Merrill graduated from Wesleyan University in 1881. He is primarily remembered for his student edition of the Roman poet Catullus and for his studies on the text and tradition of the Letters of Pliny the Younger, culminating in his 1914 Teubner edition, which constituted an important basis for the works of later scholars. Merrill taught at the Massachusetts State Normal School, Westfield, Massachusetts (1882–83), at Wesleyan University (1883–86), at University of Southern California (1887–88), again at Wesleyan (1888–1905) as professor of Latin language and literature, and at Trinity College, Hartford, Connecticut (1905–08). In 1908 he became professor of Latin at the University of Chicago, where he taught until his retirement in 1925. In 1898–99, he was professor, in 1899–1900, acting chairman, in 1900–01, chairman of the work of the American School of Classical Studies in Rome. After 1906 he was associate editor of Classical Philology, and in 1906–07 he served as president of the American Philological Association. He was ordained a priest in the Episcopal Church in 1895 and received an LL.D from the University of St. Andrews in 1911. In 1923, the Bibliotheca Teubneriana published Merrill's scholarly edition of Catullus. His effort was not well received by fellow Classicists, most notably the poet and scholar A. E. Housman, who offered a particularly scathing review. Merrill's student edition of Catullus remained a standard in American classrooms for much of the twentieth century."

Less than a year later, Li Ban was assassinated by Li Xiong's son Li Yue (李越), who subsequently made another son of Li Xiong, Li Qi, whom Empress Dowager Ren had also raised, emperor. Li Yue forged an edict from Empress Dowager Ren to legitimize his actions. During Li Qi's reign, she continued as empress dowager. When Li Qi was overthrown by Li Shou in 338, Li Shou forged an edict from Empress Dowager Ren as well to legitimize his actions, implying that she was still alive at that point, but there was no more mention of her in history from that point on.

  "text" : "Edgar Shannon Anderson (November 9, 1897 – June 18, 1969) was an American botanist. His 1949 book Introgressive Hybridization was an original and important contribution to botanical genetics. Anderson was born in Forestville, New York, when he was three his family moved to East Lansing, Michigan where his father had accepted a position to teach dairy husbandry. In 1914 Anderson entered Michigan State College to study botany and horticulture. After completing his degree he joined the Naval Reserve and in 1919 he accepted a graduate position at the Bussey Institution of Harvard University. His studies were supervised by geneticist Edward Murray East and Anderson worked on the genetics of self-incompatibility in Nicotiana. He was awarded a master's degree in 1920 and a DSc in agricultural genetics in 1922. He accepted a position as a geneticist at the Missouri Botanical Garden and was appointed assistant professor of botany at Washington University in St. Louis. His research was focused on developing techniques to quantify geographic variation in Iris versicolor. In 1929 he received a fellowship to undertake studies at the John Innes Horticultural Institute in Britain, where he worked with cytogeneticist C. D. Darlington, statistician R. A. Fisher, and geneticist J. B. S. Haldane. Anderson's data set on three related species of irises was used by Fisher as an example with which to demonstrate statistical methods of classification and has subsequently become very well known in the machine learning community, though often described as Fisher's iris data. Anderson returned to the United States in 1931 and took a position at the Arnold Arboretum at Harvard where he worked with geneticist Karl Sax. In 1935 he returned to Missouri and in 1937 received the Engelmann Professorship in botany at Washington University. In 1941 he was invited to present the Jesup Lectures at Columbia University with Ernst Mayr, discussing the role of genetics on plant systematics, however unlike the other presenters of the Jesup Lectures who later wrote regarded as the foundation of the modern evolutionary synthesis, he never completed his accompanying manuscript. He published Introgressive Hybridization in 1949 which described the role of introgression in speciation. He also wrote the popular science book Plants, Man, and Life which was published in 1952. He was briefly director of the Missouri Gardens in 1954, but returned to teaching in 1957. He retired officially in 1967. Anderson was a close colleague and friend of Esther Lederberg . They frequented the Cold Spring Harbor Symposia and had many other colleagues in common, such as J. B. S. Haldane. Anderson was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1934. In 1954, He was an elected a member of the National Academy of Sciences. He was also president of the Botanical Society of America, and was a charter member of the Society for the Study of Evolution and the Herb Society. He received the Darwin-Wallace Medal of the Linnean Society. The standard author abbreviation E.S.Anderson is used to indicate this individual as the author when citing a botanical name."

  "text" : "Ernest Augustus Anderson (24 March 1859 – 5 April 1945) was installed in Hay, New South Wales as the second Anglican Bishop of the Diocese of Riverina, New South Wales Australia, on 11 February 1896, at a time of financial difficulty for the church. Anderson was born in Milton Damerel, Devon, England and educated at Bedford School. He went to North Queensland as a mission preacher in 1882. Because of the continuing drought and rabbit plague, station owners no longer had the means of supporting the church, which meant that clergy had to work for almost nothing. Anderson's episcopate was also a time of conflict between the bishop and his clergy and the clergy and their parishioners. By the turn of the century, new towns were flourishing throughout the Riverina, as the growing wheat industry gave the district a much needed economic boost. Anderson retired from active ministry in 1925, leaving twice as many parishes in the diocese as he took over originally."

  "text" : "Elmer Gertz (September 14, 1906 – April 27, 2000) was an American lawyer, writer, law professor, and civil rights activist. During his lengthy legal career he won some high-profile cases, most notably parole for notorious killer Nathan Leopold and the obscenity trial of Henry Miller's novel Tropic of Cancer, a book published in France but banned in the United States because of its \"candid sexuality\" in describing the author's life in Paris. In addition to accounts of his cases and career, he also reviewed books and edited a collection of works by Frank Harris, whom he represented as literary agent for a while. He is best remembered in the legal world, however, for a case in which he was not an advocate but a plaintiff: Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc., a libel action he brought against the John Birch Society in 1969 after it accused him of being part of a Communist conspiracy to discredit local police departments. He prevailed, but only after a 14-year battle that saw the case go before the Supreme Court, which ruled that as a private figure Gertz did not have to prove actual malice on the defendants' part. When the case finally went to trial, the jury found in favor of Elmer Gertz and awarded him compensatory damages of $100,000 and punitive damages of $300,000. The award was upheld on appeal."

  "text" : "The Honourable George Edward Adeane, CVO (4 October 1939 – 20 May 2015), was Private Secretary to the Prince of Wales from 1979 to 1985. Adeane was born in 1939, son of Sir Michael Adeane and Helen Chetwynd-Stapleton, the daughter of Richard Chetwynd-Stapleton. The family had a long history of service to the royal family. Arthur Bigge, later Lord Stamfordham was private secretary to George V. His daughter Victoria Bigge married George Adeane, parents of Sir Michael. Edward was educated at Eton College and Magdalene College, Cambridge, where he graduated with an MA. He was a Page of Honour to The Queen from 1954 to 1956. In 1960–1961 he was a Plebiscite Supervisor in the Southern Cameroon. He was called to the Bar at the Middle Temple in July 1962, and specialised in libel until 1979. As a barrister he defended Time Out magazine, owned by Playboy Publications, Inc., in 1973, when they had accused Fiona Lewis, an actress, of being involved with South American revolutionaries. She was awarded damages. The following he represented The Spectator magazine who had libeled publishers Jonathan Cape, suggesting they were in financial difficulties, and won a similar outcome in that case. In 1975 he was more successful in representing Marcia, Lady Falkender, who was falsely accused of forging the signature of her boss, former Prime Minister Harold Wilson. She was paid damages and costs. In 1977, Adeane represented Marlene Dietrich, the glamorous Hollywood actress, in a libel case brought by producer Alexander Cohen and Brentwood TV, of New York, for breach of contract, as a disreputable performer. Adeane was appointed Private Secretary and Treasurer to the Prince of Wales in May 1979 to succeed Sqdr Ldr David Checketts. Prince Charles and Edward Adeane shared a passion in angling on the River Test near Stockbridge, Hampshire. They were members of the Houghton Fishing Club, where Adeane continued to fish right up until his last days. On the engagement of Lady Diana Spencer and the Prince, she was due to arrive at Albany House, where Adeane had a barrister's set. The staff expected octogenarian Lady Diana Cooper, but were bemused to find a much younger lady arrive in her Mini Metro and park perfectly. Princess Diana had a nervous start in a royal household, where she dismissed almost all of the staff. Adeane was made the Princess's Treasurer in 1981 on their marriage. Adeane was granted the additional appointment as private secretary to the Princess in 1984, following Oliver Everett's resignation. The alleged trouble started during the 1983 royal tour of Australia and New Zealand, when the Princess first expressed concern at leaving her children behind in London. The socializing Daily Mirror stirred up speculation. accusing her of calling Adeane a \"fuddy-duddy\" drawing on a storm of doubt. When Adeane tried to plan a tour of Australia in 1984, he was accused of trying to manipulate State elections in Victoria for political purposes. In attempting to distance the Premier, Adeane was quoted in the Daily Mirror and other newspapers. The controversy behind the scenes stirred royal watchers to speculate that all was not well with the royal marriage when finally, the Prince and Princess of Wales stepped onto the Canberra tarmac early in October 1985. \"Obviously the key to this confusion will depend on whether Prince Charles wishes to adhere to the advice given in your letter of 15 May, 1984, or not!\" exclaimed a rather uppity courtier. The prince had changed the itinerary on several points, leaving an exasperated secretary to make a number of public pronouncements.What made matters worse was what assistant secretary called a \"bombshell\" dropped by RAAF which refused to carry the royal couple from Heathrow, but could only pick up from Bahrain or Singapore. Angry at being told to 'wait around' at foreign airports, Prince Charles deplored the chaos, and ultimately 'heads would roll.' It did not help matters that Major Ronald Ferguson, royal polo manager was imbroiled in the disorganized mess on board. The Australians objected to the mounting costs to the taxpayer; and the Americans suggested that on their leg, the RAF pick them up from Washington DC. Ironically Prince Charles cut the itinerary down to avoid inappropriate and stressful visits and not cost. But the consequences added to the growing disharmony in the royal household, for which Adeane had primary responsibility. Adeane resigned after disagreements and accusations that he was taking decisions without consulting the prince, and being too much of the 'old school tie' about him. However Adeane found that the prince invariably did the opposite of what he was advised. An almost unprecedented state of affairs materialized on 19 March 1985, when the press were invited into Buckingham Palace to discuss relations. Evidently the last straw for Adeane he resigned on 31 March 1985. He was Equerry to the Prince of Wales 1979–1981, and was an Extra Equerry from 1985. He represented the Prince at Royal Household memorial services - and returned to practice at the Bar. His departure commenced a period of instability in royal sinecures, including the Queen's annus horribilis, with several private secretaries coming and going in short order. He was replaced by Sir John Riddell. Adeane may have lost the prince's favour, but he continued to be a regular guest of the Queen Mother at Birkhall every September for the grouse shooting season."

  "text" : "Eddie Dombrower (born 1957) is an American computer game and video game designer, programmer and producer. He is best known as the co-creator of the seminal baseball games Earl Weaver Baseball and Intellivision World Series Baseball. He is also recognized for designing the first dance notation computer software, DOM. Dombrower studied both dance and mathematics at Pomona College in Claremont, California. After his graduation he found it frustrating that the new microcomputer technology had not solved an age-old problem: how choreographers could record their work in written form. He created the DOM system on an Apple II computer in 1981, which allowed choreographers to use a simple system of codes to enter their work. The resulting dance movements were then performed by a figure on screen. In 1982 Intellivision game design director Don Daglow (also a Pomona College graduate) recruited Dombrower to join Mattel to work on a new kind of baseball game that for the first time would feature large on-screen animated figures and multiple camera angles. Prior video games all showed a static or scrolling playfield from a single camera angle, and Daglow believed that Dombrower's experience with DOM made him the perfect programmer and animator to create the game. Dombrower made progress quickly, and Intellivision World Series Baseball's radically new design created a major market event during the Christmas television advertising season in 1982. Although the title enjoyed limited distribution because of the Video game crash of 1983, it succeeded in its ambition to prove that video games could mimic television coverage of sports events, and soon all major sports games followed its stylistic lead. In 1986 Daglow, then working at Electronic Arts, sought out Dombrower once again. EA Founder Trip Hawkins had agreed to back the creation of another revolutionary baseball game, Earl Weaver Baseball. As they had done at Intellvision, Daglow designed the baseball simulation and overall look, while Dombrower designed the game's sophisticated visual presentation and its underlying technology. In contrast to some celebrity athletes who merely lent their names to projects, Hall of Fame manager Earl Weaver worked with the team to design the game's artificial intelligence. When the game appeared in 1987, it was hailed by Computer Gaming World as one of the 25 best games of all time, and its success helped pave the way for the creation of the EA Sports brand and product line. Dombrower also led the development of the sequel, Earl Weaver Baseball II. Dombrower also developed EWB Baseball for the iPhone, the spiritual successor to the Earl Weaver series, which was released March 23, 2009."

  "text" : "Elena Gaja (born October 26, 1946 in Braşov, Romania) is a Romanian mezzo-soprano opera singer. She graduated from the Ciprian Porumbescu Music Academy in Bucharest where she studied under Magda Ianculescu. A stage actress, Gaja had an affinity for the French opera repertoire and also for Verdi and verismo. She distinguished herself from the other mezzo sopranos by her rare type of mezzosoprano-contralto voice in the tradition of Marietta Alboni and Clara Butt with a cavernous low register and a powerful dark-coloured voice which earned her the name of a viola da gamba. In December 1982, she won joint first prize in the Concorso Internazionale \"Vincenzo Bellini\" per Cantanti Lirici in Italy, becoming the first Romanian singer to have won this prize. She was a soloist of the Romanian National Opera in Timişoara and toured throughout Europe as well as performing at the George Enescu Festival. She appeared most frequently as Carmen which became one of her hallmarks and which she performed more than 300 times. She retired from the stage in 1996 but continued to give concerts and opera recitals with a repertoire that includes opera arias, sacred arias, oratorio, lied to tango, zarzuelas and film music. She also taught at the Faculty of Music at the Timişoara University of the West."

Leith received his B.S. in physics from Wayne State University in 1949 and his M.S. in physics in 1952. He received his Ph.D. in electrical engineering from Wayne State in 1978. Much of Leith's holographic work was an outgrowth of his research on synthetic aperture radar (SAR) performed while a member of the Radar Laboratory of the University of Michigan's  Willow Run Laboratory beginning in 1952. Leith joined the University of Michigan as a research assistant and was promoted to graduate research assistant in 1955, research associate in 1956, research engineer in 1960, associate professor in 1965, and full professor in 1968. Professor Leith and his coworker Juris Upatnieks at the University of Michigan displayed the world's first three-dimensional hologram at a conference of the Optical Society of America in 1964. He received the 1960 IEEE Morris N. Liebmann Memorial Award and the Stuart Ballantine Medal in 1969. In 1979, President Jimmy Carter awarded Leith with the National Medal of Science for his research. He was awarded the 1985 Frederic Ives Medal by the OSA."

Born in Manila, she was infamous for the first on-screen kiss in a Filipino movie, Ang Tatlong Hambog (1926). In 1930, she met US General Douglas MacArthur and became his mistress. He arranged for her to follow him to Washington, D.C.. While serving as Army Chief of Staff in the 1930s, MacArthur filed a libel action against a journalist at The Washington Post, Drew Pearson. When Pearson added Cooper to his list of witnesses to be deposed, MacArthur dropped the suit. MacArthur subsequently paid Cooper $15,000 to leave Washington, the money allegedly delivered by his aide, Dwight Eisenhower. However, she did not return to the Philippines, and after a few failed attempts in Hollywood and a hair dressing shop in the Midwest, committed suicide in 1960."

  "text" : "Enrique Banchs (1888 – 1968) was an Argentine poet. He published all his work in the space of four years at the beginning of the 20th century, then lay dormant until his death. In his four works, Las barcas (1907), El libro de los elogios (1908), El cascabel del halcón (1909) and La urna (1911). Banchs cultivated an ephemeral, classicistic style drawing inspiration from the Siglo de Oro. His final work was composed in sonnets, a form which had already been almost completely abandoned by that time. Banchs published nothing during the final fifty years of his life, but he remained a part of the Argentine literary scene, and a member of the Argentine Academy of Letters. He was friend of Carlos Alberto Leumann."

Though Lawson was primarily a landscape painter, he also painted a small number of realistic urban scenes. His painting style is heavily influenced by the art of John Henry Twachtman, J. Alden Weir, and Alfred Sisley. Though considered an American Impressionist, Lawson falls stylistically between Impressionism and realism."

  "text" : "Edward F. Sands, born Edward Fitzgerald Snyder, a.k.a. Edward Fitzwilliam Strathmore, a.k.a. Jazz, (April 4, 1894 in Marion, Ohio - ?) was a suspect in the murder of Hollywood director William Desmond Taylor on February 1, 1922. Edward Sands had been employed as Taylor's personal assistant, serving as cook and valet. Although he was born in Ohio, he spoke with an affected British accent (screen star Mary Miles Minter referred to him as a cockney). Taylor left Sands in charge of his affairs during a vacation in 1921 and returned to find Sands gone and several of the director's possessions missing including his car, chequebook, a large supply of distinctive cigarettes and jewelry. Sands had cashed several blank cheques left by Taylor and, using the stolen checkbook, began forging Taylor's signature. A few months later Taylor received a letter from Sands which included a pawn ticket in the name of William Deane Tanner (Taylor's birth name), indicating that Sands knew Taylor's true identity, which Taylor had kept secret since his arrival in Hollywood eight years earlier. Sands seems to have returned clandestinely. One of the distinctive, stolen cigarettes was found (smoked and crushed) on Taylor's doorstep and footprints were left on Taylor's bed. Some more of Taylor's jewelry was stolen and receipts were found showing Sands had sold the items in northern California. An eyewitness reported seeing someone leaving Taylor's bungalow around the time he was murdered, but her description does not fully match Sands' appearance. The police considered Sands a strong suspect, but never issued a warrant for his arrest in connection with the murder. Sands reportedly quit a job in northern California and disappeared the day of the murder. Subsequent investigations turned up evidence he had likely been arrested previously for petty crimes and had apparently deserted from the United States Coast Guard. Sands was never found."

  "text" : "Eugene Rabinowitch (1901–1973) was a Russian-born American biophysicist who is best known for his work in relation to nuclear weapons, especially as a co-author of the Franck Report and a co-founder in 1945 of the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, a global security and public policy magazine, which he edited until his death. When Rabinowitch arrived in New York City, he was assisted by Selig Hecht, a man whose spontaneous sympathy, friendship and assistance were so generously given to me when I first came to America and felt lost in the human sea of New York. During World War II, Rabinowitch worked in the Metallurgical Laboratory (or \"Met Lab\"), the Manhattan Project's division at the University of Chicago. At that time he was a member of the Committee on Political and Social Problems, chaired by James Franck. Rabinowitch wrote (with help from Leó Szilárd) what became known as the Franck Report. The report recommended that nuclear energy be brought under civilian rather than military control and argued that the United States should demonstrate the atomic bomb to world leaders in an uninhabited desert or barren island before using it in combat. The social and ethical concerns expressed in the Franck Report translated into the guiding principles of the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, founded by Rabinowitch and fellow physicist Hyman Goldsmith. In the twenty-fifth anniversary issue of the Bulletin, Rabinowitch wrote that the magazine's purpose \"was to awaken the public to full understanding of the horrendous reality of nuclear weapons and of their far-reaching implications for the future of mankind; to warn of the inevitability of other nations acquiring nuclear weapons within a few years, and of the futility of relying on America's possession of the 'secret' of the bomb.\" Over the years, Rabinowitch wrote more than 100 articles for the magazine, most of them editorials. Before the war, Rabinowitch passionately pursued research in photosynthesis, a field in which he was to become a leader. After World War II, Rabinowitch taught and researched botany as a professor at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, continuing his photosynthesis work and publishing the three-volume Photosynthesis and Related Processes, as well as many other books. A bibliography of Rabinowitch's publications was compiled by Govindjee at the Department of Botany, University of Illinois. The papers of Rabinowitch are held in the Special Collections at the University of Chicago Library."

  "text" : "Ernst Edler von Schuch, born Ernst Gottfried Schuch (23 November 1846, Graz – 10 May 1914, Niederlößnitz/Radebeul Dresden) was an Austrian conductor who became famous through his working collaborations with Richard Strauss at the Dresden Court Opera. Schuch first studied law but then turned to music, trained at first by E. Stolz. He studied in Graz and later in Vienna, briefly with Felix Otto Dessoff, and started his conducting career in 1867 as Kapellmeister at Lobe's Theatre in Breslau while the Breslau Opera was out of action following a fire. Coincidentally, a father and son with the same family name Schuch had built and run the first opera theatre in Breslau 120 years earlier: There followed engagements in Würzburg (1868–1870), Graz (1870/1871) and Basle, until he was employed in 1872 by Pollini's Italian Opera for Dresden. There in 1872 he became Music director at the Court Opera, from 1873 Royal Kapellmeister with Julius Rietz, later with Franz Wüllner. In 1878, he was appointed Royal Professor. In 1882 he undertook the direction of the Court Opera with the title of privy councillor, and in 1889 became its general music director. From 1882 onward, he lived in Niederlößnitz in the Weintraubenstraße (in 1883 renamed at his own suggestion as Schuchstraße 15/17). In 1898, he was ennobled by the Austrian emperor and in 1899 was appointed to the Saxon Confidential Privy Council. His period of influence is known as the Schuch era in operatic performing history. Tours as guest conductor in Berlin, Munich, Vienna and Paris aside, he remained committed to Dresden until 1914, and made its opera house there into one of the leading musical stages of Europe. He created a surpassing ensemble and enlarged the orchestra to make it one of the greatest in the world. Specializing in the music-dramas of Wagner, he also led the original productions of the Richard Strauss operas Feuersnot (1901), Salome (1905), Elektra (1909) and Der Rosenkavalier (1911) as well as the first German productions of operas by Puccini and Mascagni, and the Dresden première of Wagner's Parsifal on 24 March 1914, his last new production before his death on 10 May. Also highly valued as a nonoperatic conductor, he was particularly known in the concert hall for his renditions of the orchestral works of Felix Draeseke and Strauss. He married coloratura soprano Clementine von Schuch-Proska (Klementine Procházka) (1850-1932), who became an honorary member of Dresden's Royal Theatre Company. Their daughter Liesel von Schuch sang in Dresden (from 1914 on) and Vienna."

  "text" : "Elisabeth Meyer (1899 – 1968) was a Norwegian photographer and journalist who is best known for her photo-journalistic work from travels through Iran and India in the 1920s and 1930s, among them early photographs of Mahatma Gandhi. Meyer traveled through Iran on her own and may have been the first Western woman to travel through Iran in this way. There was a total ban on photographing in Iran at the time and she was arrested several times, but released with a warning. In Turkey she visited Kemal Atatürk in his private residence and his bedroom covered in pink silk. In Irak she interviewed king Faisal in his \"palais just outside Baghdad\". In India the young Indira Nehru helped Meyer visit the imprisoned Mahatma Gandhi, and she described the meeting like this: «Any other man would appear ridiculous in that outfit, but with regard to Gandhi all criticism is silenced. I was never particularly enthusiastic about Gandhi, but now I am completely converted. He is one of the most sympathetic humans I have ever met, he is truly a great man.» Meyer also visited Syria, Mexico and Alaska. Meyer was born in Tønsberg to an affluent family. Her father gave her a Kodak Folding Camera for her travels, which seems to have led to her professional choice later. She joined the Oslo Camera Club in 1932, and then traveled to Berlin in 1937 to study photography at the Reimann School, where she studied with Walter Peterhans and Otto Croy. She worked as an apprentice for Joszef Pécsi in Budapest before returning to Norway, where she spent the war years. Meyer produced material for various publications including National Geographic Magazine and Aftenposten."

Whitlock, who ran as a teenager and took up the sport again in his forties, first became the oldest person to run a marathon in less than 3 hours in 2000, at the age of 69, with a time of 2:52:47. Since then, he has continued to extend this record, most recently when he ran a time of 2:58:40 at the age of 74. His best time since turning 70 was 2:54:48 when he was 73, a world record for men 70 to 74. According to an article in The New York Times, if age-graded, this time is equivalent to a 20-year-old running 2:03:57 and to 2010 this time would have been the fastest marathon ever run. For an explanation of age-graded tables, see masters athletics. As of 2016, he is still the only person over 70 to run a marathon in less than three hours."

  "text" : "Edmund Lockyer, (21 January 1784 – 10 June 1860) was a British soldier and explorer of Australia. Born in Plymouth, Devon, Lockyer was son of Thomas Lockyer, a sailmaker, and his wife Ann, née Grose. Lockyer began his army career as an ensign in the 19th Regiment in June 1803, was promoted lieutenant in early 1805 and made captain in August 1805. Lockyer was promoted to major in August 1819 and in August 1824 transferred to the 57th Regiment. Lockyer arrived at Sydney, capital of the British Colony of New South Wales, aboard the Royal Charlotte in April 1825 with men from the 57th; also with him were his wife and ten children. In August 1825, Lockyer was asked to lead an expedition to explore the upper reaches of the Brisbane River, which had only recently been settled by Europeans. On 2 September, Lockyer sailed from Sydney in the cutter Mermaid, arriving at the settlement of Brisbane on 7 September. Leaving the Mermaid at Brisbane, he travelled in a small boat up the river. Lockyer saw coal in deposits on the banks, becoming the first person to identify coal in Queensland. Lockyer arrived back in Sydney on 16 October 1825, and made a report to Governor Sir Thomas Brisbane. In late 1826, Lockyer led an expedition to claim Western Australia for Britain. He sailed on the brig Amity, arriving at King George Sound on 25 December, with twenty troops and twenty three convicts. This was the beginning of the first European settlement in Western Australia. On 21 January 1827, as instructed by the Secretary of State for War and the Colonies Earl Bathurst, the Union Jack was raised and a feu de joie fired by the troops, formally annexing the territory, in assertion of the first official claim by the Imperial Government to British possession over the whole continent of Australia. The military base established by Lockyer was named Frederick Town, later renamed Albany, and would become an important deep water port. His interview with two sealers, arrested for crimes against local people, revealed intelligence of Dumont D'Urville's survey of King George Sound. Lockyer had planned an overland journey to the Swan River region in February, but learned that James Stirling had already examined the area. Lockyer was to remain in the settlement until command could be given to Captain Joseph Wakefield. Lockyer returned to Sydney on 3 April 1827, sold his army commission and settled in Sydney. In 1852 Lockyer was appointed serjeant-at-arms to the New South Wales Legislative Council and on 16 May 1856 he became the Council's first Usher of the Black Rod. In September 1854 he was commissioned a captain on the formation of the Sydney Volunteer Rifle Corps, a citizens' militia force. On 18 November 1854, Lockyer married Elizabeth Colston. Elizabeth Colston is related to Mal Colston, a Queensland Senator. Lockyer died from the effects of influenza on 10 June 1860 at his home in Bay Street, Woolloomooloo and was buried in Camperdown Cemetery, Sydney. The Sydney suburb of Ermington is named after Lockyer's residence, \"Ermington House\". A suburb of Albany, Western Australia, commemorates the city's founder. Lockyer Creek, Lockyer Valley and Lockyer Valley Regional Council in Queensland were named after Major Lockyer."

  "text" : "Emily Fox (born April 23, 1987) is a former world record holder at sport stacking. She set the overall world record in the cycle (7.43 seconds) in April 2002 and the 3-6-3 (2.72 seconds). However, in 2006, her cycle record was beaten (by Robin Stangenberg from Germany with a time of 7.41 seconds). Her 3-6-3 record was also broken in 2007 by Robin Stangenberg and Yannick Zittlau of Germany with a time of 2.70 seconds. She has appeared on several television shows, including The Ellen DeGeneres Show and The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson, to demonstrate her skills. Emily is the eldest child of Bob Fox, the founder of Speed Stacks, and grew up in Highlands Ranch, Colorado. Her two brothers, Kit and Brennan, are also successful at sport stacking. Kit also wrote a book and twice completed the Chicago Marathon. Fox is also a skilled basketball player. In her senior year at ThunderRidge high school she led the team to a number 7 finish in the USA Today high school national poll and was named a Parade Magazine high school All-American. She played college basketball for the University of Minnesota. In her four years she averaged 11.7 points per game.

  "text" : "Edgar Andrew Collard, CM (6 September 1911 – 9 September 2000) was a Canadian journalist and historian, best known for his Montreal Gazette column \"All Our Yesterdays\". He was born in Montreal, Quebec. He received his MA in history from McGill University in 1937. However health problems prevented him from completing his formal studies and ended his hopes of becoming a history professor. Collard's association with The Montreal Gazette began when he submitted articles on Montreal's history. This led to an offer of a full-time job in the newspaper's library. The first issue of his column \"All Our Yesterdays\" appeared in The Montreal Gazette on August 14, 1944 and appeared every weekend for 56 years. Each week the column addressed an episode or aspect of Montreal history. The column was reportedly read by such luminaries as Pierre Trudeau and Robertson Davies. His columns were compiled in several books which were illustrated by his longtime collaborator John Collins. In 1949, he won the inaugural National Newspaper Award for editorial writing and was to win it another three times, a record unmatched in that category. In 1953, he became editor-in-chief of The Gazette, retiring from that position in 1971. He continued his column until a month before his death. He was survived by his wife, the historian Elizabeth Collard who died soon after. Collard was made a Member of the Order of Canada in 1976."

  "text" : "Eadwulf or Eadulf (died 913) was a ruler in Northumbria in the early tenth century. According to genealogy of Waltheof, Earl of Northampton (and Northumbria), Eadwulf was the son of Æthelthryth daughter of Ælla, King of Northumbria--though this genealogy is not a contemporary one. The history of Northumbria in the ninth and tenth centuries is poorly recorded. English sources generally date from the twelfth century although some more nearly contemporary Irish annals report some events in Northumbria. Numismatic evidence—mints at York continued to produce coins throughout the period—is of considerable importance, although not in the period of Eadwulf's presumed floruit as a new style of coinage appeared in Northumbria between 905 and 927 approximately. These coins bore the name of the city of York and the legend \"Saint Peter's money\" but no kings are named, so that they are of no help in determining the succession of rulers. The only thing which can be said with reasonable certainty of Eadwulf is that he died in 913 in Northumbria, an event recorded by the chronicle of Æthelweard and by the Irish Annals of Ulster and Annals of Clonmacnoise. The Irish sources call him \"king of the Saxons of the north\" while Æthelweard says Eadwulf \"ruled as reeve of the town called Bamburgh\". The Historia de Sancto Cuthberto states that Eadwulf had been a favourite (dilectus) of King Alfred the Great. Historians have traditionally followed Æthelweard and portrayed Eadwulf as ruler of only the northern part of Northumbria, perhaps corresponding to the former kingdom of Bernicia, with Scandinavian or Norse-Gael kings ruling the southern part, the former kingdom of Deira, an area broadly similar to Yorkshire. Some historians now question this. For example, Benjamin Hudson writes that Eadwulf \"might have ruled just the northern part of Northumbria, the old Kingdom of Bernicia, although it is not impossible that he ruled all of Northumbria\" and Clare Downham notes that the death of Eadwulf \"is so widely reported in 913 that it seems hard to envisage that his fame derived from a three-year reign\". Some interpretations make Eadwulf ruler in Bernicia after Ecgberht II, that is to say from the 870s approximately. David Rollason described Eadwulf as an earl who flourished between about 890 and 912, and ruled an area north of the River Tyne and extending into what is now southern Scotland from the old Northumbrian royal centre at Bamburgh. According to Benjamin Hudson, in 913 Eadred son of Rixinc invaded Eadwulf's territory and killed him, then seized his wife and went to the sanctuary of the lands of St Cuthbert south of the River Tyne. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle refers to sons of Eadwulf and two sons are recorded, Ealdred (died after 927) and Uhtred (perhaps Uhtred); both may have ruled some part of Northumbria. Another two sons are attested in other elsewhere: Adulf (which McGuigan suggests represents ′Æthelwulf′) is the ′King of the Northern Saxons′ whose obit was recorded in the Annals of Clonmacnoise for a year representing 934; another, Oswulf, is named in a genealogy reproduced by De Northumbria post Britannos (this is probably the later 'high reeve' Oswulf, fl. 934–954)."

Along with Edward Robinson, he made two trips to the Holy Land in 1838 and 1852, acting as an interpreter for Robinson in his quest to identify and record biblical place names in Palestine. He is known for bringing the first printing press with Arabic type to Syria. He went on to pursue the task which he considered to be his life's work: translation of the Bible into Arabic. Although he died before completing the task, the work was completed by C. V. Van Dyck of the Syrian Mission and published in 1860 to 1865. His wife was Hetty Butler Smith, also a missionary. His daughter Mary Elizabeth Smith, was educated at the Female Seminaries in Hartford, Connecticut and Ipswich, Massachusetts and taught at the Female Seminary at Mt. Auburn, Cincinnati.

  "text" : "Eduardo Afonso Viana (Lisbon, 28 November 1881- Lisbon, 21 February 1967) was a Portuguese painter. He was one of the members of the first modern generation in Portuguese painting, like Amadeo de Souza Cardoso and Almada Negreiros.He was more conservative in his approach to modern painting. The best examples of his assimilation of the modern styles in his work appears in the paintings he did in 1916, due to the influence of both Robert Delaunay and Sonia Delaunay, who he befriended during their presence in Portugal. He latter followed the post-impressionist style inspired by Cézanne in some of his best paintings.He's represented in some of the best Portuguese museums, like Chiado Museum, in Lisbon, and the National Museum Soares dos Reis, in Porto. From 1905 Eduardo Afonso Viana studied in Paris with Jean-Paul Laurens. During this time, he mostly painted natural landscapes. When World War I broke out he returned to Lisbon with his friend Amadeo de Souza Cardoso and other fellow Portuguese. He spent 1915-16 working with the Orphist painters Robert and Sonia Delaunay in Vila do Conde. He was fascinated by their experiments in simultaneity. Viana's painting were a mirror of the life of his country. One of the best examples of this motif is his 1916 painting 'In Revolt', in which he showed Portuguese life through colorful arcs. But Viana was fond of Nature. He had a strong attachment to naturalism. In 1917, he painting 'K4: The Blue Square', considered a homage to Portuguese modernism, was inspired by the book of the same name by Almada Negreiros and was dedicated to Amadeo."

  "text" : "Du Lingyang (杜陵陽) (321–341), formally Empress Chengong (成恭皇后, literally \"the successful and respectful empress\") was an empress of Jin Dynasty (265-420). Her husband was Emperor Cheng of Jin. (Some historians believe that her name was simply Du Ling, and that imperial archivists mistakenly attached the character \"yang\" to her name later. They point out that while the name of a county with the character \"ling\" in its name was changed pursuant to naming taboo, many names of places with \"yang\" in their names were not changed. However, there can be other explanations for this.) Du Lingyang was the daughter of Du Ai (杜乂), a mid-level official and the hereditary Marquess of Dangyang, the grandson of the general Du Yu (杜預), who contributed much to Emperor Wu of Jin's conquest of Eastern Wu. Du Ai died early, and Du Lingyang, who did not have any brothers, was raised by her mother Lady Pei. Du Lingyang was famed for her beauty and virtues, and Emperor Cheng married her as his empress in 336, when both of them were 15. He apparently favored her greatly, but she was sonless. She died in 341, a year before he would die as well."

  "text" : "Erica Wilson (8 October 1928 – 13 December 2011) was an English-born American embroidery designer based in New York, known particularly for needlepoint. She also designed wallcoverings and greeting cards. Her designs were published by Vogue and the Metropolitan Museum of Art, among others. Wilson earned the nicknames \"Julia Child of embroidery\" and \"America's first lady of stitchery\" for her work. Wilson was born in Tidworth, England on October 8, 1928. She moved to Bermuda with her parents as a baby, when her father, a British military colonel, was stationed on the island. She lived in Bermuda for five years, until her parents' divorce. Wilson was raised in England and Scotland after moving from Bermuda, but recalled the move as upsetting. \"I was broken-hearted at leaving the only home I'd ever known.\" She later graduated from the Royal School of Needlework in London. Wilson immigrated to the United States in 1954 to work as a needlework instructor. Some of her early students included Mrs. Procter (of Procter & Gamble) and Mrs. Watson (of IBM Watson family). She married furniture designer Vladimir Kagan in 1957. They have three children. In addition to her design work, Wilson published a syndicated newspaper column, Needleplay; was the host of two Public Television series on embroidery (1970s to 1980s); and wrote 16 books on embroidery. More recently she appeared as a guest on The Carol Duvall Show (HGTV). She also had a shop in New York City (Erica Wilson Needleworks) for 33 years. Also, there is an \"Erica Wilson-Heirloom Guild\"."

  "text" : "Ethelred (Edelret mac Maíl Coluim or Æthelred Margotsson) was the son of King Malcolm III of Scotland (Gaelic Máel Coluim III) and his wife Margaret of Wessex, the third oldest of the latter and the probable sixth oldest of the former. He took his name, almost certainly, from Margaret's great-grandfather Æthelred the Unready. Ethelred had a multicultural upbringing in the pious household of his Gaelic father and Anglo-Hungarian mother. He had an ecclesiastical career and avoided a political career, perhaps because of some disability, being passed over for the succession. His career probably brought him the prestigious abbacy of Dunkeld, however he died as a cluniac monk in Somerset. He is often thought to have held the office Mormaer of Fife, but this is almost certainly a mistake. The source is ultimately Gaelic notitia of a grant to the Céli Dé monks of Loch Leven, later translated into Latin and incorporated in the Register of the Priory of St Andrews, where the grant is headed: Edelradus vir venerandae memoriae filius Malcolmi Regis Scotiae, Abbas de Dunkeldense et insuper Comes de Fyf. Translated, this is \"Edelradus man of venerable memory, son of King Máel Coluim of Scotland, Abbot of Dunkeld and also Mormaer of Fife\". However, the same notitia record a number of witnesses, among whom are the brothers of Ethelred, David and Alexander; after the last two comes Constantinus Comes de Fyf, i.e. Causantín, the actual Mormaer of Fife. The contradiction has been explained by Bannerman. He argues that the translator had been thrown off by the use of a singular Gaelic verb for a joint grant (i.e. where the verb had two subjects), common in Gaelic charters. As a result, the translator omitted the mormaer, Causantín. At any rate, it is clear that Ethelred was never a mormaer of Fife, since Causantín is attested in other sources."

  "text" : "Edward Constant II (born 1942/43) is a former Professor of History at Carnegie Mellon University, and convicted of aggravated assault and attempted homicide. He earned his doctorate from Northwestern University in 1977, and since 1976 had been a member of the Carnegie Mellon history department. He was noted for his publications on the evolution and impact of technology. In 1982 he was awarded the Dexter Prize of the Society for the History of Technology (SHOT) for his book titled, \"The Origins of the Turbojet Revolution\". Constant's main theory was that engineering occurs in 'communities of technological practice'. In 2004 was convicted by an Allegheny County jury trial of attempted homicide and aggravated assault. On May 26, 2002, a police officer came to the Constants' home on a domestic disturbance call after reports of Constant loud argument with his wife inside their home at night. The officer was shot in the chest by a .44 caliber Smith & Wesson revolver, but survived the attack because he was wearing a bullet-proof vest. Constant was arrested after police shot him in the posterior, in a barrage of bullets. Constant's attorney used the defense that the professor and his wife were drunk when he committed the shooting. He was sentenced to 14½ to 29 years in prison. At the time of his sentence, Constant was 61 years old, and described as being in failing health. The first trial was overturned after a juror came forward to report that Judge David Cashman's tipstaff, Mary Feeney, made inappropriate comments that could have swayed the panel. At a hearing before the administrative judge 10 jurors confirmed this and the administrative judge ordered a new trial for Constant in July 2004. He was reconvicted in 2005. The sentence imposed was 14½ to 29 years in prison. In 2013, the conviction was again overturned and a new trial ordered. Constant pleaded guilty again and was sentenced to 11 to 25 years in prison. With credit for time served, he is now eligible for parole."

  "text" : "Ernst or Ernest Raven (1804–1881) was an immigrant from Germany who became a prominent resident of Texas; he served as consul for the German Duchy of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha in the State of Texas during the American Civil War. He was bookbinder to the Duke before moving to Baltimore, Maryland in 1838.  Raven moved to what was then the Republic of Texas in 1844 and settled in Milam County. In 1846 he was one of the signers of a petition to the Governor of Texas for the relocation of trading posts with the Indian tribes. He relocated permanently to Austin, Texas in 1848, where he resumed bookbinding and served as a city alderman. In 1853 Raven was hired for contract work on furniture in the Texas State Senate chamber. Raven was mentioned in Frederick Law Olmsted's 1857 account of his journey through Texas. At the time of Olmsted's visit to Austin, Raven was offering a $100 reward for return of a stolen horse. Back when Texas was an independent republic, Ernst II, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha had appointed Raven to the position of consul for Texas. He continued that role when Texas joined the United States in 1845. He was reappointed to Texas in February 1861, when Texas was again an independent country and before it joined the Confederacy. The Duke never appointed him to the Confederacy itself. Confederate Secretary of State Judah Benjamin reported to the Confederate Congress, on September 22, 1862 that Raven was the only consul to request permission to act from the Richmond Government: \"The one agent who is excepted from these remarks is Ernst Raven esq., who was appointed consul for the State of Texas by his highness the Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, and who applied to this Government for an exequatur on 30 July 1861\" Raven's appointment assigned him to Austin, Texas."

According to Jacob Joshua Ross, \"while the non-Jewish students of Delmedigo may have classified him as an “Averroist”, he clearly saw himself as a follower of Maimonides\". But, according to other scholars, Delmedigo was clearly a strong follower of Averroes' doctrines, even the more radical ones: unity of intellect, eternity of the world, autonomy of reason from the boundaries of revealed religion. Born in Candia, on the island of Crete, (at that time was under the control of the Venetian Republic), whither his family had emigrated from Germany, he spent ten years in Rome and in Padua in northern Italy, returning to Candia at the end of his life. He is remembered for a number of translations, commentaries on Averroes (Ibn Rushd in Arabic) (notably a commentary on Averroes' Substantia Orbis in 1485), for his influence on many Italian Platonists of the early Renaissance (especially Giovanni Pico della Mirandola), and for his treatise on Jewish philosophy, Sefer Beḥinat ha-Dat (The Examination of Religion), published many years after his death, in 1629."

She revolutionized the modern practice of knitting through her books and instructional series on American public television. Though knitting back and forth on rigid straight needles was the norm, she advocated knitting in the round using flexible circular needles to produce seamless garments and to make it easier to knit intricate patterns. She also advocated the Continental knitting method, claiming that it is the most efficient and quickest way to knit. During World War II, German or continental knitting fell out of favor in the UK and US due to its association with Germany. Many English-language books on knitting are in the English or American style. Elizabeth Zimmermann helped to re-introduce continental style knitting to the United States."

According to one obituary he: Was noted for his skill in bringing together writers, directors and stars for generally commercial (though sometimes surprisingly cerebral) films. He excelled in literary adaptations, from popular works such as those of Raymond Chandler and Alistair MacLean to the more esoteric output of such writers as Iris Murdoch, Vladimir Nabokov and Edna O'Brien. He also favoured tales with strong, single-minded heroes and produced films featuring such actors as Marlon Brando, Paul Newman, Jack Nicholson, Robert Mitchum, Burt Reynolds and Richard Burton."

She retired in 1908. Dougherty is buried at Clareville Cemetery, Carterton, New Zealand. Her medal is at the Nurses Chapel at Wellington Hospital. For the centenary of Nursing, it was arranged with Nursing Council in Wellington that her grave be restored, and on the anniversary of 10 January 2002, the grave was rededicated with family, historians and media attending.

  "text" : "Edgar Ravenswood Waite (5 May 1866 – 19 January 1928) was a British/Australian zoologist, ichthyologist, herpetologist, and ornithologist. Waite was born in Leeds, Yorkshire, England, the second son of John Waite, a bank clerk, and his wife Jane, née Vause. Waite was educated at Leeds Parish Church Middle Class School and at the Victoria University of Manchester. In 1888 he was appointed sub-curator of the Leeds Museum and three years later was made curator. On 7 April 1892 Waite married Rose Edith Green at St. Matthew's parish church, Leeds.In 1893 Waite became zoologist at the Australian Museum, Sydney, he was the Fish Curator there from 1893-1906. Waite accompanied Charles Hedley of the Australian Museum on the 1896 Funafuti Coral Reef Boring Expedition of the Royal Society under Professor William Sollas and Professor Edgeworth David. Following the expedition to Funafuti in the Ellice Islands (now known as Tuvalu) Waite published an account of The mammals, reptiles, and fishes of Funafuti. In the scientific discipline of herpetology he described several new species of reptiles. In 1898 Waite published Popular Account of Australian Snakes. He was with the trawling expedition conducted by the H.M.C.S Thetis and wrote the report on the fish, and he also reported on the fish trawled by the Western Australian government. He was involved in several expeditions to sub-Anatarctic islands - including the 1907 Sub-Antarctic Islands Scientific Expedition, New Guinea, and the Australian interior. By the time Waite's employment ended at the Australian Museum, the collection contained 18,000 specimens. He was later the Curator of the Canterbury Museum in New Zealand for eight years, before accepting the Directorship at the South Australian Museum in March 1914. Waite was the first Australian ichthyologist to use detailed illustrations in his papers. During his career, he published around 140 papers, more than half were on fish. His major contribution to Australian ichthyology was The Fishes of South Australia (1923). In 1926 Waite spent time studying European and American museums; while in New York City he arranged the Australian section of a museum there. He had contracted malaria while in New Guinea, and suffered from poor health from that time. Waite died on 19 January 1928 from enteric fever while at Hobart attending a meeting of the Australasian Association for the Advancement of Science. He was survived by a widow and a son. Although of a retiring disposition, Waite was a man of great versatility. He was a linguist and musician, could draw and paint in water-colour, was an expert modeller, had some knowledge of mechanics, and was a capable photographer. Most of these things were useful in his work as curator of a museum, and as such his reputation stood very high. As a scientist his most important work was on the vertebrates. He was a fellow of the Linnean Society from an early age, and at the time of his death was a vice-president of the Royal Society of South Australia. He contributed over 200 papers to various scientific publications."

After Zhang Jun's death in 346, Zhang Chonghua succeeded him and honored her as \"Empress Dowager\" while honoring Princess Yan as \"Grand Empress Dowager.\" After Zhang Chonghua died in 353, his son Zhang Yaoling carried the Jin Dynasty (265-420)-created title Duke of Xiping and was the titular ruler, but actual power was in Empress Dowager Ma's and Zhang Chonghua's older brother Zhang Zuo's hands. Most historians believed that she had an affair with Zhang Zuo, and later that year, she deposed Zhang Yaoling and replaced him with Zhang Zuo. In 355, however, the overly extravagant and cruel Zhang Zuo was deposed and killed by a coalition of officials, including Zhang Guan (張瓘) and Song Hun (宋混), and they pressured her into making Zhang Chonghua's younger son, Zhang Xuanjing, the new ruler. (Zhang Yaoling had been killed by Zhang Zuo earlier that year.) Zhang Guan initially served as regent, but was killed in 359 by Song Hun, who served as regent until his death in 361. He was replaced by his brother Song Cheng (宋澄), who was in turn killed by Zhang Yong (張邕) later that year. It was said that Empress Dowager Ma also carried on an affair with Zhang Yong, who was in turn overthrown by Zhang Jun's youngest son Zhang Tianxi late in the year. In 362, Empress Dowager Ma died."

Descended from the noblest stock of Northumbria, as a young man he led the life of a soldier in the army of King Egfrid, the son of Oswy. When twenty-four years old he gave up the soldier's profession to become a monk in the monastery of Wearmouth, then ruled over by Saint Benedict Biscop. He was ordained priest in the year 679, and in 682 St. Benedict appointed him abbot of Wearmouth as coadjutor to himself. As superior \"when he was compelled to reprove a fault, it was done with such tender sadness that the culprit felt himself incapable of any new offence which should bring a cloud over the benign brightness of that beloved face\". In the year 686 a deadly pestilence overspread the country; it attacked the community at Wearmouth and the youthful abbot was one of its victims. He bade farewell to all, the day before he died, and died on 7 March, when only thirty-six years old. He was subsequently revered as a saint. Saint Benedict was absent in Rome at the time of his death and Sigfried was chosen by the monks as his successor. Eosterwine is not known to have been the author of any works. His feast day is 7 March."

She was also part of the Dutch squad that became World Champion at the 2006 Women's Hockey World Cup. Her father died of cancer a week after the European Championship victory in Ireland. After his death she had difficulties picking up her normal life again, but regained the motivation to start playing when the new season started in October 2005. In 2012, Hoog became the first player to decide a major championship match with a penalty shootout, taking the winning shot in the 2012 Summer Olympics semi-final against New Zealand. She repeated this feat in 2016 when she took the winning shot in the 2016 Summer Olympics semi against  Germany. The Dutch International hockey player is sponsored by Ritual Hockey."

  "text" : "Eftichia Papagianopoulos (Greek: Ευτυχία Παπαγιαννοπούλου), also spelled as Eftihia Papagianopoulou (1893 – 7 January 1972), was a Greek lyricist. She was born in Aydın near Smyrna (now İzmir) in Asia Minor in 1893. She left Smyrna in 1919 prior to the Greco-Turkish War and just three years before the Great Fire of Smyrna and Smyrna's 1922 conquest by the Turks. She emigrated to Greece and settled permanently in Athens. She wrote the lyrics to many popular Greek songs, co-operating with composers like Vassilis Tsitsanis, Apostolos Kaldaras and Manos Hadjidakis; however, she never became very famous among the public until her 1972 death. Her great contribution to Greek music through her exceptional ability in writing lyrics wasn't broadly known and recognized, although many of the successful songs of the 1950s and 1960s had been composed by her. A recent (2002) book written by lyricist and journalist Lefteris Papadopoulos, who was a friend of Eftichia during the last years of her life, helped a lot to increase recognition for her work."

He left Russia in 1918. He received a Doctorate in mathematics from the University of Paris in 1923. His mathematical work was mainly on infinite series, on the theory of orthogonal polynomials, on an algorithm for singular value decomposition which bears his name, on algorithms for the evaluation of elementary functions in computers, and on the enumeration of prime elements of the Gaussian integers. He also invented a three-dimensional version of chess, and was working at his death with Bobby Fischer on a game of chess for three people. When he first came to America (1941) he taught Mathematics at Lehigh University. In the early 1950s he was a consultant for IBM in New York City and taught at Columbia University.

  "text" : "Eli Lackland Beeding Jr. (December 17, 1928 - December 21, 2013) was a U.S. Air Force captain and rocket test subject. In 1958, a series experiments using a miniature rocket sled began at Holloman AFB under the supervision of Colonel John Stapp and Captain Beeding. Participants rode the \"Daisy Sled\" (so-called because it was originally designed to be air, and not rocket, powered) at various speeds and in many different positions — even head first — in an attempt to learn more about the g-force limits of the human body. On May 16, Capt. Eli Beeding prepared to make a 40 g run. The Daisy shot down the track, reached a top speed around 35 mph, and came to a screeching halt in less than a tenth of a second.\"When I hit the water brake,\" Beeding recalled in a recent interview, \"It felt like Ted Williams had hit me on the back, about lumbar five, with a baseball bat.\" Beeding had barely informed flight surgeon Capt. Les Eason of his troubles when he began to experience tunnel vision and passed out. It was a scary moment, since the standard protocol for shock would be to elevate Beeding’s feet. Yet there was a chance his back was broken, in which case he shouldn’t be touched. Taking a calculated risk, Eason and Tech. Sgt. Roy Gatewood gently moved Beeding onto the side of the sled and elevated his feet. Ten minutes later, Beeding emerged from shock and was rushed to the base hospital. Doctors determined his back was only badly bruised. \"I thought that was the big excitement of the day,” Beeding recalls. \"But later my boss came to me and said, ‘The chest accelerometer tracing shows you got 82.6 g!’\" Subsequent tests with bears showed that the reading was not a fluke, and that Beeding had indeed endured a massive g load. When word got out, the young captain made headlines as the man who had topped John Stapp's g-force record. Beeding however is quick to point out that he rode the sled backwards, and that his time at 83 gs was “infinitesimal” compared to the 1.1 second durations Stapp faced during his own tests. “That doesn’t sound like much (time),” Beeding notes, “But I guarantee you, having been through it at lesser durations, one second is an eternity.” Still, the incident was wholly remarkable and made Beeding a hero and, for several decades thereafter, his name appeared in the Guinness Book of World Records. Guinness and many other sources incorrectly reported that Beeding endured 82.6 gs for 0.04 seconds. Beeding's sled in fact deccelerated at 40.4 gs for 0.04 seconds as it slowed from 35 mph to a stop over a distance of one foot. 82.6 gs was a brief peak acceleration measured by a sensor on his chest due to elastic response of his rib cage. Beeding retired from the Air Force in 1971, later moving to Colorado where he died in 2013 at the age of 85."

She has gone on to become one of the UK's biggest selling classical artists, having sold over half a million discs sold worldwide. Emma Johnson has released several CDs, of clarinet concertos and recital music, covering both standard classical repertoire and occasionally lighter tracks, including some jazz. She plays a Peter Eaton clarinet. Emma has given concerts throughout Europe, as well as in America, Japan, Taiwan, Korea, Africa and Australia, and has had works dedicated to her by Sir John Dankworth, Will Todd, Patrick Hawes, Michael Berkeley, Matthew Taylor and Robin Holloway. The soundtrack to the BBC television series The Victorian Kitchen Garden, a suite made up of five short movements for clarinet and harp, was dedicated to Ms Johnson by the composer, Paul Reade. Johnson is now a governor at the school she used to attend, Sevenoaks School. In 2016, Emma Johnson has become the first female alumnus to have a portrait unveiled at Pembroke College, Cambridge.

  "text" : "Mr. Willem Frederik Ewald Marggraff (9 June 1923, Vught – 7 December 2003, Vught) was a controversial wealthy son of a famous family of Dutch nobility. Ewald Marggraff was the son of Mr. Dr. Lodewijk Marggraff and Catharina Schran. He studied law in Utrecht and international private law in Paris. On 7 December 2003 his house Zionsburg was destroyed by fire, while Marggraff was in the house. He was buried in the gardens of Zionsburg. In March 2006, the investigation of the accident and Marggraff's death was reopened, as there are reasons to believe the fire was not an accident, but arson. With more than 500 estates (on a surface area of about 7 km² in total) Marggraff was probably one of the richest men of Noord-Brabant, one of the Dutch provinces. His fortune was estimated in 1998 at 18 million euros (excluding his fortune outside the Netherlands). Marggraff's land is now owned by the Marggraff Stichting (a non-profit organization) and is open for the public (except for Zionsburg). In November 2007, both Marggraff and Zionsburg became the main subjects of a non-fiction book, The Secret of Zionsburg (Het geheim van Zionsburg). In it the authors, Joris van Os and Jurriaan Maessen, speculate liberally on the backgrounds of the estate and its potential role in Dutch history. One of the more notable connections offered in the book is the one between Zionsburg and medieval Grail lore. The presence of Teutonic Knights on the estate leads the authors to the hypothesis of Zionsburg being a potential resting place for a Crusader treasure, possibly the Holy Grail."

  "text" : "Elisabeta Rizea (28 June 1912 – 6 October 2003) was a Romanian anti-communist partisan in the Făgăraş Mountains of Northern Wallachia. After the Romanian Revolution, she became the symbol of Romania's anti-communist resistance. Rizea was born in Nucșoara, a small village in Argeş County in the Southern Carpathians, to a family of peasants who lived off plot of cultivated land. After World War II, as the Soviet Army imposed a Communist government in Romania, the peasants had to give up their land in order to implement collective farming. Out of opposition to this, Elisabeta Rizea and her husband joined an anti-Communist guerrilla group, Haiducii Muscelului, led by Colonel Gheorghe Arsenescu. Her assigned task within the group was to provide food and supplies. After she was captured by the Romanian militia in 1952, she was declared \"duşman al poporului\" (enemy of the people) and sentenced to death because she refused to give information about the other partisans. Eventually her sentence was commuted to seven years in prison. When Arsenescu was arrested in 1961, her sentence was extended by another 25 years, but three years later, in 1964, she was freed under the terms of a general amnesty. During her twelve years spent in prison, she was subjected to various forms of torture: she was hung by her hair from a hook and beaten until she fainted due to broken ribs, and was also scalped, burned, and beaten with a shovel. Upon her release from prison, she had no hair and she couldn't walk, as her knees had been destroyed by the torture. Her story became known after an interview included in the 1992 documentary Memorialul durerii by Lucia Hossu-Longin. In a 2006 poll conducted by Romanian Television to identify the \"greatest Romanians of all time\", she came in 58th."

  "text" : "Ely Moore (July 4, 1798 – January 27, 1860) was a Jacksonian U.S. Representative from New York (1835–1839). Moore was born near Belvidere, New Jersey. He attended public schools, and then moved to New York and studied medicine. He became a printer and an editor of a New York City labor paper. In 1836, Moore performed one of his last speeches. It was a stunning defense of Workers, Unions, and the Free Labor System. His stunning oration was in reply to an insulting speech by Waddy Thompson, Jr. of South Carolina that called northern laborers \"thieves who would raise wages through insurrection or by the equally terrible process of the ballot-box.\" Moore's speech contained stirring aggravation at the unjust moneyed aristocracy, Nicholas Biddle (second US Bank), and the lack of equality of the wage earning worker. During his most heated rhetoric he collapsed onto the podium. Moore headed and established the General Trades Union of New York. The GTU was the first Union containing multiple trades. In 1834 Ely Moore became President of the National Trade Union. The NTU spanned from Boston to St. Louis. The NTU helped to establish the 10 hour work day in many states. New York had already established the 10 hour work day. His first interest in national politics was to endorse Richard Mentor Johnson, on March 13, 1833, for Vice President, because he opposed the Sabbatarian Movement (contrary to the freedom of religion), and supported replacing imprisonment for debt with a bankruptcy law. He was a Tammany Hall candidate for Congress in 1834 and 1836; in the latter year, he was also supported by the Locofocos, like Churchill C. Cambreleng, the other Tammany candidate to be successful. He was defeated in 1838: his district, which returned four Congressmen, went largely Whig, but President Martin Van Buren appointed him Collector of the Port of New York, and he supported Van Buren for re-election in 1840, although he lost to William Henry Harrison. Moore was one of the radical leaders to support the Dorr Rebellion in Rhode Island in 1842. He was one of the radicals who criticized the early abolitionists in the interest of labor, seeing a Whig plot to introduce the Negro as cheap competition in the labor market, and keep wages low. Moore was appointed by President James K. Polk United States marshal for the southern district of New York in 1845. He became owner and editor of the Warren Journal of his hometown, Belvidere, New Jersey. He was appointed agent for the Miami and other tribes of Indians in Kansas in 1853. He was appointed register of the United States land office in Lecompton, Kansas, in 1855 and served until 1860. He died in Lecompton, Douglas County, Kansas, on January 27, 1860 at the age of 61 and is interred on his farm near Lecompton."

  "text" : "Edgar Ewing Brandon (August 9, 1865 – June 8, 1957) was a professor of French and college administrator who served twice as acting president of Miami University (1909–10 and 1927–28) and was an expert on the Marquis de Lafayette. Born in York Springs, Pennsylvania, Brandon earned an A.B. degree from the University of Michigan, a A.M. degree from the University of Missouri in 1897 and a Docteur d'Universite degree from the University of Paris in 1904. Dr. Brandon was appointed professor of Romance Languages at Miami University and held that position until his retirement in 1931. He served as vice president of Miami University from 1908 to 1931, Dean from 1912 to 1931 and was twice acting president. In 1906, he became the first faculty advisor to the organization that would become Phi Kappa Tau Fraternity and later served two terms as national president of the fraternity. For his guidance in the development of the fraternity, he is known as the \"Architect of Phi Kappa Tau.\" The fraternity gives the Edgar Ewing Brandon Award to outstanding faculty advisors in the fraternity each year. During World War I, he served in France as director of the Foyer du Soldat (French YMCA). In his retirement, he wrote two books on the Marquis de Lafayette chronicling his travels through the United States. He died in Hamilton, Ohio and is buried in the Oxford (Ohio) Cemetery. Brandon Hall, a dormitory on the Miami University campus is named for Dr. Brandon."

  "text" : "Edward Alexander Pilgrim (12 December 1904 – 24 September 1954) was a British homeowner whose suicide was hastened by bureaucracy. He was a working class individual with a slight education who worked as a milkman before marrying his wife, Margaret, in 1931. In 1949, he moved to Marlborough Road in Romford and worked as a tool maker for ten pound sterling a week. He took out a ten-year mortgage on his house to purchase a 2,200 square metre lot next to his house to use as a buffer zone between himself and neighboring children, paying £400 for the lot. What Pilgrim did not know was that the Town and Country Planning Act 1947 had allowed local councils to purchase lands for development for current usage values. Thus, fallow land (and specifically empty lots such as his buffer) would be purchased for its potential value in agriculture rather than its value as housing or commercial space. Owners of empty land could lodge a claim to request compensation for lost development rights, but only if they did so before July 1949. The previous owner of Mr. Pilgrim's lot had not lodged such a claim and had sold to avoid having to take what the council would offer. Indeed, when Romford council began its Mawney Road housing development in July 1952, they offered Pilgrim only £65 for the lot – a value that was confirmed by the assayer. Pilgrim, however, did not even know of the offer (and purchase) by the government until the project began, and he did not appeal until February 1954, when construction on the site actually began. The Romford council had a housing waiting list of 1,600 people, and so it would not remove Mr. Pilgrim's lot from its scheme. They determined that he was merely an imprudent land speculator who had not bothered to inform himself of the legal issues surrounding his purchase. Pilgrim tried to reach the Housing Minister Harold Macmillan, the prime minister Winston Churchill, and the Queen. Macmillan's civil servants agreed with the local council that Pilgrim was simply a man who had not done due preparation. A Unity housing high rise went up on Pilgrim's lot, until, according to Pilgrim, it blotted out the sun and he needed electric lights even on sunny days. The lot that he had purchased to ensure a natural buffer was now, in fact, destroying both his view and his quiet. On 24 September 1954, after a weekend of depression, he hanged himself in a tool shed on the disputed land. The Daily Express newspaper made Pilgrim's suicide a cause célèbre and campaigned to have it remembered. The Crichel Down scandal was also in the news at the time, and Winston Churchill accused Harold Macmillan of killing Pilgrim. A revision of the Town and Country Planning Act in 1954 included a \"Pilgrim clause\" which allowed future land owners in Pilgrim's place to be compensated. The local council in Romford offered Mrs. Pilgrim £335 (to be added to the £65 already paid to equal the original purchase price), but this left her still paying interest on the loan. The story of Edward Pilgrim has become an archetype for the well-intentioned abuses of bureaucracy, especially in the United Kingdom. The figure of Arthur Dent in Douglas Adams's The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, for example, repeats numerous details of the Pilgrim story. The character of Harry Buttle/Harry Tuttle in the Terry Gilliam film Brazil also suggests some of the same disquiet with self-satisfied bureaucracy that Pilgrim experienced."

  "text" : "Empress Qiang (強皇后, personal name unknown) (died 356), formally Empress Mingde (明德皇后, literally \"the understanding and virtuous empress\"), was an empress of the Chinese/Di state Former Qin. Her husband was Former Qin's founding emperor, Fu Jiàn (Emperor Jingming). She appeared to be Fu Jiàn's wife during the time that he was heir apparent to his father Fu Hong (苻洪), a major general and Di chieftain during Later Zhao. When Fu Jiàn declared himself the \"Heavenly Prince\" (Tian Wang) in 351 during the middle of Later Zhao's collapse, he created her \"Heavenly Princess\" (Tian Wanghou, 天王后). In 352, when he declared himself emperor, he created her empress. She had at least three sons—Fu Chang (苻萇), Fu Sheng, and Fu Liu (苻柳). Fu Chang, as the oldest, was created the crown prince in 351. Her brother Qiang Ping (強平) became a key advisor to Fu Jiàn. In 354, Crown Prince Chang suffered an arrow wound while commanding an army resisting a major attack by the Jin general Huan Wen, and he died later that year from the wound. Empress Qiang wanted her youngest son, Fu Liu the Prince of Jin, to be crown prince. However, Fu Jiàn, believing in mysterious prophecies that appeared to indicate their violent son Fu Sheng the Prince of Huai'nan should be the next emperor, created Fu Sheng crown prince. After Fu Jiàn died in 355, Fu Sheng succeeded him, and he honored her as empress dowager. Fu Sheng's reign was a violent and capricious one, as he killed many high-level officials with little reason. In summer 356, there were rumors that bandits were about to attack the capital Chang'an, which resulted in a great panic in the capital lasting five days. Fu Sheng investigated the rumors and ordered that all persons who spread the rumors be executed by having their chests cut open and hearts pulled out. Qiang Ping, as his uncle, tried to persuade him not to carry out such cruel punishment, and Fu Sheng became angry at him, first fracturing his skull with a hammer and then executing him, despite intercessions from three generals he trusted. A month later, Empress Dowager Qiang died in sadness and fear."

  "text" : "Ernest Greenfield was a British archaeologist. He served with the Royal Air Force during the Second World War. During war service he became friends with Philip Rahtz who persuaded Greenfield to take up professional archaeology. His excavations included the Great Witcombe Roman Villa, Gloucestershire (1960–1973), and Chew Valley Lake, north Somerset (1953). Greenfield grew up in Sidcup, Kent and was a schoolboy when he set out to single-handedly excavate a Roman site at Horwood's Pit, St. Pauls Cray, whilst gravel extraction operations were being carried out in the 1930s. He was not popular with the gravel company, and subsequently contacted A.H.A. Hogg for help in the investigations. Hogg later drew up a plan of the site, and sought further help for Greenfield from Norman Cook at Maidstone Museum. In a letter to Cook, preserved at the museum, Hogg stated that Greenfield 'had the right ideas, but was discouraged 'after having lost his finds and site notes off the back of his motorbike!' Later Greenfield set up a local archaeological group which discovered many new sites including the famous Lullingstone Villa."

His part in the rescue of 19 Norwegian refugees was recorded in The Last Voyage of the SS Henry Bacon. This was later recognized by several governments, including Russia and Norway. Campbell went on to become Vice President, Engineering and Technical Services, of Radio Free Europe. In Waves Astern, his autobiography, he recalls eight decades of adventures to exotic and sometimes isolated destinations while serving his country. Campbell recalls the February night in a lifeboat in the Arctic filled with terrified refugees, his efforts to send SOS signals in gale-force winds, and of their miraculous rescue. Decades later, he and the survivors were reunited when he was honored by the Norwegian government. Campbell's odyssey includes Cold War episodes in Eniwetok and Thule, Greenland and a 20-year career with Radio Free Europe."

Phaedo's presentation of the story comprises most of the dialogue's remainder, though Echecrates interrupts at times to ask questions relevant to the retold discussion. Little is known about Echecrates other than what Plato reveals, as he is mentioned in very few works. His status as a Pythagorean, also mentioned by Diogenes Laërtius, and his general concern and respect for Socrates are all that can be discerned of his philosophical beliefs. An Echecrates is mentioned by Aristoxenus as a student of Philolaus and Eurytus. (p. 166)"

Serialized between 1917 and 1919 in the 27th (NY) Division's magazine \"Gas Attack\", they were inspired by Streeter's time spent on an army base (Camp Wadsworth, near Spartansburg SC) during World War I. The humorous letters were compiled in 1919 in Streeter's full-length books Dere Mable and Thats me all over, Mable. After returning home from the war, Streeter pursued writing casually, deciding to focus on his work as a businessman. For eight years he served as assistant vice president, before transitioning to the Fifth Avenue Bank in New York City, (later, The Bank of New York) where he served as vice president for twenty-five years. While serving as VP of the bank, Streeter published short stories and articles in magazines such as the Saturday Evening Post and McCall's. In 1938, he published his first novel, Daily Except Sundays. In 1944 he was elected to The Century Association, and remained a member for 32 years. He waited another five years, however, before publishing his next novel. Published in 1949, the comic satire Father of the Bride became an instant bestseller and was listed among The New York Times list of bestselling novels for the year. The following year, it was adapted into a successful film starring Spencer Tracy and Elizabeth Taylor. After his breakthrough success, Streeter continued to write successful novels. Of the most notable of his subsequent works are Mr. Hobbs' Vacation (1954, filmed in 1962), Merry Christmas, Mr. Baxter (1956), Mr. Robbins Rides Again (1958), and Chairman of the Bored (1961). He finished his writing career with 1969's grim semi-autobiographical Ham Martin, Class of '17. In all of his novels, Streeter showed remarkable perception into human nature, and a wonderfully erudite dry wit. If there is a basic theme to his main characters, it is that they are usually men who feel put-upon, but eventually realize that they are taking themselves much too seriously (Father of the Bride, Merry Christmas Mr. Baxter, and Mr. Hobbs' Vacation are typical examples.) Streeter died on March 31, 1976."

Very little is known about Empress Gou. She might have been a relative of Fu Jiān's mother Empress Dowager Gou, but there is not enough evidence. She was still alive in 359, when she participated in a ceremonial feeding of silkworms, but there was no further record of her in history, including whether she survived to her husband's death in 385. (The succession table below assumes that she did survive to 385, although that is highly speculative, although when Fu Jiān's crown prince Fu Hong fled to Jin in 385, he was recorded to have done so with his mother, who was likely to be Empress Gou.)"

He was best known as the weatherman in the ABS-CBN news program TV Patrol. He was also known as The Walking Encyclopedia. Considered as one of the pioneers of Radyo Patrol, which counts as contemporaries, among others, Rey Langit, Noli de Castro, Joe Taruc, Mario Garcia, Bobby Guanzon, Orly Mercado and Bong Lapira, Baron, Ka Ernie to his legions of followers, started his radio career with the general information program, Gintong Kaalaman, on the old DZAQ, the forerunner of what is now DZMM Radyo Patrol 630. When ABS-CBN returned on the air after the Marcos regime, he hosted the radio program Knowledge Power as well as its spin-off show on television of the same title. He also advocated the use of herbal medicine called pito pito and cleansing diet in his programs and media appearances, which irked medical professionals and then dismissed him as promoter of quack medicine. Baron appears his first movie Pera o Bayong (based on the game segment from Magandang Tanghali Bayan). Baron was also a proponent of scientific and technological advances in the Philippines. To attest to this, he was the inventor of the so-called Baron Super Antenna, a sophisticated yet reasonably-priced outdoor TV antenna. He died of myocardial infarction on the morning of 23 January 2006 in Muntinlupa at the age of 65. Broadcaster Mel Tiangco announced his passing at the end of the said date's episode of 24 Oras. He is survived by his wife Josephine B. Baron and their daughter, Shirley Baron."

  "text" : "Ellsworth Clewer \"Sonny\" Wisecarver Jr. (15 June 1929 – 22 November 2005), called the Woo Woo Kid, became infamous in 1944 for having affairs with older women. His behavior sparked public scandal, primarily because of his age; at age 14 he ran off with a mother of two, only to do so again a year later. It was the latter incident that sparked his notoriety; Eleanor Deveny, the woman he fled with the second time, was arrested and charged with contributing to the delinquency of a minor. As for Sonny, his parents had him declared an incorrigible delinquent. He spent time in the California Youth Authority, a state penal facility for juveniles. In his book The Rape of the A*P*E*, Allan Sherman credits the Wisecarver scandal and resulting publicity as the official start of the American sexual revolution. Wisecarver's scandalous affairs were the basis for the 1987 film, In the Mood, in which Wisecarver makes a cameo appearance as a mailman. Patrick Dempsey played the role of Wisecarver. An interview with Wisecarver also appears on the original VHS of the movie. Wisecarver spent his final days in a mobile home in Yucaipa, California, in the United States. He died of lung cancer at the age of 76, at a Veterans hospital in Loma Linda, California. An Air Force veteran of the Korean War, Wisecarver is buried in Riverside National Cemetery in Riverside, California."

  "text" : "Edir Macedo Bezerra (born February 18, 1945) is a Brazilian evangelical leader and media mogul; he is the owner and chairman of the second-largest television network in Brazil, Rede Record, since 1989 with its parent Central Record de Comunicação who also founded after he bought the network. Macedo was raised Catholic, but by 1970 converted to a Pentecostal. He founded with others the Pentecostal Universal Church of the Kingdom of God in Rio de Janeiro state, Brazil in 1977. He is referred to with sneer quotes as \"Bishop\" Edir Macedo by Forbes. His rapidly growing religious movement and his teaching of prosperity theology have been a source of controversy. His sermons partly focus on freeing his followers from unclean spirits that oppress them, which manifest in them, and are cast out in the name of Jesus, in order for them to overcome their problems. His views about other faiths, particularly Catholicism, are also controversial. In 1992 he spent eleven days in jail on accusations of charlatanism. There were several protests, with his religious followers camping in front of the police precinct he was held in, according to his autobiography \"Nothing to Lose\". His Prosperity theology is used by church leaders to justify his lifestyle, \"If I preach prosperity and my clothes are ragged, who will follow me? According to Forbes and Business Week he is continuously involved in scandals, mostly due to allegations that the UCKG illegally channeled donations of billions of US dollars intended for charity overseas, then returned the money to Brazil. The São Paulo Public Ministry said in a statement \"it was proved that the money from donations, instead of being used for the maintenance of services, was diverted to serve the private interests of the accused\". Macedo is accused of using the donations received from his poor followers to buy jewelry, TV stations, and other businesses for himself. The São Paulo state prosecutor said that Macedo and his associates had misappropriated more than US$2 billion in donations from 2003 to 2008 alone, and that the alleged scheme went back 10 years. There have also been unofficial charges of fraud and money laundering. As of January 2013 Macedo was still under prosecution by US and Venezuelan authorities. In 2007 Macedo was also criticized by the acquisitions of his church which include, twenty-three TV stations, forty radio stations, two major daily newspapers, a real state agency, a health insurance company, and an airline. The church's acquisitions seems very suspicious due to the church's short history of about thirty years. Despite the pretty accurate investigation, none of these accusations has been actually proved. In March 2013 Macedo was on the Forbes billionaires list with a reported US$1.1 billion. That makes him by far the richest pastor in Brazil and the world."

In addition to his preaching, Pirkle was known for creating and starring in his own Christian films as well as writing numerous books. His films were directed by Ron Ormond and produced by the Ormond Organization of Nashville, Tennessee. The Burning Hell is a 1974 film created by Pirkle as his interpretation of what the Bible has to say about hell. It is available in Spanish, Portuguese, Malayalam, Tamil and English. The screenplay is by Ron Ormond. The companion movie The Believer's Heaven gives Pirkle's interpretation of what the Bible has to say about heaven. Pirkle's preaching was sampled by Negativland for the song\"Christianity Is Stupid\"."

  "text" : "Eric Leslie Gandar Dower (1894 – 4 October 1987) was a Scottish Unionist Party politician and businessman. He was educated at Brighton College, like his elder brother Leonard, and at Jesus College, Cambridge, and trained for the stage at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, touring with a number of theatre companies. Gandar Dower established Aberdeen Airport and pioneered Scottish Air Lines between Aberdeen and Edinburgh, Glasgow, Wick, Thurso, Kirkwall, and Stromness, as well as the first British/Norwegian Air Line between Newcastle and Stavanger in 1937. He served as a Flight Lieutenant in the Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve from 1940 to 1943. Following the War, he was elected as Conservative Member of Parliament for Caithness and Sutherland at the 1945 general election with a majority of just 6 in the tightest ever three-way marginal: just 61 votes separated him from the third-placed candidate, Liberal Party parliamentary leader Archibald Sinclair. Sinclair had acted as Secretary of State for Air during World War II and could not spend much time in his constituency, Britain's northernmost mainland seat. Gandar Dower had based his 1945 election platform on serving as a wartime MP until the end of the conflict with Japan. His election address stated, \"If I am returned I shall resign when Japan is beaten and stand again at the by-election which will follow, so that you can decide whether you wish me to continue as your representative in peace\" and followed this up with an eve-of-poll \"special message\" stating, \"Note - Gandar Dower, if elected, has pledged himself to resign at the end of the Japanese war and to stand again at the resultant by-election.\" In his victory speech at the declaration, he said, \"Don't regard me as a Unionist. I am a member of the National Party until the end of the Japanese war, when you will then have a chance again to put me in or out.\" After the war ended on 14 August 1945, Gandar Dower did not resign, but pledged to do so \"later\". On 14 February 1946, Gandar Dower announced that he would shortly be resigning his seat but later withdrew the resignation. On 28 December 1946, Gandar Dower offered to resign in the New Year, citing the marriage of his Private Secretary as a reason, but he withdrew this resignation on 11 February, citing the \"rumours and cross-rumours\" in the press which had been caused by his announcement, and how they \"have been damaging to the Unionist cause.\" On 30 June 1947, The Times reported, \"With the forthcoming fusion of the Caithness and Sutherland Conservative Associations it is certain that there will be no by-election in this constituency. Backed by the unanimous support of both associations, Mr. E.L. Gandar Dower, the Conservative MP for Caithness and Sutherland, will hold his seat probably until the next General Election.\" At a 15 September 1948 meeting of his local Conservative Association, he attempted to bring matters to a head by calling on the association to renominate him as the Conservative candidate for a by-election that he now intended to trigger. He was overwhelmingly defeated, with only 8 members voting for him to follow through with this course of action and numerous members expressing their dissatisfaction. In response to this, he declared that he would be standing at the next general election as an Independent, and from 3 October 1948, he withdrew from the Conservative whip. On 12 December 1948, the Caithness and Sutherland Conservatives selected David Robertson to replace Gandar Dower. In the event, Gandar Dower decided not to seek re-election at all, and he retired at the 1950 general election. Gandar Dower's brother, Alan, also served as a Conservative member of parliament, while another, Kenneth, was a leading explorer and navigator. All used different versions of their surname: Gandar Dower, Dower and Gandar-Dower respectively."

  "text" : "Elkan Nathan Adler (24 July 1861, St Luke's, London – 15 September 1946, London) was an English author, lawyer, historian, and collector of Jewish books and manuscripts. Adler's father was Nathan Marcus Adler, Chief Rabbi of the British Empire. He traveled extensively and built an enormous library, particularly of old Jewish documents. Adler was among the first to explore the documents stored in the Cairo Genizah, being in fact the first European to enter it. During his visits to Cairo in 1888 and 1895 Adler collected and brought over 25,000 Genizah manuscript fragments back to England. Adler was particularly interested in the history of Persian (Iranian) Jews. He traveled to Tehran and Bukhara in 1896 and 1897, where he purchased various Hebrew and Judeo-Persian manuscripts and later published descriptive lists of their contents. These publications provided Western scholars with critical insight into the cultural, literary, and intellectual endeavors pursued by the Jews of Iran. The manuscripts collected by Adler include both religious and secular works on various topics, including stories, folklore, calendars, biblical and Talmudic dictionaries, prayer books, liturgical hymns, discourses on Kabbalah (Jewish mysticism), and chronicles of religious persecution. In his 1921 summary, Catalogue of Hebrew Manuscripts in the Collection of E. N. Adler, Adler described over 4,500 manuscripts in his collection. Overall, Adler collected some 30,000 printed books in Judaica. Unfortunately for him, a business associate's embezzlement forced him to sell most of his library to the Jewish Theological Seminary of America in New York City and Hebrew Union College in Cincinnati in 1923. Moreover, Adler agreed to bequeath his subsequent acquisitions to the Jewish Theological Seminary upon his death. During a visit to Egypt in 1924, Adler acquired a recently discovered jar that contained the private archive of an Egyptian mercenary, Horos son of Nechoutes (c. 145-88 BC), and he personally contributed to the edition of the documents which were published as The Adler Papyri. Adler published many books about his travels and on his extensive collections, including About Hebrew Manuscripts (1905), A Gazetteer of Hebrew Printing (1917); Jews in Many Lands (1905); Auto de Fe and Jew (1908); History of the Jews of London (1930); Jewish Travellers (1930, repr. 1966); and articles on the Samaritans and on the History of the Jews in Egypt and Persia. Adler was extremely active in English-Jewish communal affairs, especially in education, and was an ardent Zionist; he was an early member of the Hovevei Zion in England. Per his will, his personal archives are now at the library of the Jewish Theological Seminary of America."

Growing up Jewish in an Appalachian environment where the Ku Klux Klan was influential and \"Jews, Catholics, and the very few blacks on the outskirts of town ... served as ritualistic enemies\" helped shape him. He attended City College of New York from 1932 to 1935, then met Esther Shapiro, an editorial assistant, while he was working for the Brooklyn Daily Eagle; they were married in 1941, shortly before the U.S. entered World War II. During the war, Bendiner served as a B-17 Flying Fortress navigator, receiving the Distinguished Flying Cross, the Air Medal with three oak leaf clusters, and the Purple Heart. After the war, he worked for Esquire, then for a series of medical publications, and wrote a number of books. Among his better-known works are The Rise and Fall of Paradise (a history of al-Andalus), A Time for Angels: A Tragicomic History of the League of Nations, The Bowery Man, The Virgin Diplomats, Biographical Dictionary of Medicine (cowritten with his daughter Jessica), and The Fall of Fortresses."

Mr Wedge obtained a 2,000 acre (8 km²) grant, which he called Forton, but at first he tried to establish the saw mill at Oyster Cove, just south of Hobart Town. The mill was not a success financially, and was eventually abandoned at a loss of £2,000. He then turned to agricultural pursuits, and established Forton with the assistance of convict labour. After the settlement of Port Phillip in 1835, he and his bother John established a squatters run at Werribee, near Melbourne, and in the 1840s Davy and his wife left Forton for the Werribee run. In May 1852 the Werribee River flooded and the Wedge house was engulfed. The family was forced onto the roof, which collapsed during the night, and the family was washed away. Davy and his wife Lucy both died, as did their eldest daughter, Lucy. Davy, his wife and daughter Lucy were all buried at the Williamstown cemetery."

  "text" : "Edwin James George Pitman (29 October 1897 – 21 July 1993) was an Australian mathematician who made significant contributions to statistics and probability theory. In particular, he is remembered primarily as the originator of the Pitman permutation test, Pitman nearness and Pitman efficiency. Pitman was born in Melbourne on 29 October 1897, and attended University of Melbourne, residing at Ormond College, where he graduated with First Class Honours. In 1926 he was appointed Professor of Mathematics at the University of Tasmania, which he held until his retirement in 1962. He was a founding member and second President of the Australian Mathematical Society. He was also active within the Statistical Society of Australia, which in 1978 named the Pitman medal in his honour. His work the Pitman measure of closeness or Pitman nearness concerning the exponential families of probability distributions has been studied extensively since the 1980s by C. R. Rao, Pranab K. Sen, and others. The Pitman–Koopman–Darmois theorem states that only exponential families of probability distributions admit a sufficient statistic whose dimension remains bounded as the sample size grows."

He was the son of William Scrope Ayrton, 1849-1904 (a British consular official in China) and his wife Ellen Louisa McClatchie, and was born in Wuhu, China, on 17 December 1882 (coincidentally, the same year as the formation of the Egypt Exploration Fund). He was educated at St Paul's School, in London. He began his career in Egyptology at the age of 20, assisting the pioneer of systematic methodology in archaeology William Matthew Flinders Petrie. He joined Petrie on the Egypt Exploration Fund excavations at Abydos (which began in 1899) from 1902 to 1904. Ayrton's first independent work was the excavation of the Second Dynasty site of Shunet ez Zebib (at Abydos). Later, he worked near Ghurab with William Leonard Stevenson Loat. In 1904-05 he excavated and recorded graves of several ancient princesses found in the funerary temple complex of king Mentuhotep II at Deir al-Bahari, as part of the expedition led by Édouard Naville and Henry Hall. Working for Theodore M. Davis in Egypt's Valley of the Kings from 1905 to 1908, he discovered the following tombs: \n*  KV47 (of the pharaoh Siptah, in 1905) \n*  KV55 (Amarna Period, interment problematic, in 1907) \n*  KV56 (of a royal child, in 1908) and  \n*  KV57 (of the pharaoh Horemheb, in 1908). He also led or participated in the excavation of the following tombs: \n*  KV2, KV10, KV46, KV47, KV48, KV49, KV50, KV51, KV52, KV53, KV54, KV56, KV57, KV59, and KV60. Again working with Loat, in 1908-09 he excavated amongst the Sixth Dynasty tombs at Abydos and also the Predynastic cemetery at El Mahasna. In 1911 he accepted a position with the Archaeological Survey of Ceylon. On the 18 May 1914 he drowned while on a shooting expedition, in an accident on the Tissa Tank lake, Tissamaharama, in southern Ceylon (now Sri Lanka). The Times Newspaper printed his obituary on the 23 May 1914; and his Probate Administration is during 1915. The Estate of £457 18s 1d is left to Florence Margaret Ayrton, Spinster."

  "text" : "Edward Alexander Bouchet (September 15, 1852 – October 28, 1918) was an African American physicist and educator and was the first African-American to earn a Ph.D. from any American university, completing his dissertation in physics at Yale in 1876. On the basis of his academic record he was elected to the Phi Beta Kappa Society. In 1874, he had become one of the first African Americans to graduate from Yale College. Although Bouchet was elected to Phi Beta Kappa along with other members of the Yale class of 1874, the official induction did not take place until 1884, when the Yale chapter was reorganized after thirteen years of inactivity. Because of the circumstances, Bouchet was not the first African American elected to Phi Beta Kappa as many historical accounts state; that honor belongs to George Washington Henderson (University of Vermont).Bouchet was also among the first 20 Americans (of any race) to receive a Ph.D. in physics and was the sixth to earn a Ph. D. in Physics from Yale."

  "text" : "Emraan Anwar Hashmi (pronounced [ɪmraːn ˈɦaːʃmiː]; born 24 March 1979) is an Indian film actor who appears in Hindi language films. Through his successful career, Hashmi has received three Filmfare Award nominations and has established himself as one of the most popular and highest-paid actor of Hindi cinema. Hashmi, member of the Bhatt family was born and raised in Mumbai. After graduating from the University of Mumbai, he worked as an assistant director for the 2002 horror film Raaz before pursuing a career in acting. The following year, he made his acting debut with a leading role in the crime thriller Footpath, a moderate box-office success. By 2004, Hashmi had established him as one of the leading actor of Hindi cinema with roles in the successful Murder (2004), Zeher (2005) and Gangster (2006). However, he followed it by starring in a series of films that under-performed at the box office, although his performance in the romantic drama Awarapan (2007) was praised. The year 2008 marked a turning point for Hashmi when he played conman in the crime drama Jannat. He subsequently received wide critical recognition for portraying unconventional characters in several commercially successful films, including the horror Raaz: The Mystery Continues (2009), the biographical drama The Dirty Picture (2011), the psychological thriller Murder 2 (2011), the romantic comedy Dil Toh Baccha Hai Ji (2011), the crime thriller Jannat 2 (2012), the horror Raaz 3 (2012), and the supernatural thriller Ek Thi Daayan(2013). Hashmi's acclaimed performances in the action thriller Once Upon a Time in Mumbaai (2010) and the political thriller Shanghai (2012) garnered him two Best Supporting Actor nominations at the Filmfare Awards—and received praise for his role in the 2015 drama Hamari Adhuri Kahani."

  "text" : "Walter Earl Durand (1913–1939) was an American from Wyoming who became known as an outlaw after he escaped from jail and killed a number of officers who tried to apprehend him during an 11-day manhunt in the Teton mountains of Wyoming. His parents were farmers from Powell, Wyoming where he grew up. He was a mountain man who lived off the land in the mountains of Wyoming during the years following the Depression. He was arrested for poaching elk because he did not believe in the newly implemented hunting license system. While in jail in Cody, Wyoming, he escaped by taking the sheriff's gun and forcing the sheriff to drive him into the countryside before he returned to his home. At his home, he shot and killed two officers who came to bring him back to jail and then he armed himself and headed into the wilderness. The prosecutor initially deputized 10 men to form a posse to find and bring Durand in for trial. Durand shot and killed two of the Rangers who were searching for him. The manhunt grew to include the FBI, sharp shooters, the Wyoming National Guard with artillery from Fort Warren, civilians, and an airplane fitted with tear gas and dynamite bombs. During the manhunt, Durand eluded the pursuers for several days. He car-jacked a vehicle and drove it to Powell where he attempted to rob a bank. He spent several minutes shooting at the windows and walls of the bank. He then took several hostages, one of whom was killed by a citizen trying to take down Durand as they left the bank. Durand was shot by Tip Cox  and crawled back into the bank where he killed himself with a shot to the neck. The 11 day manhunt was heavily covered by the press, with Durand being nicknamed \"Tarzan of the Tetons\". The John Wayne B movie Wyoming Outlaw was inspired by the manhunt and appeared in theaters 3 months after Durand's death. Durand was later portrayed by Peter Haskell in a 1974 Hollywood movie The Legend of Earl Durand."

He also regularly contributed political cartoons, often of a pro-Scottish independence nature, to these, and other, newspapers. Born in Maryhill, Bain's family came from Skye, Highland. He was educated at Woodside School, Glasgow, and the Glasgow School of Art. Bain was by profession an art teacher, who taught at both Allan Glen's and Kingsridge Senior Secondary Schools. In 1969 he gave up teaching to concentrate full-time on his cartoon work. In addition to his work for the daily press, Ewen Bain was also very supportive of the monthly, pro-independence Scots Independent newspaper, contributing a long series of editorial cartoons to the publication between 1978 and his death in 1989. He also helped many Scottish National Party candidates with contributions to their election material."

He studied art at the school of Guido Galletti at Genoa and then, from 1932 to 1936, continued his studies at the Brera Academy of Fine Arts in Milan under Francesco Messina. Already at the age of sixteen he won a first prize for his artwork at an exhibition in Genoa. In the 1930s, he was a member of the futurist group Synthesis. After World War II, he held a post as a lecturer at the Academy of Fine Arts of Genoa until 1969. Alfieri presented his work several times at the Biennale of Venice: in 1940, 1948, 1950, and in 1956 even in a dedicated hall. His work has been characterized as oscillating between avant-garde and traditional. Besides expressionist works such as the Dagna grave at the cemetery of Staglieno, he also did traditional sculptures like the statue of Christopher Columbus that was given as gift to the city of Columbus, Ohio in the United States in 1955. Some of his works are abstract, for instance the Mele grave at Staglieno, or the bas-relief \"Furor Mathematicus\"."

She was already Yao Chang's wife before he declared imperial title, and when he did in 386, he created her empress and created her son Yao Xing crown prince. After he died in 394 and was succeeded by Yao Xing, she was honored as empress dowager. She died in 397, and Yao Xing was said to be so saddened that he was unable to gather officials for imperial meetings and handle important matters of state, although he eventually did so while still wearing mourning clothes. (However, it should also be noted that oddly enough, Yao Xing was recorded as having posthumously honored a concubine of his father, Consort Sun, as empress dowager, suggesting that Consort Sun was his birth mother but that Empress She raised him. Given a lack of conclusive evidence, however, Empress She should probably still be considered his mother.)"

  "text" : "Elisabeth Ohlson (born 1961) is a Swedish photographer and an artist. In her works she often photographs representatives of sexual minorities. Ohlson, a lesbian, is most noted for her exhibition Ecce homo which portrayed Jesus among homosexuals and transvestites. The scenes were modern versions of stories of the New Testament, such as Jesus riding a bicycle in a gay parade like in the Triumphal entry he rode to town with a donkey. With her works, Ohlson has wanted to remind people that Jesus worked with and helped the outcasts of the society. She had the idea when one of her friends died of AIDS in the early 1990s. The first Ecce Homo exhibition was held in Stockholm in 1998. Later an exhibition was held in the Uppsala Cathedral which the archbishop K. G. Hammar had approved. Later Ecce Homo toured around the world. An Ecce Homo exhibition opened on 3 October 2012 in Belgrade, Serbia, currently the only city in this part of Europe in which an exhibition of Ecce Homo is being held. The exhibit had to be protected by 24/7 security guards. In 2009, the Swedish Humanist Association awarded Ohlson the Ingemar Hedenius prize for secular humanism. The Eskilstuna Art Museum held an Ohlson retrospective in 2015, covering her work from 1988 through 2012."

Tullis served as a trustee of twelve colleges and seminaries. He remained active in retirement and authored several books – First Sermons, Shaping The Church from the Mind of Christ and The Heart of Evangelism – and his penultimate book, The Birth of The Book, which evolved from his experience teaching adult Sunday School for the preceding twenty years at Long's Chapel United Methodist Church in Lake Junaluska, North Carolina. His last book was a history of the Magee Christian Education Foundation, of which he had been a director for 40 years. In 2004 Bishop Tullis was inducted into the Alumni Hall of Fame of Kentucky Wesleyan. He died aged 88 on October 6, 2005 at his home in Lake Junaluska, North Carolina."

  "text" : "Ed Fries is the former vice president of game publishing at Microsoft during much of the Xbox's lifecycle. Fries fell in love with games while playing early arcade games like Frogger. Both of his parents were engineers, and he sees in his love for games something similar to his father's love for airplanes while working at Boeing. As a teen he programmed clones of popular arcade games on the Atari 800, and a publisher offered him the chance to have his games published. After earning a B.S. in Computer Science from New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology in 1986 Fries returned to the Seattle area to join Microsoft on productivity software. He has referred to this time as being like Ender's Game and says \"We were recruited as children to fight in their wars, Excel vs Lotus 1-2-3 and Word vs WordPerfect.\"  In the late 1990s he led the team that created the first version of the Xbox game console. He was a prime evangelist of the platform to game developers and had an important role in the acquisition of developers Bungie Studios, Ensemble Studios and Rare. Fries left Microsoft in January 2004. He consulted with a startup company, FireAnt, that was later sold to Sony Online Entertainment. He was also involved with several startups including Ageia, which aims to bring the first \"physics accelerator\" chip for games to market, and Emotiv Systems, a company building an EEG based game controller. Fries is currently working on bringing his favorite game, World of Warcraft, to three-dimensional life with his startup company, Figure Prints. The company makes 3D models of a player's characters using a fleet of Z Corporation printers. Within the first 12 hours of his company going live, over 4,000 people had requested an order for a model. Fries explains in an interview that each model can take about one week to complete. In July 2010, Fries released an Atari 2600 game inspired by the Halo series, called Halo 2600. He is currently listed as the advisor for the Ouya, an Android-based game console and development platform."
