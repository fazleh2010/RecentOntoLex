He started his career working on Radio when he was 15 years old. From 1972 to 1998, Lizarazo hosted and directed Colombia’s most important weekly comedy show “Sabados Felices” (Happy Saturdays, Caracol TV). The show still airs today for a total of 40 years on the Colombian airways, making it Colombia’s oldest TV show and national treasure. From 1982 to 1998 Lizarazo also hosted, directed and curated the syndicated program “El Festival Internacional Del Humor” (International Humor Festival), presenting the most recognizable Spanish speaking comedians from Latin America and the world for an annual, televised Festival recorded in Bogota, Colombia. The Festival was co-produced with Caracol TV and the show was later syndicated throughout Latin America (16 Seasons). “A town without a school is a town without a future,” reads the theme of Lizarazo’s Foundation “Lleva una Escuelita en tu Corazon” (Live with a School in your Heart Foundation.) For 30 years his Foundation built 320 Elementary schools in poor, small Colombian towns. Because of his longstanding recognition and commitment to social causes, Lizarazo was elected Senator for the Republic of Colombia from 1998 to 2002."

However, for unknown reasons, he resigned on 15 July 1393 in favor of Pietro Campofregoso. This occurred during a period of political chaos in the Genoese Republic, and after just one day, on 16 July, Campofregoso resigned, to be replaced by Clemente Promontorio; the latter, however, was deposed after a few hours by Francesco Guistiniano di Garibaldo, who reigned until 30 July. On that date Antoniotto di Montaldo, after a struggle with Antoniotto Adorno, recovered the dogal title, which he kept until 24 May 1494. After losing power, he took refuge in Savona. He died in 1398, perhaps in Genoa, and was buried in the church of San Bartolomeo degli Armeni."

  "text" : "Alard Banastre (fl. 1174), was High Sheriff of Oxfordshire under Henry II in 1174 and 1176. In this capacity, Banastre was appointed, in company with the constable of Oxford, to fix the tallages and assizes on the king's demesnes in that county. He seems likewise to have been empowered to settle the pleas of the crown and the common pleas of the same shire. In 1175, though Alard Banastre was still sheriff, he does not appear to have acted in the capacity of justice errant. Possibly the king was again dissatisfied with the conduct of his sheriffs in judging their own counties; for, while in 1174 the number of counties judged by their own sheriffs bears a very considerable proportion to the whole, in 1176 the whole kingdom seems to have been practically placed under the power of six justices acting in couples. It was probably as a result of the great rebellion of 1174 that Henry II inaugurated this change; but in any case the name of Alard Banastre does not, apparently, occur again as one of the king's justices. The sheriff of Oxfordshire for the four years preceding 1174 was one Adam Banastre, who, as Foss suggests, may have been the father of Alard Banastre."

  "text" : "Agnes of Faucigny (died 11 August 1268) was suo jure Dame of Faucigny, and countess consort of Savoy by virtue of her marriage in 1236 to Peter II, Count of Savoy. She was born the eldest daughter of Aymon II, Seigneur de Faucigny. From her father, she was descended from the Seigneur de Faucigny and the Counts of Geneva. Her siblings were a younger sister Beatrice and an illegitimate brother Aymon de Faucigny; therefore her father appointed her heir in default of male heirs. Betrothed in February 1234, Agnes was married to Peter II, Count of Savoy sometime after 25 June 1236. Her husband succeeded as Count of Savoy in 1263, making her Countess of Savoy, a position she would enjoy for five years until her death. She bore him a daughter, Beatrice or Beatrix (c. 1237 – 21 November 1310), who married firstly Guigues VII of Viennois and secondly Gaston VII of Béarn; but due to the Salic law of succession, Beatrice was excluded from the succession to the County of Savoy, which would pass to Philip I, Count of Savoy after her husband's death. Originally intending to give a third of her inheritance to her daughter Beatrice and two thirds to her husband Peter, Agnes instead named her daughter as the sole heir to her lands in Faucigny, together with her daughter's husband the Dauphin de Viennois. This would lead to future territorial dispute between the House of Savoy and the Dauphin de Viennois over the territory, which the House of Savoy won back from the French at the Treaty of Paris (1355). She died on 11 August 1268 and was buried at Abbaye de Contamine-sur-Arve, Faucigny."

He was born at the house of his aunt in the Diamond, Monaghan town. His mother, Alice Williams had gone to visit her sister-in-law, Anne Whitla. Both women were heavily pregnant and went into labour almost simultaneously, with the result that Alexander arrived just before midnight on April 21, 1846 and his first cousin early the following day. Family legend had it that, after the two babes had been placed on red plush cushions to be admired by one and all, their mothers reclaimed the wrong babes! If that was the case, then Alexander was the man who, as Robert Whitla, emigrated to North America to distinguish himself in the Canadian Rifles. Another first cousin was Sir William Whitla, physician and politician, after whom the Whitla Hall at Queen’s University Belfast is named."

  "text" : "Andrew Nori (1952 – 9 July 2013) was a Solomon Islands lawyer and politician, arguably best known for his role in the ethnic conflict on Guadalcanal in the late 1990s and early 2000s. His father, Nori Nono'oohimae, was one of the founders of the Maasina Ruru movement of civil disobedience against British colonial rule, in the 1940s. A barrister by profession, Andrew Nori was \"one of the first Solomon Islanders to qualify as a lawyer\", and eventually became president of the Solomon Islands bar association. He began his political career when he was elected to the National Parliament in the 1984 general election, as MP for the West 'Are'are constituency. Prime Minister Sir Peter Kenilorea appointed him Minister for Home Affairs and Provincial Government, a position which he held for four years. He was re-elected in 1989, and, as head of the Nationalist Front for Progress, was for a time appointed Leader of the Official Opposition to Prime Minister Solomon Mamaloni's government. Re-elected to Parliament for a third term in 1993, he was appointed Minister for Finance in Prime Minister Francis Billy Hilly's government. In September 1994, he resigned in the face of reports that over A$70,000 had been transferred to his personal bank account from \"an unnamed overseas source\". He stated that he had \"listed the amount with the relevant leadership code commission\", but was stepping down \"until his name was cleared\". He did not regain his Cabinet position, and was defeated in his bid to retain his Parliament seat in the 1997 general election. This marked the end of his career in national politics. When migrants from Malaita in Guadalcanal began to be subject to violence from local ethnic militant groups in late 1999, and the armed Malaita Eagle Force was formed to defend their interests, Nori, himself a Malaitan, rapidly emerged as the \"leader\" or \"spokesman\" of the Eagle Force. On 5 June 2000, he led the Eagle Force into a coup d'état against Prime Minister Bartholomew Ulufa'alu, taking him hostage at gunpoint and demanding that he resign. Nori accused Ulufa'alu of not having prevented an escalation in the ethnic conflicts on Guadalcanal. The Eagle Force was temporarily described as \"in control\" of the capital city, Honiara. Nori told the Australian media he had led the coup because there was \"a need for an immediate change in leadership and for the issues relating to peace to be focussed on more seriously and for a more efficient method and mechanism to be established to attend to peace issues and on the negotiation between the warring parties on Guadalcanal\". The coup rapidly led to the arrival of a Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group delegation, which was welcomed by Nori, who expressed his hope that it would result in peace being brokered between the ethnic factions. Parliament voted to elect Manasseh Sogavare to the premiership, replacing Ulufa'alu, and the ethnic conflicts ceased for the most part with the Townsville Peace Agreement in October. In September 2000, the Pacific Media Watch accused Nori of having threatened journalist Duran Angiki and his family over an allegedly incorrect report published by the latter on Nori. In 2009, still practicing as a lawyer, Nori made headlines again by publicly criticising the Political Parties Registration and Administration Bill, saying it would entrench rather than resolve political instability in the country. As of early 2011, he was working as a consultant to the Customary Land Reform Unit, researching rules of customary land ownership throughout the country with an aim towards a government policy \"to codify customary land laws and have them elevated to statutory status\". In 2012, he was elected President of the National Olympic Committee of Solomon Islands. He died in hospital in Honiara on 9 July 2013, \"after a long illness\". In its obituary, the newspaper Solomon Star praised him as a \"great leader\" and one of the \"greatest figures\" in the country's history. Andrew Nori's wife, Delmah Nori, founded the Twelve Pillars to Peace and Prosperity Party in 2010. She is also the former president of the Solomon Islands Netball Association."

Nu'man was the son of Imru' al-Qays II ibn 'Amr and followed his father on the throne. He is best known for his construction of two magnificent palaces, the Khawarnaq and Sadir, near his capital al-Hirah, which were accounted by contemporary Arab lore among the wonders of the world. The Khawarnaq was built as a resort for his overlord, the Sassanid Persian shah Yazdegerd I (r. 399–420) and his son Bahram V (r. 420–438), who spent his childhood years there. According to later Arab tradition, he renounced his throne and became an ascetic, after a reign of 29 years. He is also reputed to have visited the Christian hermit Symeon the Stylite between 413 and 420. He was succeeded by his son al-Mundhir I (r. 418–452), who played an important role by assisting Bahram V in claiming his throne after Yazdegerd's death and by his actions in the Roman–Sassanid War of 421–422."

  "text" : "Al-Hadi Ali (1345/46 – September 6, 1432) was a claimant to the Zaidi state in Yemen, who posed as imam from 1393 to 1432 in rivalry with another prince. Ali bin al-Mu'ayyad was a fifth-generation descendant of the imam al-Hadi Yahya (d. 1239). After the demise of imam an-Nasir Muhammad Salah ad-Din in 1391, a struggle broke out between his son al-Mansur Ali and another contender, al-Mahdi Ahmad bin Yahya. Al-Mansur imprisoned his opponent in 1392, but was then challenged by Ali bin al-Mu'ayyad, who took the honorific (laqab) name al-Hadi Ali. During his almost 40 years long imamate he was generally overshadowed by al-Mansur Ali, who was celebrated as a mujaddid bi-sayfihi, a warlike restorer, and who died only in 1436. Nevertheless, al-Hadi Ali had a following and was counted by some as a mujaddidun. These are figures who, according to a hadith, will appear every century to restore Islam. He died in 1432, leaving ten sons, of whom al-Hasan (1401–1486) became a prominent scholar. Al-Hasan's son in turn, al-Hadi Izz ad-din, held the Zaidi imamate in 1474–1495."

He studied at the Leipzig Conservatory as a pupil of Ignaz Moscheles, Carl Reinecke and Theodor Coccius. He later studied at Hoch Conservatory in Frankfurt under Joachim Raff. He was a prolific composer in many instrumental genres. His published works exceeded 160, but there were many other unpublished works, some of which are lost. These included 24 piano sonatas, one in each key, and 24 string quartets along the same lines. In later years he became well known for his many letters to English newspapers concerning the upkeep of the graves of distinguished people.These letters were published in two volumes - Truth Wit and Wisdom and More Truth Wit and Wisdom published by Chapman & Hall. Ashton was also well known for keeping a daily diary for the majority of his life from the age of 15 running to some 58 volumes. The diaries and the unpublished works are believed to have been destroyed during the Blitz when his family home was hit by German bombs."

  "text" : "Alfred John West (1857–1937) was a British award-winning marine photographer in the Gosport firm of G. West and Sons from 1881 (for an early reference see Exhibition Catalogue of the Photographic Society of Great Britain) and from 1897 at the age of 40, a pioneer cinematographer. He was then active in both roles until 1913 when he sold his copyright in negative plates of yachting studies to Beken of Cowes, and his stock of positive moving film to a distributor in Glasgow who quickly went out of business and disappeared with the material without completing the purchase. West tells us in his unpublished autobiography 'Sea Salts and Celluloid' (1936) that he  '... kept the negatives'  but the bulk of the film stock cannot now be traced. A few tantalising clips remain as does a full descriptive catalogue in the British Library of all the moving film he created under the 'Our Navy' brand. The stock of AJ West's negative plates is professionally conserved and currently held as a working archive for the production and sale of yachting prints by Beken of Cowes. West's plates are numbered from 500 to 10250 in the Beken archive. Alfred West died in 1937 and is buried at Kingston Cemetery Portsmouth in Hampshire (E Plot, Row 19, Grave 14)."

  "text" : "Anastasius (Greek: Αναστάσιος) was a Byzantine official, active in the reign of Justin II (r. 565–578). He held the positions of magister officiorum and quaestor sacri palatii. He seems to have died by the mid-570s. Anastasius was a native of Samaria, as recorded by John of Ephesus. The same primary source calls Anastasius both a Samaritan and a Palestinian, presumably as geographic terms. He is first mentioned as the subject of a panegyric composed by Flavius Cresconius Corippus. The poem is dated to late 565 or early 566. It describes Anastasius as holding the offices of magister officiorum and quaestor sacri palatii. This indicates that Anastasius had been appointed by Justin II, soon after the latter rose to the throne (14–15 November 565). He was presumably a loyal supporter or political ally of Justin. He probably succeeded Constantine as quaestor and Peter the Patrician as magister. Both men were long-serving ministers of Justinian I (r. 527–565) and Justin would want to replace them with his own loyalists. By the time Corippus wrote In laudem Justini minoris, his 566 panegyric in honour of Justin II, Anastasius had been replaced as magister officiorum. His immediate successor was apparently Theodore \"Kondocheres\" (\"Shorthand\"), a son of Peter the Patrician. On the other hand, Anastasius still held the position of quaestor into the 570s. Corripus keeps mentioning him as a quaestor in the second panegyric. John of Ephesus mentions him as the active quaestor in 571/572. Corippus credits Anastasius with measures aimed to help the Praetorian prefecture of Africa. John of Ephesus lists him as one of the officials opposed to Justin's amendments to the edict of the faith, c. 570. The amendments were considered favourable to the Monophysites and scandalised the Chalcedonians. His opposition to the amendments and John criticizing him as a false Christian, probably means that Anastasius himself was a Chalcedonian. The narrative of John contains a tale where Justin terrorizes Anastasius. The emperor reportedly ordered the quaestor to have twenty copies of the amended text by nightfall, or else face execution by decapitation. In 571, Anastasius was sent by Justin to discuss reconciliation terms with the monophysites. Their representatives refused to co-operate and Anastasius reported the failure to Justin. This ended the bried pro-monophysite period of Justin. On 22 March, 571, Justin started a new persecution of the monophysites. Anastasius was prominent among the senators conducting trials of monophysite bishops in 571 and 572. The trials took place at Constantinople, with most of the accused sentenced to exile. He co-operated closely with John Scholasticus, Patriarch of Constantinople. John of Ephesus accuses Anastasius of being in the Patriarch's payroll. A particularly hostile chapter of John of Ephesus alleges that Anastasius was a crypto-pagan, struggling to prevent the Christian Church from ever unifying. Anastasius' constant harassment of monophysites probably explains the hostility of the historian. John of Ephesus cites that when Samaritans came under religious persecution, Anastasius bribed officials to drop the charges. A minority of modern historians have suggested that Anastasius could have been an adherent of Samaritanism, posing as a Christian. Most consider him a genuine Chalcedonian, the charges against him being purely political. Anastasius reportedly suffered a seizure during \"the day of the adoration of the Holy Cross\". This could have been a Good Friday. Both 15 April 572 (Good Friday, 572) and 7 April 573 (Good Friday, 573) have been suggested as the date of the event. This sign of failing health was a precursor to his death, taking place \"a year and a half\" later. By 575, Anastasius seems to have died."

In 1777, he became an ensign in the New York Volunteers, serving during the American Revolution and reaching the rank of captain before being placed on half pay in 1783. McLean settled on the Nashwaak River in New Brunswick. He served as a justice of the peace. McLean was married twice: first to Prudence French and then to Susan Drummond. In 1810, he was named staff adjutant to Lieutenant-Colonel Joseph Gubbins, inspecting field officer for the New Brunswick militia. McLean took over this post in 1816 after Buggins left New Brunswicl. He died in Nashwaak."

But he declined her proposals, and without her consent married Lady Margaret Boyd, daughter of Thomas, Earl of Arran. For this he was condemned by the lords auditors on 5 July 1483 to pay Lady Dirleton double the value of his marriage or two thousand merks. He espoused the cause of James III when the son of that monarch rose in rebellion in 1488 against him. After the king's death at Sauchieburn he was summoned to answer before parliament to a charge of treason and conspiracy, but instead of obeying the summons he exposed the blood-stained shirt of the slain king on his spear at Aberdeen, and raised a considerable force there with the object of avenging his death. But his hopes of success were suddenly extinguished by the defeat of the Earl of Lennox (with whom he had been acting in concert) at Tillymoor, near Stirling, and on submitting to James IV, he was pardoned and received into favour. He died about 1491, survived by his widow, who was a granddaughter of James II, and who in 1509 married David, lord Kennedy, afterwards first earl of Cassilis, but leaving no issue. He was succeeded by his two brothers, Arthur, fifth lord, and John, sixth lord Forbes."

In 1980 he abandoned the BR and subsequently fled abroad, reaching Nicaragua after a period in Libya and Cuba. In the Central American country he participated in the Sandinist guerrilla against the Contras, after which, together with other Italian expatriates, he opened a restaurant in Managua, called \"Magica Roma\" and more recently another seafood restaurant called \"La cueva del Buzo\" (diver's lair) in Managua. Thanks to his Nicaraguan citizenship, obtained through his marriage with a local woman, he could not be extradited to Italy, despite the repeated requests of Italian magistrates."

  "text" : "Angelo Mascheroni (1855 in Bergamo, Italy – 1905) was a pianist composer, conductor, and music teacher, brother of the conductor Edoardo Mascheroni. He is most famous for his \"Eternamente\" for voice and violin, sung by Enrico Caruso; his two-act opera Il mal d'amore, with a libretto by Ferdinando Fontana, was written in 1898. Among his pupils was Spyridon Samaras. He studied music at the Conservatoire of his native city under the guidance of Alessandro Nini, with such success that at the age of nineteen he became conductor of an operatic company. With them he made the tour of Italy, France and Spain. Later Mascheroni spent some years in Greece and Russia and then visited all the cities of importance in North and South America. He spent five years in Paris, perfecting himself in the vocal art at the Paris Conservatoire with Léo Delibes for composition and Camille Saint-Saëns for piano; a few years later he made a name in England and America. When Mascheroni arrived in London, unknown, he experienced great difficulty in obtaining a few guineas for his song For all eternity; but this copyright when sold by public auction a few years later realized as many thousand guineas — the record price paid for a musical copyright. Other of his successful vocal compositions are : Woodland serenade, with mandolin obbligato, published in 1892, and Ave Maria, composed at Madame Patti's Welsh castle. Mascheroni was the author of several arrangements and original compositions for mandolin and piano, the principal being: On the banks of the Rhine; Tarantella, written in 1894, published by Augener, London; Fantasia on Faust (Gounod), and others of a like nature. Mascheroni also wrote obbligatos for the mandolin to several of his vocal compositions, as well as solos and duos for mandolin, with piano accompaniment. Music historian Philip J. Bone tried to describe the nature of Mascheroni's music, saying, Mascheroni struck out the golden mean between the German and Italian schools and his compositions combine the solidity and scholarly attainments of the German, with the grace, beauty and charm of the Italian schools.\" Bone said that Mascheroni's music was permeated with Italian traditions, with a \"beautiful melodic structure, a foundation of sound musicianship upon which the lighter graces and charms of lyric art flourish.\" Mascheroni had a son who studied the guitar and mandolin under his father, and appeared as a guitar soloist in London in 1902."

He specialized in gynecology as well as general medicine, and eventually became the personal physician of Frida Kahlo and performed surgery on Agustín Lara. As a musician, he studied under José Pierson and soon afterward had a successful international career as an opera singer, earning the label of “tenor of the Americas.” He was often cast for productions of L'elisir d'amore and Madame Butterfly. He earned a large sum of money doing this, and used it to establish a children’s hospital in Mexico City. Ortiz died in 1960, and was interred at the Panteón Frances de la Piedad. The Festival de Canto Operístico Tirado in the state of Sonora was named after him."

  "text" : "Ahmed Maher (born 2 December 1980 in Alexandria) is one of the co-founders of the April 6 Youth Movement, and a prominent participant in the anti-Mubarak demonstrations in Egypt in 2011. He is a civil engineer who works for a construction firm in New Cairo. Along with Asmaa Mahfouz, he founded the April 6 Youth Movement in Spring 2008. Maher attempted to organize several demonstrations after April 2008. However, his efforts were hindered both by interference from Egyptian security forces and internal divisions within the April 6 movement. In June 2010, Maher helped organize a protest against the killing, by Egyptian police, of Khaled Said, a young resident of Alexandria. Maher has expressed support for the potential bid of Mohamed ElBaradei for the Egyptian presidency. He appeared in the 2011 BAFTA award-winning film, How to Start a Revolution. Maher was detained on 29 November 2013 for holding a demonstration against a new Egyptian protest law. On 22 December 2013, together with other opposition leaders Ahmed Douma and Mohammed Adel, Maher was sentenced to three years in prison as a punishment for protests against recent steps by the Egyptian military government. Maher was expected to appeal to further judgment. The international community, including the U.S. State Department and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of France, criticized the court’s decision in the context of human rights in Egypt. In March 2014 Maher's lawyer complained that Maher, Douma and Adel were beaten by courthouse guards before an appeal hearing. Hamdeen Sabahi has censured the court conviction sentencing Ahmed Maher, Mohamed Adel and Ahmed Douma to three years in prison and a fine of LE50,000 and maintains that Interim President Adly Mansour should issue these and other detained individuals a pardon. The Constitution Party has expressed solidarity with the detainees and their families and requested that the interim President Adly Mansour issue a pardon to Ahmed Maher, Mohammed Adel, and Ahmed Douma, as well as to Loay Abdel Rahman, Omar Hussein, Islam Ahmed, and Nasser Ibrahim. In 2014 he wrote an article for the Washington Post titled \"The U.S. is supporting oppression in Egypt\"."

  "text" : "Andy Hollingworth is a British photographer, renowned for his portraits of figures from the world of comedy. He took up photography in 1986 whilst still at college in London and began documenting comedians in 1995. One of his most vivid childhood memories is seeing grandfather sitting watching television and laughing at Charlie Williams on The Golden Shot. Williams became his first subject. To date, Hollingworth has photographed many hundreds of comedians and comic actors from all schools of comedy, and his vast portfolio includes Bill Bailey, Steve Martin, Jo Brand, Ken Dodd, Victoria Wood, Ricky Gervais, Eddie Izzard, Beryl Reid, Rowan Atkinson, Eric Idle, Stephen Fry, Flight of the Conchords, Ross Noble, Paul Merton and the Comedy Store Players. He was the sole photographer granted access on the set of Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant's seminal show The Office, staged a solo exhibition at the National Media Museum and Hollingworth's work is now recognized as an important archive for the medium. Outside the comedy industry, he has photographed an eclectic range cultural figures; Ian McKellen, Billy Bragg, Simon Armitage, Ken Loach Jim Broadbent, Jarvis Cocker, Carol Ann Duffy, Willy Russell, Richard Dawkins, Roger McGough, Anthony Gormley and Brian Cox. His work has toured in several major exhibitions and he has been published in The Independent, The Big Issue, the Daily Express, The Times, the Journal of the Royal Photographic Society and has twice been featured in the British Comedy Awards. In January 2011 his work was featured in a two-day conference on the art of comedy, held at the British Library. He rarely gives interviews and has described his work as 'just a Sunday hobby'. Hollingworth's photographs are also included in the collections of the National Portrait Gallery."

  "text" : "Amraal Lambert, Nama name: ǂGaiǀnub, (ca. 1774 – 13 February 1864) was the first Captain of the Kaiǀkhauan (Khauas Nama), a subtribe of the Orlam, in the eastern area of Namaland, today's Namibia. Amraal Lambert was born around 1774 near Hex River in the Clanwilliam district in the Cape Colony (today's South Africa). A Cape Khoikhoi descendant, his status was little better than that of a slave, and he was forced to work in Worchester and Cape Town in his youth. In 1814 Lambert moved to Namaland (today's eastern-central Namibia), accompanied by missionary Heinrich Schmelen, who baptised him in Bethanie in 1815. Schmelen and the Kaiǀkhauan group led by Lambert stayed together for 14 more years but Schmelen closed the missionary station in Bethanie in 1822 and travelled on. Lambert accompanied Schmelen on his travel to Walvis Bay in 1825. Between 1830 and 1860, Amraal Lambert and his cousin Jonker Afrikaner controlled much of southern and central South-West Africa. Together they have been described as \"super-power[s] in the cattle raiding business\". From 1825 onwards Jonker Afrikaner and his council played a dominant political role in Damaraland and Namaland, creating a de facto state. In 1840 Lambert and his people moved to Naosanabis (today Leonardville) where they allied with ǁOaseb, leader of the Khaiǁkhaun (Red Nation). In 1855 or 1856 they abandoned Naosanabis and moved to ǂKoabes. Amraal, who spoke only Afrikaans, could not pronounce the Nama name for this settlement, and changed it to its now common name Gobabis. In the 1860s the Kaiǀkhauan were severely weakened in their political and economic power. Their cattle died of lung disease, and smallpox befell the Nama community at Gobabis. Many members of the Lambert family succumbed to the disease, among them Amraal who died on 13 February 1864 in Gobabis. His grandson Andreas Lambert succeeded him as Captain of the Kaiǀkhauan at the age of 20."

His primary professional interests lie in cosmology, birth and evolution of galaxies, astronomical instrumentation, and extragalactic astronomy. From 1993 to 1995 Dressler chaired the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy (AURA) committee \"HST & Beyond: Exploration and the Search for Origins\" that provided NASA with the document \"A Vision for Ultraviolet-Optical-Infrared Space Astronomy\". He was a member of the Nuker Team and the Morphs collaboration which studied the evolution of spiral galaxies using the Magellan Telescopes and the Hubble Space Telescope. Dressler was chairman of the Origins Subcommittee (OS) for NASA from 2000 to 2003, but declined membership in the Review of Near-Earth Object Surveys and Hazard Mitigation Strategies, Survey/Detection Panel. Dressler is currently working on the Inamori Magellan Areal Camera and Spectrograph (IMACS) Cluster Building Survey which studies the evolution of stellar structures and populations in distant galaxy clusters, which means the events observed took place four to seven billion years ago. He is also a member of the Terrestrial Planet Finder Coronograph Science and technology definition team."

August Hermann joined her in India and married her there in 1897. He was a Moravian Church missionary in the Himalayas serving in that capacity in Ladakh, a major region of Jammu and Kashmir Province from 1896 until 1909. His return to Europe was occasioned by his wife's illness. He was subsequently appointed professor of Tibetan languages at Berlin University. After Yoseb Gergan produced the first draft of the Tibetan Bible in 1910, Francke corrected it and then sent it to David Macdonald, the British trade agent in Yatung. Also involved was his Moravian colleague Heinrich Jäschke who produced A Tibetan-English dictionary. Francke became professor at Berlin and his students included Walter Simon."

  "text" : "Anthony Hicks (26 June 1943 – 26 May 2010) was a Welsh musicologist, music critic, editor, and writer. Born in Swansea, Hicks read mathematics at King's College London during the mid-1960s and worked for roughly a quarter of century as a computer systems analyst at the University of London (retired 1993). Although he was educated in the field of mathematics and computer science, his own personal obsession with baroque music led him to pursue scholarly music research in his spare time. What began as more or less a hobby developed into a highly distinguished para-career as a historian and writer. He became one of the leading 20th century scholars on George Frideric Handel. As a music critic, Hicks wrote for Early Music Review and The Musical Times. For the 2001 edition of The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians he penned Handel's biography and several other Handel related entries. He also authored most of the Handel related articles in the New Grove Dictionary of Opera. He became an important advocate for historically informed performances just as the renewed enthusiasm for baroque music began to take off in the 1960s and 1970s. His research has been used widely in preparing baroque works for recordings and performance; most notably with the Academy of Ancient Music with whom he worked closely for several decades. Musicians with whom Hicks collaborated on recordings were Christopher Hogwood, Paul McCreesh, Robert King, Trevor Pinnock, Emma Kirkby, John Eliot Gardiner, and Alan Curtis among many other distinguished baroque performers. He died at the age of 66 in London in 2010 of pulmonary fibrosis."

  "text" : "Arne Paasche Aasen (18 June 1901 – 1 November 1978) was a Norwegian politician, journalist and poet, who worked for the labour movement. He was born in Steinkjer as a son of teacher and politician Augusta Aasen, née Paasche (1878–1920) and typographer Edolf Aasen (1877–1969). The family soon moved to Kristiania. In 1927 he married Valborg \"Vaps\" Moe (1901–1994). His sister was married to Paul Gauguin for some years. He joined the Norwegian Labour Party at an early age. His mother was a central figure here before her early death. Aasen was also a member of the Left Communist Youth League, and was present at the congress of 24 April 1927 when the Left Communist Youth League was merged with the Socialist Youth League to found the Workers' Youth League. His poetic debut came in 1921 with the collection Sigd og hammer (\"Sickle and Hammer\"), where he hailed the revolution and Vladimir Lenin. Later highlights among his poetry collections were Høstens have (1923), Plog og penn (1930), Verden vårt hjem (1931), Nakne livet (1935), Blomster og brød (1937) and Bak hvert vindu (1950). Many of his poems became songs, when given melodies by Jolly Kramer-Johansen. Well-known working class anthems include \"Frihetens forpost\", \"Seiren følger våre faner\", \"Sleggene synger (Samholdsangen)\", and \"Vi bygger landet\". More popular songs include \"De nære ting\" and \"Blåveispiken\". \"Blåveispiken\" was recorded by Kurt Foss and Reidar Bøe in 1950, and became a great success, selling 100,000 records. He worked as a journalist for a short time, in Fremtiden from 1924 to 1925 and also in Arbeidernes Pressekontor. He edited the Christmas magazine Arbeidets Jul. He also wrote humorous petites in Arbeiderbladet under the pseudonym Dorian Red. He died in November 1978 in Oslo."

For his work in combating homophobia, he was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire. Pitter grew up in Balham, South London. His parents, Vincent and Evelyn, were Jamaican immigrants. Pitter realised at the age of 10 that he was gay, and dealt with homophobic abuse from his schoolmates. He has played football since his youth for a number of amateur clubs. He was chosen to play midfield for the Sutton United youth team and had a trial at Wimbledon. While playing for Clapham Old Boys, he suffered racism from other players and was demoted from the first team to the fourth team after one of his teammates found out that he was gay. Observing that they wanted him gone, Pitter quit. In 1991, after seeing a listing in Time Out, he joined a group of gay men playing football in Regent's Park. This became Stonewall F.C., the first gay football club in Britain. In November 2010, he was informed that he would be appointed a MBE for his work against homophobia in London. His father died shortly after, before the New Year Honours list was made public in December. Pitter collected his MBE from Buckingham Palace on 8 February 2011 accompanied by his sister, his fiancé, and his mother-in-law. He was conferred with an Honorary Doctorate by the University of East London in 2011. Pitter currently lives in Balham with his husband Alan and works as an assistant manager at Boots. He plays for and manages Stonewall F.C.'s second team."

She became the first African American president of the Montana Library Association, the first African American president of the Pacific Northwest Library Association, and the first Montanan to serve on the Executive Board of the American Library Association.In addition to her work on behalf of libraries, Jacobs was a leader in civil rights activities throughout Montana. She served on the Great Falls Interracial Council, working to break down racial barriers within the community and for airmen at Malmstrom Air Force Base. She was active in the Montana Advisory Committee to the U.S. Civil Rights Commission and co-founded the Montana Committee for the Humanities. She was active in the Union Bethel African Methodist Episcopal Church, served as president of the Montana Federation of Colored Women’s Clubs, and was a national board member of the United Church Women. In 1999 the Great Falls Tribune named Alma Jacobs one of the top 100 Montanans in the 20th Century, and in 2010 the Great Falls Tribune named Alma Jacobs one of the top 125 Montana Newsmakers. In June 2009 the City of Great Falls proclaimed Alma Smith Jacobs Week, and the Great Falls Public Library dedicated a new plaza named \"The Alma Jacobs Memorial Plaza,\" citing her as “an exceptional librarian and community leader.”"

  "text" : "Abbe Mowshowitz (born 13 November 1939, Liberty, New York) is an American academic, a professor of computer science at the City College of New York and a member of the Doctoral Faculty in Computer Science at The City University of New York who works in the areas of the organization, management, and economics of information systems; social and policy implications of information technology; network science; and graph theory. He is known in particular for his work on virtual organization, a concept he introduced in the 1970s; on information commodities; on the social implications of computing; and on the complexity of graphs and networks. Before joining the faculty at The City College of New York, Mowshowitz was a faculty member at the University of Toronto (Departments of Computer Science and Industrial Engineering, 1968–1969); the University of British Columbia (Department of Computer Science, 1969–1980); and was research director in the Department of Science and Technology Studies at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (1982–1984). In addition, he was a visiting professor at the Graduate School of Management, Delft, The Netherlands (1979–1980); held the Tinbergen Chair in the Graduate School of Management at Erasmus University, Rotterdam, The Netherlands (1990–1991); was a professor in the Department of Social Science Informatics at the University of Amsterdam, The Netherlands (1991–1993, 1994–1997); and was the CeTim professor of Technology Innovation Management at the Rotterdam School of Management, Rotterdam, The Netherlands (2001–2002). Mowshowitz received a Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of Michigan in 1967 (under the direction of Professor Anatol Rapoport), and a BS in Mathematics from the University of Chicago in 1961. His research on the structural complexity of graphs (published in 1968) was based on a paper by Professor Nicolas Rashevsky who first introduced the idea of measuring the information content of a graph using Shannon's entropy measure. Mowshowitz formalized and extended Rashevsky's idea and characterized the structural complexity of various classes of graphs and binary operations on graphs. Two measures of structural complexity were defined, both relative to a partition of the vertices of a graph. One of the measures, based on a partition related to independent sets, stimulated Körner's development of graph entropy. Mowshowitz was an early and persistent advocate of and contributor to studies of the social relations of computing. He introduced an undergraduate course on that topic at the University of British Columbia in 1973; published a comprehensive text in 1976; served as vice-chairman (1983–1985) and chairman (1985–1987) of the ACM's Special Interest Group on Computers and Society; and was a member of IFIP Working Group 9.2 (Computers and Social Accountability) from 1977 to 1997. As the title of his book The Conquest of Will suggests, Mowshowitz aimed to extend the idea of conquest of the material world - theme of many inquiries into the implications of technology - to the realm of behavior and culture. He called attention to the threats posed by computer technology to personal privacy, political freedom and human identity, and, like Professor Joseph Weizenbaum in Computer Power and Human Reason (published in the same year), he pointed to the danger of excessive reliance on computers in areas traditionally requiring human judgment. As an extension of the last chapter of The Conquest of Will he produced a study-anthology of computers in fiction in an effort to stimulate further discussion of the social consequences of computer technology. In recent years he has (together with colleague Professor Akira Kawaguchi) developed and applied a quantitative measure of the bias of search engines on the World Wide Web. He also worked on the ethical implications of computing and, as a participant in a workshop held at SRI International in 1977 (organized by Mr. Donn Parker), developed a taxonomy of ethical issues that informed the later discussion leading to the ACM code of ethics adopted in 1992. As well as conducting research on ethical implications, he contributed to policy discussions surrounding computer technology. In 1979 he consulted (together with Professor Rob Kling) for the Rathenau Commission of the Dutch Ministry of Science Policy on the societal implications of microelectronics, and from 1980 until it closed in 1995, he consulted regularly for the U.S. Congressional Office of Technology Assessment, producing a variety of background reports on the social impact of information technology. His conceived the idea of virtual organization in the late 1970s, drawing on an analogy between the structure and function of global companies, on the one hand, and virtual memory in computer systems, on the other. This analogy led eventually to the formal definition presented in a paper that appeared in 1994 and elaborated in his book on virtual organization published in 2002. During the year 1979-1980, he was stimulated to develop and codify the idea of virtual organization through discussions with Professor Henk van Dongen and his colleagues at the Graduate School of Management in Delft, The Netherlands. In the course of elaborating the concept and its implications for society, he introduced the notion of information commodity to explain a key part of the economic foundation of virtual organization and developed mathematical models for pricing information commodities, both from the supply and the demand perspective. His work in network science combined an interest in the complexity of graphs and networks with practical experience in designing networks to support administrative functions. While at the University of Amsterdam, The Netherlands in the 1990s, he worked on the design and development of a network to support information sharing on drug related issues among member states of the European Union. This work contributed to the formation of the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction which was eventually established in Lisbon, Portugal. In recent years he has resumed his earlier research on the analysis of complex networks."

A demand voiced by some of those involved in the 2011 Egyptian protests was that el-Fiqqi step down as Minister of Information. On 10 February 2011, ahead of an address to the Egyptian people by President Hosni Mubarak, el-Fiqqi told Reuters that Mubarak would not be standing down as President, despite widespread rumours to the contrary. On 12 February, the day after the president resigned against the background of Egyptian Revolution of 2011, he was reported to be under house arrest. The same day he resigned from his position as Minister of Information. He is currently being held in custody facing charges of corruption."

Mobile and aggressive, he possessed the speed and versatility to beat any defender. Playing for CSKA Moscow he won eight consecutive Soviet Union League titles from 1977 to 1984. Even though his team was a Euroleague regular, Myshkin never had the chance to battle for the top continental title. As a member of the Soviet Union national team he led them to back-to-back Eurobasket titles in 1979 and 1981 and won gold at the 1982 World Championships in Colombia. He was named one of FIBA's 50 Greatest Players in 1991. Following his retirement, Myshkin became a manager, coaching CSKA Moscow, Arsenal Tula, Universitet Surgut and Dynamo Kursk. Since 2013, he is the head coach of the Russia women's national basketball team."

Chase was one of the pioneers in the area. He first came to Saco in about 1734, and soon after the division of the Humphrey Scamman property in 1736, purchased a part of the estate at the lower ferry and built an ordinary (tavern) there. He kept the ferry for several years, and was one of the builders of the first bridge on the west side of Indian Island. He drove the first team of oxen to Buxton, ME, and moved there in 1741. His daughter was said to be the first white child born in Buxton. Due to Indian wars, he moved to Newbury in 1744, then back to Saco in 1753. He was chosen as selectman at the first town meeting of Pepperellborough in 1762. Chase was active during the Revolutionary War, serving on the town's first Committee of Correspondence and on its Committee of Inspection. He was a lumberman and farmer, and prominent in religious and civic matters relating to the town and the Saco River. Chase was one of the largest taxpayers in the area. He was described as \"stately and commanding in figure, six feet in height, vigorous and erect even in old age, eloquent in conversation and pre-eminently so in prayer.\" \"His tongue seemed oiled from root to tip expressing eloquence. I thought him the finest looking old man I ever saw, long hair down over his shoulders, white as snow...\" Chase lived to be 100 years old. Chase's brother, Samuel Chase, was a signer of the Declaration of Independence and served as a Supreme Court justice. Dea. Chase's house in Saco, ME still exists (as a private residence) and has been recently restored."

  "text" : "Andrei Aleksandrovich Argunov (19 October 1866 – 7 November 1939) was a Russian revolutionary. Born in Yeniseysk, he became involved in the populist (narodnik) movement and joined 'The People's Will' in the 1880s. In 1896 he founded the 'Union of Socialist-Revolutionaries' in Saratov, later transferring its headquarters to Moscow. He wrote the Union's programme, Our Tasks, in 1898. The 'Northern Union', as it was also called, was one of the principal roots of the unified Socialist-Revolutionary Party (PSR) that emerged in 1901. A close associate of Argunov's in the Union was Evno Azev, who turned out years later to be a police agent. It united the 'Northern Union' with the 'Party of Socialist-Revolutionaries', also known as the 'Southern Party', that had been founded in Kiev in 1897 by Victor Chernov and others, along with several other groups. The 'Northern Party' had been mainly oriented toward urban organisation among intellectuals and (to a lesser extent) factory workers. It also endorsed political terrorism. In these respects the Northern Union followed Narodnaya Volya. The Southern Party was more reluctant to endorse terrorism and wanted to organise the rural peasantry. The unified PSR adopted a compromise position, endorsing terrorism and organisational work among workers, peasants and intellectuals alike. Argunov became a member of the Central Committee of the PSR and co-edited its journal, Revolutionary Russia (Революционная Россия), together with Mikhail Gots. Argunov was active in the Revolutions of 1905 and 1917. During the First World War, Argunov was a 'Defencist' and was associated with the right wing of the PSR. Argunov opposed the Bolshevik Revolution and went into exile in 1922. He died in Prague in 1939."

His main work, the Lopukhin Bible, a three-volume Bible with commentary, was published in 1904. He is buried at the Nikolskoe Cemetery of Alexander Nevsky Lavra. In 1988, at the request of Metropolitan Filaret of Minsk, the Russian Orthodox Church received 100,000 Ukrainian Bibles and 150,000 copies of the Lopukhin Bible, nearly doubling the number of Bibles held by the church."

  "text" : "An-Nasir Ali bin Salah (died 1329) was a claimant to the Zaidi state in Yemen, acting in rivalry with other pretenders in 1328–1329. Ali bin Salah bin Ibrahim was a grandson of the imam al-Mahdi Ibrahim who died in Rasulid captivity in 1284. When Imam al-Mahdi Muhammad bin al-Mutahhar died in 1328, a turbulent situation arose in the Zaidiyyah territories. Ali bin Salah put forward his da'wa (call for the imamate) in As Sudah, taking the laqab name an-Nasir. He was however immediately opposed by three other claimants. Fighting between the contenders followed, and lives were lost. After one year, an-Nasir Ali bin Salah died and was buried in As Suda. The winner in the power struggle was al-Mu'ayyad Yahya (d. 1346)."

Ahmad bin Ali al-Fathi was a seventh-generation descendant of Imam Abu'l-Fath an-Nasir ad-Dailami (d. 1053). He originated from the village Wakash in the Bani Matar area west of San'a. After the death of Imam al-Mahdi Muhammad bin al-Mutahhar in 1328, several pretenders surfaced. Ahmad bin Ali al-Fathi made his da'wa (call for the imamate) in 1329, from his base in the Sufian area. He is sometimes known by the title ad-Da'i (the one who practices da'wa). However, he had to contend with three other claimants called al-Mu'ayyad Yahya (d. 1346), an-Nasir Ali bin Salah (d. 1329), and al-Wathiq al-Mutahhar (d. 1379/80). The competition was fierce and many lives were lost. Al-Mu'ayyad Yahya soon triumphed, and stood out as the main political force in the Zaidi territory until his death in 1346. The career of Ahmad bin Ali al-Fathi after c. 1330 is obscure. He died in Rughafa, close to Sa'dah, in 1349."

  "text" : "Adolf VIII of Berg (also referred to as Adolf V) (c. 1240 – 28 September 1296) was the eldest son of Count Adolf VII of Berg and Margaret of Hochstaden. In 1259, Adolf succeeded his father as Count of Berg. King Rudolph I of Germany allowed Adolf to move his mint to Wipperfürth in 1275. In 1276 Adolf granted city rights to Ratingen and in 1282 to Wipperfürth. Adolf tried in vain to have his brother Conrad, Provost of Cologne, installed as Archbishop of Cologne after the death of Engelbert II of Falkenstein in 1274, but Siegfried II of Westerburg was chosen instead. In 1279 Adolf's uncle Waleran IV, Duke of Limburg died leaving one daughter, Ermengarde, wife of Reginald I, Count of Guelders. When she died in 1280 without issue, her husband claimed the Duchy of Limburg even though Adolf also had a claim to Limburg as Waleran's eldest nephew. Adolf tried unsuccessfully to assert his claim and in 1283 he sold his right to Duke John I of Brabant. The counter-claims of Duke John and Reginald I ultimately led to the Battle of Worringen in 1288 in which Adolf supported the victorious Brabant. Archbishop Siegfried was captured and imprisoned by Adolf in Schloss Burg for 13 months. As a result of the victory, Adolf was also able to elevate Düsseldorf to the level of city. Through trickery, Archbishop Siegfried was able to capture Adolf in 1292 and held him in prison until he died on 28 September 1296. In 1249, Adolf was betrothed to Elisabeth of Guelders, daughter of Otto II, Count of Guelders and half-sister of Reginald I, his rival to the Duchy of Limburg. Elisabeth died 31 March 1315 and is buried with her husband in the Church of Solingen-Gräfrath. As Adolf and Elisabeth had no issue, Adolf's brother William I of Berg succeeded him as Count of Berg."

I, Curmudgeon is a 2004 film about self-declared curmudgeons, himself included, which received a Silver Hugo at the 2005 Chicago International Film Festival. The film was shot on a camcorder, with Zweig using a mirror to record his own experiences. Lovable is a 2007 film about our preoccupation with finding romantic perfection. In 2009, Zweig moved from autobiographical subject matter to explore the struggle of ex-convicts to lead normal lives in A Hard Name, which received the Genie Award for best documentary. His 2013 film When Jews Were Funny, an exploration of the role of Jewish comedians in North American comedy and humour, won the prize for Best Canadian Feature Film at the 2013 Toronto International Film Festival. Again, he uses most of the movie exploring his own position as a Jew married to a non-Jewish woman and a new father. Hurt, his documentary film about Steve Fonyo, was released in 2015. It won the Platform Prize at the 2015 Toronto International Film Festival."

  "text" : "Adolf IX of Berg (also referred to as Adolf VI) (c. 1280 – 3 April 1348) was the eldest son of Henry of Berg, Lord of Windeck and Agnes of the Mark. In 1308, Adolf succeeded as Count of Berg upon the death of his uncle William I of Berg who had no children. Adolf was an important and loyal supporter of Ludwig IV of Bavaria, helping him since 1314 in the war of succession. As a result of Adolf's 1312 marriage to Agnes of Cleves, he received the Rhine customs of Duisberg as a dowry and these were confirmed as an imperial fief by Emperor Louis in 1314. He continued the constant feuds between the House of Berg and the Archbishops of Cologne. In 1327/28, he joined Louis on his trip to Rome where he was crowned as Emperor. Adolf received the privilege to mint silver which he did at Wipperfürth. In 1337 Adolf joined the English-German Alliance which caused the start of the Hundred Years' War. In 1312 Adolf was married to Agnes of Cleves (c. 1295 – aft. 1361), daughter of Dietrich VII, Count of Cleves and Margaret of Habsburg-Kiburg. He died on 3 April 1348 without children and was succeeded by his only surviving niece, Margaret of Ravensberg by right of her mother, and her husband Gerhard VI of Jülich as Count and Countess of Berg. Thus, the Counties of Berg and Ravensburg came in 1348 under the house of Jülich, and were in 1437 united with the County of Jülich. In 1511 all three passed into the house of Cleves."

Originally from Mooroolbark, in Melbourne's outer eastern suburbs, he showed potential as a junior playing for the Mooroolbark Mustangs in the Eastern Football League. He then moved clubs where his playing ability for Vermont Football Club saw him progress to the Eastern Ranges, where he played as a winger. He was elevated to North Melbourne's senior list in August 2011, after playing well for North Ballarat in the Victorian Football League and was named to make his AFL debut in Round 22 of the 2011 AFL season against Fremantle. Mullett made his debut against Fremantle in number 41 and impressed with 17 touches. Mullet was the round 2 nomination for the 2013 AFL Rising Star after a 20 possession and a goal against Geelong. He later pulled in a career-high 31 disposals in round 10 later that year against St.Kilda. Mullett was selected in the AFL Players' Association's inaugural 22under22 team in 2013."

  "text" : "Alan Alexander Buchanan (28 February 1905 – 4 February 1984) was an Anglican bishop in the second half of the 20th century.  Educated at Masonic Boys School and Trinity College, Dublin, he was ordained in 1931. He served as a chaplain with military forces during the Second World War, notably parachuting into Arnhem in 1944 and being captured by the Germans. In the Airborne Museum at Oosterbeek there is a serviceman's prayer card displayed which is signed by Alan Buchanan. He was with the Church of Ireland Mission in Belfast until 1937, after which he held incumbencies at St Cedma Inver and St Mary, Belfast and St Comgall, Bangor. He was Bishop of Clogher from 1958 to 1969, when he became Archbishop of Dublin and Primate of Ireland. He resigned in 1977 and died on 4 February 1984. Among other things, Archbishop Buchanan was known as an advocate for women's ministry. In the early 1970s, he had spoken to the Diocesan Synod of Dublin: \"Is it right to limits the possibility of ordination to one half of the Church? Our House of Bishops has recently echoed the view of Lambeth that there is no theological reason against the ordination of women. The Church in Canda has already decided in favour...the Church of Ireland should at least declare its mind on the subject.\" He personally invited and trained the first five women to be commissioned Lay Readers in the Church of Ireland in 1975, including Daphne Wormell and Patricia Hastings-Hardy. When the group chose a maroon liturgical gown, which looks similar to the bishops' red, he told them, \"If they like to think I am commissioning five lady bishops, let them think it!\" His daughter, Desiree Stedman, was ordained in the Anglican Church of Canada. She was accepted into training in 1982 before the Church of Ireland voted to ordain women as deacons in 1984, and as priests and bishops in 1990. Buchanan missed these developments, having died in February 1984."

  "text" : "Austin Eldon Knowlton (July 23, 1909 – June 25, 2003) was trained as an architect but spent most of his career in the construction industry. His company designed, financed and built more than 160 college and university buildings on every major college campus in Ohio and more than 200 elementary and secondary school buildings. His companies have also constructed more than 35 major hospitals and 43 United States Post Offices throughout the country. In his lifetime, he designed more than 600 buildings. A. E. Knowlton was born in Athens, Ohio in 1909, the second child of Clarence Luster Knowlton (\"CL\") and Vertura Mae Cundiff. His father had founded Knowlton Brothers Construction in 1906 with his brother Everett and had been in the construction business in Athens, Ohio. About 1917, they were awarded the contract to build the Mary Rutan Hospital in Bellefontaine, Ohio and both brothers relocated to Bellefontaine and made it their home. The brothers separated their business about 1923, at which time \"CL\" formed his new company, C. L. Knowlton and Sons, Contractors, with sons Clarence Ernest (\"CE\") and Austin Eldon (\"AE\"). Eldon Knowlton grew up in Bellefontine, played football in high school and gained the nickname \"Dutch.\" He was graduated from Bellefontaine High School in 1927 and then attended The Ohio State University where one of his favorite professors was Howard Dwight Smith. He was a member of Alpha Rho Chi fraternity. Dutch was graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Architecture, class of 1931. He rejoined his father's firm after graduation. After his father's retirement from the business, \"AE\" and \"CE\" founded the Knowlton Construction Company in 1937. Although Dutch suffered from dyslexia, he could add long columns of numbers in his head, and used a slide rule to calculate construction bids. A. E. \"Dutch\" Knowlton's company specialized in educational, health care and commercial buildings. At his alma mater alone, he designed the Fawcett Center, Hitchcock Hall, Houck House, Jones Graduate Tower, the School of Allied Medical Professions, Wilce Health Center, Drake Union and Larkins Hall addition (the latter demolished 2005 to make way for a new Recreation and Physical Activities Center). In 1994 The Ohio State University renamed its School of Architecture the \"Austin E. Knowlton School of Architecture.\" University President E. Gordon Gee praised the gift from Knowlton that made it possible for OSU to provide the finest architectural education possible. A new building designed by the firm of Mack Scogin Merrill Elam Architects of Atlanta, Georgia, Knowlton Hall, opened for the School of Architecture in the fall of 2004. In 1995, Ohio State presented an Honorary Doctorate of Architecture to A. E. Knowlton. Austin Eldon Knowlton married Phyllis Yvonne Coulon of Bowling Green, Ohio, in August 1933 in Wilmette, Illinois. They had three children. He was divorced from Phyllis in 1974 and later married and divorced Susan J. Dlott. He resided in Bowling Green and Hamilton, Ohio before building a home on his Emerald Farms in Delaware County, Ohio in 1947. In later life he spent winters in Fort Lauderdale, Florida until he donated his Delaware estate in 2001 to Augustana College and took up Florida residence full-time. An enthusiastic sportsman, he raised championship American Saddlebred horses at Emerald Farms (colors: emerald and blue), which he showed under harness and his family under saddle for many years all over the midwest. In addition to show horses, he raced thoroughbreds and had an avid interest in baseball and football. He was a Trustee of the Little Brown Jug Society which runs the Triple Crown of Harness Racing for Pacers in Delaware, Ohio. He was a minority owner of the Cincinnati Reds in the 1970s, and was instrumental in building Riverfront Stadium. With Paul Brown, he co-founded the Cincinnati Bengals and was the largest shareholder and Chairman of the Board for twenty years. His Austin E. Knowlton Foundation has made many charitable gifts including funding the Knowlton Library of the Logan County District Library in memory of his parents and to The Ohio State University."

  "text" : "Sir Anthony St John was an English politician who sat in the House of Commons in 1624 and 1625. He supported the Parliamentary side in the English Civil War. St John was a son of Oliver St John, 3rd Baron St John of Bletso and his wife Dorothy Reid, daughter of Sir John Rede or Reid, of Odington, Gloucestershire. He was knighted on 5 August 1608 at Bletsoe together with his brother Alexander. In 1624 St John was elected Member of Parliament for Wigan. In 1625 he was elected MP for Cheshire. St John was a captain in the Earl of Essex Regiment of Foot in 1642 and continued to support the parliamentary side in the Civil War. St John lived at the ancient home of the St John family at Fonmon Castle. The house was sold in 1656 to Colonel Philip Jones. St John married Lady Katherine Herbert, 24 April 1610 St. Andrew Holborn, London, England; widow of Sir W. Herbert and a daughter of Dr. Aubrey, and by her had Oliver (who died 8) and Dorothy. His daughter Dorothy married Sir John Booth. His eldest brother Oliver inherited the Barony and became Earl of Bolingbroke. His brothers Beauchamp and Alexander sat as MPs for Bedford."

  "text" : "Alexander Lowen (December 23, 1910 – October 28, 2008) was an American physician and psychotherapist. A student of Wilhelm Reich in the 1940s and early '50s in New York, he developed bioenergetic analysis, a form of mind-body psychotherapy, with his then-colleague, John Pierrakos (February 8, 1921 – February 1, 2001). He is also noted for developing the concept of bioenergetic grounding, one of the foundational principles of bioenergetic therapy. Lowen was the founder and former executive director of the International Institute for Bioenergetic Analysis in New York City. The IIBA now has over 1500 members and 54 training institutes worldwide. Born in New York City, Lowen received a bachelor's degree in science and business from City College of New York, an LL.B and a J.S.D (a doctorate in law) from Brooklyn Law School. His interest in the link between the mind and the body developed during this time. He enrolled in a class on character analysis with Wilhelm Reich. After training to be a therapist himself, Lowen moved to Switzerland to attend the University of Geneva. Lowen lived and practiced for the majority of his life in New Canaan, Connecticut. He suffered a stroke in July 2006. The Alexander Lowen Foundation was founded in April 2007 to continue his legacy. Lowen died on October 28, 2008 at the age of 97. In 2007, Dr. Lowen established the Alexander Lowen Foundation, which is now directed by his son, Frederic Lowen."

  "text" : "Austin Peay (June 1, 1876 – October 2, 1927) was an American politician who served as Governor of Tennessee from 1923 to 1927. He was the state's first governor since the Civil War to win three consecutive terms, and the first to die in office. Prior to his election as governor, he served two terms in the Tennessee House of Representatives (1901–1905). Widely considered one of Tennessee's most effective governors, Peay enacted numerous government reforms. He consolidated government agencies, overhauled the tax code, improved state schools, drastically expanded the state highway system, and converted the massive state debt into a budget surplus. He also created Tennessee's first state park, and lent state support for the establishment of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. During his tenure, the balance of power in state politics shifted from the state legislature to the governor. In 1925, Peay signed into law the Butler Act, which barred the teaching of the Theory of Evolution in public schools. The enactment of this law led to the Scopes Trial, which took place later that year."

  "text" : "Abraham Albert Heaps (December 24, 1885 – April 4, 1954), also known as A. A. Heaps, was a Canadian politician and labour leader. Born in Leeds, England, Heaps immigrated to Canada in 1911 and worked in Winnipeg as an upholsterer. He was one of the leaders of the Winnipeg general strike of 1919 and was a Labour alderman on the Winnipeg City Council from 1917 to 1925. He ran for the Canadian House of Commons as a Labour candidate in 1923 in the riding of Winnipeg North but was defeated. He was elected in the 1925 election and joined J. S. Woodsworth as the sole Labour MP in Parliament. The Liberal government of William Lyon Mackenzie King was elected with a minority government. Heaps and Woodsworth agreed to support the Liberals in exchange for the government creating Canada's first old age pension. Heaps and Woodsworth joined other left-wing MPs to form the Ginger Group. He was a founding member of the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation in 1932, and was a charter member of the CCF's caucus. One of the few Jews in Parliament, Heaps pressured the government to allow Jewish refugees from the Nazis into Canada. He was defeated in the 1940 election due to a strong candidacy in Winnipeg North by the Communist Party's candidate. Heaps died in England while visiting family and was buried in his birthplace of Leeds. His son, Leo Heaps, wrote a 1984 biography about him called The Rebel in the House: The Life and Times of A.A. Heaps MP and was an unsuccessful New Democratic Party candidate in the 1979 federal election for the riding of Eglinton—Lawrence. His grandson, Adrian Heaps, was elected to Toronto City Council in 2006."

  "text" : "Alexander Hare (1775–1834) was an English merchant, infamous for establishing a harem and trading slaves in his personal state of Maluka, southeast Borneo. The son of a London watchmaker of the same name and his wife Janet, Alexander joined a trading company in Portugal around 1800, moved to Calcutta, and settled as a merchant in Malacca in 1807. Here he met Stamford Raffles, who appointed him Resident of Banjarmasin and Commissioner of the Island of Borneo when Dutch control briefly passed to Britain (1811–16). He acquired 1,400 square miles of land from the sultan and established it as an independent state, Maluka, which issued its own coinage. An inquiry carried out by William Boggie, the British Resident in Samarang in 1837, uncovered how he had operated what became known as \"the Banjermasin Outrage\". He had to leave when the Dutch returned and he took his harem, and others, first to Batavia until declared undesirable in 1819, and then to South Africa until forced to leave in 1826, whence he went to settle the Cocos (Keeling) Islands. Conflict with John Clunies-Ross led to him leaving the Cocos Islands in 1831, some say for Singapore, others say Batavia, but died in Bencoolen (modern day Bengkulu on the south-west coast of Sumatra) on 2 November 1834. Alexander had three brothers: David (b.1777), became a jeweller in Batavia, while John (b.1782) and Joseph (b.1784)  were traders in colonial goods in London. The English censes of 1851 and 1861 show Fatimah, Joseph's niece born in the East Indies, living in his London house: as she appears to have been born in 1837 she was presumably David's daughter. She married James Graham at St Peter's, Pimlico 22 May 1862 and died at London 1874. Hare's story features in the novel The Daughter of the Pangaran by David Divine, published in 1963."

He also took care of his mother until she died in 1996. At the age of 16 he worked for the Trinidad Steam Laundry. He founded Century21 Janitorial and Caribbean Airduct services. He took up his passion for social work at a young age. Since his teen years he has worked in the Sangre Grande Magistrates' Court. Khan’s first recognised act as a humanitarian was when he took a group of scout troopers to Tobago for one week. At the age of 28 Khan, a scout master, organised a boat to transport 11 scout troupers stranded in Tobago back to Trinidad when there were no available boats. Khan then spoke about the incident on live radio at that time about the incident which the then Government opposed and as a result caused Khan embarrassment to him and his company. Khan became a local symbol when he assisted numerous churches and mosques, by raising funds through raffles, donations, BBQ and other fund raising events. The proceeds went towards the homeless and needy. Khan, with his wife, owns and operates several janitorial service companies. Throughout his life, he has also been involved with social concerns, working with the Himalaya Club and scouting."

  "text" : "Asad Qureshi is a British filmmaker who was kidnapped on 26 March 2010 by a militant group called the \"Asian Tigers\" in Pakistan's Federally Administered Tribal Areas along the Afghanistan border, where he was making a film in North Waziristan and interviewing Taliban leaders. Qureshi was accompanied by his driver, Rustam Khan, and two senior members of the Inter-Services Intelligence, Khalid Khawaja and Colonel Imam during his trip. All four were abducted; Khawaja was killed and his body was found a month later in Mir Ali with an attached note accusing him of spying for the United States and being responsible for killing people during the Siege of Lal Masjid. Asad Qureshi and his driver were released in September 2010 through family negotiations after 165 days of captivity. Colonel Imam was executed in January 2011. Asad Qureshi's release was a rare occurrence as the Pakistani Taliban have been known to execute most of their victims. Asad Qureshi has British Pakistani origins. He has a reputation of an experienced filmmaker and prior to being detained, he had been based in Pakistan for over five years. It was not his first visit to Waziristan.In 2009 he made \"The Battle of Swat Valley\" for the BBC's Panorama, charting the army action taken in Swat against the Taliban. In April 2011 his film Defusing Human Bombs was screened in Pakistan; it shows the rehabilitation of children kidnapped by the Taliban and trained to be suicide bombers. He had started the film in September 2009 and the project was put on hold when he was kidnapped. He then continued the project after his release. Usman Punjabi, who planned the kidnap, was killed two weeks before Asad Qureshi's release and Sabir Mehsud, the leader of the Asian Tigers, was himself kidnapped by Hakimullah Mehsud. Sabir Mehsud was tortured and beaten and shot in the face so many times that he was beyond recognition."

  "text" : "Achille Collas (1795–1859) was a French engineer, inventor, writer and engraver who developed a way of mechanically creating engravings after medallions and other reliefs, and a machine to copy sculptures at a smaller scale, the so-called \"réduction méchanique\", which popularized small sculptures and has been credited with being almost entirely responsible for \"the transformation of the bronze industry\". Achille Collas was born in Paris in 1795. He worked as an engineer before joining the Army at the end of the First French Empire. Afterwards he worked as a toolmaker and inventor. He never married. He applied for many patents, most of them for long-forgotten inventions for buckle-making machines and other tools. His most successful inventions had to do with the reproduction of 3D artworks in 2D and 3D. He produced the illustrations for The authors of England: A series of medallion portraits of modern literary characters, engraved from the works of British artists by Henry Fothergill Chorley from 1838: this work contains a ten-page introduction outlining the new procedure of mechanically creating engravings from cameos and medals, developed by Collas. He developed this method between 1825 and 1832, demonstrating it at the Salon of 1833. Using this procedure, he created the Trésor de numismatique et glyptique. When it was finished in 1850, it reproduced some 15,000 items, spread over 20 volumes. His second great invention came in 1836, when he produced a pantograph-like machine to reproduce sculptures in different scales and materials. In 1838, he started a company together with Ferdinand Barbedienne, the \"Société Collas et Barbedienne\", for the production and marketing of reduced copies of sculptures in different materials ranging from plaster and wood to bronze and ivory. The first product of the company was a reproduction of the Venus of Milo, but for the next ten years nothing much happened, until Barbedienne sent some pieces to The Great Exhibition of 1851, where the company received a special medal. Further success came in 1855, when Collas was awarded the Grand Médaille d'Honneur of the Exposition Universelle in Paris. The company had by 1892, at the time of Barbedienne's death, some 600 employees. The company existed until 1954."

Warren was born in Ilchester, Howard County, Maryland. He served in the United States Army during World War I. He was appointed US Counsul at Cape Hatien in 1922, then served in Karachi, Pakistan, Nairobi, Kenya and St. John's, Newfoundland (all at the time part of the British) empire. In 1931 he was made US Counsul in Buenos Aires. In 1932 he was advanced to the office of Consul General in that city in which office he served until 1935. As of 1941 Warren was the chief of the Visa Division of the United States State Department. From 1942-1943 Warren served as United States Minister to the Dominican Republic, and then as Ambassador there from 1943-1944. In 1944-1945 Warren served as US Ambassador to Panama. He then served From 1945-1947 as US Minister to New Zealand. From 1947-1950 he was US Minister to Finland. From 1950-1952 Warren was United States Ambassador to Pakistan and then from 1953-1956 he was United States Ambassador to Turkey. Warren married Mary Nicols Newman in 1923. During his time as Chief of the Visa Division, Warren had earned the reputation in conjunction with Breckinridge Long, assistant secretary of state, of enforcing stringent immigration controls and of delaying where they could not deny acceptance of refugees from Nazi persecution. Max Nussbaum, former Rabbi from Berlin, writes in his testimony to Yad Vashem on June 30, 1958: \"During those days after the outbreak of war, the American Vice consul Warren was the greatest misfortune for the Jews in Berlin. Inherently, emigration at that time was still possible since the USA had not yet entered the war and the Germans still approved applications. However, Warren sabotaged the whole emigration procedure and he is responsible for the death of hundreds of Jews since he declined to issue an already granted visa on the day it was needed for technical reasons. He postponed the issuance of the visa with the result that in the meantime the candidate for emigration was deported into a concentration camp.\" He died in Dallas, Texas on January 23, 1957."

The Apostolic Prefecture of Shiqian is a suffragan see in the Province of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Guiyang, also in China. Augustine Hu Daguo was born on 15 May 1921 to a family of long Christian tradition in Tongzhou, China. He was baptized when he was one month old. From the age of 7 to 11 he studied the Bible and regularly frequented the local Catholic church. In 1936 he entered the Minor Seminary of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Guiyang in Guiyang, China, in Guizhou Province. He was ordained to the priesthood on 29 June 1951. After his presbyteral ordination, he taught in the Major Seminary, and in 1955 he was sent to work in the parish of Youtangkou as the pastoral vicar. On 4 April 1955 Hu was arrested, and then imprisoned for three years in the detention center of Guizhou Province. In 1958, he was sentenced to ten years of forced labor and re-education in three different factories of Guizhou Province. At the end of his sentence he was sent to semi-detention in a factory in Fuquan, China, in southern Guizhou Province. Later, he was sent to teach in the theological seminary of Chengdu, China, in the province of Sichuan Archdiocese. Four years later he was removed from his position, and returned to Guizhou Province, where he was appointed pastor of Duyun, Dushan, Fuquan, Tuanbo, and Wen'an. Hu was secretly ordained a Bishop in 1987 by Bishop Peter Joseph Fan Xueyan, the Bishop of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Baoding; the Vatican later approved the ordination. In 1999, at the age of almost 80, Bishop Hu sustained a leg injury from which he never really fully recovered."

  "text" : "Aklilu Lemma (died 1997) was an Ethiopian physician. He was awarded the Right Livelihood Award in 1989, jointly with Legesse Wolde-Yohannes, for their work and discoveries on how to prevent the parasitic disease bilharzia.Bilharzia, or schistosomiasis, is a debilitating and eventually fatal illness, which afflicts more than 200 million people in 74 countries of Africa, Asia and Latin America. Present therapies for bilharzia, and molluscicides to kill the snail-carriers of the disease, are far too expensive for the communities that need them. In 1964 a young Ethiopian doctor, Aklilu Lemma, discovered that suds from the fruit of a common African plant, the endod or soapberry, which African women have used as soap for centuries, act as a potent molluscicide. To follow up this discovery, Lemma in 1966 established the Institute of Pathobiology in Addis Ababa University, and for the next 10 years he directed a team to carry out systematic research on endod. He was joined in this work in 1974 by Legesse Wolde-Yohannes. The discovery seemed to offer no less than a cheap, locally-controllable means of eradicating a disease that is the second greatest scourge (after malaria) in the Third World. And Lemma's early research confirmed this potential. Yet progress in making this endod product available to the people who need it has been extremely slow, for reasons that expose some of the biases and failings of the international medical community. In the last few years, however, Lemma's and Wolde-Yohannes' persistence and the support of key scientists and donors in the West has opened the door to the necessary laboratory and field trials. An endod research and application network has also been established, linking five African countries, and the plant is being grown and used for experimental control of schistosomiasis. Before his death in 1997, Lemma and colleagues established the Endod Foundation to serve as an umbrella for all endod-related work. Following collaboration with Lemma, the University of Toledo, USA, was granted a US patent on an endod-based molluscicide intended to control the zebra mussels which have recently invaded American lakes and caused extensive damage to water supplies. This has opened a major new hope for marketing and exporting endod as a cash crop. Legesse Wolde-Yohannes has a doctorate in Horticultural Science from the Technical University of Hannover, Germany.

This work created a scandal and led to the arrest of Radicati and his translator. The Dissertation upon Death is referenced by George Berkeley in his 1733 Theory of Vision Vindicated, section 5. There Radicati's work is used as an example of a free-thinker explicitly adopting the radical views attributed to the free-thinkers by Berkeley in his 1732 dialogue Alciphron, and so to defend Berkeley against the charge of attacking a strawman."

  "text" : "Andrew Fairfoul (c 1606-1663) was the first post-Restoration Archbishop of Glasgow, from 1661 until his death in November 1663. He became Chancellor of Glasgow University after his consecration as Archbishop. Fairfoul was the son of a minister from Anstruther and studied at the University of St Andrews. He became chaplain to the Earl of Rothes and then Minister of North Leith and later of Dunse. He was nominated for the Archbishopric by King Charles II and consecrated in London on 15 December 1661.On 19 April 1662 Fairfoul made his public entry into Glasgow accompanied by the Earl of Glencairn, the Lord Chancellor of Scotland who was his predecessor as Chancellor of the University. The University's historian James Coutts refers to him as \"a man of boisterous mirth and careless life\",but quotes the recollection of Principal Robert Baillie that Fairfoul preached \"soberly and well\" on his first Sunday in the city. The Earl, the Archbishop and their entourage dined at the University the day after this first sermon, and the meal is said to have cost more than £200. The Archbishop was heavily involved in energetic attempts by the Episcopalian authorities to root out Covenanters and other dissenters. A committee of the Privy Council met in the fore-hall of the University on 1 October 1662 to address the problem of ministers refusing to recognise the rights of patrons and bishops to present ministers, and many ministers were removed from their parishes. Fairfoul died in November 1663 on his way to Edinburgh and was buried in the Abbey Church at Holyrood."

  "text" : "At young age the daughter of Arnold Eckenstein-Marfort, merchant in Grellinger street in Basel, was already inspired by the wish to help others in need. Under the patronage of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) she established an office in Basel with the intention to repatriate children in need from occupied Belgium. Among the numerous documents and letters that passed through her hands, those of anxious parents got her attention. During the summer campaign of 1914 multiple parents were surprised by the rapid advance of the Germans and got separated from their children, cut off by the frontline. With immence dedication and patience and at risk of her life, she succeeded in repatriating - each time again - children from occupied Belgium to Switzerland and then to the unoccupied zones of Belgium or France where they were reunited with their parents. Even large groups of children made it out of occupied Belgium thanks to this courageous woman. Her ashes are buried at the Wolfgottesacker cemetery in Basel. Source: Basler Zeitung, 30. January 1980"

  "text" : "Amanda Louise Staveley (born 11 April 1973 near Ripon, North Yorkshire, England) is a British businesswoman notable chiefly for her connections with Middle Eastern investors. In 2008 Staveley played a prominent role in the investment of £7.3 billion in Barclays by the ruling families of Abu Dhabi and Qatar, and by the Qatari sovereign wealth fund. Staveley’s firm, PCP Capital Partners, acted for Sheikh Mansour Bin Zayed Al Nahyan of the Abu Dhabi royal family, who invested £3.5 billion to control 16 per cent of the bank. The deal was reported to have earned PCP Capital Partners a commission of £110 million, which, after paying advisers, represented a profit of £40 million. Staveley was also involved in Sheik Mansour's high-profile purchase of Manchester City Football Club in September 2008. Staveley, who once described herself as \"a dealmaker at heart\", told The Guardian newspaper in 2008: \"I'm just grateful to have been given the opportunities I've had so far. It's not about money — it wouldn't matter if I was making £8 million or £200 million. I just want to go to bed at night and say I've done a good job.\""

He began his career in national politics when he was elected MP for East Makira in the August 2010 general election, standing as a candidate for the Democratic Party. The Democrats obtained thirteen seats out of fifty, making them by far the largest party in the National Parliament, but their leader Steve Abana failed to obtain the support of a parliamentary majority after the election, and thus became Leader of the Opposition to Prime Minister Danny Philip's government. Appointing his Shadow Cabinet, Abana made Ghiro Shadow Minister for Provincial Government and Institutional strengthening. At some point, Ghiro defected to the parliamentary majority, becoming a government backbencher, despite being a member of the main opposition party. He subsequently defected back to the Opposition, accompanying several government ministers, on August 20, 2011. When those ministers rejoined the government the following month, he followed suit on February 21. When Gordon Darcy Lilo replaced Philip as Prime Minister in November 2011, he appointed Ghiro as Minister for Public Service. On or around 1 March 2012, Lilo reshuffled Ghiro to the position of Minister for Fisheries, whereby he exchanged portfolios with Bradley Tovosia."

  "text" : "Arthur Glick \"Art\" Kunkin (born 1928) is an American journalist, political organizer, machinist and New Age esotericist best known as the founding publisher and editor of the Los Angeles Free Press. Born in New York City, he attended the prestigious Bronx High School of Science and the New School for Social Research, eventually becoming a tool and die maker and joining the Trotskyite movement as an organizer for the Socialist Workers Party, where he was business manager of the SWP paper, The Militant. Beginning in the late 1940s Kunkin was associated with C.L.R. James and the radical Marxist Johnson-Forest Tendency. During the 1950s he was Los Angeles editor of their journals Correspondence and News & Letters, while working as a master machinist and tool and die maker for Ford and General Motors. During this period a number of theoreticians and organizers of the Johnson-Forest trend (including Raya Dunayevskaya, Martin Glaberman, Grace Lee Boggs and James Boggs) were concentrated in the auto industry in Detroit, where they worked to recruit black workers and gain influence inside the auto workers' unions. In 1962 Kunkin left General Motors to go back to college and work toward a graduate degree. Soon afterward he had his first experience with a local newspaper on the staff of a Mexican-American paper in Los Angeles called the East L.A. Almanac. \"For the first time in my life I was writing about garbage collection and all kinds of community problems,\" he later recalled. Meanwhile, he was also doing political radio commentaries for KPFK Pacifica Radio while serving as the Southern California district leader of the Socialist Party. In May 1964 he produced the first trial issue of the LA Free Press as a one-shot distributed at the Renaissance Pleasure Faire and May Market, a fund-raising event for KPFK. The response was favorable enough for Kunkin to start publishing the Freep (as it came to be called) on a regular basis starting in July. The core group of volunteers and supporters who got involved in the paper included people from KPFK, the bohemian crowd that hung out at the Papa Bach bookstore, and The Fifth Estate, a Sunset Strip coffee house which provided office space for the Freep in its basement. The paper soon became a nerve center of the burgeoning hippie scene. The atmosphere at the Freep was described by a reporter for Esquire: \"Kids, dogs, cats, barefoot waifs, teeny-boppers in see-through blouses, assorted losers, strangers, Indian chiefs wander in and out, while somewhere a radio plays endless rock music and people are loudly paged over an intercom system. It's all very friendly and rather charming and ferociously informal.\" Launched on a shoestring budget, the Free Press struggled for years. By 1969 circulation had exploded to 100,000 copies, but legal problems stemming from publication of a list of names of undercover drug agents put the Freep in a precarious financial position just as it was expanding its operations to include a printing plant, a typesetting firm and a small chain of bookstores. Underpaid staff members left in two waves of defections to form the competing newspapers Tuesday's Child and The Staff. By 1972 Kunkin and the paper were deep in debt to the very pornographers whose advertising had been the source of the paper's profits, and Kunkin lost control of the paper and was fired, rehired, and fired again, as the paper spiraled slowly into oblivion, paralleling the nationwide decline of the underground press. Kunkin's post-Free Press career began with a stint as a professor of journalism at California State University, Northridge, followed by several years as president of the Philosophical Research Society in Los Angeles, an esoteric mystical group founded by Manly Palmer Hall. This was followed by an apprenticeship in alchemy at the Paracelsus Research Society in Salt Lake City, where he edited their journal Essentia. He later became a lecturer in alchemy and other New Age topics at the Institute for Mentalphysics retreat center near Joshua Tree, and a columnist for the Desert Valley Star."

  "text" : "Alexandru Penciu (born Bucharest, 1 November 1932) is a former Romanian rugby union player and coach whose role was fullback. Amongst the best players of Romania, he was nicknamed \"Alexander the Great\" (Alexandru cel Mare) in his home country. Penciu started his youth career at Petrolul Ploieşti, in 1946/47.He moved soon to PPT Bucharest, where he played from 1948/49 to 1950/51, and was promoted to the first category.He was assigned to CAA, later called CSA Steaua Bucureşti (Rugby), the Romanian Army team, in 1952/53, where he would stay until 1968/69. He won 5 titles of the Romanian Championship, in 1952/53, 1953/54, 1960/61, 1962/63 and 1963/64. He was allowed to move to Rugby Rovigo Delta, in Italy, in 1969/70, where he would finish his player career in 1973/74, aged 41 years old. He took charge at Rugby Rovigo as player-coach at 1970/71, being the top scorer of the Italian Championship twice, in 1970/71 and 1971/72. Romania was then living his first \"Golden Era\" of rugby and was often considered the best European team, outside the Five Nations Championship.Penciu would be one of the most emblematic players of this era, winning 34 full caps for Romania and scoring 2 conversions, 7 penalties and 4 drop goals, 37 points in aggregate. His first game was at Brno on 20 April 1955, a 3-0 win over Czechoslovakia in a friendly match.Penciu played in the first ever win of Romania over France, by 11-5, on 5 June 1960, in Bucharest, in a friendly game where he scored 1 conversion and 2 drop goals. The large crowd of 55,000 at the Dinamo Bucharest Stadium is a remainder of the popularity of Romanian rugby union in this time. His last international game was also with France, in the 11-3 loss in Nantes for the European Nations Cup, at 10 December 1967, where he scored a penalty. It was still the second consecutive 2nd place of Romania in the competition, losing the title in a row to France, then the only continental European side at the Five Nations Championship. After finishing his player career in Rugby Rovigo, he would be a coach for Montréal, in Canada (1974/5-1977/78), then for Oyonnax Rugby, in France (1978/79-1979/80). Returning to Italy, he would coach Mantova, Villadose and Belluno."

  "text" : "Nawab Abdul Ghani Saheb (1843-1897) was a notable figure in the western Indian city of Kolhapur, located in the state of Maharashtra. He is described as having been a very enterprising trader and businessman, investing his time and wealth in developmental activities. In addition to his entrepreneurial life, Sahab engaged in services for both his community and his home country. Nawab Saheb was also involved with the establishment of educational opportunities for his fellow citizens, and in the year 1290 Hijri (1873 CE), he established a \"dini madrasa\" (an Islamic school, imparting education in Arabic, Islamic Studies, Persian and History) that was subsequently named the Madrasa Nawabia Islamia. Nawab Saheb was a prolific businessman and was eventually awarded a Certificate by the Resident State of Hyderabad on behalf of the British monarchy, then under the reign of Queen Victoria. Three historic convocations (Ijlas-e-Dastarbandi) of the Madrasa took place. \n* The first one was in the lifetime of Nawab Abdul Ghani, in the year 1311 Hijri (1893 CE). \n* The second convocation was conducted by Nawab Mohammed Abdul Samad (died in 1942) the elder son of Nawab Mohammed Abdul Ghani Saheb. \n* The third convocation took place under the reign of Nawab Mohammed Abdul Quader (died in 1943) the younger son of Nawab Abdul Ghani Saheb. Over the years, the number of students in the resident Madrasa declined. In 1950, Shaikh-ul-Hadees Maulana Abid Ali Wajid Al-Husimi Bhopali rejuvenated and renamed the Madrasa as Madrasa Anwarul Uloom. To date the Madrasa is imparting education. His younger son, Nawab Mohammed Abdul Quader, carried on the developmental activities his father had started. Nawab Mohammed Abdul Ghani Sahab established a separate high school for girls. He also established a hospital and the post office (pin code: 444802). Each of these institutions has grown over time, and even today are the principal institutions of the region."

Sepinwall began writing about television with reviews of NYPD Blue while attending the University of Pennsylvania, which led to his job at The Star-Ledger. In 2007, immediately after The Sopranos ended, series creator David Chase granted his sole interview to Sepinwall. In 2009, Sepinwall openly urged NBC not to cancel the action-comedy series Chuck, and NBC Entertainment co-president Ben Silverman partially credited Sepinwall for the show's revival. Slate.com said Sepinwall \"changed the nature of television criticism\" and called him the \"acknowledged king of the form\" with regard to weekly episode recaps and reviews. Sepinwall and television critic Dan Fienberg hosted a podcast at HitFix called Firewall & Iceberg, in which they discussed and reviewed television until October 2015."

He began writing in 1931, after retiring from work and relocating to Montevecchia, in Brianza, and was later a prolific author. One of his prominent works is On soldaa papà (\"A soldier father\", 1936), inspired by On papà soldaa (\"A father soldier\", 1935) by Giannino Sessa. While both works are based on the theme of a girl whose father dies in World War I, Negri's version is crudely anti-rhetoric (the orphan girl prostitutes herself to make a living) and conveys pacifist values that openly contrasted those promoted in Italy by the Fascist regime of the time. Another prominent work by Negri was an adaptation of Carlo Collodi's Adventures of Pinocchio in verses, based on the poet's vision of Pinocchio as an \"odysseic\" and highly symbolical novel. In 1955, Negri also contributed to the realization of the Fontana a Pinocchio, a statuary fountain in Milan dedicated to Collodi's character, writing a line to be inscribed on the pedestal of Pinocchio's statue, namely: \"E tu che mi guardi sei ben sicuro d'aver domato il burattino che vive in te?\""

She was inspired by the late \"Bodufen Valhugey Seedhi\", a famous poet and Faiza's maternal uncle. \"Thiththibe\" as Faiza called him, made her recite his poems when they were completed. During the 1950s, Faiza started showcasing her work, during which time, late Mohamed Amin Didi, the first President of the Maldives, created the \"Lhen Veringe Gulzaar\" (Garden of Dhivehi Poets). Aminath Faiza was the \"DAISY MAA\"; the Daisy flower of Maldivian poetry. Since then, she has published her poems and other works in magazines and newspapers, and has had compilations published in books throughout her career. She wrote poetry on many different topics including romance, social issues, religion, national unity, and national occasions. Faiza served on the advisory body of the Rayyithunge Muthagaddim Party, the first political party founded in the Maldives by late president Mohamed Ameed Didi. She worked as the deputy headmistress of the former Madrasat–ul Saniyya school. Faiza also worked for Maldives Center for Historical and Linguistic Research, during which she helped to compile the Maldivian Dictionary. In recognition of her contribution to Maldivian poetry, she was awarded the National Award of Recognition in 1980, then a National Award of Honour in 1996. She penned her last poem on the Golden Jubilee of Iskandhar School on 5 February 2011. On February 25, 2011 after suffering a stroke, she died at the age of 86 while being treated at Indira Gandhi Memorial Hospital in Malé, Republic of Maldives, at 06:05hrs. Her resident was Galolhu .Daisymaage, Male'. Funeral Prayer was held at Masjid Al Sultan Mohamed Thankurufaanu Al Auzam following Friday Prayer. She was buried at the Aa Sahara cemetery in Male in a ceremony attended by political and cultural dignitaries. Faiza was survived by three children, Ahmed Abbas, Aminath Abbas and Mohamed Hilmy.

  "text" : "Amanda Jane Hooper (née Christie, 1980 – 22 February 2011) was a female professional field hockey player from New Zealand. She died in one of the office buildings that collapsed in the February 2011 Christchurch earthquake at age 30. Amanda Christie was born in Southland in 1980 and grew up in Waikaia on her family's farm. She was head girl at Gore High School in 1998; her motivation for success stemmed from her father's death four years earlier. She was married to Richard Hooper and had two girls with him. She was a member of the national women's squad The Black Sticks from 2001 to 2003, with a total of 40 caps. In 2003 she was nominated for World Junior Player of the Year. She participated in the 2002 Commonwealth Games in Manchester, England, where the New Zealand women came fourth. She competed in the 2002 Women's Hockey World Cup where New Zealand came eleventh. Locally, she played 55 games for Canterbury, and was a member of Carlton Redcliffs. Hooper lived in Rolleston and worked for Marac Finance as an account manager. Her company was based at the PGC building in the Christchurch Central City that collapsed in the 2011 Christchurch earthquake. On 11 March 2011, Christchurch police confirmed that Hooper was one of the victims of the earthquake. Ian Rutledge, her coach for two years, described her as having a \"warm and caring nature\" and \"one of the hardest-training athletes he had come across in his coaching career\". Her former team, Carlton Redcliffs, awards the Amanda Hooper Award and has retired her number from their women's team in her memory."

Her first novel Ahlam wa Nabilah was published from Cairo in 1997 and she has published several more novels since. More broadly, she has played a major role in the women's rights movement in Yemen. She helped to establish the Yemeni Women's Association in the 1970s and also participated in the US-based Arab Women's Council.

The blast also killed a renter of the building who was not part of the plot and injured dozens of others.  In the wake of Caron's death, some 5,000 mourners gathered in New York's Union Square, where anarchist leaders Alexander Berkman and Rebecca Edelson among others spoke in memory of those who died."

He was born in Dale House, Coalbrookdale, Shropshire the son of Edmund Darby, a member of the Darby ironmaking family and Lucy (née Burlingham) Darby. He was a great-nephew of Abraham Darby III. In 1830, he and his brother Alfred took over the management of the Horsehay foundry, one of several foundries owned by the family business, and set about re-establishing the Coalbrookdale Company's reputation by investing in new technology there for the manufacture of wrought iron. In 1844, he became a major shareholder in the Ebbw Vale ironworks in South Wales. After a series of family disagreements, he resigned his management of the Coalbrookdale Company in 1849, and, in 1851, bought Stoke Court near Stoke Poges in Buckinghamshire, and moved to live there. He also acquired property at Treberfydd in Breconshire, Wales. He acted as a Justice of the Peace in both counties, and, in 1853, was appointed High Sheriff of Buckinghamshire. He also became a member of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers. Although born into a notable Quaker family, Darby joined the Church of England and paid for the building of Holy Trinity church in Coalbrookdale between 1850 and 1854. In 1851 a new ecclesiastical parish was formed out of Ironbridge and Little Dawley, and Darby became patron of the new benefice, with the right to nominate the parish priest. In 1853 he married his cousin Matilda Frances, a daughter of Francis Darby. He died at Treberfydd on 28 November 1878, aged 74, and was buried at the church he had had built in Coalbrookdale. After his death, his widow became patron of the church benefice and lived until 1902. After that, the patronage remained with the owners of the Sunniside estate until 1959, when it was transferred to the Bishop of Hereford."

He worked there for several years in various commercial stores before returning to Hadhramaut in 1962. However his stay in Al-Mukalla, the capital of Hadhramaut, proved short-lived and he went back to Aden in 1963, working as manager of a well-known commercial store for the next 33 years. In 1997, he tried one more time to settle down in Al-Mukalla but this attempt too proved unsuccessful. He went back to Aden for the last time to live out the final years of his life. Bawazir was a prolific author and worked across a range of genres including short stories, novels, plays, children's books, and autobiography, not to mention shorter journalistic pieces for newspapers and magazines. As early as the 1950s, he was writing a column in Angham (Melodies) magazine. His first published short story entitled \"Hikaya\" (A Tale) came out in 1961 in the pages of Al-Taliyaa, an Al-Mukalla newspaper. Another of his stories for Al-Taliyaa entitled \"The Devil's Tree\" was eventually included in the national school curriculum. Al-Taliyaa also published his first play Al-Muhakama (The Trial) in 1962. His works heavily reflected the turbulent social and political scene of the 1960s. His first collection of short stories was called Al-Rimal al-Dhahabiya (The Golden Sands) and was published in 1965, bringing together stories that had previously appeared in various newspapers in Al-Mukalla and Aden. His second collection was called Thawrat al-Burkan (The Eruption, 1968). He published several more short story collections throughout his career, the last one coming out in 1999. Bawazir is considered one of the pioneers of the short story format in Yemen. His many other books included novels, journalistic compilations, collections of plays and books for children. He also wrote a three-volume autobiography that was released posthumously in 2007. Bawazir died on October 7, 2004 at the age of 66 and was buried in Aden. Bawazir's work has been translated into Italian and was included in a 2009 anthology on Yemeni literature called Perle dello Yemen."

In 2000, al-Razihi's poem \"A Summer Night Dream\" landed him in trouble with religious fundamentalists. An orchestrated campaign culminated in his fleeing the country to seek safety in the Netherlands. He returned some time later. Razihi's comments on the popular drug khat, which first appeared in an article in the newspaper Yemen Times in 1993, have also been quoted widely: \"Qat...is the opium of our people. It is the green Imam who rules over our republic. It is the key for everything and it is central to all our social occasions. It is the unexplainable that explains everything\". Al-Razihi's poetry appeared in translation in a 1988 anthology of modern Arabian literature. His short stories have been translated by the Australian writer Eva Sallis and appeared in the literary journal Heat in 2005."

  "text" : "Anthony Bushby Bacon (also known as Anthony Bushby or Anthony Smith or, occasionally, Anthony Bacon II; and, as a child, William Addison) (1772 - 11 August 1827) was a British industrialist turned landed gentleman. Anthony was the eldest of the five illegitimate children of Anthony Bacon, the prominent Welsh ironmaster, by Mary Bushby of Gloucestershire. All were still minors when their father died. In his father's will, Anthony Junior was left his main estate at Cyfarthfa in Glamorgan, including the ironworks, and also half of the nearby Hirwaun works. His three younger brothers and single sister also received shares in their father's property. However, upon coming of age, Anthony seems to have had little desire to continue his father's business and he leased the Cyfarthfa ironworks to Richard Crawshay. In 1806, he sold his share of the Hirwaun works to his brother, Thomas, and, with the proceeds, he bought the Mathews' estate at Aberaman, also in Glamorgan, where he lived when in Wales. However, he later also held lands in Berkshire. About 1811, he rented Benham Park in Speen. He later purchased Elcot Park in Kintbury. When he died in 1827, he was buried in the family vault at Shaw-cum-Donnington near his brother's home at Donnington Castle House. Anthony's Aberaman estate later came into the possession of Crawshay Bailey. He married Elizabeth, the daughter and sole heiress of Richard Ramsbottom MP of Woodside House at Old Windsor in Berkshire, and they had eleven children together: Gen. Anthony, Col. Charles, George William, Richard Thomas, Philip, Elizabeth (who married Thomas Thornhill), Mary, Fanny, Emily (who married Thomas Peers Williams, Father of the House of Commons), Henry and William."

Shortly thereafter, he was invited by Alain Ducasse to create a special seasonal menu at his Paris restaurant Spoon Food & Wine, the first American to receive such an honor. Sosa owned a sandwich shop named 'Xie Xie' (meaning thank you in Mandarin) for a short time, but it is now closed. Sosa would return to compete on Top Chef All-Stars. He was eliminated in seventh place. In March 2011, Sosa opened Social Eatz in Manhattan's Midtown East, serving American standards, spiced up using Asian flavors and techniques. In March 2013, Social Eatz closed. In 2012, Sosa opened Añejo Tequileria in Manhattan's Hell's Kitchen, serving unique tequilas and original takes on traditional Mexican tastes. His restaurant Poppy Den in Las Vegas closed its doors after two years in August 2014. In January 2015 Sosa released a new cookbook that was co-written with Angie Martine entitled, Healthy Latin Eating: Our Favorite Family Recipes Remixed. The cookbook features Latin family recipes from the pair that have been changed to be healthier and prepared as lighter versions of the traditional dishes. Sosa currently lives in New York City."

  "text" : "Alain Montpetit (September 24, 1950 – July 15, 1987) was a television and radio personality in Quebec, as well as an actor. Montpetit was a native of Westmount, where he was born and where he grew up. His grandfather was Édouard Montpetit, founder of the Faculty of Social Sciences at the University of Montreal. He was the son of André Montpetit, a prominent labour lawyer, founding chair of the board of the Institut de recherches cliniques de Montréal and a judge of the Quebec Superior Court, chairing the Commission of Inquiry into Working Conditions in the Post Office 1966. He studied at the National Theatre School of Canada and UCLA. During his days in the United States, he worked at KMET/Los Angeles, California and ran a pirate radio station near the Canada–United States border. On his return to Montreal, in the early 1970s he became a full-time airstaffer at CKGM. After that stint at the Top 40 AM outlet, he would take the offer of being the host of a radio show on CKMF-FM at the start of the fashion for disco. Thanks to the station's emphasis on disco, it went from 48,000 listeners to around 500,000. Montpetit was also hired to host a disco dance show on Montréal's private French-language TV station, Télé-Métropole. According to François Roy, a friend and work colleague at the time, Montpetit did not particularly like disco music. However, he took advantage of the opportunity and was known as Montreal's \"King of Disco\", accepting sizable payment in cash or drugs from various club owners for spending time at their establishments. Although Montpetit was married to classical ballet dancer Nanci Moretti and had an infant daughter, he had brief encounters with many other women. He had a more serious affair with Paule Charbonneau. One of Charbonneau’s friends was Marie-Josée Saint-Antoine, a model from Montreal with the Elite agency, who was to move to New York City. On a visit back to Quebec in June 1982, Saint-Antoine convinced her friend to break with Montpetit and communicated this decision to him. Saint-Antoine was stabbed to death, on 17 June 1982, upon her return to New York City. Strong circumstantial evidence ties Montpetit to this murder. Among other things, he gave an alibi to police which, much later, was revealed to be false. A witness saw a man who looked like him with Saint-Antoine shortly before she was killed. Upon a reinvestigation of the case years later, two women also described to New York police how Montpetit had confessed the crime to them. Douglas Coco Leopold, who also worked for CKMF and was a prominent disco radio and TV personality, accused Montpetit of the murder on the air. Montpetit sued Leopold for defamation and the case was settled out of court. In June 1987, Montpetit went on air while he was evidently under the influence, as he had on some other occasions. The manager of the station had to have him physically removed from the studio. Montpetit continued to react violently when he was told that he was fired. He travelled to Washington, D.C. to join his mistress Jackie Lee, a disc jockey. He was found dead of an overdose in a Washington hotel room (at thirty-six years of age). A fictionalised version of Montpetit, played by Patrick Huard, is one of the central characters in the 2010 Canadian film Funkytown."

  "text" : "Andrew Landenberger (born 1968) is an Australian competitive sailor and Olympic medalist. He won a silver medal in the Tornado class at the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, together with Mitch Booth. Andrew Landenberger started building sails in Australia under his own label in 1987. The first sails were produced on his parents living room floor with a sewing machine he bought for $50. By 1989 he claimed his first clean sweep winning the State, National and World Championships in the International Moth Class. Despite spending several years obtaining a Bachelor of Economics Degree, Andrew’s desire to build fast sails always drove him to devote full attention to sailing and the technology side of sail making. By 1996 Andrew had won an Olympic Silver Medal in the Tornado Class together with Mitch Booth. Since then the full energy has been devoted to sail making. In 2001 Andrew made the decision to move with his family to Germany. Landenberger One Design has developed into a business of 8 staff specializing mostly in One Design Classes. The production is headed up by Felix Egner who has been with the company since 2004. Despite little time for sailing Andrew and Felix have sailed two regattas together in the past two years \"Just for Fun\" but managed to finish 1st in the 2005 Topcat K1 World Championships and 3rd in the 2006 F18 World Championships. Andrew is currently spending time sailing in the Star class to develop a new range of sail for the loft. Both the development process and the production techniques are heavily orientated around computer software. Sail making has moved on from an art to an exact science. On average the process we adopt to develop sails in new classes brings us to a very competitive product within three prototypes. This is far quicker than most other One Design lofts can manage who often make a not stop progression of random changes searching for any hint of improvement in performance.In 2007 Andrew build a second home in Australia on the banks of the Clarence River. Here he has an extensive design loft where he can develop sails and escape the European winter. Although he spends more time these days designing sails he still remains one of the world's leading multihull sailors. Landenberger is a descendent of the noted nineteenth-century sculler Michael Rush."

He served 34 years with the Pueblo of Isleta, and was known for defending the Indians. Following academic studies and years of military service, in 1887 Docher traveled to the United States, where he was first assigned to the Cathedral of Santa Fe for a few years and was ordained. He worked briefly at Taos, but served the Pueblo of Isleta in New Mexico for 34 years until his death. In the US, his first name became Americanized as Anton.

  "text" : "Arnold Perlmutter (1859–1953) was a composer for Yiddish theatre, born in Zlotshev, Galitsia. He moved to Lemburg where he received both a religious and a secular education in Polish, Ukrainian, and German. He sang with then-famous hazzan Borekh Shor's chorus until his voice changed, then became a klezmer, playing bass and then violin and directing and composing for the Harmonia orchestra, which in 1889 was taken into I. B. Gimpel's Yiddish theater in Lemburg; he wrote the music for the operetta Rabbi Akiva and his students. and Der Spanisher Tsigayner (The Spanish Gypsy). In 1891 Abraham Goldfaden came to Lemburg to stage his Meshiakh tsaytn (Messiah times) and Dos tsente gebot (The Tenth Commandment); Perlmutter orchestrated and reworked Goldfaden's collected musical numbers and composed new ones for his productions. He then toured with the Treytler and Yuvelir troupes throughout Galitsia, Romania (1893-1895) and Russia (1899). From Chernovitz, Bukovina, in 1900 Professor Moyshe Horvitz (Hurwitz) took the whole troup to America. Perlmutter met his longtime collaborator Herman Wohl in New York's Windsor Theater and they wrote for dozens of Hurwitz's operettas as well as Di Almoneh (The Widow) and A mentsh zol men zayn (One should be a righteous person) by Anshel Shor. In 1906 Perlmutter and Wohl composed the music for a romantic drama in English, The Shepherd King; in 1909, Boris Thomashefsky's Dos Pintele Yid and Di sheyne Amerikanerin; and for scores of other historical operettas of the Second Avenue Yiddish Theater District theaters through the early years of the twentieth century. After the partnership dissolved Perlmutter worked alone, composing for Morris Schwartz's production in 1920 of I. L. Peretz's Goldene keyt (Golden chain). In 1922 he contracted with the Lennox Theater in the Bronx (directors Nathan Goldberg and Jacob Jacobs). He wrote the music for dozens of productions until he retired from theater in 1930."

In 2009, her page on the directory site \"Chu-Boh\" gave her height and figure as \"160 B87 W60 H88\" (5 ft 3 in, 34-24-35). She regularly appears on the front page of popular titles, such as Young Animal and Weekly Young Jump. The lines between gravure idols and pop idols are very blurred, and aside from modelling she has gone on to forge a career as a pop idol. The name Ai means \"Love\" in Japanese and often titles of her productions are puns coming from that double meaning."

  "text" : "Andrew Jackson Merchant (December 23, 1831 – November 20, 1899) was an American Methodist minister. Merchant was born on his father's farm in Napoli, New York, on December 23, 1831. He was the grandson of Truman Merchant, a Revolutionary War soldier and cousin of Vice-President Aaron Burr, and was descended from Captain John Marchant, who died along with Sir Francis Drake in his 1595 campaign. A teacher in his early years, Andrew Merchant enrolled in the first class at Allegheny College in Meadville, Pennsylvania, and graduated in 1857 with Latin Honors. He married Frances C. Peck that same year, and was admitted into the Erie Conference as a Methodist preacher. A so-called \"circuit rider,\" he preached in many locales across western Pennsylvania, southwestern New York State, and northern Ohio, including charges in Punxsutawney, Cleveland, and Meadville, where he died November 20, 1899. Rev. Merchant sat on the Board of Control of Allegheny College, was a presiding elder and delegate to the General Conference of the Methodist Church in 1896, and served as treasurer of the Erie Conference Educational Association. He was the father of Frank W. Merchant, a noted newspaperman in Pittsburgh between 1898 and 1931."

  "text" : "Avrom Reyzen (Abraham Reisen) (1876 – 1953) was a Yiddish writer, poet and editor, and the elder brother of the Yiddishist Zalman Reisen. Reyzen was born in Koidanov (Minsk, eastern Belorussia). Supported by Yaknehoz (pseudonym of Yeshaye Nisn Hakoyen Goldberg), while in his early teens Reyzen sent articles to Dos Yudishes folks-blat in St Petersburg, Russia. He corresponded with Jacob Dinezon and I. L. Peretz. In 1891, they published Reyzen’s poem Ven dos lebn is farbitert (When Life Is Embittered) in their Di yudishe bibliotek (The Yiddish Library). His first story, A kapore der noz abi a goldener zeyger mit 300 rubl nadn (Damn the Nose, As Long As There Is a Dowry of a Watch and 300 Rubles) was published in Vilna in 1892. In 1895, he joined the Russian army, serving in a musicians’ unit until 1899. In addition to writing for the Zionist Der yud, in 1900 Reyzen created the literary anthology Dos tsvantsikste yorhundert (The Twentieth Century) which included work by I. L. Peretz, Hersh Dovid Nomberg, David Pinski, and others. A believer in the socialist ideology, Reyzen wrote for the Bund, sometimes under the pseudonym M. Vilner, during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. In 1902, Reyzen published a poetry collection, Tsayt lider (Poems of the Time), and in 1903 issued a book of stories, Ertseylungen un bilder (Stories and Scenes). He wrote for Der fraynd and Der tog in St Petersburg. A founder (with his brother Zalman, Chaim Zhitlovsky, I.L. Peretz, and his close friends Scholem Asch and Hersch Dovid Nomberg) of Yiddishism, he took part in the Czernowitz Yiddish Language Conference of 1908 at which Yiddish was proclaimed a national language of the Jews. In 1910, he began the Warsaw literary weekly Eyropeyishe literatur (European Literature) and another called Fraye erd (Free Land). In early 1911, Reyzen moved to New York City and contributed to Forverts and Tsukunft. His Troyerike motivn gevidmet oreme layt (Sad Motifs Dedicated to the Poor) was published (at Sholem Aleichem's recommendation) in Philadelphia’s Shtot tsaytung. From 1929 he worked exclusively for Forverts, where he wrote a story each week, without a break. In 1935 he completed the three-volume autobiographical Epizodn fun mayn lebn (Episodes From My Life). Irving Howe wrote about Reyzen: \"The miracle of a Reisen is not that he derives from the people but that he remains at harmony with them... Precisely because he regards being a Jew as a \"natural\" condition of life, beyond query or challenge, his poems and stories take his culture utterly for granted: they neither explain nor justify\" At his death in 1953, Reyzen was eulogized: \"There are many Yiddish writers who owe their success to Reisen's encouragement. For years he published and edited, under great sacrifices, Yiddish journals with the primary aim of providing a platform for young, struggling writers... He had no arrogance, no pretensions and no personal vanity.\""

  "text" : "Alexander de Balscot, also known as Alexander Petit (died 1400) was one of the leading Irish clerics of the late fourteenth century, who held the offices of Bishop of Ossory, Bishop of Meath, Treasurer of Ireland and Lord Chancellor of Ireland. He was born at Balscote in Oxfordshire; Nicholas de Balscote, Chief Baron of the Irish Exchequer 1313-1319, was probably a cousin of an earlier generation. He is first heard of in Ireland in 1358; he became vicar of Dungarvan in 1359, Bishop of Ossory in 1371 and Bishop of Meath in 1386. He was criticised for spending large sums of money to influence his election to Ossory, but received a royal pardon for the transgression. He was appointed Treasurer of Ireland in 1372 and again in 1376; he acted as Justiciar of Ireland in 1379. Richard II appointed him Lord Chancellor in 1386, and a key member of the Irish government of the pre-eminent royal favourite, Robert de Vere, Duke of Ireland. Following de Vere's downfall after the Battle of Radcot Bridge in 1388, de Balscot was dismissed from office, along with mostof his colleagues, including John Stanley, the  Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, James Butler, 3rd Earl of Ormond, the Governor, and Sir Robert Crull, the Lord High Treasurer of Ireland. Later that year, King Richard II reappointed all of them to their old positions. De Balscot later also acted as Chancellor and Justiciar at intervals until his death in 1400. He died at his official residence at Ardbraccan and was buried in Trim at St. Mary's Abbey. Elrington Ball describes him as a man of great wisdom and learning; although he was in disfavour for parts of his career he was always restored to a position of influence, as his advice was found to be indispensable. O'Flanagan similarly refers to his extraordinary reputation for wisdom and learning."

  "text" : "Alfred Basel (23 March 1876 – 24 January 1920) was an Austrian painter and etcher. Born in Vienna to a factory owner, Basel studied at the Wiener Kunstgewerbeschule under Felician von Myrbach between 1892 and 1898. He was a reserve officer during the First World War, serving with the rank of Oberleutnant in the Fourth Army on the Galician front from March 1915. In the fall he fell ill and was declared unfit for military service. By November he was a war artist serving the Kriegspressequartier. In 1916 he was on the Vistula, in the Carpathians, in Albania, on the Isonzo, and in the Ukraine. It was his artistic breakthrough. In 1919, at the winter exhibition of the Wiener Künstlerhaus, Basel exhibited his work outside of the Kriegspressequartier for the first time. His treatment of military events was careful and accurate, and both stylistically and biographically he has many similarities to Oskar Laske. Like him, Basel avoids sensationalising or exaggerating, and favours crowds of small figures and a simplicity approaching photographic accuracy. Alfred died from the effects of a hunting accident in Dickenau, Türnitz, Lower Austria."

  "text" : "Antonio Scopelliti (Campo Calabro, January 20, 1935 – Piale, August 9, 1991) was an Italian prosecuting magistrate, murdered by the 'Ndrangheta on behalf of the Sicilian Mafia. He was a prosecutor at the Italian Supreme Court (Corte di Cassazione). While on holiday visiting his family in Calabria, he was ambushed on a road on August 9, 1991. At the time he was preparing to argue the government’s case in the final appeal of the Maxi Trial against Cosa Nostra for the Supreme Court. The reason for the killing was to hold up the trial so that the Mafia bosses' legal terms of detention would expire and they would be freed. The crime still remains unsolved. Two trials were held at the Court of Reggio Calabria against Mafia boss Salvatore Riina and thirteen of the so-called Sicilian Mafia Commission, and a second trial against Bernardo Provenzano and nine other bosses of the Commission, including Filippo and Giuseppe Graviano, Raffaele Ganci, Giuseppe Farinella, Antonino Giuffrè and Nitto Santapaola. All were convicted at first instance in 1996 and 1998 and subsequently acquitted in the Court of Appeals in 1998 and 2000 because the testimonies of the seventeen government witnesses were conflicting. His daughter Rosanna Scopelliti is the national coordinator of Ammazzateci tutti (Italian for \"Kill Us All\"), an Italian Antimafia social movement against the 'Ndrangheta."

Rosenberg is known, among other contributions, for formulating the Aanderaa–Karp–Rosenberg conjecture stating that many nontrivial properties in graph theory cannot be answered without testing for the presence or absence of every possible edge in a given graph. Rosenberg did both his undergraduate and graduate studies at Harvard University, receiving a bachelor's degree in 1962 and a Ph.D. in 1966 under the supervision of Patrick C. Fischer.Prior to joining the UMass faculty, Rosenberg worked at the Thomas J. Watson Research Center from 1965 until 1981, and was a faculty member at Duke University from 1981 until 1985. He was elected a fellow of the Association for Computing Machinery in 1996 for his work on \"graph-theoretic models of computation, emphasizing theoretical studies of parallel algorithms and architectures, VLSI design and layout, and data structures\". In 1997, he was elected as a fellow of the IEEE \"for fundamental contributions to theoretical aspects of computer science and engineering\"."

  "text" : "Adalram (died 836) was an early 8th-century prelate active in Bavaria. He is known to have been archdeacon of the Salzburg diocese c. 819, and in 821 succeeded Arno as Archbishop of Salzburg. In 824, following the request of the emperor Louis the Pious, he received the pallium from Pope Eugenius II. As archbishop he continued the attempts to evangelize the Slavs of Upper Pannonia and Carantania, appointing Otto as under-bishop to the Slavs. During his episcopate the church of Nitra in Pannonia (in what is now Slovakia) was dedicated at his instigation. The ruler Pribina had recently taken a Bavarian Christian wife, and this church may have been for her use. He is thought to have died on 4 January 836. He is associated with the production of many manuscripts, including Bayerische Staatsbibliothek, Clm 15817 which contains several works of St Augustine and the earliest surviving version of the Anonymous Life of St Cuthbert. Another manuscript with Augustinian materials, Clm 14098, was presented by Adalram to the Louis the German, duke of Bavaria."

Strauss lectures extensively not only for bookstores and book clubs, but at conferences, colleges and universities, synagogues, libraries, country clubs, etc. For her most recently published novel Based Upon Availability, a novel that takes place in Manhattan's swanky Four Seasons Hotel, Strauss designed a book tour around hotels. She is in fact known for her unusual reading events and was quoted by Publishers Weekly to say \"I believe in finding venues that are in keeping with the theme of one's work.\" True to her words, Strauss held the launch party for her first novel The Joy of Funerals at the Frank E. Campbell funeral home. She also held a reading for Death Becomes Them: Unearthing the Suicides of the Brilliant, the Famous & the Notorious at the Green-Wood Cemetery in Brooklyn."

He played just three games for Melbourne, in the 1903 VFL season and at the end of the year crossed to Carlton. Playing as a defender, Gourlay made three appearances with Carlton and experienced all possible results, a win, draw and a loss. He later emigrated to New Zealand, where he got married and worked as a canvasser in Wellington. In 1917 he signed up to serve his adopted country in the war and traveled to the United Kingdom with the New Zealand Expeditionary Force. Gourlay fought with the 29th Reinforcements of the Wellington Infantry Regiment, B Company, on the front and suffered serious wounds. He had been taking part in some of the final offensives of the war and his death at a military hospital in England occurred just ten days before the ceasefire."

  "text" : "Amos Richards Eno (November 1, 1810 – February 21, 1898) of Simsbury, Connecticut was an American merchant of dry goods who expanded into real estate in New York City, built the Fifth Avenue Hotel and established a prominent family fortune, of which the New York real estate alone was estimated at twenty million dollars at the time of his death. Having clerked in a small general store in Hartford, Connecticut, he married Lucy Phelps, also of Simsbury, and moved to New York, where he and his cousin John Jay Phelps opened a profitable dry goods business. While making a fortune in the dry goods business, Amos Eno parlayed his profits into real estate investment in Manhattan, New York, buying corner lots and occasionally full undeveloped city blocks. His brownstone-fronted store at 74 Broadway had the reputation of having been the first use of brownstone in the city. Retiring from active participation as a merchant, he concentrated in 1856–59 in building the famous Fifth Avenue Hotel at the corner of Fifth Avenue and 23rd Street in Madison Square, Manhattan, and the adjacent Madison Square Theatre in 1863. North of the Square he built a brick four-storey house at 233 Fifth Avenue that served as his residence for many years, then from 1890 housed the Reform Club of New York, recently (1888) founded by Anson Phelps Stokes.He and relatives established the Second National Bank of New York, headquartered in the hotel. In 1884 scandal hit the family bank when one of Amos' sons, John Chester Eno, president of the bank, embezzled millions of dollars and then fled to Canada to avoid prosecution. Eno never closed the bank, though three to four million dollars were withdrawn in panic, and made good his son's embezzlement, \"though he never recovered from the shock\". After settling his son's debts, Amos retreated to the family summer residence in Simsbury, the Amos Eno House (1820, on the National Register of Historic Places) which had been erected by Eno's father-in-law, Elisha Phelps. Every summer the Eno family would visit the house, which was enlarged by Eno and by his daughter Antoinette Eno Wood. He was a founding benefactor of the Simsbury Free Library, among other local philanthropic gestures. He held the greater part of a full block facing Broadway in Longacre Square (now Times Square). His last real estate speculations were in open lots in the Upper West Side. Eno's portrait by Eastman Johnson, commissioned by his family in 1899, was a posthumous one, based on photographs; it is conserved in the New York State Museum. A grandson, Amos Richards Eno Pinchot (1873–1944), was an American reformist, a mainstay and the historian of the Progressive Party, 1912-16."

After teaching for several years in Sacramento high schools, Rodda entered the United States Navy Reserve and was a gunnery officer in World War II. Leaving the Navy Reserve in 1946, he started teaching at Sacramento City College. In 1951, Rodda received a Ph.D. in history and economics from Stanford. A Democrat, Rodda won a 1958 special election to the California State Senate to represent the 19th District to fill the vacancy from the death of Earl D. Desmond, defeating Desmond's son and two other Democrats. He was re-elected six times but was defeated in 1980 in an upset by a newcomer, John Doolittle. Rodda's best-known legislative legacy is SB 160, enacted in 1975 and taking effect in 1976, which established collective bargaining for California's public school teachers. Shortly after Rodda's departure from the Senate, the California State Treasurer Jesse M. Unruh appointed Rodda as Executive Secretary of the Commission on State Finance. In 1983, Rodda left the Commission and was elected to the Board of Trustees of the Los Rios Community College District. He left the board in 1992. In 1980, the Los Rios Community College District Board named a new administrative-classroom complex at Sacramento City College as Rodda Hall. Rodda met Clarice Horgan, an English teacher, when they both taught at Grant Union High School. They married in 1941 and had one son and two daughters."

  "text" : "Axel Herman Haig (Swedish: Axel Herman Hägg, 10 November 1835 – 1921) was a Swedish-born artist and illustrator. His paintings, illustrations and etchings, undertaken for himself and on behalf of many of the foremost architects of the Victorian period made him \"the Piranesi of the Gothic Revival.\" Haig was born on the island of Gotland in the Baltic Sea. His father was a landowner and timber merchant. Haig was apprenticed as a shipbuilder at the government dockyard at Karlskrona and in 1856 went to Glasgow for a further period of training at a firm of Clydeside shipbuilders. But his interests had turned to architecture and in 1859, he undertook a new apprenticeship as a draughtsman in the offices of the Ecclesiastical Commissioners. After seven years there, he launched himself as an architectural artist. The middle years of the nineteenth century saw an explosion in the practice of architectural competitions. The wealth generated by the empire and The Industrial Revolution created the necessary conditions for a vast expansion in civic construction. Commissions for government offices, town halls, churches for private benefactors, railway termini were all put out to tender and competing architects required draughtsmen to illustrate their plans. In 1866 Haig met William Burges when Burges retained him to illustrate his designs for the Royal Courts of Justice in The Strand. Haig produced a series of watercolour illustrations that were \"an immediate sensation.\" The competition's winner, George Edmund Street is said to have remarked, \"I wouldn't mind being beaten by drawings like those.\" Haig and Burges continued in partnership until the latter's death in 1881. In that time they jointly produced some of the most spectacular medieval visions of the Victorian Gothic Revival. Cardiff Castle, Knightshayes Court, the Church of Christ the Consoler at Skelton-on-Ure, St Mary's Church, Park House, the Speech Room, Harrow School, Castell Coch, Trinity College, Hartford, Connecticut and the designs for the re-decoration of Saint Paul's Cathedral: as Burges designed his most important commissions, so Haig drew them. \"In Haig, Burges, the architect of a medieval dreamland, had found an artist worthy of his dreams.\" Haig developed a second career as an etcher and his drawings and lithographs of European castles, palaces, landscapes and cathedrals became hugely popular in late-Victorian England. In a review of his work published by RIBA in the year of his death, Maurice Adams wrote that \"his architectural draughtsmanship ranks without a doubt amongst the foremost of his time and his graphic capability remains unique.\" Haig also designed All Saints Church in Grayswood, Surrey. It was built between 1901 and 1902 in a style described variously as Surrey Vernacular or \"13th-century [Gothic] with Arts and Crafts elements\". It is a Grade II listed building."

  "text" : "Arthur Charles Evans CBE (21 March 1916 – 18 March 2011) was best known as the author of Sojourn in Silesia: 1940 - 1945, in which he recounts his experiences of his time in World War II, between 1940 and 1945, in the prisoner-of-war camp, Stalag VIIIB. Thousands of young men were incarcerated in Stalag VIIIB, in Lamsdorf, by the Germans during World War II. Evans recounted these experiences both in his book, as well as on his website, Lamsdorf Remembered. The website was created due to public response from the children and grandchildren of former inmates of Stalag VIIIB, the website originally named Lamsdorf Reunited was created to record stories and photographs from that experience. Evans encountered the respected RAF pilot Douglas Bader while at Stalag VIIIB, and talked about his escape attempts in his book. Evans himself is mentioned in a book called POW: Allied Prisoners in Europe, 1939–1945 by Adrian Gilbert who used Sojourn in Silesia for his information. Evans was a member of The National Ex-Prisoner of War Association, whose patron is Dame Vera Lynn, DBE, LLD, M.MUS, and is mentioned in the August 2001 newsletter. More recently, on his website Lamsdorf Remembered, a half-hour Radio Kent interview with Evans was published, as well as a blog called Letters from Stalag VIIIB, which is made up of Evans' letters home during his four years as a prisoner-of-war. The blog was published as a book in February 2014 by Evans' daughter Kathryn Gower."

  "text" : "Arthur Hunnable (fl. 1907–1921), often known as Captain Hunnable, was a British poet and minor fraudster, best known for his frequent but unsuccessful attempts to become a candidate for election to Parliament. Living in Ilford, Hunnable worked as a bicycle and tool maker and motor engineer until March 1907. He first came to public attention at the Jarrow by-election that summer, before which he spoke widely in the town, announcing that he intended to stand as a candidate. He was nominated, but failed to deliver a £200 deposit, as required, and despite his protests, was not permitted to stand. Despite this, he continued to give popular speeches, and the Mayor of Jarrow declared that \"he keeps the young and the rough element amused\". Following the election, Hunnable appeared at the Empire Music Hall in Holborn in a skit reliving parts of his campaign. After a week, he quit, to speak in the run-up to the Colne Valley by-election, then moved on to the North West Staffordshire by-election. However, he did not attempt to stand, announcing that he had decided to stand at Jarrow in the next general election. He proved less popular in Staffordshire, and was fined for causing an obstruction in Hanley Market Square, and describing any hecklers as \"dirty little tykes\". Unable to pay the £3 demanded, he was imprisoned for a month, but was released after three days, a public subscription having raised the sum. Hunnable next tried to stand at the Liverpool Kirkdale by-election, but announced immediately before nominations closed that all twelve of his nomination papers had been incorrectly completed, so he could not continue with his candidacy. He also spoke at the Peckham by-election, 1908, and at the North West Manchester by-election, he spoke in favour of the Conservative Party candidate William Joynson-Hicks. During the election, a carriage in which he was riding, decked out in the Conservative colours, ran into a crowd of Liberal Party supporters, and the vehicle was overturned before he made his escape. Hunnable was known for his flamboyant style, sometimes bowing from his carriage to imaginary cheers, and lively meetings - he claimed by the end of 1909 to have given a \"good hiding\" to thirty-seven hecklers. He frequently employed poetry, which was widely considered of a low standard. He claimed to have schemes which would make the fortunes of those who voted for him, introduce a £2 minimum wage, reform the British Empire. At Attercliffe in 1909, he claimed that he would be forming a government within five years. He wore a frock coat, kid boots with pointed toes and a wide-awake hat. In May 1908, Hunnable was fined £3, a guinea and costs for unlawfully leaving a donkey and cart in Romford Market and then assaulting a market employee. This did not stop him from appearing at the Wolverhampton East by-election, and speaking in Manchester on the topic of the \"Social Reform Progress League\" which he had supposedly founded. He announced that he would run in the Pudsey by-election, but again failed to stand. In August, he was gaoled for five weeks for failing to pay the fines imposed in May. Hunnable re-emerged at the Sheffield Attercliffe by-election, 1909, at which he met with independent Conservative candidate Arnold Muir Wilson, but decided against supporting him until he divined a horoscope stating that Muir Wilson would win. At the end of the summer, he spoke on the beach at Blackpool, but was fined 10 shillings for knocking out a heckler. The press gradually lost interest in his activities, but by 1913, when he was fined for failing to send his daughter to school, he was the editor of his own newspaper, the People's Parliament. He moved to Newcastle-upon-Tyne, where he claimed to have invented an unsinkable ship and a new form of airship. He attempted to stand as an independent labour candidate in Jarrow at the 1918 general election. In 1921, he was again gaoled, this time for fraud, having purchased a bicycle with a worthless cheque."

  "text" : "A.G. Russell (August 27, 1933) was born in Eudora, Arkansas where his great-grandfather taught him how to make knives when he was nine. Russell went on to make knives as a hobby and profession. In 1964, Russell switched his focus to selling Arkansas whetstones and a year later began selling knives. In 1968 he started the first forum for selling aftermarket knives, the A.G. Russell List of Knives for Immediate Delivery, which later became The Cutting Edge. His mailing list was used as a basis for the first two knife magazines, Knife World and The American Blade, now known as Blade. In 1970 he co-founded the Knife Collectors Club and the Knifemakers' Guild, both of which are the oldest continuously functioning organizations of their types. Russell was the first member of the Knife Digest Cutlery Hall of Fame and produced the first commemorative pocket knife. Russell designed and produced the first linerless pocket knife with all-plastic handles in 1970. In 1975, he designed a unique boot knife he called the \"Sting\", a small knife intended for hunting and personal defense. In 1987, he introduced the \"A.G. Russell One Hand Knife\" which was one of the first production knives to use a blade thumbstud for one-handed opening. In 1988 he was inducted into the Blade Magazine Cutlery Hall of Fame."

He was one of the main supporters of the moderate wings of Sabbatai Zevi and gathered around him many followers of the movement, like Behr Perlhefter, Mordecai Mokiach and Mordecai Ashkenazi. In 1700–1701 he spent one year in Fürth, in order to proof the press of the Zoharic commentariy of his pupil Mordecai Ashkenazi. One year later, he and a group of followers settled in the Holy Land. Rovigo came from a wealthy Modena family, and was dedicated throughout his entire life to studying, collecting, and publishing Kabbalistic manuscripts.He was a close friend of Benjamin ben Eliezer Ha-Kohen Vitale of Reggio with whom he had studied Kabbalah in Venice under Moses Zacuto. Scholem also mentions in several places the correspondence about Sabbatean affairs he maintained with Meir bar Hiyya Rofe between the years 1674 and 1678 as a very important source for the history of the Sabbatean movement."

  "text" : "Andrew J. Dufur, Jr. (August 29, 1847 – June 19, 1914) was the founder of the town of Dufur, Oregon, in the United States. He was involved in stock-raising. He was born in Williamstown, Vermont, on August 29, 1847. His father was a native of New Hampshire, as were his parents. His father served through the entire War of 1812 and drew a pension for a partial disability. Andrew Jr.'s great grandfather was a French Huguenot, a refugee from France at the time of the historic French Revolution. They were of the aristocratic element whose lives were forfeited through the edict of the leaders of the Sans Cullottes, Marat and Robspierre. Andrew J. Dufur, Sr., crossed the plains to California in 1859. His wife, Lois (Burnham) Dufur, was a native of Williamstown, Vermont, descendant of an old and distinguished New England family. She died at Dufur in 1895. She and her son went to Portland, Oregon, via Panama, arriving in April, 1860. They had been preceded by the father, Andrew J., Sr. For 12 years the family lived 6 miles (10 km) from Portland, on a farm owned jointly by father and sons, comprising 800 acres (320 ha). This property they disposed of in 1871. The father of our subject died at Dufur, in June, 1897. Dufur was educated in district schools, supplemented by a term at Pacific University in Forest Grove, Oregon. In 1872 Dufur and his brother, Enoch B. Dufur, came to the vicinity of where is now the town of Dufur, and jointly purchased between 500 and 600 acres (200 and 240 ha). They were pioneers; only one settler was there before them, Joseph Beasley. The brothers platted the townsite in 1880. Dufur and his wife owned about 2,300 acres (930 ha) of land as of 1905. With his son-in-law, Charles P. Balch, he was engaged profitably in stock-raising. Mr. Dufur had two brothers, Enoch B. Dufur, a practicing attorney at Portland, Oregon. William H.H. Dufur, a farmer near Dufur, and one sister, Arabelle, wife of William Staats, a farmer living 3 miles (4.8 km) from Dufur. On May 2, 1869, in Portland, Dufur married Mary M. Stansbery, of Indiana, daughter of John E. and Ann M. (Hughes) Stansbery. The father came to Oregon in 1862, settling on Columbia Slough, where he lived until the time of his death, in 1889. The mother lived in East Portland. Mrs. Dufur had three brothers and five sisters; John E. and Stephen E., at Woodlawn, Oregon; William G., on the Yukon River, in Alaska; Elizabeth, married to Milton M. Sunderland, a Portland capitalist; Susan, wife of James Wendell, of Portland; Lucetta, widow of John Foster, late of Hood River, Oregon; Rosabelle, married to Daniel Zeller, a builder and contractor at Dawson, Alaska; and Frances, wife of Morgan A. Zeller, of Portland. Mr. and Mrs. Dufur had two children, Lois, wife of Charles P. Balch, and Anna, married to H.A. May, a merchant at Portland. He was a Democrat and frequently served his party at county and state conventions."

In 1988 she earned an A.M. in Soviet Union Regional Studies from Harvard University where she completed her PhD in Political Science 1991. In 1990–91, Stanger was a Research Fellow at the Brookings Institution. Between 1995 and 1996, she was a Visiting Scholar at Prague's Charles University.

In her book, One Nation Under Contract: The Outsourcing of American Power and the Future of Foreign Policy, Stanger argues that poor oversight of U.S. government contractors in Afghanistan and Iraq has squandered American resources, exacerbating domestic unemployment and deficit problems. Currently, Stanger is focusing on the relationship between technology, the law, and politics. She is writing a book entitled \"Consumers Versus Citizens: How the Internet is Remaking American National Security and Other Things that Matter\". She also teaches courses at Middlebury College entitled \"Politics of Virtual Realities\" and \"American Foreign Policy\"."

He worked with papier-mâché and several other materials such as celluloid and galalith to create models of insects including a flea (1930, 100:1 scale), a housefly (1932, 50:1 scale), a mosquito in flight (1937, 60:1 scale), a Colorado potato beetle (1940, 50:1 scale), and a ball bearer leafhopper (Bocydium globulare, 1953, 180:1 scale), among others. The housefly, typical of the painstaking attention to detail shown in Keller's sculptures, includes 2,653 bristles. Each model took about a year to complete."

After her death she bequeathed her estate to the Rotary Club of Plainfield-North Plainfield which in turned generated a scholarship fund for students seeking post-secondary education in the Humanities and Sciences. DeLeeuw managed to bequeath a total of $1 million for that cause. Every year since, there has been a scholarship award ceremony, including dinner at the Spain Inn Restaurant in Plainfield. After her beloved sister Cateau died, she wrote a book Remembered with Love: Letters to my Sister. It was an autobiography of herself as well as a biography of her sister.

The Tzamplakones were an important and wealthy aristocratic family attested since the mid-13th century, when one of its members achieved the high military rank of Domestic of the Schools. Alexios Tzamplakon, Asomatianos' father, was this man's son. His brothers, Demetrios and Arsenios, also achieved high offices during the same period. Asomatianos is first attested in 1348, as megas doux (commander-in-chief of the Byzantine navy). He was placed in charge of the Byzantine effort to construct a new fleet to use against the Genoese colony of Galata in the Byzantine–Genoese War of 1348–1349. His fleet's inexperience and incompetence led to its destruction or capture by the Genoese. Tzamplakon survived the debacle, and died sometime before 1356."

Albrecht Dold studied mathematics and physics at the University of Heidelberg, then worked for some years at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, at Columbia University, New York and at the University of Zürich. In 1963 he returned to Heidelberg, where he stayed most of his career. Dold's seminal work in algebraic topology, in particular, his work on fixed-point theory has made him known in economics as well as mathematics, and his book \"Lectures on Algebraic Topology\" is astandard reference among economists as well as mathematicians. He had 19 students and 58 descendants and he was himself a student of Herbert Seifert. Dold was married to Yvonne Dold-Samplonius, a distinguished historian of mathematics."

She is also the head of the oriental division at one of the most prominent music schools of Lebanon which is the Faculty of Music at the \"Université Saint-Esprit Kaslik\" (USEK), where she also teaches Oriental singing. She taught many well known singers, either at LNHCM or at USEK (or elsewhere), to name a few: Wael Kfoury, Abeer Nehme, Carla Ramia, Lena Farah... The famous Lebanese singer Elissa reproduced a song by Aida Chalhoub entitled \"Law Fiyeh\", and it became a great success. However, some dispute did arise due to renewing this song, since the management office behind Elissa announced that the renewal of the song is in the memory of singer Salwa Al Katrib, in a reference to her as the original singer. Not only Elissa did not apologize for the mistake, but Elissa did refer to Aida in a television interview as \"[the] late singer Aida Chalhoub\", for which Aida also claims she did not receive any apology."

In his university days he worked as a land-surveyor's assistant, salesman, clerk and window-dresser. Wannenburgh is most significantly associated with the Sophiatown Renaissance. He was an Umkhonto we Sizwe noted for his part in the ANC Underground Movement where he became close friends with Dennis Goldberg. Wannenburgh remained in South Africa in the early 1960s rather than going into exile. A close friend of Richard Rive at this time, he contributed stories to anthologies edited by Rive for Heinemann's African Writers Series: the short story anthology Quartet (1963) and the prose anthology Modern African Prose (1964). He later wrote about the Southern African landscape and Kalahari Bushmen, collaborating with photographers on books and instances of photojournalism for which he provided the text. He wrote Forgotten Frontiersmen which centred around the history of the Griqua and Khoikhoi people. In 1987 he wrote The World of Shooting, a detailed account of the history and worldwide efforts made towards the goal of nature conservation and the contributions given towards the sustainability of land through funds raised by controlled shooting ranges. A book that records in great detail, the venues of the most prestigious shoots around the world as well as the key figures and events that ensure their effective impact. Diamond people, a book on the history and trade of diamonds which covers the start and legacy of the De Beers mining company, as well as other subjects such as the famous jewels of the world and the stories behind their discovery. Wannenburgh wrote Diamond People in consultation with the Oppenheimer family and various other contributing parties."

  "text" : "Anthony \"Tony\" Milano was an Italian mobster who rose to power in America working for the Cleveland crime family in the American Mafia. He served as the longtime underboss in the Cleveland crime family from 1930 until his retirement in 1976. He was the godfather of future Cleveland crime family underboss Angelo Lonardo. Milano was born on December 5, 1888 in Reggio Calabria in Southern Italy to Pietro and Grazia Milano (née Mazza). His family eventually immigrated to the United States and made their way to Cleveland, Ohio. Milano and his brother Frank were active in Black Hand extortion and bootlegging during prohibition. His younger brother Frank was leader of the \"Mayfield Road Mob\", an Italian gang that fought the Porrello crime family for control of criminal rackets in Ohio. In the early 1930s, the Porrello family was defeated and Frank became boss of the Cleveland crime family, being an original member of The Commission. Anthony served as his underboss. In 1935, Frank fled the country due to tax evasion charges. Alfred Polizzi took over as boss of the family and kept Anthony on as underboss. Milano remained underboss for decades despite the changes in leadership over the years. Milano had significant control over several local labor unions in Cleveland due to his connection to Jackie Presser. As the years went on, Milano spent less time involved in the Cleveland crime family and he began to take on more of an advisory role while other influential crime family members served as acting underbosses. Even so, he kept the title of underboss until his retirement in 1976. He died of natural causes two years later in 1978. Milano became a naturalized citizen on June 27, 1924. He married Josephine DiSanto and had four sons: Peter, Frank, John and Carmen. His wife and kids moved to Los Angeles in the 1940s while he split time between Los Angeles, Cleveland and Las Vegas. Milano had many legitimate and criminal business interests in all three cities. His eldest son Peter was a member of the Los Angeles crime family and the Milanos' relationship strengthened the ties between the two crime families. His niece's husband John Nardi, an influential associate of the Cleveland crime family, went against the Cleveland family in the 1970s and sided with the Irish gang led by Danny Greene."

He was the son of Gérard III, Count of Rieneck and Cunegonde von Zimmern. His marriage to Jeanne de Chiny brought him the County of Chiny. In 1227, his brother Louis III gave him the County of Loon. In 1234, he took part in a crusade at the request of Pope Gregory IX against the Statingers, heretics, probably Cathar, located in the diocese of Bremen. Then he helped Jean d'Eppes, bishop of Liege in repelling attacks Waleran, Lord of Valkenburg, in 1238. The following year he reconciles Henry II, Duke of Brabant and Wautier Bertout, Lord of Mechelen. In 1240, he joined forces with the dukes of Brabant and Limburg an attempt to reconcile Pope Gregory IX with the Emperor Frederick II. In 1244, a war is contrasted with Henry of Heinsberg. The dispute between the pope and the emperor festered, the pope excommunicated the emperor, and called on voters to choose another: William of Holland and Arnold attended his coronation. To keep their fiefdoms from suffering the disorders of anarchy following the death of Frederick II, Bishop of Liege, the Duke of Brabant, and Count of Gelderland entered a confederation entrusted with their common defense. Arnold enjoyed the esteem and confidence of his contemporaries, and arbitrated several disputes to this title. He granted freedom to Hasselt and Kuringen, granted city status in Bilzen and made several donations to monasteries. Arnold and Jeanne had the following children: \n*  John, Count of Chiny and Loon \n*  Arnaul II (d. 1273), Bishop of Châlons (1272-1273) \n*  Henri de Looz, Seigneur d’Agimont \n*  Gerard de Looz (d. after Apr 1284), Seigneur de Chauvency le-Château, married Marguerite de Meurs \n*  Elisabeth (d. before 1251) married first Thomas III of Coucy, Seigneur of Vervins, and second Albert, Seigneur of Voorne \n*  Adelaide (d. after 1268), married to Thierry II, Seigneur of Valkenburg \n*  Juliane, married to Nicolas, Seigneur of Quiévrain \n*  Louis V, Count of Chiny \n*  Marguerite (d. 1292), married Willem IV, Seigneur of Horn.

His Ethics of the Physician contains the first documented description of a peer review process, where the notes of a practising Islamic physician were reviewed by peers and the physician could face a lawsuit from a maltreated patient if the reviews were negative. Al-Ruhawi was probably from Al-Ruha, modern-day Şanlıurfa in Turkey, close to the border with Syria, which is often simply known as Urfa. He was born a Christian, possibly in the Nestorian offshoot, and may have still been Christian when he composed his works, despite the very strong influence of Islam on them. However, based on an analysis of his writings, a modern historian has challenged this notion, claiming that only a Muslim could have produced such texts."

His multi-volume history, while it begins with the 7th-century arrival of the Arabs, spends more attention on details of the Husainid dynasty (1705–1957), during the 18th and 19th centuries. His writing is informed by his experience as chancellery secretary during the reigns of five Beys in succession. Bin Diyaf himself eventually favored the reform position, which became current in Tunisian politics. His letter in reply to questions about Tunisian women has also attracted notice."

  "text" : "Allison Hartwell Eid (born 1965) is the 95th Justice of the Colorado Supreme Court, having been appointed to the post in 2006 by Republican Governor Bill Owens. Born in Spokane, Washington, Eid earned her Bachelor of Arts degree in American studies with distinction in 1987 from Stanford University, where she was a member of the Phi Beta Kappa honor society. After graduating, she served as a Special Assistant and Speechwriter to President Ronald Reagan's Secretary of Education, William Bennett. She left the Department of Education to attend the University of Chicago Law School, where she was articles editor of the law review and was elected to the Order of the Coif before earning her Juris Doctor with high honors in 1991. After graduating from law school, Eid served as a law clerk for U.S. Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Jerry Edwin Smith and then for U.S. Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas. After completing her clerkships, she went on to become a commercial and appellate litigator at the law firm of Arnold & Porter. In 1998, she left Arnold & Porter to serve as an Associate Professor of Law at the University of Colorado Law School, where she taught courses on constitutional law, torts, and federalism. In 2002, President George W. Bush appointed Eid to serve on the Permanent Committee for the Oliver Wendell Holmes Devise, which writes the history of the U.S. Supreme Court and sponsors the Oliver Wendell Holmes Lecture. In 2005, Republican Governor Bill Owens appointed Eid to serve as Solicitor General of Colorado. A year later, Owens appointed Eid to serve as the 95th Justice of the Colorado Supreme Court. In 2008, 75% of Colorado voters voted to retain Eid on the Supreme Court. She is on presumptive GOP nominee Donald Trump's list of potential Supreme Court justices. Eid met her husband, Troy, when he was standing in line at a Stanford University dorm cafeteria while she was working as a student food service worker and he was editor-in-chief of the student newspaper, The Stanford Daily; she later said: \"It was love at first sight in the meal card line.\" In 2006, a few months after Allison Eid was appointed to the Colorado Supreme Court, President George W. Bush appointed Troy Eid as the 41st United States Attorney for the District of Colorado and the first Egyptian-American U.S. Attorney in the country's history. The Eids reside in Morrison, Colorado with their son Alex and daughter Emily."

On his orders, the Umayyad Mosque was restored in 1082 following the severe damage inflicted upon it during a fire in 1069. In particular, he had its central dome replaced, the piers supporting the dome reinforced, and the original Umayyad-era mosaics in the interior of the mosque's northern facade renewed. According to Muslim historian Ibn al-Athir, Ahmad ibn Fadl led an attack on the Ismailis of Syria in 1126. Al-Athir states that Ahmad ibn Fadl gave his troops orders to \"slaughter\" the Ismailis, plunder their goods and take their women into captivity. He was assassinated by the Ismailis the same year as retaliation."

  "text" : "Antoine-Germain Labarraque (28 March 1777 – 9 December 1850) was a French chemist and pharmacist, notable for formulating and finding important uses for \"Eau de Labarraque\" or \"Labarraque's solution\", a solution of sodium hypochlorite widely used as a disinfectant and deodoriser. Labarraque's use of sodium and calcium hypochlorite solutions in the disinfection of animal gut processing facilities and morgues, as well as his published reports of their application to treat gangrene and putrescent wounds in living persons in the 1820s, established this practice long before Ignaz Semmelweis employed the same solutions to prevent \"cadaveric particles\" from traveling from hospital dissecting rooms to patient examination rooms, starting in 1847. These findings and practices are notable for providing an empirical discovery of antisepsis, starting some 40 years before Pasteur and Lister began to establish the theoretical basis of this practice. Labarraque's solutions and techniques remain in use to the present day."

  "text" : "Ritter was born Anna Nuhn in Coburg, Bavaria (then part of the duchy of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha) on February, 23, 1865, but she was only a young child when her father, an export trader, moved the family to New York City. The young Anna returned to Europe in 1869 to attend boarding schools in Kassel and at a Moravian boarding school in the hamlet of Montmirail in the French-speaking canton of Neuchâtel, Switzerland. She completed her education in Kassel where she married a future civil servant, Rudolf Ritter in 1884. The couple moved first to Cologne and later to Berlin and Münster. Her husband died in 1893, and the widow moved to the spa town of Bad Frankenhausen in Thuringia. She published her first collection of poetry in 1898 and a second collection followed in 1900. In that same year she found employment with the weekly journal, Die Gartenlaube, which had previously published her poetry. She published a novel, Margharita in 1902 followed by a travel diary. Her most famous poem is \"Denkt euch, ich habe das Christkind geseh'n\" (I think I saw the Christ Child). She belonged to a group of writers commissioned by Cologne-based Ludwig Stollwerck chocolate producers to produce literature for a series of collectable print albums and scrapbooks. Other authors included the poet \"T. Resa,\" (Gröhe Theresa), zoologist Paul Matschie, Hans Eschelbach, journalist Julius Rodenburg, writer Joseph von Lauff, poet Carl Hermann Busse, and the novelist Gustav Falke, among others. Ritter died on October 31, 1921 in Marburg. Ritters style is lyric, and it aligns with lyric styles of several turn of the century German poets – saturated with symbolism and influenced by folklore and a New Romanticism. Composers to set her poems to music include Max Reger, Jean Sibelius, and Kurt Weill, among others."

  "text" : "Alice Gold (Alice McLaughlin) is an English singer-songwriter based in London, formerly signed to Sunday Best and currently signed to Fiction Records. Gold lives on her 53-foot narrowboat with her husband, film producer Jules Cocke, in north London’s canal boat community, where she recorded many demos. \"Like many an adventurer with wanderlust, Alice spent some of her early twenties traveling South East Asia with her trusty battered guitar, continually gathering inspiration and song ideas, before finding herself in Edinburgh. There she underwent a period of experimentation, collaborating with various lights on the music scene. She moved to London to pursue her ambitions, but the death of her mother precipitated an intense period of loss and grief, culminating in a need to escape the grind of city life. Alice took a trip to America, ambling around the Deep South, en route to San Francisco, with little more than her wits and that battered old guitar again, in a 1979 Dodge Winnebago. On the way she found courage, independence and freedom, all key in developing her own unique style and sound.\" Her debut single \"Dolly Figured\" was released under her original name on 21 October 2007. Her debut single as Alice Gold, \"Orbiter\", was released on 23 September 2010 through Pure Groove Records, with a single launch party at The Drop in Stoke Newington. The Guardian said it \"showcases Gold's mighty voice through its power-pop chorus\" and described her as \"One to watch\". This was followed by \"Runaway Love\", released on Fiction Records, which has received airplay on radio stations across the UK, entering the A-List on BBC Radio 2. On the official release date, 18 April 2011, an acoustic EP was recorded live at Toerag Studios where The White Stripes have previously recorded. Gold's debut album Seven Rainbows, released on 4 July 2011, was produced by Dan Carey (Franz Ferdinand, Hot Chip, Lily Allen). In an interview with PopCultureMonster.com she said of the album, \"the main bass, drums and guitars rhythm tracks were all recorded live and on tape like the old '60s records. The over-dubs are mostly made up of one-takes, whether it be guitar or vocal takes. My producer Dan Carey and I decided that if a take felt good then we’d keep it, so it is complete with minor ‘mistakes’ and quirky sounds through doing that, which we both like. It's a very honest album, quite autobiographical. The songs were born from a lot of darkness and grief but the lyrics are drenched in hope because of that, which is why I imagine people connect to it.\" In October 2010, Gold was shortlisted for Q magazine's 'Next Big Thing' award. In September 2011, Gold's cover of the Billy Fury song \"Wondrous Place\" was used in an advert for the British beer brand Carling. She has toured with Eels, Athlete, Band Of Skulls, Noah And The Whale, and The Twilight Singers, and has upcoming tour support slots confirmed with The Dears and The Bookhouse Boys. Gold also played festivals in 2011, including Glastonbury, V Festival, T in the Park, Harvest at Jimmy's Festival, Jodrell Bank Live, Kendal Calling, Cornbury Festival and Hull's Freedom Festival."

He was notable for his contributions in numerous films over a 30-year period including: The Heroes of Telemark (1965), Kelly's Heroes (1970), The Omen (1976), A Bridge too Far (1977), Superman (1978), Superman II (1980), Superman IV: The Quest for Peace (1987), Return of the Jedi (1983) and the Bond films Goldfinger (1964) and On Her Majesty's Secret Service (1969). He also had small acting roles in some films including two Michael Reeves films, The Sorcerers (1967) and Witchfinder General (1968). As a stuntman he specialised in high falls and fight scenes. He doubled for Sean Connery in the film Goldfinger and for Richard Burton and Clint Eastwood in Where Eagles Dare (1968). Memorable appearances include his fight with Connery as the Mexican thug Capungo in Goldfinger. The fight ends with the character's electrocution in a bath when a sunlamp is thrown in by Bond, followed by his famous quip \"Shocking…Positively shocking\". Joint also took part in the fight scene on the top of a cable car in Where Eagles Dare and performed a jump from one cable car to another doubling for Richard Burton. On television he appeared in Doctor Who, Dick Turpin, Return to Treasure Island, Danger Man, The Prisoner, The Avengers, Space: 1999, The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, (for which he plunged 430 ft into the Reichenbach Falls doubling for Eric Porter) and London's Burning. He also performed a memorable stunt for a Cadbury Milk Tray television commercial in which the hero was seen diving off a cliff into the sea. Joint was a mentor to younger stuntmen such as Vic Armstrong and the late Rod Woodruff (d.2011). He retired in 1995 and died in 2005 of cancer aged 77."

Dowriche wrote The French Historie about the French Wars of Religion, \"a 2,400 line poem, a long and inherently gory narrative epic about the long-winded French Wars of Religion during the C16\", in which she speaks out against tyranny and justifies the Protestant Reformation. She described several tyrants who were slain by subjects and gave an account of the gruesome death of Charles IX of France, during whose reign the St. Bartholomew's Day massacre had taken place. After this, she addressed Elizabeth I of England, calling upon her to protect and lead her Protestant subjects. Dowriche also wrote Verses Written by a Gentlewoman, upon the Jailor's Conversion. She is also credited for writing other poetry that has not survived."

  "text" : "Aziz Ahmad (born c. 1964) is a professional Buzkashi player from Afghanistan. Ahmad was born in a farming village in northern Kunduz to a poor family. He began playing Buzkashi at age 15. At the time that he began playing, Buzkashi was a rite of passage for young men in the Kunduz region. At the age of 18 he was conscripted by the military of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan during the Soviet war in Afghanistan. He soon defected from the government military to join the Mujahideen. Ahmad initially left Kabul and returned to Kunduz after the 1992 Civil war began. His playing skill soon drew the attention of Mohammed Fahim, who was then a powerful warlord. Fahim offered to sponsor him if he returned to play in Kabul and chartered a helicopter to bring him back. Ahmad remained in Kabul until leaving the city in 1996 shortly before it fell to the Taliban, who then banned buzkashi. He returned to the north and joined the Northern Alliance to fight against the Taliban in the ensuing Civil war. After the fall of the Taliban during the 2001 War in Afghanistan, Ahmad returned to his Buzkashi career and soon became known as the best living player."

After her father died she moved to Cambridge, but soon after returned to London. Touched by the poverty in the eastend of London in 1868 she opened the Home of Industry at 60 Commercial Road in Spitalfield. In the 1870s, she organised that Home children were sent to Canada from her home in London also had arrangements with Barnardo's Homes of Dr. Barnardo in London, Quarriers homes in Scotland, and Smyly homes in Dublin, Ireland similar to arrangements with English and Scottish homes.In Canada she had set up a number of Homes, Marchmont, Galt in Ontario and in Knowlton Quebec The Doyle Report of 1875 into the emigration of children from these homes cast a shadow over the process of exporting children although it acknowledged the benevolent motives of MacPherson and others. Her sister Louisa MacPherson married Charles Henry Birt, and helped her sister in her mission.In 1873 she established a home in Liverpool called The Sheltering Home. MacPherson died in 1904."

  "text" : "Alcibiades of Apamea (fl. 230) was a Jewish Christian member of, or possibly even founder of, the Elcesaites. Of the several cities called Apamea it is Apamea in Syria which is intended. He is known only from the accounts of Hippolytus of Rome in his Refutations (Refutatio omnium haeresium, Book 10 ch. 9–13), where he follows on from Hippolytus' attacks on Pope Callixtus I: Hippolytus 10.9— The doctrine of this Callistus having been noised abroad throughout the entire world, a cunning man, and full of desperation, one called Alcibiades, dwelling in Apamea, a city of Syria, examined carefully into this business. And considering himself a more formidable character, and more ingenious in such tricks, than Callistus, he repaired to Rome; and he brought some book, alleging that a certain just man, Elchasai, had received this from Serae, a town of Parthia, and that he gave it to one called Sobiai. And the contents of this volume, he alleged, had been revealed by an angel whose height was 24 schoenoi, which make 96 miles, and whose breadth is 4 schoenoi, and from shoulder to shoulder 6 schoenoi; and the tracks of his feet extend to the length of three and a half schoenoi, which are equal to fourteen miles, while the breadth is one schoenos and a half, and the height half a schoenos. And he alleges that also there is a female with him, whose measurement, he says, is according to the standards already mentioned. And he asserts that the male (angel) is Son of God, but that the female is called Holy Spirit. By detailing these prodigies he imagines that he confounds fools, while at the same time he utters the following sentence: \"that there was preached unto men a new remission of sins in the third year of Trajan's reign.\""

  "text" : "Alfred George de Glehn (15 September 1848 – 8 June 1936) was a notable English-born French designer of steam locomotives and an engineer with the Société Alsacienne de Constructions Mécaniques (SACM). His steam engines of the 1890s combined elegance, high speed, and efficiency. Glehn's express locomotives were first used on the Nord Railway and on the boat trains from Calais to Paris, where they impressed passengers with their speed. He invented the Glehn system of compounding, and Glehn types were built in large numbers in France, and were also built in smaller numbers in Belgium, Germany, New Zealand, and Russia, see Compound locomotive. Compounding lost favour from the 1900s, being replaced by superheating. However André Chapelon rebuilt many of the French Glehn compounds from 1929 onwards."

During the 2010 South Kyrgyzstan ethnic clashes, which primarily targeted people of the Uzbek nationality, Askarov worked to document the violence. He was subsequently arrested and prosecuted on charges of creating mass disturbances, incitement of ethnic hatred, and complicity in murder. Following a trial protested by several international human rights groups for irregularities—including alleged torture and the courtroom intimidation of witnesses by police—Askarov was given a life sentence, which he is currently serving. In November 2010, Askarov's health was reported to be rapidly deteriorating as a result of his confinement. Numerous groups have advocated on his behalf, including Human Rights Watch, Reporters Without Borders, People In Need, the Committee to Protect Journalists, and Amnesty International, the latter of which designated him a prisoner of conscience. In 2015, the U.S. conferred the 2014 Human Rights Defender Award on Askarov. The Kyrgyz government protested this decision and formally terminated a 1993 agreement on cooperation between the U.S. and Kyrgyzstan. On 12 July 2016, the Supreme Court of Kyrgyzstan revoked the life sentence against Askarov and sent his case to the Chui Oblast Court for review."

The two later reported torture by security forces, including partial suffocation with a disconnected gas mask and beatings on the legs and heels. Human Rights Watch condemned the trial and stated that it \"appear[ed] to be a politically motivated effort to stop their human rights work\" in keeping with a recent pattern of suspicious charges against human rights workers. Front Line also described the arrests as politically motivated and \"part of an ongoing campaign against human rights defenders in Uzbekistan.\" Amnesty International also condemned the charges and called for the immediate release of Farmonov and Karamatov. Uzbekistani government officials, however, denied that the extortion charges were politically motivated. Both men were convicted and sentenced to nine years in prison. As of February 2010, Farmonov was currently serving his sentence at Yaslik \"severe regime\" prison camp in violation of his sentence, which called for a \"general regime\" camp. According to his wife, he has repeatedly been placed in a \"punishment cell,\" and on 8 January 2008, was stripped naked, handcuffed, and left in an unheated punishment cell for 23 days."

  "text" : "Henri Alfred Darjou, a French painter and draughtsman, born in Paris in 1832, was the son of Victor Darjou, a portrait painter of some ability. He studied under his father and under Léon Cogniet, and exhibited first at the Salon of 1853, from which time onwards he almost every year sent pictures which were for the most part of genre subjects. The paintings of Darjou have, however, done less for his reputation than the numerous designs which he made for the 'Illustration' and the 'Monde illustré.' He was also the designer of the front cover of the 1867-book 'Les Reves et les Moyens de les Diriger: Observations Pratiques' by Marquis d'Hervey de Saint-Denys. He died in Paris in 1874."

  "text" : "Alexey V. Postnikov (born 1939) is an internationally known specialist on the History of Science, with particular emphasis on the geography and cartography of Russia and these countries that have been under Russian influence from the 17th through the 20th centuries. He analyzed the development of Earth Sciences and Cartography in a broad social-cultural context. It reveals the limitation of Eurocetric approach by including the rich traditions of old Asian and American countries and people, as well as historical processes of their interaction and mutual influences with European geographical practices and theories. His work Mapping of Russian America: A History of Russian–American Contacts in Cartography is the most representative examples of this. Besides that fundamental monograph, the article Learning from Each Other – a History of Russian-native contacts in late Eighteenth - early Nineteenth Century Exploration and Mapping of Alaska and the Aleutian Islands in the International Hydrographic Review may be mentioned in this connection, whiсh deals with Native Americans' geographical data's use by Russian in Alaska and Aleutian Island. In addition to their value as fundamental research on the development of cosmographical and geographical ideas and methods in different periods of the human history, Prof. Postnikov's studies in the History of Science, are important research tools for historical geographers who deal with detailed studies of territorial aspects of changes in nature and society."

  "text" : "Alexx O'Nell (born Alexander Leonard O’Neill on July 26, 1980) is an American-born actor and musician who is based in India and has appeared in films and television programs in English and Indian languages. His major feature films include Cheeni Kum, Madrasapattinam, Urumi, Joker, Chittagong and Main Aur Charles. O'Nell began his acting career with community and regional theater in the United States, later working in television advertisements in India and internationally, and finally landing character roles and appearances in films such as the Hindi feature Cheeni Kum (2007) and the English feature Loins of Punjab Presents (2007). He later gained recognition as a contestant on the hugely popular Indian celebrity dance competition Nach Baliye (season 3, 2007). O'Nell's first leading role in a big-budget production came with Madrasapattinam (2010). Following Madrasapattinam, O'Nell returned to television to star in the Indian primetime historical drama Jhansi Ki Rani in mid-2010, and in early 2011 he also appeared in a guest role on the drama Dhoondh Legi Manzil Humein. Late 2011 saw the release of the Hindi Language feature Jo Dooba So Paar (2011) with O'Nell in a supporting role. After almost a year's gap, O'Nell was seen in a lead role in Shirish Kunder’s Joker (2012) followed shortly thereafter by a cameo in A. L. Vijay's Thaandavam (2012) released in late August and late September 2012 respectively. Finally, O'Nell starred in Bedabrata Pain's much awaited Chittagong (2012), released to overwhelming critical acclaim on October 12, 2012. Perhaps his most significant role to date, O'Nell appeared in a double-lead role in the multilingual Urumi (2011), (and the unreleased English-language Vasco Da Gama, (in which he plays a triple role)) directed by acclaimed Indian director Santosh Sivan. Urumi released in select markets (Malayalam, Tamil, Telugu) in 2011 and 2012 and remains the second most expensive and second highest grossing Malayalam film of all time. The stage of completion and expected release date for the English-language Vasco Da Gama are unknown. O'Nell's next releases were the much awaited Malayalam films Gangster and Manglish both featuring O'Nell alongside South-Indian superstar Mammootty releasing in April and July 2014, respectively. He appears in a cameo in the Suraj Sharma starrer Umrika, and enjoyed critical acclaim for his performance in director Prawaal Raman's \"Main Aur Charles\" (2015). Most recently O'Nell was seen in the 2016 release Ek Yodha Shoorveer, a Hindi dubbed and re-edited version of Urumi (2011). Following a high-profile relationship with Indian actress Sweta Keswani, O'Nell and Keswani were married in October and November 2008 in four different ceremonies. O'Nell and Keswani lived together in Mumbai, India until their separation in mid-2011."

Al-Qurmezi became famous in Bahrain and internationally after reading out a poem criticising Bahraini government policies to the Pearl Roundabout gathering of pro-democracy protesters. After the poem was widely circulated via social media she and her family were subjected to harassment and death threats. She was arrested and detained in conditions of secrecy, and rumours of her death in custody led to protests by Iranian activists. She was subjected to torture while in custody but was eventually tried on charges of inciting hatred of the Bahraini regime and insulting members of the royal family. International human rights organisations described her detention and trial as illustrating the brutality of the Bahraini authorities. She was sentenced to a term of imprisonment, which she was allowed to serve under house arrest."

  "text" : "Sven Axel Olaus Wallengren (originally Svensson) (26 January 1865, Lund – 4 December 1896, Berlin) was a Swedish author, poet, and journalist, who wrote under the nom de plume Falstaff, fakir. Wallengren was born in Lund where he would spend most of his short life. His father Mårten Svensson (1831-1898) was the poor son of a peasant who had managed to work his way up to a respectable position as a local civil servant, and his mother Olivia Wallengren (1842-1879) was the daughter of a clergyman. Although the latter died of tubercolosis when young Axel was only fourteen and his many siblings even younger, he seems to have had a fairly harmonious middle-class childhood. After having attended the local gymnasium Katedralskolan, Wallengren enrolled as a student at Lund University in 1883. At first he studied diligently and received a degree as Bachelor of Arts in 1886. After this he entered the faculty of law - probably mainly as a result of his father's ambitions - but from then on his literary and other interests would take the upper hand of him, and he never fulfilled this part of his education. Wallengren had begun developing his writing skills already as a schoolboy through \"Vala\", a literary society at his gymnasium. Originally mainly working as a poet he got his first poems published already as a teenager."

He did not often have a lead role but in the television drama Magic, he took the lead role as Duke."

He was born at Bridgwater, Somerset and died at Salisbury, Wiltshire. In first-class cricket, Westcott was a tail-end batsman and a very occasional bowler, though neither his batting nor his bowling style is known. He played once in 1894, four times in 1895 and then returned for a single match in 1902. In 11 first-class innings, he was not out six times, perhaps suggesting that he was a better batsman than he was given credit for. But his highest innings was just 14, made in the match against Surrey at The Oval in 1895, and he did not take a wicket in eight overs of bowling spread across three of his six games."

The library, established in 1926, is the largest dedicated to Latin America in the United States, and is part of the Perry-Castañeda Library, the country's fifth-largest academic library. Retired in 2008, Hartness was a member of the first broad generation of women to rise to professional academic leadership positions in the US. Hartness worked for 40 years at UT Austin, beginning as a serials cataloger in 1969. Her assistance has been acknowledged in original research by numerous scholars in the humanities and social sciences. Hartness’ focus on Brazil and collecting trips there helped make the UT library a global resource for study of that country. In 2003, Brazil named her a Commander of the National Order of the Southern Cross, the highest honor granted by that country to non-Brazilians. Hartness also directed the United States Library of Congress field office in Brazil in 1989-90."

His court was at Lis Castell (Lydstep) near Din Bych (Tenby); there may have been another at Castell Argoel (probably Caeth Argoel) in Dyfed, which was presumably named in his honor. He was a patron of the church at Llandaff and the bishops of Glywysing Saints Teilo and Euddogwy. He received Euddogwy's father King Budic II of Brittany after the latter was expelled from his land and was remembered by Gildas as a \"good king\".Aergol was known to be an enemy of King Cynan Garwyn of Powys and they clashed at Crug Dyfed."

He studied physics at Dagon University, where he became active in the pro-democracy group All Burma Federation of Student Unions (ABFSU). On 12 September 1998, he was arrested along with Myo Min Zaw for distributing fliers and organizing student demonstrations in Yangon. Both Aye Aung and Myo Min Zaw alleged that they were subsequently tortured in custody. At a press conference on 8 October 1998, the government announced that they had discovered a plot by Myo Min Zaw to “create disturbances in support of the National League for Democracy demand to convene parliament and to object to the ongoing university and college examinations”. Aye Aung and Myo Min Zaw were reportedly denied legal representation at their trial, which was held in Insein prison; Amnesty International also argued that the fairness of their trial was compromised by the press conference given by Burmese officials, in which they presumed the guilt of the two detainees. Both men were found guilty, and the court ordered that the sentences for each charge must be served cumulatively, rather than concurrently. As a result, Aye Aung was sentenced to a 59-year prison term, which he is currently serving in Kale prison in Burma's northwestern Sagaing Region; Myo Min Zaw was sentenced to 52 years. The Assistance Association for Political Prisoners has alleged that conditions of Aye Aung's imprisonment are poor. In January 2005, his family reported that he was suffering from malaria, which was being worsened by prison officials denying him blankets in the winter. His mother stated that he was also suffering from gastric disease and severe back pain due to prison conditions. In January 2012, Myo Min Zaw and dozens of other political prisoners were released in a general amnesty. However, Aye Aung remained imprisoned without an official statement on his case. Aye Aung was released on 3 July 2012."

  "text" : "Anthony Barboza (born 1944 in New Bedford, Massachusetts) is an African-American photographer, historian, artist and writer. With roots originating from Cape Verde, and work that began in commercial art more than forty years ago, Barboza’s artistic talents and successful career helped him to cross over and pursue his passions in the fine arts where he continues to contribute to the American art scene. Barboza has a prolific and wide range of both traditional and innovative works inspired by African-American thought, which have been exhibited in public and private galleries, and prestigious museums and educational institutions worldwide. He is well known for his photographic work of jazz musicians from the 1970s – '80s. Many of these works are in his book Black Borders, published in 1980 with a grant from the National Endowment for the Arts. In an article printed in 1984 in The City Sun, he said, \"When I do a portrait, I’m doing a photograph of how that person feels to me; how I feel about the person, not how they look. I find that in order for the portraits to work, they have to make a mental connection as well as an emotional one. When they do that, I know I have it.\" Many of his photographs achieve his signature effect through the careful use of lighting and shadows, manipulation of the backdrop, measured adjustments to shutter speeds, composition, and many other techniques and mediums at his command. His most recent conceptual photographic artwork exhibit, Black Dreams/White Sheets, has toured internationally and was shown for the first time in New York City at the Bill Hodges Gallery in November and December 2010. Barboza takes a critical look at the role and experiences of the African Diaspora in the historical as well as contemporary context of race, sexuality, gender, politics, and social issues in American society and culture."

  "text" : "Antonio Goicoechea (21 January 1876, Barcelona – 11 February 1953, Madrid) was an Alfonsine monarchist in Spain during the period of the Second Spanish Republic and the Spanish Civil War. He briefly served as Minister of the Interior from 15 April 1919 to 20 July 1919 in a Maura cabinet. He led the Renovación Española political party. Prior to the Civil War, Goicoechea in 1934 had negotiated alongside with Carlist monarchists Antonio Lizarza Iribarren and Rafael de Olazábal y Eulate with Italian dictator Benito Mussolini on a military agreement that would guarantee Italian support of their movements should a civil war erupt in Spain. However, when the Civil War did erupt in 1936, it had not been initiated by Goicoechea or other members of the agreement, but rather a group of army officers, thus Goicoechea's agreement with Mussolini did not go forward. After Falange Española Tradicionalista y de las Juntas de Ofensiva Nacional Sindicalista emerged in 1937, Goicoechea dissolved Renovación Española and worked as Governor of the Bank of Spain (from 1938 to 1950) and Procurador en Cortes (representative of the Francoist legislature)."

Scott. His career began in the early days of live television (1962) at the local level as a director for the Westinghouse Broadcasting Company, WBZ-TV Boston. Subsequently, he was an Oscar nominee (1966) for his documentary film The Face of a Genius, an autobiographical study of America’s famed playwright, Eugene O’Neill. It marked the first time in the history of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences that a film originally produced for television was recognized by the Academy as a nominee for Best Documentary Feature. A mass communications graduate scholar (1959) studying public opinion at Boston University under the aegis of WGBH, a Senior Research Fellow at the MIT Center for International Studies, he also served as a principal of Medcom (1968), a publicly traded company and pioneer of the learning industry in the dissemination of medical knowledge to physicians and the public. As producer, director, and co-creator of the groundbreaking CBS documentary series The Body Human (1977), a cinematic exploration of the relationship between biochemistry, medicine and human behavior, he opened the door to Lifeline, a documentary television series on NBC. Kelman is a three-time winner of the Directors Guild of America Award for Outstanding Documentary Feature and a seven-time Emmy winner for Lifeline and The Body Human. One of the few documentary film makers who moved from nonfiction to a 25-year career as a producer of films and miniseries for television."

  "text" : "Atsiri Thammachot, winner of the Southeast Asian Writers Award in 1981 for the short story Khun-Thong you will return at dawn, was born on 10 July 1947 in the Hua Hin district of Prachuap Khiri Khan to a family that fished the waters of the Gulf of Thailand for a living. He attended school in Hua Hin until his father lost his fishing boat at sea, at which point the family mortgaged the house and land so that the father could purchase another one, which he then lost at sea soon after. Before entering study in the department of Communication Arts at Chulalongkorn University in 2513 (1970), and after finishing up his secondary education in Bangkok, a brief biography in khɔ̀ɔp fáa thá-lee kwâaŋ notes that Thammachot worked for the National Statistics Office (NSO) in the provinces of Sakon Nakhon, Nakhon Phanom, and Phetchabun for two years, which is noted to be a time that allowed him to become informed of the problems facing communities in rural areas. Part of the reason for his going to work for the NSO were the difficult financial circumstances his family was confronting with respect to the fishery bringing in insufficient income. In the prelude to his work, dèk phûu-jǐŋ khon kɛ̀ɛ mɛɛw lɛ́? phǒm, it is noted that while surveying for the NSO Thammachot went to villages with three hundred households or more, where beyond fulfilling his role of collecting data for the census he was able to communicate with household members on a variety of subjects, gaining first-hand accounts to learn of the particular challenges and obstacles facing these groups of people, and building up a more well defined sense of life in Isan and the north. Marcel Barang writes that the period Thammachot spent working for the NSO in the Northeast and North exposed him to the “hotbeds of communist insurgency” that were prevalent in the late 1960s, and that during this time he started to drink, began to have an interest in politics, and kept records of his experiences that later functioned as a foundation for his future literary projects. Barang further notes that the 1972 work, An old man’s memories (sǎm-nʉ́k khɔ̌ɔŋ phɔ̂ɔ thâw), was the first of his short stories, and was based in large part on the experiences he had acquired while living in the Northeast. When Thammachot completed his secondary school education in Bangsue north of Bangkok, he attempted to study in the department of Political Science at Chulalongkorn but failed to gain admission. However, after working for the NSO, he was accepted into the department of Public Relations and Mass Communications at Chulalongkorn. He began writing when he was an undergraduate student; for the short story An old man’s memories, noted above, he received third place in the competition for the prize phláp phlaam maa-lii in 2515 (1972) from the ‘Chulalongkorn Literary Assembly’. After university, he went to work for two to three newspapers and attempted, without much success, to publish books about cinema. In 2517 (1974) he worked as a newsman for Siamrath and became a regular editor for the newspaper’s entertainment page; however, during the 1980s he was a regular columnist for Siamrath, and additionally assisted editors in choosing articles and letters to publish in the newspaper. Atsiri Thammachot still writes articles for Siamrath, and his pieces appear periodically in the form of editorials. In a discussion provided by a literary analysis group following the stories in the collection bâan rim thá-lee it is noted that Thammachot’s employment at the newspaper constrains the opportunities he has to write short stories, but at the same time, his role working in news media adds to his creative capacity through the perspective of one who is an observer (paraphrasing from Thai). As for the themes that motivate his creative works, Thammachot remarks that he aims to have people in Thai society understand the lives of one another, especially the ‘small lives’ that exist at the fringes of society in Thailand. He says further that if he is able to accomplish this, regardless of how much or little this goal is met, people will be able to establish love and understanding and will be able to help and assist one another. In the collection of short stories bâan rim thá-lee a discussion following the texts by the Literary Analysis Group (klùm waan-ná-kaam phí-nít) provides outlines of the rhetorical character and central themes that emerge in Thammachoat’s work. Noting that his stories use language to generate a soft rhythm, the discussion points out that in almost all of Thammachot’s stories, the concept of pleasure and enjoyment (khwaam-rʉ̂ʉn-rom) as a guiding theme in the plot is absent. Recognizing that there are definite trends of sorrow, the Group also notes, however, that the central themes of his work do not concentrate on or suggest a loss of hope. Rather, concepts such as coming to an understanding of the realities of certain conditions, gaining new knowledge, and uncovering the beauty that hides in life’s small things (paraphrasing from Thai) appear in his work. The use of such ideas implies a sense of introducing a moral direction, which is aimed to educate the reader in some way. In comparison with his short stories, his novels are said to bear a lot of similarities in terms of main ideas; however, the novels contain significantly more description and attention to individual details. For example, plots concentrating on people who earn a livelihood from the sea tend to show up amid changing economic and environmental circumstances owing to forces beyond their control in both types of work. Marcel Barang sums up Thammachot’s literary contributions as focusing on “the plight of the common man”"

She is regarded as a pioneer and one of the key members in the development of the Dutch fashion climate since the 1990s.[1] In 1998 Westerhof was asked by the Arnhem Academy of Art and Design (ArtEZ) to set up the one year fashion master course Fashion Institute Arnhem (FIA) together with fashion illustrator Pieter ‘t Hoen, also known as Piet Paris. Westerhof and ‘t Hoen both had a large network in the international fashion industry and strived to set up contacts between young, talented designers and the international fashion scene. The Fashion Institute Arnhem’s focus lay abroad, with workshops in several countries by leading professionals and a graduation show in Paris attended by the international fashion press.[3] In 2000 Westerhof observed that fashion designers who had graduated from the Fashion Institute Arnhem had difficulties presenting their collection to a wider audience, set up their own fashion labels and find a connection with the fashion industry on their own. She established the Dutch Fashion Foundation in 2001 to develop the status of Dutch fashion as a collective discipline in the Netherlands and abroad.[2][4]"

He was expelled from the University of the North (now known as University of Limpopo) in 1972 for his political activities and he became involved in the Black Consciousness Movement in 1973. After his expulsion from the then University of the North in 1972, following his scathing critique of the Bantu Education Act of 1953, he went on to teach at Morris Isaacson High School near and around Central Western Jabavu (CWJ) in Soweto. This same school attended by Tsietsi Mashinini, who was an integral part of the 1976 student uprising. It is possible that, in some way, it was at Morris Isaacson where Tiro introduced the philosophy of the Black Consciousness Movement to the students and thereby, starting a campaign to encourage students to question Bantu Education."

  "text" : "Anita Parkhurst Willcox (1892–1984) was an American artist, feminist and pacifist. Her career as a graphic illustrator was interrupted by 15 months spent entertaining the troops in World War I, which left her passionately anti-war. During the 1920s, she gained fame for drawing \"the New American Woman\" image, but this contradicted her personal experiences as wife and mother. By the 1930s, she drew images that reflected her own life and beliefs. She was inspired by Gandhi’s non-violence, and in Mao's China; but met rejection and censorship during the McCarthy era. Despite this, she continued painting until her death in 1984."

He allied himself with Florence and the Visconti Family in Milan. After Gabrielli of Gubbio unsuccessfully plotted against him, he obtained the lordship of that city, being confirmed as its Papal vicar by Benedict IX. In 1391, while warring against the Malatesta, Antonio captured the castle of Sassoferrato and Cantiano. He had his son Guidantonio married with Ringarda Malatesta and her daughter Gentile to the lord of Faenza. He died in 1404, after fleeing Urbino during a plague.

Wartime meant that the set-piece Eton v Harrow cricket match normally held at Lord's was not played, and Sanders did not do well in the two one-day school matches arranged in the 1918 season between Harrow and Eton College. He played in just one first-class match, batting at No 9 for Somerset in the match against Essex at Leyton and failing to score in his only innings in the match. His death barely a year later and before the age of 20 went unrecorded in Wisden Cricketers' Almanack."

Riley was born in Paddington, London, and attended Pembroke College, Oxford where obtained his BA 1881 and MA 1883. Active in the Anglo-Catholic wing of the Church of England, he energised the development of the English Hymnal and was chairman of its editorial board. His best known hymn is Ye Watchers and Ye Holy Ones. He also created an English adaption of the eucharistic hymn O Esca Viatorum. In later life he moved to Jersey in the Channel Islands, where he purchased Trinity Manor in 1909, thereby acquiring the feudal title of Seigneur de La Trinité. Finding the manor house in a ruined condition, he undertook an elaborate restoration (or \"imaginative reconstruction\", which has been criticised as turning the building into a French style château). The reconstruction was carried out 1910-1913 by C. Messervy to designs by Sir Reginald Blomfield. Athelstan Riley bought the historic property L'Ancienneté in Saint Brélade, and removed architectural features of interest to incorporate into Trinity Manor, carefully recording the provenance of items and nature of alterations made in his project.He remained in Jersey through the German occupation, and died shortly after its liberation."

He mentioned that Van Gogh was not very strong, and so this was a very melancholy circumstance. In several letters over the remainder of the year, Bonger comments on a growing appreciation for and friendship with Theo. Vincent van Gogh arrived in Paris in 1886 which meant that Bonger saw less of Theo. Bonger expressed his concern that Vincent van Gogh was harsh with his brother Theo, who had begun to look haggard. Theo met Bonger's parents during a visit to the Netherlands about August, 1886. Bonger went into the insurance business later in Amsterdam. He was an intimate friend of Bertrand-Jean Redon, better known as Odilon Redon, and owned a large collection of his works. His collection also included works by Van Gogh, Paul Cézanne and Émile Bernard, whom he knew well. He is buried at Zorgvlied cemetery."

  "text" : "Dr. Agnes Murgoci (1875-1929), née Kelly, was an English zoologist and folklorist. Born in Adelaide, South Australia, the daughter of Adam Kelly, formerly of Glasgow, and Helen Beveridge, she graduated from Bedford College in 1896, obtained first class honours in zoology, and a PhD from the University of Munich. She married Gheorghe Munteanu-Murgoci, a Romanian professor of mineralogy and moved to Bucharest. She published articles on the folklore of her new home, especially early studies on vampirism, and a book, Rumania and the Rumanians . Her works appeared in the journal of the Folklore Society. \"The Life of Dr Agnes Murgoci\" by Juliu Moisil \"People's destinies follow unknown and mysterious ways. They allow people from across the world to meet one another and raise families whose descendants turn out as gifted members who benefit mankind.While studying at the University of Munich for her Ph.D. Miss Agnes Kelly met Gheorghe Munteanu Murgoci also working for his doctor's degree in mineralogy and geology and some time later they married. Mrs Agnes Murgoci, a scholar (she was the first woman to whom the University of Munich awarded its Doctorate of Philosophy) was also a thoughtful and loving wife and mother. She became a Romanian by marriage and lived in Bucharest. She came to know the Romanian people and their history and was a strenuous and ardent worker, a real pioneer in Romania's cause abroad. She was born in Adelaide, Australia, where her father Adam Kelly the youngest of twelve children had emigrated from Scotland in 1840. He took an active part in setting up a new colony there. Her mother, Helen Beveridge, came from a distinguished family in Dunfermline, Scotland.In 1879 Agnes Kelly and her mother left Adelaide and went back to Scotland, to the beautiful town of Dollar. She went to a junior school and then to the Dollar Academy. In both these schools she got high qualifications and also a scholarship to Bedford College in London. Later she won the St Dunstan's Medical Scholarship. At the University College in London she won a 'Weldon Gold Medal' in zoology and a scholarship. She took her Bachelor of Science degree with 'honours'. She then went to Munich University where she took her Ph.D. 'summa cum laude. Next she travelled to Australia and New Zealand because she had been asked by the English Board of Education to write a report on education there. She returned through North America where she studied and lectured on the English educational system. Before her marriage she also taught at King Edward VIII High School in Birmingham. Dr Agnes Kelly and Professor Gheorghe Murgoci were married in 1904 in London and went on a long and interesting journey travelling through United States as far as San Francisco and seeing most beautiful places such as Yellowstone National Park, Yosemite Valley in California and Niagara waterfall. They went to Romania and settled in Bucharest in a house which they had built with many lovely Romanian art objects in very good taste. A recognised authority on various people's folklore and national art Mrs Murgoci quickly got to know and value the beauty of Romanian culture. She both helped her husband with his scientific works and made notes on Romanian customs which she came across in her travels in Romania. The Romanian Boy Scouts Organization had its origin in the English branch and Mrs Murgoci took a great interest in it and advised in its development. In 1916 Mrs Murgoci and her children, Helen and Radu, went to England for educational reasons and settled down in Bristol. During her stay there she made Bristol a very important centre for information on Romanian culture. She wrote many an article on Romanian folklore, and lectured on Romania in many towns such as London, Hull, Glasgow, Cardiff, and many others. Her husband's early death in 1925 left a great gap which she tried to fill by working steadily for her children's education and also for the cause of Romania and its folklore. Meanwhile, she found her children's academic achievements a real support. Helen read medicine at Bristol University and Radu had won a scholarship to Cambridge and was reading physics. She went on doing further research on Romanian folklore and her articles on it were of great interest for the School of Ethnology in England led by Professor Percy and Prof. Elliot Smith from the University College of London. This encouraged her to carry on still further in her research. Here are the lectures she held in England. The Romanian PeasantChristmas in RomaniaFestivals in RomaniaWomen in RomaniaWomen before the lawThe Case for BassarabiaAgarian Reform in RomaniaThe Religion of the Romanian PeasantReligions in RomaniaMinorities in RomaniaSalt signs in RomaniaRobert Burns - Scottish PoetWestermark - history of human marriageHere is a list of articles published in the Folklore magazine in LondonRomanian Easter EggsGuarding the DeadWashing the DeadWatching the DeadThe Vampire in RomaniaSilk Worms in Romanian folklore.

Taking her advice many English scholars including Professor Sir William Craigie, Prof. Sydney Chapman paid visits to Romania in order to know it better Prof. Jervis took lantern slides and wrote a commentary on Romanian beauties and riches which he made available for use by 'Teachers Geographical Association'. Mrs Murgoci together with her daughter Miss Helen Murgoci, doctor of Medicine put on many exhibitions with Romanian exhibits of peasants' craftsmanship and paintings in Bristol, Swanwick and Reading. She also lectured on Romania's behalf under the supervision of the League of Nations Union, the Workers Educational Association and the English Board of Education. She helped many Romanians to be registered at Bristol and Oxford Universities. Mrs Murgoci's future plans were to travel to Australia and North America and lecture on Romania for the International Federation of University Women We deeply regret the death of Mrs Murgoci who was killed in a motor accident in the Isle of Wight on May 7th 1929.\" She left behind a daughter, Helen Beveridge, the wife of Revd. Hugh Gerard Gibson Herklots, and a son, Radu Maxwell Murgoci, a noted Physicist."

  "text" : "Albert Randolph Ross (October 26, 1868 – October 27, 1948) was an American architect. Born in Westfield, Massachusetts, he was a son of architect John W. Ross. Albert Ross attended grammar school in Westfield and later in Davenport, Iowa, where he went on to high school, finishing in 1884. After working as a draughtsman in his father's Davenport architecture office from 1884 to 1887, he spent a year working for an architect in Buffalo, New York, before joining the New York City firm of McKim, Mead and White in 1891. After leaving that firm in 1897, he started the firm of Ackerman and Ross, which operated from 1898 to 1901. In 1927, when he was awarded a $10,000 prize in a competition to design a new courthouse for Milwaukee out of 33 who submitted proposals, he told the Milwaukee Journal why he settled on a traditional design: When I went into the competition I considered whether to design a building in the modern and experimental trend for a great public courthouse. I made modern sketches, but in my opinion they fell flat for this purpose. They were not typical and expressive of public work, so I turned to that type established by our forefathers.... I have no quarrel with trends in modern architecture. I take a fling at it myself. But it simply won't do for public buildings. It violates the dictates of a definite style built up through one hundred and fifty years of our history. A departure into modernism would not be suitable for a courthouse. We must be trained slowly to things violently new. The public's money cannot rightly be used to force experiments down its throat. In 1901, Ross married Susan Husted, from Brookline, Massachusetts. From 1901 until 1948 his main residence was on Negro Island, near Boothbay Harbor, Maine. He died October 27, 1948."

He along with his late wife, Georgette Wasserstein Levis, is the innkeeper of the Wilburton Inn, also in Manchester. Levis was born in 1937 to a Romaniote Jewish family in Athens, Greece. After surviving the Holocaust in hiding, Levis continued his studies at Athens College and then proceeded to the University of Zurich and the University of Lausanne for medical training. He completed his psychiatric residency at Yale, before starting an independent clinical research and training center, The Center for the Study of Normative Behavior, in Hamden, Connecticut. Levis is best known for his Formal Theory, an integrative approach to behavioral analysis and personality assessment. The Formal Theory seeks to qualify the physical properties of behavior through applying principles of Physics to the study of emotional energetic transformation. Levis has published several volumes on this research, including Conflict Analysis: The Formal Theory of Behavior and Conflict Analysis Training. Levis' Conflict Analysis Training includes among other tests the Animal Metaphor Test, an integrative projective assessment. Therapeutic care and self-help modules based around the Formal Theory have been instituted in a variety of domestic and international settings. These modules emphasizes the use of creativity as a guide towards self-discovery and as a tool for insight and behavior modification. Levis also holds a wide collection of international and modern art, pieces that are now installed in the permanent exhibits at the Museum of the Creative Process. Additionally, the Museum features the Henry Gorski retrospective, a collection of the lifetime work of Gorski, as well as the Sanctuary of Wisdom, Levis' Holocaust memorial. Many items from the museum's collections have been featured in museums and gallery exhibits around the New England region."

  "text" : "Ahmed Hassan Barata is a Nigerian politician who was elected to the Adamawa South Senatorial seat in Adamawa State, Nigeria in the April 2011 federal elections. He ran for election on the People's Democratic Party (PDP) platform. Barata was elected to the House of Representatives for the Guyuk/Shelleng constituency in May 1999; he served until May 2003.He competed for reelection for that constituency in April 2007 but was defeated by James Audu Kwawo of the Action Congress. Barata won the PDP nomination for the 2011 Adamawa South Senatorial race in a primary election. He received 738 votes, defeating the incumbent Senator Grace Folasade Bent, who had received 406.Bent, who was said to have been favored by the PDP party leadership, later claimed that she had won a rerun primary.While her assertion was being reviewed, a judge ordered the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to remove Barata's name from the list of candidates and replace it with Bent.Bent's claim was later rejected by the INEC, by the Federal High Court, Abuja and by the PDP's counsel. In the 9 April 2011 elections, Barata won with 101,760 votes, ahead of Mohammed Koiraga Jada of the Action Congress of Nigeria (ACN) with 66,525 votes."

Umbra Kato was the Philippines' most wanted man though due to his still official membership in the MILF he was not hunted by the military. However a warrant of arrest was filed against him together with other BIFF members by the Philippine National Police. The Armed Forces of the Philippines, with the MILF, launched Operation Darkhorse in a bid to arrest him in January 2014. Kato reportedly died on 14 April 2015 of a heart attack. BIFF spokesperson Abu Misry Mama, confirmed his death after he was informed by Kato's son that he died at 2:00 am due to complications from pneumonia. He was reported to have died in Barangay Kateman in Guindulungan, Maguindanao but this was denied by the barangay chairman."

A brilliant disciple of Sergey Platonov, he published several important studies of medieval Russia, including Princely Law in Old Rus (1909), The Tsardom of Muscovy (1918), and The Development of the State of Great Russia (1918). He opposed Platonov in admitting the distinct nature of the medieval Lithuanian statehood. After the Russian Revolution Presnyakov authored the revisionist biographies of Alexander I and Nicholas I. He helped establish and run the Institute of Historical Studies, a branch of the Petrograd University, and managed the Leningrad branch of the RANION History Institute. It was shortly after Presnyakov's death that his mentor Platonov, as well as their disciples, faced persecution from the government. His library was acquired by the Columbia University in 1931."

  "text" : "Avinash Veeraraghavan is a contemporary Indian artist who draws on his interest in the visual language of popular culture and digital imaging to create graphic books, layered prints, and multichannel video installations. His interest in visuals extends to images of all kinds, from photographs, patterns in print and textiles, wallpaper patterns, wrapping paper to motifs taken from different cultures. Veeraraghavan has been involved with the practice of image construction through meticulously manipulated digital images that are skilfully layered and juxtaposed to open up new possibilities of meaning. The complex visual collages reflect a deep-rooted and often manic exploration of the structure of emotions and the interstices of the mind. In 2011 his work was part of a two-person show titled Crazy Jane and Jack the Journeyman at Galerie Krinzinger in Vienna. His work has been selected to be shown at the Prague Biennale in 2011 in a section titled, Crossroads: India Escalate. Previously Veeraraghavan has participated in many Indian and international shows including Indian Highway, Herning Museum of Contemporary Art, Denmark (2010) and Astrup Fearnley Museum of Modern Art, Oslo (2009); Still Moving Image, curated by Deeksha Nath, Devi Art Foundation, New Delhi; Post Visual World, curated by Gitanjali Dang, Priyasri Gallery, Mumbai, both in 2008. I Fear, I Believe, I Desire, curated by Gayatri Sinha at Gallery Espace, New Delhi (2007); Urban Manners, curated by Adelina von Furstenberg, Art For The World at Hangar Bicocca, Milan (2007); Watching Me, Watching India, curated by Gayatri Sinha and Celina Lunsford, Fotografie Forum international & Kommunale Galerie, Frankfurt (2006); Around Architecture, curated by Marta Jakimowicz, Colab, Bangalore (2006); Indian Summer, curated by Henri Claude Cousseau, Deepak Ananth and Jany Lauga, Ecole des Beaux Arts, Paris (2005); Dispelling Asian Stereotypes, Public Art Project, Denmark (2004); City Park, Project Arts Centre, Dublin (2003).

  "text" : "Adolf von Bomhard (born 6 January 1891 in Augsburg – 19 July 1976) was an SS-Gruppenführer and Generalleutnant of the Ordnungspolizei in the German Third Reich. In the post-war era he was Bürgermeister of Prien am Chiemsee. During the First World War, Bomhard saw service as an officer in the Bavarian Army, eventually finishing the war as adjutant to Franz Ritter von Epp. Bomhard would later write and publish the history of his regiment. Bomhard was sent to Kiev in November 1942 to succeed Otto von Oelhafen as head of police in Reichskommissariat Ukraine. Bomhard followed the same path as his predecessor of integrating police operations with the murderous activities of the SS in the area. Holding the role until October 1943, Bomhard took an important role in ideological instruction of the Ukrainian police in the Nazi Weltanschauung. After the Second World War Bomhard served between 1960 and 1966 as mayor of Prien am Chiemsee and received honorary citizenship there in 1971. He was also involved in societies for former members of the police."

Her family moved to Germany in the 1920s. She graduated from the University of Tübingen in 1939 [verify] with an MD. Shortly after graduating, she worked with Hans Krueger under the guidance of Ehrenfried Pfeiffer to develop Pfeiffer's medical diagnostic technique based on interpreting crystal formations of blood mixed in a copper chloride solution[1] - also known as biocrystallization. She was so successful in this field that she set up a private practice which thrived until her death in 1992. She maintained that blood crystallisation belonged to the \"science of the future\" based more on intuition than on strictly repeatable, clinical trial studies. She also developed homeopathic treatment regimens based on certain metals, many of which had properties described in mythological stereotypes (for example, gold, the metal of Apollo, the sun god, was used to treat the heart, the \"sun\" of the body). In addition to her contributions to medical science, Alla Selawry wrote a number a theological books, including Perpetual Prayer of the Heart, a biography of John of Kronstadt, and an unfinished book on virtues and vices. Alla Selawry died on 27 July 1992 in Stuttgart, Germany, and was survived by her brother Oleg Selawry, and his children Mark and Lubov."

She was active in athletics in the 1970s and 1980s. In the early 1970s she represented the club Lillehammer IF. She won a bronze medal in javelin throw at the Norwegian Championships in 1972. Later representing the club IL i BUL, she set a personal best in the shot put in July 1977 in Moelv, with 12.54 metres. She later represented the club Heimdal IF. She achieved 32.40 metres in the discus throw in June 1978 in Stjørdal, and 47.72 in the javelin throw (old type) in July 1983 in Trondheim.

In 2011 she was suggested by the election committee for a spot on the board of the Norwegian Olympic and Paralympic Committee and Confederation of Sports. At the Confederation's national convention, however, the politicking went against the wishes of the Norwegian Athletics Association and others, and Hunstad withdrew her candidacy. In politics, she was a member of Trondheim city council from 1991 to 2003 and Sør-Trøndelag county council from 2007 to 2011. She was a municipal commissioner from 1999 to 2003, and in 2003 she was hired as a political adviser for the city's mayor Rita Ottervik.

He began his career as a staff writer at the Chicago Times, and eventually became editor of the Chicago Times-Herald. During the late 19th century, he wrote muckraker articles for Cosmopolitan. As an investigative journalist, Lewis wrote extensively about corruption in New York politics. This was the subject of his book The Boss, and How He Came to Rule New York, which focused on the Tammany Hall society of the 18th century. He also wrote biographies of Irish-American politician Richard Croker (1843–1922), and of Andrew Jackson (1767–1845), seventh President of the United States. As a writer of genre fiction, his most successful works were in his Wolfville series of Western fiction, which he continued writing until he died of gastrointestinal disease in 1914."

Taddesse Tamrat notes that \"from the great number of translations attributed to him, Salama was no doubt the greatest Egyptian bishop Ethiopia ever had\" as well as pointing out he \"was on very good terms with even the most militant monastic leaders of Ethiopia at the time.\" A land grant in Arabic to Istifanos Monastery dated Bashans 7, 1091 Year of the Martyrs (= 3 May AD 1375) was likely the work of Abuna Salama. Tadesse Tamrat considers this \"additional confirmation for the great influence and prestige which Abuna Salama enjoyed in the country at the time.\""

Among the policy papers drafted by the Marxist movement, Anuradha had contributed significantly to the ones on castes and 'Feminism and Marxism'. She made the guerillas realise the potential of worker cooperatives in areas like agricultural production, in Dhandakaranya. She was also critical on shifting patriarchal ideas that were then dominant in the party. Jyoti Punwani wrote “The ‘Naxalite menace’, says Manmohan Singh, 'is the biggest threat to the country'. But I remember a girl who was always laughing and who gave up a life rich in every way to change the lives of others.” In her obituary for Anuradha, with whom she was friends from the days when the latter was still a college student in the 1970s."

  "text" : "Adam Stone is the founder, owner and publisher of Examiner Media, a Mt. Kisco, NY-based publishing company started in 2007. Examiner Media launched The Examiner, its first print newspaper, on September 11 of 2007. Initially, the newspaper covered two municipalities, Pleasantville and Mt. Kisco, but soon grew its coverage area. The town of New Castle and its hamlets, Chappaqua and Millwood, were added to The Examiner's territory in 2008. Soon after the publication began to circulate across the Town of Mt. Pleasant, in Thornwood, Valhalla and Hawthorne, along with the Village of Briarcliff and later North Castle's hamlets, Armonk, North White Plains and Banksville. The Examiner's coverage area was previously served by the Patent Trader, which the Gannett Company shut down in 2007, making room for Stone's venture. In March 2009, Stone launched a second newspaper, The Putnam Examiner. At first, the newspaper only covered the Mahopac-Carmel area but quickly grew into a Putnam countywide publication. Later in 2009, in December, Stone debuted his third title, The Yorktown Examiner. That edition also expanded shortly after its launch and was renamed The Northern Westchester Examiner in April 2011. It now covers not only Yorktown, but also Peekskill, Cortlandt, Croton-on-Hudson, Buchanan, Ossining, Somers, and other area hamlets. Also in 2011, Examiner Media began enhancing its online efforts, converting www.TheExaminerNews.com from a static company information website and into a platform to publish breaking news and guest columns from top local bloggers. Later in 2011, in August, The White Plains Examiner was launched. The company's fourth print publication covers the City of White Plains, Westchester's county seat, and is also distributed in surrounding towns, most notably Greenburgh and Harrison. The contiguous communities also receive coverage in The White Plains Examiner, though White Plains receives the most attention. Stone's Twitter feed - @examinerstone - is one of the most closely monitored news feeds in the region. The company also operates an Examiner Media Facebook page. Stone studied journalism at Hofstra University, earning a degree in print journalism in 2001. During school, he worked as a reporter/fact-checker at Time Inc.'s People magazine through the American Society of Magazine Editor's internship program. Stone also interned at Newsday, Times Herald-Record and the now-defunct P.O.V. magazine. At Hofstra, Stone was instrumental in launching the university's student magazine, The Communicator. After graduating from Hofstra in 2001, Stone worked as a reporter for the former weeklies division of The Journal News, serving as a Peekskill beat writer for The Star, which since folded. After leaving The Journal News, Stone worked briefly as a reporter in the Sullivan County bureau at Times Herald-Record. After leaving that job, Stone was hired by the former North County News, covering Ossining and later Croton during his nearly four-year stint. Stone's news and sports reporting were recognized with several rewards from the New York Press Association, including a Writer of the Year award. After leaving North County News Stone began freelance writing in 2007, publishing with The New York Times, The New York Daily News, among others. In April 2011, Stone was named by Editor & Publisher magazine as one of North America's \"25 Under 35,\" honoring him as one of the industry's top young journalists. Early the following year, at the start of 2012, Stone teamed up with Pleasantville public access station PCTV, launching Examiner Media's weekly local civic affairs television program, Examiner News Talk. In June of 2012 the Business Council of Westchester presented Stone and 39 other young professionals in the county with its Rising Stars 40 Under 40 award at a ceremony at MasterCard Worldwide in Purchase. Stone grew up in Port Washington, on Long Island. He now lives in Mount Kisco with his wife Alyson and daughter Madeleine."

This independent feature was the first film to be entirely shot with an HDSLR camera. Originally, Ajay auditioned for the small role of a news reporter, only to be offered a leading role as a music producer. The script was, in turn, rewritten for him to play this role. Two US national commercials for The Hartford, and Subway (restaurant) were to follow in his blossoming acting career. His dream is to, one day, be able to work with his idol, for most of his life, Al Pacino. His passion for the industry has since grown immensely and he decided he didn't want to restrict himself to just acting, realising his potential as a producer. The finance background obviously helped a great deal with this and in 2010, he formed Khando Entertainment in London."

  "text" : "Agnes Bertha Marshall (24 August 1855 - 29 July 1905) was an English culinary entrepreneur. She became a leading cookery writer in the Victorian period, and was dubbed the \"Queen of Ices\" for her works on ice cream and other frozen desserts. In time before practical domestic refrigeration, her success increased the demand in London for ice imported from Norway. Her 1888 cookery book included a recipe for \"cornets with cream\", possibly the earliest publication of the edible ice cream cone. Marshall was born in Walthamstow. Her father, John Smith, was a clerk, but died when she was young and his widow, Susan, remarried. Marshall's early life remains obscure, but it was later written in the Pall Mall Gazette that she studied cooking from an early age, and \"practised at Paris and with Vienna's celebrated chefs\". She married Alfred William Marshall in 1878. She wrote four books: Ices Plain and Fancy: The Book of Ices (1885), Mrs. A.B. Marshall's Book of Cookery (1888), Mrs. A.B. Marshall's Larger Cookery Book of Extra Recipes (1891) and Fancy Ices (1894). She also gave public lectures on cooking, and ran an agency for domestic staff. She was granted a patent for an improved ice cream machine that could freeze a pint of ice cream in five minutes, and also suggested using liquid nitrogen to make ice cream. With her husband, she established the Marshall School of Cookery in Mortimer Street in 1883, and published a weekly magazine, The Table, from 1886. The couple also sold cooking supplies and equipment. She fell from a horse in 1904 and never fully recovered. She died in Pinner the following year, and was cremated at Golders Green crematorium. After her death, the rights to her books were sold to Mrs Beeton's publisher, Ward Lock. Her husband took over the business that they had run together, but it failed. Unlike Mrs Beeton, Marshall quickly faded from public memory. A biography was published in 1998 entitled Mrs Marshall: the Greatest Victorian Ice Cream Maker, including a facsimile of her 1885 Book of Ices."

During this period, she’s become a Knight Fellow, a New York Times Fellow, an Age Boom Fellow (Columbia University School of Journalism) and a fellow at the Yale Law School's Information Society Project. She is also the voice of Yo, Is This Ageist? Since 2012, Applewhite has been speaking widely about how ageism makes aging in America so much harder than it has to be, as well as about the medicalization of old age, ageism and elder abuse, and the effects of ageism on women’s lives. She has been recognized as an expert on ageism by the New York Times, National Public Radio, and the American Society on Aging. In 2015 she was included in a list of 100 inspiring women who are committed to social change—along with Arundhati Roy, Aung Sang Suu Kyi, Germaine Greer, Naomi Klein, Pussy Riot, and other remarkable activists—in the inaugural issues of Salt magazine. Applewhite is the author of Cutting Loose: Why Women Who End Their Marriages Do So Well and other books. Under the pseudonym Blanche Knott, she is the author of the Truly Tasteless Jokes series, the first volume of which was the biggest-selling mass-market book of 1983, and was the first woman to have four books on the New York Times best-seller list. Applewhite's memoir, \"Being Blanche\" was published in Harper's Magazine in June 2011. Her anti-ageism manifesto will be published by OR Books in 2015. She is a liaison to the board of the Council on Contemporary Families and a staff writer at the American Museum of Natural History."

A few years later i.e. in 1935, in order to concentrate on the other than more important activities of Qasr-ul- Adab, he had handed over the charge of this magazine to Aijaz Siddiqi who carrying forward the tradition of his father remained its editor till 1978 long after the publication of Shair was shifted from Agra to Mumbai in 1947 and Seemab Akbarabadi had in 1951 died in Karachi. Mahendra Nath, the Urdu short-story writer and younger brother of Krishan Chander had also joined him to compile and edit several special issues of Shair. In his dress and appearance Aijaz resembled his father. Presently there exist two collections of his poems – 1) Khwaabon ke masiha and 2) Karb e khud kalaami, both published in 1966."

He was trained as a director at VGIK in Moscow and learned to speak Russian. There he meet his friend and future collaborator Chris Maris. In 1998 he came across a horror comedy script written by Daniel Ojanlatva about a town north of the arctic circle being terrorized by vampires. Banke loved the idea and spent several years developing it with Ojanlatva. Since the Swedish Filminsitute don't often approve of horror films or genre movies in general, Banke had a hard time pulling the film off. In the end, he managed to get funding from the Swedish Filminsitute needed to attract other producers to the project in 2004 and production could begin. The film was Sweden's first vampire film. The film did not hit at the box office as he thought it would, but became by far the most popular Swedish film that year, being sold to over 40 countries, which is far above the average of Swedish films. The success was especially big in Russia where it reached cult status and became the most profitable independent film of that year in Russia. The success led to Banke being offered the job of directing a remake of the Hong Kong film Breaking News, Gorjacije novosti or Newsmakers. Anders Banke will direct a new Swedish horror comedy written by Daniel Ojanlatva called Ond Bråd Sommar. According to the writer of the movie the film will be filmed in 2012 or 2013. Banke will direct a 16-part black comedy/horror TV-series called Chernobyl for Russian National TV channel TNT. Shooting starts summer 2012."

  "text" : "Arthur Edward Potts CBE, ED (24 October 1890, Northumberland, United Kingdom – September 1983, Kingston, Ontario, Canada) was a Canadian general officer, active in World War II. Potts attended George Heriot's School in Edinburgh and subsequently studied at the University of Edinburgh (bachelor of science) and Cornell University (master's degree in agriculture). He worked as instructor at Ames College in Iowa. In 1915, he left Ames College to enlist in Second Universities Company at McGill University and was attached to the Princess Patricia’s Canadian Light Infantry as a private. This unit was sent to France where Potts fought in the trenches and got wounded. In September 1916, he was appointed lieutenant. At the end of 1917, Potts was sent to the education office, to give lectures to soldiers about agriculture, and soon he joined his battalion again. After being wounded on 7 September, he was sent to England for convalescence. Potts was still there when the war ended. After the war, Potts joined the University of Saskatchewan as head of the dairy department. Besides his normal work as \"Professor of Dairying\", he also took over the university’s officer training corps and reorganized and retrained it. Potts was promoted to the rank of colonel in 1934. In the same year, he became commander of the Saskatoon Non-Permanent Active Militia garrison and officer commanding of the 19th infantry brigade. Shortly after the outbreak of World War II, Potts received a request from then Major-General Andrew McNaughton to accept demotion and take over Saskatoon Light Infantry. Potts accepted and took the unit to Europe in December 1939. In July 1940, he was promoted to Brigadier and took over the command of the 2nd Canadian Infantry Brigade. He led that brigade in Operation Gauntlet, the commando raid at Spitsbergen In May 1942, he became General Officer Commanding 6th Infantry Division with the rank of major-general. That appointment took him from the United Kingdom to the Pacific shores in British Columbia. In 1943 was appointed commander of Military District 2 in Toronto. He stayed there till the end of the war. After the war he joined the Department of Veterans Affairs. He moved to Kingston, Ontario in 1949, to become the Department’s district administrator. Potts and his wife, the former Mary Ann Rattray Stewart, had six children including two sets of twins. He retired in 1955 and died in September 1983."

  "text" : "Alfred Byrd Graf (December 1901 – December 14, 2001) was a German-American botanist who traveled the world in search of obscure plant species, discovering more than 100 previously undocumented varieties. He photographed and documented his findings in a number of richly illustrated (and correspondingly expensive) books he wrote on the subject. Graf was born in Nuremberg in December 1901 and studied at botanic gardens in Vienna and took courses in botany, photography and language throughout Europe, in California and at Fairleigh Dickinson University. He came to work on a ranch in Nebraska in the 1920s and later established a floral shop in Sioux City, Iowa that failed after his greenhouse was demolished as the result of a hailstorm. He found a position in 1931 with the Julius Roehrs Company, a tropical nursery in New Jersey, where his experience growing orchids in his youth in Germany helped him tap into what was becoming a major field of interest in the U.S. With his position at Roehrs, his travels allowed him to bring back new species that the company could add to its catalog, which morphed into book form as the Exotic Plant Manual, complete with 7,000 photos. Graf's writings were based on firsthand research done on travels around the world, having visited sites of plants that could be found on Mount Kilimanjaro, in New Guinea and throughout China, India and much of Asia, uncovering scores of previously undocumented species which he introduced to Western plant aficionados and carefully documented with his camera. Among his findings were the first known white African Violet. His books typically included thousands of his photographs and were priced accordingly. Roehrs Publishing released Exotica: Pictorial Cyclopedia of Indoor Plants in 1958 with in excess of 4,000 images, a guide to imported plants and the steps needed to grow them, his first book to receive widespread attention. The book was re-released in two volumes, with 16,000 illustrations decorating its 2,600 pages. Tropica covered plants from the areas in and around the tropics and included 7,000 images. First published in 1992, Hortica: Color Cyclopedia of Garden Flora and Exotic Plants Indoors covers thousands of ornamental plants. He maintained a library of his photographs and travels at his home in East Rutherford, New Jersey. Graf died at the age of 100 on December 14, 2001, at his home in Düsseldorf, Germany, having returned there after living the majority of his life in the United States. He was survived by his wife Lieselotte Vorwerk, as well as by a daughter. The standard author abbreviation A.B.Graf is used to indicate this individual as the author when citing a botanical name."

  "text" : "Arthur William Knapp (May 4, 1914 - February 22, 1991), better known as Art Knapp, was a Canadian businessman and entrepreneur. Art Knapp is best known as the founder of the Art Knapp's chain of garden stores. Knapp was born in Cobble Hill, British Columbia and was the son of William Knapp and Zoe Saunders Knapp. As Knapp's mother died in childbirth, he was raised by his paternal aunt and uncle, Phyllis Knapp Jennings and William Jennings of Victoria, British Columbia. According to documents held at the Saanich Archives, the Knapp's and Jennings families, which included Frank Jennings and Elizabeth Walkden Jennings, all immigrated to Canada together from England on the ship RMS Empress of Britain (1906) in 1911. The same documents reveal that the family had an extensive background in horticulture and operated green houses in Victoria. Art Knapp founded the Knapp's Victoria Nurseries at 716 Fort Street in the early 1940s. This store later relocated to Yates Street by 1945. He later started auctioning plants, trees and shrubs from the back of his truck in empty lots around British Columbia and Alberta in the early 1950s. He opened the first Art Knapp's Garden Spot on Kingsway in Vancouver and later sold the first franchise of the store to Bill Vander Zalm in 1953. The business continued to expand as more franchises were sold to others, including Frank Van Hest, who owned and operated the location in Richmond, BC from the early 1970s. Today there are 15 Art Knapp Stores located throughout British Columbia. Knapp had 5 children and spent his retirement years in Santa Barbara, California."

  "text" : "Alan Berney Fisher (1905, Denver, — 1978) was an American architect based in Denver, Colorado, working primarily for the firm of Fisher & Fisher founded by his father. He was active in historic preservation in the state. In 1892, the firm that became Fisher and Fisher was founded by Alan Fisher's father, William Ellsworth Fisher. In 1907 the firm became \"Fisher and Fisher\" when William's brother, Arthur Addison Fisher, joined and it continued until Alan Fisher's death in 1978. Throughout the firm worked on dozens of notable buildings. Of 67 existing buildings in Denver credited to the Fisher firm, 50 are individually listed, within districts, or have been determined eligible for the National Register of Historic Places; three quarters of the firm's identifiable remaining work in the city. This makes this architectural firm's legacy unsurpassed by any other in Colorado. Rodney Davis was part of the firm for 11 years beginning in 1956, after which Alan Fisher partnered with John D. Reece and Hillary M. Johnson until his death in 1978. Among his own designs are the Ship Tavern in the Brown Palace Hotel, a nautical-themed pub that he designed in celebration of the repeal of Prohibition and the Sisters of Charity Postulate chapel in the Seton Center. Becoming active in historic preservation, Alan Fisher was a founding member of the Denver Landmark Preservation Commission in 1967, and its chairman from 1970 to 1973. He renovated the Opera House in Central City, Colorado, recreating the musician's gallery it had originally had. Fisher was an alumnus of the University of Pennsylvania and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He married the sculptor Gladys Caldwell Fisher in 1936."

  "text" : "Arthur Leonard Bateman (22 August 1879 – 8 May 1957) was a British businessman and Conservative Party politician. Born in London, he was privately educated before entering business as a sack manufacturer. He was a member of the Worshipful Company of Basketmakers and a Freeman of the City of London. He became involved in local politics as a mameber of the Conservative-backed Municipal Reform Party. He was elected to Camberwell Borough Council in 1922 and was the mayor of Camberwell in 1929-1930. In 1931 he was elected to represent Peckham on the London County Council. At the 1931 general election he was chosen to contest the seat of Camberwell North on behalf of the Conservatives. The election had been called following the formation of a National Government. This had caused a split in the Labour Party with the majority opposing the coalition. Among these were Charles Ammon, sitting MP for Camberwell North. Bateman was the government candidate, with the Liberal Party stepping aside from the contest. Bateman was elected, overturning a Labour majority of 7,823 to win by 765 votes. Bateman proved to be a controversial member of parliament. In April 1932 the North Camberwell Liberal and Radical Association organised protests calling for his resignation. The Liberals claimed he had broken his election pledges and voted to support taxes on food. Bateman countered that his loyalty was not to the voters but to the National Government and that he would not resign. By the time the next election was called in 1935 Bateman had made it clear that he no longer wished to represent North Camberwell as the constituency had shown him \"no gratitude\". He stated that in.. \"some parts of North Camberwell I have had to have as many as fifty policemen to get me out of meetings. I will not risk my life any longer.\" He initially hoped that the Conservative Party would find another constituency for him to contest. When this did not occur he decided to stand as an independent in the neighbouring seat of Peckham, although he withdrew his candidacy prior to the election. In 1942 Bateman moved to Warwick, where he was to be a member of the borough council. By the time of the 1945 general election he had healed his rift with the Conservatives and contested Tottenham South, but failed to be elected. Apart from his political and business activities, Bateman was the founder of a charity, the Camberwell Children’s Christmas Treat and Summer Holiday Camp Fund. As part of fundraising activities for the organisation he paraded along Bond Street dressed in a coronet. He died at his home in Warwick in May 1957 aged 77."

  "text" : "Ammonius Lithotomos (Greek: Ἀμμώνιος; fl. 3rd century BC), of Alexandria, was a Greek (some say Egyptian) lithotomist. Reported by Celsus he invented the tools to break up \"bladder stones\". \"A hook or crotchet is fixed upon the stone in such a way as easily to hold it firm, even when shaken, so that it may not revolve backward; then an iron instrument is used, of moderate thickness, thin at the front end but blunt, which, when applied to the stone and struck at the other end, cleaves it. Great care must be taken that the instrument do not come into contact with the bladder itself, and that nothing fall upon it by the breaking of the stone.\" This is the method Ammonius uses to break up stones in the bladder as reported by Celsus Lithoclastic cystotomy is attributed to Ammonius Lithotomos (stone-cutter), from which arose the term lithotomy, now having the arbitrary signification of cutting for the stone. Celsus gave the first description of lithotomy as performed before and during his time, and the operation has ever since borne his name—the Celsian method. From Paulus Aegineta:\"To stop bleeding, Oribasius directs, in the first place, cooling and astringent applications to be used, and if these do not succeed, caustics, such as misy, chalcitis, copperas, or the actual cautery. Upon the whole, his account of hemorrhage is nearly the same as our author's, only he says nothing of the ligature. Aetius treats of this subject in the same terms as Galen, recommending the ligature under the circumstances mentioned by him. Some of his styptics are powerful escharotics and astringents, such as copperas, chalcitis, alum, galls, quicklime, rosin, and frankincense. He informs us that \"Ammonius, the famous Alexandrian lithomist, used a composition of arsenic, sandaracb, chalcitis, and quicklime.\"\""

  "text" : "Allister MacGillivray CM, D.Litt (hon), (born January 17, 1948) is a Canadian singer/songwriter, guitarist, and music historian from the Cape Breton region of Nova Scotia. He was born in the coal-mining and fishing town of Glace Bay. He began performing at the age of seven, later became a boy chorister and, as a teen, sang in local folk bands. During his twenties and thirties, he traveled the world as a guitar accompanist with some prominent Celtic performers, including Ryan's Fancy, Makem & Clancy (i.e., Tommy Makem, Liam Clancy) and John Allan Cameron. With Cameron, he performed on the Grand Ole Opry in Nashville in 1970, earning a lengthy standing ovation and stealing the show from the likes of Hank Snow, Roy Rogers and Bill Monroe. Since leaving the road, MacGillivray has lived close to the village of Marion Bridge, also known as Drochaid Mhira which remains strongly Gaelic. A well-respected author/composer, his most popular songs include: Away From The Roll Of The Sea, Coal Town Road, Kitty Bawn O'Brien, Tie Me Down, Here's To Song, Sea People and You'll Be Home Again — all published by Cabot Trail Music (SOCAN). He is best known for a composition called Song for the Mira that provided the theme as well as the sound track for an Atlantic Canadian film, Marion Bridge. Song For the Mira has been translated into Dutch, French, Scots Gaelic, Japanese & Mi’ kmaq, is available on well over 250 recordings, and is a standard in the Canadian choral-music repertoire. One of the most recorded songs ever by an eastern Canadian writer, Out On The Mira (an alternate title) has been covered by Anne Murray, Foster & Allen, Celtic Thunder, Daniel O’Donnell, Denny Doherty (of The Mamas & The Papas), Phil Coulter, The Canadian Tenors, Frank Patterson, The Los Angeles Children's Chorus, and scores of other noted performers. Out on the Mira on warm afternoons Old men go fishin' with black line and spoons.And, if they catch nothing, they never complain;I wish I was with them again.(Chorus:)Can you imagine a piece of the universeMore fit for princes and kings?I'll trade you ten of your cities for Marion BridgeAnd the pleasure it brings. In the mid 1970s, MacGillivray penned Coal Town Road for Fergus O'Byrne of Ryan's Fancy. The song was later adopted as part of the regular repertoire of folk groups like Cockersdale (England), The Clark Family and The Barra MacNeils. Coal Town Road documents an important part of Canadian history in that Canada has experienced the same types of labor and environmental exploitation as the United States—and has reacted in similar song-style ways. Significantly, this song is sung by the Nova Scotian coal-miner group, The Men of the Deeps. We never see the sun Down the coal town road,At a penny for the tonWhere the coal trains load.When the shift comes up on topWe're so thankful to be doneWe head home to sleep and dreamAbout the coal town road. Significantly, MacGillivray's songs are well loved by choral groups, and over 600 choirs throughout the world perform his works in classical contexts. His Away from the Roll of the Sea is known in Italy as Vecchi Amici on YouTube and is sung in typically Italian operatic style by the group Coro Leone Bologna. The song has also been performed in Korean by The Hanyang University Male Choir, and is known in Taiwanese as 世紀尋跡 無垠聲情 on YouTube having been sung by The National Taiwan University Chorus. Small craft in a harbour that's still and serene Give no indication what their ways have been.They rock at their moorings, all nestled in dreamsAway from the roll of the sea. Instrumentally, his songs have been arranged for bagpipes, brass quintet, recorder ensemble, jazz ensemble, ukulele ensemble, massed brass & pipe band, guitar, violin, piano, and symphony suite. He is also one of the few composers to have a commercially produced acoholic beverage named after one of his songs. “Cape Breton Silver”, a specialty liquor made by Glenora Distillers and available in Nova Scotia outlets, was inspired by a MacGillivray composition of the same name. You've heard of the miners who tunnel for coal; The tale of their valour has often been told.But there's one class of hero that's misunderstood:The lads who mine silver in the Cape Breton woods. MacGillivray concluded his singing & playing career in the early eighties in order to write songs and books and to make films about the musical traditions of Cape Breton Island. He continues to write and arrange music, has released a compilation CD, and is involved in the operation of Sea-Cape Music Ltd. (the company which distributes his books). Books Published: Song For The Mira (1979), a collection of thirteen original songs.• The Cape Breton Fiddler (1981), a historical and photographic look at Cape Breton's Scottish violin tradition. • The Cape Breton Song Collection (1985), an anthology of the Island's best-loved compositions. • A Cape Breton Ceilidh (1988), a historical and photographic look at Cape Breton's unique stepdancing and piano-playing traditions.• The Nova Scotia Song Collection (1989). This anthology deals with the works of Hank Snow, Wilf Carter, Stan Rogers, Dr. Helen Creighton, etc.• Diamonds In The Rough (Vols. 1 & 2), the story of The Men Of The Deeps, Cape Breton's coalmining chorus.• Songs From The Mira (2001), a collection of thirty-two original songs. His children, Ciarán and Fiona MacGillivray, are also noted performers in the Celtic-music field. He has as Bachelor of Arts degree (St. Francis Xavier University), has been awarded an honorary doctorate by The University College of Cape Breton, has been designated The Official Bard of Clan MacGillivray Canada, and has been appointed to the Order of Canada (2013). Rideau Hall citation for December 13, 2013 Investiture: Cape Breton’s musical heritage has been enriched by the contributions of Allister MacGillivray. A musician and composer, he is beloved for his original songs, many of which depict the traditional way of life of Cape Breton coal miners and fishermen. His compositions are popular with both professional and amateur choirs, notably his “Song for the Mira”, considered a classic and translated into several languages. His various anthologies and publications about fiddling, step dancing and the Gaelic language have also helped to preserve the island’s traditional culture. Allister MacGillivray, C.M., Albert Bridge (Nouvelle-Écosse)\"Par sa contribution, Allister MacGillivray a enrichi le patrimoine musical du Cap Breton. Musicien et compositeur, il est extrêmement apprécié pour ses chansons originales, dont beaucoup évoquent le mode de vie traditionnel des mineurs et des pêcheurs du Cap Breton. Ses compositions sont populaires auprès des chœurs professionnels et amateurs, tout particulièrement son œuvre Song for the Mira, considérée aujourd’hui comme un classique et traduite en plusieurs langues. Ses différentes anthologies et publications sur le violon et la danse populaires ainsi que sur le gaélique ont aussi contribué à préserver la culture traditionnelle de l’île.\""

  "text" : "Alfred Hempel (1920–89) was a German businessman. He attracted international attention because of his trade and smuggling of materials used in nuclear facilities in Pakistan, India, Argentina and several other countries. Hempel came into the public spotlight after it was revealed in 1988 that he had smuggled Norwegian and Russian heavy water to India. The heavy water was used in one of the Indian reactors used for production of nuclear weapon material. This transfer happened in 1983, and was one of several such operations carried out by Hempel's network of companies. Hempel's technique during this and other such operations was to apply for export of the heavy water to a bona fide country such as Germany, then divert the shipment to the real buyer. After a Norwegian newspaper revealed Hempel's operation in Norway, several countries including the United States, Germany, Norway, and Switzerland started investigating his businesses dealings. Norway demanded an explanation from India, but never received one."

  "text" : "Ali Salem, also transliterated Ali Salim, (Arabic: على سالم‎‎, IPA: [ˈʕæli ˈsæːlem]; 24 February 1936 – 22 September 2015) was an Egyptian playwright, author, and political commentator known for controversially endorsing cooperation with Israel. The Los Angeles Times once described him as \"a big, loud man known for his satiric wit\". From the premiere of his first play in 1965, he wrote 25 plays and fifteen books. One of the best known, The School of Troublemakers, debuted in 1971 and featured a rowdy class of children transformed by a kind teacher. His plays The Phantom of Heliopolis, The Comedy of Oedipus, The Man Who Fooled the Angels, and The Buffet have also become \"classics of the Egyptian theater\". Salem's plays often include allegorical critiques of Egyptian politics with a strong vein of humor and satire. In 1994, he wrote a book entitled My Drive to Israel, and this book earned the best-selling in the Arab world, and it's about a trip he took to the country to satisfy his curiosity about it following the signing of the Oslo Accords. He later claimed that the trip was not \"a love trip, but a serious attempt to get rid of hate. Hatred prevents us from knowing reality as it is\". He spent 23 nights in Israel and concluded that \"real co-operation\" between the two nations should be possible. Though the book sold more than 60,000 copies, a bestseller by Egyptian standards, it provoked controversy, and Salem was subsequently ostracized from the Egyptian intellectual community and expelled from its Writer's Syndicate as a result of his \"propaganda.\" He did not have a play or movie script produced in Egypt after the book's publication, though he continued to contribute columns to foreign media such as the London-based Al Hayat. Salem's memoir was later adapted by Ari Roth into the play Ali Salem Drives to Israel, which had its world premiere in the US in 2005. In 2008, he won the Train Foundation's $50,000 Civil Courage Prize in recognition of his opposition to radical Islam and his support of cooperation with Israel. He also received an honorary doctorate from Israel's Ben-Gurion University of the Negev in 2005. He died on 22 September 2015 after a long illness. Ali Salem passed away because of heart attack in Cairo on Sep 22, 2015. Also, he was saying before he died \" What else can they do? They can't catch Israel, they can't catch America, but they can catch Ali Salem. Moreover, Ali Salem was interesting in writing, and writing plays so Ali Salem have presented 15 books and 27 plays to Al-Arab Library. most of them are comedy and political satirist."

He won his first and only international medal at the 2010 World Junior Championships in Athletics in Moncton, Canada, taking the silver medal in the 3000 metres steeplechase as part of a Kenyan 1–2 with Jonathan Muia Ndiku. Having gained representation with PACE Sports Management, he made his debut on the major European track and field circuit later that year. At the Memorial van Damme Diamond League meeting in Brussels he came fifth in a personal best of 8:23.69 minutes – the fastest time by a youth level athlete that year, and also the fourth fastest junior time. Yator began his 2011 cross country season on the Athletics Kenya National Cross Series, coming sixth in the junior section. However, his running was interrupted by illness and he was admitted to Eldoret Hospital with suspected malaria. His health rapidly worsened and the young athlete died on 5 February at the age of seventeen due to what was later identified as bronchopneumonia. Noah Ngeny, the 2000 Olympic champion over 1500 metres, paid tribute to Yator, describing him as a \"talented runner\"."

In 1992 he edited the first full-length U.S. anthology of English-language Caribbean poetry, Crossing Water, and in 1993, he won a USA National Endowment for the Arts literary award. Kellman is the originator of the Barbados poetic form Tuk Verse, derived from melodic and rhythmical patterns of Barbados' indigenous folk music called Tuk."

  "text" : "Asma al-Ghul (also Al Ghoul, Alghoul ) is a young secular Palestinian feminist journalist who writes for the Ramallah-based newspaper Al-Ayyam, chronicling what she calls “the corruption of Fatah and the terrorism of Hamas.” Al-Ayyam is sometimes banned in Gaza by Hamas. Al-Ghul is described by the New York Times as \"known for her defiant stance against violations of civil rights in Gaza.\" Al-Ghul was born in 1982 in Rafah, a Gazan city bordering Egypt whose population is mainly Palestinian refugees. In 2003, she married an Egyptian poet and moved to Abu Dhabi. She and her husband later divorced, and she returned to Gaza with their son. In 2006, al-Ghul permanently took off her Islamic khimār (headscarf). In 2009, al-Ghul reported being stopped and interrogated by Hamas after walking on a public beach near the Shati refugee camp in Gaza with a mixed-gender group of friends, while wearing jeans and a T-shirt with no headscarf, and laughing. The Associated Press said it was the first time since coming to power in 2007 that Hamas had tried to punish a woman for behaving in a way it viewed as un-Islamic. Al-Ghul says her male friends were subsequently detained for several hours, beaten, and then forced to sign statements saying they would not again \"violate public moral standards.\" Hamas has denied that the incident took place. In February 2011, al-Ghul said she was beaten while covering a rally expressing solidarity between Palestinians and Egyptians. In March 2011, al-Ghul and seven other female Palestinian journalists said they were beaten and tortured by Hamas security forces while trying to cover rallies calling for Hamas to seek a peaceful reconciliation with Fatah. The Hamas government later apologized for some of the attacks and promised to launch an investigation. At the age of 18, al-Ghul won the Palestinian Youth Literature award. In 2010, she received a Hellman/Hammett award from Human Rights Watch, aimed at helping writers \"who dare to express ideas that criticize official public policy or people in power.\" Her work has been translated into English, Danish and Korean. In 2012, al-Ghul was awarded the Courage in Journalism Award by the International Women's Media Foundation. She works for Lebanon's Samir Kassir Foundation, which advocates for media freedom. On August 3, 2014, at least nine members from the her family were killed in an Israeli airstrike, in Rafah, southern Gaza Strip. In an essay, al-Ghul documents her experiences after hearing the about the death of her family, entitled Never Ask Me About Peace Again."

She was the spouse of Piero di Lorenzo de' Medici from 1488 and the mother of Lorenzo II de' Medici. She helped restore the Medicis to power after they had been exiled. She worked to secure a French royal marriage for her son, and was also influential at the court of Pope Leo X, her brother-in-law. Throughout her life, she used her wealth, position, and connections to help the poor and underrepresented. She also used them to further her family's power and wealth. She was a patron of the arts and architecture, both in Florence and in Rome. This included renovation of religious buildings as well as construction of palaces for the family."

  "text" : "Alexander Brunschwig (born September 11, 1901, died August 7, 1969) was born in El Paso, Texas. He died in 1969 at the age of 67 of coronary disease. Brunschwig developed pelvic exenteration surgery, which removes major organs from the patient's pelvic cavity. He performed 847 procedures, with a death rate similar to those of others later with more modern anesthesia. Pelvic exenteration is controversial, because it is one of the most aggressive and disfiguring surgeries used in oncology, and has not been subject to controlled clinical trials. In 1963, Brunschwig maintained that cancer of the uterine cervix, microscopically looked like a viral disease. That has since been proved. He was in the forefront of implantation of the ureters and construction of substitute bladders from segments of the colon. He worked with Alexander A. Maximow and William Bloom on their Textbook of Histology."

  "text" : "Alfred E. Vellucci (1915–2002) was an American politician who served as the mayor of Cambridge, Massachusetts. He served four non-consecutive terms as mayor, and was known for his often antagonistic relationship with Harvard University. Vellucci was born in Somerville, Massachusetts. His father died when Vellucci was in sixth grade, and he dropped out of school soon afterwards. He initially worked as a messenger for Western Union before becoming a candy bar deliveryman. He later opened a sandwich store. He lived in East Cambridge for much of his life. In 1951 Vellucci was elected to the Cambridge School Committee. Four years later he was elected to the Cambridge City Council. He served on the City Council for 34 years. In 1989 he was re-elected to the Cambridge School Committee for one term. He was elected to his first two-year term Mayor of Cambridge in 1971, and was also elected in 1976, 1982, and 1988. In 1991 he ran for election to the City Council but failed to win a seat. He often focused on providing services to his constituents and was skilled at grass roots campaigning. He claimed credit for promoting commercial development, such as the CambridgeSide Galleria mall. While he was in office, Vellucci served as an independent and promoted both liberal and conservative policies. He supported increased public housing and rent control, but also supported corporate tax cuts. He also was openly critical of anti-war protesters during the Vietnam War. In addition, he opposed condom distribution in schools. An Italian American, Vellucci was opposed to the idea that Leif Ericcson, rather than Christopher Columbus, discovered America. After a group of scholars from Harvard promoted the claim that Ericcson discovered America, he proposed a motion to the Cambridge City Council that officially renamed Harvard Square to Columbus Square. He also planted a large tree in front of the Harvard Lampoon Building, claiming that it was an eyesore and arguing that the Harvard Lampoon had insulted Italian Americans by claiming that the Irish discovered America. He feuded with the Harvard Lampoon for years. The paper often satirized him, one issue running an Alfred E. Neuman style picture of him on its cover. On one occasion, he unsuccessfully proposed a city ordinance declaring their headquarters a public urinal. Vellucci often clashed with Harvard University while serving in city leadership. He frequently attempted to convince the school to offer voluntary payment in lieu of property taxes, which they were not required to pay. He also attempted to force Harvard to pay the salaries of Cambridge Police officers to deal with students. He tried to convert parking around Harvard to resident parking, and on one occasion proposed a plan that would have converted Harvard Yard into a parking lot for public buses. In 1976, Vellucci clashed with Harvard and MIT over their plans to begin genetic engineering on recombinant DNA. He attempted to ban genetic engineering in Cambridge, where the labs for both universities were located, due to fears that scientists might accidentally create dangerous organisms. This proposed ban led to extensive hearings featuring extensive debates between scientists, including David Baltimore, and members of the Cambridge City Council. After several months the mayor allowed the proposed ban to be decided by a panel of Cambridge residents, who eventually decided against the proposed ban."

  "text" : "Monsignor Andrew Arnold Lambing or Rev. A. A. Lambing (1842–1918) was an American Roman Catholic priest and historian. He was one of the nation's foremost priest-historians, having founded the first Catholic historical society in the United States (The Ohio Valley Catholic Historical Society, in February 1884) as well as the first Catholic historical quarterly. Born in a hamlet that became Manorville, Armstrong County, Pennsylvania, adjacent to Ford City, he worked as a boy on his family's farm. As an adolescent he labored in a brick yard and in the pioneering oil business of Samuel Kier on the Allegheny River. At age 21 Lambing entered St. Michael's Preparatory and Theological Seminary in Pittsburgh, was ordained in 1869 by Bishop Michael Domenec, and was briefly assigned to teach history at St. Francis College, Loretto. Thereafter, during forty years of Pittsburgh's post-Civil War, industrial and population boom, he ministered to thousands of the city's Catholic immigrants from Europe. During the Great Railroad Strike of 1877, he was credited with calming some strikers intent on destroying a freight depot of the Pennsylvania Railroad in the city's rail yards. Lambing was among the first academically-trained historians of Western Pennsylvania and the first to document the beginnings of the Catholic Church there. Two of his most important contributions were the first English translation, from the French, of the 1749 journal of Pierre Joseph Céloron de Blainville and the publication of the register of baptisms at Fort Duquesne. He wrote numerous articles for newspapers and magazines on historical and religious subjects, including a majority of two early and significant regional histories: History of Allegheny County and the Standard History of Pittsburgh. He served as president of the Historical Society of Western Pennsylvania. Andrew Carnegie appointed Lambing a trustee of both the Carnegie Institute of Pittsburgh and the Carnegie School of Technology. In 1883 the University of Notre Dame conferred on him the honorary degree of Master of Arts and in 1886 the Doctor of Laws. He died Christmas Eve, 1918, and is buried in the priest’s section at St. Mary Cemetery in the city's Lawrenceville neighborhood. His headstone is in the shape of a large open book."

  "text" : "Alexey Tsereteli (Russian: Алексей Акакиевич Церетели; 1864, Saint Petersburg, Russian Empire – 1942, Paris, France) was a Georgian prince and he was a Russian opera entrepreneur. \n*  Father: Akaki Tsereteli (1840–1915) was a Georgian prince, a prominent Georgian poet and national liberation movement figure. \n*  Mother: Russian Natalia Petrovna Bazilevskaya (ru: Наталия Петровна Базилевская). Alexey was born in St. Petersburg and received the same education as all the Russian aristocracy and did not even know the Georgian language. He grew up a man of Russian culture. From childhood he liked music and especially opera. He received the profession of engineer, but a passion for opera has won and he decided to open an opera troupe. In 1896/1897, Alexey Tsereteli opened an opera enterprise in Kharkov. Theater critic once noted the successful staging of the new company. Very soon, he continued to work in St. Petersburg and creates a New Opera (ru: «Новая опера») and, despite competition from the Mariinsky Theatre, his productions are popular. Worked there not only well-known Russian singers, but the famous European singers came. In 1905, Titta Ruffo came to participate in several performances. In 1907/08 A. Tsereteli organized tours of Feodor Chaliapin in America. In 1917, A. Tsereteli left Russia. In 1921 he began to create an opera-ballet troupe in Barcelona, then - in Paris. In his company worked many famous Russian singer-emigrants. In 1926 he organized a performance of The Legend of the Invisible City of Kitezh and the Maiden Fevroniya at the Opéra national de Paris. In 1929 he joined his company with a troupe of Russian opera of Maria Nikolaevna Kuznetsova and her husband Alfred Massenet (Jules Massenet's nephew). The new company was called the Russian Opera in Paris. The conductors, directors, painters, singers and ballet artists who worked there included Emil Cooper, Nikolai Evreinov, Alexander Sanin, Konstantin Korovin, Ivan Bilibin, Mstislav Dobuzhinsky; Michel Fokine, Bronislava Nijinska, opera singers: Feodor Chaliapin, Dmitriy Smirnov, Yelena Sadoven, Marya Davydova, Marianna Cherkasskaya, Natalia Ermolenko-Yuzhina, George Pozemkovskiy, Yakov Gorsky, Kapiton Zaporojets (Capiton D. Zaporozhetz, ru: Капитон Запорожец), Nina Koshetz etc. Alexey Tsereteli invited Colonel W. de Basil’s ballet troupe. The success was enormous. The troupe was invited to different countries. In one of the productions of the opera Prince Igor in London in 1933 Feodor Chaliapin played two roles at once: Galitsky and Konchak (Russian sources call another date of this representation: June 5, 1931, Lyceum Theatre, London). But everything has its end. The owners of company quarreled and filed their claims in court. Private Company disbanded. A. Tsereteli tried to work with other partners, but such success does not happen again. A. Tsereteli before his death, bequeathed all the props of his troupe to the \"theater of the future of a free Georgia\". But will not be recognized as valid and the property went to auction. Prince Alexei Akakiyevich Tsereteli died in 1942 in German-occupied Paris."

  "text" : "Alix of Brittany, Dame de Pontarcy, Countess of Blois (6 June 1243 – 2 August 1288), was a Breton noblewoman and a member of the House of Dreux as the eldest daughter of John I, Duke of Brittany. She married John I, Count of Blois. Alix was known for founding religious houses including the Monastery of La Guiche, where she was later buried. Alix, named after her paternal grandmother, Alix of Thouars, was born on 6 June 1243 at the Château de Suscinio in Sarzeau, Morbihan, Brittany. She was the eldest daughter of John I, Duke of Brittany and Blanche of Navarre, daughter of Theobald I of Navarre and Agnes of Beaujeu. Alix held the title Dame de Pontarcy in her own right. Sometime after a contract was signed on 11 December 1254, she married John I, Count of Blois of the House of Châtillon. Thereafter she was styled Countess of Blois. She brought as her dowry her titles of Pontarcy and de Brie-Comte-Robert, which had been named after her ancestor Robert I of Dreux. The marriage produced one child, a daughter Jeanne, who was heiress to her father's title and estates. In 1270, her husband was appointed Lieutenant General of France. Through Alix's marriage to John, the Château de Brie-Comte-Robert passed to the Châtillon family. Alix and John founded several religious houses including the Monastery of La Guiche near Blois in 1277. She became a widow on 28 June 1279. In 1287, the year before her own death, Alix travelled to Palestine. From there she journed on to Syria, where she commissioned the erection of two barbican towers at Ptolemais."
