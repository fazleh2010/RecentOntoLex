In 1981, she was co-author of Addiego et al.'s \"Female ejaculation: a case study.\" The paper was presented in The Journal of Sex Research and includes the first published instance of the term \"G-Spot\". Following the book, Whipple continued to publicize her work, including a 9 min video made in 1981 Orgasmic Expulsions of Fluid in the Sexually Stimulated Female. In 1984, the Journal of Sex Research described the debate surrounding female ejaculation as 'heated'. Her techniques include using FMRI scans to gather evidence on what is happening in the brain. Her animal experiments contributed to the isolation of the vasoactive intestinal peptide and the discovery that orgasms can be rerouted to the brain via the vagus nerve without using the spinal cord, thus enabling females with spinal cord injury to achieve orgasm by psychological stimulation alone."

The son of Charles Harrod and the former Mary Morgan, Harrod was educated in New Orleans by private tutors. He graduated with two degrees in 1856 and 1859 from Harvard College in Cambridge, Massachusetts. In 1861, he enlisted in the Crescent Rifles during the American Civil War. As a first lieutenant, he was captured by the Union Army in 1863 during the siege of Vicksburg, Mississippi. He was paroled and then joined the Second Regiment of Engineers in Petersburg, south of Richmond, Virginia. Harrod was part of the Confederate staff with General Robert E. Lee in the final surrender after the battle at Appomattox Court House, Virginia, on April 9, 1865. After the war, Harrod from 1877 to 1880 was the chief engineer for the state of Louisiana. He was a member of the Louisiana River Commission from 1879 to 1904. As chief engineer of the city of New Orleans from 1888 to 1902, he directed the water/sewerage project. He was thereafter named by U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt to the Panama Canal Commission but did not live to see the completion of the canal in 1914. Harrod shared Roosevelt's interest in conservation of natural resources through his work in the Audubon Society. Harrod was a member of the Society of Civil Engineers and the Louisiana Engineering Society. He maintained a notable collection of art and was consulting engineer for the construction of the New Orleans Museum of Art, then known as the Delgado Art Museum. The first Mrs. Harrod was the former Harriet Uhlhorn; upon her death, he married Eugenia Uhlhorn, Harriet's sister. He had no children. Harrod was Episcopalian. He died in New Orleans and is interred there at Metairie Cemetery."

Clopton assisted Iwerks in drawing the first Mickey Mouse cartoon, Plane Crazy, in late April, 1927, but left the Disney studio in the middle of May to join Hugh Harman and Rudy Ising, who had been hired from Disney to make cartoons for Charles Mintz under contract with Universal Studios. Clopton directed six Oswald the Lucky Rabbit cartoons in 1928-1929. Mintz lost distributorship of the Oswald cartoons in 1929. Harman and Ising then formed their own studio and signed a deal with Leon Schlesinger in 1930 to create the Looney Tunes series. Clopton took a job with Iwerks' studio until 1933, when Scheslinger refused to renew Harman and Ising's contract, started his own studio, and hired staff. Clopton was among the animators and his first film credit is on Buddy the Gob, released January 13, 1934. Clopton is credited on sixteen cartoons through 1936, when he left for the Walter Lantz studio. Clopton's name is on three cartoons released in 1937. His name appears for a final time on screen as an animator on Gulliver's Travels, released in 1939 by the Fleischer Studios. Clopton returned to California and worked at Disney with his brother John before they were inducted into the U.S. Army in April, 1942. He was divorced in 1945 by his wife Sylvia Lamarr, stand-in for Hedy Lamarr and Joan Crawford. A wire service report made no mention of his animation career, instead stating he was a rancher. She testified at her divorce trial \"He kept a loaded rifle around the house. He used to shoot holes in the ceiling. It made me very nervous\". He was living in Santa Monica, California, at the time of his mother's death in 1966 but re-settled back home in Townsend, Montana, where he died in 1987."

  "text" : "Bertram Lenox Simpson (1877–1930) was a British author who wrote about China under the pen name \"B. L. Putnam Weale\" (or sometimes simply \"Putnam Weale\"). Lenox-Simpson was the son of Clare Lenox-Simpson, who had been in the Chinese Maritime Customs Service since 1861; he had a brother, Evelyn, a mining engineer who worked in China, and a sister, Esme. His education was at Brighton College, after which he too joined the Service. He was in China during the Boxer Rebellion and during the siege of the legations. After this, he became Brigade Interpreter for the British Expeditionary Force (he spoke 5 languages). Lenox-Simpson left the Chinese Maritime Customs Service in 1901, perhaps connected with zealous looting after the siege of the Legations in 1900. One historian calls him \"the consummate treaty port jobbing hack, writing commentaries, begging for newspaper work, penning novels... and serving as Daily Telegraph correspondent in Beijing from 1911 to 1914.\" He remained in China, and began a prolific career writing about China and the Far East. His 1914 novel, The Eternal Princess has the earliest reference as yet located to the apocryphal sign in Shanghai's Huangpu Park, \"No Dogs or Chinese.\" As of 1916 he was working for the political section of the office of the President of China. One researcher reports that \"During the period of September 1916 to June 1917, he had written at least thirty-eight reports on foreign affairs for the Chinese government. Many of them were ... read by President Li Yuanhong.\" His journalistic career in China included periods as editor of the Peking Leader and as chairman of the Far Eastern Times syndicate. By 1930 Lenox-Simpson had become thoroughly embroiled in Chinese internal politics and thus took control of customs in Tianjin on behalf of Yan Xishan. He was killed in what some believed to have been an assassination. This was difficult to conclusively prove, because the killers were never caught or identified."

She was later elected as Secretary General of the ANCWL from 1998 and served for two terms until 2008 (One of the longest serving Secretaries General of the ANCWL). She continued to work tirelessly towards the formation of the Progressive Women's Movement of South Africa. At the start of the New Millennium, she was appointed as a Member of Parliament.Ms Dlamini was elected to the National Executive Committee of the African National Congress as well as the National Working Committee in Polokwane in December 2007. In 2008 she worked on a full-time basis as a member of the ANC in the office of the president as sectoral work co-ordinator. She is also a member of the National Executive Committee of the ANCWL. On August 8, 2015, she was elected President of the ANCWL. She became Deputy Minister of Social Development between 11 May 2009 and 31 October 2010. She has been serving as Minister of Social Development since 1 November 2010. During her tenure as Minister of Social Development she has campaigned tirelessly for the promotion and protection of the rights of vulnerable groups in South Africa, including children, people with disabilities and women. Some of the key innovations she has introduced for the protection of children include the Isibindi Model – an initiative that deploys trained community-based child and youth care workers in communities in an innovative team outreach programme providing care, protection and developmental support to vulnerable children and families – as well as the launch of the register for child- and youth-headed households. On women’s issues, Ms Dlamini has also emerged as the reproductive justice’s vocal champion, especially as this relates to the right of women to access termination of pregnancy services. She has repeatedly stated that the right of women to have an abortion should always be fully located and discussed as part of the rights and the transformation of society that enables the complete emancipation of women. Addressing the United Nation’s General Assembly on the commission on population and development on harnessing the demographic dividend and ensuring universal access to sexual and reproductive health in Africa on 19 September 2014, she said: “Sexual and reproductive health and rights can, of course, never be divorced from the pursuit of gender equality and equity, and the full empowerment of women. Sexual and reproductive health and rights is at the centre of gender relations, as much as the full realisation of Sexual and reproductive health and rights cannot be achieved in the absence of gender equality and equity.” Ms Dlamini has also given a voice to many women who experience gender-based violence. As Chairperson of the Inter-Ministerial Committee (IMC) on Gender Based Violence she has led the roll out of the country’s most notable instrument in the fight against gender-based violence – the Gender-Based Violence Command Centre. The Command Centre is a 24-hour call centre dedicated to provide support and counselling to victims of gender based violence. Since its launch in March 2014 it has received a number of recognition awards both locally and abroad. Other Inter-Ministerial Committees Ms Dlamini chairs include the IMC on Combating Substance Abuse as well as the IMC for Early Childhood Development (ECD)."

On October 30, 1430, Brites married the Castilian-Portuguese nobleman Fernando de Noronha, the son of two bastard lines of the royal houses of Portugal and Castile (i.e. Fernando de Noronha was a grandson of Henry II of Castile and Ferdinand I of Portugal). Brites de Meneses competed with her half-brother Duarte de Menezes (born illegitimate, but legitimized by royal letter) to secure the inheritance of her father's titles for herself and her husband. Upon her father Pedro de Meneses' death in 1437, the titles were distributed - the crown-granted title of Count of Vila Real went to Brites and Fernando, while the older family title of Count of Viana do Alentejo went to Duarte. Brites de Menezes had two legitimate sons from her marriage to Fernando de Noronha: \n*  Pedro de Menezes, 3rd Count (1st Marquis) of Vila Real (from which stems the Portuguese noble house of Count of Vila Real) \n*  João de Noronha, Lord of Sortelha (from which stems the Portuguese noble house of Count of Monsanto)"

  "text" : "Sir Bernard Hale (1677-1729) was an English-born barrister and judge who became Chief Baron of the Irish Exchequer. He was born at King's Walden, Hertfordshire, eighth son of William Hale and his wife Mary Elwes. The Hale family, who originally made their fortune as grocers in London, had owned property in King's Walden since the sixteenth century, and Bernard's own descendants were still living there in Victorian times. His father William was the son of Rowland Hale, High Sheriff of Hertfordshire in 1648, and was himself a political figure of some consequence, being MP for Hertfordshire in the English Parliament of 1679 and in the short-lived Parliament of 1681. Bernard was educated at Eton College and Peterhouse, Cambridge, graduating Bachelor of Arts in 1699 and Master of Arts in 1702: he subsequently became a fellow of Peterhouse. He entered Gray's Inn in 1699 and was called to the Bar in 1705. He became one of the leaders of the English Bar, and was one of its top earners. He later transferred to Lincoln's Inn, and was briefly one of its Benchers. He married Anne Thoresby of Northampton: they had seven children including General Bernard Hale, William Hale, Richard Hale and Jane Hale, who married Martin Madan; her portrait was painted by Allan Ramsay. In 1722 he was appointed Chief Baron of the Irish Exchequer, and earned a good reputation in Ireland for integrity and efficiency. In 1725 he and his junior Baron, Sir John St Leger, narrowly escaped death when on assize at Monaghan : the roof of Monaghan courthouse, which like many Irish courthouses of the time was in an appalling state of repair, fell in, narrowly missing the judges, who adjourned outside and continued the assize. Later the same year, it was rumoured that he was to be appointed Lord Chancellor of Ireland. In fact he was offered the office of Lord Chief Justice of Ireland: but his English colleagues advised him to refuse it, on the ground that he would shortly be offered a place on the English Bench. Hale admitted that the prospect of being Irish Lord Chief Justice was tempting enough to \"perplex him\", but his great concern was to go back to England: although he had been happy enough in Ireland, he admitted that \"it is impossible for me to forget England or not to wish to return there\". He went back to England as a Baron of the Exchequer: to qualify for that office he was made a Serjeant-at-law, and received a knighthood. He died at Red Lion Square, London in 1729 and was buried at King's Walden."

  "text" : "Bruce Robert Jackson (3 June 1949 – 29 January 2011) was an Australian audio engineer who co-founded JANDS, an Australian audio, lighting and staging company. He joined American touring audio engineer Roy Clair and mixed concert stage monitors for Elvis Presley in the 1970s. With Clair Brothers, a concert sound company, Jackson designed audio electronics including a custom mixing console. Beginning in 1978, Jackson toured as Bruce Springsteen's band engineer for a decade, using Clair Brothers sound systems. A business interest in Fairlight CMI in Sydney introduced Jackson to digital audio, and he subsequently founded the digital audio company Apogee Electronics in Santa Monica, California, where he lived at the time. After selling his share of Apogee, Jackson co-founded with Roy and Gene Clair a joint venture which produced the Clair iO, a loudspeaker management system for control of complex concert sound systems. Jackson turned the venture commercial with the help of Dave McGrath's Lake Technology. Dolby Laboratories bought the technology and formed Dolby Lake with Jackson as vice president, then in 2009 Lab.gruppen acquired the brand. Jackson was honoured with the Parnelli Innovator Award in 2005 for his inventive loudspeaker controller. While still a partner at Apogee, Jackson began touring with Barbra Streisand, mixing concert sound and serving as sound designer from 1993 to 2007. With two other audio engineers he received an Emmy Award for sound design and sound mixing on Streisand's TV special Barbra: The Concert. Jackson worked on sound design for the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney and served as audio director for the opening and closing ceremonies. He performed the same role in Doha, Qatar, at the 2006 Asian Games and in Vancouver, Canada, at the 2010 Winter Olympics."

  "text" : "Brenda Colvin CBE (1897–1981) was an important British landscape architect, author of standard works in the field and a force behind its professionalisation. She was part of the Colvin family, which had long ties to the British Raj. She was born in India where her father, Sir Elliot Graham Colvin, was a senior administrator in Kashmir and Rajputana. (His father, John Russell Colvin (1807 – 1857), was lieutenant-governor of the North-West Provinces during the Indian Mutiny, at the height of which he died.) Colvin received her training in garden design from Madeline Agar at Swanley College (now Hadlow College, which continues to teach University of Greenwich courses in the subject). Agar and Colvin worked together on Wimbledon Common. Colvin set up her own practice in 1922; not until 1969 was she joined by Hal Moggridge as partner; the firm continues under their joint names. Colvin co-founded the Institute of Landscape Architects in 1929 (later the Landscape Institute), and became its president in 1951. She wrote Land and Landscape (1947, revised 1970). Colvin shared an office with Sylvia Crowe, later also president of the ILA (1957–1959). Colvin designed many gardens, e.g. with the socialite Norah Lindsay at the Manor House in Sutton Courtenay, and at Burwarton. She also worked on industrial landscaping, e.g. around power stations, and the University of East Anglia. Her own garden was at Filkins in the Cotswolds in Gloucestershire, now the office of Colvin and Moggridge. Sometimes the company opens it via the National Gardens Scheme."

  "text" : "Blair Steven Levin is an American lawyer formerly with the Federal Communications Commission, who served as the Executive Director of the National Broadband Plan from 2009 to 2010. During the Presidency of Bill Clinton he was chief of staff to FCC chairman Reed Hundt from 1993 to 1997. From 2001 through 2008, he worked as a policy analyst for Legg Mason and then Stifel Nicolaus. Barron’s Magazine noted that as an analyst, Levin “has always been on top of developing trends and policy shifts in media and telecommunications … and has proved visionary in getting out in front of many of today’s headline making events.” In 2008, he co-chaired the technology, innovation and government reform transition team for President-elect Barack Obama and subsequently served as the Executive Director for the effort that produced the National Broadband Plan. FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler has noted that as to Levin’s role in broadband policy, “no one's done more to advance broadband expansion and competition through the vision of National Broadband Plan and Gig.U.\" He has spoken at many conferences on telecommunications policy. Along with former FCC Chairman Reed Hundt, Levin authored The Politics of Abundance: How Technology Can Fix the Budget, Revive the American Dream, and Establish Obama's Legacy. He has received a number of awards for his work on broadband including “Visionary of the Year” from Computers for Youth and “Community Broadband Visionary of the Year” from the National Association of Telecommunications Officers and Advisors. He is now a non-resident fellow at the Metropolitan Policy Project of the Brookings Institution. He also is the Executive Director of the Gig.U project, a consortium of research university communities seeking to accelerate the deployment of next generation networks in the United States. The project has led to a number of communities obtaining next generation networks. He worked on the 1982 campaign of Mayor Tom Bradley's unsuccessful run for California governor and disputes the so-called Bradley Effect. From 1984 through 1993, he was a lawyer with Parker, Poe, Adams and Bernstein in Raleigh, North Carolina. He graduated summa cum laude from Yale College and is a graduate of Yale Law School."

  "text" : "Benjamin Rawlinson Faulkner (1787–1849) was an English portrait-painter. Faulkner was born in Manchester. He was at first engaged in the mercantile profession and for several years represented a large firm in their establishment at Gibraltar. When that place and its garrison were visited by the plague his health suffered so much that he was with difficulty brought home to England. This was about 1813 and during his convalescence he accidentally discovered a talent for drawing which was encouraged by his brother, J. W. Faulkner, an artist of some merit. Under his direction Faulkner devoted himself to assiduous study of the first principles of the art and spent upwards of two years in the study of the antique alone. He then came to London, and practised as a portrait-painter; but he was of so diffident a character and so retiring a disposition that his merits were not held in the same estimation in London as they were in his native town. He first exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1821, sending two portraits, and he continued to exhibit regularly up to the year before his death. His contributions were usually portraits, but he occasionally painted studies of natural objects. He resided for many years at 23 Newman Street, and died at North End, Fulham, in his sixty-third year, on 29 Oct. 1849. His best portraits are in Manchester or the neighbourhood. Portraits by him of John Dalton, F.R.S., and John McCulloch, the geologist, are in the Royal Society, London. He also contributed to the British Institution, Suffolk Street Gallery, Royal Manchester Institution, Liverpool Academy, and other exhibitions. A portrait of Sir John Ross, the Arctic explorer, was lithographed by R. J. Lane, A. R. A., and his pictures have been engraved by C. Heath, H. Robinson, and others. Besides painting, Faulkner was an accomplished musician, and was for some time organist at Irving's church in Hatton Garden. His brother was the portrait artist, Joshua Wilson Faulkner."

  "text" : "Bruce Dickins, FBA (26 October 1889 – 4 January 1978), a graduate of Magdalene College, Cambridge, was Professor of English Language at the University of Leeds from 1931 to 1946 (where he succeeded E. V. Gordon), teaching medieval English and Old Norse. He became Elrington and Bosworth Professor of Anglo-Saxon, University of Cambridge, from January 1946 until September 1957, afterwards Emeritus Professor; and Fellow of Corpus Christi College, Cambridge from 1946. He was succeeded as professor at Leeds by Harold Orton, and in some respects also by A. R. Taylor. In November 1947, when the issue of full membership of the University for women was being debated for the fourth time, and a proposal to grant full equality was proposed by a Syndicate appointed to report on the issue, there was only one speaker at the ensuing debate who opposed the proposal and that was Bruce Dickins. He \"came forward to oppose the motion. He seemed to think he would be one of a long line of disputants, but he had the floor to himself and no one bothered to counter his plea against the proposed new status for women. In his view, the women did not have any grievances which needed righting, they would gain nothing by membership of the University and, if Oxford was any example, nor would the University. Cambridge would do better to stand firm with Harvard and Yale as all-male institutions. The dim echoes of what had once been a white-hot argument found no support, and the discussion was closed."

  "text" : "Bruce Schultz (13 March 1913 – 11 January 1980) was an Australian rules footballer who played with Norwood in the South Australian National Football League (SANFL). He also played Sheffield Shield cricket for South Australia and grade cricket at East Torrens. Schultz is the full-forward in Norwood's official \"Team of the Century\" and holds the club record for most goals kicked, at 669. His best match tally of 19 goals, which included two posters, was achieved in his penultimate game. He scored 10 or more goals in a game on 12 occasions and averaged 5.4 goals a game, which for comparison is more than prolific VFL/AFL forwards Gary Ablett, Jason Dunstall and Tony Lockett managed in their careers. On the six occasions he represented the South Australian interstate team, he kicked 23 goals. Tall and thin, Schultz was a strong aerialist and started out at Norwood in 1933. He topped Norwood's goal-kicking in both 1934 and 1935 but over the next three seasons was surpassed as his club's main forward by R. J. Brown. His father, Julius, had represented the state as a first-class cricketer and he followed in his footsteps in the 1936/37 Sheffield Shield season when he was called up to the state squad. An all-rounder, Schultz was a right handed middle order batsman and right arm fast-medium bowler. He made his first-class and Shield debut at the Adelaide Oval, against New South Wales. Batting at seven, he scored 30 in the first innings and bowled first change, taking the wickets of Harold Mudge and captain Alan McGilvray for figures of 2/29. In the second innings he added another 28 runs, after being promoted one place up the order, but was only required to bowl two overs as South Australia sealed a 109 runs win. On Christmas, just a few days later, Schultz was picked for his second and final match, against Queensland at the same venue. He was used at six in both innings and scored 41 and 33. After not being required to bowl in the first innings, he bowled a couple of overs and ran-out future Test wicket-keeper Don Tallon as Queensland fell 112 runs short in their chase. In both of his matches, Schultz had the honour of bowling with Shield legend Clarrie Grimmett. In 1939, he was back to his best for Norwood and kicked 98 goals for the season, with another 90 coming in 1940 when he was club captain. On both occasions he finished the year as the leading goal-kicker at Norwood. Despite his high numbers it still wasn't enough to top the league, with North Adelaide great Ken Farmer being in his prime. Schultz finally got the better of Farmer in 1940 when he kicked exactly 100 goals for the year and won the league's goal-kicking award. He reached the milestone in Norwood's round 13 clash but moments after kicking the two goals he required, had to be taken off the field with a severe knee injury which ended his career. Before the injury he had been on track to beat the then season record of 134 goals by Farmer. He was nonetheless the first ever Norwood player to kick a century of goals and it remained their highest season tally until Neville Roberts kicked 111 goals in 1983."

  "text" : "Bertrand William Sinclair (1881–1972) was a Canadian novelist known for a series of westerns set in the United States, and also for a series of novels set in his home province of British Columbia. Sinclair was born 9 Jan 1881 in Edinburgh, Scotland, U.K. He was the son of George Bertrand and Robina (Williamson) Sinclair. His name at birth was William Brown Sinclair, but he changed it, adopting his father's middle name as his first name. He emigrated to Canada with his mother in 1889. At age 14 Sinclair ran away to Montana and became a cowboy for the next seven years. In 1903 he left Montana for Seattle and San Francisco, but returned to Montana, living in Great Falls for the next three years. In 1905 he first published stories. Also in 1905, he married author Bertha M. Brown, better known under her pen name (using her first husband's last name): B. M. Bower. Bower, a very prolific novelist, taught him to write \"productively\" and to employ a formula. Sinclair and B. M. Bower had one daughter. By 1908 Sinclair and Bower had moved to Santa Cruz, California. They divorced in 1912. The same year, Sinclair married his first wife's cousin, Ruth Brown. They had a child in 1912, a daughter. The Sinclairs moved to Vancouver, B.C., ultimately settling in Pender Harbour. Sinclair lived in Pender Harbour until his death. Sinclair's first series of work took place in Montana. Sinclair had disapproved of previous westerns he had read because he felt the action portrayed was far different that the lives cowboys actually led. When he moved to Vancouver, the settings of his works changed (except for two very late westerns). He tended to write about social causes, and worked in the timber industry prior to writing Big Timber. Later, before writing about the fishing industry, he worked as a commercial fisherman and then wrote Poor Man's Rock. Later in life, from 1936–66, he worked full-time as a licensed commercial fisherman. In writing about the outdoors, Sinclair was influenced in his portrayals by Jack London. In his works treating social causes, he was influenced by Upton Sinclair, who may have been a cousin. Over the years 1905-40 Sinclair wrote over 60 stories and 11 \"novelettes\"."

Pressure from the Texas Legislature forced her removal from the cast, and her story received national media coverage. Conrad continued her education at The University of Texas at Austin and received her Bachelor of Music degree in 1959. Barbara Conrad went on to perform with Metropolitan Opera, Vienna State Opera, Teatro Nacional in Venezuela, and many others. Today Conrad continues to complement her performing activities with artist residencies and master classes, establishing herself as one of the foremost builders of voice both in the U.S. and abroad. She is the co-director and co-founder of the Wagner Theater Program, and maintains a private vocal studio in Manhattan. Conrad works closely with The Dolph Briscoe Center for American History at The University of Texas at Austin, which is the home of the university's Endowment for the Study of American Spirituals. Barbara Smith Conrad is the subject of the Dolph Briscoe Center for American History's produced film When I Rise, directed by Mat Hames."

  "text" : "Bil Zelman (born August 24, 1972) is an American photographer and director known for his powerful, candid portraiture and spontaneous, photojournalistic style. Zelman developed a highly stylized form of hard-flash street photography while in art school  and Los Angeles Times art critic Leah Ollman compares the \"psychological density\" of his work to the likes of Garry Winogrand, Larry Fink, Diane Arbus and William Klein- photographers that are \"purposely getting it wrong in one way so as to get it right in another, disrupting visual order to ignite a kind of visceral disorder\". As described by David Hobby in an interview for Strobist, \"His airy, moment-oriented photos are loose, honest and have an unscripted, natural feel to them… [His] work has evolved (or maybe regressed?) into a look that is almost childlike\". Zelman spent his early life in Troy, New York in a \"home [that] was far from functional\". He began shooting and developing film at an early age and at nine-years-old he built his own darkroom with a friend– a place that would become his sanctuary. Zelman dropped out of school in the ninth grade and left home, roaming cross-country for several years and delving into heroin and other hard drugs while living on and off of the streets and shooting bands for places to stay. At age 19, while still attending the University at Buffalo, he managed to get his first celebrity photography assignments with artists such as David Bowie, Marilyn Manson and Trent Reznor. Zelman stated in a lecture at Ohio State University for the Columbus Society of Communicating Arts in 2010 that he was \"terrified and made mistakes and images would sometimes turn out blurry or orange, but the magazines seemed to love the naiveté of the work and kept giving [him] more assignments\". Zelman moved to Southern California in 1998 and is sought after by celebrities such as Taylor Swift, Kristen Wiig, John Legend, Louis C.K., Jerry Seinfeld, Ozzy Osbourne, and brands such as Coca-Cola, Budweiser, Guinness, Apple Inc., Microsoft, Jim Beam, Miller Brewing Co., The Frye Company, and a long list of record labels. He has been named one of the 200 Best Advertising Photographers Worldwide by Lüerzer's Archive  multiple times. In regards to his ability to capture such genuine moments under stressful conditions and time constraints Zelman states, \"Shooting good portraits is equal parts psychology, trust and technical expertise-- with the technical part probably being the least important\". Zelman published Isolated Gesture in 2013, a collection of highly stylized black and white street photography. The book was chosen for an Art Directors Club award by Albert Watson, and has hung or been added to the permanent collections of museums including The Museum of Contemporary Art, Fort Collins , The Museum of Photographic Arts , The Lucie Foundation , The Center for Fine Art Photography , The Oregon Center for Photographic Arts , the Center for Exploratory and Perceptual Arts  and others. Artweek portrays Isolated Gesture as \"a cross between S. E. Hinton's The Outsiders and Dutch genre painting\". Referencing Zelman's distinctive style, Los Angeles Times art critic Leah Ollman proclaims that Zelman's guiding principle is having an intense proximity to his subject, \"He doesn't shoot in a war zone but in the realm of ordinary life--on the street, at parties, in restaurants and stores. Working aggressively close to his subjects, and rapidly, intensifies whatever is in front of the camera\". Ollman also points out that Zelman \"revels in the burlesque opportunities of such split-second glimpses, the particular oddities that give way to general truths\". Zelman regularly engages in pro bono work for selected charities around the world and describes using the camera as a tool for social change during an interview with Rob Haggard from A Photo Editor. \"The positives to taking on these types of projects are endless. To improve the lives of others, to better your community, to art direct your own piece and have total creative freedom, to travel, to see and experience things you may have never thought possible- to be reminded that not everyone is middle class\"."

  "text" : "Bernt Bessesen Lie (13 July 1868 – 14 July 1916) was a Norwegian novelist. He was born in Mandal as a son of stipendiary magistrate Emil Bernhard Lie (1836–1891) and Nicoline Bessesen. Through his sister Ida, he was the brother-in-law of Gjert Lindebrække and an uncle of Sjur Lindebrække and Tikken Manus. Through his brother Vilhelm Lie he was an uncle of Nils Lie. Through his father's brother, writer Jonas Lie he was a first cousin of Michael Strøm Lie, writers Mons Lie and Erik Lie, and a first cousin once removed of Erik's son, the Nazi Jonas Lie. He was a second cousin of Erika Lie, Karl Nissen, painter Jonas Lie and Eyolf Soot. Lie's family soon moved away from Mandal. They lived in Trondhjem and Kristiania before moving to Tromsø when Bernt Lie was 15 years old. He finished his secondary education here in 1886, and moved to study law. He graduated with the cand.jur. degree in 1891. In October 1894 in Kristiania Bernt Lie married Hedvig Mariboe Aubert (1874–1946). They had the son Emil Lie, who became a sculptor, and their daughter Didi Lie married Supreme Court Justice, banker, politician and ambassador Arne Sunde. While the children were still young, though, Bernt Lie's family lived abroad, mainly in Rome, until 1910 when they settled in Lillehammer. His debut novel was I Æventyrland, released in 1892. Mot Overmagt (1907) is regarded as being his best book. His four boys' books are also remembered; Sorte Ørn (1893), Svend Bidevind (1897), Peter Napoleon (1900) and Guttedage (1905). His last book was En Racekamp (1915). He wrote popular books, and was one of the more widely read authors in his time. He died in July 1916 in Sandefjord, and was buried in Tromsø."

  "text" : "Bertie Victor Kirby CBE DCM (2 May 1887 – 1 September 1953) was a British politician. He was Labour Member of Parliament (MP) for Liverpool Everton from 1935 to 1950. Kirby inspired the headline \"Once Errand Boy in Local Store – Now M P\" in the Tewkesbury Register of 16 November 1935 after he had been elected for Labour as M.P. for Everton with a majority of 177. Kirby was described by the newspaper as a \"former soldier and policemen\" born in Cheltenham but came to Tewkesbury as a baby. The 1891 and 1901 censuses confirm that he was living in Mount Pleasant Road (3 Pansy Cottages; the family was still living in Pansy Cottages during the 1909 Land Tax Survey), Tewkesbury and had been born in Cheltenham. His father, Henry Kirby, was a 51-year-old gardener, born in Prestbury, Gloucestershire and his mother, Fanny, was aged 54 and had been born in Gloucester. Bertie then had two older sisters. He was educated at the Barton Road Schools, Tewkesbury, and, on leaving, became an errand boy for Frisby's shoe shop then located at \"The Cross\" – the location of a War Memorial, in Tewkesbury. It was claimed that he moved to a branch in Upton-upon-Severn but, by the 1911 Census, he had joined the army and was then \"Bombardier, Royal Horse Artillery, on sick\" again living with his parents at 78 Marle Hill Parade, Cheltenham. As a Reservist in 1914, he is listed as \"A. Kirby\" on the \"Memorial to Those who Volunteered\" located in Tewkesbury Abbey. Subsequently he became a Battery Sergeant Major (49135) and was awarded the DCM on 22 September 1917. The newspaper reported, \"While six ammunition wagons were being unloaded, a sudden and intense fire was opened, and a scene of great confusion ensued; it was very dark, and the drivers were unable to see what to do in their gas masks. He removed his smoke helmet and assisted the officer in charge to restore order and by doing so saved a considerable block in the traffic which would have caused heavy casualties. His coolness and presence of mind under heavy fire set a very fine example at a time when it was most needed.\" Kirby's medal record confirms the D.C.M. as well as four more general medals. As he had re-enlisted on 5 November 1914, he was awarded the 1914 Star. Despite using the testimony of his sister-in-law, the newspaper erred when it stated that he married in 1917 because the marriage was recorded in March qtr 1916; his bride was Alice E. Richmond of Ashchurch, whose father H. Richmond worked for Midland Railway. After the war, Kirby joined the Liverpool City Police .However, in his obituary it is claimed that \"A year before the war broke out he had gone to Liverpool and, soon after the war, became district official of the National Union of Clerks and Administrative Workers. Kirby was first elected to the Liverpool City Council in 1924, when he won the Everton ward from the Conservatives. In 1939 he was elected an Alderman. His work in Liverpool – other than his tireless efforts in the Labour interest – included the deputy chairmanship of the Liverpool Education Committee (as well as membership of others) and the representation of organised Labour on the Merseyside Hospitals Council, and many other bodies. In 1935 he won the Everton division of Liverpool from the Conservatives and he held the seat until the division ceased to exist in 1950 after the redistribution of constituencies. The new M.P. wrote a letter of thanks on 20 November 1935 when living at 710 Queens Drive, Knotty Ash, Liverpool 13. He wrote, \"I spent all my young life in Tewkesbury, of which I am quite proud.......\". After his election, he was known as Captain Bertie Kirby (1887 – 1 September 1953) and represented the Everton Constituency until it was abolished on 23 February 1950. In total, Hansard records 825 interventions, the first dated 6 December 1935 when, in the Debate on the Address he criticised the means testing of the unemployed. His last recorded contribution was on 9 December 1948 when he received a Written Answer concerning the Departmental Claims Branch, Liverpool. His obituary continues, \"In the House of Commons, Kirby was hard working back-bench member. He was a member of the famous Select Committee on National Expenditure during the war, a member of the Public Accounts Committee after the war, and chairman of the Select Committee on Estimates from 1946 to 1950. Such a member is invaluable in the House, giving disinterested service and seeking none of the limelight. Few men more thoroughly earned the honour which he was given in 1947, when he was created CBE for public services.\" He then fought the newly created West Derby division of Liverpool but was defeated by Sir David Maxwell-Fyfe. Kirby's death, aged 66, was registered in the September qtr. of 1953 in the Liverpool North District Vol. 10d, page 301 His obituary appeared in The Times."

He has two podcasts, one which he runs with the help of a friend, Jason Jones, and the other on Warpath.TV with George Force, Mike Zucker, and Anthony Carboni. Most of Heckendorn's mods are done by taking apart old video game consoles such as the Atari 2600 and Nintendo Entertainment System. He then reconfigures internal printed circuit board (PCB) into a smaller form factor. The newly configured circuit board is enclosed within a custom case (done by a CNC machine) and any peripherals are assembled by Heckendorn. His creations have been featured in such publications as Wired, Popular Science, and Maxim, and on television shows such as The Screen Savers, Attack of the Show!, and X-Play. His mods are also commonly presented on popular blogs such as Engadget."

  "text" : "Bernie Hayes is an Australian singer/songwriter who has released four albums as a solo artist and written songs for other Australian artists notably \"You Made Me Hard\" which was the third single from The Whitlams Love This City album. Hayes was born and raised in Canberra and was a member of a musical family (including brothers Pat Hayes of Stella One Eleven and formerly of the Falling Joys, Justin Hayes of Whopping Big Naughty and the late Anthony Hayes (aka Stevie Plunder) of The Whitlams and The Plunderers fame). He began playing around the wine bars of Canberra at age 15, and among his first bands was Secret Seven. Hayes later relocated to Sydney along with a number of other Canberra musicians, including his brothers. He first came to public prominence when he joined Club Hoy in 1990. He played on that bands Thursday's Fortune album released in 1991 which enjoyed a positive critical response and minor chart success. Grant McLennan of The Go-Betweens produced the band's first single \"Da Da Da Da/Green and Blue\". Club Hoy later played on of McLennan's solo albums. (1) After the break-up of Club Hoy, Hayes and Julia Richardson of Club Hoy formed a new group called the Troublemakers. However the Troublemakers failed to enjoy much success. (2) Hayes is perhaps best known among fans, however, as a member of The Shout Brothers (aka The Shouties) with brothers Anthony and Pat and drummer Pete Velzen. The band held a Sunday afternoon residency at the Sandringham Hotel in Newtown, Sydney through the 1980s until 1996, playing a mix of covers and original songs. They released two albums: Colossus and Indelible. In 1996, Hayes' younger brother Anthony, of The Whitlams, committed suicide. Bernie Hayes played guitar on The Whitlams Eternal Nightcap released later in 1997. (3) Hayes released his first solo album Every Tuesday, Sometimes Sunday in late 1999. The album was acoustic-based and included material that he had written since the beginning of his musical career. (4) The album featured several singles in \"Mission in Life\", \"Matchbox Cars and Marbles\" and \"Your Boyfriend's Back in Town\" with \"Mission in Life\" receiving airplay on Triple J. (5) The Whitlams recorded a track from the album \"You Made Me Hard\" on their 1999 Love This City album. It was released as the third single from the album in 2001 with Hayes present in the studio for the recording of the single. (6) After the release of his solo album, Hayes put together a band, the Bernie Hayes Quartet, featuring John Encarnacao, Bill Gibson and Jess Ciampa. He played with his band and solo on the ABC Television program Love Is a Four Letter Word in 2001. He released his second album Domestic Departures in 2003 with the band. Genevieve Maynard and Peter O'Doherty of Mental As Anything produced the album while Nic Dalton, formerly of The Lemonheads produced the first single \"Your Green Light\". (7) More recently, Hayes has worked with Bow Campbell of Front End Loader and Brendan Gallagher of Karma County as the Dead Marines. His third album, Homebody was released in 2007 and was followed in 2015 by Slow Fix."

  "text" : "Edwin Coppock, Barclay's brother, redirects here. Barclay Coppock (January 4, 1839 – September 4, 1861) was a follower of John Brown and a Union Army soldier in the American Civil War. Along with his brother Edwin Coppock (June 30, 1835 – December 16, 1859), he participated in Brown's raid on Harpers Ferry. In historic documents their last name was variously spelled \"Coppock\", \"Coppoc\", or \"Coppac\". The Coppock brothers were raised in Springdale, Iowa, where they met Brown while he was raising support for his Kansas anti-slavery raids. Edwin was hanged in Charlestown, Virginia and is buried in Hope Cemetery in Salem, Ohio. Barclay escaped, returning to Springdale and eventually escaping to Canada. On January 23, 1860, about three months after the Harpers Ferry raid, Iowa governor Samuel Kirkwood received from a representative of the governor of Virginia a requisition \"for one Barclay Coppock, reputed to be a fugitive from the justice of Virginia\". Kirkwood found the requisition deficient in legal form and returned it to Virginia. Barclay was gone by the time Kirkwood received the corrected papers. Barclay later joined the Union Army during the American Civil War and served as a recruiting officer. He was killed in action when Confederate sabotage derailed his train over the Platte River, an incident called the Platte Bridge Railroad Tragedy."

His close ties to the Philippines enabled him to persuade the Bishop of Honolulu to allow several Philippine religious orders and diocesan clergy to minister to the growing number of Filipino immigrants to Hawaii. Pope John XXIII appointed Father Vierra as a prothonotary apostolic, with the title of monsignor, the first in the diocese of Honolulu, the highest non-episcopal prelate entitled to wear the mitre and to pontificate at liturgy, with due regard for the precedence of the diocesan bishop in accordance with Roman Pontifical. He remains the only Hawai‘i cleric on whom this honor has been conferred. He also served as vicar general of the Diocese of Honolulu."

  "text" : "Sir Beauchamp St John (1594-1667) was an English politician who sat in the House of Commons variously between 1621 and 1653. He supported the Parliamentary side in the English Civil War. St John was a son of Oliver St John, 3rd Baron St John of Bletso and his wife Dorothy Reid, daughter of Sir John Rede or Reid, of Odington, Gloucestershire. He was knighted on 24 July 1619 at Bletsoe together with his brother Henry. In 1621 St John was elected Member of Parliament for Bedfordshire. He was elected MP for Bedford in 1626 and again in 1628. He sat until 1629 when King Charles decided to rule without parliament for eleven years. In 1625 he inherited through his wife the manor of Tilbrook. In April 1640, St John was elected MP for Bedford in the Short Parliament. He was re-elected for Bedford for the Long Parliament in November 1640, where he was active at least in 1643 and remained in support of the parliamentary cause. St John married Rebecca Hawkins on the 13 Oct. 1613, she was the daughter of William Hawkins of Tilbrook. He had a son who died young and a daughter. His elder brother Oliver inherited the Barony and became Earl of Bolingbroke. His brother Alexander sat as MP for Bedford before him."

  "text" : "Bob Dunn (March 5, 1908 – January 31, 1989) was an American cartoonist, entertainer and gagwriter who drew several comic strips. In addition to his own strips, Dunn was known for his work on Jimmy Hatlo's Little Iodine and They'll Do It Every Time. King Features syndicated Dunn's Just the Type from May 5, 1946 to November 24, 1963. It ran in the New York Journal-American and several other newspapers. Comics historian Allan Holtz commented: Never a syndication success, King Features may well have let him do the feature just to keep him happy while working on the Hatlo cash cow feature... When Hatlo died in 1963, though, Dunn's workload presumably got that much heavier and Just the Type was dropped. Dunn finally got an official byline on They'll Do It Every Time starting in 1966. Dunn began his career at King Features. He submitted gags to newspapers and magazines and sold skits to Earl Carroll for his Vanities on Broadway in 1930-31. In 1936, \"he invented the knock-knock joke\" (according to The World Encyclopedia of Cartoons) in a book he wrote that sold over two million copies. More successful books followed including I'm Gonna Be a Father, Hospital Happy, One Day in the Army and Magic for All."

  "text" : "Bernard Moffatt was born in Peel, Isle of Man in April 1946. Both his mother (Millie Cashin) and father (James Moffatt) were Manx. He was educated at Peel Clothworkers School, a stroke of luck for someone who would become a leading figure in the Nationalist movement, because at that time schools which promoted Manx cultural affairs were the exception. Peel School, although then under the headship of a Yorkshireman (George Sayle), was one such, so Manx History and Culture was on the agenda. Manx dancing classes at the School were organised by Mona Douglas, an icon of the Manx cultural revival, and Moffatt was enrolled in one of those teams. \"I'm now a fully committed Manx Nationalist\" he said, and the start of this was the emphasis placed at school on Manx history art and culture. \"We used to have Mona Douglas round to talk to us – and I was in the Manx folk dancing team\". In his youth Moffatt came to know several significant figures (all from the west of the island) on the Manx nationalist and language scene (the brothers Walter and Leslie Quirk, Jack Irving and Alfie Cooil), although at that time there was no official Nationalist Party."

  "text" : "Bernard Rothman better known as Benny Rothman (1 June 1911 - 23 January 2002) was a UK political activist, most famous for his leading role in the Mass trespass of Kinder Scout in 1932. Born in Cheetham Hill, Manchester, into a Jewish family from Romania, Rothman's poor family circumstances dictated that he start work at the earliest opportunity rather than take full advantage of a scholarship that he had won. Working as an errand boy in the motor trade, he studied geography and economics in his spare time while his Aunt Ettie introduced him to The Ragged Trousered Philanthropists and the works of Upton Sinclair. Increasingly committed to the causes of socialism and communism, Rothman lost his job after getting into some trouble with the law while selling copies of the Daily Worker. During a period of unemployment, with the help of a bicycle salvaged from spare parts, he discovered the nearby wilderness regions of the Peak District and North Wales. The combination of his political activism and interest in the outdoors led to his participation in the mass trespass of 1932, an enterprise that resulted in a spell in prison and further employment difficulties. In 1934, Rothman went to work at Avro in Newton Heath and instantly became an officer of the Amalgamated Engineering Union (AEU). At Avro, he met and married fellow communist Lily Crabtree but his political views became increasingly visible to his employer and he was dismissed. Rothman was active in working with Jewish groups in Manchester to oppose the campaigns of Oswald Mosley's British Union of Fascists. In 1936, he started work at Metropolitan-Vickers at Trafford Park and was again soon an AEU official. Until his death from a stroke, he was active in a wide range of political and conservation movement campaigns and organisations. Professor Harry Rothman is his son."

  "text" : "Bill (or William) Hook (May 28, 1925 – May 10, 2010), born in New Rochelle, New York, was a Chess master and the Captain of the British Virgin Islands chess team. Starting in 1968, Hook led the Virgin Islands team, and later the British Virgin Islands team, at numerous Chess Olympiads, mostly playing top board. At the Malta Olympiad of 1980, Hook won the gold medal on board 1 for best percentage result of any national team member. He defeated a grandmaster and several national champions along the way. To commemorate this achievement the British Virgin Islands issued a stamp in his honor. During the preliminary rounds of the 1970 Siegen Olympiad, the Virgin Islands were paired with the USA team and Hook famously faced the legendary Bobby Fischer. Playing the black pieces, Hook ventured a pet line of the French Defence whereupon an exciting encounter developed, culminating in a stylish rook sacrifice by Fischer. Hook authored a book as well as various magazine and newspaper articles about chess. In the art world, he is known for his one-man shows in painting and photography. He lived in Washington DC, with his wife Mimi, until his death on May 10, 2010."

As well, he was the owner of the Los Angeles Dons of the All-America Football Conference. Widely respected Hall of Fame trainer Jimmy Jones of Calumet Farm was quoted by Sports Illustrated as saying that Lindheimer \"was the savior of Chicago racing\" and that \"Arlington Park became the finest track in the world—certainly the finest I've ever been on.\"  Lindheimer is well remembered as the person who promoted the 1955 match race broadcast by CBS Television in which Preakness and Belmont Stakes winner Nashua defeated Kentucky Derby winner, Swaps. In 1932, Lindheimer managed the successful election campaign for Henry Horner, who was elected Democratic Governor of Illinois. Benjamin Lindheimer died in 1960 at his vacation home in Beverly Hills, California. His remains were returned to Chicago for burial in Rosehill Cemetery. Following its creation, Benjamin Lindheimer was inducted in the Chicagoland Sports Hall of Fame. Long involved with the business, adopted daughter Marjorie Lindheimer Everett took over management of the racetracks. Funds from his estate were used by his widow to create the Lindheimer Astrophysical Research Center at Northwestern University."

He was a wingman in the 1923 premiership side, captained by his brother Vern. A Western Australian interstate representative, he made four appearances in the 1924 Hobart Carnival. He played for his state on one further occasion and kicked eight goals in total from his five matches. When a \"Team of the Century\" was named in 2006, based on the period 1906 to 1944, Harrold was named on a half forward flank. He was also a good enough cricketer to represent Western Australia in a first-class fixture during the 1925/26 cricket season, against a Herbie Collins-led Australian XI at the WACA. He was the last person to bat in the first innings but contributed an unbeaten 21. A right-arm fast bowler, he then took 2/89 from 21 overs with the ball, taking the wickets of both openers, the Australian XI captain and Jack Ryder. When Harrold batted the second time, Ryder trapped him leg before wicket without scoring, to give his side victory by an innings and 45 runs."

  "text" : "Baldwin of Antioch (died September 17, 1176) was a Frankish knight and general in service of the Byzantine Empire during the Byzantine–Seljuk Wars. He was the only son of Raynald of Châtillon and Constance, the Queen Regent of Antioch, and brother-in-law of Byzantine Emperor Manuel I Komnenos. An ally of the Emperor in his battles against the Seljuk Turks, Baldwin was one of his most trusted advisors and the only one of Manuel's senior commanders \"of Western origin\". He commanded the right wing of the Byzantine forces guarding the siege and baggage train, largely composed of Latin mercenaries, at the Battle of Myriokephalon on September 17, 1176. Upon approaching narrow Tzibritze Pass, the Seljuks launched an attack on Manuel's marching troops. Baldwin led a cavalry charge attempting to drive the Turks from the hills in a counterattack but was surrounded and killed together with all his men. In Byzantium: The Decline and Fall (1996), English historian John Julius Norwich described the aftermath of Baldwin's death (taken from the Byzantine historian Choniates, whose comments are not always unbiased); Had Manuel shown something of the same spirit, the day might have been saved; but at this of all moments his courage deserted him. In a hasty council of war he horrified his senior officers by suddenly announcing his intention of taking flight. The commanding general Andronicus Contostephanus made a strong protest, his words being echoed by a common soldier who, having overheard the discussion, bitterly reproached the Emperor for wishing to abandon an army whose loss was due entirely to his own imprudence. Manuel reluctantly agreed to remain; but his reputation was badly injured and was never fully to recover."

To some, Cheong is a \"pioneering customer of the unique, academic, often controversial and almost alws misunderstood\". Cheong helped formulate the transparent jury system, and, a new carefully audited and numbered voting system for Grand Prix d'Horlogerie de Geneve in 2002, a contest among high-end watch manufacturers. Subsequently, he also helped to bring the annual Grand Prix d'Horlogerie de Geneve to Asia. He is the first non-industry “civilian” chairman of the board, as well as one of the eight jurors from around the world. Although he is a partner of Lifeline Medical Group, one of the largest medical groups in Singapore, Cheong is better known as an active party animal among high society circles as an eclectic watch collector and horologist, and is often seen at events with his wife, Dolly Ong, whom he married in 1989. In 2003, he was listed in Asia Tatler’s Top 300 list. In 2004, he became the first man to appear on the cover of Prestige, a lifestyle magazine about rich people for rich people. In addition, he was awarded the Tatler Leadership Award for style in 2005. In the following year, he appeared in Tatler’s Asia-wide list for top 100 people to know in Asia. Cheong currently resides in Singapore with his wife, Dolly Ong, and two daughters, Patricia and Cheryl. Ong is currently the financial controller with Lifeline Medical Group."

  "text" : "Brad Steward is a former professional snowboarder and is the founder of Bonfire Snowboarding. Steward was one of the first entrepreneurs of the snowboard industry. Steward attended film school in Ventura, California at the Brooks Institute but chose to pursue a career in the snowboarding industry. Steward began working for Sims in 1989 and became the marketing director by 1990. He then moved to the newly founded Morrow Snowboards in Salem, Oregon, to co-own the company and serve as Vice President. While working with Sims and Morrow, Steward was in the process of developing his own company. In 1989, Steward created three unique t-shirts featuring the word “bonfire” enlarged in rough copy, directly from an old Sears brand typewriter. In the early stages, Steward called the company Bonfire Think Tank Designs. Steward’s company – now called Bonfire Snowboarding – has become one of the leading snowboard-apparel brands on the market, with offices in 39 Countries. In 1998 Steward and Burton founder Jake Burton sued U.S. Skiing over the Olympic qualification process for snowboarders, which resulted in a settlement that produced the Grand Prix series for snowboarders to enter the Olympics. In 2000 Steward left his active role at Bonfire to pursue his lifelong interest in film. He directed commercials, music videos and more, for U.S. and UK based clients ranging from Sony Records and the Cartoon Network - winning an Addy Award from the American Federation of Advertising for his comedy commercial work, The Sniffer. In 2003 Brad returned to Bonfire to direct the brand from their office in Portland, Oregon. In 2010 Steward lead the acquisition team for Amer Sports, in the purchase of Reykjavik, Iceland-based brand, Nikita. In 2011 Steward created and lead the team at Amer Sports in Design and Development of digitally enabled apparel. Brad Steward is a frequent motivational speaker on entrepreneurial skills, digital and big data and economic development. His speeches range from Keynote at the Oregon Economic Development Pub Talk series in Central Oregon, to the Global Sports Management Summit; where Brad was a featured speaker to NFL, NBA and MLB owners."

His credits, which spanned more than fifty years and encompassed hundreds of hours, included episodes of Full House, Sanford and Son, Amen, Marblehead Manor and You Again?. Foster directed the 1967 pilot episode of Rowan & Martin's Laugh-In, which earned him the only Emmy nomination of his career. Foster went on to direct the television broadcasts of the 23rd and 24th Primetime Emmy Awards in 1971 and 1972 respectively. He also directed the AFI Life Achievement Award: A Tribute to James Cagney in 1974, for which he won a Directors Guild of America Award in 1975. In 1986, Foster directed the now infamous live syndicated special, The Mystery of Al Capone's Vaults, which was hosted by Geraldo Rivera. The special, which advertised the potential to find the secrets of Al Capone buried in a vault beneath the Lexington Hotel in Chicago, turned up very little. Foster spent much of his career directing television sitcoms, especially during the 1970s and 1980s. He directed 43 episodes of the sitcom, Benson, between 1982 and 1986. Foster also directed 36 separate episodes of NBC's Amen, which starred Sherman Hemsley and Clifton Davis, between 1986 and 1989. Foster largely retired after directing 23 episodes of the ABC television series, Full House, from 1989 to 1990. Foster died of cancer on February 2, 2011, in Los Angeles, California, at the age of 78. He was survived by his wife, Lynn, and children, Julia and Susan."

  "text" : "Bill Bailey (27 September 1933 - 28 April 2009) was known as \"the father of British surfing\" for the crucial role he played in the development of the sport in the United Kingdom. He set up the first surf company in Britain. Bailey grew up in Inglesbatch, in Somerset where his father withdrew him from school at age 14 due to his behaviour, and placed him in the Royal Air Force. There he trained as an engineer working on Short Sunderland flying boats and taking postings overseas. It was while working on air-sea rescue in Sri Lanka that he developed a love of the sea, quitting the air-force at the end of the 1950s and moving to Newquay to work as a lifeguard. Bailey began building life-saving equipment including a surf ski in 1961, designed to be used by lifeguards with paddles. While tinkering with the design he met two Australians on their way to the US, and was impressed with the foam core and fibre-glass construction of their surf boards. He bought one and learned to use it, becoming one of the first native surfers in Britain. In 1964 he began constructing surf boards himself and the following year formed a partnership with Bob Head to set up the European Surfing Company. Under its surfboard brand, BilBo, it produced around 12,000 boards over the next eight years. In the late 1960s A Bilbo shop was opened outside the train station of Newquay, which was quickly becoming the UK surfing capital."

  "text" : "Andrea Giuseppe \"Beppe\" Croce (11 December 1914 – 16 September 1986) was a sailor and yachtsman from Genova, Italy. Yachting: from 1969 to his death in 1986, Croce was the first non-British president of the International Sailing Federation. Croce was also the president of the Italian Sailing Federation (Federazione Italiana Vela) from 1957 to 1981 and of the Yacht Club Italiano from 1958 to 1986; he also was the vice president of the CONI (Comitato Olimpico Nazionale Italiano) for a long time.In 1939 Croce won the Italian University Star Class championship, while in 1969 he won the 5.50 class Italian Championship on Lake Garda, where in 1964 he had also won a very peculiar edition of the Centomiglia regatta, finished by only three out of fifty participant boats due to the presence of very severe weather conditions.Croce also competed in the 6 metre class at the 1948 Summer Olympics and contributed organizing the 1960 Naples sailing Olympics as the president of the Olympic Committee.In 1952, together with his friend René Levainville, Croce founded the famous Giraglia Cup, a regatta between St. Tropez and Genova organized by the Yacht Club Italiano in collaboration with the Yacht Club de France, which nowadays involves hundreds of sailors and maxi yachts.Croce played also a key role in the organization of the 1982 Azzurra America's Cup Challenge, the first Italian America's Cup challenge, financed by his friend and former Fiat president Gianni Agnelli; the boat competed under the patronage of the Yacht Club Costa Smeralda, founded by Karim Aga Khan. Together with Agnelli, Croce had previously visited President John Fitzgerald Kennedy in order to persuade him to accept the Italian challenge. After Croce's death, a memorial celebration was held at London's Westminster Cathedral. The ceremony was attended, among others, by HRH Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, King Constantine II of Greece, King Olaf V of Norway and Prince Aga Khan IV.In memory of Beppe Croce, the International Sailing Federation presents every year since 1989 the prestigious ISAF Beppe Croce Trophy to an individual who has made an outstanding voluntary contribution to the sport of sailing: the roll of honour is an impressive one, including multiple Olympic medallists, rules gurus and designers. During his life Croce assembled a unique collection of Yacht Portrait Paintings from 1800, which adorned the walls of his house in the beloved Portofino, where he also owned the famous Hotel Splendido. Recently, his family gifted the Galata Museo del Mare in Genova, Croce's hometown, with more than 100 paintings from such collection, which are now permanently on show at the museum's Beppe Croce Gallery."

He served as Director of Ambulatory Services at the Bronx Municipal Hospital Center until 1992, when he was dismissed by Dean Dominick Purpura. He coined the mantra, \"see one, do one, teach one, kill one,\" a play on the dictum \"see one, do one, teach one,\" that had shaped medical education in the United States during the 1970s. Bell had also served for many years on the Board of Directors of the Griffon Corporation. Bell died at his Manhattan home on October 4, 2016, of kidney failure at the age of 86."

  "text" : "Boris Lvovich Vasilyev (Russian: Бори́с Льво́вич Васи́льев; 21 May 1924, Smolensk – 11 March 2013, Moscow) was a Soviet writer. He is considered the last representative of the so-called \"lieutenant prose\", a group of former low-ranking Soviet officers who dramatised their traumatic World War II experience. After his World War II service, Vasiliev enrolled at the Malinovsky Tank Academy. His short novel The Dawns Here Are Quiet was a Soviet bestseller, selling 1.8 million copies within a year after its publication in 1969. It was adapted for the stage and the screen; there is also an opera by Kirill Molchanov, and a Chinese TV series based on the story. The Dawns Here Are Quiet was the first of Vasiliev's sentimental patriotic tales of female heroism in the Second World War (\"Not on the Active List\", 1974; \"Tomorrow There Came War\", 1984) which brought him renown in the Soviet Union, China, and other communist countries. Some of his books give a harsh picture of life in Stalin's Russia. Vasiliev's short novel Don't Shoot the White Swans (1973), a milestone of Russian-language environmental fiction, is sharply critical of \"the senseless destruction of beautiful creatures and the exploitation of nature for personal gain\". It was made into a 1980 Soviet film. Vasiliev was awarded the USSR State Prize for 1975 and was a member of the jury at the 39th Berlin International Film Festival. In 1989, he quit the USSR Communist Party but grew disillusioned with the Perestroika rather quickly. In October 1993, he signed the Letter of Forty-Two. Late in life, Vasiliev turned to historical fiction based on incidents from medieval Russian chronicles."

He served at the Franciscan mission to the Navajo at St. Michaels, Arizona, and at other missions in the Southwest, from 1901 to 1954, where he developed an interest in Navajo language and culture. He helped devise a written alphabet of the Navajo language and published a four volume work on learning Navajo. In 1929 Haile attended the Catholic University of America and obtained a master's degree. He then accepted the position of Research Associate in Anthropology at the University of Chicago. He made a field trip with Edward Sapir through Navajo land that was sponsored by the Laboratory of Anthropology at Santa Fe, New Mexico. Haile devised a new Navajo alphabet containing over sixty characters. His other major work dealt with the creation story of the Navajo, Diné Bahaneʼ. Haile was awarded a Doctor of Letters degree from St. Bonaventure University in 1951, and a Doctor of Laws degree in 1952 from the University of New Mexico. In 1953 the Navajo Tribal Council passed a resolution which read in part: \"Father Berard Haile has spent his life among the Navajo people learning to know and understand us and our religion, and has, more than any other living non-Indian, through close contact with Navajos and the medicine men of our tribe and by his indefatigable labor, reduced our language to written form and succeeded in preserving for future generations the knowledge of the Navajo history and religion.\""

In the 10 mile Australian race, Heseltine and fellow Queenslander Ken Caves put a lap on the rest of the field, allowing them to go head to head for the title. With a lap to go, Cave lead, but Heseltine joined Cave with 300 yards to go. It wasn't until the last 50 yards that Heseltine hit the front. He went on to beat Cave by a bike's length. He was then selected for the Empire Games in February 1950, where he won the Gold Medal in games record time. Heseltine went on to win a large number of Queensland titles as well as 3 Australian Championships. Bill Heseltine missed a real chance at an Australian call up for the 1952 Olympic team when he suffered an horrific bike smash."

Luxton was born in the Falkland Islands and educated in the United Kingdom before moving back to the islands to manage his family's farm at Chartres. In 1982 Argentina invaded and occupied the Falklands for 74 days during which time Luxton was identified by the Argentine military junta as a potential troublemaker. Along with his wife, Patricia, and their children, Luxton was deported to the UK where he became notable for giving numerous interviews about his experiences with the Argentine military. Luxton and his family returned to the islands at the end of the Falklands War. Luxton's portfolios in the Falkland Islands Government included Civil Aviation, Development Corporation, Aquaculture and Rural Development. Luxton is noted for his strong criticism of Argentina's policy on the Falkland Islands. Luxton resigned from the Legislative Assembly in 2011 due to his prologued absence from the Falklands, which was increasing the workload on other MLAs. He was replaced by Ian Hansen in an uncontested by-election."

He settled in Anchorage, Alaska after the war and practiced law until his appointment in 1959 to be the first Chief Justice of the newly created Alaska Supreme Court. Given three years to set up the new state's courts, he accomplished the job in 6 months. He served on the court until 1970, when an airplane accident led him to resign for reasons of health. Nesbett was also involved with an effort to reopen an Alaskan coal mine; he was president of the Buffalo Coal Mining Company and suffered financial losses when the company was unable to successfully reopen the mine. Nesbett married Enid Elsie \"Barbara\" Allen, an English nurse whom he met in England during the war; he left 6 children, 2 sons and 4 daughters, at the time of his death. The state courthouse in Anchorage is named in his honor."

Two years later his habilitation followed on Johannes Zwick und die Reformation in Konstanz (John Zwick and the Reformation in Constance) at the University of Heidelberg. In 1964 he succeeded Ernst Wolf as the chair of church history with an emphasis on Reformation history at the University of Göttingen, and he taught there until his retirement in 1999 . He was succeeded in turn by Thomas Kaufmann. Moeller is a specialist in general church history and the urban history in the late medieval and the Reformation era. He was chairman of the Society for Reformation Research. Moeller has taken part in the publication of nearly 40 books. His Geschichte des Christentums in Grundzügen (History of Christianity in Outline) has gone through ten editions. Of particular importance is Ökumenische Kirchengeschicht (Ecumenical Church History) a project jointly edited with Raymond Kottje which first appeared in 1970. This work showed from its first appearance that church history had entered a new era. In 1998 he received an honorary doctorate from the University of Zurich."

He is also a Melbourne Marathon Spartan Legend which means he has completed every Melbourne Marathon since the event began in 1978(along with seven(7) other runners: Look here:  ), and in 2016 it will have its 39th Edition when hopefully all 8 Legends will all complete their 39th Melbourne Marathon. Bruce was the Australian Ambassador for the Comrades Marathon from 2008 until 2015, and now is the second person along with Mr Mark Bloomfield from Washington DC to be granted the status of \"Ambassador at Large\" for the Comrades Marathon Association. The Comrades Marathon which is held annually in South Africa, and as of 2015, Bruce has successfully finished 7 Comrades Marathons. Bruce is also an Ambassador for the Townsville Marathon (Far North Queensland) run on the 1st Sunday of August every year since 1970.() Bruce has also run Marathons in Europe, USA and Asia.(Including London, Stockholm, New York, Mumbai and Boston). Bruce's running achievements are very modest when compared to the elite runners of this world, but his commitment and dedication is rarely equaled. He regularly signs up to lead 'Pacing groups' in various Marathons, therefore by passing a chance to get the best out of himself, rather he regular focus's his effort into helping others do their best. Bruce leads pacing groups and has led groups in four (4) different countries (Australia, India (Mumbai: 2012/2014), New Zealand (Rotorua 2014, Auckland 2015) and USA (New York 2014)). In Australia, he regularly leads pacing groups in the Melbourne, Canberra, Sydney, Gold Coast and Sunshine Coast Marathons. Bruce's Marathon PB(PR), is 2hours 47mins and 02 secs, and he has run Sub 3hours nine(9)times. Bruce is also the Race Director/Race Co-ordinator of the following races: Maidenwell Marathon Weekend The \"Time Honoured\" Lamington Classic, Australia's oldest trail run. The Australia Day Running Festival Over the years Bruce has written many articles on his running experiences, or has had articles written about him, and here are the latest two from Australia's top selling running magazine \"Run For your Life\":[[]] In his travels, Bruce leaves more behind than footprints, at the moment his philanthropy extends to two(2) schools in South Africa, besides being generous with certain worthy causes within Australia. Away from running, Bruce runs his own Geotechnical Business with a base in both Brisbane and Sydney(and has so for over 30 years), so he understands what it takes to survive both in his running shoes and the world of business. Bruce is also a corporate speaker who has over 40 years of running and motivational stories to tell."

  "text" : "Brian R. Price is an American university professor, author, editor, publisher, martial arts instructor of the Italian school of swordsmanship, reconstructive armorer, and member of the Society for Creative Anachronism. He is Assistant Professor of History at Hawai'i Pacific University, where he offers courses in the history of warfare, in counterinsurgency, and in strategy at the graduate and undergraduate levels, leveraging his long study of medieval topics and his recent experience in Afghanistan as an advisor. He speaks regularly at conferences both for his current field on counterinsurgency and in his earlier, and now secondary field, on chivalric topics. His page at  lists his current and recent research projects. He began his studies of medieval history in 1990, but began to shift his interests as the Afghan and Iraq wars progressed, increasingly emphasizing aspects of modern military theory, especially ways through which culture, doctrine and military practice interweave. This remains the center of his research agenda today. Recently he has spoken at the UK Ministry of Defence, appeared on television to discuss the situation in Ukraine, and given a paper at the World History Conference. Price is perhaps best known for his work, Techniques of Medieval Armour Reproduction, which has been favorably reviewed and sold more than 20,000 copies worldwide. It was cited more than 35 times in the recent 2012 Ph.D. Dissertation by Nikolaus Dupras. Dupras writes, \"Techniques of Medieval Armour Reproduction is one of the most complete accounts written on the armourer’s art. Geared heavily towards technique, it is intended as a manual which discusses the steps of armour-making from design to fabrication. Though not comprehensive, the complexity of the task is well represented.\" Price originally founded The Chivalry Bookshelf in 1992 to publish Chronique, the Journal of Chivalry,but eventually began publishing books about Western Martial Arts, arms and armor, and the subject of chivalry. The press produced twenty-six titles between 2001 and 2010, when Price suspended operations in order to prepare for deployment to Afghanistan. He and his wife Ann also jointly ran Revival Enterprises during the same period, which developed a popular line of leather and sundries for re-enactment and Western martial arts practitioners. Previously he co-founded the American Company of Saint George, a medieval-styled \"tournament society\" that, together with Chronique: The Journal of Chivalry, helped to inspire many other similar tournament societies throughout North America, in Europe and in Australia. Price is a co-founder and, until early 2011, was the long-time curriculum director of the Schola Saint George school of Historical European martial arts. Currently he teaches swordsmanship in Honolulu and remains affiliated with the Schola Saint George."

He founded the Dielectrics Group in Trinity College Dublin where he is Fellow Emeritus and formerly Professor of Electromagnetism and of Engineering Science. Scaife showed that in a linear system the decay function is directly proportional to the autocorrelation function of the corresponding fluctuating macroscopic variable, and proved how the spectral density of the dipole moment fluctuations of a dielectric body could be calculated from the frequency dependence of the complex permittivity, ε (ω) = ε'(ω) – iε\"(ω). It was independent of Ryogo Kubo who in 1957 developed the corresponding theory for magnetic materials. The work was published prior to the work of Robert Cole in 1965 which is often cited."

  "text" : "Bernard J. Cywinski FAIA (March 29, 1940 – March 2, 2011) was a prominent American architect and teacher, based in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. His works include the Liberty Bell Center at Independence National Historical Park and the G. Wayne Clough Undergraduate Learning Commons at the Georgia Institute of Technology. He was a founding partner and principal of the architectural firm, Bohlin Cywinski Jackson, one of Philadelphia's highest-profile firms. Cywinski was raised in Trenton, New Jersey. He graduated from Columbia College at Columbia University and the Columbia Graduate School of Architecture, Planning and Preservation. In 1979, he merged his architectural firm with that of Peter Bohlin, who was based in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania. The merged company would be called Bohlin Cywinski Jackson. According to the Philadelphia Inquirer, Cywinski and Bohlin had a mutual interest in sketching, though Cywinski used a mechanical pencil while Bohlin used a traditional pencil. Within the firm, Cywinski concentrated largely on projects and affairs at the firm's Philadelphia headquarters, while Bohlin designed projects farther from the city. In 1994, the American Institute of Architects awarded both Cywinski and Bohlin the Firm Award for their work. The firm grew to include five offices located in Wilkes-Barre, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Seattle, and San Francisco. Cywinski was a coauthor of the master plan for the redesign of Independence Mall in the 1990s, and was the chief architect and designer of the Liberty Bell Center, which opened in 2003. He suffered from cancer for more than ten years. His last sketches were of a series new, proposed light poles, which he hoped would help to brand parts of the Avenue of the Arts on Broad Street in Philadelphia. The sculptural lighting prototypes were first tested on March 2, 2011. Cywinski died the same day, March 2, at the age of 70. He was survived by his wife, Nancy Oklesson Cywinski."

His parents left for the United States in 1906 and he followed two years later. The Actors' Union refused him work so he went to London for two seasons. In 1910 he returned to Łódź and played there successfully for three years. He then emigrated to America, where he played from 1913-1917 in Philadelphia, and then a year in New York's Yidishe kunst teater (Jewish art theater) and then in Boris Thomashevsky's National Theater and then Kessler's Second Avenue Theater and the Public Theater. He played lesser roles as he became ill and partially paralyzed. He died in New York. He acted in one film, Gelebt un gelakht (Live and Laugh)."

In 1970 he published a book, Adventures among the toroids. A study of orientable polyhedra with regular faces, in which he discussed what are now called Stewart toroids. The book was handwritten in calligraphy with many formulas and illustrations. For perspective on his contribution to geometry, we have Plato (ca. 400 BC), whose name is attached to the 5 Platonic solids. Then we have Archimedes (ca. 250 BC), whose name is attached to the 13 Archimedean solids. Then we have Norman Johnson, who enumerated the 92 Johnson solids in 1966. And then we have sextillions of the Stewart toroids, described in 1970. All of these polyhedra have regular polygons as faces. The first three categories are all convex, whereas Stewart toroids have polygonal-faced tunnels."

He was born in the midnight of Shivaratri (the holy night dedicated to Shiva) in the village named Atla of Birbhum district to a Shyama-sangeet singer Sarbananda Chattopadhyay. He was named Bamacharan (one who is dedicated to the lotus feet of Bama = the devi with the left foot forward on the chest of Shiva, i.e., Goddess Tara). Amongst very few, he holds the title Sadhak-pravar Bamdev. He is a true yogi, and was known to have tremendous supernatural powers. While it is true, that people called him Bamakhepa and `khepa' means mad, devout Shakti-sadhaks doesn't think of him as a mad saint; as is usually the folklore. He is the man `mad of Bama or divinely intoxicated', thus he gets that name. Locals called him Khepa-baba, Bama as well. `Khepa' is a term used in Tantrik traditions to praise a worshipper to the superlative degree, thus he was called that way. He is also referred as Shri Bam, Bamdev in the community of shaktas, and is the Bhairav of Tarapith."

An engineer educated at the University of Pittsburgh, he later received a Master Degree in Engineering at USC and an MBA from California State University, Long Beach. Vardoulis promoted the visionary plan for toll roads in 1980, which have now been nearly completed. He recently proposed a concept for an 11-mile transportation tunnel under the Cleveland National Forest that would connect the 133 Toll Road in Orange County to the I-15 Freeway in Riverside County. The roadways would actually include three tunnels which could also carry rail traffic, a water transmission line, high-voltage transmission cables and other uses. Transportation agencies in Orange and Riverside Counties have done preliminary review of the concept and have put it on hold due to the potentially high cost at this point. He served as President of Church Engineering, a Civil Engineering firm, prior to its sale in late 1992. He then founded BV Engineering where he served as CEO until its sale in 2004. Vardoulis has received numerous awards, most notable the Irvine Citizen of the Year presented by the Chamber of Commerce, and the Visionary Award presented by the Transportation Corridor Agency for his planning for the Orange County Toll Roads. Today, he lives in Newport Beach with his wife Debra. Vardoulis remains active as a business consultant."

From 1959 however he was used as a half back and was at his best during the early 1960s. A former Mentone player, Crowe missed the second half of the 1959 season after suffering an pre-match injury. He had slipped in the player's race, while running onto the field for Carlton's game against Fitzroy at Brunswick Street. Despite an injury to his knee, Crowe played in the first quarter but the umpires allowed him to be substituted. He returned later in the year to play in Carlton's preliminary final loss to Essendon. Crowe was a member of the Carlton team which were defeated in the 1962 VFL Grand Final. He played for Dandenong in the Victorian Football Association, after leaving Carlton."

He became a well known radio personality in Adelaide and Sydney. Ion started in radio early, commentating football matches for Melbourne radio in 1960, while also playing with the Carlton Rovers. He joined his elder brother, Graham Ion, at Footscray in 1961 and played with him in the 1961 VFL Grand Final, as a half back flanker. The grand final was just his sixth league game, having played just four home and away matches before the finals series. He made 29 appearances over the next two seasons, but then struggled with injuries, playing just five more games. In 1966 he joined Yarraville in the Victorian Football Association; he wasn't able to play Saturday games as he was calling football for radio station 3KZ, but he still polled sufficient votes to finish third in the J. J. Liston Trophy for the year. He moved to Adelaide in 1967 and spent two seasons playing for Woodville. While in Adelaide, Ion began working for 5AD and formed a radio breakfast duo with Tony Pilkington called \"Bazz and Pilko\". Ion voiced a character called \"Peter Plus\". He joined 5KA during the 1980s, where he continued to work with Pilkington. In 1985 the duo brought their breakfast show to Sydney station 2UW where they lasted until late 1991."

Park joined Granada Television after graduating from Edinburgh University. He rose through the television ranks and, after leaving for a two-year spell with Tyne Tees Television, he returned to Granada in 1992 as head of entertainment where he produced the award-winning Prime Suspect, September Song and the pilot for My Wonderful Life. In 1997, Park was appointed executive producer of the long-running soap opera Coronation Street following a decline in its ratings. Park became known as the \"axeman\" in the popular press after he sanctioned the removal of several long-running characters from Coronation Street, including Derek Wilton, Andy McDonald, Bill Webster, Maureen Holdsworth, and Don Brennan. He introduced more sensational storylines such as Deirdre Rachid's wrongful imprisonment, as well as a range of new characters such as transsexual Hayley Cropper and the Battersby family, in a bid to capture a younger audience and reinvent the show. Many of his storylines were ratings successes. Park left Coronation Street in 1998 to start Shed Productions with Coronation Street script executive Ann McManus, which produced TV shows such as Family Affairs, Bad Girls, Waterloo Road and Footballers Wives. In 2009, Park had a brain aneurysm while holidaying in Italy and underwent brain surgery."

  "text" : "William Barry Holmes (1928–1949) was a rugby union player who played for the England national rugby union team and the Argentina national rugby union team. As of 2011 he is the only player to have been capped at senior level by both those two countries. Holmes was born in Buenos Aires on 6 January 1928 to British parents. He was educated at St. George's College, Quilmes, and began his rugby union career playing for the Old Georgian Club in Buenos Aires. He travelled to Britain to continue his education at Queens' College, Cambridge and was selected to play for Cambridge University R.U.F.C. in The Varsity Match twice, playing on the wing in 1947 and at fullback in 1948. Holmes returned to Argentina in 1948 as part of the 1948 Oxford-Cambridge rugby union tour of Argentina, a touring team made up of players from both Cambridge University RUFC and Oxford University RFC which won all nine of its tour matches, including two against the Argentina national team. Holmes's form for Cambridge University in the 1948–49 season led to two appearances in the trial matches for the England team and also an invitation to play for the Barbarians in their annual fixture against Leicester. His performance in the second trial match clinched his selection at fullback in England's team for their opening match of the 1949 Five Nations Championship against Wales at Cardiff Arms Park and he retained his place for the whole championship. Holmes won four caps for England and scored a conversion in each match against Ireland and France for a total of four points. After playing on the Barbarians' 1949 tour of South Wales, Holmes returned to live in Argentina and was selected for the national team after only two games for Old Georgians. He was capped twice for Argentina against France in August and September 1949 but did not score any points. He was married in November 1949 and moved to Salta but died of typhoid fever on 10 November 1949, less than a week after his wedding. England rugby historian Barry Bowker described Holmes as a \"steady fullback\" while Clem Thomas, a team-mate at Cambridge and a Wales international himself, called him \"a marvellous man and a great footballer\" and said that the news of his death \"depressed us enormously\"."

  "text" : "Bertha Schwarz, often known by her stage name Bianca Bianchi, was a coloratura soprano opera singer of the late 19th century. Her greatest successes were at Vienna. Bertha Schwarz was born in Heidelberg, Germany, on 27 January 1855, the daughter of actors who worked at nearby Mannheim. As an opera singer, she was for many years a prominent member of the company of the Vienna Court Opera, where her fame was such that an asteroid discovered on 4 September 1880 was named 218 Bianca in her honour. Two years later Johann Strauss II was inspired by her to compose his Frühlingsstimmen waltz for orchestra and solo soprano voice, still familiar today. Although based in Vienna, Bianca Bianchi sometimes performed in other cities of the German and Austrian empires, notably Hamburg, Karlsruhe and Budapest. In 1894 she married the impresario Bernard Pollini, who had been her manager. She died in Salzburg on 16 February 1947."

In March 2011, Anderson moved back to New Zealand to join the Manawatu Jets for the 2011 New Zealand NBL season after he met Tony Smith, a former National Basketball League veteran from the 1980s, who put him on to the idea of playing in the competition. Anderson did not receive many opportunities during the season, as he managed his lone appearance for the team in a three-minute stint on May 21 against the OceanaGold Nuggets."

Born in Holmfirth, Turner later claimed that his family had connections to the Chartist and Luddite movements. He became a textile worker, and first joined a trade union in 1883, when he has involved in a strike of weavers in Huddersfield. He worked as a full-time union organiser from 1889. Turner was Secretary of the Heavy Woollen district branch of the West Riding of Yorkshire Power Loom Weavers' Association from 1892, then General President of the National Union of Textile Workers from 1902 to 1933. A supporter of independent workers' representation, Turner was elected to a local school board in 1892, and was a founder member of the Independent Labour Party in 1893. Also that year, he was elected to Batley Town Council, serving for many years, including a stint as Mayor of Batley from 1913 to 1916. Turner supported the creation of the Labour Party, serving on its National Executive Committee for eighteen years, and as its chairman, in 1911. He stood for Parliament on numerous occasions, and was finally elected for Batley and Morley at the 1922 UK general election, losing his seat in 1924, but winning it back in 1929 before losing it a final time in the 1931 UK general election. He served in the Government as Secretary for Mines for a year from 1929. Turner was also heavily involved in the Trades Union Congress (TUC), acting as its delegate to the American Federation of Labour in 1910, and served as President of the TUC in 1928, the time of the talks with Sir Alfred Mond. On the occasion of his Golden Wedding in 1934 Turner wrote a volume of poetry entitled \"Rhymes, Verses and Poems from a Yorkshire Loom\" (Pontefract, W.McGowan, 1934)"

  "text" : "According to Edmund Bacon, chief overseer at Monticello for nearly two decades from 1806 to 1822, \"Mr. Jefferson had a large number of favorite servants, that were treated just as well as could be. Burwell was the main, principal servant on the place.\" Jefferson was also said to have had \"the most perfect confidence\" in his servant Colbert. As such, he was one of two artisans at Monticello who brought particular distinction to themselves in both the operation of the estate and the life of the master of Monticello, Thomas Jefferson. He and his cousin John Hemings were exceptional in that they were given a regular annual allowance of $20 per year, and permitted to go down to the Charlottesville stores and pick out the clothing they wanted. No one else was given this privilege. This is notable because slaves were typically given a predetermined allotment of rudimentary clothing and foodstuffs by their owner, and had no freedom of choice in the matter. Colbert was ultimately given his freedom in Jefferson’s will, and bequeathed the sum of $300.00 for the purchase of tools necessary to continue working in his trade. He had married his first cousin Critta Hemings with whom he became father to eight children. In 1819, Critta died at only thirty-six years of age. Several years later in 1834, Burwell married Elizabeth Battles, a free woman of color with whom he had three daughters. In freedom, Colbert worked as a glazier and painter at the University of Virginia, of which his former master Jefferson had been the founder in 1819."

  "text" : "Sir Bartholomew Dillon (died 1533) was a leading Irish judge of the sixteenth century who held the offices of Chief Baron of the Irish Exchequer and Chief Justice of the King's Bench in Ireland. He was born at Riverstown, County Meath, eldest son of Sir James Dillon, Baron of the Exchequer, and his wife Elizabeth Bathe, daughter of Bartholomew Bathe of Dollardstown Castle, Athy, County Kildare. He married twice: his first wife was Elizabeth Barnewall, daughter of Thomas Barnewall of Irishtown, and his second wife was Elinor Plunkett, daughter of Edmond Plunkett, 4th Baron Killeen.He had one son, Thomas, and a daughter, Ismay, who married James Fleming a grandson of the 7th Baron Slane, and was the mother of Thomas Fleming, 10th Baron Slane. His younger brother founded the branch of the family which held the title Earl of Roscommon. By birth and marriage the Dillon brothers belonged to the small Anglo-Irish  ruling class of the Pale. He was an official in the Court of Exchequer (Ireland) by 1505 and became a Baron of the Exchequer in 1507. He was appointed Chief Baron in 1514 but removed after a year, for reasons which are unclear. He was Deputy Treasurer of Ireland from 1516 to 1522, when he became a judge of the Court of King's Bench (Ireland). In 1533 he was made Lord Chief Justice of the King's Bench for Ireland but died suddenly soon after. According to Elrington Ball, at a time when the Irish ruling class were deeply split between supporters (the so-called Geraldines) and opponents of the 9th Earl of Kildare, Dillon was one of the most prominent Geraldines, who spent much of his time in England defending the Earl of Kildare's interests."

  "text" : "Ben Wood (born 1980, in Shoreham-By-Sea, United Kingdom) is a British visual artist living and working in San Francisco. Over the past decade he has carried out public projects in San Francisco and exhibited in Mexico City, Honolulu and the United Kingdom. Many of his projects use digital media to display images in the built environment. An early public project was to reveal a hidden 18th-century mural in San Francisco's Mission Dolores. In 2004 he worked with archeologist Eric Blind to capture the first photographs of the mural, keeping the 1796 reredos intact. He then projected digital images in a public display onto the interior dome of the Mission Dolores Basilica. On April 14, 2011 a recreated version of the mural was unveiled on San Francisco's Bartlett Street as part of the Mission Community Market. Since 2004 Wood has conducted a series of video projections at Coit Tower, mostly illuminating native San Francisco and California heritage. These were presented in 2004, 2006, 2008 and 2009. While a student at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Wood carried out a project to re-create the famous mural Man at the Crossroads painted by Diego Rivera in 1933 for the Rockefeller Center and destroyed in early, after controversy about its supposedly anti-capitalist imagery. Also while a student at MIT he created a documentary about MIT's oldest graduate dormitory, Ashdown House."

  "text" : "Boris Sveshnikov (1927–1998) is a Russian, Soviet non-conformist painter. At the age of 19 in the year 1946, he was studying at the Moscow Institute of Applied and Decorative Arts. However, he was falsely accused of engaging in terrorist activity and was interned in a Gulag labor camp by the Soviet government. He spent eight years imprisoned, first at a camp called Vetlosian where he felled trees and dug trenches with other laborers. Later a friend of his got him a safer and less strenuous position as a night watchman in a carpentry workshop, and he produced a number of drawings on pen and paper at this time. In 1954 he was released and continued to work in his style of fantastic realism that he developed in the Siberian labor camp. Despite the injustices done to him by the government, his work is apolitical. Sveshnikov once said “what I painted at home I did for myself… All of my works are dedicated to the grave.”"

  "text" : "Bardhyl Ajeti (May 29, 1977 in Prilepnica, SFR Yugoslavia – 28 June 2005 in Milan, Italy) was a reporter for the Albanian-language daily newspaper Bota Sot, published in Pristina. He wrote daily editorials for Bota Sot and supported anticrime campaign of international authorities in arresting former members of the Kosova Liberation Army (KLA). Bota Sot also supported Ibrahim Rugova, a leader of ethnic Albanian party, the Democratic League of Kosovo. Several weeks before he was shot, Ajeti had written a complaint to the Temporary Media Commissioner, which is internationally supervised media regulator in Kosovo. In his complaint he stated that his life had been threatened. He was shot by unidentified assassins on 3 June 2005, while he was driving a car on the way to Pristina. On 28 June 2005 he died of gunshot wounds in hospital in Milano, Italy. Police spokesman said that Bardhyl Ajeti was shot in the head at close range. In the Country Reports on Human Rights Practices of the United States Department of State is emphasised that investigation of the killing of Bardhyl Ajeti had no developments. Bardhyl Ajeti was not the only journalist of Bota Sot who was killed in Kosovo. Bekim Kastrati, killed on 19 October 2001 in the village Lauša near Pristina, was also journalist of Bota Sot. The drive-by shooting of Bardhyl Ajeti was one of the apparently politically motivated killings of Kosovo Albanians during 2005. The Association of Journalists of Serbia (UNS) and Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe condemned the attack on Ajeti, emphasizing that his case and several other attacks on journalists on Kosovo have not been solved."

A wealthy man, Tukur was a late entrant in the competition for the 2011 PDP nomination for Adamawa Central Senatorial candidate, which he was said to have won due to Nyako's influence.He won the nomination with 1,095 votes. David Garvnwa came second with 378 votes and former Senator Abubakar Girei got 185 votes. In the 9 April 2011 election for the Adamawa Central Senatorial seat, Tukur won with 95,806 votes. Alhaji Dahiru Bobbo of the Labour Party received 78,424 votes, Fatima Balla Abubakar of the Action Congress of Nigeria (ACN) received 63,271 votes and Engineer Hayatu Z. Abubakar of the Congress for Progressive Change (CPC) gained 44,476 votes.The result was a surprise to pundits who had expect the more charismatic Dahiru Bobbo to be the winner."

Boetius was well educated and fluent in Latin and English. He inherited and lived at the family seat, the castle at Knockfin, near the famous law school in the parish of Killilagh in County Clare. In 1585 he was the representative of the newly formed County Clare in the Parliament of Ireland and in 1588 appointed High Sheriff of Clare. In that year (1588) the Spanish Armada was trying to make its way home through severe storms off the west coast of Ireland and many ships were wrecked or abandoned. Clancy had been advised by William Fitzwilliam, the Lord Deputy that \"… we authorise you to make inquiry by all good means, both by oath and otherwise, to take all the hulls of ships, stores, treasures, etc. into your hands and to apprehend and execute all Spaniards found there of what quality so ever. Torture may be used in prosecuting this inquiry\". In September two large galleons, the San Marcos and the San Esteban, were wrecked on the Clare coast. A reported 170 (or 70) Spanish crew survived but were promptly rounded up and imprisoned on Clancy's orders. They were subsequently tortured and hung on a nearby hill not far from Doonagore Castle now known as Cnoc na Crocaire, or Hangman's Hill and the bodies buried in a mass grave nearby. Clancy also either managed to salvage from the wreck an elaborately carved table or had it manufactured from some of the wreck's timbers. It is now known as the Armada table and kept on show at Bunratty Castle. He died April, 1598, leaving a son, Murtough Clancy."

  "text" : "Bernard Stollman (July 19, 1929 – April 19, 2015) was an American lawyer and the founder of the ESP-Disk record label. He was born in New Brunswick, New Jersey, and grew up in Plattsburgh, upstate New York, where his parents owned a chain of women's wear stores. When he was 16, his family moved to Forest Hills, Queens, and he later attended Columbia University and Columbia Law School. In 1960, he started work as an unpaid intern for a law firm working on the estates of Charlie Parker and Billie Holiday. Over the next few years he developed a love of jazz music, did some legal work for Moe Asch at Folkways Records, and began advising jazz and rhythm and blues musicians on copyrights and contracts. He also learned Esperanto, and made a recording of poetry and songs, Ni Kantu en Esperanto, to promote the language, releasing it on his own label which he called ESP-Disk. After receiving funding from his parents, he decided to establish the record label as a serious venture, to promote non-commercial and experimental music which would not otherwise be heard. In 1963, he approached free jazz pioneer Albert Ayler in a Harlem club, and offered to record an album with him. The album, Spiritual Unity, became ESP's second release. Thereafter, he recorded such jazz musicians as Sun Ra, Pharoah Sanders, Ornette Coleman, Paul Bley and Gato Barbieri. He also recorded writers including William Burroughs and Timothy Leary, and underground folk and rock acts including The Fugs, Pearls Before Swine and The Holy Modal Rounders. Stollman has faced allegations of not paying royalties to artists, signed to ESP-Disk. Tom Rapp of the band Pearls Before Swine claimed that \"We never got any money from ESP. Never, not even like a hundred dollars or something. My real sense is that he [Stollman] was abducted by aliens, and when he was probed it erased his memory of where all the money was\".  Peter Stampfel of the band Holy Modal Rounders and The Fugs claimed that Stollman told him that \"the contract says that all rights belong to me. You have no royalties ever, ever, ever. The publishing is mine. You don’t own the songs anymore. We don’t owe you anything\". Members of The Fugs have also stated claims that they received an unfavourable record contract. Ed Sanders said that \"our royalty rate was less than 3%, one of the lower percentages in the history of western civilization\". 801 Magazine, which featured an interview with Stollman in 2008, said that Stollman claimed that \"he paid all the recording costs and gave the musicians small advances\", and that \"he never made any money from the music\". On the positive side, Stollman had artists sign a two-page contract for only one record, so that they could consider offers from larger labels if the album proved successful; and he gave them joint ownership with ESP, allowing for an equal partnership in contrast to the standard arrangement where a label has sole ownership of an album. It set, he claimed, “a new standard for the treatment of artists.” ESP album sleeves contained the message \"The artists alone decide what you hear on their ESP Disk\". Although many of his label's releases were critically acclaimed, most did not sell well, and by the early 1970s his funds had been exhausted. Stollman married, moved to live on a farm in the Catskill Mountains, worked as a lawyer, and closed ESP-Disk in 1974. In the 1980s he worked as an assistant New York Attorney General, retiring in 1991. In 2005, he re-activated the ESP label, to reissue old recordings as well as making new recordings. He died of complications from prostate cancer in 2015."

  "text" : "Benjamin Moran (b. Franklin County, Pennsylvania, 1820; d. Braintree, Essex, on 20 June 1886) worked at the United States Legation (later the US Embassy) in London from 1853 to 1874. Moran first visited England in 1851. In 1853, around the time that James Buchanan, who was from the same county in Pennsylvania as Moran, became US ambassador in London, Moran returned to England, becoming a temporary clerk at the legation. In 1854, he gained a permanent post and, in 1857, he was appointed Assistant Secretary, a post he kept until 1864, when he was promoted to Secretary, serving until 1874. From 1857, he kept a private diary which was subsequently published; the diary is of interest mainly because it documents how the US Civil War was seen in the UK. Buchanan was elected President and George M. Dallas became Ambassador in London, where Moran stayed. From the end of 1858, Moran was co-owner of the London-based Spectator magazine, which he used to promote Buchanan's views against a generally hostile, anti-slavery British press. His co-owner was John McHenry, an American businessman who was also based in London, and they arranged the purchase through a nominee, Thornton Leigh Hunt, to disguise their connection. They dramatically altered the tone of the magazine, its circulation declined substantially and there were several occasion when Moran had to pump additional funds into the venture. Having paid £4200 for it, they sold for £2000 in January 1861, by which time Abraham Lincoln had taken over from the vacillating Buchanan. In 1875, he was made Minister Resident to Portugal and, since this was the first instance of this kind of promotion in US diplomatic history, some regard him as the first American career diplomat. When the office of Minister Resident was discontinued in 1876, Moran was made Chargé d'Affaires at Lisbon, serving until 1882 when ill health forced him to resign and return to England. He never went back to the US, settling, instead, at Braintree in Essex, where he died at nearby Bocking Hall."

  "text" : "Burton \"Burt\" Reinhardt (April 19, 1920 – May 10, 2011) was an American journalist and news executive, who served as executive Vice President of CNN from 1980 to 1982 and the second President of CNN from 1982 to 1990. In his capacity as vice president, Reinhardt helped to hire most of CNN's first 200 employees, including the cable network's first news anchor, Bernard Shaw. Reinhardt was born in New York City on April 19, 1920. He began working as an assistant cameraman for the Movietone News newsreel company in 1939. He served as a combat cameraman with the United States Army's pictoral service in the Pacific theater during World War II. Reinhardt became Fox Movietone News' managing editor following the end of World War II. He then became the executive vice president of United Press International's (UPI) television film division, the UPI Newsfilm. Reinhardt then co-founded UPI's television news agency, United Press International Television News (UPITN), during the late 1960s. He next served as Paramount Pictures' executive vice president of the \"non-theatrical and educational film division.\" He departed Paramount Pictures to help launch CNN at the invitation of Ted Turner, the founder of the cable news network. Turner, who actively recruited Reinhardt to CNN, later wrote that Reinhardt was \"a seasoned professional who knew how to get things done,\" in his autobiography, Call Me Ted. CNN was launched in 1980, with Reinhardt serving as the network's executive vice president from 1980 to 1982. AS executive VP. Reinhardt recruited and hired most of CNN's first 200 employees, including Bernard Shaw, who became CNN's first news anchor. Reinhardt was also responsible for all financial decisions made by the network during the first two years CNN on on-air. In January 1982, Ted Turner appointed Reinhardt as the second President of CNN, succeeding Reese Schonfeld. He would serve as CNN's president for the next eight years. As president, Reinhardt oversaw the creation of several of CNN's most prominent shows, including Larry King Live, which aired from 1985 to 2011, and Crossfire. He arranged for CNN to charge other news organizations a price for the reuse of CNN's on-air news pieces. Reinhardt created to share news with local news affiliates in the United States, later expanding the exchange program to include international broadcasts, including China. Reinhardt also expanded much of CNN infrastructure, including the establishment of approximately twenty news bureaux around the world. According to the Washington Post, Reinhardt supported live coverage of the rescue of Jessica McClure, known as Baby Jessica, who was trapped in a well in Midland, Texas, for fifty-eight hours in 1987. Reinhardt also spearheaded live coverage of all space shuttle launches during the 1980s. The move allowed CNN to unexpectedly broadcast the Space Shuttle Challenger disaster live on television in January 1986. Reinhardt placed the CNN logo in the lower right-hand corner of the television screen in 1988. The addition of the logo initially angered some CNN affiliates, who viewed the logo as distracting, although some claim that the move helped to make CNN an easily identifiable brand, which has been copied by other television networks. Reinhardt stepped down as president of CNN in 1990 and was succeeded by broadcast executive, Tom Johnson. Johnson, CNN's third president, later called Reinhardt, \"instrumental in the success of CNN.\" Reinhardt remained with CNN in several capacities until his retirement in 2003. Burt Reinhardt died at his home in Marietta, Georgia, of complications from a series of strokes on May 10, 2011, at the age of 91. He was buried in Union, New Jersey. He was survived by his wife of 59 years, Diana Shaw Reinhardt, a daughter, son and grandson. Another son, Barry S. Reinhardt, died in 1960."

The experiences he has had during his service have formed most of the content of his art. For a time, John worked as a recruiting officer in Haverfordwest, but later rejoined the Welsh Regiment. In 2013, John organized the Neyland Armistice Project, a collaborative art project to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the First World War.

  "text" : "Basil Argyros (Greek: Βασίλειος Ἀργυρός, c. 970 – after 1023) was a Byzantine nobleman of the Argyros family and a brother of the emperor Romanos III. According to the Synopsis Historion by John Skylitzes, Basil Argyros was the strategos of Samos who was sent to fight the Italian rebel Meles c. 1010–11. It is possible that the account of Basil's career in Italy is the result of Skylitzes' conflation of Argyros with another contemporary Basil, surnamed Mesardonites, who was the catapan of Italy. On the other hand, he may have been a commander of the fleet sent to support Basil Mesardonites in his crackdown on the rebellion. He was recalled from Italy c. 1017. Modern scholars such as Guilou and Vannier consider Basil Argyros and Basil Mesardonites to have been the same person, a view not shared by Alexander Kazhdan. After a gap in his recorded career, Basil appears as the first Byzantine commander of Vaspurakan, an Armenian kingdom, which was surrendered by its king Senekerim-John to the emperor Basil II in 1021/22. He was removed from the office for incompetence soon after his appointment. The gap in Basil's career can tentatively be filled by the information provided on a seal discovered at Preslav, Bulgaria, on which Basil is named a patrikios and strategos of Thrace. Basil and his family members played a role in the Byzantine interaction with the empire's eastern neighbors. The marriage of Basil's daughter Helena to the Georgian king Bagrat IV was part of a peace deal negotiated by Bagrat's mother Queen Maria, daughter of the former king John-Senekerim of Vaspurakan, in 1032. Skylitzes also speaks of the sons of Basil as archons who lived in the Anatolic Theme in the mid-11th century. Basil's other daughter, whose name has not survived, was married to the general Constantine Diogenes and became the mother of the future emperor Romanos IV Diogenes."

  "text" : "Benjamin \"Ben\" Bocquelet (born 27 June 1983) is a French-British animator, director, writer, and producer. He is best known as the creator of The Amazing World of Gumball of which he also co-writes alongside James Lamont and Jon Foster. He was also the director of a short film called The Hell's Kitchen in 2003. When Cartoon Network Development Studio Europe was created in 2007, Ben Bocquelet was hired in order to help people pitch their projects to the network after dismissal of Nickelodeon and Jetix subdivisions of Europe. However, when the studio decided to have its employees all pitch their own ideas, he decided to take some of the rejected characters he had created for commercials and put them all in one series, with a school setting. Daniel Lennard, the Vice President of Original Series and Development at Turner Broadcasting UK, liked the idea and the series was ultimately greenlit."

He was one of the few survivors of the Birkenhead which went down at two o'clock in the morning on 28 February 1852. He was aboard the cutter which rescued women and children as she sank. Twelve hours later, they themselves were rescued by the schooner, Lioness, of Cape Town. Kilkeary spent thirty-two years as a soldier, all but two in non-commissioned ranks. He was a colour Sergeant with the 73rd, which he served with for twelve years and two hundred and one days. The remaining twenty years he spent in the Auxiliarys, his last corps being the Mid Ulster Artillery, of which he was the Paymaster Sergeant. His active service included the 1852–53 Kaffir War, the battle of Berea and the Indian Mutiny. As of 1902, he was residing at Dungannon, County Tyrone."

  "text" : "Balaram Stack is a native Point Lookout, New York professional surfer. He was born on September 5, 1991. The youngest of three surfing brothers, Stack was born in Sebastian, Florida, where he began riding waves on a boogie board at three. His family relocated to Long Island when he was five, settling a half-block from the beach in Point Lookout. By 11 he developed a reputation as a ripper in local lineups and was sponsored by unsOund, a Long Beach surf shop. When he was 12, Stack won a local contest that convinced him to quit hockey and devote more time to riding waves.The following year, Quiksilver, the surf industry’s top brand, discovered Stack at a surfing camp in Montauk and added him to its team. In 2009, Stack opted for an independent study course load so that he could travel the world and surf. He spent a month on the North Shore of Oahu, surfing the Banzai Pipeline. He tagged along to Tahiti with Clay Marzo, considered the sport’s most creative aerialist. In February, Quiksilver sent him to Australia to train with the surf coach Mick Cain, who used video analysis and mental techniques to improve Stack’s contest readiness. Stack returned from Australia transformed. In April, at the national scholastic East Coast regional championships in Florida, Stack qualified for the finals in four divisions, winning the Air Show and Explorer Juniors divisions. With a repertory of aerials and an ability to ride in the barrel of waves, Stack earned three perfect 10 scores during the tournament, an unprecedented performance for a surfer from the Northeast. Stack won the wildcard and competed in the ASP 2011 Quiksilver Pro New York in September against the world's best. His short documentary \"Stacked\" premiered in Long Beach, NY on August 30, 2012."

He worked for Rothmans tobacco company, then Rio Tinto Group|(Cam and Motor mine). He was the first Zimbabwean to break 30 minutes in the 10,000 metre race. Running in the 1960s and 1970s, Dzoma was selected to compete for Zimbabwe, then called Rhodesia in that country's 1968 and 1972 Olympic teams. This team was refused entry permits to Mexico, and Rhodesia was, de facto, banned from this point and did not compete in the Olympic Games again until 1980.Rhodesia was banned from the Olympic Games because the country did not allow Africans to vote in national elections, and denied themequal rights under the law.Dzoma's running at this time, along with fellow Zimbabwean athlete, Mathias Kanda, are detailed by his Australian coach's book: A Wilderness of Spite by John Cheffers. Andrew Novak has a treatise on Rhodesian participation in the Olympic which also mentions Dzoma. After the personal disappointment of not being able to run in the 1968 Olympic Games,Dzoma continued to train on his own and was selected to run in the 1972 Munich Games. He was in Munich for the Games, however, again, the Rhodesian team was not allowed to compete. Dzoma then became a coach and coached 3 Zimbabwean marathoners at the 1985 Hiroshima World Marathon Championships. Dzoma is an athlete who was significantly effected by the Sporting Boycotts which helped to bring an end to apartheid in the 1960s to 1990s. After this Dzoma married and had six children. He worked as a Joiner and later as a Rio Tinto employee. He is currently living in Zimbabwe. A comprehensive listing of Dzoma's track times and more biographical information is available at."

  "text" : "Basil J. Hiley (born 1935), is a British quantum physicist and professor emeritus of the University of London. He received the Majorana Prize \"Best person in physics\" in 2012. Long-time co-worker of David Bohm, Hiley is known for his work with Bohm on implicate orders and for his work on algebraic descriptions of quantum physics in terms of underlying symplectic and orthogonal Clifford algebras. Hiley co-authored the book The Undivided Universe with David Bohm, which is considered the main reference for Bohm's interpretation of quantum theory. The work of Bohm and Hiley has been characterized as primarily addressing the question \"whether we can have an adequate conception of the reality of a quantum system, be this causal or be it stochastic or be it of any other nature\" and meeting the scientific challenge of providing a mathematical description of quantum systems that matches the idea of an implicate order."
