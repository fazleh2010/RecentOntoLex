  "text" : "Charles Nicolas Cochin the Elder (29 April 1688 – 5 July 1754) was a French line-engraver. He was born in Paris in 1688. His father, Charles Cochin, was a painter, and Charles Nicolas followed the same profession until he was twenty-two years of age, when he abandoned painting and devoted himself entirely to engraving. In 1731 he became an Academician, and on the occasion of his reception engraved the portraits of Jacques Sarrazin and Eustache Le Sueur. He then turned his attention to the fancy subjects of Watteau, Lancret, and Chardin, after whom he executed several fine works. He also assisted his son, Charles Nicolas Cochin, with the plates of the ceremonies at the marriage of the Dauphin with the Infanta of Spain in 1745. He died in Paris in 1754, having engraved about one hundred plates, among which are many vignettes for the 'Virgil' of 1742 and other books. The undermentioned are his best works: \n* La Mariée de Village; after Watteau. \n* Decoration du Bal paré; after C. N. Cochin, Fils. 1745. \n* Decoration du Bal masque; after the same. 1745. \n* Decoration et Dessein du Jeu tenu par le Roy et la Reine, 1747; after the same. \n* Le Jeu du Pied-de-boeuf; after De Troy. \n* Le Jeu de Colin-Maillard; after Lancret. \n* Fuyez Iris; after the same. \n* L'Amant sans gêne; after the same. \n* La Blanchisseuse: La Fontaine; after Chardin. \n* L'Ecureuse : Le Garçon Cabaretier; after the same. \n* The Funeral of the Queen of Sardinia, 1735; after Perault and Slodtz. Louise-Magdeleine Horthemels, the wife of Cochin, likewise practised engraving. She was born in Paris in 1686, and married in 1713. Among the plates which she executed two of the best are 'La Charmante Catin' and 'Le Chanteur de Cantiques,' which form part of the set of the 'Charges des Rues de Paris,' designed by her son. She also completed his large plate of the 'Feu d'artifice ' at Rome, which greeted the birth of the Dauphin in 1729, and often assisted him in other works. She died in Paris in 1767. Further details respecting Cochin and his works are to be found in MM. Portalis and Béraldi's 'Graveurs da dix-huitième siècle,' i. 492-502."

She married the Dutch noble Willem Bentinck van Rhoon in 1733, and had a son (the British naval officer and mechanical inventor) John Bentinck in 1737. However, she lived in 1737–1748 in a relationship with count Albrecht Wolfgang of Schaumburg-Lippe, something which caused a great scandal in contemporary Germany, and meant that she never knew her son. In 1748, she was deposed and her throne taken by her spouse, and she lived the rest of her life separated from her legitimate family. She made many visits to the courts of Europe seeking support to retake her throne, but was treated like an outcast. In 1767, she took up residence in Hamburg, where she lived in simplicity with her natural son. She is portrayed in the film Charlotte Sophie Bentinck."

He represented Westmorland in the 1st New Brunswick Legislative Assembly. He was born in Kirklevington, the son of Charles Dixon and Mary Corps, and apprenticed with his father as a bricklayer. He pursued this trade at Yarm and then bought a paper factory at Hutton Rudby which he operated until 1771. Dixon married Susanna Coates in 1763. Originally a member of the Church of England, he converted to Methodism in 1765. In 1772, he emigrated with his family to Nova Scotia, arriving at Halifax and then moving to Fort Cumberland soon afterwards. Dixon purchased a farm at Sackville, also operating a small retail business. In 1776, he was named a justice of the peace and a judge in the Inferior Court of Common Pleas. Dixon became a customs collector at Sackville in 1784. He also served as highway commissioner, highway surveyor, assessor and overseer of the poor for Westmorland County.

He was a teacher at École Spéciale d'Architecture in Paris, France and helped build the \"École Nationale Professionnelle d'Armentières\" or the National Professional building of Armentières in 1887. Chipiez with the help of architect, hellenist, and architectural historian Georges Perrot wrote some of the most detailed description of the architectural achievements of the ancient world in such places as Egypt, Greece, Persia, Lydia, Lycia and Assyria. Chipiez would also create some of the most detailed virtual architectural drawings of the ancient monuments that once stood erect, bringing them to life. Some of his prominent works with Perrot include History of art in primitive Greece: Mycenian art in 1894, A history of art in Phoenicia and its dependencies in 1885, History of art in Persia in 1892, A history of art in ancient Egypt in 1883, A history of art in Chaldaea & Assyria in 1884, History of art in Phrygia, Lydia, Caria, and Lycia in 1892, and History of art in Sardinia, Judæa, Syria, and Asia Minor in 1890. Chipiez's drawing reflect his technical acumen as well as his artist abilities. His drawings recreating the facade of Persepolis are among some of the works he has contributed to his publications: \n* Reconstruction of the Apadana Hall \n* Bird eye view of Persepolis \n* Column detail of Apadana \n* Facade of Palace of Darius \n* Analysis of the \"Tachar\" Hall \n* Hall of 100 columns, or \"Talar-i-Takht\" \n* Detail from the roof structure of Persepolis"

  "text" : "Charles Melville Scammon (1825-1911) was a 19th-century whaleman, naturalist, and author. He was the first to hunt the gray whales of both Laguna Ojo de Liebre and San Ignacio Lagoon, the former once being called \"Scammon's Lagoon\" after him. In 1874 he wrote the book The Marine Mammals of the North-western Coast of North America, which was a financial failure. It is now considered a classic. Scammon was born in Pittston, Maine, on May 28, 1825. In 1850 he sailed for California. On April 1, 1852 he left San Francisco in command of the brig Mary Helen (160 tons) on a combined sealing and whaling voyage. He returned on August 26 with 350 barrels of oil obtained from elephant seals. During the winter of 1855-56 he was among the vessels hunting gray whales in Magdalena Bay, when he was commanding the ship Leonore. In December 1857, commanding the brig Boston, with the schooner-tender Marin, he first hunted the gray whales of Laguna Ojo de Liebre, catching twenty. The following winter (1858–59), commanding the bark Ocean Bird and accompanied by the schooner tenders A.M. Simpson and Kate, he returned to the lagoon, catching forty-seven cows. In the winter of 1859-60 he first exploited another lagoon to the south, San Ignacio. Within a few seasons it had been swept clean of whales. In 1860-61 he returned to Laguna Ojo de Liebre in the bark Ocean Bird, taking a paltry 245 barrels of oil – about seven whales. In the summer of 1862 he sailed to the Sea of Okhotsk in the San Francisco ship William C. Nye. He cruised around Iony Island and Shantar Bay until September, catching only three bowhead whales. In the winter of 1862-63 he hunted gray whales in Magdalena Bay, his last whaling cruise. He spent the following three decades in the Revenue Service, before retiring from disability in 1895. In October 1870, Scammon collected the 27-foot-long type specimen of the Davidson piked whale (Balaenoptera davidsoni, Scammon, 1872); it had been found dead on the shores of Admiralty Inlet by Italian fishermen, who towed it to Port Townsend Bay, where they flensed it. He is the brother of J. Young Scammon and Eliakim P. Scammon."

After about 5 – 6 years in Sweden he found an urge to write poetry, in Swedish. He says he finds it hard to write in English, the language of the former colonial power. He never learned to write in the Ibo or Hausa languages. His main themes are love, death and Africa.He published his first poetry collection in 1998, En kort svart dikt (A Short Black Poem) and has since then published five more books. Nwadike has also contributed to periodicals and anthologies. He has performed at various conventions and the rock festival Hultsfredsfestivalen.

Bradford also ran in the 4×400 metres relay and came fifth in the final alongside Quarrie, Leighton Priestley and Seymour Newman. He represented Jamaica at the 1978 Commonwealth Games and secured the 200 m bronze medal. He competed over 400 metres individually and in the relay at the 1979 Central American and Caribbean Championships in Athletics and took gold medals in both events.

The following year he won the 100 m title at the 1981 Central American and Caribbean Championships in Athletics and formed part of the Americas 4×400 m relay team for the 1981 IAAF World Cup. His final global competition was the 1983 World Championships in Athletics, where he ran in the heats of the 200 m and anchored a Jamaican team of George Walcott, Ray Stewart and Leroy Reid to seventh place in the 4×100 metres relay final.

  "text" : "Charles Edward Sellier, Jr. (November 9, 1943 – January 31, 2011) was an American television producer, screenwriter, novelist and director, best known for creating the American book and television series, The Life and Times of Grizzly Adams. He also wrote and produced more than thirty films and 230 television shows during his career, which spanned four decades. Charles Sellier was born in Pascagoula, Mississippi, on November 9, 1943. He was the only son of Charles Edward Senior and Gladys Carson Sellier. His father worked as a shipping clerk. Sellier was born as a Cajun Catholic, later converting to Mormonism and then to evangelical Christianity. The Life and Times of Grizzly Adams, which aired on NBC during the 1978–1979 television season, depicted a character, portrayed by actor Dan Haggerty, who escapes a bounty hunter and rescues a bear cub who becomes his constant companion in the series. Sellier had first introduced the character in his 1972 novel, The Life and Times of Grizzly Adams, loosely based on the real-life 19th century mountain man, James \"Grizzly\" Adams. The series was produced by Sunn Classic Pictures, a production company based in Park City, Utah, which Sellier had founded. Sellier also wrote many of the episodes in the series. The Life and Times of Grizzly Adams ran for one season, but was concluded in the 1982 television movie, The Capture of Grizzly Adams, in which Dan Haggerty reprised his role. Additionally, Sellier wrote and produced more than 230 television shows and thirty feature films during his career. Eleven of Sellier's feature films are included in the top 100 highest-grossing independent films in history, with six of those films ranking in the top twenty-five. Sellier produced numerous films and television shows, often with Christian themes aimed at family-friendly audiences. His production credits included In Search of Noah's Ark, In Search of Historic Jesus, Mark Twain's America, The Lincoln Conspiracy, The Incredible Discovery of Noah's Ark and Breaking the Da Vinci Code. In 1980, Sellier was nominated for an Emmy Award for his work on the made-for-television movie, The Legend of Sleepy Hollow, which starred Jeff Goldblum as Ichabod Crane. Sellier was a member of the Academy of Television Arts & Sciences, the Writers Guild of America and National Religious Broadcasters Association. Sellier was the CEO of Grizzly Adams Prods. at the time of death in 2011. The company markets family-friendly and faith based documentaries, films and television shows. Selliers had recently reached an agreement with Passmorelab of San Diego to convert approximately 500 films and televisions show to 3D for Blu-ray 3D DVDs and 3D television broadcasting. Charles Edward Sellier took his own life at his home in Coeur d'Alene, Idaho, on January 31, 2011, at the age of 67. He is survived by Julie Magnuson, his wife of 25 years, and his son William Sellier."

  "text" : "Charles William Glover (February 1806, in London – 23 March 1863), was an English violinist and composer. He was the elder brother of Stephen Glover. Glover played the violin in the orchestras of Drury Lane and Covent Garden theatres, and was appointed musical director at the Queen's Theatre in 1832. He composed numerous songs, duets, pianoforte pieces, and arrangements. Some of the vocal pieces are semicomic, such as 'Cousin Harry;' while 'Tis hard to give the Hand where the Heart can never be' is a specimen of his once popular sentimental ballads. Glover is considered to have written the music for the well-known Irish song \"The Rose of Tralee\"."

  "text" : "Carlos Roloff (Karol Rolow-Miałowski or Carlos Roloff Mialofsky; August 26 or November 4 1842 – May 17, 1907) was a Cuban general and liberation activist, fighting against Spain in the Ten Years' War and the Spanish–American War. Carlos was born in Warsaw (Russian Empire) in a Polish family. Due to his father's role in the November uprising, the family moved to Königsberg, where Karol was attending trade and military schools. After his father's death in 1862, the family moved to the USA. Carlos served in the Union Army during the American Civil War in the 9th Ohio Infantry regiment and was an officer when the war was over. After the war he worked as a clerk in a sugar trade company and this led him to Cuba. From the beginning of his stay in Cuba, he was an active member of the local community. Through the \"El Progresso\" Club, the masonic lodge \"San Juan\" and professional contacts he was well known to local VIPs. Therefore, in 1868 the leaders of the independence movement offered him rank of general in the Cuban forces. After the war he was forced to leave Cuba. He moved to the USA, where he became an activist, raising funds and arms for the Cuban forces. In 1879, on a ship loaded with arms and ammunition, he sailed to Cuba to take part in the Little War, but expedition became stuck in Jamaica. Having no way to Cuba, Roloff moved to Honduras where he became the Chief of Banco Central in Amapala. During 1892-1895 he was back in the USA, cooperating with José Martí and the rising Cuban Revolutionary Party. On May 19, 1895 he landed in Cuba with one of three groups sent from USA to fight against the Spanish forces in the 1895 war. The forces led by Roloff had some successes and he was promoted. In the meantime, the Cuban-Spanish war turned into the Spanish–American War, and the Spaniards were defeated in Cuba. In 1898 Carlos Roloff left the army. In 1901 he was nominated Treasurer of Cuba Republic and stayed in the role until his death. In 1902, Cuban citizenship was granted to him by the Cuban court."

  "text" : "Charles Nelson \"Chuck\" Miller (30 August 1924 – 15 January 2000) was an American singer and pianist who had a US top ten hit in 1955 with his version of \"The House of Blue Lights\". He was born in Wellington, Kansas, and learned to play piano as a child. By the mid-1940s he was working as a singer and pianist in clubs in Los Angeles, before forming his own trio with bass player Robert Douglass. Miller was signed by Capitol Records in 1953, and began recording with arranger and saxophonist Dave Cavanaugh. His early recordings were middle-of-the-road pop and novelty numbers, influenced by Dean Martin and Bing Crosby, but his later recordings for Capitol, including \"Idaho Red\" and the self-penned \"Hopahula Boogie\", showed a more lively style. In 1955 he moved to Mercury Records, and his recording of \"The House of Blue Lights\", arranged by Douglass, and first recorded in 1946 by Ella Mae Morse and Freddie Slack, became his most successful recording, reaching # 9 on the US pop chart. However, his immediate follow-ups, \"Hawk-Eye\" (written by Boudleaux Bryant) and \"Boogie Blues\" were less successful. He then recorded more upbeat numbers in New York City with producer Hugo Peretti, including \"Bright Red Convertible\", \"Baby Doll\", and his second hit, \"The Auctioneer\", which reached # 59 on the chart in late 1956. His other recordings included \"Vim Vam Vamoose\", \"Cool It Baby!\", \"Down the Road A-Piece\", and a version of the Everly Brothers' \"Bye Bye Love\". He also recorded an album for Mercury, Songs After Hours, which contained a mixture of swing era covers and more upbeat rock and roll numbers. After being dropped by Mercury, he recorded one unsuccessful album for Imperial Records, Now Hear This! Songs Of The Fighting 40s, before gradually fading into obscurity. He and his trio had a residency in Boise, Idaho for a while, before Douglass left and Miller moved to Anchorage, Alaska, did a stint playing piano in The Sage Room at Harvey's Lake Tahoe, and later to Maui where he played at The Whale's Tale for many years. He died there in 2000 at the age of 75."

  "text" : "Sir Charles Fairfax (c. 1567 – 17 September 1604) was an English soldier. Fairfax was the fourth son of Sir Thomas Fairfax of Denton and Nun Appleton in Yorkshire, and brother of Thomas, first lord Fairfax. He was born in or about 1567, and when very young he went with his brother to serve under Sir Francis Vere in the Low Countries. Fairfax became a distinguished commander. At the battle of Nieuwport he rallied the English companies at a critical moment, and he was one of the defenders during the siege of Ostend. By desire of Francis Vere he went to the camp of the Archduke Albert as a hostage, and he fought in the breach when the Spanish forces assaulted the works in December 1601. In May 1604 he was at the siege of Sluis, commanding troops which routed the Spanish general Luis de Velasco in the battle of Oostberg line. According to Dutch military historians François de Bas and F.J.G. Ten Raa, Fairfax later became commander of the English companies still fighting at Ostend. He landed there on 7 June with five companies of reinforcements, but was killed in the last stages of fighting on 17 September, only three days before the general surrender of the stronghold."

Yorath worked for an engineering contractor in Cardiff until 1900 when he became Assistant to the Cardiff City Engineer; later in 1908 becoming Chief Assistant Engineer & Surveyor to the Acton Urban District Council; in 1912 becoming Deputy Engineer to the Acton Borough Engineer while from 1908–09 lecturing at the Westminster Technical Institute in London. In 1913 Yorath emigrated from England to Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada to take on the role of commissioner of Saskatoon and city treasurer during the war years. As commissioner he developed an urban plan called the Plan for Greater Saskatoon, that emphasized park space, civic areas, roads, tramways, and a “ring road” (eventually realized as Circle Drive). He was quoted as saying \"Our aim should be to make Saskatoon a `garland city'.... Our city should be beautiful and well planned, characterised by cleanliness and with a residential section assuring amenity from the turmoil and stress of public life.\" and \"My conception is a garden city. It should be beautiful and flowery. If we allow Saskatoon to grow on the check-board system, we will come in for the contempt of the future generation. We should plan out our city so that sewerage and waterworks will be laid that it may be best used for a large city.\" After extensive debate with the mayor of the day Alexander MacGillivray Young, he resigned to take on the role of Commissioned of Edmonton, From 1924 until 1926 he moved into a new role as President of both the Northwestern Utilities Limited (electrical and gas supplier to Edmonton) and the Canadian Western Natural Gas, Light, Heat & Power Co. (supplier to Calgary and Lethbridge). In 1926 he moved to Nanaimo, British Columbia to take on the role of President and Managing Director of the Nanaimo Electric Light, Power and Heating Co."

  "text" : "Baumann was born 3 August 1899 in Grünkraut, a town in the Ravensburg district of the State of Baden-Württemberg in Germany. He spent two years in military service during World War I, mostly with the engineering corps of the German Imperial Army. In 1922 he entered the novitiate of the Fulda Province of the Order of Friars Minor in Sigmaringen, where, upon completion, he was given the religious habit and the name by which he is now known on 16 July 1923. He remained a member of this Province throughout his life. In 1925 Baumann was sent to the United States to help with his skills as a cabinetmaker and wood carver. It was there that he made his final profession at St. Bonaventure Friary in Paterson, New Jersey on 16 July 1926. He served that community for the next ten years. He then went on to earn a bachelor's degree from St. Bonaventure University in 1941 and a Master of Science from Columbia University, where he later served on the Board of Governors of the School of Architecture. He was also active in the National Committee on Religious Buildings, the Architectural League of New York, the National Sculpture Society, the New York Building Congress and the National Council of Architectural Registration Boards. Baumann was the American representative of the International Commission for the Restoration of the Basilica of the Holy Sepulcher in Jerusalem. Baumann became the first member of a religious Order ever to be named to the American Institute of Architects. He also gained The National Council Certificate, which qualified him as an architect throughout the United States. With those honors, he headed an architectural firm based in New York City for the Order of Friars Minor, the Office of Franciscan Art and Architecture, designing many religious structures around the hemisphere. On the 9 May 1969, Baumann died from a heart condition at University Hospital in New York City. Before his death, he had been awarded honorary degrees from St. Bonaventure University, St. Francis College, Biddeford, Maine, and Rosary Hill College, Buffalo, New York. During his lifetime, he designed many structures, including churches, convents, schools, college residences, retreat houses, and seminaries."

Bodak was born June 3, 1916 in Gary, Indiana where his involvement in boxing began circa 1929 at Schonfield's Athletic Club. In 1942 he enlisted in the U.S. Army. He survived the Battle of The Bulge after being shot twice and was awarded two Purple Hearts. An amateur fighter himself, Bodak coached the National Golden Gloves team in the late 1950s and began working with young teenager named Cassius Clay who changed his name to Muhammad Ali. Bodak trained Ali for the last four years of his amateur career that culminated with the winning of a Gold Medal for the light-heavyweight competition at the 1960 Summer Olympic Games held in Rome, Italy. He was known for his trademark headbands with photos of his fighters as well as his handmade jewelry and collages that he liked to give away as gifts. Bodak moved to Chicago, Illinois in 1958 where he was a boxing coach for the Catholic Youth Organization (CYO) for many years before moving to California. Even though advancing in age, he continued to work in the ring and was active in the boxing community until he suffered a stroke in 2007 at the age of 90. He died in a motor accident on February 6, 2009 at the age of 92 in Orange County, California."

  "text" : "Countess Leon, or Elisa Heuser Leon (1799–1881), was a founder and leader of the communal Germantown Colony established in 1835 north of Minden in the U.S. state of Louisiana. A native of Frankfurt, Germany, Countess Leon was the daughter of Johann and Anna Maria Heuser. She claimed to have married Bernhard Müller, a Christian mystic also of Germany, who was known as Count Leon, or Count de Leon. The couple had three children, Johanna Schardt, Joseph Maximilian, and Anna Stahl. In 1831, the Countess and her husband came to the United States with a like-minded group of believers. The Leons first joined a Rappite colony in Monaca in Beaver County, Pennsylvania, but because of a schism, they left that group and instead headed down the Ohio River southeast to Louisiana. They soon established their proclaimed \"New Jerusalem\" at Grand Ecore north of Natchitoches. When the Count and several other relatives died of cholera, the Countess moved some eighty miles north from that location near the Red River to present-day Webster Parish near Minden in northwestern Louisiana. For nearly four decades, the colony flourished under a communal arrangement until it began to decline after the American Civil War. It dispersed in 1871, when Webster Parish was created from Claiborne Parish to the immediate east. The Countess then relocated north to Hot Springs, Arkansas, where she died in 1881. One of three Utopian Society settlements in North Louisiana, the Germantown Colony, located off Louisiana Highway 531, was the most successful and lasted the longest, having peaked at fifty to sixty pioneers but usually with fewer than forty followers. The settlement had been planned by Bernhard Müller, but he died at Grand Ecore on August 29, 1834, of yellow fever. The Countess is remembered for having maintained Old World grace and culture in rural Louisiana."

  "text" : "Consuella \"Connie\" Moore (born August 29, 1981) is an American track and field sprinter who competes in the 100 and 200 meters. Born in Chicago, Illinois, her first major outing came when she represented the United States in the 100 m at the 2000 World Junior Championships in Athletics. She began attending Penn State University in 2001 and was top three in both the 100 m and 200 m at the outdoor Big Ten Conference meet. She became the Big 10 Outdoors champion in both events in 2002 and also reached the final of the 200 m at the USA Outdoor Track and Field Championships. In the 2003 indoor season, she came second in the 200 m at the NCAA Women's Indoor Track and Field Championship and was third at the NCAA Outdoors later that season. In her final year at Penn State she won both Outdoor Big 10 sprint events, was third in the 200 m at the NCAA Indoors and reached both sprint finals at the NCAA Outdoors. She was the athlete to win NCAA All-America honours for the Penn State Nittany Lions. She graduated with a degree in psychology in mid-2004. Moore was chosen for the 4×100 m relay at the 2003 Pan American Games and helped the United States to the gold medal alongside Ara Towns, Allyson Felix and Angela Daigle. She ran at the 2004 United States Olympic Trials and reached the finals of the 100 and 200 m sprints. This gained her a place in the relay pool for the 2004 Athens Olympics, but ultimately she did not compete. Her passion for the sport waned in the three years that followed and she ceased competition altogether in 2007 after a poor showing at the national championships. She had stopped enjoying the sport and often found it stressful. Discussions with Paralympic champion April Holmes and a chance meeting with Al Joyner led to Moore restarting her career in 2009. She worked under the coaching of Joyner and made her comeback at the 2010 USA Outdoor Track and Field Championships by taking her first national title in the 200 m. Her winning time of 22.40 seconds ranked her as the fourth fastest athlete that season and the second best American after Allyson Felix. She went on to represent the Americas team at the 2010 IAAF Continental Cup and she came in fourth place in the 200 m behind Cydonie Mothersille."

Chaney won election to his first term in the House in 2007, when he defeated fellow Democrat Anita Mack-Tennant, 8,943 to 3,415. The position opened when the long-term Democratic incumbent Francis C. Thompson of Delhi was term-limited and instead ran successfully for the Louisiana State Senate. On February 7, 2011, Chaney made headlines by vaulting from the Democrats to the Republicans. His switch was notable because it gave the GOP its first majority in the Louisiana House of Representatives since Reconstruction. In the nonpartisan blanket primary held on October 22, 2011, Chaney was unopposed for his second term in the House."

He is co-owner, chairman of the board, and chief executive officer of Koch Industries, while his brother David H. Koch serves as Executive Vice President. Charles and David each own 42% of the conglomerate. The brothers inherited the business from their father, Fred C. Koch, then expanded the business. Originally involved exclusively in oil refining and chemicals, Koch Industries now includes process and pollution control equipment and technologies; polymers and fibers; minerals; fertilizers; commodity trading and services; forest and consumer products; and ranching. The businesses produce a wide variety of well-known brands, such as Stainmaster carpet, the Lycra brand of spandex fiber, Quilted Northern tissue and Dixie Cup. Koch Industries is the second-largest privately held company by revenue in the United States according to a 2010 Forbes survey In February 2014, Koch was ranked 9th richest person in the world by Hurun Report with an estimated net worth of $36 billion. Previously, in October 2012 he was ranked the 6th richest person in the world with an estimated net worth of $34 billion—according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index—and was ranked 18th on Forbes World's Billionaires list of 2011 (and 4th on the Forbes 400), with an estimated net worth of $25 billion, deriving from his 42% stake in Koch Industries. Koch has published two books detailing his business philosophy, The Science of Success and Good Profit. Koch supports a number of free market-oriented educational organizations, including the Institute for Humane Studies and the Mercatus Center at George Mason University. He also contributes to the Republican Party and candidates, libertarian groups, and various charitable and cultural institutions. He co-founded the Washington, DC-based Cato Institute.

  "text" : "Carl Richard Nyberg (May 28, 1858, – 1939) was the founder of Max Sieverts Lödlampfabrik, then one of the largest industries in Sundbyberg, Sweden. Nyberg was born in Arboga. After school he started working for a jeweller and later he moved to Stockholm and worked with various metalworks. He later got work at J. E. Eriksons mekaniska verkstad (later renamed to \"Mekanikus\"). It was while working there that he formulated the idea of the blowtorch. He later worked on the idea and created a blowtorch with strong, directed heat and also with several safety measures built in. He quit his work at Mekanikus in 1882 and set up a workshop at Luntmakargatan in Stockholm making blowtorches. However the business didn't work well because it took too long to both manufacture and sell them. For a time he made a living selling rings supposedly for curing gout. In 1884 he moved his workshop to Sundbyberg. In 1886 he met Max Sievert at a country fair and Sievert became interested in Nyberg's blowtorch and started selling it. After encouragement by the owner of Sundbyberg gård he started AB Alpha and after encouragement from L. M. Ericsson he started producing wire. After Primus started producing blowtorches he also decided to make paraffin oil/kerosene cookers. The first model, called Viktoria, wasn't very successful, but the later Svea did better. He delivered many to Russia and soon he produced 3000 per week. In 1906 the company was changed into a stock company. He was quite generous towards his workers and often gave them stock in the company. The workers became known as \"Nybergs snobbar\" (Nyberg's snobs) because they were generally better off than those who worked in other places. In 1922 the company was sold to Max Sievert who continued to own it until 1964 when it was bought by Esso. Nyberg also worked on many other inventions, for instance steam engines, aeroplanes, boat propellers and various other machines. He was most famous as an aviation pioneer and he became known as \"Flyg-Nyberg\" (Flying-Nyberg). From 1897 and onward until around 1910, outside his home in Lidingö he built and tested his Flugan (The Fly) on a circular wood track in his garden and on the ice during the wintertime. However, due the lack of small effective gasoline engines at that time, he only managed a few short jumps. He worked hard with the help of professor J.E. Cederblom at KTH in the development of wing profiles but did not succeed to get The Fly in the air. He also designed and built his own wind tunnel to be able to make test of small wing models. The Fly had a wingspan of 5 meters, and the surface area of the wings was 13 m². The engine was a steam engine of his own design, with a boiler heated by four of his blowtorches. It produced a maximum of 10 hp (7 kW) at 2000 rpm. The total weight of the plane was 80 kg."

Actually, his ‘Social Doctrine’ situates him amongst the initiators of the science later known as Sociology. He also practiced parliamentary review and was interested in educational problems. Auguste Comte described Bonnin as a “mature and energetic man, a person with a spontaneous deep kinship for positivism and in whom we can find the true spirit of the Revolution”."

  "text" : "Clarence Rufus J. Rivers (September 9, 1931 – November 21, 2004) was a priest and well-known composer of liturgical music. His work combined Roman Catholic worship with traditional African-American music. He wrote several books on music and spirituality as well. Clarence Rivers was born in Selma, Alabama, but his family moved to Cincinnati, Ohio when he was young. It was there that he began his study for the priesthood. He did graduate work at Xavier and Yale Universities, as well as the Catholic University of America and L’Institut Catholique de Paris. He received his doctorate in African-American Culture and Catholic Liturgy from the Union Institute in 1978.Fr. Rivers was the first African-American to be ordained in the Archdiocese of Cincinnati. He was passionate about the drama of public worship, as well as the music that was the \"soul\" of worship. He was equally devoted to African American culture and was known for his lavish vestments and distinctive jewelry.It was his music that made him famous, beginning with his \"An American Mass Program,\" which combined Gregorian Chant with the melodic patterns and rhythms of traditional Negro Spirituals. His most beloved hymn was \"God is Love.\" He first sang the song at the National Liturgical Conference in 1964, and received a 10-minute standing ovation. He received the 2002 Berakah Award. In addition to being a gifted composer, he had an acclaimed vocal style. But it was his personal faith and belief in the liturgy as a place where one encountered God that motivated all of his work. He died unexpectedly at age 73."

Hawley began her career in journalism on Newsweek as the magazine's Jerusalem correspondent from 1991 to 1994. She joined the BBC in 1994 working for the World Service as a newsroom journalist, before being posted to Cairo in 1999 and Jordan around 2001. While the BBC's Baghdad correspondent, she was expelled from Iraq in 2002, but returned to the country after Saddam Hussein was removed from power the following year. She was appointed the BBC Middle East correspondent at the beginning of 2006. In recent years, she has reported on stories for the BBC's Newsnight programme including an investigation into the sale of fake bomb detectors such as the ADE651 and GT200 to Iraq and other countries. That investigation led to a ban on UK exports of fake bomb detectors to Iraq and Afghanistan. On 23 April 2013, Jim McCormick, the founder of the company which made the ADE651, was convicted of three counts of fraud at the Old Bailey in London, and was subsequently sentenced to ten years imprisonment. The owner of the company which made the GT200, Gary Bolton, was also convicted on 26 July 2013 on two charges of fraud and subsequently jailed for seven years."

  "text" : "Cecil Kaiser (June 27, 1916 in New York, New York, USA – February 14, 2011 in Michigan, USA) was a Negro league baseball pitcher, outfielder, and first baseman. In the course of his career Kaiser played for the Detroit Stars, the Motor City Giants, the Homestead Grays and Pittsburgh Crawfords and on various Latin American and Canadian teams. With the Homestead Grays he played with great players such as hall of famers Josh Gibson and Cool Papa Bell. He started his career as a 5-foot-6, 165-pound outfielder. He eventually became a left-handed pitcher after his team suffered a series of injuries. He was known as a strikeout pitcher with a good fastball and an assortment of off-speed pitches. He was nicknamed the \"Minute Man\" as it took him about one minute to strike out batters and as the \"Aspirin Tablet Man\" for throwing pitches that resembled aspirin tablets. During perhaps his best season, the winter ball season of 1949-1950, he posted a league-leading 1.68 ERA in the Puerto Rican League. Kaiser died after a fall at his home in Southfield, Michigan. It is believed that he may have been the oldest living Negro League player still alive at the time of his death."

  "text" : "Count Charles-Daniel de Meuron (6 May 1738 - 4 April 1806) was the founder of a Swiss mercenary regiment, Regiment de Meuron, which was employed in the service of the Dutch East India Company in Cape Town and Ceylon. Charles-Daniel was born in Neuchâtel and enlisted as an ensign in the Swiss Marine Regiment de Hallwyl in 1756. After service in the Seven Years' War against the British, de Meuron transferred to the Swiss Guard. He rose to become a colonel and was made a count in 1763. In 1768, de Meuron was awarded the Croix du mérite militaire. A contract with the Dutch East India Company allowed him to create his own regiment. This regiment was dispatched from France to Cape Town, before moving to Ceylon. The Regiment shifted alliance to the English in 1796 transferring Ceylon into the British Empire and then serving the British East India Company. In 1799, the Regiment de Meuron fought against Tipu Sultan in the Battle of Seringapatam. The regimental flag had the symbols of a sword and a mulberry tree. The sword represented military power while the mulberry tree, from which tapa cloth was made, is thought to have indicated his interest in objects of natural history. His collections of curiosities are now housed at the museum in Neuchatel. The regiment was plagued with problems, partly from the prickly personality of the founder. Although hired by the Dutch, the Dutch saw the regiment as being favourable to the French. Charles-Daniel tried to impress upon the Dutch that he was against the French. He became very unpopular among his officers, many of whom mutinied, as well as the Governor of the Cape, Van Plettenberg. Even before the Regiment left for the Cape, they had an outbreak of smallpox at the Ile d'Oleron in the west of France. The subsequent shortfall of 380 men was made up by an intake of prisoners from jails in Paris. The original composition was made up of two-thirds Swiss and the remainder of Germans and others. The 800 strong regiment finally left France and a hurricane caused further delay during their journey to the Cape. They were reduced to half rations for eighty days and 300 men got scurvy and 103 died in en route. Twenty more died shortly after reaching cape Town. Some of the troops defected to join Boer farmers. De Meuron held the captain of the Fier, d'Albarade, responsible and claimed that he had stocked the ship with illicit cargo and trading merchandise instead of sufficient provisions for the troops. This claim required the Dutch to hold the ship at the port for investigation. There were altercations between the French sailors and the remaining members of the Meuron Regiment resulting in the shooting of several sailors and causing trouble for the Dutch as there was nobody in control. The remainder of Regiment was later moved from Cape Town to Ceylon using the other French ship, the Hermione, to serve the Dutch. In the interim, the British agent Hugh Cleghorn in collaboration with Henry Dundas approached Charles-Daniel with a proposal and the regiment shifted its loyalty to the English. On the 14th of February, 1796 the Dutch in Ceylon surrendered with minimal resistance. Charles-Daniel received a sum of ₤4000 for the transfer and Cleghorn was paid ₤5000 and made Crown Secretary to Ceylon. In 1798, the Regiment entered full service of the British Army with 2 battalions of five companies of infantry each. The Regiment took part in the battle of Seringapatnam on the side of Wellesley and helped in the successful seizure of Mysore from Tipu Sultan. Comte Charles-Daniel returned to Switzerland leaving command of the regiment to his brother Pierre-Frederick de Meuron. The Regiment remained in India until 1806, the same year in which Charles de Meuron died."

  "text" : "Charlotte Gyllenhammar, born 1963, is a fine artist based in Stockholm, Sweden. She began her career as a painter, but swiftly moved on to sculpture and installation after completing her studies at the Royal College of Art in London. In 1993, she broke through the Swedish art scene when she suspended a 120-year-old tree over Drottninggatan, the main street in the center of Stockholm. The work entitled Die for You was the first step in a progression of images and environments that invert perspective. For example, confinement and inversion are evident in her video/photographic series of suspended women entitled Belle, 1998, Disobedience, 1998, Fall, 1999, and more recently Hang 2006. The series Hang is composed of both color or c-prints and gelatin silver prints. The photographs were first premiered at Paris Photo in 2006, in the Central Exhibition, which was dedicated to the Nordic countries, where Gyllenhammar represented Sweden. Charlotte Gyllenhammar, has in her artistic production, investigated issues such as identity, the boundaries between public and private, captivity, and terrorism. Her oeuvre is characterised by a formalist sensibility and deviating perspectives. Sculptural installations include Vertigo, 2002 at Wanås sculpture park in Sweden. Vertigo was a large installation where Gyllenhammar created a full-scale subterranean and inverted replica of her studio. Gyllenhammar has since become one of Sweden’s most prominent contemporary artists. A major exhibition of her work entitled Private Idiot was held at Kulturhuset, in the heart of Stockholm, which later travelled to Dunkers Kulturhus in Helsingborg, Sweden. An accompanying book was published in conjunction with the award winning exhibition. In addition, Gyllenhammar has completed a series of important public works such as the Raoul Wallenberg Memorial, 2007 in Gothenburg, Sweden. Her installation Wait, the smallest of us is dead has been exhibited at Glasstress, a collateral event of 2011 Venice Biennale. Her work is featured in several significant collections including the Moderna Museet, Sweden; the National Museum of Women in the Arts, Washington, D.C., United States; and Kiasma, Finland. Charlotte Gyllenhammar is the daughter of Pehr G. Gyllenhammar."

  "text" : "Charles Lapworth (13 June 1878 – 26 October 1951) was a socialist activist, journalist and film promoter. He was born in Willenhall, Staffordshire on 13 June 1878, the son of a coal miner. Lapworth toured with Eugene V. Debs in 1908, promoting the Industrial Workers of the World and speaking about socialism in Britain. He returned to Britain to stand in Sheffield Brightside at the January 1910 general election for the Social Democratic Party, but took only 4.7% of the vote. He then toured Italy with his wife, investigating the socialist movement there, and wrote Tripoli and the Young Italy with Helen Zimmern. In 1912, Lapworth again returned to Britain, to take up the editorship of the Daily Herald. Although he increased circulation, he upset its publisher, George Lansbury, by strongly criticising Philip Snowden, and Lansbury himself replaced Lapworth as editor in late 1913. Lapworth worked as night editor of the Daily Mail for a short time, before returning to the United States, which he toured with his family in an early Ford. In 1918, he interviewed Charlie Chaplin, and briefly worked with him as a writer and consultant on A Dog's Life. During the 1920s, he edited the Los Angeles Graphic newspaper, and also acted as Sam Goldwyn's agent in London. In 1925, he joined the board of Gainsborough Pictures, where he wrote film scripts including The Sea Urchin and the original story of the early Hitchcock movie, The Mountain Eagle. He also worked as production manager with the short-lived Société Générale des Films, who made The Passion of Joan of Arc. In 1931, he returned to Los Angeles, as editor of Film Quarterly. Among his other projects was the co-ownership of the Rye Courier, a small newspaper based in Rye, New York. In 1942, Lapworth launched the short-lived Malibu Bugle, the first newspaper in the city. He died in Los Angeles, California on 26 October 1951. He left a wife and two children."

He supported the Royalist cause in the English Civil War. He succeeded by special remainder to the peerage of his son who predeceased him. Berkeley was the son of Sir Maurice Berkeley of Bruton, Somerset, of the Bruton branch of the Berkeley family, and his wife Elizabeth Killigrew daughter of Sir Henry Killigrew of Hanworth, Middlesex. He was educated at Eton College in 1613 and matriculated at Queen’s College, Oxford on 3 November 1615 aged 15. In 1621 Berkeley was elected Member of Parliament (MP) for Somerset. He was knighted in 1623. He was elected MP for Bodmin in 1624 and for Heytesbury in 1625, 1626 and 1628. He sat until 1629 when King Charles decided to rule without parliament for eleven years. In April 1640, Berkeley was elected MP for Bath in the Short Parliament. He helped to organize the local resistance to ship-money, but was a Royalist during the Civil War executing a Commission of Array in 1642. Following the Restoration, Berkeley was elected MP for Heytesbury and Bath in 1661 for the Cavalier Parliament. He was involved in a double returns in both seats but was returned at a by-election for Heytesbury after the election had been declared void and sat until his death. Before his death Berkeley succeeded, by special remainder to the title Viscount Fitzhardinge on the death of his second son Charles who was killed at the Battle of Lowestoft, a naval engagement with the Dutch, on 3 June 1665. Berkeley died of apoplexy at the age of 68 and was buried at Bruton. Berkeley married Penelope Godolphin daughter of Sir William Godolphin of Godolphin, Cornwall and had four sons. He was succeeded in the viscountcy by his eldest son Maurice. His third son, William, became an admiral in the Royal Navy and was also killed fighting the Dutch, in the Four Days' Battle in 1666. Berkeley's brother John was a Royalist soldier and his brother William served as royal governor of the colony of Virginia."

  "text" : "Charlene Leonora Smith is a journalist, published author of 14 books, and is an authorized biographer of Nobel Peace Prize winner, and former South African President, Nelson Mandela. She is also a communications and marketing consultant who lives and works in the United States. She began her career at the Johannesburg Star, and specialised in anti-apartheid resistance politics. She later reported on South African politics for Sunday Tribune (where she was also deputy bureau chief), Business Day (where she was also deputy news editor), Financial Mail (where she was associate editor) and Finance Week (where she was assistant editor). Smith has worked as a producer for ABC's Nightline (US) with Ted Koppel and for CBS 60 Minutes. She has helped produce television documentaries for Canadian Broadcasting Corporation for many years, including two award winning documentaries on Nelson Mandela. A documentary on AIDS for the United Nations won the Prix Italia in 2006. She had a long career as a feature writer for the Los Angeles Times. She has written for Washington Post, The Observer, Guardian, Le Monde, Brain World, Microbicide Quarterly, Boston Globe and other publications. She has lived and worked in Japan, Argentina, South Africa, and the United States where she reported on the White House. In 1999, she was raped and stabbed in her home and a week later published an account of the event and her quest to obtain antiretroviral drugs. Smith also feared that the rapist may have HIV or AIDS. Smith began campaigning for rape survivors, as she called them, rejecting the term victim, to receive post exposure prophylaxis after rape. She was the first rape survivor in the world to do this. In 2000 she was invited by the Centers for Disease Control to address scientists, as a result of which CDC began research on a protocol for PEP for survivors of sexual assault with her assistance. It was first published in 2004. In 2004, Smith published an article about the prevalence of rape in South Africa, earning criticism from President Thabo Mbeki, a former friend and ally, and touching off a confrontation in Parliament in which \"legislators accused Mr. Mbeki of dodging the issues of sexual violence and AIDS, and the president accused them of pretending that racism died with apartheid.\" Mbeki's criticisms of her first began in December 1999 when he objected to her reporting about rape and HIV in an address to parliament. Smith is considered an expert on sexual violence, post traumatic stress syndrome, and HIV. She is regularly invited to present papers and chair sessions at conferences and seminars globally, including the World AIDS Congress. She has twice been an invited guest of the Swedish government and once of the Australian government. A communications and marketing consultant with considerable expertise in digital media she has consulted to the World Economic Forum, the Summit on Sustainable Development, 2010 FIFA World Cup, Ogilvy PR, South African Airways, HealthBridge, AstroTech Training, Eskom, and others. She has lectured at numerous colleges and universities including the University of the Witwatersrand Graduate School of Journalism; the Antioch Institute at the University of Georgia, Athens; Boston College, Goddard College in Vermont, etc. She lives and works in Cambridge, Massachusetts."

Christopher Hoen was born on the Vølstad farm in Øvre Eiker in the county of Buskerud, Norway. In 1791, he acquired the Hoen farm (Nedre Hoen i Øvre Eiker). Christopher Hoen became one of the richest and most influential farmers in the area. Hoen was also a prominent Haugean and supporter of revivalist and lay minister Hans Nielsen Hauge. His farm became the center of a large circle of Haugeans in Eiker. In 1797 he held a prayer meeting for the local farmers together with Hans Nilsen Hauge. The parish priest demanded that the assembly had to be dissolved. The Conventicle Act of 1741 (Konventikkelplakaten) prohibited any religious meetings without parish priest approval. The meeting resulted in an attempt to arrest both men. The farmers created a diversion while Hoen and Hauge both escaped. Hoen enjoyed a great reputation and was well trusted. During the emergency war years 1807-1808, he was entrusted with the distribution of moss-like grain surrogate for the poor, and he managed the Eiker granary from 1810-24. He represented Buskerud at the Norwegian Constituent Assembly at Eidsvoll in 1814, together with Frederik Schmidt who was vicar of Eger and Johan Collett who was County Governor of Buskerud. His son Borger Christophersen Hoen inherited the Hoen farm and later served in the Norwegian Parliament as a representative from Buskerud."

  "text" : "Carlo Maria Maggi (Milan, 1630 – Milan, 1699) was an Italian scholar, writer and poet. Despite being an Accademia della Crusca affiliate, he gained his fame as an author of \"dialectal\" works (poems and plays) in Milanese language, for which he is considered the father of Milanese literature. Maggi's work was a major inspiration source for later Milanese scholars such as Carlo Porta and Giuseppe Parini. His prominent works belong to the commedia dell'arte theatrical genre. Some of Maggi's most famous plays in Milanese are Il manco male (1695), Il Barone di Birbanza (1696), I consigli di Meneghino (1697), Il falso filosofo (1698), and Concorso de' Meneghini (1699). This last work may be considered as a sort of manifesto of dialectal poetry, as it explicitly celebrates the virtues of the Milanese language: che apposta la pär fä / par dì la veritä (\"which seems as if it was specifically designed to tell the truth\"). This equation between the Milanese language (and people) and sincerity is clearly embodied in the commedia character of Meneghino, which is supposedly Maggi's creation, and was later developed by other authors (most notably Carlo Porta) to eventually become a prominent symbol of Milan and the Milanese for antonomasia. Another recurring theme of Milanese literature first established by Maggi's works is the celebration of the verzee (Milan's vegetable market) as the place where the spirit of the city was most genuinely expressed."

Both in this institution and at the Realschule he gave instruction in perspective to young artists, and received the title of professor, the Order of the Red Eagle, and a medal from the Pope. He painted buildings of the Middle Ages, with landscape surroundings, such as 'The Church of St. Quirinus in Neuss', 'The Cloister of St. Severinus in Cologne' (1837), 'The Cathedral of Mayence' (1841), 'Custom House in London' (1852) and 'Views of Cologne Cathedral'. He also executed some excellent aquatints, such as 'Pius IX. in his Cabinet' and 'An Assemblage at Sigmaringen in the Olden Time' (1872). He died at Cologne in 1873."

  "text" : "In Greek mythology, the name Coresus (Greek: Κόρησος) may refer to: \n* An autochthon, who, together with Ephesus (son of Cayster), was believed to have founded the sanctuary of the Ephesian Artemis. The Amazons were so closely associated with this sanctuary that, according to Pausanias' remark, Pindar erroneously credited them, and not Coresus and Ephesus, with having founded it. Cayster, father of Ephesus, was thought to have been the son of the Amazon Penthesilea. \n* A priest of Dionysus in Calydon, who was in love with Callirhoe. The girl would not answer her feelings, so Coresus, in despair, prayed to Dionysus that he may be avenged. The population of the city was then struck with a sort of madness that resembled the state of intoxication, which was lethal to many of them. They consulted the oracle at Dodona as to how to put an end to the calamity; the answer was that they had to propitiate the god by sacrificing either Callirhoe or someone who would consent to die in her stead. No one, and not even Callirhoe's foster parents, would do anything to save her life, so she was brought to the altar. Coresus was to perform the sacrificial rite, but, unable to kill his loved one, he slew himself instead. At the sight of him lying dead, Callirhoe was overcome with remorse and, soon after, cut her throat at a spring that later received her name."

  "text" : "Charles Mellin (1597–1649) was a French painter of the Baroque era. Mellin was from Nancy, Lorraine, but spent his artistic career in Italy. In Italy, he was nicknamed Carlo Lorenese (\"Charles the Lorrainer\"). Mellin worked on murals and decorated the Chapel of the Virgin at the church of San Luigi dei Francesi in Rome in 1631. Mellin had competed with Nicolas Poussin and Giovanni Lanfranco for the job of decorating this chapel. During the early part of his career, Mellin collaborated with, and was influenced by, Simon Vouet, but Vouet’s influence diminished after Vouet left Italy for Paris. Mellin is also said to have been influenced by Domenichino. After Vouet’s departure, Mellin worked for the Muti Papazzurri family as official painter. He decorated the Palazzo Muti between 1628 and 1631, painting the vaults of the Galleria, and remnants of Mellin’s work there still survive. Mellin also taught painting to the two sons of the Muti Papazzurri family. In Rome, Mellin painted a fresco, St. Francis de Paul before Sixtus V, for the church of Trinità dei Monti. Mellin also decorated the choir at the Abbey of Monte Cassino from 1636 until 1637 with a cycle of 15 paintings, which was destroyed during the Battle of Monte Cassino in World War II. From 1643 to 1647 Mellin worked in Naples. He created a Purification of the Virgin for the high altar of the church of the Santissima Annunziata Maggiore in the city, which was completed in 1645. This painting was lost in a 1757 fire, but there is an etched copy that survives. In Naples, he painted an Immaculate Conception (1646) and an Annunciation (1647) for the church of Santa Donna Regina Nuova. The revolt of Masaniello caused Mellin to leave Naples for Rome. Mellin trained painters, such as Nicolas Labbé, but did not have a workshop per se."

  "text" : "Carolyn Stewart is a popular radio presenter on U105, a station broadcasting in the Greater Belfast region of Northern Ireland. Her broadcasting career began in 1990 when she was appointed one of the original DJ's at the launch of Cool FM, sister station of Downtown Radio based in Newtownards, near Belfast. She was the original afternoon presenter with Cool FM and went on to work on many shows including the hugely successful Cool Goes Quiet, later to become Lights Out, which at that point was drawing more listeners than the breakfast show, which was then the biggest radio show of the day! Stewart stayed with Cool FM until 2005 when she was offered a frontline broadcasting role at new UTV-owned radio station U105. One of Northern Ireland's most well-known broadcasters and club DJ's, she has also worked in television on UTV, the regional channel for the Northern Ireland region of the ITV Network, co-presenting its Saturday morning youth show SUS with comedian Patrick Kielty in 1993. Her current schedule on U105 is 12-3pm on week days and 6-10pm on Saturdays. Stewart previously did her show later in the evening on week days. On her show she tackles a host of issues and helps with problems such as gardening and pet care."

He contributed numerous works to the school of Muslim Modernists such as A Critical Exposition of the Popular Jihad and Proposed Political, Legal and Social Reforms Under Moslem Rule. His interactions with Christians in British India also marked him as an Muslim apologist with a particular focus on the wars of Muhammad. His goal in the criticism of the Qur'an as well as the shariah is to justify contemporary Western ideals through the Qur'an. Dying at age 51 during treatment, Cherágh Ali is now buried in Bombay."

  "text" : "Clifford McLaglen (15 June 1892 – 9 September 1978) was a Stepney, London-born British film actor. He was the brother of several actors including Victor McLaglen, Oscar winner for best actor, The Informer (director John Ford), and nominated for best supporting actor The Quiet Man. The other brothers were Leopold McLaglen, wrestler and inventor of a form of Jujutsu which he taught to the armed forces and police in the old Empire and America; Lewis McLaglen, actor and soldier; Cyril McLaglen, actor and horseman; Arthur McLaglen, actor, unarmed combat professional and sculptor; Kenneth McLaglen, actor and mineralogist; sister Lily Marian McLaglen (Mrs. Lance Tweedy), actress Singer and pianist. Clifford McLaglen was born Clifford Henrich McLaglen from Scottish, Irish, and Dutch ancestry. He, like all his brothers except the youngest two, Cyril and Kenneth, served in the First World War. He also served in the Second World War going out to Iceland to help guard Sir Winston Churchill, for which he obtained a bulldog and polar bear badge. He also was part of a film unit at that time in the army. His father was born in Cape Town, South Africa and came to London to study as Clerk in Orders, eventually becoming Titular Bishop of Claremont in Cape Town but foregoing this to help with the work he dedicated to the helping of poverty stricken children in London and beggars. Lily often helped with this. Clifford worked in a tin mine in Cornwall before joining up in 1914. Later he worked for Sangers Circus riding horses and doing rope tricks and worked in vaudeville with his various brothers. He starred in many silent films in Britain, in Boadicea (where he rode Roman style learnt in the army and circus); France and Germany, making the reputedly first German Talkie with Conrad Veidt, Bride 68 or Das Land Ohne Frauen, set in Australia with camels and the desert but all filed in a Berlin studio with a tank of water spilling from overhead and an aeroplane propeller. Clifford also filmed in Majorca, in Die Schmugglerbraut von Sorrento (various versions changed Majorca to Sorrento), bringing over horses with him, which he said were sea sick. The film was made in Majorca but meant to be Sorrento. Cavalcanti made two prize winning films in France with Clifford McLaglen: Yvette and Rien Que Les Heures. He made a few talkies and was on the stage in America, on Broadway with Frederick Marche's wife Florence Edridge. He was going to make a film called Ropes of Sand but nothing came of it. Mclaglen died in Huddersfield, Yorkshire in 1978."

  "text" : "Cornelius Hendrik \"Case\" Vanderwolf (1935 - 2015 ) is a Canadian neuroscientist. Raised in the rural community of Glenevis, Alberta, Vanderwolf went on to earn a BSc from the University of Alberta and completed graduate work with Donald Hebb at McGill University, completing his PhD in 1962.. Following completion of hisPhD, Case spent a year at the California Institute of Technology with Roger Sperry (1962–1963) and another year with Konrad Akert, the Founder of the Brain Research Institute of the University of Zurich (1963–1964). Vanderwolf spent over 30 years at the University of Western Ontario in London, Ontario, during which time he published over 140 papers on the relation of hippocampal, neocortical, and pyriform cortical activity to behavior and the dependence of many of these brain-behavior relations on the activity of central neurons that release the transmitter substances acetylcholine and serotonin.. As early as 1964, he was among the first investigators to carefully study the correlation between observable motor activity and brain waves.Recording from the thalamus and hippocampus of the behaving rat, he found a reliable relationship between ‘voluntary movement’ and rhythmic (theta) EEG activity. This early paper (Vanderwolf and Heron, 1964) was followed up by a detailed account of a variety of motor behaviors and hippocampal theta oscillation (Vanderwolf, 1969). He showed that in the waking rat, hippocampal EEG is dominated by thetaoscillations (6 to 10 Hz; for this he coined a new term, rhythmic slow activity or RSA) during locomotion, rearing, exploratory head turning, and sniffing. In contrast, in other observable behaviors such as eating, drinking, grooming, and immobility, theta is replaced by ‘large amplitude irregular activity’ (LIA).His work also includes research on the brain mechanisms involved in olfaction. Vanderwolf's work is relevant to the problems of consciousness, memory, motor control and such human disorders as Alzheimer's disease and depression. He has published two books, An Odyssey Through the Brain, Behavior and Mind and The Evolving Brain: The Mind and the Neural Control of Behavior that provide an overview of his academic career and research findings. In 2000, he was awarded an honorary degree from the University of Lethbridge. He died on June 16,2015 in London,Ontario."

In 1942, for his final year, he moved into residence at Trinity on a Council Minor Scholarship, graduating at the end of the year with a BSc. With Australia at war, Shain joined the Second Australian Imperial Force, but was discharged in 1943 on medical grounds. He then worked on radio countermeasures at the Australian Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) Radiophysics Laboratory. Following the war, he entered the field of decametre radio astronomy. He was a pioneer in the study of absorption in H II regions as well as the effects of the ionosphere on radio signals. He died of cancer, leaving behind a wife and three children."

  "text" : "Charles Thurstan Shaw CBE FBA FSA (27 June 1914 – 8 March 2013)  was an English archaeologist, the first trained specialist to work in what was then British West Africa. He specialized in the ancient cultures of present-day Ghana and Nigeria. He helped establish academic institutions, including the Ghana National Museum and the archaeology department at the University of Ghana. He began working with the University of Ibadan in 1960, where he later founded and developed its archeology department. He led this for more than 10 years before his retirement in 1974. Shaw's excavations at Igbo-Ukwu, Nigeria revealed a 9th-century indigenous culture that created highly sophisticated work in bronze metalworking, independent of any Arab or European influence and centuries before other sites that were better known at the time of discovery. He was awarded the C.B.E. in 1972 for his contributions. In 1989 he was made a tribal chief in Nigeria. In addition, Shaw worked on expanding communications about African archaeology; in 1964, he founded the West African Archaeological Newsletter, which he edited until 1970; from 1971-1975, he edited the West African Journal of Archaeology."

  "text" : "Charles Handley-Read (1916 – 15 October 1971) was an architectural writer and collector and the first serious 20th century student of the work of William Burges, \"a pioneer in Burges studies who was the first to assess the historical brilliance of Burges as gesamtkunstwerk architect and designer.\" Handley-Read was born in 1916 to a father who was a magazine illustrator and military artist and a mother who, beside being one of the first qualified female doctors and dentists, was a militant suffragette. In the thirties, he went up to Cambridge University to St Catharine's College to read architecture and, on graduation, became art master at his old school, Bryanston School. His career was interrupted by Second World War service as a conscientious objector, during which he worked at the epileptic colony at Lingfield, developing art therapy for children. On the resumption of his career, Handley-Read's architectural passion was Modernism and in 1951 he completed his monograph on \"The Art of Wyndham Lewis.\" However, the subsequent, and very different, course of his life was set when, in 1952, he saw the Exhibition of Victorian and Edwardian Decorative Arts at the Victoria and Albert Museum. Following the exhibition, and his marriage to the devotee of Victorian sculpture Lavinia Stainton, Handley-Read \"pinned all his hopes and dreams on one central, all-consuming passion: the work of William Burges.\" In the period between the First World War and the 1960s Victorian architecture reached its nadir of appreciation; \"at best an unhappy interlude between Neo-Classicism and Modernism; at worst a period of grotesque bad taste, associated with religious cranks like Pugin and Socialist crackpots like Ruskin and William Morris.\" The desire for, and consequently the prices of, the Victorian decorative arts were therefore at an all-time low. Handley-Read and his wife, aided by a considerable inheritance, began to collect on an increasingly gargantuan scale. But whilst his collection expanded, his ability to write about the works he bought did not: \"A lifetime spent struggling to write produced just seventeen articles.\" Realising his inability to write with meaning about the object of his passion, Handley-Read wrote to a friend, Joseph Mordaunt Crook; \"Now look. You have just edited Eastlake's Gothic Revival...with complete success. You are well soaked in John Patrick Crichton-Stuart, 3rd Marquess of Bute. You know all about Smirke...why not do William Burges?...partnership is less than I am looking for. I want to hand the job over.\" On 15 October 1971, Handley-Read committed suicide, followed by Lavinia on 9 December the same year. Their collection of Victorian artefacts was broken up at sale. Many pieces were bought by major museums such as the Victoria & Albert Museum and Birmingham Museum & Art Gallery, as well as private collectors. The largest part of the collection to stay together was the 200 plus pieces purchased by the Cecil Higgins Art Gallery, Bedford, including William Burges's own bed and dressing table. Handley-Read's notes on William Burges were passed to Joseph Mordaunt Crook and became the basis of his seminal work on Burges, William Burges and the High Victorian Dream."

  "text" : "Cathcart William Methven (24 September 1849 Edinburgh – 30 August 1925 Pietermaritzburg) was Engineer-in-Chief at Greenock on the Clyde, and appointed in 1888 as Harbour Engineer in Durban. Besides being an architect and able musician, he was, unusually, a gifted landscape artist and produced many fine paintings of Natal scenery. He founded the Durban Art Gallery in 1892. Methven was assistant harbour engineer at Greenock in Scotland and engineer-in-chief of its Harbour Trust for some 18 years. Aa a prominent Victorian engineer, he became a member of the Institution of Civil Engineers (ICE). When appointed Durban's harbour engineer in 1888, his orders were to remove a sandbar obstructing shipping at the harbour entrance, forcing passengers and cargo to be moved by lighter. Methven's plans to get rid of the bar by extending the North Pier and using the scouring action of tidal currents, brought him into conflict with a prominent lawyer, Attorney General and politician, Harry Escombe, who wanted to rely on dredging alone. Consequently, Methven was dismissed on 11 July 1894. This led to a tremendous uproar ending in Escombe's resignation. Much later, in 1918, the South African government granted him £500 in recognition of his services with development of the harbour. His other recommendation that the Umhlatuzi Lagoon be developed as a second harbour for Natal, was also followed in the 1970s and is now known as Richards Bay. Not content to remain idle, Methven started his own successful business as consulting civil and marine engineer, architect and surveyor on 13 December 1895. He undertook to survey all harbours on the south-east and southern coastline, ranging from Port St Johns (1897) to Port Alfred, Kalk Bay and Mossel Bay (1901), Richards Bay and Cape Town (1902), East London (1901 and 1910), Maputo (1909/10) and Beira and Port Elizabeth (1911). Methven was also President of the Natal Institute of Architects (1905–1908) and a Fellow of the Royal Institute of British Architects (FRIBA). Methven practiced as architect and was one of the founder members of the Natal Institute of Architects. He was an enthusiastic trout fisherman and an accomplished musician. His involvement in the art world led to his being President of the Natal Society of Artists in 1908, 1912 and 1915. He drew up specifications for the building of the organs in the Durban and Pietermaritzburg Town Halls, and edited A Century of Progress, 1824–1924 published in Pietermaritzburg. Methven's first solo exhibition took place in Johannesburg in 1921. His work may be seen in the Africana Museum, Durban Art Gallery, Local History Museums, Tatham Art Gallery and the Killie Campbell Collections."

He was a very prominent, eminent social and political personality of 20th century in Nalgonda District of Andhra Pradesh, India. He was elected thrice to the state's Legislative Assembly and had also served as Member of Parliament. He was a very ideal follower of Indian National Congress Party.He was a very close and dearest associate to the then-Prime Minister's of India, Indira Gandhi, Rajiv gandhi, P.V.Narasimha Rao. He is renowned for breaking the domination of the communists in Nalgonda district through his daring and people centred approach. Though he was from an orthodox niyogi bramhin family he was not casteist in his mind. He was loved by all strata of society for his simplicity and service-mindedness. His leadership saw the growth of congress party in a communist den. His fearless and humane behaviour endeared him even to his opponents. Several attempts on his life by his political opponents in early 1960s and 70s failed due to his sheer grit and people's loyalty to him. It is said that he was given the title 'Sardar' by people of Nalgonda. He is also lovingly called \"Panthulu garu\" ( pandit ji ). He was a rationalist and a strong believer in self-determination and dignity of labour. His home in Nalgonda was an abode of simplicity, selflessness and service to people. He is a role model for the younger generation of politicians and youth in all fields of public life."

He has been described as \"the greatest of the Maroon leaders.\" The Jamaican Maroons are descended from runaway slaves who established free communities in the mountains of Jamaica during the era of slavery on the island. African slaves imported during the Spanish period may have provided the first runaways, apparently mixing with the Native American Taino or Arawak people that remained in the country. Some may have gained liberty when the English attacked Jamaica and took it in 1655, and subsequently. For about 52 years, until the 1737 peace treaty with the British rulers of the island, the Maroons stubbornly resisted conquest."

Roehenstart was later a passive Jacobite claimant to the British throne. The name of \"Roehenstart\" given to him in infancy combined the names of both of his parents, Rohan and Stuart, while failing to proclaim their identity, which at the time would have been a cause for scandal. Although he retired from military service as a lieutenant colonel, he is sometimes called \"General\" Charles Edward Stuart, and this title appears on his gravestone at Dunkeld."

  "text" : "Clayton Andrew Lamb (born 1 July 1964) is a former Australian rules footballer who played with Adelaide in the Australian Football League (AFL), West Adelaide and Glenelg Football Clubs in the South Australian National Football League (SANFL). Lamb made his senior SANFL debut for West Adelaide in 1981 shortly after his 17th birthday, and was a regular fixture in their team throughout the 1980s (though he missed selection in their 1983 SANFL Premiership win over Sturt). A player with a long left foot kick, Lamb played mostly as a midfielder or half forward and topped West Adelaide's goal-kicking with 38 in 1988. After captaining the club in the 1989 season, he made a surprise switch to Glenelg the following year. He was good enough to represent South Australia at interstate football on three occasions. Hawthorn had initially secured the services of Lamb, in the 1986 VFL Draft, but it was with Adelaide that he made his debut at that level. Lamb was one of the foundation players for Adelaide in 1991 and made played his only league game in their round five loss to the West Coast Eagles at Subiaco Oval. Lamb remained the only player to be delisted with only one game to their name until John Hinge in 2007."

  "text" : "Caroline Hebard (1944–2007) Hebard's father was a career diplomat who moved a lot as a result of his assignments by his government. Hebard was born while he was stationed in Chile. She lived in Venezuela, Turkey, attended school in Great Britain and Switzerland, and learned several languages in her youth. As an animal lover, she had a passion for treating dogs and other animals with the best of care. This led to her first dog, with whom she spent much time, with great love, care and training. Hebard joined other groups of similar caring people and eventually trained her dogs to become proficient in being able to follow the scent of humans, alive or dead, saving lives and recovering bodies. Her life is told in great detail in So That Others May Live: Carolyn Hebard and Her Search-and-Rescue Dogs, co-written by Caroline Hebard and Hank Whittemore, published by Bantam Books in 1995. She traveled to earthquakes and other disasters in Mexico, Armenia, El Salvador, and Japan among other places, as well as assisting in search and rescue operations throughout the United States. She was instrumental in organizing search and rescue techniques, and became widely recognized for her ability to train dogs and further humanitarian efforts. Caroline Hebard died in her sleep, from cancer, in 2007. She and her husband, Arthur F Hebard, have four kids. Joanne, Andrew, Alastair, and Heather. She currently has six grandchildren. Two from Joanne, two from Andrew, one from Alastair, and two from Heather."

  "text" : "Clara Young (born Khaya-Risye Shpikolitser c. 1882 in Zlotshev, Galicia) was a Yiddish theatrical actor. Born to parents who loved the stage she spent her early years in a home that housed rehearsals of traveling Yiddish theater troupes. After her father's death the family went to America, where she soon joined the Tantsman company and went to Boston, there to Zolotarevski's troup in Montreal, thence to Toronto and to Morris Finkel's theater in Philadelphia. In 1903 she played in the People's Music Hall where she made a name with songs like Di dame fun Broadvey and Libe mayne. In 1909 she went over to the Thalia Theater where her husband Boaz Young was part owner, and there played serious roles for the first time, Tsipeniu and Got, mentsh un tayvl (God, man and devil) and Kreutzer Sonata and in Dos yidishe harts singing the couplet Sigmund Mogulesko wrote for her, Ikh hob es punkt vi in der heym. She played in Di bigamistin (zayn vayb's man) which, along with Avrom Shomer's Alrightnikes, she and her husband took to London in 1911 and then to the Lodz Groys teater and Warsaw's Elyseum Theater. Her success encouraged the couple to return to Warsaw, where in 1912 she starred in Anshel Shor and Joseph Rumshinsky's Dos meydl fun der vest (Di Amerikanerin) and later Khantshe in Amerike and Alma, vu voynstu? (Alma, where do you live?) and the German operetta Puptshik. \"She was the most beloved Yiddish actress in Poland and Russia during the 1910s... Not only the Yiddish-speaking operetta audience adored her, so did Poles and Russians ... Even the Yiddish intellectuals and literati in Warsaw were smitten with Clara--no small feat for a soubrette performing American Yiddish operettas ... critics like Mukdoyni, Prilutski, Dovid Frishman, and Peretz appreciated her elegance, language, and nuanced acting, and they were also clearly attracted by her beauty. Her appeal lay in her feminine charm, mixed with a hint of eroticism... Although not all of her repertoire was set in America, she clearly capitalized on being an American and impersonating American characters on stage.\" Her husband Boaz wrote in Mayn Lebn: \"Masses of Poles came to see Di amerikanerin; Warsaw assimilators were not embarrassed to come to the Yiddish theater ... young Hasidim would sneak into the theater ... [and] Jewish literati saw in Clara Young's performances a revival of the Yiddish language. ... Rumshinsky's music to Di amerikanerin was so successful that not only Jews but also Poles sang it. It could be heard in all cabarets.\" Her popularity grew when she starred in her husband's Jeykele the bluffer In 1922 she starred in the premiere of Tomashevsky's Di grine kuzine. In 1923, at the Prospect Theater, she played the title role in Der yeshiva bokher (The schoolboy), soon after traveling in Poland and the Soviet Union for several years, then Argentina and Brazil in 1928, then back to Lodz, Warsaw, Riga and Vilna in the 1930s, then Paris, Berlin, and London, Belgium, Mexico and Cuba. Subsequently Clara returned alone to the Soviet Union, became a Soviet citizen, and spent the rest of her life there. Ida Kaminska, the Polish born actress wrote of meeting up with Young in 1941 when all were temporarily stuck in Tashkent. Clara died in Moscow in 1952."

During Skanderbeg's Italian expedition at the age of twenty-two or twenty-three he was sent to Italy to command a contingent of troops in order to help Ferdinand I of Naples maintain his rule against the Angevins and their allies. Since Skanderbeg was busy with internal affairs in Albania, Constantine played a leading role in the Albanian expedition before his uncle's arrival. He served under Ferdinand who had been trying to regain his territory after it had been overrun by the Angevins and their supporters. Along with Constantine's cavalry, Francesco del Balzo, the Duke of Andria who had remained loyal to Ferdinand, managed to defeat Ercole d'Este, one of the pro-Angevin nobles in Gargano. From Gargano, they were then able to collect customs-duties of 30,000 ducats. Constantine and Ferdinand were able to regain some lost territory before Skanderbeg landed in Italy and took over the command."

Thomas Heywood documents their lives and deaths in his Fortune by Land and Sea and there was also a two-part pamphlet published about them -A True Relation of the Lives and Deaths of the two most Famous English Pyrats, Purser, and Clinton. In common with other petty pirates of his region and time, Atkinson maintained close relationships with local landowners such as John Killigrew of Arnwick, in order to ensure safe harbor for the disembarkation of stolen goods. When Atkinson was captured in 1583 and imprisoned in Exeter jail, his connections ensured a friendly testimonial from the mayor, which was read at his trial. Despite the mayor's endorsement, Atkinson was sentenced to death and transported to London for execution. His death is recorded in the 1583 parish records for St Botolph's Aldersgate, near Wapping Dock, which read:\"Clinton Atkinson some tyme a housekeeper & dwelling at grace church street & sold haberdashery wares, was for piracy executed at wapping 31 August 1583.\""

  "text" : "Charles Ephrussi (24 December 1849 – 30 September 1905) was a Jewish-French art critic, art historian, and art collector. He also was a part-owner (from 1885) and then editor (from 1894) as well as a contributor to the Gazette des Beaux-Arts, the most important art historical periodical in France. A member of the wealthy Ephrussi family, he spent the first ten years of his life in Odessa, a major port on the Black Sea where his grandfather was a grain industrialist, before moving to Vienna. His father Léon and his uncle Ignace were in charge of establishing branches of the family business in Europe. In 1871, Charles Ephrussi moved to the newly built Hôtel Ephrussi, 81 rue de Monceau, in Paris, with his parents and brothers. The next year, he traveled to Italy, where he began to collect art. On his return to Paris, he became more involved in both the purchase of art and writing about it, publishing his first article in Gazette des Beaux-Arts in 1876. Like most of his publications, it concerned Renaissance art. He also gave two works of art to the Louvre at this time. In about 1880, Charles Ephrussi became interested in the art of the Impressionists and, within the next few years, purchased some 40 works by Monet, Manet, Degas, Renoir, and Pissarro, among others. He has been identified as the man in a top hat standing with his back to us in Renoir's Luncheon of the Boating Party (Phillips Collection, Washington, DC.). An account of the collection hanging in his study appears in a letter written in 1881 by the Symbolist poet Jules Laforgue (later published in La Revue blanche). But, to the distress of some of the Impressionists, he continued to buy other types of art, including pictures by his friends Gustave Moreau and Paul Baudry. It also was at this time that he began to collect Japanese lacquers and netsukes, the subject of Edmund de Waal's The Hare with Amber Eyes (2010) which also devotes considerable attention to Charles' life and artistic interests. In 1891, Ephrussi moved with his brother Ignace to a grander Parisian hôtel at 11, avenue d'Iéna. His taste had changed, and he decorated his part in the Empire style. By this time, he was a well-established figure in the Paris art world, and a welcome guest at some of the most famous salons. He was one of the inspirations for the figure of Swann in Marcel Proust's À la recherche du temps perdu (In Search of Lost Time; titled Remembrance of Things Past in the first translation). All of this changed with the Dreyfus affair in 1894, which polarized France and caused many doors to be closed to Jews. The Ephrussi family was very prominent and thus became the target of anti-Semitic attacks. Charles died in 1905, before Dreyfus was exonerated. He had never married, and left much of his estate to his niece Fanny Kann and her husband Théodore Reinach."

  "text" : "Curt Marvis is President of Digital Media at Lionsgate, a position he has held since April 2008.

In an interview with Variety, Marvis described his job as interfacing with each of Lionsgate's departments (i.e., theatrical, television, home entertainment, music, corporate development, business development, channel business, and investor/financial community) to coordinate all revenue-generating functions related to digital strategies. In his own words: \"...[I]n the home entertainment group, for example, I get involved in everything from shifting windows, pricing issues, iTunes stuff, everything moving from the packaged goods business to the digital world. ...I go to the home entertainment meetings and deal with their issues, to the TV group, etc. I’m spread around all of that. I think you could describe my role in many ways as both business development and also as an implementer once we have a project we can wrap our arms around. So a lot of it is really identifying the issues we’ve got to take care of in each of the divisions of the company and we add resources as we need to.\""

  "text" : "Curtis Fletcher Marbut (1863–1935) served as Director of the Soil Survey Division from 1913 until his death in 1935. Marbut developed the first formal soil classification scheme for the United States. Marbut was born and raised in Barry County, Missouri. He obtained a Bachelor of Science from the University of Missouri in 1889 and a Master of Arts degree from Harvard University in 1894. (He never sat for his final PhD exams at Harvard). Marbut taught Physiography and Geology at the University of Missouri from 1895 until 1910, and also worked for the Missouri Geologic Survey and directed the Missouri Soil Survey. In 1910, Marbut went to work as a Soil Scientist in the Bureau of Soils of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, where he continued until his death in 1935. Marbut became Director of the Soil Survey Division in 1913. Marbut died of pneumonia in 1935 while en route to an assignment in China advising the Chinese Geological Survey on organizing a Soil Survey. As a geologist and geographer his initial view was that soils were surface reflections of the geology below them. Marbut changed to recognize soil science as distinct from geology. Eugene W. Hilgard of the University of California and Hopkins of the University of Illinois greatly influenced this change. The land-grant universities from the very start were close partners in National Cooperative Soil Survey. By 1920, most soil surveyors were graduates of land-grant universities and other agricultural colleges with training in soils and crops. In 1920 Marbut began his work on a soil classification scheme. In 1927 he published a translation of Glinka's The Great Soil Groups of the World and their Development from German to English. His classification scheme became the 1935 system that was modified to become the system published in the 1938 Yearbook of Agriculture, Soils and Men: the 1938 USDA soil taxonomy. At the highest level of classification the soils were divided into pedocals and pedalfers. Pedocals were used in the drier climates and referred to the carbonate rich soils. The Pedalfers began about at the Udic border and referred to soils rich in Aluminum (Alumen) and Iron (Ferrous). Alfer became the root term for Alfisols."

  "text" : "Carmine \"Maggie\" Munro  (8 May 1931 – 29 December 2010) was an Australian Aboriginal elder who lived in Moree, New South Wales. Maggie Munro was a community leader and confidante and was well known as a supporter of human rights for Aboriginal people. She was born Carmine May Smith in 1931 in an Aboriginal camp in Moree, the second of three girls born to Raymond Smith, a boundary rider, and Mary Jane French. Her mother died when she was a toddler and her father remarried. The new union gave Maggie a further 12 more brothers and sisters. According to her Sydney Morning Herald obituary, \"As a child, she and sister Beryl helped their father, who worked on Pullaman Station, in the task of maintaining fences. Beryl also helped break in the horses but Maggie was afraid of them - a fear she wouldn't conquer until later in life\". Munro attended Moree Mission School but finished at primary level, as Aboriginal children weren't permitted to attend the local high school. Fifty years after leaving her primary education behind, Munro she returned to study, taking courses in woodwork and upholstery at Moree TAFE (technical college). She worked with local families in the area as a domestic, a cook at the Gwydir Boarding House and also as a shearers' cook at various stations including Terlings. Its owner, Sinclair Hill, was a firm supporter of the Aboriginal people of the area and he and Munro became lifelong friends. She also worked at the old McMaster Ward, a segregated section of Moree District Hospital reserved for Aborigines. Before the ward was built, Aboriginal mothers gave birth at the site in tents. It was when she was 16, that Munro left Moree for Sydney, gravitating to the Aboriginal community in Redfern. The Redfern community was the center of urban Aboriginal politics in New South Wales. Munro worked in a nearby ice cream factory in Chippendale. She first met Lyall Munro when they were children but years passed before they saw each other again, at the Gunnedah showgrounds in 1948. The pair became inseparable and soon after, ran away to Moree - where Lyall worked as a junior porter for the railways - and eloped. Paula, the first of 12 children, was born in 1950. Lyall Munro would go on to become one of the pillars and elder statesmen of the Australian Aboriginal community. He and Maggie would be part of every essential protest, decision and action for Aboriginal rights for the next 50 years. The Munros were particularly involved in land rights. Lyall and Maggie's son, Lyall junior became well known faces and spokesman for the movement, while Maggie stayed in Moree tending to local community issues. She fostered many children, was an active member of the PTA and was a committed member of the football club auxiliary. According to the Sydney Morning Herald, \"On numerous occasions, Maggie took out first prize at the Moree show for cooking - scones and damper were a specialty - and also won prizes for sewing. She steadfastly refused to get a sewing machine, creating everything by hand and often staying up all night to complete a garment. Once, when the dresses for a local wedding didn't arrive from Sydney in time, Munro sewed them by hand, too.\" The Granniators became one of Munro's lasting legacies. Founded when Munro was 74, the group of Aboriginal grandmothers worked for their community, cooking, babysitting, fostering, clothing and mothering local children. She also worked closely with local police on issues of juvenile crime. In 1993, she was awarded the local National Aboriginal and Islander Day Observance Committee Murri (NSW Aborigine) of the Year Award. Maggie Munro died on 29 December 2010. Her funeral was held on 8 January 2011 at the Moree Memorial Hall. She is survived by her husband Lyall, 10 children, 70 grandchildren, 74 great-grandchildren and three great-great grandchildren."

His work with Mulsant lasted until Mulsant’s death. The majority of the texts on Staphylinidae are the work of the two entomologists but five parts (Habrocerinae, Tachyporinae, Trichophyinae, Picropeplinae and Steninae) are the work of Rey alone. The Coleoptera are not the only study of Mulsant and Rey since they also worked on naturelle des punaises de France -the Natural history of the True Bugs of France. In addition to these publications, Claudius Rey wrote many articles on Coleoptera in journals . He described 8 genera and 48 species. 116 genera and 407 species bear his name alongside that of Mulsant."

  "text" : "Chester Frank Kahapea (March 14, 1945 – March 4, 2011) was an American soil scientist, technician and former newsboy. Kahapea became a symbol of the Hawaiian statehood after an iconic photo of him appeared in newspapers around the United States holding a special edition copy of the Honolulu Star-Bulletin headlined \"Statehood.\" Kahapea became known in state history as \"the face of Hawaii statehood.\" The photo of Kahapea was taken on March 12, 1959, shortly after U.S. President Dwight Eisenhower signed the Hawaii Admission Act, admitting Hawaii as the 50th U.S. state. Kahapea was a twelve-year-old paperboy in Honolulu at the time. People had taken to the streets to celebrate Hawaii's admission to the U.S. and Kahapea reportedly could not keep up with the demand for the special edition Honolulu Star-Bulletin statehood newspapers. Kahapea was selected as the newsboy to hand the first statehood newspaper to then Honolulu Mayor Neal Blaisdell, who was late for the photographer's appointment. With the Mayor late, the reporter began talking to Kahapea, which led to the now famous photograph. In 2009, on the fiftieth anniversary of statehood, Kahapea recalled the instance when an Associated Press reporter took the now iconic photograph, \"He just asked me how I normally sold my papers. So, I held up my hand with the paper - and, just a shot of statehood - and that was it!\" The photo of Kahapea holding a \"Statehood\" special edition appeared in newspapers and publications worldwide, including the New York Times. The photograph made Kahapea a symbol of Hawaii's achievement of statehood. Kahapea become a soil technician for Construction Engineering Labs, testing the quality and composition of soil, cement and asphalt. where he worked for thirty-one years before retiring. In 2008, Kahapea was diagnosed with Lou Gehrig's disease, but acted as a spokesman and activist for those suffering from the disease in Hawaii. He worked to spread awareness of the disease in the state. Kahapea died of complications from Lou Gehrig's disease at Kuakini Medical Center in Honolulu on March 4, 2011, at the age of 65. He was a longtime resident of Waianae, Oahu. He was survived by three children - Christopher, Jeffrey and Nadine. His memorial service was held at the Nuuanu Memorial Park and Mortuary on March 26, 2011."

  "text" : "Born to a Burger family, Lorensz was educated at the Colombo Academy, winning the Turnour Prize in 1846 with Frederick Nell. Beginning his legal practice in 1849, he became a barrister at the Lincoln's Inn in 1855. He was a member of the Royal Asiatic Society, Ceylon Branch . After serving as the District Judge of Chilaw in 1855, he went back to being a practicing lawyer. He was appointed as a Burger non-official member of Legislative Council of Ceylon from 1856 to 1864, as opposed to the official members, who held their seats in the council by virtue of their offices in government. He was the first non-official member to claim and receive the right of introducing a private bill. An advocate for local government, he played a major role in the establishment of the Colombo Municipal Council, the first municipality, of which he was one of the first elected members from 1860 to 1870. He resigned from the Legislative Council in 1864. Lorensz was credited with being the architect of the currency ordinance which enacted that Ceylon should switch from the British currency to its own of rupees and for coining the term Ceylonese. He played a major role in the reform and development of education, the amendment and codification of the law, and the inauguration of the Ceylon Government Railway. In 1859, Lorensz and a syndicate purchased the Examiner, which was renamed as the Ceylon Examiner, thus becoming the first Ceylonese newspaper, of which he was the managing editor. He was part of the Macaulay of Ceylon along with James De Alwis, Frederick Nell and his brother Louis, John Prins, Charles Ferdinands and Dandris de Silva Gunaratna inspired by the Young England movement. The Lorensz Scholarship is awarded at Royal College Colombo his old alma mater in his memory since 1876."

He received the Kendra Sahitya Academy Award in 1962 for Kanchana Sita. It was later adapted into a film with same name by G. Aravindan. His another major work was Nashtakkachavadam which won the M. P. Paul prize. Sreekantan Nair experimented successfully with stage direction and concepts of theatre. He has also written some short stories."

It is not known whether he batted left- or right-handed or what his bowling style was. He appeared in one match for Somerset in 1902 with little success, and returned for seven further games in 1905. His only batting success came in the match against Lancashire in 1905, when he made 53 in the second innings, more than double his second highest career score; in this match, the Lancashire bowler Walter Brearley took 17 Somerset wickets, including four wickets in four balls – the last two of the first innings and the first two of the second innings. Brown was dismissed by Brearley in both innings, and Somerset lost the game by an innings and 160 runs inside two days."

  "text" : "Curtis Bernard Gans (June 17, 1937 – March 15, 2015) was an American activist, writer, and expert on American voting patterns. With Allard K. Lowenstein, Gans in 1967 started and headed the Dump Johnson movement. Based on opposition to the Vietnam War, the movement, which was considered quixotic at first, grew strong and was instrumental in setting in motion events which eventually persuaded president Lyndon Johnson that continuing his campaign to be re-nominated for the presidency by his party would be difficult and divisive and uncertain of success. Johnson withdrew his candidacy, an unusual event in American politics for a sitting president. Gans studied turnout and voting patterns for more than three decades. He co-founded and was director of the Center for the Study of the American Electorate, formerly housed at American University in Washington, D. C. Gans was commonly sought out by major American publications as an expert on voting patterns and was sometimes called on by the US State Department's Foreign Press Center to brief foreign reporters during the runup to American elections. Additionally, he served as a consultant to the Woodrow Wilson Center for International Scholars, the National Committee for an Effective Congress, and managed a number of political campaigns. In 2015, he died at the age of 77 of lung cancer."

  "text" : "Carl A. Finley, Jr. (March 23, 1924 in Dallas, Texas – March 30, 2002) was a minority owner of the Kansas City A's. Following three years of military service during World War II, Finley attended Southern Methodist University in his native Dallas, earning bachelor's degrees in History and Journalism. This background prepared him for 13 years as a high school teacher and principal at Thomas Jefferson High School, while he started his family in his home town. A career change in 1962 landed Carl with the Oakland A's when he accepted a position as minority owner of the Kansas City Athletics team after being 'romanced' into this capacity by his cousin Charlie O. Finley who bought into the team in 1960. Carl is best known as \"...A's owner Charlie O. Finley's 'right-hand man' during the A’s stay in Kansas City all the way through to Finley’s sale of the team in 1980. This architect of the Oakland powerhouse teams of the 1970s was recruited by his cousin, Charlie, a real estate tycoon, from his position as a high school principal to run a professional sports franchise (with a handful of staff) for a mostly-absentee owner.\" Charlie O. Finley tried hard to keep the A's in Kansas City with their loyal fans, but due to outside forces, the team had no choice but to leave Kansas City in 1967. Oakland, CA was the only place with a coliseum ready to move into right away. So, the 1968 season was our first in Oakland, CA. This was Oakland's first MLB team. With the A's move to Oakland, California in 1968, Carl & his daughter Nancy moved from Texas to Oakland so he could manage the business. Carl was a private and humble individual. In the off-season, Carl enjoyed teaching 'Business Law' part-time at Laney College, in Oakland, CA."

  "text" : "Cawton Aston (active 1693 – 1733) was an English builder of spinets. He was the seventh and last apprentice of instrument builder John Player (1636 - 1707), and the only one to set up his own business. In 1730 he was living at the Prince’s Arms in New Queen Street in London. Two spinets signed by Aston are currently known; the first is dated 1726 and has the range GG-g΄΄΄ (five octaves). The case is decorated with inlay. The natural keys are covered in bone, and the sharps are made of a “sandwich” of ivory and ebony, sometimes referred to as “skunktail sharps” because of their appearance. The instrument was restored by Arnold Dolmetsch in 1898; Colonial Williamsburg purchased it in 1960. The second instrument was built in 1733 and also has the range GG-g΄΄΄. The keyboard has ivory-covered naturals and skunktail sharps, just as on the 1726 spinet. Many parts, such as the bridge, nut, and stand are replacements; the soundboard rose is probably not original. The instrument has been in a private collection in England for approximately thirty years. A spinet built c.1700 whose lowest key is marked “C.A.” has been attributed to Aston; this instrument is currently housed in the Finchcocks Musical Museum. It has the range GG/BB-d΄΄΄ (4½ octaves), with a broken octave. This compass is very common in spinets made between 1690 and 1710. The natural keys are covered with ebony, while the sharps are solid ivory. Overall the instrument is similar to those made by John Player. Mole states that Boalch mentions a spinet signed by Cawton Aston and Thomas Barton, dated 1709, that once belonged to Edwin M. Ripin. Boalch believed it to be in the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston; however, this instrument is not currently in that collection."

  "text" : "Colleen M. Garry (born July 21, 1962 in Lowell, Massachusetts) is an American politician who represents the 36th Middlesex District in the Massachusetts House of Representatives. She was an aide to State Representative John Cox, who represented Dracut and part of Lowell. In 1994 she was elected to represent a new district consisting of Dracut, Tyngsborough, and Dunstable. Dunstable has since been transferred to a neighboring district so the current district consists only of Dracut and Tyngsborough. She is a moderate to conservative member of the House Democratic Caucus. In 2015, Representative Garry came under fire for comments criticizing an act of civil disobedience which obstructed a major Massachusetts highway. Representative Garry accused protestors affiliated with the Black Lives Matter movement of being \"terrorists\" and claimed that \"structural racism is a fraud.\""

  "text" : "Heinz Jakob \"Coco\" Schumann (born 14 May 1924) is a German jazz musician. Schumann was born in Berlin, Germany. His father Alfred was Jewish by choice (a German Christian practicing convert to Judaism) and his mother Hedwig née Rothholz was Jewish by birth. Schumann became passionate about Swing after having heard it during the Berlin Olympics. He was transported first to Theresienstadt at the age of nineteen, where he became a member of the Ghetto Swingers. Finally he and Martin Roman were transported to Auschwitz, where he came face to face with Josef Mengele. When Mengele inquired of the blue-eyed, nineteen-year-old Coco where he came from and what he did, Schumann shouted, \"Berlin, Herr Obersturmbannfuhrer! Plumber, Herr Obersturmbannfuhrer!\" When the Americans dismantled the camps, liberation reached Coco almost too late: Just a few days before the end of the Nazi regime, he had contracted the dreaded spotted fever that had carried off his campmates by the hundreds, and he spent weeks fighting high fevers and delirious nightmares. He and one other man were the only ones to survive the sick bay. When he was finally able to return home to Berlin, he learned that his grandparents, aunts, uncles, and cousins had perished in the camps. But he found his parents alive. Coco’s father had ingeniously succeeded in keeping his Jewish wife hidden from the Nazis by declaring her dead after a disastrous fire. After the war, Coco Schumann became a celebrated Jazz guitarist. He played with Marlene Dietrich, Ella Fitzgerald, and Helmut Zacharias, among others, before founding his own Coco Schumann Quartett. Coco Schumann's eventful and colorful life is a subject of and is celebrated in a German-language true-to-life color graphic novel by Caroline Gille and Niels Schröder. Subject graphic novel has an unmistakable highly compelling \"autobiographical/first-person account\" narrative thread."

Holden was first president of the group during 1946–48, as suggested by Bomberg, after which Bomberg became president and the group extended to 11 members, among them Dennis Creffield. The group was active until 1951. Holden met the Swedish artist Torsten Renquist and has exhibited in Sweden. From 1956, he lived in Sweden and his artworks are also in collections there.

  "text" : "Chrysostomos (Tomis) P. Panayiotopoulos MD, PhD, FRCP is an eminent neurologist in the field of the epilepsies. Panayiotopoulos syndrome is named after him. Born in the island of Tinos, Greece (31 January 1938) he is married to Thalia Valeta, actress, writer and dramatherapist; they have two children and five grandchildren. C. P. Panayiotopoulos studied medicine and specialised in Neurology and Clinical Neurophysiology in Greece and England. He has investigated the clinical and neurophysiological aspects of muscle and nerve function (he was first to describe F-chronodispersion) and is particularly known for his study of the epilepsies. He has written over 140 articles and editorials in prestigious journals including Brain, Neurology, Annals of Neurology, Archives of Disease in Childhood, Epilepsia, Journal of Child Neurology, Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry. His books on epilepsies and particularly \"A clinical guide to epileptic syndromes and their treatment\" revised 2nd edition, Springer, 2010 are praised as landmarks in the epileptological literature. He is the Editor of the recent 3 volume “Atlas of Epilepsies\". His work on establishing the syndromic diagnosis of epilepsies and the appropriate video-EEG methodology for their diagnosis has been regarded as ground breaking. \"Panayiotopoulos syndrome\" and autonomic status epilepticus specific to childhood are amongst his main contributions. His publications on idiopathic generalized epilepsies and absence seizures have shaped the current thought of their diagnosis and management. He is also the first to establish objective differential criteria between visual symptoms of occipital epilepsy and migraine. C P Panayiotopoulos is currently Consultant emeritus at St. Thomas' Hospital, London where he has served over the last 20 years as a Consultant in Clinical Neurophysiology and Epilepsies. Prior to this, he has been appointed Clinical Professor of Neurology, University of Colorado and Head and Professor of Neurology, University of Riyadh (1983–1988). He has also been an invited Associate Professor to Harvard University and Professor to the University of Western Australia. Recently, he received the 2012 Excellence in Epilepsy Award by the British ILAE."

Guernsey ran for the newly created 2nd District and won in the November, 2012 general election.

Originally, Karlsborg (Carolusburg) was where the Danish chief administrator was located. This had initially been in Swedish hands and reverted to Sweden by 15 April 1659. It subsequently became Dutch on 2 May 1663. Any Swedish designs on it were abandoned with the Treaty of Breda concluded on 21 July 1667. Prior to that, the Danes had made Fort Friedensborg the administrative center of their Gold Coast possessions. Fort Christiansborg became the capital of Danish West Africa after the English invaded Friedensborg as the means for collecting the Danish commander (Lieutenant Lykke)'s gambling debts. Prior to Crull, Bartholomaus von Gronstein had been designated Governor. The title of governor was not given on a regular basis. Only Magnus Prang would be given that designation again in 1681. Normally, the chief administrator of the Danish Gold Coast was titled Opperhoved. It was only with Christian Tychsen, who was appointed in 1766, that the title of governor was given with regularity thereafter."

  "text" : "Charles Henry Coote (1840–1899) was a librarian at the British Museum. He obtained during his long service of 41 years in the Museum such an intimate acquaintance with the details of old maps that he became of the first authorities on the subject. In 1878 he published in the New Shakspere Society's Transactions a paper on \"Shakspere's New Map in Twelfth Night\". In 1886, with E. Delmar Morgan, he prepared for the Hakluyt Society Early Voyages to Russia and Persia; in 1888 he edited, with an introduction and bibliography, A Reproduction of Johann Schöner's Globe of 1523; in 1894 he published, with prologue and notes, The Voyage from Lisbon to India, 1505-6, by Albericus Vespuccius; and in 1894-95 he supplied the explanatory text to F. Muller and Co.'s reproductions of Remarkable Maps of the Fifteenth, Sixteenth, and Seventeenth Centuries. He also wrote the introduction to the Earl of Crawford's Autotype Facsimiles of Three Mappemondes. C. H. Coote contributed many articles to the ninth edition of Encyclopædia Britannica and to the Dictionary of National Biography, and he had been for several years a contributor to the Athenæum."

  "text" : "Christian Kramer (died 1834) was a composer, arranger, musician and Master of the King's Musick between 1829 and 1834. He served under two British kings; George IV and William IV. Kramer was born in Hannover and was a pupil of Romantic composer Peter Winter. He became a court musician, eventually rising to lead George IV's personal orchestra (\"band\") which, according to Dwight's Journal of Music was \"in its time acknowledged to be one of the best in Europe\". Notably, many of the musicians in his band were sourced from Germany. John Dwight goes on to note that he could play all of the instruments in his orchestra to a remarkable degree. A Dictionary of Musical Information of 1876 notes that he was \"a composer of great ability\", although none of his compositions have remained in the repertoire. He was apparently on good terms with the king; according to one account, like George IV, Kramer suffered from gout and was often inquired of by his master \"after a simultaneous attack\"."

From 1960-65, he worked as a Canadian Wildlife Service biologist, specializing in polar bear and muskox research. In 1965, he was appointed Curator of Quaternary Zoology with the National Museums of Canada and was Chief of the Paleobiology Division (1982–91). He carried out detailed studies of the ice age animals of the Yukon, concentrating his work on the unglaciated country near Dawson and Old Crow; and on Pliocene vertebrates and environments of Ellesmere Island where he spent 10 field seasons between 1992 and 2008 leading a team collecting fossils from a unique 4-million-year-old vertebrate site (the Beaver Pond site) near the head of Strathcona Fiord. His interests include: the ice age vertebrates of Canada, Alaska and Greenland; the evolution and distribution of arctic and alpine mammals; and climatic change in Canada during the ice age. He has written or contributed over 300 scientific papers, publications and reports."

  "text" : "Charles Ross Lyall (3 October 1880 – 4 June 1950) was a career soldier who played first-class cricket for Somerset in two matches in the 1911 season. He was born in Calcutta, India and died at Basingstoke, Hampshire. Lyall was an officer in the British Indian Army from 1900 to 1933. He graduated from the Royal Military College in 1900 as a \"Queen's India cadet\" and placed on the unattached list as a second lieutenant. In 1901, he was moved from the unattached list to the Indian Staff Corps. In 1902 he was promoted to full lieutenant. The only cricket played by Lyall that is recorded from this period is a single non-first-class three-day match for the North-West Frontier Province against the Punjab cricket team in late 1903, in which Lyall played as a lower order batsman. In 1909, Lyall was promoted to captain attached to the 36th Sikhs regiment of the Indian army. In 1911, he appears to have been in England for some time during the cricket season: he played in one County Championship match against Yorkshire in May, scoring an unbeaten 21 in the first innings and 8 in the second. Two months later, he followed that with a second first-class match, this time against the touring Indian cricket team, in which he scored 15 and 11 not out. That was the extent of his first-class cricket and left him with the odd statistic of a batting average higher (at 27.50 runs per innings) than his highest score. Lyall returned to the Indian army. In 1916, he was promoted temporarily from captain to major in the 36th Sikhs. From 18 May 1915 to 30 September 1917 he was a Recruiting Officer. He served in Mesopotamia from 14 Oct 1917 to 24 June 1918. He was appointed an instructor at the Central School of Musketry 1 April 1919 to 30 April 1921. He went on to serve in Waziristan between 1921–23 and was wounded. In 1919, there is a report in the London Gazette of a temporary promotion from major to lieutenant-colonel for a period of six days in 1918, while he commanded a battalion of 151st Indian Infantry. In 1922, he is reported to have relinquished the rank of lieutenant-colonel at the end of a period of commanding a battalion within the 36th Sikhs. Promoted lieutenant-colonel 5 July 1924. By 1928, he temporarily moves on to the unemployed list before being reappointed to the Indian Army in July. There was another similar temporary move into and then out of unemployed status in 1929. He was appointed the Recruiting Officer, Jullundur 28 May 1929. Finally he retired from the Indian Army in 1933."

  "text" : "Clyde Leroy Fletcher (August 2, 1894 – November 15, 1969) was the founder and sole president of the True Church of Jesus Christ (Cutlerite), a schismatic faction of the Church of Jesus Christ (Cutlerite) which existed from 1953 until his death in 1969. Following his demise, his few remaining adherents elected to reunite with the main Cutlerite church in Independence, Missouri. Born and raised in the Cutlerite community in Clitherall, Minnesota, Fletcher elected not to relocate with the main body when that group moved the church headquarters to Independence in the 1920s. Following the death of President Emery Fletcher in 1953, the Independence church, which then contained the majority of Cutlerite members, elected Erle Whiting as the new President of the Church. This was in keeping with a Cutlerite tradition that passed the presidency of the church to the former leader's First Counselor, subject to the approval of the membership. Clyde Fletcher and the Cutlerite remnant in Minnesota did not approve of this step, and Fletcher was accordingly elected president of his congregation in Clitherall, which he subsequently claimed to be the sole legitimate continuation of the Cutlerite organization. Fletcher named his church the \"True Church of Jesus Christ (Cutlerite)\", and began a lengthy court battle with the Independence organization over church properties in Minnesota. A Minnesota court finally ruled in favor of the Independence church in 1966, giving them sole control over all Cutlerite properties and church records. Fletcher refused to accept the legitimacy of the Independence organization, however, and remained at the head of his church (which was headquartered in the Cutlerite meetinghouse in Clitherall) until his death in 1969. To the end of his life, he continued to claim that his was the only true Cutlerite sect, and the only true church on earth. Fletcher did not change any of the distinctive beliefs of the Cutlerite church; his organization remained exactly identical to the main body in Independence in every respect save leadership. Following Fletcher's death, the few remaining members of his organization elected to accept an offer to return to the Independence church, which led to the folding of Fletcher's church and the healing of the schism he had provoked."

  "text" : "Mongan was originally a Roman Catholic who recanted and joined the Anglican community. His brother was a Catholic priest.Terence Mongan was Chaplain of the 62nd Regiment of Foot, before which point he was using the name Charles Mongan.He adopted the surname of Warburton (with the forenames Charles Mongan, or possibly Terrence Charles Mongan) by Royal Warrant in 1792 and, after serving as Dean of Ardagh (1790–1800) and then Clonmacnoise (1800–1806) was consecrated Bishop of Limerick on 13 July 1806. He translated to Cloyne in 1820 and died in post on 9 August 1826, aged 72. Arthur O'Neill in his memoirs gives the following interesting account of Mongan and his family- \"In my travels I became acquainted with a Dominic Mungan, I may say I had known him since I was twelve years old. He was born blind in the County of Tyrone, and a real good harper. He was a Roman Catholic. I presume my following reason will plead an apology for mentioning his religion. He was a great economist, but would spend money as genteelly as any man occasionally. He had three sons, Mark, John, and Terence, whom he educated in the first style. Mark was educated for a priest, and finished his studies in France, in the College of Lombard, where he obtained upwards of forty premiums for his translations of Greek into French. After he finished his studies he came home, but in consequence of his intense application he fell into a decay, and died in his father's house in Strabane. John, the second son, was bred a physician, and practised in and about Monaghan, and the adjacent country, with good reputation. About five years ago as he was returning from the races of Middleton in Monaghan in his gig he was upset and smashed to pieces. Terence, the third and youngest son, is now Bishop of Limerick, and was formerly Dean of Ardagh. He had a good delivery, sung well, and acquired great interest. He and a priest O'Beirne, who was Chaplain to Lord Fitzwilliam when Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland, were promoted to their present ranks of Protestant Bishops. Now my reason for mentioning the Roman Catholic persuasion is this, that the doctor and the bishop both read their recantations; the doctor before and the bishop after their father's death. He in his lifetime used to travel the north-west circuit with his harp, and at one time, as he was playing for one of the Judges, he asked Dominic his reasons for not speaking to his son, the doctor, since he turned Protestant. 'My Lord' says Dominic, 'I spared no expense on him when he was unable to provide for himself; and assure your Lordship, I am no bigot; but I think it was his duty to consult me before he changed his religion. It was not, however, for the sake of religion he did so, but he fell in love with a young lady who was a Protestant. She informed him she could not have him as he was a Papist, on which he read his recantation, and then demanded her hand, on which, to his mortification, she scornfully informed him that she would be sorry to marry a turncoat.\""

  "text" : "Charles Wilkin (c. 1750 – 28 May 1814 London), was an English engraver, painter and publisher who exhibited at the Royal Academy between 1783 and 1808, and is best known for his stipple engravings. Some of his more famous works were \"Lady Cockburn and her Children\" (1792) after Joshua Reynolds and \"Mrs Parkyns\" (1795) after John Hoppner. Wilkin also published ten stipple-engraved prints depicting \"Portraits of Ladies of Rank and Fashion\" (1797–1803), \"executed in a manner to unite the Higher Finishing of Painting with the Spirit and Freedom of Drawing\" - three were his own and seven were after John Hoppner, though Wilkin was vexed over \"the Difficulty that attends getting Mr Hoppner’s Pictures\". Technically, Wilkin's engravings \"are among the best examples of stipple, the admixture of etched lines and a vigorous use of the roulette preserving a thoroughly draughtsmanlike style.\" Wilkin managed to stipple-engrave with a quite distinctive style, which was not an easy achievement, since this form of engraving does not lend itself to individual expression. Frank Wilkin (Francis William Wilkin, 1800–1842) and Henry Wilkin (1801–1852), his sons, also exhibited their paintings at the Royal Academy."

As a pianist, she studied with the Mozart and Schubert specialist Lili Kraus. As of 2011, Cox is a Professor at the University of California at Berkeley. Her orchestrations have been described as \"music that demonstrates an extremely refined and imaginative sense of instrumental color and texture,\" \"well-wrought,\" and \"not easily classifiable.\"and as having \"prismatic colors\" that suggest \"a hybrid of Olivier Messiaen and Carl Ruggles — an odd couple indeed.\" Tim Page has described her Into the Wild as \"a dark, fertile musical fantasy with some haunting and desolate chords.\" Bay Area composer Cindy Cox’s work has been called “a delight to listen to” and “buoyant, puckish, rhythmically alive and crisply engaging” by San Francisco Chronicle critic Joshua Kosman. The University of California, Berkeley professor’s music is noted for its special tunings, harmonies, and textural colorations. She has received numerous awards, commissions, and the prestigious appointment of a Fellow at both the Tanglewood Music Center and Aspen Music Festivals. Her work has been performed throughout Europe, as well as Carnegie Hall, the National Gallery, the Kennedy Center, and by the Los Angeles Philharmonic. She is married to the poet John Campion."

As a result he is particularly popular with the rural population of Peru. Ernesto Pimental's early career was as a \"drag queen\" but after he conceived his La Chola persona in the early 1990s he has increasingly become a beloved personality throughout Peru. Ernesto also produces and stars in the La Chola Chabuca Circo (Circus) which is a very popular annual event in July and August.

After winning the first two on Southern Speed and Pinker Pinker respectively, Williams was suspended for careless riding during the 2011 Bendigo Cup. The horse he was scheduled to ride in the Melbourne Cup, Dunaden, went on to win with last-minute replacement jockey Christophe Lemaire on board. In the 2012 Caulfield Cup, Williams rode Dunaden to an unprecedented victory. A few days before the race Dunaden had drawn the outside barrier (barrier 22, although after scratchings it became barrier 18), and was also the top weighted horse for the race, carrying 58 kg. Dunaden had subsequently drifted in the betting odds, as no horse had ever won the Caulfield Cup from wider than barrier 15, nor carrying top weight. The win also made it back-to-back Caulfield Cup victories for Williams."

He then became the apprentice of Michael Leach, at Yelland Pottery where he came to love the rich Fremington clay and earthernware of Fishley. A further year at Brannam Pottery in Barnstable allowed him to develop his throwing skills and to gain the ability to make large pots. Residing in North Devonallowed Bowen the opportunity to help fire pots at Wenford Bridge with Michael Cardew and tomeet Svend Bayer who became a lifelong friend. In 1971 Bowen purchased a small agricultural property at Shebbear in North Devon and established his pottery with large double-chambered woodfiring kilns. Bowen still uses local Fremington clay and is internationally known and respected for hispowerful yet intimate pieces. Bowen exhibits widely in the UK throughout Europe, North America and Japan."

By 1883 he conducted the orchestra of the Reunion theaters in Erfurt; he left this appointment in 1885, meanwhile he had also clarinet learned to play. He then joined the band of the 71st (3rd Thuringian) Infantry Regiment in Erfurt and continued his musical training, found a way to operate a soloist in the concerts as a violinist and pianist. He also served as conductor of various choirs and choral societies. In 1888 he composed as a tribute to the dying emperor, the now famous Kaiser Friedrich Marsch. On November 5, 1890 he passed the military band testing at the Academy of Music in Berlin from. On 20 September 1891 he became conductor of the band of the 113th (5th Baden) Infantry Regiment based in Freiburg im Breisgau. He worked here for 21 years and his fame as a conductor and composer had long since gone beyond the national borders. In 1901 he was appointed Royal Kapellmeister in Baden and in 1906 he was appointed Royal Music Director. In January 1912 Friedemann was with his regimental band at the Café Kropf in Freiburg, for his farewell concert. For health reasons he left military music in 1912. A new commitment was waiting for him in Bern, Switzerland. There he became head of the Bern Town Band, Stadtmusik bern, and led this wind orchestra to a respectable level. Friedemann was the city of Bern music not unknown, but he was at the Federal Music Festival 1906 in Freiburg on the jury, which the music of the first city in Category in the first Rank 1st Gold laurel awarded. With this band he made trips to Germany, France, Italy and Spain. When he retired in 1933, he has also made its conductor from office. In 1935 he was appointed music professor because of his outstanding service. He founded in Bern is also a self-published and a music school. Friedemann died on April 9, 1952 in Bern. Friedemann wrote symphonic music, chamber music, choral works and songs. Of course, his oeuvre also includes wind band works, including 140 marches."

He graduated in 1864 and was a member of Skull and Bones. In 1866, he was the first person to be awarded a PhD in philosophy from an American institution. His dissertation was A Critique of John Stuart Mill's Examination of Hamilton's Philosophy. In 1869 he earned his JUD at the University of Berlin. His dissertation was De Jure Emigrandi. During the Franco-Prussian War, MacLean was a war correspondent for the New York World. He accompanied U.S. military observer General Philip Sheridan and acted as his interpreter. He was one of the first non-combatants to enter Paris following the surrender of the French and witnessed the signing of the Treaty of Versailles. He recounted the Battle of Sedan and the capture of Napoleon III in his \"The Surrender of an Emperor\", published in The Second Book of the Authors Club: Liber Scriptorum (1921). He also interviewed Otto von Bismarck, Patrice de Mac-Mahon, Duke of Magenta, Adolphe Thiers, and Léon Gambetta. After a brief stint in St. Petersburg for The Times, he returned to the US to practice law. He entered the law office of Samuel J. Tilden, who was related to his mother, and would practice law in New York City most of the rest of his life. He lectured on law at Columbia University (1873–4) and New York University (1885–97). He served on the Board of Police Commissioners variously as counsel, a member, and president and served in various other city office and boards. He was elected to be a judge on the New York Supreme Court and served for fourteen years (1895–1909). In 1887, he married Marie Mott (1854?–1946), daughter of industrialist Jordan L. Mott."

Born in Lorraine, he made a name above all for his basic research in archives concerning the feudal seigneurie in Lorraine and eastern France. His intellectual biography of his former colleague at Strasbourg and Paris, Marc Bloch, long delayed by Perrin's duties at the Sorbonne, was published in 1948.

In 1892, he commenced extensive excavations of the Great Marpole Midden in Vancouver for the Art, Historical, and Scientific Association of Vancouver, stimulating study of other middens in the region. The Great Midden, which dates from 2400-1600 years BP and was a living village until the first of the great smallpox epidemics in the late 17th Century, is today a National Heritage Site of Canada. His published works include reports collected in Ralph Maud's four volume study on Salish peoples, and his 1907 work The Native Races of British North America: The Far West. During the First World War he enlisted in the Canadian Expeditionary Force with 242nd Battalion, CEF. He died June 30th 1944 at Vancouver."

  "text" : "Carlos Roberto Aldabe (January 1, 1919 – October 16, 1998) was an Argentine Association Football player and coach. He is mostly known for leading the then prominently staffed Colombian club CD Los Millonarios as player-manager to their first championship. As player Roberto \"Cacho\" Aldabe was from 1939 to 1944 a defender with CA Platense in the Argentine first division and from 1945 to 1946 with Quilmes AC in the second division Primera B. Both clubs are located in the Province of Buenos Aires. He joined CD Los Millonarios in the Colombian capital Bogotá where he was player-manager in 1949. After the professionalisation of the Colombian football in the previous season the Argentine star El Maestro Adolfo Pedernera from CA River Plate in Buenos Aires joined the club in June 1949. Two months later he was followed by Néstor Rossi and Alfredo Di Stéfano from the same club. The acquisition of top stars from Argentina was aided by player strikes in Argentina in the years 1947 and 1948 which disrupted regular play and Colombia accepting players that were not formally released from there previous clubs. In practical terms this meant that Millonarios and the other Colombian clubs did not have to pay any transfer fees, which in turn led to a suspension of the country from FIFA-membership. Still in 1949 CD Los Millonarios won its first Colombian championship title. In the following year Adolfo Pedernera took on the responsibilities as player-manager - a position in which he would lead the side, then known as Ballet Azul, the \"Blue Ballet\" until 1954 to further titles. Aldabe initially continued playing for Millonarios, but later in the year moved on to Peru where he joined Ciclista Lima, a club which has just rejoined the first division after relegation two years earlier. Star of the side in this phase was the striker Juan Emilio Salinas. From mid-1952 he played a few more matches in Colombia for Santa Fe CD and in the following year for Universidad from Bogotá. After his return to Argentina he coached there between 1953 and 1968 several professional clubs, albeit none of the top sides. After an engagement with second division side Quilmes AC between 1953 and 1954 he worked in Chile. In 1956 he coached CD Universidad Católica in the capital Santiago, where the legendary keeper Sergio Livingstone stood in the goal mouth. In the previous season Universidad happened to be relegated as the incumbent champions, but by the end of 1956 managed to return to the top flight. Between 1957 and 1958 he coached Everton de Viña del Mar in the north of the country. Between 1960 and 1968 he held six more relatively short term engagements with Argentine first and second division clubs - without adding to his trophy tally."

  "text" : "Cecil Godfrey Murgatroyd (22 May 1958 – 21 May 2001) was mainly known for being involved in New Zealand national politics along with Australian Federal and State politics, and for his role in the 1998 Australian Constitutional convention. From 1981 until his death in 2001 he was generally associated with running, and standing as a candidate for, 2 non-serious parties, the Imperial British Conservative Party (IBCP) and the McGillicuddy Serious Party (McGSP), which both operated in the two countries. Murgatroyd's platforms were typically absurdist and of a 'pataphysical nature. Murgatroyd was initially active in New Zealand politics in the early 1980s, as a candidate for the (then) Wizard of Christchurch's IBCP and as the founder of the Waikato Cavalry Regiment of Alf's Imperial Army in the city of Hamilton. In the 1981 election he stood in the Waipa electorate for the Wizard or IBC party, and came fourth with 125 votes. In 1982 he moved to Melbourne. It was there he set up the Australian headquarters of the McGillicuddy Serious Party in 1984. After his move to Australia, he stood in elections there too against, among others, Prime Minister Bob Hawke in two federal elections in the 1980s and 1990s. Bob Hawke likened him to the rear end of a donkey. He often returned to New Zealand to contest parliamentary elections also, using tactics he described as being designed for \"making elections interesting\". In 1990 the McGillicuddy Serious Party invited him back to New Zealand to contest the seat of Christchurch North against New Zealand Prime Minister Mike Moore. In this campaign he described himself as the McGSP's \"Prime Ministerial specialist\" due to his experience in Australia. Murgatroyd's aim in life was to be the first ever election candidate to not collect even one single vote, a record he hoped to achieve upon his return to New Zealand. Murgatroyd was also involved in the Australian Constitutional Convention, being a candidate under the ticket \"Queen Anne of Australia\". In his campaign as a candidate in the 1998 Victorian state election Murgatroyd described himself as \"a holy Prophet for the Senate\". He proposed that new migrants would have to pass a batting bowling and fielding tests, to assessing their cricket skills, to improve Australia's future sporting prospects.He was diagnosed with cancer of the duodenum in 1999, and died in 2001 in Melbourne."

He died of a heart attack in 2005 while on vacation in Dresden, Germany. In 1954 Perry left his home in Winter Park, Florida to attend the University of Florida. His college years were interrupted by his service in the U.S. Navy. In 1960 he earned a bachelor’s degree in building construction from the University of Florida. Perry founded Charles Perry Construction in 1968. He was instrumental in the construction of numerous Gainesville landmarks, including the downtown public library, the former and current Alachua County, Florida courthouses, North Florida Regional Medical Center, and many buildings at the University of Florida and at Santa Fe College. Perry developed liaisons with local education leaders to advance education in construction crafts and trades. His company completed three institutions in his honor: in 2007, the Charles R. Perry Construction Yard at the University of Florida M. E. Rinker, Sr. School of Building Construction; in 2009, the Charles R. Perry Construction Institute at Santa Fe College’s School of Construction, and the Charles R. and Nancy V. Perry Center for Emerging Technologies for Santa Fe College's Laboratory Technology Programs. Perry started PPI Construction Management in 1993 to better serve the needs of his clients, many of whom were favoring the construction management delivery method over standard hard bid. Perry remained active in both companies until his death. In 2011, his surviving partners, Breck A. Weingart, John V. Carlson, Domenic E. Scorpio and Brian K. Leslie, united the individual operations of Charles Perry Construction and PPI Construction Management to better serve their diverse client base. When the partners consolidate the two companies, they honored Perry's legacy by naming the new company Charles Perry Partners, Inc."

  "text" : "Chandralekha Perera (Sinhalese: චන්ද්‍රලේකා පෙරේරා) (born 1 December 1961), is a popular Sri Lankan pop singer. Perera was born to a middle-class family in Kurunegala. As a child she often sang at home. At school she frequently sang and successfully took part in inter-school competitions. While studying she sang for the band \"Spring Time\" in Kurunegala. She met her future husband Rookantha Goonatillake in 1976 when he was a keyboard player for this band. Without her knowledge, Perera's father submitted his daughter's name to a Sri-Lankan government-sponsored youth organization National Youth Services Council (NYSC). She subsequently attended and had a successful interview. She also appeared on the national television service in Sri Lanka that was a gift from Japan to Sri Lanka and was at that time broadcasting test transmissions. Perera was noticed by the film director and producer D. B. Nihalsinghe while he was reporting on NYSC. He selected her to act in his new television series Rekha, which made her a star. She was given the award for best television actress in 1986 (for Nadee Geethaya, another series by Nihalsinghe), and the award for best playback singer in the same year (for the film Yali Hamuwennai). She was signed for LUX International by Lever Brothers at that time. Perera has sung duets with many popular singers and actors. Vijaya Kumaranatunga, the late husband of President Chandrika Kumaratunga, sang more than 15 songs with her. Perera married Rookantha Goonatillake in 1989, and they have three daughters and a son. In 2000, she and her husband were violently attacked by the Presidential Security Division (PSD) of president Chandrika Kumaratunga and threatened with death if they performed at anti-government events. The attack sparked a protest by Dharmasiri Bandaranayake who thereafter also received death threats. In the wake of these developments, Artists Against Violence (AAV) was founded. Ten officers of the PSD were arrested for the attacks and given jail sentences in 2013, but one year later pardoned by president Mahinda Rajapaksa."

  "text" : "Carol Graham (born January 29, 1962) is the Leo Pasvolsky Senior Fellow at the Brookings Institution, a College Park professor at the School of Public Policy at the University of Maryland, a research fellow at the Institute for the Study of Labor (IZA), and the author of numerous books, papers and edited volume chapters. Graham has written extensively and is considered an expert on issues including poverty, inequality, insecurity, the political economy of market reforms, subjective well-being, and the economics of happiness. In Happiness around the World: the Paradox of Happy Peasants and Miserable Millionaires (Oxford University Press, 2010, also published in Chinese, Portuguese, and Japanese), Graham explores what we know about the determinants of happiness across and within countries of different development levels, including some counterintuitive and surprising relationships. Her latest book, The Pursuit of Happiness: An Economy of Well-Being (Brookings Institution Press, 2011, also published in Chinese and Japanese), examines what the new science and metrics of well-being can contribute to policy and, in particular, if they can serve as new benchmarks of economic progress. Over the course of her career, Graham’s research has received support from the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation, the World Bank, the Inter-American Development Bank, the Tinker and Hewlett Foundations, and the National Institute of Aging. She recently served on a National Academy of Sciences Panel on well-being metrics and public policy, and received a Distinguished Research Fellow Award from the International Society for Quality of Life Studies in September 2014."

In 1628, Le Grosse was elected Member of Parliament for Orford and sat until 1629 when King Charles decided to rule without parliament for eleven years. In April 1640, Le Grosse was re-elected MP for Orford in the Short Parliament and re-elected MP for Orford for the Long Parliament in November 1640, retaining his seat until 1653. He acquired by marriage a moiety of the manor of Eccles, which allowed him to hold court there. In 1637 he and Dr. Thomas Lushington were instrumental in persuading the physician and philosopher Thomas Browne, to re-locate to Norwich. In 1658 Browne dedicated his Hydriotaphia, Urn Burial to Le Grosse's eldest son, Thomas. Le Grosse died before 31 May 1660. He had married Muriel, the daughter of Sir Thomas Knyvet and his wife Elizabeth and had 2 sons and 6 daughters. The poet Ralph Knevet had dedicated the following poem to him. The King of Pyrrhus shewd the Muses nineAnd Phoebus portraited by sculpture fine:But thou faire Knight-hoods fairer ornamentConspicuously dost to our eyes presentPhoebus, the Muses nine, the Graces three,Mercurie, and Mars, yea more Gods then beeIn Homers Iliads; or at least much greater:For thy mind's a Pantheon, or a Theater,Wherein all vertues, and all graces stand,In decent order link'd, with hand in hand.The[e] 'mongst the chiefest of the Arts few friendsI list: and so adore thy noble ends,That if my Quill to vertue can life give,Thy honourd fame shall Nestors age outlive."

  "text" : "Charles George Broyden (3 February 1933 – 20 May 2011) was a mathematician who specialized in optimization problems and numerical linear algebra. While a physicist working at English Electric Company from 1961–1965, he adapted the Davidon–Fletcher–Powell formula to solving some nonlinear systems of equations that he was working with, leading to his widely cited 1965 paper, \"A class of methods for solving nonlinear simultaneous equations\". He was a lecturer at UCW Aberystwyth from 1965–1967. He later became a senior lecturer at University of Essex from 1967–1970, where he independently discovered the Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno (BFGS) method. After leaving the University of Essex, he continued his research career in the Netherlands and Italy, being awarded the chair at University of Bologna. In later years, he began focusing on numerical linear algebra, in particular conjugate gradient methods and their taxonomy. Broyden died from complications of a severe stroke at the age of 78. He was survived by his wife, Joan, and their three children Chris, Jane and Nick."

  "text" : "Carl Theodor Schulz (5 April 1835 – 16 August 1914) was a Norwegian gardener. He was born in Berlin, Germany, the son of Christian Schulz, a tailor. In the 1850s the young Schulz worked at some market gardens in Berlin and its edge city Potsdam; he was employed at a botanical garden in Hamburg in the subsequent decade. In March 1865, after five years of work in Hamburg, he was hired at the University Botanical Garden in Oslo. He was appointed head gardener in 1893, succeeding the deceased Nils Green. Schulz stayed in that position until his death. In 1895 he released the work Om botaniske haver. Schulz was a founding member of the Christiania Gardener Association and the Norwegian Horticulture Society; he was the first chairman of the former, and vice-chairman of the latter organisation. From 1892 to 1902, he sat on the board of the Horticulture Society. The person who recruited Schulz to Norway was Frederik Schübeler. Schulz married an adopted daughter of Schübeler's, Ingeborg Strengberg (1853–1918), in February 1875 in Østre Aker."

  "text" : "(Not to be confused with the author of Viner's Abridgment, Charles Viner (jurist).) Charles William Viner A.M., Ph.D., (1812 – 14 March 1906) was a British philatelist who was a founding member of the Philatelic Society, London, later to become the Royal Philatelic Society London, and who was present at the initial meeting of the society on 10 April 1869, and serving as its Secretary from 1871 to 1874. His obituary in The London Philatelist referred to him as the \"Father of Philately\" and elsewhere he was described as the vieille garde (old guard) of philately having been actively collecting and writing about stamps since 1860. In 1921 he was entered on the Roll of Distinguished Philatelists as one of the founding Fathers of philately."
