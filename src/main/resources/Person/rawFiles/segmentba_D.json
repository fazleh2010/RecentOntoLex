He also provided training in the reading of Ottoman archival sources. In 2006, Quataert resigned as board chairman of the Institute of Turkish Studies following his statement that scholars should not avoid researching the Armenian Genocide. His resignation was influenced by the Turkish ambassador to the United States, Nabi Sensoy, who had told Quataert that his statement had angered government leaders in Turkey and endangered the Institute's funding."

  "text" : "Daniele Vocaturo is an Italian chess grandmaster. Born December 16, 1989, in Vitinia, a suburb of Rome; in May 2009 he became the third chess player born in Italy to be awarded the Grandmaster title, after Sergio Mariotti in 1974 and Michele Godena in 1996. After his first steps in the chess club of Vitinia, he was trained by the Cuban-Italian GM Lexy Ortega, who followed his career until the age of 16, when he became an International Master. In 2006, Vocaturo played with Italy-B at the 37th Chess Olympiad in Turin, with the team winning a gold medal in their Elo category. In 2008, after completing his school studies, he decided to follow in the footsteps of Michele Godena, becoming a professional player. GM Mihail Marin became his new trainer, helping him on the road to achieving his Grandmaster title. In October 2008, Vocaturo won the Open Rhode of Sautron in France, achieving his first GM norm. His second norm came at Reykjavík in March 2009, where he played a number of beautiful games. In May, he secured his final norm at the International tournament \"Capo d'Orso\" of Palau in Sardinia. In January 2010, Vocaturo participated in the Corus Group C of the prestigious Wijk aan Zee tournament, finishing third. In May, he played on third board with the Italian team at the Mitropa Cup in Chur, Switzerland, with Italy winning this trophy for the first time, with Vocaturo achieving an Elo performance of over 2700 points. In January 2011 came Vocaturo's greatest success so far. Playing in Group C of the Tata Steel Chess Tournament, he won the tournament with 9/13, ahead of Ukrainian rising star Illya Nyzhnyk. The last round was a dramatic one. Nyzhnyk arrived at a potential winning position, but overlooked a combination by Vocaturo that allowed a perpetual check; the draw being sufficient for Vocaturo to maintain his half point lead."

  "text" : "Daisy Martin (fl. c. 1914 – c. 1925) was an African-American actress and blues singer in the classic female blues style. She toured the eastern and midwestern United States in black vaudeville in the 1910s and early 1920s. In 1914 she appeared in the revue My Friend from Kentucky at the National Theater in Chicago, Illinois. In 1917 she performed in the musical comedy My People, which also featured Sam Gray and Julia Moody. In 1920 she appeared at the Strand Theatre in Chicago in the revue Hello 1919. Martin was one of the first black women to sing blues on recordings when she recorded for the Gennett and Okeh labels in April 1921. On her first sides, \"Royal Garden Blues\" and \"Spread Yo' Stuff\", she was accompanied by the Five Jazz Bell Hops, whose identities are unknown. Her final session was in July 1923. In total she recorded 16 sides. On January 20, 1922, she competed in a blues-singing contest with Lucille Hegamin, Alice Leslie Carter and Trixie Smith (the eventual winner) at the Manhattan Casino in New York City. For this contest, which was a highlight of the Fifteenth Infantry's First Band Concert and Dance, Noble Sissle was master of ceremonies, and Fiorello la Guardia served as one of the judges. Blues writer Steve Tracy wrote in 1997 that \"Martin is really not one of the better vaudeville blues singers, possessed as she is of a soprano voice with a very stilted vibrato effect\". Few of the players who accompanied her on record have been identified, but the band at one of her sessions included Gus Aiken, Jake Frazier, and Garvin Bushell. Martin's complete recordings were reissued in CD format by Document Records in 1997 on Daisy Martin & Ozie McPherson: Complete Recorded Works 1921–1926 In Chronological Order (DODC-5522)."

  "text" : "Denis Fernand Py (1887–1949) was a French medal artist and engraver that created highly stylized medals with religious themes during his career. An example of his work is that of St. Patrick, Apostle of Ireland. Rather than depicting the typical elder man with a long beard wearing a Catholic priest chasuble and bishop's mitre carrying a shepherd's staff and pointing at snakes (or holding a sharock), Py changed up the image. In Py's version of St. Patrick, the saint's body parts are not in proportion. His right hand shows the saint extending his middle and index fingers of the right hand (as in a sign for peace or victory). The depiction continues to wear the bishop's mitre and carries the shepherd's staff. The Py St. Patrick, though wears a button down cassock and cape as one might see an Anglican bishop wear. While the Py St. Patrick does not hold a shamrock (a symbol used to teach about the Triune God), but one is placed prominently nearby on the medal. The Patrick on this medal is beardless. In one corner of the medal are towers as one might assume Patrick envisioned in Armagh. Finally, around the image is the name of St. Patrick. It is not written in the vernacular, but in Latin (as Patrick spoke). Around the image, Py wrote \"Sanctus Patricius\" with letters that do not match in size."

  "text" : "Donald Wyman (1904 — 6 December 1993) was an American horticulturist, the head of horticulture at Harvard University's Arnold Arboretum from 1935 to 1970. He took a bachelor's degree in horticulture from Pennsylvania State College (1926) and a master's in forestry (1933), then a PhD in horticulture at Cornell University (1935). He joined the Arboretum in 1935 and served for six months without salary in the depths of the Great Depression before being named horticulturist in 1936. He was the author of many books, including Wyman's Gardening Encyclopedia (1971). Wyman served as president, director, and trustee of the American Horticultural Society. At the Arnold Arboretum he departed from the original method of planting by botanical association, to mark vistas and turns with specimen trees, and was energetic in acquiring seeds of many species that he introduced to American horticulture. He retired in 1970. He received the George Robert White Medal from the Massachusetts Horticultural Society (1970), the Liberty Hyde Bailey Medal from the American Horticultural Society, the Veitch Memorial Medal from the Royal Horticultural Society (1969) and the Medal of Honor from the Garden Club of America (1965). The widely planted crabapple Malus \"Donald Wyman\" was named for him upon his retirement in 1970."

  "text" : "Deidamia or Deidameia (Greek: Δηϊδάμεια) or Laodamia (Greek: Λαοδάμεια) (died c. 233 BC) was a Greek princess, daughter of Pyrrhus II of Epirus, king of Epirus. After the death of her father and that of her uncle Ptolemy, she was the last surviving representative of the royal Aeacid dynasty in Epirus. She had a sister, Nereis, who married Gelo of Syracuse. During a rebellion in Epirus her sister sent her 800 mercenaries from Gaul. Part of the Molossians supported her, and with the aid of the mercenaries she briefly took Ambracia. The Epirotes, however, determined to secure their liberty by extirpating the whole royal family, resolved to put her to death; she fled for refuge to the temple of Artemis, but was murdered in the sanctuary itself by Milo, a man already responsible of matricide, who shortly after this crime committed suicide. The date of this event cannot be accurately fixed, but it occurred during the reign of Demetrius II in Macedonia (239–229 BC), and probably in the early part of it. Another Deidamia was a daughter of Lycomedes, king of Scyros, and mother of Pyrrhus by Achilles."

McLean was appointed manager of Bristol Rovers in 1929, but left after just over a year and returned to East Fife in 1931. McLean led them to victory over Kilmarnock in the 1938 Scottish Cup Final. Hearts appointed McLean manager on a five-year contract in June 1941. He played a significant role in rebuilding the club during the Second World War, assembling the Terrible Trio forward line of Alfie Conn, Willie Bauld and Jimmy Wardhaugh. McLean died in February 1951 after a period of illness. Tommy Walker took over as manager, enjoying a period of success that he acknowledged was partly due to the work done by McLean."

His death became controversial because his notes suggested he was in Martinsburg to meet a source about a story he called \"the Octopus.\" This centered on a sprawling collaboration involving an international cabal, and primarily featuring a number of stories familiar to journalists who worked in and near Washington, D.C. in the 1980s—the Inslaw case, about a software manufacturer whose owner accused the Justice Department of stealing its work product; the October Surprise theory that during the Iran hostage crisis, Iran deliberately held back American hostages to help Ronald Reagan win the 1980 presidential election, the collapse of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International, and Iran-Contra. Casolaro's family argued that he had been murdered; that before he left for Martinsburg, he had apparently told his brother that he had been frequently receiving harassing phone calls late at night; that some of them were threatening; and that if something were to happen to him while in Martinsburg, it would not be an accident. They also cited his well-known squeamishness and fear of blood tests, and stated they found it incomprehensible that if he were going to commit suicide, he would do so by cutting his wrists a dozen times  A number of law-enforcement officials also argued that his death deserved further scrutiny, and his notes were passed by his family to ABC News and Time Magazine, both of which investigated the case, but no evidence of murder was ever found."

He initially managed the York White Roses in 1936, but was replaced. He then took over as manager of the Johnstown Johnnies. He managed the Duluth Dukes from 1937 to 1939, leading them to league championship victories the first two years and a playoff berth in the last. In 1940, he managed the Sunbury Indians and, for part of the season, the Cooleemee Cards. In 1941 and 1942, Dorman led the Hagerstown Owls, leading them to the playoffs both years - and to the league finals in the latter season, though they lost the series. Dorman managed the Wilmington Blue Rocks in 1943 and 1944, leading them to the playoffs in his first season with the team and being replaced partway through the second. In 1945, he returned to the Hagerstown Owls, replacing their manager partway through the year. He managed the Hartford Bees in 1946 and the Hartford Chiefs in 1947, leading the Bees to the league finals, which they lost. He managed the Pawtucket Slaters for part of the 1949 season and the Hagerstown Braves from 1950 to 1953. He led them to a league championship victory in 1952, to the league finals in 1950 and to a playoff berth in 1951. He managed for three teams over the final two seasons of his career - the Allentown Cardinals in 1954 and the Waterloo White Hawks and Sunbury Red Legs in 1955."

He was sponsored by Santa Cruz Snowboards by the age of 15 and traveling the country riding the national dryslope tour. When leaving school at the age of 17 Wakeham spent his first season in Flaine, France where he worked as a shaper in the snowboard park. In 2003 a decision was made to join the GB team and set his target to compete in the 2006 Winter Olympics. In 2004 Wakeham signed a pro deal Nike ACG. In 2006 Wakeham was the first British male to compete in Olympic snowboarding in Turin, Italy. With the credit crunch hitting hard, funding got cut and life on the World Cup Tour wasn't easy. The national governing body for snow sports (Snowsports GB) fell into administration shortly before the Olympics in Vancouver. Wakeham made the decision to retire. After a long snowboard career with a host of big athlete brand endorsement contracts under his belt Dan was able to easily walk in to various work roles within a host of action sport brands.Here is his Linkedin profile and website Dan Wakeham: The factsStarted snowboarding at: 14 year-oldBest world ranking: 28th (2007/2008)Best World Cup Finish: 5th Leysin, Switzerland, Halfpipe – January 2006Olympic starts: 1World Championships: 2World Cup starts: 32Europa Cup starts: 6Europa Cup victories: 2Europa Cup Halfpipe Champion season 2004/2005 (First ever Brit in either Ski or Board to achieve this feat)"

Using a standard script, Newland personalized each film according to its location – Belvidere's Hero, Staunton's Hero, Janesville's Hero, Huntingdon's Hero, Tyrone's Hero, Wilmington's Hero, and so on. Newland was born June 8, 1896, in Battle Creek, Michigan, the son of Dr. J.S. Newland and the former Josephine Roche. He enlisted in the United States Army on Aug 28, 1918, in Chicago, Illinois and was assigned to 4th Company, Development Battalion No. 1. He spent less than five months in the military, being discharged at Camp Wadsworth, S.C., on Jan 9, 1919, as part of the country's general demobilization after World War I."

  "text" : "(In this Vietnamese name, the family name is Dinh. According to Vietnamese custom, this person should properly be referred to by the given name Than.) Gilbert Đinh Văn Thân, more commonly known as Đinh Văn Thân, is a ni-Vanuatu \"prominent businessman\" and former politician. Ron Crocombe described him in 2007 as \"perhaps the wealthiest entrepreneur and largest private employer in Vanuatu and many say the most politically influential [...] citizen\". Thân is a naturalised citizen of Vanuatu. The Vanuatu Daily Post describes him as \"a ni-Vanuatu of Vietnamese parentage\". His father began his work in Vanuatu as an \"indentured labourer\". The Dinh family have been described as long-standing supporters of the Vanua'aku Pati. In 1991, when the party was about to split, Thân supported its founder and then-leader, the first Prime Minister of Vanuatu, Walter Lini. Thân hosted meetings of Lini and his supporters, and enabled Lini to set up \"headquarters\" on the premises of one of the companies he owned. Later that year, when Lini was ousted from the leadership of the Vanua'aku Pati, and founded the National United Party, Thân was a prominent member. The relationship between the two men was close; Thân was literally adopted into Lini's family the same year. Vanua'aku Pati \"campaign materials\" responded to the split by accusing the NUP of serving Thân's interests, and described Thân as \"the owner, financier, host, organiser, director\" of the new party. Academic Howard Van Trease suggests it was Thân who advised Lini to create the National United Party, and subsequently to enter into a coalition government with the Union of Moderate Parties. Than was also a major provider of funds to the party. Thân obtained the leadership of the NUP in 1999, and led it into the May 2002 general election. In 2003, he was \"ousted\" and replaced as party leader by Ham Lini, Walter Lini's brother, who later became Prime Minister. He responded by leaving the NUP and founding the Vanuatu National Party in 2004. The latter's stated aim was to \"revive\" the \"principles\" espoused by Walter Lini. Specifically, the party emphasised \"the need to develop rural employment opportunities, provide confidence to business and invest in primary industries\". It called for a partnership between churches and government in providing health and education services; called for a development of \"effective national telecommunications\" across the country; and suggested that key positions such as that of the Ombudsman or Chief Justice be conferred upon foreign nationals, while also pledging to review the granting of citizenship to foreigners and -despite Than himself being a businessman of Vietnamese origin- to \"restrict Asian businesses from operating beyond the municipal boundary\" of urban areas. Than stood unsuccessfully for Parliament as leader of the VNP in the July 2004 general election. His brother, Dominique Dinh, a customary chief on the island of Tanna, left the NUP at the same time as he did, and went on to found the Chiefs' Movement of Vanuatu four years later. His sister, Thitam Goiset, is also involved in customary politics, being reportedly the \"president\" of the Nagriamel movement before her appointment as Vanuatu's ambassador to Russia in December 2011. On 16 December 2000, the headline story of the Vanuatu Weekly Hebdomadaire highlighted Than's \"growing generosity\", as he planned to \"invest about 500 million vatu\" in creating a residential area in Tagabe. In the 2000s (decade), Than was a member of Vanuatu's Citizenship Commission, tasked with granting or denying citizenship applications from immigrants. Than accused the Commission's Secretary, Képoué Manwo, of falsely informing the Commission's president that certain applications, notably from Chinese businessmen, had been approved by the Commission, when they had in fact been rejected. In 2007, Vanuatu's department of forests accused Than of \"logging without a licence, not paying logging fees or forest management charges, breaking the code of logging practice, and causing high safety risks to workers, the public and the environment\". As of January 2011, Than \"owns over ten companies\". He once owned Doveair, a domestic airline company which was \"closed following the disastrous Port Vila Land riots in 1988\". The following year, riots also forced the closure of a meat factory he owned in Port Vila.In January 2011, it was reported Than planned to launch a domestic airline, Vanuatu Airways. It would provide cheaper fares on domestic flights than Air Vanuatu."

Wachs is a board certified family physician who started a radio show to allow callers to receive free medical advice on the air during the recession in early 2009 on KLAV in Las Vegas, Nevada. The show was picked up by KDWN in Las Vegas later that month and by KFNX in Phoenix, Arizona by late 2009. In April 2010 The Dr. Daliah Show began airing on WZFG in Fargo, North Dakota. Within two years of her premiere on air, her show expanded to several cities, and XM Satellite began airing her show nationally in January 2011 on America's Talk Channel 158, and soon thereafter Channel 166.In 2016 she was offered a faculty position at Touro University Medical School. Wachs was named by Talkers Magazine as one of America's 250 Most Influential Hosts. In September 2011, Genesis Communications Network chose to nationally syndicate her show. Her show is currently produced by Tom Sherman, Don Simon, and Justin Sehorn. By 2013 her show was broadcast by iHeart Radio. The \"Doctor Daliah\" program covers a wide array of medical topics as well as current events that involve health. Wachs's approach has been hailed as entertaining and straightforward without medical jargon. Wachs has made numerous television and radio interviews and gives lectures throughout the country. She is involved with several charities , particularly FAST4Kids (Finding Autistic Solutions for Tomorrow) due to her having two family members with autism. In 2015 Dr. Daliah helped create, in response to blood bank shortages, Nevada Blood Donation Day. In 2016 she took the campaign nationally, helping create Blood Donation Days in multiple states, National Blood Donation Day and National Blood Donation Week, working with United Blood Services, American Red Cross and blood banks throughout the United States."

  "text" : "Donal \"Donald\" O'Brien (September 15, 1930) is a French-born Irish film and television actor. In his near 40-year career, O'Brien appeared in dozens of stage performances and in more than 60 film and television productions. O'Brien was born in Pau, Pyrénées-Atlantiques, raised in both Northern France and Dublin, Ireland with his family, and made his feature film debut in 1953 with Anatole Litvak's war drama Act of Love. He studied acting in Dublin and initially joined the Gate Theatre at age 19 before making the transition to film several years later. O'Brien's performance in The Train (1964), in which he played an SS Feldwebel, led to his first breakout role in Grand Prix (1966) starring alongside James Garner and Eva Marie Saint. He was particularly known for his performances in the Spaghetti Western genre of the late-1960s and 70s, with memorable roles in Run, Man, Run (1968), Four of the Apocalypse (1975), Keoma (1976), Mannaja (1977) and Silver Saddle (1978), as well as later appearances in Italian horror, post-apocalyptic, and zombie films. In 1980, O'Brien suffered a head injury which left him in a coma for three days and partially paralyzed. Though eventually recovering from his injuries, his mobility was significantly limited for the rest of his life. In spite of this, O'Brien continued to work for another decade in the Italian film industry, almost exclusively for directors Lucio Fulci and Joe D'Amato. His last years included supporting roles in The Name of the Rose (1986) and The Devil's Daughter (1991)."

  "text" : "David Andrew Smith (born 1982 at Katoomba, New South Wales, Australia) is an Australian chef, hospitality consultant, and producer of gourmet food products. Starting as a kitchenhand at the age of 14, Smith was keen to become a chef. He spent many years in kitchens in small cafés and restaurants, and managing club catering operations. In August 2004 he started at Mash Café & Restaurant as the head chef in Glenbrook, New South Wales, where he finally had a chance to grow and show off his skills and ideas. Mash Café & Restaurant served upmarket breakfasts and lunches, and contemporary fine dining for dinner. Within the first year of trading, Mash received 'New Restaurant of the year' from the NSW Restaurant & Catering associations VISA International Awards for Excellence. Soon afterwards followed a very positive review in the Sydney Eats Guide. The following year Mash received a review in the Sydney Morning Herald's Good Living Section and later in the year reviews in the Sydney Eats Guide and the influential Sydney Morning Herald Good Food Guide; the editor, Simon Thomsen, said in the review that \"Mash gives new meaning to soul food\". The following year also saw Mash getting reviews with the Sydney Eats Guide and the Sydney Morning Herald Good Food Guide. In July 2008 Smith started at Glenella in Blackheath as the head chef. Glenella has operated as a guesthouse and restaurant since 1905. It was made famous between 1973 and 1989 by Michael and Monique Manners. The restaurant was considered by many as the pinnacle of regional dining. David arrived at Glenella after the restaurant hadn't been operating for a number of years. The rooms and restaurant were renovated, and the famous restaurant was reborn. Their first review was in the Sydney Morning Herald's Traveller section saying \"The piece de resistance of the modern-day Glenella, as with the original in the 1970s, is the quality of the food. The restaurant, under chef David Smith, who has made his way up the mountain from Mash Cafe and Restaurant at Glenbrook, has a small and simple menu comprising four entrees ($16), five mains including some outstanding rabbit and duck (all $32) and four desserts ($15), as well as a cheese platter. An application for a wine-bar license has been approved, so non-diners will soon be able to enjoy a drink\". In September 2009, when the Sydney Morning Herald Good Food Guide was released, Glenella received a very positive review, setting them in line to grow on to better things. Unfortunately, even after these reviews and the business that they brought with them, the goal of the restaurant changed and in April 2010 Smith left Glenella. Shortly after this, it was reported in the Sydney Morning Herald's Good Living section titled \"A Surry state of affairs for Smith\" that Smith was working on his new hospitality business, Oz Hospitality Consultants, and was looking at starting work as the executive chef for a new Italian restaurant in Surry Hills, Sydney. At this stage, Smith focused on his consulting business, which offers Australia-wide hospitality consulting services, rather than returning to running a kitchen. In December 2010, Smith, with his partner Elizabeth Sgroi, opened their second business, Handsome Drake Fine Foods. Located in the Blue Mountains, New South Wales, they specialise in quality jams, relishes, chutneys, organic biscotti, organic lavosh, flavoured oils, curry pastes, organic pasta, pasta sauces, preserved vegetables, and muesli. Smith commented that he was looking into the opportunity to open a shop and cafe or a restaurant some time in the next two years."

He resided in Slovenia, beginning in 1987, but shortly thereafter and without warning found himself among the victims of administrative ethnic cleansing (\"Erased\"), the result of secret illegal action enacted 26 February 1992 by the democratic Slovenian government one year after the disintegration of the state of Yugoslavia. For 10 years Anakiev was compelled to live without personal documents (such as passport or personal identification), rendering him an invisible prisoner of the Slovenian democracy. At this point he purchased a small video camera and began his film career, in an attempt to make himself and other marginal Balkan people visible. The success of his films (including winning the Slovenian national film award) has made it possible for Anakiev to continue filmmaking as a producer, director and writer. His company, Dimitar Anakiev Films s.p.-DAF (now Anakiev Production) specializes in socially engaged films of the Balkans in the post-communist era. Anakiev is a founding member of the Slovenian Director Guild, and a member of the Slovenian Filmmaker Association."

In 1994, he developed a film and media directory Web site, CineMedia, which in 1997 was nominated in the \"Film and Television\" category for the 1st Annual Webby Awards. In 1995, Harries moved back to Los Angeles to take up the position of the American Film Institute's first Director of Online Media where his team worked on a number of online projects, including the 1996 launch of the world's first streaming video site devoted to classic Hollywood movies. The first movie to be streamed was Charlie Chaplin's silent 1916 classic, \"The Rink.\" In 1998, Harries moved to London where he was head of the Visual Culture and Media Department at Middlesex University until 2003. Harries has a B.A in sociology from UCLA, an MA in Film Studies from the University of East Anglia, and a PhD from UCLA in Film & Television.

  "text" : "Demid Ilyich Kulikalov was an administrator of Russian America during the first decade of the 19th century. He served in the Russian-American Company for several decades, led early expeditions into what is now Alaska, administered RAC interests in the Pribilof Islands, and headed the Russian-American Company's Atka station. Kulikalov's origins with the Russian-American Company are unclear. In 1794, he was the co-leader of the first Russian expedition from Kodiak Island to explore Yakutat Bay, a hunting expedition that covered much of the southern coast of Alaska and included more than 1,000 natives and Russians. In 1805, Kulikalov ordered to head the RAC's organization in the Andreanof Islands. Before he departed the RAC's base of operations in Unalaska, however, he was flogged on the orders of Nikolai Rezanov for alleged cruelty to an Aleut woman and her child and was expelled from Russian America in chains. Kuliakalov was a trusted assistant to Russian America governor Alexander Baranov, and either returned to the colony or was never transported out (sources are unclear). Kuliakalov was put in charge of establishing a colony on St. Matthew Island in 1809 and returned to Unalaska in 1810. That year, Kulikalov unsuccessfully sought to have an illegitimate child (born through a partnership with an Aleut woman) sent to Russia for education. The reason given was that Kulikalov \"had legitimate children in Irkutsk.\" Ten years later, Baranov's intervention secured son a trip to St. Petersburg, and he later returned to Russian America."

In 2013, he resigned as Chairman of the Yesha Council to endorse Benjamin Netanyahu for Prime Minister. Dayan was subsequently appointed as Chief Foreign Envoy  of the Yesha Council, as the only official representative of the Israeli settlement movement to the international community. After a diplomatic stand-off over its assignment of former settler leader Dayan as ambassador to Brazil without consulting the government of Brasilia, Israel backed off and in March 2016 assigned Dayan as Consul General of Israel in New York. Described by the New York Times as “worldly and pragmatic” and \"the most effective leader the settlers have had.\" Dayan is perceived by many to be the face of the Israeli settlement movement to the international community. His writing appears in many publications, including The New York Times, The Los Angeles Times, The Boston Globe, USA Today, The Guardian, Haaretz, The Times of Israel and The Jerusalem Post."

  "text" : "Domna Anisimovna Anisimova (Russian: До́мна Ани́симовна Ани́симова; IPA: [ˈdomnə ɐˈnʲisʲɪməvnə ɐˈnʲisʲɪməvə] ; birth and death dates uncertain), known as Blind Domna, was a blind and illiterate but accomplished 19th-century Russian poet. Her last name is also sometimes given as Onisimova (Russian: Онисимова). Anisimova was born in the village of Degtyanom in the Spassky District of Ryazan Province, the daughter of a sexton in the local village Orthodox church. According to one source she was born in 1808, according to another source in 1812. At the age of five Anisimova was stricken with smallpox, which left her nearly blind; she could only distinguish day from night and dark colors from bright. Her blindness alienated her from normal society. She loved solitude and old stories about the past, as well as being read books, and worship. From an early age she loved to be read to, but at first had no cause to hear works except church books, sermons, ancient stories, and fairy tales. But when a new young priest, Sergei Ivanov, was assigned to her village, he became friendly with Anisimova and began to read some later works, especially the work of contemporary poets. She was read \"Twelve Sleeping Virgins\" by Vasily Zhukovsky; this ballad made such an impression on her that she was deprived of sleep and was inspired with a great desire to compose poetry, which she soon began to do, dictating poems to her brother. Her first experiments were \"Lullaby\" and \"Sound of the Night Wind\". Donma tried to hide her creations, but they came to the attention of the county police chief, who asked Anisimova to expound on the village harvests. One night she composed a rather long poem, \"Depiction of the Harvest\". Rumors about Anisimova's work spread throughout the Spassky district and came to the attention of the provincial governor, who informed Dmitry Bludov, the Minister of Internal Affairs and later president of the St. Petersburg Academy of Sciences, who was a man with a considerable interest in and knowledge of literature. Bludov sent some of Anisimova's work to Admiral Alexander Shishkov, the president of the Russian Academy and a philologist and literary critic. The Academy decided to encourage Anisimova and sent her one hundred rubles and some books (Heinrich Zschokke's Hours of Devotion, Nikolay Karamzin's 12-volume History of the Russian State, and others), published an edition of her poems, and arranged for her to be given disability subsidy of 40 rubles a month for her blindness, which she was to receive for the rest of her life. The collection of poems published by the Academy under the title Poems by Miss Onisimova, the Blind Daughter of a Village Sexton (St. Petersburg, 1838) included \"Sound of the Night Wind\", \"On the Death of a Friend\", \"Lullaby\", \"On the Birth of a Child\", \"To a Faded Flower\", \"Greeting\", and \"Depiction of the Harvest\", and prefaces by Bludov and Shishkov. About fifteen of her poems were published in the Ryazan Diocesan Gazette, and some of her poems were published in the literary newspaper Northern Bee. Little information on the last years of her life has survived, and her death date is unknown."

  "text" : "Douglas Leopold, nicknamed Coco, was a television and radio personality in Quebec, along with being a public relations specialist. Douglas Leopold studied political science and music at McGill University and the Sorbonne. Upon his return to Montreal, Leopold first worked in public relations for the Saidye Bronfman Centre for the Arts (now the Segal Centre for Performing Arts) and Les Grands Ballets Canadiens. His professional introduction to disco came in promoting the Montreal branch of Régine (an international chain of discotheques presided over by Régine Zylberberg). This in turn led to a radio show with CKMF-FM, an association which lasted from 1979 to 1988. He then moved to Los Angeles to work in public relations for Universal Studios Theme Parks. Leopold was openly gay and earned the nickname Coco because he peppered his speech with this expression, as a form of punctuation. He appeared as \"Coco\" in Scandale (1982) and made many appearances on local television, identifying and commenting on new trends in fashion and lifestyles. Leopold's key concept was the jet set, which he did not identify simply with money or extravagance, but rather a certain conception of good taste and appropriate conduct. Leopold was sued by Alain Montpetit, another Montreal media personality (and like Leopold, also worked at CKMF), when he accused him on air of the murder of a model. This led to the payment of a settlement of thirty thousand dollars to Montpetit. Two decades later, the case was reopened by the New York City Police, who received statements from a number of witnesses which linked Montpetit to the murder. These included a confession, from the woman who had provided Montpetit's alibi, that she had lied about Montpetit being with her. Leopold did not smoke, drink or take drugs. Although a few months before his death Leopold continued to claim publicly that he was in perfect health and did not have AIDS, he died due to this illness on 6 April 1993, at the Chris Brownlie Hospice in Los Angeles. A fictionalised version of Leopold, played by Paul Doucet, is one of the central characters in the 2010 Canadian film Funkytown. Steve Galluccio, the scriptwriter for the film, had in fact once been interviewed by Leopold to be his assistant."

He became a teacher in 1852, and for some time kept a school at Elgin, Moray. In 1861 he was appointed French master in Oundle grammar school, Northamptonshire. In 1865 he became assistant master of Eccleshall College, a private school near Sheffield. Subsequently he purchased a day school in Sheffield, which proved a failure, and in 1880 he had to retire from his charge penniless. From that date till his death in 1886 he acted as a private tutor in Edinburgh. He published 'Metrical Tales' at Sheffield in 1880, and 'Lays and Legends of the North' at Edinburgh in 1884. 'A Book of Ten Songs,' with music, with a preface by Professor Blackie, appeared after his death. His poems evince a sense of humour, and he had considerable narrative power in verse."

The exception is the release of the soundtrack of the film Chrysalis (later named Battled Apocalypse) (2014), a score by Darren Callahan. In 2012, he wrote, directed, and composed the score for Glass City Films' production of Under the Table, a horror movie. In 2014, his play Desperate Dolls was produced and caused a significant controversy due to the violent and sexual content. In 2015, he produced the film Chat Room, directed by Emily Bennett. That year also saw the re-release of 1993's debut album from his pop band, OO OO WA, entitled Screen Kiss, as well as the release by Trouble Press of a collection of 31 fiction and non-fiction pieces, entitled Twin Cinema."

He was a captain of dragoons in the Derbyshire cavalry. He was living in Burton in 1649, when he was appointed a J.P. for the county, and he acquired Nether Hall where he was probably living by at least 1656. In 1659, Watson was elected Member of Parliament for Lichfield in the Third Protectorate Parliament. He sat in the corporation interest. In 1660, he was elected MP for Lichfield in the Convention Parliament, but was unseated on petition in favour of Thomas Minors on 27 June 1660. He was recorder of Newcastle-under-Lyme from 1660. The house he occupied in Burton in 1666 (presumably Nether Hall) was one of the largest in the town, being assessed for tax on eight hearths."

  "text" : "Dugald Campbell Patterson Sr., (January 2, 1860 – June 25, 1931) is recognized in Vancouver, Burnaby, and New Westminster, British Columbia as a significant pioneer. He arrived in Canada on July 1, 1884 and engaged in the building trade while living in Victoria. In 1894 he moved to Burnaby where he acquired a five-acre parcel of land which today forms the north east section of Central Park. Patterson worked as an engineer for Armstrong Morrison & Balfour and later became foreman boilermaker for the Vancouver Engineering Works. He founded Vulcan Iron Works of New Westminster in 1903, was the first postmaster of the Edmonds district in 1909 and was a member of the New Westminster Board of Trade in 1911. He was elected a Burnaby school trustee in 1912, was a director of the British Columbia Electric and Water Heat Company and owned and operated a real estate business where he purchased and developed properties as far away as Barkerville. He also founded and operated an insurance company for many years. Patterson Avenue, which he originally cleared as a trail, and Patterson Station, where he built the original interurban stop along the British Columbia Electric Railway, are named for the family. Patterson was born in Partick, Lanarkshire, Scotland on January 2, 1860. He was one of three sons born to John Murdoch Paterson of Rutherglen, and Margaret (Purdon) Paterson of Partick. He attended the Glasgow common school, and worked as a ship joiner at Barclay Curle & Company (founded in 1818) in Whiteinch, Scotland. He was later employed in the Anchor Line Shipyards (founded in 1856) in Partick. After his arrival in Canada, he added a second \"t\" to the spelling of his last name which changed it from \"Paterson\" to \"Patterson\". On February 7, 1891 in Victoria, British Columbia, he married Frances Mabel Webb, a granddaughter of Thomas Webb, founder of Thomas Webb & Sons makers of fine English glass. Together, Dugald and Frances Patterson raised seven children. In 1915, during World War I, Patterson accepted a commission by the British government to travel overseas to supervise a group of Canadians in the construction of submarines for the Royal Navy on the River Clyde near Glasgow, Scotland. It was here that he sustained an injury which left him in a wheelchair for the rest of his life. Upon his return home, he remained active in both municipal affairs and the arts. He developed a plan that would preserve ravines as parks in Burnaby, and he published a book of poetry prior to his death in Vancouver in 1931. The family home, known today as Dugald and Frances Patterson House, has been a heritage landmark in Burnaby since 1994, and is listed on the \"Canada's Historic Places\" website. Other notable Patterson family members include William Harold Patterson, a son who was a First World War veteran and captain in the Canadian Army, and Doreen Patterson Reitsma, a Canadian naval pioneer who was a granddaughter of Dugald Campbell Patterson."

  "text" : "Dmitry Grigoryevich Glinka (Russian: Дмитрий Григорьевич Глинка) (July 28, 1808 - May 14, 1883, Lisbon) was a Russian diplomat, privy councillor in deed, and sociologist. Dmitry Glinka graduated from the boarding school of Saint Petersburg University in 1824. On January 17, 1825, he joined the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and began his diplomatic career, holding posts such as second secretary at the Russian embassy in Copenhagen (since May, 1831), chief secretary in Stockholm (since March, 1837), and then counsellor in Berlin (since July, 1846). While in Stockholm, Dmitry Glinka served as charge d'affairs from May 22, 1841 until March 14, 1844. He was promoted to the rank of state councillor on March 25, 1844. Some six years later Dmitry Glinka was appointed charge d'affairs at the House of Hesse-Darmstadt, House of Hesse-Kassel, and House of Nassau. On April 8, 1851, he was promoted to state councillor in deed. In 1853, Dmitry Glinka was dispatched to Frankfurt am Main, where he would develop a rapport with Otto von Bismarck. Being a supporter of an alliance between Russia, France and Prussia, Dmitry Glinka was trying to impede the anti-Russian policy of Otto Theodor von Manteuffel, a Prussian foreign minister. On June 8, 1853, he was dismissed as charge d'affairs at the House of Hesse and then three years later appointed envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary to Brazil, becoming privy councillor in April 1863. In 1871, Dmitry Glinka was transferred to Lisbon to act as envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary, remaining on this post until his death. On April 12, 1881, he was promoted to privy councillor in deed. Dmitry Glinka was awarded the Order of Saint Stanislaus, 1st class (1855), Order of St. Anna, 1st class (1860), Order of St. Vladimir, 2nd class (1866), and Order of the White Eagle (1875). He is the author of Esquisse d'une théorie du droit naturel (Berlin, 1835) and La philosophie du droit ou explication des rapports sociaux (Paris, 1842).

  "text" : "Daniel Gunn (1774-1848), was a Scottish congregational minister. Gunn was born at Wick in Caithness in 1774,the son of Ingram Gunn, and his wife Elizabeth Miller(or Millar). He was educated at the high school, Edinburgh, and trained for the ministry by Greville Ewing at Glasgow. In 1800 he was sent to be an itinerant minister in Ireland, where he is known to have preached in Waterford and to have assisted J Kelly in Dublin. He may have married, and been widowed, while living in Ireland. In 1807, as a consequence of the unrest in Ireland he moved to Ilfracombe in Devon, where he married Catherine Vye in 1808. In 1810 he became pastor of a small congregation there. He removed in 1813 to Bishop's Hull, near Taunton, and in 1814 to Chard. Catherine died there in 1815 and was buried in the graveyard beside the chapel. In 1816 he married his third wife, Elizabeth Tice, and moved to Christchurch (then Hampshire, now Dorset). His younger brother, John Gunn, replaced him as minister at Chard. John's descendants include Battiscombe Gunn and his son J. B. Gunn. In Christchurch he found a scanty congregation, partly consisting of baptists. He promptly preached a sermon which, as he afterwards said, 'converted all the sensible baptists in the place,' and his congregation soon grew till it numbered a thousand, an extraordinary fact, considering that the whole population of Christchurch and the district within five or six miles was only about 2,500. Yet his preaching was entirely unemotional; no one was allowed to preach emotional religion in his pulpit, and the laymen whom he used to despatch into the neighbouring villages were strictly enjoined to abstain from adding anything to the printed discourses with which he provided them. His Sunday school, which was attended by upwards of four hundred children, attained a very high reputation, and attracted visitors from all parts of the country, even from America. He was almost equally successful in maintaining a day school which he established, and regulated with military precision. Ann Taylor (poet),who met him at Ilfracombe, tells of his laboriously teaching a lad how to hand a chair; he would pitilessly call back a little boy on an unmanageable pony to make him take off his hat to Mrs. Gunn if he had omitted to do so. Yet his personal influence was extraordinary. Even in the matter of subscriptions his will was law; if the collection on Sunday was not what he considered sufficient, he would put in a five-pound note, and send the plates round again. Ann Taylor's enthusiasm for 'the noble highlander' seems to have been shared by all who met him. He was three times married, and lived like a country gentleman at Burton, near Christchurch. He died at Burton on 17 June 1848, in the seventy-fifth year of his age. Daniel had six children: two sons by Catherine Vye (Daniel, 1811 - 1890, and an unnamed son born and died in 1813) and two sons and two daughters by Elizabeth Tice (Eliza, 1818 - 1838, Malachi, 1820 - 1867, William, born and died 1822, Mary, 1825 - 1911)"

  "text" : "Sir David Guthrie (fl. 1479), was lord treasurer of Scotland in 1461. Guthrie was the son of Alexander Guthrie of Kincaldrum. From 25 March 1466, when David Guthrie recovered the barony and estates of Guthrie granted to his family by David II but afterwards sold, his full title was Sir David Guthrie of Guthrie and Kincaldrum. In 1457 he was sheriff of Forfarshire. From his youth he was bred up about the court, and became armour-bearer to James II, afterwards rising high in favour with James III. During James III's minority Guthrie was made lord treasurer (in 1461) by the queen-mother. On 15 October 1466 Sir David Guthrie became comptroller of the household. In March 1467 he again appears in the official deeds as treasurer, and in November as comptroller, his name occurring in the royal charters for 1468 in the same position as when treasurer, but without the designation, the probability being that he continued to hold both posts. On 10 August 1468 Sir David Guthrie appears as clerk of the register, and the next year, owing to a change in the ministry, was made master of the rolls, his name again appearing as comptroller in November 1470. In April 1472 he went as one of the Scottish plenipotentiaries to meet the English commissioners at Newcastle, where a truce to last from 20 April 1472 till July 1483 was concluded. He was appointed lord chief justice of Scotland in 1473; the last official mention of his name is as justiciary in 1474, but he certainly survived till 1479. 'In the time of his greatness he much enlarged his estate', and founded and endowed a collegiate church at Guthrie for a provost and three prebends (increased by his eldest son to eight), and confirmed by a bull from Sixtus IV, dated at Rome 14 June 1479. Sir David Guthrie married twice, first a daughter of Sir Thomas Maule of Panmure, and secondly one of the Dundases. His eldest son, Alexander Guthrie, a grandson, three sons-in-law, and a nephew were all slain at Battle of Flodden, 1513."

  "text" : "Douglas F. Parkhill is a Canadian technologist and former research minister, best known for his pioneering work on what is now called cloud computing, and his work on Canada's Telidon videotex project. He started working at the Canadian ministry of Communications (now part of the Department of Trade and Industry) in 1969, having previously worked at the Mitre Corporation. He was responsible for many activities in communications satellites, computer communications, command and control systems and telecommunications. He was winner of the Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat's Outstanding Achievement award in 1982, the Conestoga shield for services to government and industry in computer communications research and development, the Touche Ross award for Telidon development. He was an author of several publications  including the 1966 book, The Challenge of the Computer Utility. In the book, Parkhill thoroughly explored many of the modern-day characteristics of cloud computing (elastic provisioning through a utility service) as well as the comparison to the electricity industry and the use of public, private, government and community forms. The book won the McKinsey Foundation award for distinguished contributions to management literature. He worked with Dave Godfrey, the Canadian writer and novelist on a later book Gutenberg two about the social and political meaning of computer technology. He was in charge of research at the Federal Department of Communications at the time when the department was funding development of the Telidon videotext system, was heavily involved in promoting the system, and had overall control of the program. In a radio broadcast in 1980, he outlined some of the potential of the system, from financial information, to theatre reservations, with the ability to pay and print out tickets from the system. He later documented the history of the Telidon project, and the history of videotex in general."

She is the Managing Director of AJ+, an award-winning digital news service in English, Arabic and Spanish launched by Al Jazeera Media Network in San Francisco, USA. She is currently the only female executive director within the Al Jazeera group and one of few female leaders in the Arab media sphere. Dima was born in Damascus to a Syrian mother and a Palestinian father. Khatib speaks eight languages (Arabic, English, French, Spanish, Portuguese, Italian, Chinese, German). She joined Al Jazeera back in 1997 as a junior intern in broadcast journalism to become a producer, correspondent in China and then Latin America Bureau Chief before making a total shift to internet journalism in recent years. Dima has been classified among the most influential Arabs on Social Media       She received attention during Arab revolutions for providing frequent updates and commentary about recent events via her Twitter account. Today she tackles all kinds of issues on her social feeds, including social media, media, motherhood, poetry, Palestine and others. She started earning recognition during the Iraq War, when she worked as a live news producer in Doha for Al Jazeera Arabic Channel. She gave an interview to CNN's Larry King and Wolf Blitzer, and was featured in Control Room, a 2004 documentary film about Al Jazeera and its coverage of the 2003 invasion of Iraq. During her assignment in Latin America she had exclusive and close access to the late Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez  and interviewed several leaders such as Bolivia's Evo Morales and Brazil's Lula da Silva. Reporting from all over South and Central America she gave the Arab World an unprecedented insight into a far-away continent. From Caracas she would be cited as the source of breaking news such as Chávez being the first head of state to harshly condemn Israel over the Israeli-Lebanon conflict  and cutting ties with Israel years later. She also dismissed the claims that Gaddafi has escaped to Venezuela. Dima has one published collection of poems in Arabic entitled Love Refugee (Arabic: لاجئة حب‎‎), available on Jamalon. Dima has also co-authored one book in Spanish about Arab Revolutions. She lectured journalism at the American University in Dubai (AUD) between 2013-2015 and gives talks around the globe. She organises regular poetry recitals in cities across the Gulf region, as well as Europe and both North and Latin America. Prior to her work with Al Jazeera, Khatib has worked for Swiss Radio International in Bern and World Health Organisation in Geneva, as well as Al-Raya Newspaper and Qatar Radio in French in Doha."

  "text" : "Diana Napier (31 January 1905 – 12 March 1982) was an English film actress. She was born Alice Mary Ellis in Bath, Somerset and died in Windlesham, Surrey, aged 77. Napier, known to her family as \"Mollie\", was married three times. Her first husband was the actor G.H. Mulcaster whom she married in 1927 and later divorced. Her second was the Austrian tenor, Richard Tauber (1891–1948), to whom she was married from 1936 until his death, and her third was the Polish artist, Stanislaw Wolkowicki (1902-1965), whom she had met during the war [when she worked for the Polish Red Cross] and married in 1953. He died in 1965, and she was buried with him in the Churchyard of St Michael and All Angels, Sunningdale, Berkshire in 1982. Napier was the daughter of Major APB Ellis, an ENT specialist and sometime army surgeon, and Alice Napier. She took her mother's maiden name as her screen name. Having spent much of her childhood in South Africa, where she attended the Maris Stella School in Durban, the family returned to England and she embarked on a stage career. After a few years in repertory, she was offered a screen test by Alexander Korda, and made a few films before he dropped her. She then appeared in 1935 opposite Douglas Fairbanks, Jr. in Mimi, a film directed by Paul L. Stein, a childhood friend of Richard Tauber, who had directed Tauber's first British film Blossom Time in 1934. It was through Paul Stein she met Tauber, and appeared with him in three films made in 1935/36, the first of them, Heart's Desire, under Stein's direction. For five years, 1935 until 1940, she rented the Villa Capri at Elstree, where she lived with Tauber from the time of their marriage. In April 1940 she joined the First Aid Nursing Yeomanry, and after basic training joined an Ambulance Unit in Scotland, where she cared for Polish Soldiers, eventually becoming an NCO in a Polish unit. She later joined the Polish Welfare Unit in London, early in 1945 she travelled to Holland with the Red Cross to care for Polish soldiers escaping from Germany, and after VE Day moved to Meppen in Germany, receiving a high commendation from General Clemens Rudnicki for her work on behalf of Polish Servicemen. [Details in her book 'My Heart and I', London, 1959, pages 155-177] Shortly before Tauber's death, she set up an artists studio in Beauchamp Place, which became the design and display company Diana Display Ltd. (later DNT Associates) based in Parsons Green, Fulham, London. She published a biography of her husband in 1949, a volume of autobiography (My Heart and I, 1959), and collaborated with Charles Castle on This was Richard Tauber, a book and a film issued in 1971 to mark what would have been Tauber's 80th birthday."

  "text" : "Denis Colin is a French bass clarinettist and composer, born in Vanves, 24 July 1956. After studying clarinet at the conservatoire in Versailles, he turned to jazz, making appearances with Steve Lacy, François Cotinaud and Alan Silva. He was in charge of the IACP (Institute for Artistic and Cultural Perception) from 1979 to 1982 and taught jazz at the Montreuil sous bois conservatoire. Among the musicians he has played with are: Celestrial Communication Orchestra, Texture (with saxophonist François Cotinaud), Bekummernis (led by Luc Le Masne), François Tusques and Archie Shepp. He has written music for the theatre (for the Cie Tuchenn) and cinema (for Florence Miailhe). In 1991, he formed a trio with Didier Petit (cello) and Pablo Cueco (zarb) to explore world music and free jazz. The trio expanded in 1995, adding Bruno Girard or Régis Huby (violin) and Camel Zekri (guitar) to form the group Les Arpenteurs. In 2000, Denis Colin was commissioned by Radio France to create \"Dans les cordes\", a piece for ten musicians. In 2001, the trio reconstituted itself again around Afro-American music, with musicians from the Minneapolis scene, for the album Something in Common. This adventure continued in 2005 with singer Gwen Matthews, who was featured on a second American album. Colin emerged again in 2008 with a younger, rotating ensemble, La Société des Arpenteurs. The Chicago Reader has described him as a 'major artist'."

  "text" : "Desmond Gaspar is a Canadian organist, pianist, conductor, composer and songwriter who works as a free lance concert artist and ballet pianist who won the Associateship and Fellowship diplomas of the Royal Canadian College of Organists in consecutive years while under 30 years of age, thus being one of a very small number of Canadians under that age to achieve that distinction at the time. Gaspar studied under Earle Moss (piano), Molly Sclater (theory), Roman Toi (composition) and Heather Spry (organ and church music) from the University of Toronto and the Royal Conservatory of Music in Toronto, during which time he received numerous performance and competition awards. His eclectic career in liturgical music, dance accompaniment, choir-directing and other disciplines has taken him to various venues in Canada, the United States and Europe. A Fellow of the Royal Canadian College of Organists (winning the Associateship and Fellowship Diplomas in consecutive years as well as the Charles Peaker and the Healey Willan Prizes respectively with those attempts, scoring the highest mark in Canada for the latter), Gaspar was one of a very small number of Canadians who won that professional designation under the age of thirty at the time of his receiving it. He has also conducted chamber orchestras, massed choirs and jazz combos in addition to writing a number of uniquely crafted classical songs (based on T.S. Eliot's cycle Prufrock and Other Observations). In 2007 he appeared in Los Angeles at the \"TAXI\" convention in a gala promo event featuring some original songs from his collection, entitled The Dancer and I. From 2005 to 2007 Gaspar stepped in as Associate Organist at St. Paul's Anglican Cathedral, London, Ontario, where he performed in the Cathedral concert series as organ accompanist which often featured members of Orchestra London - and where he was publicly declared \"A World Class Musician\" on two occasions by the Cathedral Dean, now Bishop, Terry Dance."

  "text" : "Daisy Polk (fl. 1917) was an American woman who became Comtesse de Buyer-Mimeure after marrying French Army General Marie Joseph Louis Robert de Buyer. Polk was a prominent woman from San Francisco (she was the sister of architect Willis Polk and related to President Polk). Active in the American relief effort during World War I, she was assigned the reconstruction of the French village of Vitrimont, with monies supplied by Mrs. Crocker of San Francisco; Vitrimont was the first of a number of villages restored with American aid. She and de Buyer met by chance in Vitrimont in 1916: when her car broke down, de Buyer offered his assistance; a year later they were married, in September. Her husband had been in command of the 6th Light Armoured Brigade. In 1915 he became commander of the Third Cavalry Corps (France), and a year later of the Second Army Corps (France). He retired in 1917. The wedding was attended by such notables as General Pétain. In 1920, Polk was named a Legion Chevalier., In the 1930s, Comtesse de Buyer-Mimeuse, a well-known public figure, was active with the Catholic Sewing Circle in Passy."

In the 2010 regional elections, Boois won the Berseba Constituency with 1,225 votes. He remained Berseba councillor also after the 2015 regional elections which he won with 1,774 votes. As an educator, Boois was a teacher at the Ecumenical Community Secondary School in Berseba. Boois was involved in a controversy regarding the different factions of the traditional leadership of the ǀHaiǀKhaua (Berseba Orlam) subtribe of the Nama people. He supported a group contesting the legitimacy of the reunification of the Goliath and Isaak rival clans and tried to extend the 50-year-long split of the Berseba Orlam. Eventually Boois supported the unity of the tribe by reconciling with fellow former Karas governor Stephanus Goliath early in 2011."

  "text" : "(For other people with the same name, see Dan Dugan.) Dan Dugan (born March 20, 1943) is an American audio engineer, inventor, and nature sounds recordist. He was the first person in regional theatre to be called a sound designer, and he developed the first effective automatic microphone mixer: the automixer. Dugan's sound design work was acknowledged in 2003 with a Distinguished Career Award by the United States Institute for Theatre Technology. In his youth, Dugan was fascinated by the technical aspects of theatre. He worked as a lighting designer then transitioned to sound design in 1967. Dugan became interested in achieving the automatic adjustment of sound controls after a frustrating experience staging the musical Hair. His first automixer design was not fully practical but his second design was successful; it used a reference derived from a total of all of its microphone signals. Dugan devised a third improvement which helped prevent audio feedback in the presence of sound reinforcement loudspeakers. Dugan next produced an automixer design that could be inserted into an existing mixing console. This proved popular for broadcast and live sound applications. Each of Dugan's subsequent automixer models has been of the insertable type. Dugan first recorded sounds in the late 1960s to augment his sound designs. He continued making recordings, concentrating on capturing the sounds of nature. Dugan records outdoors in a variety of locations including national parks and nature preserves. He has assisted in research related to the harmful effects of human-generated sound in nature. Dugan is a co-founder and current secretary of People for Legal and Nonsectarian Schools (PLANS), a California non-profit organization incorporated in 1997."

  "text" : "Diane Gromala (born 24 February 1960) is a Canada Research Chair  and a Professor in the Simon Fraser University School of Interactive Arts and Technology. Her research works at the confluence of computer science, media art and design, and has focused on the cultural, visceral, and embodied implications of digital technologies, particularly in the realm of chronic pain. Dr. Gromala received her bachelor's degree (BFA) in graphic design from the University of Michigan in 1982, her Master of Fine Arts (MFA) degree from Yale University in 1990, and her PhD in Human-Computer Interaction from Plymouth University in 2007. From 1982-1990, Gromala worked in industry as art director for MacWorld and Apple Computer. Gromala was one of the first artists to work with immersive virtual reality (VR), beginning with Dancing with the Virtual Dervish. Co-created with choreographer Yacov Sharir in 1990 at the Banff Centre for the Arts' Art & Virtual Environments residency, this piece has been exhibited worldwide from 1993-2004. Gromala subsequently designed immersive VR for stress-reduction, anxiety-reduction, and pain distraction during chemotherapy at Georgia Tech. Gromala's work has been used in over 20 hospitals and clinics. Gromala is the Founding Director of the Chronic Pain Research Institute, an interdisciplinary team of artists, designers, computer scientists, neuroscientists and medical doctors investigating how new technologies—ranging from virtual reality and visualization to social media—may be used as a technological form of analgesia and pain management. With Jay Bolter, Gromala is the co-author of Windows and Mirrors: Interaction Design, Digital Art and the Myth of Transparency. This book was based on her experience as the Art Gallery Chair for SIGGRAPH 2000, which had the greatest number of interactive artworks in its history. Her work is widely published in the domains of Computer Science, Interactive Art and Interaction Design. Her pioneering virtual reality work has been featured on the BBC, CNN, the Discovery Channel, and the New York Times. Dr. Gromala lectures internationally and continues to publish research articles in her fields of research. She was a faculty member at the University of Texas at Austin; the University of Washington, where she headed the New Media Research Lab and was a member of the Human Interface Technology Lab (HITLab); and at graduate programme for Information Design at Georgia Tech's School of Literature, Communication and Culture (LCC), and a member of the renowned GVU (Graphics, Visualization & Usability) Center.

  "text" : "David Otti was one of Uganda's most respected coaches and one of the most decorated persons in Ugandan football. He was born in Gulu, northern Uganda and he died at the age of 71 on 3 March 2011 at Case MedCare Hospital in Kampala. Preliminary medical reports showed he succumbed to pulmonary embolism before his body was transferred to Mulago National Referral Hospital for a conclusive post-mortem. This was still on-going by press time.He was also battling with diabetes, while he was still coach of Express FC, a Ugandan football club. Otti's leg was amputated last May following a near four-year battle against diabetes. During his time, he coached all the top three Ugandan clubs - Express, KCC and SC Villa. He spread his wings across the region to work at Kenyan sides Volcano United and Gor Mahia (1981–83), Somalia's Mogadishu Municipal Council (1987–1990) and Rwanda's outfit APR (1995–96) plus serving as National Council of Sports (NCS) general secretary. It is at Express FC where Otti is revered most having brought the club their first league title in almost two decades back in 1993. He also won three Ugandan Cup titles while there. Otti is best remembered as one of the most successful coaches in Ugandan football and led all giant clubs in Ugandan Football that include Express, SC Villa and KCC FC to multiple titles, and was successful both with attacking and defensive tactics. His career began in the 1960s, playing for Bitumastic and the Uganda Cranes (the national team of Uganda), including the 1968 African Cup of Nations. He began his coaching career in 1973. He also coached the Uganda Cranes, Uganda's national team which qualified for the Africa Cup of Nations in Cairo (1974) and Ethiopia (1976). He also briefly had short coaching spells in Somalia and Rwanda."

  "text" : "David Hardingham (born 1965) is a British-based reform activist, aid organiser, entrepreneur and the former Honorary Consul of the Maldives (Nasheed Administration) in Salisbury (UK). Hardingham was born in South Africa, where his early studies were in Hilton College. The family later moved to the UK in 1982, where Hardingham continued his education at Dauntsey's School, an independent co-educational boarding school in Wiltshire, UK. He was founder of the human rights activist organisation Friends of Maldives (FOM). He was also the co-founder of the clandestine opposition radio station Minivan Radio  and trustee of the UK registered charity Maldives Aid. He was appointed the Honorary Consul for the Maldives in Salisbury (UK) on 2 July 2009. Hardingham was closely involved with the movement for political reform in the Maldives as a result of his friendship with then opposition activist Mohamed Nasheed (Anni), and former President of the Maldives, whom he met while both of them were at Dauntsey's School. He was an outspoken critic of former President Maumoon Abdul Gayoom’s human rights record during his thirty-year presidency, a record he maintains is confirmed by the many examples of torture undergone by Mohamed Nasheed and many others he had met during the time many opposition activists stayed at Salisbury. Owing to his criticism of the former regime, Hardingham was officially barred from entering the Maldives between 2005 and 2008. During this time, he was accused by the then-government of being both a Christian fundamentalist trying to convert Maldivians and an Islamic extremist involved in a plot to smuggle weapons into the Maldives. Further accusations were made that he and Mohamed Nasheed were conspiring to build a replica of Salisbury Cathedral in the Maldives. Hardingham has visited the Maldives several times since the change of government, but he has, to date, not been officially informed of his status. Neither has he received any further information regarding the allegations. Along with Sarah Mahir and other FOM associates Hardingham confronted Gayoom in the Palais des Nations in Geneva on 16 May 2005. Hardingham asked him why he had been blacklisted from the Maldives and about human rights abuses in the Maldives. There was no response from Gayoom. Following the FOM Selected Resorts Boycott campaign Hardingham was accused of trying to bring about a collapse of the Maldives tourism industry, a charge he strongly denies as he has always argued that the idea of the selected boycott was to apply the restrictions only to those resorts associated closely with the regime while strongly encouraging visits to other resorts and to the Maldives. Hardingham and Sarah Mahir of FOM met regularly with the UK Conservative Party Human Rights Commission and engaged their help to closely monitor the political and human rights situation in the Maldives. Members of the Commission tabled several Parliamentary Questions and Early Day Motions regarding human rights abuses in the Maldives. He was UK crossing coordinator and liaison during Guin Batten’s successful rowing crossing of the Zero Degree Channel on 30 March 2010 (between Huvadhoo Atoll and Foammulah Island), a distance of approximately 60 km (37 mi). The Consulate in Salisbury was officially inaugurated at an opening ceremony on 9 July 2010, attended by the Maldives High Commissioner Dr Farah Faizal and local MP for Salisbury John Glen. Hardingham has promoted guesthouse tourism in the Maldives saying that, at a time of growing competition from other luxury destinations, the growth of guesthouse tourism in the Maldives would bring more direct economic benefit to the islanders. Hardingham and FOM colleagues are currently involved in bringing skilled volunteers, starting with teachers and medics, to the Maldives from the UK. Hardingham resigned from his post as Honorary Consul to the Maldives during the coup that led to the overthrow of President Nasheed."

He is currently Professor of Econometrics and Computational Statistics at the University of Leicester, where he lectures in Mathematical Statistics, Econometrics and Environmental Sciences. He has been elected a Fellow of the Econometric Society. A great-grandson of Ernest Pollock, 1st Viscount Hanworth a former Master of the Rolls, Hanworth succeeded to the viscountcy (and baronetcy) upon his father's death in 1996 and took his seat in the House of Lords until the House of Lords Act in 1999 removed his automatic right to sit in Parliament. He chose not to stand in the election by Labour hereditary peers to select two of their number to remain in Parliament after this Act came into force. Hanworth stood but was unsuccessful in the by-election caused by the death of Lord Milner in 2003. Willing to work in the Lords still, in 2011 he won the cross-house hereditary by-election to become one of fifteen 'deputy speakers', following the death of Lord Strabolgi, who was also Labour. He was therefore appointed/elected on the all hereditary-peer eligibility basis following a death of one of the 90 places which remain based on heredity. He and his wife, Elizabeth daughter of Lawrence Vambe MBE, live in London. The title is expected to pass to a nephew as they have two daughters: \n* Hon. Cecile Pollock (born 1971) \n* Hon.

He was an Australian Research Council from 2012 to 2016 and a Guggenheim Fellow in 2006. Kahn is known primarily for his writings on the use of sound in the avant-garde and experimental arts and music, and history and theory of the media arts. His writings have also been influential in the scholarly area of sound studies and the practical area of sound art. His best known book Noise, Water, Meat: A History of Sound in the Arts was published by MIT Press in 1999. The Times Literary Supplement called the book \"an impressive combination of solid academic research and theoretical pyrotechnics.\" His book, Earth Sound Earth Signal: Energies and Earth Magnitude in the Arts was published in 2013 by University of California Press. Support was provided by a Guggenheim Fellowship to investigate the history of naturally occurring electromagnetism in telecommunications, science and the arts, and by a 2008 Arts Writers Grant from Creative Capital and the Warhol Foundation. Slate (magazine) and Public Books listed Earth Sound Earth Signal as one of the best books of the year. With composer and founding editor Larry Austin, Kahn edited Source: Music of the Avant-garde, a collection of material drawn from the original Source: Music of the Avant Garde magazine series and, with the art historian Hannah Higgins, he has edited a collection of essays and historical documents, Mainframe Experimentalism: Early Computing and the Foundations of the Digital Arts.

Raley, who worked as a security guard at the Carolands mansion in Hillsborough, stabbed both girls dozens of times, then locked them in the trunk of his car and went home to play Monopoly with his family. Later, thinking they were both dead, he dumped both girls in a nearby ravine. McKenna, bloodied and battered, pulled herself out the next morning and flagged down a passing car. At the time both girls were still alive but Grinsell was later pronounced dead in a hospital. Raley currently has an appeal pending in the Supreme Court of California and waits for U.S. District Judge Jeremy D. Fogel's decision on whether California's new and untested execution chamber is ready to resume lethal injections."

Then, in 2001, his piece Growing worm, stabbing his back-part slowly into the blues was published on his CD More new blues for piano. In the same years Eisenga appeared in Vlissingen to make premiere performance of Kabaal (Kabbalah), his chamber music piece about Michiel de Ruyter, at the Zeeland Nazomer Festival (Zeeland Autumn Festival). In 2003, his work Requiem Aeternam 1953, a composition for choir and orchestra, was premiered at the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the North Sea flood of 1953. In 2004, a large part of his works was premiered at a concert in the Center for New Music in Zeeland. Eisenga's work has roots in pop music of his generation. He makes no difference between pop songs, twelve-tone techniques, baroque music or eastern musical patterns and manages to combine these elements in his compositions. From 1993, Eisenga lives in Zeeland."

Additionally, The Nobody was a finalist for the \"Best First Book\" RITA award and won Romantic Times magazine's Reviewers' Choice Award for \"Best First Regency\" in 1999. RITAs are awarded annually by Romance Writers of America Romance Writers of America. However, her Regency romances which featured no sex scenes or mild sensuality (and were thus classified as traditional Regencies) weren't marketed properly, and didn't sell as much as expected. In the mid-2000s, Signet stopped publishing traditional Regencies and Farr lost her writing contract, shortly after publishing four longer traditional Regencies (which were wrongly marketed as Regency historicals). Farr then published a young-adult paranormal novel Wicked Cool, published in 2010 by Cerridwen Press and subsequently offered in print form through CreateSpace by the author. She is also the author of A Month of Sundays, and four short plays published by Russell House. Some of her books, long out of print, have been republished as e-books and are now available through the usual sources. She lives in northern California."

  "text" : "Demetrios Tzamplakon (Greek: Δημήτριος Τζαμπλάκων, fl. 1345–1366/67) was a Byzantine aristocrat and senior military leader. The Tzamplakones were an important and wealthy aristocratic family attested since the mid-13th century, when one of its members achieved the high military rank of Domestic of the Schools. Alexios Tzamplakon, Demetrios' father, was this man's son. His brothers, Asomatianos and Arsenios, also achieved high offices during the same period. Demetrios was married to Eudokia Palaiologina and had several children, whose names are unknown. Demetrios is first attested in 1345, already holding the senior military rank of megas stratopedarches, during the siege of Serres by the forces of the Serbian ruler Stephen Dushan. A large part of the city's population, under Manuel Asen, wanted to surrender the city to the Serbs, while Tzamplakon led the loyalist faction. After the city's fall, he withdrew to Christoupolis (modern Kavala), and is still attested in the 1360s."

Additionally, he also holds the American records in the 100 metres, triple jump, shot put and javelin throw. Born in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, he was a child of the Great Depression. He had high jumped in high school, where he claims he was \"not great,\" but work soon took priority. He was a Tool and die maker and remained at work during World War II. Other than occasional bowling, softball and golf, he was not involved in athletics for 58 years. Meanwhile, he watched his more athletic friends from the football team have failing ankles, knees and hearts. Pellmann never had those kinds of ailments. On September 20, 2015, Pellmann set five world records at the San Diego Senior Games. Competing in the 100 and older category, he ran the 100-meter dash in 26.99 seconds, beating the previous age-group world record held by Japan's Hidekichi Miyazaki by 2.84 seconds. Pellmann became the first centenarian to clear an official height in the high jump. Pellmann also set records in the shot put, discus throw and long jump. Later that week, Pellmann was named USATF \"Athlete of the Week\"."

  "text" : "Donald Max Flynn (September 14, 1934, in Durant, Oklahoma – April 14, 2010) is a former All-American quarterback, NFL quarterback, soldier and businessman. He grew up in Texas, lettering in baseball, basketball and football for MVP again his senior year of college. Flynn graduated from the University of Houston with a degree in petroleum engineering and minored in geology. After college, Flynn served in the Army and played four years of professional football. Flynn played for the Dallas Texans, who later became the Kansas City Chiefs, and the New York Titans, who later became the New York Jets. Flynn also played in the Canadian league for the Edmonton Eskimos. At the professional level, Flynn was a defensive back and quarterback, he started every game for both the Texans and the Titans. While playing in the NFL, Flynn made about $8,500 a year, and so after an injury to his knee, Flynn decided to take a job with Skelly Oil Company in Duncan, Oklahoma. Flynn later relocated to Tulsa, Oklahoma, and went to work for White Shield Oil and Gas Company. In 1972, Flynn formed Flynn Energy Corp. and by 1976 the company had been named Oklahoma's Stock of the Year by Oklahoma Business magazine. Less than two years later, Flynn sold the oil-and gas firm for over $30 million. During the period from 1972–1978, the company drilled 342 wells in Oklahoma, Louisiana, Michigan, Texas, West Virginia and Pennsylvania, Arkansas and Colorado. During this period the company developed 80.3 BCF of Net Equivalent Gas Reserves having a Total Income of $152 MM. The Company went public in February 1974 and was publicly traded, (OTC), until the assets were sold in December 1978, to Reserve Oil and Gas for a total cash consideration of $54 MM. This was an asset sale, and the Company was immediately reorganized after the closing. The second Flynn Energy Corp. was established at that time. This company was run much like the first, and between 1978-1989 the company drilled 274 wells and earned $390 million. Flynn went on to spend over 40 years in the oil and gas industry, he founded and managed two successful publicly traded companies. Flynn also founded DMF Inc. which is a privately owned corporation. DMF Inc. holds interest in 19 producing wells in Michigan, Oklahoma, Texas, and Louisiana. Between Flynn Energy Corp. and DMF Inc., the net income for both companies totaled $542 million. Flynn met his wife, Patricia Fenwick, while she was working as a flight attendant on a Braniff flight he was taking with one of his football teams. A year later they were married and not long after that they had four children, Brett, Don, Kelly, and Michael. Flynn and his family lived in Tulsa, Oklahoma, in Southern Hills, where he enjoyed playing golf. He also has four granddaughters Mallory Flynn-Hodges, Lindsay Flynn, Samantha Wright, and Rebecca Flynn. Paramount in his life were love of his family, his Christian faith, competitive sports, country-western music and regard and concern for this exceptional country. On Wednesday April 14, 2010 Don Flynn died in the Intensive Care Unit of St. Johns Medical Center in Tulsa, Oklahoma. He was 75."

Born and raised in Sydney, Ahern decided to become a composer in his mid-teens, and studied composition under Nigel Butterley and Richard Meale. His first performed work, After Mallarmé, was recorded by the South Australian Symphony Orchestra and was submitted to the International Rostrum of Composers in Paris. He travelled in Europe in the 1960s, studying under Karlheinz Stockhausen in Germany and Cornelius Cardew in London. In 1970, Ahern returned to Australia where, influenced by the Scratch Orchestra co-founded by Cardew, he formed the AZ Music ensemble at the Sydney Conservatorium of Music, which included such composers and performers as Roger Frampton."

Among other songs, he composed the melody for the Serbian national anthem Bože pravde (\"God of Justice\"), the former Slovenian national anthem Naprej, zastava Slave (\"Forward, Flag of Glory!\"), and the popular Serbian and Montenegrin anthem Onamo, 'namo!. Jenko was born as Martin Jenko in the Upper Carniolan village of Dvorje, in what was then the Austrian Empire. After graduating from high school in Trieste, he went to Vienna, where he studied law. During his Viennese stay, he founded the Slovene Choir Society in Vienna, which was sponsored by the national liberal politician Valentin Zarnik. In 1862, he moved to the town of Pančevo in southern Vojvodina, where he worked as the choirmaster of the local Serbian Orthodox Church. He later moved on the other side of the Austrian-Serbian border to Belgrade, where he worked as a composer in the Serbian National Theatre. Jenko was named among the first four members of the Academy of Arts of the Royal Serbian Academy of Sciences, named by King Milan I of Serbia on 5 April 1887. He lived in Serbia until 1897, when he moved to Ljubljana in his native Carniola. He died in Ljubljana, and was buried in the Žale cemetery in the Bežigrad district."

Kremer won the state title of best high school debater as a senior and graduated from Everett in 1956. Kremer earned his A.B. in 1960 from Stanford University, where he served as captain of the debate team for two years and won the Joffre Debate against the University of California, Berkeley. After earning his LL.B. from Stanford Law School in 1963, Kremer served as a Deputy Attorney General in Sacramento, California. In 1972, he was promoted to head of the criminal division in the Attorney General's San Diego office. In 1983, Kremer was again promoted, this time to Chief Assistant Attorney General heading the statewide criminal division. Later that year, Republican Governor George Deukmejian appointed Kremer to serve as a San Diego County Superior Court Judge. In 1985, Deukmejian elevated Kremer to serve as Presiding Justice of the California Fourth District Court of Appeal, Division One. During his service as Presiding Justice, Kremer served as Chair of the Judicial Council's Criminal Trial Delay Reduction Committee, Library Technology Committee, and Court Facilities Task Force.

  "text" : "Douglas Burrage Snelling (1916–1985) was an Australian architect and furniture designer. He was born in 1916 in Gravesend, Kent, England Douglas Snelling arrived in Wellington, New Zealand, with his parents in 1926.As a teenager, began his own graphic arts and shop window design business in Wanganui. In 1937 he travelled to Hollywood, where he freelanced making sketches, and began to emulate Errol Flynn's style. He returned to New Zealand in 1938 and became a writer, broadcaster and publicist of new movies and stars from 1938 to 1940. He moved to Sydney in 1940 and worked as a publicist and in a munitions factory during the beginning of World War II. In 1945 he married NZ heiress Nancy Springhall. With her money he opened a business designing shop windows and furniture. His chairs featured parachute webbing and modernist design and according to the Powerhouse Museum, were \"Australia's first popular, mass produced range of furniture sold widely through the major department stores from the late 1940s to the mid 1950s.\" He and his wife travelled to America where Snelling was inspired by Frank Lloyd Wright's work. When they returned to Australia in 1948, Snelling met a US architect, Harry Seidler, and began designing houses. He became a registered architect in 1952. He built modernist houses, apartment buildings, and office buildings. One of his designs won the 1955 House of the Year Award from Architecture and Arts magazine. He and his wife divorced in 1959 and the next year he married Patricia Gale (daughter of a wealthy Sydney property developer and grazier), with whom he raised three sons and her daughter by a previous marriage. In the mid-1960s they travelled to Cambodia, which started a long interest in that country that led him to friendship Prince Sihanouk, an appointment as an honorary consul (1970-75), and a hobby of collecting and trading Khmer antiquities. After Patricia's death in 1976, he moved with his teenage sons to Honolulu, where he married Swedish artist Marianne Sparre in the early 1980s. In 1985, he was concerned enough about his failing health to suddenly book a flight back to Sydney, where he died several days later of a brain aneurism."

On 8 February 2012, Prime Minister Gordon Darcy Lilo appointed him Minister for Provincial Government. (His predecessor, Walter Folatalu, was reshuffled as Minister for Communication and Civil Aviation, replacing Andrew Hanaria who had lost his seat upon being found to have bribed voters.) On 1 March, Tome was reshuffled to the position of Minister for Police, National Security and Correctional Services, left vacant by Clay Forau who had been promoted Minister for Foreign Affairs. On 22 October, Tome was reshuffled to the position of Minister for Agriculture."

  "text" : "Durga Charan Nag (Bengali:দুরগা চরণ নাগ) better known as Nag Mahasaya (Maha Asayah in Sanskrit or \"of great possession\"), born in 1846 and died in 1899 in Deobhog village (Munshiganj district) of erstwhile East Bengal and now Bangladesh, was one of the householder disciples of Sri Ramakrishna Paramahansa. Sri Ramakrishna called him \"a blazing fire\" when he first saw him. According to the other disciples of Sri Ramakrishna, most notable among them being Swami Vivekananda, he was a shining example of renunciation and love for God. He shunned material wealth and regarded every human being as God on earth. According to his biography, although he was a good homeopatic doctor, he gave up his practice just because Sri Ramakrishna had mentioned that it is difficult for doctors to make spiritual progress as they thrive on the ill health of the others. He lived lifelong on a meagre income but spent most of it in serving poor, his guests and monks and ascetics. Sarat Chandra Chakravarty, a direct disciple of Swami Vivekananda and the author of the book \"Diary of a Disciple\" (Swami-Sishya Sangbad in Bengali) wrote the biography on Nag Mahasaya. There is not much literature available on Nag Mahasaya and most of information on him can be obtained in works related to Sri Ramakrishna, his teacher and master, and Swami Vivekananda, the foremost disciple of Ramakrishna. Swami Vivekananda mentioned to Sarat Chandra in a conversation about Nag Mahasaya - \"All the characteristics of the highest type of devotion, spoken of in the scriptures, have manifested themselves in Nag Mahashaya. It is only in him that we actually see fulfilled the widely quoted text, \"Trinadapi Sunichena\". (\"Lowlier than the lowly stalk of grass.\") Blessed indeed is your East Bengal to have been hallowed by the touch of Nag Mahashaya's feet!\"In his hometown in Bangladesh, a foundation runs a charitable institution bearing his name"

  "text" : "Christopher Alder was a trainee computer programmer and former British Army paratrooper who had served in the Falklands War and was commended for his service with the Army in Northern Ireland. He died while in police custody at Queen's Gardens Police Station, Kingston upon Hull, in April 1998. The case became a cause célèbre for civil rights campaigners in the United Kingdom. He had earlier been the victim of an assault outside a nightclub and was taken to Hull Royal Infirmary where, possibly as a result of his head injury, staff said his behaviour was \"extremely troublesome.\" He was escorted from the hospital by two police officers who arrested him to prevent a breach of the peace. On arrival at the police station Alder was \"partially dragged and partially carried,\" handcuffed and unconscious, from a police van and placed on the floor of the custody suite. Officers chatted between themselves and speculated that he was faking illness. Twelve minutes later one of the officers present noticed that Alder was not making any breathing noises and although resuscitation was attempted, he was pronounced dead at the scene. A post mortem indicated that the head injury alone would not have killed him. The incident was captured on the police station's closed-circuit television (CCTV) cameras. A coroner's jury in 2000 returned a verdict that Alder was unlawfully killed. In 2002 five police officers went on trial charged with Alder's manslaughter and misconduct in public office, but were acquitted on the orders of the judge. In 2006 an Independent Police Complaints Commission report concluded that four of the officers present in the custody suite when Alder died were guilty of the \"most serious neglect of duty\". In November 2011 the government formally apologised to Alder's family in the European Court of Human Rights, admitting that it had breached its obligations with regard to \"preserving life and ensuring no one is subjected to inhuman or degrading treatment\". They also admitted that they had failed to carry out an effective and independent inquiry into the case."

McCulloh also curates exhibitions, most notably Sight Unseen: International Photography by Blind Artists, the first major museum exhibition of work by blind photographers. McCulloh, under the nom-de-plume “Quoteman,” has also collected and posted online thousands of quotations about photography."

Benavente, a Republican, served as the Lieutenant Governor of the Northern Mariana Islands under former Governor Juan Babauta from January 14, 2002, to January 9, 2006. Benavente first ran for election in 1987, when he narrowly lost his bid for election to the Northern Mariana Islands House of Representatives in Precinct II by just six votes. However, Benavente was elected to the House in his second campaign in 1989. He served in the House for six consecutive terms, including three terms as the Speaker of the House. He left the House to run for Lieutenant Governor in 2001. Benavente was elected Lieutenant Governor of the Northern Mariana Islands as the running mate of Juan Babauta in the 2001 gubernatorial election. He served in office from 2002 to 2006. Babauta and Benavente lost their bid for re-election in 2005 to Covenant Party candidate Benigno Fitial and his running mate, Timothy Villagomez.

  "text" : "Darryl Richard (born March 18, 1946 as Darryl Richard Rosenberg), is a former child actor who appeared on television from 1955 until 1966. He is best remembered for the role of Morton \"Smitty\" Smith, the best friend of the character Jeff Stone, played by Paul Petersen, in thirty-two episodes of ABC's situation comedy series, The Donna Reed Show. Richard's first television appearance occurred at the age of eight on January 18, 1955, as Tony in the episode \"The Bogey Man\" of The U.S. Steel Hour, an acclaimed live-drama series, which then aired on ABC. Richard also appeared in 1955 and 1956 in separate roles in three episodes of CBS's The Phil Silvers Show. On January 1, 1960, Richard appeared as Andy in the episode \"Sundance and the Blood Money\" on Earl Holliman's CBS western series, Hotel de Paree. That same month, he starred as Steve in the episode \"Roy Runs Away\" of CBS's The Betty Hutton Show. In the fall of 1960, Richard played the part of Turk in two episodes of CBS's The Ann Sothern Show. On May 17, 1962, he made his first appearance on The Donna Reed Show in the episode entitled \"The Swingin' Set\" as Morton \"Smitty\" Smith, the best friend of Jeff Stone. His last appearance occurred in the series finale on March 19, 1966 in the segment entitled \"By-Line--Jeff Stone.\" That episode also constituted Richard's own final network television appearance. It occurred one day after his twentieth birthday. On June 1, 1962, two weeks after his Donna Reed debut, Richard played Thompson in the episode \"The Changing of the Guard\" of CBS's The Twilight Zone, hosted by Rod Serling. The episode centers upon a teacher at a boys' school, played by Donald Pleasence, who when forced to retire against his wishes contemplates suicide in the mistaken belief that he has made little impact in his career. Richard also appeared in The Dick Powell Show, Sam Benedict, The Rifleman, and the NBC sitcom Grindl, starring Imogene Coca. On May 7, 1964, Richard played Ralph in \"Charlie, He Couldn't Kill a Fly\" of NBC's Kraft Suspense Theatre.

  "text" : "David Scase (21 September 1919 – 27 February 2003) was a British actor. Born at Fulham, London, as the son of a bricklayer/plumber, his first job as in a bicycle factory in the mid-1930s. He joined the Merchant Navy on the outbreak of World War II in 1939, but by the end of the war was working as a BBC sound engineer. He then joined Joan Littlewood's Theatre Workshop in Manchester and served as a stage manager, before moving to directing. He ran the Manchester Library Theatre, which he made into one of the most prestigious repertory theatres in the country, from the late 1950s until the 1970s. He gave actors such as Patrick Stewart, Martin Jarvis, and many other household names, their first jobs. Following minor television roles between 1948 and 1965, he began to act on a regular basis during the 1970s, beginning with an appearance in a 1972 episode of Holly. Minor roles in shows including The Nearly Man, ITV Playhouse, Flambards and Fallen Hero followed later on in the decade. In 1984, in his 65th year, he landed his first regular television role, in How We Used to Live, with five appearances as George Holyrood. From 1984 to 1987, he appeared as Hilda Ogden's friend Dr Lowther in Coronation Street. In 1989, he appeared in two episodes of Judith Krantz's Till We Meet Again. Scase retired from acting in 1992, having voiced the Duke in Truckers (stop motion animation adaptation of the Terry Pratchett book) early in the year, and finally appearing as an Art Gallery Owner in The Case-Book of Sherlock Holmes. He died in February 2003, at the age of 83. He was married to actress Rosalie Williams for 58 years until his death. She outlived him, as did their four children."

  "text" : "Dorothy Mead (1928–1975) was a British painter. Mead was born in London, England, but adopted at three months old by a family in Walthamstow. Her mother had a florists shopShe first met David Bomberg (1890–1957) when he was teaching at the South east Essex School of Art at Dagenham School of Art in 1944. She followed him when he moved to the City Literary Institute in London and then to the Borough Polytechnic where she studied under Bomberg from 1945 to 1951. Mead was a founder member of the Borough Group in 1946 together with other pupils of Bomberg including Cliff Holden. From 1956 until 1959, Mead was a mature student at the Slade School of Art, following Bomberg's inspiration. Here she met artist and teacher Andrew Forge. She had a major influence on students such as Patrick Procktor and Mario Dubsky and was the first woman president of the student annual exhibiting society, Young Contemporaries (later renamed New Contemporaries), in 1959. The previous year, the Slade awarded her the Figure Painting Prize, and the Steer Prize. In 1959 she was asked to leave the Slade, in spite of her award-winning work, because she refused to sit the course on perspective. She believed - with Bomberg - that the stylistic approach was invalid. Her thesis, explaining her view was not accepted by the principal, William Coldstream. In the Arts Council England series of touring exhibitions, Six Young Painters, Mead exhibited in 1964 with other artists including Peter Blake, William Crozier, David Hockney, Bridget Riley, and Euan Uglow. Mead joined the London Group of artists in 1960. The New Statesman, the left-wing magazine singled her out, when critic David Sylvester remarked she tends to affirm the supremacy of light, as women's painting often does. Holden, her partner said Dorothy sticks to her principals, but like myself and Bomberg was an outsider. From 1964, Mead arrived as lecturer at Goldsmith's College\"like a breath of fresh air\" according to pupil and painter Barry Martin. She swept aside the old gentlemanly bohemian and class pretensions that she thought \"stubborn preconceptions\". Her family saw her \"living on the edge\" of reality all the time. She worked in a garret studio in Ladbroke Grove; yet went up to Berkeley Square to buy paints. She was described by art dealer, Dennis Creffield as having an \"abundant personality...a great love of art...stylish in appearance.\" Her daring, precarious act of existential expressionism can be seen in The Acrobat, an exhibition of 1970 at Borough Road Gallery. She was President from 1971–73, succeeding Andrew Forge, a progressive art historian with whom she was long associated, and also had an affair. Mead spent two spells teaching at Morley College: between 1963-5 she taught 'Painting', and from 1973-75 she taught 'Drawing & Painting' (\"for advanced students of some considerable experience\") and 'Improvisation from the Model' in the Morley Summer Painting School. Dorothy Mead was also a part-time lecturer at Chelsea College of Art in London between 1962-64. She was a radical feminist with a principled individualism - she once remarked that if she changed her name to George, she stood a greater chance of selling her work! The collection of the Tate Gallery and other art museums include work by Mead.Mead's paintings were shown at the 1991 exhibition Bomberg and his Legacy, held in Eastbourne at the Towner Art Gallery.In 2005, a retrospective exhibition was held thirty years after her death. Despite the esteem she had earned from fellow artists, it was her first ever solo exhibition. Following her death on 12 June 1975, many of Dorothy Meads paintings were stolen from a secure warehouse in Essex. Mrs Valerie Long, her sister is the holder of Dorothy's works and should be contacted prior to the purchase of any paintings around the world. Those not in the public gallery are also sold by Waterhouse & Dodd."

  "text" : "Debedeavon (died 1657) was the chief ruler of the Accawmack Indian nation that was inhabiting the Eastern Shore of Virginia upon the first arrival of English colonists in 1608. His title was recorded as \"Ye Emperor of Ye Easterne Shore and King of Ye Great Nussawattocks,\" and he was also known familiarly as \"the Laughing King\". He also seems to be the same figure who was known variously in English records as Esmy Shichans, Tobot Deabot, and Okiawampe. The Accawmack, who numbered about 2000, were peripheral or nominal members of the Powhatan Confederacy. However, since water isolated them from the rest of Tsenacommacah (mainland Virginia), the Eastern Shore Indians had their own confederacy enjoying some measure of autonomy and peaceful rule under king Debedeavon. Each of his clan subchiefs paid him 8 bushels of corn, plus three arrowheads, as tribute each year. In 1608, a 13 year old English ensign named Thomas Savage was traded to Chief Powhatan for a native boy, Nemotacke, as something like a cultural exchange student. Powhatan adopted Savage, who became an interpreter between the two cultures, but the jealousy of that Chief's brother eventually led Savage to be sent to the relatively safer Eastern Shore, where Debedeavon gave him a large tract of land between Cheriton Creek and King's Creek that became known as Savage's Neck, under his son John Savage (1624-1667; Thomas having married emigrant Hannah Tyng in 1621). Indeed, during the starving time at Jamestown, Debedeavon sold the colonists much needed provisions. In 1621, the English colonists has spread along the peninsula from what had been their settlement on Plantation Creek. In 1621, Thomas Savage and Debedeavon warned the visiting Governor George Yeardley that Powhaton's tribe was plotting for a general uprising against Jamestown and the other colonists. The Governor was incredulous, but went to all the plantations and held musters despite Opechancanough's denial of any conspiracy. Those steps, however, led to sufficient defense that the colony was not annihilated in the Indian massacre of 1622. Moreover, Lady Elizabeth Dale, widow of Thomas Dale, left the western shore which was suffering from an epidemic (foul distemper), with 20 people including 8 boys who thus survived the massacres on her plantation under Debedeavon's benevolent protection, so by 1823 about 80 settlers lived on the eastern shore. Debedeavon favored Savage and gave him a large tract of land that is still today known as \"Savage's Neck\". In his later years, Debedeavon devoted himself to the pleasures of hunting, leaving much of the business of government to his brother and Prime Minister, Kiptopeke. Indeed, when some prowling Indians up the coast killed an Englishman and boy, Debedeavon sent peace ambasadors, which Col. Obedience Robins refused to use as human sacrifices, but instead sent back, although Daniel Cugley, who had married the widowed Hannah Tyng, set them to work on his plantation, which caused his arrest and being sent to Jamestown for trial. Furthermore, when a quarrelsome settler pointed a gun at Debedeavon, the Accawmacke shire Court (Capt. Edmun Scarburgh, Justice of the Peace) ordered \"that for any future tyme, noe Englishman shall disturb, molest, or act anything ag'st the sd Indyan King to hindr him in his huntinge, as they will answer the same. In his will dated April 22, 1657, recorded at the county courthouse, Debedeavon left the kingdom to his daughter, Nandua, cautioning her as \"Empress\" to maintain the good will of their English friends. The historic Court House Square in Eastville, Virginia has a monument to \"DEBEDEAVON, A Gallant Warrior And A Loyal Friend To The Early Settlers Of The Eastern Shore.\" Also, Virginia recently erected a historical marker across the street from the Debedeavon monument and old courthouse, remembering the reservation which his tribe occupied for the next 150 years. In 1700, Robert Beverley noted that the Eastern Virginia natives were \"almost wasted\" after the arrival of the Africans, and cannot raise 500 fighting men, although they had eight towns in Accomac, the largest of which was in Northampton, where the Gangascoe (Gingaskins) are \"almost as numerous as all the foregoing put together,\" and they still held land in common as late as 1812, but they were \"driven off during the excitement subsequent to the Nat Turner Insurrection.\""

  "text" : "Adolphos Heinrich Julius Carl \"Dolph\" Heinrichs (28 April 1883 – 24 June 1967) was an Australian rules footballer who played with East Fremantle and North Fremantle in the West Australian Football Association (WAFA). He also represented the Western Australian cricket team in two first-class cricket matches. Heinrichs was born in Germany and immigrated with his family to Australia shortly after his birth. He spent some of his childhood in Victoria but played his junior football in Western Australia, prior to joining East Fremantle in 1899. He played with East Fremantle for two years and then went to the Western Australian goldfields where he played with Kalgoorlie in the 1901 Goldfields Football Association season. The following year he was back in the WAFA, but this time at North Fremantle, who were playing their inaugural season. In 1904, while still with North Fremantle, Heinrich was called up to the state team, for a tour of Victoria and South Australia. He made his interstate debut on 8 August, against Victoria at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, playing from the back pocket. Although a defender, he was tried at full-forward for the match two weeks later against South Australia at Jubilee Oval. He performed well, kicking five of his team's 10 goals in a nine-point win. As a result of his efforts in Adelaide, East Fremantle used him as a forward when he returned to the club in 1905. He was a member of their 1906 premiership winning team, playing with his younger brother Albert. Another brother, Wilhelm, would also later play at East Fremantle. The 1906 grand final win over West Perth was the last of his 60 league games, which had brought 64 goals. He retired as a player but remained in the league for several seasons as an umpire. He was appointed the coach of South Fremantle Football Club mid-way through the 1925 WAFL season. In the 1922/23 cricket season, Heinrichs played his two first-class matches for Western Australia and finished with an impressive average of 63.50 from three innings. This was largely due to his score on debut, 91 not out, against the Marylebone Cricket Club at the WACA Ground in Perth. He had batted at four on that occasion and was promoted to opener for the match against New South Wales at the same venue later in the summer. He was dismissed in both innings, both scores of 12 and 24. Heinrichs worked at the Education Department for many years, teaching in schools across the state. He was the mentor of Australian Test cricketer Ernest Bromley. He later had book published entitled \"The Jubilee Book\", which covers the history of the East Fremantle Football Club up until 1947."

Bishop is also known for her video parodies including \"Going Rogue\" and \"The Ballad of Sarah Palin\" with Lady Bunny. She also is known for her cheeky classical crossover show \"Viva la Diva,\" in which she celebrates the world's most beloved divas, from opera to pop. The 2008 debut of \"Viva la Diva\" at New York's Zipper Theater won a positive review from Gay City News: \"One could almost imagine Bishop as the artistic love child of Eleanor Steber and Bette Midler conceived at the Continental Baths sometime between either diva's appearance there in the early '70s.... Vocally, the 'poperatic' soprano is able to sing scat, belt, and go from chesty growling to high coloratura, jumping registers and genres with the facility of the late Evel Knievel vaulting a pyre of burning cars.\" Bishop has a classical background in opera and toured with Faye Dunaway in the first Broadway national tour of Terrence McNally's Tony Award winning play, Master Class. She has performed in such renowned New York venues as Carnegie Hall, Joe's Pub, Zipper Theatre and Town Hall. Bishop was a nationally televised finalist on the fourth season of America's Got Talent on NBC. She was a co-presenter for the hookies with Leslie Jordan, and has been a guest on the Robin Byrd Show."

At the age of 12, Diego was married to Juana de Luna, also 12 and granddaughter of Álvaro de Luna, as part of a plan by his family to get a hold of the inheritance of Álvaro de Luna. Juana Pimentel, grandmother of Juana de Luna, had tried to prevent the marriage, but had failed because of the intervention of King Henry IV of Castile. In the War of the Castilian Succession, Diego and his father supported Juana la Beltraneja, who lost the battle for the throne. Diego, who had become 2nd Duke of Escalona after the death of his father in October 1474, was pardoned by Isabella I of Castile and allowed to keep his properties. But he wasn't chosen as successor for his father as Grand Master of the Order of Santiago. His wife Juana de Luna died in 1480. Diego remarried in 1484 with Juana Enríquez y Velasco, sister of Fadrique Enríquez, Admiral of Castile. Diego López Pacheco fought as general against the Moors, and was present in the final Siege of Granada in 1492, which ended the Moorish presence in Spain.

  "text" : "Damian Houlihan (born 30 July 1975) is a former Australian rules footballer who played with Collingwood in the Australian Football League (AFL). Houlihan was the first of a set of four brothers to be drafted to the AFL. His younger brothers Adam and Ryan also became league footballers and another brother Josh was briefly on St Kilda's list. A forward, he was picked up by Collingwood with the 15th selection of the 1992 AFL Draft. He kicked three goals with his first three kicks in league football, against Geelong at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. In his fifth AFL game, against Adelaide, he was awarded three Brownlow Medal votes, despite having just 12 disposals. He missed three matches mid season after being suspended for striking Richmond player Chris Naish. By the end of the year he had played 11 games and a back injury would ensure he never made it into the park in 1995. After spending the 1997 season with Tatura in the Goulburn Valley Football League, Houlihan was selected by North Melbourne in the AFL pre-season draft. North Melbourne made their second grand final in three years in 1998 and Houlihan wasn't able to break into the seniors. Delisted by North Melbourne, he went on to have a long career in country football. His greatest performance came in the 2000 Ovens & Murray Football League (OMFL) Grand Final, playing as an assistant coach for his original club Corowa-Rutherglen, when he kicked ten goals. This broke the previous record for an OMFL grand final, which was nine goals by Albury's Doug Strang, and also helped Corowa-Rutherglen to a 108 point win, another league record. Houlihan, who also played at East Burwood and Gisborne, joined Sunbury in 2007. He then played for Keilor in 2008 and was a member of their premiership team that year, again putting in a strong grand final performance. He returned to Sunbury in 2009 and then finished his career with a season at North Bendigo in 2010."

Aaron entered the U.S. foreign service in 1962, where he served as a political and economic officer in Guayaquil, Ecuador. In 1964 he was assigned to the NATO desk at the Department of State. He subsequently served as a political officer to NATO where he worked on the Nuclear Planning Group and on the Non Proliferation Treaty. He then joined the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency where he served as a member of the U.S. Delegation to the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks (SALT, during which Aaron was a key negotiator of an agreement with the Soviet Union to reduce the risk of nuclear weapon accidents. He was then recruited to serve on Henry Kissinger's National Security Council staff during the Nixon administration, from 1972 to 1974. During that time, Aaron drafted NSSM 242 on Nuclear Strategy, which came to be known as the Schlessenger Doctrine. In 1974, on the recommendation of Zbigniew Brzezinski, Aaron became Senator Walter Mondale's legislative assistant. The following year, Aaron was task force leader of the Senate's Select Committee on Intelligence. He was the principal architect of the Committee's recommendations. Aaron would later follow Mondale to the Jimmy Carter Presidential campaign. In 1977, Aaron was asked by Zbigniew Brzezinski, who had been appointed the National Security Advisor, to become Deputy National Security Advisor in the administration of Jimmy Carter. Aaron was one of several former Kissinger aides appointed by Jimmy Carter to foreign policy and defense positions. During his time at the White House, Aaron made a name for himself in foreign policy circles and was recognised as a rising star in the Democratic Party. Aaron was a special envoy to Africa, Latin America, China, Israel and Europe, and became a trusted envoy on Presidential missions. Shortly after Carter's inauguration, Aaron attended the Bilderberg Conference, in which he undertook lengthy private discussions with German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt. In Israel, Aaron worked with Moshe Dayan on the concept of \"autonomy\" for the Palestinians. This concept helped to open the door for the Camp David Agreements, which are understood to have structured peace between Egypt and Israel. Aaron also represented the White House in talks with the Office of French President Valéry Giscard d'Estaing in Paris, as well as with the Cabinet Office at Number 10 Downing Street in London. President Carter tapped Aaron to lead an inter-agency mission to structure an agreement with European nations to deploy U.S. Pershing Missiles and Ground Launched Cruise Missiles in Europe, in response to the deployment of SS-20 Intermediate Missiles by the Soviet Union. He persuaded key governments to accept the U.S. deployments, as well as to seek negotiations with the U.S.S.R. for the future bilateral elimination of the deployments. Aaron was also seen as a tough and sometimes controversial figure. The U.S. Ambassador in Paris complained that he was going behind his back in secret dealings with French President Giscard d'Estaing's office. In 1978, he came head to head with Director of Central Intelligence Turner of the CIA, on Turner's cutbacks and at the CIA. Aaron's image as a \"tough customer\" was intensified during an attack on North Yemen by South Yemen which was backed by the Soviet Union. President Carter, Brzezinski and Cyrus Vance were on a mission to Egypt and Israel. He remained in Washington to coordinate the U.S. response. Aaron's hard-line against Communist expansion led him to push for the dispatch of $400 million in arms to North Yemen. White House staff commented on his tough rule, one staff member was quoted as saying, \"Believe it or not, people were relieved when Brzezinski got back to town\". When Reagan became President in 1981, Aaron moved into the private sector, becoming Vice President for Mergers and Acquisitions at Oppenheimer and Co. and Vice Chairman of Oppenheimer International. Aaron left Oppenheimer in 1985, to write and lecture, but went on to serve on the board of directors of Oppenheimer's Quest for Value Dual Purpose Fund. Over the next several years he published three novels (State Scarlet; Agent of Influence and Crossing By Night) which were translated into ten languages. He also wrote ay television documentary \"The Lessons of the Gulf War\" hosted by former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Adm. William Crowe. He was also a consultant for the 20th Century Fund, from 1990 to 1992. Aaron was involved in the election campaigns of Walter Mondale and Bill Clinton. In Mondale's campaign, Aaron played a leading role as senior consultant on foreign policy and defense. Aaron served in Clinton's foreign policy team during his election campaign. In 1993 he became United States Permanent Representative to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) in Paris, and in 1996 was assigned the additional job of White House Special Envoy for Cryptography. At the OECD he successfully negotiated the Convention to Prohibit Bribery in International Business Transactions. As Special Envoy for Cryptography, Aaron pushed for a global standard that would require computer users with high grade encryption to submit keys to their codes for scrambling data to an independent authority, which would hold them in escrow and make them available to law enforcement only under a court order. At the time, he argued that unbreakable codes in the hands of terrorists would threaten every country's security. However, he was attacked by advocates of privacy rights, who said that the compromise could easily be misused by Governments and corporations. In 1997 he was appointed Under Secretary of Commerce for International Trade, where ironically he negotiated privacy rules with the European Union on the handling of personal data. After Clinton's second term in office, Aaron became senior international advisor at Dorsey & Whitney. He left Dorsey & Whitney in 2003 to join the RAND Corporation as a senior fellow. At RAND, he directs The Center For Middle East Public Policy and recently produced a non fiction book, \"In their Own Words: Voices of Jihad\", published by the RAND Corporation. He is a member of the American Ditchley Foundation, the Atlantic Council, the Council on Foreign Relations, the International League of Human Rights, the National Democratic Institute, and the Pacific Council on International Policy."

Damian Hartard von der Leyen-Hohengeroldseck was the younger brother of Karl Kaspar von der Leyen-Hohengeroldseck, who was Archbishop of Trier from 1652 to 1676. In 1654, Karl Kaspar arranged for Damian Hartard to be made Archdeacon of Karden and provost of the Stift St. Kastor in Karden. He was ordained as a priest at this time. On July 3, 1675, the cathedral chapter of Mainz Cathedral elected Damian Hartard as the new Archbishop of Mainz. The cathedral chapter of Worms Cathedral also selected him as the new Bishop of Worms on July 12, 1675, thus continuing the personal union between the Archbishopric of Mainz and the Bishopric of Worms that had existed since 1663. Pope Clement X confirmed both appointments on February 24, 1676. He was consecrated as a bishop on September 8, 1676 and installed as Bishop of Worms on October 31, 1676. He purchased Neuerburg for his family in 1678. During his reign, the eastern block of the Electoral Palace Mainz was completed. He is buried in Mainz Cathedral."

  "text" : "Daniel \"Dan\" Awde /ɔːd/ (born 22 June 1988 in Hammersmith, London) is a British 400 metres runner and former decathlete who has twice competed at the Summer Olympic Games. In 2002 Awde, who competes for the Woodford Green with Essex Ladies athletics club, won the bronze medal in the under-15 event at the South of England Indoor Pentathlon competition. In 2007 he finished first in the junior event at the inaugural England Combined Events Championships. He was selected to represent Great Britain at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing after his training partner, former World Championship silver medallist Dean Macey, failed to achieve the qualifying standard. Macey subsequently retired from competition. Awde had achieved the decathlon 'B' qualifying standard of 7700 twice, first at the England Championships in Birmingham, where he improved his personal best by 416 points to 7704, then at the European Cup in Finland. Before going to Beijing he had what he described as an \"inspirational\" conversation with two-times Olympic decathlon champion Daley Thompson who is friends with Awde's coach Greg Richards. In the decathlon competition at the 2008 Olympics, Awde finished 21st in the overall standings. The gold medal was won by American Bryan Clay. Awde set a new personal best in the pole vault at 4.90 m, the seventh best result for any athlete in the event. He had the fastest time of any athlete in the 400 metres, his time of 47.16 seconds earning him 950 points. Awde finished with 7516 points, 1275 behind Clay's winning total of 8791. Awde missed the 2010 Commonwealth Games due to injury. He was selected to represent Great Britain in the 2012 Summer Olympics. In the first event (100 m sprint) Daniel won his heat with a personal best of 10.71 seconds but was then forced to withdraw from the competition with a knee injury during the long jump. For the 2014 season Awde switched from the decathlon to the 400 metres, joining coach Chris Zah's training group based at Mile End, and winning a bronze at the UK Indoor Championships. He was subsequently selected for the England 4×400 m relay squad for the 2014 Commonwealth Games in Glasgow, which went on to win gold."

In the early-mid 1960’s he recorded and performed with British Beat groups The MeddyEVILS, The Echoes (backing Dusty Springfield), and The Soul Agents (featuring Rod Stewart). In 1967 he formed his own band The Shinn, which also featured future Uriah Heep bassist Paul Newton, future drummer for The Nice, Brian Davison, and vocalist Eddie Lamb. In 1969 he released two instrumental albums, ‘Departures’, and ‘Temples With Prophets’ (aka 'Don Shinn Takes A Trip'). He was a member of the English band Dada (featuring Elkie Brooks) and appears on their eponymous album released in 1970. He has also worked with Kiki Dee, James Taylor, Engelbert Humperdinck, Stan Tracey, Persian vocalist Parvaneh Farid, Iguana, and Renaissance. He is cited as a pioneer within the progressive rock movement of the late 1960s and early 1970s, and has been acknowledged by British keyboardist/composer Keith Emerson as a major influence. Uriah Heep bassist Paul Newton has also credited Shinn as a mentor and teacher. As of January 2012, unconfirmed reports indicate that Shinn is still musically active and based in the Southampton area of the UK."

Holevas was born οn January 26, 1907 in Tsouka (a village in Phthiotis), and grew up in Makrakomi. He studied Literature and Archaeology at the University of Athens and the University of Thessaloniki. In 1938 he was ordained a priest.

In 1943, he organized a council of priests at Spercheiada. He also founded the Pan-clerical Orthodox Clergy Union, which came to number 4,000 members, and was elected as its General Secretary. After the end of the war, he was persecuted for his collaboration with ELAS: the Synodal Court suspended him from the clergy for three years, and in 1947 he was sent into internal exile in Ikaria. As a philologist and a priest he taught in schools in Lamia, Lavrion, Leros, Archangelos in Rhodes and Nikaia. In 2001 he was honoured by the Holy Synod of the Church of Greece with the Gold Cross of St Paul for his activity during the Resistance. He died on 16 July 2001.

  "text" : "Dina Schneidermann was a Ukrainian-Swedish violinist. She was born in Odessa. She studied violin with David Oistrakh in Moscow. Having married the Bulgarian violin professor Emil Kamilarov (1928-2007), Schneidermann moved to Bulgaria. The couple left Bulgaria in the 1970s, and moved to Uppsala, Sweden, where they lived for the rest of their lives. Schneidermann worked as a solo violinist and music teacher, and toured extensively in Europe, America and Eastern Asia, often together with Emil Kamilarov as Duo Deschka. She performed on the Il Cannone Guarnerius several times, most recently in 1996 at a concert in Uppsala. Schneidermann won first prices at violin concerts in Berlin and Geneva. Several contemporary composers, including Dmitry Kabalevsky, Pancho Vladigerov, Dimitar Christov, Luigi Cortese, Inger Wikström, Håkan Larsson, and Horst Ebenhöh, created music pieces written for her and dedicated to her. In 2002, Schneidermann was awarded the Illis Quorum medal in gold, for her \"long and important work within the Swedish music scene\" ([f]ör sina mångåriga och betydelsefulla insatser inom svenskt musikliv) She was also awarded a Doctor Honoris Causa at the University and Academy of Music in Sofia, Bulgaria, in 1997. In 2011, Dina Schneidermann was initiator of the International Music Festival “Prof. Emil Kamilarov” set in Sofia, Bulgaria, which stages concerts from renowned musicians as well as a multinational competition of young violin talents. The festival takes place annually, beginning on the 22nd of October lasting for a week. Schneidermann died on 9 August, 2016, in Uppsala."

  "text" : "Initially David Barnett was a Special Agent of the U.S. Army Counter Intelligence Corps (CIC)serving with the 308th CIC Detachment in Seoul, Korea in 1958 and January 1959. He served in the S2 - Counter Subversive Section. Barnett was released from the U.S. Army and hired by the CIA in January 1959 staying in Korea approximately a year. This information is generally not offered in the biography of Barnett. He has been deceased for over 10 years. At the time, I served in the S2 - Counter Espionage Section and was offered and declined the position before Barnett accepted the position in January 1959. David Henry Barnett was a CIA officer who was convicted of espionage for the Soviet Union in 1980, becoming only the second CIA officer to be convicted after Edwin Moore II, a retired CIA employee who was arrested by the FBI in 1976 after attempting to sell classified documents to Soviet officials. From the 1960s until 1970, Barnett was employed by the CIA, working in both the United States and Asia. Barnett was stationed in Indonesia from 1967 until 1970 and before that in South Korea. He was also a teacher and wrestling coach at Kiskiminetas Springs School in Saltsburg, PA during the 1970s. After leaving his teaching position at Kiski, Barnett returned to Indonesia to administer a shrimp processing company. But within six years, he had amassed debts of over $100,000 and faced imminent financial ruin. To rectify his problems, Barnett chose to sell classified information to the Soviets. In 1976, he approached KGB officers in Jakarta, Indonesia and offered to sell them the names of CIA assets. Over the next three years in meetings held in the Embassy of the Soviet Union in Vienna, Barnett revealed to the KGB the identities of some 30 CIA officers. Additionally, he handed over a great deal of classified information gathered by the CIA on a clandestine operation, code-named HA/BRINK, that had focused on the acquisition of examples of Soviet military hardware sold to the Indonesians during the Sukarno era, including an SA-2 guidance system, designs for the Whiskey class submarine, the Riga class frigate, the Sverdlov class cruiser, the P-15 Termit anti-ship missile and the Tu-16 Badger bomber. He also compromised CIA operations and informants in Indonesia and South Korea. The Soviets paid him a total of $92,000 for information received between 1976 and 1980. On instructions from his KGB handlers, which included Oleg Kalugin, Barnett applied for staff positions on the Senate and House intelligence committees and the President's Intelligence Advisory Board but was unsuccessful in finding a job. In January 1979, however, he was rehired by the CIA as a contract agent and if undetected, he could have gone on to betray further CIA secrets. Later in the year however, Barnett was identified as a spy thanks to information given by a KGB officer stationed in Jakarta, Col. Vladimir M. Piguzov, who had been recruited as double agent by the CIA. Piguzov himself was betrayed by Aldrich Ames in 1985 and subsequently executed. Barnett was questioned by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and resigned from his CIA job. In October 1980 Barnett pleaded guilty to espionage charges, admitting that he had sold CIA secrets to the Soviets. He was sentenced to 18 years’ imprisonment and was paroled in 1990."

  "text" : "Daniel Abbott (25 April 1682 – 7 November 1760) was a deputy governor of the Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations. The son of Daniel and Margaret (White) Abbott (widow of Thomas D Walling) of Providence in the Rhode Island colony, he was called Daniel Abbott, Jr. when made a freeman of Providence in 1708. He served on the Providence Town Council in 1713, and the same year served as Deputy, which position he held numerous times until the year of his death. In 1720 he was Clerk of the Assembly, and from 1737 to 1738 he was Speaker of the House of Deputies. In 1738 he was elected as Deputy Governor of the colony, and served for two one-year terms, under John Wanton as governor. In 1723 Abbott and his wife deeded a plot of land in Providence for establishing a church \"in the Presbyterian or Congregational way.\" Ten years later, he and two others were appointed by the Assembly to erect a new jail in Providence of the same size as the one in Kings County. Early in 1740 he was given 20 pounds for his time and expense in revising and renewing the boundary line between the Rhode Island and Connecticut colonies, and later that year he was on a committee to determine the boundaries between the Rhode Island and Massachusetts colonies. In 1741 he and two others were appointed to set off a part of Warwick to establish the town of Coventry. Abbott married Mary Fenner, the daughter of Major Thomas Fenner and Dinah Borden. His wife predeceased him on 7 January 1759. The couple had no children, so much of his estate was left to his Fenner relatives. Executors of his will were two future Deputy Governors of the colony, Jabez Bowen and Darius Sessions. Daniel and Mary Abbott are buried in the North Burial Ground, Providence, Rhode Island."

  "text" : "Dave Stephens first came to public attention in the mid-1970s as a performance artist. After leaving Leeds Polytechnic where he studied Fine Art under Jeff Nuttal, Roland Miller and John Darling he joined John Bull Puncture Repair Kit and toured Britain and Europe. On leaving John Bull he teamed up with Ian Hinchliffe to form an ongoing performance relationship which was like a visual and verbal tour through the absurdist imagination of the two performers. By the late 70s Stephens had broken away from other performers to concentrate on his career as a solo performer. Often credited with being one of the forerunners of what was to become innovative alternative comedy his solo work was typified by unique and expressive monologues that had foundations as much in science fiction and Edgar Allan Poe as in the theatre of the absurd and Samuel Beckett. Stephens performed in well over 100 venues throughout his career and toured most of Europe as well as Canada and the USA. Giving up performance in the mid 80s, Stephens turned his attention to the more formal elements of sculpture. The work from this period and into the 90s explores the interaction between everyday objects such as furniture with the makeshift structures that are created by such creatures as wasps. Largely the work was made up of large structures created from huge piles of small wood chips. He had solo exhibitions at such spaces as the Laing Gallery in Newcastle, Worthing Museum and the Economist Building, London. Recent work has been concentrating on the way that surface pattern can affect the overall structure. There is a breaking down of the piece into a series of small sections but the surface pattern reunites these. His recent work has been described as exploring \"the tensions between incidental encounters and economies of dispersal, which are increasingly relevant in a globalised world\". Throughout Stephens' career there has been a constant concern about how the small and the large are dependent on each other for form, structure and texture. In his original work as a performance artist in the 1970s, words were used to brush the air into monologues that had both literal and abstract meaning. Throughout the 90's his wood chip sculptures used the premise that a structure was born out of a necessity to support itself. Similarly his new series of work looks at the way that mysteries can be associated with clues as a way to punctuate their form. Alongside his sculpture work and solo projects Stephens has worked on a series of collaborative film projects with Matt Page and the experimental musician Steve Beresford. Experiments have looked at stop motion animation and real time film. These films often explore the production of an art work. The films take the form of an amorphous visual experience that records an object's creation and development. Stephens continues to work and exhibit with regular exhibitions centring on his base at Phoenix Brighton."

With an extensive academic curriculum as rector at the University of Paris, he served King Manuel I and king John III of Portugal, whom he advised on the creation of captaincies in Brazil and the coming of the first Jesuit missionaries and notably Francis Xavier. First of a lineage of distinguished humanists and educators, he was the uncle of André de Gouveia, António de Gouveia, Diogo de Gouveia \"the younger\", and Marcial de Gouveia. During the Counter-Reformation he was a strong supporter of scholastic and Catholic orthodoxy, clashing with the liberal views of his nephew André de Gouveia."

Fulton has produced several documentary films about violins and music. The first was Homage (2008), which won the 2009 Juno award as \"Classical Album of the Year: Solo or Chamber Ensemble\". The film features violinist, James Ehnes, performing on fourteen instruments from Fulton's collection. The second, Violin Masters: Two Gentlemen of Cremona, (2010), narrated by Alfred Molina and featuring renowned violinists James Ehnes, Joshua Bell, Midori, Itzhak Perlman among others, examines the history and modern use of Stradivari and Guarneri del Gesù violins.

  "text" : "David King is an English composer and producer of musical theatre. King has achieved international popular success in musical theatre, and his management of 20 theatre companies performing around the world has been referred to as \"one of the biggest dance organisations in Britain, and certainly the largest in light entertainment.\" His first musical Spirit of the Dance has been running for 15 years in theatres across the globe since its debut at Bristol Hippodrome. Spirit of the Dance soon became one of the world's biggest dance shows and, in the period 1998 to 2000, there were 14 different troupes simultaneously performing the show in 14 different countries. It has received nine global awards, including best choreography and best international production, and has been seen by 30 million people worldwide. It has broken box office records in 15 countries. King has been said to be on a mission to bring musicals to the masses and his business model has been described as unique. His international production company, Spirit Productions, currently has around 20 shows on global tour.He employs around 500 dancers, singers and technical crew and owns two theatres in which his companies play for most of the year; the 2,600 capacity Palace Theatre in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, and the Branson Variety Theatre in Branson, Missouri. In 2012, King secured a third theatre, the newly constructed Broadway Theatre in the New York-New York Hotel & Casino on the Las Vegas Strip. King's American operations are handled from his US headquarters, located at his theatre in Myrtle Beach. King has several ongoing contracts to supply major casinos in the US with entertainment. He is also one of the principal suppliers of entertainment to the Casino de Monte Carlo in Monaco and he has recently produced an erotic burlesque show which is running indefinitely at the adjoining Cabaret nightclub. King's companies tour the US, Europe, Australia and the Far East constantly. In 2011, he was the subject of a six episode television documentary about his work producing shows. Dancing King: Man in the Mirror was commissioned by Discovery Networks UK. In September 2011, the show was broadcast on ABC2 in Australia. In 2012, King took part in the UK TV show Secret Millionaire and was the victim of a carjacking while filming undercover. His episode, in which he donated money to three community groups in Leeds, launched the 2012 series on Channel 4. In August 2012, the car thief was jailed for one year for the offence when he appeared at Leeds Crown Court. He was sentenced to a further seven years in jail for causing the death by dangerous driving of a taxi driver. In September 2012 he claimed a world first when he simultaneously opened two new shows on opposite sides of the Atlantic."

  "text" : "Diego Fuentes (full name: Diego Antonio Fuentes Lopez) is a Canadian actor of Chilean descent and Toronto socialite. He was MuchMusic's first ever VJ Search winner in 1995, going on to host the popular Clip Trip show on MuchMusic's sister station, MuchMoreMusic. He has an extensive resume of film, TV, and stage performances. Most notably, he portrayed the character of Natividad Vacio in the 2007 film Hollywoodland. He played fan-favourite Bruno Dias on Global TV's medical drama, Remedy from 2014-15. He was a resident DJ on \"Terrible Tuesdays\" at the then popular Queenshead Pub in Toronto from 2003-2005. While originally performing as 'Diego Fuentes', he adopted the moniker 'Mexico 2000' to the delight of his fans. He is a known advocate for customer rights in fast food restaurants and taxi services in the Greater Toronto Area, as well as a staunch supporter of water conservation. He enjoys roller skating. In 2011, he appeared in the Drive One Series commercials of Ford Cars coining the catchy phrase \"Who wants to stop for gas? I don't.\" On May 12, 2012, Fuentes was lead skip of a local curling team that went on to win the Gabby's 2012 annual Bonspiel held at the High Park Curling Club. He reminded his team members that he won OFSAA with his high school curling team just before making the final shot to seal the victory. The team completed the tournament with 4 wins, 0 losses and 0 ties. On April 10, 2015, Fuentes was the answer to #30 across in the Metro Toronto daily crossword. The clue was \"Remedy\" on Global TV star, Diego __ (Trivia! He won the first VJ Search for MuchMusic in 1995). On May 1, 2015, in a lesser publicized incident than the Sony Pictures Entertainment hack, Fuentes' personal email account was compromised and his contact list was spammed. Within minutes of the violation, Fuentes proactively alerted his followers that the email was not authored by himself and not to open any attachments contained in the message. It is unknown if any computer virus or malware was spread as a result of the rogue communication. Throughout 2015, he championed a campaign to feed the homeless and clean up Toronto city streets known as \"Mexico's Children\". In early December, there was an incident outside a Toronto Coffee Time where he was reportedly spit on after offering a woman a bagel with cream cheese. The police were called but no charges or arrests were made. In January 2016, Fuentes was interviewed by a local newspaper which was doing a feature on a curling night held at Fuentes local club. While it is common knowledge that Fuentes is a highly skilled curler, the article included tidbits of information on how and why he came to love the sport. His enthusiasm for the sport is highlighted in his quote that \"curling is an incredible sport because drinking is involved\"."

  "text" : "Maharajadhiraj Mirza Maharao Shri Deshalji II Sahib Bahadur (b 1814- d 1860) (reign: 1819-1860) was the Rao of Cutch belonging to Jadeja dynasty, who ascended the throne of Princely State of Cutch upon deposition of his father Bharmalji II by British. He reigned during his minority, under a Council of Regency, headed by Captain MacMurdo and composed of Jadeja chiefs. Before, his ascension of throne in 1819 at behest of British & other Jadeja detractors, his father Rao Bharmalji II, was defeated by joint British & Gaekwad army in 1815 and Kutch accepted suzerainty of British in 1818 and was compelled to accept a British Resident at his court in Bhuj. During his reign Kutch suffered a severe earthquake in 1819 followed by severe famine in 1823, 1825 & 1832. Further, Kutch was attacked by marauding band from Sindh. Rao Deshalji and his Dewan Devkaran with their mediocre power and the support of their brethren defeated Kesarkhan and Sher Bulandkhan the Muslim marauding band. Also they defeated the evil designs of Sindh’s Nagarparkar. Deshalji although 18 years of age took the management of law in his own hands. The trade with Africa especially Zanzibar improved significantly. Slowly and steadily the industrialization in Kutch got a set back which was started by Lakhpatji and Godji. The maritime trade with Zanzibar and Oman grew. Also the glass factory started during reign of Lakhpatji by Ram Singh Malam at Madhapar helped industrialization. Further, breeding of good quality Kutchi horses was also encouraged by Deshaliji, which brought in fair amount of revenue. In the period of Deshalji II steps were taken to suppress infanticide, sati and the slave trade in the State. The educational system was also improved. He had eight wives and several sons of which Pragmalji II was declared Yuvraj by him, who ascended the throne after his death in 1860. One of his queens is responsible for erection of present day temples at Narayan Sarovar. Rao Deshalji II came of age in 1834 and was invested with full ruling powers but in later life, due to ill health, he transferred his ruling power to his son & successor Pragmalji II in 1859 one year before his death."

  "text" : "David Perkins Page (1810–1848) was an American educator and author of the most popular 19th-century American education textbook. From 1844 to 1847, he served as the first principal of the New York State Normal School, which later became University at Albany, SUNY. Page was born to a farm family in Epping, New Hampshire on July 4, 1810. As a child, he begged his father to let him attend the nearby Hampton Academy, but his father refused, because he did not consider a school education necessary for a farmer. However, after Page contracted a nearly fatal illness in 1826 at the age of 16, his father relented. Page then attended the academy for a few months at age 17, advanced sufficiently to obtain a teacher's license, and taught for a term in local schools in order to fund his further studies. He then returned to the Hampton Academy and studied for an additional year. In the winter of 1829, at the age of 19, Page began teaching in a country school in Newbury, Massachusetts. After the winter term, he founded his own private school, beginning with five pupils. In March 1832, he was chosen to become Associate Principal of the new Newburyport high school, where he headed the English Department. In Massachusetts high schools in the early 19th century, the English Department was the half of the high school with a practical focus, and was distinct from the Classical Department which focused on preparing students for college by focusing on Latin and Greek. In August 1838, Page delivered an address before the American Institute of Instruction on the topic of \"Duties of Parents and Teachers\". Horace Mann, who was in the audience, stated that this was the finest speech delivered before the Institute in its history, and arranged to have 6,000 copies printed and circulated to Massachusetts teachers. Page became a frequent contributor to Mann's Common School Journal. In December 1844, Page was selected to be the first principal of the new New York State Normal School in Albany, New York. The state legislature had appropriated funds for the school in the previous year, based on the example of Mann's school in Massachusetts, and sought out Page on Mann's recommendation. The project faced stiff political opposition, and throughout the following years, Page spent much of his time traveling around New York shoring up support for the Normal School. In 1847, Page published his only book, Theory and Practice of Teaching. It became extremely popular in the growing normal school movement, and had been printed in 25 editions by 1864. By the time the copyright had expired in 1889, more than 100,000 copies had been sold and it was the most widely used textbook in American teacher education. Page fell ill near the end of the autumn 1847 term. His illness was widely attributed to exhaustion from the effort expended in defending the Normal School. He died of pneumonia on January 1, 1848, and was buried according to his wishes in Newburyport."

In 1752 accepted an invitation to minister to the Independent congregation at Common Close in Warminster, Wiltshire. While in Warminster, he ran a school. In 1771 he was appointed the resident tutor in classics and mathematics at Homerton College. Following the death of John Conder in 1781 he was appointed theology tutor, from 1781 to 1803. He was a rigid Calvinist and staunch dissenter. His students included Ezekiel Blomfield. He died at Hackney on 14 August 1807 after a lingering illness, in which he lost the use of all his faculties. Two funeral sermons were preached on the occasion, one of which, by the Rev. Samuel Palmer, was published under the title of The General Union of Believers (1807). Fisher was buried at Bunhill Fields burial ground."

After smuggling the tapes of the interviews out of Tibet, however, Dhondup Wangchen and Jigme Gyatso were detained during the 2008 Tibetan unrest. Dhondup Wangchen was sentenced to six years' imprisonment for subversion. Numerous international human rights organizations protested his detention, including Amnesty International, which named him a prisoner of conscience. In 2012, he was awarded the International Press Freedom Award of the US-based Committee to Protect Journalists. He served his full six-year sentence and was released from prison on 5 June 2014."

Kellner was one of the first proponents of a voter verifiable paper audit trail for electronic voting machines. He was the leader of the opposition to New York City’s contract to purchase unverifiable direct recording electronic voting machines. Kellner is a partner in the law firm of Kellner Herlihy Getty & Friedman, LLP. He specializes in the area of Real Estate Litigation and represents a large number of tenants groups, cooperatives, and some non-profit institutional landlords. Kellner received considerable attention in 1986 when he revived New York’s Bawdy House Law, first enacted in 1840, and used it as a device where neighbors could seek to evict drug dealers. His use of this overlooked law for that purpose was quickly copied by district attorneys and housing authorities throughout the country."

  "text" : "Donald Barron Krim (October 5, 1945, Newton, Massachusetts – May 20, 2011, Manhattan) was an American film distributor. He bought Kino International in 1977 and thereafter served as the company's president until his death of cancer in Manhattan at the age of 65 in 2011. As the President of Kino International, Krim helped introduce some of the world's most revered film directors to American audiences; among many others, Wong Kar-Wai (Happy Together; Fallen Angels); Michael Haneke (The Piano Teacher); Amos Gitai (Kippur; Kadosh); Aki Kaurismäki (The Match Factory Girl; Ariel); Julie Dash (Daughters of the Dust); and Andrei Zvyagintsev (The Return). Krim received his bachelor's degree in American History from Columbia University in 1967 and obtained his law degree, also from Columbia, in 1971. After law school, he began his career at United Artists, first becoming head of the 16mm nontheatrical film rental division, then working on the formation of United Artists Classics, the first major studio-owned, art house division—and the model for today's Fox Searchlight and Sony Pictures Classics. In 2000, Krim received the Mel Novikoff Award from the San Francisco International Film Festival, for his work to \"enhance the filmgoing public's knowledge and appreciation of world cinema;\" and in 2006, he was the recipient of the prestigious William K. Everson Award for Film History, given by the National Board of Review. On that same year, the Anthology Film Archives bestowed Krim with a Film Preservation Honors Award. In 2009, he received \"The Visionary Award\" at the 24th Annual Israel Film Festival. In addition, Krim was personally responsible for all aspects of two re-releases of two different restorations of Fritz Lang's Metropolis—one in 2002, marking the film's 75th anniversary, and the other in 2010, triggered by a major archival discovery. Other classic reissues he helped to make viable include Alexander Korda's The Thief of Bagdad; the first reissue of Pandora's Box and Diary of a Lost Girl; Von Stroheim's Queen Kelly; the 50th anniversary restoration of The Bicycle Thief; and recent high-def restorations of Sergei Eisenstein's Battleship Potemkin and Albert Parker's The Black Pirate. It was announced in December 2009 that Kino International had merged with Lorber HT Digital to form a new corporate entity, Kino Lorber, Inc. Together with Lorber President Richard Lorber, Krim served as Co-President of the new company until his death in 2011."

  "text" : "David Moniac (December 1802 – November 21, 1836) (Creek) was an American military officer and in 1822 was an early Native American graduate of the United States Military Academy. A Creek with some Scots ancestry, who was related to major Creek leaders on both sides of his family, Moniac was the first cadet to West Point from the new state of Alabama. Moniac resigned his commission in 1822 to manage his clan's property in Alabama, where he developed a cotton plantation. In the Second Seminole War in 1836, Moniac was commissioned as a captain and selected to command a Creek volunteer cavalry unit, the only Native American among the officers. He was killed at the Battle of Wahoo Swamp. In the 1990s, his remains were transferred from a local cemetery to the newly established Florida National Cemetery for military veterans, a few miles away."

  "text" : "David Waweru is the CEO of WordAlive Publishers based out of Nairobi, Kenya. According to his website he refers to himself as a \"publisher, trainer, coach, and speaker\". WordAlive Publishers was founded in September 2001. David Waweru has been active in advocating for a strong and vibrant local publishing industry and reading culture in East Africa. In interviews with Nation TV and Business Daily, David alludes that though the Kenyan book trade has faced major challenges in the last couple of years, the market will recover. Museum of Learning indicates David Waweru saw a need in Trade and Christian publishing that few were willing risk investment in due to a perceived poor reading culture in most of sub-Saharan Africa. In an article titled, \"A Literary Contribution to Healing\" in the Daily Nation, David Waweru said “We cannot always complain about a poor reading culture,” he said. “It is up to us to expand the horizons and give people what they want to read.” The Christian Marketplace quoted David as saying that \"there is potential for indigenous writers and publishers\" during the release of Eyo, by Nigerian writer Abidemi Sanusi. In an article \"Publisher Keeps the Word Alive\" by Business Daily, David talked about ingenuity in promoting Africa authors through events like author tours, book signings, launches and a consistent author branding programme. Events, dubbed BookTalkAfrica have already been held in Nairobi and Kampala where people queued waiting to speak to their favourite authors."

  "text" : "David Bandinel (died 1644–5) was dean of Jersey. Bandinel, the date of whose birth is uncertain, but who is supposed to have been of Italian descent, was appointed to the office of dean of Jersey on its revival by James I, about 1623. John Paulet had been dean of the Channel Islands in Queen Mary's reign, when, if Heylin is to be believed, the persecution of Protestants was carried to even greater excesses in this dependency than elsewhere. He retained the office till 1565, after which time, in consequence of the immigration of persecuted French Protestants, the islands were inundated by a flood of Calvinism, and threw off almost entirely their allegiance to the church of England. The diaconal office consequently lapsed, the discipline of John Calvin being observed under the direction of a consistory—a colloque and a synod. James I, on the understanding that this arrangement had been formally sanctioned by Elizabeth, confirmed it in the first year of his reign. He soon, however, repented of his decision, and appointed a governor, Sir John Peyton, who was expressly charged with the duty of urging a return to unity with the English church. Peyton's measures, provoking a storm of anger and irritation, resulted in an appeal to the court of England, whereupon Archbishop Abbot commanded the islanders, in the name of the king, to adopt again the English liturgy and make use of the Book of Common Prayer in all their churches. This act of authority met with resistance which, however, after a time relaxed, and by the twenty-first year of James's reign the opinions of the inhabitants had become so far modified that an address, drawn up by Bandinel in conjunction with others of the clergy, was presented to the king, begging him to restore the office of dean and the use of the liturgy. Upon this Bandinel was appointed dean, with instructions to draw up, for submission to the king, a body of canons agreeable to the discipline of the church of England, which were referred to a commission consisting of Archbishop Abbot, the lord keeper Williams, and Andrewes, bishop of Winchester. These were, after modification, confirmed, and the islands were placed under the jurisdiction of the dean, subject to the Bishop of Winchester, in whose diocese they were declared to be. The chief personal interest of Bandinel's life lies in the part he took in the dissensions which convulsed the island at the time of the great civil troubles in England, his quarrel with the Carterets, and consequent tragical end. Sir Philip de Carteret was appointed Lieutenant Governor of Jersey by Charles I, and, although a zealous Protestant, was always an ardent loyalist. He is said to have been a man of ability and integrity, but of austere manners, and he was accused by his enemies of absorbing all the more lucrative offices in the island. He is charged with having attempted to deprive the dean of part of his tithes, an aggression that roused in Bandinel an animosity to the lieutenant-governor, which was fostered by subsequent events, and which endured throughout his life. At the time of the civil war in England, Bandinel was considered the head of the parliamentary party in Jersey, whose cause he is said to have espoused chiefly out of opposition to the leading loyalist Carteret. When the parties were in conflict in the island, Bandinel kept back all supplies from the fortresses of Elizabeth Castle and Mont Orgueil, where the lieutenant-governor and his wife were shut up. The rigours and mortifications which he had to endure brought Carteret to his grave, and in his last illness Bandinel evinced the bitterness of his enmity by refusing all spiritual and material comforts to the dying man, keeping even his wife from him until the last moment. On Carteret's death, in 1643, his nephew, Sir George Carteret, was appointed by the king lieutenant-governor in his stead, and he gratified at the same time his resentment for the treatment of his father, and his loyal zeal, by arresting Bandinel and his son on a charge of treason. They were confined first in Elizabeth Castle and afterwards in Mont Orgueil, where, after more than twelve months' imprisonment, they formed a plan for escape. Having made a line of their bed-linen and such other material as they could procure, on the night of 10 Feb. 1644–5 they forced their way through the grating of their cell, and proceeded to lower themselves down the side of their prison. The son succeeded in reaching the end of the line, which, however, being too short, he fell and was seriously injured; but the dean, by his weight breaking the line, fell from a great height on to the rocks below, where he was discovered insensible by a sentinel on the following morning, and only lingered to the next day, when he died. His son escaped for a time, but was recaptured and died in prison. Dean Bandinel was also one of the rectors of the island, from which office, however, he derived but small emolument."

  "text" : "Daniel Bonventre (born c. 1944) is one of five former Madoff employees charged in the Madoff investment scandal. He had worked as one-time company director of operations and as an accountant for Madoff since the 1960s. He was arrested on February 25, 2010 and charged with allegedly having created false and fraudulent books and records, conspiracy, securities fraud, and tax-related charges. He is also being sued by the SEC for falsifying records. Prosecutors claim that Bonventre used $154 million of clients' funds to help obtain a $145 million loan. He has also been charged with concealing over $270,000 in income tax between 2003 and 2007. Another criminal complaint alleges that he helped to arrange millions in illegal payments and loans to Madoff family members and unidentified employees, some of which were used to purchase luxury homes. In April 2006, almost three years before other investors lost their life savings, Bonventre emptied his personal accounts at the firm. On March 24, 2014, he was convicted. He may be sentenced to a maximum of 77 years in prison if convicted. On February 25, 2010, he was freed on a $5 million bond. On December 21, 2010, prosecutors sent a letter to Bonventre's defense lawyer, Andrew J. Frisch, demanding that none of the $820,000 given to him to defend the case be used. The reason for this is because the funds would be subject to forfeiture if Bonventre is convicted of criminal charges. In January 2011, Bonventre filed a suit demanding that the indictment against him be dismissed because the prosecutor had made efforts to seize his defense funds. On December 8 2014, Bonventre was sentenced to 10 years in prison after being convicted on securities fraud and tax-evasion charges for his involvement in Madoff's $17.5 billion fraud."

Penner also had been a singer, guitar player, and recording artist. In 1956, Penner switched from country music to rock & roll. That same year, he and Wade Moore (born November 15, 1934 in Amarillo, Texas) formed a duo and recorded for Sun Records. The duo was known as \"Wade & Dick—The College Kids.\" Wade & Dick recorded three songs (with guitarist Don Gililland), \"Wild Woman,\" \"Don't Need Your Lovin',\" and \"Bop Bop Baby,\" which was included on the soundtrack of \"Walk the Line,\" the film biography of Johnny Cash. Penner recorded four on his own (with guitarist \"Gypsy\" Bob Izer). All four songs exhibited a hard, youthful edge that was targeted towards the then new teen market. Penner's four singles — (i) \"Move Baby Move,\" (ii) \"Fine Little Baby,\" Sun 615a, and (iii) \"Cindy Lou,\" and (iv) \"Honey Love\" Sun 282 consisted of both Rockabilly and ballads. The songs did not rise to the popularity of \"Ooby Dooby;\" which reached a formidable level on the national charts in Orbison's hands and, eventually, became regarded as a classic of the genre. Moore was in business following his college graduation. After receiving his M.A. from North Texas State, Penner earned a Ph.D. from the University of Colorado. He was a professor of English at the University of Tennessee for thirty-two years until his retirement in 1990. Penner authored three academic books, his favorite being Fiction of the Absurd."

  "text" : "Davide Cesare, also known as Dax (1977 - March 16, 2003) was an Italian anti-fascist activist from Rozzano, who was stabbed to death by two far-right activists in Milan, the night of March 16, 2003. Cesare was brought to the hospital but died in the ambulance. Immediately after his death, members of his group tried to enter the hospital but were blocked by the police. This resulted in new riots with several people being injured, damage to police cars, and the emergency department suspending all activities for the whole night. Cesare's death and the following trial had a wide political resonance in far-left circles, both in Italy and abroad. This was partly because the Italian media initially portrayed the events as a \"riot between young dissidents\" and, according to some sources, deliberately misrepresented Cesare's death as \"a consequence of anti-globalization violence\". During the trial, it turned out that brothers Federico Morbi and Mattia Morbi, the aggressors of Cesare, had in fact assaulted and killed him with premeditation. They were declared guilty in May 2004; Federico was sentenced to 16 years in jail, while Mattia (who was a minor at the time of the facts) was sentenced to 3 years. Giorgio Morbi, father of Federico and Mattia, was also judged guilty of attempted murder for beating a companion of Cesare on the same night. One of the lawyers that represented the family of Cesare in the trial was Giuliano Pisapia, who would later become Mayor of Milan (assumed office in June 1, 2011). A plaque has been placed in Via Brioschi (the street of Milan where he was killed). Graffiti in memory of Dax are quite common in Milan, but have also appeared elsewhere and abroad; they usually read \"Dax vive\" (\"Dax lives\", in Italian) or \"Dax odia ancora\" (\"Dax still hates\"). One of these graffiti, portraying Cesare's face, used to be painted on the Darsena in Milan, former port of the Navigli canal system; its removal by Milan's cleansing department in 2007 was subject to much controversy and was strongly condemned both by activist associations and by members of the government."

  "text" : "David Alexander Mulholland (1938 – 10 December 2003) was a Northern Irish loyalist paramilitary, known to the security forces for his alleged involvement in bombing attacks. He was a member of the Ulster Volunteer Force's Mid-Ulster Brigade and was a prime suspect in the 1974 Dublin car bombings. He was named as the driver of the first of the three car bombs which exploded minutes apart in the city centre of Dublin on 17 May 1974 and left a total of 26 people dead and almost 300 injured. He was identified from police file photographs by three separate eyewitnesses during the investigation into the bombings by the Garda Síochána. According to journalist Joe Tiernan, he was offered immunity from prosecution by the Gardaí in exchange for information on his accomplices."

In 2014 He released his second album The Iodine Trade, a Ballardian collection of songs, spoken word and sound collage.  In 2010, he released his debut album In Puget Sound. The album was reviewed in both local press and national publications.  Comparisons were drawn with the work of American film-maker David Lynch, due to In Puget Sound's 'other-worldly' atmosphere. D. Gwalia's second album, The Iodine Trade, was described as 'Ballardian' -  In 2015 Journalist Neil Cooper writing for the List magazine stated \"D. Gwalia has cut a shadowy figure around the unsung sidelines of Edinburgh's myriad low-key music scenes. Originally from Wales before taking a peripatetic path to Oxford, Gwalia's cracked folk and strung-out gothica was first heard on his 2010 debut, 'In Puget Sound.' This follow-up digital-only release charts even starker terrain in a bleak compendium of scratched-out song collages and apocalyptic portents which conjure up the strung-out ghosts of post Pink Floyd Syd Barrett at his most insular, all whimsy lost\" \"...here, however, Gwalia sounds abandoned, left foraging in the dirt of a Ballardian nothing-scape\" Neil Cooper, The List Magazine Feb 2015"
