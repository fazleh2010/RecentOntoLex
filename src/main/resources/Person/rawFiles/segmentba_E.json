The chronicle was used by later historians, but only a few fragments remain preserved in Evagrius Scholasticus, the Suda and John Malalas. According to Evagrius, Eustathius's work was an epitome (a compilation, not an abridgement) of pagan and ecclesiastical writers. Eustathius is also known to have compiled an epitome of Josephus (Historikon of the Judaean Archaeology by Iosepos). It is likely the same as a short 13th/14th-century text preserved in Paris. It begins with Adam and Eve and reaches to the reign of Vespasian and Titus."

Ellis's older brother Edward (1568–1650) became master of the choristers at Cambridge. Ellis Gibbons was evidently counted as having promise by his contemporaries: at the age of 28 he became the only composer, other than the editor Thomas Morley himself, to contribute two madrigals to The Triumphs of Oriana, a collection of 25 madrigals published in 1601, although the American musicologist Joseph Kerman (in his 1962 comparative study of the English madrigal) states that \"possibly one of the two is by Edward Gibbons.\" Ellis Gibbons was never, and could not have been, organist of Salisbury cathedral as is recorded in some Georgian reference works."

She was a member of the DAR’s Peace Pipe Chapter and served as Colorado State Regent from 1950–1953. Braerton was born on January 14, 1884 in Council Grove, Kansas to Albert Eugene Gibson (Tiffin, Ohio 1851–1909) and Lillian Griffith (Tiffin, Ohio 1851–1939). She was the great niece of William Harvey Gibson, the \"Silver Tongued Orator\" and Union Army Brigadier General from Ohio. She was a direct descendant of Colonel John Gibson, a U.S. Revolutionary officer and of Robert Coe, who arrived in Boston in 1634. She attended the University of Kansas in 1902–1903. During Braerton’s tenure as national vice president, the DAR worked to redress denying Marian Anderson the right to perform at Constitution Hall in 1939. On 14 March 1953, Anderson sang to an unsegregated audience in Constitution Hall as part of the American University concert series. This performance was repeated at Constitution Hall on 1 April 1956. On 24 October 1964, Anderson began her farewell American tour from Constitution Hall. Braerton was particularly supportive of issues concerning the disabled. She was the mother of five daughters (Emily Louise, Lillian Joan, Mary Lee, Susan Frances, and Lucy Jean), one of whom died in infancy and another one suffered from cerebral palsy caused by premature birth. She was married to Warder Lee Braerton, a law graduate of the University of Kansas (1903) and partner in Braerton, Simonton & Brown Insurance based in Denver, Colorado."

His architectural lettering work included the foundation stone for Churchill College, Cambridge (1961), and the Flaxman lettering and numbering system for New Scotland Yard’s rotating sign (1968), Wright's original concept for which was that its '‘revolving triangular shape and reflective steel lettering was symbolic of the Met’s constant vigilance in guarding our safety.' in 1963, Wright was a signatory of Ken Garland's First Things First manifesto."

  "text" : "Louis-Ernest Lafont (26 July 1879, Lyon – 7 May 1946, Paris) was a French socialist politician. Lafont represented Loire in the French National Assembly between 1914 and 1928, and then Hautes-Alpes between 1928 and 1936. He served as Minister of Public Health 1935-1936. Politically, he was a disciple of Hubert Lagardelle. A lawyer by profession from a bourgeois background, Lafont was a graduate of the Ecole des sciences politiques and a lawyer at the Paris Court of Appeals. He obtained a doctorate in Law. He served as the legal attorney of the General Confederation of Labour (CGT). Inside French Section of the Workers International (SFIO), Lafont belonged to the insurrectionary syndicalist and anti-parliamentary left. In 1910 he contested the parliamentary elections, but trailed behind the winning candidate by merely 500 votes. In 1912 he became the mayor of the socialist local government in Firminy. In 1914 he was elected to the French parliament from the Le Chambon-Feugerolles constituency, with 11,256 votes. During this period Lafont was able to mobilize sizeable support from the middle class of Firminy, particularly through campaigns against alcoholism and prostitution. Lafont was re-elected to parliament in 1919, the sole Guesdist deputy from Loire. Lafont travelled to Petrograd in July 1920, seeking to participate in the second congress of the Communist International. However, he was expelled from Russia on Trotsky's orders. Lafont had been accused of contacts with the Polish Socialist Party. Lafont did however become a member of the French Communist Party in the same year. He was expelled from the party in 1923, due to his links to the League for Human Rights. Lafont joined the Socialist-Communist Union. He was the sole candidate of that party elected in the 1928 French National Assembly election. In the late 1920s, Lafont was one of the more radical profiles in the League for Human Rights, advocating labour rights and pacifism. Lafont was named Minister of Public Health in the cabinets of Fernand Bouisson and Pierre Laval, formed in 1935. Notably, Laval's first employment had been as the secretary of Lafont whilst Lafont had worked as a lawyer for the CGT. Lafont's cabinet tenures lasted between June 1, 1935 and June 7, 1935 in the Bouisson cabinet and between June 7, 1935 and January 24, 1936 in Laval's government. His participation in the national government led to him being expelled socialist parliamentary group. In 1936, he lost his parliamentary seat to the SFIO candidate Auguste Muret (the mayor of Gap). He was married to Zinaida Lafont. Lafont died on May 7, 1946 in the Seventh arrondissement of Paris, at the age of 66."

He was selected as Deputy from Woburn to the Massachusetts General Court (the colonial legislature) almost every year from 1646 on. Johnson was the first military officer commissioned in Woburn, and was one of the founders of the Ancient and Honorable Artillery Company of Massachusetts. He served as an ensign in Cooke's Company in the Pequot War, served as lieutenant for the Middlesex County Troop in 1643, and was made captain in 1644. He served as Surveyor General of the military stores of the colony in 1659. Johnson is regarded as the author of the first printed history of New England, The Wonderworking Providence of Sion's Savior in New England, which was published in England in 1654. Johnson was selected by the General Court to make the first map of Massachusetts. He established the boundary between Massachusetts and New Hampshire, and also laid out the boundaries of Woburn and other towns."

He was the editor-in-chief of Norsk Ukeblad from 1934 til 1952 and Hjemmet from 1952 to 1964. From 1965 to 1976 he worked for the publishing house Gutenbergshus, where he was responsible for the comic Donald Duck & Co. During the occupation of Norway by Nazi Germany he was a controversial figure among the occupying Germans. His magazine was responsible for the comic 91 Stomperud, which had run since 1937 with Gervin as the textwriter. In 1942 it was found that 91 Stomperud mocked the occupying forces, and Norsk Ukeblad was stopped for four weeks. He was later imprisoned with caricaturer Gunnar Bratlie for a caricature of Vidkun Quisling in Norsk Ukeblad in February 1943 (#8). The caricature portrayed Quisling as an unsteady ice skating boy, who was being helped to stand up by a man with a Hitler moustache. He was imprisoned in Grini concentration camp from 23 February to 24 May 1943. In 1963 there was a mild controversy when the Donald Duck comic story Lost in the Andes! was translated and printed in Norway as Eggemysteriet (\"the Egg Mystery\"). The translator Vivi Aagaard chose an archaic and slightly garbled version of the Norwegian language form Nynorsk for the mountain-dwellers, and this was widely seen as an insult. Thus, through the Norwegian language struggle, the story got quite a lot of attention in Norwegian media. Gervin died in January 1978 and was buried in Ullern."

  "text" : "Erik Hafslo Qvam (12 September 1897 – 13 April 1979) was a Norwegian military officer and writer. He was born in Kristiania as a son of customs inspector Eystein Hafslo Qvam (1865–1943) and Ragna Kathrine Erichsen (1872–1951). He was married to Friede Løvenskiold (1902–1948), a daughter of Herman L. Løvenskiold and granddaughter of Herman Løvenskiold, from 1928 to her death. From 1952 he was married to Nanna Burckhardt. He enrolled as a student in 1916, and reached the rank of Premier Lieutenant in 1919 and Captain in 1935. He attended the Norwegian Military College in 1921, and General Staff training in 1932. He served as a chief of staff in the General Staff, and received the Defence Medal 1940–1945 for active service in the Second World War. In 1946 he reached the rank of Colonel, and from 1946 to 1962 he headed the Nord-Trøndelag Infantry Regiment (IR13). The regiment contributed a battalion to the Independent Norwegian Brigade Group in Germany between 1947 and 1952. Qvam was a prolific writer on military and strategic questions. Smaller publications in the 1930s include Sannheten om militærvesenet (1930), Kan vi forsvare oss i en moderne krig (1930) and De store sosiale bevegelser i vår tid (1934, reissued 1935 and 1939). In 1963 he released Randstaten Norge. He also ran the farm Gjævran from 1946 to 1965. The farm was then passed down to his son. He died in April 1979 and was buried in Egge."

  "text" : "Eduardo Bayo is a dynamicist known for his work within robotics engineering, and multibody dynamics while a Full Professor at the Department of Mechanical Engineering at UC Santa Barbara. He is notable in the engineering field for his research contributions to dynamics and the control of flexible robots. His ideas on the non-causal inversion of these non-linear non minimum-phase systems have had a growing influence in robotics and in non-linear control theory. His work began with the application of frequency-domain methods to the inverse dynamics of single-link flexible robots. His approach yielded non-causal exact solutions due to the right-half plane zeros in the hub-torque-to-tip transfer functions. Extending this method to the non-linear multi-flexible-link case was his seminal contribution to robotics. When combined with passive joint control in a collaborative effort with my control group, his inverse dynamics approach led to exponentially-stable tip tracking control for flexible multi-link robots. His paper \"A Finite Element Approach to Control the End-Point Motion of a Single Link Flexible Robot\" was published by the ASME's Journal of Dynamic Systems, Measurement and Control, and won the best paper award for 1993. The influence of Professor Bayo’s inverse dynamics work in flexible robots has grown and continues to be evident in ongoing research at NASA-JPL, and within Medicine, Automation and Robotics to name just a few. Eduardo Bayo was born in Madrid, Spain and received his degree in Civil Engineering from the Universidad Politécnica de Madrid in 1977, his Masters in Engineering Sciences and PhD in Civil Engineering from the University of California at Berkeley in 1983. He is currently teaching about steel structures at the University of Navarra and leading a research team in Spain."

The attack caused $15,000 in damage and the pair were sentenced to 30 days' imprisonment. The \"peace camp\", which consisted initially of four people, a tent, table, tarpaulin and mock missile, had originally been intended to only remain on Parliament Hill for three days; but ultimately remained for more than two years.

After the seminary closed, he helped build the still standing Ka'ahumanu Church in Wailuku and operated a small sugarcane plantation that eventually became part of the Wailulu Sugar Company. Bailey's early works were sketches and drawings which were engraved by students the Lahainaluna Seminary between 1833 and 1843. He began painting about 1865, at the age of 51, without any formal instruction. Bailey’s best known paintings are landscapes depicting the natural beauty of central Maui, The Bailey House Museum (Wailuku, Hawaii) and the Lyman House Memorial Museum (Hilo, Hawaii) are among the public collections holding works by Edward Bailey."

  "text" : "Edward Leeds (died 1590), was an English clergyman. Leeds, the second son of William Leeds, by Elizabeth Vinall, was born in Benenden, Kent. He was educated at Cambridge, graduated B.A. 1542-3, proceeded M.A. 1545, and in 1569 was created LL.D. The date of his first degree sufficiently disproves the statement that he was a monk of Ely. On 20 June 1548 Bishop Goodrich collated him to the rectory of Little Gransden in Cambridgeshire, and in the same year he became prebendary of Ely. In 1550 he was commissary and vicar-general to the bishop, and was engaged in destroying altars and other things deemed superstitious in the diocese. In 1551 he was made rector of Newton, Ely, and served the chapelry of St Mary-by-the-Sea; and on 12 February 1551-2 he obtained the rectory of Elm in the Isle of Ely-cum-Emneth, Norfolk. He was also chancellor to Bishop Goodrich. In 1553 he resigned Little Gransden and Newton. When Bishop Goodrich died in 1554 Leeds was one of his executors. Probably he lost his prebend during Mary's reign. On 28 February 1558-9 he was appointed to the eighth stall in Ely Cathedral. About the same time he was requested by William Cecil to join with Pory  and Matthew Parker in settling a dispute between the president and fellows of Queens' College, Cambridge. In 1559 he was one of Parker's chaplains, and at Parker's appointment to the archbishopric his name was appended to an opinion by certain civilians, added to what was known as the supplentes clause of the letters patent, affirming the validity of the confirmation and consecration. At various times he visited the dioceses of Canterbury, Rochester, Peterborough, and Ely. In 1560 he became an advocate of Doctors' Commons, and afterwards was made a master in chancery. In 1560 also he became precentor of Canterbury and master of Clare Hall, Cambridge. On 20 June 1560 he was made precentor of Lichfield, but he resigned this appointment before 16 May in the following year. He also appears to have been rector of Cottenham, Snailwell, and Littleport in Cambridgeshire, and master of St John's Hospital, Ely. Parker employed him with Dr Perne in 1568 to compose the differences which had arisen in Corpus Christi College. In 1570, Leeds, who had probably acquired a fortune by his practice in Doctors' Commons, purchased from Sir Richard Sackville the manor of Croxton in Cumberland. He rebuilt the manor-house, and in 1571 ceased to be master of Clare. On 14 July 1573 he became rector of Croxton. In 1580 he resigned his prebend at Ely. He died 17 February 1589-90, and was buried at Croxton, where a little figure of him in brass was placed in the church with an epitaph. He founded ten scholarships at Clare, and gave one thousand marks towards the building of Emmanuel College."

Engelbert was the second son of Count Engelbert II of the Mark. Through the influence of his uncle Adolph II of the Marck, Bishop of Liège, he became the Provost of Liège in 1332. Later he was also mentioned as being a Provost in Cologne. After the death of his uncle, he was appointed Prince-Bishop of Liège by Pope Clement VI. In 1362 he applied to become the Archbishop-Elector of Cologne, but his nephew Adolph III gained it in 1363. Nevertheless, after Adolph abdicated in the following year he was appointed Archbishop-Elector in 1364 by Pope Urban V and resigned the Prince-Bishopric of Liège. Engelbert was beset by health problems soon after taking office. In 1366 he accepted coadjutors to assist in the running of the archdiocese, and the Archbishop-Elector of Trier Kuno II of Falkenstein was selected.

  "text" : "Edward, Duke of Guelders (12 March 1336 – 24 August 1371), Duke of Guelders and Count of Zutphen (1361–1371) was the youngest son of Rainald II of Guelders and his second wife, Eleanor of Woodstock, daughter of Edward II of England. In 1350, with encouragement from his mother, Edward began a devastating civil war against his brother Rainald III for control of the Duchy of Guelders. Edward led the Bronkhorster (civil) faction which in 1361 in a battle at Tiel defeated the Heekeren (aristocratic) faction, led by Edward's incapable brother who was captured and imprisoned. Edward governed well and powerfully, despite the conditions against him. He allied himself with the Bishops of Lüttich and with Jülich and Kleve. In 1371, his brother-in-law and supporter, William II, Duke of Jülich, got into a dispute with Wenceslaus I, Duke of Luxembourg. The dispute culminated in the Battle of Baesweiler in which William defeated Wenceslaus, but Edward was mortally wounded in the battle and died on 24 August 1371. He is buried in the Kloster Graefenthal. Upon Edward's death, his brother Rainald regained the Duchy of Guelders but Rainald died shortly afterwards, on 4 December 1371. As neither Edward nor Rainald had children, another war of succession for Guelders began, with the Bronkhorster faction supporting Edward and Rainald's half-sister Maria, wife of William II of Jülich and the Heerkeren faction supporting their half-sister Mathilde, wife of John II, Count of Blois. In 1377, Emperor Charles IV awarded the Duchy of Guelders and the County of Zutphen to Maria's son William of Jülich. After her total defeat in the Battle of Hönnepel on 24 March 1379, Mathilde renounced her claim to Guelders and Zutphen. Edward was betrothed in 1368 to Katherine of Bavaria (30 May 1361 – 10 November 1400, buried Kloster Monkhuizen), daughter of Albert I, Duke of Bavaria and Margaret of Brieg. Edward died when she was only 10 years old and Katherine subsequently married in 1379 to Edward's nephew, William of Jülich."

She was born Ella Sophia Bulley in Liverpool, the second daughter of Samuel Marshall Bulley, a cotton merchant, and Mary Rachel Raffles. In October 1871 she was one of the first students to enter Newnham College, Cambridge, and in 1874 she became the college's first research student. In the same year she married the Reverend Elkanah Armitage, with whom she would have two children. From 1877 to 1879 she taught history at Owens College, Manchester, and developed her interest in mediaeval earthworks and castles. In 1887 she became the first woman on the school board at Rotherham, and in 1894 she was appointed assistant commissioner to James Bryce on the Royal Commission on Secondary Education to investigate girls' education in Devon. Armitage—along with John Horace Round, George Neilson, and Goddard Henry Orpen—proved in a string of publications that British motte-and-bailey castles, which had previously been assumed to be of Anglo-Saxon origin, were not constructed until after the 1066 Norman conquest of England; her book The Early Norman Castles of the British Isles is considered a seminal work on the subject."

  "text" : "Emil Starkenstein (December 18, 1884—November 6, 1942) was a Czech-Jewish pharmacologist and one of the founders of clinical pharmacology. He was killed in the Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp along with a few hundred refugees from Amsterdam after an incident in which a Dutch Jew resisted a Nazi patrol. Emil Starkenstein was born in the Bohemian (now Czech) town of Poběžovice, (Ronsperg) to Jewish German parents. The family had many members who became local physician. Prof. Starkenstein researched and published a family tree  in 1927 which traced his family roots as far back as 1350 and included such figures as R. Benjamin Wolf (1777-1851), R.Eleasar Löw, R. Moses Isserles (1520–72), and several in the Katzenelbogen line, including R.Saul Wahl Katzenelbogen who, according to the glossary of the family tree, 'became king of Poland for one night after the death of Stephen Bathory. He was a professor at Charles University in Prague until the 1938 German occupation of Czechoslovakia. He continued his work as a refugee in the Netherlands. After the German invasion of the Netherlands in 1939, Starkenstein was confined to an area in Amsterdam with other Jews, where they were forced to wear yellow badges and banned from civil service employment. He was arrested and deported in 1941, via Prague and Terezin, to Mauthausen concentration camp. His wife and daughter survived in hiding in The Netherlands, and after the war his wife Marie (née Weil) donated his extensive collection of papers (more than 20,000 items) to the Czechoslovak state. In 2002, these papers were finally deposited in the archives of Charles University in Prague. In addition to the scientific papers, Starkenstein had one of the most impressive pharmacological libraries ever assembled. Before he was killed in the Nazi concentration camps, his family agreed to sell the collection to rare book dealer Ludwig Gottschalk, but when Gottschalk faced deportation to the camps himself, he secreted the library in several locations in the Black Forest and went into hiding. After the war, he reassembled the Starkenstein books and for nearly half a century sold items from the collection under the name Biblion, Inc., in Forest Hills, New York. A portion of the library was purchased by the LuEsther T. Mertz Library of the New York Botanical Garden. These 147 volumes, dealing primarily with the medicinal uses of plants, are identified by Starkenstein's bookplate."

Gibb acquired a knowledge of Arabic and Persian languages, and became especially interested in Turkish language and literature. Gibb married and moved to London in 1899. He made a few visits to Europe, but never visited the regions that he studied. He did, however, come to be viewed as a sympathetic and talented orientalist, with an excellent library, and was acquainted with Muslim poets and scholars. His series of volumes on Ottoman poetry is especially noteworthy. He died 5 December 1901 at his residence in London from scarlet fever, and was buried at Kensal Green Cemetery. His library was acquired by Cambridge University, the British Museum, and the British embassy at Constantinople. His name is commemorated in the long running \"Gibb Memorial Series\" of publications, primarily devoted to the translation of Turkish, Persian and Arabic texts, funded by the trust established by Jane Gibb (d. 1904), the authors mother."

  "text" : "Ermine Cowles Case (1871–1953), invariably known as E.C. Case, was a prominent American paleontologist in the second generation that succeeded Othniel Charles Marsh and Edward Drinker Cope. A graduate of the University of Kansas, with a PhD from the University of Chicago (1896), Case became a paleontologist of international stature while working at the University of Michigan. Case began by sorting out some of the taxonomic synonymies and other puzzles created by the \"Bone Wars\" of the two giants of the heroic age of dinosaur-hunting in the American West, in a series of three monographs dealing with the vertebrates of the Permian or Permo-Carboniferous of North America. Case then turned to his lifelong interest in filling in the fossil record of Permian and Carboniferous vertebrates from the 'red beds' of Texas, New Mexico, and Oklahoma. He also made extensive Jurassic collections at Como Bluff, Wyoming, in the Cretaceous deposits in Kansas, and Cenozoic formations of the Green River Basin and the Badlands of South Dakota. Among Case's prolific output several great monographs about Permo-Carboniferous vertebrates stand out: Revision of the Amphibia and Pisces of the Permian of North America (1911)), The Permo-Carboniferous Red Reds of North America and their Vertebrate Fauna (1915), The Environment of Vertebrate Life in the Late Paleozoic in North America, a paleographic study (1919) and Environment of Tetrapod Life in the Late Paleozoic of Regions Other than North America (1926). All were published by the Carnegie Institution, Washington DC. Case was a gifted teacher. The Ermine Cowles Case Collegiate Professor of Paleontology is an endowed chair at the University of Michigan, which conserves Case's extensive collections. The Ermine Cowles Case Memorial Lecture is given there annually."

She became the head of the entomology department in 1904, despite misgivings from several male colleagues about having a female department head, and she remained in this post until her 1937 retirement. Patch subsequently earned her master's degree from the university in 1910 and later received a Ph.D. degree from Cornell University in Ithaca, New York in 1911. During her career, she was recognized as an expert in the study of aphids and published Food Plant Catalogue of the Aphids in 1938. She was elected president of the American Nature Study Society and in 1930 became the first female president of the Entomological Society of America. Patch's residence in Old Town, Maine, was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2001."

She is best remembered today for creating roles in at least four operas by George Frideric Handel, possibly five. Three of the roles that Handel wrote specifically for her were sorceresses, and the demands of those roles indicate that she possessed an exceptional voice capable of both dramatic power and technical agility. She is said to have had a bitter rivalry with the Queen's other leading soprano, Isabella Girardeau."

Several works are listed in the name of Turges in the Eton Choirbook, which survived Henry VIII's Dissolution of the Monasteries between 1536 and 1541. Turges also has a Magnificat extant in the Caius Choirbook, and compositions in the Fayrfax Boke. A Kyrie and Gloria are ascribed to Sturges in the Ritson Manuscript. At least two masses and three Magnificat settings have been lost, as well as eight six-part pieces listed in the 1529 King's College Inventory."

  "text" : "Emilios Riadis (original name Khu; Greek: Αιμίλιος Χου or Ριάδης; 13 May 1885 – 17 July 1935) was a Greek composer. He was born in Thessaloniki, Greece. He had his first music lesson in harmony and piano with a friend of Wagner’s, Dimitrios Lalas. He also studied at the Munich Music Academy from 1908–1910. He studied form, instrumental and fugue with Walburnn, piano with Mayer-Schrey and choral singing with Becht and Stitch. After finishing at the academy he moved to Paris and studied under Charpentier and Ravel (1910–1915). This was when he started appearing as the composer Riadis because he took the ending of his mother’s maiden name, which was Elefteriadis. He was temporarily arrested at the beginning of World War I and resulted to his permanent move back to Thessaloniki. In 1915 he became a professor at the State Conservatory of Salonica. It is rumored that he was the sub-director, however there are no records indicating this. Most of his works were for the stage, orchestra and chamber, but Riadis was famous for his songs. His songs were “distinguished by an expressive melodic line, somewhat oriental in its intervallic pattern; his harmonization’s are in the French manner”. Most of his works, however, remained unfinished. He also gave a few lectures during the 1920s. In 1921/22 he lectured on Chinese music, in 1924 on Mozart and in 1926 on Ancient Egyptian music. Riadis won the National Award for Arts and Letters in 1923. He also made the orchestration of the Hymn of Aris Thessaloniki, of which he was a supporter."

Late in life she recounted how, aged 11, she had sat upon the knee of \"the ugly little admiral\" Nelson, and upon arriving home her mother had washed her hair for \"it had been touched by that adulterer\". Annarella was born 3 April 1788 in Naples, baptised there 3 April 1788, and died on 9 January 1873 in Paddington at age 84 at 25 Inverness Road, Paddington, and is buried at Stone, Buckinghamshire. Annarella had sung before the Court of Naples, but on 7 October 1815 in Messina she married William Henry Smyth. One of their daughters, Henrietta Grace, married the Rev. Prof. Baden Powell (mathematician), and by him had nine children, of whom one was to become the first Lord Baden-Powell. For their other children, see her husband's entry. Annarella was an accomplished artist and painter, though she never exhibited. Some of her illustrations were incorporated into her husband's published books. In 1886, she was described in her husband's obituary as \"a lady of great ability and rare accomplishments, who through all his scientific labours of every description was his devoted companion and assistant.\" see Royal Astronomical Society Journal, February 1886, p 189."

  "text" : "Emelia Jane Gorecka (born 29 January 1994), is a British middle and long-distance runner. She specialises in middle and long-distance running, racing in 1500 metres, 3000 metres, 5000 metres and 10,000 metres, as well as cross country running. Górecka is the current European Junior 3000m champion and was coached by Mick Woods from 2006 up until 2015. She began her athletics career with Dorking and Mole Valley Athletic Club, where even as an 11-year-old she showed much early promise, beating girls several years older than her in local races. In 2006 she moved to her current club, Aldershot, Farnham and District Athletic Club. She lives in Bookham, Surrey. After winning a number of youth titles at the national level, Górecka had her first international success at the 2010 European Cross Country Championships, where she won a bronze medal in the Junior race. She was also the best European Junior at the World Cross Country Championships that year. In the 2011 European Cross Country Championships she won the junior women's race and led Britain to victory in the team event. At the age of 14 she topped the UK rankings chart in the 1500m for the U15 age group, in what was the third fastest ever time for someone her age. By the time she was 16 years old she had won a total of 20 national and seven international races and taken part in three World Championship events. Górecka holds the British record time  for the mile race as an U15 Girl, 4:46.87, which beat the previous record by four seconds. She also holds the record for 3000m in the U15/U17 age groups. On 8 December 2013, Górecka came 1st at the European Cross Country Championships in Belgrade, Serbia with a comfortable win over Polish athlete, Sofia Ennaoui with a time of 13:06. The race was on BBC 2 and was televised in 11 other countries. Emelia Górecka came a close 3rd in her senior debut at the Great Edinburgh Cross Country on 11 January 2014, helping team GB & NI win the International team challenge. The three-time European junior cross-country champion followed Great Britain women’s captain Gemma Steel for much of the race, before slipping to third place on the final lap. In her interview, Emelia said \"There was definitely no fear... I didn’t really know what to expect; I knew I was in good shape but I just wanted to be taken around [the course] by the girls. I didn’t expect to get in the front but I felt good... the last lap was a bit of a struggle but my strength will hopefully come on in the next couple of years. It’s good platform to build on, coming third, so I’m really happy.\" And Górecka also said she wants one last victory as a junior before concentrating on moving up to the adult ranks: “I’m still a junior for the national cross-country, so I’d love to go there to get my eighth consecutive win... then I will go on to do some senior races, maybe some indoors, and then onto the track, but hopefully I will keep going quicker.”"

  "text" : "Ernest Montaut (1879–1909) was a French poster artist who died at an early age. He is credited with the invention of various artistic techniques, such as speed lines and distorting perspective by foreshortening to create the impression of speed. These techniques are still in use. Montaut's printmaking career started in the late 19th century. He used a lithographic stone to produce an outline of the image, the Pochoir process, often including the year of publication, the artist's name and that of the printer Mabileau et Cie., Paris. Printed on the image was also a descriptive title advertising cars, tires, carburettors etc., and various sponsoring firms. The outlines were then painted by hand using watercolour paints. The process took a few days for each print and was quite labour-intensive. The different artists resulted in noticeable variations in colour. Montaut’s images display action, drama and derring-do - tortuous mountain passes covered at breakneck speed by the newly invented automobile. They document early developments in the history of motorised transport, such as motorboat racing, motorcycle and motor car racing, zeppelins and biplanes. His first motoring prints were created in the mid-1890s, and by 1897, the images had become pictorial records of the many racing events in France. Montaut's work was popular in Paris and was shown in the fashionable outlets on the Rue de l'Opera and Rue de la Paix. Prints continued to be produced after Montaut’s death in 1909 and it is thought that those signed 'Gamy' were created by Montaut's wife, Marguerite - 'Gamy' being an anagram of 'Magy', her nickname. Her works were occasionally signed 'M. Montaut'. Artists known to have collaborated with Montaut include Roowy, Nevil, Campion, Aldelmo, Brie, Dufourt and Jobbe du Val."

Sentenced to penal servitude for life after a three-day trial he was detained in the Welikada Prison and was transferred to the Jaffna Prison. There he died after five months due to lack of medical treatment. Philip Morrell raised the matter of the death of Hewavitarne in the House of Commons.

  "text" : "Edward \"Ned\" Salisbury Field (February 28, 1878 – September 20, 1936) was an American author, playwright, artist, poet, and journalist. He was born in Indianapolis, Indiana to Edward Salisbury and Sarah Mills Hubbard Field. He was the husband of Isobel Osbourne (step-daughter of Robert Louis Stevenson) and step-father of playwright Austin Strong (Isobel's son from a former marriage). Field was an employee and friend of William Randolf Hearst where he made drawings for Hearst newspapers, signing his drawings \"Childe Harold\". As a young news man in his 20s, Field became the secretary, protégé and possibly lover of Fanny Stevenson (who was 38 years older), after the death of her husband Robert Louis Stevenson. After Fanny's death in 1914, Field married her daughter Isobel Osbourne, who was 20 years his senior. Field became a successful Southern California real estate developer. In the 1920s oil was discovered on some of his property which made them wealthy. In 1926 Field purchased Zaca Lake and surrounding land on Figueroa Mountain near Los Olivos, California. His wife Isobel built an artists studio there and the Field home became a popular meeting place for writers and actors. Field's best known works were the film scripts for Wedding Bells (based on his play of the same name) and Twin Beds (based on a novel and subsequent play). The screwball comedy novel Twin Beds (1913) was filmed four times; as Twin Beds in 1920 starring Carter and Flora Parker DeHaven; Twin Beds in 1929 starring Jack Mulhall; as The Life of the Party in 1934; and as Twin Beds in 1942 with George Brent and Joan Bennett. It was also adapted to stage co-written with Margaret Mayo. Field died September 20, 1936, at Zaca Lake. He was 58 years old."

  "text" : "Emmanuel J. Damongo-Dadet (August 18, 1914 – March 14, 1973) was the first Congolese ambassador to the United States and the United Nations. He was born in Brazzaville, at the time Congo was the Middle Congo, a colony that was ruled by France. In his early days, he was taught at Brazzaville and went on to become a teacher and director of École Urbaine at Dolisie. A renowned journalist, poet and novelist in his native country, he wrote Congolila which was published in 1950 and Panorama Congolais in 1962. Emmanuel Damongo-Dadet was also a prefect in the colonial administration during the time Félix Eboué was the governor-general of the French Equatorial Africa (FEA). In 1945, he entered politics joining the Congolese Progressive Party (PPC) that dominated the Congolese politics for years, and was elected councillor-representative in the Middle Congo territorial assembly in 1946. It was also a year later through the territorial assembly that he was elected to become the representative in the French Union assembly. In 1949, he abandoned the PPC long after it became a branch of Félix Houphouët-Boigny's party, the African Democratic Rally (RDA). As a result, he lost both seats in the elections to the Middle-Congo territorial assembly and the French Union assembly in 1952 and 1953. Before re-emerging and forming his short lived political party, the Congolese Democratic Front (FDC) in 1955, Emmanuel Damongo-Dadet embarked on a career in broadcasting occupying the position of Chief of the African broadcasts of the French Equatorial Africa Radio. In the 1956 legislative election, he lost a challenge to the incumbent Jean-Félix Tchicaya for Deputy of the Middle Congo to the French National assembly and was persuaded by Fulbert Youlou to align with his party, the Democratic Union for the Defense of African Interests (UDDIA). He was rewarded the position of Chief Secretary of Ministries of the Budget and Financial Affairs and Minister of Public Works and Transport. Further, he was part of the Congolese delegation to the Secretariat-General of the French Community in Paris in 1960 before Congo gained independence from France with Youlou as the president. Finally, on December 9, 1960, he was appointed to serve as the ambassador of the Republic of Congo to the United States and the United Nations. He died in Pointe Noire at the age of 58."

  "text" : "Edward Randolph (died 1566), was an English soldier. Randolph was probably a brother of Thomas Randolph (1523–1590), was born at Badlesmere in Kent. He made himself sufficiently prominent in Edward VI's time to find it necessary to flee to Paris on the accession of Mary. But, like other rebels, he soon tired of exile, and his known value as a soldier rendered the negotiations for his pardon easy. Wotton wrote to Petre on 17 April 1554, recommending him to mercy; but Mary wrote in May that, though he was forgiven, he must stay and supply information as to the movements of his friends. The formal grant of pardon is dated 9 October 1554. He soon found favour, and on 3 April 1555 Philip wrote to his treasurer, Dominico d'Orbea, ordering a pension of two hundred crowns to be paid to Randolph, who is described as colonel of infantry. Under Elizabeth he was at first employed in Scotland. On 1 April 1560 Grey, writing to Norfolk, alluded to ‘good Mr. Randall's stout and valiant endeavour;’ and Cecil, writing from Edinburgh on 26 June, speaks of his worth. As a reward he was offered the post of marshal of Berwick, but refused it. In 1563 he was made marshal of Havre (then called in England Newhaven), and aided the French Huguenots with two hundred men. In July 1563 he was ill of the plague. Elizabeth, on Randolph's return to England, made him lieutenant-general of ordnance, and colonel of footmen in Ireland. There he soon had plenty of fighting, and was killed in a battle with O'Neil at Knockfergus on 12 November 1566. A poetical epitaph is in Egerton MS. 2642, f. 198."

  "text" : "Emanuel \"Manny\" Fried (March 1, 1913 – February 25, 2011) was a playwright, actor, and union organizer. Born in New York City to a working-class background, Fried married into a prominent upper-class Buffalo, NY family. At the onset of World War II, Fried worked for Curtiss Aeroplane and Motor Company. There, Fried became involved in the company's union, and was fired for subversive activities. From 1944-1946, Fried served in the US Army. After the war, Fried again worked as a labor organizer, and was fired after an FBI investigation into Communist ties. In 1954 Fried was called before the House Un-American Activities Committee to investigate ties to the Communist Party. After invoking the Fifth Amendment and refusing to answer questions, Fried was blacklisted and unable to find work or have his plays produced. He ended up selling life insurance for around 15 years for Canada Life, the only place he could find work, selling mainly to former union members and colleagues. Throughout this period, he was writing plays and performing as an actor on the Buffalo stage. He eventually decided to complete his Bachelor's degree, having only finished one year of college at University of Iowa on a football scholarship as a younger man. He not only completed his B.A., but went on to complete his Ph.D. at Buffalo State College, where he was hired to teach in 1973. He retired from this position in 1983, but continued to teach as an adjunct professor until 2008. Fried also taught for the Cornell University School of Industrial and Labor Relations. Fried's plays included: The Dodo Bird, Brothers for A’ That, Drop Hammer, Elegy for Stanley Gorski, The Second Beginning, Marked for Success, and Boilermakers and Martini’s."

  "text" : "Eivinn Berg (31 July 1931 - 23 September 2013) was a Norwegian diplomat and politician for the Conservative Party. He was born in Sandefjord, and took the siv.øk. degree at the Norwegian School of Economics and Business Administration. He enrolled there in 1953, and was hired in the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs in 1956. From 1963 he served in the Norwegian delegation to GATT and EFTA in Geneva, then as a head of department in the EFTA Secretariat. From 1970 he was an embassy counsellor in Brussels, and negotiated the Norwegian membership in the European Economic Community. However, the membership was stopped in a 1972 referendum in Norway, and Berg left the foreign service. He was the director of the Norwegian Shipowners' Association from 1973 to 1978. He returned to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs as sub-director, and was promoted to deputy under-secretary of state. From 1981 to 1984 he served as a State Secretary in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs as a part of Willoch's First Cabinet. From 1984 to 1988 he was the Norwegian ambassador to NATO, and from 1988 to 1996 he was the Norwegian ambassador to the European Union. His time here was spent in negotiations; first from 1989 to 1993 negotiating the European Economic Area and from 1993 to 1994 negotiating a possible EU membership. This too was botched after a 1994 referendum. He also negotiated the conditions for the Schengen Area. In 1996 Berg left the foreign service for good, and became an adviser for corporations such as Statoil, Norske Skog and Statkraft. He was an adviser ahead of the accession of Slovenia to the European Union. He was decorated with the Belgian Order of the Crown (1974), the Order of Prince Henry (1980, Commander), the Orden del Mérito Civil (1982, Grand Cross), the Order of the Lion of Finland (1983), the Ordre national du Mérite (1984, Officier) and the Order of St. Olav (1987, Commander). His Norwegian residency was at Haslum, later at Ullernåsen. He died in a car accident in Stokke in September 2013."

Forty years following his release, Boyce's prison diaries were published as The Insider: The Belfast Prison Diaries of Eamonn Boyce, 1956–1962 detailing daily life inside the infamous prison during the Border Campaign."

  "text" : "Egeno I of Konradsburg (also Conradsburg) was one of the free knights (Edelfrei) of Konradsburg, in the northeast of the Harz region of Germany, near Ermsleben. In 1070, Egeno I claimed publicly that he knew of a conspiracy by the Saxon counts and the Duke of Bavaria, Otto II of Northeim, against King Henry IV and, as part of this, had even received an order to murder the king. The aim of this ploy was apparently the complete disempowerment of the Duke of Bavaria and expropriation of his estates, giving Henry IV easy access to the Saxon and Thuringian lands. As Otto himself refused the consequent ordeal - a duel with Egeno who was of much lower standing in the social order and of bad reputation - the imperial ban was imposed on him. Otto took up arms in alliance with Magnus Billung but was defeated in 1071 and was imprisoned for a time. Count Giso II of the House of Giso and Count Adalbert of Schauenburg were named as the instigator and author of the conspiracy. They were supposed to have concocted the plan, probably with the knowledge of Henry IV, drawn up the indictment and publicised it through Egeno, whom they had bribed. Giso and Adalbert were killed in 1073 by Otto's henchmen at the Giso Castle of Hollende. Egeno was blinded in 1073 as a punishment for robbery and then travelled through the land as a beggar."

  "text" : "Egeno II of Konradsburg (also Conradsburg) was a free knight of Konradsburg, in the northeast of the Harz region in Central Germany, near Ermsleben. Egeno II may have been the son or grandson of Egeno I of Konradsburg. Around 1080 (after 1076, before 1083) Egeno II killed Count Adalbert II of Ballenstedt from the House of Ascania at Westdorf near Aschersleben. Adalbert was the advocate of Nienburg and Hagenrode and had been imprisoned from 1075 to 1077. The reasons for the murder are not particularly clear. There may have been political motives or Egeno may have acquired Ascanian estates during Adalbert's time in captivity and the two parties ended up feuding. Egeno was made to give up his family seat of Konradsburg to atone for the murder and the castle was turned into a Benedictine or Augustinian monastery. According to legend, the stone cross of Westdorf recalls the crime. From 1115, the lords of Konradsburg destroyed the Old Falkenstein Castle and built the new Falkenstein Castle, where the Saxon Law or Sachsenspiegel was probably written a hundred years later on behalf of Count Hoyer of Falkenstein. In 1142, the lords of Konradsburg are referred to for the last time as \"von Konradsburg\", thereafter they were \"von Falkenstein\"."

He scored just 18 runs in three innings, with a highest of 11 in the match against Kent in 1908. He played with some success as a middle-order batsman for Buckinghamshire in Minor Counties cricket between 1908 and 1911. It is not known whether he batted right- or left-handed, and he bowled a little for Buckinghamshire, but the bowling style is also unknown. Leat was a second lieutenant in the Dorsetshire Regiment when he was killed in the fighting on the Somme in 1918; he is commemorated at the Pozières memorial. At the time of his death, his widowed mother was living in Ottery St Mary, Devon and he left a wife, Winifred Emily, who lived at an address in Slough, then in Buckinghamshire (now Berkshire)."

He was appointed to the perpetual curacy of Horspath, Oxfordshire, in 1814, and to the perpetual curacy of Sevenhampton, Gloucestershire, in 1825, resigning the latter charge early in 1851. For some time also he acted as curate to Routh, the president of Magdalen, at Theale near Reading, a chapelry attached to the rectory of Tilehurst. Ellerton was the founder of many scholarships and prizes. In 1825 be established an annual prize of twenty guineas, open to all members of the university of Oxford who had passed examination for their first degree, the prize to be given for the best English essay on some theological subject, In the earlier part of Pusey's career Ellerton was his close friend, and, in conjunction with Pusey and his brother Philip, he founded in 1832 the Pusey and Ellerton scholarships, three in number, which are open to all members of the university, and are of the annual value of 30l. each. Magdalen College also, in which Ellerton had for many years been sole tutor, and very frequently bursar, shared in his benefactions. In addition to other gifts, in 1835 he founded an annual exhibition for the best reader of the lessons in the college chapel; in 1849 an annual exhibition for the best scholar among the choristers; and by his will he founded in Magdalen College two annual exhibitions for students in Hebrew, He further established an exhibition for boys educated at Richmond School. Ellerton was a firm supporter of the principles of the Reformation, and in 1845 published a brief polemical treatise on 'The Evils and Dangers of Tractarianism.' He was lecturer in divinity, and senior follow of Magdalen College, and perpetual delegate of privileges in Oxford University. He died at his curacy of Theale, 26 December 1851."

  "text" : "Ernest Angelo, Jr., known as Ernie Angelo (born March 7, 1934), is an American oilman and Republican politician who served from 1972–1980 as mayor of the West Texas city of Midland and was in 1976 the co-manager of the Ronald W. Reagan Texas presidential primary campaign. With a 2–1 margin among voters in the state’s first binding presidential primary, Reagan won all ninety-six delegate spots at stake. Coupled with a victory five weeks earlier in North Carolina, the historic Texas upset revived Reagan’s floundering campaign and set him firmly on the road to contest with President Gerald R. Ford, Jr., the party’s nomination at the convention held in Kansas City, Missouri. Without the Texas triumph, which occurred on May 1, 1976, and follow-up victories on May 4 in Indiana and Georgia, Reagan could have been forced out of contention for the nomination. And without Angelo and his two co-chairmen, Ray Barnhart of Houston, later the director of the Federal Highway Administration, and Barbara Staff of Dallas County, chairman of the Council of Republican Women's Clubs of Dallas County, at the helm that year, Reagan might have become viewed as a non-starter with little credibility four years later—when he went on to win the presidency by a wide margin of electoral votes. From 1976 to 1996, Angelo served as the Republican national committeeman from Texas, a position which made him an automatic member of the Republican National Committee."

In 1937, he married Karin Eldrid Heiberg (1915–92), with whom he had the sons Arvid Heiberg (1937–). and Henning Heiberg (8 September 1940). He started studying in 1929, and graduated in 1934 from the Norwegian Institute of Technology in Trondheim. In 1935, he was employed by the construction company F. Selmer A/S. In the same year, he became assisting engineer in the Norwegian State Railways. From 1937 to 1938, he managed the construction of the Sørland Line, in particular the section from Kristiansand to Moi Station. During the 1940s, he had various positions in the state railways. From 1949 to 1953, he headed the operation department of the state railways. In 1953, he was appointed managing director of Holmenkolbanen, where he remained until 1967. He was also chairman of the Norwegian Polytechnic Society from 1958 to 1959, and chairman of the Institute of Transport Economics between 1963 and 1970. After that, he returned to the Norwegian State Railways, where he was appointed director-general. During his leadership of the company, Heiberg became famous for the phrase \"The railway is being strangled by impotent car users\". Heiberg was the last director-general of the state railways who lived in the large director-general house of the company at Filipstad in Oslo. In 1978, he retired from his position in the state railways. He was the last director-general of the state company who had voluntary resigned from the position.

  "text" : "Edward Robertshaw Hartley (25 May 1855–18 January 1918) was a British socialist politician. Hartley began work in a mill at the age of ten, before becoming a warehouse clerk and then a butcher. He became an active socialist in 1885, in reaction to serious unemployment in his home town of Bradford. He was a founder member of the Bradford Labour Union and the Independent Labour Party (ILP). He stood for the party in Dewsbury at the 1895 general election, taking 10.4% of the vote, but was not elected. However, he did gain election to Bradford City Council that year, representing Manningham, and held his seat for over a decade. At the 1900 general election, he was nominated in Pudsey, but withdrew on the eve of the poll. Hartley was intended as the ILP candidate for the Dewsbury by-election, 1902, with the support of the local trades council and the Labour Representation Committee, but the rival Social Democratic Federation (SDF) nominated Harry Quelch. Initially, neither candidate would withdraw, but the trades council convinced the ILP to drop Hartley's candidacy. Quelch did not gain the support of the local labour movement, nor of the ILP leadership. Angered by what he saw as pandering to the right-wing of the labour movement, Hartley actively supported Quelch's candidacy and joined the SDF. He founded a new SDF branch in Bradford, in 1904, and was elected to the SDF's executive for seven years, using the position to advocate socialist unity. Yet he remained part of the ILP group on Bradford Council, and was re-elected on the ILP ticket in Bradford Moor in 1905. Hartley stood for the SDF in Bradford East at the 1906 general election, where he held joint meetings with Fred Jowett, Labour Party candidate for Bradford West, and he secured the support of the local ILP. He won 22.8% of the vote, but again missed election. He next stood for the party in the Newcastle by-election, 1908, then back in Bradford East in the January 1910 general election. From 1910 until 1912, Hartley was the secretary of The Clarion Van Movement. He then toured Australia and New Zealand for eighteen months. On his return, he stood in the Leicester by-election, 1913. Sitting MP Ramsay Macdonald had persuaded the Labour Party not to stand a candidate, in the hope of a Liberal victory, but this enabled Hartley to attract the support of many ILP members, ultimately taking 11.4% of the vote. On the outbreak of World War I, Hartley became strongly pro-war and left the SDF to join the British Workers League, in the process losing most of his political support."

He found work as a teacher, and immediately joined the National Union of Teachers (NUT). He was exempted from military service during World War II due to his asthma. In 1951, he became head of Warlingham School in Surrey, then in 1956 became national president of the NUT. In 1960 Britton was recruited as General Secretary of the Association of Teachers in Technical Institutes, during which time he worked with Reg Prentice to challenge the outcome of the Robbins Committee, and successfully lobbied for the opening of polytechnics. He resigned his post in 1969, in order to become General Secretary of the NUT, which he immediately convinced to affiliate to the Trades Union Congress. In 1974, he won a 30% pay increase for teachers. He retired in 1975, becoming a lecturer at the University of Sheffield, and also worked at Canterbury Christ Church College and served on Acas' central committee."

  "text" : "Eugen D. Relgis (backward reading of Eisig D. Sigler; first name also Eugenio, Eugène or Eugene, last name also Siegler or Siegler Watchel; (22 March 1895 – 24 May 1987) was a Romanian writer, pacifist philosopher and anarchist militant, known as a theorist of humanitarianism. His internationalist dogma, with distinct echoes from Judaism and Jewish ethics, was first shaped during World War I, when Relgis was a conscientious objector. Infused with anarcho-pacifism and socialism, it provided Relgis with an international profile, and earned him the support of pacifists such as Romain Rolland, Stefan Zweig and Albert Einstein. Another, more controversial, aspect of Relgis' philosophy was his support for eugenics, which centered on the compulsory sterilization of \"degenerates\". The latter proposal was voiced by several of Relgis' essays and sociological tracts. After an early debut with Romania's Symbolist movement, Relgis promoted modernist literature and the poetry of Tudor Arghezi, signing his name to a succession of literary and political magazines. His work in fiction and poetry alternates the extremes of Expressionism and didactic art, giving artistic representation to his activism, his pacifist vision, or his struggle with a hearing impairment. He was a member of several modernist circles, formed around Romanian magazines such as Sburătorul, Contimporanul or Șantier, but also close to the more mainstream journal Viața Românească. His political and literary choices made Relgis an enemy of both fascism and communism: persecuted during World War II, he eventually took refuge in Uruguay. From 1947 to the moment of his death, Relgis earned the respect of South American circles as an anarchist commentator and proponent of solutions to world peace, as well as a promoter of Latin American culture."

Johnson wasn't selected in Norwood's 1925 premiership team, during his first league season, but was a member of their premiership side in 1929. He captained Norwood to a grand final in 1933, from fourth in the ladder, but they lost to West Torrens. A rover, he represented the South Australian interstate team on one occasion. As a right handed batsman, Johnson played in six first-class cricket matches for South Australia. He had a modest record, only scoring 141 runs in ten completed innings, with a highest score of just 28. He took part in South Australia's 1927/28 and 1928/29 Sheffield Shield campaigns. Soon after his football playing career ended, Johnson was appointed Norwood's treasurer, a role he would hold for almost 40 years."

  "text" : "Edward Wasilewski (1923 – 22 August 1968), pseudonym Wichura (Strong gale), was one of the best known anti-communist fighters in the Polish resistance during the Soviet takeover of Poland. Under his command, 44 underground soldiers successfully attacked the NKVD camp in Rembertów on the night of 20–21 May 1945, and liberated 700–1000 NKWD prisoners. Wasilewski was arrested on 26 March 1946 and, after a year spent in prison, was broken by agents of the Ministry of Public Security. He worked as an informant until 1960, denouncing many of his former colleagues. He committed suicide by jumping out of a window in 1968, on the day of the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia. Wasilewski grew up in Stanisławów near Mińsk Mazowiecki. He got engaged in anti-Nazi resistance as early as December 1939 – being merely 16 years old. In the summer of 1940 he joined the underground scouting group Szare Szeregi, and became one of its organizers. He entered the Home Army (Armia Krajowa) with his scouting platoon. Simultaneously, Wasilewski continued his education in a clandestine secondary – which allowed him to pass the Polish high school exam. In the Home Army, he was assigned to combat division, where he served until the end of the German occupation. In 1943 he completed a clandestine course at a cadet school and received the rank of a platoon officer. In 1944 he was promoted to the rank of the Second Lieutenant and joined the forest battalion. He ended his fight against Germany with the participation in action \"Burza\" (Storm)."

  "text" : "Emma Sandys (born Mary Ann Emma Sands) (Norwich 1843 – November 1877 Norwich) was a 19th-century English painter. Emma Sandys was born in Norwich where her father, Anthony Sands (1806–1883), gave her some early lessons. In 1853 the family added a ‘y’ to their surname. She was influenced by her brother Frederick Sandys (1829–1904), one of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, and his friend Dante Gabriel Rossetti. Her earliest dated painting is marked 1863 and she exhibited her works in both London and Norwich between 1867 and 1874. Her works were mainly portraits in both oil and chalk of children and of young women, often in period or medieval clothing, against backgrounds of brightly coloured flowers. Emma Sandys did most of her work around Norwich but may have spent time in the studio of her brother, Frederick Sandys, in London. She died in Norwich in November 1877. Her works include: \n* Elaine (National Trust Collection, Lanhydrock, Cornwall.) \n* Fiammetta \n* Lady in Yellow Dress (Norwich Castle Museum.) \n* Viola (Walker Art Gallery, Liverpool.)"

Brandon had already been married twice before, in scandalous circumstances, and would marry twice more, also in scandalous circumstances, but at this point was a widower. In 1513, Elizabeth and Brandon were betrothed, and he was made Viscount Lisle in anticipation of their marriage - she was then only eight years old. In 1515, he married Mary Tudor, the widowed Queen consort of France and Henry VIII's younger sister (without having obtained the consent of the King). Having married he was obliged to surrender the title and Elizabeth's wardship. This was passed on to Katherine Plantagenet, Countess of Devon, who married Elizabeth to her son, Henry Courtenay, a cousin of the King and grandson of Edward IV of England. Elizabeth died before the marriage could be consummated."

  "text" : "Ernesta Drinker Ballard (1920 – August 11, 2005) was an American horticulturalist and feminist. Among the founders of the National Organization for Women, the National Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League, and Women's Way, Ballard was the executive director of the Pennsylvania Horticultural Society from 1963 to 1981, credited by The New York Times with bringing its annual Philadelphia Flower Show to \"international prominence.\" Women's Way annually awards the Ernesta Drinker Ballard Book Prize to a recently published female author who has helped make headway in the dialogue about women’s rights through her work. The 2012 winner was Rebecca Traister for her book Big Girls Don’t Cry. Ernesta had dedicated her life to her family which included her four children and her husband who earned a comfortable living. Even though, Ernesta felt like she was living the American dream, she was lacking accomplishments in her professional career. This was something that was important to her and she wanted to do something for herself to feel accomplished in her professional career. At an early age, Ernesta’s father instilled in her that the only meaningful role women can have is to be a wife and a mother. Ernesta’s father would pay little to no attention to her and would only spend time with his sons. Ernesta’s father was a well-known lawyer. Ernesta expressed her desire of becoming a lawyer and encountered no support from her father since she was only expected to get married and become a wife. Her father would constantly send hidden messages that women were only supposed to be nice and enchanting and that men’s capabilities were higher than women’s. Unconsciously, these hidden messages stayed with Ernesta for 30 years. Surprisingly later in life, Ernesta’s mother became a feminist and she was ashamed of her mother’s new beliefs. Ernesta’s mother had never expressed to Ernesta that she was valuable as a woman and therefore, it was hard for her to understand feminism from her mother. Ernesta’s husband supported and believed in her abilities as a professional. However, Ernesta would unintentionally sabotage herself due to the way she was taught to think about women since a young age. Ernesta later decided to seek professional help from a psychiatrist who helped her process the reasons why she thought the way she did about herself and her capabilities as a woman. At this point, Ernesta had a breakthrough moment which led her to becoming a feminist and later an activist. Ernesta Drinker Ballard later obtained her associates degree in science which helped her feel professionally accomplished. Her determination and passion for her job earned her the position of the organizer executive at the Pennsylvania Horticultural society which is historically dominated by men. Ernesta had a difficult time earning the respect of her male colleagues and experienced a lot of hostility from them because they had a hard time accepting the worth of women in the workplace. Ultimately, Ernesta felt that the best legacy she could leave was to empower her own daughters to help to empower other women."

  "text" : "Baron Frederick Joseph Eugene de Kleist (January 18, 1853 – 1911), was a pioneering German organ builder, who in founding the North Tonawanda Barrel Organ Factory, started the American style of Band organs. Eugene de Kleist was born in Duesseldorf on January 18, 1853, the son of Baron Ewald and his Belgium-born wife Charlotte de Kleisi (née Heyden). At the end of his formal schooling, he joined the Prussian Army, and fought in the Franco-Prussian War. After the end of hostilities, he trained as a barrel organ builder with the French company Limonaire Frères, in the Black Forest town of Waldkirch. In 1880, De Kleist moved to London, England, where he started his own organ building business. Almost from the start of its foundation, De Kleist built contacts in the United States, and commuted regularly across the Atlantic Ocean. After the United States Government announced the impossition of import tariffs from 1893 on new organs, he was pursued by Allan Herschell, to persuade him to set up in business in the United States, and hence supply the various fairground ride manufacturers with locally made European quality barrel organs. In 1892 De Kleist liquidated his London business and moved to the then unincorporated village of North Tonawanda, New York, backed by Allan Herschell and hence close to his Herschell Armitage Company factory. The location had developed a reputation as an excellent site for those reliant on the lumber trade, and easy access to all of North America via its excellent transport links. De Kleist established the North Tonawanda Barrel Organ Factory, and began producing organs suitable for a variety of fairground rides. As parts were not subject to the import tariffs, many of his early organs were built from parts imported from the French and German factories of his old employer, Limonaire Frères. As production grew, De Kleist approached other musical instrument manufacturers to create new instruments under their brands. One of these companies was the Wurlitzer company of Cincinnati, Ohio. Wurlitzer said no to buying any of De Kleist's existing barrel-organ based products, but said that they would buy a coin-operated piano. As development of the Wurlitzer Tonophone progressed, in 1897 the business name was changed to the DeKleist Musical Instrument Manufacturing Company, after De Kleist agreed to sell the company’s products exclusively to Wurlitzer. The Tonophone brought about a commercial agreement between De Kleist and Wurlitizer, cemented in 1901 after Allan Herschell left the Herschell Armitage Company due to financial complications. This allowed De Kleist to buy Herschell Armitage out, and seek new investment from his association with Wurlitzer. Having been voted in previously as president of the Common Council of North Tonawanda, in November, 1906, he was elected Mayor of the city for a term of two years. Wurlitzer resultantly bought him out of the organ building business in 1908, renaming it the Rudolph Wurlitzer Company of North Tonawanda. After his term as mayor ended, and suffering from ill health, De Kleist retired with his wife Charlotte (née Chelius) to Berlin in 1911, dying in Biarritz, France in 1913 from a heart attack. He left his only son, August, and two daughters, who had chosen to remain in the United States."

He became a presenter for local programming in Kansas City, but his career ended following a conviction for sexual battery in 1987. In 2006, he began posting videos of himself to YouTube, where he achieved widespread popularity. However, probation requirements relating to his 1987 conviction stipulated that he was forbidden to own a computer, and by doing so, he was put on trial in 2010, and sentenced to five years in prison. A campaign was organized by his friends and supporters claiming that his imprisonment was unjust, but he died prior to being released."

  "text" : "Edita Tahiri (born July 29, 1956) is the Minister for Dialogue of the Government of the Republic of Kosovo. Prior to this responsibility she was the Deputy Prime Minister responsible for foreign policy and national security. She also was the Minister of Public Administration. Since 2011, she is the Kosovo’s Chief Negotiator at the Brussels Dialogue with neighboring country Serbia, with facilitation of EU and full support of US. Tahiri is an Albanian leader and one of the main protagonists in the political changes affecting Kosovo and South Eastern Europe, after the end of the Cold War. She was one of the founders and key leaders of the movement for Kosovo’s independence, the Democratic League of Kosovo, in the years 1991-1999. She was the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Republic of Kosovo (1991-2000) and is particularly well known in foreign policy and for her contribution to internationalizing the question of Kosovo and Albanians. She was part of the Kosovo delegation at the Rambouillet Peace Conference (1999) where she contributed to achieving the Rambouillet Agreement, which led to NATO intervention in Kosovo in 1999 and opened up the path to Kosovo’s unilateral independence. She was also a negotiator for peace talks at earlier phases since the London Peace Conference on disintegration of former Yugoslavia in 1992. Tahiri is a Harvard University graduate, and she holds a master's degree in public administration from the John F. Kennedy School for Government in 2002. She also graduated in the Edward S. Mason program for Public Policy and Management, 2002. During her studies at Harvard, John F. Kennedy School Professor Joseph S. Nye was her tutor. For her academic achievements, she was awarded the title “Outstanding student of 2002” by the John Kennedy School of Government Public Service Fellowship and an “Edward S. Mason Appreciation for an Extraordinary Contribution.” She holds a doctoral degree in political sciences from University of Prishtina in cooperation with Johns Hopkins University - SAIS in Washington DC, in 2011. Her thesis “ International Statebuilding and Uncertain Sovereignty” is focused on the case study of Kosovo, under a mentorship of well known American professors I. William Zartman and Alan Kuperman. She was also a Fulbright Scholar in the years, 2006/2007 at the Johns Hopkins University - SAIS University where she did doctoral studies in the Program for Conflict Resolution. Tahiri held senior political and state responsibilities during the hard times of Kosovo’s conflict with Serbian government ia. With her political philosophy of freedom, democracy and self-determination, she was committed to ensuring that genocide would never again occur against her people. As well as being Minister of Foreign Affairs, she also held other positions such as: Member of the Presidency of the Democratic League of Kosovo (LDK) from 1991-1998; Secretary for External Relations in LDK (1991-1998), Member of parliament of the Republic of Kosovo Parliament (1992-1998; 1998-2000; 2001-2004; 2007-2010), Special Emissary for President Rugova, Head of the Commission for Foreign Affairs in the Kosovo Assembly (1998-2000) and many other positions. She was the spiritual leader of the Women’s Forum in LDK and coordinator of Women's Forum from the Presidency of LDK (1991-1998) and also the founder of the Kosovo Center for International Studies (1994). As Foreign Minister of an occupied and unknown country like Kosova, Tahiri managed to make the Kosovo question and the unresolved Albanian question well-known amongst senior world circles and to secure the support of the international community for the right to self-determination and Kosovo’s independence. In meetings with senior officials and statesmen, including the American Secretary of State, Madeleine Albright, NATO Chief, General Wesley Clark, British Prime Minister Tony Blair, German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine and many other international personalities, she was successful in presenting the national cause to world diplomats. Tahiri participated in all phases of negotiations up to NATO intervention in 1999, including the Rambouillet Conference (1999), the London Conference (1992), and pre Rambouillet negotiations 1998, as part of the G15 and G5 negotiation teams.

After the end of the war in Kosovo, she was committed to democratic reforms in her political party (LDK) and in her country Kosovo. After 5 years of her reformist efforts, she left to create a new reformist political party, the Kosovo Democratic Alternative (ADK) in May 2004, together with other like-minded reformists. Tahiri has been the President of the Kosovo Democratic Alternative (ADK) since its founding. Since 2007, ADK became a parliamentary party and is in coalition with the Democratic Party of Kosovo (PDK) and since 2010 is part of the Government.

He inherited the baronetcy of Margam on the death of his brother Henry who died in infancy in around 1640. In 1660, Mansel was elected Member of Parliament for Glamorgan in the Convention Parliament. He was re-elected MP for Glamorgan in 1670 for the Cavalier Parliament and sat until 1679. In 1681 he was re-elected MP for Glamorgan and held the seat until 1689. In 1688 he was appointed High Sheriff of Glamorgan. Mansel was an influential person in South Wales. The Duke of Beaufort, when Lord President of Wales, visited Margam during his \"Progress\" in 1684. Mansel died at the age of 69. Mansel married Martha Carne, daughter of Edward Carne of Ewenny, Glamorgan. His son Thomas succeeded to the baronetcy and was created Baron Mansel. His daughter Martha married Thomas Morgan of Tredegar, which marriage and its after-effects caused the baronet much trouble because Thomas Morgan was reluctant to return from a tour on the continent of Europe. His daughter Elizabeth married Sir Edward Stradling, 5th Baronet."

  "text" : "Edward Abraham Snyder (February 22, 1919 – March 10, 2011) was an American composer and songwriter. Snyder is credited with co-writing the English language lyrics and music for Frank Sinatra's 1966 hit, \"Strangers in the Night\". Snyder was born in New York City on February 22, 1919. He studied piano at the Juilliard School before taking a job as a songwriter at the Brill Building. The music for \"Strangers in the Night\" was originally written by Croatian composer Ivo Robic but when it failed to gain recognition in the song festival for which it had been composed, Robic sold the rights to German bandleader and composer Bert Kaempfert, who used it in the spoof spy film A Man Could Get Killed. Snyder subsequently collaborated with British lyricist Charles Singleton, although Snyder always insisted that he also contributed to the final music form, and the song is now credited to all four. The first vocal version was cut by Jack Jones in April 1966, but the best-known is that recorded by Frank Sinatra three days later. At the session an angry Sinatra turned on guitarist Glen Campbell, who had been brought in at the last moment. Campbell did not know the song and busked his way through the first take while listening to the tune. Sinatra was used to recording in a single take, and when told he would have to sing it again, he glared at Campbell and shouted: \"Is that guy with us or is he sleeping?\". On take two Sinatra himself added the famous \"doo-bie-doo-bie-doo\" improvisation at the end. In the original 1966 recording, this fades prematurely, but in a recently remastered version, it continues for an additional nine seconds. Despite its popularity, Sinatra is known to have detested the song and often expressed his distaste for it when performing it in concert. \"Strangers In The Night\" has been performed an estimate of four million times since Sinatra recorded his version, and won Snyder a Golden Globe for Best Original Song in a Film in 1966. Snyder also composed \"Spanish Eyes\" for Al Martino in 1965, which later became a hit in the United Kingdom in 1973. In 1966 he also wrote a song for Doris Day \"Every Now And Then\" with composer Richard Ahlert, which is on the CD 'Doris Day the 1960s Singles' The Singles Collection: 1959 to 1966. Eddie Snyder died on March 10, 2011 in Lakeland, Florida, at the age of 92. He was survived by his wife, Jessie."

Hayes' legislation, the Massachusetts Clean Water Act, resulted in a State Revolving Fund which allocated $900 million in no-interest loans for planning, design or construction of waste-water projects in 85 Massachusetts communities. Hayes lost re-election in 1990 to Abington lawyer Michael Sullivan. He later became a lobbyist. He is the husband of former Treasurer and Receiver-General of Massachusetts Shannon O'Brien. Hayes' role as a lobbyist for Enron became a campaign issue during his wife's 2002 gubernatorial run. However, as the Boston Globe reported, \"Hayes stopped lobbying for (Enron) nearly two years before accounting fraud surfaced and its stock price plummeted.\" Hayes is a veteran of the United States Navy, and holds a degree from the University of Massachusetts Boston."

  "text" : "Edward Francis Cunningham (c. 1742–1795), sometimes called Kelso or Francesco Calza or Calze, was a Scottish portrait painter. He came from a good Scotch family, and is said to have been born at Kelso about 1742. His father, having been implicated in the attempt of the Pretender in 1745, was obliged to flee from Scotland to the Continent, and took his son with him. Cunningham studied art with much perseverance at Parma, Rome, Venice, and Paris. He is said to have assumed the cognomen of 'Calze' in Italy. Soon after his arrival in Paris, he inherited the family estates, and shortly afterwards a second bequest fell to his share, but being dissipated and extravagant, he speedily ran through all his money, and was then induced to follow the Duchess of Kingston to Russia. On leaving her Grace, he entered the service of the Russian court, and afterwards went to Berlin, where he found full employment as a portrait painter. Unhappily, his improvident habits continued, and he finally moved to London, where he died in great poverty in 1795. As a portrait painter, he achieved a deserved success, and some of his portraits have been engraved. He also painted a few historical subjects."

However, people who attended the exhibition say Elmo Henderson did not defeat Ali, and newspaper reports after the exhibition made no mention of Ali losing. After the match, Henderson became a part of George Foreman's Rumble in the Jungle event in Zaire and won a libel suit against Norman Mailer and Playboy. As of 2003, Henderson was a homeless man in Austin, Texas. Now in 2015, Henderson lives in a care home in Northern California."

Between 1948 and 1951 he worked at Stanford University, and received a Ph.D. from UC Berkeley in 1952. Until 1954, he was a Jewett Fellow and lecturer at Columbia University, and later a professor at the University of Washington. In 1976 Dr. Henley calculated with Lawrence Wilets the effects on parity non-conservation in atomic physics. From 1979 to 1987 he was Dean of the College of Arts and Sciences there and Director of the Institute for Theoretical Nuclear Physics in 1990-1991. He has been Professor Emeritus since 1995. He also teaches Physics at the University of Washington's Transition School and Early Entrance Program. In 2014 at the age of 90 (and much to the disappointment of his students) Dr. Henley retired from this position. Since 1979 he has been a member of the National Academy of Sciences. In 1992 he was president of the American Physical Society, where he chaired the Nuclear Physics section from 1979 to 1980. In 1989 he received the Tom W. Bonner prize in nuclear physics."

  "text" : "Elizabeth G. Ferris (born c. 1950) is a senior fellow in the Foreign Policy Studies Program at the Brookings Institution in Washington, D.C. and serves as the co-director of the Brookings-LSE Project on Internal Displacement. In addition to her positions within the Brookings Institution, Ferris is an adjunct associate professor in Georgetown University’s School of Foreign Service. She is also a commissioner of the Women's Refugee Commission, a distinguished author and a lifelong humanitarian. Ferris’ work encompasses a wide range of issues related to human rights, forced migration, humanitarian action, the role of civil society in protecting displaced populations and the security implications of displacement. In her latest book, The Politics of Protection: The Limits of Humanitarian Action(Brookings, 2011), Ferris examines inconsistent ways in which protection is defined and applied. She argues that the protection paradigms currently in use are inadequate to meet the challenges of the future, such as climate change, protracted displacement, and the changing nature of warfare. The Brookings-LSE Project on Internal Displacement, established in 1994, is co-directed by Dr. Elizabeth Ferris and Dr. Chaloka Beyani, the current UN Special Rapporteur on the Human Rights of Internally Displaced Persons. The goal of the project is to develop global and regional normative standards on internal displacement, to support governments, civil society and international actors in their work with internally displaced persons(IDPs), and to carry out independent research on situations of internal displacement. Prior to joining the Brookings Institution in November 2006, Ferris spent 20 years working in the field of humanitarian assistance. Most recently, she worked in humanitarian response and long-term development for the World Council of Churches in Geneva, Switzerland. Ferris served as the Director of the Church World Service’s Immigration and Refugee Program and the Research Director for the Life & Peace Institute in Uppsala, Sweden. She also served as chair of the International Council of Voluntary Agencies from 2003-2006 and, in that capacity, was an active participant in the Inter-Agency Standing Committee. She has been a professor at several US universities, including Lafayette College, Miami University and Pembroke State University, and served as a Fulbright Professor at the Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México. Ferris has written many articles on humanitarian and human rights issues that have been published in both academic and policy journals. Notable publications for which she has written include Refugee Survey Quarterly, The Washington Post, The Washington Times, the International Review of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, the Middle East Institute’s Viewpoints series, Forced Migration Review and New Routes, Signs: Journal of Women in Culture and Society. She has also written book chapters, reviews and papers for a number of other publications and organizations and has spoken extensively on forced migration and human rights issues for such groups as the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, the World Assembly of the World Alliance of YMCA s and the Senate Judiciary Committee of the US Congress. She received her B.A. in History from Duke University, graduating in 1971 magna cum laude. In 1972, she received her M.A. in Latin American Studies from the University of Florida. In 1976, Ferris received her Ph.D. in Political Science from the University of Florida, specializing in International Relations and Latin American Studies. She is married to Barry Childers, clinical psychologist, and they have two children: Jon Ferris and Sara Ferris-Childers."

  "text" : "Eoin S. Young (9 June 1939, Cave, New Zealand – 5 September 2014, Christchurch New Zealand) was a motoring journalist who wrote an Autocar column for some 30 years starting in 1967. After first working in a bank in Timaru and writing motor sport columns for the Timaru Herald, he moved to the UK in 1961. He initially worked with Denny Hulme for the Formula Junior series in Europe, and then in 1962 he became Bruce McLaren's secretary, ghosting his column for Autosport. In 1964 McLaren founded his own racing organisation, Bruce McLaren Racing Ltd, and appointed Young as director. When McLaren stepped up to Formula 1 in 1966, Young decided to return to journalism full-time. His weekly Formula 1 column with Autocar magazine, ‘From The Grid’, would run for 31 years and be syndicated at its height to seven other magazines worldwide. In 1971 he authored Bruce McLaren's biography, McLaren: The Man and His Racing Team. In 1976 he wrote Against All Odds with James Hunt, the story of the British Formula One driver's only F1 championship, In 2003, he authored Forza Amon!, a biography of Chris Amon, and in 2007 Memories of the Bear, a biography of Denny Hulme. He wrote columns and articles for many publications including Cars for the Connoisseur (UK), Victory Lane (USA), NZ Classic Car (New Zealand), Autosprint (Italy) and Am Klassiek (the Netherlands). He also wrote for the web-based motor sport magazine pitpass.com. He returned to New Zealand and became ill in July 2014; he died on 5 September 2014."

  "text" : "Else Hansen (Cathrine Marie Mahs Hansen), known as Madam Hansen, later ennobled as de Hansen (1720 – 4 September 1784), was the royal Danish mistress of king Frederick V of Denmark. She was his only long term relationship and the only one of his lovers to have been ennobled. Else Hansen was the only lover to have a long term relationship with Frederick V, who usually preferred temporary arrangements with prostitutes. His relationship with Hansen, however, lasted from at least 1746 until 1752. At least her three youngest children were all born at the manor Ulriksholm on Funen, the estate of major Ulrik Frederik von Heinen, who was the brother-in-law of the courtier Adam Gottlob Moltke, and her frequent trips there to give birth when her pregnancies became visible was publicly noted. The children were officially listed as the issue of her claimed non existent spouse, sea captain Frederick Hansen. Hansen was ennobled de Hansen, but the line died with her son. She was the only one of the king's lovers to be ennobled. Neither she nor any one else of the king's lovers, however, ever had any influence over state policy. The relationship with Frederick ended in 1752, after which she was referred to as the widow of sea captain Frederik Hansen, and resided at an estate of Ulrik Frederik von Heinen. After the death of Frederick in 1766, she acquired the estate Klarskov on Funen, where she lived until her death. She sold Klarskov in 1774, but continued to reside there all the same. Her children were not officially recognized, but unofficially they were taken care of by the royal court and the daughters were given a dowry and married to members of the nobility or the highest merchant class: also her grandchildren were given an allowance from the royal house. At Frederiksborgmuseet, there are three paintings of Hansen by Jens Thrane the younger from 1764. Hansen is known by Dorothea Biehl's depiction of the decadent court life of Frederick V."

  "text" : "Edward Randolph (1632 - April 1703) was an English colonial administrator, best known for his role in effecting significant changes in the structure of England's North American colonies in the later years of the 17th century. Called \"evil genius of New England and her angel of death\", his reports to the Lords of Trade (predecessors to the 18th century Board of Trade) convinced King Charles II to revoke the charter of the Massachusetts Bay Colony in 1684, and he was a leading figure in the unpopular Dominion of New England. Randolph served as secretary of the dominion. While in that position, he argued for tighter crown control over proprietary and charter colonies whose administrations lacked such oversight, and he was often given the difficult task of enforcing England's Navigation Acts in whichever colony he was posted to, often against significant local popular and political resistance. His actions were a significant contribution to the development of Great Britain's colonial administrative infrastructure, but he remained unpopular in the dominion. During the 1689 Boston revolt, which deposed Andros and overthrew the dominion, he was jailed. He was born in Kent in 1632, read law at Gray's Inn, and studied at Queen's College, Cambridge, although he apparently did not receive a degree. He died on Virginia's eastern shore in 1703."

She became a prominent philanthropist, fund-raising and setting up homes and schools for the poor. The Smyly Homes and subsequent Smyly Trust are named after her and her family. At the age of 19 she married the Dublin surgeon Josiah Smyly F.R.C.S.I. (1803-1864). Touched by the poverty and destitution in the city she began her charity work. In 1852 she set up her first bible school in Dublin, and by the 1870s had set up a number of schools and residential homes. Mrs Smyly or her daughters sat on the boards of most of these institutions. With the assistance of Rev. Alexander Dallas she set up a school in a loft in Townsend St., and children of this home received schooling and food from his Irish Church Mission. A member of the Church of Ireland, her humanitarian mission was influenced by her religious beliefs. She set up a residential home for boys and one for girls, and then 1859 the Birds Nest in Dun Laoghaire for infants, her homes and organisation known as The Smyly Mission Homes and Ragged Schools of Dublin cared for over 1000 children at this time. Smyly was involved in the Irish Church Missionaries Ragged School in the Coombe opened initially in 1853 in Weaver's Hall, later moved to Newmarket St. it was opened by Rev. Dallas of the ICM. It closed in 1944 and children were moved to the Smyly home in Monkstown. Her homes are believed to have inspired the Dublin-born Dr. Thomas John Barnardo in setting up his homes. In the 1870s, in connection with Annie Macpherson, children were sent to Canada from the Smyly homes in Dublin, similar to arrangements with English and Scottish homes. Mrs Smyly died aged 86 on 16 May 1901, and the running of her homes was turned over to her daughters Annie Dallas Smyly (1855-1933) and her namesake Ellen Smyly (1846-1912). In 1905 her daughters set up a Smyly home called The Coombe Home in Hespeler in Ontario, Canada. In 1917 the Hespeler Home was transferred to the Christian Aid Mission. She is buried in Mount Jerome Cemetery in Dublin. Her third son Sir William Josiah Smyly (1850-1941), followed in her husband's medical career and was master of the Rotunda Hospital in Dublin. Her eldest son, Sir Philip Smyly, similar to his father, was a surgeon."

His 1994 run for re-election to the State House pitted him against Cathy Brown, a Democratic selectman in the neighboring town of Dennis who happened to host an afternoon talk show on the same radio station. Teague left the station in 1995. In 1996 he was a candidate for the United States House of Representatives seat in Massachusetts's 10th congressional district held by the retiring Gerry Studds. He won the Republican nomination, but lost in general election to Bill Delahunt.

Kaaronda is considered a new breed of unionist, that more than compromising workers' interest to be politically complacent with the power structures, maintains an outspoken approach on the many polemic issues that affect the workers. His criticisms include support on a people-oriented Basic Income Grant, skepticism on the precarious short-term labour contracts proposed by the TIPEEG program, demands to held accountable those who were responsible for the N$600 million Government Institutions Pension Fund (GIPF) lost through botched investments in a series of politically connected start-ups, and ultimately to improve the status of the workers rather than decrease them as incentive for foreign investment. Kaaronda was recently fired from NUNW alongside its president Elias Manga, citing “gross non-compliance with regard to his duties and responsibilities”, the “disunity, division and mistrust” on his part. They were replaced by Connie Pandeni and Alfred Angula."

He rented a shop at 4 Rundle Street and started manufacturing account books. In August 1857 the business moved to larger premises at 12 (later renumbered to 14) Rundle Street and a decade later founded a purchasing office in London. He opened a pharmacy at 34 King William Street. He served on the City Council from 1871 to 1874 and from 1876 to 1880, then retired from business, handing it over to his eldest son E.

Trendafilova was appointed to the ICC on March 11, 2006. She served as the presiding judge of Pre-Trial Chamber II. Together with late Judge Hans-Peter Kaul and Cuno Tarfusser, Trendafilova made the landmark decision that saw President Uhuru Kenyatta, his Deputy William Ruto, former Head of Civil Service Francis Muthaura and journalist Joshua Sang committed to trial in January 2012. In February 2015, Trendafilova and Tarfusser dissented with their colleagues of the Pre-Trial Chamber II in their decision to uphold the acquittal of militia leader Mathieu Ngudjolo Chui of commanding fighters who destroyed the village of Bogoro in eastern Congo in 2003, raping and hacking to death some 200 people including children. The original 2012 judgment had been only the second verdict in the court's history and the first time it had cleared a suspect. Both Tarfusser and Trendafilova argued that the appeals chamber should have ordered a retrial because of errors by the trial panel, saying that \"vital evidence was disregarded.\""

His memorial bears his own composition as he did not trust anyone else to write it. And here resteth the Bones of Sir Edwin Rich, Knight, Son of Sir Edwin Rich, who died the 16 Day of November, 1675. Our Lyef is like an Hower Glasse, and our Riches are like Sand in it, which runnes with us but the time of our Continuance here, and then must be turn'd up by an other.

Rich gave £200 for repairing the roads, between Wymondham and Attleborough in Norfolk and the justices of Norfolk, ordered a pillar to be erected by the road side in remembrance of this gift. He also gave £100 for building a bridge, and money to the poor of Thetford. Rich married Jane Suckling, widow of Sir John Suckling and daughter of Reeve but had no children."

  "text" : "Karl Eduard Ortgies (19 February 1829 Bremen – 1916), was a German horticulturist and nurseryman. His father was a noted plant enthusiast and owned an extensive garden, so that Eduard was encouraged to choose the same career and accordingly began as apprentice at the market garden of Herr Böckmann in Hamburg on 1 May 1844. Here he served out 3 years of apprenticeship until December 1847. To round off his education he visited the renowned nurseries of Berlin, Potsdam, Magdeburg, Leipzig, Dresden, Erfurt and Hanover, and on 1 March 1848 started as assistant at Andrew Henderson & Co., Pineapple Place Nursery in London. In May 1849 he joined the staff at Chatsworth House, country seat of the Duke of Devonshire, boasting a famous garden of great splendour, with elaborate water works, a giant fountain, an enormous conservatory and an important collection of orchids and other botanical treasures. William Cavendish, the incumbent Duke, was a passionate gardener and collector who had inherited the title in 1811. The designer of the sumptuous grounds and residence was gardener and architect Joseph Paxton, who entrusted young Eduard with the care of Victoria regia which in 1849 existed in England only as a few seedlings raised by the Royal Botanic Garden at Kew. Three of the seedlings were donated to Chatsworth, Syon House and Regent's Park, and competition was intense for the honour of coaxing from this waterlily the first blossom in Europe. On the evening of 8 November 1849, Ortgies could report to the Duke that the first bud was about to open. The news was wired to Queen Victoria and to the botanists Hooker, John Lindley, George Bentham who were invited to Chatsworth. This illustrious gathering attended the opening of the second bud. File:Eduard Ortgies00.jpg Louis van Houtte, the Ghent horticulturist who established a garden that soon became world famous and who founded the illustrated gardening journal Flore des Serres et des Jardins de l'Europe, was wildly enthusiastic about being the first on the Continent to cultivate Victoria regia. The head of his cultivation section, Benedikt Roezl, later famous as an orchid hunter, had met Ortgies in 1848 in London. Van Houtte urged Roezl to write to Ortgies and beg a seedling of Victoria and, if Paxton would agree, to employ Ortgies as head of the culture of aquatics and orchids. At that time Paxton was inundated with requests, but immediately agreed to the proposal, feeling that Ortgies, as keeper of the Victoria, should be first in line for the new seedlings. On 1 April 1850 Ortgies reported for duty at van Houtte's garden and a conservatory to his design was constructed for the Victoria. On 5 September the first flower opened, amidst a host of Nymphaea species in full bloom. Ortgies crossed Nymphaea dentata with N. rubra to produce the first Nymphaea hybrid ever, illustrated in Flore des serres 8 t. 775, 776 under the name Nymphaea ortgiesiano-rubra. Later he managed to coax the Australian Nymphaea gigantea into flowering and setting seed. In the spring of 1851 Ortgies was transferred to the office and placed in charge of German and English correspondence, and the compiling of catalogues, while carrying on with supervising the aquatic and orchid cultures. During this period Ortgies made business trips to England, Germany, Denmark and other European countries, creating a large circle of acquaintances and friends. In the summer of 1855 he agreed to become Head Gardener of what is now the Old Botanical Garden, Zürich, though he found it very difficult to take his leave of the van Houtte family to whom he had grown close. His predecessor in Zurich had been the energetic Eduard August von Regel, who took up the respected position of director of the Imperial Botanic Garden in St. Petersburg. The Zurich Botanical Garden was poorly subsidised, necessitating the sale of plants and seed in order to cover its running costs. Ortgies was able to raise more than enough money for this purpose, so that the Garden was able to carry out urgently needed renovation of the old conservatories, start the building of new conservatories, improve the water supply, and create an Alpine rock garden. As reward for his efforts, Ortgies received the title of Inspector and a considerable increase in his salary. Ortgies was interested in acquiring new or rare plants, and for this his contacts abroad were ideal. This project caused seemingly endless problems for Ortgies, though it brought financial security to the Garden, an enormous diversity of plants, especially orchids, and a greatly enhanced reputation in and outside Switzerland. Arranged through Ortgies, collections by Roezl streamed onto the Zurich plant market. Roezl managed a huge import nursery, holding auctions in London with business contacts in most European gardens. That Roezl had become affluent was in no small part due to his friend Ortgies. His part in Roezl's success led to his being approached by the collector Gustav Wallis whose contracts with Jean Linden and Veitch Nurseries had been terminated. Ortgies acted as his agent for a few years, but Wallis fell ill and went into a gradual decline up to his 1878 death at the hospital of Guayaquil. Wallis was followed by Lehmann in Colombia and Ricardo Pfau in Costa Rica - both shipped their most interesting plants to the Zurich Botanical Garden. There was also Fuchs in Guatemala, Garnier in Cuba, Gaibrois and Bruchmüller in Colombia, and Besserer in Mexico. After 38 years with the Botanical Garden, Ortgies retired to Kilchberg to be with his family. The standard author abbreviation Ortgies is used to indicate this individual as the author when citing a botanical name."

A recurring feature of Bowen's work, evident even on the early road maps, was his habit of filling every corner and space of the map with jottings and footnotes, both historical and topographical. One of his earliest engraved works Britannia Depicta, published in 1720 contained over two hundred road maps together with a miniature county map of each of the counties of England and Wales. It was an unusual feature of the atlas that the maps were engraved on both sides of each page, and this resulted in a handier sized book. He also issued with John Owen a book of road maps based, as was usual at the time, on Ogilby but again incorporating his own style of historical and heraldic detail. In spite of his royal appointments and apparent prosperity he died in poverty and his son, who carried on the business was no more fortunate and died in a Clerkenwell workhouse in 1790. He published \"A Complete System of Geography, 1744-7; an 'English Atlas, with a new set of maps,' 1745(?); a 'Complete Atlas ... in sixty-eight Maps,' 1752; 'Atlas Minimus; or a new set of Pocket Maps,' 1758; and a series of separate maps of the English counties, of Germany, Asia Minor, and Persia, between 1736 and 1776. Thomas Bowen was his son; Thomas Kitchin and Thomas Jefferys were his apprentices."

  "text" : "Elizabeth Graeme Fergusson (Betsy Graeme; February 3, 1737 – February 23, 1801) was an American poet and writer. Elizabeth, the sixth of nine children born to Dr. Thomas and Ann Diggs Graeme, spent her much of her youth at Graeme Park, the family estate in Horsham, Pennsylvania, located outside of Philadelphia. Ann educated Elizabeth, teaching her to read and write, an advantage that most young girls in colonial America did not receive. Aside from writing poetry, Elizabeth's main literary project was the translation of Telemachus from the original French. When Elizabeth was seventeen, she met, and later began courting, William Franklin, son of Benjamin Franklin. The two were engaged in 1757. William moved to England to study law, and the couple's relationship became strained. A miscommunication had occurred and William believed the engagement had been broken, and he married another woman while in Britain, while Elizabeth thought the two were still engaged. In 1764, Elizabeth traveled to London at the urging of her mother, whose health was failing. While in London, Elizabeth met Laurence Sterne and King George III. While she was in England, she kept a travel journal, which was later circulated and read among her peers in Philadelphia. Upon returning to Graeme Park, Elizabeth learned that her mother had died while she was travelling. Elizabeth thus overtook the role of female head-of-household after her mother's death, hosting \"attic evenings\"—salon gatherings for her elite male and female acquaintances. It was at one of these \"attic evenings\" that Elizabeth met Hugh Henry Fergusson. The two had a quick courtship, became engaged, and married secretly in 1772 and without the approval of her father. One month later, Elizabeth's father died of a stroke, never having learned of his daughter's marriage. As a result, he left the property at Graeme Park in her name, though under colonial law, Elizabeth was a feme covert, meaning that all of her property belonged to her husband when they were married. Henry spent much of the couple's marriage in England and in Philadelphia, working for the British. When the British evacuated the city of Philadelphia in 1778, Henry left for London. He sent a number of letters to Elizabeth pleading for her to join him in England, but she remained in Pennsylvania for the rest of her life. After the war, the Pennsylvania government confiscated Graeme Park, asserting that it was property that belonged to the alleged Loyalist Henry Fergusson. Elizabeth was forced to vacate the property and for two years lived with various acquaintances and family members. After two years of petitioning the government, Elizabeth finally regained the right to her property and moved back to Graeme Park in 1781. In 1791, however, Elizabeth could no longer afford the upkeep of the property and was forced to sell. For the final ten years of her life, Elizabeth lived with friends and wrote voraciously, publishing some of her poetry and participated in the writing of commonplace books with a number of her female acquaintances, such as Hannah Griffitts. She died in 1801 in the home of a friend, very close to Graeme Park. Elizabeth is buried on the south side of the churchyard of Christ Church in Philadelphia."

In August 1933, he was a member of an MCC side that toured the Netherlands and played two two-day matches against \"a Dutch XI\" and the Dutch national side; Holt batted in the middle order in both matches and in the game against the national side he scored 35 in the second innings and was part of a stand that put on 88 after MCC had been forced to follow on, though the match was still lost."

Elle came into the beauty and fashion world during the summer of 2008 and convinced Blair to join her. Their videos of makeup tutorials and clothing hauls quickly garnered a large audience and rose in popularity. As of July 2013, Elle's videos on AllThatGlitters21 have been viewed more than 145 million times, while Blair's channel juicystar07 has received over 240 million views. Both sisters previously posted vlogs under the monikers EllesGlitterGossip and otherjuicystar07, allowing subscribers to keep track of their daily lives outside of the YouTube community. Their respective second YouTube channels move away from purely beauty and fashion-related videos and branch into other topics such as health & fitness, their daily musings, and other random interests. In late 2015, it was announced that Blair and the girls' father, Scott, would be cast in The Amazing Race 28, which will be a special edition with social media personalities but their season came to an end in Leg 7 where they placed 7th."

  "text" : "Eva Rita Katarina Biaudet (born 27 February 1961) is a Finnish politician and Member of Parliament of Finland in the parliamentary group of the Swedish People's Party. She returned to the Finnish Parliament in the parliamentary election of April 2015. Eva Biaudet was Member of Parliament of Finland (1991–2006) and is a former Minister of Social Services (1999–2000 and 2002–2003). After the election of 2003 Biaudet did not want to continue as a cabinet minister. Biaudet was appointed as the Ombudsman for Minorities for a term of five years period starting in 2010. Even though she had no official competence for the position, her references in the election were, according to Ritva Viljanen, Chief of Staff at the Ministry of the Interior, who appointed her, strong enough to validate her appointment, and she was given a special permission. A complaint was made concerning her nomination because she was formally unqualified for the office, as she lacked a university degree. Biaudet had studied law, but never graduated. The complaint did not succeed, as Biaudet was granted a special permission. Her lack of a university degree caused a lot of debate and brought accusations of politics in her appointment. Among others Green League member and a lawyer Husein Muhammed lodged a complaint against her, but none were sustained. Eva Biaudet asked for preliminary investigation concerning the weblog writings of the vicar of the Pohja Evangelical Lutheran Parish Juha Molari. Biaudet suspected Molari of incitement. Eva Biaudet also asked the police to investigate Teuvo Hakkarainen's (The Finns Party) interview with Helsingin Sanomat, suspecting Hakkarainen of incitement against Muslims. The police saw no crime in his comments. 2012 Eva Biaudet was the Swedish People's Party candidate in the Finnish presidential election, finishing 7th with 2.7% of votes in the first round of voting. In June 2011 the U.S. credited Biaudet for her continued work against human trafficking. In 2015 Biaudet was declared unqualified to seek a continuation for her five-year term as the Ombudsman for Minorities due to her lack of a university degree; though an exception was made in her case in 2010, no such exception could be made in 2015, because the formal qualifications of the office had been defined by law after 2010."

  "text" : "Edith Marilyn Fellows (May 20, 1923 – June 26, 2011) was an American actress who became a child star in the 1930s. Best known for playing orphans and street urchins, Fellows was an expressive actress with a good singing voice. She made her screen debut at the age of five in Charley Chase's film short Movie Night (1929). Her first credited role in a feature film was The Rider of Death Valley (1932). By 1935, she had appeared in over twenty films. Her performance opposite Claudette Colbert and Melvyn Douglas in She Married Her Boss (1935) won her a seven-year contract with Columbia Pictures, the first such contract offered to a child. Fellows appeared in a series of leading roles for Columbia, including Tugboat Princess (1936), Little Miss Roughneck (1938), and The Little Adventuress (1938). Her performance as the precocious orphan alongside Bing Crosby in Pennies from Heaven (1936) won her critical acclaim. In 1942, she appeared in two Gene Autry films, Heart of the Rio Grande and Stardust on the Sage, which highlighted her fine singing voice. Her acting career was interrupted in the 1940s by serious personal problems, her own life becoming more Dickensian than the characters she portrayed on screen. In the 1980s, she returned to acting with sporadic roles in television series. Between 1929 and 1995, Fellows appeared in over seventy films and television programs."

He was born and lived in Outram Road, Croydon, later residing in Caterham, and is reported to have worked as a chief cashier at a City bank. Lovett spent his spare time collecting, writing, and lecturing on his special subject, objects collected from residents and seamen in London. He also reports having made collections in Belgium and Holland. His exhibitions in England and Wales were reviewed in the national press, some becoming permanent exhibits, and donated many objects to the Pitt Rivers Museum between 1896 and 1911. During the late 1880s he functioned as President of the Croydon Natural History and Scientific Society. After joining the Folklore Society in 1900, he presented it with talks and published papers in its Journal. Lovett did not venture into theorising on folklore, confining his research to the collection of talismans and other objects with superstititious claims. A major work, Magic in Modern London, was published in 1925. An earlier work, self-published, is \"How to Make A Rock Garden and Grow Alpine Plants\", not dated, but presumably around 1900."

  "text" : "Edward Hicks Hume (1876–1957) was a missionary doctor and educator best known for his work in China for the Yale-in-China Mission and his writings on Chinese medicine. After some twenty years of medical work, which included organizing the Hsiang-Ya Medical College, which still functions in Changsha today, Hume resigned over the issue of turning control over to Chinese during the anti-imperialist campaigns of 1925-1927. He died in Wallingford, Connecticut, February 8, 1957. The Humes had five children: Theodore Carswell (1904-1943); Charlotte Elizabeth Hume Freeman (1906-1994); Margery (1909-1911); Edward Welch (1913-1915); and Kathrina Joy Hume Falk (1917- 1986). Lotta Hume (1876-1976) died on February 17, 1976, inLa Jolla, California. Hume was born in Ahmednagar, India, and educated there by his father, whose father before him had also worked as a teacher and missionary. He received his B.A. from Yale College (1897) and his M.D. from Johns Hopkins Medical School (1901). After marriage to Charlotte (\"Lotta\") Carswell in 1903, the couple returned to India. From 1903-1905 Hume was in Bombay as an Acting Assistant Surgeon in the Commissioned Corps of the United States Public Health Service to monitor the Plague outbreak that had started in 1896. When the newly established Yale-in-China Mission, as it was then called, recruited the couple in 1906, they went to work in Changsha, Hunan. Hume described the allure of China, where there were not the government medical colleges there had been in India, as allowing him to achieve his ambitions in medical training. He represented a new generation of missionaries who thought in different terms from the earlier emphasis on purely evangelical work. \"Get hold of the students, of the educated men -- and China will be won.\" Although he insisted on using only the scientific medicine he had learned at Johns Hopkins, Hume assumed that Chinese would be won to Western ways and Christian religion only if he learned and respected Chinese culture. Hume recruited Chinese medical co-workers, raised funds, negotiated agreements, and laid the groundwork for the Yale-in-China hospital which opened in 1917. He served as senior physician, dean of Hunan Medical College, professor of medicine, and liaison with Chinese medical boards and professional journals. His aim was to develop educational and medical work \"under the strongest Christian influence and under the highest intellectual and scientific standards of teaching and research.\" In 1926, as other foreigners in China condemned the anti-foreign campaigns of the rising Nationalist Party, Hume declared his understanding of their attitudes. \"No one can give effective service to China today, whom the Chinese do not welcome. We are guests here.\" When Yali students took to the streets in violent protest of the May Thirtieth Incident of 1925, however, Hume found it impossible to simultaneously placate them, reassure his Chinese and American colleagues, and satisfy the trustees in New Haven. He came to doubt the worth of the American staff and even of the Yali Bachelors, recent Yale graduates who came to Changsha to teach English. When the Trustees rejected his proposal that the medical school and college be turned over to the Chinese, he offered his resignation. In the years that followed, Hume became director and executive vice-president of the New York Post-Graduate Medical School and Hospital. From 1934 to 1937 he conducted a survey of medical facilities for the Chinese National Health Administration and went on to carry out such a survey in India. Hume also helped to organize the Christian Medical Council for Overseas Work, of which he was secretary from 1938 to 1946. He participated or served as an officer in a number of organizations, such as Yale-in-China (Trustee, 1927-1954, President 1934-1936, and Vice-President, 1955-1957); the Associated Boards for Christian Colleges in China; and the American Council of the Institute of Pacific Relations."

Grant was a tail-end batsman and a slow bowler, though it is not known whether he was right- or left-handed in terms of either batting or bowling. He played first-class matches in each of three seasons from 1899 to 1901, but took only four wickets in all, with a best return of two for 19 against Gloucestershire in 1899. From 1903 to 1912, Grant played Minor Counties cricket regularly for Wiltshire as a lower-order batsman and front-line bowler."

Kazimierowski studied at the Kraków Academy of Fine Arts 1892–1897. He continued his studies in Munich, Paris, Rome. After World War I, he moved from Kraków to Wilno. He taught at the Wilno Teacher Seminary and decorated theaters in Wilno. He painted mostly landscapes and portraits. Kazimierowski's painting of Divine Mercy was first shown to the public in the Easter ceremonies on April 25–28, 1934, and the first Mass with a Divine Mercy image was celebrated by Michael Sopocko at the Gate of Dawn church in Wilno, on April 28, 1935 (the second Sunday of Easter) before the Vatican approved the term Divine Mercy Sunday in 2000. In 1936, Kazimierowski moved to Białystok, where he encouraged tourism. He died in 1939; most of his works were lost in World War II."

In 1827 he visited Germany, and upon returning to England published his first book, A Ramble among the Musicians of Germany (1828; 3d ed. 1838). Impressed with his skills as a writer on music, the owner The Atlas hired him as a music critic where he remained for many years. In 1849 he immigrated to the United States where he spent the last 10 years of his life working as an editor and music critic. He also contributed articles to several music journals during his career, including The Musical Times. His other works include The Life of Mozart (1845), Life of Purcell, for Novello's 'Sacred Music', and Analytical and Thematic Index of Mozart's Piano-works."

  "text" : "Eveline Mabel Richardson Burns (March 16, 1900 – September 2, 1985) was a British-American economist, writer and instructor. Born Eveline Mabel Richardson in London, England, she was the only child of Eveline Maud Falkner and Frederick Haig Richardson. Her mother died following her birth, so her father remarried and had three more children. Eveline attended Seatham Secondary School, then entered the London School of Economics at age 16 and graduated in 1920, earning a B.S. with first class honors. In 1922 she married the economist Arthur Robert Burns and the couple emigrated to the United States. After the award of her Ph.D. in 1926, she gained a Laura Spelman Rockefeller Fellowship. She and her husband traveled the country for two years while writing The Economic World. She became professor of Social Work at Columbia University in 1928. In 1933, during the Great Depression, she returned to England in 1933 to study unemployment programs. In 1934, as a member of President Franklin D. Roosevelt's Committee on Economic Security, she helped design the US Social Security Act of 1935. During the following years she served with the American Association for Social Security, the Social Welfare Committee of the YWCA and the Executive Board of the Women's Club of New York. From 1939–1943 she was head of the economic security and health section of the National Resources Planning Board. In the 1940s, she was the Anna Shaw Lecturer at Bryn Mawr College and a professor at Columbia. From 1953–1954 she was vice-president and president of the American Economic Association. In 1954 she was awarded the Adam Smith Medal for outstanding economic research. The same year she received a Guggenheim Fellowship. Between 1950–1958, she held various posts in the National Conference on Social Welfare. In 1968 she was given the Blanche Ittelson Award. During her career she published multiple works on social welfare. She died at St. Mary's Hospital in Newton, Pennsylvania. Arthur and Eveline did not have any children."

  "text" : "Eliot Cowan is an American-born healer, teacher, author, and founder of the alternative healing technique known as Plant Spirit Medicine. Born in 1946 in the United States, Cowan was raised in Chicago, Winnipeg and San Francisco. He received a degree in Anthropology from Pomona College and pursued post-graduate study in documentary filmmaking at UCLA.In 1970, while living on a farm in Vermont, he became distraught because one of his goats was sick. Unwilling to accept a \"hopeless\" diagnosis from a veterinarian, he began to read about herbalism and treated the goat with a plant. The goat healed, and Cowan's work in Herbalism began. In 1971, he traveled to England to study acupuncture, receiving Licentiate, Bachelor and Master of Acupuncture degrees from J.R. Worsley at the College of Traditional Acupuncture, Leamington Spa, England. After a number of years practicing acupuncture, he came across an article on the Huichol Indians of the Mexican Sierras. The article caused him to travel to Mexico and meet them. A series of dreams, encounters and experiences guided him to apprentice with Don Guadalupe Gonzalez Rios, an eminent Huichol shaman. In the year 2000, Cowan was ritually recognized by Don Guadalupe as a guide to shamanic apprentices in the Huichol tradition. As of 2011, twenty-five of Eliot Cowan's apprentices have gone on to become shamans in the Huichol tradition. In addition to teaching, lecturing, healing and training of shamanic apprentices on the Huichol path, one of Cowan's most significant contributions is his synthesis of shamanism, traditional Chinese Medicine and Herbalism into the healing technique known as Plant Spirit Medicine. Cowan is Founder and Board Chair of the Blue Deer Center in the New York Catskills, and is Elder Emeritus of the Plant Spirit Medicine Seminary. In that capacity he offers healer training courses on Plant Spirit Medicine, healing camps based on traditional Huichol healing, and animal totem courses in the United States and internationally."

  "text" : "Edward Hodson Bayley (1841 – 7 March 1938) was a British businessman and Liberal Party politician. Born in Accrington, Lancashire, he was the second son of the Reverend Dr Johnathon Bayley, a pastor with the Swedenborgian New Church and his wife Lydia née Hodson. Educated in England, France and Germany, he moved to the south east suburbs of London and established E H Bayley & Co., waggon builders, at Newington Causeway. In 1892 he was described as a \"wheelwright and fire escape manufacturer\". He was also the chairman of three other transport-related businesses: the West Metropolitan Tramways Company, the London Improved Cab Company and of the United Horseshoe and Nail Company. He also sat on the London board of the Equitable Life Assurance Society of the United States. His first wife was an American woman, Josephine Simon. After her death in 1881, Bayley founded the New Church Orphanage in her memory. Bayley was active in the Liberal Party, and in 1886 was chosen to contest the Camberwell North constituency, defending the seat of the retiring member of parliament, Richard Strong. He described himself as a \"thorough Home Ruler\" and a supporter of William Gladstone. Bayley had two opponents: John Richards Kelly of the Conservative Party and William Pirie Duff, described as a \"Dissentient Liberal\". Bayley was defeated, with Kelly gaining the seat with a majority of 365 votes. Despite his defeat, Bayley was unanimously readopted as prospective parliamentary candidate by the North Camberwell Liberal and Radical Association in March 1887. The next general election was held in 1892, and he faced a straight fight against the incumbent, Kelly. A major issue in the election was the proposed extension of tramways over Westminster Bridge: Bayley was strongly in favour of bringing the tramlines into south London, but Kelly was opposed. Bayley easily won the seat, with a majority of 845 votes over Kelly. In the following year Bayley was involved in a curious court case, having refused to pay the painter of his official portrait in House of Commons. Bayley claimed that it was a poor likeness, and \"only like him in the tie\", while his wife objected to it as it did not make him look \"intellectual\" enough. The court found against Bayley. In June 1895 the Liberal government led by Lord Rosebery lost a vote of confidence. A general election was duly called, and Bayley defended his seat against a new Conservative candidate, Major Philip Dalbiac. A third candidate, Nelson Palmer, subsequently entered the contest, claiming to be \"independent of party\", but representing the labouring classes. The Conservatives secured a large majority at the election, and Bayley was one of many Liberal MPs to lose their seats. Dalbiac secured a majority of 693 votes over Bayley. Palmer's intervention had no effect, as he received only 32 votes. Bayley continued to hold directorships in various transport businesses, although the United Horseshoe and Nail Company was wound up in 1909. He was chairman of the London Road Car Company and was a director of the Premier Omnibus Company. He died at Peacehaven, Sussex in March 1938 aged 96, and was buried in Highgate Cemetery."

  "text" : "Eleanor Clarke Slagle (October 13, 1870–September 18, 1942) was an American social worker and an early pioneer of occupational therapy. Born in Hobart, New York, she was the only daughter of William John Clark and Emeline (Emmaline) J. (née Davenport) Clark. During her youth she went by the name Ella May Clark. Her father fought as an officer in the American Civil War and may have been left partially disabled by a neck wound. In 1894, she married Robert E. Slagle. There is little record of what follows, up until she began studying at the Chicago School for Civics and Philanthropy in 1911. Thereafter she was employed in state hospitals of Michigan and New York. It was while visiting at the Kankakee State Hospital in Illinois that she became inspired to work in occupational therapy. In 1912, she became director of a department of occupational therapy at the Johns Hopkins Hospital. In 1914 she resigned and returned to Chicago, where she gave lectures at the Chicago School for Civics and Philanthropy. In 1917, she became general superintendent of occupational therapy for all of the Illinois state hospitals. The same year the training school she started was named the Henry B. Favill School of Occupations which continued until 1920. Up until this period, occupational therapy had not been taken seriously as a medical career. Hence, she began working to promote the field of occupational therapy as a professional occupation. During the third annual meeting of the National Society for the Promotion of Occupational Therapy, she was elected president. For many years thereafter she served as secretary-treasurer of the organization. In 1922, she established the headquarters of the American Occupational Therapy Association in New York. For the next twenty years, she served as occupational therapy director at the New York State Department of Mental Hygiene. She died in Philipse Manor, New York and is buried at Locust Hill Cemetery in Hobart, New York. The Eleanor Clarke Slagle Lectureship Award of the American Occupational Therapy Association is named in her honor."

Her family beliefs and way of life were unusual for that time period. They were vegetarians, interested in eastern thought and religious doctrines which included reincarnation, astrology, and occult phenomena. Maccoby spent her childhood in Tacoma, Washington till 1934 until she moved to Portland, Oregon where she attended Reed College for two years. After those first two years she moved to Seattle, Washington and attended Washington University, where she met her husband, Nathan Maccoby. They courted for one year then married in 1938. In 1940, she followed her husband, Nathan Maccoby, to Washington, DC where he had a job at the US Civil Service Commission. They remained in Washington, DC till 1947 until they moved to Michigan. Eleanor and Nathan adopted three children. Their first child, Janice Maccoby, was adopted in 1952. Four years later they adopted their second child, Sarah Maccoby and soon after their third child, Mark Maccoby. Family life was important to Eleanor Maccoby so she worked part-time, postponing publishing anything for five to six years during this time so she could spend more time with her children. In 1958, Eleanor and Nathan were offered jobs at Stanford University. Nathan worked in the Communications Department and Eleanor worked in the Psychology Department teaching child psychology. Maccoby considered herself a feminist and at Stanford University she met Carol Nagy Jacklin, who also was involved in the feminist movement for front issues that were rising due to the Vietnam War. Maccoby and Jacklin started to work on studies involving inequality between men and women. This led to research involving differences and similarities in boys and girls which soon lead into what Maccoby became renowned for. In 1992, Eleanor’s husband, Nathan died of a heart attack at the age of 80. They were married for 54 years and had five grandchildren."

  "text" : "Elisabeth Doreen Svendsen MBE (23 January 1930 – 11 May 2011) was a British animal welfare advocate and former hotelier. Svendsen founded The Donkey Sanctuary, an animal sanctuary headquartered in Sidmouth, England, in 1969 to help abused or homeless donkeys. She also founded a related charity, the Elisabeth Svendsen Trust for Children and Donkeys, located in Ivybridge, during the 1970s. Svendsen was born Elisabeth Doreen Knowles in Yorkshire on 23 January 1930. She spent her early career as a teacher and secretary. She then married Niels Svendson and had four children - Clive, Lise, Sarah and Paul. Together, the couple invented a dryer specifically to dry cloth baby diapers. They sold the rights to their invention to a manufacturer and used their payment to purchase a hotel in Devon in 1966. Elisabeth and Niels later divorced. In 1969, Svendsen, a lifelong donkey enthusiast, bought her first donkey, named Naughty Face. Soon afterwards, Svendsen noticed seven neglected donkeys housed in a small livestock pen in a market in Exeter. She tried unsuccessfully to purchase the donkey in the worst condition of the group. The experience of the neglected donkeys in Exeter led Svendsen to establish The Donkey Sanctuary in 1969. She began taking in elder and disabled donkeys. She became responsible for the care of thirty-eight donkeys by 1973, an expensive undertaking. She was contacted in June 1974 by a lawyer for a late elderly woman named Violet Philpin, who had bequeathed Svendsen 204 donkeys. Svendsen gave up her hotel to work with The Donkey Sanctuary full-time. The Donkey Sanctuary, founded by Svendsen and headquartered in Sidmouth, Devon, has cared for more than 14,500 donkeys as of 2011. The sanctuary, which now has a veterinary hospital and overnight accommodations, employs approximately 500 people worldwide, including sixty in the United Kingdom who investigate reports of abused donkeys. Svendsen expanded the sanctuary to Latin America, Asia and Africa. She founded a donkey hospital with emergency room in Ethiopia, where the lifespan of a donkey is just nine years. Mobile donkey clinics have also been dispatched in Mexico, Kenya and India. Svendsen established a sister charity to the Donkey Sanctuary, called the Elisabeth Svendsen Trust for Children and Donkeys, during the mid-1970s. The trust provides riding therapy between donkeys and children with special needs. During her career, Svendsen authored more than twelve books, including two autobiographies, Down Among the Donkeys in 1981 and For the Love of Donkeys in 1993, as well as a series of children's books. Svendsen became a Member of the Order of the British Empire in 1980. In 2001, the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals awarded her with the Lord Erskine Award. Svendsen retired from full-time work in 2007. In April 2011, Elisabeth Svendsen named an orphaned donkey foal after Prince William in honor of the Prince's upcoming wedding to Catherine Middleton. The foal had arrived at the Donkey Sanctuary on 9 April after its mother was unable to care for him. Svendsen said at the time, \"It's a real honour to have Prince William with us and I can't think of a better name for him, thus to mark the occasion of the royal wedding.\" Elisabeth Svendsen died at her home on 11 May 2011, after suffering a stroke at the age of 81. She was survived by her four children - Clive, Lise, Sarah and Paul; eight grandchildren; and two great-grandchildren. Her son, Paul Svendsen, is the head of The Donkey Sanctuary's European operations."

  "text" : "Edward Martineau Perine (July 31, 1809 – June 5, 1905) was a merchant and planter in Cahaba, Alabama. Born at Southfield, Staten Island, New York, a son of Edward and Addra Guyon Perine, and a descendant of Daniel Perrin, \"the Huguenot\", Perine moved to Cahaba, Alabama, and became a merchant and wealthy plantation owner. He established a store on the west side of Vine Street in downtown Cahaba. He later became a member of the firm of Perine & Hunter. Anna M. Gayle Fry, writing in her book Memories of Old Cahaba, describes E. M. Perine as \"a merchant prince of ante-bellum days, a Northern gentleman of the old school who was universally beloved by all who knew him.\" Perine first married Mary Eliza Snow (1816–1838) of Providence, Rhode Island, on September 13, 1836, in Milledgeville, Georgia. She died at Cahaba, Alabama, from complications of childbirth. The union produced one child, Mary Eliza Perine. Mary Eliza Perine wrote in an autobiography, My father! It is said I am especially fond of gentlemen. Why should I not be? My father was a gentleman; and, judging all men by him (my standard of a true, honorable, noble image of the Almighty's master-piece) how can I keep, if simply out of respect for my father, from loving his sex? My father! That one word contained my child-world. He was to me all—mother, father, sister, brother, and everything except grandmother; for I had a grandmother. . . . Perine's second marriage was to Frances E. Hunter (1825 - ????) of Sparta, Alabama, on August 6, 1846. Their children were Sarah, Addra, Frances, and Anna Perine. In the 1850s, Perine built a palatial, twenty-six-room brick mansion at the foot of Vine Street. On the grounds of the estate were a conservatory, vineries, and an artesian well, with a flow now estimated at 1,250 gallons per minute. At the time it was thought to be the deepest well in the world, at nine hundred feet. It had a stream of water gushing and falling into a large cement basin, from which it was channeled off through the grounds in cement branches to the pastures beyond. Water from this well was also forced through pipes into the mansion, making it the first air conditioned home in Alabama. Perine died June 5, 1905, at Pleasant Hill, Dallas County, Alabama."

  "text" : "Sir Edward Banks (4 January 1770 – 5 July 1835) was an English builder. Born at Hutton Hang near Richmond, North Yorkshire. After spending two years at sea, Banks began as a day labourer in 1789. He worked under the engineer John Rennie the Elder on the Lancaster Canal and Ulverston Canal and rose to the chief control in his partnership Jolliffe & Banks, contractors for public works. Banks and Jolliffe were responsible for building bridges, dockyards, lighthouses and prisons. Among his undertakings were Staines bridge, the naval works at Sheerness dockyard, and the new channels for the rivers Ouse, Nene, and Witham in Norfolk and Lincolnshire. They were the builders of the Waterloo, Southwark, and London bridges. He owed his fortune principally to these contracts, which he took under the superintendence of the Rennies. Edward Banks first married in 1793 to Nancy Franklin with whom he had five sons and three daughters. She died in 1815 and Banks married again in 1821 to Amalia Pytches, William John Joliffe's sister in law. Banks lived in Adelphi Terrace, Westminster. He also owned rural estates centred on Oxney Court, Dover and Sheppey Court, Kent. With William Joliffe, Banks was also an investor in the General Steam Navigation Company in 1824. In June 1822 Banks was knighted for building the Waterloo and Southwark bridges. He died at Tilgate, Sussex, the residence of his daughter, Mrs. Gilbert East Jolliffe, on 5 July 1835. The story that whilst working as a day labourer upon the early 19th century Merstham tram-road, he had been struck with the beauty of the neighbouring small village of Chipstead, choosing to be buried there for that reason in its quiet churchyard, is a myth as suggested by oral tradition; Lewis Topographical Dictionary says he chose it as the Jolliffe family were patrons of that church, in-law relations and his business associates."

  "text" : "Emile Kelman is an American record producer and audio engineer. Emile has been engineering for producer T Bone Burnett for over 8 years. This opportunity has seen Emile work with some of the world's greatest artists such as Willie Nelson, Robert Plant, BB King, John Mellencamp and Alison Krauss. Emile has also worked on film music and score on productions such as Crazy Heart, Walk The Line, and Across The Universe. Working under the tutelage of Burnett has had an obvious impact on Emile's work as he has absorbed his mentor's philosophy on sound while developing his own approach to production. Emile recently produced the record Myth of the Heart for Austin-based artist Sahara Smith, a project shepherded by T Bone Burnett. Sahara’s record features most of the musicians from the Robert Plant and Alison Krauss record Raising Sand, including Jay Bellerose, Marc Ribot, Dennis Crouch and Greg Leisz. Emile's work on Myth Of The Heart reveals both his technical dexterity and his perspective on music making and sound landscapes. The Los Angeles Times said of the recording that Emile \"learned his lessons well studying under T Bone Burnett\" and gave Sahara's songs \"plenty of sonic air in which to breathe\". Emile has also produced several independent records for artists including Bryan Greenberg, with several songs placed on television shows including One Tree Hill, and ABC’s October Road. Emile’s curiosity with sound has led him to write a large volume of instrumentals, with heavy, dark and tough tones; a number of which were placed in the documentary Dirty Hands about Los Angeles artist David Choe. In the winter of 2009, Emile was also Music Supervisor for Tough Trade, a TV pilot executive produced by T Bone Burnett and Lionsgate. Emile was Burnett's “eyes and ears” on the set in Nashville, working with the lead actors, guiding them with vocal and instrument lessons in order to achieve accurate and believable performances for pre-recordings and camera. Kelman is also a classical cellist – a core part of his personality and musical approach. Since the age of 5 he has enjoyed playing with many elite orchestras and chamber music ensembles. He credits most of his advancements in music production to his detailed and soulful experiences in classical music. Currently, he writes string arrangements and plays on records for artists and bands, including a number of the songs he has produced."
