  "text" : "Dom Fernando de Noronha (Burgos, c. 1380 — Ceuta, 2 or 3 June 1445) was a 15th-century Castilian-Portuguese nobleman. He was the 2nd Count of Vila Real, a title which he acquired and shared by his marriage to Brites de Menezes, 2nd Countess of Vila Real and the third Portuguese governor of Ceuta from 1437. Fernando de Noronha united two prominent bastard lines of the crowns of Castile and Portugal. He was the second son from the marriage of Alfonso Enríquez de Castilla, count of Gijón y Noreña (a bastard son of King Henry II of Castile) and Isabel of Portugal, Lady of Viseu (an illegitimate daughter of King Ferdinand I of Portugal). After the death of Alfonso of Gijón y Noreña in 1398, Isabel fled to the court of her uncle, King John I of Portugal. Her children were raised in the Portuguese court, where they were known by their appellation Noronha (Portuguese translation of Noreña). Fernando's elder brother, Pedro de Noronha, would become an Archbishop of Lisbon. On 18 October 1430, Fernando de Noronha married Brites de Menezes, the daughter of the prominent Portuguese nobleman Pedro de Menezes, 1st Count of Vila Real and first Portuguese governor of Ceuta. Brites competed with her half-brother Duarte de Menezes for her father's titles for herself and her consort. Fernando de Noronha secured the office of counciller and chamberlain in the household of the royal prince and heir Infante Edward. By a royal letter issued September 1434 by the now-enthroned King Edward of Portugal, Fernando and Brites succeeded in securing the inheritance of her father's title of Count of Vila Real, leaving Duarte with the old family title of Count of Viana do Alentejo. Despite Duarte's notable military record as his father's lieutenant in Ceuta, Brites managed once again to pip out Duarte and secure the appointment (October 1437) of her husband Fernando de Noronha as the next Portuguese governor of Ceuta, succeeding the late Pedro de Menezes. Fernando de Noronha was appointed to Ceuta only days before a Portuguese expeditionary force, led by Henry the Navigator, was defeated by the army of Marinid Morocco (see Battle of Tangier (1437)). To save his army from destruction, Henry agreed to a treaty, signed on 17 October 1437, by which Portugal committed itself to deliver Ceuta back to the Marinids, in return for which the Portuguese prince Ferdinand the Saint Prince would remain as a hostage in Moroccan captivity until its fulfillment. As a result, upon his arrival in Ceuta, Noronha was surprised to hear that a treaty had been signed to evacuate the garrison he had just been appointed to command. Moreover, Prince Henry had sailed directly from Tangier to Ceuta and barricaded himself in his lodgings, sunk in a deep depression and refusing to talk with anyone. Noronha was not sure how to proceed. By several accounts, Fernando de Noronha was determined not to lose this lucrative perch (his predecessor had made a substantial personal fortune from ransoms and pirate kickbacks.) Noronha probably had a role in stiffening Henry's resolve to write to King Edward from Ceuta, recommending the Portuguese renege on the treaty he had himself signed. But Henry's older brother, Peter of Coimbra, was set on fulfilling the treaty and securing Ferdinand release. In 1440, after Edward died and Peter became regent of the realm, ambassadors were dispatched to Asilah to negotiate the logistics of the swap of Ceuta for the captive Ferdinand. The Marinids' preliminary condition was that Fernando de Noronha be relieved from the office of governor of Ceuta - his reputation was such that the Marinid officials were certain Noronha would contrive to prevent the swap. Peter agreed, and in April 1440 (or 1441), he dispatched D. Fernando de Castro at the head of a Portuguese flotilla, with instructions and credentials to take the city from Noronha, and begin the evacuation of the garrison. As it happens, before his arrival, Castro's flotilla was intercepted by Genoese pirates and Castro killed - an incident in which some suspected Noronha might have had a hand (Ceuta had long served as a corsair's nest). Nonetheless, Peter of Coimbra hurriedly instructed Fernando's son, Álvaro de Castro, to take over his father's credentials and fulfill the mission. As it happens, the logistics of the swap turned out to be more complicated than anticipated. Abu Zakariya Yahya al-Wattasi, the vizier of the Marinid palace of Fez, promised to deliver Ferdinand only after Ceuta was evacuated and in his hands, but Castro (under the watchful eye and counsel of Noronha) rejected the proposal, demanding possession of Ferdinand first. Negotiations dragged on fruitlessly for the next few months, and eventually broke down. The swap was never undertaken, Ceuta remained in Portuguese hands and Ferdinand perished in Moroccan captivity in June 1443. Fernando de Noronha died in Ceuta in June 1445. Fernando de Noronha and Brites de Menezes had two sons: \n*  Pedro de Menezes, 3rd Count (1st Marquis) of Vila Real (from which stems the Portuguese noble house of Count of Vila Real) \n*  João de Noronha, Lord of Sortelha (from which stems the Portuguese noble house of Count of Monsanto)"

  "text" : "Friedrich \"Fritz\" Glatz (July 21, 1943 – July 14, 2002) was an Austrian racing driver from Vienna. He raced under the pseudonyms Pierre Chauvet and Frederico Careca as well as a number of others. Glatz began his career in 1980 racing in the German Formula Three Championship. The following year he drove in that series as well as the European Formula Three Championship and made his European Formula Two Championship debut. He competed in 10 Formula Two races in 1982 for Bertram Schäfer Racing but failed to score points, with a best finish of 8th. In 1983 again made 10 Formula Two starts, this time for Emco Sports but only succeeded in finishing twice and scored no points. In 1984 he returned to Emco Sports and finally broke into the points with a 6th place at Donington Park, with his single point good enough for 15th in the championship. Formula Two gave way to International Formula 3000 in 1985 and \"Chauvet\" only attempted two races with Oreca, failing to finish both races. In 1986 he drove in Formula 3000 nearly full-time for Jordan Racing but had a best finish of just 14th and he failed to qualify once. He also drove in two World Sports-Prototype Championship races for two different teams. Glatz was away from racing in 1987 but in 1988 returned to Formula 3000 at 45 years of age racing full-time for Racetech 3000. However, after 3 failures to qualify in 6 races, he left the team and went to Madgwick International. His best finish on the season was 12th, out of the points. He also made 3 World Sports-Prototype Championship starts. In 1989 he made one start in the inaugural season of British Formula 3000, which was good enough for 13th in points. He made a handful of sports car starts throughout the 1990s, mainly in Interserie. In 2002 he was driving a 1996-vintage Arrows Footwork FA17 Formula One car in a EuroBOSS race at Autodrom Most when his car bounced over a curb and became airborne. Glatz died from his injuries."

  "text" : "Frederic Adolph Hoefer (14 April 1850 – 7 October 1938) was a Dutch lieutenant-general, militaria collector and archivist. He trained at the Koninklijke Militaire Academie and is notable for founding the Legermuseum and restoring Doorwerth Castle. Hoefer was born in Sittard and was in the middle of a successful military career when a fall from his horse in 1880 forced him to take honorable leave from the service. He began to write historical works, starting with the history of public clocks, when he was invited to work on the archives of Hattem, where he became the unpaid city archivist in 1895, a position he kept until 1931. Among other things, he is remembered there for his many publications on the history of Hattem, and his commission to restore the Dijkpoort as a new location for the Hattem archives. In 1894 he became director of the Provinciaal Overijsselsch Geschiedkundig Museum in Zwolle, a position that he also kept until 1931. Under his direction, that museum moved to its present location the 1551 patrician building Drostenhuis. From 1903 he was active in the monumentenzorg and was responsible for saving the buildings Gothische Huis in Kampen, the city hall of Hasselt, Huis Helmich in Zwolle, and the Romanesque church in Wilsum. He is remembered most today for founding the museum Het Koninklijk Leger- en Wapenmuseum in Castle Doorwerth, which was bombed during October, 1944. The remnants of the collection are in the Legermuseum in Delft. A memorial to him was placed in Doorwerth on the occasion of his 80th birthday. Hoefer died in Zeist."

He was admitted to practice before the High Court of Justice in Grenada on December 10, 1980, having earned his LLM (1976), LLB (1973) and BA (1971) from the University of the West Indies (UWI), Cave Hill, Barbados. Alexis also holds a PhD in Public Law (1980) from the University of Cambridge, England and an LEC (1977) from Hugh Wooding Law School, Trinidad and Tobago. Alexis obtained his secondary education, 1962–68, from the Grenada Boys Secondary School, Grenada. Alexis was appointed Queen’s Counsel in the Eastern Caribbean on August 7, 2008. Alexis is a practising Catholic. He has been married to Margaret Alexis née De Bique since 1973. He is the father of three and grandfather of one. Alexis has been active in Grenadian politics since 1983; while in exile in Barbados during Maurice Bishop's People's Revolutionary Government (PRG), he founded the Grenada Democratic Movement (GDM) as an alliance of various exile groups opposed to the Bishop regime. The GDM later merged with the Grenada National Party (led by Herbert Blaize) and the National Democratic Party (led by George Brizan) in August 1984 to create the New National Party (NNP). In 1987, Alexis, along with George Brizan, broke with the NNP to form the National Democratic Congress (NDC). He subsequently broke with the NDC, and has since founded the Democratic Labor Party  (DLP) and the People's Labour Movement (PLM)."

  "text" : "Colonel Francis \"Duke\" Xavier Kane, Ph.D., USAF, retired, (December 12, 1918 – July 18, 2013 ) is the space planner and engineer responsible for the design concept of the Global Positioning System (GPS). Colonel Kane was General Bernard A. Schriever's Chief for Space and Ballistic Missile Planning at the U.S. Air Force Systems Command from 1961-1970. Colonel Kane was a participant in Project Forecast (1963–1964). Project Forecast was the longest range technology forecast undertaken by the U.S. military prior to 1963. Project Forecast contemplated the strategic technological environment of 1975 and the requirements for U.S. advancements in air, space, missile and computer technology. In 1963, the Air Force Space Systems Division funded Colonel Kane to lead a classified project known as 621B. Phase I of 621B was for the engineering concept for a \"space-based navigation system\" that would later become known as the Global Positioning System (GPS/NAVSTAR). According to Colonel Brad Parkinson (USAF, retired), Project 621B had \"many of the attributes that you now see in GPS. It has probably never been given its due credit.\" Colonel Kane formed the 621B team consisting of Air Force engineers and Aerospace corporation contractors in Los Angeles to lay the foundation for GPS development. The concept of operations established in Phase I was for a space-based system enabling 3-dimensional location (longitude, latitude, and altitude) globally, in all weather, at all times transmitting on a frequency established by the Scientific Advisory Board. The satellites use a time-differ-ence-of-arrival concept using precise satellite posi-tion and on-board atomic clocks to continuously generate navigation messages that can be receivedby users anywhere on Earth. The engineering concept addressed that a minimum of 24 satellites would be required for global coverage, at an altitude of 10,000 nautical miles, at 55 degrees inclination, and powered by hybrid solar and battery energy sources. From 1964 to 1966, several Aerospace corporation team members made outstanding contributions to GPS studies on the U.S. Air Force 621B team led by Colonel Kane. \"These men included of Phil Diamonds, Peter W. Soule, James B. Woodford, Alfred Bogen, Richard Dutcher, Howard F. Marx, and Hideyoshi Nakamura. It was Nakamura and some of his coworkers who suggested that range measurements for an aircraft should be calculated using signals from four satellites. The aircraft's crewmembers could then obtain a three-dimensional position by measuring four distinct differences in the signals' arrival times and then adding these to a clock connected to a quartz oscillator. Each satellite would also have its own clock, which would be updated continuously by ground signals. In essence, this was the operational concept that eventually led to GPS as it is known today.\" In 1967, under Phase II of 621B, system design, Colonel Kane and a team from TRW refined the concept of operation, performed engineering design for multiple systems, began test programs for receivers, conceptualized satellite control and operations including on-orbit tracking (satellite/star tracking), and preliminary design of the GPS satellites. For his role in space technology development and the engineering design concept of GPS, Colonel Kane was inducted into the U.S. Air Force Space and Missile Pioneers Hall of Fame at Lackland A.F.B., San Antonio, Texas, March 2, 2010. Colonel Kane's role in space systems development is authenticated by the U.S. Air Force Space and Missile Command including: \"Concepts forwarded by Colonel Kane during the 1960s included space-based missile warning (Defense Support Program), space-based missile defense, manned maneuvering reentry vehicles (Space Shuttle), detection and attack of mobile missiles, laser anti-satellite weapons [ASAT], the advanced ballistic missile (MX or Peacekeeper), and a navigation satellite (NAVSTAR/GPS) system.\" Colonel Kane's role in U.S. national competitiveness, innovation and security is one of planner, design engineer, and technology strategist. He conceptualized a systems approach to space planning that provided a platform upon which General Schriever executed a high technology defense strategy to build the U.S. Air Force space and missile capability—ushering in the Space Age. The book \"Strategy of Technology\" (1970) sets forth the doctrine flowing from the early plans developed by Project Forecast and the development and deployment of the Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM) system. Initially, Kane was unnamed in the 1970 publication of the book. Stefan T. Possony and Jerry Pournelle were able to later add Colonel Kane's attribution in 1972 after he retired (1970). The strategy of technology doctrine is exemplified by opponents' economies failing to keep pace with investments in high technology countermeasures. The doctrine is exemplified by a systems approach to engineering, science and acquisition. After the 1980 election, President-elect Ronald Reagan asked General Schriever to prepare position papers on space policy and defense for the incoming administration. General Schriever asked Duke to prepare the papers, and Duke asked his friend and coauthor Jerry Pournelle to arrange a meeting of qualified people to work on it. The meeting included more than fifty aerospace scientists and participants including Buzz Aldrin, General Daniel Graham, rocket engineer Max Hunter, George Merrick the North American manager of the Shuttle program. They also invited Dr. Stefan Possony, science fiction writers Poul Anderson and Robert Heinlein, Writer/engineer G. Harry Stine, and members of Edward Teller's team. The group met several times before and after the Reagan inauguration, and the papers, which advocated a policy of technological strategy and strategic defense, are said by many to have influenced President Reagan's \"Star Wars\" speech of 1983. During the summer of 2011 Duke collaborated with his friend Hu Davis (SolarHigh.org and Vehicle Manager Lunar Capsule 5, \"Eagle\", Apollo 11 and a participant in the 1980 space policy preparations; and a group of high school students led by Evan Gray from RAM STEM Academy in San Antonio, Texas on the future of space exploration including Space-Based Solar Power, Lunar, and Mars missions. During the “Solar Summer of 2011”, Duke led the high school team through a process that yielded the following thinking about the future: The “cloud” (cyber) and space are energy. The rockets, satellites, receiving stations,electrical grid, cars, homes and businesses that consume space-based solar power are all robots. Thus, space-based solar power is one platform (the cloud) for energy, computing, communications, and robotics: Cloud 2.0. Duke’s intellectual gift was a deep and impassioned ability to think, dream, imagine,question, reason, plan, and share his vision so that others could carry these designs into the future. One of Duke's greatest concerns in his last days of work was the promotion of “creativity” and “collaboration” in the context of all that we do: from primary school education to international cooperation in cyber/space. For Duke, creativity and collaboration are the two most important qualities to engender in our pursuit of national security and economic competitiveness. Duke’s legacy of creativity and collaboration is all around us: From the freedom we enjoy everyday to the boom of hypersonic flight; however, for Duke his greatest achievement was in creating the Global Positioning System (GPS/NAVSTAR) so that we can all find our way home."

  "text" : "Fritz Tschannen (13 May 1920 – 23 March 2011) was a Swiss accordion player and former ski jumper who competed at the 1948 Winter Olympics in St. Moritz. Born in Saint-Imier, he received his first accordion at the age of five and gave his first solo concert three years later. By the age of 18 he was working as an accordion teacher, in addition to ski jumping out of Skiclub Adelboden. He joined the Swiss National Team in 1945 and attended the Winter Olympic Games three years later, where he placed ninth in a field of forty-nine competitors in the men's normal hill event. That same year he became the Swiss national ski jumping champion and set a new world record with a jump of 120 metres. After his experience at the Olympics, Tschannen was invited to train with the United States team, but moved to Canada when he was denied a work visa because of the ongoing Korean War. He had a career with the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation from 1952–1954 as a musician and orchestrator, including a stint with his own French-language television show. He returned to his native country in 1964 and founded a musical school in the city of Bex. He worked as a conductor until 1999, when he retired to the municipality of Fleurier. He died in Val-de-Travers in March 2011."

On his retirement in 1994 he was presented with a festschrift containing essays by 20 eminent academics from the disciplines of linguistics and the history of science. Contributors included J. W. Allan (Oxford), Giles Barber (Oxford), Silvio Bedini (Washington), John Bergsagel (Copenhagen), John North (Groningen), Brian Scott (Belfast), Charles Dowsett (Oxford). Maddison's first wife was Audrey Kent (died 2004), with whom he had a daughter and a son. He had another son with his second wife, Patricia Brown."

  "text" : "Vernon Francis Douglas (1910-1943) was a priest of the Missionary Society of St. Columban who was killed in the Philippines by Japanese soldiers in 1943. He was born in Johnsonville, near Wellington, New Zealand, the fifth of eight children (five sons and three daughters) of Kathleen Gaffney and her husband, George Charles Douglas, an Australian-born railway worker. His mother was a devout Catholic from County Sligo, Ireland, and his father became a Catholic in 1926. Douglas trained for the Catholic priesthood at Holy Cross Seminary, Mosgiel. Within a few months of his ordination, at the end of 1934, he applied to join the Missionary Society of St. Columban. He was curate at New Plymouth when he left to join the society at the start of 1937. He was appointed to the Philippines in July 1939. He was posted to Pililla. Five years later during the Japanese occupation he was taken by secret police looking for information on guerillas who were very active in his area. Over three days in the Church of Saint James the Apostle, in Paete, Laguna, he was savagely beaten and had a cruel torture of the water cure, the presumption being that police were trying to extort information from him about guerillas whose confessions he may have heard. He remained silent through it all, and was last seen on the evening of 27 July 1943, very weak but still conscious, being put on a truck with a guard of Japanese soldiers. He was not seen again and his grave has never been found. It was only after the liberation of the Philippines from Japanese occupation at the end of 1944 that the Columbans could start to piece his story together. What emerged was a picture of a priest, aged 33, who could be regarded as a martyr, having demonstrated outstanding priestly fidelity (especially to the Seal of Confession). He is remembered in the name of a boys college in New Plymouth, Francis Douglas Memorial College."

  "text" : "Volkhovsky was arrested again in 1874 and was a defendant at the 1878 'Trial of the 193'. Banished to Siberia, he escaped in 1889 via America. Volkhovsky was involved in 'Land and Liberty' and, when that group split in 1879, in 'The People's Will'. After escaping from Siberia, he made his way to Western Europe, eventually settling in London. He worked for the Free Russian Press and was a close friend and collaborator of the revolutionary writer S.M. Stepniak-Kravchinsky. In fact, Stepniak was on his way to visit Volkhovsky when he was killed by a train in 1895. Volkhovsky thereafter took over Stepniak's editorial duties at the journal Free Russia. Volkhovsky served as a bridge-builder within the Russian opposition movement and between Russian radicals and the Western European public. He was in contact with older Russian émigrés of the generation of A.I. Herzen and young 'nihilists', with anarchists as well as political revolutionaries, with Russian social revolutionaries as well as liberals. He helped bring together Russian and Ukrainian social revolutionaries, protested against pogroms in Russia and resisted anti-Semitic tendencies in the Russian revolutionary movement. He also did his best to represent the Russian opposition movement to the West, maintaining contacts with British, French and German socialist parties, contributing articles to British and Americal papers (including the New York Times) and writing pamphlets aimed at a Western audience. He was involved in the Anglo-American Society of Friends of Russian Freedom. In the early 1900s (decade), Volkhovsky joined the Socialist-Revolutionary Party."

  "text" : "Francisco Riba-Rovira also known as Francesc, (born Barcelona 1913, died Paris 2002) was a Catalan and a Spanish painter. He worked to pay for his Beaux-Arts studies in Barcelona. He succeeded in this for one or two months before the start of the Spanish Civil War, in which he fought against the rebellion led by Francisco Franco against the established Government of the Second Spanish Republic. After the war he was forced into exile in France, first in Perpignan or near to be in a Camp as prisoner on a beach. The Second World War began a few months later. In Gertrude Stein's exhibition preface, it notes that Riba-Rovira was arrested by the Gestapo. The Nazi soldiers who kept him prisoner were Netherlands Nazi SS. After an attempted escape for the second time he succeeded to escape from this camp, which was near Vannes in French Britain, he chose the day it was raining a lot for impeach the dogs feeling after him. And for that he had to fight against one Nazi SS Dutch soldier. He did it.After the war he talked about, that he learned what a few days after he escapes from the camp, a train was made by the Nazis for red Spanish republican soldiers for expedition to Mathausen. And very few people know that this Mathausen camp was harder than Dachau and even Buchenwald Dora just below Auschwitz for concentration camp part. Mathausen was the only one concentration camp put in the category number 3. He met Gertrude Stein when she was passing by with her dog \"Basket\" on the Seine docks. The following is a translation from Stein's preface to the exhibition by Francisco Riba-Rovira at Roquepine Gallery in May 1945: It is inevitable that when we really need someone we find him. The person you need attracts you like a magnet. I returned to Paris after these long years spent in the countryside and I needed a young painter, a young painter who would awaken me. Paris was magnificent, but where was the young painter? I looked everywhere: at my contemporaries and their followers. I walked a lot, I looked everywhere, in all the galleries, but the young painter was not there. Yes, I walk a lot, a lot at the edge of the Seine where we fish, where we paint, where we walk dogs (I am one of those who walk their dogs). Not a single young painter! One day, on the corner of a street, in one of these small streets in my district, I saw a man painting. I looked at him; at him and at his painting, as I always look at everybody who creates something I have an indefatigable curiosity to look and I was moved. Yes, a young painter! We began to speak, because we speak easily, as easily as in country roads, in the small streets of the district. His story was the sad story of the young people of our time. A young Spaniard who studied in fine arts in Barcelona: civil war; exile; a concentration camp; escape. Gestapo, another prison, another escape. Eight lost years! If they were lost, who knows? And now a little misery, but all the same the painting. Why did I find that it was him the young painter, why? I visited his drawings, his painting: we speak. I explained that for me, all modern painting is based on what Cézanne nearly made, instead of basing itself on what he almost managed to make. When he could not make a thing, he hijacked it and left it. He insisted on showing his incapacity: he spread his lack of success: showing what he could not do, became an obsession for him. People influenced by him were also obsessed by the things which they could not reach and they began the system of camouflage. It was natural to do so, even inevitable:that soon became an art, in peace and in war, and Matisse concealed and insisted at the same time on that Cézanne could not realize, and Picasso concealed, played and tormented all these things. The only one who wanted to insist on this problem, was Juan Gris. He persisted by deepening the things which Cézanne wanted to do, but it was too hard a task for him: it killed him. And now here we are, I find a young painter who does not follow the tendency to play with what Cézanne could not do, but who attacks any right the things which he tried to make, to create the objects which have to exist, for, and in themselves, and not in relation. This young painter has his weakness and his strength. His force will push him in this road. I am fascinated and that is why he is the young painter who I needed. He is Francisco Riba-Rovira. Riba-Rovira belongs the artistic institution the Modern School of Paris. When Rovira was living in Paris, before staying on Guénégaud Street where his flat \"atelier\" was, he went for a short time in front of the Seine near the Notre Dame de Paris, in the building just in front of the Police Prefecture where Matisse got his work place. But Paco, as he was nicknamed did not stay there long. So Guénégaud street was his main residence in France where he stays still his end of his life. He did an exposition in 1954 in Bernheim Jeune in Paris, and in 1955 in Passedoit Gallery in New York. Riba-Rovira often said that it was very difficult for a painter born after the Impressionists, although he was influenced significantly by the Impressionist style. Sisley and Pissarro were among his major inspirations. With the Spanish painters, Riba-Rovira had a preference for Goya, and admiration for Goya's political views throughout Goya's artworks. ((This needs to be edited into some semblance of organisation. This article is ridiculous. The individual who wrote this has no comprehension of English and correct structure. -Anonymous grammar editor.))--04/08/15 Not to quote even how his meeting with Bazile Muro by 1983 that is approximately six years after his meeting with Sahagun former Minister of Defence of the democratic transition in Spain and the attempt of coup d'état on the seventies last century. Basilio Muro indeed moved at least twice in Paris in his artist workplace studio of the street Guénégaud next to street of the Seine river and the Pont Neuf in the district St Germain des Prés to see his works. Her portrait appearing in the catalog, with the Gertrude Stein’s preface, in first place in the plaque of display for the exhibition of Gallerie Roquépine on 1945 is displayed for approximately one year since last June in successively several places in the U.S.A. We speak naturally about the portrait of Gertrude Stein by Riba-Rovira on 1945. Perhaps the last one made by a painter before she died. And you can see it now. It began thanks to a whole series of exhibitions in touch with the collection of Gertrude Stein and of her family in the United States. These family collection of the family Stein is exposed, and the famous portrait which we did not know, since more sixty five years, in San Francisco from June till September.After now from October till January in Washington. And then to finish to the Museum of Modern Art of New York since February to June 2012.And you can see this portrait in the both catalogs of the international exhibitions. It is a big event for him, Francisco Riba-Rovira, this year. And we wanted to tell you that. Perhaps since his meeting with Gertrude Stein even if he is dead now.

  "text" : "Francis Barber Ogden (1783-1857) was United States consul, in Liverpool from 1829 to 1840 and then in Bristol. Ogden had a long-standing interest in steam engines and, soon after becoming consul in Liverpool, attended the Rainhill Trials where he met and befriended John Ericsson. Ogden helped finance Ericsson's researches over the next few years, while personally patenting Ericsson's inventions in the United States - which Ericsson, not being an American citizen, would not have been able to do before 1836. These inventions culminated in that of screw-propelled steamboats - for these, Ericsson's rival Francis Pettit Smith obtained the British patent but Ogden, on Ericsson's behalf, obtained the American patent. Ericsson named his first screw-propelled steamboat Francis B. Ogden - this boat was demonstrated to the British Admiralty, but rejected by them. Ogden now introduced Ericsson to one of his business associates, Robert Stockton, who would become Ericsson's next patron and induce him to move to America. Ogden was a member of the Society of Cincinnati. He was buried at Arnos Vale Cemetery, Bristol, England. His monument there consists of an obelisk adorned with a coat of arms: Paly of 12, a chief charged with thirty-two mullets (five-pointed stars) 12,9 and 11. Above the shield a bald-headed eagle displayed holding in its dexter claw an olive branch, in its sinister claw a sheaf of six arrows. Beneath the shield, on a scroll, the motto: E Pluribus Unum. The inscription runs: \"Sacred to the Memory of Francis ..... Ogden, A Member of the Society of the Cincinnati  and Consul of the United States of America for this Port. Born at Boonton in the State of New Jersey, U.S.A., March 3rd 1783. Died at his Residence in this City, July 4th 1857, aged 74 years, having Served his Country during a Period of Twenty-Eight Years.\""

He was signed by Liverpool on July 17, 1945 and subsequently loaned to Forfar having failed to break into the Liverpool first team from Liverpool's Central League reserve side. Forfar signed Christie permanently at the end of the 1945/46 season, where he enjoyed three years at the club before rejoining Liverpool F.C in March 1949. He played in four of Liverpool's League matches towards the end of the 1949–50 season, making his debut in defence alongside the likes of Bob Paisley and Phil Taylor in a fixture away to Manchester United on 15 March 1950 at Old Trafford (Theatre of Dreams) before a crowd of 45,283. In January 1951, East Fife paid Liverpool an £8,000 transfer fee to bring Christie back to Bayview. He spent the large part of his playing career at East Fife, and scored the winning goal in East Fife's 3–2 victory over Partick Thistle in the 1953–54 Scottish League Cup Final at Hampden Park, Glasgow in front of 38,529."

Buller was the son of Sir Richard Buller, of Shillingham, Cornwall. The Buller family was originally from Somerset and acquired Shillingham in around 1555. He entered Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge in 1620 and matriculated at the Inner Temple in 1622. In 1624, Buller was elected Member of Parliament for Saltash and was re-elected in 1625. In April 1640, Buller was elected MP for Saltash in the Short Parliament. He was elected MP for East Looe for the Long Parliament in November 1640 and sat until he was excluded under Pride's Purge in 1648. During the Civil War he commanded a regiment for the Parliamentary army at Plymouth. He subsequently moved to Kent. Buller married Thomasine Honeywood, daughter of Sir Thomas Honeywood of Elmstead Kent. His sons Francis and John were also MPs in Cornwall."

  "text" : "Frederick William Cundiff (17 November 1895 – 7 August 1982) was a British soldier, politician and businessman. He was the son of Sir Wiliam Cundiff, a prominent businessman and politician in Manchester who held the office of Lord Mayor in 1922-23. During the First World War Cundiff served in the Royal Field Artillery (RFA), later transferring to the Royal Flying Corps. Following the war he joined the part-time reserve Territorial Army, returning to the RFA. He was promoted to the rank of major in 1924. He retired from the TA in 1930. With the outbreak of the Second World War Cundiff received a commission as a lieutenant in the Royal Navy Volunteer Reserve. In June 1944, Edmund Ashworth Radford, the member of parliament for Manchester Rusholme, died. Cundiff was selected to contest the resulting byelection for the Conservative Party. Under a wartime political pact, the parties forming the coalition government agreed not to contest vacancies although he was opposed by a Common Wealth Party and an independent candidate. The poll was held on 8 July, and Cundiff was elected with a majority of 1,760 votes over the Common Wealth candidate. He was to remain as Rusholme's member of parliament for less than a year, as he was defeated by Lester Hutchinson of the Labour Party when a general election was held in 1945 by a margin of 11 votes. The Representation of the People Act 1948 reorganised constituencies throughout Great Britain, and Cundiff was chosen by the Conservatives to contest the Manchester Withington Borough Constituency which was formed from parts of the previous Rusholme and Withington seats. The new constituency was first contested at the 1950 general election, and he won the seat comfortably with a majority of over 8,500 votes over his Labour challenger. When a further general election was called in the following year, Cundiff chose to retire from the Commons. After parliament Cundiff took up another of directorships in companies including serving as chairman of Threlfalls Brewery."

Since 1978 he has been at Yale University, where he is at present J. W. Gibbs professor for physics and chemistry. Iachello received the Chiaudano prize in 1968 and was a Fulbright Fellow in 1964. He was awarded in 1990 the Wigner Medal, in 1991 both the Taormina Prize and the Dutch AKZO Prize, and in 1993, along with Akito Arima, the Tom W. Bonner Prize of the American Physical Society. Iachello became a foreign member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1996. He is also member of the Croatian Academy of Sciences. In 1997 he received the Centennial Prize of the Italian Physical Society. In 2002 he received the Meitner Prize of the European Physical Society. He has honorary doctorates from the University of Ferrara, the University of Seville, and the Chung Yuan University in China. Iachello is famous for the application of algebraic methods (Lie algebras) to the investigation of the spectra of atomic nuclei and molecules. In 1974 with Akito Arima he introduced the \"Interacting Boson Model\" into nuclear physics. This important model describes collective nuclear states with the help of the unitary group U(6). The underlying concept is to derive a model with pairs of neutrons and protons instead of unpaired nucleons. The pairs are treated as bosons with different quantum spin (s- and d- bosons, as named according to spin 0 and 2). In an extension of the model, the analogous effect with unpaired fermions has a description using supersymmetrical algebras. In recent times he has worked mainly on the investigation of the quantum mechanical dynamics of molecules (e.g. quantum phase transitions, polymer dynamics) with algebraic methods, on which Iachello already began to work in 1981 (Vibron Model)."

He was also an illustrator and produced six volumes of Lepidoptera Indica and a catalogue of the birds in the collection of the East India Company. It has been said that Moore was born at 33 Bruton Street but may be incorrect given that this was the address of the menagerie and office of the Zoological Society of London from 1826 to 1836. Moore was appointed an assistant in the East India Company Museum London from 31 May 1848 on a \"disestablished basis\" and became a Temporary Writer and then an Assistant Curator at the East India Museum with a pension of £330 per annum from 31 December 1879. He had a daughter Rosa Martha Moore. He began compiling Lepidoptera indica (1890–1913), a major work on the butterflies of the South Asia in 10 volumes, which was completed after his death by Charles Swinhoe. Many of the plates were produced by his son while some others were produced by E C Knight and John Nugent Fitch. Many species of butterfly were described by him in this work. \"Moore entered the doors of entomology by way of his artistic abilities. Dr. T. Horsfield (1777–1859), long associated with the East India Museum, required someone capable of doing natural history drawings and, through an introduction, Frederic Moore obtained the post. Thus began a lifetime association with Indian Lepidoptera\" Moore's son F. C. Moore was also an artist and prepared many of the plates in Lepidoptera Indica. Moore's brother T. J. Moore was a curator at the Liverpool Museum for forty years and his son Thomas Francis Moore was an osteologist at the National Museum at Melbourne. Moore was an associate of the Linnean Society of London, a member of the Entomological Society of London, a corresponding member of the Entomological Society of Stettin and of the Entomological Society of the Netherlands. His other works included A catalogue of the birds in the museum of the East-India Company (1854–58, with Thomas Horsfield) and The Lepidoptera of Ceylon (1880–87)."

  "text" : "Fedor Ivanovich Buslaev (Russian: Фёдор Ива́нович Бусла́ев; April 25, 1818 – August 12, 1898) was a Russian Empire philologist, art historian, and folklorist who represented the Mythological school of comparative literature and linguistics. He was profoundly influenced by Jacob Grimm and Theodor Benfey. Buslaev was educated at Penza and Moscow University. At the end of his academical course, 1838, he accompanied the family of Count S.G. Stroganov on a tour through Italy, Germany and France, occupying himself principally with the study of classical antiquities. On his return he was appointed assistant professor of Russian literature at the University of Moscow. A study of Jacob Grimm's great dictionary had already directed the attention of the young professor to the historical development of the Russian language, and the fruit of his studies was the book On the Teaching of the National Language (Moscow, 1844 and 1867), which even now has its value. In 1848 he produced his work On the Influence of Christianity on the Slavonic Language, which was considered a milestone in the study of the development of the Slavonic languages. In this work Buslaev proves that long before the age of Cyril and Methodius the Slavonic languages had been subject to Christian influences. In 1855 he published Palaeographical and Philological Materials for the History of the Slavonic Alphabets, and in 1858 Essay Towards an Historical Grammar of the Russian Tongue, abounding with rich material for students, carefully collected from an immense quantity of ancient records and monuments. In close connection with this work in his Historical Chrestomathy of the Church-Slavonic and Old Russian Tongues (Moscow, 1861). He was elected a member of the St. Petersburg Academy of Sciences in 1860. Buslaev also interested himself in Russian popular poetry and old Russian art, and the result of his labors is enshrined in Historical Sketches of Russian Folk Literature and Art (St. Petersburg, 1861), a very valuable collection of articles and monographs, in which the author shows himself a worthy and faithful disciple of Grimm. His Folk Poetry (St. Petersburg, 1887) is a valuable supplement to the Sketches. In 1881 he was appointed professor of Russian literature at Moscow, and three years later published his Annotated Apocalypse with an atlas of 400 plates, illustrative of ancient Russian art. In his advanced age Buslaev was to a large degree incapacitated by blindness and passed his time in dictating his memoirs to a secretary. Buslaev's work in the field of comparative literature was continued by his numerous students, notably Alexander Veselovsky."

  "text" : "Fabius Valens of Anagnia (d. 69) was a Roman commander favoured by Nero. In 69 he was commander of Legio I Germanica based in Germania Inferior. When the troops refused to endorse the new emperor Galba after Nero's death, he had them proclaim Vitellius, the governor of Germania Inferior, as emperor. The forces supporting Vitellius were divided into two armies for the march on Rome, one of them commanded by Valens. Valens' troops took a route through Gaul, probably to recruit additional soldiers, before eventually joining with the other Vitellian army, led by Caecina, at Cremona. By then Galba had been killed and Otho had been proclaimed emperor at Rome. Otho's forces met the combined Vitellian armies at the first Battle of Bedriacum. Valens and Caecina won a decisive victory, and Otho committed suicide when he heard the news of his army's defeat. Vitellius was able to make a triumphant entry into Rome. However, the armies in the east had proclaimed Vespasian as emperor, and two armies supporting Vespasian marched on Rome. The first to reach Italy was composed of five legions from Pannonia and Moesia, commanded by Antonius Primus. Valens was ill at the time, so that the force that Vitellius despatched from Rome to counter this threat was commanded by Caecina. Caecina tried to betray Vitellius and proclaim Vespasian as emperor, but his army refused to follow his lead, and put him in chains. By this time Valens had recovered from his illness and was on his way to join the army, but before he could arrive, the second Battle of Bedriacum had been fought and the Vitellian forces defeated by Antonius. Valens tried to continue the struggle, and departed by ship from Pisa for Gaul to try to raise new troops. He put in at Hercules Monoecus (modern Monaco) but was advised not to try to march inland as a procurator named Valerius Paulus had raised a strong force from former members of Otho's Praetorian Guard. These had been dismissed from the service after Vitellius' victory, but were only too ready to re-enlist to support Vitellius' rival. Valens therefore sailed on, and was cast up by a storm on the Stoechades (modern Iles d'Hyeres, near Toulon). Here he was caught by surprise by some galleys sent after him by Valerius Paulinus, and captured. Paulinus sent him back to Italy, where he was executed by beheading at Urvinum (modern Urbino). His head was taken to Narni to be shown to the Vitellian troops who were still resisting there and had been hoping that Valens would return with reinforcements. The sight of Valens' head was enough to persuade them to surrender. One anecdote says that he appeared on the music-stage hall at Nero's coming of age celebrations, not at the command of Nero but voluntarily. At the time this was frowned upon, and many people thought that he was merely a man of fashion."

The design left out some of the richer elements of De Sanctis's original design, such as grand fountains at a break in the steps and two rows of trees down either side to give shade and refreshment to those climbing the steps. His other known works are the elegant facade of the church of Trinità dei Pellegrini, with a concave profile, an 18th-century version of San Marcello al Corso by Carlo Fontana and Borsani Claudio."

  "text" : "King Fergus I (said to have flourished c. 330 B.C.), is generally identified as the son of Ferchard, Prince of Scots in Ireland. The \"first king of Scotland\", according to the fictitious chronologies of Boece and Buchanan, is said to have come to Scotland from Ireland about 330 B.C. to assist the Scots already settled in Scotland against the joint attack of the Picts and Britons. After succeeding in this he is further said to have gone back to Ireland to quell disturbances which had arisen in his absence, and to have been drowned in the passage off the port which got the name of Carrickfergus from him. According to Fordoun, Wyntoun, and most of the earlier genealogical lists of Scottish kings, the same account is given of the settlement of the Scots from Ireland by a King Fergus, son of Ferchard. According to others of the lists, Ferchard or Feardach, the father of Fergus, was the first and Fergus the second king. There follows a series of thirty-nine or forty-five kings between Fergus I and Fergus II, son of Earc. The critical insight of Father Innes demolished these fabulous lists of kings, and put the chronology of Scottish history on a sound foundation, by his proof that Fergus II, son of Earc, who came to Scotland about the end of the fifth century A.D., was in reality the first Dál Riata king in Scotland. Innes's results have been adopted by subsequent historians. The invention and persistent acceptance during so many centuries, from the twelfth to the eighteenth, of a fabulous series of kings is, though not unparalleled, a singular specimen of the genealogical myth which flatters the vanity of nations as of families. It is supposed to have been due to the desire to establish a higher antiquity for the Scottish race, royal line, and church, than could be claimed for the Irish or English. It is of course not inconsistent with the rectified chronology of Innes that even prior to 503 A.D. there may have been Celts of the Scottish race settled in Scotland. Scots had aided the Picts in opposing the Romans in the fourth century, and Bede evidently inclines to an earlier date for the Scottish settlement. All that can be safely said is that there is no proof of any Dál Riata kingdom till the commencement of the sixth century, and that the account given by Boece and Buchanan of Fergus, the son of Ferchard, and his successors, is as devoid of historical foundation as the statement that \"his coming into Albion was at the time when Alexander the Great took Babylon, about 330 years before the birth of Christ\". Buchanan, from whom this sentence is quoted, attempts to save his own credit by prefixing the words \"historians say that\", but by adopting it he became himself one of these historians, and gave the fabulous narrative a prolonged existence. Father Innes presses somewhat hardly on Boece, for the origin of this narrative dates back at least as early as the twelfth century, but the special blame undoubtedly attaches to Boece and still more to Buchanan that they clothed the dry list of names with characters, and invented events or incidents which gave the narrative more of the semblance of history."

He was subsequently said to have been freed. On 20 February, Terbil told Al Jazeera that security forces - sometimes firing from civilian cars without license plates - had killed dozens, perhaps hundreds, of protestors in Benghazi. On 30 May 2011, he was awarded the Ludovic-Trarieux International Human Rights Prize (\"The award given by lawyers to a lawyer\"), given each year to a lawyer who throughout his or her career has illustrated, by activity or suffering, the defence of human rights in the world. He was appointed to the Libyan National Transitional Council representing youth after being one of the first arrested in street protests during the Libyan Civil War on 15 February 2011 and later freed."

  "text" : "France Littlewood (5 August 1863–22 January 1941) was a British socialist activist. Born in Honley, then in the West Riding of Yorkshire, Littlewood studied at Almondbury Grammar School before working in his father's dye works. He joined the Liberal Party, which he represented on Honley Local Union, but left in 1891 to join the new Colne Valley Labour Union. In 1893, he was a founder member of the Independent Labour Party (ILP), and he rapidly rose to prominent, becoming national treasurer in 1896, serving until 1902. He held a seat for the party on Honley Urban District Council from 1895 to 1896. His family's firm was declared bankrupt in 1899, although he and his brothers managed to retain ownership of the mill. At the Colne Valley by-election, 1907, Littlewood was a leading supporter of Victor Grayson, an ILP member who was refused national support because he did not support the Labour Party. Grayson was successful, and Littlewood regained his seat on the Urban District Council, in addition to one on the Board of Guardians. However, the newly renamed Colne Valley Socialist League followed Grayson in moving away from the ILP and towards syndicalism, a position which Littlewood opposed. In 1910, Grayson lost his seat, and the local group split from the ILP, joining the British Socialist Party on its formation, the following year. Littlewood sided with a minority loyal to the ILP. During the First World War, Littlewood served as a sergeant with the Volunteer Battalion of the Duke of Wellington's Regiment. He remained an ILP supporter until 1928, when he resigned in support of Philip Snowden's economic policies."

  "text" : "Franz Heinrich Kleinschmidt (1812–1864) was a German missionary and linguist who worked in southern Africa, now in the region of Namibia. He founded the missionary station and town of Rehoboth and together with Carl Hugo Hahn set up the first Rhenish mission station to the Herero people in Gross Barmen. Kleinschmidt is known for his scientific work on the Nama language. Kleinschmidt was born on 25 October 1812 in the village of Blasheim, today a suburb of Lübbecke, then in the Kingdom of Prussia. He was a trained carpenter and blacksmith. Kleinschmidt became a missionary with the Rhenish Missionary Society, which sent him to Southwestern Africa in response to the request of Jonker Afrikaner, chief of the Oorlam tribe residing there. He arrived in Windhoek in October 1842. When Wesleyan missionaries arrived in 1844, also at the invitation of Jonker Afrikaner, Kleinschmidt and his colleague Carl Hugo Hahn moved northwards into Damaraland in order to avoid conflict with them. Hahn and Kleinschmidt arrived at Otjikango on 31 October 1844. They named the place Barmen (today Gross Barmen) after the headquarters of the Rhenish Missionary Society which was located in Barmen, Germany (today part of Wuppertal), and established the first Rhenish mission station to the Herero there. At that time Jonker Afrikaner oversaw the development of the road network in South-West Africa. Hahn and Kleinschmidt initiated the creation of a path from Windhoek to Barmen via Okahandja, and in 1850 this road, later known as Alter Baiweg (Old Bay Path), was extended via Otjimbingwe to Walvis Bay. This route served as an important trade connection between the coast and Windhoek until the end of the century. Their missionary work was not very successful, and while Hahn visited Europe between 1853 and 1856 to gather support for his endeavors, Kleinschmidt moved back south to the Nama communities, where he founded the mission station and town of Rehoboth in 1845. Kleinschmidt was fluent in Khoekhoegowab (also called Nama or Damara/Nama). Together with the missionary Vollmer he translated the Bible into this language in 1853 and published a Dutch–Nama dictionary in 1855. In August 1864 Oorlams attacked Rehoboth. Kleinschmidt fled to Otjimbingwe but died there of exhaustion on 2 September 1864. He was married to Hanna née Schmelen, daughter of his colleague Heinrich Schmelen."

The estates included Oakes Park, near Sheffield; Wormhill Hall, Derbyshire; and Cotes Hall, which he sold in 1883. In 1862 he was promoted to Lieutenant in the Yorkshire Yeomanry Cavalry. He was J.P. and Deputy Lieutenant for Derbyshire and J.P. for the West Riding of Yorkshire. In 1868 he was High Sheriff of Derbyshire.

  "text" : "Fletcher Stewart Bassett (1847–1893) was an American Naval Officer and author. He was instrumental in establishing the international Folk-Lore Congress of 1893 for the World's Columbian Exposition and founded the Chicago Folk-Lore Society. Bassett was born in Adams County, Kentucky, on December 21, 1847. His literary career began at college, and he volunteered for military service at this time, participating in the American Civil War. He first served with the 188th regiment before enlisting in the US Navy, he was promoted to Lieutenant 1875 and was listed as retired in 1882. While enlisted he developed as a professional writer, submitting articles to newspaper and journals, and contributing to Hammersly's Naval Encyclopedia. His first book was Legends and Superstitions of the Sea (Chicago, London. 1885), and the subject of folklore would become a special interest. Bassett is given much credit for generating popular interest in a field that was acquiring scholarly recognition and developing as a 'science'. In 1892 he published The Folk-Lore Manual; or Questionnaire of the Folk-Lore Society, having assembled the material from a sources provided by a number of sources he had solicited. He became a member of many international societies of literature and folklore, and was active in leading and founding these. Bassett's interest and activism was in an area alive with vigorous disputes as workers sought define the field and gain respectability for its study, his alliance in these theoretical disputes was associated with those investigating the material as literature. In founding the Chicago Folk-Lore Society in 1891, the group's charter took a literary approach to folklore, a position regarded as s with similar societies who sought to establish a scientific treatment of folklore. Through his experience in the navy Bassett had become proficient in many modern languages, and gained experience of foreign peoples, assets which saw him appointed as the Chief Interpreter and Translator of the World's Columbian Exposition of 1893 and chairman of the Folklore Congress of the same year."

  "text" : "Fritz Lang (15 March 1877 Stuttgart - 26 October 1961 Stuttgart), was a German painter, noted for his woodcuts, linocuts, lithographs and book illustrations. Between 1892 and 1894 he was an apprentice decorative painter, after which he attended the Königlich-Württembergische Kunstschule in Stuttgart, and the Karlsruher Akademie. In 1899 he returned to Stuttgart, finding freelance work to generate an income. During this period he produced numerous woodcuts, some of which were purchased by the British Museum, the Königliche Kupferstichkabinett of Stuttgart, and the Hofbibliothek in Vienna. Between 1915 and 1918 during World War I he was conscripted and served with the armed forces. The post-war conditions in Germany were not conducive to artistic expression, and Lang's output was minimal during this period. By 1924 some of his work had been bought by the Victoria and Albert Museum and the Whitworth Art Gallery of Manchester. A trip to the former colony of German East Africa in 1928 inspired Lang, and he produced a large number of woodcuts and paintings with an African theme. During World War II the Allied bombing of Stuttgart destroyed Lang's studio. As a result his works became rare and valuable. Some 330 of his woodblocks survived the war. His animal and bird studies were outstanding, and clearly inspired other German and Austrian artists in their technique and composition. The influence of Japanese woodcut masters on Lang's work is evident."

In April 1880 in Sinsen he married Marie Magdalene Schou (1859–1943), a daughter of Halvor Schou. Their son Carl Rustad became a military officer and company director, and married a sister of Jean Heiberg. Their daughter Elisabeth Rustad (1883–1966) married the later Lord Chamberlain Peter Fredrik Broch in 1905, and their daughter Benedicte Rustad (1886–1976) married ship-owner Thomas Fearnley in August 1911. He finished his secondary education at Nissen School in 1868, and took the cand.jur. in 1873. He was hired in the Ministry of the Interior in 1873, and was promoted to assistant secretary in 1886. He became a servant at the royal court from January 1899. He had been kammerjunker since 1873 and chamberlain since 1878, and was now appointed as court marshal (hoffmarskalk). In 1905 Norway had the personal union with Sweden dissolved, and Haakon VII of Norway was elected as king. Rustad became his first Lord Chamberlain at the request from Prime Minister Christian Michelsen, and served as such until 1925. He was decorated with the Grand Cross of the Royal Norwegian Order of St. Olav."

  "text" : "Francisco Antonio de Cabello y Mesa (1764 -1814) was a Spanish soldier and writer. He edited the first newspapers of the current nations of Peru, Argentina and Uruguay and founded El telégrafo Mercantil in Buenos Aires in 1801. He wrote under the pseudonym Jaime Bausate y Meza. Born in Extremadura, he joined the army without having completed law studies he had begun in Salamanca. He was sent to the Viceroyalty of Peru, where he was commissioned to defend the border of the province of Jauja, in the Amazon jungle, with the rank of colonel in 1790. Returning from that duty, he edited the first newspaper published in South America, called The Curious Journal, Scholar and Trade, in Lima. He was one of the founders of the Patriotic Society of Friends of the Country, a typical group in the Age of Enlightenment. He was also an attorney from the Audiencia of Lima. In 1798 he went off to Spain, but his travels came to an end in Buenos Aires, for health reasons, and because he had difficulty finding passage. In the capital of the Viceroyalty of Río de la Plata, he contacted local representatives of the Enlightenment, including Secretary of Consulate in Buenos Aires, Manuel Belgrano. He founded there the Society of Friends of the Country, but it was unsuccessful. This short-lived society had historical significance because, in partnership with the Consulate, the Society published the first newspaper in present-day Argentina, El Telegraph Commercial, Rural, Political, Economic and historiography, although it was not often known by its full name. The first issue appeared in April 1801, as a collaboration between Cabello, Manuel Belgrano and José de Lavardén. The last issue was published in October, 1802, after ten issues as a result of poor circulation and declining subscribers. Cabello belonged to the \"Lodge Independence\", active since 1805 in Buenos Aires, directed by Juan José Castelli, which intended to garner British support for separating the Spanish territories from their parent country. During the British invasion, many Creoles collaborated with the British. Many of them did so in secret, but Cabello agreed to hold a public position in the government of invading Governor William Carr Beresford. When the Reconquista occurred by the Creole and Spanish, Cabello was arrested and charged with treason against the King, and was taken prisoner at Montevideo. The following year, in 1807, Cabello was arrested in the eastern city during the second British invasion. He was released when that city fell into the hands of General Samuel Auchmuty, and his successor in command, John Whitelocke, put him in charge of the editorial of a newspaper in British propaganda, the Southern Star, a bilingual publication with which the British hoped to ingratiate themselves with the natives. After the Battle of Buenos Aires, which forced the British to withdraw also from Montevideo, the British invaders refused to take Cabello with them.He was arrested by order of Viceroy Liniers and sent, a prisoner to Spain, where he expected to be condemned to death.The French invasion of the peninsula saved his life for a few years. He was released, and joined the Liberal Party Spanish in Sevilla. He took refuge in Cadiz, protected by the English fleet, until the restoration of King Ferdinand VII of Spain. He could not escape more. He was shot in Seville in 1814."

Holles was a major in the Westminster militia and commanded a privateer called the Panther. He was recommended him for the navy by George Monck, 1st Duke of Albemarle. He lost an arm at the Four Days Fight in 1666 while commanding HMS Antelope. He was knighted subsequently. In 1667, Holles was elected Member of Parliament for Grimsby in the Cavalier Parliament. In March 1672, he and Sir Robert Holmes sailed from Portsmouth and attacked the Dutch Smyrna convoy in the English Channel on its return home. This foray had official sanction and led to the Third Dutch War. Holles was in command of HMS Cambridge at the Battle of Solebay on 28 May 1672 when he was killed at the age of 29. He was given a funeral in Westminster Abbey and was buried in St Edmund's chapel in an unmarked grave. Holles married Jane Crome (née Lewis)."

  "text" : "Francis John Nathaniel Curzon, 3rd Viscount Scarsdale (28 July 1924 – 2 August 2000), was a British peer. Curzon was the son of the Honourable Francis Nathaniel Curzon, third son of Alfred Nathaniel Holden Curzon, 4th Baron Scarsdale. He succeeded his cousin in the viscountcy in 1977. Lord Scarsdale, who died aged 76, fought a dozen years of battles against the National Trust over its alterations to his ancestral home, Kedleston Hall in Derbyshire, and another 10 years trying to persuade the trust to take the place off his hands. Scarsdale saw himself as \"the 30th Lord of Kedleston in an unbroken male line of descent\". His family stretches back 900 years, but his position was the result of the typical stipulation in the Scarsdale title - that it, and the estate, could go only to a male heir. The 2nd viscount gave up hope of a male heir after his first wife produced four daughters and he failed to father an heir with his second wife. As next in line, Francis Curzon, an old Etonian captain in the Scots Guards, and son of the third son of the 4th Baron Scarsdale, was invited by a cousin he hardly knew to see the estate for the first time in 1959. Kedleston Hall has been one of the glories of Britain since the young Robert Adam rebuilt it for the first Baron Curzon in the 1760s, around his collection of Tintorettos, Poussins and Chippendale furniture. As the centre of an estate of 5,700 acres, it included a 500-acre park and an 18-hole golf course. From 1970, Scarsdale took charge of his future inheritance as estate manager. He knew, even before death duties of £2.5m, that he could not keep up the property on the basis of income from the estate's 17 farms. \"The house is a gigantic headache,\" he moaned. Wanting to preserve it intact, he offered the pile to the nation, in lieu of death duties. The environment secretary Michael Heseltine was sympathetic, as were arts ministers Norman St John-Stevas and Lord Gowrie. Even Mrs Thatcher went to have a look. But while waiting for a decision, Scarsdale came into conflict with his son and heir Peter, to whom he had promised a tenth of the estate if sold. Peter wanted to wait for a £25m offer from overseas, which never materialised. It took until 1987, a full decade, before the National Trust was willing to take over Kedleston Hall and its estate, financed by an unprecedented £14m, mainly from the National Heritage Fund. Lord Scarsdale made what seemed a generous deal with the trust. He and his family could live rent-free in a 23-room wing, with an adjoining garden and two rent-free flats for his servants or other family members. He could play billiards and hold parties in the main block, and shoot pheasants on the estate when it was closed to the public. Meanwhile, the annual maintenance costs of £400,000 were to be met by members of the National Trust and 20,000 visitors. The irritation came from differing interpretations of the word \"consult\" in Scarsdale's agreement with the trust. He thought he could veto any changes; the trust insisted he would only be informed, as a courtesy. He wanted the current hall reserved as a \"family home\"; the trust wanted it restored to its 1760s glory. Scarsdale attacked the trust's \"arrogance\", \"vandalism\" and \"sacrilege\" for such things as removing a fountain or a favourite piece of furniture. Francis died on after a long illness. He left two sons and a daughter by his first wife, Solange, and two sons by his second wife, Helene, whom he married in 1958. His eldest son, Peter Ghislain Nathaniel Curzon, became the 4th viscount."

In 1839, Gehon was elected the delegate from Iowa Territory to the United States House of Representatives, but never took office. The United States Congress extended the term of William W. Chapman to bring the term of office in line with the rest of the United States House of Representatives. In 1843, Gehon was elected to the Iowa Territorial Council and in 1844, he was elected to the first Iowa Constitutional Convention. Gehon was offered command of a company of dragoons raised for the Mexican-American War, but declined because of ill health. He died in Dubuque, Iowa on April 2, 1849."

This was in the context of liberal reforms which stripped the indigenous population of access to their communal lands, which were appropriated by private landowners. Ama was a day laborer in Izalco. He married Josefa Shupan, who came from an influential Pipil family in Izalco. 1917 he became a member of the catholic brotherhood Cofradía del Corpus Christi. His father-in-law Patricio Shupan was mayordomo of the brotherhood, who died in 1917 after participating at a dinner with president Carlos Meléndez. After Shupan's death Feliciano Ama became head of the brotherhood, which consisted exclusively of Pipil. In the early morning of January 22, 1932 Feliciano Ama lead the Pipil peasants of Izalco into the uprising against the landlords. With several hundred supporters he marched to the capital of the department Sonsonate. There the mayor was killed by insurgents from Juayúa, but landlords accused Ama, who fled into the hills of Izalco. There he was found by soldiers from the garrison of Izalco under commander Cabrera, captured and hanged in the center of Izalco."

Concerning the poor, Viola has said that helping those who are in need is part of \"the Magna Carta of the Church of Jesus Christ as she continues the ministry of Jesus on earth (Luke 4:18–19). Scripture, both Old Testament and New Testament, make clear that this is very much on God's heart.\" Aside from being an author and speaker on Christian topics, Viola consults authors, bloggers, and writers in their craft.

  "text" : "Frans David Oerder (7 April 1867 Rotterdam - 15 July 1944 Pretoria) was a Dutch-born South African landscape, still-life and portrait painter, etcher and lithographer. Frans was the youngest of seven children born to a municipal employee, Johannes Carolus Oerder. His father felt that art as a career was foolish, but agreed to his training as a decorator. From 1880 to 1885, Oerder studied art at the Rotterdam Academy, winning the King William III Gold Medal and Bursary, later touring in Italy and studying in Brussels under Ernest Blanc-Garin (1843–1916) with the help of a small inheritance from his father. Following his brother, he emigrated to South Africa in 1890, and initially worked as house painter and decorator for the firm of De Wyn & Engelenburg. Pressed by a shortage of work he entered the employ of the Zuid-Afrikaansche Spoorweg Maatschappij and painted poles along the Delagoa Bay railway line. In the 1890s, Oerder was, along with Anton van Wouw and James Smith Moreland in Cape Town, one of only three artists in South Africa with recognised professional training. In 1894, he took up the position of art teacher at the Staatsmeisjesskool, which later became the Pretoria High School for Girls and at the same time rented a studio in Church Street East. He eked out a living by drawing newspaper cartoons and helping Anton van Wouw with commissions. A frequent visitor to the studio during this period was one of his art students, Pierneef. In 1896, Oerder went on a painting holiday to Zululand, and arranged an exhibition of his work in Cape Town. With the outbreak of the Anglo-Boer War in 1899, he was appointed official war artist by President Paul Kruger. His sketches and paintings from this bitter period are held at the War Museum in Bloemfontein, the Africana Museum in Johannesburg and the art collection of the University of Pretoria. In 1903, after the war, and no doubt still remembering his Zululand trip, Oerder travelled and painted along the East African coast, contracting malaria during the trip. He was elected a member of the South African Society of Artists in 1905, and with the tide finally turning in his favour,received several commissions to paint landscapes and portraits, such as that of General Louis Botha. He found conditions difficult in postwar South Africa and in 1908 returned to the Netherlands via Italy. At first he settled in Brabant, but later moved to Amsterdam where he married a fellow painter, Gerda Pitlo, in 1910. Her interest in flower painting influenced him and he started on still life compositions, especially flower studies. His painting Magnolias was sold to the New York Graphic Society, becoming one of the most popular images ever and reproductions of this still life achieved record sales for the Society, Oerder receiving no royalties whatever. Oerder hadn't forgotten his ties to South Africa, and occasionally carried out commissions such as designing covers for the weekly magazine, Die Brandwag, and arranging an exhibition in Johannesburg. He eventually returned to Pretoria with his wife in 1938. His work by now was widely acclaimed, and in a grand gesture the tower-room of the Pretoria City Hall was made available to him for use as a studio. Here he painted several important portraits, including that of Jan Smuts. He now had the time and inclination to travel and paint in the Cape Province, Natal and the Northern Transvaal. Complications following on a bout of pneumonia left him debilitated, and he died in Pretoria in 1944. Throughout his career he had divided his output fairly evenly between landscape, portrait and still-life, with the Dutch influence always apparent."

  "text" : "Felix Cole (1887 – 1969) was an American diplomat. His postings in the foreign service included ambassadorships to Ethiopia and Sri Lanka. Following the retirement of John K. Caldwell in 1945, Cole was selected as his replacement. Emperor Haile Selassie was concerned that Cole had spent a great deal of his career in colonial territories, and through the Ethiopian ambassador to the United States, Blatta Ephrem Tewelde Medhen, voiced his objection at least twice. On presenting the Emperor's objection for the last time, according to John Spencer, the acting Secretary of State Joseph C. Grew \"was visibly angered. Tossing his head, he declared that he found that objection ridiculous and that if we persisted, the United States would not be represented in Ethiopia.\" The Ethiopian fears proved to be accurate soon after Cole arrived in Ethiopia October 1945. At the Potsdam Conference, the United States, Great Britain, and Soviet Union had proclaimed their intent \"to seize German government property wherever it was found, even though on the territory of friendly states.\" Cole then took the initiative, over the protests of the Ethiopian government, of seizing the official archives of the German legation in Addis Ababa. Spencer observes, \"His arrogance confirmed in the minds of the Ethiopian officials the view that the minister still held to his colonialist outlook.\" He was assisted in this endeavor by the caretaker of the German legation, whom \"to rub salt in Ethiopia's wounds\" he proceeded to appoint an official of the legation with diplomatic privileges. The Ethiopian government immediately declared the former caretaker persona non grata, an act Ambassador Cole ignored. In 1947 the former caretaker was murdered in a legation car; in a footnote to his memoirs Spencer \"cannot dismiss the suspicion that this assassination had been planned with the approval and the complicity of the Imperial Guard\", although he admits the facts both then and later \"are extremely sketchy\". Cole's final misstep came when he wore what the Ethiopians felt was inappropriate dress, which Emperor Haile Selassie viewed as a deliberate and public insult. As Spencer explains, \"As elsewhere in Africa, great importance was attached to formal attire at ceremonies. At the dedication by His Majesty of a monument in the center of the city, a ceremony attended by all in the diplomatic corps, the American ministers appeared in a business suit, side by side with the other diplomats who were all attired in striped pants and top hats.\" Cole was subsequently recalled before the Ethiopian government could declare him persona non grata."

He appeared in several beach party films of the 1960s, including Pajama Party, Bikini Beach, which starred Frankie Avalon and Annette Funicello, Riot on Sunset Strip and Beach Blanket Bingo. His television credits as an actor also included appearances in The Flying Nun, The Odd Couple, Gomer Pyle, That Girl, Room 222 and Laverne & Shirley. Alesia later directed episodes of Captain Kangaroo, which earned him a Daytime Emmy nomination in 1979. He also joined the crew of Laverne & Shirley beginning in 1980 as both a screenwriter and television director.

She campaigned successfully to have some of her female trainees accepted into the all-male Navy, thereby originating the Women's Royal Australian Naval Service (WRANS). Some 12,000 servicemen passed through her signal instruction school in Sydney, acquiring skill in Morse code and visual signalling (flag semaphore and International Code of Signals). She set up her own electrical contracting business in 1918, and apprenticed herself to it, in order to meet the requirements of the Diploma in Electrical Engineering at Sydney Technical College and in 1922 she was the first Australian woman to take out an amateur radio operator's license. Through the 1920s and 1930s, her \"Wireless Shop\" in Sydney's Royal Arcade was renowned amongst Sydney radio experimenters and hobbyists. She founded The Wireless Weekly in 1922, established the Electrical Association for Women in 1934, and wrote the first \"all-electric cookbook\" in 1936. She also corresponded with Albert Einstein in the postwar years."

In his 1962 book High latitude, Davis described Fletcher as \"a most efficient and conscientious officer and seaman who at first sight might have been taken for the prototype of the perfect 'Bucko', that semi-legendary figure sometimes described as having 'a jaw like a sea boot'.\" Fletcher left the Aurora in 1913 to join a coastal shipping company, presumably in New Zealand, where he was discharged.

Despite his stuttering and partial blindness he became a star of the big screen including a wide range of activities as author and entrepreneur for TV, cinema, theatre, magazines and musical shows; between 2006 and 2008 he published the best-seller trilogy Tuttalpiù muoio (At Least I’ll die), E lasciamole cadere queste stelle (Let these stars fall) and Peggio che diventare famoso (Worse than becoming famous) in which he recalls his humble origins and transform youth troubles into a powerful and intense love for life, through a vividly ironic and phantasmagoric lens. His 2009 Shakespeare adaptation Il popolo non ha il pane, diamogli le brioche (People don’t have bread, let’s give them sweet rolls), written, directed and starring by him as Hamlet, was sold out for two years and legitimated his name as one of the most acclaimed and talented authors of Italian Theatre. His film career took off with roles in Ferzan Ozpetek’s multiple award winning Saturn in Opposition and Saverio Costanzo’s In Memory of Me, for which he was nominated for a best supporting actor award by the Italian Syndicate of Film Journalists. After taking the lead roles in Wilma Labate’s Miss F and Giuliano Montaldo’s The Demons of St. Petersberg with Isabella Rossellini, he won a Best Actor award for his leading role in Academy Award winner director Gabriele Salvatores‘s As God Commands. Since 2009 Timi’s films were in competition in major festivals: at Cannes with Vincere by Marco Bellocchio, where he played the young Benito Mussolini, and at the Venice International Film Festival with the debut of Giuseppe Capotondi, The Double Hour, winner of the Coppa Volpi. He played dramatic roles in Vallanzasca, Angel of Evil (2011), the period drama Rust (2011) alongside comedies like Asterix and Obelix: God Save Britannia (2012). The actor completed his English-language debut, acting alongside George Clooney in Anton Corbijn's action film The American, and dubbing Tom Hardy's voice in the Italian release of The Dark Knight Rises. Believer in the unity between theatre and philosophy as his Carmelo Bene inspirational figure did, he is considered “major author in Italian cultural system”"

Fred Lee was the second cricketer of this name to play for Somerset: he was not related to the earlier Fred Lee, and nor was he related to Frank Lee and Jack Lee, the London-born brothers who were his near-contemporaries in the Somerset side. Lee was a tail-end batsman and a bowler, though neither his batting nor his bowling style is recorded. He recorded his best bowling figures in his first match, with three wickets for 103 runs against Yorkshire in 1925, and his score of eight in Somerset's first innings was also the highest of his short career."

In his 1962 book High latitude, Davis wrote of Gillies' work during the expedition: \"We were most fortunate in the selection of F. J. Gillies as Chief Engineer of the Aurora. Quite apart from his high technical skill and efficiency as an engineer, he was the wise counsellor and kindly shipmate of everyone on board throughout the expedition.\" Gillies joined the Aurora again in 1916, and served as First Officer during the rescue of the Ross Sea component of the Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition, for which he was later awarded the Polar Medal. The Gillies Islands, in the Shackleton Ice Shelf in Antarctica, were named after him by AAE Commander Douglas Mawson."

From 1919 Petyrek taught at the Mozarteum.

  "text" : "Frank John Dezelan (December 29, 1929 – March 7, 2011), was an American umpire in Major League Baseball who worked in the National League for five seasons. He was born in Johnstown, Pennsylvania. Born to immigrants from Yugoslavia who settled in Johnstown, Dezelan served in the United States Navy during the Korean War. He played baseball during military service, and on the sandlots of Cambria County. He spent thirteen years umpiring in baseball before ending his career due a brain tumor. His umpiring career was launched in a dentist's chair, according to his family. While being treated by his dentist, Richard Goldberg, Frank discussed his love of baseball, and Goldberg suggested that he become an umpire. Dezelan decided to heed the advice and was accepted into the Al Somers Academy of Professional Umpiring in Daytona Beach, Florida. After graduating in 1958, Dezelan began his umpiring career in the Northern League that year and returned for the 1959 season. According to a story told by former and longtime major league umpire Bruce Froemming, Dezelan and his crew were scheduled to work a minor league doubleheader in which future Hall of Famer Earl Weaver was managing. Notorious for mixing it up with umpires, Weaver got into a pregame argument over some tree limbs that jutted into fair territory. Dezelan ejected the argumentative Weaver before the game even began. Dezelan moved up to the South Atlantic League in 1960 and 1961 and to the Pacific Coast League from 1962 to 1963. He then worked in the Southern League in 1964 and 1965 and in the International League from 1966 through 1968. In addition, he would be an umpire in the National League for the last weeks of the season from 1966 to 1968, then full-time from 1969 to 1970. When the National League umpires began wearing numbers in 1970, Dezelan was assigned number 6. During his career, Dezelan worked some Major League milestones involving some of its biggest star players. He was behind home plate when Willie Mays hit his 600th career home run in 1969. He was part of the umpiring crew at the 1970 All-Star Game that ended with Pete Rose colliding with catcher Ray Fosse at home plate, and also worked the inaugural game at Three Rivers Stadium during the 1970 season. In 1971 Dezelan had surgery to remove a brain tumor, which ended his career when he was 42. He survived six brain operations over the next four decades. According to his son Daryl, Dezelan loved to work games with pitchers Sandy Koufax and Bob Gibson, because they worked so efficiently, and with outfielder Roberto Clemente because he never argued over calls, but just held his head high and played the game. Additionally, he worked with many of the most notable players and coaches in Major League history, including Sparky Anderson, Carl Yastrzemski and Willie Stargell, amongst others. Irene Dezelan, his wife of 52 years, noted that her husband made it to the big leagues when there were more U.S. senators than major league umpires. The couple raised five children, three daughters and two sons, in the Pittsburgh area. Frank Dezelan died in Monroeville, Pennsylvania, at the age of 81. He is noted in the archives of The Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, NY."

In 1882, when some of Somerset's games were retrospectively accorded first-class status, he played half a dozen matches and in the first of them, against Hampshire at Southampton, he took four first-innings wickets for 35 runs in 28 four-ball overs, and these remained his best bowling figures. He did not play at all in 1883 but returned for a few games in 1884 and in the Hampshire fixture at Southampton he again did well, scoring an unbeaten 57 in the first innings, though Somerset lost the match heavily after conceding 645 in Hampshire's only innings."

In The Horn Book Magazine, Jan/Feb 1945, Howard Pease, in his essay \"Without Evasion\", says: \"Only at infrequent intervals do you find a story intimately related to this modern world, a story that takes up a modern problem and thinks it through without evasion. Of our thousands of books, I can find scarcely half a dozen that merit places on this almost vacant shelf in our libraries; and of our hundreds of authors, I can name only three who are doing anything to fill this void in children's reading. These three authors – may someone present each of them with a laurel wreath – are Doris Gates, John R. Tunis, and Florence Crannell Means.\" Many of Means's books dealt with the experiences of minorities in America, such as Japanese Americans in The Moved-Outers and African Americans in Shuttered Windows."

  "text" : "Fulvio Testi (August 1593 in Ferrara – 28 August 1646 in Modena) was an Italian diplomat and poet who is recognised as one of the main exponents of 17th-century Italian Baroque literature. He worked in the service of the d'Este dukes in Modena, for whom he held high office, such as the governorship of Garfagnana. His poems tackle civic themes in solemn tones, showing Testi's lasting anti-Spanish and, consequently, pro-Savoia political passions. Accused of treason for having tried to set up diplomatic relations with the French court, he was imprisoned and died in jail soon after. One later literary critic wrote: If he'd been born in a less barbarous age, and had had more time than he did to cultivate his talent, he would doubtless have been our Horace, and perhaps been hotter and more vehement and more sublime than the Latin man"

After the proclamation of the Brazilian Republic in 1889, Souto was elected City Councillor of Alegrete."

  "text" : "Professor Farzad Sharifian is a pioneer of Cultural Linguistics and holds the Chair in Cultural Linguistics at Monash University. He has developed a theoretical and an analytical framework of cultural cognition, cultural conceptualisations, and language, which draw on and expands the analytical tools and theoretical advancements in several disciplines and sub-disciplines, including cognitive psychology, anthropology, distributed cognition, and complexity science. The theoretical/analytical frameworks and their application in several areas of applied linguistics including intercultural communication, cross-cultural pragmatics, second language learning, and political discourse analysis are the subject of Sharifian’s monograph entitled Cultural Conceptualisations and Language (John Benjamins, 2011). This book has widely been recognised as laying \"solid theoretical and analytical grounds for what can be recognised as Cultural Linguistics\". (Alexandra Bagasheva, in the journal of Language and Cognition, Vol. 4:3 (2012), pp. 243-249). Professor Sharifian is the founding Editor-in-Chief of the International Journal of Language and Culture, and the Series Editor of Cultural Linguistics book series (Springer). He has published articles in many edited books and in more than 25 leading international journals. His awards and honours include the prestigious Humboldt Fellowship for Experienced Researchers, from the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation, Germany."

The survivors, including only 17 of their original escort of 1,500 men, were then sent back after Timur's death and were all rewarded on arrival.

The present government system of four Kablon under the Dalai and Panchen Lamas was then established.

For reporting the treasonable designs of Wu Sangui in 1688 he was condemned to death, but the sentence was commuted to banishment to Guangxi. Here he was when Wu revolted, and the latter at once sent to seize him. He tried to drown himself, but was rescued and sent to the revolted general of Guangxi, Sun Yanling, who was however won over by his admonitions, joined with the entreaties of his wife, and sent him to Nanning in order to get aid from Cochin-china. To save himself from suspicion, Fu accepted a general's commission from the rebels, and at the same time entered into a secret league with Shang Zhixin against them. In 1677 he opened communications with the Imperial generals in Hunan and Guangdong; and having enlisted many of the frontier tribes, fought his way to Shaozhou and so joined hands with them, to learn that he was appointed Governor of Guangxi. All his family had been sent as hostages to Wu Sangui, and were slain on his taking the Imperialist side; and this so enraged him that he laid down his Governorship and devoted himself entirely to the war. His efforts were hampered by Shang Kexi, who would not lend a gun nor a horse and would not move a man. Yet he was on the whole successful, even though working with raw levies, and in 1680 had got to the border of Guizhou. Then the stupidity of a subordinate, who without his knowledge marched a force after him as he went to an interview with an ex-rebel leader, excited the latter's suspicion, and he was seized and sent to Guiyang. Here the grandson and successor of Wu Sangui, Wu Shifan (吳世璠), after vain endeavors to shake his loyalty, put him to death. His remains, recovered on the recapture of Guiyang at the end of 1680, received a public funeral; and the Emperor published his secret memorials revealing the treasonable designs of Shang Zhixin, memorials which this time were acted upon without undue delay. Fu was canonised and included in the Temple of Patriots."

He presented a memorial asking that Buddhism might be abolished; and when Xiao Yu questioned him on the subject, he said, “You were not born in a hollow mulberry-tree; yet you respect a religion which does not recognize the tie between father and son!” He urged that at any rate priests and nuns should be compelled to marry and bring up families, and not escape from contributing their share to the revenue, adding that Xiao Yu by defending their doctrines showed himself no better than they were. At this time Xiao Yu held up his hands, and declared that hell was made for such men as Fu Yi. The result was that severe restrictions were placed for a short time upon teachers of Buddhism. Emperor Taizong of Tang once got hold of a Tartar priest who could “charm people into unconsciousness, and then charm them back to life again,” and spoke of his powers to Fu Yi. The latter said confidently, “He will not be able to charm me;” and when put to the test, the priest completely failed. He was the originator of epitaphs, and wrote his own, as follows: --Fu Yi loved the green hills and the white clouds. Alas! He died of drink."

  "text" : "Flying Hawk (Oglala Lakota: Čhetáŋ Kiŋyáŋ in Standard Lakota Orthography; a/k/a Moses Flying Hawk; March 1854 – December 24, 1931) was an Oglala Lakota warrior, historian, educator and philosopher. Flying Hawk's life chronicles the history of the Oglala Lakota people through the 19th and early 20th centuries, as he fought to deflect the worst effects of white rule; educate his people and preserve sacred Oglala Lakota land and heritage. Chief Flying Hawk was a combatant in Red Cloud's War and in nearly all of the fights with the U.S. Army during the Great Sioux War of 1876. He fought alongside his first cousin Crazy Horse and his brothers Kicking Bear and Black Fox II in the Battle of the Little Big Horn in 1876, and was present at the death of Crazy Horse in 1877 and the Wounded Knee Massacre of 1890. Chief Flying Hawk was one of the five warrior cousins who sacrificed blood and flesh for Crazy Horse at the Last Sun Dance of 1877. Chief Flying Hawk is notable in American history for his commentaries and classic accounts of the Battle of the Little Big Horn, Crazy Horse and the Wounded Knee Massacre, and of Native American warriors and statesmen from who fought to protect their families, defend the invasion of their lands and preserve their culture. Chief Flying Hawk was probably the longest standing Wild Wester, traveling for over 30 years throughout the United States and Europe from about 1898 to about 1930. Chief Flying Hawk was an educator and believed public education was essential to preserve Lakota culture. He frequently visited public schools for presentations. Chief Flying Hawk leaves a legacy of Native American philosophy and his winter count covers nearly 150 years of Lakota history."

  "text" : "Franz Podezin (born 1911) was an SS-Hauptscharführer and Gestapo chief in Rechnitz, Austria. On the night of March 24–25, 1945 allegedly on the direction of the \"Killer Countess\", Margaret of Batthyanyu daughter of Baron Heinrich Thyssen, Podezin engaged in the massacre of at least 180 Hungarian Jewish slave laborers in Rechnitz who were assigned to dig anti-tank ditches in anticipation of the approaching Red Army. The slave laborers were machine gunned to death allegedly as part of a perverse celebration of Nazi functionaries at Batthyanyu's Schloss Rechnitz . There has been controversy over the version of events as reported by British journalist David Litchfield. The fact that the killings occurred and Podezin took part is not disputed. The dispute stems from whether the killings were done to amuse the guests at the party and if party guests took part in the murders. Podezin, who was born Vienna, Austria, escaped justice and was last seen alive in South Africa in 1963."

  "text" : "Frank Gillmore (May 14, 1867, New York City, New York – March 29, 1943, New York City, New York) was an American playwright and a stage and early film actor. He was a founder and former President of Actor's Equity. He was born to the British actors Frank Parker Gillmore and his wife Emily (née Thorne: died March 5, 1907), sister of the actress Sarah Thorne and actors Thomas and George Thorne. At the time of his birth his parents were touring the United States, returning to Great Britain three weeks after their son's birth. Frank Gillmore was educated at the Chiswick Collegiate School in London and made his stage debut in London in 1879, then toured the British provinces for three years before returning to the London stage where he remained for a further five years. During this period he shared lodgings with George Arliss. Gillmore then alternated between appearances in Britain and America for a further five years. Aged 17 he appeared with Lillie Langtry. He married the American actress Laura Margaret MacGillivray whom he met when they both appeared in an American tour of Lady Windermere's Fan. With her he had two daughters, the actors Ruth Gillmore and Margalo Gillmore. Frank Gillmore appeared as a leading man with the companies of Minnie Fiske, Henrietta Crosman, Mary Mannering, Bertha Kalich and George Fawcett, among others. Gillmore's stage appearances included a single matinee performance of The Merchant of Venice on October 17, 1895 at the Gaiety Theatre in London, when he played Bassanio, The Ghost of Jerry Bundler at the Haymarket Theatre in London in September 1902, and A Japanese Nightingale which opened at Daly's Theater in New York in November 1903. Gillmore returned to America semi-permanently sometime in the late 1890s, and took his family with him. He and his family were long time summer residents of the Actor's Colony at Siasconset, and he was a former president of the Siasconset Casino. Gillmore became a founder of the Actors' Equity Association in 1913 after the Actors Society of America disbanded in 1912. He made two silent films, The Fairy and the Waif (1915) and The Lifted Veil (1917). From 1918 to 1929 he was the union's Executive Secretary and eventual President, a position he held from 1929 to 1937. He was also the international President of the Associated Actors and Artistes of America from 1938 to 1943 and a Freemason. As President of Actor's Equity Gillmore received The American Arbitration Association's annual gold Commercial Peace Medal in May 1931 \"for distinguished service in the establishment of commercial peace through arbitration\" Frank Gillmore died of cancer in New York City on March 29, 1943, aged 75."

His killing of about 500 sepoys of the 26th Native Infantry and civilians at Ajnala were gleefully described in his memoirs. After throwing 257 sepoy bodies into a well, he remarks: \"There is a well at Kanpur, but there is also one at Ajnala.\" This well is known as Shaheedan Wala Khu (martyrs' well) at Ajnala in district Amritsar. His acts were condemned by the Liberal MP and Quaker Charles Gilpin in the British parliament on 14 March 1859: \"as an Englishman he felt himself called upon to blush for the shame which had been brought upon the character of his country.\" Nevertheless Cooper was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath in the 1860 Birthday Honours while serving in the Bengal Civil Service."

Widder's administrative talents and dedication to hard work allowed him to overshadow Thomas Mercer Jones and take the lead in the Canada Company.

Widder's wife, Elizabeth, entertained in style providing upper-class residents of York with refined entertainments redolent of British aristocratic and middle-class life."

She represented Ethiopia at the IAAF World Half Marathon Championships and has won marathons in Thessaloniki and Vienna. She lives in Germany and trains with Irina Mikitenko. Since 2012, she competes for the German club MTV Braunschweig. Among her first elite level appearances was the Great Ethiopian Run in November 2008, where she came fourth behind Teyba Erkesso over the 10 km distance. She made her professional marathon debut at the Alexander the Great Marathon in April 2009 and she won on her first attempt, taking the women's title in a time of 2:36:54 hours. The Ljubljana Marathon in October was her second outing over the distance and she was fourth, but improved her best time by a minute and a half. She represented Oromia Police at the Sululta Cross Country at the start of 2010 and came fourth. She significantly improved her marathon best at that year's Rome City Marathon, taking fifth in a time of 2:28:54 hours, and won the Paderborner Osterlauf 10K soon afterwards. She was selected to represent Ethiopia at the 2010 IAAF World Half Marathon Championships in Nanning in October and she came seventh, setting a personal best of 1:09:38 hours for the distance. Her last major race of the year came at the Turin Marathon and she again improved: it became a two-woman race between Tola and Priscah Jeptoo and although it was her Kenyan rival who claimed victory, Tola ran a best of 2:28:22 hours as the runner-up. Her 2011 season began with a second-place finish at the Berlin Half Marathon. This was her preparation for the Vienna City Marathon and in that race she defeated débutantes Peninah Arusei and Ana Dulce Felix to win with a fourth consecutive personal best of 2:26:21 hours. This streak came to an end at October's Frankfurt Marathon as her time of 2:27:18 hours brought her seventh place. She defended her Vienna Marathon title in 2012 and came close to her best with a run of 2:26:39 hours. A fifth place at the 2012 Berlin Marathon saw her improve that time to 2:25:14 hours."

  "text" : "Fiske Goodeve Fiske-Harrison (2 September 1793 – 1872) of Copford Hall, Lord of the Manor of Copford was High Sheriff of Essex. He was born Fyske Goodeve Harrison on 2 September 1793 at Copford Hall, Essex, to John Haynes Harrison. John Haynes Harrison had inherited the manor from his first cousin, Hezekiah Haynes, a Major General in the army of Oliver Cromwell. Hezekiah Haynes had inherited it from his father, John Haynes, who had purchased it from the Mountjoy family. However, John Haynes lived mainly in the Americas where he was the first Governor of the Massachusetts Bay Colony and later Connecticut. John Haynes Harrison married Sarah Thomas Fiske, only child and heiress of Reverend John Fiske of Thorpe Morieux, Suffolk. The Fiske Family Papers, a history of the family, states that she was heiress to £18,000 on her marriage in 1789. Rev. John Fiske was a direct descendant, via the Gosnold family of Otley Hall in Suffolk, of Margaret Plantagenet, Countess of Salisbury, daughter of Prince George Plantagenet, Duke of Clarence, the younger brother and heir to King Edward IV until he was executed in 1478 and the crown went to his younger brother, the Duke of Gloucester, later King Richard III. The Countess of Salisbury was a peeress in her own right, the fifth richest noble in all England, and the last surviving member of the House of Plantagenet following the Wars of the Roses. Her younger brother, Edward Plantagenet, 17th Earl of Warwick, was the last legitimate male heir to the dynasty until he was executed in 1499 (their maternal grandfather had been Richard Neville, 16th Earl of Warwick, known as 'Warwick the Kingmaker'.) The Countess herself was executed in 1541 as a political and religious threat by her cousin King Henry VIII, and was later beatified by Pope Leo XIII as a martyr for the Catholic Church. According to Burke's Peerage, Rev. John Fiske, M.A. (Cantab.), as well as descending from the Plantagenets via the Gosnolds(and thus from William the Conqueror who arrived in England in 1066), the Fiske family themselves first arrived with the Viking surname Fiskr at the Battle of Maldon in 991 A.D. Fiske-Harrison was educated at Charterhouse School, 1806-1810, and St John's College, Cambridge. He served in the East Essex Regular Militia, rising to the rank of Major (gazetted in 1828). He changed his surname to Fiske-Harrison on inheriting his mother's estates after her death, and became Lord of the Manor of Copford on his father's death in 1839. He married Jane, daughter of James Sparrow, in 1826. He served as a magistrate, rising to Justice of the Peace, and as High Sheriff of Essex in 1827. He died in 1872. His descendants include A. B. C. Harrison, the former MP for Maldon in Essex, and Lord of the Manor of Copford and owner of Copford Hall, and Clive Fiske Harrison, chairman of the investment bankers Fiske & Co plc."

  "text" : "Maurice Étienne Legrand, who published under the pseudonym Franc-Nohain (25 October 1872 – 18 October 1934), was a French librettist and poet. He is best known for his libretti for Maurice Ravel's opera L'heure espagnole and for numerous operettas by Claude Terrasse. Maurice Étienne Legrand was born in 1872 in Corbigny; his father was an overseer-agent. He attended the Lycée Janson de Sailly. In the late 1880s he contributed poems to the literary magazine Potache-Revue (potache being slang for 'schoolkid'), along with André Gide, Léon Blum, Pierre Louÿs, Maurice Quillot and others. Later, he published in the journal Le Chat noir. He also founded Le Canard sauvage and became the editor of L'Écho de Paris. He also became a lawyer and deputy prefect. His literary pseudonym Franc-Nohain was derived from the Nohain River, where he had spent many happy hours as a child. With Alfred Jarry and Claude Terrasse he co-founded the Théatre des Pantins, which in 1898 was the site of marionette performances of Jarry's Ubu Roi. He is best remembered now as the librettist for some operettas by Terrasse, and for the opera L'heure espagnole by Maurice Ravel, adapted from his own comedy. He had two sons: the actor Claude Dauphin, and the songwriter and television producer/director Jean Nohain (aka Jaboune). He died in Paris in October 1934, aged 61."

In 1360 he obtained by Louis I of Hungary the cities of Feltre and Belluno with their territories, as well as Valsugana, which controlled the trades to Trentino. In 1372-1373 he fought a fruitless war against his powerful neighbor, the Republic of Venice. In 1375-1381 he sided with the Genoa in the War of Chioggia, after which he obtained by Leopold III of Austria the city of Treviso. In 1385, he allied with the Visconti of Milan against the Scaliger of Verona. In 1387 the Paduan troops, led by John Hawkwood and his son Francesco Novello, defeated the Scaliger troops in the Battle of Castagnaro. The following year, however, Venice and Milan formed a colation against Francesco, who was forced to abdicate in favour of his son and to go into exile in Lombardy. Later Gian Galeazzo Visconti transferred him first to Como, and then to the Forni jail of Monza, where he died in 1393. Francesco was a patron of the arts. He favored the University of Padua, where he called Ubaldo degli Ubaldi. He was also a friend of Francesco Petrarca, whom he donated an estate in Arquà. He married Fina Buzzaccarini and their daughter Cecilia of Carrara (d. 1435) married Wenceslaus I, Duke of Saxe-Wittenberg."

His early works were miniatures. His later works in chalk were exhibited at the Royal Academy between 1820 and 1841. At one stage he was inclined to producing historical images, but the lukewarm reception given his commissioned 1820 painting, 'The Battle of Hastings,' discouraged him from pursuing this genre. Paget, who was Wellington’s cavalry commander at the Battle of Waterloo, regularly gave painting commissions to Wilkin. The painting shown here had until quite recently been catalogued as a \"portrait of an unknown military commander\". The Order of the Garter star, the Waterloo Medal and the Hussars uniform, clearly identify this as a portrait of Paget."

  "text" : "Franz Hermann Johann Maria Freiherr von Bodmann, sometimes written as Bodman (born 23 March 1908 in Zwiefaltendorf – died 25 May 1945 in Altenmarkt im Pongau) was a German SS-Obersturmführer who served as a camp physician in several Nazi concentration camps. Von Bodmann joined the Nazi Party in May 1932 (membership number 1,098,482) and the SS itself in 1934 (member number 267,787). From October 1939 to June 1940 and from July 1941 to January 1942 he served with the 79th SS-Standarte in Ulm in the Second Bataillon as a physician. It was 1941 that he was promoted to the rank of Obersturmführer. Von Bodmann was appointed camp physician at Auschwitz concentration camp in February 1942 and the following year held a similar position at Majdanek concentration camp. He subsequently filled the same role at Natzweiler-Struthof concentration camp and from September 1943 at Vaivara concentration camp. At some point he also worked at Neuengamme concentration camp although the exact dates are unknown. Eyewitnesses claimed that at Auschwitz von Bodmann killed inmates personally by injecting Phenol into their veins and also stated that he carried out similar procedures at other camps. Von Bodmann's departure from Auschwitz, where he had no superiors and as such acted largely as he pleased, was hastened when he contracted typhus not long after arriving. He left the camps in September 1944 when he was sent to work for SS-Wirtschafts-Verwaltungshauptamt and then to the Hauptamt Volksdeutsche Mittelstelle. His final assignment was as troop physician to the 5th SS Panzer Division Wiking. He was taken as a prisoner of war and held in a military hospital where he killed himself just after the end of the Second World War."

  "text" : "Fred Lowery (2 November 1909 – 11 December 1984) was a blind professional whistler who recorded a No. 9 Billboard chart hit version of \"The High and the Mighty\" with conductor and arranger LeRoy Holmes. Lowery whistled with Horace Heidt and Vincent Lopez in the 1930s and 40s. His 'Silent Night' and 'William Tell Overture' demonstrate the difference between everyday whistling and puccalo. Lowery was born in Palestine in Anderson County in east Texas and lost his eyesight at the age of two after being stricken with scarlet fever. With an artificial right eye and limited vision in the left, Fred Lowery was legally blind - not totally blind. From the age of eight he was educated at the Texas School for the Blind and Visually Impaired. In 1929, when he was attending school, he met a bird imitator. \"He encouraged me,\" he recalled, \"and I began to discover there was more to whistling than bird calls.\" After a series of minor successes, including a radio show on WFAA in Dallas, and a 4 1/2 year engagement with the Vincent Lopez orchestra in New York, he was heard by Horace Heidt. Heidt gave Lowery his chance for national recognition as a featured part of his show. In 1945, Lowery struck out on his own. His 1939 version of the song Indian Love Call sold over 2 million copies. During his career, he performed at Carnegie Hall and at the White House."

  "text" : "Filocalo Navigajoso (died 1214) was a Venetian (or possibly of mixed Greek and Venetian descent) nobleman and first Latin ruler of the island of Lemnos (known as Stalimene in Italian) in Greece. Following the Fourth Crusade (1203–1204), most of the Aegean islands were apportioned to the Republic of Venice in the partition of the Byzantine Empire. Various Venetian nobles settled there and claimed the rule of these islands as fief-holders and vassals of the Latin Emperor at Constantinople. Filocalo received the rule of Lemnos and the title, borrowed from Byzantine court titelature, of megadux of the Latin Empire. He ruled the island from the fortress of Kastro or Palaiokastro (modern Myrina) until his death in 1214. Then the island was divided among his heirs. His son, Leonardo Navigajoso, received rule of one half of the island with Kastro, and his two daughters received one quarter each, with the castles of Moudros and Kotsinos. The family's rule over the island lasted until 1278."

He travelled to Prague, Breslau and Dresden (1825–27), North Sea (1832), Iceland (1834), the Mediterranean (1843) and the Faroe Islands (1844). On seeing one of Christoffer Wilhelm Eckersberg's marine paintings in Dresden, Kloss decided to go to Copenhagen and become one of his students at the Danish Academy. Over the years, the two became great friends not only in art but also as members of the Free Masons. Kloss became fully integrated into Danish cultural life. After becoming a member of the Academy in 1840, he received a professorship in 1853 and was treasurer from 1867."

He planned to publish these without any accompanying text, but then added text from his own, and colleagues' journals to produce his first book in 1848. In 1850, he left England for California via Panama with a manservant and three hunting dogs. This provided the material for another book, published in New York in 1855, \"a sportsman-tourist's chronicle of California in the early 1850s: hunting, horse races, bear and bull fights, and an Englishman's bemused comments on social life in San Francisco, Stockton, and the gold fields\". There is also a long and vivid description of the San Francisco Fire of 1851. He had returned to England in 1853, married, and prepared to return with his new bride to California that same year. However, he had contracted yellow fever onboard ship, which forced him to cut the trip short and return to England. He died there shortly before his book was published, under the title Mountains and Molehills, or Memoirs of a Burnt Journal."

  "text" : "Frank Sullivan (September 22, 1892 - February 19, 1976) was an American humorist, best remembered for creating the character Mr. Arbuthnot the Cliche Expert. Sullivan was born in Saratoga Springs, New York in 1892 and graduated from Cornell University in 1914. He worked for The Saratogian newspaper until he was drafted in 1917. Upon his discharge Sullivan moved to New York City and worked for several papers as a reporter and feature writer. Sullivan wrote his first article for The New Yorker in 1926, the year after it was founded. His most celebrated character, Mr. Arbuthnot, created in 1934, made his debut in the issue of August 31, 1935 in \"The Cliche Expert Takes the Stand\". In one story Mr. Arbuthnot was asked what he did for exercise, and he replied, \"I keep the wolf from the door, let the cat out of the bag, take the bull by the horns, count my chickens before they are hatched, and see that the horse isn't put behind the cart or stolen before I lock the barn door\". The last Mr. Arbuthnot story, \"The Cliche Expert Testifies On the Campaign\", appeared in The New Yorker on September 13, 1952. Sullivan never married. He returned to Saratoga Springs in the 1960s and lived there until his death in 1976. Sullivan was a peripheral member of the famous Algonquin Round Table. He is credited with the line, \"This is either a forgery or a damned clever original!\"."

  "text" : "Frank Ellis is a former lecturer in Russian and Slavonic Studies at the University of Leeds, who was suspended for alleged racism. Before entering academia, Ellis served in the Parachute Regiment and the Special Air Service (SAS). He served with the latter in Oman. In 2000, Dr Ellis came in for criticism after making plans to attend a conference hosted by American Renaissance, where he would deliver a speech attacking the findings of the Stephen Lawrence inquiry. In February/March 2006, a paper called Leeds Student published an interview by Matt Kennard, a Leeds Student journalist, with Dr. Ellis, where he expressed his support for the theory developed by Richard Herrnstein and Charles Murray that there are racial differences in average intelligence. Dr Ellis's comments were widely condemned, particularly in the light of his endorsement of the British National Party. A campaign was launched by Hanif Leylabi, President of the Unite Against Fascism organisation, which called upon the university to sack Ellis. The story received coverage in The Observer, The Daily Telegraph, The Independent, Times Higher Education and various other national newspapers and radio stations as well as national and local television services. A statement was released by Leeds University Union calling for his dismissal. Leeds University condemned Ellis' views as \"abhorrent\". Ellis was subsequently suspended by the Vice-Chancellor, Michael Arthur, pending disciplinary proceedings. The University issued a media release stating that it was investigating an alleged breach of its diversity policy. It also said Ellis's views were wholly at odds with the University's values, he had jeopardised the university's obligations under the Race Relations (Amendment) Act 2000, and that he had not apologised for his remarks. Dr. Ellis took early retirement in June 2006, pre-empting the outcome of the disciplinary action. Ellis addressed the annual meeting of the Traditional Britain Group in 2012  on the subject of \"Liberal Totalitarianism\"."

  "text" : "Francesco Mallardo (Giugliano, April 1, 1951), also known as \"Ciccio è Calantonio\", is an Italian criminal and a member of the Neapolitan Camorra. He headed the Mallardo clan operating from the town of Giugliano in Campania, north of the city of Naples. He was added to the list of thirty most dangerous fugitives in Italy. Francesco and his younger brother Giuseppe Mallardo succeeded their father Domenico Mallardo, who was killed by the Maisto clan on June 24, 1976. The murder led to a vendetta against that was concluded 11 years later in April 1987, with the killing of Antonio Maisto and two others. The triple killing wiped out the Maisto clan crime scene in Giugliano, now dominated by the Mallardos. The attack also marked the final break of relations between the Mallardos and the Nuvoletta clan from Marano. To complete the triple murder the Mallardo clan allied themselves with the Casalesi clan of Francesco Schiavone and Francesco Bidognetti who demanded a farewell to the historic alliance between Giugliano and Marano, who had been allied in the Nuova Famiglia that aimed to put an end to the excessive power of Raffaele Cutolo's Nuova Camorra Organizzata (NCO) in the late 1970s and 1980s. The subsequent rise of Mallardo in both power and prominence is linked to the Licciardi and Contini clans. The three clans together formed a coalition called the Secondigliano Alliance, in order to gain a stranglehold in the drug trafficking and extortion rackets in Naples. On April 14, 2000, he was arrested in a country house between Qualiano and Giugliano while attending a meeting of the so-called Secondigliano Alliance. Among the 13 people arrested were Patrizio Bosti and Feliciano Mallardo. They tried to escape but were blocked by the police. The boss has a heart condition and suffered a heart attack in the maximum security prison in Parma. He escaped from custody from two hospitals, one in his hometown Giugliano, and from a clinic in Pinerolo, near Turin. He was arrested again on August 29, 2003. The police, who had been on his trail, discovered the car of Mallardo on the A30 near Nola and set up a road block. Mallardo, who returned from a vacation with his family, pretended to stop but then suddenly accelerated, slightly injuring two policemen. Police then fired a few shots and hit a car tire. After a few hundred meters the car came to a standstill."

Although none of his films saw a theatrical release, they were highly influential within the Iranian New Wave movement. He also served as the director of Iran Zamin from 1966 to 1975. Rahnema studied film in Paris, France. He began work on Siavash dar Takht-e Jamshid with funding from a number of acquaintances. Shot in studio and on location in the ruins of Persepolis, the film is based on Ferdowsi's poetic epic Shahnameh. It tells the story of Crown Prince Siâvash who leaves his homeland in order to avoid dishonoring his father Shah Kay Kāvus. He marries the daughter of the local king Afrasiab, but is betrayed and murdered. The film is notable for its then-uncommon temporal experimentation with footage of tourists trekking through the ruins of Persepolis interspersed with the older setting."

  "text" : "Finlay Hart (1901–27 December 1989) was a Scottish communist politician. Born in Clydebank, Hart attended Clydebank High School. He became politically active when he joined the Workers International Industrial Union in 1915 while working at the William Beardmore and Company shipyard, in Dalmuir. Part of the Red Clydeside movement, in 1917, he joined the Socialist Labour Party, and he was part of the majority from that party who founded the Communist Party of Great Britain (CPGB). In 1923, he emigrated to Edmonton in Canada in an attempt to find work, joining the Communist Party of Canada, but he returned to Clydebank in Scotland by 1926, where he worked as a plumber. In 1934, Hart was a leading figure in a Glasgow to London hunger march. The following year, he was elected as the first communist councillor in Clydebank, although he resigned in 1937 to move to London and become National Industrial Organiser for the CPGB. He also held various District Secretary posts for the party: Scotland in 1935, the North Midlands from 1939 to 1940, and South Yorkshire from 1940 to 1942. Hart was a delegate to the Seventh Congress of the Communist International in Moscow. Hart stood for parliament on three occasions, West Dunbartonshire in 1950, and Glasgow Springburn in 1955 and 1959, but was never elected. During the 1950s, Hart served as Chairman of the Scottish Committee of the CPGB. Hart was subsequently re-elected to Clydebank Town Council, and also to Dunbartonshire County Council. He retired from his party posts in 1963, but later became Provost of Clydebank and participated in the Upper Clyde Shipbuilders work-in."

He was a co-author of the California retail sales tax and was twice president of the National Association of Tax Administrators. Stewart was appoointed in 1917 as superintendent of the California State Belt Railroad, which operated on the San Francisco waterfront. He was elected four times as a Republican to the Board of Equalization — in 1926 (unopposed), 1930 (72.8 percent win against Fred E. Butler, Democrat), 1934 (95.3 percent win against Pete Garcia, Communist), and 1938 (98.5 percent win against Leon M. Donihue, write-in). In 1933 he was director of the State Tax Research Bureau. In 1936, law-enforcement agencies began to investigate reported corruption in the Board of Equalization. The Los Angeles Times reported: Startling charges of graft and corruption in the investigation of California's liquor control administration, which involved prominent political figures of the north and south, held the attention of the state last week. Starting from a single complaint of a $500 pay-off to settle a law violation, the scandale became a snowball rolling downhill with charges of \"shakedowns\" and \"favoritism\" being hurled on all sides. . . . Among the first to be subpoenaed were former City Attorney Erwin P. Werner and his wife, Mrs. Helen M. Werner . . . . Discovery of two dictograph microphones in the Werner offices and the pilfering of their office were sensational developments in the case. In Oakland the Alameda county grand jury subpoenaed Fred Stewart . . . for questioning.He told investigators he had never been to the Werner ranch near Glendora, as reported, \"and any statement to that effect is an unmitigated lie.\" The investigation of the relationship between the wine industry and the government continued over the years, and in November 1939 Stewart, fellow board member William G. Bonelli and seven other people were indicted in by a Los Angeles grand jury for conspiring to obtain $15,000 from California wine makers. The charges against Stewart were later dismissed. Stewart died at his home in Oakland on April 17, 1942, at the age of 61. He was survived by his wife and five children."

In April 1659, Goodricke was elected Member of Parliament for Aldborough in the Third Protectorate Parliament. In 1660, he was elected MP for Aldborough in the Convention Parliament. He was re-elected MP for Aldborough in 1661 for the Cavalier Parliament and sat until his death in 1673. Goodricke became King's Counsel and a reader at Lincoln's Inn. The custom had been established that the reader should provide a feasts for the Inn, a factor used to explain a decline in the number of barristers prepared to become readers. Goodricke's feast in 1673 was said to be particularly sumptuous."

She spent a summer with Herbert Adams and his wife, Adeline, in the Cornish, New Hampshire art colony in the summer of 1894 and visited repeated times afterwards describing the colony in her unpublished \"Reminiscences\" held in Special Collections at Dartmouth College. It was in Cornish that she met sculptor Augustus Saint Gaudens who persuaded her to join him as his full-time assistant in 1900 in his studio. She worked with him until his death in 1907. After Saint Gaudens' death, Grimes stayed on at his studio to finish several of his commissions including the eight Caryatids which she modeled from his sketch models created for a porch at the Albright-Knox Art Gallery in Buffalo, New York. She later moved to New York and took a studio in Macdougal Alley in Greenwich Village. Grimes worked in bronze and marble. Grimes was a member of the National Sculpture Society, whose 1929 exhibition catalog states that her work included \"many bas-relief portraits, and busts, especially of children.\"  She was elected into the National Academy of Design as an Associate member in 1931, and a full Academician in 1945. She was also a member of National Association of Women Artists and the American Federation of Arts."

Filipp joined the Russian army as a hussar officer in 1766 and took part in the wars against the Ottoman Empire. He retired as a major-general in 1801, but temporarily returned to a military service to lead a volunteer militia from the Poltava Governorate during the war with Napoleonic France in the years 1812-1814."

  "text" : "Felipe Salvador (born on 26 May 1870 at Baliuag, Bulacan – died on 15 April 1912), also known as Apo Ipe or Ápûng Ipê Salvador, was a Filipino revolutionary who founded the Santa Iglesia (Holy Church), a messianic society also known as the Colorum which had the aim of defeating and overthrowing the colonial government of the United States in the Philippines. Salvador joined the Katipunan in 1896 upon the arrival of the Katipuneros from Balintawak in Baliuag, Bulacan. He founded the Santa Iglesia in 1900 after fleeing to the mountains when Gen. Emilio Aguinaldo was captured by American troops. Salvador and his church gained a significant number of followers in the regions of Bulacan, Pampanga, Pangasinan, Tarlac and Nueva Ecija. He was captured by American forces in 1910. He was tried and sentenced to death, being hanged in 1912, two years after his capture. Felipe Salvador and the Santa Iglesia movement are often depicted as part of Filipino history when numerous resistance and millenarian movements broke out across the archipelago, during a period spanning the Filipino struggle for independence culminating in the Philippine Revolution of 1896 against Spanish rule, to the Philippine-American War of 1989-1902 and its aftermath."

He edited and translated a Swedish-language Flora entitled Norsk fargeflora, which was published in five editions before Wischmann's death in 2011. He also translated the German language encyclopedia Grosse Bilderlexikon der Pflanzen, which was published under the title Tanums store blomsterbok og botaniske billedleksikon by the publishing house Tanum in 1970. In 1972, Wischmann wrote the book Verneverdige myrer i Oslo, Asker og Bærum together with Asbjørn Moen, on the conservation of swamps in the Greater Oslo Region. In 1986, he published a book together with Hedvig Wright Østern and Hermod Karlsen. It was titled Ville planter i Norge (\"Wild Plants in Norway\"), and was reprinted in 1993. Although he preferred copyediting over writing, Wischmann wrote more than 60 articles for botanical journals in Scandinavia. He was also an honorary member of the Norwegian Botanical Society and editorial staff member of its journal Blyttia. Wischmann wrote more than 45,000 herbarium sheets and 21,000 checklists, which record more than half a million plant discoveries. On 7 November 2003, he was decorated as a Knight, First Class of the Order of St. Olav for his work within Norwegian botanics. He died on 8 May 2011, aged 92. He was buried at Vestre gravlund on 16 May."

  "text" : "Ferdinand-Eugène-Jean-Baptiste Brunot (6 November 1860 – 7 January 1938) was a French linguist and philologist, editor of the ground-breaking Histoire de la langue française des origines à 1900 (\"History of the French Language from its Origins to 1900\"). Brunot was born in Saint-Dié-des-Vosges. He found his first faculty position and published his first book from the Faculté des lettres de Lyon, now the Lumière University Lyon 2. In October 1891 he became a lecturer at the Sorbonne at the age of 31. Here he began his long collaboration with fellow linguist Louis Petit de Julleville and produced the first volume of his monumental History, dealing with medieval French. It would eventually stretch to nine volumes published in his lifetime, and 13 volumes altogether. He also published a standard French grammar, and several papers advocating simplified French spelling. Brunot served as mayor of the 14th arrondissement of Paris in the difficult war years of 1914 through 1919, and served as dean of the University of Paris from 1919 through 1928 while engineering its significant expansion. He was appointed to the Académie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres in 1925, later serving as its president, and was awarded the Grand Croix of the Legion of Honor in 1933. He died in Paris. One of the squares in Paris and one of its fountains, both in his home arrondissement, bear his name."

  "text" : "Sir Francis Gamull, 1st Baronet (1606–1654) was an English politician who sat in the House of Commons from 1640 to 1644. He supported the Royalist side in the English Civil War and was active in the defence of Chester. Gamull was the son of Thomas Gamull. The family was of Buerton, Chester  He entered Inner Temple in November 1622. In 1634 he became mayor of Chester. He was elected Member of Parliament for City of Chester for the Long Parliament in November 1640. During the Civil War, Gamull was very active in the defence of Chester. In June 1643 he established a town guard, of which he was colonel, and enlisted all able-bodied men between 16 and 60. After the governor, Sir Nicholas Byron, was captured in March 1644, King Charles proposed Gamull in his place, but Gamull was rejected because he was unpopular with the citizens and opposed by other royalist leaders. Gamull was disabled from sitting in parliament on 22 January 1644, but was created in the baronet of Chester in April 1644. He was nominated as mayor in 1644 but was rejected. By April 1645 there were signs of popular antagonism towards Gamull and his Welsh soldiers, as conditions under the siege became increasingly difficult. Gamull entertained King Charles at town house in Chester and was with him on the Phoenix Tower when they watched the defeat of the Royalist army at the Battle of Rowton Heath. After the siege was ended Gamull and other Royalists were dismissed from the town's administration in October 1646, and he was fined £940.Gamull died at the age of 48 after an abortive uprising for the future Charles II. His son-in-law stated that he was executed at Exeter. The Parish Register of St. Mary-on-the-Hill in Chester states that he was buried there on 27 November 1654. Gamull married, as his first wife, Christian Grosvenor daughter of Sir Richard Grosvenor, 1st Baronet in 1621. They had two daughters, and the baronetcy became extinct on his death."

During 1874 Breitfuss attended meetings of the London Philatelic Society, later to become the Royal Philatelic Society London, and became a corresponding member in 1875 as he was not able to attend the meetings of the Society after he left the United Kingdom. Stanley Gibbons Monthly Journal reported that Breitfuss started to collect stamps as a schoolboy in about 1865. He moved to London in December 1873 and in 1874 he met Dr. Charles Viner who introduced him to the London Philatelic Society. In 1875 he moved to Odessa and in 1877 he returned home to St. Petersburg. He continued to buy numerous stamp collections along the way including those of Prince Galitzin-Ostermann, for which he paid £1500 in 1887, and in 1898 the collection of his friend Mr. Theodor Notthafft, director of the St. Petersburg International Bank, the Russo-Chinese Bank and of the Russian-Corean Bank. Breitfuss continued to collect widely throughout his life but was a particular expert on the stamps of the Zemstvo posts, Russia and Finland generally and South America. He died on 7 September 1911 at Karlsbad."
