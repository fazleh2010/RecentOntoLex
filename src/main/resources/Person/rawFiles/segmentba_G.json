  "text" : "Gu Changsheng (simplified Chinese: 顾长声; traditional Chinese: 顧長聲; pinyin: Gù Chángshēng, born July 19, 1919 in Wuxi, Jiangsu, China) is a Chinese scholar of the history of Christianity in China. Gu grew up in a Chinese Christian family. His parents worked for American missionaries of the Adventist Church. He was educated at a number of private schools run by the Adventist missionaries in mainland China and Hong Kong. During World War II, he served as an English-Chinese interpreter for the Nationalist Army. After the Communist Part took power in China, the government launched an accusation campaign against the foreign missionaries in the early 1950s. Gu took part in this campaign and accused the foreign missionaries of doing evils in China. Later in the 1950s He attended Peking University. However, he suffered in the hands of the Red Guards during the Cultural Revolution. After then he devoted his time, energy and expertise to the history of Christianity in China. Gu was a history professor at East China Normal University in Shanghai. His most influential work is Missionaries and pre-1949 China (《传教士与近代中国》), written in Chinese, which went through four editions (1981, 1991, 2004, 2013). With the book's publication Gu \"took the lead\" on research into Chinese Protestantism in the 1980s. Gu gave a negative description of the missionaries in this book, and most of the missionaries were bad in his evaluation. Gu thought missionaries did good things, like famine relief, out of bad motives. He accused William Alexander Parsons Martin of being a robber during the boxer rebellion, and Hudson Taylor of collecting intelligence for the British imperialists. He also criticized the missionaries for their anti-communism remarks in this book. In the mid-1980s Gu was a visiting scholar in America for a couple of years, and he returned to the United States again in 1989 upon the invitation of the United States Congress to attend the 1989 National Prayer Breakfast. Soon after he arrived in America, he married (his 2nd marriage) an American citizen. Gu has lived in Massachusetts since the late 1980s. His memoir, entitled Awaken: Memoirs of a Chinese Historian, was published by AuthorHouse in 2009. The work was his first book written in English. In this book Gu admitted that the majority of the missionaries were good. He also criticizes the Communist Party, and asserts the Communism does not work in China in this book."

But the preface to the third book of madrigals reveals that he had made a pilgrimage to the Holy Land and stayed in Cyprus as guest of a certain noble cavaliere, Piero Singlitico. His first book of madrigals was written in the rapid note nere, black note, style introduced by Constanzo Festa. Theodor Kroyer (1902) believed that Martoretta's madrigals demonstrated chromatic keys."

He received a Fulbright Scholarship to study film at the University of Southern California, Los Angeles. With his partner Juan Luis Cano, Fesser created in 1984 Gomaespuma, a company that has produced shows and commercials for radio and television as well as books, music albums and cultural events. Both Fesser and Cano, lead since 2000 the Gomaespuma Foundation. This non profitable organization is mostly dedicated to facilitate an access to education to hundreds of children in Nicaragua and Sri Lanka. But Gomaespuma Foundation has supported another kind of programs like the drilling of water wells in Southern Senegal. To raise funds, Gomaespuma organizes cultural events as the Flamenco Festival Flamenco Pá Tós that promotes flamenco dance and music locally in Madrid (Spain), and internationally in cities like Beijing (China), Argel (Argelia) and Managua (Nicaragua). Profits from the festival help finance the educational projects. He was the director, executive producer and one of the screenwriters of the film Cándida (2006). He is also brother of a film director Javier Fesser and the cultural promoter Alberto Fesser."

Hunt is a former Olympic hopeful and Commonwealth diver who has a number of medals at Great Britain National Diving championships and placed 3rd in the 10m Synchro event at the 2006 Commonwealth Games. He chose to focus his diving career in the niche area of Cliff Diving, and has enjoyed an extremely rapid rise to the top of the sport. In 2010 he won the Red Bull Cliff Diving World Series, the premier championship within the sport, showing complete domination throughout the series and is thus considered to be the current reigning World Champion. He has a reputation for being a daredevil, pushing the sport to new extremes and inventing spectacular new moves to stay ahead of his competition."

  "text" : "George Edward Lavender (born September 7, 1955) is an American state politician and a Republican former two-term member of the Texas House of Representatives, having been first elected on November 2, 2010. Though he was reared in Texarkana, Arkansas, Lavender is a businessman in Texarkana in Bowie County, Texas, where he resides with his wife, the former Jan Timberlake. He graduated in 1973 from Arkansas High School in Miller County, Arkansas. He holds an undergraduate degree in management from the University of Arkansas at Fayetteville. Lavender was defeated, 45-55 percent in the 2008 general election by the Democratic incumbent, Representative Stephen James Frost of New Boston, also in Bowie County. However, in 2010, with 51.5 percent of the vote, Lavender unseated Frost. Earlier, in both 1994 and 1996, Lavender ran unsuccessfully for the District 1 seat in the Texas State Senate, first as a Democrat, then as a Republican. In the 2011 House session, Lavender served on the Transportation and the Land and Resource Management committees. He worked for passage of legislation signed by Governor Rick Perry, which permits the manufacture of incandescent light bulbs in Texas. Lavender contends that fluorescent light bulbs contain mercury and are manufactured mostly in China. Lavender said consumers should have the choice of light bulbs and jobs in the industry should be kept in the United States. In the 2012 general election Lavender faced no Democratic opponent. To secure his second term, he received 42,049 votes (82.6 percent) to the Libertarian Tim Eason's 8,830 ballots (17.4 percent). In the Republican primary election held on March 4, 2014, Lavender was unseated in his bid for a third legislative term by Gary VanDeaver, the former school superintendent of the New Boston Independent School District in New Boston, Texas, who received 9,400 votes (54.3 percent) to Lavender's 7,898 (45.7 percent). On March 1, 2016, VanDeaver defeated Lavender in a rematch in the Republican primary. VanDeaver polled 18,263 votes (61.9 percent) to Lavender's 11,242 (38.1 percent)."

He was re-elected MP for Pontefract for the Long Parliament in November 1640. On the outbreak of the English Civil War, he joined the Royalist cause and was disabled from sitting in parliament in September 1642. He raised a regiment for the King, at his own expense. Wentworth died at the age of 60 and was buried at the church of St Peter, Woolley, where there is a memorial in the Wentworth Chapel. Wentworth married twice. His first marriage was to Anne Fairfax, daughter of Thomas, Lord Fairfax of Denton, by whom he had two sons. His second marriage was to Everild Maltby, second daughter of Christopher Maltby of Maltby, and by her he had further children. She was a matrilineal descendant of Cecily Neville, Duchess of York, and the mitochondrial DNA descent through which the remains of Richard III of England were identified in 2013 passes through her and their daughter Frances:"

Minoret famously won one of the four rotating annual positions for sous-maîtres at the Chapelle royale in 1683, organised by Louis XIV following the retirement of Henry Du Mont and Pierre Robert. Unfortunately compared to both de Lalande, who won the most prestigious Christmas turn of the four positions, and Pascal Collasse who in most opinions came second, Minoret and his colleague Nicolas Goupillet have been consigned by music historians to the roles of musical mediocrities. Prior to the competition he had been maître de chapelle at Orléans Cathedral since 1679."

  "text" : "George Forbes, 6th Earl of Granard (1760–1837), was an Irish general. Forbes was the eldest son of George Forbes, 5th Earl of Granard, by his first wife, Dorothy, second daughter of Sir Nicholas Borley, baronet, of the Isle of Anglesea, and great-grandson of Admiral George Forbes, 3rd Earl of Granard. He was born on 14 June 1760, he was educated at Armagh. He married, 10 May 1779, Lady Selina Frances Rawdon, youngest daughter of John Rawdon, 1st Earl of Moira, by his third wife, Lady Elizabeth Hastings, eldest daughter of the ninth Earl of Huntingdon. By this lady, who was sister of the first Marquis of Hastings, Granard had nine children. On succeeding to the title, the year after his marriage, he made a lengthened tour on the continent. He was introduced to Cardinal York at Rome, attended one of Frederick the Great's reviews in Silesia, and resided in France and at Vienna. On his return home he devoted himself to politics, and, following the example of Lord and Lady Moira, adopted liberal opinions, and with his votes and interest steadily supported the policy of Charlemont, Grattan, Curran, and other leaders of the liberal party in Ireland. The Marquis of Buckingham referred to him as the most uncompromising opponent of his administration. Granard was appointed a lieutenant-colonel in the army 17 May 1794, and lieutenant-colonel commandant of the 108th foot, an Irish regiment which he raised in November following. The 108th was disbanded at Gibraltar in 1796. Granard also raised the Longford militia, and commanded it at the battle of Castlebar in 1798, where the regiment, which was said to be disaffected, ran away. Lord Cornwallis wrote in highest praise of Granard's gallantry in endeavouring to rally his regiment (Cornwallis Correspondence, ii. 393). He was also present at Ballinamuck, where the French, under Humbert, surrendered to Cornwallis. Granard displayed the greatest aversion to the union, an opinion from which none of the inducements then so lavishly offered by the government made him swerve, and he was one of the twenty-one Irish peers who recorded their protest against the measure (see ‘Protest of the Irish House of Lords,’ Ann. Reg. 1800, p. 196). Having been deprived of his seat in the House of Lords after the union, he took little part in politics, but devoted himself to the management of his estates, and is said to have been a popular landlord. During the brief administration of ‘All the Talents’ in 1806 he was made a peer of the United Kingdom under the title of Baron Granard of Castle Donington, Leicestershire (the seat of his father-in-law), and was also appointed clerk of the crown and hanaper in Ireland, then a most lucrative office. He became a colonel in the army in 1801, major-general in 1808, and lieutenant-general in 1813. He afterwards resided chiefly in France. He came to England to support both the Roman Catholic Emancipation and Reform Bills, and after the passing of the latter was offered a promotion in the peerage, which he declined, as he had previously refused the order of St. Patrick. He was made full general in July 1830. He died at his residence, the Hôtel Marbœuf, Champs-Elysées, Paris, 9 June 1837, at the age of seventy-seven, and was buried in the family resting-place at Newtownforbes, County Longford, Ireland."

After two years in California, he moved to Milwaukee, where he studied painting with Samuel Marsden Brookes. After six years of study in Milwaukee, Denny returned to San Francisco and established a studio on Bush Street. In 1862, Brooks moved to San Francisco and shared a studio with Denny. In 1868, Denny spent two months in Hawaii visiting several islands. He is also known to have visited Canada and South America. Denny died of malaria in Cambria, California on Oct. 7, 1886. The Berkeley Art Museum and Pacific Film Archive, the Bishop Museum (Honolulu), the Crocker Art Museum (Sacramento, California), the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco, Monterey Peninsula Museum of Art, and the Oakland Museum of California are among the public collections holding works by Gideon Jacques Denny."

  "text" : "George Grieve (or Greive, as he latterly spelt it), (1748-1809), was the persecutor of Madame Du Barry. Grieve was the son of Richard Grieve, an attorney, of Alnwick, by Elizabeth Davidson. Both Richard and the grandfather, Ralph, a merchant, had been prominent at Alnwick in political contests, and George's elder brother, Davidson Richard, was high sheriff of Northumberland in 1788. Grieve, on coming of age, had to go to law with the corporation to take up his freedom, their plea being that his father, who had died in 1765 at the age of eighty-four, had been temporarily disfranchised at the time of George's birth. In 1774 he took an active part in defeating the Duke of Northumberland's attempt to nominate both of the members for the county, and in 1778 he headed a mob in levelling the fences of a portion of the moor which the corporation had presented to the duke's agent. About 1780, having wasted his patrimony, he emigrated to America, where he became acquainted with Washington and other founders of the republic. He is said to have been sent on a mission to Holland, and about 1783 he took up his abode at Paris. He probably represented America in revolutionary demonstrations, and in the winter of 1792, during Madame Du Barry's visit to London in search of her stolen diamonds, he took lodgings at an inn at Louveciennes, won over two of her servants to the side of the revolution, held a club in her house, and procured an order for seals to be placed on her papers and valuables. On her return in March 1793 he drew up a list of ‘suspects’ for arrest, her name being the first, and on 1 July he escorted the municipality to the bar of the convention, where authority to apprehend her was obtained. A petition from the villagers having effected her release, he published on 31 July a virulent pamphlet entitled ‘L'égalité controuvée ou petite histoire … de la Du Barry.’ He signed himself ‘Greive, défendeur officieux des braves sans-culottes de Louveciennes, ami de Franklin et de Marat, factieux et anarchiste de premier ordre, et désorganisateur du despotisme dans les deux hémisphères depuis vingt ans.’ On 22 September, he obtained a fresh order for her arrest, and escorted her part of the way to Paris in the carriage, but a petition again secured her release. On 19 Nov. she was once more apprehended. Grieve, who had wormed her secrets out of her two faithless servants, superintended the search for her jewels, concealed in dungheaps; he got up the case against her, and was himself one of the witnesses. He may have been urged on by Marat, who had invited him to dinner the very day of his assassination, but he was apparently infected with the mania of delation, for he denounced the Jacobin ex-priest Roux as Charlotte Corday's accomplice, on the ground of having seen him ‘look furious’ when calling on Marat. This denunciation, however, had no effect. On Robespierre's fall Grieve was arrested at Amiens, and was taken to Versailles, where twenty-two depositions were taken against him, but the prosecution was dropped. Returning to America, he resided at Alexandria, Virginia, and published in 1796 a translation of Chastellux's ‘Travels.’ He eventually settled at Brussels, where he died 22 February 1809, the register describing him as a native of ‘Newcastel, Amérique.’ He appears to have been unmarried, and to have broken off all intercourse with his kindred. Vatel, who had examined some of his manuscripts in the National Archives, Paris, testifies to his thorough mastery of French, and his pamphlet, the copy of which in the French National Library contains autograph corrections, bespeaks a familiarity with the classics."

  "text" : "Gunnar Bratlie (8 October 1918 – 14 June 1990) was a Norwegian illustrator. He was born in Fredrikstad, and worked in Oslo and Røros before returning to Fredrikstad in 1981. He is known for his book covers and illustrations, such as the complete works of Selma Lagerlöf and Alexandre Dumas, and the local historical work Fredrikstad bys historie. During the occupation of Norway by Nazi Germany he was imprisoned with editor of Norsk Ukeblad Ernst Ancher-Hanssen for a caricature of Vidkun Quisling in Norsk Ukeblad in February 1943 (#8). The caricature portrayed Quisling as an unsteady ice skating boy, who was being helped to stand up by a man with a Hitler moustache. Bratlie was imprisoned in Grini concentration camp from 19 February 1943 to 22 March 1945. He continued to draw while inside, and a collection of these drawings was published in 1945 under the title Skisser i smug, with a preface written by co-prisoner and professor Francis Bull. Bratlie kept his sketches hidden in a hollow leg of a table, and they were smuggled out of the camp from time to time. Several of his sketches were also published in the two-volume book Griniboken. His main techniques were etching and serigraphy, but he also did paintings and acquarels. The first exhibition of his art was in Kunstnerforbundet in 1968. In total he was exhibited about 30 times, as well as several collective exhibitions. His works have been bought by such institutions as the National Gallery of Norway, the Museo del'arte in Pistoia and the Accademia delle bell'arte in Catania. From 1978 to 1985 he was granted the State Guarantee Income for Artists. He died in June 1990 and was buried in Glemmen."

  "text" : "George Griffith (1601–1666), was bishop of St. Asaph. Griffith was born at Penrhyn in Carnarvonshire on 30 September 1601, and was educated at Westminster School, whence he proceeded to Oxford and became a Westminster student of Christ Church in 1619. He proceeded B.A. in 1623, and M.A. in 1626, and became distinguished as a tutor at his college and a popular preacher. He became domestic chaplain to Bishop John Owen of St. Asaph, who made him a canon of St. Asaph and rector of Newtown, Montgomeryshire, in 1631. In 1632 he gave up Newtown for the rectories of Llandrinio and Llanfechain, also on the presentation of his patron. In 1633 he surrendered Llanfechain for the richer rectory of Llanymynech. In 1635 he proceeded D.D. In 1640, as a proctor in convocation, he urged the necessity of a new edition of the Welsh Bible, none having been published since that of Bishop Parry in 1620. Griffith was not ejected from Llanymynech by the parliamentary commissioners. John Walker must be wrong. He described himself as an ‘episcopal presbyterian,’ and waged a fierce war against independents and other sectaries, defended the parochial system, and boasted that ‘he had withstood popery both by writing and preaching as much as any minister in Wales.’ In 1652 he accepted the challenge which the famous itinerant, Vavasor Powell, threw down to any minister in Wales, to dispute whether his calling or Powell's, and his ways or his opponent's ‘ways of separation’ were most conformable to scripture. After some preliminary skirmishing, in which Griffith held up to ridicule the bad Latin of his adversary, the disputation was held on 23 July 1652, and, if Wood's partial testimony can be accepted, Powell ‘fell from want of academic learning and of the true way of arguing.’ Both parties claimed the victory and rushed into print. Powell wrote his account in the ‘Perfect Diurnall,’ while three pamphlets were Griffith's contributions to the controversy. They were: 1. ‘A Bold Challenge of an Itinerant Preacher (Vavasor Powell) modestly answered by a Local Minister to whom the same was sent and delivered; and severall Letters thereupon’ [in Latin], London, 1652, 4to. 2. ‘A Relation of a Disputation between Dr. Griffith and Mr. V. Powell, and since some false observations made thereon,’ London, 1653, 4to. 3. ‘A Welsh Narrative corrected and taught to speak true English and some Latine, or, Animadversions on an imperfect relation in the \"Perfect Diurnall,\" Numb. 138, 2 Aug. 1652, containing a narration of the Disputation between Dr. Griffith and Mr. Vavasor Powell, near New Chappell in Mountgomeryshire, 23 July 1652,’ London, 1653. The ‘British Museum Catalogue’ also assumes that Griffith was the George Griffith who wrote prefaces to devotional works of William Strong, preacher at the Charterhouse, but it is more likely that this was George Griffith of the Charterhouse, ejected for nonconformity in 1662. After the Restoration the patronage of Sheldon secured for Griffith the bishopric of St. Asaph. He was elected on 16 Oct. and consecrated on 28 Oct., along with four other bishops, in Henry VII's Chapel at Westminster, Duppa acting as consecrator and J. Sudbury, afterwards dean of Durham, preaching the sermon, which was published. It was the first consecration of bishops after the Restoration. He was allowed to retain his old preferments in commendam, as well as the archdeaconry and the sinecure rectory of Llanrhaiadr yn Mochnant, as the revenues of his see were ‘insufficient to maintain the state of a prelate’ (Cal. State Papers, Dom. 1660–1, p. 322). Though not a commissioner, Griffith took some part in the Savoy conference, ‘speaking but once or twice a few words calmly’ (Kennett, p. 508). Lloyd (Memoirs, p. 100, fol. ed.) says that he ‘not only concurred effectually in drawing up the Act of Uniformity, but the form of baptism for those of riper years was of his composing.’ He was one of the three bishops charged with that task (Kennett, p. 449). The main work of Griffith's bishopric was to restore order and uniformity and look after the fabrics of the churches. In 1662 he published ‘Articles of Enquiry concerning matters Ecclesiastical exhibited in his primary Episcopal Visitation.’ He died on 28 Nov. 1666, and was buried in the choir of his cathedral. The short inscription ends quaintly, ‘qui plura desiderat, facile investiget.’ A half-length portrait of him in his episcopal habit is in Christ Church Hall. Besides the pamphlets against Powell, Griffith wrote some ‘Plain Discourses on the Lord's Supper,’ published at Oxford in 1684. In 1685 there was also printed at Oxford ‘Gweddi'r-Arglwydd wedi ei hegluro, mewn amrŷw ymadroddion, neu bregethau byrbion, o waith G. Griffith diweddar escob Llanelwy.’ This was reprinted in 1806 at Carnarvon. He is said to have undertaken the translation of the revised prayer-book into Welsh, and may have written the pamphlet, also attributed to Charles Edwards, author of ‘Hanes y Ffydd,’ ‘On some Omissions and Mistakes in the British translation of the Bible,’ 1666. Some writings by him are preserved in manuscript in the collection of Miss Conway Griffiths, his descendant (Hist. MSS. Comm. 5th Rep. p. 406). Griffith left six children, one son and five daughters. One of these was married to John Middleton of Gwaenynog, in which house a portrait of the bishop is said still to remain."

In 1817, Hogarth, his brother-in-law James Ballantyne and Walter Scott bought the Edinburgh Weekly Journal. He first worked as a music critic for The Harmonicon during the 1820s continuing in the early 1830s after moving his family to London. In 1831 Hogarth was editor of a pro-Tory newspaper the Western Luminary, then in 1832 moved to Halifax becoming the first editor of the Halifax Guardian.From 1846–1866 he worked as a music critic for The Daily News, a paper which was founded by the novelist Charles Dickens. He had previously met Dickens in 1834 while they were both working for the Morning Chronicle. In 1836 Dickens married Hogarth's eldest daughter Catherine. One of his younger daughters, Georgina, was Dickens' housekeeper, adviser, and, after Dickens' death, the editor of The Letters Of Charles Dickens From 1833 To 1870. From 1850–1864 Hogarth served as the Royal Philharmonic Society's Secretary. During the last years of his life he worked as an editor for the Evening Chronicle.

  "text" : "Sir Guy Fairfax (died 1495), was an English judge. Fairfax was of a Yorkshire family, and third son of Richard Fairfax of Walton, by his wife, Anastasia, daughter of John Carthorpe. He is mentioned in 1421 as seised of the manor of Hameldene, being then very young. From his father he inherited the manor of Steeton in Yorkshire, where he built a castle. At first he seems to have been occupied with purely local business. He was in the commission of array for the West Riding in 1435, and in 1460 was commissioned to inquire what lands there were in that riding belonging to Richard, duke of York, who had been attainted in the previous parliament. One of his colleagues was Sir William Plumpton, whose counsel he afterwards was in 1469. He first appears in the year-books in Michaelmas 1463 as a serjeant and member of Gray's Inn. On 28 April 1468 he was appointed King's serjeant, and in 1476 became Recorder of York. He was raised to a judgeship of the King's bench and is first mentioned as a judge in Trinity term (around mid April to end of June) 1477. In this office he won an honourable reputation, and on 8 October 1482 he received a grant of a hundred merks yearly in addition to his salary. He was continued in his judgeship on each subsequent Demise of the Crown, and under Edward V became chief justice of Lancaster. He died in 1495. By his wife, Margaret, a daughter of Sir William Ryther, he had six children, four sons (the eldest, William, a Judge of the Common Pleas under Henry VIII) and two daughters."

  "text" : "Jean Baptiste August \"Guus\" Kessler Jr. (The Hague 16 June 1888 – The Hague 5 November 1972) was a Dutch industrialist. Kessler also played tennis for the Netherlands in the 1906 Olympics in Athens, losing his first match to future Olympic champion Max Decugis. Kessler was born in a very wealthy family from The Hague, the second son of six children. His father Jean Baptiste August Kessler (1853–1900) was the first director of the Koninklijke Nederlandse Petroleum Maatschappij (Royal Dutch Petroleum Company), now named Royal Dutch Shell. Guus studied engineering at Delft University. Both Guus and his older brother Geldolph Adriaan Kessler were considered the \"crown princes\" of the Royal Dutch, but after their father died unexpectedly they had to work under their father's domineering successor, Henri Deterding. Dolf eventually left, at the urging of his fiance, and helped create and lead the Dutch steel company Hoogovens. Guus, by contrast, seemed to get along better with Deterding. \"The brothers were also strong willed but only Guus, the younger son, succeeded in controlling his emotions and avoiding coming into conflict with Deterding, in order to reach his ultimate goal,\" wrote Joost Junker and Jan Luiten van Zandem in their history of the company. The two brothers, as leading figures in two major Dutch business concerns, at one point formed a joint venture between the Hoogovens and Royal Dutch Shell to combat a threat to the oil business by IG Farben. Guus, who became a director of Royal Dutch in 1923, was instrumental in leading Shell into the petroleum-based chemicals business. Guus was the \"obvious candidate\" to lead Royal Dutch Shell after Deterding was forced out in 1936, but instead he was passed over in favor of a compromise choice. \"It must have been a huge disappointment to Kessler to see his life's ambition thwarted with fulfillment so near.\" He eventually achieved his dream and became director-general of Royal Dutch Shell in the years 1947-1949, retiring at age 60. For the next 12 years, he served as president-commissioner of the company. Guus and his first wife, Anna Francoise \"Ans\" Kessler-Stoop (1889–1983), had five daughters and one son. In 1932, they commissioned the noted French Fauvist Raoul Dufy to paint a portrait of the family on their horses, a work that now hangs in the Tate Collection in London. Ans was a noted collector of modern art, advised by her uncle C. Frank Stoop, and donated to the Tate Collection a substantial portfolio that included works by Pablo Picasso, Henri Matisse, Amedeo Modigliani and Edgar Degas. She purchased a Vincent van Gogh painting on paper in 1930 and it was sold at auction for 8.8 million British pounds in 1997 by a family trust. The marriage of Guus and Ans ended in divorce. He married Thalia \"Lia\" de Kempenaer (1917–2000) in 1948."

He is best known as a principal civil rights organizer in North Carolina during the 1960s which landed him a reputation as \"The Great Agitator\", having been jailed eighty-seven times during his lifetime. Frinks was also a United States Army veteran who fought in World War II and worked at the U.S naval base in Norfolk, Virginia. After his military career, he began promoting equality for African Americans through organized demonstrations. Frinks' involvement in the Civil Rights Movement brought early civil rights victories to North Carolina, and his willingness to engage in nonviolent, direct action served as a catalyst for civil rights movements in Edenton and nearby towns. After becoming a field secretary of the SCLC, Frinks built a close relationship with Martin Luther King Jr. and often worked with the civil rights leader in organizing desegregation movements until King's death in 1968. Frinks' work as a field secretary and his direct actions against the Jim Crow Laws began a new era for the civil rights movement in North Carolina and the desegregation of the South."

He fought on the Royalist side in the English Civil War Strangways was the son of Sir John Strangways of Melbury in Somerset. In April 1640, he was elected Member of Parliament for Weymouth and Melcombe Regis in the Short Parliament. He was elected MP for Bridport in the Long Parliament in November 1640. He supported the King and was a Colonel in a regiment of horse. He was disabled from sitting in parliament in January 1644 and was fined £10,000 for the service of the navy in August 1644. He was imprisoned in the Tower of London for two and a half years, partly as a hostage for his father. When he was set free, he had a very large gold medal struck, to commemorate his imprisonment. In 1651, as Charles was trying to get out of England after losing the Battle of Worcester, while Charles II stayed at Trent Manor, the home of Francis Wyndham, Wyndham consulted with his cousin Strangways about finding a ship to carry Charles to France. Strangways was unable to help find a boat, but was able to provide 300 gold pieces to Charles, and encouraged Wyndham to search further in the area around Lyme (present-day Lyme Regis.) In 1661 Strangways was elected MP for Dorset for the Cavalier Parliament remaining until his death in 1675. Strangways married Susanna Edwards, daughter of Thomas Edwards mercer of London. Their sons Thomas, John and Wadham were all MPs in Dorset."

  "text" : "Gaston Noury (17 December 1866 in Elbeuf, Normandy - 21 September 1936 Le Havre, Normandy) was a French painter, poster artist, illustrator, cartoonist and theatrical costume designer, working in Le Havre and Paris, where he settled around 1889. His prolific output covered a wide variety of subjects and his images were used for posters, books, postcards, songbooks, genre scenes and fashion plates.  He provided illustrations for magazines such as La Chronique parisienne, Saint-Nicolas, Gil Blas illustré, Journal amusant (1889-1890), and Les Hommes d'aujourd'hui. Noury grew up in Elbeuf where his grandfather was founder and director of the local museum. Noury designed costumes for the Moulin Rouge and Ambassadeurs in the Montmartre district. Most of these costume drawings are dated 1910. The costumes are both childishly innocent and provocative - floral designs and fabrics with seductive cutouts showing legs, midriff, cleavage and sometimes bare breasts. The drawings combine pencil and watercolour washes, portraying young women with stylised faces and delicate hands and feet."

She is also the American record holder in most W80 and W85 track events from the 400 metres through the 10,000 metres and several road running records going back to 1991 when she was 70 years old. Davidson first took up jogging for exercise when she moved to Fallbrook in the 1970s. It was the era of the running boom of the 1970s and the thing to do. Eventually she took on competitive running by entering the annual L'eggs Mini-Marathon in nearby San Diego. That was the only race she did for several years until it was discontinued. The competitive bug had bitten, she became a fixture in the local running scene, has run in marathons coast to coast and began running in the sport of masters athletics. It was coincidental that she set her Mile world record on the same day that Alan Webb broke Jim Ryun's fabled high school mile record. She died in Seal Beach, California on August 5, 2011."

  "text" : "Giuseppe Sanmartino or Giuseppe Sammartino (1720–1793) was an Italian sculptor during the Rococo period. Sanmartino was born in Naples. His first dated (1753) work is The Veiled Christ or Christ lying under the Shroud, commissioned initially from the Venetian sculptor Antonio Corradini who did not live to complete the work. Sammartino interpreted his sketches freely to create a masterful sculpture which can be seen in Sansevero Chapel (also called Cappella Sansevero or Pietatella) in Naples. Other contributors to this chapel were Francesco Celebrano and the Genoese sculptor Francesco Queirolo. The statue of Veiled Christ is elaborately artificial (art historian Wittkower labeled it as a hypertrophic effort) by reproducing in stone, the effect of a thin veil. In the same chapel, Corradini's antecedent statue of Chastity (also called Modesty) is present. Successful completion of this commission earned Sammartino further commissions. These included the group of St. Augustine in the Neapolitan church of Sant'Agostino alla Zecca, the decoration of the Annunziata church, and the monument to Philip of Calabria in the Basilica of Santa Chiara. He also executed a series of nativity scenes."

  "text" : "Gaurakisora Dasa Babaji (1838–1915) is a well-known acharya from the Gaudiya Vaishnava tradition of Hinduism, and is regarded as a Mahatma or saint by followers of his lineage. During his lifetime Gaurakisora Dasa Babaji became famous for his teachings on the process of Bhakti Yoga and for his unorthodox avadhuta like behaviour as a sadhu, or babaji in Vrindavan. He was born on November 17, 1838 in a simple mercantile family in the village of Vagyana, near to Tepakhola in the district of Faridpur, part of modern-day Bangladesh. After the death of his wife when he was thirty years old, he accepted the life of a Babaji in the Gaudiya Vaishnava tradition under the tutelage of Jagannatha Dasa Babaji, after meeting the latter's disciple, Bhagavat Dasa Babaji. He became a mendicant, staying in the holy cities of Vrindavan and Navadwip, deeply absorbed in singing and chanting the sacred names of Radha and Krishna (Bhajan). In 1900, Gaurakisora Dasa Babaji gave initiation (diksha) to Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura. The former gave the latter the name 'Varsabhanavi devi dayita Dasa'. Gaurakisora Dasa Babaji's legacy would live on his only disciple Bhaktisiddhanta, as he would later go on to preach all over India with his Gaudiya Math. Bhaktisiddhanta in turn gave diksha to A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada, who preached the philosophy and culture of the Gaudiya Vaishnavism tradition on a worldwide basis through his International Society for Krishna Consciousness."

During a meeting at Robinson's Drug Store it was Rappleyea who convinced a group of Dayton businessmen to sponsor a test case of the Butler Act, which prohibited the teaching of evolution in the state's schools. Rappleyea is held responsible for convincing John T. Scopes to be the defendant in the famous \"Monkey\" Trial. (Note: The name is often spelled \"Rappalyea\" but the spelling \"Rappleyea\" is what appears in L. Sprague de Camp's book The Great Monkey Trial and the author interviewed Rappleyea before his death.)

  "text" : "Giovanni Girolamo Saccheri (Italian pronunciation: [dʒoˈvanni dʒiˈrɔlamo sakˈkɛri]; 5 September 1667 – 25 October 1733) was an Italian Jesuit priest, scholastic philosopher, and mathematician. Saccheri was born in Sanremo. He entered the Jesuit order in 1685, and was ordained as a priest in 1694. He taught philosophy at Turin from 1694 to 1697, and philosophy, theology, and mathematics at Pavia from 1697 until his death. He was a protégé of the mathematician Tommaso Ceva and published several works including Quaesita geometrica (1693), Logica demonstrativa (1697), and Neo-statica (1708). He is primarily known today for his last publication, in 1733 shortly before his death. Now considered the second work in non-Euclidean geometry, Euclides ab omni naevo vindicatus (Euclid Freed of Every Flaw) languished in obscurity until it was rediscovered by Eugenio Beltrami in the mid-19th century. Many of Saccheri's ideas have a precedent in the 11th Century Persian polymath Omar Khayyám's Discussion of Difficulties in Euclid (Risâla fî sharh mâ ashkala min musâdarât Kitâb 'Uglîdis), a fact ignored in most Western sources until recently. It is unclear whether Saccheri had access to this work in translation, or developed his ideas independently. The Saccheri quadrilateral is now sometimes referred to as the Khayyam-Saccheri quadrilateral. The intent of Saccheri's work was ostensibly to establish the validity of Euclid by means of a reductio ad absurdum proof of any alternative to Euclid's parallel postulate. To do this he assumed that the parallel postulate was false, and attempted to derive a contradiction. Since Euclid's postulate is equivalent to the statement that the sum of the internal angles of a triangle is 180°, he considered both the hypothesis that the angles add up to more or less than 180°. The first led to the conclusion that straight lines are finite, contradicting Euclid's second postulate. So Saccheri correctly rejected it. However, today this principle is accepted as the basis of elliptic geometry, where both the second and fifth postulates are rejected. The second possibility turned out to be harder to refute. In fact he was unable to derive a logical contradiction and instead derived many non-intuitive results; for example that triangles have a maximum finite area and that there is an absolute unit of length. He finally concluded that: \"the hypothesis of the acute angle is absolutely false; because it is repugnant to the nature of straight lines\". Today, his results are theorems of hyperbolic geometry. There is some minor argument on whether Saccheri really meant this, as he published his work in the final year of his life, came extremely close to discovering non-Euclidean geometry and was a logician. Some believe Saccheri only concluded in such way in an intent to avoid criticism that might come from seemingly illogical aspects of hyperbolic geometry."

From 1857 he was the primo tenore in the choir of the Basilica della Santa Casa in Loreto, a post he held to the end of his life. He made his stage debut in 1858 at the Teatro Valle in Rome where he sang comprimario roles. His debut in a leading tenor role came in 1860, when he sang Pollione in Norma at Pesaro. He was heard in Paris at the Théâtre-Italien in 1863 in the relatively minor role of Barbarino in Alessandro Stradella. However by the 1865-1866 season, he was singing major roles at the Teatro Regio in Parma, including Vasco da Gama in Meyerbeer's L'Africaine, Lamberto in the world premiere of Giovanni Rossi's Niccolò de' Lapi, and the Duke of Mantova in Rigoletto."

Later, in 1928, in collaboration with chemist Nathalie Krebs, he started a ceramics workshop, which became Saxbo in 1930, which kept making his stoneware until 1932. Nylund worked for Rörstrand from 1931–1955, the majority of the time as artistic director. He became well known for his new matte feldspar glazed stoneware in hare’s fur and crystal glazes and for his stoneware animal sculptures. Over five decades, Nylund crafted some 30 reliefs and sculptures commissioned for public spaces. Moreover, in the 1940s he was commissioned to do several freelance projects, including designing bathroom fixtures and interiors for the Swedish bathroom manufacturer Ifö. He also designed a number of products for refrigerator use. From 1955, he was artistic director for Strömbergshyttans glassworks in Hovmantorp, and later freelanced for the company. In the early 1960s, Nylund returned to Copenhagen. There he started producing stoneware for Nymölle Keramiska Fabrik in Lyngby. After a change of ownership at Rörstrand in the mid-1960s, he re-turned to Nymölle as a freelancer, producing a more industrial class type of stoneware. At this time he also created Europe’s largest stoneware fountain the “Scanisarius” in Bromölla, Sweden."

  "text" : "Guo Feixiong (Chinese: 郭飞雄; born 2 August 1966) is the pen name of Yang Maodong (杨茂东), a Chinese human rights lawyer from Guangdong province who is often identified with the Weiquan movement. Guo is known as a dissident writer and \"barefoot lawyer\", who has worked on several controversial issues to defend the rights of marginalized groups. Prior to his 2006 imprisonment, Guo worked as a legal advisor to the Shanghai Shengzhi Law Firm. In 2005 and 2006, human rights groups reported that Guo was taken into custody and beaten on multiple occasions for his human rights advocacy, including his work on the Taishi village standoff. The beating of Guo Feixiong was reportedly one of the catalysts behind a rolling nationwide hunger strike organized by Guo's friend and associate Gao Zhisheng. Guo was arrested on 30 September 2006 and detained on charges of \"illegal business activity\" connection with the publication of a book on a political scandal in Liaoning province, Shenyang Political Earthquake. After being held in pre-trial detention for 17 months, he was sentenced to five years of imprisonment at the Meizhou Prison on 14 November 2007 in what was characterized as a \"trial marked with serious procedural irregularities.\" In addition to his sentence, Guo was fined 40,000 yuan. Family members reported that Guo was tortured in custody, deprived of sleep, and shocked with electric batons. Guo was released on 13 September 2011, and stated that he remained committed to the cause of human rights advocacy. On 8 August 2013, Guo was again arrested on suspicion of \"gathering a crowd to disrupt order in a public place\". On 10 December 2013, the Tianhe District Branch of the Guangzhou Municipal Public Security Bureau recommended that Guo be indicted for the crime of \"gathering a crowd to disrupt order in a public place\", along with Sun Desheng, another activist. On 29 October 2013, the United States House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Africa, Global Health, Global Human Rights and International Organizations held a hearing on the circumstances surrounding China's detention of Guo Feixiong. Guo is the recipient of the 2015 Front Line Defenders Award for Human Rights Defenders at Risk."

  "text" : "George Stone (1907–2001) was a British socialist journalist. Born in Fulham, Stone studied at the London School of Economics and joined the Independent Labour Party (ILP). During World War II, he worked for the Aeronautical Inspection Department, and he subsequently moved to Glasgow. In 1947, he became joint editor with Frank Ridley of the party's weekly newspaper, the Socialist Leader and, when Ridley resigned the following year, he continued as sole editor. Stone stood for the ILP in Glasgow Bridgeton at the 1955 general election, taking only 7.4% of the vote in a seat the party had held until 1947. He stood again at the Glasgow Bridgeton by-election, 1961, his vote declining further to only 3.1%. By this point, he was also Chairman of the Scottish Divisional Council of the ILP. Soon afterwards, he began working as a sub-editor with the Glasgow Herald, quickly becoming Father of the Chapel of the National Union of Journalists (NUJ). In 1966, he was appointed as the full-time NUJ official for Scotland and Northern England, serving until 1975."

  "text" : "George Henry Strutt DL (14 September 1826 – 14 April 1895) was an English cotton manufacturer and philanthropist. Strutt was born at Belper, Derbyshire, the son of Jedediah Strutt (1785–1854) and his wife Susannah Walker. The Strutt family had been cotton manufacturers at Belper since the time of Jedediah Strutt. Strutt lived at Bridge Hill House, Belper. He instigated the construction of Christ Church, Belper which was completed in 1850 and subsequently funded a substantial stone vicarage. He was a J.P. and Deputy Lieutenant of Derbyshire. In 1869 he was High Sheriff of Derbyshire In 1870 Strutt converted a building in Belper into a cottage hospital for convalescent mill workers. In November 1870 he attended the inaugural meeting of Derbyshire County Cricket Club and became vice president of the club. He arranged for Belper Market Place to be paved in 1880. and donated £1000 to an endowment fund for the Derbyshire Hospital for Sick Children in 1885. In 1887 Strutt became President of Derbyshire County Cricket Club  and was a generous supporter of the club. He donated a fire engine to the town of Belper in 1889. Strutt travelled extensively in continental Europe and his travel diaries from 1864 to 1893, including an account of an earthquake in the Alps, are held in the archives of Derbyshire Record Office  The people of Belper paid for a fountain to be placed in the centre of their market place to thank Strutt for his support. The fountain has never worked because it was never connected to the water supply. Strutt married Agnes Anne Ashton, daughter of Edward Ashton of West End, Prescot, Lancashire, at Belper on 15 September 1846. He was the father of George Herbert Strutt (1854-1928) and daughters Susan Agnes (1847-1894), Lucy Frances (1850-1914) and Clara (1861-1863)."

  "text" : "George Henry William Jerram (15 August 1904 – 20 May 1948) was an Australian rules footballer who played with Geelong and North Melbourne in the Victorian Football League (VFL). Jerrem, a utility, was used as a half forward flanker, back pocket and in the ruck during his career. An interstate player in just his second season, Jerram represented the VFL in the 1927 Melbourne Carnival. He also finished equal sixth in the Brownlow Medal that year, after a good season with Geelong. In 1930 he switched to North Melbourne and didn't miss a game in his first two seasons. He made his last appearance with North Melbourne in 1935 and the following year went to Williamstown, who he captain-coached in 1938. In 144 VFL games, Jerram was never reported by the umpires and off the field worked as a policeman. After leaving the police force, Jerram became a boiler attendant. He died in 1948, from a fractured skull as well as other injuries sustained when he fell on a South Melbourne footpath. Accounts of how he fell varied, with the inquest having an open finding, unable to determine whether it was accidental or as a result of an alleged brawl."

  "text" : "Gary J. Aguirre is an American lawyer, former investigator with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and whistleblower. After working in a law firm briefly, he became a public defender, then worked as a trial lawyer in California. Having reached his professional and financial goals, he took an extended break in 1995. In 2000, he decided to go into public service and went back to law school, focusing on international and securities law. After earning his second law degree, he applied for a job with the SEC, where he became the lead investigator on an insider trading case involving Pequot Capital Management. Suspecting the leaked information came from John J. Mack, a Wall Street titan and major contributor to the 2004 campaign of President George W. Bush, Aguirre wanted to subpoena Mack, but supervisors told him Mack had too much \"political clout\" and would not be pursued. Aguirre complained to a superior about the preferential treatment being given Mack and was fired without warning. A Senate investigation later found his termination to have been an illegal reprisal. In May 2010, Pequot Capital settled its insider trading charges with the SEC for $28 million and a month later, the SEC settled the wrongful termination suit filed by Aguirre for $755,000. Aguirre returned to private practice in San Diego in 2008, specializing in securities law. He has emerged as a major critic of the SEC, calling it an agency that was set up to protect the public from Wall Street, but now protects Wall Street from the public. He represents Darcy Flynn, also an SEC whistleblower, who in summer 2011 was interviewed by staff from three congressional committees. He said that the SEC had destroyed thousands of records of preliminary investigations and that SEC investigators trying to pursue a case against Deutsche Bank were thwarted by Richard H. Walker, then SEC director of enforcement, who shortly thereafter, took a job at Deutsche Bank as general counsel. He also represents Rodolfo Michelon, a whistleblower, a former comptroller at Sempra Global, who claims Sempra paid kickbacks to Mexican government officials and has filed a suit against the SEC alleging the SEC \"outsourced\" its investigation of Sempra to a law firm with ties to Sempra, in effect subverting the law."

  "text" : "George Kerr (1853–1930) was an Australian politician, grazier, and blacksmith. He was born on 7 February 1853 at Beadnell, Northumberland, England and after training to become a blacksmith moved to Queensland in 1877. He became a mining speculator on the Croydon goldfields and then set up his own forge in Tambo, Queensland to service mining operations in the local region. He became involved in local politics for the Australian Labor Party, and in 1893 he was elected to represent the electoral district of Barcoo in the Legislative Assembly of Queensland and served in that post until 1909. He rose to senior positions within the party, culminating in his election as leader of the Queensland Parliamentary Labor Party in 1904 after the death of his predecessor William Henry Brown. Kerr's leadership was complicated by a split in the party in 1905 in which he and other senior Labor figures opted to form a coalition with the Liberal Party to achieve statewide reforms. Although initially he commanded the confidence of the party, a state conference of the party in 1907 rejected Kerr's leadership and the Liberal-Labor coalition, opting to go into the 1907 state election alone. Kerr continued in parliament as an independent Labor member but was challenged by official Labor candidates until his defeat in his seat in 1909. He died on 18 January 1930 in Brisbane and was buried in Toowong Cemetery."

The name Fychan was later anglicised as Vaughan. Gwerful was married to Tudur Penllyn, a drover and wool-trader but also a notable poet, and their son Ieuan also wrote poetry which survives in a number of sources. They may also have had a daughter, Gwenllian, though her poetic abilities have been harder to prove. No work definitely ascribed to Gwerful Fychan is known to survive, but the cywydd titled Cywydd y March Glas (the Grey Horse), sometimes ascribed either to Gwerful Mechain or Tudur Aled, has been suggested as her work. Some early antiquaries confuse her with Gwerful Mechain, who was a contemporary. Her memory persisted in the area of Llanuwchllyn as late as the 20th century and a variety of traditional verses were claimed as by her."

He was born in Kristiania, and after finishing his secondary education in 1935 he studied languages and history before taking a military education. He attended the Norwegian Military Academy-in-exile (in London) and became an officer in 1943. He actively served as a captain until 1945, and was decorated with the Defence Medal 1940–1945. He was hired in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in 1946. He was an attaché and embassy secretary in France from 1947 to 1952 before returning to Norway. He was promoted to assistant secretary in 1952, sub-director in 1959 and deputy under-secretary of state in 1962. In between he was a head teacher at the Norwegian National Defence College from 1957 to 1959. He served as the Norwegian ambassador to NATO and OECD in Paris from 1963 to 1967, and to NATO in Brussels from 1967 to 1970. He was then the director of the Directorate for Civil Protection and Emergency Planning from 1970 to 1974, ambassador to the OECD from 1974 to 1977 and the permanent under-secretary of state in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs from 1977 to 1980. From 1980 to 1985 he was Norwegian the ambassador to France. He was decorated as a Commander with Star of the Order of St. Olav in 1980. He settled in Lillehammer after his retirement, and chaired Oplandske Dampskibsselskap for a period. He was also a member of the Nygaard Haug Committee, a predecessor of the Lund Commission, from 1993 to 1994. This was not uncontroversial because of his career ties to military intelligence. He died in August 2003."

In 1921 he was hired in Fremtiden and replaced in Demokraten by Evald O. Solbakken. In 1931 he was hired in Arbeiderbladet. Under the pen name \"Mr. George\" he became known for his humorous articles in the newspaper. At his death he was also called \"the last of the three great criminal and police reporters in Oslo\", together with Fridtjof Knutsen and Axel Kielland. He was also known for practising journalism as a trade in itself, and not as a part of a political career. He retired in 1964, and died in 1966. He released the criminal novels Mannen med ljåen (1942), Ridderne av øksen (1945) and Den hvite streken (1946), and translated the book S.S. Murder by Quentin Patrick as Mord ombord in 1945. He released several historical books: Rørleggernes Fagforenings historie gjennem 50 år (1934), Telefonmontørenes Forening Oslo, gjennem 50 år (1939), Norsk nærings- og nydelsesmiddelarbeiderforbund: 25-års beretning (1948), De tause vitner: av rettskjemiker Ch.

  "text" : "Glenn Davis (born June 21, 1961) was one of the first web designers. He is best known for his websites Cool Site of the Day and Project Cool and for being a founding member of the Web Standards Project. Davis created Cool Site of the Day in August 1994. Linking to one single recommended site off its homepage each day, the site soon became an arbiter of taste on the Internet, and its award was a coveted prize among Silicon Alley start-ups. Cool Site of the Day also sparked a large number of similar coolness awards. Davis became a celebrity through Cool Site of the Day, giving interviews to magazines and radio networks such as NPR while fending off gifts from site maintainers who sought his recommendation of their sites. Newsweek celebrated Davis as one of the 50 most important people on the Internet in 1995, dubbing him the \"King of Cool.\" In time for the first anniversary of Cool Site of the Day, Davis inaugurated the Cool Site Of The Year award, also known as the Webby, which was first presented in Hollywood, California, in August 1995, and was given to The Spot. Davis left Cool Site of the Day in November 1995. In January 1996 he founded Project Cool with Teresa Martin, a new media specialist at Knight Ridder. This new venture was conceived as an educational resource center teaching web development. Project Cool continued the daily award concept under the name \"Project Cool Sighting.\" The site became a respected and widely used resource on web development techniques, and its founders co-authored two books to complement it. Davis co-founded the Web Standards Project with Tim Bray, Jeffrey Zeldman and George Olsen, among others. In 2000, he founded Astounding Websites, an online forum created to review and discuss the best writing, design, and programming on the web. Davis gave up on the web as a medium in 2002, dismissing it as \"old hat\" because he believed there was little room for significant further breakthroughs. Davis has been recognized for defining the technique of \"liquid\" web design."

  "text" : "Gilbert Davey (7 June 1913 – 6 April 2011) was a writer and radio enthusiast who introduced many youngsters to the rapidly developing fields of Radio and Electronics through his articles published in Boy's Own Paper, and his books, in particular Fun with Radio, first published in 1957, with updates ending in a sixth edition published in 1978. He also presented, beginning in September 1957, a six-part series on the BBC Television children's magazine programme called \"Studio 'E'\". Though an amateur in the field (his real job was as an insurance official), Davey earned freelance income in the years before World War 2 with articles for Practical Wireless and other radio journals. However, they did not make him well-known because many were published without attribution (a list among his papers claims authorship of around thirty articles including a 13-part series for Practical Wireless entitled \"At the Short-Waver's Bench\"). At the end of World War 2, Davey met Jack Cox, who soon became Editor of Boy's Own Paper and recruited him to write radio articles for the paper. These, and his books (published from 1957 onward and edited by Cox), inspired many British youngsters to go on to make careers in the field of Radio and Electronics, by concentrating on a practical approach to building a progression of radio receivers, starting with a Crystal Set and moving through 'One valve', 'Two valve' and 'Five valve Superhet' designs. Many of the titles sound quaint today, but reflect the excitement that many felt about radio at a time when, despite the fact that broadcasting in Britain had existed for some thirty-five years, manufactured sets were still expensive acquisitions. In 1957 the Walkman, or iPod was an unimaginable dream; so that a 'Portable Cycle Radio' was a high status object of desire indeed for many a boy. In his introduction to 'Fun with Radio', Davey referred to Electronics as \"a new modern industry which has rapidly assumed a position of importance in the industrial life of the world\". His designs used a variety of pre-war and post-war valve types such as the 1.4V DAF91, DL94 series, or the 2V HL2K, PM2HL, PM22A series, and generally required two batteries, one of which was a 90V 'HT' battery (an expensive item to be used sparingly). A mains two valve design used the war-surplus, metal-can enclosed, EF50 valves. When transistors first became available to amateurs in the mid-1950s, Davey was initially cautious, believing that their initial high price and variable performance made them an expensive risk for young constructors. However he soon relaxed these reservations, and his first transistor radio design appeared in Boy's Own Paper in January 1957. The title \"Make a Cold Valve Set\" summed up the novelty of the transistor. Davey's subsequent articles and books covered almost every aspect of radio, shortwave listening, high fidelity and electronics for the amateur. Transistor designs came to predominate, and Davey kept up with new developments such as modular construction and integrated circuits. However he never entirely forsook valves (vacuum tubes), recognizing their usefulness as an introduction to basic principles and their continued availability in many parts of the world. Davey always kept in mind the problems faced by young hobbyists: lack of skill, tools and test gear, and availability of components. Some designs were revised several times over the years for the latter reason. Davey's last book, Fun with Silicon Chips in Modern Radio, was published in 1981."

He is also the author of the critically acclaimed The Piano War (David Philip, 2003), an unbelievable yet true story of love and survival set against the horrors of World War II, and of Madiba’s Boys, a non-fiction book on South African football, politics and history, published in South Africa (New Africa Books, 2001) and the United Kingdom (Comerford & Miller, 2001) with a foreword by Nelson Mandela. Madiba’s Boys was a Top Ten Sports Book in the United Kingdom. Friedman has co-edited a collection of prose and poetry entitled A Writer in Stone (David Philip, 1998), and has written on the topics of torture and the political trial, based on his experience as a trauma counsellor and an expert witness for the defence - mostly ANC liberation fighters - during political trials of the apartheid era. He has appeared at writers’ festivals and workshops in South Africa and, more recently, in Sydney, Australia, where he now lives with his wife and their three children."

  "text" : "Gary Kott has five pieces of his artwork, three paintings and two sculptures, held over at Smith Vargas Fine Art in Palm Springs after a successful featured-artist show there in January, 2016. His painting \"Veer\" has been selected by the Palm Springs Art Museum Artists Council/University of California, Riverside for a show running from March 3 through April 22, 2016. Kott's artwork has been selected for viewing at the Rancho Mirage Artists Studio Tour to be held on March 19, 2016. His recent solo show at the Cathedral City Chamber of Commerce ran for three months. Kott's \"Think Stripe\" show at his studio/gallery was attended by more than 150 people. Kott's artists statement reads: I studied art in college but never pursued it until I was well established as a professional scriptwriter in Hollywood. Several factors were responsible for my eventual transition from pen to paint, most importantly a stack of eight-foot by ten-foot sheets of plywood found in the basement of a new house I bought. A week before I’d seen a large, expensive painting in a gallery, a bold color field of red and black. Hmm, I thought, these sheets of plywood were exactly the same size. A quick trip to the local art supply store and I had my first color field hanging over my bed, joined soon by eight-foot by ten-foot color fields in the living room and den. In time I expanded into multi-dimensional sculptures made from junk I treasure-hunted in landfills and city dumps. I was delighted to see people enjoy my typewriters made from carriage bolts and ABS pipe, my seven-foot, found-object guitars oozing in reds, blues, and greens. My paintings moved from plywood to canvas, my color-fields from free-flowing drips to tightly controlled stripes. My evolution from pen to paint has been an exploration of anything and everything I dream up, always capturing images and notions where words fail me. Gary Kott was an American television and advertising writer. A writer and supervising producer of The Cosby Show, Kott worked on the program during its five consecutive years of number one Nielsen ratings."

Roseleip was a businessman; he served in the Wisconsin State Senate from 1963 to 1975. He is perhaps best known for his failed defense of a Wisconsin law prohibiting the sale of margarine. He was challenged to a blind taste test between butter and margarine, and he chose margarine as the better of the two. After his death, his family revealed that for years they had been serving him margarine (purchased in Iowa) instead of butter, because margarine was believed to be healthier than butter."

  "text" : "George Robertus Dixon (18 November 1731 Bishop Auckland - 29 September 1785 Cockfield, County Durham), was a chemist, mathematician, engraver, china-painter, engineer, geologist and coalmine operator, who helped pioneer the use of coal gas in heating and gas lighting - one of his gas experiments leading to the destruction of his own house. George was one of the seven children of George Dixon. (1731-1785), an affluent coal-mine owner, and his wife Mary Hunter of Newcastle. George was also the elder brother of Jeremiah Dixon, who helped survey the Mason-Dixon line in the United States in 1767. In the same year, with a view to easier transporting of local coal, George and other colliery operators, excavated a stretch of canal on Cockfield Fell, hoping eventually to join the River Tees at Barnard Castle or to reach the sea, and dispense with the time-consuming practice of hauling coal over 40 miles to the nearest port - George leased a colliery on Cockfield Fell, from Sir Henry Vane, 2nd Earl of Darlington of Raby Castle, where coal and iron had been worked since medieval times. The enormous cost and factions with conflicting interests ensured the failure of this ambitious canal scheme, but the idea did give rise in time, and with the aid of Edward Pease, to the Stockton and Darlington Railway, which served the same purpose of transporting coal, though passengers were not carried until September 1825. The coal on Cockfield Fell eventually ran out, the last pits closing in 1962. As a result, the Haggerleases branch (formerly the Butterknowle branch) was closed by British Railways in September 1963. The station at Cockfield Fell still stands, but in a poor state of repair. The closure of the Darlington - Barnard Castle - Middleton line in 1965 signalled the death rattle of a once thriving transportation network. George married Sarah Raylton (20 August 1732 - 18 April 1796), the daughter of innkeeper John Raylton and Barbara Dixon, on 13 September 1753. The marriage produced eight children: Mary, George, George (infant deaths often led to the same name's being used for the next child), Jeremiah, John, Thomas, Sarah and Elizabeth. The name 'Raylton' cropped up again with his great-grandson Sir Raylton Dixon, the prominent Victorian shipbuilder."

  "text" : "Gerry Gersten (born 1927, New York City) was a political caricaturist. He grew up in the Bronx, born to Polish Jewish immigrant parents who didn't believe in his calling. “I remember once picking up a copy of Life magazine and saying to them, ‘A page in this magazine would cost an advertiser $50,000, of course you can make a living in this field,’” he recalls. “But I couldn’t convince them. They wanted me to be an accountant.” Gersten studied at the Cooper Union Art School, and Cooper School of Design, before establishing his career as a caricaturist. He drew hundreds of illustrations for publications such as The New York Times, New York Magazine, Sports Illustrated, Time, Newsweek, Harpers, Rolling Stone, Esquire, Harper's and Playboy. His work also adorned many record covers for RCA.On March 29, 1973 his work adorned the cover of Rolling Stone, with a lively depiction of Dr. Hook & the Medicine Show. In 1986, he began work for MAD Magazine, drawing political caricatures of public figures, for MAD's brand of satire. Through these notable assignments, Gersten gained international acclaim, and has collected awards from The Society of Illustrators, The Art Director's Club, and The Society of Publication Designers. His work has been exhibited at the Brooklyn Museum, the Spectrum Gallery, the Daz-marcel Gallery in New York City, various galleries in Connecticut, the Museum of American Illustration, and the Cornell Museum."

Hildebrand earned his Bachelor of Architecture degree from the University of Michigan in 1957 and subsequently worked for the offices of Albert Kahn and Minoru Yamasaki. After completing his Master of Architecture at the University of Michigan in 1964, he joined the faculty of the Department of Architecture at the University of Washington, where he taught until the year 2000. At Washington, Hildebrand taught architectural design, architectural history, and a variety of other classes. He received the University's Distinguished Teaching Award in 1975. In 1978 he became interested in the work of the English geographer Jay Appleton, who developed a theory about the innate appeal of certain landscapes. Hildebrand applied these ideas to architectural space, teaching a course on this topic beginning in 1988. Hildebrand's early research and writing drew on his time with the firm of Albert Kahn, leading to Designing for Industry: The Architecture of Albert Kahn (1974). Hildebrand's interest in the work of Jay Appleton is reflected in two books, The Wright Space: Pattern and Meaning in Frank Lloyd Wright's Houses (1991) and Origins of Architectural Pleasure (1999) which received the Washington Governor's Writers' Award. Hildebrand's recent publications have focused on architecture and design by his friends and colleagues, including books on the houses of Wendell Lovett and Arne Bystrom, projects by Phillip Jacobson, and architecture by Gene Zema and by George Suyama."

When about eighteen years of age he came to London to seek a profession. He thought he saw an opening in the careful application of chemistry to pigments and dyes. War on the continent, by stopping the supply of madder from Holland, threatened to impede his progress. This obstacle, however, led him to consider the nature of its cultivation, and with a well-devised project he waited on Sir Joseph Banks for his advice, and, as he hoped, his co-operation. Sir Joseph, after unsuccessfully attempting to cultivate madder in Essex, had made up his mind that it could not be done in England."

He was admitted B.A. 1592, licensed to be M.A. 9 July 1595, and became vicar of Bishop's Cannings, Wiltshire. Wood relates how Ferebee found and ingeniously made use of an opportunity to display his talents before Queen Anne, the consort of James I, on her way from Bath, in June 1613; in the dress of an old bard, Ferebee, with his pupils in the guise of shepherds, entertained the royal lady and her suite as they rested at Wensdyke (or Wansdyke) with wind-instrument music, a four-part song beginning ‘Shine, O thou sacred Shepherds' star, on silly [or seely] Shepherd swains,’ and an epilogue. This quaint and courtier-like action earned Ferebee the title of chaplain to the king. Nichols mentions the publication, on 19 June of the same year, of ‘A Thing called “The Shepherd's Songe before Queen Anne in four parts complete musical, upon the Playnes of Salisbury.”’ In 1615 appeared ‘Life's Farewell, a sermon at St. John's in the Devises in Wilts, 30 Aug. 1614, at the Funerall of John Drew, gent., on 2 Sam. xiv. 14,’ 4to."

  "text" : "Geoffrey de Turville (died 1250) was an English-born judge and cleric in thirteenth century Ireland , who held office as Bishop of Ossory and Lord Chancellor of Ireland. He was probably a native of Turville in Buckinghamshire: an earlier Geoffrey de Turville (c.1122-1177) was Lord of the Manor of Weston Turville. He is first heard of in Ireland in 1218 in the entourage of Henry de Loundres, Archbishop of Dublin. He was Archdeacon of Dublin before becoming Bishop of Ossory in 1244. He is described as a man who was \"in high favour with the English Crown\". As Bishop of Ossory in 1245 he was granted the right to hold an annual fair and weekly market in Kilkenny; he was also granted the right to hold another annual fair at Durrow, County Laois, together with the right to hold a market there every Thursday, and he was granted similar privileges at Freshford, County Kilkenny.  He was granted the right to a conduit of water to the friars of the Black Abbey, Kilkenny. He also held a number of administrative posts: most notably he was Treasurer of Ireland from 1235-50, and he was also Lord Chancellor of Ireland in about 1237. Elrington Ball praises Geoffrey as a highly trained and able lawyer. Otway-Ruthven credits him as being the first Lord Chancellor of Ireland to develop the Irish Chancery as a Government Department in its own right which was fully independent of the English Chancery, with its own staff and Great Seal. He died in London in October 1250."

He matriculated at Lincoln College, Oxford on 20 June 1623, aged 17 and was awarded BA on 3 May 1625. He was called to the bar at Lincoln's Inn in 1633. In 1645, Horner was elected Member of Parliament for Somerset in the Long Parliament. The election was declared void and Horner was returned on the new writ in 1646. He was a Presbyterian, but was described as \"a known neuter, if not worse\", when he was elected. He was excluded under Pride's Purge in 1648 and took no part in politics during the Interregnum. In 1659, he was regarded as a Royalist. In 1660, Horner was elected MP for Somerset in the Convention Parliament and knighted on 25 June 1660. He served as a Justice of the Peace and a deputy-lieutenant for Somerset from the same year until his death and was High Sheriff of Somerset for 1667–68. Horner died at the age of 71 and was buried at Cloford on 19 February 1677. He had married Anne Pool, daughter of Sir Neville Poole. He was succeeded by his son George who was also MP for Somerset."

  "text" : "Walter Godfrey Bowen MBE (13 February 1922 – 2 January 1994) was a New Zealand farmer and world acclaimed sheep shearer. With his brother Ivan, he developed the Bowen Technique, which involved the shearer using his spare hand to stretch the sheep's skin, which improved the quality of the shorn fleece. They also introduced the idea of shearing sheep twice a year, which is now the usual practice in New Zealand. Bowen set a world record in 1953 by shearing 456 sheep in nine hours. Bowen, along with George Harford set up the Agrodome in Rotorua, which is still a popular tourist spot to this day. Tourists get to see a variety of sheep on display, see a sheep shorn and go on a tour of the farm. In the 1960 Queen's Birthday Honours, Bowen was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire, and in 1990 he was an inaugural inductee into the New Zealand Sports Hall of Fame. Bowen died in Rotorua of a heart attack in 1994, leaving his wife and four children. He was buried at Kauae Cemetery in Ngongotaha."

  "text" : "Gino Bramieri [ˈdʒiːno braˈmjɛːri] (21 June 1928 – 18 June 1996) was an Italian comedian and actor. He was especially known as a television comedian, but also performed in theatres, on radio, and in about thirty movies. He was nicknamed \"Il Re della barzelletta\" (\"the King of jokes\") for his burlesque comic style, which was largely based on his skill at telling funny stories. His jokes were sometimes as quick as a cut and thrust, and bordering on surrealism. They have been collected in a series of books, such as 50 chili fa (\"50 kilos ago\", a collection he published after dieting). Bramieri was born in Milan, Italy, into a humble family. He made his stage debut in 1943, with the prose company in prose of Egisto Olivieri. He later graduated in accountancy at night school. In 1948 he got married and had a son. Bramieri's career was launched by Erminio Macario, who entered him in his revue company in 1949. In his career, he has performed together with many prominent Italian comedians and actors, including Franco Franchi and Ciccio Ingrassia, Peppino De Filippo, Aldo Fabrizi, Ave Ninchi, Nino Taranto, Raimondo Vianello, Renato Rascel, and Totò. His career in television reached its apex in the 1960s–1970s, with RAI television shows such as Tigre contro tigre, Il signore ha suonato?, E noi qui and others; in the 1980s, he conducted a show named after him, the Gino Bramieri show (aka G.B. Show). He died of cancer at the age of 67, and was buried in Milan's Cimitero Monumentale, a privilege that is traditionally reserved to outstanding Milanese citizens. A street of Milan (district of Porta Nuova) as well as an avenue in Rome (in the Pineto city park) have been renamed in his honour."

When George came of age she joined the Convent of St Catherine at Sciennes in Edinburgh. After her son's death in 1549, she arranged the marriage of two of her granddaughters. George Seton was appointed an Extraordinary Lord of Session on 5 March 1542. Like many Scottish nobles he gave his assent to the marriage proposed between Mary, Queen of Scots and Prince Edward of England in 1543. In that year, Seton was given custody of Cardinal Beaton who opposed the English marriage, but Seton allowed the Cardinal to escape. He died in 1549, and was first buried at Culross Abbey as Seton Collegiate Church was in the occupied zone during the war of the Rough Wooing. The English had burnt Seton Palace and the church in May 1548. Sir Richard Maitland, who had worked for the family in their legal affairs, began his History of the House of Seytoun at the request of the 6th Lord Seton, the fourth George of that name, but finished the work in the lifetime of his son George Seton, 7th Lord Seton."

  "text" : "Gerald Barry (18 June 1947 – 14 March 2011) was an Irish political journalist and broadcaster. He worked for public service broadcaster Raidió Teilifís Éireann (RTÉ) and the Sunday Tribune newspaper, during which time he became known for his \"highly probing\", \"highly intelligent\", \"quite rigorous\", \"clinical, even forensic but never discourteous\" interviewing style. Barry was born in Dublin and reared in Clontarf. His parents were Brian and Stella (née O'Driscoll) Barry. His parents and sister died before him, but his brother survives him. He was educated at Scoil Lorcáin and Belvedere College. At Belvedere he played cricket. He studied at University College Dublin (UCD) in the mid-1960s, achieving honours in politics and economics, but being disrupted by illness before returning to rise as auditor of the university's Literary and Historical Society. Barry started working for RTÉ News during the 1970s, reporting on events such as the Falklands War and the political careers of taoisigh Garret FitzGerald and Charles Haughey. In 1978, he became News/Features deputy editor and, later, editor. He spent 11 years as deputy editor of and political correspondent for the Sunday Tribune from 1983 onwards. In 1995, he began to work for the radio programme This Week. He edited and presented This Week on RTÉ Radio 1 until one year before his death from a series of brain haemorrhages resulting from an illness at the age of 63 in 2011. His death led to numerous political tributes, including from Garret FitzGerald and party leaders Eamon Gilmore, Gerry Adams and Micheál Martin, as well as from broadcasters Vincent Browne and Sam Smyth. Barry organised the Tom Kettle seminar which, in 2006, turned out to be Conor Cruise O'Brien's last public speaking appearance. (Kettle was O'Brien's uncle by marriage.)"

  "text" : "Gaius Julius Alexio also known as Alexio II (Greek:  Γάϊος Ἰούλιος Άλεξιὣνος, flourished 1st century) was a Syrian Prince and Roman Client Priest King of Emesa. Alexio was a monarch of Assyrian, Greek, Armenian, Medes, Berber and Roman ancestry. He was the child born to the monarchs Sohaemus of Emesa and Drusilla of Mauretania. The father of Alexio, Sohaemus was an Emesene Prince and ruled as Priest King from 54 until his death in 73. He was the second son of the previous ruling Emesene Monarchs Sampsiceramus II and his wife Iotapa. Alexio’s late paternal uncle was the childless Emesene King Gaius Julius Azizus who was the first husband of the Herodian Princess Drusilla, while he had two paternal aunts, Iotapa who married the Herodian Prince Aristobulus Minor and Mamaea. The mother of Alexio was Drusilla of Mauretania, a Princess from Mauretania North Africa. Drusilla was the child of the late Roman Client Monarchs Ptolemy of Mauretania and Julia Urania. The mother of Drusilla may have been a member of the Royal family of Emesa and her father was a maternal grandson of the Ptolemaic Greek Queen Cleopatra VII of Egypt and Roman Triumvir Mark Antony. The name Alexio is a variant of the ancient Greek name Alexander. The name Alexander was a dynastic name in the Emesani Royal Family; the Seleucid dynasty; the Ptolemaic dynasty and perhaps Alexio’s parents named him an intent to recover their heritage and connections to Alexander the Great. Alexio was a descendant of the Seleucid dynasty; the Ptolemaic dynasty and a distant relative of Alexander the Great through his paternal grandmother and maternal grandfather. Alexio was born and raised in Emesa. After his father died, Alexio succeeded his father as Priest King of Emesa. Alexio ruled as a Priest King from 73 until his death in 78, thus he was a contemporary of the ruling Roman emperor Vespasian. He was the priest of the Syrian Sun God, known in Aramaic as El-Gebal. Little is known on him. What is known about Alexio is from surviving inscriptions from Emesa. There is a noted sepulchral Greek inscription on a monument dated 78/79 at Emesa, dedicated by his son to his family: Γαΐος Ἰούλιος, Φαβίᾳ, Σαμσιγέραμος ὁ καὶ Σείλας, Γαΐου Ἰουλίου Ἀλεξιῶνος υἱὁς, ζῶν ἐποίησεν ἑαυτῷ καὶ τοῖς ἰδίοις, ἔτους ΟτʹGaius Julius Fabia, Sampsiceramus, also called Silas, son of Gaius Julius Alexio, while still living made this for himself and his family, year 390 He married Cladia Arrius Calpurnius Silo of Syriëan (50-110) by whom; he had a son called Gaius Julius Fabia Sampsiceramus III Silas. When Alexio died in 78, his son ruled as Priest King from 79 until his death in 120. After the death of Alexio, the generations after him are not recorded sufficiently to accurately present a pedigree. A descendant of Alexio's is the Emesene high priest Gaius Julius Bassianus, who was the father of the Roman Empress Julia Domna and another possible descendant was the Syrian Queen of the 3rd century, Zenobia of Palmyra."

  "text" : "Gary R. Mar is an American philosopher specializing in Logic, the Philosophy of Mathematics, contemporary analytic philosophy, Asian American Philosophy and the Philosophy of Religion . He was the last dissertation student of the 20th century logician Alonzo Church and currently teaches at Stony Brook University. Gary Mar is co-author with Donald Kalish and Richard Montague of Logic: Techniques of Formal Reasoning (second edition). He is also co-author of The Philosophical Computer with Patrick Grim and Paul St. Denis. An article on the fractal images in the semantics of paradox is contained in Logic, Meaning and Computation: Essays in Memory of Alonzo Church. This work has been discussed by Ian Stewart ('A Partly True Story,' in Scientific American(Feb. 1993),110-112). This research was also presented at the Kurt Gödel Centenary Symposium, Horizons of Truth at the University of Vienna in April 2006. Gary Mar is the founding director of the Stony Brook Philosophy Department Logic Lab at Stony Brook and the founding director of the Asian American Center at Stony Brook, after being the catalyst for the donation of the Charles B. Wang Asian American Center at Stony Brook University, which at that time was the largest donation in the history of the public education system in New York State. In 2003 he hosted a graduate seminar with Noam Chomsky through the President's Rotating Stars Program, and in 2005 he was instrumental in the awarding of an honorary doctorate awarded the documentary filmmaker Loni Ding, whose landmark series Ancestors in the Americas  is the only in-depth documentary on the history of Asians in the Americas. Gary Mar has been the recipient of the Chancellor’s and President’s Award for Excellence in Teaching (1993), the Alumni Association Outstanding Professor Award (1995), a Pew Foundation Research Fellowship (1995-1996), and Stony Brook’s Academy of Scholar-Teachers (1996)."

  "text" : "Guy Laporte (born Beaufort, 15 December 1952) is a former French rugby union player and a sports executive. He played as a fly-half. Laporte first played for Sporting Club Rieumois, where he won the French 3rd Division in 1971/72. He then would play for SC Graulhet. He had his first cap for France national rugby union team at 7 February 1981, in a 19-13 win over Ireland, in Dublin, for the 1981 Five Nations Championship, in a game where he scored 2 penalties and 2 drop goals. He had 16 caps, scoring 3 tries, 19 conversions, 23 penalties and 8 drop goals, 143 points in aggregate, making him one of the top scorers for France in a short international career. He played only twice at the Five Nations Championship, in 1981, winning with a Grand Slam, and 1986, but scored 1 try, 6 conversions, 13 penalties and 6 drop goals, in an aggregate of 73 points. Laporte was called for the 1987 Rugby World Cup, where France was runners-up to New Zealand. He missed the final, but still played three games, scoring 2 tries, 11 conversions, 3 penalties and 1 drop goal, 42 points in aggregate, thus making him the top scorer for France in the competition. His last game was the 31-16 win over Fiji, at 7 June 1987, in Auckland, for the quarter-finals, where he scored 3 conversions, 2 penalties and 1 drop goal, an amazing aggregate of 15 points. Laporte, after finishing his career, was a member of the executive commission of the French Rugby Federation, and vice-president. He was later coach of Castres Olympique."

  "text" : "Guncelin de Badlesmere (c.1232–c.1301), son of Bartholomew de Badlesmere (died 1248), was Justice of Chester and Cheshire in England. Guncelin de Badlesmere was appointed to the office of Justice of Chester and Cheshire on 16 October 1274. He held this position until 1281, when Reynold de Grey was appointed to this role and Gunselm was instructed to deliver the associated premises to him with effect from 29 September of that year. An example of his close connection with the Crown appears in the account of the delivery of the royal seal of King Edward I by his son Edward to the Lord Chancellor, John de Langeton, which took place at Tonbridge Castle, Kent on 27 August 1297, with Sir Guncelin de Badlesmere being one of the witnesses. Gunselin was evidently still alive on 22 March 1299/1300, when Walter de Gloucester, as \"escheator this side the Trent\", was instructed to investigate allegations that Guncelm had damaged property belonging to the estate of Edward, son and heir of Philip Burnel, a minor whom the King had committed into Guncelin's custody. On 13 April 1301, a writ was issued to initiate enquiries into the identity of the next heir of lands that had been held directly from the King by Guncelin de Badlesmere. Presumably, he had died shortly before that date. An inquisition post mortem held on 30 April of that year in respect of land he held in Kent at Badlesmere and Donewelleshethe confirmed that the next heir was his son Bartholomew de Badlesmere, 1st Baron Badlesmere (c.1275–1322). By 4 October 1302, it was established that the damage to Edward Burnel's inheritance had taken place before Gunselin became involved. Therefore, the lands concerned were to be delivered to the executors of Gunselin's will. He died in the 29th year of the reign of Edward I (in 1301), and was buried in Badlesmere church, where in 1800 it was reported that his wooden cross-legged effigy could still be found."

  "text" : "Giovanni di Bartolomeo Cristiani was an Italian painter active in Pistoia and Pisa in the second half of the 14th century. Originally from Pistoia, Cristiani is documented in Florence in 1366. His career is mainly situated in Pistoia and Pisa. The last records about the artist date to 1398. His style points to a training in Pistoia. His work also shows the influence of the Florentine master Niccolò di Tommaso, who had himself worked in Pistoia. Nardo di Cione also seems to have left a mark on Cristiani's style. He is thought by Ciampi to have been employed at the Campo Santo of Pisa in 1382. He is known to have painted a 'Virgin and Child between SS. Nicholas and John the Baptist' in the Oratorio dei Nerli at Montemurlo. His last work, which is now lost, was the decoration of a church in Pistoia, which was begun in 1396 and finished in 1398. Very little remains of this artist's productions, and no exact date is known of his death. In the Sacristy of San Giovanni Evangelista at Pistoia there is a painting by him of 'St. John the Baptist enthroned with Angels' (1370). A fragmentary panel by the artist is in the church of San Michele at Crespina, near Pisa."

Franchini was born in Albuquerque, New Mexico. He attended Loyola University of the South before receiving his B.B.A. from the University of New Mexico (1957). Franchini subsequently earned an J.D. from Georgetown University Law Center, and his LL.M from the University of Virginia. He returned to Albuquerque to practice law in 1960. Franchini was appointed judge in the Second Judicial District in 1975, but resigned to 1981 to protest mandatory sentencing legislation, which he strongly opposed. In 1990 he was elected as a Democrat to the New Mexico Supreme Court, serving until 2002 (including serving as Chief Justice 1997-8). Franchini died in 2009 of a heart attack in Albuquerque while giving an annual lecture on ethics and the role of the judge to University of New Mexico law students. He was survived by Glynnie, his wife of forty years, and four children. The mock trial program in New Mexico is named in his honor. Franchini was highly supportive of it during his lifetime. The National High School Mock Trial Championship awards a Justice Gene Franchini Golden Gavel Award in honor of his contributions."

He teaches and writes about English language teaching, literary stylistics, discourse analysis, advertising, and the language of food politics. He is known for three strands of research: \n* on language teaching, where he has argued for a return to the use of translation and bilingual methods, and for a move away from what he considers to be dull functional approaches \n* on language play and creativity, not only in literature and genres such as advertising, but as a phenomenon which permeates language use, bringing with it educational, social, and cognitive benefits \n* on the language of food politics, in particular genetically modified (GM) and organic food, where he has shown how the campaign for GM crops and food is in his belief unscientific, driven by partisan interests, and characterised by bullying tactics, irrational arguments, and emotive language."

  "text" : "Giovanni Ferrari detto Torretto (5 June 1744, in Crespano del Grappa – 2 November 1826, in Venice) was an Italian sculptor. Giovanni's father, Gaetano, was a stonemason by trade. His mother was Domenica Tedesca. He is the last of well-known artist from the Torretti dynasty of sculptors, which including his great-uncle Giuseppe Torretto and Uncle Giuseppe Bernardi. In 1755 he moved to Venice to joint the studio of the latter, and at Bernardi's death in 1773, he inherited his studio. Ferrari was concerned initially to complete some works of his predecessor, helped, among others, by Antonio Canova, who had been working in the shop since 1744. But by 1777, Ferrari closed the studio, and moved to Mantua, then to Modena, then to Bologna. From 1779 he was in Rome where he worked at the studio of Lorenzo Cardelli, and later under Francesco Antonio Franzoni. He then returned to Venice, where he worked till 1796 on 22 of the statues of Prato della Valle in Padua . For the La Fenice theater (opened in 1792), Ferrari made two statues (Melpomene and Terpsichore) for the facade and helped Giovanni Antonio Moschini complete the bas-reliefs of the interior (only two after the fire of 1837). Shortly afterwards built the monument to Angelo Emo (now preserved in the church of San Biagio), which many consider his masterpiece. In 1804 he was appointed deputy to the Accademia di Belle Arti in Venice. Late in his career, he began working for the family Savorgnan (Count Giulio was called \"my patron\" by the sculptor). Afterwards, the relationship became strained due to missed payments that led Ferrari to go to court. The son Gaetano (died 1847) also became a sculptor; he trained with Rinaldo Rinaldi and worked with Canova."

Tomasevic's award-winning pictures of wars and revolutions have become some of the most enduring images of the conflicts fought in the Balkans, Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and Syria. His broad work includes photographic features from South Sudan, Kashmir, Mozambique, DR Congo, Nigeria and sports coverage of the Olympics and soccer World Cups. After photographing the wars that followed the break-up of former Yugoslavia for a local paper, in 1996 Tomasevic joined Reuters, covering the simmering political tensions in Kosovo and the anti-Milosevic demonstrations in his home town of Belgrade. During NATO's three-month bombardment of Serbia in 1999, Tomasevic was the only photographer working for foreign press to spend the duration of the conflict in Kosovo. Tomasevic moved to Jerusalem in 2002, covering the second Palestinian intifada. During the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq in 2003, his picture of a U.S. Marine watching the toppling of a Saddam Hussein statue became one of the most memorable images of the war. He often returned to Iraq as sectarian violence escalated and regularly photographed America's other war in Afghanistan. His sequence of photographs of U.S. Marine Sergeant Bee narrowly escaping Taliban bullets became an iconic image in U.S. war history. Tomasevic moved to Cairo in 2006 and was at the heart of Reuters' coverage of the Arab Spring. In Libya, his image of a fireball that spewed up after an air strike on pro-Gaddafi fighters became an iconic image of the Libyan war, gracing the front pages of more than 100 newspapers around the globe. Tomasevic's raw pictures of rebel fighters battling pro-Assad forces among the ruins of Aleppo and Damascus have won international acclaim, as did his coverage of the bloody siege on a Nairobi shopping mall in Kenya, where Tomasevic is now based. Tomasevic's work has been recognised with many prestigious international awards. He has been named Reuters Photographer of the Year a record four times (2003, 2005, 2011 and 2013) and won the Reuters Photograph of the Year award in 2008. In 2014, he was awarded first prize in the \"Spot News Stories\" category at the World Press Photo and second and third prize at \"News Picture Story\" at POYi. He has won China International Press Photo of the Year in 2011 and he has been awarded for a spot news in 2004 and 2012. In 2009 he won the SOPA Award of Excellence for News Photography. In 2012 Tomasevic won the London Frontline Club Award and in 2013 the Days Japan award. In 2005 he got the National Press Photographers Association Best of Photo journalism in the Portrait and Personality category and third place for news in 2011. In 2014 he was nominated for the Pulitzer Prize for Spot News Photography. The Guardian 's photo team chose Goran Tomasevic as their agency photographer of the year for 2013. A gallery in Prague in 2012 held a six-week exhibition of Tomasevic's war photography, depicting more than two decades of conflict. Tomasevic is now Chief Photographer for Reuters in east Africa, based in Nairobi."

Son of a French Army officer, Roux moved with his family to the Middle East at the age of nine where he subsequently lived for 12 years in Syria and Lebanon before returning to France in 1935. Roux was educated by Jesuits in Beirut and studied medicine at the University of Paris, where he graduated in medicine in 1941 and later studied Oriental studies at École pratique des hautes études. In 1950 Roux became a medical officer for the Iraq Petroleum Company (IPC) as a medical officer, spending his first two years in Qatar and the remainder in Iraq. During his time with the IPC the company produced the magazines Iraq Petroleum and The Crescent, and Roux was commissioned to produce articles. Through the duration of 1956-1960, Roux published a series of articles, The Story of Ancient Iraq. They form the basis of his later books. After the 14 July Revolution of Iraq in 1958, Roux returned to Europe and headed the International medical department at GlaxoWellcome, retiring in 1980. In 1964, he published in English Ancient Iraq, a book covering the political, cultural, and socioeconomic history of Mesopotamia. In 1985 he published a fuller French work, La Mésopotamie, but the English book's third edition, of 1992, has further enhancements."

  "text" : "Girolamo Segato (13 June 1792 – 3 February 1836) was an Italian naturalist, cartographer, Egyptologist, and anatomist. He is perhaps best known for his work in the artificial petrifaction of human cadavers. Segato was born in the Carthusian monastery of Vedana. As a child, Segato learned basic sciences from Antonio Bagini, a Sospirolo priest. After studying under Bagini, Segato spent a short time as an accountant in Treviso before returning to secondary schooling in Belluno, where his teacher was Tomaso Antonio Catullo. From 1818 onwards Segato participated in several archaeological expeditions to Egypt, where he became an expert in the techniques of mummification; however, most of his studies undertaken during these trips were lost. Upon his return to Florence in 1823, Segato developed a technique similar to mummification, but unique: rather than simply removing water from cadavers, Segato's method consisted of what appears to be mineralization or \"petrification\". Word soon spread that Segato had acquired knowledge of Egyptian magic. Hampered by the society of his time, he was prompted to destroy all his notes before his death. Segato took to the grave the secret of the technique he developed, which, despite numerous studies and attempts to imitate, remains mysterious. It is said that, on his death, he would reveal his secret to his friend Pellegrini (nicknamed Pellegro), but he died prematurely. He died in 1836, and was buried in the Basilica of Santa Croce. Today, many of Segato's surviving petrified human remains can be found in the Museum of the Department of Anatomy in Florence."

  "text" : "George H. Richmond (1944–2004) was an American educator who introduced the concept of the MicroSociety to American primary education. Richmond was a painter as well as an educator. He was raised by a single mother in Manhattan's Lower East Side. He started teaching at a Brooklyn elementary school in 1967, and was a Yale graduate. As a rookie teacher, he coined the term \"microsociety,\" and created the first microsociety in his classroom in 1967 to combat students' lack of interest in the learning curriculum. A microsociety learning environment enables students to apply classroom knowledge to real world settings, for example, starting a business, making laws, and paying bills, etc. Richmond was invited to attend Harvard for his doctorate. His thesis, The MicroSociety School: A Real World in Miniature was published by Harpers & Row in 1973. In 1984, Richmond met his wife Carolynn King, a Harvard and Villanova graduate with advanced degrees in education and law. She researched and found microsocieties were operating in various schools across the country. Richmond and King continued to develop the model and sought grant opportunities to support their efforts. George Richmond fell ill with Parkinson's disease. Carolynn King Richmond left her law practice to run The MicroSociety School Consortium in 1991, and together they wrote and published the 500 page MicroSociety Handbook. George Richmond continued to write and paint despite the progression of Parkinson's Disease, and in 2004 published a collection of poetry illustrated with his paintings, entitled, The Economics of Love. In 2004 George Richmond died of complications from cancer."

  "text" : "George Cuitt the Elder (1743–1818) was an English painter. Cuitt was born at Moulton, in Yorkshire, and having shown a natural taste for drawing and design was sent to Italy at the expense of Sir Lawrence Dundas, whose family had already been painted by him. He studied earnestly for six years at Rome, and also pursued landscape painting, a branch of art that was more congenial to his tastes. He returned to England in 1775, and in 1776 he exhibited at the Royal Academy 'The Infant Jupiter fed with goat's milk and honey.' He afterwards exhibited portraits and landscapes, his last contribution being in 1798. Owing to frequent attacks of low fever he was unable to reside in London, and he finally settled at Richmond in Yorkshire. Here he found constant employment in the commissions given hira by gentlemen whose parks and residences were in his neighbourhood. His death occurred in 1818. His portraits are elaborately finished, although very thinly painted, whilst his earlier landscapes show much ability and feeling in their execution."

  "text" : "George Cuitt the Younger, the only son of the painter of the same names, was born at Richmond, in Yorkshire, in 1779. He followed his father's profession from his youth, and added to it the art of etching, which he developed with great success, being induced to do so by a careful study of Piranesi's 'Roman Antiquities.' He went to Chester, where he became a teacher of drawing, and published, in 1810 and 1811, 'Six Etchings of Saxon and other Buildings remaining at Chester,' 'Six Etchings of Old Buildings in Chester,' and 'Six Etchings of Picturesque Buildings in Chester,' and, in 1815, five etchings for a 'History of Chester.' About 1820, having realized a certain competence by his labours, he retired from the more active duties of his profession, and built himself a house at Masham, near Richmond, from whence he published his 'Yorkshire Abbeys,' and in 1848 his collected works, under the title of 'Wanderings and Pencillings amongst the Ruins of Olden Times.' These etchings exhibit considerable talent, verve, originality, and truth. His death occurred at Masham in 1854."

While he was working as a teacher in village Ganiapali around 1910, he came into contact with a local Kaviraja, a practitioner of Ayurvedic medicines and thus he began his long innings in Ayurveda. He was an active member of Indian National Congress till India achieved independence. In 1921 he attended the All India Congress Committee Meeting at Ahmedabad as a representative of the Sambalpur District Congress Committee. After returning from Ahmedabad he devoted his time and energy to enrolling people as primary members of the Congress party, particularly in the eastern part of the then Sambalpur district and in Sonepur and Birmaharajpur area of Bolangir. This was the most hectic period in his life when he walked from village to village explaining to the people the message of Gandhiji and of the Congress. Though the students of Zilla School were the first to adopt the non-co-operation movement in Orissa by abstaining form their classes, he was one of the first individuals to take the lead in organizing the movements in the rural areas of Sambalpur with the help of other volunteers. Ghanashyam Panigrahi also played an important role in the establishment of the National School at Sambalpur in 1921 for imparting training to the congress volunteers to enable them to effectively participate in the freedom struggle."

  "text" : "George Grey Armstrong (1877–1961) was a noted player, teacher and maker of the Northumbrian smallpipes. He also composed several tunes for the instrument. He lived in Hexham, Northumberland. He learned to play the instrument from the Clough family, and studied pipemaking with John E. Baty. There is a photograph of him with his pipes, from the Cocks collection, at. He taught 36 pupils, including Joe Hutton, Tommy Breckons and Colin Caisley, and passed on his pipemaking skills to William Cocks. Some of his teaching was for Scout troops - the Northumbrian Pipers' Society led a move to introduce the instrument among Scouts in Northumberland between the wars. From the playing of these and other pupils, it is clear that Armstrong must have been not only a fine piper but an excellent teacher. Tommy Breckons recalled learning first from Armstrong, and later from Tom Clough: Now as to the difference between Tom and George. Tom wouldn't have been much use to a novice piper.... But George had a gift for teaching a novice. He could show you how to do things. I don't quite know how he did it!. He was widely respected as a pipemaker and repairer, in collaboration with his brother-in-law John MacCalman; the wood and metal parts were turned and shaped by MacCalman, while Armstrong's part of the work was to assemble the parts, fit the stoppers, tune the chanters, pad the keys, and reed the pipes.  In 1936 he repaired an old James Reid set for Joe Hutton to learn on, and subsequently made two complete sets for him, in 1938 and 1943. He also repaired and re-reeded pipes for Billy Pigg and others. He was married to Ella, the sister of William Cocks, the noted pipe-maker and collector. His own 17-key set of pipes, a family heirloom, made by James Reid, is now in the Morpeth Chantry Bagpipe Museum. He used this as the model for the 17-key chanters he made himself."

A humanist reformer, he was imprisoned in the Tower of London in 1556 by Elizabeth's sister, Mary I. Suspected of sedition, he was tortured so severely that he was left permanently lame.  Later, he carried Elizabeth's letters when she herself was imprisoned in the Tower. Castiglione was born at Gassino, near Torino, in the Piedmont, son of Captain Piero Castiglione, of Mantua; he served in the Army of Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor, at Landrecies and Boulogne. He was appointed to young Elizabeth's Court as Master of the Italian Tongue in November 1544, and when Elizabeth became Queen he was made Groom of her Privy Chamber, which post he held until shortly before his death. He was granted by her the Manor of Benham Valence, in Berkshire and he was buried in the nearby church of St Mary, Speen. He married, in London in 1558, Margaret Allen, widow of Lazarus Allen and the illegitimate daughter of expatriate Florentine Merchant Bartolomeo Compagni (1503–1561), and they had a large family. One son, Sir Francis Castilion (1561-1638) became a pensioner of James I and a Member of Parliament for Great Bedwyn."

In 1761, Smethurst travelled to Chaleur Bay to trade with the French and natives under a license from the military governor of Quebec, James Murray. Smethurst was abandoned by a captain in the employ of Roderick Mackenzie, and so was forced to make his way to Fort Cumberland in the month of November, without food or shelter. Smethurst returned to Marblehead by way of Halifax but, in 1763, received a land grant in Cumberland County. He served as customs comptroller and deputy surveyor of woods. Not long after his term in the Nova Scotia assembly, he moved to London, England.> In 1774, he published A narrative of an extraordinary escape: out of the hands of the Indians, in the Gulph of St. Lawrence describing his earlier voyage to Chaleur Bay."

George Wallace Milias (September 20, 1925 – October 1, 1977) was a Republican California State Assemblyman, who represented the 22nd Assembly District from 1962 to 1970. Born in Gilroy, California, Milias earned his B.A. with a double major in History and Political Science from San Jose State College and earned his A.M. in California Political History from Stanford University. Milias served as a member of the Santa Clara County Planning Commission from 1958 to 1962, serving as its Vice Chair in 1961 and Chair in 1962. He also served on the Santa Clara County Grand Jury from 1954 to 1956, serving as Foreman in 1956. In Republican politics, Milias served as President of the California Republican Assembly from 1957 to 1958 and Chairman of the California Republican Party from 1958 to 1960. He also served as Vice Chairman of the California delegation to the 1960 Republican National Convention that nominated California Republican Richard Nixon for President of the United States. He was also a delegate to the 1968 Convention that again nominated Nixon for President. In 1960, Milias was named to the National Young Republican Hall of Fame. Elected to the Assembly in 1962, Milias served as Vice Chair of the Fish and Game Committee and of the Conservation and Wildlife Committees during his entire legislative tenure. He also served as Chairman of the Natural Resources and Conservation Committee and a member of the Elections and Constitutional Amendments Committee and the Government Administration Committee. Instead of seeking a fifth term in the Assembly in 1970, Milias sought the Republican nomination for California Secretary of State but lost the nomination to James L. Flournoy, the first African American nominated for partisan statewide office in California, though Flournoy went on to lose the general election to future Governor Jerry Brown, the son of former Governor Pat Brown. In the 1974 election, Milias was the Republican nominee for California's 13th congressional district but was defeated by San Jose Mayor Norman Mineta. Wallace was Milias's mother's maiden name. Milias married Mary Ann in 1962."

  "text" : "Guy Braunstein (born on 1971) is a classical violinist. Born in Tel Aviv, Israel, he began to study the violin at age seven. In Israel he studied under the guidance of Haim Taub and in the United States under the guidance of Glenn Dicterow and Pinchas Zukerman. Braunstein developed a solo and chamber music career. He performed as a soloist with leading orchestras around the world and played in many chamber music groups such as the Huberman Quartet. In 2000 Braunstein was appointed as the concertmaster of the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra. Before receiving this position Braunstein played only as a soloist and as a chamber music violinist, and never played in an orchestra. However, the orchestra members unanimously elected him as the Concertmaster. In 2003 Braunstein became professor of music at the Berlin University of the Arts (UDK) and taught there until 2007. Braunstein reestablished the Rolandseck Festival in Germany which was closed several years before. As of April 2011, he is the Music Director of the festival. Braunstein has appeared in various music festivals worldwide, including Chamber Music Festival in Jerusalem founded by Elena Bashkirova in 2009. In 2013, Braunstein left the Berlin Philharmonic in order to concentrate on a solo career."

  "text" : "George Graham (c1947-21 February 2012) was a Northern Ireland politician and estate agent who was most prominent during his time with the Democratic Unionist Party. Graham was co-opted onto Newry and Mourne District Council in 1975, becoming that body's first DUP member and in 1982 he was elected council chairman by the controlling Social Democratic and Labour Party. He was elected to the Northern Ireland Assembly at the 1982 election to represent South Down and remained a member until the Assembly shut down in 1986, serving as a member of the Agriculture, Finance and Personnel and Health and Social Services committees. Graham came to attention in the summer of 1985 when, in response to a call from local DUP councillor Ethyl Smyth, he accompanied Rev. Ivan Foster and a group from the Third Force to join a banned loyalist parade attempting to march through the village of Castlewellan. The loyalists clashed with the Royal Ulster Constabulary although the ban was upheld and both Graham and Foster were arrested for their involvement. Graham ran afoul of the DUP leadership in 1987 when he continued to attend council meetings despite the party having adopted a policy of abstentionism in response to the Anglo-Irish Agreement. Representing his hometown of Kilkeel, he reasoned that he was of more value opposing the Agreement from within the council rather than following the party policy, which he felt was not an effective protest. He finally left the DUP in January 1989 and was re-elected in May under the label \"Protestant\". He resigned his council seat in 1991. Graham would later join the Progressive Unionist Party and unsuccessfully ran in South Down as their lead candidate in the 1996 Forum election. He subsequently ran in the 1998 Assembly election in South Down as an independent Unionist but he was eliminated on the first count. He died on 21 February 2012 after succumbing to an illness in hospital.He had been in failing health for a number of years."

The Kohut School moved to Harrison, NY in the 1920s, and continued there until 1960, when it closed. Kohut established a library of Judaica at Yale in 1915, an important collection made by his father, Alexander Kohut, and the \"Kohut Endowment\" to maintain and improve the \"Alexander Kohut Memorial Collection\"."

  "text" : "Genevieve Hughes Houghton (\"HOW-ton\") (1932–2012) is known as one of three women participants in the original 13-person Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) Freedom Rides. She grew up in the upper-middle-class suburban community of Chevy Chase, Maryland. Hughes studied at Cornell University and, upon her graduation, moved to New York City to work as a stockbroker. In the late 1950s she became involved in the New York chapter of CORE, and she organized a boycott of dime stores that worked with chain restaurants that resisted the sit-in movements in the South. Hughes started to become ostracized from her colleagues on Wall Street, and she decided to work full time to end racism. In fall of 1960 she took the position as CORE's field secretary and, in doing so, she was the first woman to serve on CORE's Field Staff. John Lewis spoke of her, \"as graceful and gentle as her name\" but, \"not at all afraid to speak up when she had strong feelings about something.\" When explaining her decision to join the Freedom Rides she said, \"I figured Southern women should be represented so the South and the nation would realize all Southern people do not think alike.\" During the journey from Washington, DC, to New Orleans, she and the other Freedom Riders encountered many acts of violence towards them, particularly in Anniston, Alabama, where their Greyhound bus was engulfed in flames by angry mobs. She recounts her experience in the Anniston hospital: \"There was no doctor at the hospital, only a nurse. They had me breathe pure oxygen but that only burned my throat and did not relieve the coughing. I was burning hot and my clothes were a wet mess. After awhile [sic] Ed and Bert were brought in, choking. We all lay on our beds and coughed. Finally, a woman doctor came in—she had to look up smoke poisoning before treating us. They brought in the Negro man who had been in the back of the bus with me. I pointed to him and told them to take care of him. But they did not bring him into our emergency room. I understand that they did not do anything at all for Hank. Thirteen in all were brought in, and three were admitted: Ed, the Negro man and myself. They gave me a room and I slept. When I woke up the nurse asked me if I could talk with the FBI. The FBI did not care about us, but only the bombing.\" After her experience as a Freedom Rider she married John Houghton. The marriage ended in divorce. She continued to be active in movements for social justice, environmental protection, and world peace. In 1972 she was a co-founder and first director of the Women's Center in Carbondale, Illinois, one of the first shelters for women victims of domestic violence in the United States."

  "text" : "Gerhard Borrmann (April 30, 1908 – April 12, 2006) was a German physicist. He was born in Diedenhofen, then part of Germany, and received his early education there. He continued his secondary school at Gießen, where he apprenticed at a steel mill. After studying at the Technische Universität München and Technische Hochschule Danzig, he wrote his Ph.D. thesis on the Kossel effect while working at the laboratory of Walther Kossel in Danzig. Following his doctorate, he continued to work at the laboratory as an assistant to Kossel, where he studied X-ray transmission through thin crystal foils. Due to his refusal to join the Nazi Party he was forced to leave laboratory in 1938, upon which he went to work with Max von Laue at the Kaiser-Wilhelm-Institut für Physikalische Chemie und Elektrochemie (KWI). There he discovered a phenomenon regarding the anomalous low absorption of X-rays that became known as the \"Borrmann effect\" (or \"Borrmann-Campbell effect\", for Herbert N. Campbell.) Following the war, in 1951 Bormann was offered the Kristalloptik der Röntgenstrahlen department of the KWI. He became a Scientific Fellow in 1956. He was appointed Professor at the Technische Universität Berlin, retiring in 1970. In 1996, the Deutsche Gesellschaft für Kristallographie honored Gerhard Borrmann pioneering work in X-ray diffraction with the first Carl-Hermann Medal."

  "text" : "Gihan Ibrahim (Egyptian Arabic: چيهان إبراهيم‎‎, IPA: [ʒiˈhæːn ebɾɑˈhiːm]), nicknamed Gigi (چيچى, [ˈʒiːʒi]), is an Egyptian journalist, blogger and socialist activist. She has been credited as being a part of a new generation of \"citizen journalists\" who document news events using social media. For this she was featured on a cover of Time magazine as \"one of the leaders\" of Tahrir Square during the Egyptian Revolution of 2011. Ibrahim however states, that while the internet was important for coordinating people in the ousting of president Hosni Mubarak, \"it was the battles on the streets that were crucial ... [i]t was their power that made the revolution.\" She is a graduate from the American University in Cairo where she earned a political science degree. Gigi also attended Orange Coast College in California. Prior to university, Gigi has had no direct links to the workers protests and opposition movements that had previously been occurring in Egypt. It was a lecture on \"Social Mobilization under Authoritarian Regimes\", where Hossam el-Hamalawy was a guest speaker, that provided her with insight about activism in Egypt. The contact with el-Hamalawy, a member of the Revolutionary Socialists, led her to decide to join the movement. Aside from Time, she has also appeared in Frontline, BBC, Al Jazeera and The Daily Show. Gigi was featured in a documentary by award-winning journalist Inigo Gilmore. This production, following her from the earliest days of the revolution, looks at her life not just in Tahrir Square, but also at home, commenting on the reserved view many upper middle class Egyptians initially took against the revolution. The documentary \"Gigi's revolution\" was aired on the PBS Network in the USA. She is critical of other Egyptian youth activists such as Wael Ghonim, who called on protesters to go home after Mubarak had ceded some power but refused to step down as president."

  "text" : "George Brightman (July 3, 1746 – April 21, 1786) was a political figure in Nova Scotia. He represented Hants County in the Legislative Assembly of Nova Scotia from 1783 to 1785. He was born in Dartmouth, Massachusetts, the son of Thomas Brighton and Judith Manchester. Brightman firstly married Hannah Baker, who died before 1764 and secondly Hannah Bailey. There were seven children in the second marriage and one in the first. He came from Rhode Island to settle in Newport township and was an original grantee for the Crown grant of 21 July 1761. Brightman served as a justice of the peace for Hants County. He was elected to the assembly in a 1783 by-election, the first election for Hants County. He died at the age of 39. The draw for individual lands on the 18th of February 1762, which divided the Crown grant of the previous year saw George Brightman as well as Aaron Butts jointly drawing Newport Farm (lot B, 1st Division No. 1). In Duncanson's history of Newport NS, he indicates that \"at the time of his death George Brightman owned considerable Newport property; he had sold half of Farm Lot B 1st Division No. 1 to John Chambers (site of the Old Stone House in Poplar Grove)\". This stone house became of interest in 2012 when it was revealed that it was for sale for $2 million by owner Sherman Hines, who bought the house in a state of ruin in 1982 for $15,000 and had spent 30 years restoring the property. The estate includes over 100 acres and 7 buildings including the Acadian Stone House also known as The Mission. Hines indicated to the CBC television that he has traced the construction back to 1699, and that it was built by the French as a mission and a fortification against the English after searching old maps and books. \"As far as I can find in any research I have done, it is the oldest building east of Quebec City,\" he said."

  "text" : "Geoff R. Feehan (born 19 January 1935) is a former Australian rules footballer who played with St Kilda in the Victorian Football League (VFL) and Norwood in the South Australian National Football League (SANFL). Originally from Wodonga, Feehan also played for Melbourne club Elwood before joining St Kilda. During his career, Feehan was mostly used either as a defender or ruckman. He played all 18 games for St Kilda in the 1957 VFL season and added another 26 over the next two years. He joined Norwood in 1960, who was also signed Alan Killigrew, his coach from St Kilda. In four seasons at Norwood, Feehan played in two SANFL grand finals. He was one of his club's best performers in the 1960 Grand Final, which they lost by five points and again suffered disappointment in 1961 when North Adelaide were too strong."

  "text" : "George H. Robertson (1884 – July 3, 1955) was an American race car driver. His father ran one of New York's first big garages and George grew up surrounded by Mors, Panhards and other cars. He raced a Christie, a Hotchkiss, and a Simplex, as well as a Locomobile with which he won the 1908 Vanderbilt Cup. This victory was the first in the Cup by an American driver in an American car. This car was the legendary \"Old No. 16\". In 1910, he was the captain of the Benz team but was injured while showing a newspaper reporter the course and was forced to retire from driving. In 1921, he served as Duesenberg's team manager in their victory in the French Grand Prix. The team featured Americans Jimmy Murphy and Joe Boyer with Frenchman Albert Guyot. He later was the vice president and general manager of Roosevelt Raceway, host to the George Vanderbilt Cup in 1936 and 1937. In 1951, racing historian Russ Catlin officially revised AAA records with championship results based on all AAA races from 1902–1915 and 1917–1919. This had the effect of changing the 1909 champion from Bert Dingley to George Robertson."

He played in three first-class matches without making much impact, but one of his games was a remarkable victory for Somerset over a strong Yorkshire side in July 1901, in which Somerset trailed by 238 on the first innings but then made 630 in the second innings to win the match by 279 runs; Burrington contributed 11 to the first innings of 87 and 15, his highest first-class score, to the 630.

She converted to Catholicism in 1940, but on May 27, 1942 she was placed in a transport to the Maly Trostenets extermination camp in Belorussia where she was murdered on June 1, 1942."

She was remembered for her style and moderation. In retirement she turned to teaching. Her students included the Danish baritone Frantz Rabinowitz (1918–1948). In 1943, when Italy came under Nazi occupation and Jews were being hunted, Finzi-Magrini who was of Jewish origin went into hiding under a false name. In 1944 a young nephew was deported to a concentration camp, causing a heart attack that left her mute and paralyzed. She died six weeks later from wounds received in an American air-raid on Desio."

  "text" : "Gandolfino d'Asti (before 1493 – after 1518) was an Italian painter, who was active in Piedmont during the early Renaissance. He worked between Asti, Alessandria and Montferrat. He was born at Asti and apprenticed under his father, Giovanni da Roreto, but no works are known from that period. His first documented work is and Assumption with Saints now at the Galleria Sabauda, Turin (1493). His style was influenced by that of Ligurian and Provençal artists, such as Ludovico Brea. Later he was also influenced by Milanese painters such as Bergognone and Bernardino Zenale. Works by his workshop in Asti include the Pelletta Polyptych in the Cathedral, and Adoration of the Magi in the Collegiata of San Secondo and Madonna Enthroned with Saints in church of Santa Maria Nuova. Outside his native city, he painted works such as the St. Peter's Polyptych in Savigliano and a Holy Parents in the Turin City Museum of Ancient Art. (c. 1503)."

  "text" : "Graham Ion (born 12 October 1940) is a former Australian rules footballer who played with Footscray in the Victorian Football League (VFL). Ion made his league debut at just 17 years of age, against Melbourne at Western Oval in 1958. It was his only game of the season, but he was a regular member of the team from 1959. A key forward despite his small stature, he kicked 27 goals in 1961 to finish third in Footscray's goal-kicking. He played all 21 games that year, including the 1961 VFL Grand Final loss, where he played at centre half-forward. When Ted Whitten was away playing interstate football, Ion captained Footscray in their round 13 fixture against North Melbourne - he was only 20 years old at the time. His brother, Barry Ion, was also in the Footscray side that day. In 1962 he again played every game for Footscray, and also kicked three goals in an appearance for the VFL representative team which defeated Western Australia. He played 14 games in 1963, but just nine the following season as he was out of action for eight weeks due to an appendix operation. His final season, in 1965, was interrupted by a four-week suspension for striking Geelong's Ian Scott, but they were the only games he missed that year. After leaving Footscray he became a captain-coach and was involved with various clubs in the Riverina, including Deniliquin and Turvey Park."

  "text" : "Gordon Bryant Ogilvie, ONZM (born 8 May 1934) is a New Zealand historian and biographer who has written over 20 books, mainly about the people, places and institutions of the Canterbury region. He played a considerable role in uncovering the exploits of pioneer aviator Richard Pearse and popularising these for the first time through his 1973 work The Riddle of Richard Pearse. His other major biography, Denis Glover : His Life (1999), is the first full account of this significant figure in New Zealand literature. Born in Christchurch, Ogilvie grew up at Horotane Valley where his father was an orchardist. He was educated at St Andrew's College, Canterbury University and Victoria University. After completing a diploma in post-primary teaching he eventually returned to St Andrew's College as head of English, a position he held for 24 years. He retired from teaching in 1993 to take up writing full-time. His late wife Elisabeth (1934–2011) was the author of another Canterbury regional history, Purau (1970). His output includes three biographies, a range of regional, church, club, school, family and business histories, contributions to the Dictionary of New Zealand Biography and Historic Buildings of New Zealand : South Island (1983), innumerable feature articles and reviews as well as two guide books. The Port Hills of Christchurch (1978) and Banks Peninsula: Cradle of Canterbury (1990) both won the J. M. Sherrard Award for New Zealand Regional History and have been republished in revised editions. The Riddle of Richard Pearse (1973) and Denis Glover : His Life (1999) were New Zealand Book of the Year finalists."

  "text" : "Gaius (or Caius) Fabius Pictor made some of the earliest Roman paintings that have survived. At least some of his works were painted in 304 BC. No tradition of Roman painting exists earlier than the time of Fabius, nor does his example appear to have been followed by any of his contemporaries; for an interval of nearly a hundred and fifty years occurs before any mention is made of another Roman painter. Fabius, called Pictor, a Roman artist, descended from the celebrated family of the Fabii, painted principally at Rome. Pictor was the grandfather of the Roman historian Quintus Fabius Pictor. In 304 BC, Pictor decorated the Temple of Salus on the Quirinal Hill, with a representation (presumably) of the battle gained by Bubulus over the Samnites. His paintings were preserved until the reign of the Emperor Gaius, when the temple was destroyed by fire. They were probably held in little estimation, as Pliny, to whom they must have been known, neither acquaints us with the subjects, nor commends the execution. The art of painting in its rude and early forms was general in Italy, but was founded on the Etruscan style, which never advanced beyond a flat polychromatic treatment. In regards to the fine arts, Rome owes all to Greece, but in painting never acquired the individuality in which it did in the other arts. Painting was then little respected by the Romans, and that the title of Pictor was not considered as an honourable distinction, but rather intended to stigmatize the illustrious character who had degraded his dignity by the practice of an art which was held in no consideration, may be inferred from a passage of Cicero, in the first book of his Tusculan Disputations: \"An censemus si Fabio nobilissimo homini laudatum esset quod pingeret, non multos etiam apud nos Polycletos et Parrhasios fuisse.\""

  "text" : "Galeazzo Malatesta (1385–1461) was an Italian condottiero and lord of Pesaro and Fossombrone. He was the elder son of Malatesta IV Malatesta and Elisabetta da Varano. In 1405 he married Battista da Montefeltro. He was nicknamed \"the inept\" due to his lack of courage and, differently from most of the male members of the family, he did not prove skilled in the art of war. In 1413, together with his father, he took part in the failed attack to Capodimonte, near Ancona. In 1416 he was at the battle of Sant'Egidio, collaborating with his cousin Carlo I Malatesta. They were both taken as prisoners. Freed, Galeazzo followed his cousin in other battles until 1429, the year of the death of both his father's and Carlo I's deaths. Galeazzo subsequently became lord of Pesaro. In 1430 he supported a rebellion against his kinsman, Sigismondo Pandolfo Malatesta. In 1431 he was ousted from Pesaro together with his brother Carlo, due to his poor government, and took refuge in Venice. After a series of battles against the Papal States, he was able to return in Pesaro in 1433. In 1433 he hired Federico III da Montefeltro to defend Pesaro and Fossombrone against his cousin Sigismondo Pandolfo from Rimini. Although he was able to keep his territories, and overwhelmed by the debts made to hire other condottieri, in 1444 he sold Pesaro to Alessandro Sforza in exchange of 20,000 florins. Two years later he gave Fossombrone to Federico da Montefeltro, for 13,000 florins. This caused the Pope to excommunicate him, since he had sold two towns which were nominally under papal rule. In 1448 he made peace with his cousins, Sigismondo Pandolfo and Domenico Malatesta, who pushed him to attack Pesaro. However, Galeazzo's attempt was thwarted by the intervention of Florence. He later lived in Florence, where he died in 1461."

  "text" : "Gustav Steinhauer was born in Berlin c. 1870. He was an officer of the Imperial German Navy who in 1901 became head of the British section of the German Admiralty's intelligence service, the Nachrichten-Abteilung, 'N'. He had trained at the Pinkerton Detective Agency in Chicago and spoke fluent English with an American accent. Steinhauer had been part of Kaiser Wilhelm II's bodyguard at the funeral of Queen Victoria in 1901. During the visit Steinhauer foiled an assassination attempt by a group of Russian anarchists on the Kaiser's life, working alongside British detective and spymaster William Melville. Steinhauer was responsible for the creation of a network of German spies in Britain in the period before the war. Steinhauer had mostly recruited his agents through writing to German businessmen resident in the UK inviting them to work for him. Mi5 soon clocked onto this activity and began intercepting the correspondence between Steinhauer and his agents, between 1911 and 1914 Mi5 intercepted 1189 letters relating to such German espionage. In late July, the week before the declaration of the First World War, Steinhauer toured Britain under the alias 'Fritsches' to make contact with elements of his agent network, although Mi5 knew he was present in the country they did not have the resources to mount sufficient surveillance to apprehend him. Vernon Kell, head of Mi5, claimed to have ordered the arrest of 22 of Steinhauer's agent ring at the outset of war, leaving no significant German spies in Great Britain; but modern research has exploded this claim, which appears to have been made to promote the hasty passage of the Alien Restriction Act of August 1914. Steinhauer later recalled the Kaiser's fury at the seeming obliteration of German surveillance of the British Navy screaming 'Am I surrounded by dolts? Who is responsible? Why was I not told!?'"

He earned a degree in Journalism at the University of Buenos Aires, and in 1955, was hired by the Uruguayan weekly journal, Marcha, as its chief Argentine correspondent. That year, he published his first book, a biography on Nicaraguan nationalist Augusto Sandino. He returned to Buenos Aires in 1956, and joined the editorial board of La Prensa. Selser joined the IPS news agency in 1964. He and his family left Argentina following the March 1976 coup, and was hired as researcher by the Latin American Institute of Latin American Studies (ILET). His three daughters, Irene, Gabriela and Claudia Selser, each became journalists in their own right. Selser was recognized by critics as \"a Latin Americanist committed to freedom and justice.\" His books covered a wide array of contentious Latin American issues and events, including the 1903 Separation of Panama from Colombia, the installation of the Somoza dynasty in Nicaragua, the 1954 Guatemalan coup d'état, the Alliance for Progress, the 1964 overthrow of Dominican Republic President Juan Bosch and the subsequent U.S. occupation, the 1973 coup in Chile, psy-ops carried out in Latin America, the 1980 Cocaine Coup in Bolivia, the Salvadoran Civil War, the 1989 Operation Just Cause, and other topics. Selser would be afflicted with a terminal illness, and he committed suicide in Mexico City in 1991."

He knew and championed Monet, whom he met in 1886 in Belle-Île-en-Mer while travelling for research on prisons of the Second Empire. Monet introduced him to Cézanne, who painted his portrait in 1895. He contributed to the newspaper La Justice from 15 January 1880, and came to know its founder, Georges Clemenceau, who in 1908 appointed him director of the Gobelins tapestry factory, a position he held until his death. Geffroy was born and died in Paris, and is interred at the Cimetière de Montrouge. A street in Paris's 13th arrondissement, close to the Gobelins Manufactory, bears his name."

He was a fugitive since 2002 wanted for Mafia association, robbery, fencing, money laundering and other crimes. He was put on Italy's most wanted list in March 2011. On May 25, 2011, the Italian police arrested him in a villa in Varcaturo, 19 miles northwest of Napoli. He was allied with the Mallardo clan and Contini clan and one of the leaders of the Secondigliano Alliance (Alleanza di Secondigliano), a coalition of powerful Camorra clans which controls drug trafficking and the extortion rackets in many suburbs of Naples that was formed at the end of the 1980s and controlled much of Naples for ten years. He worked in the shadows, according to several Camorra turncoats. The pentito Salvatore Giuliano said Dell’Aquila was the armed wing of the Contini and Mallardo clans. \"He is a ferocious killer of Mallardo, on behalf of whom he committed a hundred murders,\" according to Giuliano. He has not been charged with any homicide, however. He is active as a money launderer for the proceeds of drug trafficking and extortion."

He is best known by his sobriquet, Papa-Anypomonos (Παπα-Ανυπόμονος, \"Father Impatient\"). He was born Georgios Dimakos in 1912, in the village of Agrydaki in Gortynia. He was ordained a deacon on 29 July 1934, adopting the name Germanos. In 1940, when Greece entered World War II, he was the hegumenos of the Agathonos Monastery near Ypati in Phthiotis. After the start of the Axis Occupation of Greece, he became a member of the Communist-sponsored National Liberation Front (EAM), and served as chairman of the community of Dadi. On 14 May 1943 at the village of Koukouvista he met Aris Velouchiotis, the chief captain of ELAS, EAM's guerrilla wing. Henceforth Dimakos became a close associate of Velouchiotis, following him in his tours around Greece. His bravery and zeal earned him the sobriquet Papa-Anypomonos from Velouchiotis himself. Following the Varkiza agreement of 1945 and the disbandment of ELAS, he returned to the Agathonos Monastery. In 1946, during the \"White Terror\" preceding the outbreak of the Greek Civil War, he was kidnapped and tortured by a right-wing band. The Regime of the Colonels also persecuted him as a communist sympathizer, and sent him before the Synodical Court in 1968, where he was acquitted. Only during the last years of his life was his role in the Resistance acknowledged and honoured by the Church of Greece. In 2010 the new park of Vytina was named after him."

  "text" : "Gerard Vandergucht (or van der Gucht) (1696/97 – 18 March 1776) was an English engraver and art dealer. Vandergucht, born in London, the elder son of the Flemish engraver Michael Vandergucht. He was taught engraving by his father, as was his younger brother Jan Vandergucht (or John) (c.1699-c.1730). Gerard was also taught drawing by Louis Chéron, and studied at Godfrey Kneller's Great Queen Street Academy. He surpassed the restrained style of engraving favoured by his father, and became one of the leading engravers in London by adopting the French method of combining precise engraving with etched tones. In 1719, he was commissioned by James Thornhill to engrave four designs for the cupola of St Paul's Cathedral. He took over his father's house - the Golden Head in Queen Street, Bloomsbury - following his father's death in 1725. He married Mary Liney on 24 August, 1725. They had over 30 children, including the painter and picture dealer Benjamin Vandergucht. He became a leading publisher of engraved prints and book illustrations, and taught Robert White and Francis Patton. In 1735, he took a leading role in the artists' demands for copyright protection which led to an extension of the provisions established by William Hogarth in the Engraving Copyright Act 1734. The 1734 act only protected original designs. Vandergucht and his supporters successfully lobbied to extend copyright protection to cover all prints. He concentrated on art dealing in the last 16 years of his life, selling prints, drawings, paintings and statues. He was a member of the Society for the Encouragement of Arts, Manufactures, and Commerce. He moved to Vandyke's Head, Great Brook Street, in 1758, where he died in 1776."

  "text" : "Gillian Arnold is a Northern Irish born textile and print artist, now living in County Durham, England. She began and continues her own artistry with paintings made using her monotype technique, which she has developed over the past twenty years to print pressed flowers onto her textile canvasses. She is inspired by the natural wildlife around her, and often works with plants and flowers that are overlooked. She has expanded her design range to use this same technique to produce lampshades, jewellery, ceramics and glassware, including repeat pattern wallpaper and home furnishings. She moved from her home town of Carrickfergus in Northern Ireland to Liverpool to study Textiles at John Moores University, after which she moved to London in 1996 to study for a Masters Degree in Textiles at Chelsea College of Art. Arnold then stayed in London until 2012, working as a resident artist in a number of south-London schools, and as a freelance artist working on community projects such as creative workshops and theatre productions in youth groups. Arnold worked extensively with people in deprivation and addiction, the homeless and in church groups reaching out to people living on the very extreme margins of society. She also worked on a fair-trade initiative in Pirang, Gambia. The start of her business was prompted by her husband, Tim, when he asked, ‘I married an artist – when are you going to start doing your own work?’ \"I started doing printing, mosaic and sculpture workshops in London and would go around inner-city schools doing loads of different projects with kids. It was lovely but it was very hard work. My husband could see that I was really frustrated\" Despite being six months pregnant, Gillian immediately began to work on several different projects. \"[I was] sitting on my studio floor, creating new canvases, ceramics and jewelry, which later that month we began to sell at Greenwich Market, where we soon became regular traders.\" The business slowly began to take off in May 2012, with an expansion in premises and equipment. This was closely followed by trade shows and wholesale opportunities across the UK. Eventually, Tim quit his job as a theatre sound engineer in London and they both moved to Tim’s hometown of Bishop Auckland to set up their first studio. The studio is in a space bought by Auckland Castle to help the Pod project, a business accelerator hub which is devoted to helping and promoting businesses in the North East. Pod is part of the Auckland Castle Trust and has dedicated a gallery in Bishop Auckland to Northern artists who need a space to evolve and sell their artwork. Arnold is currently based at this studio in Bishop Auckland as part of the Auckland Castle Trust."

He was the second son of Guglielmo I da Verona, ruler of the southern third (\"triarchy\") of Euboea. According to earlier historians following K. Hopf, he succeeded to this position upon his father's death in 1263/6. He was also thought to have become Baron of Passavant and marshal in the Principality of Achaea from an hypothetical marriage to Margaret de Neuilly, because he was improperly called \"marshal\" in Sanudo's Istoria di Romania. These views have been challenged by Raymond-Joseph Loenertz in the 1960s. He married Catherine, a niece of William II of Villehardouin, with whom he had no known child. Guglielmo was killed in the Battle of Demetrias, which took place either in 1273 or in 1275."

Today nearly 20,000 people (predominately in Canada and the United States) can trace their ancestry to his lineage. The spelling of the surname has been modified by several branches of the family and currently includes Lozen, Lozon, Louzon, Lozo, Loso, and Lauson. He was born in the parish of Saint-Julien in the city of Caen, today the principal town in the department of Calvados, located at the confluence of the Orne and Odon Rivers File:LauzonCrest.png Le Grande Recrue originally left on the Saint-Nicolas de Nantes, under the command of Captain Pierre Lebesson. After 350 leagues at sea, it was necessary to turn back. Water seeped into the hold and threatened to spoil all the provisions. Paul de Chomedey (Maisonneuve) placed the passengers on an island before docking at Saint Nazaire. They had to find another ship, transport the baggage and the supplies, to replace that which was missing, and to feed all the passengers while waiting. This was at the expense of the Compagnie de Montreal. The replacement ship Sainte-Marguerite set sail on 20 July 1653 and arrived in Quebec on 22 September 1653. There was much illness aboard ship and eight passengers died at sea due to illness. Lauzon married Marie Archambault, daughter of Jacques Archambault and Françoise Toureau, on November 27, 1656 in Montréal. They had 13 children, 4 sons and 9 daughters."

  "text" : "Geoffrey Ridel, 1st Baron Ridel of Wittering (died 1120) was a landholder and royal justice during the reign of King Henry I of England. Ridel is mentioned in the 1086 Domesday Book as holding land in Norfolk, and is probably also the same Geoffrey who held land in Derbyshire in Domesday. The mention in the Norfolk section of Domesday notes that Ridel had journeyed with William Bigod, brother of Roger Bigod, back from Apulia. Ridel and William's arrival in England can be dated to between 1075 and 1086. Ridel may have been born in southern Italy or Sicily, as a Ridel family was well known there in the 11th and 12th centuries. Another Geoffrey Ridel (active between 1061 and 1084) was a supporter of Robert Guiscard and was appointed Duke of Gaeta. Other possibilities for his origin include the county of Perche, where a Geoffrey Ridel was a witness to a charter of the Count of Perche around 1080. Ridel married Geva, who is often stated to have been an illegitimate daughter of Hugh, Earl of Chester. However, there is no contemporary evidence stating that she was, and her illegitimacy is inferred from the fact that she did not inherit her father's lands. Ridel's lands were centered on Great Weldon in Northamptonshire, which had belonged to Robert de Buci in Domesday Book. Ridel first appears as a witness to Henry's documents in 1105. In 1106, Ridel served as a royal justice hearing a case concerning the rights of the Archbishop of York to the church at Ripon. Along with Ridel, Ralph Basset, Ranulf Meschin and Peter de Valognes served on the panel of judges. In 1111, Ridel was an advisor to Queen Matilda, who had been left as regent of England while Henry was in Normandy. The chronicler Henry of Huntingdon called Ridel \"justice of all England\", although this title was also given to Ralph Basset, Richard Basset, and Robert Bloet, and should not be equated to the title of Chief Justiciar. Instead, the phrase probably indicated that Ridel, along with the others, was a royal justice who had powers that were not restricted to any one part of England, but that extended over the entirety of the kingdom. Ridel died in 1120 in the shipwreck of the White Ship. His heiress was his daughter Matilda, who married Richard Basset. Ridel probably also had two other daughters, Mabel and another daughter who married William Blund. Mabel married Richard de St Medard. Geva survived Ridel and later founded the monastic house of Canwell Priory in Staffordshire. Ridel's brother, Matthew, was a monk of Mont Saint-Michel and was elected abbot of Peterborough Abbey in 1102 but died 21 October 1103. Ridel acquired the manor of Pytchley in Northamptonshire, which belonged to Peterborough, through the offices of his brother. After Matthew's death, the next abbot attempted to regain the manor, but Ridel successfully retain control, although he was required to pay rent for the property."

  "text" : "Gregor John Kennis (born 9 March 1974) played first-class and List A cricket for Surrey between 1994 and 1997 and for Somerset between 1998 and 2000. He was born at Yokohama, Japan. Kennis was a right-handed batsman who opened the innings in some matches, but in others batted as low as No 8 in the batting order. He also bowled four overs of right-arm off-spin in his first-class cricket career. He was an occasional first-class cricketer: one first-class match in each of his first three seasons from 1994 to 1996, all of them for Surrey, and then three in each of his final three first-class seasons, 1997 to 1999, the first of those seasons for Surrey, the final two for Somerset. His limited-overs cricket career was just as spasmodic: one match for Surrey in both 1994 and 1995; one match for Somerset in both 1999 and 2000. He was a more regular second eleven player for Surrey from 1993, and in 1998, he appeared for four different second teams in the Second Eleven Championship: Surrey, Worcestershire, Middlesex and Somerset. Kennis had limited success in both first-class and limited-overs cricket as a batsman until his very last first-class match. His highest score in his six games for Surrey was his 29 against Kent in 1995 and he did not reach double figures in List A cricket for Surrey. Playing for Somerset in 1998, he scored 49 in the match against Derbyshire, but made only 22 runs in five other innings that season. He was having no greater success in 1999 until picked for the match against the New Zealand touring team when, opening the innings, he made 175, hitting 35 fours. In the innings, however, Kennis injured his back and in the second innings he batted at No 9. He was unable to play again in the 1999 season and returned for only a single List A match in 2000 against the Zimbabweans, in which he made his highest limited-overs score of 27."

Finlayson was born at Thurso in 1790, was clerk to Dr. Somerville, chief of the army medical staff in Scotland, and afterwards to Dr. Farrel, chief of the army medical staff in Ceylon. He was then transferred to Bengal, and attached to the 8th Light Dragoons as assistant-surgeon in 1819. In 1821-2 he accompanied the Crawfurd trade mission to Siam (now Thailand) and Cochin China (now Viet Nam) as naturalist, returning with it to Calcutta in 1823. By this time his health was thoroughly broken. He died on the passage from Bengal to Scotland in August 1823. The journal which he had kept during the mission was edited, with a prefatory note on the author, by Sir Stamford Raffles, F.R.S., and published in 1826 under the title The Mission to Siam and Hue, the capital of Cochin China, in the years 1821-2, from the Journal of the late George Finlayson, Esq., The bird stripe-throated bulbul (Pycnonotus finlaysoni) is named in Finlayson's honor.

  "text" : "Georg Scheffers was a German mathematician specializing in differential geometry. He was born on November 21, 1866 in the village of Altendorf near Holzminden (today incorporated into Holzminden). Scheffers began his university career at the University of Leipzig where he studied with Felix Klein and Sophus Lie. Scheffers was a coauthor with Lie for three of the earliest expressions of Lie theory: \n*  Lectures on Differential equations with known Infinitesimal transformations (1893), \n*  Lectures on Continuous groups (1893), and \n*  Geometry of Contact Transformations (1896). All three are now available online through archive.org; see External links section below. In 1896 Scheffers became docent at the Technical University of Darmstadt, where he was raised to professor in 1900. From 1907 to 1935, when he retired, Scheffers was a professor at the Technical University of Berlin. In 1901–1902 he published a famous two-volume textbook entitled Anwendung der Differential- und Integralrechnung auf die Geometrie (application of differential and integral calculus to geometry). The first volume subtitled Einführung in die Theorie der Curven in der Ebene und in Raum was published in 1901 and dealt with curves. The second volume subtitled Einführung in die Theorie der Flächen (introduction to the theory of surfaces) was published in 1902. A second edition was published in 1910 (volume 2, 1913), and a third edition in 1922. In 1907 Scheffers published the first two volumes of his extensive revision and rewriting of Georg Bohlmann's 1897–1899 revision of Harnack's 1884 German translation of Serret's famous two-volume Cours de calcul différentiel et intégral, which was first published by Gauthier-Villars in 1868. In 1909 Scheffers published the third and last volume of his rewriting of Bohlman's version of Serret's two-volume work. For a new edition, Scheffers added an appendix with 46 pages of historical notes for the first and second volumes. Another very successful book was prepared for students of science and technology: Lehrbuch der Mathematik (textbook of mathematics). It provided an introduction to analytic geometry as well as calculus of derivatives and integrals. In 1958 this book was republished for the fourteenth time. Scheffers is known for an article on special transcendental curves (including W-curves) which appeared in the Enzyklopädie der mathematischen Wissenschaften in 1903: \"Besondere transzendenten Kurven\" (special transcendental curves). He wrote on translation surfaces for Acta Mathematica in 1904: \"Das Abel'sche und das Lie'sche Theorem über Translationsflächen\" (the theorem of Abel and Lie on translation surfaces). Other books written by Scheffers are Lehrbuch der darstellenden Geometrie (textbook on descriptive geometry) (1919), Allerhand aus der zeichnenden Geometrie (1930), and Wie findet und zeichnet man Gradnetze von Land- und Sternkarten? (1934). Georg Scheffers died August 12, 1945, in Berlin."

  "text" : "Gary Williamson (25 September 1941 – 28 March 2009) was an Australian rules footballer who played with Richmond and South Melbourne in the Victorian Football League (VFL). A ruckman, Williamson spent four seasons at Richmond, after arriving from Alvie. He played 15 games in 1961, the most he would play in a single season. Crossing to South Melbourne in 1965, he would only appear in eight rounds, but it was enough to bring up 50 league games. For the rest of the 1960s and until his retirement in 1978, Williamson played in a total of 205 games for Wodonga in the Ovens & Murray Football League (OMFL). He joined Wodonga in 1967 and at the end of his debut season was awarded both the club's \"Best and Fairest\" award as well as the OMFL's Morris Medal. An achilles injury cost him a spot in Wodonga's 1967 premiership side but in 1969, when he won his second club \"Best and Fairest\", he was a member of their grand final winning team. He also came close to securing another Morris Medal in 1969, finishing second to Jeff Hemphill. Williamson, who continued to serve Wodonga off the field after his retirement, was named in 2004 as the club's Team of the Century ruckman and two years later was inducted into the OMFL Hall of Fame."

He rose to the rank of Captain in the U.S. Army before resigning in 1903. After a few years in business in Pittsburgh, he entered the State Department as a clerk. After rising through the ranks and serving in Japan, China, Mexico and Italy, he was appointed Minister to Honduras in 1924. In 1929, he was transferred to Venezuela, and in 1934 to Panama. In 1937, President Roosevelt appointed Summerlin Chief of Protocol. He retained that position until 1946, when he retired for health reasons. He died at the Navy Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland.

  "text" : "Gottardo Fidele Piazzoni (1872–1945) was a Swiss-born American landscape painter, muralist and sculptor of Italian heritage, a key member of the school of Northern California artists in the early 1900s. Born in Intragna, Switzerland, Piazzoni moved at the age of 15 to his father's dairy farm in the Carmel Valley. After training with Arthur Frank Mathews at the Mark Hopkins Institute of Art (now the San Francisco Art Institute), Piazzonia trained for three years in Paris at the Académie Julian and under Jean-Léon Gérôme. He then returned to California to begin his career and set up his own teaching studio. Specializing in landscapes in a muted palette, most scholars count Piazzoni among the Tonalists. He sought out the lighting effects of certain times of day, taking a \"special interest in full moonrises, the viewing of which became a family ritual. Venturing up a hill, the family would cheer the appearance of the moon. Piazzoni knew the exact time for each moonrise and kept precise records.\" Piazzoni's best-known public work may be his 14 murals for the former headquarters of the San Francisco Public Library for architect George W. Kelham, ten of them dating from 1932, the other four painted in 1945 and not installed until the 1970s. After public debate and lawsuits in the late 1990s, the ten principal murals can now be seen at the M. H. de Young Memorial Museum. By early 1901 Piazzoni was sharing a studio with fellow painter Xavier Martínez, with whom he founded a year later the short-lived California Society of Artists. He was also a co-founder of the California Society of Etchers in 1912, with Robert B. Harshe (1879–1938), art professor at Stanford University; Pedro Joseph de Lemos (1882–1954), professor at San Francisco Art Institute; and Ralph Stackpole (1885–1973), sculptor, printmaker, and at that time Piazzoni's studio assistant. He enthusiastically advanced the career of sculptor Arthur Putnam. He was also a member of the Bohemian Club, exhibited with the Berkeley and Monterey art colonies, taught at the San Francisco Art Institute, and served on the jury and advisory committee of the Art Gallery at the Hotel Del Monte. In 1927 he publicly protested when the directors of the municipal Oakland Art Gallery threatened to remove two displayed paintings of “explicit female nudes.” Piazzoni was also a good friend of Impressionist Granville Redmond and introduced the deaf-mute artist to Charlie Chaplin. The relationship of Redmond, Chaplin and Piazzoni is explored in a play by Steve Hauk, `The Floating Hat,’ published by the Traditional Fine Art Organization, Inc. The play is also in the collection of the Gallaudet University library. Among his students were George Post, Rinaldo Cuneo, Dorr Bothwell, and Clayton Sumner Price. American landscape painter Mireille Piazzoni Wood was Piazzoni's daughter, painter-writer Philip Wood his son-in-law. Artists Thomas Wood and Russell Chatham are Piazzoni grandsons."

  "text" : "George Smits (Antwerp, 1944–1997), aka 'Toet', was a Belgian visual artist, experimental musician and inventor of experimental musical instruments. In the sixties, he was a member of the band of Ferre Grignard. Smits was also active as an actor in a few movies, and was part of Antwerp's underground arts scene (e.g. the Ercola collective and also part of Fred Bervoets band and Panamarenko). Besides his musical career, he was active as a painter, and an experimental musician with his own radio show on the Belgian public radio Radio Centraal. This radio show, broadcast at night, gave Smits the motivation to increasingly focus on creating music (leaving some of his paintings unfinished), using instruments he had invented himself as well as effects, but also, gradually, new electronic tools. Smith prepared his radio show very precise, spending about 20 hours of recording of sounds in advance of the broadcast. On the radio broadcasting, he worked under the pseudonym Captain Zbolk. George Smits is mostly known for his self-created musical instruments. Many of Smits' instruments are acoustic and made with polystyrene, large springs and long strings."

Rice, a line and bank-note engraver. He engraved in mezzotint a large plate, entitled “The Signing of the Compact in the Cabin of the Mayflower,” before he was nineteen years old. He was employed by New York engravers in 1858-1860 and in 1860 began engraving on his own and soon established a successful business in New York City. He mainly did portrait engraving and though he had many engravers in his employ, it is said that he finished every plate himself. Among his best known productions were the engravings entitled \"The Better Land\", dedicated to the poet Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, published in 1866; \"The Good Part\", published a few years later; and a series of portraits on steel of distinguished men which appeared in The Eclectic Magazine. Of the books published by him, the most noteworthy were: \"History of the Fifty-First Congress\" (illustrated), and \"A History of New York City\", by Benson John Lossing, LL.D., the historian. George Edward Perine was born July 9, 1837, at South Orange, New Jersey, a son of Joseph and Sarah Decker Perine, and a descendant of Daniel Perrin, \"The Huguenot\". He married Augusta Moore on June 15, 1859 and had eight children. He died February 3, 1885, at Brooklyn, New York."

  "text" : "Graham Jackson (15 February 1967 – 23 July 2012) was a British conductor. Born in Burnham-on-Sea, Somerset, Jackson learned the clarinet, piano and bassoon as a youth, and served as first bassoon in the National Youth Orchestra of Great Britain. He studied at Trinity College, Cambridge from 1985 to 1988 as organ scholar, receiving a double first in music and mathematics. Jackson then gained a scholarship to study conducting for three years at the Royal Northern College of Music in Manchester. Having concluded his studies, in 1992 he joined Welsh National Opera as chorus master, repetiteur and conductor. He soon earned a reputation for his prodigious keyboard skills and his ability to conduct whole scores from memory, a habit that would stay with him for the rest of his life. From 2000 to 2003, Jackson was \"Kapellmeister\" (principal conductor) at the Theater Bremen, where at a week's notice he took over the new production of Shostakovich's Lady Macbeth of Mtsensk to critical acclaim. He became \"Generalmusikdirektor\" (Director of Music) of the Theater Krefeld and Mönchengladbach in 2003.  He concluded his tenure in this post in early July 2012, just over a fortnight before his death from cancer. His final concert was a performance of Berlioz's Symphonie Fantastique, conducted against the advice of his doctor. His work in contemporary music included conducting premieres of works by François Sarhan, Charlotte Seither, Stefan Heucke and Sidney Corbett. He felt that his finest achievement was the première of Heuke's work Das Frauenorchester von Auschwitz, an opera that tells how female prisoners at the concentration camp made music together under the direction of Alma Rosé, Mahler's niece. At the time it provoked much discussion in German musical circles. He was popular with both critics and audiences alike, and was voted Conductor of the Year by critics in North Rhine Westphalia for 2010-11. Jackson was married for 19 years to the artist and flautist Adrienne Jackson. The couple had four children, Oliver, Helena, Daniel and Tess. He died at Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge on 23 July 2012. His widow and children survive him."

  "text" : "Guigo I also known as Guigues du Chastel, Guigo de Castro and Guigo of Saint-Romain, was a Carthusian monk and the 5th prior of Grande Chartreuse monastery in the 12th century. He was born in 1083 near the Chateau of Saint-Romain, and entered the Grande Chartreuse in 1106. Still a young man, his abilities led him to be elected prior in 1109 (aged 26). It was during his priorate that the original community slowly began to expand. Guigo was called on to compose the first Customs (Consuetudines) of the new hermits sometime between 1121 and 1128. Between 1109 and 1120 he also wrote the Meditations, 476 proverb-like sayings that characterized the wisdom of solitary, monastic life. In addition, some letters and a hagiographical piece survive. He was also a spiritual leader; Bernard of Clairvaux visited the Grande Chartreuse, probably in the 1120s, and wrote several letters to Guigo. He ruled the community until his death in 1136. He was a man of considerable learning, was known for his eloquence and great memory. He was a close friend of St. Bernard of Clairvaux and of Peter the Venerable, both of whom wrote of Guigo's sanctity. The treatise De vita contemplativa, also known as De Contemplatione has sometimes been attributed to Guigo I. However, it cannot have been written by Guigo I, because it refers to several writings of thirteenth-century scholastic theology, including Hugh of Balma's Viae Syon Lugent. It is acknowledged to be a late thirteenth-century text, with its author generally known as Guigo de Ponte."

  "text" : "Guillaume le Vinier (c. 1190–1245) was a cleric and trouvère, one of the most prolific composers in the genre. He has left compositions in all the major subgenres of trouvère poetry: chansons d'amour, jeux-partis, a lai, a descort, a chanson de mal mariée and a ballade. He wrote Marian songs and even an imaginary dialogue with a nightingale. His work can be dated with some precision: the poem \"En tous tens\" is quoted in the Roman de la violette, which was written around 1225. Guillaume was born into a wealthy bourgeois family of Arras, the son of Philippe le Vinier and Alent. His younger brother, Gilles le Vinier, was also a trouvère. The two exchanged at least two jeux-partis: \"Frere, ki fait mieus\" and \"Sire frere, fetes m'un jugemen\". (The former may have served as a model for the anonymous song \"A ce que je vuel comencier\" (RS1272), although this assumption has been made purely on the basis of shared poetic form, since no contemporary melody survives for RS1272, which can be viewed, with a later piece of 'nonsense' notation here.) Guillaume is called 'magister' in a charter of 1245 and 'maistre' in manuscript copies of his songs, so was certainly a cleric. One of his songs (RS378) makes reference to the 'je' having been formerly at the Abbey of Saint-Vaast. Nonetheless, a charter of 1245 notes that he married a certain Hauydis, who re-married one Robert de Humbercourt on the death of Guillaume. Guillaume was well-connected to the other trouvères active in and around Arras. He composed jeux-partis with Colart le Boutellier, Andrieu Contredit and Adam de Givenchi for certain, and may also have collaborated with Moniot d'Arras, Thomas Herier and the King of Navarre. Colart, Adam and Jehan Erart all dedicated works to him. He expressed a debt of gratitude to Gace Brulé's style in \"Voloirs de faire\" and quoted Gace's \"N'est pas a soi\" in one of his jeux-partis with Gilles. The unaccredited Marian song \"Vierge pucele roiaus\", which is modelled on the Old Occitan piece \"Lo clar tems vei brunezir\" by Raimon Jordan, may belong to Guillaume. Most of Guillaume's music is in bar form, although \"Chancon envoisie\" is given partially in mensural notation in the Chansonnier Cangé. His melodies typically have a range greater than an octave. According to Karp, \"modal interpretation of the melodies does not seem appropriate\". The date of Guillaume's death must be before Pentecost (4 June) in the year of 1245, since he is inscribed in the Necrology of the Confrérie des jongleurs et des bourgeois d'Arras for that year."

In 1274 he was in command of a fleet in Ischia. In 1278 he was one of Charles' vassals who was ordered to provide ships for his planned crusade. In 1279 he was the castellan of Bari and later on the commander of the whole fleet in Abruzzo and Apulia. In 1282 he participated in the attack on Sicily in an effort by Charles to recapture the island following the Sicilian Vespers, but with no success. He was removed definitively from command in 1283, on account of old age and he is not mentioned again in the sources."

Ensign Lucas and Lieutenant Girardot, were on watch together the night of the wreck. Both heard the night orders given to the naval officer of the watch; Lucas was afterwards always under the impression that a small grass fire high on the shore at Danger Point misled this officer into thinking it was the lighthouse at Cape Agulha. After the ship was breached, Lucas helped supervise the evacuation of the women and children in the ship's boat during the sinking of the HMS Birkenhead. Three weeks after the wreck, he posted home \"an account of his experience which is of great interest. The narrative written while the circumstances were fresh in its author’s memory gives us a vivid picture of the scene on that terrible night in February 1852.\" Lucas retired as a Captain in 1859, subsequently serving as a magistrate in Durban. Prior to his retirement to England in 1897, he also served as Chief Magistrate at Durban. He was still alive in 1902 but died in 1914."

  "text" : "Gary Cox (born 1964, England) is a British philosopher and biographer and the author of several books on Jean-Paul Sartre, existentialism and general philosophy. A Philosophy graduate of the University of Southampton, UK, he was awarded his PhD in 1996 from the University of Birmingham, UK, for his thesis on Jean-Paul Sartre's theory of consciousness, freedom and bad faith and is an honorary research fellow of that same university. His most notable works to date are The Sartre Dictionary (2008), How to Be an Existentialist, or How to Get Real, Get a Grip and Stop Making Excuses (2009) and The God Confusion: Why Nobody Knows the Answer to the Ultimate Question (2013). Cox’s early publications reflect his research into both the philosophical, fictional and biographical writings of Jean-Paul Sartre, with his book, The Sartre Dictionary, providing a comprehensive overview of Sartre’s major works, ideas, influences and contemporaries. From 2009 onwards, with the publication of How to Be an Existentialist, Gary Cox took the ideas of existentialism to a wider, non-specialist audience, emphasising the self-help and personal empowerment aspects of the theory. An attack on contemporary 'excuse culture', the work urges the reader to face the hard existential truths of the human condition and to take full responsibility for his or her inalienable freedom. How to Be an Existentialist has been cited in such diverse areas as existential counselling and management and leadership training. In 2010, Cox continued his efforts to popularise philosophy in the UK with the publication of How to Be a Philosopher, or How to Be Almost Certain that Almost Nothing is Certain, a beginners' guide to philosophy written in the same accessible, popular style as How to Be an Existentialist. 2011 saw the publication of his Existentialist’s Guide to Death, the Universe and Nothingness, a guide to key existentialist themes that, as its title suggests, is something of a homage to Douglas Adams. In 2013 Cox published The God Confusion, a controversial book exploring questions concerning the idea and existence of God that is critical of both theism and atheism and advocates agnosticism as the only tenable philosophical position. Cox published Deep Thought: 42 Fantastic Quotes that Define Philosophy in October 2015 and has recently completed a much anticipated biography of Sartre - Existentialism and Excess: The Life and Times of Jean-Paul Sartre - to be published by Bloomsbury in 2016. \n* The Sartre Dictionary and Other Works"

He wanted to do something with food later in life but taking over the bakery was impossible, due to an allergy to flour so he started training to become chef. He learned and worked his way up to a two-star restaurant in Paris. Then he got his lucky break and came in contact with Patrick Guilbaud, who at that time was looking for a chef for his new restaurant in Ireland. In 1981 Lebrun arrived in Dublin to work in Restaurant Patrick Guilbaud. There he had a difficult start, but Guilbaud prevented him from leaving. Lebrun's signature dishes include Lobster Ravioli, Roast Challans Duck for two and Assiette Gourmande au Chocolat."

  "text" : "Georg Wolf of Kotzau, nicknamed the rich (d. 1560) was an Imperial Knight and Amtmann and Governor. Georg Wolf of Kotzau was a member of the ancient knightly family of Kotzau. According to the genealogists Alban of Dobeneck, Georg Wolf of Kotzau was a son of Hans von Kotzau, who was Amtmann of Münchberg and who bought Oberkotzau Castle, Fattigau Castle and Burgstall Haideck from his brothers. Georg served Margrave Albert II Alcibiades of Brandenburg-Kulmbach as Amtmann at Epprechtstein Castle and later in Rehau. In the Schmalkaldic War, he followed the call of his sovereign to defend the Plassenburg. Later he went into the service of Henry IV of Plauen and was governor of the Plauen-Voigtsberg Castle area. At the outbreak of the Second Margrave War, Georg, like most of his peers, refused knight service to his Margrave; instead he openly joined the other side and, after the Siege of Hof in 1533, he briefly served as governor of Hof. After the defeat of Albert Alcibiades, the Hohenzollerns made their influence felt and gave the principality of Brandenburg-Kulmbach to George Frederick I of Brandenburg-Ansbach-Kulmbach. George Frederick burned down some of Kotzau's castles, include the manor at Fattigau, to punish, in his view, the breakaway Georg Wolf, despite the latter holding letters of protection from the Emperor Charles V and King Ferdinand I of Bohemia. George Wolf died in 1560 and was buried in the St. James Church (St. Jakobs Kirche) in Oberkotzau. His painted tomb shows the knight kneeling before the cross and several ancestral coats of arms as proof of ancestry."

  "text" : "Gheorghe Briceag (15 April 1928 – 16 August 2008) was a Moldovan human rights activist notable for his opposition to Soviet rule. In the 1940s, Briceag was given a ten-year sentence in the gulag for distributing anti-communist flyers; he was forced to work in coal mines for the length of his sentence. His prisoner number was \"P169\". After his release, he was sentenced to seven more years of exile. He later became a symbol of resistance to Soviet occupation of Moldova. In 2004, Briceag won the Homo Homini Award of the Czech NGO People in Need, which recognizes \"an individual who is deserving of significant recognition due to their promotion of human rights, democracy and non-violent solutions to political conflicts\". The award citation described him as \"a life-long activist for the defense of human rights and the defense of other former Gulag prisoners in Moldova\". The following year, he served on the Rudolf Vrba Jury for People in Need's One World International Human Rights Documentary Film Festival, serving with fellow Homo Homini-winner Ales Bialacki. The same year, Briceag created controversy by opposing the re-installation of a statue of Vladimir Lenin in his hometown of Bălţi. Briceag threatened to burn the statue down personally if it were completed. The Supreme Court of Moldova ultimately overruled the Bălţi City Council's decision to allow the statue. Briceag also worked with Amnesty International and served as the Bălţi coordinator of the Helsinki Committee for Human Rights. Briceag was noted for his large \"Solzhenitsyn-style\" beard. A few months before his death, he pledged to shave it if Moldova united with Romania, a move Moldova's communist party opposed. He publicly requested that his body be donated to Chişinău's Nicolae Testemiţanu State University of Medicine and Pharmacy following his death."

Yourofsky has been admired by many, and criticized by others for his alleged extreme views. He has been arrested 13 times between the years 1997–2001, and has spent 77 days in a Canadian maximum security prison in 1999, after raiding a fur farm in Canada, releasing 1,542 mink in 1997."

Livesey, who arrived in the town to become organist at St Bees Priory in 1887. Dixon assisted Livesey in the design of the new organ at St. Bees, which was built by Henry Willis and completed in 1899. Dixon later designed the large organ at St Nicholas's church in Whitehaven. In 1909 he designed an instrument for St. James', Whitehaven, and went on to advise on many large organ projects, including those at Carlisle and Norwich cathedrals, several Cambridge colleges, and the Royal Albert Hall."

  "text" : "Dr. George Emory Goodfellow (December 23, 1855 – December 7, 1910) was a physician and naturalist in the American Old West who developed a reputation as the United States' foremost expert in treating bullet wounds. As a physician in Tombstone, Arizona Territory, he treated many gunshot wounds to both lawmen and outlaws. He performed the first recorded laparotomy for treating an abdominal gunshot wound and was the first surgeon to perform a perineal prostatectomy to remove an enlarged prostate. He pioneered the use of spinal anesthesia and sterile techniques in treating gunshot wounds and is regarded as the first civilian trauma surgeon. Goodfellow was a pugnacious, \"brilliant and versatile\" physician with wide-ranging interests. During his life he not only practiced medicine; he studied earthquakes and published the first surface rupture map of an earthquake in North America, interviewed Geronimo, conducted research into the venom of Gila monsters, and played a role in brokering a peace settlement in the Spanish–American War. He was also a skilled boxer and in his first year at the United States Naval Academy, he became the Academy boxing champion, but was dismissed for kicking and beating the first African-American to attend the institution. In 1889, he got into a fight with another man and stabbed him, but was found to have acted in self-defense. Goodfellow treated Virgil Earp and Morgan Earp after they were wounded in the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral. His testimony later helped absolve the Earps and Doc Holliday of murder charges when they shot and killed three outlaw Cowboys and supported their contention that they acted lawfully. He treated Virgil again when he was maimed in an ambush and rushed to Morgan's side when he was mortally wounded by an assassin. He left Tombstone in 1889 and established a successful practice in Tucson before moving to San Francisco in 1899 and opened a medical office there. He lost his practice and all of his personal belongings in the 1906 San Francisco Earthquake and returned to the Southwest where he became the Chief Surgeon for the Southern Pacific Railroad in Mexico. He fell ill during 1910 and died later that year in Los Angeles."
