  "text" : "Harald Saue (20 February 1876 – 28 December 1958) was a Norwegian farmer and politician for the Agrarian Party and later Nasjonal Samling. He was born at Saue in Lier as a son of farmers Kristen Nilsen Saue (1844–1923) and Gina Helgerud (1849–1938). He had various jobs in his early life, including the construction and managing of the factory Nittedals Torvstrøfabrik. He was also a petty officer in the Norwegian military from 1900 to 1916. In 1905 he left his factory to take over the family farm in Lier. He has been listed as having held \"almost all municipal posts\" in Lier, and was a board member of the Lier Line and the local savings bank. He chaired the county branch of the Norwegian Agrarian Association for eleven years, as well as the county branch of the Agrarian Party. He chaired the countywide agrarian association Buskeruds landbruksselskap from 1928 to 1932, having been a board member since 1915. He was also a member of Riksskattestyret from 1929 to 1945, and chairman of Felleskjøpet in Oslo from 1935. He was a member of Lier municipal council from 1910 to 1913 and 1919 to 1928, serving as mayor from 1922 to 1928. He was elected to the Parliament of Norway in 1924 from the constituency Buskerud, and was re-elected in 1927 and 1930. He was the deputy leader of the Standing Committee on the Military, from 1927 leader following the death of Harald Løvenskiold, and for his last two terms deputy leader again. During the occupation of Norway by Nazi Germany, Saue joined the Fascist party Nasjonal Samling. Because of this, he was convicted of treason by Eidsivating Court of Appeal in February 1946 during the legal purge in Norway after World War II. He was sentenced to six years of forced labour and loss of civil rights, but was pardoned in October 1948. He died in late December 1958 and was buried in a family grave in Lier."

However he was expelled from the House of Commons by vote on 2 November 1641 for selling protections to men who were not his servants. Benson declared that there was no better replacement for his than his son in law William Deerlove, although Deerlove's election was declared void. Benson took arms for the King and in February 1642 was reported to be occupying Plupton tower near Knaresborough with two cannon. Benson married Elizabeth Deerlove at Knaresborough in 1633."

  "text" : "Henry Thomas Windsor was the owner of \"The City Despatch Post Company\" of New York which issued the first Stamp in the USA. A black/grey three cent stamp depicting the head of George Washington. Windsor was a merchant from London who was inspired by Rowland Hill's postal reforms in Great Britain including the issuing of the world's first stamp the Penny Black. Windsor with his wife Elizabeth sailed from Liverpool in April 1841, reaching New York in May. Up to the autumn of that year he spent his time visiting friends in Boston and Baltimore. In travelling around he, who was familiar with the English postal system, was struck by the inefficiency and excessive charges of the local service. He decided as a business venture, to establish a private post in New York City. While setting up and running the business he lived in Hoboken, New Jersey. He established the City Despatch Post on the 1st February 1842, employing his friend Alexander M Greig from whose house they ran the business. They started operating during the first week of February 1842, in time for the busy Valentine season. A few months after founding the City Dispatch Post, Windsor sold it to the U.S. Government and the post became known as the \"United States City Despatch Post.\" The government began operation of this local post on August 16, 1842. After the sale Windsor and his wife returned to London. The 3-cent stamp issued City Despatch Post in 1842 was the first adhesive stamp issued in the Western Hemisphere. It followed Great Britain’s Penny Black and Two-Pence Blue by a mere 21 months and predated the U.S. 1845 Postmaster’s Provisionals, and 1847 General Issues by three and five years, respectively. The stamps were engraved on steel by Rawdon, Wright & Hatch and printed in sheets of 42."

  "text" : "Heinrich Hentzi von Arthurm (October 24, 1785 - May 21, 1849) was a Hungarian general in the army of the Austrian Empire. He was famous for his refusal to defect to the Hungarian rebels during the Battle of Buda in 1849, defending Buda city and castle on behalf of the Austrian Habsburgs. Born in Debrecen, Hentzi's military career reached a climax in April 1849 when, as Austrian forces evacuated Pest, he established a defense on the Buda side of the river, based on the castle there. Holding out against a Hungarian siege for over a month, Hentzi refused to capitulate. When the nationalist general Artúr Görgey appealed to Hentzi's Magyar ancestry in an attempt to secure his surrender, Hentzi replied while he had indeed been born in Hungary, his loyalty was to the Kaiser. Hentzi was killed when Hungarian forces stormed Buda and its castle in late May 1849."

Bond settled in New Jersey, likely married Thomas Vincent, and became a teacher. She wrote The Bondwoman's Narrative by Hannah Crafts after gaining freedom, which may be the first novel by an African-American woman. It is the only known one by a fugitive slave woman. Apparently written in the late 1850s, the novel was published in 2002 for the first time after Henry Louis Gates, Jr., a Harvard University professor of African-American literature and history, purchased the manuscript and had it authenticated. It rapidly became a bestseller. Bond's identity was documented in 2013 by Gregg Hecimovich of Winthrop University, who found that she had been held by John Hill Wheeler of Murfreesboro, North Carolina. He had identified many details of her life. Gates and other major scholars have supported his conclusions."

In subsequent years, working as a land agent with Richard Henderson and Daniel Boone, he explored large parts of Middle Tennessee and Central Kentucky. Scaggs was credited with the rescue of noted kidnap victim, Jenny Wiley in 1790, and with a frontier, vigilante posse, led a pursuit and failed attempt to apprehend America's first known serial killers, the Harpe Brothers in 1799."

  "text" : "Henry Augustus Pearson Torrey (1837–1902) (also known as \"HAP\" or \"Happy\" Torrey) was a professor of philosophy at the University of Vermont. Torrey was a great-grandson of Manasseh Cutler who had been a member of the United States Congress. His father, Augustus Torrey, was a medical doctor. Torrey was born in Beverly, Massachusetts. He moved to the household of his uncle Joseph Torrey to go to Burlington High School. He then studied at the University of Vermont, completing his bachelor's degree in 1858. After teaching school for a time in Beverly, Massachusetts, he went to the Union Theological Seminary in the City of New York from which he graduated in 1864. He was an ordained Congregational minister in Vergennes, Vermont until he was appointed to the faculty of the University of Vermont in 1868, taking on the Chair that had previously belonged to his uncle. He also served as secretary of the University starting in 1871, the year the university began to admit women. A \"sound philosopher\", Torrey was an Intuitionist, as well as possessing a strong interest in Immanuel Kant, having \"cut his philosophical teeth\" on the Critique of Pure Reason. Nevertheless, Torrey did not follow any single philosophical system, and as a result he encouraged his students towards inquiry over the following of a particular approach. Torrey taught John Dewey both when Dewey was a student at the University of Vermont and later in one-on-one sessions, in particular when Dewey returned to Vermont in the early 1880s to teach in a private academy. This period of private tuition was a considerable influence on Dewey, as it was this period when Torrey pointed Dewey towards a career in philosophy. Torrey's interest in Kant and the emphasis he placed on Kant's writings in his teaching influenced Dewey's early work, as evidenced in Dewey's first four publications. In 1865 he married Sarah Paine Torrey, a daughter of his uncle Joseph Torrey, and thus his first cousin."

  "text" : "Harvey D. Strassman (September 19, 1922 – January 30, 2011) was a psychiatrist, psychoanalyst, medical educator, and clinical researcher. He is the father of ventriloquist David Strassman. Strassman, a veteran of World War II and the Korean War, is best known for his documentation of a syndrome that eventually became known as posttraumatic stress disorder, a result of insights gained from interviews with prisoners of war who had been held in North Korea. He described the condition in the paper \"A Prisoner of War Syndrome: Apathy as a Reaction to Severe Stress\", published with two colleagues in June 1956 in the American Journal of Psychiatry. Strassman conducted the interviews over several months aboard a hospital ship. He concluded that the prisoners had not been \"brainwashed\", as some people had alleged. Rather, they withdrew as a defensive adjustment to the stress of being a prisoner of war. The withdrawal and suppressed emotional responses, he noted, could become so severe and complete that it could lead to a “maladaptive state of dependency in which he (the prisoner) ceases to take care of himself even to the point of death.” He labeled the syndrome “apathy” and distinguished it from a catatonic stupor, or depression. He was a staff physician at the Veterans Administration (VA) Center in Los Angeles and an instructor in clinical psychiatry at the medical school of the University of California, Los Angeles when he published the paper."

Probably educated at King's Worcester himself, he went on to Brasenose College, Oxford as a \"plebeian\" and then to Balliol College, where he took a BA (1584) and Masters (1587). Starting at King’s Worcester in 1689, he also held a number of paid positions within the Church of England, including at Broadwas (1591–1607), Tredington (1607-), a canonry at Hereford Cathedral (1607-) and Worcester Cathedral (1618-). Fuller claims that \"this Master Bright [was] placed by divine Providence in this city in the Marches that he might equally communicate the lustre of grammar learning to youth both of England and Wales\". Pupils did attend the school from both countries. The school under Bright also provided yearly \"exhibitions\" of 2/- for pupils he sent to colleges at Oxford and Cambridge. His reputation was also echoed by Anthony Wood in his Fasti Oxoniensis: He had a most excellent faculty in instructing youths in Latin, Greek and Hebrew, most of which were afterwards sent to the universities, where they proved eminent to emulation. He was also an excellent preacher, was resorted to far and near ... The posterity of this Hen. Bright do now live in genteel fashion in Worcestershire."

In his spare time, he organised Slum Children's Outings for the East End. He also stood unsuccessfully as a Labour Party candidate in Bath at the 1922 general election, then Watford in 1924, Spen Valley in 1929, and on one further occasion. He was elected to Middlesex County Council.

Whittow worked for the Western Telegraph and the South Wales Echo, before moving to London to work on the London Evening News, and then the Daily Star.

In October 1986, Whittow became one of the first journalists to report that Queen singer Freddie Mercury could be suffering from AIDS, just a couple of months after his final live performance with the band at Knebworth Park. Whittow approached Mercury at Heathrow Airport where he was returning from a shopping trip to Japan. Mercury denied that he had a sexual disease. In 1987, Whittow travelled to Spain with a brief to purchase a donkey which was due to be beaten as part of a fiesta, and send it to a sanctuary in the UK. However, a Daily Star journalist achieved this before him, and his newspaper taunted The Sun over this in a front-page story. Soon after, Whittow returned to the Star. Whittow became deputy editor of the Daily Star, and edited the Daily Star Sunday from its launch until 2003, then became Deputy Editor of the Daily Express. In 2011, he was promoted to become Editor of the paper."

  "text" : "Hassan Shariatmadari is an Iranian opposition politician and a leading proponent of the Free Elections Movement (Jonbeshe Entekhabate Azad) in Iran. He is the son of Grand Ayatollah Seyyed Kazem Shariatmadari (one of the most powerful Shia clerics of Iran in the 1960s and 70s). During the Pahlavi regime, he supported his father’s position that the Shah’s authority should be limited to what had been specified in the Constitutional revolution of 1906, and that a democratic parliament should be in charge of running the country instead of the monarchy taking an active role in ruling Iran. Between 1973-1980 he served as the Chief Editor of Payame Shadi and Nasle Now monthly magazines for children and youth. At the time of the Iranian revolution of 1979, Shariatmadari co-founded the Iranian People’s Republican Party (IPRP). A firm believer in the separation of religion and politics, his movement resisted the establishment of the Velayat-e faqih (Rule of the Jurist) system in Iran and was violently crushed by the Iranian revolutionary guard and the Basij in 1980 after which he went into exile. At its height, IPRP was able to mobilize more than a million people in the Azarbayjan province of Iran to protest against Khomeini’s rule. In 1983, Shariatmadari joined forces with several nationalist and center leftist groups to form the National Republicans of Iran, a coalition aimed at uniting a broad range of secular forces under a common political umbrella organization. In 2004, he joined other secular political leaders of the opposition in the formation of United Republicans for Iran (URI) (Etehadieh Jomhoori khahan), once the largest coalition of Iranian opposition groups after the revolution. The URI envisioned Iran as a democratic republic with constitutional guarantees of civil, political, social rights and individual liberties, separation of religion and state, sustainable social development, gender equality, rights of minorities, and increased local decision-making authority, and supported a non-violent struggle path towards democracy. Shariatmadari holds two master's degrees, one in Physics from Aryamehr University of Technology (currently Sharif University of Technology) and one in Law from Tehran University. In parallel to his university studies, he studied theology and philosophy at the Qom Shia Seminary, and is intimately familiar with Islamic jurisprudence. In June 2013, he gave a series of Persian-language webinars on the role of free and fair elections in transitioning democracies for Tavaana: E-Learning Institute for Iranian Civil Society."

After residing for a while in Leiden, Netherlands, and continuing his university education at Webster University in Leiden, he toured Curaçao with musician and friend Levi Silvanie. They performed at various venues combining poetry with Silvanie's music. They both organized a night of poetry and music on local television. He also toured South Africa in December 2010.

Hyspaosines is mainly known from coins, but also appears in texts of cuneiform script (in the Babylonian astronomical diaries). Pliny the Elder mentions that he was the son of a certain \"Sagdodonacos the king of Arabs\". According to Pliny, Hyspaosines was of Arab ancestry; however, his name was Persian. Hyspaosines was appointed Satrap of the Characene area by Antiochus IV and he rebuilt the city after a flood. During the Parthian Invasion of 141 BC, Hyspaosines (c. 209 BC - 124 BC) declared independence as the eastern empire fell to the invaders. Two years after the invasion a Babylonian tablet records him with the title king. Hyspaosines conquered parts of south Mesopotamia and of Persia. On 24 June 127 BC he is for the first time called 'king'. An inscription found in Bahrain, then known as Tylos, indicates that he also ruled this island. The inscription mentions his wife, queen Thalassia. She appears in the Babylonian 'astronomical diaries'. In 124 BC, Hyspaosines became ill and died on June 11. After the death of her husband queen Thalassia tried to install her son as king. Coins with his name were struck until 121 BC. Coinage from his time were discovered in Kuwait and Qatif in Saudi Arabia."

Born free in South Carolina, Turner learned to read and write and became a Methodist preacher. He joined the AME Church in St. Louis, Missouri in 1858, where he became a minister; later he had pastorates in Baltimore, Maryland and Washington, DC. In 1863 during the American Civil War, Turner was appointed as the first black chaplain in the United States Colored Troops. Afterward, he was appointed to the Freedmen's Bureau in Georgia. He settled in Macon and was elected to the state legislature in 1868 during Reconstruction. He planted many AME churches in Georgia after the war. In 1880 he was elected as the first southern bishop of the AME Church after a fierce battle within the denomination. Angered by the Democrats' regaining power and instituting Jim Crow laws in the late nineteenth century South, Turner began to support black nationalism and emigration of blacks to Africa. He was the chief figure to do so in the late nineteenth century; the movement grew after World War I."

Round was the eldest child of Joseph and Gertrude Round. He spent his early years in the small town of Kingswinford in Staffordshire and received his early education at Cheltenham Grammar School. He later attended the Royal College of Science, a constituent college of Imperial College London where he gained a first class honours degree. Round joined the Marconi Company in 1902; not long after Marconi had made his transatlantic wireless transmission. He was sent to the USA where he experimented with a variety of different aspects of radio technology, focusing on technologies such as powdered iron cored tuning inductors. He also performed some experiments with transmission paths over land and sea at different times of the day and investigated direction finding, for which he used a frame antenna."

  "text" : "Richard Hugh \"Huw\" Lloyd-Langton (6 February 1951 - 6 December 2012) was an English guitarist, best known as the guitarist for Hawkwind. He also had his own band, the Lloyd Langton Group, with bass player Kenny Wilson and drummer John Clark (along with Ultravox drummer Warren Cann), and was the session lead guitarist for UK band The Meads of Asphodel. Lloyd-Langton was born in Harlesden, north west London. As a member of Hawkwind he appeared on their first album, Hawkwind, before leaving the band. He played guitar for Widowmaker and Leo Sayer during the 1970s, then rejoined Hawkwind in 1979, appearing on the Live Seventy Nine album release from that year and the subsequent Levitation album. He continued performing with Hawkwind until 1988, after which he made occasional guest appearances, then rejoined for a brief spell in 2001-2002 until ill health (Legionnaires' disease) forced him to leave once more. He sometimes played solo as an acoustic support act for Hawkwind, including at The Brook in Southampton in December 2009. Acoustic slots at English charity (playing for free) and space rock events were also common throughout this decade. Huw's health had been generally poor for a decade and he was quite frail, with several broken bones and minor injuries (rarely letting fans down though - he once played a gig with a broken arm, reworking his solos on the fly so that he could play them in one area of the guitar neck). He died at his home on 6 December 2012, aged 61 years old, after a two-year fight with cancer. His final recording with Hawkwind was a re-recording of Master of the Universe for the compilation album Spacehawks."

On 18 January 1699 he acquired the seigneury of Schellenberg, and on 22 February 1712 the county of Vaduz. These two domains would later form the present principality of Liechtenstein. He was also Duke of Opava and Krnov. Johann did not take up an office at the Imperial court but did case-by-case work, especially as a financial expert. He was known informally as Hans Adam the Rich. Besides managing his property, he took a great interest in art. He bought works by Rubens and van Dyck for his collections and was one of the most generous patrons of his time. Johann created two memorials to himself, a palace in Bankgasse in Vienna and a summer palace in Rossau. He was the 575th Knight of the Order of the Golden Fleece in Austria."

  "text" : "Henry Fell (fl. 1672), was a Quaker missionary and writer. Fell was a member of one of the numerous Lancashire families bearing his surname. The first mention of him is in 1656 as suffering much from the magistrates in Essex, and in the same year he went as a missionary to the West Indies, where he remained about a year. After his return to England he was engaged as a travelling preacher, and is referred to by his contemporaries as having been eloquent and successful. In 1659 he was seriously ill-treated by some soldiers near Westminster Hall, and in 1660 Richard Hubberthorne, the quaker, represented to Charles II that at Thetford, Norfolk, Fell had been hauled out of a meeting, and, after being whipped, turned out of the town, and passed as a vagabond from parish to parish to Lancashire. In a letter to Margaret Fell (Swarthmore MSS.) Fell states that he was imprisoned for some time at Thetford. He was in London during the rising of the Fifth-monarchy men in this year, and was knocked down by the soldiers as a rioter, and Fox (Journal, p. 314, ed. 1765) says he would have been killed but for the interposition of the Duke of York. In 1661 he was ‘moved,’ in company with John Stubbs, to promulgate his views in ‘foreign parts, especially to Prester John's country and China.’ As no shipmasters would carry them, the quakers got a warrant from the king, which the East India Company found means to avoid. They then went to Holland, and, being unable to obtain shipping there, proceeded to Alexandria. The English consul banished them from the place as nuisances, and they were compelled to return to England. After spending some time in religious journeys, he again visited the West Indies, and a letter in the Shackleton collection states that in 1672 he was living in Barbados, that he was married, in debt, and much depressed. Nothing more is known of his life. Fell was a man of highly devotional spirit, and full of benevolence and courage. His few and brief writings show him to have received an education above the average; their style is good, and the language well chosen."

Strauss never carried a weapon in case the local police picked him up on suspicion. He would scout his murder spot for any tool that would do the job. Most of his associates called him \"Pep\". In the 1930s, he was committing assaults, larcenies, and drug dealing. He was arrested 18 times but was never convicted until he was found guilty of the homicide that sent him and fellow Murder, Inc. hitman Martin \"Bugsy\" Goldstein to the electric chair. After hitman Abe \"Kid Twist\" Reles turned informant, Strauss was arrested for the murder of Irving \"Puggy\" Feinstein, and at least five other known murders. Strauss tried to avoid conviction by feigning insanity in the courtroom and on death row. Strauss and Goldstein were convicted September 19, 1940, and executed by electrocution using Sing Sing's Old Sparky on June 12, 1941."

There he lived in extreme poverty, subsisting on alms, the excess of which he distributed among the poor. His death was accompanied by \"a popular outpouring of emotion\" and he was declared the patron saint of Treviso as early as 1316, just one year after his death. In 1317 the commune tried and failed to obtain official ecclesiastical sanction for his cult. A Trevisan priest, Count Rambaldo degli Azzoni Avogari, published a hagiography of him in 1760."

He is regarded as the father of the first Norwegian psychiatric hospital, Gaustad Hospital (Gaustad sykehus) and of the Norwegian Mental Health Act of 1848 regarding mental illness. Major was born at the Kristiansand borough of Oddernes in Vest-Agder, Norway. He was one of nine children born to Irish immigrant Robert Gonsalvo Major (1766–1839) and Benedicte Sophie Weidemann (1783–1859). His father had left Ireland in the aftermath of the Irish Rebellion of 1798. Major became a medical student in 1832 and was licensed as a physician in November 1842.He received a grant from the Norwegian Parliament and traveled to institutions in Schleswig, Great Britain, France and Belgium to study the conditions for the mentally ill (1843-1845). Major was for several years a doctor at the Oslo Hospital and was authorized as manager there from 1851. During 1845, the Norwegian Parliament allocated funds to purchase land for an intended state asylum. In 1847, Gaustad outside Christiania (now Oslo) submitted a plan and in 1850 it was formally decided that the institution should be built there. Gaustad Hospital was not completed until 1855, after the death of Herman Wedel Major. In 1850, Major married Ida Cathrine Grüning (1821-1854). They had two daughters. He and his family all died in the ship collision between the American Paddle steamer SS Arctic and the French steamship SS Vesta on 26 September 1854 off the coast of Newfoundland."

  "text" : "Hunegnaw Mesfin (born 31 January 1989 in Gojjam, Amhara Region) is an Ethiopian long-distance runner who competes in cross country and track running events. He has represented his country at the IAAF World Cross Country Championships and won medals in the senior and junior team categories. Mesfin won his first major medal at the 2007 African Junior Championships in Athletics, taking the 10,000 metres silver medal behind Kenya's Mathew Kisorio. His first year of global competition came in 2008. He was eleventh in the junior race at the 2008 IAAF World Cross Country Championships – a performance which helped Ethiopia to the team silver medals. He just missed out on a medal at the 2008 World Junior Championships in Athletics, finishing fourth behind fellow Ethiopian Ibrahim Jeilan. He competed for Ethiopia at the International Chiba Ekiden and won his race stage, helping the national team to the title. He ended the year with a third-place finish at the inaugural Bahir Dar Cross Country. Mesfin started 2009 with a win at the Sululta Cross Country in the junior section. He competed as a senior at the 2009 IAAF World Cross Country Championships, however, and his tenth-place performance brought the Ethiopian men second place in the team rankings. He began to compete on the senior European cross country circuit at the end of that year and took a significant victory at the Cross Internacional Zornotza in January 2010, coming out on top of a photo finish with Gebre Gebremariam, the reigning world champion. He celebrated his 21st birthday with a second high-profile victory, this time at the Cinque Mulini. In spite of these performances, he failed to match his placing of the previous year at the 2010 IAAF World Cross Country Championships, where he ended the race in the nineteenth place as Ethiopia took the bronze behind Kenya and Eritrea. He gave a strong performance at the Jan Meda Cross Country in February 2011, surprising the more established Imane Merga with a burst of speed to win his first national senior title. However, it was his compatriot who took the title at the 2011 IAAF World Cross Country Championships while Mesfin faded in the latter stages and came eighth, although he and Imane led the Ethiopian's to second in the team rankings. He began to compete on the European road circuit that year and was third at the Giro Media Blenio 10K in April, setting a time of 28:33 minutes. He ran a 5000 m personal best of 13:38.92 minutes at the Athletissima meet in June and made his debut over the half marathon at the Udine Half Marathon, coming sixth in a time of 1:02:00 hours. At the Cross Zornotza in 2012 he took third place. His 2011/2012 cross country season began with a third-place finish at the Cross de Atapuerca."

  "text" : "Herbert Gerigk (2 March 1905, Mannheim – 20 June 1996, Dortmund) was a German musicologist, notable for his co-authoring of the Nazi Lexicon of Jews in Music. After graduation in 1928, Herbert Gerigk published in 1932 a thesis on Giuseppe Verdi. It was the first important musicological overall presentation of Verdi in Germany and appeared in the series \"The Great Masters of Music.\" Gerigk joined the Nazi Party in 1932 and joined the SA in 1933. From 1935 he worked in the National Socialist German Reich as \"head the music section for the monitoring of the intellectual and ideological training and education of the Nazi Party\". In 1935 he joined the SS. Gerigk took over the planning of the music policy of Alfred Rosenberg and was responsible for its implementation in the Rosenberg's office. This policy was to suppress Jewish representation in musical life by removing Jews from their positions and stopping the spread of new music. Gerigk's most famous work was the antisemitic concoction Lexicon of Jews in Music , which he edited in collaboration with Theophil Stengel , Speaker of the Reich Music Chamber. The aim of the work was to prevent 'accidental' performances of works by Jewish and part-Jewish composers, to identify all Jewish music practitioners, but particularly to devalue composers fixed in the German musical tradition such as Felix Mendelssohn, Giacomo Meyerbeer and Gustav Mahler, through lies and deliberate falsification. During the Second World War Gerigk took a leading role in the persecution of Jews. He headed the Office of Music in Einsatzstab Reichsleiter Rosenberg, and was a driving force in all activities of the 'Music Special Staff' in occupied countries. The activity included the plunder of cultural property in the occupied countries and its transport to Germany. In occupied France alone, Gerigk's investigators carried out roberries over two years from 34,500 Jewish houses or apartments, including those of Emmerich Kálmán , Darius Milhaud , Fernand Halphen, Arno Poldes, and Gregor Piatigorsky. Of the machinery of destruction of the Holocaust , Gerigk wrote in 1942: \"The question must be raised as to whether it is appropriate, given the liquidation of European Jewry, to permit Jewish half-breeds as cultural workers in any form.\" In 1943 he became chief editor of the music magazine promoted by Rosenberg, Music in War; in 1944 he was promoted to SS-Hauptsturmführer. After the Second World War Gerigk was never brought to justice for his complicity in the Holocaust. Although his Nazi past prevented an academic career, he worked as a music critic was at the Dortmund Ruhr-Nachrichten. In 1954 he wrote a Dictionary of Music, which was issued by the same firm (Bernhard Hahnefeld) that had published him during the Nazi era."

Kuypers became a member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1980, this was changed into a foreign membership in 1984. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1986, his candidature citation reading \" Distinguished for his microanatomical mapping of the neuronal networks which interconnect particular areas of the neocortex with one another and with the thalamus, brainstem and spinal cord, especially in primates. His studies have involved the correlation of focal lesions in the brain with subtle disorders of motor performance, previously undetected but now exposed and analysed in ingenious behavioural experiments. He has made adventurous use of new microanatomical methods, invented or improved by himself, in order to examine descending pathways in the brainstem, such as the double labelling of cortical neurones by fluorescent dyes with different excitation wavelengths and chemical affinities, transported by axoplasmic flow in a retrograde direction from separately injected termini. The discoveries thus made through a powerful combination of complementary techniques have stimulated much behavioural and micro-physiological experimentation in his own and other laboratories\". He died in Cambridge in 1989. He had married M.F. (Toetie) Sharp, with whom he had four daughters and two sons."

  "text" : "Harmen van Bol'es (Amsterdam 1689 - Saint-Petersburg 1764) was a royal master builder in Russia. Harmen's father was the travelling windmill builder, originating from a family of carpenters from South Holland, the Netherlands. Grandfather Harmen established himself as a carpenter in the village Bolnes, the origin of the family name. When Cornelis was appointed Town Carpenter in Schiedam in 1690 the family moved there. In his youth Harmen was taught by his father, the City Architect, but he did not follow in his footsteps; his younger brother, Arij van Bol'es became City Architect in 1724. This function was filled by his descendants until 1827. On 26 April 1713 Harmen van Bol'es signed a contract in The Hague entering into the service of Tsar Peter the Great of Russia. In 1703 Tsar Peter had established Saint Petersburg at the mouth of the Neva River. This proposed new capital was to become the modern window on the western world but in 1713 it was not much more than a mud pool. Design and construction required skilled westerners including those from the much admired by the Tsar, Republic of the Seven United Netherlands. The difficult and dangerous work was primarily performed by Russian forced labour. Van Bol'es soon became a success in Saint Petersburg thanks in part to the friendship and patronage of his old Swiss colleague Domenico Trezzini. Along with furniture (based on the original repertoire of his forefathers) for the royal palaces he also designed and built many structures in the city. Amongst these were typical Dutch specialities such as drawbridges, sluices, windmills and canals. He enhanced the Summer Gardens with fountains which were fed by a complex network of underground water tanks. He was also involved in large infrastructure projects around Saint Petersburg. In modern Saint Petersburg he is most famous for the tower spires he specialised in, including the spires of the Peter and Paul Fortress. The wind vane in the form of a ship designed by van Bol'es shines on top of the thin spire of the Admiralty Building on the Nevsky Prospect, the city's main street. The three-masted ship has become an emblem of the city of Saint Petersburg and is said to represent the Russian frigate Oryol. Harmen van Bol'es married twice and fathered at least twelve children in Saint Petersburg. His oldest son Cornelis, from his first marriage to Elisabeth Geldorp, returned to Schiedam. His second son Anthony was appointed as royal servant (probably in a construction capacity) of the court in Moscow. He died there in 1746. In a reference from 1750 Harmen is named as \"her Royal Majesty's Master Builder of Saint Petersburg\". The oldest son from his second marriage to Catharina Potter, also Cornelis, appears to have followed in this function after Harmen's death in 1764. Cornelis (the younger) van Bol'es died in Saint Petersburg in 1771."

  "text" : "Henryk Gold (1902 – 9 January 1977 in New York, United States) was a Polish Jewish composer, arranger, and orchestra director. He was born in Warsaw to a musical family: his mother Helena was of the famous Warsaw klezmer Melodysta family, and his father Michael was a flautist in the Warsaw Opera Orchestra. He was the brother of Artur Gold. He studied in Warsaw, his teachers including Stanisław Barcewicz (violin). When silent movies in Poland lost popularity following the arrival of Al Jolson's The Jazz Singer, (known in Yiddish as The Singing Buffoon), thousands of Polish musicians who'd played in the movie theaters lost their livelihood; they began to create large and small orchestras playing dance music and jazz. Artur and Henryk Gold, the brothers Jerzy and Stanislaw Petersburski, Zygmunt Karasinski and Szymon Kataszek, Kazimierz Englard, Julian Halicki were the pioneers; Henryk Gold was chief among them, giving concerts at the famous Ziemiańska Cafe on Kredytowa Street and the revue theater “Morskie-Oko” on Sienkiewicz Street. He ran the nightclub “Adria” with his brother on Moniuszki Street. Gold wrote hundreds of tangos, polkas, foxtrots, and waltzes, interpolating Jewish motifs. His hits included Tęsknota (Nostalgia, in Yiddish Benkshaft); Jaśminy (Jasmine); Jak ja się dziś upiję (When I Get Drunk Today, in Yiddish Az 'Khvel Mikh Haynt Onshikirn); Moja pierswsza i ostatnia (My First and Last, Yiddish Mayn Ershte Un Letste); Szkoda twoich łez (Too bad about your tears, Yiddish A Shod Dayne Trern), and others. During the Second World War, he and fellow composer Jerzy Petersburski toured the Soviet Union with a large jazz orchestra. In 1942 he left the Soviet Union with the Polish Anders Army, went to Israel, where he wrote songs \"Arcenu ha-ktantonet\", \"Ruakh\", \"Shalom\" and lastly emigrated to New York, United States."

  "text" : "Henry Thingstad (9 April 1916 – 19 May 1943) was a Norwegian sports official and communist resistance member. He was born in Trondhjem to a mother from Skogn and a father from Tynset. Both died before Thingstad turned twenty. He was a watchmaker by profession. Before the Second World War he was active in the workers' sports club Arbeidernes TF and the Workers' Confederation of Sports. He chaired the district workers' sports organization in Sør-Trøndelag from 1938 to 1940. He also chaired the workers' sports club SK Ørnulf. In 1939 he supported the merger between the workers' and bourgeois sports organizations, in order to create a unity front against fascism. He had been a member of the Young Communist League of Norway since 1931. During the occupation of Norway by Nazi Germany, Thingstad was one of the first to participate in the Norwegian resistance movement in Trøndelag, with the \"Thingstad Group\". His resistance activity was communist by nature, spurred by the banning of the Communist Party of Norway in August 1940. The Nazis had an active provocateur and infiltrator in Trøndelag, Henry Rinnan, who managed to unveil most of the communist resistance leaders in the district in October and November 1941. Thingstad had then participated in a failed assassination attempt on Rinnan. From early 1942 Thingstad became a part of the district leadership and underground central committee of the Communist Party. Thingstad was captured in February 1943 after involvement from Rinnan. He was subjected to torture. He was imprisoned in Vollan concentration camp. A German court-martial sentenced him to death on 4 May 1943, and he was executed at Kristiansten Fortress together with ten other people on 19 May. His body was not disposed of, but buried in the Nidaros Cathedral graveyard. Tore Pryser's book Klassen og nasjonen 1935-1946 featured a goodbye letter Thingstad wrote in his cell."

His simplicity led him to take the part of Archbishop William of Corbeuil in a dispute he had with the convent in 1136 about the church of St. Martin at Dover. He died 11 May 1137. The name Elmer is evidently a corruption of the old English name Æthelmær. Leland saw two works by him, a book of homilies and a treatise, ‘De exercitiis spiritualis vitæ.’ The report on the Cottonian Library has under Otho A. xii. ‘Ælmeri monachi ecclesiæ Christi Cantuariensis epistolæ, in quibus tractat de munditia cordis, . . . et querimonia de absentia metus Dei. Liber asceticus et vere pius;’ 100 f.

He was raised in a Chasidic home and studied with cantors from the age of 9. He soon began composing, directing choirs, and singing as a Hazzan himself. At the age of 16 he joined Yuvelir's troupe in Galicia, acting, singing in the chorus, and writing songs for their repertoire. In 1896 he was brought to America to teach; he soon began writing for several theater troupes. He partnered with Aaron (Arnold) Perlmutter and over the course of 16 years they wrote music for many operettas including Mezinke, Bnei Israel, Yakov un Esau, and dozens of others by Moshe Hurwitz (Horowitz), Anshel Shor's Di Almoneh (The Widow) and A mentsh zol men zayn (One should be a decent person) also Motashevski's Dos Pintele Yid, Di neshomah fun mayn folk, and Di Poylishe Khasene.

For many years he conducted the choir for the most widely acclaimed and revered cantor of the time—and probably of all time—Yossele Rosenblatt. His many cantorial-choral compositions for Sabbath, High Holy Days, and Festivals remain in manuscript, and the whereabouts of many of these are not even known. He died in 1936."

  "text" : "Henech Kon or Henryk Kon (1890–1972) was a Polish cabaret performer. Kon was born in Łódź to a Chassidic family, and sent at the age of 12 to his grandfather in Kutno, where he studied Torah but also studied with local klezmers, absorbing folk music from players and badkhonim. When his family realized he would never be a rabbi, they sent him to music school in Berlin. In 1912 he returned to Poland where he was drawn into literary artistic circles of Jewish Warsaw, particularly the \"artistic culture salon\" of the famous Polish actress Tea Artsishevska (née Miryam Isroels), later a member of the revi-teater Azazel. Her then husband, sculptor Bernard Kratko, introduced Kon to Isaac Leib Peretz and Kon set several of Peretz's works to music, including Treyst mayn folk (Comfort My People) and the play Bay nakht oyfn alten mark (A Night in the Old Marketplace). In 1922 \"proletarian Lodz was tired of earnest dramas and light comedies.\" Responding to the new popularity of satire, Kon - with poet Moishe Broderzon and painter Yitschok Broyner - created the marionette theater Chad-Gadya, the first of a string of revi-teaters (venues for music theater revues) in Polish towns and cities. \"Henekh Kon was Moyshe Broderson's closest collaborator, building with him all the kleynkunst theaters in Poland: the marionette-theater Khad-Gadye (1922) in Lodz, the kleynkunst theater Azazel (1925) in Warsaw, Sambatiyon (1926) and Azazel (1927). His was the musical spirit behind all of them.\" He later was also closely associated with the kleynkunst (small art) venue Ararat. He composed music for around 40 theater productions. including Sholem Asch's Kiddush ha-Shem, Shakespeare's Shylock, Aaron Zeitlin (Tseytlin)'s Yidnshtot, Moshe Lipshitz' Hershele Ostropolyer, Dovid Bergelson's Di broytmil (The bread mill), H. Leyvik's Der Golem, and many others. His opera David and Batsheba was written (with Moshe Broderson) and presented in Warsaw in 1924. Kon himself sang in the production, as did Moshe Shneur's chorus. He is strongly associated with the Warsaw Yung-teater, the Yiddish avant-garde theater company which emerged from Michal Weichert's Yiddish Theater Studio. He wrote the music for Boston, about Sacco and Vanzetti, Trupe Tanentzap, an Abraham Goldfaden spectacle, Napoleon's Treasure, based on a Sholem Aleichem story, and many others. After the Second World War Kon worked with the Yiddish Art Theater in Paris. Beginning in 1934 Henech Kon also worked in film; he composed the music for The Dibbuk and Zygmund Turkow's Di freylekhe kabtsonim (The Jolly Paupers) among others. He moved to America, where he was never particularly successful, and died in New York City."

He was subject to a fine in the aftermath of the English Civil War. Compton lived at Brambletye, Sussex. He died in or before July 1649, because on that date the committee for compounding ordered that the balance of his fine should be paid by the heirs to his estate. Compton married firstly Cecily Sackville, daughter of Robert Sackville, 2nd Earl of Dorset and had three sons and three daughters. He married secondly Mary Browne, daughter of Sir George Browne of Battle, Sussex and had four sons and two daughters."

  "text" : "Holly Hill is the Australian bestselling author of Sugarbabe and Toyboy, memoirs originally published by Random House Australia in 2007 and 2008. Sugarbabe was later published in New York 2010 by Skyhorse Publishing generating a media storm, including guest appearances on CNN, Larry King, Dr Phil, 60 Minutes and Playboy Radio. Hill was born in 1966 in Canberra, Australia. She went to public schools and started out as a cadet journalist with the Port Macquarie News. She later went to the University of Southern Queensland in Toowoomba and graduated in 1990 with an Arts degree in Human Behaviour. Hill moved to Sydney and was the state coordinator of the Schizophrenia Fellowship of NSW before stepping sideways into public relations at the University of Sydney and Australian Financial Markets Association, before returning to Port Macquarie in 1998 as a Public Relations Manager for Country Energy. Her father, Geoffrey William Hill, 64, was killed in his Gold Coast home in January 1999 by his estranged wife, Erlinda Rosal Hill, 52, of Surfers Paradise. She was found guilty of manslaughter on 29 May 2001 of what she claimed to be a planned double suicide. Hill shattered her right leg and ankle in a skydiving accident on 23 December 2000 and fought much of her father’s case from her hospital bed. She spent two years on crutches and gained employment in May 2003 with her rehabilitator, CRS Australia. She worked with a variety of clients suffering physical and mental injuries and transferred to Blacktown CRS in Sydney’s western suburbs in June 2005. She quit work in December of the same year at the behest of her wealthy lover, ‘John’ and the ensuing events are detailed in her memoirs, Sugarbabe and Toyboy. Hill’s term, ‘negotiated infidelity’ sparked passionate debate on talkback radio and chatrooms, with thousands of comments by enraged monogamists and supporters alike. However, in April 2012 Holly retracted her notion of \"negotiated infidelity\", saying it emasculates men and makes women feel insecure. Hill and her then partner, Charles Philip Dean, conducted a four-year ‘road test’ of the lifestyle as research for her third memoir, The Velvet Pouch (HarperCollins April 2013) and Hill now says any infidelity must be the “exception and not the rule” and she has reversed the notion, calling it negotiated FIDELITY instead. She states: “Whilst we know that monogamy hasn't worked for at least fifty percent of couples and has been scientifically discredited in books such as ‘Sex at Dawn’, it must still remain as a collaborative option in our relationship repertoire. Negotiated fidelity is about defining a couple's unique sexual boundaries for their ongoing relationship and is part of the notion of having UNCONDITIONED LOVE. Unlike traditional concepts of human love, unconditioned love also recognizes our hardwired aspects, such as chemistry, pathology, gender differences, sexuality, inherited fetishes and hormones.\""

  "text" : "Harold D. Schuster ( August 1, 1902 – July 19, 1986) was an American editor and film director. In 1937 he made Wings of the Morning, the first-ever three-strip Technicolor film shot in Europe. While the majority of Schuster's directorial output can be considered routine, there are two acknowledged gems among them. His 1954 film noir thriller Loophole is a fast-paced, well-acted drama about a bank teller framed for a $50,000 embezzlement and his efforts to clear his name, and his 1957 Dragoon Wells Massacre is, despite its potboiler title, an actionful, tightly made western with some surprising plot twists in which many of the characters aren't quite what they seem to be."

Dowden was the daughter of the Irish literary scholar Edward Dowden. She used both her maiden name and her married name Hester Travers Smith. Her husband was a prominent Dublin physician. Dowden was closely linked to the Irish literary world through her father, knowing, among others W.B. Yeats and Bram Stoker. She was probably the model for the medium in Yeats's play, The Words upon the Window Pane. Her daughter married the playwright Lennox Robinson. Though she wrote only two books under her own name, her spirit-communications provided the basis for approximately twelve books published by other authors."

  "text" : "Heather Jansch (born Heather Rosemary Sewell) is a British sculptor notable for making life-sized sculptures of horses from driftwood. She has also used cork as a material in her creations. Jansch reported that she struggled in her youth in schools, but had a passion for drawing and horses. While an art student at Walthamstow College of Art in 1967 she met the musician Roy Harper. It was Harper who introduced her to the guitarist Bert Jansch, who she later married. She bought a smaller hill farm, breeding Welsh cobs and specializing in painting traditional equestrian portraits until starting to sculpt. She later moved to south Devon. By 1986 she was exhibiting sculpture regularly with Courcoux and Courcoux, a leading provincial contemporary gallery then based in Salisbury who took her work to the London Contemporary Art Fair where it received very favourable reviews. Her life-size driftwood horses became her hall mark and in 1999 were featured in the Shape of the Century 100 years of Sculpture in Britain at Salisbury Cathedral. The exhibition was then taken to London’s Canary Wharf as part of the millennium celebrations in 2000 where her horses caught the attention of Tim Smit KBE founder of the Eden Project and she was invited to become one of their resident artists. Her horse was voted the most popular art work there and has since become widely known as The Eden Horse. By 2001 she was casting works in bronze and had bought a small converted Coach House in fourteen acres of steep woodland with two acres of water-meadow and a stream where she began to explore site specific sculpture and over the next decade created a sculpture garden which in 2008 was included in The National Gardens Scheme's Yellow Book. The house was extended to include a gallery. In 2009 she set up Olchard Press. She published Heather Jansch's Diary. A reviewer in Britain's Daily Mail commented regarding her driftwood horses: Her sculptures can cost up to £55,000 each and take three years to produce."

In 1917 Bieling founded an artistic group called De Branding (The Surf or The Breakers in Dutch). Other members included Laurens van Kuik, Ger ladage (aka Gerwhl), Bernard Toon Gits, Jan Sirks and Wim Schmacher. Their aim was to exhibit and promote the new modern art in the Netherlands. They had many links with other art groups including De Stijl and Der Sturm. Bieling organized many modern art shows. These shows included paintings by himself and many modern artists including Otto Gleichmann, Kurt Schwitters, Constantin Brâncuși, and Piet Mondriaan."

Rall authored 24 books in the fields of theology and biblical studies including Teachings of Jesus, New Testament History, Christianity, an Inquiry into Its Nature and Truth, and A Working Faith. His work on the teachings of Jesus reflected the values of early liberalism. Rall died in 1964 at the age of 94."

  "text" : "Henry Watson Edmondson (25 November 1872 – 18 August 1946) was an Australian rules footballer who played with Perth in the Western Australian Football Association (WAFA). He also played first-class cricket for Western Australia. Edmondson was already 29 when he started his WAFA career, in 1902. In his first season he was Perth's leading goal-kicker and he was the full-forward in their 1907 premiership team, which won the grand final on appeal. He kicked two goals on grand final day, the only multiple goal-kicker on either team, in what was his final league appearance. He played most of his interstate cricket after retiring from football but participated in one first-class match in 1905/06, as a bowler. In 1912/13, Edmond both played in and was manager of the Western Australia team which toured the country. On this occasion he was used as a top order batsman and scored two half centuries, the best of which was 68 against New South Wales. Against South Australia in Adelaide, Edmondson acted as his side's wicket-keeper in the second innings as usual gloveman Harold Evers was injured. In Sydney, Edmondson got a pair against New South Wales but also got the biggest wicket of his career, that of Victor Trumper. He finished with career with 194 runs at 17.63 and four wickets at 56.50, from six first-class matches."

In 1660, Westfaling was elected Member of Parliament for Hereford in the Convention Parliament. In 1661 he fought a highly contentious election for the Cavalier Parliament. Sir Henry Lingen, the other member, sought to replace Westfaling by his friend Sir Edward Hopton and gained control of the corporation before the royalist councillors were restored. The mayor created 80 freemen from Lingen's supporters and refused to do likewise for Westfaling. Lingen was returned unopposed, but Westfaling demanded a poll against Hopton. The mayor was detained in the Guild Hall on the first day and refused to go to the poll on the second day, declaring Hopton elected from Hopton's House. Westfaling persuaded the sheriff to take another return and Hopton topped the poll but with what turned out to be a number of invalid votes. Hopton was allowed to sit but the matter was referred to the elections committee. Sir Job Charlton noted that \"there was a very strange carriage and some disturbance in the elections\" and recommended Hopton be unseated. However parliament declared the election void, and Lingen and Westfaling were returned at the by-election. Westfaling sat until 1679. Westfaling was mayor of Hereford in 1683. Westfaling died at the age of 75. Westfaling married Ann Edwards daughter of Sir Thomas Edwards."

  "text" : "Henry Ibbot Field (Bath, 6 December 1797 – Bath, 19 May 1848), was an English pianist. Field was born at Bath on 6 December 1797, was the son of Thomas Field, for many years the organist at Bath Abbey, by his wife, Mary Harvey, who died 15 June 1815. The father died 21 December 1831. Henry was the eldest of a family of seven children. He was educated first at Holdstock's Academy, and afterwards at the Bath Grammar School. At a very early age he showed his aptitude for music. He was taught by his father, and afterwards by James Morris Coombs, the organist of Chippenham. In 1807, being then just ten years of age, he performed for the first time in public, in a duet with his father. On 15 June 1830 he played with Johann Hummel, in the latter's Grand Sonata, op. 92. He was a virtuoso performer, and known throughout his career as a musical instructor. He was popular in his native city, and generally known as 'Field of Bath'. Field was an acquaintance of Charles-Valentin Alkan, and played the premiere of the latter's 'Second Concerto da camera', which was dedicated to him, at Bath in 1834 during Alkan's first visit to England. He was a good scholar in French, Italian, Spanish, and German. While working as teacher of music at Prior Park College, Field in 1835 was converted to Catholicism by the Rev. Dr. Gentili. He was formally received into that church by Bishop Baines during the winter of that year. He gave his last concert on 13 May 1848, in the Bath Assembly Rooms. Whilst playing Wallace's Cracovienne he was suddenly struck down by a paralytic seizure. He died on 19 May 1848, aged 50, at the house of his brother Frederick, the surgeon, in Northumberland Buildings."

Duncan became interested in cycling during his time at Taplow College, and in 1878 he joined the Belgrave Bicycle Club determined to make a career in the sport. He became a well-known cycling journalist and later founded the Motor Review. Duncan was recruited by H. J. Lawson to become commercial manager of the British Motor Syndicate (BMS), an early automobile manufacturer. In that role he organised the first ever British motor exhibition in 1896, at the Imperial Institute in South Kensington, London. After the BMS's failure in 1897 Duncan moved to France, then the leading manufacturer of automobiles in Europe, and took over the management of de Dion-Bouton from 1898 until 1916. He subsequently returned to London, where he became the company's British Empire representative. Duncan published his memoirs in 1926 under the title The World on Wheels. He died in France in 1945."

  "text" : "Professor Herbert George Andrewartha, BS (UWA), MAgSc (Melb), DSc (Adel), FAA, (21 December 1907 – 27 January 1992) was a distinguished Australian research scientist in the fields of entomology, biology, zoology and animal ecology. In the twentieth century, Andrewartha became the most influential Australian ecologist, and best known for attributing density-independent forces, such as weather, to be even more important than density-dependent factors in influencing population regulation. In 1933, Andrewartha began his studies on apple thrips, Thrips imagines, but later transitioned his studies to the plague grasshopper, Austroicetes, when he moved to Adelaide in 1935. This led to his first publication with his former student Charles Birch in 1941, “The influence of weather on grasshopper plagues in South Australia”. In 1945, when his mentor James Davidson died, Andrewartha inherited fifteen years of data collected on thrips population. After several years of statistical analysis of these data, Andrewartha and Birch demonstrated strong connections between physiology, population levels, and other environment factors and this led to the publication of two major books, The Distribution and Abundance of Animals (1954) and The Ecological Web (1984). Through this work, Andrewartha and Birch found a new school of population ecology, which emphasized the role of environmental controls as opposed to community-dependent approach based on density-dependent factors. The joint work of Andrewartha and Birch helped them earned the Eminent Ecologist Award, which had never been presented jointly to two persons previously from the Ecological Society of America.

Bill Picklehaupt's story  tells the story accurately and in historical context. Miss Laugenour capitalized on her international fame by making several movies ( one of which the National Film Archives still has in its collection ) and touring the country to promote the movies with an elaborate presentation which included a very large transparent swimming tank, complete with pump motor to approximate tidal conditions. As she was preparing to swim The English Channel, World War I broke out, ending that ambition. She married Timothy Edmund Fogg (also of the University of California at Berkeley in Mining Engineering and a Sigma Chi) and had a daughter, Joan Fogg.

  "text" : "Humphrey Forman (26 April 1888 – 21 May 1923) played first-class cricket in two matches, one each for Cambridge University and Somerset in the 1910 cricket season. He was born at Repton, Derbyshire and died at Bangkok in Thailand. Humphrey Forman was the son of Arthur Forman, a master at Repton School and himself a first-class cricketer for Derbyshire County Cricket Club. Humphrey was educated at Shrewsbury School. As a first-class cricketer, he was a lower-order batsman and a left-arm medium-pace bowler. He was quite successful as a bowler in his one first-class match at Cambridge University, taking four Kent wickets for 62 runs, more wickets than any other Cambridge bowler. He played a second match for Cambridge a week later against the Free Foresters; this match was not classed as first-class (though many such fixtures between these teams were in other years), but in any case Forman was not successful. In his solitary match for Somerset later in the same season, he opened the bowling but took only one wicket in the match."

  "text" : "Huda Ben Amer (in Arabic هدى بن عامر) is a former Libyan politician. A follower of the Libyan ruler, Colonel Muammar Gaddafi, she was the Secretary of the General People's Congress of Inspection People's Control and mayor of Benghazi until the Libyan Civil War. Ben Amer was born in Marj near Benghazi and attended the Garyounis University in Benghazi. Belonging to a poor family without influence, Ben Amer rose to national prominence at a public execution staged by the Gaddafi government in 1984. The event in Benghazi's basketball stadium had been announced as the trial of one of Gaddafi's political enemies, al-Sadek Hamed Al-Shuwehdy, an engineer who had been peacefully campaigning against the colonel's rule. But instead the schoolchildren and students who had been assembled for the purpose were made to see al-Shuwehdy's execution by hanging. While the hanged man writhed on the gallows, Ben Amer stepped forward and grabbed al-Shuwehdy's legs, pulling him down until he stopped struggling and died. That display of ruthlessness, about which she later liked to boast—she is remembered in Benghazi by her saying \"we don't need talking, we need hangings\"—earned her the enduring loathing of the people of Benghazi and the nickname Huda Al-Shannaga—\"Huda the Executioner\". However, it impressed Gaddafi, who had been watching the execution on live TV. He subsequently promoted Ben Amer to high government posts, including twice mayor of Benghazi and a leading member of the Legion Thoria, Gaddafi's organization of revolutionary committees. Eventually she became a favorite of Gaddafi, and one of the richest and most powerful women in Libya. In the course of the national uprising in early 2011, a crowd stormed Ben Amer's sprawling mansion in Benghazi and, finding her gone, burned it to the ground. Later in March 2011, she was seen next to Gaddafi on one of his televised addresses. On 2 September 2011, Guma el-Gamaty, the UK coordinator of the National Transitional Council posted on Twitter that Ben Amer had been arrested in Tripoli by NTC forces."

  "text" : "Heinz Ebert (Saxony, Germany, October 13, 1907, – 1983, Rio Claro, São Paulo) was a German-Brazilian geologist, naturalist, and educator. Ebert had his basic training in chemistry, physics, and analytical chemistry and natural sciences and served as geologist at the Geological Survey of Prussia. He was obtained his PhD at the University of Leipzig, where he became an associate professor in 1934. He worked on petrography at the Geological Survey of Saxony and developed methods to recognize stratigraphic sequences by petrographic and structural analysis. From 1939 to 1946, World War II interrupted his geological activity. After the war he returned to geology and opened an office for applied geology (groundwater, drilling, economic geology, geology for dams, etc.) He moved to Recife in 1950 and was influential in creating the CAGE (Campaign for Training Geologists). From 1950 to 1956, he was a \"specialized geologist\" at the Division of Geology and Mineralogy, which evolved from the old Geological Survey of Brazil, and mapped the regions of São João del Rei, Juiz de Fora, and Barbacena, a whole complex metasedimentary southern region of Minas Gerais. He was director of Sudene, training technicians in areas of groundwater in crystalline rocks. In 1962 he moved to Rio Claro, São Paulo, to teach various subjects in the field of geosciences at the Faculty of Philosophy, Sciences and Letters of the Universidade Estadual Paulista Júlio de Mesquita Filho, assisting in the creation of the geology course. He continued his studies with attention to the south and southwest of the state of Minas Gerais. He made several trips abroad, bringing to Brazil contributions of his observations and contacts. He had many students, many of them becoming professors and continuing his work, especially in teaching mineralogy, petrology, structural geology, and the creation and maintenance of the Museum of Minerals and Rocks \"Heinz Ebert\". This museum has a vast collection that Ebert donated, including many didactic collections. Ebert formed in Recife more graduate students. He published around 60 works on geosciences, especially of Brazil. Between 1977 and 1980 he also collaborated with the course of geology at the Universidade Federal de Mato Grosso. In 1974, Ebert won the Jose Bonifacio Gold Medal of the Sociedade Brasileira de Geologia, the highest prize in Brazilian geology. As a naturalist, Ebert had a passion for butterfly collection. He died in 1983, in Rio Claro, Brazil."

  "text" : "Hezekiah Holland (born ca. 1617, living 1660) was an Anglo-Irish Anglican clergyman, tending towards Puritanism. He used the pen name Anglo-Hibernus. Probably born in Ireland, in 1638 Holland graduated Bachelor of Arts at Trinity College, Dublin, as Ezekias Holland, and he migrated to England in about 1644. In March 1645, during the First English Civil War, Robert Smith, vicar of Sutton Valence in Kent, was deprived of his living, and Holland was appointed by Parliament to succeed him as minister of the parish. In July 1649, Holland wrote that he had arrived in England as \"a stranger, (a kind of a banished man) out of Ireland... five years ago I came out of that Kingdom into this\". Before long, the General Baptists were gathering a large number of adherents in Kent, and Holland found that he needed to take part in religious controversy with George Hammon, preacher of Biddenden, one of the Baptist leaders. In his work An exposition or, A short, but full, plaine, and perfect epitome of the most choice commentaries upon the Revelation of Saint John, published in 1650, Holland reckoned that the end of the World and the Day of Judgment were 216 years away. Despite its title, this work generally follows the commentary of the German theologian David Pareus (1548–1622), whose work on the Revelation of Saint John the Divine had been translated into English by Elias Arnold, but Holland relied also on the work of Saint Augustine, Thomas Brightman, and the Swiss reformer Heinrich Bullinger. George Hammon replied to Holland in Truth and Innocency, Prevailing against Error and Insolency (1660), a work which sought to defend the thnetopsychist view of humanity. In Adam's Condition in Paradise Discovered (1656), Holland addressed his opponent Hammon, remarking \"you have gotten into great repute with those who know not how to contradict you\". Hammon, in a work dated 1660, refers to Holland as being still at Sutton Valence, but this was the year of the Restoration of the monarchy, after which no further traces of Holland have been found. His ultimate fate is unknown."

In 2001 he started the H+F Collection of contemporary art, which consists of photographs, videos, installations and paintings by – among others – Jeff Wall, Sam Taylor-Wood, Bill Viola, Shirin Neshat and Felix Gonzalez-Torres. Nefkens places them on long-term loan to museums in the Netherlands and abroad, including the Centraal Museum in Utrecht, Rotterdam’s Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen and FRAC Nord-Pas de Calais in Dunkirk. In 2006, Nefkens set up ArtAids, a foundation that uses art in order to increase awareness of HIV/AIDS and improve the lives of people living with HIV. In addition to being a collector and patron of the arts, Nefkens is also a writer. His first book, Bloedverwanten (Blood Brothers; 1995), is a semi-autobiographical novel about two brothers who are both infected with the AIDS virus. This was followed by a collection of short pieces, Twee lege stoelen (Two Empty Chairs; 2005). The book De Gevlogen Vogel notities over een herwonnen leven (Borrowed Time: Notes on a Recovered Life), which was published in 2008 and has been translated into Spanish, is a report of the lengthy recovery process of Nefkens' HIV induced encephalitis. ‘Giving is one of the most underrated values in society,’ Nefkens says. ‘By setting up something that I can share with others, I become part of the world. Sharing is the antidote to loneliness, when you share you are not alone.’"

  "text" : "Harvey Oxenhorn (1952 – May 16, 1990) was an American academic and author most famous for writing the book, Tuning the Rig. He was the Director of the Public Policy Communications Program at Harvard University. Oxenhorn was born in New York City. He got a Bachelor of Arts degree at Swarthmore College and a Doctorate in English from Stanford University. His thesis was entitled \"Elemental Things: The Poetry of Hugh MacDiarmid\". He taught at both Stanford and Tufts University before accepting a position at Harvard, first as an instructor, and then as Director in 1983. In addition to nonfiction, he also wrote poetry. His work has been included in such publications as The Atlantic, Ploughshares, and The Southern Review. He spent a considerable amount of time in writer's retreats such as the MacDowell Colony and Yaddo. Tuning the Rig, a nonfiction account of Oxenhorn's time at sea on a scientific whaling expedition, was reviewed favorably in many newspapers, including in the Toronto Star, the New York Times, and the Ottawa Citizen. His doctoral thesis was also turned into a book, receiving positive reviews. Oxenhorn was in the process of writing a book about his experiences with teaching children in Kenya at the Yaddo retreat when he died in a car crash in Hillside, New York. His funeral service was held at the Essex Shipbuilding Museum. Oxenhorn's friend, the writer Alice Hoffman, successfully lobbied Zoland Books to republish Tuning the Rig. This latest edition includes an afterword by the Poet Laureate Robert Pinsky. He was the son of the educator and author Joseph Oxenhorn and the brother of the translator and political theorist Mera J. Flaumenhaft."

  "text" : "Henry Baynton (23 September 1892 in Warwick, Warwickshire, England – 2 January 1951 in London) was a British Shakespearean actor and actor-manager of the early 20th century. Baynton made his first theatrical appearance in 1910, commencing a career in which he played in most of the works of William Shakespeare. He joined the company of Oscar Asche in 1911, and later that year joined the company of Frank Benson, for whom he appeared as Hamlet and as Demetrius in A Midsummer Night's Dream (1915). In 1916 Baynton appeared at the Stratford Festival, and in 1917 he joined the theatrical company of H.B. Irving at the Savoy Theatre, playing Laertes to Irving's Hamlet. In 1917 Baynton formed his own theatrical company, with whom he played Orlando in As You Like It, Romeo in Romeo and Juliet, Shylock in The Merchant of Venice, Brutus in Julius Caesar, the title roles in Henry V, Richard III, Hamlet, King Lear and Othello, Bottom in A Midsummer Night's Dream Falstaff, and Petruchio in The Taming of the Shrew. He played the Burgomaster Mathias in The Bells at the Savoy Theatre in 1924. Baynton's performance was not favourably received by the critics, who compared him adversely to Henry Irving, who had made the role his own. Baynton toured the provinces between 1926 and 1930 appearing in the works of Shakespeare and various other plays. He disbanded his theatrical company in 1930, making him among the last of the actor-managers. Baynton appeared in the 1917 film Auld Lang Syne. His final appearance in a Shakespearean role was in 1934 when he played Capulet in Romeo and Juliet. He died in London in 1951 aged 58."

Guitton worked for RTL from 1964 to 1994. On Radio Luxemburg she co-hosted Tag Schatz, Tag Scherz with Jochen Pützenbacher, who later recalled that they worked so well together, there were rumours they were romantically involved. In 1983 she insisted on co-hosting a memorial programme for a colleague who had died of cancer, to give him moral support, but broke down crying. She hosted the weekday evening programme Viva – die Lust, zu leben, which included quizzes and interviews as well as music. In the 1990s she worked for RTL plus, now RTL television; in 1988 she was engaged with Rainer Holbe to moderate a sexy interview show, \"Kopfkissen-Gespräche bei Prominenten\" (Pillow talk with VIPs); she later called these \"Liebe ist...\" interviews her most successful and enjoyable work, while she called Radio Telex her greatest failure. Her 1985 interview with a combative Klaus Kinski, who ate and drank throughout, only half an hour of which was broadcast, appears on the DVD Kinski Talks I, issued by WDR in 2010. On 7 April 1973, she was the presenter for the Eurovision Song Contest. After leaving broadcasting, Guitton became a style and behaviour coach."

  "text" : "Hymie Jacobson, also known as Hy Jacobson (1895–1952), was an American Jewish actor and composer in Yiddish vaudeville, films and theater. Born 1895 in Chicago to actors Joseph and Bessie Jacobson. His sister, Henrietta, married Yiddish theatre actor Julius Adler; his brother, Irving, was also a performer. He and Irving also owned some of the key venues for Yiddish theater in New York City. He played child roles from the age of 4 in Cincinnati. His first adult role was at the Arch Street Theater in Philadelphia (1917) as the comic in Panie Romani. In 1918 he played in the Peoples Theater and the following year was buff-comic (the company buffoon) at the Second Avenue Theater in the Yiddish Theater District. In 1921 he played at Boris Thomashevsky's National Theater, in 1927 at the Public Theater, then in Boston and Chicago. A coupletist, Jacobson composed both music and lyrics to many of the comic songs he sang and played piano to accompany himself. In 1925 and 1929 Nahum Stutchkoff's operetta Two Brides aka A Small Town Wedding featured music by Hymie Jacobson. He starred with his wife Miriam Kressyn in Der purimshpiler. In the 1940s he organized his own orchestra in which Paul Pinkus and the Ellstein brothers played; they accompanied famous singers like Jennie Goldstein. He co-wrote, with his brother Irving, the novelty song A Bisl Fefer, A Bisl Zalts (A little pepper, a little salt). Two of his other songs were Mit Fertsik Yor Tsurik (Forty Years Ago), and Palestina Undzer Heym. He died in 1952 in Miami, Florida."

  "text" : "Homer Marshman (1898-1989) was the first owner of the Cleveland Rams. A prominent Cleveland, Ohio attorney and businessman, he founded the team along with player-coach Damon \"Buzz\" Wetzel in 1936, when it played one successful year in the American Football League, then acquired a National Football League franchise for the team on February 13, 1937. Marshman and the other Rams stockholders paid $10,000 for the NFL franchise, then put up $55,000 to capitalize the new club. The new league was much tougher, however, and the Rams fared poorly on the field. Between 1937 and 1942, the Rams' best finish was third place in the Western Division, with 5 wins and 6 losses in 1942. In June 1941, Marshman and his partners sold the Rams to grocery magnate Daniel Reeves and Frederick Levy, Jr. for about $100,000. In January 1946, after the team finally was successful on the field and just had won the 1945 NFL Championship, Reeves, a New York City native, moved the Rams to Los Angeles. Marshman then became co-owner and secretary of the Cleveland Browns from 1954 to 1962, when he sold his shares in the team to New Yorker Art Modell, who later moved the Browns to Baltimore. This marked the second time Marshman helped to facilitate out-of-town ownership of a Cleveland NFL team that ultimately left the region."

He has curated exhibitions at the Victoria and Albert Museum as well as the Wellcome Collection. Aldersey-Williams is perhaps best known for his 2011 book Periodic Tales, which The Daily Telegraph described as \"a paean to the building blocks of matter\". The book (ISBN 9780061824722) takes a comprehensive look through world history to detail where, how, and why humanity discovered the elements. It also received praise from Kirkus Reviews, which labelled it \"lucid\" and \"enjoyable\". In October 2015 he co-curated an exhibition based on the book at Compton Verney Art Gallery, Periodic Tales: The Art of the Elements, exhibiting predominantly contemporary art works and focusing on the relationship between artistic objects and the elemental materials that go into their making. Aldersey-Williams contributed an essay on Sir Thomas Browne to The Society for Curious Thought."

  "text" : "Howard Garrett, known as \"the Dirt Doctor\" (born 1947) is a radio talk show host and a leader of the Organic movement. He is a health activist, arborist, newspaper columnist and organic activist living in Dallas, Texas. He received his Bachelor of Science degree in Park Administration and Landscape Architecture from Texas Tech University in 1969. After serving in the U.S. Marine Corps Reserve, Garrett worked at Club Corporation of America, where he was a laborer and assistant golf course superintendent. Garrett promotes natural organic programs and products. He opposes the use of toxic chemicals in lawn products and pest control, as well as criticizing some organic products that he believes do not work. He thinks that homeowners, nurseries and landscape companies underestimate the dangers of non-organic solutions, and consults with commercial properties wanting to convert to organic techniques. He has written about the plant-derived insecticide Pyrethrum, which is made from the painted daisy (Chrysanthemum cinerariaefolium or Chrysanthemum coccineum that contain pyrethrin organic compounds which are potent natural insecticides.) One of the common extra ingredients is PBO, which is a synthetic synergist that gives the basic insecticide more killing power. Garrett agrees with the viewpoint of the Journal of Pesticide Reform, which says that in laboratory tests, insecticides made from pyrethrum have: caused tumors in animals; increased the risk of leukemia; disrupted the normal function of sex steroids; and triggered allergic reactions including heart attack and asthma. Texas A&M plant expert Dr. Steven W. George, an associate professor and horticulturist in A&M's Texas AgriLife Extension Service in Dallas, and Dallas radio garden show host Neil Sperry have been tough critics of Garrett's organic approach. Garrett has been the topic in numerous magazines and articles. Garrett runs a website giving information about his approach, and sends out a weekly newsletter to an audience of over 85,000."

  "text" : "Reverend Father Henri Fleisch (1 January 1904 – 10 February 1985) was a French archaeologist, missionary and Orientalist, known for his work on classical Arabic language and Lebanese dialect and prehistory in Lebanon. Fleisch spent years recording and recovering lithics from prehistoric Lebanese archaeological sites and in 1954, it was confirmed that he had discovered and named a previously unknown proto-Neolithic culture in Lebanon called the Qaraoun culture that used a flint industry he termed Heavy Neolithic. Fleisch was born in Jonvelle (Haute-Saône), France. He entered the Society of Jesus in Lyon Fourvière in September 1921 and was ordained a Catholic priest on 24 August 1933, he celebrated his first mass at Jonvelle on August 27. Fleisch was largely self-taught, specialising in oriental studies, for which he earned a doctorate at the Sorbonne in May 1943 with a thesis published on \"Work and Memoirs of the Institute of Ethnology in Paris\". He made many trips abroad and settled in Lebanon, where he discovered in Bikfaya in 1923-1926. He did his military service in Syria and was injured during a confrontation. Mobilized in 1939, he was taken prisoner June 19, 1940 and held at Stalag XII, from where he was released in February 1941. From August 1945 he taught at the \"Institut des Lettres Orientales\" of Saint Joseph University in Beirut. It was here that many of his archaeological finds were stored and in 2000 they formed The Museum of Lebanese Prehistory where many of his finds are stored and displayed. The museum celebrated their tenth anniversary with a posthumous exhibition of Fleisch's photography and work entitled \"Prehistory vs. Urbanization\". He died, aged 81, in Lebanon, where he was buried. He was the author of two hundred forty publications, including the Eastern dialects and was a specialist in Arabic, Greek, Latin, Syriac and Hebrew. He also wrote a small booklet on the French regional patois vocabulary of Jonvelle in 1951. He was the author of the Treaty of Arabic philology in 1961 and 1977. He distinguished himself by combining research prehistory and geology, discovering the site of Naama and carrying out work at Tell Jisr and Ras Beyrouth. Fleisch's most famous works are Introduction à l'Étude des langues sémitiques (1947), L'Arabe classique (1968) and Traité de philologie arabe, 1-2 (1961–79)."

  "text" : "William Horace Bray \"Horrie\" Bant (22 September 1882 – 6 May 1957) was an Australian rules footballer who played with St Kilda and Essendon in the Victorian Football League (VFL). Bant, who played mostly used as a centre half-back and fullback, started and ended his career in Western Australia. He was a member of West Perth's 1905 premiership winning side. He joined St Kilda for the 1906 VFL season and from his debut played 39 consecutive games. This included St Kilda's first ever final in 1907, with Bant the vice-captain. After a season with Essendon in 1910, Bant returned to the West Australian Football League, this time playing for Subiaco. He played in another premiership in 1912 but missed their 1913 premiership win as he spent the season in Victoria with Prahran. Bant then returned to Subiaco and played for them in 1914 but missed another premiership the following year when he didn't play a senior game. He was involved in a fatal traffic accident in 1928 when the truck he was driving missed a corner and collided into a telegraph post. His passenger, former Subiaco teammate and coach Phil Matson, crashed into the pole and died two days later in hospital. Bant himself was injured but survived."

  "text" : "Horacio Echevarrieta Maruri (Basque)(September 15, 1870 – May 20, 1963) was a businessman, banker, industrialist, patron of the arts, politician and diplomatic mediator. In 1927, he founded Iberia Líneas Aéreas de España, S. A. Operadora, now known as Iberia. Born in Bilbao, the son of a mine owner, Cosme Echevarrieta, he expanded his father's activities and set up businesses in many fields, such as the merchant marine, shipbuilding and real estate. He was one of the shareholders of The Niágara Spanish Aerocar Co., Limited which inaugurated the Spanish Aerocar at Niagara Falls, Ontario in 1916. A diputado for the Radical Republicano from 1914 to 1917, in 1916 he bought the liberal paper El Liberal. After being placed under house arrest for his involvement in the 1917 general strike, he stepped down from his post of president of the Chamber of Commerce, gave up his seat in parliament, which was taken over by his political and business ally, Indalecio Prieto, as well as from the leadership of the republicanism that he had inherited from his father. Following Spain's catastrophic defeat at the Battle of Annual in 1921, when 10,000–12,000 Spanish troops died, he acted as a mediator between the Spanish government and Abd el-Krim in freeing the 300 Spanish soldiers captured, for which, as a republican, he is said to have turned down King Alfonso XIII's offer of a title. At his Malaga estate, he played host to visitors like King Alfonso XIII, General Miguel Primo de Rivera and the German naval officer and spymaster Wilhelm Canaris, head of the Abwehr, the German military intelligence service (from 1935 to 1944)."

He was named the Crown Prince of the Maldives on February 8, 1931 by his father. He studied at Royal College Colombo in Ceylon. After spending several years in Ceylon (Sri Lanka), he came back in 1920 and took up residence at Muliaage. Muliaa’ge was occupied by Prince Hassan Izzuddin between 1920 and 1934. The house did not prove auspicious for the prince, though he apparently spent a lot of time there. It was famous throughout Male’, as a place for merriment and gaiety with numerous music and dance performances organised by the young prince for his entertainment. Izzuddin however soon became the victim of a smear campaign organized by his uncle Al Ameer Abdul Majeed Rannabandeyri Kilegefaanu and cousin Hassan Fareed. Ultimately he was discredited and banished in 1934 to the isolated southerly island of Fuvahmulah where he died in 1938."

Born in 1840, Thomson was the second son of Henry Thomson of Newry, County Down, by his marriage to Anne, daughter of the Rev. William Henry, of Tassagh, County Armagh. He was educated at Trinity College, Dublin. In 1866, he married Alice Cecilia, the youngest daughter of Henry Corbet-Singleton of Aclare, County Meath. He was a significant supporter of hare-coursing, and from 1878 onwards kept his own pack of harriers, described in 1886 as \"consisting of thirteen couples, average height seventeen inches\", with kennels at Newry, but with a hunting country more in County Armagh than County Down. He was also for a time Master of the Newry Harriers, but by 1886 had been succeeded as Master by Thomas D'Arcy Hoey JP. In 1893, his name was published as one of the \"six hundred gentlemen\" of the new Ulster Defence Union. In London, Thomson was a member of the Carlton Club. At the time of his death on 30 December 1916, his address was given in Who's Who as Scarvagle House, Scarva, Co. Newry (sic)."

Burrington played in first-class cricket as a lower-order batsman, though it is not known whether he batted right- or left-handed. He played in one game in 1903, two in 1904 and a further two in 1905, but had little success in any of them. His best performances, and the only times he reached double figures as a batsman, came in the game against Kent in 1904 when he made an unbeaten 18 in the first innings and followed that with 20 in the second. In the First World War, Burrington was commissioned as an officer in the Somerset Light Infantry; in 1916, he was temporarily promoted from second lieutenant to full lieutenant. He was further promoted to acting captain in 1917. He resigned his commission in 1920 and was allowed to keep the rank of captain. In 1941 he was listed as a solicitor at Bridge Chambers, The Strand, Barnstable Kellys Directory 1941"

She was noted for her performances and recordings of Wagner's Brünnhilde: Gramophone— \"The cast also includes the diminutive soprano Henriette Gottlieb, a fine singer who perished at Auschwitz 13 years later. Gottlieb makes a decidedly feminine Brunnhilde (more a Lehmann than a Leider) and von Hoesslin's conducting generates considerable excitement. The untameable 78rpm originals have been dealt with as skilfully as possible, using copies\""

  "text" : "Henrikki Laavunpoika or Henrik Klasson, lord of Kankainen and Haapaniemi, of Töytärinhovi etc., according to some anachronistic literature surnamed \"Horn af Kanckas\" (c.1512–1595) was Finn in the service of Sweden, an army commander, an officer and gentleman of Kankainen Manor. He was the son of the Finnish High Councillor Klaus Henrikinpoika, lord of Joensuu and Kankainen (c1445 - c1520), in Swedish Klas Henriksson, anachronistically Horn, and his second wife Kirsti/Kristina, and uncle of the baron Klaus Kristerinpoika/commander Klas Kristersson Horn (as the Swedish language wants to have his name). Henrikki's elder half-brother. his paternal brother Krister Laavunpoika of Joensuu (est 1480 - c1519), bailiff of Turku castle, was decades older than Henrikki and died around the same time (c1520) as their father Klaus, possibly even a bit earlier. Krister left a daughter and a son, the future baron Klaus of Joensuu, the admiral-general (born c1518 or 1519, merely half a decade younger than the young uncle, Henrikki). Henrikki's Coat-of-Arms depicted a drinking horn, like the arms of his paternal forebears in the 15th century. Henrikki was born in circa 1513 or already in 1512. His parents presumably married in 1511 when justiciar Klaus was commander of the Viipuri castle and administered that province where the young heiress, lady Kirsti resided. Lady Kirsti of Salmenkylä (born before c1495; died in c1553) was heiress of Töytärinhovi manor and its estate (1/4 mantal), as well as of an estate in Reitkalli (1/4 mantal), an estate in Salmenkylä (½ mantal), an estate in Sivatti, an estate in Pyöli (1/6 mantal), and a house and harbor estate in Hietakylä (today Hamina), near the medieval church of Vehkalahti, and additionally heiress of a portion of the Vanhakartano manor of Lammi, in Häme. Henrikki was not quite ten years old when his father died, probably in summer 1520. Mother and son resided chiefly at Haapaniemi manor in Kisko, on the borders of Nylandia and Finland, where Kirsti is recorded as widow by 1524 and in 1530. In around 1531, Kristi married Jaakko Vundrank (fl. 1529, d c1548), an administrator in service of King Gustav I of Sweden and a fiefholder of Elimäki in Kymenlaakso. That marriage produced sometime in the 1530s Tyni Jaakonpoika Vundrank, lord of Salmenkylä (fl 1560s & 1570s, died before 1584). In the 1530s Henrikki was serving Gustav, both at the royal court and in the military. He was briefly over-governor of Stockholm castle. Then he was inspector of royal revenues in Finland and commander of Finnish infantry. Henrik worked under Gustav and his two oldest sons Erik XIV and John III (who ruled Finland under the title of Duke John). He became chief judge in southern Finland through 1549 – 1561. He was also appointed governor of Finland in 1551. In 1555 Henrikki participated in the campaign against Pähkinälinna/Nöteborg. In the mid-1540s (presumably in around 1544), Henrikki married Elina Arvintytär of the Teräskäsi-crested family (d 1577 at Kankainen manor, Masku, southwestern Finland). She was a daughter of Arvi Eerikinpoika, lord of Sydänmaa manor, justiciar of Karelia, castellan of Hämeenlinna (fl 1489, d 1529), and his wife Kirsti Nuutintytär of Laukko (fl 1515; d 1551 at Grabbacka manor, Karjaa), and stepdaughter of Niiles Grabbe, castellan of Viipuri (d 1549 at Grabbacka manor, Karjaa). From his marriage with Elina, Henrikki had at least ten children, including three sons Kaarle, Arvi and Yrjänä, and daughters Kirsti, Kaarina, Piriitta, Elina, Elisabeth and Anna. Particularly through his daughters, within a few generations (such as, from the 17th century), Henrikki and his wife Elina became ancestors of almost all the aristocracy of Finland. King Eric XIV knighted Henrikki at his royal coronation (1561) and he was sent as commander-in-chief to the Livonian front. Between 1558 and 1563 Henrikki was one of Duke John's closest advisors. Henrikki then served under King Erik XIV, and was made a colonel in the Livonian War in October 1563 and Governor of Estonia (seated at Tallinn, i.e. Reval in Swedish) and highest commander of infantry in service of Sweden in the Baltic provinces. He defeated a German mercenary force near Tallinn in 1565. Henrikki was named to the position of High Councillor in 1566. In 1565 Henrikki became governor of Reval and over Livonia. He lost command in 1567 after the failure of the Swedish siege of Narva in 1579, and was replaced by Pontus de la Gardie. King John III appointed Henrikki as governor-general of Finland, and he served as such from 1572 until around 1580. This command included being commander-in-chief of all troops in Finland. He was one of leaders of attempted conquest of Northwestern Russia, in 1578-80, but successes were only sporadic in midst of all sorts of failures. In the 1580s, Henrikki was active in defence tasks: castellan of Käkisalmi fortress and governor of Eastern Finland. In the 1580s, he settled to Taipale manor which he had built in Masku, and left Kankainen to his eldest son Kaarle Horn, the future Marshal. By 1584, his maternal half-brother Tyni Jaakonpoika Vundrank, lord of Salmenkylä (fl 1560s & 1570s, died before 1584) had died, apparently without any progeny, and Tyni's holdings in Vehkalahti (estates in Salmenkylä, Reitkalli, Hietakylä and Husu-Pyöli) passed to Henrikki. Later, in the early 17th century, a part of the Vehkalahti properties belonged to Henrikki's grandson Klaus Kaarlenpoika Horn and another part (Töytärinhovi of Vehkalahti) belonged to his other grandson, Henrikki Fleming. Henrikki died on 21 June 1595 at the age of 83 at his manor of Kankainen, in Masku, southwestern Finland. Henrikki's biographer Blomstedt wrote in 1921 that Henrikki name never had any surname in contemporary records. In the 16th century, usually noblemen in Finland did not use surnames which were exceptions at that time. This means that all variants of surnames attached to him are anachronistic."

At the time, she lived in a private house in the middle of what is now Theodore Roosevelt County Park in Montauk, New York. Lindley became alarmed when she learned that developers planned to build 1,400 housing units in Indian Field, in the area of Big Reed Pond, and to construct a second inlet into Lake Montauk from Shagwong Point. She put an ad in The East Hampton Star inviting anyone who was interested to come to a meeting at her home in Indian Field. Those who showed up became the first members of CCOM. It took three years and countless hours of travel and testimony, but Lindley and the original CCOM finally prevailed upon Suffolk County to establish much of Indian Field as a county park. After the land was saved, Hilda Lindley received a notice from Suffolk County telling her she had thirty days to leave the property. She spent the next several years working out an agreement with the county, by which she was allowed to stay in her house for thirty-five years, after which it would revert to the county and neither she nor her estate would receive any compensation for the house or the two acres of land it was on. Hilda Lindley died in December 1980. According to her wishes, her ashes were scattered on Squaw Hill in Indian Field. In December 2010, the Suffolk County Legislature passed a bill naming her house the Hilda Lindley House in her honor."

  "text" : "Henry Meyer (12 June 1780 - 28 May 1847) was an English portrait painter, more known as a stipple and mezzotint engraver. Meyer was born John Meyer in London - a son of John Meyer and Anna Torade Hoppner who married at St James Westminster 22 December 1767. Contrary to other accounts Henry Meyer's father was a hairdresser and not an engraver.Joseph Farington recorded that Henry Meyer was a nephew of John Hoppner, referring to him as 'Mier' (8 February 1810), and in the obituary of Meyer in Gentleman's Magazine (1847 ii 665). A prominent early 19th-century artist, Henry Meyer was admitted as a pupil to Christ's Hospital, London in 1791 where he studied under Benjamin Green. On 25 August 1794 he was apprenticed to Benjamin Smith for seven years and ultimately trained in engraving techniques at the Royal Academy Schools under Francesco Bartolozzi. His first published engravings appeared in the early 19th century attributed to J. H. Meyer, he later dropped the J and most of his works were published under the name Henry Meyer or H. Meyer. In the ensuing years he showed his skill at portraits and decorative subjects. He produced engravings of such notables as Lady Hamilton, Admiral Nelson, Sir John Nicholl, Lord Hawkesbury, Lord Byron, and Giuseppe Ambrogetti. His painting of Charles Lamb was hung in the India Office for many years. He was a founding member of the Society of British Artists, exhibiting many of his works with this association between 1824 and 1830, and acting as its president in 1828/9."

In April 1640, Price was elected Member of Parliament for Brecon in the Short Parliament. He was re-elected MP for Brecon for the Long Parliament in November 1640. He was an ardent Royalist and was disabled from sitting in Parliament on 8 May 1643. He fought as a Colonel at the Battle of Naseby and accompanied King Charles in his retreat through Galmorgan and Brecon, entertaining him at the Priory on 6 August 1645. He may have been honoured by the King, but no records survive. He was governor of Brecon Castle and held Hereford until it was captured on 18 December 1645 and he was taken prisoner. His estates were sequestered on 13 May 1651 and his name was excepted out of the general pardon for South Wales. Price stood unsuccessfully for parliament at Brecon in 1660. In 1661, he was elected MP for Brecon in the Cavalier Parliament in a double return. He was ordered to sit as duly elected and held the seat until his death. He became Master of the Household for King Charles II in 1661 and a Justice of the Peace for Breconshire in 1666. Price died at the age of 73 and was buried in Westminster Abbey. Price married Goditha Arden, daughter of Sir Henry Arden of Park Hall Warwickshire."

  "text" : "Henry Dawson (1811–1878) was a British landscape painter. Born in Kingston upon Hull, Dawson went with his parents to Nottingham when he was still an infant and always regarded the latter as his native town. His parents were poor, and he began life in a Nottingham lace factory. But even while engaged in lace-making he continued to find time for art, and used to paint small pictures, which he sold at first for about half-a-crown each. In 1835 he gave up the lace trade and set up as an artist, his earliest patron being a hairdresser in Nottingham, who possessed a taste for art. In 1844 he removed to Liverpool, where after a time he got into greater repute, and received higher prices for his works. In 1849 he came with his family to London, and settled at Croydon, where some of his best pictures were painted. Among these may be reckoned 'The Wooden Walls of Old England,' exhibited at the British Institution in 1853, 'The Rainbow,' 'The Rainbow at Sea,' 'London Bridge,' and ' London at Sunrise.' With the exception of six lessons from Pyne received in 1838, Henry Dawson was entirely a self-taught artist, and his art shows much originality and careful realism. He studied nature for himself, but he seems in later life to have been moved by Turner's influence to try more brilliant effects than he had before dared. Many of his works indeed are very Turneresque in treatment, though he can scarcely be called an imitator of Turner, for he had a distinct style of his own. Henry Dawson, though painting much, and selling his pictures for high prices in his later life, remained, strange to say, very little known except to artists and connoisseurs until the large and very interesting collection of his works that was made for the Nottingham Exhibition in 1878 brought him wider fame. This exhibition showed him to be a genuine English landscape painter, of no great imaginative or intellectual power, but who delighted in nature, and represented her faithfully to the best of his ability. He died in December 1878, at Chiswick, where he had for some time resided."

  "text" : "Hugh Hastings Romilly (1856–1892) was a British explorer in the Pacific, the third son of Colonel Frederick Romilly Frederick Romilly and Elizabeth, daughter of William Elliot, third earl of Minto. He was born in London on 15 March 1856, and, at first, educated at the Rev. C. A. Johns's school at Winchester, and then at Repton. He entered Christ Church, Oxford, on 10 October 1874, but took no degree, leaving to enter the business of Messrs. Melly & Co., merchants, of Liverpool. He was of adventurous disposition, and joined in Fiji in October 1879 Sir Arthur Gordon, the governor. On 12 November he accompanied his chief to Tonga, and, in December, to Rotumah, in connection with the annexation of that island. He arrived again in Fiji on 17 April 1880, and returned to Rotumah on 18 September 1880 as deputy-commissioner on its annexation to the British crown. In early 1881, owing to continued ill-health, he rejoined Sir Arthur Gordon, who had gone to New Zealand as governor, but in March he was appointed deputy-commissioner for the Western Pacific, and started for his first long tour through these seas in H.M.S. Beagle. He visited New Hanover, the Admiralty group, Hermit Islands, Astrolabe Bay in New Guinea, the Louisiade archipelago, Woodlark Islands, and the Trobriands. After a visit on sick leave to England, succeeded by a short stay in Fiji, he was ordered to New Guinea for the first time, at the end of 1883. In November 1884 he was one of the party which declared the British protectorate over part of New Guinea. By some misunderstanding he hoisted the British flag in advance of the formal declaration of protectorate. He gave effective aid in the early administration of the new colony, and on the death of the chief administrator, Sir Peter Scratchley, he acted as administrator in charge of the settlement from December 1885 to the end of February 1886, but went to London in June to supervise the New Guinea exhibits at the Colonial and Indian Exhibition. For these services he was created a C.M.G. On 17 Jan. 1887 he once again started for the Pacific, staying en route in Egypt and Australia, and in June took up the appointment of deputy-commissioner and consul of the New Hebrides and Solomon Islands, residing chiefly at Port Moresby, New Guinea. His task during 1888 and 1889 was peculiarly trying. There was a good deal of native hostility, and he was much isolated, owing largely, he believed, to the neglect of the home authorities. Finally, in 1890, he resigned his offices. In 1891 Romilly went out to Africa in command of an expedition for the Northumberland Mining Syndicate, and travelled for some time in Mashonaland. While there he contracted fever, and, returning home, died at Cecil Street, Strand, London, on 27 July 1892. He was unmarried. Romilly is described by Arthur Hamilton-Gordon, 1st Baron Stanmore as of \"a quick intelligence, great physical strength, and an easy temper.\" His writings prove that he possessed all the qualifications for an explorer of new lands and a student of native ways. A portrait forms the frontispiece of the memoir by his brother, Samuel H. Romilly. Romilly published: 1. A true Story of the Western Pacific in 1879–80, London, 1882 (2nd edit. with portrait, 1893). 2. The Western Pacific and New Guinea, London, 1886. 3. From my Verandah in New Guinea, London, 1889.

Van Zanten was introduced to the Stanislavski method by Piet Eelvelt. His mentor was the Belgian theatre reformer Jan Decorte. Since 1982 Van Zanten is active as an artist, actor and director. Because of the many art disciplines he engages himself in (such as theatre, performance art, street theatre, independent television production, sketch comedy, stand up comedy, acting and directing) he calls himself an \"omni artist\". He appeared as the Master of the Scream (narrator) in ’u’, the first Klingon opera."

  "text" : "Hubert Joseph \"Hub\" Schlafly Jr. (August 14, 1919 – April 20, 2011) was an American electrical engineer who co-invented the teleprompter. Schlafly is also credited with spearheading the movement towards satellite television within the industry. Schlafly was born in St. Louis, Missouri, on August 14, 1919. He often moved as a child as his father moved around as a wildcatter. He graduated from St. Louis University High School and later earned a bachelor's degree in electrical engineering from the University of Notre Dame in 1941. During the 1950s, Schlafly invented the teleprompter, which scrolls text to on-camera talent, in order to help a soap opera actor who could not remember his lines. Schlafly unveiled the teleprompter on the set of the CBS soap opera, The First Hundred Years, in 1950. Schlafly and Irving B. Kahn also co-founded the TelePrompTer Corporation, which grew to become the largest cable television provider in the United States by 1973. They later sold the company to Westinghouse. In addition to the teleprompter, Schlafly is also credited with helping to promote the broadcasting of television signals via a satellite feed. Schlafly and Sidney Topol, who worked for Scientific Atlanta, jointly constructed a portable satellite receiver to obtain satellite signals specifically for television. He first demonstrated the satellite television technology in 1973, when Speaker of the House Carl Albert was able to speak at a cable television convention in Anaheim, California, from his congressional office in Washington D.C. Schlafly later called the Albert speech via a satellite feed as his greatest contribution to the cable industry. In a 1956 article in Amazing Stories Magazine he predicted for the turn of the century: Systematic information storage will be in a form instantly available for response to remote inquiries. The refinements of solid state electronics will permit devices of considerable complication to be packaged in amazingly small volumes having low power requirements and exhibiting great resistance to mechanical damage. Communications, both personal and group communications will be highly refined without the encumbrance of any wires to or between terminal devices.\" In 2008, Schlafly was inducted into the Cable Hall of Fame. His speech at the induction ceremony marked the first time that Schlafly used the teleprompter, which he had invented approximately fifty years before. Schlafly was also honored with two Emmy Awards for his contributions to cable television technology. Schlafly died at a hospital in Stamford, Connecticut, on April 20, 2011, at the age of 91. His wife, Leona Martin Schlafly, predeceased him in 2003 after fifty-nine years of marriage."

He was on many committees during his life, one of the later ones being to advise Governor Cranston on matters concerning the expedition against Canada. In 1714 he succeeded the late Walter Clarke as Deputy Governor, serving for a single year. Tew wrote his will on 20 April 1718, dying six days later. He was married twice, having nine children by his first wife, and nine by his second. He and both wives are buried in a family burial ground half a mile north of Sachuest Beach, in Middletown, Rhode Island. There is some evidence that Tew was the brother of the privateer and pirate, Thomas Tew."

In his one match in 1898, he did not bowl, but in the first of three games in 1899, he was the eighth bowler used as Gloucestershire replied to a Somerset first innings score of 476 with an opening stand of 148; Griffin, however, then took six wickets for 40 runs in 19 five-ball overs, and a further three when Gloucestershire followed on, to finish with match figures of nine for 107. Despite this success, Griffin, as a professional, was unable to secure a regular place in cash-strapped Somerset's team, and played only two further matches. In the second of these, against Yorkshire, he took the wickets of David Denton, Rockley Wilson, Lord Hawke and Schofield Haigh and made his highest first-class score of 23. But he did not appear in first-class cricket again."

He also represented Japan at the 2007 World Championships. Hailing from Ōbatake, Yamaguchi, Tanaka established himself domestically with back-to-back decathlon wins at the Japanese Athletics Championships in 2004 and 2005. On his first international appearance, he won the bronze medal at the 2005 Asian Athletics Championships, finishing behind Pavel Andreev and Kim Kun-Woo. He took a third consecutive national title in 2006, a winning streak that would continue until 2009 when he was beaten by Daisuke Ikeda. At the 2006 Asian Indoor Athletics Championships he missed out on a medal in the indoor heptathlon, although he achieved 5340 points in his first major outing in the event. He scored a personal best total of 7803 points for decathlon in Kanazawa in June 2006, but at his first Asian Games that year he was far off this form and, after he failed to produce a mark in the pole vault, he finished in tenth place. As the reigning national champion, Tanaka gained selection for the 2007 World Championships in Athletics, held in Osaka, and he finished in 19th place overall. Tanaka won his first indoor medal at the 2008 Asian Indoor Athletics Championships, taking the bronze at the event in Doha. In the absence of Dmitriy Karpov and the defending champion Ahmed Hassan Moussa, he won the 2009 Asian Athletics Championships. He missed the 2010 Asian Games."

His subordinates were also accused of being behind bombings against the Al Arabiya television station's Baghdad bureau and the city's central bank. On November 27, one month after the church bombing, Iraqi security forces announced they had captured Al-Batawi and a number of other militants. On May 8, 2011, in a Baghdad prison mutiny, al-Batawi overpowered a police officer who was leading him to an interrogation room, taking his weapon and shooting him dead. Al-Batawi had been unshackled for interrogation. He then freed a number of other prisoners associated along with him in the church massacre and killed Iraqi Brigadier General Moayeh al-Saleh, the counter-terrorism chief for Baghdad's central Karrada district, before being himself killed in a firefight. 17 people were killed overall, including 11 senior al-Qaeda militants, according to the Baghdad police spokesman. Another police source said eight inmates, most facing death sentences, were killed along with nine security officers, three of them senior officials."

  "text" : "Hengameh Shahidi (born c. 1976) is an Iranian journalist, political activist, and political prisoner currently serving a six-year sentence for “gathering and colluding with intent to harm state security” and “propaganda against the system”. Earlier in her career, Shahidi worked for Nowrooz newspaper before it was closed down, and was the candidate for the Sazandegi Party. Shahidi is/was a PhD student at the School of Oriental and African Studies in the United Kingdom. She returned to Iran for the 2009 presidential election and acted as an adviser on women’s issues to presidential candidate Mehdi Karroubi, whose party (National Trust Party (Iran)|National Trust party), she was a member of. On 30 June, following the eruption of mass protests against the officially announced re-election of incumbent President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, she was arrested. She was detained for over four months without charge during which time she states that she was tortured and otherwise ill-treated, threatened with execution, and subjected to a mockexecution. She also says that her interrogators threatened to arrest other members of her family. In November 2009 she was released on bail. Her trial began shortly thereafter. In December she was convicted of “participation in illegal gatherings,” “collusion to disrupt security,” “propagating against the regime,” “disruption in public order,” and sentenced to six years and three months and one day in prison. Her sentence was upheld on appeal (although her conviction for “insulting the President\" was overturned). After being allowed liberty during her appeal she was rearrested on 25 February 2010. Hengameh Shahidi suffers from a heart condition, for which she requires regular medication. According to an unnamed source quoted by iranhumanrights.org 21 August 2010: “Hengameh has not been in a good physical health and is suffering from heart and stomach problems, back disc, nervous rheumatism, and also severe drop in blood pressure. Even though about six months ago a medical furlough was requested, up to now her request has not been granted. Continuation of this situation would seriously jeopardize her health because her condition requires hospitalization and treatment.\""

  "text" : "Henry Grahn Hermunen (Helsinki 1963) is a contemporary artist living in Helsinki, Finland and Stockholm, Sweden. He studied at The Academy of Fine Arts in Helsinki Finland between 1996–2001 and received a Master of Fine Arts. During 1998 -2000 he was a scholar at The Royal University College of Fine Arts in Stockholm Sweden. Since the late 1990s, he has created big scale installations consisting of separate techniques or combinations such as: photography, drawings, sculpture, painting, light and sound, dealing with environmental and sociopolitical issues. In an interview \"Art about the beauty in Life\", with Ny Tid (Finland) news magazine Henry Grahn Hermunen said: We live in the middle of a worldwide renaissance with global education through the internet. But for example, people work too much to have time to consume what they have. Medias role is crucial - they can obviously make people shrink. Joseph Pulitzer who founded the Pulitzer Prize and who sometimes acted dubiously himself, said a hundred years ago \"that a cynical, mercenary and demagogic press will eventually create a people who are just as shabby as themselves\". Henry Grahn Hermunen has exhibited at art venues including Art Forum Berlin, ARCO Madrid and at The Whitechapel Gallery London, as well showing solo exhibitions at Marina Gisich Gallery and at The Hermitage Museum in St. Petersburg. Swedish newspaper SvD Svenska Dagbladet wrote: Grahn Hermunen is the first North European Contemporary Artist invited to show his exhibition \"Water table in a renaissance garden\" in one of the halls of The Hermitage, a Museum considered to be one of the world's foremost Institutions. His works are for example in the collections of Moderna Museet the Museum of Modern Art Stockholm Sweden, Pro Artibus Finland, Hamburger Bahnhof - Museum of Contemporary Art Berlin Germany, MoMA - Museum of Modern Art New York USA, Erarta Museum of Contemporary Art St. Petersburg Russia, and The South Karelian Art Museum Finland. In 2011 Henry Grahn Hermunen was invited to take part and also curate the North European section to the Celebratory 10th International Dialogues Biennale in Manege -The Main Exhibition Hall of St. Petersburg, Russia. The artist is represented by Cath Alexandrine Danneskiold-Samsøe Gallery in Denmark, Marina Gisich Gallery in Russia, and Karin Weber-Galerie Mitte in Germany."

  "text" : "Hubert Drouais (5 May 1699 1 – 9 February 1767), was a French painter, portraitist and miniaturist. Drouais was born in Pont-Audemer in Normandy, the son of Anne Talon and the painter Jean Drouais. Hubert followed in his father’s footsteps and received his first lessons from him before leaving for Rouen to further his skills. He then decided to make it to Paris, although he was so poor that, unable to afford the cost of the trip, he had to work his way on the road to his destination. He devoted himself particularly to the portrait, and was the best pupil of the portraitist François de Troy, who is linked through his own master and through Rigaud to the grand tradition of Van Dyck. He soon acquired an ease that made him look like one of the first painters in this genre. As he was making progress, he would visit his homeland, as if to honor it with his first successes. His father’s approval and his countrymen’s encouragements were his sweetest rewards. He excelled in the genres of portraiture and miniature. Although in different parts that characterize a good painter, one who has done most to admire its color is fresh and bright. On the death of Troy, Drouais was employed by Jean-Baptiste van Loo, Jean-Baptiste Oudry and Jean-Marc Nattier. He was in fashion at the court of Louis XV as a portraitist, painting not only princes and princesses, but the actresses of Comédie-Française and opera girls, like the Camargo, Mlle Gautier, Mlle Pelissier, the Gaussin, as well. Drouais was received at the Académie de peinture et de sculpture on November 29, 1730. At his death, rue des Orties, his funeral was celebrated at the Église Saint-Roch. He had two children with Margaret Lusurier whom he had married on February 22, 1727. His son François-Hubert, whose first master he was, and his grandson Jean-Germain were painters like him and in his old age he had the satisfaction to see his son also enter the Académie de peinture. He died at Paris."

He painted portraits, altarpieces and decorative works, including the Pompeian Apartment in Christian VIII's Palace at Amalienborg Palace. His principal work is the decoration of Christian IV's Chapel in Roskilde Cathedral but this led to the laming of his right arm. He died when receiving spa treatment at Stuer."

  "text" : "Hilma Swedahl, née Wounsch (2 October 1870 – 2 July 1965) was a Swedish-American gold prospector and the founder of the Swedish tourist village of Alaska i Strömstad. Hilma Wounsch was born on the island of Syd-Hälsö, Strömstads kommun in Västra Götaland County, Sweden. She was the daughter of a fisher in Bohuslän. During the spring of 1896, she traveled to New York City, where she worked as a domestic. After four years, she left for Alaska and the Klondike Gold Rush. She joined a group of young people in Dawson with whom she reached the gold camp near Ruby, Alaska. She lived alone in the wilderness for fifteen years until she married John Swedahl, a gold prospector originally from Trondheim, Norway. The couple visited Sweden in 1912 and in 1928. After the last visit, Hilma Swedahl remained in Sweden, while her husband returned to the United States. During the 1930s, she founded the Alaska i Strömstad, a park and rock garden located on Norra Långöns naturreservat, an island and nature reserve located in an archipelago northwest of Stromstad. Largely built of stone, this tourist village was inspired by her experience while living in the state of Alaska. Hilma Swedahl died in 1965 and was buried in the churchyard at Skee church (Skee kyrka) in Strömstad. On her grave stone is carved her saying: \"Don´t worry!\"."

  "text" : "Henry Graham, of Levens (ca. 1676 – 7 January 1706/1707), also spelt Grahme, was an English gentleman, heir to a Westmorland estate, and member of parliament. Graham was the eldest of the three sons of James Grahme or Graham of Levens (1649–1729), by his marriage to Dorothy Howard, daughter of William Howard and a granddaughter of Thomas Howard, 1st Earl of Berkshire (1587–1669). James Graham, who was a younger brother of Richard Graham, 1st Viscount Preston, became Keeper of the Privy Purse to King James II. He first stood for parliament in the summer of 1700, at a county of Westmorland by-election which did not take place because of the dissolution of parliament. A Tory, his campaign was dogged by allegations that he and his father were Roman Catholics. However, in 1701 he was elected as a knight of the shire for Westmorland and held this seat in the House of Commons until his early death. Graham's Westmorland home was at Levens Hall, a country house with a large estate four miles south of Kendal which his father had bought in 1689 for £24,000. However, although he was his father's heir, Graham inherited nothing from him. His father outlived him by more than twenty years and, indeed, outlived both of his brothers, so that in the end the property went to an heiress. On 23 May 1705, at Knightsbridge, Graham married Lady Mary Tudor, an illegitimate daughter of King Charles II by Moll Davies. This wedding came less than a week after the death of the bride's first husband, Edward Radclyffe, 2nd Earl of Derwentwater, on 29 April. It was later reported that the two had been living together before her husband's death. The marriage caused Graham great trouble, both with his family and with others. Before it, Graham had held an office in the household of Prince George of Denmark, the husband of Queen Anne, but as a result of the wedding he was dismissed from it. Graham died at Westminster."

The 200 m² unfinished mural described Batavia's life during 1880 until 1920. This Mural is buried in an ethnography room from 1974 until 2010 when some British and Indonesian historians found it unexpectedly. Harijadi was one of the painter who often invited by Soekarno to discuss about paintings. His believe to Soekarno's national ideology had limited him to work in Indonesia New Order(1968–1998). At that time, any concepts related with Soekarno had become a fear. Until his end of life, he still held the principle to use his art works for people and refused to serve ruler."

  "text" : "Colonel Sir John Edmond Hugh Boustead, KBE, CMG, DSO, MC & Bar (14 April 1895 – 3 April 1980), was a British military officer, modern pentathlete, and diplomat who served in numerous posts across several Middle Eastern countries, including ambassador to Abu Dhabi from 1961 to 1965. The son of a tea planter from Sri Lanka, Boustead began his career with the Royal Navy, but soon joined the British Army to fight in the trenches during World War I, where he earned his first of two Military Crosses. Following an appearance at the 1920 Summer Olympics, Boustead spent several years as a mountaineer and explorer prior to being appointed commander of the Sudan Camel Corps, with whom he served through World War II. He then embarked on a diplomatic career until his 1965 retirement and published an autobiography, The Wind of Morning, in 1971, nine years prior to his death in Dubai."

  "text" : "Hermann Schramm (1871–1951) was a German tenor who sang at the Frankfurt Opera in the 1920s and made several recordings for HMV Germany. Although he was Jewish he escaped the deportation and subsequent fate of his colleagues at the Frankfurt Opera, Richard Breitenfeld, Magda Spiegel, bass Hans Erl and violinist Moses Slager, since he was married to an \"Aryan\" wife, and his children had been raised as Christians. Hans Meissner, head of the opera, intervened personally for Schramm with the mayor in 1933 when Erl and others had to be dismissed from the opera. A chance anecdote reveals Schramm, then 72, as a witness in the 1950 trial of low-ranking Gestapo officer Heinrich Baab who scoured the streets of Frankfurt after 1940 looking for Jews. Schramm was witness to the arrest of a Jewish woman caught with a tramway ticket in her handbag - evidence of her using public transport. Schramm attempted to intervene and was repeatedly struck in the face by Baab, but not himself arrested."

In 1938 he composed a Großdeutsche Hymne for Schirach which coincided with the Anschluss of Austria. From 1937 to 1951 he collaborated on a series of films with Veit Harlan. From 1959 to 1971 he withdrew from film popular music to lecture at the Max Reinhardt Theatre and privately compose difficult atonal music."

He earned a B.A. in 1860, became a fellow of the Queens College, Oxford in 1861 and was awarded an M.A. in 1864. He became the science master at Eton College, where he served for twenty years. He was elected a Fellow of the Chemical Society and published several works on chemistry and physics. In 1887, he co-published Exercises in practical chemistry with A. G. V. Harcourt, which became a standard textbook for many years thereafter. In 1877, American astronomer Asaph Hall discovered two satellites orbiting the planet Mars. Various names were proposed, but Asaph chose the suggestion of Henry Madan, who proposed the names Deimus (later Deimos) and Phobus (later Phobos). (These names are found in the Fifteenth Book, line 119 of Homer's Iliad.) Henry was the brother of Falconer Madan (1851–1935), the librarian of the Bodleian Library of the University of Oxford. Falconer's granddaughter, Venetia Burney (1918–2009), holds the distinction of being the first person to suggest the name Pluto for the dwarf planet, discovered in 1930. In 1901, Henry George Madan was injured by a railway truck and needed his arm amputated. His health never recovered and he died several months later."

He became a hero to the insurrectionists all across Europe in 1848 and 1849 because of his refusal to fire on the insurgent citizens. In 1849, Natzner escaped from prison and fled to the Palatinate where he took part in the Baden-Palatinate uprising of 1849.

Educated at Malvern College and St Thomas' Medical School, he worked at a hospital until the outbreak of World War II. He joined the Royal Army Medical Corps during the war and was posted to Singapore soon before its fall to the Japanese. He spent the rest of the war as a POW in the notorious Changi camp, during which time while treating fellow prisoners he established that beriberi is caused by a deficiency of Vitamin B1, not as was previously thought by excessive consumption of alcohol. He was awarded a military MBE in 1946. He was Professor of Medicine, University of London, Charing Cross Hospital, 1960–81, and subsequently Emeritus professor. He was Honorary Consultant Physician to the Army, 1975 1980. He was appointed CBE on his retirement in 1982."

  "text" : "Hermanus van Wyk (1835–1905) was the first Kaptein of the Baster community at Rehoboth in South-West Africa, today Namibia. Under his leadership, the mixed-race Basters moved from the Northern Cape to leave white racial discrimination, and migrated into the interior of what is now central Namibia; the first 30 families settled about 1870. They acquired land from local natives and were joined by additional Baster families over the following years. The people developed a constitution, called the Paternal Laws.The people relied on managing herds of sheep, goats and cattle as the basis of their economy. Outnumbered by the native Damara, Nama and Herero peoples, the Basters had periodic conflict with them in the late 1870s and 1880s, when the latter two groups were also in conflict. They suffered losses of valuable livestock. After the German Empire annexed South-West Africa as a colony, Van Wyk negotiated a kind of autonomy for Rehoboth and the land around it through a protection treaty with the Empire in 1885. In the early 1900s, the Basters joined the Germans in a colonial war against the Nama and Herero. Since Namibia gained independence in 1991, the Basters lost considerable land. While the community is influenced by their Paternal Laws, the area is under a local town council."

Born of unknown parents and probably illegitimate, Henri-Robert was admitted to the Paris bar in 1885 and rose to become a celebrated criminal defense lawyer. He defended a young woman named Gabrielle Bompard in a sensational 1889 murder trial, calling in Georges Gilles de la Tourette as an expert witness on hypnotism. He also defended the fraudster Thérèse Humbert, and the serial child killer Jeanne Weber, twice. In 1903 a Paris correspondent for the New York Times described him as \"an exceptionally successful lawyer... the favorite advocate of the criminal classes (who) has already saved innumerable heads from the guillotine\". From 1913 through 1919 he was President of the Paris Bar. After the First World War, Henry-Robert turned his focus to civil litigation, and to the production of books on historical topics such as Mary Stuart, Henry VIII, Catherine de Médici, Marie-Antoinette, and Henri Coiffier de Ruzé, Marquis of Cinq-Mars. Henri-Robert's daughter Jeanne Henri-Robert married the future French Prime Minister Paul Reynaud in 1912."

  "text" : "Herb Cornuelle (died 1996) was a businessman and activist in Hawaii, who was involved in the development of free market think tanks during the mid-twentieth century. With F. A. \"Baldy\" Harper, Cornuelle helped found the Foundation for Economic Education in New York in 1946, and later became head of the William Volker Fund (where he hired Murray Rothbard as an academic consultant). His siblings include libertarian author Richard Cornuelle. Cornuelle came to Hawaii in 1942 as a Navy ensign and returned to Hawaii in 1953 as vice president of Hawaiian Pine, later the Dole Pineapple Company. Five years later, at age 38, he was elevated to president of the company. Cornuelle moved to Boston and led the United Fruit Company from 1963 until 1969, when he returned to Honolulu to head Dillingham Corp. He joined the Campbell Estate in 1982 as a trustee, retiring as board chairman in 1990. He also served as chairman of the Board of Regents at the University of Hawaii from March 1961 to June 1963, chairman of the East-West Center Board of Governors, and on the Cono Sur Board of Directors. According to a popular story, Cornuelle helped set the tone of his leadership at Dillingham during a business flight to the Mainland. With other executives seated in first class, the 6-foot-4 Cornuelle made his way to the coach section to find a seat."

Stokes was suspicious of the contents of the parcels he had been given to carry, and opened one, revealing human body parts, which he immediately reported to police. The crime was given more publicity at the time than those of Jack the Ripper. Henry and Thomas were tried at the Old Bailey before Sir Alexander Cockburn and found guilty: Henry of murder and Thomas of being an accessory after the fact. Henry Wainwright was sentenced to death and hanged by William Marwood on 21 December 1875."

  "text" : "Hjalmar Marius Pettersen (13 January 1856 – 18 January 1928) was a Norwegian librarian and bibliographer, best known for editing the Bibliotheca Norvegica, a bibliography of Norwegian literature. Born in the country's capital to a family of means, he became early a voracious reader, eventually embarking on a philological career. After longer stays in France – with whose capital he quickly fell in love – he sought a post at the University Library of Oslo, becoming employed as its lecturer in 1887. During the 1890s Pettersen published numerous bibliographies, having procured exotic works from foreign libraries. After the exit of his fellow librarian Jens Braage Halvorsen from the University Library, Pettersen occupied the position as chief librarian. Having begon on the Bibliotheca Norvegica around the end of the 19th century, he finished it four years before his death, leaving the 21 first sheets of paper for the fifth volume behind. Having become a member of the Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters in 1903, he was rewarded the Order of St. Olav in 1909. In 1928, two years before his eventual death, he was upgraded to a Commander of the same order. His biographers usually describe him as a laborious yet gregarious man."

Born in Derby, England, Hickling served from 1941 until 1946 in the British Royal Navy during World War II, and then joined the Colonial Legal Service. In 1955, Hickling was posted to Malaya (now Malaysia), where he gained prominence as a lawmaker. He drafted the Constitution of Malaysia, and as Commissioner of Law Revision wrote the Internal Security Act (ISA) of 1960, which provided for the detention of persons without trial. The ISA was later used to oppress political opponents or those dedicated to non-violent activities, which Hickling later said was not his intention. In 1972, Hickling retired from the civil service, and subsequently lectured in law in Australia, Malaysia, Singapore, and the United Kingdom.

Waage was a member of Kristiania city council from 1919 to 1922, and was a deputy representative to the Parliament of Norway during the term 1922–1924.

After completing his degree in film and video advertising at Osaka University of Arts, he joined the game industry. Swery worked at various game companies until he founded Access Games in January 2002. His directorial debut Spy Fiction focused on a western audience, rather than aiming at the Japanese audience as the primary target, a tactic he continued with Deadly Premonition in 2010. That game made its way to the Guinness World Record as \"the most controversial survival horror game\", and in 2011 Swery was listed as one of the fifty most influential game creators in the Western industry. In 2014 he partnered with Microsoft to develop an Xbox One game titled D4: Dark Dreams Don't Die, which utilizes the Kinect motion-sensing device. The game was highlighted at GDC Next 2013 as one of their \"GDC Next 10\", where chosen developers give talks on the inspiration behind their upcoming games. In 2015, he gave a lecture in Osaka and at GDC 2015 regarding physical input in video games and the Kinect device. He also opened a booth along with Access Games at Penny Arcade Expo East 2015. In November 2015 he announced that he would be taking a health-related break from game development in order to focus on recovering from reactive hypoglycemia."

  "text" : "Hidemaro Fujibayashi (藤林 秀麿 Fujibayashi Hidemaro, born October 1, 1972 in Kyoto Prefecture) is a Japanese video game designer working for Nintendo. He is best known for his contributions to the action-adventure game series The Legend of Zelda, for which he served as planner, writer and director. Before he entered the video game industry, Fujibayashi had designed layouts of haunted attractions for Japanese theme parks. At that time, he had considered finding an occupation involving production, and came upon a job opening from a company that developed video games. He was fascinated with the fact that his application for employment had to include a sample of his work that would be inspected directly upon transmittal, and he became enamored with the idea of being a game designer. Fujibayashi eventually joined Capcom in 1995, where he gained experience as planner for the interactive movie Gakkō no Kowai Uwasa: Hanako-san ga Kita!! and the mahjong game Yōsuke Ide Meijin no Shin Jissen Maajan. Later, he became part of the company's Production Studio 1, and designed and directed the puzzle game Magical Tetris Challenge. Fujibayashi's first involvement with the Zelda series was with the Game Boy Color games The Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Seasons and Oracle of Ages. In the initial development stages, he acted as sort of a clerk, who gathered all staff ideas and created presentations to propose the game concepts to producer Shigeru Miyamoto. Fujibayashi eventually became the director, participated as planner and scenario writer, and devised a system to link the two games for consecutive playthroughs. During his time at Capcom, he also directed and planned the Game Boy Advance games The Legend of Zelda: Four Swords and The Legend of Zelda: The Minish Cap. Following his switch to Nintendo, Fujibayashi became subdirector and story writer for the Nintendo DS game The Legend of Zelda: Phantom Hourglass. Afterward, he made his directorial debut for a home console Zelda with the Wii game The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword. According to Fujibayashi, the most important aspect of game design is making the fundamental rule set of a video game absolutely clear to a player. He has a special fondness for the first The Legend of Zelda, which he described as \"novel\" and \"groundbreaking\" for its time."

  "text" : "Henry Brill (October 6, 1906 - June 17, 1990) was an American psychiatrist and educator. A native of Bridgeport, Connecticut, he earned both his undergraduate and medical degrees from Yale University. After receiving his M.D. in 1932, he began a career in the New York state psychiatric system, culminating in the directorship of Pilgrim Psychiatric Center in Brentwood, NY from 1958 to 1974. At its height in the mid-1950s, Pilgrim was the largest mental institution in the world, with a census of 13,875 patients. Brill also served as Deputy Commissioner of the New York State Department of Mental Hygiene from 1959 to 1964. Brill was a leader in the early use of the tranquilizer chlorpromazine (Thorazine) in the United States for the treatment of psychosis, having heard of its success in France and Canada in the early 1950s. After being contacted directly by the drug's U.S. distributor, Smith Kline & French, Brill convened a meeting of New York psychiatrists in 1953 to discuss the benefits of chlorpromazine use in the public sector psychiatric hospital system. Shortly thereafter, New York became the first state to use the new medication in its hospitals on a large scale. Following several successful pilot tests in 1954, the introduction of chlorpromazine for general use in the patient population in January 1955 led to the first decrease in the New York state psychiatric hospital census during peacetime, as described in analyses published by Brill and Robert Patton in 1957 and 1959. The advent of wide antipsychotic medication use in the public psychiatric hospital systems of the United States was a key factor in the eventual rise of the deinstitutionalization movement in the 1960s. Brill was the chairman of the American Psychiatric Association Committee on Nomenclature and Statistics from 1960 to 1965 and was notable for supporting committee member Robert Spitzer's efforts to discontinue the classification of homosexuality as a mental disorder in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 2nd Edition (DSM-II)."
