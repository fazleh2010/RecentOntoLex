In 1881, this group assassinated Tsar Aleksandr II. During the repression which followed, Rubanovich fled abroad, eventually settling in Paris, France, and becoming a French citizen. There he co-founded the Group of 'Old Members of The People's Will' ('Gruppa Starykh Narodovol’tsev') in 1891, together with P.L. Lavrov, N.S. Rusanov and others. In 1900 he was instrumental in founding the Agrarian Socialist League. When the Socialist Revolutionary Party (PSR) was founded in 1901, Rubanovich joined it and became its official representative abroad. Together with Nikolai Rusanov, he edited the party's official journal, Herald of the Russian Revolution (Vestnik Russkoi Revoliutsii). When the PSR was admitted to the Second International (over vehement protests from its rival, the Russian Social Democratic party), Rubanovich became the party's official representative to the International. In addition to his work for the PSR, Rubanovich was active in the French socialist movement. He was close to the Blanquist Parti Socialiste-Révolutionnaire (a namesake of the Russian PSR). In 1905, he supported the unification of the various French socialist groups in the French Socialist Party (SFIO). He also helped organise Jewish trade unionists in France. In 1914, most European socialist parties split over the First World War. Rubanovich sided with the 'Defencist' wing of the Russian PSR and the 'social patriots' in the SFIO, who supported the Entente war effort. Rubanovich supported the February Revolution of 1917, briefly returned to Russia and then returned to Paris to resume his position as representative of the PSR abroad. He opposed the October Revolution."

  "text" : "Ingmar Kristian Liljefors (13 December 1906 - 14 October 1981) was a Swedish composer, pianist, writer on music, and music educator. Born in Gothenburg, Liljefors was the son of composer and conductor Ruben Liljefors. His own son, Mats Liljefors, is a successful conductor and violinist. In 1933 Liljefors co-founded Fylkingen, a society for experimental music and arts. He served as the first Chairman of that organization from 1933-1946. He was also the Chairman of Föreningen Svenska Tonsättare (English: Association of Swedish Composers) from 1947-1963. In 1958 he was named a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Music. He taught music composition, harmony and piano for many years at the Royal College of Music, Stockholm where he was appointed full professor in 1968. One of his pupils was composer Ruth Schönthal. He died in Stockholm in 1981 at the age of 74. In addition to teaching in the classroom, Liljefors also wrote several music theory text books which were used by many music schools in his native country. These included Harmonilärans grunder med ackordanalys enligt funktionsteorien (C.A.V. Lundberg, 1937), Harmonisk analys enligt funktionsteorien (C. A. V. Lundholm, 1951), Romantisk harmonik ur pedagogisk synvinkel (Nordiska Musikförlaget, 1969), and Harmonik och sats: Schubert till Ravel (Erika, 1976). As a composer, his output included an opera, a symphony, several works for string orchestra, a piano and a violin concerto, a concertino, a rhapsody for piano and orchestra, many solo piano pieces and songs, and numerous chamber music works. His compositions were characterized by their use of elements of Swedish folk music, particularly with regard to rhythm."

Born on December 5, 1932 in Berlin, Germany to a Japanese mother and a Swedish-Russian father but educated in Japan, Hemming began learning to play the piano at a young age from her mother. She was identified as a child prodigy and performed her first concert at seventeen. She went to Aoyama Gakuin Senior High School, Aoyama Gakuin Junior High School, Aoyama Gakuin Elementary School. She graduated from the Tokyo National University of Fine Arts and Music and began her professional career immediately. Hemming received many prestigious honors during this time, including the NHK-Mainichi Music Concour and the Bunka Radio Broadcasting Company Music Prize. She relocated to Germany at the age of 28 to study at the Berlin Institute of Music. During a concert in Vienna in 1971, Hemming lost her hearing from a bout of high fever. She relocated again to Stockholm, Sweden to take advantage of its medical facilities. She performed many more concerts throughout continental Europe before returning to Japan in 1995. A documentary that aired in 1999 raised public interest in her music. Her subsequent debut CD, La Campanella, sold over two million copies. Hemming performed at Carnegie Hall in New York in June 2001. By 2002, Hemming had performed at every major population center in the world."

In 1277, he spearheaded a peasant uprising and forced the nobles to accept him as emperor. He reigned as emperor from 1278 to 1279, scoring victories against the Byzantines and the Mongols, but beset by foreign and domestic enemies, which included the Bulgarian nobility, he was forced into exile among the Mongols, where he presented himself as a dethroned vassal. The Mongols then killed him in 1280 as an enemy of the Byzantine emperor Michael VIII Palaeologus. His career as a monarch has been used as an example of early, anti-feudal class warfare by Marxist historians and as translated through folk songs, traditions and legends served as inspiration to Bulgarian guerrilla (hajduk) freedom fighters during the Ottoman period of Bulgarian history."

  "text" : "Ivan Picelj (28 July 1924 – 22 February 2011) was a contemporary Croatian painter, sculptor and graphic designer. Picelj developed a specific variation of geometric abstraction in Croatian painting by using primary colours and by reducing the shapes to geometric elements. He made sculptures and reliefs in wood and in metal (since 1957). The multiplication of the basic plastic unit within a regular grid is one of his trademark procedures. He was one of the founders and members of the group Exat 51 which, in the period 1950–1956, consisted of the architects Vjenceslav Richter, Bernardo Bernardi, Zdravko Bregovac, Božidar Rašica and Vladimir Zaharović, and the painters Vlado Kristl and Aleksandar Srnec. He was also a member of the Industrial Design Studio – SIO (1956). He is one of the founders of the New Tendencies movement, and he participated in the production and exhibited at the New Tendencies exhibitions in Zagreb (1961–67). He spent a lot of time in Paris where he collaborated with the Denise René Gallery. He also involved himself in graphic design (posters and books) from the mid-1960s and published four graphic maps: 8 seriographies (1957), Oeuvre programmeé (1966), Cyclophoria (1971) and Géométrie élémentaire (1973). He organized the first industrial design exhibition in Zagreb in 1955 and helped design the Yugoslavian pavilions for national and international exhibitions. He exhibited at many solo (since 1952) and group shows, such as the Venice Biennale (1969, 1972), A Century of Avant-garde Art in Middle and Eastern Europe (Bonn, 1994), Constructivism and Kinetic Art (Zagreb, 1995), Ivan Picelj – Graphic Art Opus 1957–2003, International Centre of Graphic Arts (MGLC), (Ljubljana, 2003), Picelj, Denise René Gallery (Rive Gauche, Paris, 2008). His works are part of the museum collections at the Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art, Rijeka, the Museum of Contemporary Art, Zagreb, the Muzeum Sztuki in Łódź, the International Centre of Graphic Arts in Ljubljana, the Museum of Modern Art, New York. Many works also belong to many private collections such as the Filip Trade Collection, Croatia. He received the Vladimir Nazor Award for “Life Achievement” (1994). Ivan Picelj was born in Okučani and died in Zagreb."

  "text" : "Ieuan ap Tudur Penllyn (fl. 1480) was a Welsh poet of the late mediaeval period. Ieuan was born at Caer-Gai, near Llanuwchllyn, Merioneth (present-day Gwynedd) and was the son of two notable poets: Tudur Penllyn and Gwerful Fychan. Through the latter he claimed descent from Rhirid Flaidd, a 12th-century nobleman of Powys. In common with other poets of the time much of his work is \"praise-poetry\" directed at the Uchelwyr, or Welsh nobility, including members of the Abertanad family and the Wynns of Gwydir. Ieuan was of a gentry family himself so is unlikely to have been a 'professional' writer. His satire on the borough of Flint also survives along with several humorous disputations with the famous poet Guto'r Glyn. His work has occasionally been confused in manuscripts with that of his father, and he seems to have had a sister, Gwenllian, who may also have been a poet. His surviving poetry was edited by Thomas Roberts in 1958, in a single volume with the work of Tudur Penllyn."

Marcus Garvey wrote that \"Morter grew up fighting the oppositions and difficulties generally surrounding one born to his condition, until he lifted himself to the highest pinnacle of service to his race and to his country.\" By planting and growing bananas and coconuts, Morter built a fortune and is widely regarded as Belize's first coloured millionaire. His nicknames included \"the Coconut King\" and \"Guinea Sigar\" and he owned Caye Chapel and other plantations. For his achievements he was honoured with the award of Knight Commander of Distinguished Service Order of Ethiopia. He was also a strong supporter of Marcus Garvey's Universal Negro Improvement Association. Morter died on 7 April 1924. A statue of Morter can be found at the end of Albert Street, near the Anglican cathedral, in Belize City. He is not widely known today by the public in Belize."

Slovak courts have never found Ivan Lexa guilty of any wrongdoing and in two cases Lexa was covered by the amnesties granted by then acting President Vladimír Mečiar."

Olteanu was the silver medallist at the 1994 IAAF World Half Marathon Championships, setting a lifetime best of 1:09:15. She was victorious at the 1996 European Cross Country Championships but was stripped of her title as she had failed a test for the steroid stanozolol and received a two-year competitive ban for doping. After her ban had expired, she was again selected for the Romanian cross country and half marathon teams, but failed to medal. She competed in her first marathon in 2002 but retired from international competition in 2003. Among her other achievements are two consecutive 10,000 m titles at the Summer Universiade, as well as circuit wins at the Great South Run, Sapporo Half Marathon and the Chiba and Fukuoka Cross Country meetings."

  "text" : "Lieutenant Colonel Inaba Masao was a Japanese officer during World War II of the Military Affairs Bureau. In 1945, after the Emperor and his ministers were seeking to surrender, he urged to Korechika Anami, the War Minister, that the soldiers be told to keep fighting, especially with the Soviet Union massing its forces. He prepared a statement urging soldiers to fight to the bitter end, without reference to surrender. Two lieutenant colonels, one of them Masahiko Takeshita, came to tell him that the Cabinet was about to issue a statement hinting at surrender, and they hastened to broadcast his message without Anami's approval. The Director of the Information Bureau, Hiroshi Shimomura, concluded that without its broadcast, Anami might be assassinated by younger officers, and so broadcast it. This caused consternation in the government, which feared that his statement would provoke a third atomic bomb, and arranged for the message to be sent as a news broadcast, in English and Morse code, to escape military censors and so arrive in time. When the Kyūjō Incident was plotted, to prevent the emperor's declaration of surrender from being broadcast, Inaba refused to join the conspiracy and told the conspirators that the attempt was useless."

Soon the family moved to Kovrov and then to Ryazan, where Alexander Putin served as an instructor in Ryazan Military Higher School (Ryazanskoye Vysheye Komandnoye Avtombilnoye Uchilische). Igor Putin graduated from Ryazan Military Higher School in 1974. In 1974–1998 Igor Putin served in the Soviet Army and then in Russian Army. In 1998 he retired from the military and moved to Ryazan. In 1998–2000 he worked in Ryazan Oblast Statistics Committee. In 2000–2005 he worked as the Chairman of the Ryazan Licensing Chamber. In 2002 he became the Chairman of Ryazan Coordination Committee of the United Russia party. During those years Igor Putin also obtained degrees from the Volgo-Vyatskaya Academy of State Service (2000) and from Moscow Institute of Economics, Management, and Law (2003) In 2005 Igor Putin moved to Samara to become the Chairman of the Samara Reservoir Plant (part of VolgaBurMash holding).

In September 2010 Igor Putin became a Vice President of Master Bank. In the same month the bank received a lucrative contract with Russian Nanotechnology Corporation. Still Igor Putin held the Vice President position only a few months and retired in December 2010. His retirement coincided with a criminal investigation in which over 30 million Russian roubles was allegedly stolen from the bank by its employees using IT technologies. The investigation accused a leading IT specialist of the bank, Mery Tevanyan of operating a large illegal business with the daily volume up to 500 million Russian roubles using bank's money. In March 2011, five days after conclusion of the investigations Igor Putin returned to the bank as a director. According to the bank he is not supposed to manage its daily operations. Igor Putin also keeps his position as a director of the AVTOVAZBANK. A story by the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project discussed how a number of banks associated with Putin were involved in a massive money laundering scheme dubbed \"The Laundromat\". The system moved money through Putin's and other banks using fake loans between offshore, paper companies, bribed Moldovan judges and Moldovan and Latvian banks to move money out of Russia and into Europe."

  "text" : "Ifor Pritchard (1940 - 9 October 2010) was an artist and former art teacher predominantly at Ysgol Sir Huw Owen, Caernarfon in North Wales, retiring in 1992. His paintings mostly drew on his childhood in the North Wales village of Carmel, Gwynedd and his memories of the local slate quarries. Working with oil and using an impasto technique, he built up the surface of his canvases with thick blocks of solid colour, creating bold and dynamic portraits of remembered and imagined figures of the slate industry. He predominantly utilised a limited palette with a preference for blues, greys and purples, although exceptions include the quarrymen's brass band, their outfits rendered in bright reds and vibrant oranges. Pritchard first exhibited his slate-inspired work at an exhibition at Glynllifon, near Caernarfon in 2007 exhibiting 30 original works. At his peak he exhibited 60 pieces in June 2009 at the Oriel Ynys Mon, Anglesey. Pritchard died aged 70 in Porthmadog following a short illness. A book titled 'Craig yr Oesoedd / True Grit' was posthumously published in October 2011 by Carreg Gwalch cataloging in 80 pages some of his best work."

  "text" : "Ingrid Suzanne Johnsrude is a Canadian neuroscientist, a professor of psychology at University of Western Ontario, and the holder of the Canada Research Chair in Cognitive Neuroscience. Her research involves brain imaging, the connections between brain structure and language ability, and the diagnosis of degenerative brain diseases in the elderly. Johnsrude did her undergraduate studies in psychology at Queens University, graduating in 1989, and went on for graduate studies to McGill University, where she received her Ph.D. in 1997 under the supervision of Brenda Milner. After postdoctoral studies at University College London, she became a scientist at the Cognition and Brain Sciences Unit in Cambridge, England, where she studied the relationship between neuroanatomy and the ability to be affected by operant conditioning as well as the brain structures active during speech recognition. She returned to Queens University as a faculty member in 2004. Johnsrude's 2001 work on voxel-based morphometry in the journal NeuroImage is one of the most heavily cited papers in that journal. In 2003, Johnsrude and her co-authors received an Ig Nobel Prize in Medicine for their work showing that London taxi drivers had more highly developed hippocampi than those in other professions.In 2004, while still an assistant professor, Johnsrude was awarded her Canada Research Chair; it was renewed in 2009. In 2009, Canadian prime minister Stephen Harper presented Johnsrude with the NSERC E.W.R. Steacie Fellowship, an award given annually to a small number of younger Canadian researchers with an international reputation for excellent research. In 2010, Johnsrude was elected to the Global Young Academy."

Her public statement challenged both the Gaddafi government and the taboo against discussing sex crimes in Libya. Government security forces dragged her out of the hotel to an unknown destination, and attacked journalists who tried to help her. Government representatives claimed she was drunk, mentally ill, a prostitute, and a thief, and said she would be charged with slander. The Washington Post described her as a \"symbol of defiance against Gaddafi.\" She was released from government detention after three days, and was interviewed several times by Libya TV—an opposition satellite channel—and by CNN, during which she offered graphic details of her rape and subsequent detention by government officials. She fled Libya with a defecting military officer, who helped her cross into Tunisia, dressed in a Berber tribal costume to hide her identity. She was initially offered protection by European diplomats in Qatar and applied for refugee status there. After initially protecting her, in early June 2011 Qatar forcibly deported her back to Libya. On June 4, 2011, she was granted asylum in the United States with the help of Hillary Clinton. al-Obeidi eventually settled in Colorado under the name Eman Ali. However, she subsequently was charged with a number of violent offenses, including a February 2014 assault on two patrons at a downtown bar in Boulder, Colorado for which she was convicted in May 2015 of a Class 4 felony."

A man reputed to possess prodigious strength but a mild manner, he fought and lost one of the most notorious boxing matches of the era, a physically mismatched contest against the English Champion Tom Johnson. Such was the mismatch that Perrins was described as Hercules fighting a boy. During the period when he was prizefighting Perrins worked for Boulton and Watt, manufacturers of steam engines, based at their Soho Foundry, Birmingham, but also travelled around the country and at times acted as an informant on people who were thought to have breached his employer's patents. In the later years of his life he also ran a public house in Manchester and undertook engineering work on his own account. He was appointed to lead the Manchester fire brigade in 1799, and died a little over 12 months later in the performance of his duties."

Igor is married to Elena Tulipanov, also a painter, since 1977. Igor Tiulpanov employs Surrealist imagery in his meticulous illusionistic paintings, incorporating stylistic elements from Leonardo da Vinci, Hieronymus Bosch, and Jan van Eyck. These paintings are pictorial retracings of the artist's subconscious and show characteristics of what Freud called \"dream work,\" including the existence of contrary elements side by side, the condensation of two or more objects or images, and the use of objects that have symbolic value. Igor Tulipanov is influenced by and sometimes incorporates whole scenes from Hieronymus Bosch in his paintings. The symbols Tulipanov uses, various statues of pagan gods, spectacles, books, tears, eggs, mirrors pass from painting to painting but the meaning of each symbol changes depending on the painting. What remains always is the incredible detail, the logic in his compositions, the precision of his tiny brush strokes, his infatuation with the world and its mysteries. Sometimes it takes a year to finish a painting, sometimes even longer.Igor Tulipanov's purpose is to create a world harmonious and complicated in its simplicity, a world that exists in his imagination. His paintings are exhibited in private collections and museums of the U.S.A., Russia, Japan, Argentina, and other countries."

  "text" : "Israel \"Iso\" Szajewicz (1910–41) was a Polish-Jewish composer and conductor born in Kutno, Poland. His parents, Dineh and Józef Szajewicz, were Yiddish actors, on the road with a wandering Jewish theatre troupe. He was raised by his step-father, the actor Avrom Kurtz. He worked as a hairdresser and taught himself music in his young years. In 1926 he studied violin and theatre for one year at the Jewish Music Institute in Wilno. In 1927 he moved to Warsaw and began teaching at Mieczysław Karłowicz's school as well as playing violin in theatre orchestras. In 1931 he became music director at the Kaminski Theatre, then studied at the State music conservatory and in 1937 received an award for distinction in direction from Professor Valerian Berdyayev and in composition from Karol Szymanowski. Conducted concerts of the Jewish Music Society. He composed music for theatre and film. One of his first major works was the music for נח פאנדרע by Zalman Shneur, produced by Zygmunt Turkow at the Novoshchi Theatre; he followed with music for Di kishef-makher (The sorcerer) by pl:Klara Segałowicz;Soreh-Sheyndl fun Yehupetz directed by Ida Kamińska; Meylekh-freylekh by Yankev Preger, produced by Michał Weichert in 1938 in Łódź, later in Warsaw; revue programs for Shimon Dzigan and Israel Shumacher's revi-teater. He wrote the music for the films Tkies-khaf (The Vow) and On a heym (Homeless) (directed in Warsaw by Alexander Martin from the drama byJacob Gordin), in which Wiera Gran sang his Aheym, aheym and Beser in troym tsurik. His greatest artistic success was the musical score to Lope de Vega's Fuenteovejuna, a show produced by Ida Kamińska's theatre company. He also composed the music for Der Tunkeler's musical comedy Got's ganovim (God's thieves) produced by the Vilner Troupe in 1935. When the rise of anti-Semitism led to a \"extermination process of Jewish musicians from their Polish work-places\" and when in response a Jewish symphonic orchestra was created in Warsaw, Szajewicz was chosen as its director. Its concerts, held on Saturdays and Sundays between 10 and 12 in the Novoshtshi Theatre, were a great success. At the outbreak of World War II, Szajewicz fled to Białystok, where he was chosen to lead the symphonic orchestra. He also toured in Minsk. When German and Soviet conflict broke out he wasn't able to evacuate; he headed back to Warsaw to be with his mother, but somewhere in the woods between Białystok and Baranowicze he was killed."

  "text" : "Ivan Yordanov Venedikov (Bulgarian: Иван Йорданов Венедиков) was a Bulgarian archaeologist, historian, thracologist and philologist who studied Thracian and medieval history, archaeology, art and culture; Bulgarian cultural and artistic heritage. Ivan Venedikov was born in Sofia on 10 January 1916. Between 1934 and 1939 he studied classical phylology in the Sofia University. Among his lectors were Aleksandar Balabanov, Dimitar Dechev, Gavril Katsarov, Veselin Beshevliev, Bogdan Filov, Petar Mutafchiev. His first work was Phonetics of the Latin Inscriptions from the Bulgarian Lands, published in 1942. Between 1941 and 1944 he worked in the Museum in Skopje and made his first excavations discovering the large antique and medieval town Bargala and the medieval Kozyak. Venedikov worked in the Department of Antiquity in the National Archaeological Museum between 1945 and 1973 and later worked in the Department of Antique Archaeology in the National Historical Museum. In 1981 he became a Professor. He was also a lecturer on Thracian history in the Sofia University. Venedikov had more than 150 publications on Thracian history, culture, art and language based on many studied archaeological sites and monuments. He made a periodization of the Thracian art; researched and restored the outlook of the Thracian chariots. In 1982 he organized an exhibition of Thracian art which included the finest objects from all over Bulgaria which travelled in many cities around the world. He also studied the old Bulgar inscriptions and concluded that the Bulgar language was still spoken in the beginning of the 9th century. Venedikov also proved that Preslav, which would become capital of the Bulgarian Empire in 893, already existed as a significant settlement in the beginning of the 9th century. In 1979 he made monography on the military and administrative organization of the Bulgarian Empire and made research on many titles and offices of the Bulgarian rulers and nobility."

In 1818 he became the apprentice of James Pigot, a publisher of trade directories. Either in 1833, or after the death of Pigot's son in 1840, Pigot made Slater a partner in his firm, which was then called Pigot & Slater. Pigot died in 1843 and Slater then published directories in his own name. Due to fierce competition from the firm of Kelly & Co., which in 1845 began expanding to other cities from its home market of London, Slater's company withdrew from the southern England market after 1852 and only published directories for Ireland, Scotland, and northern England. After Slater's death, his company became a limited-liability company. A majority of its shares were acquired by Kelly & Co. in 1892, although the Kelly name did not appear on the newly acquired directories until years later (not until 1921 in Scotland)."

Ekeland has written influential monographs and textbooks on nonlinear functional analysis, the calculus of variations, and mathematical economics, as well as popular books on mathematics, which have been published in French, English, and other languages. Ekeland is known as the author of Ekeland's variational principle and for his use of the Shapley–Folkman lemma in optimization theory. He has contributed to the periodic solutions of Hamiltonian systems and particularly to the theory of Kreĭn indices for linear systems (Floquet theory). Ekeland helped to inspire the discussion of chaos theory in Michael Crichton's 1990 novel Jurassic Park."

He arrived in Lodz Yiddish theater in 1918, with a translation of Lermontov's Spanish Blood (called Jewish Blood); soon afterwards, at Julius Adler's request he translated Shakespeare's Othello. He knew several languages and had a knack for dramaturgy. He then moved to Warsaw, where he was hired in 1926 by the Scala Theater to write song lyrics, for instance to Osip Dimov's Yoshke Muzikant. In 1927 he wrote lyrics for the operetta Velvele Shmudnik (music by Sh. Vayntroyb and David Beigelman). He wrote many songs for the revi-teaters Scala and Sambatiyon. In 1935 he acted with Alexander Granakh in Alter Katsisne's Velt-gevisn in Lodz. He wrote a play called Nokh Halbe Nakht (Nuch halbe nacht, After midnight) which debuted June 4, 1942 (directed by Chaim Sandler). He is best known for the song Vu ahin zol ikh geyn? (Where Shall I Go?) written with \"tango-king\" Oskar Strock. Two other notable songs are Kum tsu mir (Come to me), a tango, and Mayn libeslid (My Love Song), both to music by Pawel Brajtman, premiered in yiddish theaters in Vienna and Bucharest. On a lighter note, he wrote Yiddish lyrics (performed by Menashe Oppenheim) to the song Sex Appeal made famous by Eugeniusz Bodo in the 1937 movie Piętro wyżej (Upstairs). He wrote the comedy Cype fun Nowolipe (Cipe fun Nowolipie) which played in June 1941 at the Eldorado Theater, and a revue called Wesele zydowskie (Jewish wedding) at the Melody Palace. He died in the gas chambers of Auschwitz."

  "text" : "Isaac A. Van Amburgh (1811–1865) was an American animal trainer who developed the first trained wild animal act in modern times. By introducing jungle acts into the circus, Van Amburgh paved the way for combining menageries with circuses. After that, menageries began using equestrian and clown performances in circus rings. Gradually the distinction between circus and menagerie faded. From the humble beginning of cage-cleaner in the Zoological Institute of New York, Van Amburgh quickly gained notoriety for his acts of daring, for example placing his bare arm and even head inside the jaws of a wild cat. Also known for his domineering attitude toward his animals, he earned the title “The Lion King.” Despite the disapproval of some for his brutal treatment of animals, Van Amburgh remained very popular and successful, beginning his own menagerie which he took to Europe. He died a wealthy man, and his name continued to be used in the circus world for more than a century after."

  "text" : "Ivan Pavlovich Yuvachev (1860–1940) was a narodovolets, i.e., a member of The People's Will (Narodnaya Volya) revolutionary organization that assassinated Tsar Alexander II, after seven failed assassination attempts. He was a defendant at the Trial of the Fourteen in 1884, where he was found guilty of \"terrorist activities\". Yuvachev served four years at Peter and Paul Fortress on the Neva River, and at the Schlusselburg Fortress. He was imprisoned with fellow narodovolet Alexander Ulyanov, brother of Vladimir Lenin, who was hanged there. In this period he experienced a religious awakening, or perhaps a mental breakdown. Rejecting an offer to be released to a monastery, Yuvachev served eight additional years of hard labor on the Sakhalin peninsula. Anton Chekhov came to know Yuvachev well in this period, and later wrote about Yuvachev in a text recalling his time at Sakhalin. Yuvachev emerged from prison a vocal pacifist, and he authored two memoirs and several religious-mystical tracts. Yuvachev is the father of Russian poet Daniil Kharms. A popular account of Kharm's birth has Yuvachev predicting the precise day of his son's birth in advance, and, from a telephone on Leo Tolstoy's estate, ordering his wife to adhere to the date. She gave birth to her son on the date named by Yuvachev."

  "text" : "Isotta degli Atti (late 1432 or 1433 – 9 July 1474)was an Italian Renaissance woman, who was the mistress and later wife of the condottiero and lord of Rimini Sigismondo Pandolfo Malatesta She was born in Rimini, the daughter of Francesco degli Atti, a wealthy wool trader and banker. She was noticed by Sigismondo Malatesta at the age of 12 or 13, in the period when his nearby residence was being restored and the lord of Rimini was a guest of Francesco. As early as 1447 Sigismondo and Isotta had perhaps a son, Giovanni, who died as a newborn; he was buried in the Malatesta church of San Francesco. Their relationship became public only in 1449, after the death of Sigismondo's second wife, Polissena. The two married in 1456. During the period in which Sigismondo Pandolfo had been excommunicated by Pope Pius II, Isotta governed Rimini on his behalf. After her husband's death (1468), she acted as regent for her son Sallustio. The latter was assassinated the following year by Roberto Malatesta, an illegitimate son of Sigismondo Pandolfo, who took control of Rimini. She died in 1474 and was buried in the church of San Francesco. She is featured in Ezra Pound's Cantos."

He is a former member of AKEL. Although he is a citizen of the Republic of Cyprus and lives in the area controlled by it, he was not allowed to vote because he was a Turkish Cypriot for forty years. He applied to the European Court of Human Rights in 2004, and the court ruled: Consequently, the applicant, as a member of the Turkish–Cypriot community living in the Government-controlled area of Cyprus, was completely deprived of any opportunity to express his opinion in the choice of the members of the house of representatives of the country of which he was a national and where he had always lived. Considering that the very essence of the applicant's right to vote, as guaranteed by Article 3 of Protocol No. 1, had been denied, the Court held, unanimously, that there had been a violation of Article 3 of Protocol No. 1. After this case, the right to vote was given to the Turkish Cypriots residing in the Republic of Cyprus. However, Turkish Cypriots still cannot run in presidential elections and the Turkish Cypriots which reside in Northern Cyprus cannot vote in elections, even though they are citizens of the Republic of Cyprus."

  "text" : "Idris Cox (1899–1989) was a Welsh communist activist and newspaper editor. Born in Maesteg, Cox grew up in Cwmfelin, where he worked in a coal mine from a young age. His family was highly religious, and he attended chapel three times each Sunday, but he lost interest in religion after becoming active in the trade union movement, and was involved in the South Wales miners' strike of 1915. He was elected to the Management Committee of the Garth Miners' Institute at the age of 18 and, in 1920, he became the lodge's delegate to coalfield conferences. Becoming interested in Marxism, he served as Chairman of the local miners' lodge during the 1921 lockout. In 1923, the South Wales Miners' Federation granted Cox a scholarship, enabling him to study at the Central Labour College in London and, after the 1924 general election, he joined the Communist Party of Great Britain (CPGB). He returned to Wales in 1925, but was unable to find work, other than a short spell as a deputy checkweighman. Instead, he founded a National Unemployed Workers' Movement branch in Maesteg, and continued his communist activity there. By 1926, Cox was an Area Organiser for the CPGB in Mid Glamorgan. However, he was also active in the Labour Party, and became vice-chairman of its Maesteg branch in 1927. He continued his rise in the CPGB, becoming District Secretary that year, and was co-opted to its National Executive in 1928, attending the Sixth Congress of the Communist International that year. Cox returned to London in 1929 to join the CPGB's political bureau. He also worked as a correspondent for the Workers' Weekly, and soon became National Organiser of the party. In 1935, he became editor of the replacement party newspaper, the Daily Worker. Shortly after, he returned to Wales, as Secretary of the Welsh District of the CPGB. He served in this role until 1951, and stood unsuccessfully for the party in Rhondda East at the 1951 general election. Later that year, Cox became Secretary of the International Department of the CPGB, and was heavily involved in the Movement for Colonial Freedom. He retired in 1970, and wrote his autobiography, Story of a Welsh Rebel. Cox died on Sunday June 25th 1989."

  "text" : "Irene Gilbert (August 25, 1934 – May 21, 2011) was a German-born American actress and school director, who co-founded the Stella Adler Academy in Los Angeles with actress Joanne Linville in 1985. She also served as the Academy's director for approximately 20 years after the school's establishment. Gilbert was born Irene Liebert in Germany on August 25, 1934. She immigrated to New York City with her parents, Gaston and Lucie Liebert, just before the outbreak of World War II. Her parents were killed by a drunk driver when she was just five years old. She was raised by her aunt and her four older brothers. She changed to name to Irene Gilbert when she began her acting career, because she reportedly felt that Gilbert seemed \"movie-star-esque.\" Her acting career extended into the late 1980s. Her television credits included roles in Cannon, Barnaby Jones and Emergency! in the 1970s. Gilbert became friends with New York City-based acting coach, Stella Adler, during the 1960s. In 1985, Gilbert and actress Joanne Linville pursued Adler to open a branch of the Stella Adler Academy in Los Angeles. Gilbert, Linville and Adler are considered the school's co-founders. Gilbert who also serve as the school's director for twenty years. A fire at the school, which was originally located in a small theater at Hollywood Boulevard and Argyle Avenue, forced the school's temporary closure in 1991. The school's building was further threatened with demolition to make way for a proposed subway line at the time of Stellar Adler's death in 1992. Gilbert moved and reopened the school in 1994 at a building which was once the Embassy Club, a private club during the 1930s located at Hollywood Boulevard and Highland Avenue. She continued to teach acting at the school and produce stage productions. The Steallar Academy of Acting and Theater in Los Angeles has named one of its theaters, the Irene Gilbert Theatre, in honor of her contributions. Irene Gilbert died at her son's home in Eureka, California, of complications from Alzheimer's disease on May 21, 2011, at the age of 76. She was survived by her son, Randall Garrett Herzon."

  "text" : "Ivane Gomarteli (Georgian: ივანე გომართელი) (October 2, 1875 – April 19, 1938) was a Georgian physician, political figure, and author involved in the social-democratic movement early in the 20th century. Gomarteli was born in the village of Gorisa in the western Georgian province of Imereti, then part of the Kutais Governorate of the Russian Empire. After graduating from the Medical Faculty of Moscow University in 1899, Gomarteli practiced medicine in his homeland. Around the same time he joined the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party and later adhered to its Menshevik wing. He regularly published medical articles, political commentary and literary criticism in the Georgian press and authored prose fiction. In 1906, he was elected to the 1st State Duma of the Russian Empire, representing the Kutais Governorate. When the Duma was dissolved, Gomarteli was imprisoned for three months for signing the Vyborg Manifesto. In 1907, he moved to work in Tiflis. By 1913, he had distanced himself from the Mensheviks, criticizing their subservience to the Russian Social Democratic Party on the national question and, like the fellow Menshevik journalist Vladimir Darchiashvili, supported the idea of territorial autonomy for Georgia. After Georgia became independent following the Russian Revolution of 1917, Gomarteli was elected to the Georgian National Council and then to the Constituent Assembly of Georgia. After the Soviet takeover of Georgia in 1921, he retired from politics. Most of his work thereafter was as a physician and literary critic. He is buried at the Vake cemetery in Tbilisi."

It argued that thanks to a variety of extralegal practices foreigners are largely excluded from intellectual life in Japan. He went on in 2002 to publish Bamboozled: How America Loses the Intellectual Game with Japan and its Implications for Our Future in Asia, which Foreign Affairs suggested was “destined to arouse passions ....among Japanese nationalists and American liberals”."
