  "text" : "John Fenton-Cawthorne (5 January 1753 – 1 March 1831) was a British Conservative politician, who served as MP for Lincoln between 1783 and 1796 and as MP for Lancaster for four terms in the early 19th century. Fenton-Cawthorne was born in 1753 to James Fenton of Lancaster, a barrister and his wife Elizabeth and educated at Queen’s College, Oxford (1771) and Gray's Inn (1792). He succeeded to the Cawthorne estate in 1781 and took the additional surname of Cawthorne. He was first elected as an MP for Lincoln in January 1783 and was an opponent of the abolition of the slave trade. On 27 November 1795, as Colonel of the Westminster Regiment of Middlesex Militia, Fenton-Cawthorne was arraigned before a court-martial on 14 charges including that of embezzling \"marching guineas\" paid to militia men of the British Army. Found guilty on seven of the charges, he was cashiered as \"unworthy of serving His Majesty in any military capacity whatever\" having \"acted fraudulently and in a scandalous and infamous manner\". Fenton-Cawthorne returned to Parliament in 1806 as MP for Lancaster. His older brother also entered Parliament at the same time as MP for Fife. He married Frances, the daughter and coheiress of J. H. Delaval. Fenton-Cawthorne died on 1 March 1831 in Hanover Street, Hanover Square, London."

Lingo was a former monk and chantry priest, first documented at Llantarnam, a former Cistercian monastery located near the present day suburb of Cwmbran, in southeast Wales, who at some unknown date after the dissolution of Llantarnam in 1536 became a Chantry priest in Cowbridge, in the Vale of Glamorgan, Wales. He was deprived of this post in 1548, but was granted a pension at the maximum rate of £5 per annum. Some time after 1554 he was appointed Vicar of the nearby parish of St. Hilary. In 1560/1 he was returned as absent, and in 1563 his whereabouts were stated to be unknown; no extant record telling when he was replaced has been found. The timing of Lingo's appointment suggests that he might have been sympathetic to Roman Catholicism, and the timing of his departure by 1560/1 suggests it was a consequence of the passage of the Act of Uniformity of 1558 enforcing Anglican religious orthodoxy within the Church of England."

Jerome Anderson was a London based sports agent with Sport Entertainment and Media Group from 2001 until his retirement. Initially focused on the football world, he extended his reach into heavyweight boxing and was Lennox Lewis' agent for his bout against Mike Tyson that was described by The Telegraph as one of “the moments of the decade.” Anderson had a number of football clients prior to his work with SEM and was the first agent to introduce foreign stars to the English Premier League, including Dennis Bergkamp, Marc Overmars and Uwe Rosler. He represented nine of Arsenal’s 1989 title-winning side and has represented over 200 professional footballers. Anderson has now retired from his position at SEM to focus on his other business interests. He was at the forefront of the establishment of the David Rocastle Trust which helps to benefit families and communities. In February 2009 SEM formed a corporate partnership with Kentaro, a Swiss-based sports rights business who are among the major players in the international marketing of football television rights."

Born in Bilston, West Midlands, he was educated at the Royal Academy of Music (RAM) where he was a pupil of Émile Sauret (violin), Ebenezer Prout (counterpoint), and Stewart Macpherson (harmony). He was later named a Fellow of the RAM in 1947. He began his career in England working as a concert violinist, orchestral player, and conductor. During this time he married his wife Cecilia who was a pianist that had been trained by a pupil of Clara Schumann. Their son William Waterhouse also became a notable violinist and pedagogue. Sometime around the year 1910, Waterhouse left England for the United States to join the Minneapolis Symphony Orchestra. He left that post in 1914 to move to Winnipeg, Canada. He lived in Winnipeg for the rest of his life, spending more than five decades teaching and performing in that city. He was responsible for introducing works by several English composers to the city. From 1923-1927 he conducted the Winnipeg Orchestral Club and from 1934-1936 he conducted the Winnipeg String Orchestra. He was named an honorary member of the Manitoba Music Educators Association, the Manitoba Registered Music Teachers' Association, and the Winnipeg Men's Music Club. In 1965 he was awarded an honorary doctorate from the University of Manitoba, and in 1967 the Canadian Federation of Music Teachers' Associations honored him and five other recipients with a centennial citation. His notable students included Lloyd Blackman, George Bornoff, Armand Ferland, Frederick Grinke, Leslie Malowany, Hugo Rignold, Patricia Shand, Gwen Thompson, and his son William."

With Jeremy Stangroom, he edits Think Now, a series of books on social and political philosophy. He is a regular and controversial contributor to The Guardian, commenting on morality and climate change, arguing that the developed nations have a moral obligation to take action. He has a PhD in Philosophy from University College London. In The Ethics of Climate Change, Garvey summarises what moral philosophy does, examines the strength of the evidence for global warming, and analyses various possible policy responses. He argues that the line that taking drastic action to curb global warming would be bad for the economy amounts to “harming people for money”, and gives reasons for individual action on climate change. He has a black belt (second dan) in Jiu Jitsu and coaches the University College London Jiu Jitsu Club, leading it to a record 13 national championships."

An amateur, he was the son of Alfred John Reynolds, the Lord Mayor of Birmingham, who owned a company which cut nails. In 1899, at age 25, he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society and in 1907, he financed the construction of a 30-inch reflecting telescope in Helwan, Egypt, the first large telescope to study objects in the such southerly skies. He also hand-constructed a 28-inch telescope in Harborne. Images from the Reynolds telescope was later used by Gérard de Vaucouleurs in his system of classifying galaxies; Reynolds also published his own classification for spiral galaxies in 1920. Edwin Hubble frequently corresponded with Reynolds, and some of his findings into the classification of stellar bodies seems at least inspired by his work. The Hubble–Reynolds law, a formula for measuring the surface brightness of elliptical galaxies, is named after them."

Thomson also has his own private practice, and is a forensic psychiatrist for Region Ten Community Services. Thomson acquired his B.A. from Duke University in 1970, he acquired his M.D. from the University of Virginia in 1974, and he did his adult psychiatry training at the University of Virginia from 1974 to 1977. Thomson has published papers on a variety of issues, including racism, narcissistic personality disorder, forensic psychiatry, depression and PTSD. He is known for his work on evolutionary psychology, as well as for his exploration of the cognitive and evolutionary basis of religious belief, as presented in his latest book entitled Why We Believe in God(s): A Concise Guide to the Science of Faith. Thomson has been a featured speaker at several atheist conferences including American Atheists 2009 and Atheist Alliance International 2009 for which he spoke about his theories on the cognitive origins of religious belief. In an interview with the Austin American-Statesman, Thomson stated, \"There is a massive, irreconcilable conflict between science and religion. Religion was humanity's original cosmology, biology and anthropology. It provided explanations for the origin of the world, life and humans. Science now gives us increasingly complete explanations for those big three.\""

Vollrath was born on September 19, 1824 in Dörrebach in the Prussian Rhineland, where he learned the trade of molding (casting of wrought iron). He migrated to the United States in the 1840s and settled in Sheboygan in 1853. In 1874 he began to manufacture porcelain enameled ware, and in 1884 founded the Jacob J. Vollrath Manufacturing Company, which grew steadily under his leadership and which he headed until his death in 1898. Vollrath invented \"gray enameling\" (which describes a particular method of manufacture, not a color). Vollrath married Elizabeth Margaret Fuchs in 1847 and had six children. He was the father-in-law (twice) of Kohler Company founder John Michael Kohler and helped him get started in business. He was succeeded as president of The Vollrath Company by his son, Carl August Vollrath, grandson Jean C Vollrath (1894-1976), and great-grandson Walter Jodok Kohler Jr Two other sons, Jacob Vollrath Jr. (1894-1964) and Walter J. Vollrath, Sr, (-1964) had served as officers of the Polar Ware Co., of Kiel, WI. The Vollrath family which he founded was long prosperous and prominent in Sheboygan affairs."

He became Master of the College in circa 1408. He also held preferment in the Diocese of York with his mastership. In 1411, a sentence of excommunication was issued by the Archbishop of Canterbury, Thomas Arundel, against Castell, Fellows at the College — Robert Burton (later Master of the College), John Hamerton, and Adam Redyford — and the College as a whole, due to Lollardy leanings. An appeal to the Pope against the excommunication was made by the bursar of the College, John Ryvell. Castell survived the controversy and continued as Master until 1420. John Castell was appointed a King's Clerk in 1420. In 1421, he became Chancellor of Oxford University, a position he held until 1426."

This supported three new Fellows at the College. The College prospered and developed under Appleton's mastership, especially in the area around Logic Lane (formerly Horseman Lane) off the High Street, to the east of the main part of the College.

In 1758 he published A Vindication of the Protestant Doctrine of Justification and its Prechers and Professors from the unjust Charge of Antinomianism; extracted from a letter of the Rev. Mr. Robt. Trail, a minister in the city of London, to a minister in the country, his object being to testify to the world the doctrines advanced by him in his public ministry, which were laid down by Robert Trail in this letter. In 1762 he published The Safe Retreat from impending Judgments, the substance of a sermon preached by Edwards at Leeds, a second edition of which was issued in 1773. At the end of this sermon is advertised 'The Christian Indeed,' another work by the same author. Edwards also edited A Collection of Hymns and Spiritual songs for the use of Serious and Devout Christians of all Denominations, of which a second edition, \"with alterations\", was published in 1709. He died in 1785. A mezzotint portrait after John Russell, engraved by James Watson, was published by Carington Bowles in 1772."

  "text" : "John Coffin (c. 1751 – May 12, 1838) was an army officer, merchant, judge and political figure in New Brunswick. He represented King's in the Legislative Assembly of New Brunswick from 1785 to 1816. He was born in Boston, the son of Nathaniel Coffin and Elizabeth Barnes. Coffin entered the British Army and fought at the Battle of Bunker Hill. He became a major in the Orange Rangers in 1777, serving in New Jersey and New York, and later transferred to the New York Volunteers, which saw action in Georgia and South Carolina. In 1781, he married Ann Mathews. Coffin became a major in the King's American Regiment in 1782. In 1783, he was placed on half pay and brought his family to what is now New Brunswick. Coffin acquired a large estate from Beamsley Perkins Glasier, where he built a grist mill and a sawmill. He also sold fish, lumber and rum. Coffin was named a justice of the peace and a judge in the Inferior Court of Common Pleas. In 1812, he was named to the New Brunswick Council. Coffin raised the New Brunswick Fencibles during the War of 1812. In 1819, he was given the rank of full general. In 1817, Coffin moved to England but he retained his position on the New Brunswick Council until 1828. He later returned to New Brunswick and died in Westfield Parish. His brother Isaac became a prominent land owner in Quebec.Military HistoryJohn Coffin's sailing skills put him in command of a British frigate soon after his entry into the service. In 1775,as the British were scrambling to get troops from Britain to America to repel the rebel uprising, Coffin was ordered to assist General Howe in bringing his army to the battle. The British arrived in Boston on the 15th of June and Coffin landed his troops two days later onto the grounds at Bunker Hill. As the battle raged, it was on the request of his Colonel to \"Come and watch the fun\", that Coffin found himself fighting hand-to-hand combat with the rebel forces. After the British victory, Coffin was rewarded for his bravery by being presented the rank of Ensign on the Field. Shortly after he was once again promoted to a Lieutenant. After the British evacuation of Boston in March 1776, Coffin was asked to command four hundred troops in New York. This small army became known as the Orange Rangers and consisted mainly of mounted rifle soldiers. In 1777 the Orange Rangers helped to defeat Gen. George Washington in the Battle of Long Island. By 1778 Coffin had moved to the south, namely Georgia, where he commanded a cavalry unit made up of loyal planters. His bravery in the battles of Savannah and Hobkirks Hill along with his success in the Battle of Cross Creek, won Coffin high praise from both his superiors and the Rebel forces.Major Coffin opened the battle at Eutaw Springs when he and a few of his men, who were out digging yams, came across the rebel army of General Green. His fire on the advancing enemy drew the attention of the British encampment and averted a surprise attack. As the war was coming to an end, Coffin found himself in Virginia where he was presented with a sword and new rank of Major by Lord Cornwallis. With the noose tightening on the British, and the troops facing starvation, Major Coffin continued to stage daring raids through the enemy lines in search of food. During this time the rebels posted a large reward for Coffin's capture, but it was never collected. Sir Guy Carleton, the Commander and Chief of the British forces appointed Coffin, Major of the American Regiment, shortly before the end of the war. Once the war ended, the British secured his safe passage to his new home in New Brunswick where at age twenty-eight he lay down his sword and began his new life."

This led to the Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands (RAMSI). In July 2004, he benefited from a Cabinet reshuffle, leaving the Opposition and joining the government as Minister of State assisting the Prime Minister.

  "text" : "Janice Mirikitani (born February 4, 1941) is an American Sansei poet and activist. She was born in Stockton, California, to Shigemi and Ted Mirikitani, who were Nisei farmers in San Joaquin County. During World War II, she was interned along with her family at the Rohwer War Relocation Center in Arkansas. Following the war, the Mirikitani family moved to Chicago. After her parents were divorced, Janice was brought back to a chicken farm at Petaluma, California, with her mother, where they would be near the remainder of their family. During the time that followed, Janice Mirikitani became the victim of sexual molestation by her step-father up to the age of sixteen, and was saved from suicide only by the love and care of her grandmother. She would later speak of the pain of her incestuous abuse through her poetry. Janice Mirikitani attended UCLA, earning a Bachelor of Arts degree. During this time, she struggled with her ethnic identity, which she would later portray through her poetry. After gaining her teaching credentials, she taught in the Contra Costa School District for a year. She worked at Glide Memorial Church in the Tenderloin district of San Francisco as an administrative assistant. From her first marriage, which ended in divorce in 1966, Janice Mirikitani gave birth to her daughter, Tianne Tsukiko Miller, in 1967. Janice Mirikitani then entered graduate school for creative writing at San Francisco State University, but later discontinued herstudies. After participating in the Asian American Political Alliance, she joined Third World Communications and became the editor of Aion, thefirst Asian American literary magazine, from 1970–71. She edited two anthologies for Third World Communications: Third World Women (1972) and Time to Greez! Incantations from the Third World (1975). Mirikitani then became project director for Ayumi: A Japanese American Anthology (1980). After two years of activism for Glide Memorial United Methodist Church in 1969 she became the program director. In 1982 Mirikitani was married to Reverend Cecil Williams. That same year she was chosen as the president of theGlide Foundation, where she was responsible for fund raising and budget oversight. In 2000, she was named the second poet laureate for the city of San Francisco. The California State Assembly named her Woman of the Year for the 17th Assembly District."

He set the record before a national television audience, running in open competition at the Pepsi Invitational, May 6, 1979 at the University of California, Los Angeles. The record would stand until June 20, 2008, when it was surpassed by German Fernandez from Riverbank High School, who ran an 8:34.40 at the Nike Outdoor Nationals. Fernandez had run an 8:34.23 for 3200 meters three weeks earlier at the CIF California State Meet, which was a faster time for the slightly shorter distance. The CIF mark is the current NFHS national record at the official distance. Nelson's mark was set before the event became the 3200 meters. Converted, Fernandez' mark was equivalent to about an 8:37.5 2 mile (slightly slower than Nelson). Nelson was also on the United States team at the 1979 IAAF World Cross Country Championships, finishing 4th overall in the junior men's division, handily besting future star Steve Cram in the process. As a precursor to the record, he ran an indoor 2 mile at the Sunkist Invitational in 8:55.1. A few weeks later, in an open race in the Jack in the Box Indoor Invitational in San Diego he ran an outstanding 8:42.7, which was narrowly behind Gerry Lindgren's all-time high school best, set indoors in 1964. He won the CIF California State Meet twice in 1978 and 1979. He went undefeated his senior cross country season, 14 for 14 while setting 14 course records in the process, including the famed Mt. SAC course. Prior to the cross country season, Nelson was reportedly running 100 miles a week, peaking at 142, inspired by (among others) the success of local runner Mark Covert winning the Division II NCAA Men's Cross Country Championship. After his success in high school, Nelson went to the University of Oregon on full scholarship, joining top runners Alberto Salazar, Rudy Chapa, Art Boileau and Jim Hill. There he sustained an injury, which eventually drove him from the university. The following year he showed up healthy at Glendale Community College (California), where his individual victory led his team to the State Community College Championships in Cross Country. The women's team also won in 1980, the first time a school had won both championships in the same season. But Nelson was injured again, twice. By 1982, he decided not to continue running. The entire 1980 championship team, men and women, including Nelson was inducted into the Gendale College Athletic Hall of Fame in 2006. As an individual, Nelson was inducted in 2009."

Black was also an agent for Blair and Glenie, a Scottish firm which traded in timber. In 1787, he went into business in Saint John for himself. His brother William and two cousins later joined him in the business. He also became involved in the trade of salted fish with the West Indies and established his own trading fleet of at least nine vessels. Black encouraged the local production of hemp for the production of cord for use on ships. In 1806, he moved to Halifax, Nova Scotia. Black was named president of the North British Society in 1809. In 1813, he was named to the Nova Scotia Council. Black was married twice: first to Mary, the widow of John McGeorge, in 1797 and then to Catherine, the daughter of Christopher Billopp, in 1807. Black constructed a house in Halifax, displaying influences from contemporary Scottish and Aberdonian architecture of the time. After suffering poor health later in life and travelling to Britain in hopes of a cure, Black died in Aberdeen. His daughter Rosina Jane married James Boyle Uniacke."

After his birth the family moved to Matara, Sri-Lanka, where they spent several years before moving to Harmer's Avenue in Wellawatte, Colombo. He studied at the University of London. During the 1950s, he began writing stories while working as a school teacher. In 1963, he became a broadcaster for Radio Ceylon while writing skits and dramas for the Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation. James' first novel A Quiet Place was published in 1968, followed by Call of the Kirala in 1971. In 1978, he left broadcasting to devote himself full-time to writing. He published more English language novels than any other Sri-Lankan author. His work suffered some heavy criticism because English was becoming marginalized in the nationalistic passion in Sri-Lanka during the 1960s and the 1971 JVP Insurrection. He was the first Sri-Lankan author to have a novel published by Penguin India and has received retroactive acclaim. James was married to an Australian national named Sonia. He had no children and died in 1997."

He was a citizen and weaver and was appointed first of the first assistants of the Clothier's Company on 23 September 1590. He was bailiff of Worcester in 1593 and 1595. In 1604 Coucher was elected Member of Parliament for Worcester. He was re-elected MP for Worcester in 1614, 1621 and 1624. He was an alderman of Worcester in 1621. In 1628 he was re-elected again for Worcester and sat until 1629 when King Charles decided to rule without parliament for eleven years. Coucher was fined £10 on 4 March 1631 for not taking a knighthood at the coronation. At the age of 79, Coucher was re-elected MP for Worcester for the Short Parliament in April 1640 and again for the Long Parliament in November 1640. He tried hard to get out of the election but could not. He probably never took his seat in the Long Parliament because of his age, and was constantly excused his attendance. He was still living in 1648."

  "text" : "John Graefer or Johann Andreas Graeffer (1 January 1746 – 7 August 1802) was a German botanist nurseryman born in Helmstedt. Graeffer/Graefer is remembered by garden historians as having introduced a number of exotic plants to British gardens and to have worked for the king of Naples at the palace of Caserta. Trained by Philip Miller at the Chelsea Physic Garden, London, one of the most prominent botanical gardens of Europe during the 18th century, Graeffer was subsequently gardener to the Earl of Coventry at Croome Court, Worcestershire, which was being landscaped by Capability Brown, and then to James Vere, of Kensington Gore, a founder of the Royal Horticultural Society Graeffer struck out on his own as a partner with Archibald Thompson and the prominent nurseryman James Gordon in Gordon's long-established Mile End nursery near the New Globe, Stepney, just beyond the East End of London. After Gordon's retirement and his death in 1780, the nursery at Mile End was inherited by Gordon's three sons. In August 1781, it was reported in L'ésprit des Journaux, that MM Grœffer et Bessel had been issued a royal patent (dated 30 December 1780) for their preparation of cooked and preserved vegetables for the Royal Navy and the use of those on sea voyages; it was the first recorded patent for preserving vegetables by drying them. For that purpose, it was reported, they had purchased 200 arpents of land near the \"nouvelle globe\", Mile End, for plantings, which appears to be Gordon's long-established plant nursery. The patent was issued for preserving \"a vegetable of the Brassica kind, generally known by the name of green and brown borecole, scotch or other kale with a salt solution and drying so it will keep for up to a year.\" Among Graeffer's introductions to British horticulture by far the most familiar was the variegated form of Aucuba japonica, the loved and loathed \"Spotted Laurel\" of gardens, which he introduced to British horticulture in 1783, at first as a plant for a heated greenhouse; it became widely cultivated as the \"Gold Plant\" by 19th-century gardeners. According to John Claudius Loudon he was also responsible for the introduction of Pyrus bollwylleriana, the Bollwyller pear (later called Shipova), and P. baccata (later called Malus baccata), the Siberian wild crab. Another of his introductions was Sideroxylon melanophloeos (later called Rapanea melanophloeos), from the Cape Province, 1784. Not all his introductions took: in 1783 Graeffer introduced Fumaria nobilis, a little alpine plant native to the Altai in Siberia, but it was subsequently lost to horticulture and reintroduced; he catalogued 80 species of plants suitable for rock gardens in 1789. Graham Stuart Thomas who knew the 1794 edition, found it \"certainly the first 'quick reference' book on alpines that I have come across: he gives full particulars of descriptions and cultivation in a tabulated list. I think he was entitled to claim: 'The Author proposes in his use of his great variety of Herbaceous Plants a more constant and uniform and gay Attraction of Gardens, than has been hitherto pointed out, or adopted'\". He also issued A Descriptive Catalogue of Upwards of Eleven Hundred Species and Varieties of Herbaceous Or Perennial Plants that same year. In the 1790s Graeffer obtained a recommendation from Sir Joseph Banks, to be employed as head gardener to the king of Naples; at the royal palace of Caserta he introduced elements of the English landscape garden to the extensive formal plan, the Giardino Inglese instigated by Sir William Hamilton, for King Ferdinand, who eventually took an interest in it, after Sir William had urged Queen Maria Carolina, as Hamilton reported to Banks from Caserta 22 April 1794, \"that it would be a constant reproach to this country the having had by your goodness such a man as Graeffer for more than ten years without having had the least profit from his well known talents\". A knowledgeable visitor, Sir James Edward Smith, founder of the Linnean Society, has left an account of Graeffer's unsuccessful try at introducing the English taste: Mr Graeffer, a very ingenious gardener recommended to the queen of Naples by sir Joseph Banks, was then employed in laying out a garden for her majesty in the English taste, to which purpose a portion of ground was allotted nor far from the palace; but unluckily in full view of a stupendous brick wall , built with Herculean labour for the purpose of keeping the above-mentioned cascade in its place. No plantation whatever could conceal this glaring wall from any part of the garden; nor could any climbing plants reach near to its top. The ground was besides occupied by miserable olives, with scarcely a picturesque tree to turn to account. Nevertheless Mr. Graeffer had succeeded, we thought, wonderfully. He had formed some very pleasant lawns, interspersed with clumps of myrtle and other shrubs, and the whole wore a very promising appearance. But unfortunately none of the Neapolitans could see any kind of beauty in his performances, and they complained of his introducing so vulgar a thing as myrtle! The queen was much disposed to be pleased, but she could not stem the tide of opinion; nor did the king approve of the expense: so the whole was given up some time after. With more success, Graeffer, who must have had plenty of time on his hands, published a catalogue of the plants at Caserta, Synopsis plantarum regii viridarii Caserti (Naples 1803). In 1799, on Sir William Hamilton's suggestion, he became bailiff of Admiral Horatio Nelson's estate at Bronte, Sicily, where Graeffer was expected to reorganize the agriculture along progressive English lines; his extravagant ideas, however, consumed the income Nelson expected from the estate: to Lady Hamilton Nelson wrote \"I hope Graeffer is going on so at Bronté; I am sure I take nothing from that estate.\". Graeffer died in Bronte in 1802."

  "text" : "Joseph Sullivan MNZM (born 11 April 1987 in Rangiora, New Zealand) is a New Zealand rower. As a student at Queen Charlotte College in Picton, Sullivan competed at the 2003, 2004 and 2005 national secondary school rowing championships (Maadi Cup). He was a member of the crews that won the boys under-18 double sculls for the school three years running, and won the boys under-18 single sculls events in 2004 and 2005. He won back-to-back gold medals in the men's double sculls with rowing partner Nathan Cohen at both the 2010 (at Lake Karapiro, by six hundredths of a second over Germans Hans Gruhne and Stephan Krüger) and 2011 World Rowing Championships (in Slovenia). It was the first gold medal win for a New Zealand premier double sculls combination at the world championships. At the 2012 Summer Olympics at Eton Dorney, Windsor, Sullivan and rowing partner Nathan Cohen won the gold medal in the men's double sculls. They broke the Olympic best time in the heats. In the finals they were in last place at the 500 m mark, in fifth place at the 1000 m mark, in fourth at the 1500 m mark, and then sprinted as the line approached to take first for the victory, with a last quarter of 1:33. They won with a time of 6 minutes, 31.67 seconds. They finished ahead of the Italy's Alessio Sartori and Romano Battisti by 1:13 seconds, and Slovenian 2000 Olympic champions and 2004 silver medalists Luka Špik and Iztok Čop came in third. Sullivan and Cohen were awarded a Halberg Award for \"New Zealand's Favourite Sporting Moment\". Sullivan won five consecutive world titles at U23 and Elite World Rowing Championships and is very good at what he does. Sullivan was made a Member of the New Zealand Order of Merit in the 2013 New Year's Honours, for his services to rowing. In June 2014, Sullivan announced he was retiring from rowing in order to pursue a career with the New Zealand Fire Service as a firefighter."

  "text" : "Jack Chase was an African-American middleweight, who boxed in the 1930s and 40s. He was born in Texas and fought mainly on the west coast of the United States. He boxed under the name ‘Young Joe Lewis’ for the first part of his career, before changing to Jack Chase in 1942. His official fight count stands at 122, but it is believed he competed in an additional 40 plus fights prior to 1936, during which time his full record is unknown. He was ranked second in the world in his division, but never took part in a world title fight. He was included in the group dubbed ‘Black Murderers’ Row’, by Budd Schulberg, of boxers of the era who were so feared that they were avoided by title holders and so were unable to ever secure a title shot. Jack Chase did win several regional belts in the US, including the Colorado state title, the Rocky Mountain Regional Middleweight and Welterweight Titles in the 1930s and the California State's Middlweight and Light Heavyweight titles in the 1940s. He retired from boxing in 1948. Chase had several run ins with the law during his life, including serving jail time in Colorado on a few occasions and being arrested for shooting fellow boxer Aaron Wade in California."

He followed his father in constructing marine steam engines and in 1854 established the compound engine as its most efficient form, which made the use of steamships more competitive than sail (also see Maritime history#Age of Steam). He took out numerous patents and expanded the business to employ thousands of workers."

Grost. collectum.’ 2. ‘Sermones Dominicales’ (fifty-eight in number; there are three copies among the Harleian MSS. in the British Museum, one of which contains a note stating that the sermons were finished in 1431). 3. Two other volumes of ‘Sermones.’ 4. ‘Lecturæ sacræ Scripturæ.’ 5. ‘Pera Peregrini.’ A note on the margin of one of his works declares that in 1420 he made a present of books to Balliol College."

  "text" : "Originally intended to be a documentary about \"three guilty teenagers on trial for murder\", Sinofsky and Berlinger soon decided that their film Paradise Lost would take a different path. Paradise Lost chronicles the 1993 murders of three 8-year-old boys, Stephen Branch, Christopher Byers, and Michael Moore in rural Arkansas, and argues that the fear and panic of satanism, along with questionable police work, led to the arrests and convictions of three teenagers, Damien Echols, Jason Baldwin, and Jessie Miskelley for the murders, otherwise known as the West Memphis Three. Since its 1996 premier on HBO, the film has helped fuel interest and support for the convicted men. Some believe the three were convicted more for their choices in fashion and music than for actual evidence. The first film was followed in 2000 by Paradise Lost 2: Revelations which revealed more evidence and findings that intended to further prove the innocence of Baldwin, Echols, and Misskelley. The film explores the possibility that the three children could have been murdered by the stepfather of Christopher Byers, John Mark Byers. Paradise Lost 3: Purgatory (2011) exonerates Byers, explores another suspect, stepfather Terry Hobbs, and chronicles the eventual release of the West Memphis Three from jail in August 2011. Citing other documentary films such as Errol Morris's crime film, The Thin Blue Line (1988), Berlinger and Sinofsky's intentions were for the films to \"have a more dramatic result\" and lead to the men being exonerated from prison."

  "text" : "Joseph Mulder (1658, Amsterdam – 1742, Amsterdam), was a Dutch Golden Age printmaker, known as a \"renowned engraver\". An engraving by Mulder illustrates the title page of the 1700 edition, published in Leiden, of Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems by Galileo. This engraving shows Aristotle, Ptolemy and Copernicus. Mulder worked abroad as well, and produced an engraving of Vienna from a bird's-eye view, in nine prints each measuring one by two feet. Along with Pieter Sluyter, he did many of the etchings for the classic book Insects of Surinam (Metamorphosis Insectorum Surinamensium) based on field drawings done by Maria Sibylla Merian. This book, published in 1726, has been described as \"magnificent\" and included early scientific study of the metamorphosis of caterpillars into butterflies. The book Figures de la Bible a La Haye, published in 1728 in The Hague, has an etching by Mulder portraying Adam and Eve as \"happy, childlike lovers\" with Genesis 2:25 inscribed in six languages: German, Dutch, Hebrew, Latin, English and French. The English translation is \"Adam and Eve were both naked and were not ashamed.\" Mulder's etchings are actively collected today. According to his contemporary, art historian Arnold Houbraken, he was a good etcher who had been the pupil of the Amsterdam painter Hendrick Bogaert in 1672. Houbraken reported that Mulder claimed to have played a similar prank on a baby as Adriaen Brouwer had done. In this anecdote, he had been rocking a baby on his lap. The baby soiled him because its diaper slipped off. He laid the baby on the floor and defecated on it. At that moment, the baby's mother walked in and asked what he was doing. He replied, \"het kind heeft my bescheeten, en ik beschyt het weer, dus beschyten wy malkander\" (the child shat on me, and now I shat on it, and so we're shitting on each other). According to the Netherlands Institute for Art History, he was an engraver and printmaker who had been a pupil of Bogaert and also followed Romeyn de Hooghe. He made the engravings for the book Veues de Gunterstein for the rich widow Madame de Gunterstein et de Thienhoven (Magdalena Poulle) ca. 1690."

He was in the retreat from Corunna, and immediately after accompanied the expedition to Walcheren, where he was commended for his abilities and zeal during the disastrous prevalence of intermittent fever and other camp sickness. He then returned to service in the Peninsula, receiving the rank of physician to the forces. After the peace he was appointed to take charge of the large hospital erected at Colchester for the sick and wounded from the field of Waterloo. He then became successively superintendent of Chelsea Hospital and medical director at Chatham. In 1822 he returned to foreign service in the West Indies, Nova Scotia, and Canada. In 1829 he was appointed principal medical officer in Ceylon, from which he returned in 1836 with his health broken by the climate. He was promoted to the rank of inspector-general of hospitals, and nominated to the chief direction of the army medical department in India, but was unable from ill-health to proceed to his post. He died at Maddox Street in London on 7 November 1837, in his fifty-ninth year, and was buried in Rochester Cathedral. No writings of his appear in library catalogues."

He represented St. John County in the Legislative Assembly of New Brunswick from 1809 to 1820. He was born in Peekskill, New York. Ward was probably the son of Edmund Ward and Elizabeth Strange. He served with the Loyal American Regiment during the American Revolution, reaching the rank of lieutenant. Ward married Elizabeth Strange in 1777. He led a unit of provincial troops to Parrtown (later Saint John, New Brunswick) in 1783. The following year, Ward settled in an area that would come to be known as Wards Creek but later returned to Parrtown, where he established a wholesale liquor business. The business expanded to incorporate the sale of general merchandise, lumber mills and an iron foundry. With others, Ward operated a steamboat service travelling between Saint John and Fredericton. From 1799 to 1809, he served on the town council for Saint John. Ward also served as a justice of the peace, as a magistrate for the city and county of St. John and as a commissioner for lighthouses on the Bay of Fundy. In 1793, he helped found the Saint John’s Loyal Company of Artillery. He later served as commander for all the county militia. Ward died in Saint John at the age of 92. His son, John Ward, Jr., also served in the New Brunswick assembly."

  "text" : "Reverend John Ford (February 27, 1767 – February 14, 1826) was a pioneering Methodist minister and political leader in South Carolina and in the Mississippi Territory. He was born in Marion District, South Carolina on February 27, 1767, the son of James and Ann Townsend Ford. Little is known of his early life except that he obtained his ministerial license while living in South Carolina. John Ford married Catharine Ard, daughter of Thomas Ard, in Robeson County, North Carolina, in March 1790 and the couple resided in South Carolina for the next eight years. Around 1798 the Ford family moved to the frontier of the Mississippi Territory and lived in the Natchez District until around 1805. Around 1809, the family built the famed John Ford home, a three-story wood-frame structure on the Pearl River. The house was built at Fordsville (now known as the Sandy Hook, Mississippi Community), in Marion County, Mississippi, several miles south of the county seat of Columbia, Mississippi, where the Ford family took up the plow and started farming. John Ford served two terms in the legislature of South Carolina and after moving to the Mississippi Territory was one of two delegates from Marion County, Mississippi to the first Mississippi Constitutional Convention. The other delegate was Dougald McLaughlin. The John Ford home was the site of the first Mississippi Methodist Conference in 1814 and the Pearl River Convention of 1816, which recommended partitioning the Mississippi Territory into the present-day states of Alabama and Mississippi. By the 1840s the Ford Home was sold to William Rankin and family, and successive generations of that family occupied this historic home for over one hundred years. Today the John Ford home is owned by the Marion County Historical Society and is a tourist attraction."

Barker was a draper of Coventry and was mayor of Coventry in 1634  and an alderman from 1635. In November 1640, Barker was elected Member of Parliament for Coventry in the Long Parliament. Barker was a staunch parliamentarian and he and fellow MP Simon Norton gave a bond for a loan of £1,000 in November 1640. He offered £50 for the defence of the city in 1642. He became a colonel, and was governor of Coventry during the civil war. In 1644 he became mayor again when George Monck, who had been elected, was not allowed to fill the position. In 1645 Parliament required MPs to give up any civil or military offices that they held and Barker had to give up his positions as mayor and governor despite an appeal from to town. Barker was excluded from parliament in 1648 under Pride's Purge. However, there was rioting in the city in his support and he was one of the members readmitted to the Rump Parliament in October 1649. At the end of the protectorate, the Rump Parliament was recalled in May 1659, but Barker was refused readmission. William Jesson, also fellow MP, married Elizabeth Barker who was daughter of John Barker, draper and alderman of Coventry, This John Barker may have been Barker himself or his father. John Barker, draper, had been mayor of Coventry in 1614."

Cook. From 1926 until 1931, Jones was on the National Executive Committee of the Labour Party, and from 1930 to 1938 he was the government's Coal Mine Reorganisation Commissioner. Jones was elected as Vice President of the MFGB in 1932, then in 1934 became the union's President. He resigned in 1938 to join the Coal Commission, and in 1947 was appointed as advisor on social insurance to the National Coal Board."

He was then hired to work in Renaissance Éducationnel, the children's education film section of Renaissance Films Distribution. It was here that he got to work on his first feature film Le gros Bill (1949) co-directing with René Delacroix. Bigras moved on to direct three feature films himself, including La petite Aurore l’enfant martyre (1951), a big hit with audiences and a staple of Quebec Cinema.

He was born at Bath Village, St. John on the island of Barbados and attended the parishes Elementary Mixed School (1953-1958), graduated from the Modern High School and went to Codrington College. Leaving school, he married Betty Lucas-Holder, with whom he had son Stuart, and began work as a teacher and a civil servant before entering Codrington College in 1971 to be trained for the priesthood for the Diocese of the Windward Islands. He graduated from the College in 1975, having obtained a Bachelor of Arts (BA) in Theology from the University of the West Indies and a Diploma in Theological Studies of Codrington College. Ordained deacon in December 1974 it was just nine months later, in September 1975, he was ordained to the priesthood in St. George’s Cathedral on the island of St Vincent where he spent two years as a curate. He returned to his home island of Barbados in 1977 as tutor in Biblical Studies at Codrington College. This allowed him to continue part-time at his academic studies at the School of Theology, the University of the South, from which he graduated in 1981 with a Masters in Sacred Theology (STM) and a major in Old Testament Studies (hermeneutics and the writings of Second Temple Judaism). At this period he travelled to England where he was made Honorary Chaplain at the University Church of Christ the King, Gordon Square, London (1981-1984) and to further study at King's College London, gaining a Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) in Old Testament Studies four years later in 1985. Returning to Barbados in 1984, he rejoined the staff of Codrington College now as Lecturer in Old Testament Studies. Along with his work at Codrington, he performed duties in parishes in the Diocese of Barbados as an Assistant Priest, first at Cathedral Church of St. Michael and then at St Augustine’s Church in 1986, before being appointed Priest-in-Charge of this parish from 1989-1990. In the decade between 1990 and 2000 he continued serving as Priest-in-Charge in a number of churches - St John’s Parish Church (1990-1992), St Mark and St Catherine (1992-1993), St Mark (1993-1994), Holy Trinity (1994-1995) and finally Holy Cross (1995-2000). It was during this last tenure that in 1996 he was made an Honorary Canon of the Diocese of Barbados and three years late, in 1999, he received an award for his work at Codrington College. Then in March 2000 he became the thirteenth Bishop of Barbados, succeeding Rufus Brome, who had then retired. Later in 2005, whilst a member of the Advisory group to Anglican Observer at the United Nations (2003-2006), for his contribution to Theology in Barbados, he earned the Errol Barrow Award. On 10 December 2009, election of the next Archbishop took place at Guyana's then new Convention Hall in Georgetown during a meeting of the Provincial Synod of the Church and Holder became the new Archbishop of the Province of the West Indies (a member province in the worldwide Anglican Communion)."

  "text" : "John Wesley Hanson (1823–1901) was an American Universalist minister and a notable Universalist historian advancing the claim that Universalism was the belief of early Christianity. He was born at Boston. He is also notable for his eyewitness accounts of his time as chaplain to one of the Unattached Companies Massachusetts Volunteer Militia during the American Civil War and for publishing his own New Testament \"Hanson's edited New Testament\" (1885), which was a revision of the English Revised Version with \"baptism\" changed for \"immersion\" and other changes. His sister was Harriet Hanson Robinson (1825–1911) wife of William Stevens Robinson (1818–1876), social reformers in Malden, Massachusetts. In 1845 he arrived in Wentworth, New Hampshire as Universalist minister. In the 1860s he was chaplain to the Sixth regiment of Massachusetts volunteers. In the 1870s he went as a Universalist missionary to Britain, becoming the pastor of St. Paul's Universalist Church, Glasgow, Scotland. He then became minister of the Universalist New Covenant Church of Chicago, where he worked on his New Testament. He is best known for his history arguing that universalism dominated early church thought before Augustine; Universalism: The Prevailing Doctrine of the Christian Church (1899) which followed Universalist Hosea Ballou's Ancient History of Universalism. (1828) His view of early church history was carried on by George T. Knight. Hanson is cited as a primary source in the 1911 edition of the  Encyclopædia Britannica, and New Schaff-Herzog Encyclopedia of Religious Knowledge (1908–14) articles on Universalism. Hanson and Knight's reading of church history has been challenged, but recent studies confirm many of Hanson's claims."

He had a weakly constitution from birth. Having passed through Leeds Grammar School with credit, he was entered at St. John's College, Cambridge, 26 March 1770, under John Chevallier, and went into residence in October following. In January 1774 he graduated B.A. as fifth senior optime, winning the first members' prize when a senior bachelor in 1776. In 1777 he took his M.A. degree, and during the same year was elected fellow of his college on the foundation of Sir Marmaduke Constable. He was appointed Lady Margaret's preacher in 1782, and published his sermons in 1794. Before the last-named year the parishioners had elected him to the vicarage of St. Sepulchre's or the Round Church, Cambridge. In 1785 he proceeded B.D., and in 1795 he was chosen Norrisian professor of divinity. Although esteemed models of composition and orthodoxy, his sermons failed to draw together large congregations. ‘A certain thickness in his speech, an awkwardness of manner in a crowd, a want of energy, and an easiness of temper, little calculated to curb the sallies of a large assembly of young men constrained to sit out a lecture of an hour in length,’ contributed also to render his lectures less efficient than might have been expected from their undoubted excellence. Fawcett chiefly resided in college until he was presented by the society in 1801 to the united rectories of Thursford and Great Snoring in Norfolk. He afterwards divided his time between his parsonage and the university, being permitted to retain rooms in college on account of his lectures. In 1815 he vacated the Norrisian professorship; in 1822 he also resigned his vicarage in Cambridge, and resided thenceforward solely at his rectory in Norfolk. There he died 10 April 1831."

  "text" : "Josy (Joseph) Braun (14 January 1938 – 4 August 2012) was a Luxembourg writer, journalist and translator who wrote mainly in Luxembourgish. Braun wrote plays both for adults and children, Poetry, prose, and children's stories. His plays, which often convey political concerns, include D'Kromm an der Heck (1966), Requiem fir e Lompekréimer (1966), Wie bas de Leo? (1976), Hexejuecht (1978). His works have been translated into German, French, English, Italian, Portuguese and Russian. He authored the very first detective story in Luxembourgish, Porto fir d'Affekoten (1997). His 2010 collection of poems, Billersproochbiller, illustrated by his wife Josée Klinker, was translated into French, German and English with the goal of extending readership beyond the local Luxembourgers. Kréiwénkel is a novel about the dreams, longing and frustrations of its characters, showing how they evolve inwardly and outwardly in a changing world. Braun describes the village life in which they undergo slow changes in their inner conditions and spiritual experiences."

  "text" : "James Abree (1691?–1768) was an 18th-century Canterbury printer, publisher, and bookseller. Abree was the son of William Abree of Winchester. He was apprenticed to the London printer Ichabod Dawkes from 1705 to 1712.Abree moved to Canterbury in 1717, possibly at the invitation of the city authorities. He seems to have been the printer of Canterbury's first newspaper, the Kentish Post, founded in 1717.In 1722 he became a freeman of Canterbury and in the same year married Mary, the daughter of Samuel and Frances Simmons of Deal, (died 1748).They had one child, a daughter also named Mary, who married Lieutenant Thomas Woolley Pickering R.N. in 1745. Besides his newspaper, Abree also printed books and ephemera such as bellman's verses and ballads; he also acted as an agent for the Sun Fire Office and no doubt sold stationery through his bookshop. At the end of his career, Abree took on an assistant, George Kirkby, son of a Canterbury vicar, who had been apprenticed to the London printer James Bettenham. In 1768, the Kentish Post announced that Abree was planning to retire in favour of his assistant Kirkby.A rival paper was started by James Simmons and after a short circulation war, the two newspapers merged as the Kentish Gazette which is still published weekly in Canterbury (2011). The firm of Simmons and Kirkby remained in operation for 23 years after Abree's retirement."

  "text" : "James Richard \"Jim\" Hendricks (born February 10, 1940) is an American guitarist and Folk musician. Born in Atkinson, Nebraska, Hendricks began playing guitar and lap steel guitar in his youth, and began performing publicly while working as a teacher in Omaha, Nebraska in the early 1960s. One of his shows was attended by Cass Elliot, who invited Hendricks to join her and Tim Rose in the New York folk group The Big 3. The group was successful playing The Bitter End, touring with comedian Bill Cosby and appearing on The Tonight Show. Hendricks was married to Elliot in 1963 (the couple divorced in 1969). In 1964, Elliot and Hendricks started the folk group The Mugwumps, which included Denny Doherty, John Sebastian and Zal Yanovsky. The group lasted eight months before Sebastian and Yanovsky formed The Lovin' Spoonful and Doherty and Elliot would become one-half of The Mamas & the Papas. Hendricks moved to Los Angeles and formed The Lamp of Childhood, which released three singles on Dunhill Records in 1966–67 without success. He improved his songwriting while with the band, and after leaving it wrote \"Summer Rain\", a hit for Johnny Rivers, and \"Long Lonesome Highway\", theme song of the television series Then Came Bronson. Hendricks eventually moved to Nashville, Tennessee in the 1970s and began touring with family and writing contemporary Christian music. Hendricks plays guitar, mandolin, dobro and autoharp and has recorded over 50 albums spanning a variety of styles, mainly Americana, country and contemporary Christian, including several instrumental albums for Benson Records and later Maple Street Music, a label he co-founded in 1996."

  "text" : "John Leonard Watson is a chess International Master and author. Watson was born in Milwaukee and grew up in Omaha, Nebraska. He was educated at Brownell-Talbot, Harvard, and the University of California at San Diego, where he took his degree in engineering. He has won many chess tournaments including the first US National High School Chess Championship and the American Open. Watson is best known as a chess theorist and author, and has written more than thirty books on many aspects of chess. His 1999 book Secrets of Modern Chess Strategy won the British Chess Federation's Book of the year award as well as the United States Chess Federation Book of the Year. The successor volume Chess Strategy in Action was the Chesscafe Book of the Year. These two books explore and theorize how radically chess has changed since the early 20th century, and how old and supposedly 'time-tested' rules for the conduct of play have been replaced by broader and revolutionary practice over-the-board. These books have been translated into several languages. In a lighter vein, Watson wrote the Chessman comic book series, illustrated by Chris Hendrickson and Svein Myreng. Chessman Comics are now out-of-print collectors' items. Watson has a regular book review column at The Week in Chess, the publication of the London Chess Centre (available online). He has a weekly Internet radio show 'Chess Talk with John Watson' on Chess.FM, the radio arm of the Internet Chess Club (ICC). Watson is also much in demand as a chess coach; his students have included Tal Shaked, the 1997 World Junior Champion, Senior Master Patrick Hummel, Abby Marshall, and also other US scholastic champions. Watson is married to Maura Giles-Watson; they live in San Diego, California."

  "text" : "Jin Xing (Chinese: 金星; pinyin: Jīn Xīng, Korean: 김성, McCune–Reischauer romanization: Kim Seong); born August 13, 1967 in Shenyang, Liaoning) is a Chinese ballerina, modern dancer, choreographer, actress, and owner of the contemporary dance company \"Shanghai Jin Xing Dance Theatre\". Jin Xing was the first transgender woman in China that got the government's approval to undergo a sex change, and she is also one of the first few transgender women to be officially recognized as a woman by the Chinese government. Born to ethnic Korean parents, she studied in a local Korean elementary school. Her father worked in the police department. She was praised as highly intelligent, and had won abacus contests many times. She expressed high enthusiasm in dance performance. At the age of 9 she joined the People's Liberation Army to receive dance and military training; she became a member of the military's dance troupe, and eventually attained the rank of colonel. She experienced strong transsexual desires early in life. She said she would stay outside during rain, and wish that a lightning strike would turn her body female. Later she won the national dance contest with a piece of Central Asian ethnic dance. 1987, Jin went to New York to study modern dance for four years, and then traveled and performed in Europe, and taught dance in Rome from 1991 to 1993, followed by a world tour, and returned to China at the age of 26. She underwent sex reassignment surgery in 1996. Her left leg was paralyzed for a while after the surgery. After the recovery she went to Shanghai to choreograph and train students. At the age of 33 she adopted a son. She now lives with her three adopted children and her German husband in Shanghai."

Reagan and George Herbert Walker Bush, both Republicans. Volz was chosen as U.S. attorney in 1977 after the initial choice, George W. Reese, Jr., of New Orleans, a former Republican national committeeman, withdrew from consideration after the Federal Bureau of Investigation came forward with \"allegations\" of his drinking, gambling, and procurement of a loan from a financial institution with mob ties. Volz in time prosecuted reputed Mafia figure Carlos Marcello, Louisiana commissioner of administration Charles E. Roemer, II, Orleans Parish District Attorney Harry Connick Sr., Louisiana State Senate President Michael H. O'Keefe, Sr., and Governor Edwin Washington Edwards. In 1995, Volz, running as a Republican, finished third in a crowded nonpartisan blanket primary for sheriff of suburban St. Tammany Parish outside New Orleans. In 1996, failed in a bid to oust Walter Reed as district attorney in the 22nd Judicial District, which covers St. Tammany and Washington parishes. Volz died in Tulsa, Oklahoma, where he had been an administrative law judge for several years until forced to retire on December 31, 2010, because of failing health. His widow, Daisy Volz, said that he would be interred in New Orleans."

  "text" : "Lieutenant John Steel (Jock) Lewes (21 December 1913 – 31 December 1941) was a British Army officer prominent during World War II. He invented an explosive device, the eponymous Lewes bomb, and was the founding principal training officer of the Special Air Service. Its founding commander, David Stirling said later of Lewes: \"Jock could far more genuinely claim to be founder of the SAS than I.\" Lewes was born in Calcutta to a mother from Sydney, Australia and a British father. He grew up in Sydney and attended The King's School, Parramatta. He attended at Christ Church, Oxford. Lewes was president of the Oxford University Boat Club 1936–37, but gave up his place in the 1937 Blue boat which ended up winning the 1937 University Boat Race, ending a 15-year Cambridge winning streak. While an undergraduate, Lewes traveled to Germany and became an admirer of Hitler and the Nazi State, before casting off his illusions after the events of Kristallnacht. Lewes was first commissioned as a Second Lieutenant, University Candidate, General List in 1935, while a student at Oxford. After graduation he transferred to a Territorial Army unit, 1st Battalion, the Tower Hamlets Rifles, Rifle Brigade before joining the Welsh Guards. In 1941, Lewes was in a group of volunteers assembled by Lieutenant David Stirling to form a unit dedicated to raiding missions against the lines of communication of Axis forces in North Africa. For counter-espionage purposes, this platoon-sized was initially named \"'L' Detachment, Special Air Service Brigade\". To destroy Axis vehicles, members of the SAS surreptitiously attached small explosive charges. Lewes noticed the respective weaknesses of conventional (blast) and incendiaries, as well as their failure to destroy vehicles in some cases. He improvised a new, combined charge out of plastic explosive and cans of petrol. The Lewes bomb was used throughout World War II. Jock Lewes was killed in action in December 1941. He was returning from a raid on German airfields when the Long Range Desert Group truck he was traveling in was attacked by a lone Messerschmitt 110 fighter. Lewes was fatally wounded in the thigh by a 20mm round from the fighter and bled to death in about four minutes. He was buried on the site where the attack happened but the whereabouts of his grave are now unknown. He is commemorated on the Alamein Memorial. Lewes was engaged to marry Mirren Barford, an Oxford undergraduate, at the time of his death."

Lord Durham married Ethel Elizabeth Louisa, daughter of Henry Beilby William Milner, in 1882. The marriage was childless, and Lady Durham was committed to a mental institution for most of her adult life. Lord Durham produced a child, John R. H. Rudge (b. 1892), out of wedlock with the dancer Letty Lind, whom he could not marry because his wife's illness prevented a divorce. He and Lind were together for many years until her death in 1923. He died in September 1928, aged 73, and was succeeded in the earldom by his younger twin brother, Frederick. Lady Durham died in 1931."

  "text" : "Juan S.P. Hidalgo, Jr. (born July 12, 1936 in Intramuros, Manila, Philippines), is an Ilokano fictionist (short story, novel), poet, editor, translator, and painter. He was former managing editor of Bannawag, a weekly Ilokano magazine. During his 37-year stint (1961–1998) as senior literary editor at Bannawag, he guided, encouraged and trained young and old Ilokano writers to produce quality Iloko literary works. He was among the recipients of the first ever Philippine-International Theater Institute-National Commission for Culture and the Arts Award for Culture-Friendly Media Institutions. Hidalgo was responsible for the founding of GUMIL Filipinas (Gunglo dagiti Mannurat nga Ilokano iti Filipinas). The top national organization of Iloko writers, GUMIL now boasts of chapters in Guam, Greece, California, and Hawaii. Considered by his peers as a \"prodigy in Ilokano literature,\" Hidalgo published in 1969 the now classic Iloko anthology, \"Bituen ti Rosales ken Dadduma Pay a Sarita\" (\"Star of Rosales and Other Stories\"), a collection of 20 selected short stories. This book became, as Iloko literary critics and scholars acknowledge, the \"official textbook of contemporary Iloko writers\" because of its influence on the serious Iloko writer. As editor and translator, he published other anthologies of selected Iloko short stories; he translated a number of novels and short stories written in German or Japanese into Iloko. Even as he toiled as literary editor at Bannawag and saw to it that the quality of the literary output improved, he was able to publish in the magazine some 7 novels, 3 novellas, 4 biographies about the Virgin Mary, and numerous poems, short stories and essays. He started painting in 1979 and he was a founding member of the U.P. Campus Sunday Group, an association of painters at the University of the Philippines. His paintings were included in various art exhibits in Metro Manila and in the provinces. Born in Intramuros, Manila, Hidalgo spent his childhood in Rosales, Pangasinan. His parents were the late Juan Peralta Hidalgo of Dingras, Ilocos Norte and Felisa Alberto Sanchez of Tomana, Rosales, Pangasinan. He married Namnama Garma Prado of Piddig, Ilocos Norte, a former head librarian at the UP-Diliman. They have three daughters: Maria Bituen (b. 1970), Patricia Amor (b. 1971), and Marie Sol (b. 1973)."

He served in the Royal Marines during World War I, then returned to coal mining, where he became active in the Northumberland Miners' Association. He became General Secretary of the union in 1935, and Vice President of the Miners' Federation of Great Britain in 1939, holding the post unopposed until 1949, during which period he took a leading role in reorganising the union into the National Union of Mineworkers. Bowman advised in reforming the German trade unions after World War II. He also served on the 1947 Royal Commission on the Press, and Beveridge's committee on broadcasting. He withdrew from trade unionism at the end of 1949, instead taking a National Coal Board post; in 1956, he was appointed its chairman. He stood down in 1961, due to ill health. In the New Year Honours 1961 Bowman was created as a baronet."

  "text" : "James Thomas Aubrey Jr. (December 14, 1918 – September 3, 1994) was a leading American television and film executive. President of the CBS television network from 1959 to 1965, he put some of television's most enduring series on the air, including Gilligan's Island and The Beverly Hillbillies. Under Aubrey, CBS dominated American television the way General Motors and General Electric dominated their industries. The New York Times Magazine in 1964 called Aubrey \"a master of programming whose divinations led to successes that are breathtaking\". Aubrey replaced CBS Television president Louis Cowan, who was slowly dismissed after the quiz show scandals. Despite his successes in television, Aubrey's abrasive personality and oversized ego – \"Picture Machiavelli and Karl Rove at a University of Colorado football recruiting party\" wrote Variety in 2004 – led to his firing from CBS amid charges of improprieties. \"The circumstances rivaled the best of CBS adventure or mystery shows,\" declared The New York Times in its front-page story on his firing, which came on \"the sunniest Sunday in February\" 1965. He earned the nickname \"Smiling Cobra\" for his brutal decision-making ways. Aubrey governed CBS with a firm grip, and it did not go unnoticed. He was suddenly dismissed in February 1965. Aubrey offered no explanation following his dismissal, nor did CBS President Frank Stanton or Board Chairman William Paley. After four years as an independent producer, Aubrey was hired by financier Kirk Kerkorian in 1969 to preside over Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer's near-total shutdown, during which he slashed the budget and alienated producers and directors but brought profits to a company that had suffered huge losses. In 1973, Aubrey resigned from MGM, declaring his job was done, and then vanished into almost total obscurity for the last two decades of his life. Hollywood executive Sherry Lansing, a close friend of Aubrey's for two decades, told the Los Angeles Times in 1986: Jim is different. He does his own dirty work. Jim is one of those people who are willing to say, \"I didn't like your movie.\" Directness is disarming to people who are used to sugar-coating. It's tough for people who need approval to see somebody who doesn't. Myths and legends begin to surround that kind of person."

Born Jewish and a convert to Calvinism, he spent considerable effort to opposing the prevalent Antisemitic polices of the Tsarist government, and was sympathetic to the fledgling Zionist Movement. Bloch had studied at the University of Berlin, worked at a Warsaw bank and then moved to St. Petersburg, capital of the Russian Empire (which governed much of the Polish lands at the time). There, he took part in the development of the Russian Railways, both in financing the construction of new railways and in writing research papers on the subject. He founded several banking, credit and insurance companies. In 1877 he was appointed a member of the Russian Finance Ministry's Scientific Committee."

His theories draw from sources such as The Protocols of the Elders of Zion. His books Geheimgesellschaften (Secret Societies) and Geheimgesellschaften 2 have been banned in Germany, France and Switzerland for inciting anti-semitic hatred. The majority of his books, such as Die Kinder des neuen Jahrtausends. Mediale Kinder verändern die Welt (Children of the New Millennium, and how They Change the World) are non-political and deal exclusively with esoteric subjects. He is also the founder of the online magazine secret.TV, which offers alternative perspectives of our reality, other than the \"truths\" spread by the mainstream media. He is known to promote often unpopular opinions, which are reasonable enough but are mostly ignored by the main mass media, in order to encourage people to stay more informed and not only get information from one source or perspective."

  "text" : "Jeni LeGon (August 14, 1916 – December 7, 2012) was an American dancer, dance instructor, and actress. She was one of the first African-American women to establish a solo career in tap. She was born Jennie Bell in Chicago, Illinois. Her parents were Hector Ligon, a chef who also worked as a railway porter, and Harriet Bell Ligon, a housewife. She graduated from Sexton Elementary School in 1928, and at the age of thirteen got her first job in musical theater. She eventually auditioned for the chorus line of band leader Count Basie and was selected. LeGon and her half-sister, Willa Mae Lane, formed a song-and-dance team. They were given the opportunity to go to Detroit and work with nightclub owner Leonard Reed. While there, they received an offer to travel to Hollywood and perform with composer Shelton Brooks. Upon arrival, they discovered there was, in fact, no job. LeGon heard about auditions being held by Ethel Waters' former manager, Earl Dancer. The audition was for a film that Fox Studios was producing. She won the part and subsequently appeared in dance numbers in several musicals. While in Hollywood, LeGon had the opportunity to work with performers such as Ethel Waters and Al Jolson. She danced with Fred Astaire and Bill \"Bojangles\" Robinson, becoming the first African-American woman to do so on screen. During this time, she was given a role in Hooray for Love, which led MGM to offer her a long-term contract, making LeGon the first African-American woman to receive such an opportunity. In 1969, LeGon settled in Vancouver, British Columbia, where she taught tap and pointe. In 1999, the National Film Board of Canada released a documentary film about her life, Jeni Le Gon: Living in a Great Big Way, directed by Grant Greshuk and produced by Selwyn Jacob."

  "text" : "Julije Knifer (23 April 1924 – 7 December 2004) was a Croatian abstract painter and a founding member of the 1960s Croatian art collective known as the Gorgona Group. The central motif of Knifer’s art is the exploration of meander, a geometric form which he had been creating since 1960 in various painting techniques such as print, oil, acrylic paint, collage and mural. An example of which is the colossal meander created by Knifer on a 20 x 30 m canvas in a quarry in Tübingen (1975). He was also one of the founding members of the Gorgona Group, whose members from 1959 to 1966 were: Miljenko Horvat, Ivan Kožarić, Marijan Jevšovar, Dimitrije Bašičević (who works under the name Mangelos), Matko Meštrović, Radoslav Putar, Đuro Seder and Josip Vaništa. In 1961 he participated at the first New Tendencies’ exhibition in Zagreb. He exhibited at many national and international shows including, The New Tendencies exhibitions (1961, 1963, 1969 and 1973), Art Abstrait Constructif International at the Denise René Gallery (Paris, 1961–1962), Konstruktivisten at the Städtisches Museum Leverkusen (Leverkusen, 1962), Oltre l’informale (San Marino, 1963), the Venice Biennale (1976 and 2001), the São Paulo Art Biennale (1973 with Juraj Dobrović and Vjenceslav Richter, 1979 and 1981). He collaborated with the Dany Keller Gallery in Munich, the Hoffmann Gallery in Friedberg and the Frank Elbaz Gallery in Paris. This increased the number of his works in private and museum collections which are now held in many prominent institutions across the world including the Centre Georges Pompidou in Paris. In 1994 he moved to Paris where he lived until his death. His first posthumous exhibition was organized by Arnauld Pierre at the Frank Elbaz Gallery in Paris (2010). In 2002 he was the recipient of the Vladimir Nazor Life Achievement Award. In 2016, Knifer's painting PLS 69 (1969) was sold in an auction in Vienna for €137,000, which was at the time the highest price ever paid for a work of Croatian modern art."

  "text" : "Jason O'Donnell (born October 13, 1971) is an American Democratic Party politician who serves in the New Jersey General Assembly, where he has represented the 31st Legislative District since September 13, 2010. O'Donnell is the Director of Public Safety for the City of Bayonne where he also serves as the municipal Democratic Committee Chairman. O'Donnell is on leave from his full-time position as a captain in the Bayonne Fire Department. O'Donnell was chosen by the Hudson County Democratic Committee to succeed Anthony Chiappone, who resigned after pleading guilty to the misuse of campaign funds. O'Donnell won a 2010 special election to complete the remainder of Chiappone's term and was subsequently re-elected to two-year terms in 2011 and 2013. In March 2015, O'Donnell announced he would not seek re-election to a third full term in 2015. In the Assembly, O'Donnell served on the Financial Institutions and Insurance, the Housing and Community Development, and the Labor Assembly committees. In New Jersey, the Democratic nominee for the gubernatorial election typically gets to select the next chair of the State Democratic Committee. In 2013, Democratic nominee Barbara Buono indicated support for O'Donnell to become the next chair, however through backroom discussions, Passaic County Democratic chair John Currie was selected. O'Donnell is married to wife Kerry and has two sons; they live in Bayonne. He is a graduate of New Jersey City University majoring in fire safety."

His work has been published in The American Organist, The Theatre Organ Journal, and Inside Northside magazines, the OHS Organ Database and the New Orleans Times Picayune website nola.com.

He was born in Tifton, Georgia, and in his youth played guitar on street corners with his brother Coot. They recorded for Columbia Records in Atlanta in 1927, but the recordings were not released. Soon afterwards, Johnny Barfield became acquainted with Clayton McMichen and Bert Layne of the Skillet Lickers, touring with the group and recording with some of its offshoots, including McMichen's group, the Georgia Wildcats. By 1932 he was performing both solo, and as a member of Layne's band. In 1939, he won a recording contract with Bluebird Records, and released his version of \"Boogie Woogie\", a song derived from \"Pinetop's Boogie Woogie\" recorded in 1928 by Pinetop Smith. Barfield's song is considered the first country boogie, and became popular on jukeboxes. Barfield recorded again in 1940 and 1941, but failed to repeat his earlier success. He continued to perform for several years. He died in 1974, aged 64."

He was selected as the Labour candidate for the Merthyr Tydfil by-election, 1915, the seat having previously been held by Keir Hardie, but he was defeated by Charles Butt Stanton of the British Workers League, who had resigned as a miners' agent to run with Conservative and Liberal support as a pro-war independent labour candidate. In 1915, he replaced Brace as union president, serving until his death. He also stood in Merthyr at the 1918 general election, but was again unsuccessful.

  "text" : "Jacob Thompson (1806–1879) was an English landscape-painter. Jacob, eldest son of Merrick Thompson, a manufacturer of linen check and a well-known member of the Society of Friends, was born in Lanton Street, Penrith, Cumberland, on 28 August 1806. His father was then in prosperous circumstances, but the depression of trade caused by the War of 1812 brought about his failure. Young Thompson's aspirations to become an artist met with little sympathy from his family, and he was apprenticed to a house-painter; but he struggled with energy and perseverance against these adverse influences, and devoted all his leisure time to his favourite pursuit. He at length attracted the notice of Lord Lonsdale, and with his help he came in 1829 to London with an introduction to Sir Thomas Lawrence (1769–1830), and became a student at the British Museum and the Royal Academy. He began to exhibit in 1824, when he had in the first exhibition of the Society of British Artists a \"View in Cumberland,\" but he did not send a picture to the Royal Academy until 1832, in which year appeared \"The Druids cutting down the Mistletoe.\" This was followed in 1833 by a picture containing full-length portraits of the daughters of the Hon. Colonel Lowther. His next exhibit was \"Harvest Home in the Fourteenth Century,\" which appeared at the British Institution in 1837, and was presented by the artist to his patron, the Earl of Lonsdale. After this date he painted portraits, views of mansions, &c., but he did not exhibit again until 1847, when he sent to Westminster Hall \"The Highland Ferry-Boat,\" which was engraved in line by James Tibbits Willmore. \"The Proposal\" appeared at the Royal Academy in 1848; \"The Highland Bride,\" likewise engraved by Willmore, in 1851; \"Going to Church: Scene in the Highlands,\" in 1852; \"The Hope Beyond,\" in 1853; \"The Course of true Love never did run smooth,\" in 1854; \"The Mountain Ramblers,\" in 1855; \"Sunny Hours of Childhood\" and \"Looking out for the Homeward Bound,\" in 1856; and \"The Pet Lamb,\" in 1857. He painted in 1858 \"Crossing a Highland Loch,\" which was engraved by Charles Mottram; but he did not again exhibit until 1860, when he sent to the Royal Academy \"The Signal,\" which was engraved by Charles Cousen for the Art Journal of 1862. In 1864 he had at the academy \"The Height of Ambition,\" engraved by Charles Cousen for the Art Journal, as was likewise by J. C. Armytage \"Drawing the Net at Hawes Water,\" painted in 1867 for Lord Esher, but never exhibited. \"Rush Bearing\" and a view of Rydal Mount are among his best works. In his later years Thompson devoted himself chiefly to landscape subjects with figures, the themes of which were for the most part drawn from the mountains and lakes of Cumberland and Westmoreland, but occasionally from Scotland. His range, however, was limited, and his work was lacking in poetic sympathy. His attempts at classical and scriptural subjects, such as \"Acis and Galatea,\" exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1849, and \"Proserpine,\" were not a success. His last work was \"Eldmuir, or Solitude.\"Thompson died at the Hermitage, Hackthorpe, Cumberland, where he had lived in retirement for upwards of forty years, on 27 December 1879, and was buried in Lowther churchyard. His first wife was a sister of George Parker Bidder, the celebrated calculator and civil engineer. A portrait of Thompson, drawn on wood by himself, and engraved by W. Ballingall, is prefixed to his Life by Llewellyn Jewitt. Attribution \n*  Graves, Robert Edmund (1898). \"Thompson, Jacob\". In Lee, Sidney. Dictionary of National Biography. 56.

  "text" : "Joan Rodker (1 May 1915 – 27 December 2010) was a British political activist and television producer. The daughter of the modernist poet John Rodker and dancer Sonia Cohen, who placed her into care at age 18 months, where she remained until 11 years old. Later, Rodker lived with her mother and attended Haberdashers' Aske's School for Girls in Elstree, Hertfordshire, but did not shine academically. After failing the matriculation exam needed for university admission, she left school at 17. Improving her German in Prague at the insistence of her father, Rodker became attracted to Marxism, and migrated to Moscow in 1934, joining an acting troupe which toured Ukraine. After falling in love with the actor Gerhard Hinze (later known as Gerard Heinz), the couple had a son Ernest in 1937 while in Odessa. During her time in the Soviet Union, Rodker met Regina Fischer, with whom she later corresponded, and who subsequently became the mother of chess grandmaster Bobby Fischer. The relationship with Heinz did not survive the war. Rodker helped to publicise the Sheffield Peace Conference in 1950, and was involved in several other such gatherings. Between 1950 and 1955, Rodker was involved with the Polish Cultural Institute and (with the artist Peter de Francia and John Berger) began the Soho fair. Rodker's Kensington home was described by the Telegraph obituary writer as the nearest Britain ever possessed to a \"communist salon\". She provided help and accommodation for people of a similar persuasion, including the American expatriate Clancy Sigal and the novelist Doris Lessing. Lessing used Rodker as a model for her character Molly Jacobs in her novel The Golden Notebook (1962). During her career in television, Joan Rodker was a researcher on such series as Huw Wheldon's Monitor and ITV's Tempo and script editor on Armchair Theatre and the BBC's Thirty-Minute Theatre. In 1980, she worked as the Executive Producer of Thames' Armchair Thriller series, having previously worked as the script executive earlier in the programme's run. Papers formerly in the possession of Joan Rodker were acquired by the Harry Ransom Humanities Research Center at the University of Texas at Austin in 2000."

He was born in Nashville, Tennessee, the son of Samuella and John Wesley Work, who was director of a church choir, some of whose members were also in the original Fisk Jubilee Singers. John Wesley Work, Jr. attended Fisk University, where he organised singing groups and studied Latin and history, graduating in 1895. He then taught in Tullahoma, Tennessee, studied at Harvard University, and worked in the library at Fisk, before taking an appointment as a Latin and history instructor at Fisk in 1904. He married Agnes Haynes in 1899. Working with his wife and his brother, Frederick Jerome Work, he began collecting slave songs and spirituals, publishing them as New Jubilee Songs as Sung by the Fisk Jubilee Singers (1901) and New Jubilee Songs and Folk Songs of the American Negro (1907). The latter book included the first publication of \"Go Tell It on the Mountain\", which he may have had a hand in composing. His other songs included \"Song of the Warrior\", \"If Only You Were Here\", \"Negro Lullaby\", and \"Negro Love Song\". He also established the music publishing company, Work Brothers and Hart. As the director of the Fisk Jubilee Singers, he was responsible for taking them on tour each year. However, because of negative feelings toward black folk music at Fisk, he was forced to resign his post there in 1923. He then served as president of Roger Williams University in Nashville, until his death in 1925. John and Agnes Work had six children, of whom John Wesley Work III (1901-67) also worked as the director of the Fisk Jubilee Singers and as a song collector and composer."

The Senate vacancy occurred with the resignation of the Democrat Nick Gautreaux, who accepted an appointment from Republican Governor Bobby Jindal to head the Louisiana Office of Motor Vehicles in Baton Rouge. Perry's victory is particularly significant because it realigns the Senate, where Republicans will have their first majority since Reconstruction, with twenty of the thirty-nine members. Perry is also known as a comedian and has released DVDs of his stand-up Cajun routines. Perry is among the most sought after Cajun comedians in the world and is a past \"king\" of the \"International Cajun Joke Telling Contest.\""

  "text" : "John Yeardley (3 January 1786 – 11 August 1858) was a Quaker missionary. He was the son of Joel and Frances Yeardley, small dairy farmers at Orgreave, near Rotherham, Yorkshire. John was admitted a member of the Society of Friends in his twentieth year, entered a manufactory in Barnsley, and married, in 1809, Elizabeth Dunn, a convinced Friend much his senior. He commenced preaching in 1815, moving from place to place in the northern counties. In 1821 Yeardley's wife died, and, led by a persistent \"call,\" he decided to settle at Pyrmont in Germany, where a small body of Friends existed. For his subsistence he arranged to represent some merchants who imported linen yarn, and later on he commenced bleaching on his own account. His philanthropic labours included the establishing of schools and meetings for the young, and many notable persons, including the prince and princess of Prussia, came to hear him preach. In 1824 he accompanied Martha Savory, an English Quaker, on a gospel journey up the Rhine from Elberfeld to Würtemberg, Tübingen, and other German towns, through Switzerland to Congénies in Central France, where some Friends were and (as of 1897) still are settled. They visited Theodor Fliedner at Kaiserswerth, and all the principal religious and philanthropic institutions on their route. Upon reaching England they were married at Gracechurch Street meeting on 13 December 1826, resuming soon after their missionary labours in Pyrmont, Friesland, and Switzerland, and visiting asylums, reformatories, and Moravian schools. During a short time spent in England both Yeardley and his wife applied themselves to the study of modern Greek in preparation for a visit to the isles, for which they started on 21 June 1833. They were warmly received by Edmond de Pressensé in Paris, and by Professors Ehrmann and Frédéric Cuvier at Strasbourg. In Corfu they established a girls' school, also a model farm, obtaining from the authorities there a grant of land upon which prisoners were permitted to supply the labour. After eight years at home, spent in studying languages, the Yeardleys in 1842 returned for the fourth time to France and Germany. In 1850, during a stay in Berlin, they became acquainted with August Neander. Mrs. Yeardley died on 8 May 1851, but her husband continued his travels to Norway in 1852, and to South Russia and Constantinople in 1853. In his seventy-second year he commenced to study Turkish, and started for the East on 15 June 1858. After some work in Constantinople, and while waiting for his equipments and tents to proceed to the interior of Asia Minor, Yeardley was smitten with paralysis at Isnik, and was compelled to return to England, where he died on 11 August 1858. He was buried at Stoke Newington on the 18th. As a preacher Yeardley's racy humour, with occasional lapses into his broad native Barnsley dialect, added to his uncompromising directness, did him good service. As a linguist his achievements in preaching without interpreters were remarkable, considering that his early education included no Latin. He used tracts largely as a vehicle for spreading the gospel. These, written and sometimes translated by himself, were founded upon incidents and characters met with during his travels. They are catalogued by Smith."

  "text" : "James Seabrook \"Jim\" Everett (20 July 1884 – 19 June 1968) was an Australian rules footballer who played with West Perth in the West Australian Football League (WAFL). Everett was only 17 when he made his Western Australian Football Association debut in 1901. He was a member of West Perth's 1905 premiership team, won through a grand final replay, as a centre-half back. In the drawn grand final, Everett had played on a half forward flank. The first Western Australian to represent his state in both cricket and football, he played his one and only first-class match for the Western Australian cricket team in the 1909/10 season. The fixture, which took place at the WACA, was played against Victoria. Everett was in the side as a right-arm fast-medium bowler but couldn't take a wicket, finishing with figures of 0/48 off 13 overs in the only innings Western Australia bowled. With the bat he was required twice, coming in at eight in the batting order. He was dismissed by Arthur Kenny in both innings, for 13 and 0. He played his last league game in 1915, before enlisting with the Australian Army in October that year. Everett served with the 44th Battalion and fought on the Western Front. During action in 1918, Everett suffered gunshot wounds to his leg and shoulder. He was evacuated to England, where he recovered from his wounds and returned to Australia at the end of the year."

  "text" : "John Kaestli Edmunds (1900–1989) was a Chicago area lawyer and a leader in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) in the Chicago area. Edmunds was born in Wales, Utah to Thomas Edmunds, an immigrant from Wales, and Frieda Louise Kaestli, an immigrant from Switzerland. When Edmunds was ten his father died. After this the family moved to Logan, Utah. He attended Brigham Young College and Utah State Agricultural College (now Utah State University). Edmunds then served a mission in the Eastern States Mission, presiding over the New Haven District for much of this time. The New Haven District covered all of Connecticut as well as Springfield, Massachusetts. After he returned from his mission, Edmunds continued his schooling at the University of Utah. After graduating from the University of Utah, Edmunds studied at Northwestern University. After obtaining his juris doctorate he was involved in Corporate, Will, Trust and Real Estate Law. While at the University of Utah, Edmunds had served as a member of the General Committee of the YMMIA and been involved in the expansion of the basketball program of that organization. In Chicago besides various assignments in the Logan Square Branch Edmunds served as a special representative of two mission presidents, first George S. Romney and then Bryant S. Hinckley. When the Chicago Stake was organized in 1936, Edmunds was called as a member of the stake presidency. He served in this position until 1945, when he became president of the Chicago Stake. He served in this position for the next 18 years. For about 16 of these years, one of his counselors in the stake presidency was David M. Kennedy. The stake included the entire Chicago Metro Area, including North-west Indiana, and also included Milwaukee, Wisconsin. While Edmunds was stake president, among other things he oversaw the building of a monumental-style stake center that was dedicated by David O. McKay in 1962. In 1963, the Chicago stake was divided into three stakes. The newly organized stakes were the Milwaukee and the Chicago South (later Naperville, Illinois) stakes. Edmunds was called as patriarch of the Chicago Stake (since renamed the Wilmette Illinois Stake) as well as a member of the General Church Board charged with implementing the new Home Teaching program. In the later position Edmunds not only traveled around the US, Canada and Mexico but was periodically sent on church assignments to Europe. In 1967, Edmunds was called as one of the original Regional Representatives of the Twelve in which position he remained until 1969. From 1969–1972 Edmunds served as president of the California Mission based in Los Angeles. He then served from 1972 until 1977 as president of the Salt Lake Temple. After serving as Temple President, Edmunds wrote a book entitled Through Temple Doors which was published by Bookcraft. Edmunds and his wife Jasmine were the parents of two daughters."

  "text" : "Sir James Bacon (11 February 1798 – 1 June 1895) was a British judge and a Vice-Chancellor of the Court of Chancery. Bacon was born at 10 The Polygon, Somers Town, London. His father had gone there from Holt, Norfolk, to work as an attorney's clerk in Clerkenwell. Bacon received part of his early education in Holt. He left school at twelve and worked for some years in the same attorney's firm, Rhodes and Cook, as he relates in his unpublished memoirs. In 1822 he joined Gray's Inn and was called to the bar in 1827. As an impecunious young barrister he engaged in much literary work, such as translations from the French (including the first translation of Victor Hugo) and a pseudonymous “Memoirs of the Life and Writings of Lord Byron” which breached copyright outrageously. John Murray decided not to sue because copyright in works of doubtful moral character had become precarious following the case of William Lawrence. This work was illustrated by George Cruikshank and Bacon knew him and many literary and artistic personalities, including Charles Lamb and Mary Shelley. He joined Lincoln's Inn in 1833 and became a bencher in 1846 soon after becoming a QC. In 1859 he became under-secretary to the Master of the Rolls. He became chief judge in bankruptcy under the Bankruptcy Act 1869, and held this post until the act was repealed in 1883 and jurisdiction over bankruptcy was transferred to the Queen's Bench Division. He also became a vice-chancellor in 1870 and was knighted and appointed to the Privy Council the following year; the post was abolished by the Court of Judicature Act of 1875 but he retained the title until he retired in 1886 at the age of 88. He had become a celebrated figure for his caustic wit and activity to a great age. An example is that when a decision of his was appealed, the only thing on his notes sent to the higher court was a cartoon of the appellant and the words \"This man is a liar.\" Another is: “This case bristles with simplicity. The facts are admitted; the law is plain; and yet it has taken seven days to try – one day longer than God Almighty required to make the world.” He married his wife Laura Cook, daughter of the attorney he and his father worked for, in 1827. Their country estate was Compton Beauchamp House in Berkshire (now Oxfordshire). The couple had four sons together, two of whom predeceased the judge, and one daughter. Their granddaughter Arabella Susan Lawrence was one of the first Labour Party female MPs."

Afterwards, under the name \"John Crompton\", he wrote mainly non-fiction on natural history themes. Beyond his published works little is known about Lamburn’s life and works, because most of his notes were destroyed in an act of arson."

  "text" : "Jeriah Swetland (1817-?) was an American businessman and local politician in nineteenth-century central Ohio. A native of Springfield, New Hampshire, Swetland was the ninth of ten children born to Roswell and Naomi (Rockwell) Swetland. At the age of nineteen, he left home for an apprenticeship in the harnessmaking and saddlemaking trades. In 1841, he married the former Arabella Fellows, who bore him three children. Two years later, he left New Hampshire to settle in London, Ohio, where he began to conduct business; between 1847 and 1856, he moved at various times to Pickaway County, Mount Sterling, and again to London, where he joined in partnership with William Chandler for a ten-year period. Swetland was a prominent part of the society of London; he joined its Masonic lodge in 1850, and he was a member of the Knights of Pythias and a leader in the Knights Templar. After a time of service on London's village council, he was elected as a Democrat to the Ohio House of Representatives, serving from 1867 to 1869. He and his wife were active members of the local congregation of the Methodist Episcopal Church. In 1871, Swetland and his wife built a house on London's east side; known as the Swetland House in the present day, it is listed on the National Register of Historic Places."

He was stationed at Strathglass, Inverness-shire, where he acquired a thorough knowledge of the Gaelic language. On 2 Feb. 1735–6 he made profession of the four vows. About 1745 he was taken prisoner while celebrating mass, and conveyed to Edinburgh in his sacerdotal vestments. After enduring many sufferings he was restored to liberty. Subsequently to the suppression of his order he lived principally in the valley of Braemar, where he died on 13 October 1782. He formed an immense collection of Gaelic poetry. The original folio manuscript in his own handwriting he deposited in 1772 in the Scotch College at Douay. Instead, however, of its being carefully preserved, it was suffered to be thrown aside and to perish. The whole of the poems of Ossian were in this collection, and other compositions not known to Macpherson, or, at least, not published by him."

In December 2010, Prime Minister Edward Natapei was ousted in a motion of no confidence, and PPP leader Sato Kilman replaced him. Kilman set up a coalition government, which did not include Wango, and the latter eventually defected to the Opposition. In February 2011, as the Opposition prepared a motion of no confidence against Kilman's premiership, the Prime Minister secured his majority by offering Wango a position in Cabinet. Wango joined the government as Minister for Agriculture, Livestock, Forestry, Fisheries and Quarantine. Kilman was eventually ousted in a vote of no confidence on 24 April 2011, however, and Wango lost his position in government. He recovered it three weeks later, on 13 May, when the Court of Appeal voided the election of Serge Vohor's new government on constitutional grounds, and the Kilman government was restored. This lasted for only a month; on 15 June, the Kilman premiership was itself voided on constitutional grounds by the Supreme Court's Chief Justice Vincent Lunabek, and Wango lost office once more."

Deans joined James Richardson's expedition to survey Queen Charlotte Islands in 1878, and he was employed by others as a local guide; his collection of ethnographic materials was criticised by some contemporaries for its insensitivity. He presented an exhibition on the Haida people at the World's Columbian Exposition, showing a model village based on materials he had obtained. Amongst his works is a paper presented at \"The Chicago Folk-Lore Congress of 1893\", \"The Superstitions, Customs, and Burial Rites of the Tribes of North-Western America\"."

  "text" : "John Birkbeck (6 July 1817 – 31 July 1890) was a Yorkshireman, banker, alpinist, and pioneer potholer. Born in Settle and educated at the local Giggleswick School and Trinity College, Cambridge (although, as a Quaker, he could not take a degree) he spent most of his life in his home town where he was a partner in the Craven Bank, which his family had established in 1791. He was also a justice of the peace in later life. The family home was Anley (now a nursing home). His name is remembered for his involvement in some early explorations of some of the potholes of Ingleborough, especially Alum Pot and Gaping Gill, although the records are sparse. Around 1842, Birkbeck had the water from Fell Beck diverted down 'the Birkbeck Trench' and went first 100 and then 190 feet down the Main Shaft of Gaping Gill, where there is a ledge which now bears his name, but then 'barred further descent'; no further attempts reached the bottom until Martel reached the Main Chamber, another 170 feet lower, in 1895. In 1847, Birkbeck provided ropes to enable the first recorded descent of Alum Pot, made via Long Churn cave. The bottom was not reached on that occasion, but in the following year a direct descent was made of the main shaft, followed by further descents to where 'the water sank in a quiet rotary pool, so that further progress was impossible'. He was also there for the next descent, which was not until 1870 but is better known as it was described by William Boyd Dawkins in his book, Cave Hunting. He was a member of the party which made the first ascent of Monte Rosa in 1855 and, in 1857, a founder member of the Alpine Club, having been a friend of its first president, John Ball, at Cambridge."

  "text" : "John Ferguson (1787–1856), was a Scottish businessman and philanthropist. He was the founder of the Ferguson bequest. Ferguson was born at Irvine, Ayrshire, 28 February 1787. His father, William Ferguson, was a shipmaster of that port, and his mother, Mary, was the only daughter of John Service of Holms of Caaf, a small property near Dalry, Ayrshire. The Services were an Ayrshire family, some of whom had been lenders of money. The father of Mary Service followed this profession, and was a man of penurious habits and peevish temper. His sons one after another left him for America, where they were under the shelter of an uncle. Ferguson was educated at Ayr, was for some time in a banker's office, went to America in connection with the affairs of one of his uncles, returned after four years, and in 1810 settled with his mother at Irvine. She succeeded to large sums on the death of her brother George and then of her father. The fortune of the Fergusons was increased by the death in 1828 of another uncle, who left 200,000l., and of a third who died in 1842 and left 400,000l. These brothers seem to have had no aim in life but to amass money. Ferguson, by his sagacity and knowledge of the money market, increased the fortune, till at his death it amounted to 1,247,514l. 14s. 5d. He was a man of somewhat ordinary character, undecided, was never married, and for the last few years of his life lived in comparative seclusion. After consulting with Mr. John Henderson of Park, a well-known merchant of Glasgow, who was his intimate friend and acted as his private banker, and Mr. Matthew Montgomery of Kelvinside, he devoted the residue of his property, after providing for family legacies and making other provisions, to the objects of what is known as the Ferguson Bequest Fund. The sum available for it was no less than 400,000l. The trustees were instructed to devote the interest ‘towards the maintenance and promotion of religious ordinances and education and missionary operations; in the first instance in the county of Ayr, stewartry of Kirkcudbright, and counties of Wigton, Lanark, Renfrew, and Dumbarton.’ This was to be done by means of payments for the erection and support of churches and schools, other than parish churches and schools, in connection with the quoad sacra churches of the established Church of Scotland, the Free Church, the United Presbyterian Church, the Reformed Presbyterian Church, and the congregational or independent church, all in Scotland. The administration of this fund was committed to a permanent body of trustees, of whom three were to be of the established church, four of the free, four of the united presbyterian, one of the reformed presbyterian, and one of the independent church. Among the purposes to which the Ferguson trustees devoted another part of Ferguson's estate was the founding of scholarships in connection with the Scottish universities. These are six in number, of the annual value of 80l. each, tenable for two years—one for classical, another for mathematical, and the third for philosophical eminence. The scholarships may be competed for by students of any of the Scottish universities who have taken the degree of M.A., or have qualified for that degree within the two years preceding. The administration of the fund is conducted by the permanent trustees under the superintendency of Matthew S. Tait, by whom an annual report is prepared and submitted to the trustees. Ferguson signed his will at Glasgow on 22 September 1855, and soon after his health began to fail. It is said that after this he got a friend to make up a statement of his property, and when the amount was stated at nearly a million and a quarter he could not believe it to be so much. He died on 8 January 1856, having nearly completed his sixty-ninth year."

He entered the Royal Navy in 1760 and passed the examination for lieutenant, but left the navy and joined the East India Company. He made a fortune from two voyages as captain of the Royal Charlotte, an East Indiaman. He then retired and lived the rest of his life in Leyton, Essex, living at Leyton House from 1789 to 1803, and in Walnut Tree House (today Essex Hall) beginning in 1813. In 1788, he was elected an \"elder brother\" of Trinity House, and in 1803 became deputy-master, holding the latter post for about twenty years. He published a memoir about the origin of Trinity House in 1818. He was a director of the East India Company from 1795 to 1823; he was also a director of the East India Docks Company (chairman in 1803), and a governor of the London Assurance Corporation, and the English Copper Company. He attempted to introduce ramie, a fibre plant, for use in manufacturing, and was awarded a silver medal for this in 1814 by the Society for the Encouragement of Arts and Manufactures; however, the fibre found little commercial usage. He became a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1810. He died in Leyton in 1825 and was buried at the local parish church."

  "text" : "John Cotton (c. 12th century), \"Johannes Afflighemensis\" is the author of a valuable treatise on music, De musica, first printed by Gerbert in 1784. Of this work, there are two manuscripts at Vienna, and one each at Leipzig, Paris, Rome, and Antwerp. A sixth, from which Gerbert printed his edition, was destroyed in the fire at St. Blaise Abbey in 1768. The Vatican copy is said by Fétis to contain much of the best text. The exact date of the treatise is unknown. The Vienna and St. Blaise copies entitle it merely \"Joannis Musica\", while the Paris and Antwerp copies have the name of Cotton or Cottonius. The anonymous monk of Melk Abbey who copied the work, says that there was a learned English musician known as Joannes, and the English origin of the work is rendered more probable by the author's dedicating it \"Domino et patri suo venerabili Anglorum antistiti Fulgentio,\" though the latter, like Cotton, cannot be identified. One theory attributes the work to Pope John XXII, but this rests on the very slight foundation that the author styles himself \"Joannes servus servorum Dei.\" Gerbert has pointed out that this title was not solely used by popes, and it seems unlikely that a pope would address a bishop with deference. The work is also clearly of earlier date, for it speaks of neums being in ordinary use at the time of writing. Another theory ascribes it to a certain \"Joannes Scolasticus\", a monk of St. Matthias' Abbey at Trier, all that is known of whom is that he was living about 1047, and that he wrote much music, but there seems to be no reason why the work should not have been written by the unknown Englishman, John Cotton. From internal evidence its date appears to be the latter part of the 11th or beginning of the 12th century. The work throws much light on the system of harmony of the period."

He built a home on the west bank of the Tombigbee River that became the nucleus of the abortive village of Plymouth, Mississippi. The site is now part of the Plymouth Bluff Environmental Center. Pitchlynn married Sophia Folsom, a mixed-race Choctaw of partly Anglo-American descent, whose father was Ebenezer Folsom, and mother Natika was Choctaw. Sophia's Choctaw name was Lk-lo-ha-wah (loved but lost). The couple married in 1804. The Pitchlynns had ten children. The most notable of these was their son Peter Pitchlynn, who later became principal chief of the Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma after the removal of the 1831 Treaty of Dancing Rabbit Creek."

From the 1690s on, Coney was considered the most important Bostonian silversmith of his day. In 1702, he engraved the paper money for Massachusetts. Coney also designed a version of the seal of Harvard College. John Coney was the apprentice of and later brother-in-law to Jeremiah Dummer, the first American-born silversmith. He married Mary Atwater, sister of Dummer's wife, in 1694. They were widower and widow, Coney was married twice before. He had twelve children in total, but only five daughters survived beyond infancy. His last apprentice, from 1716 until the time of Coney's death, was Apollos Rivoire, father of Paul Revere, and his indirect influence on Revere was considerable. Other apprentices included the brothers Samuel (1684-1713) and John (1692-1720) Gray, early silversmiths from Connecticut, and John Burt. Many examples of his work, including two sugar boxes and two chocolate pots, are in the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston. Other sites containing Coney's work include the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Birmingham Museum of Art, and the Yale University Art Gallery. A silver plate by Coney was sold for $324,750 at Sotheby's in New York in 2002."

In 1966, having been run down by a car, he was unable to work and soon got into debt, because he was unable to work. He was made bankrupt in 1967. He said he was unable to find premises, so he gave out prescriptions for drugs anywhere. He was thought to be selling prescriptions to addicts, which led to him being nicknamed the 'Junkie's Friend'. After pleading guilty at Marylebone Magistrates Court, in February 1968, he was fined £1700. When he was prevented from prescribing any listed dangerous drug, he began to prescribe Methedrine (methamphetamine hydrochloride) in injectable form in ever larger amounts, as this was not then regulated under the Dangerous Drugs Act. Methedrine was a major contributor to the drugs scene, and produced an epidemic at the time. This led finally to him being struck off the Medical Register in May 1968."

He initially worked for Israel Radio, the Jerusalem correspondent for the London Jewish Chronicle, and the Jerusalem Post before joining CNN as an on-air correspondent in 1990. He covered major events affecting Israel for CNN, including the Oslo Accords and the assassination of former Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin. Kessel began producing and co-producing independent television programming after leaving CNN in 2003. He also authored a book of soccer and began writing a sports column for the daily newspaper, Haaretz, the last of which was published a week before his death in 2011. Instrumental in introducing cricket to Israel, Kessel played for the Israel national cricket team in the ICC Trophy from 1979 to 1990.

He resigned and returned to the English mission, 1819. It is recorded that he had great talents which he displayed throughout his College Course, especially in poetry, in which his compositions were of such beauty and excellence that Father Allen, his master, who himself had a most refined taste, expressed his opinion that not even Pope could have struck off more elegant verses in so short a time. He had been chosen Superior in 1795, a position which he held until 1801, when, at his own request, he came to England; to return again, however, as President in May, 1806. Soon after his return to London on March 6, 1819, Buckley was appointed Vicar Apostolic of Trinidad, Trinidad and Tobago, Antilles and titular Bishop of Geras, ordained on June 29, 1819.

He was born at Bedminster, Bristol and died at Darlington, Co Durham. Bucknell was a right-handed lower-order batsman and a right-arm medium pace or leg-break bowler. His first-class cricket career was spasmodic, with three matches in each of the 1895, 1899 and 1905 seasons and a single game in 1904. His best bowling and batting performances were both achieved in his first season, 1895. In his first game, against Cambridge University, he took three Cambridge wickets for 93 runs. Then a week later, in the match against Oxford University he made 33, batting at No 10. His brother Arthur played Minor Counties cricket for Durham."

  "text" : "John Randall (1570–1622), was an English puritan divine. Randall was born in 1570 at Great Missenden, Buckinghamshire, England. At age 11, Randal was sent to St. Mary Hall (now part of Oriel College) in Oxford, where he matriculated on 27 Nov. 1581. Randall then attended Trinity College at Oxford University, and graduated with a BA degree on 9 February 1585. Randall was elected a fellow of Lincoln College at Oxford on 6 July 1587, and received his MA degree on 9 July 1589. Among his pupils at Lincoln was the puritan preacher Robert Bolton. When Queen Elizabeth I's visited Oxford University in August 1592, Randall ran the academical performance given in her honour. Afterwards Randall studied divinity and was admitted B.D. on 28 June 1598. On 31 Jan. 1599, Randall was appointed rector of St. Andrew Hubbard church in Little Eastcheap, London. While at St. Andrew Hubbard, Randall gained a reputation as a staunch Puritan and an effective preacher. In May 1622, Randall died at his house in the Minories parish in London. He was buried in St. Andrew Hubbard. In 1666, the church was destroyed in the Great Fire of London and was never rebuilt. In his will, Randall gave part of his property to the poor of Great Missenden parish, All Hallows parish in Oxford, and St. Andrew's parish; a tenement called Ship Hall; and to Lincoln College. The rest of his estate went to relatives. Randall's wife and daughter predeceased him. His portrait, painted when he was fellow of Lincoln College, hangs in the common room there. In addition to separate sermons, published posthumously by his friend William Holbrook, Randall left for publication Three-and-Twenty Sermons or Catechisticall Lectures upon the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper, preached Monthly before the Communion, London, 1630, 4to; published by his executor, Joshua Randall."

While working at a camera store in Brooklyn, he began a side career of photography and opened his own studio in 1964. Later Brodsky left the rock ‘n’ roll photography and focused on commercial work, shooting advertising campaigns for Revlon, Avon, DuPont and other companies.Since the beginning of the new century, there has been a worldwide revival of interest in Brodsky's rock ‘n’ roll pictures, with several exhibitions across the USA and in Europe. His artwork has been shown by the Govinda Gallery in Washington, DC , the Morrison Hotel Gallery , the Stax Museum in Memphis, the San Francisco Art Exchange and the Snap Galleries in London, UK ."

  "text" : "James Daniel Wilson is an English actor, voice-over artist and writer in various media including lip sync translations of foreign films into English. Films James has written for include The Door starring Helen Mirren and directed by István Szabó, Vicky and The Treasure of the Gods and Vicky the Viking. As an actor he has worked extensively in theatre, TV, film and voice-overs. Theatre credits include the inaugural production of Home at the National Theatre of Scotland in conjunction with Frantic Assembly and the role of Giles Ralston in the West End production of The Mousetrap. James worked with Kali Theatre Company on the site-specific piece My Daughter's Trial. The show played to sell-out audiences in the old courtroom above Browns Restaurants on St. Martins Lane, London. James's voice can be heard in the feature-length animated films Gnomeo and Juliet and Minions. His computer game credits include the voice of the lead character Nowe in Drakengard 2 and Ser Wesley Vallen in Dragon Age II. James regularly records for Dorling Kindersley as a Lucasfilm-approved voice. He has recorded a number of DK Readers including Star Wars The Clone Wars - Jedi in Training, Forces of Darkness and Jedi Heroes, and continues to record new titles. James has also recorded a number of unabridged audiobooks including Alan Hollinghurst's The Stranger's Child, the follow up to his Booker Prize winning The Line of Beauty. \"Wilson is a triumph, bringing character's voices recognisably from childhood to old age... mesmerisingly examined for meaning,\" said Karen Robinson of The Sunday Times on his reading of The Stranger's Child. Other titles include John Boyne's Crippen, Herbie Brennan's The Ruler of the Realm and Faerie Lord, F. E. Higgins' The Eyeball Collector, The Bone Magician and The Black Book of Secrets, which received the Merit award at the CBI Book of the Year Awards, Matt Haig's The Runaway Troll and Shadow Forest, Janet Foxley's Muncle Trogg and the role of Cooper in Mike Gayle's The Life and Soul of the Party. For years, James played Paul, one of the new generation of The Tomorrow People in the audio series by Big Finish Productions. The audio series was cancelled due to the discontinuation of a licensing arrangement with Fremantle Media Enterprises in December 2007. Wilson also guest-starred in Big Finish Production's audio productions Sapphire and Steel - The School, as Max, and in Doctor Who, as Brian, in The Rapture."

Prior to that he had performed administrative duties in Yorkshire, in Norfolk (as sub-sheriff and then as steward of Norwich Cathedral) and with the Earl of Oxford, Robert de Vere. During his appointment as justice, he also represented the king on diplomatic missions abroad. His legal career ended in 1290 when, along with two other Justices of the King's Bench, he was heavily fined and committed to the Tower of London because of his complicity in the falsification of court records by the Chief Justice Thomas Weyland while the king was away in France. He was placed in the Tower yet again in 1293 while in service to Eleanor, the queen. Eight years after his death, his son John unsuccessfully entered into three-year-long legal proceedings against Walter Langton, Bishop of Coventry, accusing him of arranging the murder of his father and committing adultery with his stepmother Joan, Lovelot's second wife."

  "text" : "John Fawcett the younger (1825?–1857), was an English organist. Fawcett was the third son of John Fawcett. Fawctt studied music under his father. He was organist of St. John's Church, Farnworth, Lancashire from 1825 till 1842, and afterwards (until his death) of Bolton parish church, a post which had previously been held by an elder brother, and which was taken by a sister for a year in the interval of Fawcett's visit to London. Here he entered the Royal Academy of Music on 5 December 1845, to study under Sterndale Bennett, and became organist at Earl Howe's Curzon Street church. On his return to Bolton, Fawcett resumed his duties as organist, teacher, and (1849) honorary conductor of the Bolton Harmonic Society. He obtained the degree of Mus. Bac. at Oxford University on 3 November 1852. His exercise, a sacred cantata, ‘Supplication and Thanksgiving,’ was performed at the Music School, the composer conducting, and was published by subscription in 1856. This well-written cantata is the most important of Fawcett's compositions. He died in Manchester on 1 July 1857."

  "text" : "John Ewen (1741–1821), is credited with the authorship of the well-known Scottish song, ‘0 weel may the boatie row'. Ewen was born in Montrose in 1741 of poor parents, and received only a very slender education. Having saved a few pounds he went in 1762 to Aberdeen, where he opened a small hardware shop. This appears to have prospered, but the chief rise in his fortunes was owing to his marriage in 1766 to Janet Middleton, one of two daughters of a yarn and stocking maker in Aberdeen. Through her, who died shortly after giving birth to a daughter, he became possessed of one half of his father-in-law's property. Ewen died on 21 Oct 1821, leaving, after the payment of various sums to the public charities of Aberdeen, about 14,000l to found a hospital in Montrose, similar to Gordon's Hospital, Aberdeen, for the maintenance and education of boys. The will was challenged by the daughter's relations, and after conflicting decisions in the Scottish court of session was appealed to the House of Lords, who, on 17 November 1830, set aside the settlement on the ground that the deed was void in consequence of its want of precision as to the sum to be accumulated by the trustees before building and as to the number of boys to be educated on the foundation. ‘O weel may the boatie row’ was published anonymously in Johnson's ‘Scots Musical Museum.’ It is thus characterised by Robert Burns: ‘It is a charming display of womanly affection mingling with the concerns and occupations of life. It is nearly equal to “There's nae luck about the house.”’"

  "text" : "John Forbes (born 29 January 1970) is an Australian sailor. He was an Australian Institute of Sport scholarship holder. John Forbes was introduced to catamaran sailing on an international level at the age of 12. He and father Bob went to the USA to compete in the 1982 Nacra 5.2 North American Championships where they placed fourth. The following year John and Bob attended the inaugural Nacra 5.2 World Championship where they came second, and John then travelled to Monterey Bay where, with fellow Australian David Renouf, they finished 4th place in the Nacra 5.8 North American Championship. After this \"deep-end dunking\" as a crew John took over the helm of various types of catamarans and with brother Rod on a Nacra 5.2 won the 1985 Australian Combined High Schools Championship outright, winning a couple of the races in the series on handicap/yardstick as well as outright.John, with Rod as crew, also came 3rd in the 1985 Nacra NSW State Championship, 1st in the 1986 Nacra NSW State Championship, 2nd in the Prindle 18 National Championship and 4th in the Nacra Australian Championship. John's first introduction to the International Tornado Class was at the 1986/87 Australian Championship in Perth where, whilst only 16 he helmed his first Tornado catamaran and placed 10th amongst a star-studded fleet including Multi Olympic Gold Medallist Poul Elvstrom, “the Great Dane”. John's youthful success and versatility, together with his accumulated competitive experience on different sized catamarans, resulted in him being approached by 1984 Olympic Bronze Medallist Chris Cairns, who asked John to sail with him. Together they won the 1987 Kiel Week Regatta followed by a second place in the 1987 Tornado Class World Championship. In 1989 John teamed up with Hobie legend Rod Waterhouse to win the Australian Tornado Championship with a perfect score winning all 8 heats. Rod Waterhouse's inability to travel overseas in 1989 led John to join up with longtime sailing rival Mitch Booth, and together they won the 1989 World Championship (Houston, Texas) by an astounding 36 points from their good friend Giorgio Zuccoli from Italy. They also won the 1990 and 1991 Australian Tornado Championships. A role reversal in 1991 saw John again taking over the helm to win the inaugural Nacra 5.8 World Championship (Harvey Bay, Queensland). Mitch and John's credits also include winning the `92, `93 & `94 Tornado Australian Championships and in 1992 they won their second Tornado World Championship (Perth, Australia). Gold and Silver medals were also won in the 1990 and 1991 Barcelona Pre-Olympic Games respectively, and the pair were rewarded when they won a Bronze Medal at the 1992 Barcelona Olympic Games. As a result, they were jointly awarded the prestigious New South Wales Yachtsman of the Year trophy in November 1991 and again in 1992. As a final toast they were honoured, again jointly, with the distinguished award - as 1992 Ampol Australian Yachtsman of the Year. A creditable second place was scored at the 1993 Tornado World Championship (Long Beach, USA) and was followed up by a third place at the 1994 World Championship (Bastard, Sweden). A twelve-year relationship with the Tornado Class has also seen John give back an enormous amount of personal time and effort to both the Australian International Tornado Association (AITA) and the International Tornado Association (ITA). He was elected President of the AITA in 1994 taking over the reigns from Dr Peter Blaxland who had been President for the past 20 years. John's significant contributions to the Class both nationally and internationally led him to be re-elected again in 1996. At the ITA AGM in Canada in August, 1995 John was also elected as President of the ITA in charge of International and Olympic affairs and was also responsible for the election of the new younger and pro¬active Technical Committee of the ITA. January 1995 saw a major change to John's Olympic Tornado Campaign with the much publicised break-up with partner Mitch Booth. John teamed up with his main competitor and longtime catamaran sailor Darren Bundock who had impressed Forbes during his 1992 Olympic Games Campaign. Together they established a successful two-boat training campaign as part of their lead-up to the 1996 Selection Regattas. Their successes stream-rolled by winning both the Sail Sydney Regatta and the NSW State Titles. An outstanding result at the Pre-Olympic Regatta in Atlanta saw the pair place 4th.One week later they followed up at the 1995 Worlds in Kingston, Canada with a final placing of 14th (8th Nation). Not bad considering on the second day of racing they were cut in half by an Austrian Team and were forced to miss both heats 2 & 3 of the series as their hull was beyond repair. January 1996 saw Forbes and Bundock win the Australian Championship by a clear 10 points from a star-studded International fleet in preparation for the 1996 World Championships. At the 1996 World Championship (Mooloolaba, Australia), Forbes and Bundock finished a brilliant third overall. With the Olympic Selections up for grabs these two sailors believed they had proven beyond doubt that they were at the elite level required to bring home a Gold Medal from Atlanta. However, as a result of the Australian Yachting Federation changing the AOC endorsed Olympic Selection Criteria after the first of the two Olympic Selection Regattas had been completed, John and Darren were denied selection to the Australian Olympic Team and forced to set their sights on Sydney 2000. Determined by the disappointment of denial of Olympic Selection, John and Darren kept the momentum of their Olympic campaign with training partner Andrew Macpherson. John and Darren dominated the Australian Tornado Regatta circuit and won the 1996 NSW and QLD State Championships. 1997 saw John and Darren top the Australian Yachting circuit by defending their National title crown in Perth, winning the International Sail Melbourne, Go for Gold regatta and placing second in the Sail Sydney regatta. John and Darren placed best Australian in both the 1997 NSW State Titles (3rd overall) and the Australian International Regatta, Sydney (2nd overall), a 5th place (3rd Nation) at the 1997 World Championship in Bermuda and then topped off the year by winning the 1997 Sydney International Regatta. 1998 started off with John and Darren winning their third Australian Championship in a row. In May and June they went off to Europe to place third at both the European Championships in Greece and the Kiel Week event in Germany as well as winning the Danish Spring Cup and placing the best Australian in the Dutch Spa Regatta. In September, John and Darren sailed away with the GOLD at the Sydney Harbour Regatta, organized by SOCOG as the first ever Sydney 2000 Olympic Test event. In November John and Darren achieved their greatest feat to date winning both the South American Championship and the 1998 World Championship (Buzios, Brazil). They never looked back, winning the World Championship by an incredible 18 points from longtime training partners Roland Gaebler and Rene Schwall (Germany). This win made John the first ever Tornado sailor to win three world championships. Since 1967 there were eight sailors who had previously won two world championships but 31 years after the inaugural event Forbes became the first person to make it three wins. John and Darren started off 1999 the way they left 1998 by winning Sail Melbourne which was represented by six nations. February saw the pair cross the Tasman to dominate the Sail Auckland regatta. By the end of 1999 they had finished a four-month European campaign and captured the Number 1 spot on the prestigious ISAF O’Neill World Rankings after winning the Princess Sofia Trophy (Spain), the European Championship (Spain), Kiel Week (Germany) and placing 3rd in Hyeres and 4th at the World Championships in Copenhagen, Denmark. By the end of January 2000 they were selected into the Olympic Team to represent Australia in their hometown Sydney 2000 Olympic Games where they won the Silver medal. The Gold medal was won by Roman Hagara and Hans Peter Steinacher from Austria with it being Austria's first ever Gold medal at the summer Olympics. Their achievements after Sydney 2000 continued with Bundock and Forbes clean streaking the 2001 Tornado regatta program by winning the World Championship in Richards Bay, South Africa in February and their second European Championship in Silvaplana, Switzerland in August. They also won the 2001/02 Australian Championship for the fourth time together (Forbes’ 10th time) and the 2002 NSW State Titles. Awards and rewards were also forthcoming. On 11 December 2001 Darren and John were one of five finalists for the NSW Institute of Sports “Athlete of the Year”. Other finalists included (first ever female) World Rowing Champions Vicky Roberts and Julia Wilson, Triathlete Peter Robertson, Louise Savage from wheelchair track and road and swimmer (and winner) Ian Thorpe.On 17 December 2001 John was inducted into the Sydney Northern Beaches Hall of Fame alongside other famous sporting personalities including surfing’s Tom Carrol, Netball’s Anne Sargeant and Swimming’s John Devitt.On 27 February 2002 Darren and John were awarded the Australian Institute of Sport top “Athlete/Team of the Year”.This was then followed by Darren and John being awarded the “2001/02 BEA Australian Sailor of the Year” award at Darling Harbour on 8 June 2002. Darren & John were ecstatic with this announcement having previously been finalist in 1999 and 2000 and it being ten years since John previously won the award after his 1992 World Championship and 1992 Barcelona Bronze Medal haul. Darren and John continued their success in 2003 winning the three biggest and most important Tornado Regattas of the year being the 2003 European Championship (Gran Canaries), the 2003 Athens Test Event (Pre-Olympics) and the 2003 World Championship (Cadiz, Spain - 72 boats from 26 nations). The win for Darren and John put them again in the record books as it was John’s incredible sixth Tornado World Championship Title (1989,92,98,01,02,03) and Darren’s fourth (98,01,02,03). Forbes equalled that of Brazilian sailor Robert Schiedt who had recently won six Laser dinghy class World Titles. Combine all of that with winning the 2003 Sail Melbourne regatta in January and the pair were selected to represent Australia at the Athens 2004 Olympic Games and were earmarked by many as being the Gold medal favourites. As a result of the successes both in 2002 and 2003 Darren and John also received the following accolades:Australian Institute of Sport – Team of the Year.Australian Yachting Federation – Male Sailors of the Year.NSW Yachting Association – Male Sailors of the Year.NSW Institute of Sport – Team Athletes of the Year.International Sailing Federation – Rolex World Sailor of the Year - finalist. Whilst the Greek wind Gods didn't show up on time for the Tornado event in Athens, John and Darren still finished a credible 6th place overall and, after three Olympic Games and 18 years at World and Olympic level sailing, Forbes announced his retirement from the sport due to family commitments with his wife Caroline and two daughters Teigan and Bronte. Darren Bundock continued sailing Tornado catamarans and, with Glenn Ashby as Forbes' replacement, they went on to win a further world championship and the Silver medal at the Beijing 2008 Olympic Games. Both Darren and Glenn then joined the highly spectacular and successful 2013 America's Cup teams."

  "text" : "Jens Schanche (1717 – 1787) was a Norwegian postmaster and postal inspector. He contributed significantly to the development and reform of the Norwegian postal service (Posten Norge). Schanche grew up at the trading post of Karstenøya on Ytter-Vikna in Nord-Trondelag, Norway. From 1742 he worked as a procurator in Trondheim. When the postmaster in the city was suspended in 1748, Schanche became acting postmaster. He visited Copenhagen in 1752 and put forward their ideas for postal reform in Norway. In 1758, Schanche's postal proposals were adopted virtually in their entirety. This resulted in the mail system in Norway undergoing its biggest change since the establishment of postal service in 1647. His plan was instrumental in the transition from postal transport being a duty imposed on farmers as mail carriers. The majority of postal farmers now received salaries and the rural sub-post office system is formalized. As a reward for his efforts, Schanche was moved to the postmaster office in Christiania (now Oslo). Schanche was given the title post controller and conducted thorough checks in an effort to end fraud. In 1770, he received the title of Chancellor (Norwegian: kanselliråd). Schanche resigned from the postmaster office in Christiania in 1780, but continued as postal inspector with residence in Trondheim."

  "text" : "Helen Joyce McKee (October 29, 1933 in Asquith, Saskatchewan – December 28 or 29, 1999 in Saskatoon) was a Canadian curler from Saskatoon, Saskatchewan. She was a five time Canadian champion. McKee won her very first provincial title as a skip in 1954, before the creation of a Canadian women's championship. She won again in 1960, earning the right to play at the Western Canada women's championship in Victoria, British Columbia. Her Saskatchewan rink defeated Alberta 14–11 in the Western final, and was invited to play the Eastern Canadian champion Ruth Smith rink from Quebec in an unofficial championship in Oshawa, Ontario. McKee's team defeated the Quebec team in two matches, 11–3 and 8–5. The following season, the McKee rink once again won the provincial title. This time, the Canadian Ladies' Curling Association organized a national championship with a similar format to the Brier, the Canadian men's championship. This first event would be called the 1961 Diamond D Championship, and it was held at the Ottawa Hunt and Golf Club in Ottawa. McKee and her rink of Sylvia Fedoruk, Barbara MacNevin, Rosa McFee won the new event, finishing with an undefeated 9-0 record. In 1969, McKee returned to national championship, skipping the team of Vera Pezer, Lenore Morrison and Jennifer Falk to another Saskatchewan and Canadian championship. The team was tied with Ontario in their final round robin game with a 7–1 record. They happened to play Ontario in their final game which they won, 6–5, earning them the championship. The team then changed its lineup to have Pezer skip and McKee throw second stones, and brought in Sheila Rowan to throw third stones. This team won three more Saskatchewan and Canadian national championships from 1971 to 1973. Later in life, McKee won the 1992 Canadian Senior Curling Championships playing lead for the Sheila Rowan rink. Outside of curling, McKee was employed in the parts department by Merlin Motors."

  "text" : "Jacques-Louis Copia, a French engraver, was born at Landau in 1764. He went to Paris, and among other plates executed a charming little portrait of Queen Marie Antoinette, after Piauger, which is very rare. He also engraved a head of Marat, terribly startling in its ghastliness, from a drawing made by David immediately after his assassination. But Copia is chiefly identified with Prud'hon, the voluptuous genius of whose works no one has more fully comprehended. It must, however, be admitted that, apart from the great painter, Copia would have remained hidden in the crowd. His style was neither original nor brilliant, and his rare qualities of modelling and softness of execution required works suitable for their display. He died in Paris in 1799, unfortunately too early to be able to engrave the greatest works of his friend. But among other pupils he left one, Roger, who caught his manner, and is thought by many to have surpassed his master in the interpretation of the spirit of Prud'hon. The following are the works of Prud'hon which have been engraved by Copia: \n* The French Constitution. \n* Equality, and Law; two small bas-reliefs from the preceding composition. \n* Liberty. \n* The Revenge of Ceres. \n* Love brought to rea«on. \n* Love laughing at the tears which he has caused to flow; a companion to the preceding. \n* En Jouir; an illustration to Gentil-Bernard's 'Art d'Aimer,' Didot's edition, 1797. \n* The First Kiss of Love; and four other illustrations to Rousseau's 'Nouvelle Héloise,' Bossange's edition, 1808."

  "text" : "James Taylor (ca. 1794 – February 4, 1856) was a businessman and political figure in New Brunswick. He represented York in the Legislative Assembly of New Brunswick from 1833 to 1856. He was born in Fredericton, the son of James Taylor who was a native of Scotland. With his brothers William and John F., he entered the family business in timber, ship building and construction. In 1829, he married Nancy Hatfield, whose sister had married his brother William. Taylor was a director of the Nashwaak Mill and Manufacturing Company, later serving as president of its milling operations. He also was a founder of the Central Bank of New Brunswick and a director of the Fredericton branch of the Bank of British North America. Taylor also helped found the Fredericton Hotel and Stage Coach Company. He ran unsuccessfully for a seat in the New Brunswick assembly in 1830, but was declared elected in 1833 after he appealed the results of the by-election held in 1832 following the death of John Dow. Taylor served as paymaster and captain in the county militia. In 1840, he was named a justice of the peace and, in 1850, a customs controller. Taylor died in office in Fredericton."

Evelyn, in his ‘Sculptura’ (1662), speaks of him as ‘J. Fellian, disciple of Mr. Faithorne, who is a hopeful young man.’ He died early, about 1680, before these hopes could be realised. Very few of his engravings exist, notably a portrait of Thomas Cromwell, Earl of Essex, published by P. Stent in 1658, a good work; a portrait of his master, Faithorne, from a drawing by himself; a copy of J. Payne's portrait of Paracelsus; ‘Dr. Michael,’ after Guido Reni; and the frontispiece to P. Heylyn's ‘Cosmography,’ published in 1669. Walpole was of opinion that Faithorne's engraving of ‘Christ with a Globe,’ from a picture attributed to Raphael, was completed by Fillian."

Woodberry also emphasizes a holistic approach to missions that is theologically sound, learned in behavioural sciences, and is not ignorant of mission and church history."

  "text" : "Jacob Israel Zeitlin (November 4, 1902 – August 30, 1987) was an American bookseller, publisher, collector, poet and intellectual in Los Angeles in the mid-twentieth century. He was born in Racine, Wisconsin, but moved with his family to Fort Worth, Texas in his childhood and to Los Angeles in 1925. For many years, Zeitlin lived in the Echo Park area of Los Angeles. He opened his first bookshop in 1928, on Hope Street near 6th Street in downtown Los Angeles, and over the years moved his shop a number of times, its final location being in a converted barn on La Cienega Boulevard. He founded the Primavera Press, to produce fine printed books, and was a co-founder of the Rounce & Coffin Club, which supported and encouraged fine printing in Southern California for many years. During his sixty years as a rare book seller, he and his many friends and associates, known as the \"Zeitlin circle,\" was a significant force in the cultural and intellectual life of Los Angeles. In 1963, he testified in a California Supreme Court obscenity hearing on Henry Miller's novel Tropic of Cancer. Zeitlin was one of the first people to exhibit the woodcuts of fellow Echo Park resident Paul Landacre and the photographs of Edward Weston, as well as the first in America to exhibit the work of German artist Käthe Kollwitz. Zeitlin was also a poet and the editor of Opinion, a short-lived but influential Angeleno intellectual journal. A liberal in politics, Zeitlin was the campaign manager for Helen Gahagan Douglas' Senatoral campaign. He also lobbied against the La Cienega Boulevard highway, bringing artistic friends such as actor and art dealer Joan Ankrum to Sacramento to protest."

He etched a plate representing 'Our Lord on the Mount of Olives,' and a series of seven scenes from the history of Venus.

He first appears as an exhibitor with the Free Society of Artists in 1770, sending ‘A View from Maise [Maze] Hill in Greenwich Park,’ and ‘A View of a Storm breaking from the Surrey side of Westminster Bridge;’ in 1771 he sent to the same exhibition ‘A View taken from Highgate Hill.’ In 1772 he appears as an exhibitor at the Royal Academy with ‘A View of Clapham Common, taken from the North Side,’ and he was a frequent contributor up to 1788, in which year he exhibited ‘A View of Castle Hill, Devonshire,’ after which he disappears. Feary, who was of deformed stature, is stated to have been a pupil of Richard Wilson, R.A., and his landscapes were very neatly finished.

  "text" : "James Travers (c. 1948 – March 3, 2011) was a Canadian journalist, best known as an editor and political correspondent for the Toronto Star. Born in Hamilton, Ontario, Travers began his journalism career in 1972 with the Oakville Journal Record in Oakville. He later joined Southam Newspapers, working as a foreign correspondent covering Africa and the Middle East. He served as the editor of the Ottawa Citizen from 1991 to 1996, when he resigned shortly after Southam sold the paper to Hollinger. He joined the Toronto Star as an editor the following year, later returning to column writing as the paper's national affairs columnist. He won a National Newspaper Award in 2009 for a column titled \"The quiet unravelling of Canadian democracy\". Following the announcement of his death, tributes were delivered in the Canadian House of Commons by several political figures, including Stephen Harper, Michael Ignatieff and Bob Rae. Friends and colleagues of Jim Travers have established a fellowship fund to finance significant foreign reporting projects by Canadian journalists - staffers, freelancers or students - working in any medium. The fund has been established to make an annual award of $25,000 to cover travel, reporting and research expenses and a stipend for a journalist."

Having left the academies he produced paintings, sculptures, wood-carvings and furniture for churches throughout Germany and Switzerland. In 1917 he became a member of the group of artists called De Ploeg (the plough), a similar group to Die Brücke but with a tendency towards abstraction. During a stay in the Davos in 1920, he became friends with the German Expressionist Ernst Ludwig Kirchner who became a strong influence on his art. In 1934 he moved to Amsterdam and co-founded the magazine De kroniek van kunst en kultuur. In 1953 he was appointed professor of the National Academy."

  "text" : "John Dobbin (baptised 21 March 1815 St Cuthbert's, Darlington - 1888 London) was an English landscape painter, the son of John and Elizabeth who lived in Weaver's Yard. John, the son, did not follow the same trade as his father, who was a weaver working in Pease's Mill in Darlington town centre, but was apprenticed instead to a cabinet-maker in Grange Road. He was not happy with this choice of career and in his twenties left for London to become an artist. Dobbin later travelled extensively in Scotland, France, Spain, Germany and the Netherlands. He exhibited at the Royal Academy between 1842 and 1875. Dobbin's best-known work is the Opening of the Stockton to Darlington Railway, showing Ignatius Bonomi's Skerne Viaduct, portrayed until 2003 on the reverse of Series E £5 notes issued by the Bank of England, where George Stephenson's portrait is shown along with the Rocket steam locomotive. John was 10 years old at the time, and possibly attended the historic opening, but it was only 50 years later that the picture was painted, so that it was done either from memory or from a sketch by his father. Dobbin frequently returned to his home town, and Darlington features in many of his works. His paintings became more spiritual after the death of his first wife, Amy. His second wife, Hannah Jones, came from an affluent family and probably paid for his Grand Tour of Europe. Dobbin was fairly renowned in his day and enjoyed an audience with Isabella II of Spain, who gave him free rein to paint what he pleased in her country. Dobbin created a reredos for St Cuthbert's Church. In a move that may have been inspired by his Italian trip, he turned to mosaic and worked for some six years cutting tiles for his version of The Last Supper. His Apostles were described by a clergyman as \"the most villainous set of mortals I have ever seen\"."

  "text" : "Joseph Kam (September 1769 – July 18, 1833) was a Dutch missionary in Indonesia. His father, Joost Kam, was a leather merchant in 's-Hertogenbosch, Netherlands. The family were members of the Reformed Church, influenced by the spirit of Herrnhut pietism, and had links with Herrnhut groups in Zeist. Kam helped his father in the leather trade, but was eager to preach the gospel to the nations which did not yet not know Christianity. In 1802, when Kam's father and mother died, he left the leather business and worked at the National Court. He married in 1804, but his wife died two months after giving birth. Kam then joined Nederlandse Zendeling-Genootschap and moved to Rotterdam to receive the preparation of Zendeling candidate there. In Rotterdam he received the education of Zendeling candidate, together with Gottlob Bruckner and Johann Ch. Supper from Germany. In 1811, his preparatory education for was finished, but he was not yet able to be dispatched to the mission field because of the war between England and France. NZG then tried to post Kam to the mission field by smuggling him into Britain. In October 1812, Kam and his colleagues arrived in London and saw the London Missionary Society administrators. They were then sent to Gosport to receive further educational preparation, while serving churches there. In 1813, he was ordained a priest in London. In 1814, he arrived in Batavia with his two colleagues, Bruckner and Supper. At that time, Kam and his colleagues became Indische Kerk employees. Since the Indische Kerk prioritizes maintenance of the congregations that already exist. Therefore, Supper remained in Batavia to serve the congregation there, Bruckner was stationed in Semarang, and Kam himself stationed on Ambon. Mid-1814, Kam traveled to Ambon but ended up stopping in Surabaya because no ships were sailing to Ambon. While in Surabaya, he worked in Indische Kerk's congregation there. In March 1815, he arrived in Ambon, and immediately started working with congregations in the Maluku Islands which had long been abandoned by the Dutch. In the Maluku Islands, Kam perform all the duties of a pastor, such as preaching, visiting the congregations, arbitrate disputes and quarrels, and served sacraments. He is also active in developing Christian readings, like the Bible, Psalms, Catechism, and sermons for congregations without ministers or teachers. Shortly after Kam arrived in Ambon, he married a woman of Indo-Dutch extraction, Sara Maria Timmerman, who remained at his side until the end of his life. Kam is considered by the Protest Church in the Moluccas to be one of the significant shapers of their history. In his trip to Southeast Maluku, he became seriously ill, and was forced to return to Ambon. After 20 years service in the Maluku Islands, he died on July 18, 1833, and was buried in Ambon."

  "text" : "Dr. James W. Gay was a herbal Indian medicine man. He was born in the Miami Village on the Wabash River, in the year 1840, and stayed with them until 1854. Dr. James W. Gay's father came from Scotland where he was born in the year 1787. His father practiced medicine among the Miami and Delaware tribes of Indians and white settlers, along the Wabash River. It was there his father met his mother, (half Miami). Dr. James W. Gay did not get along with the Miami chief, so he left the tribe and set out a life of adventure. He followed the setting sun and joined the Pawnees on the Missouri River in the Fall of 1854. He stayed with the Pawnee and helped them with hunting and war. The Sioux was a tribe that had killed his brother. While with the Pawnee's he was at war almost continuously with the Sioux, River, Crows, and Black Foot Indian Tribes in which he was wounded three times. Dr. Gay left the Pawnee Indians in the year 1859 in order to become educated. He retraced his trail toward the rising sun, and began studying at a school in Illinois. He had used the knowledge of herbal medicine taught from his father when with the Pawnees. While attending this school, he also practiced medicine under the mentorship of Dr. Harvey Mantonya of Fulton County, Illinois. Then in 1861, the American Civil War broke out. Dr. Gay was taught from childhood, \"the young warrior first, the old warrior last,\" so he enlisted as a private in Company G. 55th Regiment of the Illinois Volunteer Infantry. He served as a private in the Battle of Shiloh. During the battle, the Colonel, observed his cool and collective manner and his deliberate aim with his rifle, so the Colonel appointed him Color Bearer of the Regiment. He served in that capacity until July 22, 1864, when he was taken prisoner at the Battle of Atlanta in Georgia. Dr. Gay was taken captive and confined in the \"Southern Hell,\" Andersonville Prison, until September 22, 1864, when he was exchanged on what was known as the \"Sherman's Special\". When entering Andersonville, Georgia, Dr. Gay weighed 261 lbs., and when exchanged he weighed 136 pounds and was on crutches. While in prison, he relied on the African American prisoners to bring him certain barks and roots, and with these he cured much sickness and healed many gangrenous wounds. Dr. Gay's pay was the gratitude of the poor suffering soldiers. After leaving prison, he soon regained sufficient strength to again take the battlefield but in a different capacity. He was appointed Scout and Messenger for General Steadman, Logan, Lightburn and Col. Mott, and operating in Union with Col. Bronlow and Capt. Littell of the 5th Tennessee Cavalry. He served in this capacity until the end of the war. He was in 32 battles during the Civil War and was wounded twice. At the close of the War, he resumed his practice of Medicine, gathering and manufacturing his own remedies from the \"Drug Store\" of our \"Creator\". Dr. Gay practiced medicine continuously until the Fall of 1901. When he moved from Gladstone, Illinois, to Winfield, Kansas, to retire from active practice and to put his remedies before the public, as he wrote transcripts that wouldn't be published until 2009 by the currently owning descendants of his remedies. On January 28, 1902, Dr. Gay was married to Nellie F. Ammerman and had a daughter, Sylvia N., together. He had several step-children, Harry of Des Moines, Iowa, Mary Eva Thomas of Wichita, Kansas, Ruby Mutter of Burlington, Iowa, Fanny Wilson of San Diego, California, and Clifford Ammerman of Winfield, Kansas. Around 1919, Gay had moved his family to Dallas City, Illinois, where he continued his practice until his death in 1927. Dr. Gay believed in \"universal freedom, a free and unlimited future for all men, and a free and untrammeled education\". He believed we should be \"self made man\" and should \"sacrifice life for principle, liberty and government. Merit should be the only scale to weigh man or professions. A man should stand upon his own virtues and his meritous value to the community in which he lives.\" He believed in \"just and equitable laws with special privileges to none, no monopolies should be permitted to entrench themselves behind a legislature enactment for protection, but that each individual or organization should be held strictly accountable for their own acts.\" He also had written many poems and songs. We give such balms as have no strife.With nature or the laws of life.With blood our hands we never stain.Nor poison men to ease their pain."

  "text" : "Jack Winston Darcus (born February 22, 1941 in Vancouver, British Columbia) is a Canadian film director, screenwriter, and painter. Since graduating from the University of British Columbia with a Bachelor of Arts Degree in 1963, Jack Darcus has divided his artistic career between painting and filmmaking. In 1969, already an established painter, he directed his first feature film - a documentary entitled Great Coups of History. Though consistently well received by critics, his films have never reached a large audience beyond film scholars and fanatics. In 1982 he wrote and directed Deserters, his most acclaimed film which concerns two American Vietnam War deserters in Canada. The film earned Darcus three Genie Award nominations for his direction, screenplay and editing. Darcus had also directed for the CBC and Atlantis Films. Darcus has not directed a film since 1997 but still remains a devoted painter whose paintings have been exhibited nationally and internationally, and he has also written three novels."

Blagrave was the son of Anthony Blagrave of Bulmershe Court at Earley in Berkshire and his wife Dorothy, daughter of Thomas Dolman of Shaw House in the same county. He was baptised in the parish church at Sonning on 12 August 1630. He was educated at St John's College, Oxford being awarded BA in 1651 and MA in 1653. He was a Fellow of St John's and was later at Middle Temple in 1655. In 1660, Blagrave was returned unopposed as Member of Parliament for Reading in the Convention Parliament, but did not stand in 1661. He was re-elected MP for Reading in 1679 and sat until 1685. He was a major in the Royal Berkshire Militia and was arrested at the time of Monmouth's invasion in 1685. Blagrave married Hester, daughter of William Gore, a merchant from Barrow Gurney in Somerset and Morden in Surrey. They had seven children, including Anthony Blagrave who was also MP for Reading. Blagrave died at the age of 73 and was buried in the family vault in Sonning Church on 9 March 1704."

  "text" : "John Gwynneth (fl. 1557), was a Welsh Catholic divine and musician. Gwynneth was the son of David ap Llewelyn ap Ithel of Llyn, brother to Robert ap Llewelyn ap Ithel of Castelmarch, Carnarvonshire, ancestor of Sir William Jones, knight. He was educated at Oxford, and being a poor man he was, says Wood, 'exhibited to by an ecclesiastical Mecænas,' in the hope that he would write against the heretics. In due course he was ordained priest, and on 9 December 1531 he supplicated the university for leave to practise in music and for the degree of doctor of music, as he had composed all the responses for a whole year 'in cantis chrispis aut fractis, ut aiunt,' and many masses, including three masses of five parts and five masses of four parts, besides hymns, antiphons, and divers songs for the use of the church. This request was granted conditionally on his paying to the university twenty pence on the day of his admission, and he was forthwith licensed to proceed. He was presented by the king to the provostship or rectory sine curd of Clynog fawr upon the death of Dr. William Glyn. Bishop John Capon, who was consecrated 19 April 1534, would not admit him, but instituted Gregory Williamson, a kinsman of Thomas Cromwell, 1st Earl of Essex, to the living. Gwynneth brought his tjuare impedit against the Bishop of Bangor in July 1541, and during the vacancy of the see by the translation of John Bird to Chester he got himself instituted to Clynog in October 1541 by the commissary of the Archbishop of Canterbury. After this there was a great controversy between Gwynneth and Bishop Bulkley in the Star-chamber, and in 1543 Gwynneth obtained judgment in his favour on the quare impedit. He appears to have resigned the living shortly afterwards, as on 19 September 1543 he was admitted to the rectory of St. Peter, Westcheap, in the city of London, which he resigned before 19 November 1556. In 1554 he was vicar of Luton, Bedfordshire. Probably he died before the end of Queen Mary's reign."

After several months and efforts by American pro-life groups, Joseph was transferred to a Catholic hospital in St. Louis, Missouri, where the procedure was performed. The successfully-obtained procedure extended Joseph's life for several months. Joseph died on Tuesday, September 27, 2011 at his home."

  "text" : "John Anderson (born 28 November 1931 in Glasgow, Scotland) is a British television personality best known as referee and official trainer on the UK TV show Gladiators. He has previously worked as a teacher and as a coach for Commonwealth Games and Olympic Games athletes, including Commonwealth Games champion and former World Record Holder Dave Moorcroft, three-time Olympic heptathlete Judy Simpson (nee Livermore, known as Nightshade on Gladiators), double Olympian Sheila Carey, 2:09 marathoner John Graham, Liz McColgan - who won silver at the 1988 Olympic Games in Seoul, Glasgow’s Lynne MacDougall - who ran in the Olympic 1500m Final in Los Angeles 1984, 1972 Olympic silver medalist (4x400m) David Jenkins, and David Wilson - who took part in the 1972 Olympics as a sprint hurdler. Anderson had a successful career long before his athletics and TV fame. Plaudits included representing Scotland as a schoolboy footballer, becoming the first home Scot to gain the prestigious Full FA Coaching Certificate (then only four were awarded per year), being one of only two confirmed recipients (along with Wilf Paish) of every British Senior Coaching award available, and founding Maryhill Ladies AC in Glasgow. John's best-known coaching success was with Dave Moorcroft. The partnership started in 1966. It was a coach-athlete relationship which would lead to a world record for 5000m in 1982 and even a vets world record for the Mile of 4:02 a decade later, in 1993. John was National Coach for the Amateur Athletics Association of England and subsequently the first full time National Coach in Scotland (1965-1970). He was coach to an Olympian at every Olympics from 1964 to 2000 and has coached five world record holders and an estimated 170 GB Internationals in every Track and Field event. In 2008, Anderson briefly reprised his role as referee on the newly revived Gladiators before leaving and being replaced by John Coyle after just one series. The series was subsequently not renewed any further. John occasionally appears in cameo roles as a referee, including guest appearances on two episodes of 2016's Top Gear (UK) with Chris Evans and Matt LeBlanc, and as an ident-voiceover for Sky's Challenge TV. After his television career in the 1990s John went on to become a mentor and coach for a number of recent international athletes, including Great British athlete William Sharman, whom he helped transform from a decathlete to a world class sprint hurdler, and continues to coach on a small scale."

He was licensed to preach as a minister of the Scottish kirk and had a charge at Ochiltree in 1614. He was cited to appear before the high commission court at Glasgow in March 1620, and refusing to submit to its jurisdiction was suspended, and sentenced to be imprisoned in Perth. By the influence, however, of his friends, Robert Boyd of Trochrig, and John Chalmers, the court was induced to permit his return to Ochiltree under certain restrictions.

  "text" : "John Cantine (October 20, 1735 – April 30, 1808) Born in Marbletown, New York, Cantine served in both houses of the New York Legislature. Cantine also served in the New York state convention concerning the ratification of the United States Constitution. In 1801, Cantine was elected to the United States House of Representatives, for the New York Seventh Congressional District, but declined to take the office. His son was Moses I. Cantine. JOHN CANTINE Johannis (John) Cantine was born in Marbletown, New York Oct. 20. In 1760, as a Lieut., John Cantine was a member of the 2nd Regiment Ulster Co. New York Provincial Troops during the French and Indian War. He signed the Articles of Association in 1775 and belonged to the Committee of Safety with his brother Matthew in 1777. In 1775 John Cantine was found on the rolls of the Third NY Regiment, Continental Line with Col. James Clinton, being listed as a Captain. This regiment, known also as the \"Ulster Regiment,\" or \"3rd Yorkers,\" was one of the four regiments raised by the Province of New York in the early summer of 1775, for the Continental service. These four New York regiments were brigaded under Brigadier General Montgomery and were with him in all his movements, ending in the assault of Quebec. At the Battle of Saratoga, at Bemis heights. John Cantine had risen to the rank of Major in Graham's Dutchess/Ulster Co. NY regt. With Glover's brigade from Massachusetts. He was made Commander of the 3rd Ulster County of Militia in 1778 by Gov. George Clinton. He provided valuable information to George Washington about the movements of Tories and Indians in the New York frontier while Washington was planning the Sullivan/Clinton Campaign. General Washington spoke of John Cantine in a letter he wrote to Gen. Philip Cortlandt, specifying a list of intelligence to seek from John: “Dear Sir: In October last, his Excellency Governor Clinton informed me, that a Colonel Cantine, who I believe lives somewhere in the neighbourhood of Rochester, was remarkably well acquainted with the Country between the North River and the Susquehanna, and of the most practicable Routes from the one to the other. If he is within your reach, be pleased to make the following enquiries: What is the nearest distance from the North River to Anaquaga and to Tioga upon the Susquehanna; Whether there are any Roads already made, and of what kinds they are, if none, Whether the Face of the Country is such, that Roads can easily be made? Whether in the nearest Route from the North River to Tioga, you do not go thro' or very near Anaquaga, or if that should be somewhat out of the way, how far? Whether the face of the Country, upon the shortest Route from the North River to the above places is the best adapted to make good Roads. Because a Route, tho' somewhat more distant, if the Roads were better, would be preferable to the nearest thro' difficult ways.” Subsequently, on May 3, 1779, at his headquarters at Middle Brook, George Washington again spoke of John Cantine in a letter he wrote to Gov. Clinton: \"Dear Sir: I am honored with your favor of the 25th of last month. The readiness with which you comply with all my requests, in prosecution of the Public service has a claim to my warmest acknowledgements. I am glad to hear of the measures the state has taken for raising a thousand men, and of your expectation that the number would be soon completed. I hope the intelligence from Col. Cantine will not materially retard the progress of a business on which the general security of the frontier so much depends.” John Cantine was a surveyor by trade and was one of the three \"Chemung Commissioners\" whose job it was to survey and lay out lands that were claimed in western New York after the Revolutionary War. A grant of land consisting of 3,200 acres was given to him in the present town of Caroline, New York for his work during the Revolution and as a Commissioner. John was a delegate to the convention for the adoption of the Constitution. He was an Anti-Federalist in his politics and voted against the ratification of the Constitution. He was a State Assemblyman from 1780 to 1798 and was a member of the first State Assembly that met in Kingston Sept 1777. He served as State Senator from 1790 to 1797 and was elected to Congress in 1801 during the administration of Thomas Jefferson. However, he was stricken with paralysis on his way to Philadelphia and was replaced by Josiah Hasbrouck. He negotiated treaties with the Cayuga and Onadaga Indians. In 1804 he was elected high Sheriff of Tioga County. John Cantine died April 30th, 1808."

In 1567, he is recorded as court painter of Mary Queen of Scots, although it is not clear if he had actually accompanied her to Scotland. In 1572, he succeeded François Clouet as painter to the king at the court of her brother-in-law Charles IX of France, and was in turn succeeded by his son, Charles de Court, in 1584 or 1589. Jean de Court painted in 1574 a portrait of Henry III, then Duke of Anjou. Noted enamel painter Susanne (de) Court was also most likely a member of this de Court dynasty of enamel painters who ran a workshop over several generations in Limoges. The scenes she painted were often copied from Italian prints. Work by Susanne de Court is characterized by varying tones of blues and greens with white flesh tints, and by a delicate painterly technique. Her work is in the collections of the British Museum, the Frick Collection, the Princeton University Art Museum, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, and the Walters Art Museum, Baltimore."

  "text" : "John Evans (born about 1678) was a colonial governor of Pennsylvania, 3 February 1704 through 1 February 1709. He was of Welsh origin, and in February 1704, became deputy governor of the province, under the proprietor, William Penn. He was not a Quaker, and was doubtless selected out of deference to the court party, who did not believe in the peace principles of that sect. His administration was marked by quarrels with the assembly, and especially with the speaker of the house, David Lloyd, who headed the popular party. Disregarding the convictions of the Quakers, Evans, for the first time in the history of the colony, made a public call for troops, with the desire of assisting the other colonies against the French and Indians. The call met with no response, whereupon the governor, resorting to a discreditable ruse, arranged to have a messenger ride into Philadelphia on the day of the annual fair, announcing, with apparent consternation, that the French had arrived in the Delaware and were marching on the city. Evans then rode through the street with drawn sword, entreating the people to arm, and for a time great excitement prevailed. Valuables were hastily thrown into wells, and many people fled to the forests; but the Quakers, on whom Evans had wished to make an impression, continued quietly at their devotions, as it was the day for their \"weekly meeting.\" The governor also built a fort at Newcastle, and unlawfully demanded tribute of all vessels passing up the river. One of his tax enforcers was captured by a ship he had been trying to tax and carried off to the Jersey side of the river where a furious Lord Cornbury (who had charter rights to regulate commerce on the river) upbraided him, whereupon Evans gave up on his tax. Evans had a good deal of learning and refinement, but his habits were unsuited to the Quaker City. Watson, in his \"Annals of Philadelphia,\" says that in 1702 \"Solomon Cresson, going his round at night, entered a tavern to suppress a riotous assembly, and found there John Evans, Esq., the governor, who fell to beating Cresson.\" Evans was finally recalled in February 1709, and was succeeded by Colonel Charles Gookin. On 28 August 1709, he married Rebecca Moore in Philadelphia. After surrendering his office to Gookin, he remained for a time in Philadelphia but at length retired to Denbigh, Wales."

  "text" : "James Byrne is a British poet, translator and Editor of The Wolf magazine. He was born in Buckinghamshire in 1977. His most recent poetry collections include Everything Broken Up Dances, published by Tupelo Press in the United States and White Coins, both in 2015. Other published collections include Blood/Sugar by Arc Publications in 2009, He has also published pamphlets, including SOAPBOXES  and Myth of the Savage Tribes, Myth of Civilised Nations, a collaborative work with the poet Sandeep Parmar. For many years James has been consistently talked of as 'one of the leading poets of his generation', endorsed by The Times as one of the 'ten rising stars of British poetry' in April 2009. He lives in England after two years in New York City, where he received a Stein scholarship and an MFA from New York University. He was the Poet in Residence at Clare Hall, University of Cambridge from 2011-2012 and is a Lecturer at Edge Hill University where he teaches poetry. In 2008, James won the Treci Trg poetry festival prize in Serbia. In 2009 his New and Selected Poems: The Vanishing House was published by Treci Trg (in a bilingual edition) in Belgrade. He is the editor of The Wolf: A Decade (Poems 2002-2012) and is the co-editor of Voice Recognition: 21 Poets for the 21st Century, an anthology of British poets, under 35, published by Bloodaxe in 2009. Since becoming sole editor of The Wolf in April 2006, James has broadened the international reach of the magazine and this has affected some of his editorial work. In June 2012, Bones Will Crow: 15 Contemporary Burmese Poets was co-edited and co-translated by James Byrne and ko ko thett and is widely recognised as the first anthology of contemporary Burmese poetry available in the West. James's own poems have been translated into several languages, including Arabic, Burmese, Chinese, Slovenian, Serbian and French. In 2009 he was invited by the British Council in Damascus to participate in the Al-Sendian arts festival in Syria. In 2012 he read his work at the inaugural Tripoli Poetry Festival in Libya and in 2013 he opened the Irrawaddy Literature Festival in Yangon, Burma. His work has been recommended by the Poetry Book Society (SOAPBOXES) and he won Tupelo's July Open Reading Competition in 2013 in the U.S. making him one of the first poets of his generation with a developed transatlantic profile. Of Everything Broken Up Dances the American poet and translator Forrest Gander said: \"Reading James Byrne is like gulping firewater shots of the world. The variety of poetic forms and lineations— in couplets, prose poems, anaphoric lists, singular lyrics, and sequences— acts out the author’s insistent concern for diversity, for internationality. The extraordinary and deftly employed lexicon derives from everywhere.\" The poet John Kinsella wrote on the jacket for Blood/Sugar: ‘James Byrne is a phenomenon and Blood/Sugar is astonishing. Byrne has a razor-sharp wit, an acute intellect and a superb facility with language. The poetry he writes is both culturally and intellectually ‘learned’, but also rhetorically and lyrically confident. He is a complete original.’ His partner is Sandeep Parmar, also a poet, modernist scholar and Reviews Editor for The Wolf."

He also ran a large protection racket from the West Belfast Shankill Road area, where he lived. Described by journalist David McKittrick as \"Belfast's foremost paramilitary extortionist\", Craig allegedly colluded with republican organisations such as the Provisional Irish Republican Army (PIRA) and Irish National Liberation Army (INLA), providing them with information on key loyalists which led to their assassinations. Aside from controlling rackets and extorting protection money from a variety of businesses, it was claimed that Craig also participated in killings. He was accused by the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF) of setting up the assassinations of some of their key members by IRA hit squads, such as Shankill Butcher Lenny Murphy, John Bingham, and William \"Frenchie\" Marchant in the 1980s. Craig was killed by the UDA, using their cover name of the Ulster Freedom Fighters (UFF), for alleged \"treason\" as it was believed he had passed information to the IRA regarding South Belfast UDA brigadier John McMichael, who was blown up in an IRA booby-trap car bomb in December 1987. Craig was shot dead in The Castle Inn, a pub in Beersbridge Road, East Belfast. An elderly pensioner was also killed by stray gunfire."

The following years he fought in Normandy, Avignon and the Languedoc. In 1352 he was sent to Flanders to negotiate a truce with the English. After the signing of the truce he was made governor of Poitou, Saintonge, Angoumois, Périgord and Limousin (1354). In 1356, de Clermont advised King John II of France not to engage the English in battle but to surround them and starve them. His advice ignored, King John II decided to engage the English at Nouaillé-Maupertuis, south of Poitiers. De Clermont was killed during the battle which ended in a military disaster for the French, and the capture of the King."

  "text" : "Jacques Isnardon (15 February 1860 - 14 November 1930) was a French bass-baritone, writer and voice teacher. After winning a competition at the Paris Conservatory, he made his debut as Baxter in Émile Paladilhe's Diane at the Opéra-Comique in 1885, before moving to Brussels and the Théâtre Royal de la Monnaie, whose history he chronicled. He sang in Die Meistersinger at Covent Garden, Manon at La Scala and Le médecin malgré lui at Monte Carlo before returning to the Opéra-Comique in 1894. His Le Chant Théâtral is as much a memoir of his times as a philosophy of vocal pedagogy: \"Herein is but one method: the new method for each pupil\". He sang in the world premieres of Jocelyn and Le chevalier d'Harmental; other roles included Mozart's Bartolo and Rossini's Basilio; Puccini's Colline and Leoncavallo's Schaunard; Masetto, Lescaut, Enrico & at various times 5 roles (Mercutio, Paris, Gregorio, Laurent and the Duke) from Roméo et Juliette."

  "text" : "Jakob Finci was born to a Sepharadi family on 1 October 1943 in Rab concentration camp. He is a prominent Bosnian Jew, former Ambassador, and the current President of the Jewish Community of Bosnia and Herzegovina. He is also the President of the Jewish cultural and humanitarian society \"La Benevolencija\". A lawyer by training, Jakob Finci became member of the Presidency of the Jewish Community in Sarajevo in 1990, and in this capacity worked on humanitarian activities during the war in Sarajevo. In August 1995, Jakob Finci was elected President of the Jewish Community of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Jakob Finci is a founding member - and current president - of the Inter-Religious Council of Bosnia and Herzegovina, which was established in 1997. Its membership reflects the country’s Islamic, Christian, and Jewish communities. Finci was also President of the Constitutional Commission of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Director of the Civil Service Agency of Bosnia and Herzegovina, as well as Ambassador to Switzerland and non-resident Ambassador to the Principality of Liechtenstein. As a respected public figure, Finci was elected in 2000 to chair the national committee charged with the establishment of a truth and reconciliation commission. Two years later, he was appointed Director of the Civil Service Agency of Bosnia and Herzegovina. However, his political ambitions were thwarted when he learned that, being Jewish, he was unable to run for president. Under the Dayton peace agreement that ended the war in Bosnia on 14 December 1995, membership to the parliament’s upper house or presidency is reserved for one of the three ethnic groups: Bosnian Muslims, Croats and Serbs. Minorities, or “others” outside these constituent groups, such as Jews and Roma, can be Members of Parliament, but may not stand for higher political office. Jakob Finci and Dervo Sejdić, a prominent Bosnian Roma and member of Bosnia's Roma Council, appealed to the European Court of Human Rights, arguing that Bosnia's Constitution violates the European Convention on Human Rights.The judgement was handed down in their favor in September 2009. The Court found that certain provisions of the Bosnian constitution and election law discriminate against minority groups. However, six years after the ruling, the judgement has not been implemented yet by Bosnia and Herzegovina. See Sejdić and Finci v. Bosnia and Herzegovina. Finci frequently lectures on different topics, such as international commercial law, privatization, conflict resolution, interethnic coexistence, as well as about matters as the organization of humanitarian work, fund raising, Judaism, etc. For his work, Jakob Finci has been decorated several times. These honors include: the Grand Cross of the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany as well as the American decoration First American Freedom in Richmond Virginia. He has also been named Chevalier de la Légion d’Honneur of the French Republic, and in 2009. he was proclaimed “Person of the Year” by Sarajevo’s daily newspaper SAN, and Man of the Year for 2013 by Bosnian daily “Večernji list”. Jakob Finci received International Prize Primo Levi in 2013 in Genoa – Italy,"

  "text" : "Julian Borchardt (1868–1932) was a socialist activist and participant in the Zimmerwald Left. Borchardt was born in Bromberg, Prussia in 1868. He became a socialist journalist and writer, serving as editor on Social Democrat newspapers from 1901 to 1906. He was appointed as a lecturer to the SPD central education committee in 1907 and entered the Prussian diet in 1911. In 1913 he relinquished these posts and started editing Lichtstrahlen, which provided a platform for German and international left anti-war-opposition and texts of the nascent Communist movement towards the end of the First World War and after. However he never joined the Communist party. He also wrote on historical and economic subjects including a widely translated digest of Karl Marx's Das Kapital. He was a member of the Association of Proletarian-Revolutionary Authors. From 1927 until his death in Berlin, 1932, he was working on a history of Germany which was never completed. His manuscript of this is in the International Institute of Social History."

  "text" : "Jack Carter Richardson (February 18, 1934 – July 1, 2012) was an American writer born in Manhattan, N.Y. although his birthplace has been erroneously reported elsewhere as \"Bristol, VA\". He was known for his existentialist dramas of the early 1960s. Raised in the Jackson Heights section of Queens, New York City, Richardson later served in the Counter Intelligence Corps (CIC) in the United States Army during the Korean War. He then earned a bachelor's degree in philosophy from Columbia University, and studied at the University of Munich. In 1960, his first play, The Prodigal, a retelling of the story of Orestes, was produced Off-Broadway to critical acclaim, winning an Obie Award and a Drama Desk Award. Gallows Humor, a 1961 combination of two short plays, was also well received. Richardson's next two plays, Lorenzo (1963) and Xmas in Las Vegas (1965), were produced on Broadway, but were critical and commercial failures. From the 1960s, Richardson wrote dramatic criticism and essays for The New York Times, New York Review of Books, Esquire, and Commentary, as well as two novels: The Prison Life of Harris Filmore (1965) and Memoir of a Gambler (1980). Richardson married author Anne Roth (now Anne Roiphe) in 1957, and they had a daughter Emily Carter. The couple later divorced. Richardson's second wife was Judith Heidler (later Judith Silvia). They also divorced. She went on to become executive director of the Newport Art Association and Museum and later a consultant to Green Collections in Yokohama, Japan, and is listed in Who's Who in American Art. Richardson married one last time to Susan E. Morse, an Academy Award-nominated feature film editor best known for her work with Woody Allen. and, in 2012, for her editing of the popular FX Network show, \"Louie,\" written and directed by and starring Louis C.K., for which Morse was nominated for an Emmy. Richardson's third marriage produced his only son, Dwight, and lasted until Richardson's death in Manhattan in July 2012."

He was born at Chard, Somerset and died at Weston-super-Mare, also in Somerset. Priddy was a lower-order batsman and a bowler, though neither his batting style nor his bowling style are known. He made his debut in the 1933 match against the West Indians and recorded his best bowling figures, two for 114, in the tourists' single innings, in which they scored 482 for six wickets before declaring. He also made an unbeaten 20 out of a last wicket stand of 69 with Wally Luckes to save the match, the ninth wicket having fallen when Somerset were just 44 runs ahead. Priddy played in one other first-class match in 1933 without success, and then disappeared from first-class cricket for five seasons. He reappeared in five matches in the 1939 season, but took only one wicket in them. He did, however, improve his highest score: in the match against Essex, batting at No 4, he made 27 in the first innings. In a notice following his death in 1994 in the London Gazette, he was described as a retired company director, living at 11A Cecil Road, Weston-super-Mare."

  "text" : "Charles George James Burge, Q.C. (8 October 1906 – 6 September 1990 in London, England) was an English criminal law barrister, most noted for his defence of Stephen Ward in the controversial Profumo Affair in 1963. He is also remembered as John Mortimer's original inspiration for the fictional barrister Rumpole of the Bailey. Burge was educated at Christ's College, Cambridge, as an undergraduate commoner. Ward was prosecuted for living on earnings from prostitution. He was defended by Burge, who, known as a mercurial Old Bailey junior, never quite recovered from the professional consequences of defending him in the scandal. Ward took an overdose of sleeping tablets near the end of the trial, he was found guilty of some charges in his absence, but died without regaining consciousness. It was Burge to whom Mandy Rice-Davies made her famous reply \"He would, wouldn't he.\" Author and fellow barrister John Mortimer stated on several occasions that there were elements of Burge, especially Burge’s independence and total dedication to often unprepossessing clients, that he incorporated into the famous fictional character Rumpole of the Bailey. Mortimer's 2009 obituary in The Daily Telegraph confirmed that Rumpole was, in part, based on a chance meeting in court with James Burge: In the early 1970s Mortimer was appearing for some football hooligans when James Burge, with whom he was sharing the defence, told him: \"I’m really an anarchist at heart, but I don’t think even my darling old Prince Peter Kropotkin would have approved of this lot.\" \"And there,\" Mortimer realised, \"I had Rumpole.\" Burge practiced in the chambers of RE Seaton, QC, an established \"criminal set\" in Queen Elizabeth Building, Temple, London. He died at age 83, on 6 September 1990 and was cremated in Xàbia, Spain."

  "text" : "Jean Krier (2 January 1949 – 12 January 2013) was a Luxembourg poet who in 2011 was awarded both the Adelbert von Chamisso Prize for the best work by a non-German author and the Servais Prize for the best literary work written by a Luxembourger. In both cases, the work in question was Herzens Lust Spiele (2010). In connection with the Chamisso prize, the jury commented on how the work provided an original and impressive enrichment of German-language poetry. \"His carpets of German, subtly interspersed with sprinkles of French, are fed by experiential elements and reading experiences\". Krier was born in Luxembourg City, studied German and English literature in Freiburg, and lived and worked in Luxembourg. He contributed poems to German-language publications such as NDL (NeueDeutscheLyriker), Manuskripte: Zeitschrift für Literatur, Akzente: Zeitschrift für Dichtung, Das Gedicht: Zeitschrift für Lyrik, Essay und Kritik and Poet-magazin."

He had been on North Melbourne's supplementary list that season and was almost drafted by the club in the 1996 pre-season but they went for Peter Bell at the last minute. Traianidis was instead signed by St Kilda and after taking part in their Ansett Cup premiership, played 13 AFL games in 1996. A half forward, he kicked two goals on debut and was goal-less in his second game despite scoring five behinds. He suffered a back injury in 1997 which kept him on the sidelines for much of the year but got to play in St Kilda's qualifying final win over the Brisbane Lions. In 1999 he started the season brightly but missed the second half of the year as he needed a knee reconstruction. He was tried as a defender in 2000 and averaged 16 disposals a game. In the penultimate round of the 2001 season, Traianidis was reported for striking Brett Kirk and after receiving a one match ban announced his retirement. He would return to Shepparton and continue to play country football until 2010. In his final season, playing for Shepparton East in the Picola & District Football League, he kicked eight goals in the winning grand final team."

She developed the paper into a chain of 14 papers, including Lawyers Weekly USA, which has national distribution. The papers were sold to Dolan Media in 2004 for an undisclosed sum, estimated to be over $10 million. In 1998 Pawlick launched the conservative Massachusetts News, first as a website and then also as a hardcopy newspaper. He used the newspaper to express his right-wing philosophy. For several years, it was distributed free of charge monthly to a targeted audience in Massachusetts and surrounding areas. It gained popularity amongst conservatives for its exposés on state corruption, the perceived inequities of the state probate court, as well as anti-abortion and anti-gay causes. At the same time, Pawlick was producing and distributing pamphlets promoting his philosophy, with particular emphasis on his opposition to gay and lesbian rights."

  "text" : "Joseph Rumshinsky (1881–1956), Jewish composer born near Vilna in Lithuania (then part of Russian Poland). Rumshinsky—with Sholom Secunda, Alexander Olshanetsky, and Abraham Ellstein—is considered one of the \"big four\" of American Yiddish theater. His mother taught singing to local singers and badkhonim (wedding entertainers). Rumshinsky was sent as a child to study with a chazn. At the age of eight he was called \"Yoshke der notn-freser\" (a fresser is somebody who gobbles voraciously) at the music school where he studied piano. He traveled until 1894 with various Hazzans. It was in Grodno that he first saw Yiddish theater (Abraham Goldfaden's operetta Shulamis); he then joined the chorus of Kaminska's traveling troup until his voice changed in 1896, at which point he became choir director for a chazn named Rabinovitch. His first composition was a piano waltz which became very popular in Vilna, where it was published. In 1897 he became choir director for Borisov's Russian opera/operetta; in 1888 he conducted a full production of Goldfaden's Bar Kokhba. In 1899, in Lódz, he was hired as conductor of the new Hazomir Choral Society, studying and arranging folksongs as well as Haydn, Handel, and Mendelsohn oratorios. He studied with the Polish musician Henryk Meltzer and at the Warsaw Conservatory. In 1903 he left for London to avoid conscription in the czar's army. In London he met the New Yorker Charles Tsunzer (Charles Zunser, the son of the folk bard Eliakum Zunser), who convinced him to emigrate to the United States in 1904. Blocked by the union from working in the theater, he taught piano and wrote compositions including a funeral march commemorating the Kishinev pogrom. 1905-1906 he was director at Boston's Hope Theater. He married the actress Sabiba Laksher (Sabrina Laxer) - their son Maury was a pianist and composer as well. He then returned to New York, where he was still unable to work in theater. He was finally hired, in 1907, as director at Brooklyn's Lyric Theater, and a year later was taken on as conductor and comoposer at the Windsor Theater thanks to dramatic actor Jacob Adler. Sholem Perlmutter wrote: When Rumshinsky arrived in America the musical world looked at him as a stranger. The musicians \"club,\" which at that time ruled over the yiddish theater with iron might, treated him like an unwanted guest and barred his way. The only one to take him seriously was Jacob P. Adler, who instinctively felt Rumshinsky had originality within him ... it was thanks to Adler that Rumshinsky got the chance to show his musical art and ability. In 1912 Boaz Young (husband of famous actress Clara Young) wrote that when Rumshinsky/Shor's Di Amerikanerin - Dos Meydl fun der vest (The American girl - the maiden from the west) played in Warsaw, \"Rumshinsky's music was so successful that not only Jews but also Poles sang it. It was sung in all the cabarets.\" In New York he worked as a composer and director at Malvina Lobel's Royal Theater, from 1913 to 1914, and at Joseph Edelstein's Peoples Theater, from 1914 to 1916. At the time, many American Yiddish productions were deemed shund (trash) \"that encompassed a world of cheap pulp fiction, common periodicals, and other coarse diversions.\" Rumshinsky tried to steer Yiddish musical entertainment away from what he called \"elevated vaudeville\" toward his own vision of a new American genre of Yiddish light operetta. In 1916 he joined with Boris Thomashefsky and worked as composer and conductor at the National Theater, scoring comedies and melodramas. His Tsubrokhene fidl (Broken Fiddle) boasted a full-sized dance corps and a full pit orchestra with two dozen musicians (most productions had previously used a small dance band or wedding band). (When he first added harp, oboe, and bassoon to his orchestrations, actors called him \"crazy Wagner.\") In 1919 he moved to the Kessler Second Avenue Theater in the Yiddish Theater District. In 1923 Rumshinsky introduced Molly Picon to Second Avenue in a production of Yankele. Molly Picon, her husband Jacob (Yankl) Kalich, and Rumshinsky were called \"the Three Musketeers of the East Side\" in a 1931 New York Times article. Rumshinsky wrote many dozens of shows over the course of four decades. Beginning in the 1930s, he also worked in radio, becoming music director of the only Yiddish program broadcast on a nationwide network, The Jewish Hour, sponsored by the Yiddish daily newspaper Der Tog. He worked from 1946–49 at Maurice Schwartz's Yiddish Art Theater, scoring Hershele ostropoler, Isaac Leib Peretz's Dray matones, and Sholem Aleichem's Blondzhende shtern. In 1940 he collected his writings, published in The Forward, adding new articles and memoirs, and published them in Tog as Epizodn fun mayn lebn (Episodes from My life). The collection was published in book form in 1944 under the title Klangen fun mayn lebn. Rumshinsky also composed liturgical pieces. In 1926 he conducted the more than 100-voice chorus of the Jewish Ministers Cantors Association (the Hazzanim Farband Chor) in his biblically-based cantata, Oz yashir. In the 1940s Rumshinsky completed an opera in Hebrew, Ruth, which has not been performed or recorded to this day. His final show, Wedding March, was in the midst of its run at the time of his death."

Tobin established a wholesale and retail firm there. During his time in the assembly, he supported funding for Catholic schools in Nova Scotia. Tobin was defeated when he ran for a seat in the House of Commons in 1867 as a pro-Confederation candidate. He died in Halifax, apparently by suicide although the coroner's report was worded somewhat ambiguously. He was buried in Holy Cross Cemetery in Halifax."

CBS hired her in 1974 to provide commentary for various televised sports events. During the CBS National Football League telecast of a game on October 13, 1974, she became the first female NFL announcer, brought in as a commentator alongside Don Criqui and Irv Cross. She was used on occasional NFL broadcasts the rest of the 1974 season and also worked the college Sun Bowl Game that season. She also worked some CBS National Basketball Association telecasts. During the 1980s, Chastain began turning her attention toward politics. She hosted a radio program, What Washington Doesn't Want You to Know, as well as served on a number of boards and commissions. She now lives in California, and writes for conservative-leaning online publications such as WorldNetDaily, and has written several books about politics. She is married to her husband John."

  "text" : "Jacques Barbeu-Dubourg (12 February 1709, Mayenne – 14 December 1779, Paris) was a French physician, botanist, writer, translator and publisher known for translating Benjamin Franklin's work into French and for inventing a gentlemen's umbrella fitted with a lightning conductor. He designed a method of histographic visualizations which he called the Carte chronographique. He first embarked on theological studies, but abandoned this to devote his life to science. He studied medicine in Paris and obtained a doctorate in 1748. He was a keen follower of the work of Benjamin Franklin, and they maintained a regular friendly correspondence. He translated some of Franklin's early experimental work into French in 1762 and published it in Gazette d'Epidaure, his medical journal. He went on to publish his French translation of Franklin's Observations and Experiments in 1773. Barbeu-Dubourg's \"umbrella-lightning rod\", an umbrella fitted with a tall spike and trailing chain, was designed to give the same protection for gentlemen as was sought by ladies of the time who wore lightning conductors on their hats. Barbeu-Dubourg was a member of the Royal Society of Medicine in Paris, the Medical Society of London and the American Philosophical Society of Philadelphia. He wrote numerous books and papers, including: \n* Chronographie, ou Description des tems, contenant toute la suite des souverains de l'univers et des principaux événements de chaque siècle... (Paris, 1753), one of the most ambitious of the chronographic charts produced during that period. The chart was 54 feet long, and mounted on an apparatus with scrolls and cranks to allow the reader to move freely through world history, a device which Barbeu-Dubourg called a \"chronographic machine\". \n* Gazette d'Épidaure, ou Recueil de nouvelles de médecine avec des réflexions pour simplifier la théorie et éclairer la pratique (Paris, 1762) \n* ''Le Botaniste françois, comprenant toutes les plantes communes et usuelles... (two volumes, Paris, 1767) \n* Petit Code de la raison humaine, ou Exposition succincte de ce que la raison dicte à tous les hommes pour éclairer leur conduite et assurer leur bonheur (Paris, 1789) During the American Revolution the French government appointed Barbeu-Dubourg to act as secret intermediary to offer support to the Americans, but he was soon deemed unsuitable for the task and replaced by Beaumarchais. As Streeter Bass recounts, \"He was too old, he lacked business acumen, and – more serious in a venture of this nature – he was insecure and garrulous.\" Barbeu-Dubourg wrote the article ″Chronologique″ for the Encyclopédie of Denis Diderot and Jean le Rond d'Alembert. He died in 1779 in Paris and his ashes were buried in the chapel of Saint-Symphorien church in Saint-Germain-des-Prés."

  "text" : "Saint Juan Diego Cuauhtlatoatzin, also known as Juan Diegotzil (1474–1548), a native of Mexico, is the first Roman Catholic indigenous saint from the Americas. He is said to have been granted an apparition of the Virgin Mary on four separate occasions in December 1531 at the hill of Tepeyac, then outside but now well within metropolitan Mexico City. The Basilica of Guadalupe, located at the foot of the hill of Tepeyac, claims to possess Juan Diego's mantle or cloak (known as a tilma) on which an image of the Virgin is said to have been impressed by a miracle as a pledge of the authenticity of the apparitions. These apparitions and the imparting of the miraculous image (together known as the Guadalupe event, in Spanish \"el acontecimiento Guadalupano\") are the basis of the cult of Our Lady of Guadalupe, which is ubiquitous in Mexico, prevalent throughout the Spanish-speaking Americas, and increasingly widespread beyond. As a result, the Basilica of Guadalupe is now the world's major centre of pilgrimage for Roman Catholics, receiving 22 million visitors in 2010. Juan Diego was beatified in 1990 and canonized in 2002."

  "text" : "James \"Tootie\" Hogan (Born April 16, 1956) is a professional jazz and R&B Guitarist. He was born in New Haven, Connecticut, but at a very tender age moved south with his family to Mount Holly, North Carolina. He discovered his gift for music, through the influence and direction of his father, James Hogan, Sr, whose passion and position was planted in gospel music as both a singer and guitarist. Tootie's talents were nurtured in the church under his Father's direction. He learned to play the piano and bass guitar but his passion and power would be found when he began to play the lead guitar. Hogan's talents found a spotlight as a lead guitarist, a position that would prove to shape the solid musical foundation of his career. During the 70's and early 80's Hogan performed and traveled extensively with various well-known national musicians, such as: The Drifters, The Tams, the Cornelius Brothers & Sister Rose, The Chairmen of the Board (featuring General Norman Johnson), Junior Walker & the All-Stars, Hank Crawford, Eddie Floyd and Maurice Williams and the Zodiacs. Hogan has also toured worldwide with Roberta Flack, mainly in Japan, the Philippines, Australia, Spain, England, Canada and the Bahamas. While working with Roberta, Hogan also appeared on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson; opened for jazz trumpet player Miles Davis in the Madison Square Garden in New York City, and shared the stage with The Spinners, Lou Rawls, Little Richard, Clarence Carter, the Platters, Major Lance, the Coasters, Lynn White, Joe Tex, Mary Wells, Martha & the Vandellas, and Betty Wright. Hogan has opened for vocalist Lenny Williams & comedian Tyler Craig in Spartanburg, SC and for national recording artist Fatburger on June 20, 1998, Norman Conners, Angela Bofill, & Marion Meadows. He also performed with sax player Gene Walker at the Toledo School for the Arts Clinic as well as in Myrtle beach, SC, with The Tams on the show with the Bar-Kays & Eddie Money, Black Family Expo in Charlotte, NC, Columbus, Ohio, Knoxville, TN and beyond. Hogan has shared the stage with Frankie Valli & the Four Seasons, Mother's Finest, Tyrone Davis, Williams Bell, Candi Staton, Archie Bell & the Drells. Later he became the music director & lead guitarist for A Good Man is Hard to Find; a national gospel play. Hogan has released three albums, one of which was called \"Dreamin'at Midday\" on Depriest Records. It received excellent reviews and exposure on one of the nationally known jazz radio stations throughout the USA. On February 15, 1997 Tootie opened up for Reverend Jesse Jackson celebration of the 37th anniversary of the \"sit-in movement\" in Greensboro, NC. The release of the second album written and arranged by Tootie was called \"Last Flight Out\". Hogan's third & latest CD is \"Final Destination\". Today Hogan performs with his own four-piece band, which is composed of drums, bass guitar, keyboards and himself on lead guitar. Hogan admits to being a little showy when he’s playing, \"I’ve been known to be an entertainer. It’s all showmanship. I play contemporary jazz and blues, a hip-hop, funk jazz. I play with my teeth, behind my back. That’s what it takes to make it in the business.\" Charlotte, NC based video production company Episode XI Studios is working on a documentary about Tootie's life."

Descended from high-ranking Bulgarian nobility, John was a brother of both Tsar Ivan Alexander of Bulgaria and Helena of Bulgaria, the wife of Tsar Stephen Dušan of Serbia. Perhaps in search of better opportunities, he emigrated to Serbia, where his sister was married. There, he was granted the title of despot by Stephen Dušan, who placed him in charge of his territories in modern south Albania. As the despot of Valona, John established commercial ties with Venice and Ragusa, and he became a citizen of the former in 1353. After the death of Dušan in 1355, he took the side of the unsuccessful Simeon Uroš in the ensuing conflict for the Serbian throne. With Venetian assistance, John maintained the essentially independent status of the Principality of Valona. He probably died of the plague in 1363 and he was succeeded by Alexander Komnenos Asen, who was likely his son from his unknown first wife. John's second marriage was to the former Epirote queen-consort Anna Palaiologina."

  "text" : "James E. Murdoch (January 25, 1811 – May 19, 1893) was an American actor and elocutionist. James Edward Murdoch (sometimes spelled \"Murdock\") was born in Philadelphia, the eldest of four sons of Thomas and Elizabeth Murdoch. James apprenticed under his father in the business of bookbinding. He served as a volunteer fireman with the Vigilant Company. In 1829, he made his first dramatic appearance as Frederick in Kotzebue's play Lover's Vows. He had his first lead role in 1830 with the traveling company of Vincent DeCamp. The following year, he married Eliza Middlecott. In 1832, while suffering from indigestion, he accidentally ingested a preparation of arsenic. A doctor was called in and saved his life, but thereafter he would suffer health problems and fatigue. During the succeeding years he took various roles on the stage. His career prospects began to take a turn for the better in 1845 when he played the role of Hamlet atPark Theater, New York. For years afterward, he was considered the best performer of Hamlet on the American stage. For the next fifteen years he played a variety of roles and became a leading light on the American stage. He co-authored a work titled, Orthophony; or the Cultivation of the Voice, in Elocution in 1847. In 1850, Murdoch relocated to southern Ohio, buying a home in Cincinnati and a farm in southern Warren County. In 1853, he appeared in California as an early acting pioneer for that region. A visit to England in 1856 led to an engagement at the Haymarket Theatre that lasted for over one hundred consecutive nights. During the American Civil War, Murdoch was unable to actively serve in the war. His son's enlistment, though, led him to halt his acting career in order to give public performances that supported the Union's efforts. The proceeds raised from his public reading were used to aid wounded soldiers, while his reading selections — such as Joseph Drake's \"American Flag\" — were designed to invoke a sense of patriotism. He was so successful as a public platform reader that President Lincoln personally requested his performance of an anonymous poem criticizing dishonorable peace in 1864. After the war, the residents of the area in Warren County, Ohio surrounding Murdoch's farm petitioned to have the region renamed Murdoch, Ohio in his honor. Murdoch, Ohio retained a post office for more than thirty years. Currently, it is an unincorporated community. He was the uncle of the brothers Frank Murdock and Harry Murdock. The actor Harry Murdock perished in 1876 in the Brooklyn Theater Fire along with nearly three hundred others. He was performing in the play Two Orphans with Kate Claxton, who survived the fire. Frank Murdock was an actor, writer, and painter, who wrote the screenplay for the 1916 film Davy Crockett that starred William Farnum and was directed by William Desmond Taylor. During the last two years of his life James Murdoch suffered from various ailments and was cared for by his two daughters, Fanny and Ida. He is buried in Spring Grove Cemetery, Cincinnati."

Edward Wanton had lived in York, Maine; Boston, Massachusetts; and Scituate, Massachusetts before coming to Rhode Island. John Wanton was a merchant, and like his father was a Quaker, and the Friends' records state that \"for many years he was a valuable public friend.\" He first entered public service in 1706 as a deputy from Newport serving for several years in that capacity, and also as the Speaker of the House of Deputies. He was called Colonel John Wanton in 1706 when he went after French privateers with John Dublin, who was wounded in the action. Between 1721 and 1734 Wanton was the Deputy Governor for the colony, and following the death of his brother, William Wanton, he became governor in 1734, serving continuously until his own death in 1740. He was buried in the Coddington Cemetery in Newport. Wanton was married to Mary Stover, the daughter of Sylvester and Elizabeth (Norton) Stover of Cape Neddick, York County, Maine, and had five children. Wanton's brother, William Wanton, preceded him as governor, and his nephews Gideon Wanton and Joseph Wanton were later governors of the colony."

  "text" : "Johann Georg Meyer von Bremen (28 October 1813 Bremen, Germany – 4 December 1886 Berlin), commonly known as Meyer von Bremen, was a German painter who specialized in Biblical, peasant, and family scenes. In his 2lst year, he went to Düsseldorf and began his studies at the Academy of Art there, which was led by Friedrich Wilhelm Schadow, the son of sculptor Johann Gottfried Schadow. He is associated with the Düsseldorf school of painting. In 1841, Meyer opened a studio of his own, but moved to Berlin as his fame increased (1853). While scenes from the Bible were first the subjects of his brush, he later turned his attention to incidents from popular life, especially among the Hessian peasantry, and finally to the portrayal of family life in its pathetic aspect. Such pictures as ‘The Jubilee of a Hessian Pastor’ (1843), ‘Christmas Eve,’ ‘Blindman's Buff,’ ‘The Soldier's Return,’ ‘The Inundation’ (1846), ‘The Repentant Daughter’ (1852, in the gallery at Bremen), are full of intense sympathy with the “simple annals of the poor.” After taking up his residence at Berlin, he chose especially scenes from child life, which he rendered with spirited humor. Among his pictures of this kind are: 'The Little Flower Girl(1853)', ‘The Fairy Tale,’ ‘Children Playing Blindman's Buff,’ ‘Grandfather and Grandchild,’ and others. A third group of his pictures includes those of young women, as single figures or in groups, such as ‘The Tryst’ and ‘The Love Letter.’ An example of his work, ‘The Letter’ (1873), is in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City."

He was a highly regarded Reformation historian and ecumenist. Beginning in the 1940s, Lortz made his ecumenical views available to general readers as well as to scholars in order to promote reconciliation between Catholics and Protestants. His writings played a role in the thinking that manifested itself in the Second Vatican Council's Decree on Ecumenism, Unitatis Redintegratio (21 November 1964). What was not widely known, however, was Lortz's involvement with Nazism from 1933 until 1937. His Geschichte der Kirche (1932) (History of the Church) portrayed the church of the 1800s and the 1900s as the bastion of divine truth and moral values amid the decay of Western society."

In April 1640, Meux was elected Member of Parliament for Newtown in the Short Parliament. He was re-elected MP for Newtown infor the Long Parliament in November 1640 and sat until he was disabled for supporting the King in 1644. He was created baronet of Kingston on 11 December 1641. Meux was given a fine of £375 in October 1646 by the Committee for Compounding, but it was still unpaid in 1655. IN that year, he was called before the Commissioners for Hampshire to value his estates but did not appear and was ordered to pay £50 a year. In May 1656, he petitioned Parliament asking to be assessed only on an annuity of £100 since the rest of his property had been \"conveyed away for debt and to provide for his children\". He renewed the petition in November 1656 when it was referred to a committee and the outcome is unknown. He died the following February. Meux married Elizabeth Worsley, daughter of Sir Richard Worsley, 1st Baronet of Appuldurcombe. He was succeeded by his eldest son William."

  "text" : "James Yate Johnson (1820, Kendal, Cumbria – 2 February 1900, Funchal) was an English naturalist. He was the son of John Henry Johnson and Ann Yate, also brother of John Henry Johnson (patent attorney). James who lived in Madeira from around 1851, studied marine fish, crustacea, sea anemones and sponges and terrestrial spiders, flowering plants and mosses. He collected specimens for other naturalists; for instance, George Busk, who in 1859 wrote \"Zoophytology: On some Madeiran Polyzoa.\" Collected by J. Yates Johnson, Esq. in the Quarterly Journal of Microscopical Science, vol. 7, pp. 65–67. James discovered and named Halargyreus johnsonii and Melanocetus johnsonii during his time in Madeira. James also explored the São Vicente Caves after being informed of their existence by locals on Madeira in 1885. The caves were opened to the public on 1 of October 1996, being one of the first caves of volcanic origins to be opened to the public in Portugal."

  "text" : "Jacob L. Beilhart (March 4, 1867 – November 24, 1908) was the founder and leader of a communitarian group known as the Spirit Fruit Society. Beilhart believed that jealousy, materialism, and the fear of losing another's love were at the root of much of the illness in the world. Under his direction, the Spirit Fruit Society sought to model and practice those beliefs. Beilhart was born in Ohio and raised in the Lutheran faith. He moved to Kansas when he was 18 and embraced Seventh-day Adventism. He later attended college to become a licensed preacher. Eventually, Beilhart came to believe that it was more important to put faith into practice helping others so he left preaching to study nursing and work in a sanitarium. He returned to Ohio in 1899 to start the Spirit Fruit Society, an intentional community based on his experiences, learning, and views. Beilhart led the group for nine years before he died of appendicitis and peritonitis in 1908. Beilhart's commune survived for another 22 years making it one of the longest surviving communes in America."

  "text" : "Joe Hutton (1923–1995) was born in Halton Lea Gate, near Haltwhistle in the west of Northumberland. Like his father, Jake, he was a shepherd, and a musician - he started on the fiddle, but took up the Northumbrian smallpipes after hearing P.J. Liddell and G.G. Armstrong playing at a concert in 1936. He started on a James Reid set from Halton Lea Gate, refurbished by G.G. Armstrong, a noted piper from Hexham, and he took lessons in the instrument from Armstrong. He made rapid progress, and won a competition as a novice, the following year. Armstrong made him a new set of pipes in January 1938, and Joe was photographed, standing at the left, with other competitors at the Bellingham Show piping competition in 1938. He continued to play the fiddle at dances during the war years, but he continued piping, upgrading to a 17-keyed chanter, again by Armstrong, in 1943. In 1950 he began piping in competitions again, winning all the Open competitions for two years. He was very isolated living out on the border with Cumberland, and to play with Tommy Breckons, a noted piper from Bellingham, he recalled \"it meant walking 8 miles to Gilsland, bus to Hexham, another bus to Bellingham....Man, it was a day's work getting there\". On another such piping trip, to Carrawbrough on the Roman Wall, he met his future wife, Hannah, whose brother John was also a piper. In 1955, he obtained, from Tommy Breckons, a fine 17-keyed ivory and silver set of pipes. These had previously belonged to P.J Liddell, and are widely believed to have been made by T. Errington Thompson, of Sewingshields, about 1870. He played this set, the first set he had ever heard, for the rest of his life. In 1978, he retired from farming and settled in Rothbury, in the centre of the county. This enabled him to concentrate much more on piping, fortunately at a time of growing interest in the instrument and its traditional music."

  "text" : "Professor Jean Pouilloux, born October 31, 1917 in Le Vert (Deux-Sèvres), France and died at Pimontin (Rhone) May 23, 1996 was a French hellenist archaeologist. He was educated at the École normale supérieure de la rue d’Ulm from 1939 to 1944. He completed his training and made his initial research at the French School of Archaeology in Athens, then was appointed in 1949 to the Faculty of Arts in Lyon. From 1957 to 1985 he was Professor of Greek language, literature and epigraphy at the University of Lyon and the University Lumière Lyon 2. Specialist in archeology and Greek epigraphy, he worked at Delphi, Rhamnus in Attica, the island of Thasos and Cyprus where he founded and directed an archaeological mission. He was a member of the Académie des inscriptions et belles-lettres, several French and foreign academies and in 1988, president of the Institute of France. His teaching has attracted several generations of students but Jean was not only a teacher. In 1959, he founded within the University of Lyon's Faculty of Arts, the Fernand Courby Institute, named after a Hellenist archaeologist who taught in the same faculty between the two wars. In later years, he created a dynamic team around him, officially recognized by the CNRS in the 1960s. In 1964, he obtained permission to excavate a large archaeological site in Cyprus; the ancient city of Salamis. Jean Pouilloux was a member of the National Council for Scientific Research, the Universities Advisory Committee, National Council of archaeological research, and for years on the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Committee on the excavations. For four years he chaired the Centre for Archaeological Research at CNRS in Sophia-Antipolis. The culmination of his activity was the creation in 1975 of the Maison de l'Orient et de la Méditerranée where he served as director until 1978. In 1976, he was appointed scientific director of humanities at the CNRS for six years. He was also notable for translation of Jewish-Greek literature in the 1960s, collaborating with Father Claude Roger Arnaldez Mondésert to publish works of Philo of Alexandria, of which he personally translated four volumes."

  "text" : "Julian Spalding (born 15 June 1947 in Lewisham, South London) is an English art critic, writer, broadcaster and a former curator. Considered to be a controversial maverick and outspoken critic of the art world, he has frequently contributed to arts, news and current affairs programmes on radio and TV. Spalding grew up on a council estate in St Mary Cray, South London. His upbringing there played an important part in shaping his subsequent outlook, particularly with regard to understanding how social inequality and cultural deprivation have a negative impact on people's lives. He studied art history at Nottingham University and art at Nottingham Art College, and after a brief spell as an artist and designer he chose to work in museums and galleries. Spalding started as an art assistant at museums in Leicester and Durham before becoming director of galleries for Sheffield, and then Manchester. In 1989 he was appointed director of Glasgow Museums, responsible for the largest collection managed by a local authority and Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum, the most visited museum outside London. During his career as a curator he established several award-winning, innovative galleries and museum services, including the Ruskin Gallery in Sheffield; the St Mungo Museum of Religious Life and Art and The Gallery of Modern Art (GoMA) in Glasgow; and the Open Museum. In 2000, he also instigated the now international Campaign for Drawing. In 1999, he was awarded the Lord Provost's Prize for Services to the Visual Arts in Glasgow for his directorship of Glasgow Art Galleries and Museums, although his curatorial career was cut short the same year when his post, along with others, was abolished by Glasgow City Council. Spalding subsequently spoke internationally and advised museums and galleries about new and innovative approaches, later outlined as what he describes as a practical philosophy in his 2002 book The Poetic Museum. Since 2001, he has concentrated chiefly on his writing, winning the Banister Fletcher Prize in 2006 for his book The Art of Wonder."

Spyridonakes was born in Cyprus. Originally a low-born handicraftsman, he secured the favour of Emperor Alexios III Angelos and rose to the post of head of the imperial privy purse (the oikeiakon vestiarion). Subsequently, he was appointed governor of the theme of Smolena in eastern Macedonia. In 1201, he rebelled against the Byzantine emperor, taking advantage of a series of raids and rebellions – such as those of Dobromir Chrysos and Ivanko – then occurring in the Byzantine Empire's Balkan provinces. He was soon defeated by imperial forces under the Emperor's son-in-law Alexios Palaiologos and driven to seek refuge at the court of the Bulgarian emperor Kalojan (r. 1197–1207)."

Hill took up the study of cooking and its related sciences later in life: she returned to school around age 40, graduating from the Boston Cooking School in 1892. Fannie Farmer was assistant principal at the time. In 1896 she founded the Boston Cooking School Magazine (later renamed American Cookery). Hill produced several cookbooks promoting the products of a particular company, a practice that began during this period. Alice Bradley, an 1897 graduate of the Boston Cooking School, who later bought Miss Farmer's Cooking school and was cooking editor of the Woman's Home Companion for twenty years, got her start doing cooking demonstrations for Hill. A small sample of Hill's work is the Baked Bean Sandwich."

In the late 1990s, Reilly received attention for his criticism of social and living conditions on the Stoney Lakota First Nations reserve, as well as allegations of political corruption and financial mismanagement against the reserve's administration. After retiring from the regular court bench in 2008, Reilly continued to serve as a supernumerary judge. In late 2010 he published a book, Bad Medicine: A Judge's Struggle for Justice in a First Nations Community, recounting his experiences as a criminal court judge, views on Canadian justice system and the concept of restorative justice, and his interactions with the Nakoda people of the Stoney reserve. In March 2011, Reilly resigned as a supernumerary judge and declared his candidacy in the Alberta riding of Wild Rose for the Liberal Party of Canada in the 2011 Canadian federal election. On April 7, 2011, Reilly attracted controversy for comments he made about mandatory minimum sentencing for sexual assault, while being interviewed by radio host Dave Rutherford."

  "text" : "Jean Hissette (30 August 1888 – 26 August 1965) was a Belgian ophthalmologist. Hissette was born in Leuven. In 1930, he became the first to discover African River Blindness, a severe eye disease occurring in people affected by onchocerciasis, a filarial worm infection. Onchocerciasis had already been known for a long time, but until 1930 no other specialist in tropical diseases had ever identified severely afflicted blind people anywhere in Africa. Hissette discovered several thousand victims along the Sankuru river in Belgian Congo, and so became the first one to identify this strain of the disease."

  "text" : "James Pigot (1769 – 15 Feb 1843) was a British publisher of directories, and a pioneering publisher of trade directories. He was born in Macclesfield. In 1811 he began publishing trade directories for Manchester, competing with the firm of R. & W. Dean but later joining with them in 1815 to produce Pigot & Dean's Manchester and Salford Directory. He began publishing The Commercial Directory in 1814, and expanded to other cities, including London in 1823. He brought his son into his firm Pigot & Co., but his son died in 1840. He made his apprentice Isaac Slater a partner into the firm, which became Pigot & Slater. The titles of the directories varied from New Commercial Directory or National Commercial Directory, and finally Royal National and Commercial Directory and Topography. His company stopped producing directories for London and the Home Counties after 1840 in the face of fierce competition from the firm of Kelly & Co.. Pigot died in 1843, and Slater continued publishing directories on his own (after 1852 only for northern England, Scotland, and Ireland). After Slater's own death in 1883, the company was bought by Kelly & Co. in 1892. Pigot is buried in St. John's Church, Deansgate, Manchester (without an epitaph)."

In 1854, O’Neill’s Mill, (as Neillsville was originally called), was selected as the county seat of Clark County. O'Neill served as treasurer of Clark County in 1861-1865 and on the Clark County Board of Supervisors serving as chairman. He served in the Wisconsin State Assembly in 1849 and 1868. He owned a lumber business and hotel in Neillsville until his death. His nephew was James O'Neill who was a judge and served in the Wisconsin State Assembly.

  "text" : "Joseph Judson (born 1619 in Kirby Mooreside, Yorkshire, England, died 8 October 1690) was a Connecticut settler, local official and militia officer. He emigrated from England to Concord, Massachusetts, in New England in 1634 with his father William, his mother Grace and his two brothers Jeremiah and Joshua. In 1638, he and his father and brother moved to Stratford, Connecticut, being among the first Europeans to arrive at that place. Joseph Judson became so prominent in the development of the town and his name so frequent in the records that historians thought he was the first of the name in Stratford. He was elected as a freeman in 1658. He was elected a Deputy in 1659 and served in the workings of the Colony of Connecticut for the next thirty years. In 1671, he received permission from then Governor John Winthrop, Jr. to create a new town called Woodbury and removed from Stratford with other families to settle the newly created town the same year. Judson had a disagreement with Joseph Hawley and the majority of elders at Stratford as they tried to introduce the half way covenant. This led to a major rift which lasted for many years and split the church and the town."

  "text" : "John Lapham Bullis (April 17, 1841 – May 26, 1911) was a much-decorated American soldier and later an entrepreneur. He was born at Macedon, New York, the eldest of the seven children of Dr. Abram R. and Lydia P. (Lapham) Bullis. Although brought up as a Quaker, he did not attend services regularly. Bullis served in the Civil War, Indian Wars, and Spanish–American War. In the 1870s and 1880s Bullis used his knowledge of West Texas to make very shrewd investments in land. In 1886 Bullis was a partner in the Shafter Silver Mine in Presidio County, Texas with famed Colonel William R. Shafter and rancher John A. Spencer. These investments made him a very wealthy man."

  "text" : "Joe Clarke (Irish: Seosamh Ó Clérigh, 22 December 1882 – 1976) was an Irish republican activist. Born in Rush, Dublin, Clarke worked for the Sinn Féin Bank, and was active in the Easter Rising. When captured, he was shot in the head, but survived, and was instead imprisoned in Liverpool Prison, Wakefield Prison and then Frongoch Internment Camp. On his return to Ireland, Clarke acted as the courier for the First Dáil, but was interned from January 1921. Released in 1923, he acted as caretaker of the Sinn Féin headquarters on Harcourt Street, and founded the Irish Book Bureau. Although the Anti-Treaty Sinn Féin rejected participation in the Dáil, they continued to contest local elections, and Clarke sat on Dublin City Council. Clarke was a founder member of Comhairle na Poblachta in 1929. In 1937, he worked with Brian O'Higgins to establish the Wolfe Tone Weekly as a light-hearted party newspaper. In August 1939, Clarke was interned at Arbour Hill, then later at Cork County Jail. Although Clarke had served under Éamon de Valera during the Easter Rising, the two became implacable opponents. Clarke was ejected from an official commemoration of the fiftieth anniversary of the First Dáil for interrupting de Valera's speech in order to raise the complaints of the Dublin Housing Action Committee. He vowed to outlive de Valera, in which endeavour he succeeded by a year. Clarke was elected as a Vice-President of Sinn Féin in 1966. In the split of 1970, he supported the provisional wing, remaining Vice-President. The Dublin South West Inner City cumann of Sinn Féin is named for Clarke."

  "text" : "Jeffrey Locker was an American self-help author and motivational speaker. In 2009, Locker hired Kenneth Minor to kill him so his family would collect $18 million in insurance benefits. Minor claimed that Locker, a married father of three from Long Island, hired him to \"do a Kevorkian\", help him to commit suicide. Mr. Locker was found dead in his car, in East Harlem, bound and stabbed. Longtime Allegheny County Medical Examiner Dr. Cyril Wecht testified as a defense expert on behalf of Minor. Minor was sentenced to 20 years to life for the murder of Locker. Minor is appealing his conviction. In October 2014, his sentence was reduced to 12 years. Eventually Federal Judge William Kuntz ruled that the $4 million policy issued by Principal Life Insurance should be voided because Locker had substantially misstated his annual income as $800,000 when, in truth, his gross income at the time was no more than $225,000 and he was deeply in debt."

  "text" : "Joel Bergner (aka Joel Artista) is a muralist/ street artist and educator whose work focuses on issues of culture, social justice, and telling the stories of those who have been ignored or misunderstood by society. Joel is currently the co-director of the international community based public arts network, the Artolution. Working primarily in spray paint, acrylic paint, stencil and mosaic, Bergner has created large public murals in many US cities as well in Brazil, the Zaatari refugee camp in Jordan, Cuba, Kenya, Mozambique, Poland, Cape Verde (West Africa), El Salvador, and Peru. His mural projects often feature collaborations with human rights and youth-based organizations, most notably the International Rescue Committee, the US Committee for Refugees and Immigrants, the Boys & Girls Club, UNICEF and Amnesty International, who invited him to be a featured artist at their Human Rights Art Festival in 2010. Through his \"Action Ashé! Global Mural Project,\" Joel leads workshops with disadvantaged youth around the world, who participate in the creation of public artwork. He has worked with incarcerated teenagers, Syrian refugees, youth from marginalized communities, the mentally and physically disabled, and street children in Rio de Janeiro. Joel has also created public art projects based on his own research and interviews, including murals about the plight of global refugees, survivors of domestic violence, Afro-Colombians displaced by political violence, the Civil War in El Salvador, Cape Verdean culture and history, and immigration. He was awarded the “Best Public Mural of 2004” by the mural arts organization Precita Eyes in San Francisco. In 2013 and 2014 Joel Bergner created public art and led educational workshops in collaboration with Syrian refugee children and teenagers in the Za'atari Refugee Camp in partnership with the organizations aptART, ACTED and UNICEF.  In 2014 he was a featured artist with the global event Street Child World Cup in Rio de Janeiro, where he worked with former and current street children from around the world to create public art.  In 2013 Joel Bergner organized and led the Kibera Walls for Peace Initiative in the Kibera slum of Nairobi, Kenya in collaboration with the Kibera Hamlets youth organization. The project, which was widely covered in the international media, involved peace-building workshops with local children and teenagers and the creation of a series of street paintings that promoted peace ahead of the 2013 presidential elections, all of which was documented for a film by Nairobi filmmaker Willie Owusu. The initiative included a collaboration with local graffiti artists for the \"Peace Train,\" in which the artists and youth participants painted a 10-car passenger train with art aimed at easing ethnic tensions as the election approached. Kibera Walls for Peace was covered by National Public Radio (NPR), CNN, Arise TV, BBC, USA Today, Reuters, and Agence-France Presse (AFP). Joel has been covered extensively in the media. His public artwork and art-based social projects have been published in The New York Times, The Washington Post, and in the books Street Art San Francisco: Mission Muralismo and Mural Art Volume 3. He has been featured on the international news networks Al Jazeera English, Voice of America and BBC World News. He has been widely featured on local television, radio, newspapers, blogs and websites in the Washington DC and Baltimore regions, Cape Verde, Brazil, Cuba, San Francisco and El Salvador."

  "text" : "Sir John Stewart, 1st Earl of Angus & suo jure uxoris Lord of Abernethy (died 1331) was a medieval Scottish nobleman. Stewart was the son of Sir Alexander Stewart of Bonkyll, grandson of Alexander Stewart, 4th High Steward of Scotland and an unknown mother. Sir Alexander died c. 1319, and Stewart inherited his father's estates in Berwickshire, centred upon the barony of Bonkyll and Preston. In 1328 he married Margaret de Abernethy, heiress to the Lordship of Abernethy. Her father Sir Alexander de Abernethy was the last of the Gaelic lords of Abernethy, descendants of Gille Míchéil, Earl of Fife. Stewart assumed his wife's titles, and was further ennobled by Robert I of Scotland in 1329, being created Earl of Angus. The Earldom of Angus had been forfeited by the previous holder, Robert de Umfreville, before 1314, for choosing the losing side during the Wars of Scottish Independence, although he continued to style himself Earl until his death in 1325. It is through John Stewart's granddaughter, Margaret's illicit relationship with William Douglas, 1st Earl of Douglas, that the Earldom of Angus, Lordship of Abernethy, and the comitatus associated with it passed on to the Douglases in the person of George Douglas (the first Red Douglas). This close connection of the Douglas Earls of Angus with the House of Stewart, was to have large implications for the latter's future struggles with the Black Douglases. Stewart was invested with Knighthood in November 1331, but died just two weeks later. He was succeeded by his son Thomas Stewart, 2nd Earl of Angus."

  "text" : "Julia Bracken Wendt, (1870–1942) a notable American sculptor, was born in Apple River, Illinois, the twelfth of thirteen children in an Irish Catholic family. Unsupported at home following the death of her mother when she was nine years old, she ran away from home at thirteen. By sixteen she was working as a domestic servant for a woman who recognized her talent and drive and paid to enroll her in the Art Institute of Chicago. There she studies with Lorado Taft and by 1887 she had advanced to become his studio and teaching assistant. In 1893, during the Columbian Exposition she was one of several women sculptors nicknamed the White Rabbits who helped produce some of the architectural sculpture that graced the exposition buildings. Aside from that she was awarded a commission to produce Illinois Welcoming the Nations for the Fair. The work was later cast in bronze and unveiled at the Illinois State Capitol, at which time Governor Altgeld was the main speaker. After successfully pursuing her career for a number of years in 1906 she married painter William Wendt and moved to Los Angeles, California where she continued her success. In California she taught at the Otis Art Institute. Wendt was a member of the National Sculpture Society and exhibited and was featured in both the 1923 and 1929 Exhibitions and the resulting catalogues."

He represented Granville Township in the Legislative Assembly of Nova Scotia from 1768 to 1770. He was born in Portsmouth, Rhode Island, the son of Thomas Hicks and Ann Clarke, who were Quakers. In 1740, he married Elizabeth Russell. Hicks settled in King’s County and served as a justice of the peace for Charlestown. In 1759, he travelled to Nova Scotia to investigate the availability of land for settlement there following the expulsion of the Acadians. In 1760, Hicks returned with his family, travelling with a group of Rhode Island planters. He was granted land in Falmouth Township where he served as a justice of the peace. Hicks moved to Granville Township in 1765. He was elected to the assembly in an 1768 by-election held after Henry Munroe resigned his seat. In 1772, he moved to Annapolis Township. Hicks operated a ferry across the Annapolis River between Granville and Annapolis townships. The settlement where he lived was first known as Hicks' Ferry but was later renamed Bridgetown. He died there at the age of 74. He is an ancestor of the UK TV presenter Richard Madeley - and this family was an episode of the UK Who Do You Think You Are TV Series - Series 8, Episode 8, first aired 28 September 2011."

Ukec gained notoriety in the West with a Washington Post article about his downplaying of international claims of genocide in Darfur. In the style of naming Iraqi diplomat Muhammad Saeed al-Sahhaf \"Bagdad Bob\" for his propaganda interviews, the Post nicknamed Ukec \"Khartoum Karl\". Joining the Southern Liberation Movement in 1964, he served as a military officer in the Anya-nya Forces until the Addis Ababa Peace Accord in 1972, when he was absorbed into the Sudan Armed Forces with the rank of captain. He concluded his military career as a general and commanding officer of the First Infantry Division's Combat Training Center. Moving to the United States in the 1980s, Ukec became an activist and public speaker on liberation issues of Southern Sudan. He earned master's degrees from both Iowa State University and Oklahoma State University. From 1989 to 2005, he taught economics at Langston University in Oklahoma and at Des Moines Area Community College in Iowa. During this time, he also worked at Iowa State University as a Financial Aid Administrator, Chair of Human Relations, and co-Chair of Black Faculty and Staff. General John left both Iowa State University and Des Moines Area Community College to join the Government of national unity as Sudan's Ambassador to the United States."

  "text" : "John Ratcliffe (c 1611 – 13 January 1673) was an English lawyer and politician who sat in the House of Commons at various times between 1646 and 1673. Ratcliffe was the son of John Ratcliffe, brewer and alderman of Chester and his second wife Jane Brerewood, daughter of John Brerewood of Chester. He was educated at Queen's College, Oxford in 1628. In 1629, he entered Middle Temple. He succeeded his father in 1633 and was called to the bar in 1637. In 1646, Ratcliffe was chosen recorder of Chester in 1646 and at about the same time was elected Member of Parliament for City of Chester in the Long Parliament to replace one of the disabled MPs. He was later removed from his position as recorder because he refused the negative oath and was replaced in 1651 by Richard Haworth, a lawyer of Manchester. Haworth was unwilling to make Chester his permanent residence and he surrendered the office to Ratcliffe in 1656. In 1659, Radcliffe became involved in the Cheshire rising led by George Booth, 1st Baron Delamer. Ratcliffe was one of the members of the corporation opposed to the regime which colluded with Booth although he was not penalised after the surrender of the city to John Lambert. In 1660, Ratcliffe was elected MP for the City of Chester in the Convention Parliament. He was re-elected in 1661 as MP for Chester in the Cavalier Parliament In 1662 he was put out of his position as recorder by the commissioners for regulating the corporations of the city of Chester and the county of Cheshire, because he refused to take the oath required by act of parliament. Ratcliffe held his seat until his death in 1673, and the consequent contested by election resulted in serious disorder and accidental loss of life during the poll. Ratcliffe married Dorothy and had at least two sons."

He graduated with a B.A. from Trinity College, Cambridge in 1821. In the years up to 1841, he wrote a number of history books about Russia, religious wars in France, and Guernsey. In 1846, he was editor of a newspaper called The Sentinel, and presented a petition to Parliament criticizing Frederic Festus Kelly, chief inspector of letter-carriers. In 1846, he wrote the tract \"How to reconcile the rights of property, capital, and labour\" for the Currency Reform Association. In 1847 he wrote a tract for the National Anti-Gold Law League, arguing that the size of the circulation should be determined by supply and demand. He opposed bullionism and Sir Robert Peel's banking and monetary laws, and the monetary policies of Samuel Jones-Loyd. Other publications included \"The Principles of Money demonstrated, and Bullionist Fallacies refuted\" (1849) and \"The Bank Charter Act: ought the Bank of England or the People of England to receive the Profits of the National Circulation?\" (1858). From 1846 to 1853 he lived at No. 13 Chester Place, Kennington (this address was later known as 255 Kennington Road, Lambeth, London)."

  "text" : "Jacques Testard de Montigny (1663–1737) was an officer in the colonial troupes de la marine of New France. Born in Montreal into a merchant family, Montigny first saw military action as a volunteer on the expedition against Schenectady in 1690. Two years later he went to France with Pierre Le Moyne d'Iberville, and was in 1693 stationed the capital of Acadia, Fort Nashwaak, where he led the local Abenaki and Mi'kmaq in raids against the English (See Battle of Fundy Bay.)While posted there he also engaged in trade and commerce, sometimes in conflict with his military duties. In 1696 Montigny was on d'Iberville's expedition against Pemaquid, an English fort on the northern frontier with Acadia. In this action he began a close association with the Abenaki war leader Escumbuit, who also joined Montigny on d'Iberville's Newfoundland campaign later in 1696, in which most of the English settlements on Newfoundland were destroyed. Montigny was given an independent command by d'Iberville, in which he traveled along the coast, destroying settlements and fishing stages as he went. Despite the destructive nature of the expedition, it had no long-lasting implications, as the English quickly returned, rebuilding and fortifying some of the settlements. Montigny was promoted to lieutenant in 1700. In 1704 he was sent back to Acadia, where he helped orchestrate raids against English settlements, and worked to convince the Abenakis to resettle closer to French settlements. In the winter of 1704/5 he brought a band of Abenakis to Newfoundland, where they attempted to repeated d'Iberville's 1696 expedition under the direction of Daniel d'Auger de Subercase. They once again destroyed a number of English settlements, but were unable to capture St. John's, the English capital. In 1706 Montigny went to France with Escumbuit, where they were received by King Louis XIV. He was a member of an expedition sent in 1709 to dispute a possible English advance on Lake Champlain. The English never reached beyond the southern end of the lake, and the only action was a brief skirmish near Crown Point. He was awarded the Order of Saint Louis in 1712, and in 1721 was given command of a frontier fort on Green Bay, where he maintained good relations with the Fox, and was visited by his friend Escumbuit. By 1726 he had returned to Montreal, and in 1730 he was made commandant of Fort Michilimackinac, a post he held for three years before finally retiring. He died in Montreal in 1737. He was twice married, and had seven children."

  "text" : "James Inglis (1813–1872) was an American preacher and editor who was one of the earliest advocates of the dispensationalist form of premillennialism in the United States. Inglis was born in Scotland and immigrated to the United States in 1848, settling in Michigan. In Adrian, Michigan he was converted to the Baptist faith, and shortly after that became pastor of the First Baptist Church in Detroit, Michigan. In 1854 he began to publish Waymarks in the Wilderness. In this publication he admitted to drawing on the teaching of John Nelson Darby and the Plymouth Brethren in advocating the secret coming of Jesus Christ and the rapture. This is called dispensationalism, but the name is misleading, because it is the secret coming and the removal for a time of the faithful, and not the view that there are different dispensations of the gospel, that distinguishes it from other forms of premillennialism. Inglis would later move to Saint Louis, Missouri and eventually New York City and would continue to publish Waymarks in the Wilderness sporadically until his death."

  "text" : "Julian Gough (born 1966) is an Irish novelist, economic satirist and the former singer and main lyric writer of the Irish band Toasted Heretic. Gough grew up near Heathrow Airport in London before moving to Nenagh aged seven. He was studying English and philosophy at University College Galway in the late 1980s when he and some friends founded Toasted Heretic. The band went on to record four albums and had one top ten hit, \"Galway and Los Angeles\", in 1992. His first novel, Juno & Juliet, was published in 2001 by Flamingo, almost a decade after Toasted Heretic split up. His second novel, Jude: Level 1, was published in 2007 at Old Street Publishing, shortly after he won the 2007 National Short Story Award for the book's first chapter, titled \"The Orphan and the Mob\". In 2010, Salmon Poetry released Gough's first poetry collection, Free Sex Chocolate, which juxtaposes Gough's more recent forays into poetry with his earlier lyrics written for Toasted Heretic. He is also the author of several short stories and novellas that satirize global economic policies, including 2003's Great Hargeisa Goat Bubble and CRASH! How I Lost a Hundred Billion and Found True Love. In 2015, Gouch signed a book deal with Picador. Gough also writes columns and opinion pieces for various newspapers and magazines, including Guardian,Prospect Magazine and A Public Space. In 2007, he rebelled against the decision to award the Bollinger Everyman Wodehouse Prize to writer Will Self. Gough, who was nominated alongside Self, stole the prize, a pig, to keep for himself. In early 2010, Gough wrote an article on the state of Irish literature, \"slamming fellow Irish novelists\", on his personal website. Gough's novel Jude in London came third in the 2011 Guardian Not The Booker prize after the author threatened to share pictures of him \"wearing only the [Not The Booker trophy] mug\" shall he win the competition. In 2011, he quickly wrote up the ending credits for the popular video game Minecraft prior to its November release."

  "text" : "John Tarleton (ca. 1808-1895) was an American settler and rancher. He is best known for endowing John Tarleton Agricultural College, which eventually became Tarleton State University. He was born in either White Mountain, Vermont or in New Hampshire, probably in November 1808, although one source claims 1811. He was orphaned when he was seven, and went to live with his widowed aunt in Vermont. His brother was sent to another relative in Virginia. When Tarleton was 13, he left and wandered from place to place all over the country. In Knoxville, Tennessee, he worked as a schoolteacher for a while, before getting a job as a store clerk with the Cowan-Dickerson mercantile. Here he toiled for the next 40 years, living frugally and buying up bounty certificates issued to veterans of the War of 1812, which authorized them \"to settle on any unsurveyed or unappropriated public land.\" He also purchased 10,000 acres (4,000 ha) of land in Erath and Palo Pinto Counties in west Texas at 12.5 cents an acre. In 1860 or 1861, he set out to look over his property. He found Native Americans living on the land, so he set up a mercantile store in Waco. In September 1876, he married wealthy widow Mary Louisa Johnson. They agreed to a contract keeping their estates separate, but when the wife learned that her husband owned a considerable amount of land, she asked for a different division of their property. He refused, and a year and a day after their wedding, she filed for divorce in a St. Louis court. John Tarleton got to the hearings just in time to present his copy of their marriage contract, and the divorce was granted with no division of property. The couple did however remain friends. In 1880, he revisited his land in Erath and Palo Pinto Counties. The Native Americans had been supplanted by settlers, whom he paid for the improvements they had made. He had his land surveyed and tried to sell plots, with no success, so he became a rancher, with middling success. John Tarleton died of typhoid fever on September 11 or November 16, 1895. In his will, he left about $85,000, a considerable amount at the time, to establish a college in Stephenville, Texas, which eventually became Tarleton State University. He also directed that his land in Knoxville be used to set up the John Tarleton Institute \"for poor, worthy youths of good moral character.\""

He was instrumental in obtaining the municipal franchise of Manchester as a borough in 1838, and was its Mayor between 1842-3, and later became the MP for Stockport from 1847 until his death. He died at his home in Streatham, and was buried in West Norwood Cemetery where his ornate Gothic tomb by Alfred Waterhouse (architect of the Natural History Museum, London and Manchester Town Hall) is listed Grade II, and in such poor condition as to be on the English Heritage at risk register. There is currently no plan from Lambeth council to improve the situation."

Hulbert was trained as \"state electrician\" by his predecessor, Edwin F. Davis, and oversaw 140 executions during his tenure. According to his colleague, Sing Sing prison physician Amos Squire, Hulbert became significantly depressed about his job, but performed the duty for the good salary of $150 per execution. Hulbert went to lengths to maintain his privacy, never allowed the press to obtain a photograph, and was described in newspapers as \"the man who walks alone.\" Following a nervous breakdown in 1926, Hulbert retired as executioner. He said, \"I got tired of killing people.\" In 1929, Hulbert became further depressed over the death of his wife, Mattie, and, at the age of 59, committed suicide by going into the cellar of his home and shooting himself. Hulbert was survived by two children, Martha, age 24, and John D., age 29. He was buried beside his wife in Soule Cemetery, Sennett, New York."

  "text" : "John Schneider (born April 23, 1962) is an American film, television and multi-media producer and artists' manager based in Los Angeles, California. The Pacifica, California native made his first forays into show business when he took on the position of personal manager for his younger brother, comedian and actor Rob Schneider, and subsequently managed the San Francisco area rock band Head On. Eventually, John transitioned into producing movies such as The Hot Chick and Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo, alongside executive producers Adam Sandler and Jack Giarraputo. John was the executive producer of Rob, a situation comedy starring Rob Schneider, which aired on the CBS television network in 2012, and co-produced the Academy Award-nominated 2012 feature film Hitchcock. He also serves as the personal manager of comedian, talk-show host and actor Tom Green, and creative consultant for Limp Bizkit frontman Fred Durst. Schneider produced Tom Green Live -- the weekly talk show hosted by Green on entrepreneur/media mogul Mark Cuban's AXS TV channel -- and is currently engaged in program development for CBS-TV, Showtime and The CW networks in conjunction with The Tannenbaum Company. In addition to his various production and management credits, John previously owned and operated the San Francisco nightclub DNA Lounge, and, at the age of 23, was elected to the Pacifica, California school board. He now resides in the Los Angeles area with his wife and three daughters."

After a council of war on 18 March 1812, by a majority of six against two, he was declared to blame for disobeying his commander's orders whilst commanding the frigate La Clorinde, though not whilst in the presence of the enemy. He was condemned to have his sword broken, declared unworthy to serve, condemned unanimously to three years in prison and ejection from the Légion d'honneur. In the imperial decree of 30 March 1815 it was stated that this sentence was for not having taken part in the second engagement in which La Renommée surrendered and for having abandoned this frigate by a poor and irresolute manoeuvre. He was promoted back up to Capitaine de Vaisseau and to the rank which he had occupied in the navy lists, by ordnance of 21 April 1814, but on 30 March 1815 during the Hundred Days Bonaparte accepted his naval minister Denis Decrès's suggestion and issued an imperial decree which annulled the 1814 ordnance and confirmed the court martial's sentence."

  "text" : "John Chellis \"Jack\" Conner (October 3, 1913 – August 20, 2001) was an American marimbist. Conner was born in Kahoka, Missouri in 1913. At the age of six he began his studies of piano and percussion instruments. By the age of twelve, he was playing regularly on the radio with the KMOX Junior Orchestra. As a young artist he was a member of the International Marimba Symphony Orchestra during their European tour in 1935. Before pursuing a solo career, he was a member of both the St. Louis Symphony Orchestra and the St. Louis Municipal Opera Orchestra and was regularly heard on major St. Louis radio stations. He served overseas with the USO in the European theater and he later toured South America with the Xavier Cugat Orchestra. As one of the first percussionists to take the marimba and vibraphone into the classical world as solo instruments, he made his New York debut at Town Hall in 1950. After hearing Conner’s artistry on the instruments, Darius Milhaud, the French composer, was inspired to compose a concerto for Conner to perform. This Concerto for Marimba and Vibraphone was given its world premier with the St. Louis Symphony Orchestra in 1948 with Vladimir Golschmann conducting. In addition to his classical career, Conner was a jazz musician, especially in the New York City area. He was associated with Roger Williams, the pianist, with whom he had a 25-year association. He also performed with the Don Ho show in Hawaii and Las Vegas and served as music director and conductor for Anita Bryant. He also appeared on numerous radio and television programs such as Merv Griffin, Mike Douglas and the Lawrence Welk Show. Conner’s greatest love was inspirational and sacred music and he had a longtime association with Youth for Christ and World Vision, and his ministry in Christian music took him into concert halls, theaters, and churches throughout the world. He was also a producer of Christian films such as “In God We Trust”, which he wrote and in which he played a major role. He made numerous recordings featuring both the marimba and vibraphone. In 1990 he was presented the honorary degree, Doctor of Sacred Music, by Trinity College of Florida. He spent his later years performing with his son and daughter-in-law as “The Conners in Concert.”"

This cartoon is infamous for perhaps containing the first cartoon depiction of Adolf Hitler, and possibly of being among the first, if not first, widely distributed films that contain verbal usage of the f-bomb.

  "text" : "Jan Wouwerman (1629 in Haarlem – 1666 in Haarlem), was a Dutch Golden Age painter. According to Houbraken he was the youngest brother of the painters Philips and Pieter Wouwerman, who lived and worked in Haarlem. His work was relatively unknown when Houbraken was writing, and he assumed this was because he died young, two years before his oldest brother in 1666. Houbraken saw one of his landscapes at the home of Laurens van der Vinne, which was a mountainous landscape with a brown foreground, with rough and unclipped trees, while on the horizon a clear view of a valley could be seen. Especially the foreground was cleverly done, a bit loose and with original colors, the way one would have expected of his brother Philips in his younger years when he painted with more monotones than in his later years. According to the RKD he was the youngest brother of Philips Wouwerman who was known for his landscapes in the manner of Jan Wijnants. He was buried in the St. Bavochurch of Haarlem. The RKD does not list him as a member, but his name is on the list of 173 members of the Haarlem Guild of St. Luke that Vincent van der Vinne produced in 1702."

Malone was the first rover in North Melbourne's 1950 VFL Grand Final team, their first grand final since entering the competition in 1925. His participation had been in doubt during the week due to a shoulder injury but he was declared fit. He brought up his 100th league game during the 1951 VFL season and celebrated it with a three-point win over Richmond. Despite playing the opening round of the 1952 season, Malone ended the year with Coburg."

Writing about the latter while national arts critic of The Australian, Pulitzer Prize-winning critic Sebastian Smee said: \"If you are at all interested in Australian photography, whether or not you are from SA, you will want to see this show, or at least get hold of the catalogue.\" Robinson curated the 2004 Adelaide Biennial Of Australian Art: Contemporary Photomedia. The arts critic for the South Pacific edition of Time, described it as a “powerful survey which goes to show that photography isn't dead”. He noted that when Robinson curated her first photographic survey in 1990, “it was a more straightforward affair – pictures simply stared back at audiences” and went on to add, speaking of the Biennial, that “the 20 artists she has brought together in Adelaide explode the idea of what photography can be.” Featured artists included Bill Henson, Tracey Moffatt, Mike Parr and Patricia Piccinni."

Still family owned, by now the multinational manufacturing and marketing organization operates in 120 countries around the globe.

In 1990, Flood was a candidate for Governor of Massachusetts. His campaign came to an end at the Democratic Convention when he failed to get the 15% necessary to appear on the primary ballot. During the general election, Flood frequently criticized Democratic nominee John Silber, who went on to lose to Republican William Weld. Weld later named Flood to his transition team. Flood was nominated for a judgeship twice in 1993, but he was rejected both times by the Massachusetts Governor's Council. In 1996, Flood was appointed by Weld to the vacant sheriff's position in Norfolk County. He ran as a Republican for a full term in 1998, but lost to Democrat Michael G. Bellotti. Prior to being appointed sheriff, Flood was a panelist on the WCVB-TV Sunday morning talk show Five on Five. He died on July 26, 2016."

The fourth-year electrical apprentice subsequently moved to Tasmanian Football League side Hobart for the 2010 season. A full-forward, Howe made an immediate impact for the Tigers, becoming well known for his bleached blonde hair and high-flying marks. A player with impressive kicking skills and a big leap, Howe was recruited by Melbourne with the 33rd selection in the 2010 AFL Draft. His spectacular marking has drawn comparison with fellow Tasmanian and former Melbourne high-flyer, Russell Robertson. Howe made his debut against Essendon in Round 11 of the 2011 AFL season. Gathering 19 disposals in an impressive debut, Howe kicked his first AFL goal with a \"miraculous snap\" in the third quarter, helping Melbourne to a 33-point victory.Howe is known for his high-flying and crowd pleasing marks that light up the stadium. In 2012 he won the mark of the year award which he had many nominations for. In October 2015, Howe was traded to the Collingwood Football Club. Howe is the cousin of Australian and Victorian cricketer Matthew Wade."

  "text" : "Joshua Upham (November 3, 1741 – November 1, 1808) was a lawyer, judge and political figure in New Brunswick. He served as a member of the New Brunswick Council. He was born in Brookfield, Massachusetts, the son of Dr. Jabez Upham and Katharine Nichols, and graduated from Harvard College in 1763. He practised law in Brookfield. In 1768, he married Elizabeth Murray. In 1777, when, as a lawyer, he was required to take an oath of allegiance to the American state, he declared himself a loyalist and left for New York City to join the British. (He was subsequently named in the Massachusetts Banishment Act of 1778.) Upham was an officer, ending the war as a major in the King's American Dragoons. He was named a judge in the Supreme Court of New Brunswick in 1784. After the death of his first wife, he married Mary Chandler, the sister of Samuel Chandler and sister-law of Amos Botsford, in 1792. Upham, a slave-owner, voted to uphold the legality of slavery in New Brunswick in 1800. He died at the age of 66 in London, England, where he had gone to lobby the British government to make the salaries of Supreme Court judges in New Brunswick comparable with those in Upper and Lower Canada. His daughter Sarah married John Murray Bliss and his daughter Frances married John Wesley Weldon."

He played a key role in defusing the crisis caused by the 1797 naval mutiny at Spithead. Members of his family were long influential in Portsmouth politics. The eldest son of Susanna Pyke and John Carter, a successful and respected merchant, John was baptised in the High Street Presbyterian (Unitarian) Chapel in Portsmouth. His parents, rational dissenters, refused to belong to the Church of England and, like both his grandfathers, were members of this chapel. In 1763, at 22, John was elected an alderman of the (then) borough of Portsmouth and, at the same time, started to act as a magistrate. He was mayor for a few months in 1769, but, as he was a Whig, the Tories soon turned him out of office. His son John (1788–1838), a barrister and Member of Parliament for Portsmouth, changed his name to John Bonham-Carter to inherit from a cousin."

  "text" : "Jana Revedin, Prof. Arch. PhD, born 1965 in Constance (D), studied architecture and urban planning in Buenos Aires, Princeton and Milan and taught at the University of Venice where she submitted her doctorate on the role of public space in the development of a democratic civic identity. The UNESCO sustainability expert is a full professor for architecture and design at Blekinge Institute of Technology in Sweden. In her work as the UNESCO delegate on the research and teaching commission of the International Union of Architects (UIA) she campaigns for a paradigm change in the self-image of her profession.Alongside her internationally award-winning architectural and urban design projects Jana Revedin devotes herself to the support of and networking among pioneers and groundbreaking talents in the area of sustainable design: In 2005 the European Commission appointed her to lead the first student competition for sustainable architecture (gau:di), whose winners she then exhibited at the Biennale in Venice. In 2007 she established the Global Award for Sustainable Architecture™, which is awarded annually to five architect colleagues and in 2009 she established the non-profit LOCUS Foundation, which supports research into sustainable design processes and tests these in experimental urban renewal projects.The winner of the 2014 UN Habitat prize and the award for “teaching excellence” from Europe’s universities of urban planning, a French Chevalier des Arts et des Lettres and the author of standard works in the area of sustainable architecture Jana Revedin researches her “radicant” participatory design theory while using such interdisciplinary self-development concepts as her “Light for the Slums” project in Cairo to show how design “with the people by the people” is both feasible and scalable."

  "text" : "Jack W. Smith was a British trade unionist. Born in Coalville, Leicestershire in 1882 or 1883, Smith worked at Linby Colliery from the age of thirteen. He joined the Nottinghamshire Miners' Association (NMA) and quickly became a key supporter of Herbert Booth, and he joined the British Socialist Party. Smith later moved to Hucknall, where he stood for the Labour Party in local elections. He frequently came into dispute with the leadership of the NMA and, on one occasion, he broke the windows of their headquarters. Perhaps for this reason, he moved to Ellistown in Coalville, where he was elected agent for the Leicestershire Miners' Association (LMA), replacing Levi Lovett, and he was soon elected onto the executive committee of the Miners' Federation of Great Britain (MFGB), where he was a supporter of A. J. Cook. He organised swimming galas in the town, participating himself. During the 1926 United Kingdom general strike, and the miners' strike which followed, Smith organised a fundraising caravan tour, where he spoke alongside the comedian Billy Burton. However, this was unpopular with some union members, who felt that he should be more involved in union business in the county. Although he returned, he went on a short awareness-raising tour of Russia in November. Through these activities, he split with the majority of his union's executive, in particular, the right-wing secretary Tom Gowdridge, who had encouraged miners to return to work. The strike concluded by the end of the year, and Gowdridge announced that the union could no longer afford to pay an agent. Smith was upset by what he saw as political manoeuvering, and the de-politicisation of the union. He resigned and formed the rival \"New Miners' Union\" in January 1927, immediately attracting somewhere between one hundred and 250 members, in a similar fashion to the later creation of the United Mineworkers of Scotland. He asked that his organisation be permitted to affiliate to the MFGB, but Cook instead decided that the two rival unions should be reunited. Smith disbanded his union in March, on condition that the LMA hold an election for a new agent, and accept his candidacy for the post. Gowdridge ultimately did not hold an election, and the unemployed Smith instead moved to Leicester and set up an ice cream-selling business. This not a success, and he moved on to London, where he slept rough, before returning to Coalville. Although, on his return, Smith had no formal organisation of supporters, he retained considerable sympathy among the rank-and-file miners, and he organised well-attended political meetings. He spoke forcefully against Gowdridge and, in 1934, he was in the news for threatening to break the LMA's office windows. By this time, he was well known as a poacher, but also worked legally, sweeping streets and undertaking general labouring. In 1936, the LMA finally held an election for a new agent, judging correctly that Smith no longer had sufficient support to be elected - despite campaigning, he failed to be nominated by a single branch."

She officiated at most of the births in Hilden, Brookfield, Brentwood, Alton and Middle Stewiacke.

  "text" : "John Francis Larchet (13 July 1884 – 10 August 1967) was an Irish composer and teacher. He studied at Trinity College Dublin (MusB 1915, MusD 1917), also at the Royal Irish Academy of Music (RIAM) with Michele Esposito. Larchet was music director at the Abbey Theatre from 1908 to 1935 and was therefore responsible for the stage music accompanying many of the pivotal plays of the Irish Literary Renaissance, in particular those of William Butler Yeats, and also had his ballet Bluebeard performed there (in 1932), including the dancer Ninette de Valois. Although a prolific composer and arranger, his main contribution to Irish music was as a teacher: He taught harmony and counterpoint at the Royal Irish Academy of Music between 1920 and 1955 and was Professor of Music at University College Dublin between 1921 and 1958. Among his pupils were Michael Bowles (1909–1998), Frederick May (1911-1985), Walter Beckett (1914–1996), Joan Trimble (1915-2000), Brian Boydell (1917-2000), T.C. Kelly (1917–1985), Havelock Nelson (1917–1996), Gerard Victory (1921–1995), and Seóirse Bodley (b. 1933). Larchet was primarily a composer of miniatures and an arranger of Irish folksongs for classical ensembles. His arrangement (in 1954) of the Irish national anthem is the official version still in use today. His daughter, Sheila Larchet Cuthbert (b. 1923), is an Irish harpist and author. She published The Irish Harp Book: A Tutor and Companion (Dublin, 1975; 5/2004)."

He was the 7th and 9th M.P. for St Pancras (North). The constituency was created in 1885 and abolished in 1983, when it became part of the new constituency of Holborn and St Pancras. In the General Election of 6 December 1923, James Marley won his first seat in Parliament with a 2872 gain for Labour over the previous Conservative incumbent, John William Lorden, in what was to become the first Labour Government (1924). It was a short-lived victory for him and, in a hung parliament, his seat was taken, on 29 October 1924 in the General Election by his Conservative successor, Ian Fraser (later Baron Fraser of Lonsdale). He remained in politics, however, and was re-elected to the St Pancras (North) seat once again in May 1929, holding the seat until 27 October 1931, when he fell prey to again to a hung parliament, the seat being retrieved by Ian Fraser for the Conservatives."

  "text" : "John O. Reed (1929 London - 2012 Manchester) was an anthologist and translator of African literature. With Clive Wake he published several anthologies, as well as translations from French of the work of Léopold Sédar Senghor and Jean-Joseph Rabearivelo, in Heinemann's African Writers Series. He also translated work by Ferdinand Oyono. Together, they also translated some of the poetry of Yves Bonnefoy in 1967, but these translations were never published. Posthumously, Wake published their introductory essay to these translations online in tribute. John Reed made a journal entry every day of his life in his diaries (now held at Chetham’s Library, Manchester) from the age of ten until his death in 2012. For the first years of his life, they offer an insight into the life of a schoolboy during World War Two. After school, Reed recorded the daily details of his National Service. On his discharge, he studied English at Oxford under C.S. Lewis. However, it is his life as a university lecturer in Zimbabwe (formerly Rhodesia) that is perhaps of greatest interest. In 1957 he travelled to Salisbury to take up a teaching post, soon becoming involved in the anti-colonial political struggle, and developing a close friendship with Terence Ranger. The diaries offer a unique insight into the daily lives of those involved in the Liberation movement, and reveal how he was drawn deeper and deeper into what would become a very dark and dangerous situation. He was later forced to leave Rhodesia or face arrest, and took up a professorship at the University of Zambia at Lusaka. There he worked to develop theatre which drew on indigenous traditions and promoted the growth of a new generation of African dramatists."

Four years later he joined the Toronto Globe (later Globe and Mail) where, after breaking in as a cub reporter, he became a member of the editorial staff and wrote a regular bylined column: \"The Outlook of the Church.\" He left the Globe in 1929 to become editor of the Evangelical Christian magazine which he edited until his retirement in 1969. He was an author of early evangelical Christian thrillers, notably The Mystery of Mar Saba (1940). Hunter was the editor of the Evangelical Christian magazine, published in Toronto. Hunter wrote Christian adventure novels which sold thousands of copies in Canada and the USA. Dr. Hunter's 1951 novel, Thine is the Kingdom, received first prize in an international fiction contest; in 1956 he was named \"author of the quarter century\" by Zondervan Publishing Company. The Great Deception is a collection of short articles critical of the Roman Catholic Church, which J.H. Hunter published in the magazine he edited and then collected in book form and published in 1945 through The Evangelical Publishers in Toronto. In 1940 J.H. Hunter married Margaret Elizabeth (Diggins). They had three sons."

  "text" : "James Lewis (born 1601) was a Welsh politician who sat in the House of Commons at various times between 1624 and 1656.

He matriculated at Jesus College, Oxford on 14 March 1617, aged 15. In 1624, Lewis was elected Member of Parliament for Cardiganshire in the Short Parliament. He was re-elected MP for Cardiganshire in 1625, 1626 and 1628 and sat until 1629 when King Charles decided to rule without parliament for eleven years. Lewis was re-elected MP for Cardiganshire in April 1640 for the Short Parliament. He was a Royalist at the beginning of the Civil War, but in January 1645 was appointed one of the sequestraton committee for Cardigan, Pembroke and Carmarthen Counties. He was Colonel in a regiment of the parliamentary army and captured Newcastle Emlyn for parliament in December 1645. His regiment was ordered to be disbanded in March 1648 though it was retained a little longer. Information was laid against him on 12 February 1649 that he had fought originally for the king, had protected Royalists when on the sequestration committee and his regiment had cost the state £50,000. An order was made for his discharge on 15 March 1649 under the general act of pardon for South Wales. He was re-elected MP for Cardiganshire in 1656 for the Second Protectorate Parliament. After the Restoration he was nominated for the honour of Knight of the Royal Oak. He was High Sheriff of Cardiganshire in 1664. He was described as \"a person of inoffensive, facile constitution, forced from a Royalist to act as a colonel for King and Parliament: seldom out of publique offices, though averse to undertake any; loved more for doing no wrong, than for doing of any good\"."

  "text" : "John Mansel (1729–1794) was a British Army cavalry general killed at the Battle of Beaumont. John Mansel was born in Cosgrove, Northamptonshire, in 1729, and married Mary Anne Biggin. The couple had two sons, John, who became a major in the army, and Robert, who joined the Royal Navy and rose to the rank of rear admiral. In the army Mansel was made lieutenant-colonel commanding the 3rd Dragoon Guards on 27 April 1775 and became colonel of the regiment on 16 May 1781. Promoted to major-general on 28 April 1790, he commanded the 2nd (heavy) brigade of cavalry under the Duke of York and Albany in the Flanders Campaign from May 1793. He was at the relief of Menin on 15 September, and possibly at Sainghin on 27 October, although the heavy cavalry was apparently commanded by Prince Ernest on the day, as Mansel was not yet divisional commander. In 1794 he was with Erskine's column at Prémont on 17 April, but at the Battle of Villers-en-Cauchies on the 24th his command missed the action through a confusion in the orders that left Rudolf Ritter von Otto with just four squadrons to face 5,000 French. At Beaumont on 26 April he led the cavalry flank attack in the valley of Cawdry and completely routed a column of infantry before plunging at the head of his troops across a ravine to attack a battery of 14 cannon on the other side. \"He passed the ravine, and, at the head of a considerable body of his men, charged the cannon with inconceivable intrepidity, and complete success. His heroic conduct decided the day; but at the mouth of this battery, after having three horses shot under him, he received his death wound. One grape-shot entered his chest, fracturing his spine, and coming out between his shoulders, while another broke his arm to splinters.\" Mansel was buried in a redoubt with all military honours. Six generals—Abercrombie, Dundas, Harcourt, Garth, and Fox, who supported the pall—and the majority of senior officers of York's army attended the funeral. Craig attributed the failure of the heavy cavalry at Villers en Cauchies \"mainly to Mansel, whom after the action of the 17th [Premont] he had already reported as an incompetent officer.\" Mansel felt he was disgraced after Villers-en-Cauchies despite being reinstated, and swore not to survive. Whether he deliberately sought death or not though is disputed. Others \"seemed to feel that a brave man had been untowardly sacrificed.\""

In 1965 he became minister at Lochranza on the Isle of Arran, a post he held until his death in 1977. Dow frequently contributed to the local newspaper, the Greenock Telegraph, and was a contributor to religious programmes on the BBC including Songs of Praise and on Scottish Television (Late Call). In 1973 he wrote a fictionalised account of an encounter between James Graham, Marquess of Montrose and one John Pitcairn, Laird of Cleish in 1649, immediately before Graham's execution by the Covenanters. Dow published his autobiography in 1975, the same year he completed a history of Greenock. Dow was also a playwright, his 1962 play Tail-piece winning a national amateur dramatics competition. He was an occasional actor, which led one critic to comment that it was the first time he had heard Falstaff portrayed with a Scots accent. He also wrote a Dictionary of the Bible in 1964 which has remained in print ever since. Dow's son published a collection of his father's writings in 2001."

  "text" : "John Greene Jr. (1620 – 27 November 1708) was a deputy governor of the Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations who spent almost his entire adult life in the public service of the colony. Born in England, he was the son of John Greene and Joan Tattersall, and sailed to New England with his parents in 1635 aboard the ship James. His father, after coming from Massachusetts to Providence, became one of the original settlers of Warwick. In 1652 Greene served in his first public role as a commissioner from Warwick, and served in some public capacity every year until 1690 when he was first chosen as deputy governor of the colony. He then served 10 consecutive one-year terms in this capacity, retiring from public service in 1700 at the age of 80. He was one of the 10 Assistants named in the Royal Charter of 1663, which would become the basis for Rhode Island's government for nearly two centuries. During the devastating events of King Phillips War, Greene was one of 16 prominent inhabitants of the colony whose counsel was sought by the General Assembly. Greene died in Warwick on 27 November 1708 and was buried on the Spring Greene Farm (later the property of Governor Theodore F. Green) in Warwick. Greene married Ann Almy, the daughter of William and Audry (Barlow) Almy. They had 11 children, the youngest of whom, Samuel, married Mary Gorton, a granddaughter of Rhode Island colonial president Samuel Gorton. Their grandson, William Greene served for 11 one-year terms as a governor of the colony, and their great-grandson, also named William Greene was a governor of the State of Rhode Island. John and Ann Greene are also ancestors of United States President Warren G. Harding, as well as inventor Thomas A. Edison, Canadian politician and religious leader Nathan Eldon Tanner, cowboy artist and inventor Earl W. Bascom and Hollywood actor John Wayne."

Sailing from England with his family in 1635, he first settled in Salem in the Massachusetts Bay Colony, but had difficulty with the Puritan authority, and soon followed Roger Williams to Providence, becoming one of the original proprietors of that town. In 1643 he joined Samuel Gorton and ten others in purchasing land that would become the town of Warwick. Difficulties with Massachusetts ensued, until he accompanied Gorton on a trip to England where they secured royal recognition of their town. Once Warwick became safe from external threats, Greene became active in its government, serving on the town council, being Deputy to the General Court of the colony, and serving as magistrate of the General Court of Trials. He died in the last days of 1658, being survived by his wife and six grown children, and becoming the ancestor of many prominent citizens."

He was arrested and detained without trial for three and a half years and died four years after being released. Seroney defended the independence of Parliament at a time when it was becoming an arm of the Executive. He worked hard to introduce Bills that would remove or at least check the excessive powers vested in the President as a result of the numerous amendments to the Kenya Constitution. He also brought in the first Private Member's Bill to help ensure that Kenya's elections were free, fair and inclusive. He decried what he described as the wanton abuse of power by the Executive and condemned corruption in Kenya, the unfair distribution of national wealth, theft of land from the poor by the ruling elite, failure to resettle the landless and so forth. He soon made powerful enemies, and his detention in harsh prison conditions set in motion the events that eventually led to his death."

  "text" : "Jonathan Berry (1787 – 26 August 1878) was a settler and businessman in New Brunswick, Canada. Berry emigrated in 1826 and by 1840, he was well established as a pioneer settler. He added land and a water-driven sawmill to his endeavors. The mill began to make a lasting impact on the economy of the region. Lumber was supplied for local construction, shipbuilding and the railroads. A grist mill was also added. The community of Berry Mills, New Brunswick grew out of Berry's efforts and stands as an important reminder of the pioneer in the development of the country."

  "text" : "Jean Arfel (born 14 June 1920 in Libourne – dead 31 July 2013), better known by his pen name Jean Madiran was a French nationalist and a traditionalist Catholic writer. He has also used the pen name Jean-Louis Lagor. During the German occupation of France, Madiran was the private secretary of Charles Maurras and was awarded the Order of the Francisque, the decoration, in the form of a stylised double-headed francisca, that was granted by Vichy France. He contributed to the newspaper Action Française. This was the organ of the movement of the same name and was published from 21 March 1908 to 24 August 1944.After the Second World War, he retired to Madiran in southwestern France (whence his pen name) and became noted as a journalist and essayist. In 1948, he published his first book, La Philosophie politique de saint Thomas (The Political Philosophy of Saint Thomas), under the pen name Jean-Louis Lagor and with a preface by Maurras. In 1956 Madiran and Louis Salleron co-founded Itinéraires, a review of Catholic themes which later became a leading organ for criticism of the reforms within the Catholic Church after the Second Vatican Council of 1962–65.Itinéraires originally appeared monthly, but after the 1988 Ecône Consecrations became quarterly. Madiran remained its editor until publication ceased in 1996. He was also one of the founders in 1982 of the daily newspaper Présent, of which he was editor in chief. This publication is associated with the Front National, but refused to take sides in the conflict between Jean-Marie Le Pen and Bruno Mégret, whereupon Le Pen called for it to be boycotted. In an article published in Itinéraires, Madiran declared: If we are asked to state what we are and what our position is, our answer must be understood. Our answer modifies François Brigneau's formula or rather completes and develops it in its full truth: \"We are to the right of the far right.\" This does not mean that we despise indiscriminately everybody and everything that official jargon calls \"the far right\". Here again we reject the arbitrary left-wing attitude that inspires and imposes a classification at variance with the truth. In reality there is no extremism, right-wing or other, in wishing a society based on \"Work-Family-Fatherland\", \"Serve God First\". On 6 February 1995, the fiftieth anniversary of the execution, for collaboration with the German occupation, of Robert Brasillach, the poet, writer and journalist supporter of Action Française, Madiran, with François Brigneau and others, organised a meeting in Paris, at which Madiran declared: \"Young people who are here this evening, we entrust to your hands the remembrance of the National Revolution, we entrust to you the remembrance of the France that awaits, hopes for and desires its liberation.\""

  "text" : "Joseph A. Travis is an American Professor of Biological Science and past Dean of the College of Arts & Sciences at Florida State University. His research studies the ecology of natural selection using experimental techniques. His studies focus on a number of specific problems ranging from the differences in inflorescence size among populations of the flypoison lily, Zigadenus (Amianthium) muscatoxicus in Virginia to the striking divergence in body size in north Florida populations of the sailfin molly, Poecilia latipinna. Populations of least killifish vary widely in density as well as in the form and amplitude of their fluctuations in population density, and in recent work Travis has identified which ecological factors are responsible for these differences in density regimes and what might be their cascading effects. He also is part of a large team of scientists, led by David Reznick of the University of California, Riverside, that is investigating how adaptation in Trinidadian guppies, Poecilia reticulata, alters how guppies interact with their predators and creates cascading effects on energy flow through the mountain stream ecosystem. He received his Ph.D. from Duke University in 1980. He is a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, and in 2005 he served as President of the American Society of Naturalists. In 2011 he won the E. O. Wilson Naturalist Award from the American Society of Naturalists. The award \"is given to an active investigator in mid-career who has made significant contributions to the knowledge of a particular ecosystem or group of organisms.\" Along with colleague Michael Ruse he is co-editor of Evolution: The First Four Billion Years (Belknap Press of Harvard University Press 2009, ISBN 978-0-674-03175-3)."

A South Australian Teal Cup representative under the coaching of four-time Magarey Medallist and SANFL legend Russell Ebert, Mail played as a rover, forward and defender and was selected by Adelaide at #27 in the 1993 Pre-Season Draft. Mail made his AFL debut against Fitzroy at Football Park in Round 10 of the 1994 AFL season and marked an impressive debut with 11 kicks, 5 marks and 4 handballs. He went on to play in the next three games for the Crows during the season but couldn't cement his place in the side, instead playing most of the season with North Adelaide."

  "text" : "Jean-Nicolas Marjolin (6 December 1780 – 4 March 1850) was a French surgeon and pathologist born in Ray-sur-Saône, Haute-Saône. His name is associated with a malady known as Marjolin's ulcer. After a brief stint in the French military, he attached himself to a physician, a friend of the family who allowed Marjolin to attend Commercy Hospital as a student. In 1800 he relocated to Paris with a letter of recommendation from Alexis Boyer (1757–1833). Here he became a favoured disciple of Guillaume Dupuytren (1777–1835). In 1803 he gained his internship, followed by promotions as an anatomy assistant (1805) and prosector (1806). In 1808 he earned his medical doctorate, and two years later opened an amphitheater on Rue des Rats (today- Rue Colbert). Here he taught classes that numbered more than 200 pupils. In 1816 he was appointed second surgeon at the Hôtel-Dieu de Paris with Dupuytren as departmental head. By this time Marjolin's relationship with Dupuytren had soured, eventually leading to bitter hatred between the two men. In 1818 he was chosen professor of external pathology ahead of esteemed candidates that included Philibert Joseph Roux (1780–1854), Dominique Larrey (1766–1842) and Jules Germain Cloquet (1790–1883). For the next thirty two years he maintained the chair of external pathology. His final days were spent in retirement at Clichy, where he pursued his hobby attending to trees and flowers. In 1820 he became a member of the Académie de Médecine, and in 1830 was chosen consultant surgeon to Louis-Philippe. His son, René, married Cornelia Scheffer, daughter of painter Ary Scheffer (1795–1858)."

Throughout his life he moved many times and seems to have struggled financially. His work however never seems lacking.Top experts (such as E. Vatelot, Bernard Millant, J.F. Raffin, Paul Childs), agree that Eury's work is often compared to that of François Tourte. \"Niccolò Paganini's favorite bow was a Jacob Eury which was broken in several places when it fell off the back of his coach on tour (as he was travelling in England towards Newcastle). Paganini had taken it to Jean-Baptiste Vuillaume for repairs as they were good friends. He went on to use this bow extensively.\" - Gennady Filimonov"

  "text" : "Joseph Wiszowaty was born in 1970 in Sauk Village, Illinois, the youngest of 8 children to Eugene Wiszowaty (1930–1970) and Anna Wiszowaty (1931–1991). Wiszowaty attended Strassburg Elementary School and Admiral H. G. Rickover Junior High School and graduated from Marian Catholic High School in Chicago Heights, Illinois. Wiszowaty was 18 years old in 1988, when he announced he was running for Village Trustee in his hometown of Sauk Village. On April 4, 1989, many Chicago media outlets descended on Sauk Village to cover the election of Joseph Wiszowaty, a high school student who was elected to the Village Board of Trustees, and became the youngest man elected in the State of Illinois. Wiszowaty ran on a \"change\" platform and would in fact bring that change to the Village Board. Because of much national and local media attention, the media would descend again on May 9, 1989, to cover Wiszowaty being sworn in as a Trustee. Wiszowaty would find himself voting against the administration on many issues during his term in office. Wiszowaty made a presentation to the owners of the Chicago Bears to build a new stadium on the property that was proposed for the GM-Saturn plant (Currently the LogisiCenter), after securing economic commitment to expand the Enterprise Zone from the administration of Chicago Heights. The Chicago Bears declined the proposal and opted to stay in Chicago with commitments for a newer more modern stadium. Wiszowaty served his term from 1989 to 1993, then would challenge incumbent mayor Mark Collins but lost in a three-way race. Wiszowaty would have been the youngest mayor Sauk Village ever elected had he succeeded, but holds the distinction of being the youngest candidate for Village Mayor in Sauk Village history. A petition to have Wiszowaty run again for the village board was circulated in 1995 by supporters, which likely would have led to another run for Mayor again in 1997 as the incumbent Mayor was defeated, Wiszowaty chose not to seek election to his old seat on the Village Board. Wiszowaty was married at St. John the Evangelist Parish in St. John, Indiana on August 24, 2002 and now has 2 children. Wiszowaty still remains committed to his hometown of Sauk Village."

  "text" : "John Coggeshall, Jr. (c. 1624 - 1 October 1708) was a deputy governor of the Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations. The son of Rhode Island President John Coggeshall, he was raised in the village of Castle Hedingham in northeastern Essex where his father was a merchant. Aged about eight, he sailed from England with his parents and surviving siblings, arriving in New England in 1632. He was first active in civil affairs in 1653 when he became treasurer of the island towns of Portsmouth and Newport. The following year brought the re-unification of the colony, with the island towns rejoining the government with Providence and Warwick, and he served as treasurer of the four towns for a year. His name appears on a list of Newport freemen in 1655, and for the following 35 years he served almost continuously in one or multiple roles including Assistant, General Treasurer, Deputy, General Recorder, and Major for the Island. He was one of ten Assistants named in the Royal Charter of 1663, which would become the basis for Rhode Island's government for nearly two centuries. In 1686 he became the Deputy Governor under Governor Walter Clarke, but his term lasted only a month when the English crown assigned Edmund Andros to be Governor of all the New England colonies under the Dominion of New England. Following the demise of this dominion and the arrest of Andros in 1689, Coggeshall was once again selected as Deputy Governor for the year ending in May 1690, serving under Governor Henry Bull. In April 1676, during King Philip's War, he was on a committee to procure boats for the colony's defense. Later that year, in August, he was a member of a court martial for the trial of several Indians. Coggeshall had 16 children with three different wives. IN 1647 he married his first wife, Elizabeth Baulston, the daughter of magistrate William Baulston, and this marriage ended in a divorce which was granted by the Assembly in 1655. Elizabeth then married Thomas Gould, and Coggeshall was married later that year to Patience Throckmorton. This marriage produced nine children and lasted until her death in 1676, after which he married a wife named Mary (Hedge) Sturgis, with whom he had four more children. Coggeshall wrote a will in June 1708, and died on 1 October of that year."

  "text" : "Jack Danckert (10 July 1922 – 26 January 2000) was an Australian rules footballer who played with South Melbourne in the Victorian Football League (VFL) during the 1940s. Danckert was a defender who was unable put together regular appearances while at South Melbourne, never playing more than five games in a single season. He played as a half back flanker in the 1945 VFL Grand Final against Carlton, in what was just his ninth league appearance. The grand final, which South Melbourne lost, is referred to as being a \"Bloodbath\" and Danckert was one of the victims when he was felled by Carlton ruckman Rod McLean. He didn't feature at all in the 1946 VFL season and played just four games in 1947. The following year he signed with Victorian Football Association (VFA) club Williamstown and made 64 appearances for them in three seasons. Danckert was a back pocket defender in Williamstown's 1949 premiership team and won their \"Best and Fairest\" award in 1950. He was a VFA representative at the 1950 Brisbane Carnival. Danckert later joined the administration of the Mordialloc Football Club, and became one of its two delegates to the VFA Board of Management. Famously as delegate, Danckert was unable to attend the VFA meeting on 2 December 1960 to lodge Mordialloc's second vote against partitioning of the Association into two divisions, because his wife was expecting their child that night; the change was ultimately passed by exactly the three-quarters majority it required, and Danckert's vote (or that of a proxy, which the club failed to arrange) could have defeated the motion."

He was educated at Hanley High School where he won several scholarships including free admission to New College in Oxford. He was one of the most respected members of the British Region of the Biometric Society. In 1951, John G. Skellam developed the reaction-diffusion model of invasion biology. This model describes the dynamics of populations, which simultaneously develops and spreads, and provides that the invasion front moves with constant speed. He explained on the basis of habitation muskrat introduced to Europe that only by chance the species may be in a place where it would have to grow. Skellam has provided a model that allows to take the dynamics of populations as a random variable at any time t. Its stochastic form is much more flexible than previous deterministic equations. He was principal scientific officer and editor of the \"Biometrics\", the official organ of Biometric Society, an international association headquarters in London."

  "text" : "jack green (the name was spelled with lower-case letters) is the pseudonym of Christopher Carlisle Reid (born 1928), an American literary critic who was a great defender of the work of William Gaddis. Reid—who took the name from a racing form after he quit his job to become a freelance critic—particularly admired Gaddis' 1955 novel The Recognitions, which flopped upon being published. Reid/green believed that the commercial failure of the hardcover edition of Gaddis' novel was the result of it having been panned by literary critics. Reid/green's faith in Gaddis was borne out when The Recognitions was chosen as one of TIME magazine's 100 best novels from 1923 to 2005. (According to literary sleuth Don Foster, an English professor at Vassar College, jack green's name actually is John Carlisle. Carlisle was the son of novelist Helen Grace Carlisle and worked as an actuarial clerk at Metropolitan Life Insurance until 1957, when he quit his job.) As jack green, Reid started a self-published fanzine called newspaper dedicated to the work of Gaddis. In the first edition of the 'zine, green claimed that The Recognitions was the greatest book of all time. After meeting Gaddis, green wrote an article called Fire the bastards! for newspaper #12 that fiercely denounced the literary critics whom he believes doomed the novel with their bad reviews. In 1962, he also took out a full-page ad in The Village Voice heralding the paperback edition of The Recognitions (in which he again took a swipe at the critics). Many in the literary scene mistakenly thought \"jack green\" was a pseudonym for Gaddis himself, while others believed that Gaddis paid for Green's ad. In 1992, Dalkey Archive Press published Fire the Bastards! in book form, without green's knowledge or permission (because it was in the Public Domain), with an introduction by Gaddis scholar Steven Moore. Dalkey reissued it in paperback in 2012. He was tangentially involved in the Wanda Tinasky letters imbroglio when one of the letters claimed that Gaddis and Thomas Pynchon were one and the same person. The Tinasky letters had been believed to be the work of Pynchon, but later were shown to be the work of poet Tom Hawkins by Dr. Don Foster, the Vassar English professor who unmasked Joe Klein as the author of Primary Colors. In 1963, Hawkins self-published a paperback book that sold for $1 entitled Eve, the Common Muse of Henry Miller & Lawrence Durrell, that also addressed Gaddis and green. Hawkins insisted that Gaddis and green were the same person. In the Wanda Tinasky letters published in the 1980s, Hawkins continued to insist that Gaddis and green were one and the same, and also claimed that Gaddis/green had written the works of Pynchon. In 1986, Hawkins as Tinasky again claimed that jack green \"...did pretty well in the auctorial line with novels published commercially under the names of William Gaddis and Thomas Pynchon.\" Foster proved that Hawkins, who was already dead, was Wanda Tinasky via textual analysis."

  "text" : "John Charles Bryan (November 12, 1934 – February 1, 2007) was an American newspaper publisher, editor and journalist who was best known for founding and running the Los Angeles alternative newspaper Open City. The son of a Cleveland, Ohio newspaperman, the Cleveland-born Bryan worked as a journalist for a wide variety of major newspapers: the San Diego Tribune, the Los Angeles Mirror, the Los Angeles Herald Examiner, the Houston Post, the Houston Chronicle, the San Francisco Chronicle, and the San Francisco Examiner. He quit The San Francisco Chronicle in 1964 in order to found the tabloid weekly Open City Press. Open City Press covered San Francisco's bohemian community. Bryan published 15 issues between November 18, 1964 to March 17–23, 1965. Open City Press was a local forerunner of the Berkeley Barb, providing coverage of the Free Speech Movement. It was a one-man operation. In the beginning Bryan bought a case of metal monotype and hand-set his own copy, pulling proofs to paste up for cheap offset reproduction."

  "text" : "John Joseph \"J.J.\" Stewart MBE (18 July 1923 – 15 November 2002) was a New Zealand rugby union coach and administrator, and secondary school teacher. His obituary said that in 1973 when he took over as All Blacks coach, he was the right man at the right time for a team that was scarred and in crisis from a home loss to the British Lions in 1971, a controversial British tour in 1972-73 and a cancelled Springbok tour in 1973. Stewart was New Zealand selector and All Black coach from 1973 to 1976. For the tour of Australia in 1974 he ditched many stalwarts, picking Andy Leslie as captain and 15 new caps including Bryan Williams and Bruce Robertson. Later Williams said he was a breath of fresh air, Tane Norton said he brought a new era to our game, and Laurie Mains said he could always think outside the square. He prepared All Black teams for 11 tests from 1973 to 1976; and left with six wins, one draw and four losses (three in South Africa in 1976, against a rampant Springbok side)He had been a provincial coach in Taranaki (1963–69) (the province held the Ranfurly Shield for three years) and Wanganui (1970–71), and a secondary school coach in Taranaki. He was North Island selector in 1972 and 1977, and on the New Zealand Rugby Football Union council from 1985 to 1990. He was born in Northcote, Auckland and died (of cancer) in New Plymouth. He was educated at Monte Cecelia and Sacred Heart colleges in Auckland, Auckland University College, Auckland Teachers' Training College and Massey University (BA). He earned a degree at 71, and was a Massey University councillor for 12 years. He was a teacher at New Plymouth Boys' High School from 1948 to 1969, then Principal of Flock House near Bulls from 1969 to 1983. He stood as Labour candidate in the 1978 Rangitikei by-election, in a traditional National seat that was won by Bruce Beetham for Social Credit. He also stood in the 1978 election, for Tarawera. He married Claire Campbell in 1961; she was later a mayor of New Plymouth. They left a daughter and four sons. Stewart was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire in the 1983 Queen's Birthday Honours."

Jinro became the first non-Korean to reach the semi-finals in GSL Season 3. Jinro then went on to reach the semi-finals a second time. So far, Jinro is the only foreigner to reach the Ro4 in GSL. In November 2010 he won the Major League Gaming Starcraft 2 tournament in Dallas. His nickname comes from the Korean distiller Jinro. On August 7, 2012, Jinro retired from pro-gaming."

  "text" : "Joseph Hurd Connell FAA (born October 5, 1923) is an American ecologist. He earned his MA degree in zoology at the University of California, Berkeley and his PhD at Glasgow University. Connell’s first research paper examined the effects of interspecific competition and predation on populations of a barnacle species on the rocky shores of Scotland. According to Connell, this classic paper is often cited because it addressed ecological topics that previously had been given minor roles. Together, with a subsequent barnacle study on the influence of competition and desiccation, these two influential papers have laid the foundation for future research and the findings continue to have relevance to current ecology. His early work earned him a Guggenheim fellowship in 1962 and the George Mercer Award in 1963. In 2010, a Symposium was held in his honour by the Ecological Society of America said that \"Connell’s observations, insights, syntheses, and example have motivated education and research in population and community ecology for over six decades\". Among his important works are the Connell–Slatyer model of ecological succession (facilitation, tolerance and inhibition) and the Janzen-Connell hypothesis that explains plant-species diversity in tropical forests. Other notable works are his 1978 intermediate disturbance hypothesis and his thirty-year study of corals in the Great Barrier Reef. He is a corresponding member of the Australian Academy of Science, a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and a Guggenheim fellow, and has received the Eminent Ecologist Award from the Ecological Society of America. He is a professor emeritus at the University of California Santa Barbara. Connell was elected to the Australian Academy of Science in 2002 as a Corresponding Fellow."

  "text" : "James Rahilly (born 15 June 1979) is a former Australian rules footballer who played with Geelong in the Australian Football League (AFL). He is currently serving as an assistant coach with the Geelong Football Club. Rahilly played his early football at South Warrnambool but was recruited from the Geelong Falcons in the TAC Cup. A defender, he received a 1998 AFL Rising Star nomination in his sixth league game, against Carlton at the MCG, where he had 22 disposals. Although Geelong made it into the final in three of the seasons he was at the club, Rahilly was never selected for a finals game. Rahilly was, however, a member of the Geelong reserves team which won the 2002 Victorian Football League (VFL) premiership and was awarded the Norm Goss Memorial Medal for his efforts in the grand final. He also won Geelong's \"Best Clubman\" award, in 2003. He returned to the VFL in 2008 as an assistant coach and was then appointed to Chris Scott's senior coaching staff for the 2011 AFL season."

Baird, a defender, was promoted from the Kangaroos rookie list to play 14 games with the club in the 2002 AFL season. The previous year he had played a big part in Box Hill winning their first top division Victorian Football League (VFL) premiership, with a Norm Goss Memorial Medal winning performance in the grand final. A regular fixture in the Kangaroos side during the 2003 season, Baird played in the first 20 rounds and earned the only Brownlow vote of his career when he kept Nick Riewoldt goal-less at the MCG. He spent much of the 2004 and 2005 playing with North Melbourne's then VFL-affiliate Port Melbourne. After being delisted at the end of 2005, Baird played for Port Adelaide in the 2006 SANFL season. He returned to Port Melbourne, which was by now a stand-alone VFL club not affiliated with any AFL club, in 2007 and two years later he was appointed club captain. In 2011 he captained Port Melbourne to the VFL premiership, and the team won all 21 games for the season, making it a perfect season."

The son of Colonel Joseph Whipple who was also a merchant, Whipple was born in Providence, the third of 12 children. He was a ship-owner, dealing in many goods including slaves, and he often traded illicitly with the Spanish and French who were at war with the British. He was considered the wealthiest member of his extended family of merchants, though the full value of his estate is not found in the public record. In addition to being very wealthy, he married into wealth as well. His first wife, Anne Almy, bore four of his children, all of whom died as infants, she dying less than two weeks after her last child died. He then married Sarah Redwood, the daughter of probable business partner, Abraham Redwood. Redwood was a merchant, ship-owner, slave-owner and philanthropist who had a large and profitable plantation on Antigua in the West Indies. He was the founder of the Redwood Library in Newport. With Sarah, Whipple had nine children, the second of whom, Joseph III became Deputy Governor at a very young age, following his father's death. Whipple's will was dated May 28, 1750, and proved on July 2 following, suggesting that he died in June 1750."

The son of Deputy Governor Joseph Whipple, Jr. who was a very wealthy merchant, Whipple was born in Newport, the second of nine children. He must have had very good political connections because he became Deputy Governor at the remarkable age of 25, but two years later he became financially insolvent, and was forced to give up his position in 1753. He had to sell the farm left to him in his father's will and liquidate other properties to pay his debts. Many ship owners went bankrupt in the middle of the 18th century. The use of paper money got part of the blame for this, but the protracted war with Spain and France had a major impact on commerce. The young and inexperienced Whipple had not yet developed the business acumen to avert these financial difficulties. After resigning his position as Deputy Governor in 1753, Whipple led a short and anguished life. In 1761, his obituary in the local newspaper, the Newport Mercury, stated \"Joseph Whipple, former Dep.Govr. Facted, became intemperate, and was drowned from the Point Bridge, while returning from the theatre on the Point.\" He is not known to have ever married, nor have any children."

Zee hosts All on the Line, a fashion series on the Sundance Channel. In each episode, Zee acts a business consultant to a designer who is struggling. He appeared on an episode of Ugly Betty, Mistresses, and General Hospital as himself.He is one of the co-hosts of the ABC daytime talk show The Fab Life. He is the author of the forthcoming book That's What Fashion Is: Lessons and Stories from My Nonstop, Mostly Glamorous Life in Style (2015).

He is best remembered for adapting, with Clemence Randolph, Somerset Maugham's novella Rain into a 1922 smash hit play starring Jeanne Eagels. He wrote the original play, The Shanghai Gesture, produced on Broadway in 1926. He excelled at writing plays dealing with Americans in far-off lands, an experience Colton knew firsthand from his early youth in Japan. With these huge successes Colton was lured to Hollywood, primarily MGM, where he wrote intertitles for some silent films and scenarios for others. In the talking film era he wrote numerous screenplays. Colton suffered a stroke in 1945. He died of a second stroke in Gainesville, Texas in 1946. Colton, a gay man, never married."

  "text" : "Julie Rotblatt-Amrany (born July 23, 1958) is an American sculptor and painter identified with the resurgence of the figure in modern art. Rebelling against the academic bias against figurative art in the 1970s and 1980s, she has brought new vitality to the subject of the human form by integrating into her work recent discoveries in astronomy, physics, and medicine. Her pieces often juxtapose polar opposites such as serenity and tension, and are underpinned philosophically by a view of the universe as a process of endless transformation, with no true beginnings or ends. She has produced a wide array of public art, honoring figures from veterans to sports and film icons to astronauts, while simultaneously creating more experimental paintings and sculptures that explore her personal vision. She is co-founder of the Fine Art Studio of Rotblatt-Amrany in Fort Sheridan, Illinois, a studio that brings to the United States the aims and traditions of the ateliers of Europe, as well as The Julia Foundation, a not-for-profit arts organization."

  "text" : "Jarena Lee (February 11, 1783 – 1855?) was a 19th-century African-American woman who left behind an eloquent account of her religious experience. The publishing of her autobiography made Lee the first African American woman to have an autobiography published in the United States. She was also the first woman authorized to preach by Richard Allen, founder of the African Methodist Episcopal Church, in 1819. Despite Allen's blessing, Lee continued to face hostility to her ministry because she was black and a woman. She became a traveling minister, traveling thousands of miles on foot. In one year alone, she \"travelled two thousand three hundred and twenty-five miles, and preached one hundred and seventy-eight sermons.\" Lee’s importance is threefold. First, she exemplifies the 19th-century American religious movement’s focus on personal holiness and sanctification. Second, she left a detailed account of her life of faith that serves as a valuable primary source. Third, she became an eloquent witness to her faith and a pioneer for women seeking license to preach in the Methodist traditions."

In 2011, she was under investigation by both St George's Hospital and UNISON for running a private health consultancy called 'The Pilgrim Way' on the side, creating a conflict of interests. The outcome of this investigation is unknown. After this discovery, full-time taxpayer-funded trade union officials have become known as \"Pilgrims\", with an Early Day Motion being introduced to the House of Commons condemning such practices. David Morris MP has raised the issue with the Health Secretary, while Alok Sharma MP asked a question of the Prime Minister. David Cameron responded that \"It's nice work if you can get it!\" Sharma has also sent Freedom of Information requests to all local councils to uncover how many \"Pilgrims\" are employed in local government, with the replies indicating at least £35m a year being spent, Calling herself a 'peace and love' activist, the Daily Mail has reported that Pilgrim is the leader of a thirty-person commune in Kingston upon Thames. She has since joined the Green Party. In 2009, she had been criticised for sending staff on \"shopping jaunts\", so-called \"service safaris\", to John Lewis to find out about good service."

  "text" : "Jean Richardot the Younger (Mechelen 7 October 1570 - Cambrai 28 February 1614) was bishop of Arras (1602–1609) and prince-archbishop of Cambrai, duke of Cambrai and count of the Cambrésis (1609–1614). He served the Archdukes Albert and Isabella as a diplomat and a minister. Jean Richardot the Younger was the eldest son of Jean Richardot, a close collaborator of the governor-general Alexander Farnese and one of the principal ministers and diplomats of the Archdukes Albert and Isabella, and of Anne Courcol de Baillencourt. Educated by the Jesuits at their college in Trier, he studied law at the universities of Trier and Salamanca. Destined for an ecclesiastical career, his father secured him the appointment as prior of the Benedictine priory of Morteau at the age of 16. It was also thanks to his father's patronage that he entered the Privy Council, one of the three Collateral Councils advising the governors-general of the Spanish Netherlands in 1595. On 15 May 1600, the Archdukes appointed Jean Richardot their first resident minister at the Papal Court. In the course of his diplomatic mission, Richardot alerted Archduke Albert to the talents of Peter Paul Rubens and Wenceslas Cobergher. Following the death of Cardinal Andrew of Austria in November 1600, Richardot obtained the Benedictine abbey of Lure. Three years later the Archdukes appointed him bishop of Arras. He was consecrated in Rome on 30 April 1603 and made his solemn entry in Arras in February 1604. Shortly before his father's death, he was named archbishop of Cambrai on 17 August 1609. He died there after a long illness in 1614."

  "text" : "James C. Newman is an American engineer and materials scientist known for his work on fracture and fatigue for aerospace vehicles. NASA has listed him as a \"Superstar of Modern Aeronautics\". He is also known for his work in safety analysis of structures, and pioneered the finite element studies of planar cracks in three-dimensional finite bodies, and the development of extensive stress intensity factor equations. These solutions are now considered to be classic contributions to Fracture Mechanics, and are used as benchmarks for new crack stress analysis methods. His work is also used for modeling of fatigue crack growth under aircraft spectrum loading. He developed the theory and software (FASTRAN), which is widely used in aircraft industry. In 2001, Dr. Newman left NASA for a professorship at Mississippi State University. There, he has developed a Fatigue and Fracture Laboratory and a new ASTM fracture standard (E-2472)]. A majority of the stress-intensity-factor solutions for crack configurations in the ASTM fatigue-crack growth and fracture standards were developed by Dr. Newman. His stress-intensity-factor solutions and equations for three-dimensional crack configurations, such as surface cracks and corner cracks at holes, are used by aerospace, nuclear and piping industries world-wide. His life-prediction model and code (FASTRAN) is used world-wide to make life assessments of damaged aircraft structures. His crack-closure model is also one of the life-prediction options in NASGRO, a life-prediction code, which is also used world-wide. His life-prediction code was successfully used to predict the onset of widespread fatigue damage in simulated aircraft fuselage components during the NASA/FAA aging aircraft studies in the 1990s. He has pioneered the use of the critical crack-tip-opening-angle (CTOA) fracture criterion for aircraft structures, which was successfully used by Boeing-Long Beach to predict the residual strength of a damaged fuselage structure tested at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base within 5% of the failure pressure. Recently, he has promoted the use of the compression precracking test methods to generate fatigue-crack-growth threshold data without load-history effects."

  "text" : "Jonathan Lee (born 24 April 1981) is a British writer best known as the author of the novels Who Is Mr Satoshi?, Joy, and High Dive. The Guardian has described Lee as \"a major new voice in British fiction.\" On publication Who Is Mr Satoshi was reviewed by the British press. The Observer called it 'elegant and incisive', The Independent said it was a 'masterful first novel', The Daily Telegraph called it a 'funny, insightful and beautiful' and the Daily Mail described the novel as 'dream-like ... an unusual, playful and clever book. The novel was also praised by several well-known literary fiction writers, including Giles Foden, author of The Last King Of Scotland, who called it 'funny and moving'. Who Is Mr Satoshi was a runner up in the Edinburgh Festival's First Book Award 2010 and led to Jonathan Lee being shortlisted for the Desmond Elliott Prize for literature 2011. The author's agents, Aitken Alexander Associates Ltd, state on their website that Jonathan Lee was born in Surrey in 1981, graduated from the University of Bristol with a First in English Literature and was working as a solicitor when he wrote his debut novel. Lee's second novel, Joy, was released in June 2012. It was widely reviewed, with the Observer declaring that it is 'exquisitely and surprisingly written ... it proves that Lee is a significant talent', the Literary Review saying it is 'an enormously impressive piece of storytelling' and Henry Sutton writing in The Mirror that ‘Lee’s the real deal – a British writer on the cusp of greatness ... A brilliant & powerful dissection of modern Britain’ . Booker Prize shortlisted author A.D. Miller said that ‘with its supple prose, ingenious structure, wit & slow-burn sympathy, Joy is a sly miracle of a novel’. However, some reviewers such as the reviewer on the Book Oxygen blog were far more critical, arguing that the book is unnecessarily 'complex and demanding' and can at times 'feel like a product'. An article in The Guardian alleged that Joy was inspired by the death of an ex-colleague of Lee's in 2007, while Lee was working as a lawyer at the same law company. After the publication of Joy, Lee won a Society of Authors K Blundell Trust Award and was long listed for the Sunday Times EFG Short Story Award. High Dive, Lee's third novel, was published in the UK in 2015 and re-imagined events surrounding the Brighton hotel bombing by the Provisional Irish Republican Army in 1984, an attempt to assassinate then Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher The Sunday Times called it \"an extraordinary performance: vividly written, painfully human and fully fleshing the inner lives of its characters\". The Guardian, after publishing a review by Jake Arnott, named it among their \"books of the year\" and stated that it was \"a multi-voiced epic that leads towards a stunning finale.\" The Independent, in its review, called Lee \"a wordsmith of incomparable eloquence\" and also chose it as one of their books of the year. Not all critics were as positive. A negative review of the novel was published in the Financial Times, which argued that \"the novel suffers from some bum notes ... the thoughts of the characters meander in ways that aren’t always interesting or revealing.\" In an interview with Mariella Frostrup for the BBC, Lee defended his decision to tell the story of the real-life bombing through largely fictional characters. For the release of High Dive in the United States by Alfred A. Knopf in 2016, the book was chosen by Barnes & Noble for their \"Discover Great New Writers\" program and was selected as a New York Times Editors' Choice. The book was widely reviewed. Jennifer Senior reviewed it for The New York Times and Thomas Mallon wrote about the book for The New Yorker. Review coverage also appeared in The Atlantic, The Washington Post, the Wall Street Journal, and other newspapers and magazines. In an interview with The Independent in 2015 Lee stated that he relocated to New York from London in 2012. The author's Twitter page states that he currently lives in Brooklyn. In an interview for The Paris Review in 2016 the author stated that he is working on another book. In May 2016 it was reported in The Hollywood Reporter that Lee's novel High Dive was being adapted into a feature film by Director Brian Kirk."

In 1906 he left Alaska permanently, returning with his family to Philadelphia. He served as rector of St. Ambrose's Church. He also earned a degree in medicine from Temple University School of Medicine, graduating in 1909. He continued as a lecturer in medical history at Temple University until 1929.

Though he promoted his idea during the following years, the IOC at first was not in favour of building up additional international multisports events. They told Rosenzopf they were afraid of overloading the sports calendar for young people and feared the costs being too high. However, in July 2007 the IOC declared the introduction of the Olympic Games for young people. Finally, in November 2010 the IOC conceded Rosenzopf being the initiator of the idea of the Youth Olympic Games: Jacques Rogge, President of the IOC, declared in an official statement that Rosenzopf \"made a major contribution and provided significant impetus to the global vision of creating Youth Olympic Games\"."

He worked in his native city until 1442, when he was called to Naples by Alfonso V of Aragon. he had a deep influence on the local school, including artists such as Colantonio, and in 1445 he returned to Valencia. One year later he was again in Italy, again by the king's request. In that occasion he visited Rome and Tivoli, where he knew cardinal Alfonso Borgia, the future pope Calixtus III. In 1451 he was back to Valencia, remaining there for the rest of his life. His style did not absorb the influences of Italian Renaissance, but kept the strong influence of Early Netherlandish painting. He left an altarpiece in the church of Santa Maria della Pace, now lost. Jacomart's only documented work is the Retable of Catì, a late work (1460) in collaboration with his follower Juan Reixach. Other works are only attributed, such as the Borgia Triptych in the Collegiate church of Játiva, and the panels with St. Benedict and St. Ildephonsus in the Cathedral of Valencia."

He was born in Jedburgh, the youngest son of John Ainslie, a druggist, Writer to the Signet and burgess of the burgh and was educated at Jedburgh Grammar School. He began his career as an apprentice to the \"Geographer to King George III\", engraver and publisher Thomas Jefferys and worked as a surveyor and engraver for the English County series of maps. After Jefferys' death he returned to Scotland where he surveyed Scottish counties, engraving and publishing the maps.His primary focus was on the coasts and islands of Scotland. The quality of his maps challenged others to improve their mapping style making maps more clear and easy to read. From 1787 to 1789 Ainslie worked on a new nine sheet map of Scotland publishing it in 1789. The map was a landmark in the improvement of the outline of Scotland and for the first time showed the Great Glen as a straight line and Skye, Mull, and Islay shown with more accuracy than had previously been seen. He worked as a surveyor on several civil engineering projects including the Forth and Clyde canal with Robert Whitworth, Charles Rennie on Saltcoats harbour and the Glasgow to Ardrossan canal. On the side John was a book seller which helped him in writing and publishing works of his own. He wrote the standard text for his profession, the \"Comprehensive treatise on Land Surveying comprising the Theory and Practice of all its Branches\". On 27 October 1776 he married Christian, the daughter and heiress of Jedburgh merchant Thomas Caverhill. He died in Edinburgh on the 29 February 1828 and is buried at Jedburgh Abbey."

After the dissolution of the League, the 1946 Protocol Amending the Agreements, Conventions and Protocols on Narcotic Drugs concluded at The Hague on 23 January 1912, at Geneva on 11 February 1925 and 19 February 1925, and 13 July 1931, at Bangkok on 27 November 1931 and at Geneva on 26 June 1936, created a Supervisory Body to administer the estimate system. The functions of both bodies were merged into the Board by the 1961 Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs. The composition of the Board under the Single Convention was strongly influenced by the 1946 treaty."

  "text" : "Rev'd. Dr. John Hewett (or Huett; September 1614 – buried 8 June 1658) was chaplain to Charles I and later executed for treason as a Royalist. The son of clothworker Thomas Hewett, he was born in Eccles, Lancashire, and educated in nearby Bolton-le-Moors. In 1643 he was awarded a degree of DD by Oxford University, where he served as a chaplain to Charles I. He then became chaplain to Montagu Bertie, 2nd Earl of Lindsey, at Havering in Essex, before moving to London, where he preached to larger congregations. He was openly loyal to the exiled Prince Charles (the future King Charles II), and was involved in the secret preparations for his return. In April 1658 a fellow sympathiser, John Stapley, confessed to Cromwell that, thanks to Hewett, he had been offered funds to raise an army to support the return of Prince Charles. Hewett was arrested, along with Lord Mordaunt and Sir Henry Slingsby, and brought to trial, refusing to enter a plea of guilty or not guilty and claiming the right to trial by jury. The court, however, sentenced Hewett and Slingsby to be beheaded for treason (Mordaunt having been narrowly acquitted on a technicality) and three other less well-born conspirators to be hanged, drawn and quartered. The beheadings were carried out on Tower Hill. Dr. John Hewett had married twice: firstly Elizabeth, daughter of Robert Skinner of London, with whom he had three children; and secondly Mary, daughter of Robert Bertie, 1st Earl of Lindsey, with whom he had two daughters who died young. His eldest son John became a merchant in Barbados."

He was considered one of the most popular players at the time called the king of bagpipe players. During his lifetime Juhan Maaker performed with great success in hundreds of concert halls and became popular all over Estonia  and also in Finland. In 1927-28 he took part of five concert tours in Estonia organized by August Pulst, an activist in promoting folk music in cooperation with the Estonian Open-Air Museum Society giving all together 244 concerts. 36 pieces performed by Juhan Maakeri have been preserved and digitized from Phonograph wax cylinders found in the Estonian Literature museum. During his lifetime a sculpture of Juhan Maaker was made by the Estonian National Museum's sponsorship. After Juhan Maaker's nephew Aleksander Maaker (1890–1968) death there was only one surviving bagpipe player alive in Estonia: Olev Roomet who became the revivalist of bagpipe in the country by training 25 new players in the 1970s. In modern times bagpipe playing is a part of the curriculum at University of Tartu Viljandi Culture Academy's Traditional Music faculty and in a number of regular music schools around the country."

  "text" : "John Cunningham Geikie (Edinburgh, 26 October 1824 – 1 April 1906) was a Scottish-born minister and author, primarily active first in Toronto, Canada, and then in England. Born in Edinburgh, Scotland, Geikie was the second son of Reverend Archibald Geikie, a Presbyterian Congregationalist minister in Toronto and subsequently at Canaan, Connecticut. Geikie received his early education in Edinburgh, and afterwards studied divinity for four years at Queen's College, Kingston, Ontario. Ordained a Presbyterian minister in 1848, he first engaged in missionary work in Canada. From 1851 to 1854 he was Presbyterian minister at Halifax, Nova Scotia. In 1860 he returned to Great Britain and held a Presbyterian charge at Sunderland till 1867, and at Islington Chapel from 1867 to 1873. In 1876 he was ordained deacon in the Church of England and priest next year. He was curate of St. Peter's, Dulwich (1876–79), rector of Christ Church, Neuilly, Paris (1879–81), vicar of St. Mary's, Barnstaple (1883–85), and vicar of St Martin at Palace, Norwich (1885–90). In 1871 he was made hon. D.D. of Queen's College, Kingston, Ontario, and in 1891 hon. LL.D. of Edinburgh University. In 1890 he retired, owing to ill health, to Bournemouth, where he died in 1906. He was buried at Barnstaple. In 1849, he married in 1849 Margaret, daughter of David Taylor of Dublin. She survived him with two sons. Geikie enjoyed a wide reputation as a writer of popular books on biblical and religious subjects. Charles Spurgeon described him as \"one of the best religious writers of the age\". His chief writings dealt on orthodox lines with historical and practical rather than with theological themes. His most ambitious work was 'Hours with the Bible, or, the Scriptures in the Light of Modern Discovery and Knowledge' (10 vols. 1881-84; new edit, largely re-written, 12 vols. 1896-97). His 'Life and Words of Christ' (2 vols. 1877; new edit. 1 vol. 1891) reached a circulation of nearly 100,000 copies, and Delitzsch placed the book in 'the highest rank.' He was deeply interested in the exploration of Palestine under the direction of Claude Reignier Conder [q. v. Suppl. II], and several visits to the country supplied him with material for 'The Holy Land and the Bible: A Book of Scripture Illustrations gathered in Palestine' (2 vols. 1887; abridged edit. 1903)."

He was appointed as a scientific officer in the 'General Herbarium', with responsibility for one of the four sections into which the herbarium was divided. These were families 67 (Myrtaceae) to 107 (Asclepiadaceae). The following year he was given responsibility for planning and building a major new botany gallery - the first exhibition to be constructed in the museum following serious bomb damage during the second world war.It reflected a new approach to making museum natural history more accessible to a general audience, and was opened by Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother on 31 October 1962 and dismantled 20 years later. Cannon was made Senior Scientific Officer in 1956; Principal Scientific Officer in 1964, and Keeper of Botany in 1977. He specialised in the study of Apiaceae (Parsley Family), especially African species. Cannon retired from the museum in 1990. He was president of the Botanical Society of the British Isles from 1983 to 1985.

He was enthusiastic about the Vichy regime and following the appointment of François Darlan as Prime Minister of France in February, 1941, Barnaud was brought into the government as Delegate General for Franco-German Economic Relations. Along with the likes of Jean Bichelonne, François Lehideux and Pierre Pucheu, he was a member of a group of technocrats who were important in the early days of the Vichy regime. Barnaud worked with Nazi Germany during the occupation in order to secure deals to supply them with aluminium and rubber from French Indo-China. He did, however successfully oppose a plan suggested by Hermann Göring that the Nazis collect France's church bells and melt them down for their metal content, feeling that such a scheme would breed too much resentment against the Nazi occupiers. Barnaud was arrested in October, 1944, on charges of providing the enemy with intelligence. After several delays the charges were dismissed in 1949. He returned to his business interests and amassed a fortune in post-war France."

  "text" : "Jean Bichelonne (24 December 1904 – 22 December 1944) was a French businessman and member of the Vichy government that governed France during World War II following the occupation of France by Nazi Germany. Born in Bordeaux, Bichelonne was a graduate of the École Polytechnique. He gained an early reputation for his brilliant organisational skill as well as his photographic memory. In 1937, he became member of the cabinet of the minister for public works (ministre des Travaux Publics), Henri Queuille. He was a member of the French delegation in the armistice commission (the Armistice of 22 June 1940 was a de facto surrender). Following the establishment of Vichy, Bichelonne was, in September 1940, appointed head of the Office central de repartition des produits industriels, a body that determined how raw materials would be proportioned between the newly established comites d'organisation (corporatist bodies in charge of each industrial sector). Along with the likes of Jacques Barnaud, François Lehideux and Pierre Pucheu, Bichelonne was a member of a group of technocrats who held important positions in the early days of the Vichy regime. Like Pucheu he was devotee of Saint-Simonianism, the belief in industrialisation as the motor of progress in society, a belief that was not shared by the rural traditionalist Philippe Pétain. As Minister of Industrial Production, Bichelonne faced the problem of demands for slave labour from the Nazi Labour Deployment Minister Fritz Sauckel, and the impact it was having on French industry. He managed to overcome this difficulty by securing an agreement with Albert Speer in September 1943 to the effect that the entire French industrial sector would be Sperrbetrieben, making it effectively off limits to Sauckel. Bichelonne was one of the cabinet members taken under SS guard from Vichy to Belfort on the night of 17–18 August as the Nazis desperately sought to maintain the collaborationist government by any means necessary. Moved to the Sigmaringen enclave, Bichelonne fell ill and was sent to the SS hospital at Hohenlychen. It was officially recorded that he died of a pulmonary embolism, but unsubstantiated rumours suggested that he may have been assassinated."

  "text" : "Watson was born in Scarborough, Yorkshire. He enlisted in the Army in 1939 and served with the Duke of Cornwall's Light Infantry and the South Lancashire Regiment which later formed the 13th (Lancashire) Battalion The Parachute Regiment. Watson was a platoon commander on D-Day, 6 June 1944 and parachuted into Normandy and took part in the liberation of Ranville. He served in the Ardennes as a Company Commander and his Company on 3 January 1945 led the assault into the village of Bure, Belgium. Watson's Company from the launch of the attack came under heavy repeated attacks by enemy mortars, machine-guns and artillery and there were immediate casualties. He led the Company forward and when under attack organised the defences and drove the enemy from the part of the village his company had been tasked to clear. An extract from the citation for his Military Cross reads: \" His conduct, energy and gallantry throughout were beyond praise, and without him the attack might well have failed. \" Watson served in Operation Varsity: the air assault landing over the Rhine on 24 March 1945 and took part in the advance across Germany to the Baltic Sea. Following the Second World War he served in Palestine and was adjutant of the 1st Battalion The West Yorkshire Regiment in Austria and the Canal Zone. He served with the 2nd Parachute Battalion before retiring from the Army in 1958. He worked for J Lyons and Co to 1982. He was president of the Airborne Assault Normandy Trust. Watson was appointed a Chevalier of the Legion d'honneur in 2005. He was made an honorary citizen of Bure and Tellin in the Ardennes and of Ranville, Normandy. Watson had a leading role in organising the ceremonies which commemorate the anniversaries of the battle for Normandy, Ardennes campaign and the River Rhine crossing. He married Laura Eyre in 1938 with whom he was to have one son and four daughters. Major Jack Watson MC died on 12 April 2011."

He wrote a number of popular songs around this time, the best-known being a satire, \"The Clothier's Looking-Glass\". He next went to London, where he formed a large circle of acquaintances, among them George Cruikshank, who illustrated some of his poems (\"The Drunkard\", 1840, \"The Blessings of Temperance\", 1851, \"The Triumph of Temperance\", 1852). He wrote Alva, a drama, in 1821 and he enjoyed some popularity as a temperance poet. His business ventures were not successful and he had a large family to support. At the end of his life, he was also working as a shoe-maker in Drury Lane. His last book, \"Legends of Carrick\" (edited by Mrs. S. C. Hall), was published in 1854."

  "text" : "Jean-Pierre Latz (c. 1691 – Paris, 4 August 1754 ) was one of the handful of truly outstanding cabinetmakers (ébénistes) working in Paris in the mid-18th century. Like several of his peers in the French capital, he was of German origin. His furniture is in a fully developed rococo style, employing boldly sculptural gilt-bronze mounts complementing marquetry motifs of flowers and leafy sprays, in figured tropical veneers like tulipwood, amarante, purpleheart and rosewood, often featuring the distinctive end-grain cuts. He also produced lacquered pieces, most famously the slant-front desk in the collection of Stavros Niarchos, Paris. The son of a certain Walter Latz, Jean-Pierre was born near Cologne, where he must have received his training, for when he settled in Paris in 1719, where he was received into the cabinetmakers' guild, he was aged twenty-six. He always retained a certain German weightiness to his designs. When the practice of stamping the carcasses of furniture was introduced in Paris, Latz was already in full career. Nevertheless, his style is individual enough that a range of unstamped case furniture, writing tables and especially clock cases, his specialty, with close stylistic connections to stamped pieces, can be attributed to his workshop. In some cases, carcases by Latz were veneered with marquetry in the shop of Jean-François Oeben, or, possibly, by Roger Vandercruse Lacroix. In May 1736 Latz was naturalized as a French citizen. In 1741 he was appointed ébéniste privilegié du Roi, a court appointment under royal warrant that should have freed him from certain Parisian guild restrictions. Robust and sculptural gilt-bronze mounts that show technical virtuosity in casting and the chasing of their surfaces are a consistent feature of Latz' identified work, and in this vein Henry Hawley has noted that he was investigated in December 1749 by the Paris guild of workers in metal (Communauté des fondeurs), for casting and chasing mounts in his own workshop, a privilege that was normally reserved to the metalworkers' guild. In spite of his warrant as ébéniste privilegié, all his bronze-chasing tools were confiscated and, what must have been an overwhelming loss, a thousand models for bronze mounts. Some of his furniture mounts can be dated 1745-49 by the tiny \"crowned c\" tax stamp they bear, that was in effect only during those years; an example is Latz' commode in the Cincinnati Art Museum. Latz specialised in clock cases. In the documentation of the 1736 raid, 236 clock cases or parts of clock cases, including sculpted models for complete clocks, mounts and dial elements, and sculptural figures in bronze were impounded. He counted numerous foreign clients, among them Frederick II of Prussia, for whom was conceived Latz's grandest piece, a richly mounted clock, Augustus III, Elector of Saxony and King of Poland, Count Heinrich von Brühl and Madame Elisabeth, Louis XV's favourite daughter, married to the Duke of Parma. At the time of his marriage in 1739, most unusually, the marriage contract was witnessed by two grand personages, Sister Marie-Gabrielle-Eléanor de Bourbon-Condé, abbess of the Abbaye Royale de Saint-Antoine, a princesse du Sang, and another abbess of a distinguished family, Jeanne de Rohan. Henry Hawley has suggested that such contacts would have provided a useful entrée at court. After his death in 1754, his widow Marie-Madeleine continued the extensive workshops, holding his desirable brevet of marchand-ébéniste privilegié du roi suivant la cour; at her death two years later (7 December 1756), their only son having died as an infant, the shop was dispersed and the warrant passed to Pierre Macret. Latz' name, never mentioned in 18th-century Parisian sale catalogues, fell into complete obscurity after his death; his career was reconstructed in the 20th century, beginning with the comte de Salverte."

Komol was doing well in the youth and in the second team and he was training with the first team. On November 15, 2000, Vitesse chairman Jos Vaessen announced that Komol tested positive for HIV. Komol was the first player in Dutch football with HIV and this caused a shock. Clubs started testing their players and questions arose over whether the disease could be transmitted during the game. Komol's playing license was suspended by the KNVB. Research showed that the risk of transmission during the game was less than 0.1% in Komol's case. He was allowed to play again but the treatment of his disease prevented him from making the Vitesse team again. Because of his disease, Komol was granted permanent residency in The Netherlands. In 2005 he had an unsuccessful trial at Go Ahead Eagles and he played in the 2007/08 season at De Bataven in the Hoofdklasse. In 2008 he started playing at lower amateurside SMC and since 2010 he plays at vv Erica'76, which merged to VV Dieren in 2012."

Nevius was first appointed to the council by President Lyndon Johnson from 1967 to 1969. In 1972, President Richard Nixon appointed him as president of the council. In 1974, the advent of home rule brought DC's first elected council and council chairman. Nevius, a self-described \"WASP Republican,\" did not run for the position, and he was succeeded by Sterling Tucker. His wife Sally Nevius later gained some notoriety by co-founding the Parents Music Resource Center together with Tipper Gore and several other \"Washington wives.\""

He was an opponent of Davy Payne, the UDA's North Belfast brigadier and an unpopular figure with many members due to allegations of racketeering and involvement in the death of John McMichael. He served as acting brigadier in South East Antrim following illness striking existing brigadier Alan Snoddy and in this role voted to retain the leadership of Andy Tyrie, a motion that was not successful. English served an advisor to the UDA's Inner Council and in 1990 whilst in this position he was arrested as part of the Stevens Inquiries. English was taken in, along with East Belfast brigadier Billy Elliot, for possessing confidential security documents. Whilst on remand English, who was subsequently released without charge, had a confrontation with Danny Morrison who was also on remand over kidnapping charges. Along with Ray Smallwoods, English, as representative of the Combined Loyalist Military Command, was in regular contact with Robin Eames during the early 1990s and the Archbishop of Armagh's pleas for peace impacted on English's thinking."

On 26 May 2011 he was given four life sentences for the 1985 double murder of brother and sister Richard and Helen Thomas, and the 1989 double murder of Peter and Gwenda Dixon. Cooper was also sentenced for the rape of a 16-year-old girl and a sexual assault on a 15-year-old girl, both carried out at gunpoint, in March 1996, in woodland behind the Mount Estate, Milford Haven. Cooper had a history of crime, including 30 robberies and violent assault. Footage from the TV game show Bullseye, in which he appeared as a contestant in May 1989, was later used as evidence against him, comparing his image with a sketch of a suspect in the Dixons' murder. Cooper was sentenced for 14 years in 1998 (served 10 years) for burglary and robbery, enabling the police to collect further evidence against him. He was released from prison in January 2009. Through a cold case review, and subsequent developments in DNA and forensic science, in April 2009 the police were able to identify Cooper's shotgun as the murder weapon. He was arrested in May 2009 and was convicted in May 2011 for the double murders and sexual assaults. In September 2011, he launched an appeal against his convictions. His appeal was rejected in November 2012. He has no possibility of parole."

  "text" : "Jan Mombaer also known as Johannes Mauburnus and as Johannes von Brüssel (1460, Brussels – 1501 Paris) was a Christian monk who composed hymns and was part of the devotio moderna movement. He studied at the congregation of Augustinians in Utrecht and around 1477 entered the Congregation of Windesheim. Mombaer developed a structured method of organizing seemingly haphazard glances at the Bible to form consistent thoughts for a hymn. His work was also treasured by Martin Luther. As an Augustinian monk, Luther used Mauburnus' morning prayer upon rising. Later he used that prayer in crafting what many today know as \"Luther's Morning Prayer\" found in Luther's Small Catechism. Mombaer is best known for his Rosetum exercitiorum spiritualium et sacrarum meditationum (Rose-garden of spiritual exercises and sacred meditations) mentioned by Loyola as an influence on his own spiritual exercises."

Her story was reported in a newspaper article syndicated across Canada, inspiring two books and other memorials. When Janis died of leukemia in 1961, corneal transplantation was a relatively unknown procedure. Although parents who lose young children frequently donate some of their organs to others, Janis's bequest was significant because the donation of her eyes at her death was her own idea, and it inspired many other people—across Canada and elsewhere—to become cornea donors as well."

He was employed by Charles Warren's expedition to the Transjordan, as a translator and assistant photographer, the beginning of his interest in research on the antiquities and folklore of the region and leading to his involvement with the Palestine Exploration Fund. His papers and correspondence were published in the Quarterly Statement of that British society after 1881, which also issued his booklet Table of the Christian and Mohammedan Eras in 1904; he was supplied with high quality photographic equipment to supplement his productions. Some of his collection of photographs were reproduced in his 1910 work, Walks about Jerusalem; his brother and son were also active in this field. In 1907 his Folk-lore of the Holy Land: Moslem, Christian and Jewish was published in London."

  "text" : "Joe Louis Reliford (born November 29, 1939 in Fitzgerald, Georgia)  was an African-American Minor League Baseball batboy who became the youngest person to participate in a professional baseball game on July 19, 1952. He was inserted into a game for the Fitzgerald Pioneers of the Georgia State League at the age of 12 years and 234 days. When the Pioneers fell behind the Statesboro Pilots 13–0, heading into the eighth inning, the crowd started chanting for club manager Charley Ridgeway to \"put in the batboy.\" He was sent to the plate against pitcher Curtis White and grounded out to third base. He then continued to play in the game as the center fielder. Reliford was released shortly after the incident, Ridgeway was suspended for five days and fined $50 (local fans paid the fine for him), and umpire Ed Kubrick was fired by the league. Reliford not only became the youngest person to play in professional baseball, he broke the color barrier in the Georgia State League as well. Later that summer, Reliford went to work for the semi-pro Fitzgerald Lucky Stars, even appearing in a few games. Any chance Reliford had at an athletic career, however, was cut short by a broken collarbone suffered in college. After graduation, Reliford went on to become an electrical technician and moving to Douglas, Georgia where he became only the third African-American hired to that city's police force. He was later appointed deputy sheriff, a post he held until retiring in 1998. Today, Reliford lives in Douglas, still keeps in touch with his old manager Ridgeway and spends much of his time doting on his 16 grandchildren."

  "text" : "Jewell James Ebers (November 25, 1921 – March 1959) was an American electrical engineer who is remembered for the mathematical model of the bipolar junction transistor that he published with John L. Moll in 1954. The Ebers-Moll model of the transistor views the transistor as a pair of diodes, and the model is a fusion of the models of these diodes. J.J. Ebers was born in Grand Rapids, Michigan on November 25, 1921. He served three years in the U.S. Army. Ebers attended Antioch College where he obtained a bachelor of science degree in 1946. He entered Ohio State University studying electrical engineering, obtaining his master's degree in 1947 and Ph.D. in 1950. Ebers continued at Ohio State as a research associate in the university's research foundation, as an instructor, and as an assistant professor until 1951. In September 1951 Ebers joined Bell Labs in Murray Hill, New Jersey. There he worked with J.L. Moll with whom he published the frequently-cited article on \"Large-signal behavior of junction transistors\" which is the basis of the Ebers-Moll model. According to James M. Early, Ebers' technical contributions, qualities of personal leadership, and management skill led to promotions to supervisor, department head, and Director of the Allentown Lab of Bell. Ebers was a member of Eta Kappa Nu, Sigma Xi, and the American Physical Society.Jewell James Ebers died in March, 1959. As a memorial to his scientific work, every year the IEEE Electron Devices Society grants the J J Ebers Award to a worthy engineer."

As a member of the UVF's Mid-Ulster Brigade led by Robin \"the Jackal\" Jackson, Weir was a part of the Glenanne gang, a group of loyalist extremists that carried out sectarian attacks mainly in the County Armagh area in the mid-1970s. Along with his RUC colleague Billy McCaughey, Weir was convicted of the 1977 sectarian killing of Catholic chemist William Strathern and sentenced to life imprisonment. Weir's affidavit which implicated Jackson, other members of the Glenanne gang, soldiers of the Ulster Defence Regiment (UDR), and his colleagues in the RUC and SPG, in a series of sectarian attacks, including the Dublin and Monaghan bombings, was published in the 2003 Barron Report, the findings of an official investigation into the 1974 car bombings commissioned by Irish Supreme Court Justice Henry Barron."

His paternal grandparents were Matthias Ephlias and the daughter of the High Priest Jonathon. Jonathon may have been Alexander Jannaeus, the High Priest and Hasmonean ruler who governed Judea from 103 BC-76 BC. He was a contemporary to the King Herod the Great and the Herodian Dynasty governing Judea and the surrounding territories. Josephus followed his paternal ancestors and served as a Priest in the Temple in Jerusalem. Josephus married an unnamed Jewish noblewoman. The wife of Josephus was a distant paternal relative of his, as she was a descendant of his paternal great-grandfather Simon Psellus. His wife bore him a son, Matthias.

  "text" : "Jacobus Ludovicus Conradus Schroeder van der Kolk (Leeuwarden, 14 April 1797 – Utrecht, 1 May 1862) was a Dutch anatomist and physiologist and an influential researcher into the causes of epilepsy and mental illness. Schroeder van der Kolk's father's surname was Van der Kolk, but he added his mother's maiden name \"Schroeder\" when her line threatened to die out. He studied medicine at the University of Groningen, where he graduated in 1820. He then practiced medicine in Hoorn and was soon after appointed at the Amsterdam Buitengasthuis hospital. Here Schroeder van der Kolk was influenced by the ideas of Claude François Lallemand and developed his ideas with regards to the etiology of mental illness, particularly the concept that mental illness is a disease than can be treated. He was appointed professor of anatomy and physiology at the University of Utrecht in 1826, where he taught gross anatomy and microscopic anatomy. In Utrecht, Schroeder van der Kolk's pupils included Franciscus Donders, Hermann Snellen and Barend Joseph Stokvis. He published over 100 papers on various medical topics. In 1859 he delivered the Sydenham lecture at the Worshipful Society of Apothecaries in London. Schroeder van der Kolk's best known work is on the pathogenesis of epilepsy. Autopsy studies on the brains of people who had suffered of epilepsy in life showed changes in the medulla oblongata (part of the brainstem), and Schroeder van der Kolk stated that seizures must therefore originate in this area. Several decades later it was discovered that seizures arise from the cerebral cortex. He conducted other studies in neuroanatomy, such as into the organisation of the spinal cord. Other important work was in the nature and causes of mental illness. Apart from Lallemand he was also influenced by the French psychiatrists Philippe Pinel and Jean-Étienne Dominique Esquirol. His work in this area led to him being appointed general inspector for psychiatric institutions. Schroeder van der Kolk married twice, first to Cornelia Templeman and after being widowed of her to Geertruid Elizabeth Schroeder, whose father was professor of mathematics in Utrecht. He had one child from the first and five from the second marriage. Schroeder van der Kolk became a correspondent of the Royal Institute in 1831 and was admitted as member in 1846. When the Royal Institute became the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1855 he became a member."

  "text" : "Judith Trim (11 October 1943 – 9 January 2001) was an English studio potter. From 1969–1976, she was married to Roger Waters of the rock band Pink Floyd, her childhood sweetheart. Her father was a research scientist at the University of Cambridge, but encouraged her to concentrate on art. She took A-levels in the arts and natural sciences at Cambridge's County High School for Girls, and then studied at Bath Academy of Art, Corsham. During her time with Waters, she worked as an art teacher, including a period during the mid to late 60's at Dame Alice Owen's Girls' Grammar School in Islington, North London. She was shown on the gatefold sleeve of the original release of Pink Floyd's 1969 album Ummagumma, but was excised from subsequent CD reissues. The uncropped picture was restored for the album's inclusion in the box set Oh, by the Way. Waters says that when he played her the finished recording of The Dark Side of the Moon, she burst into tears, which Waters saw as an indication that the work would be successful. He has admitted to infidelities during the marriage, and to his regret that they lost him his wife, and describes \"the beginnings of the end of that marriage\" as occurring in Greece in the summer of 1974. They had no children together. Following her divorce from Waters, she spent ten years living alone in London, concentrating on her pottery, focusing on coiled pots. She held an exhibition at the Anatol Orient gallery in Portobello Road, London, in 1989, and others at Contemporary Applied Art, Contemporary Ceramics and Ruth Coram Arts. Her work is in the collection of museums such as the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, Norwich Castle, the Ashmolean Museum, the Fitzwilliam Museum. and the Shipley Museum. Some of her work was sold through the Crafts Council shop at the Victoria and Albert Museum. She signed her pottery with the initials \"JT\", in a circle. In 1996 she married the architect and painter Leonard Hessing, with whom she had one son, Theo. She died on 9 January 2001, from breast cancer."

  "text" : "Jacques Numa Sadoul, commonly known as Captain Sadoul (Russian: Жак Саду́ль, Zhak Sadul; May 22, 1881 – November 18, 1956), was a French lawyer, communist politician, and writer, one of the founders of the Communist International. He began his career in the French Section of the Workers' International (SFIO) in Vienne, and, by the time of World War I, was serving under Albert Thomas, the Minister of Armaments. A French Army Captain, he was Thomas' envoy to the Russian Republic, keeping contact with the socialist circles and steering them toward the Entente Powers. After the October Revolution, he maintained close contacts with the Bolsheviks, pledging them his support against the Central Powers during the crisis of 1917–1918. He was unable to prevent Bolshevist Russia from signing the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, which took her out of the war, but, having established close contacts with Leon Trotsky and other communist leaders, became a communist himself. Opting not to return to France during the Russian Civil War, Sadoul co-founded the French Communist Group in Russia, fighting for control of it against Pierre Pascal and Henri Guilbeaux. Helping to set up the Red Army, he was sent to the Ukraine, where he instigated mutinies among the French intervention troops, and then to Germany, where he set up communist cells. Sadoul also mediated between the International and the SFIO's left-wing, attracting members for what became the French Communist Party (PCF), and contributed doctrinaire essays in L'Humanité. A French military court sentenced him to death in absentia, while the SFIO presented him, symbolically, as a candidate in the 1919 elections. Finally moving back to France in 1924, and acquitted upon retrial, Sadoul remained at the center of controversy. He joined the PCF, but failed to win any elections, and was generally marginalized by the party leadership. A Stalinist apologist and Izvestia correspondent in the 1930s, he helped the Soviet Union maintain contacts with the French establishment, and represented Soviet interests in France. He was pressured into collaborationism with Vichy France during World War II, but openly returned to communism in 1944, and ended his career in politics as mayor of Sainte-Maxime."

  "text" : "Joaquín Zamacois i Soler (14 December 1894, Santiago de Chile – 8 September 1976, Barcelona), was a Chilean-Spanish composer, music teacher and author. Zamacois was born in Chile, but, being of Spanish descent, moved to Barcelona with his family. He began his musical career under the tutelage of his father, studying later at Conservatori Superior de Música del Liceu and at Escuela Municipal de Música of the same city. Then, he dedicated himself to composition. In 1914, he was named Professor at Liceu, and in 1940 at Escuela Municipal de Música, where he was the director in 1945, transforming it into a Conservatory. Zamacois is also known for his harmony treatise and various pedagogical texts, used in Spain and Latinamerican countries."

According to Eliseu Climent i Corberà, his 1954 book Notícia de Catalunya was a direct source and inspiration for Joan Fuster's influential 1962 book Nosaltres, els valencians. Vicens book was to be originally titled Nosaltres els catalans, but it was renamed under Josep Pla's advice, for fear of Francoist censorship. Fuster's work has the same structure and intention of Vicens'. The book was expanded and republished in 1960. Notícia de Catalunya had also a major influence on Jordi Pujol. Vicens was also a friend an influence for Joan Reglà."

  "text" : "Joseph-Vincent Quiblier (26 June 1796 – 12 September 1852) was a Roman Catholic priest involved in Sulpician educational endeavors in Canada. Born in France, Quiblier moved to Montreal in 1825 with Joseph-Alexandre Baile and almost immediately became involved as a Sulpician educator at the Petit Séminaire de Montréal. Although he was young and poorly trained, there was a great need to fill teaching positions at the seminary. By 1828, he was the director there and seems to have had the confidence of the French Canadian Sulpicians. However, this group appears to have been in conflict with the rest of Catholic community including Archbishop Bernard-Claude Panet. Quiblier became the superior of the Séminaire de Saint-Sulpice in Montreal in 1831. He retained this position until 1846 when he resigned under some pressure and was replaced. The new superior was Pierre-Louis Billaudèle who was the director of the first Grand Séminaire de Montréal."

In 1967 he was the captain of Argentina's youth team, featuring among others Enrique Wolff, that won the sub-20 Copa América in Paraguay, albeit only by lot, after 2:2 in the final against the hosts. Between 1971 and 1973 he also played 13 times for the Argentine national team with which he reached fourth place in the 1972 Brazilian Independence Cup. In later years he coached besides River Plate, which always was the club of his heart, Instituto Atlético Central Córdoba, Deportivo Maipú in Mendoza and Villa Dálmine in Buenos Aires. Last he was coaching youth teams of River Plate and travelling the country scouting for new talent. In April 1998 he died aged 51 from a heart attack.

  "text" : "James Saurin (c.1760–1842) was an Irish Anglican bishop in the 19th century. He was the last Bishop of Dromore before it was merged with the Diocese of Down and Connor. He was born in Belfast, the third of the four sons of James Saurin, vicar of Belfast (died 1774) and Jane Duff. William Saurin, Attorney General for Ireland, was his elder brother. The Saurins were of Hugenot extraction, originally from Nimes in France, and it was probably the Bishop's grandfather, Louis, who settled in Ireland about 1727; Louis was a brother of the celebrated preacher Jacques Saurin. Like his brothers, James was educated at Dubourdien's School, a well-regarded private academy in Lisburn. He married Elizabeth Lyster and had a numerous family, including James, Archdeacon of Dromore, and Colonel William Saurin. William Saurin Lyster, the celebrated Australian actor, was a nephew. A former Dean of Derry (1812 to 1813), Archdeacon of Dublin (1813 to 1818) and Dean of Cork (1818 to 1819) he was the Bishop of Dromore from 1819 to 1842. He lived mainly at Dun Laoghaire where he died in office on 9 April 1842. He was buried in St. Ann's Church, Dawson Street. A plaque in Dromore Cathedral praises his 22 years of \"mild and paternal authority, fulfilling his duties with affection and constancy\". While his brother William was a passionate supporter of the Orange Order and noted for his violent prejudice against Roman Catholics, this tribute suggests that James was a more moderate character."

  "text" : "James Robertson CBE (17 June 1912 – 18 May 1991) was an English conductor, best known as musical director of Sadler's Wells Opera. Robertson was born in Liverpool and was educated at Winchester College and Trinity College, Cambridge, before studying music at the Leipzig Conservatory and the Royal College of Music in London. He joined the music staff of Glyndebourne Festival Opera in 1937 and became chorus master and repetiteur of the Carl Rosa Opera in 1938. After the Second World War, in which he served in the Royal Air Force, he was appointed musical director of the Sadler's Wells Opera in 1946, serving in the post until 1954. Together with the conductor Michael Mudie and the administrator Norman Tucker, he formed a triumvirate that ran the company. In 1954 Robertson left to become conductor of the New Zealand National Orchestra (now the New Zealand Symphony Orchestra), succeeding Michael Bowles. He returned to Britain in 1958, conducting the Carl Rosa company and as a regular guest conductor at Sadler's Wells. Robertson was opera adviser to the Théâtre Royale de la Monnaie in Brussels in 1960, followed by a further spell in New Zealand, where he was artistic director of the National Opera (1962–3). In 1964 he became director of the London Opera Centre, where he encouraged many young singers who later achieved success on the operatic stage. He retired as director in 1977, though remaining a consultant. He returned once more to New Zealand, conducting there from 1978 to 1981. Robertson died in Ruabon, North Wales, aged 79."

  "text" : "John Bell was a former Scottish professional association footballer who played as a forward. Bell played in the Scottish Leagues for Beith and Queen of the South before joining Preston North End. Bell was signed to Beith before leaving at the start of the 1932–33 season to join Queen of the South. Scoring 14 goals in his first season at Queens, Bell was part of the promotion winning Queen of the South side who gained their first promotion to the top division in Scotland. The promotion was by finishing the 1932–33 season as runners up to Hibernian. Bell scored the first ever top division goal for the Dumfries club when he scored the first goal of Queens' first top division game. Lining up beside Willie Savage and Willie Ferguson, the game was against Celtic at Palmerston Park. Bell scored in the third minute when Kennaway in Celtic goal could only parry a shot by Wales. Bell scored a second goal, three minutes into the second half. This was the winner in a 3-2 victory. Bell joined Preston North End in late December 1933. The undisclosed fee was believed to be around £1,500, surpassing the previous QoS transfer fee paid for Billy Halliday. Moving clubs mid season, he was on nine goals for the season at that point."

  "text" : "Jancita Eagle Deer (1952 – April 4, 1975) was a Brulé Lakota who lived on the Rosebud Indian Reservation in South Dakota. She was notable for accusing William Janklow of having raped her in January 1967 when he was a poverty lawyer and Director of the Rosebud Sioux Legal Services program on the reservation. She had worked as his babysitter. At the time the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) did not prosecute the case. In October 1974 Dennis Banks acted on her behalf as the tribal attorney to revive the charges, as Janklow was a candidate for state attorney general. Eagle Deer in 1974 had Janklow disbarred from practicing in the Rosebud Sioux Tribal Court. No charges were brought against Janklow in the alleged rape case and in 1975 he was appointed by the White House to the national board of the Legal Services Corporation. Eagle Deer was killed the night of April 4, 1975 in a hit-and-run accident in southern Nebraska. She had been seeing former American Indian Movement (AIM) activist Douglass Durham. He was discovered in late 1974 to be an FBI informant and expelled from AIM in March 1975. Janklow was elected governor of South Dakota in 1978, and twice served tenures of two terms."

  "text" : "James Redding Ware (1832-c 1909, pseudonym Andrew Forrester) was a British writer, novelist and playwright, creator of one of the first female detectives in fiction. James Redding Ware was born in Southwark, south London, in 1832, the son of James Ware, a grocer, and Elizabeth, nee Redding. By 1851, his father had died, and his mother, according to the census, was a grocer and tea-dealer, and James Redding Ware was her assistant. By 1861, the household is no longer in place, and J. R. Ware is not readily identifiable in the census. But in 1865, James Redding Ware became a Freemason, at the Westbourne Lodge No. 733, and he was living in Peckham. (He became a Junior Warden at the Urban Lodge, no. 1196, and by 1872 a Worshipful Master (WM).) His detective works include: The Female Detective (c.1863/4), 'edited by A.F.'; Secret Service, or, Recollections of a City Detective (?1864); The Private Detective and Revelations of the Private Detective (both c.1868). Forrester was for many years known to be a pseudonym, but who he was actually, was unknown. However, recently one of his stories, 'A Child Found Dead: Murder or No Murder?', was discovered, reprinted as a pamphlet and published under the name of J. Redding Ware, as 'The Road Murder', an analysis of the Constance Kent case. With this as a clue, Forrester/Ware's first stories of the female detective can be found in a journal entitled Grave and Gay in summer 1862, which makes his female detective predate the 1863/4 appearance of [?W. S. Hayward], The Revelations of a Lady Detective although not that of Ruth Trail. In 1860 a novel, The Fortunes of the House of Pennyl. A Romance of England in the Last Century (Blackwood's London Library) was published, with illustrations by Phiz, under the name J. Redding Ware. By 1868, he was a contributor to the Boy's Own Paper, the series of penny-bloods owned by Edwin Brett, although no particular work has been attributed to him. He also contributed to Bow Bells Magazine. He was also the author of The Death Trap, a play staged at the Grecian Saloon, City Road, Shoreditch, with George Conquest, the theatre manager, as the villain. He had now become a jobbing writer for hire, producing books on chess; a book on the Isle of Wight with photographs by William Russell Sedgefield and Frank Mason Good ; a volume of The Life and Speeches of His Royal Highness Prince Leopold; Mistaken Identities. Celebrated Cases of Undeserved Suffering, Self-Deception, and Wilful Imposture; as well as writing extensively for magazines. His only seeming connection to his early days as a writer of detective stories was with the publication, possibly in 1880, of Before the Bench: Sketches of Police Court Life (London, Diprose & Bateman). Posthumously, however, he was most famous for Passing English of the Victorian Era. A Dictionary of Heterodox English Slang and Phrase (London, Routledge, 1909), published shortly after his death."

  "text" : "James Hunt (1833 – 29 August 1869) was a speech therapist in London, England who had among his clients Charles Kingsley, Leo Tennyson (son of the poet laureate Alfred Tennyson) and Lewis Carroll (Charles Lutwidge Dodgson) author of Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland. Lewis Carroll was a children’s author, mathematician, and clergyman but had a severe stammer that affected his job. The 1861 census shows that Charles Lutwidge Dodgson was staying at Ore House in 1961 and being treated by Dr Hunt a psellismolligist. Since his book was published in 1865 it is quite possible that some of it was written during his stay. His other main interest was in anthropology and in 1863 he established the Anthropological Society of London, which after his death merged with the more established Ethnological Society of London to become the Royal Anthropological Institute."

A native of Limoges, he studied biology at the Sorbonne and in the laboratory at Saint-Vaast-la-Hougue. In 1906 he obtained his doctorate with a thesis on the nephridia of polychaetes. For the next fourteen years he served as a naturalist at the Laboratoire de biologie marine in Banyuls-sur-Mer. From 1920 he worked in the zoology department at the Muséum national d'histoire naturelle in Paris, where in 1938 he succeeded Charles Joseph Gravier (1865–1937) as professor and director of the department of zoology (worms and crustaceans). Fage made contributions in the fields of carcinology (study of crustaceans), arachnology and speleology. In 1945 he was a founding member of the Commission de spéléologie (being part of the Centre national de la recherche scientifique – CNRS). He also performed research of Ellobiopsis (genus of parasitic protozoa). A genus of ammonites named Fagesia is named after him."

Markert ran a local tavern and won election to the Washington Township Council in 1961, becoming the township's mayor in 1964 on a platform based on paving the many dirt roads in the community. After Democrat Herbert Gladstone chose not to run for re-election in 1975, Markert ran for and won the open Assembly seat. With Brendan Byrne at the top of the ticket winning the race for Governor of New Jersey, having defeated 39th district state senator Raymond Garramone in the primary, Frank Herbert won the 1977 race for Senate in the 39th District, standing together with his running mates in support of the establishment of a state income tax to defeat Markert, who had hoped to pick up Garramone's now open seat. In the 1979 election, Gerald Cardinale and Markert defeated incumbent Democrat Greta Kiernan, who had herself defeated Markert two years earlier. Markert died of cancer at his Florida home on June 3, 2011. He was survived by his wife Jean and by two daughters."

  "text" : "John Giuca (born October 1983) is an American man who was convicted on a charge of second-degree felony murder in the death of 19-year-old Mark Fisher in October, 2003. Giuca was arrested a year after the murder, he was found guilty along with trigger-man Antonio Russo; both were given a sentence of 25 years to life. In an attempt to obtain Giuca a new trial, his mother, Doreen Giuliano, used an assumed identity to become close to a man who had served as a juror on the case. Her actions were extensively featured in the media. Giuca continues to maintain his innocence, and a further appeal in his case is pending."

He was senior Vice-President of the Manchester Philatelic Society and was also known as the \"Father of the Manchester School\" for his practice, with Walter Dorning Beckton, of accumulating large blocks and sheets of stamps in order to study the position of overprints. The London Philatelist reported that, on his death, Abbott \"...left all his property, including, of course, his stamps, to his only relative, a half sister, with whom he lived. It was this lady who determined that the collection should go to some public institution in Manchester if any would accept the gift, and the offer was made to the Whitworth Institute and accepted by them.\" Less important items were sold at auction in 1914. In 1968 the donated stamps were sold by H.R. Harmer Ltd in a four-day sale."

  "text" : "James Wedgwood Drawbell (1899 – 6 February 1979) was a British writer, playwright and journalist, known in equal measure for his literary works and professional association (of variable closeness) with prominent figures of the day, including Winston Churchill, Bernard Shaw, Noël Coward, D. H. Lawrence, Margot Asquith and many others. In 1925 he was hired by William Berry as editor-in-chief of the Sunday Chronicle to become the second youngest (after John Delane) British editor-in-chief of a newspaper ever, and remained in that position until 1946, whereupon he undertook a variety of other occupations. Among other things Drawbell wrote three autobiographies, which, in addition to being valuable and often minute accounts of the changing age, also contain unique and insightful recollections of his encounters with famous people from all walks of life—ranging from great men of letters such as Fitzgerald to politicians such as Hitler."
