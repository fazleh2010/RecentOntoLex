  "text" : "Kay Mills (February 4, 1941 – January 13, 2011) was a journalist and author of five non-fiction books who revived the nearly-lost stories of women journalists and civil rights icons. She died at age 69 after a sudden heart attack in Santa Monica, California, where she lived. Her best-known book, This Little Light of Mine: The Life of Fannie Lou Hamer, a 1993 biography of the civil rights leader, was described by The New York Times as \"a riveting biography...In making sure we see Fannie Lou Hamer in full, Kay Mills has done more than render a biography that is true to its subject. She has provided a history that helps us to understand the choices made by so many black men and women of Hamer's generation, who, unwilling to leave the South they grew up in, somehow found the courage to join a movement in which they risked everything.\" It received the Christopher Award in 1993 and the Julia Spruill Book Prize from the Southern Association of Women Historians for the best book on southern women's history published in 1993 and 1994. University Press of Kentucky published a revised version of the book, with a foreword by Marian Wright Edelman, in 2007. Her first book, A Place in the News: From the Women’s Pages to the Front Page, a 1988 history of women in journalism, is still widely used in college journalism and women's studies courses. Parade magazine called it \"a seminal new book on women in journalism.\" Feminist scholar Carolyn G. Heilbrun said \"Reading A Place in the News was like seeing my life as a professional woman pass before my eyes.\" Mills was born in Washington, D.C. She recalled that although she was shy as a child, when she saw May Craig, the Maine newspaper correspondent, on Meet The Press, she figured that asking questions of newsmakers would be a good line of work for her. She was unaware of how rare Craig was, as a woman working in what was then a male-dominated profession. She graduated from Bethesda-Chevy Chase High School, a top school in the east at that time, in 1959. She graduated from Pennsylvania State University in 1963 and got a master's degree in African history from Northwestern University in 1965. When she applied for a job at Newsweek's Chicago bureau in 1966, the bureau chief told her, \"I need someone I can send anywhere, like to riots. And besides, what would you do if someone you were covering ducked into the men's room?\" Other employers were not so short-sighted. She became a broadcast news writer for United Press International in Chicago, then covered education and child welfare for the Baltimore Evening Sun. In 1970–71, she was assistant press secretary for U.S. Senator Edmund S. Muskie, then returned to journalism with the Washington bureau of the Newhouse newspapers. After a Professional Journalism Fellowship at Stanford University, she joined the Los Angeles Times in 1978 and became one of the first women (and often the only one) on its editorial board. She later was assistant editor of its Sunday Opinion section. She left the Times in 1991 to write books and freelance full-time. In addition to her newspaper jobs, Mills taught journalism and writing courses at George Mason University, the University of Southern California, the University of Minnesota and Princeton University, where she was a Ferris Professor. She has also lectured as an Alumni Fellow at Penn State, as a Woodrow Wilson Visiting Fellow at Berry College, Columbia College, and Illinois College, and as a Hearst Visiting Professional at the University of Missouri School of Journalism. She has chaired biography juries for both the Pulitzer Prize and the Los Angeles Times Book Prize. Mills served on the founding board of the Journalism and Women Symposium. She left the Los Angeles Times in 1991 to become a full-time author. Something Better for My Children: The History and People of Head Start (1998) was researched while on an Alicia Patterson Fellowship in 1995. Marian Wright Edelman, president of the Children's Defense Fund, called it \"must reading for people who care about America’s children.\" Her other books included From Pocahontas to Power Suits: Everything You Need to Know About Women's History in America (1995) and Changing Channels: The Civil Rights Case That Transformed Television, (2004), the story of the successful challenge of the Jackson, Mississippi, TV station that failed to cover the civil rights movement. At the time of her death, Mills was working on a mystery novel set in Paris."

  "text" : "Ken Pomeroy is the creator of a popular college basketball website and statistical archive, kenpom.com. His website includes his College Basketball Ratings, tempo-free statistics for every NCAA men's Division I basketball team, with archives dating back to the 2003 season, as well as a blog about current college basketball. His work on tempo-based basketball statistics is compared by many to the work of Bill James in baseball. As of the spring of 2012, Pomeroy is also an instructor of atmospheric sciences at the University of Utah. Pomeroy has written articles in The New York Times, ESPN.com, and Sports Illustrated. He was a co-author of The 2008-09 College Basketball Prospectus and has been an author for the past four years. Pomeroy earned his undergraduate degree at Virginia Tech, and received a graduate degree in atmospheric science from Wyoming. He currently resides in Salt Lake City, and after working as a meteorologist for the U.S. government, he quit that job to focus full-time on his website. He previously worked with the Houston Rockets, teaming up with noted advanced statistics user, general manager Daryl Morey. Pomeroy's website has helped explain basketball on a possession by possession level. His peers have taken to calling him \"Doctor Po-Po.\" As well as maintaining and calculating a variety of statistics on his website, including tempo-free statistics, Pomeroy also maintains data on non-numeric factors such as offensive and defensive style of play. One such measure that Pomeroy uses is called log5, a proprietary blend of data for projecting the likelihood of teams advancing in conference and national tournaments. The equations for Pomeroy's log5 projections were originally created by Bill James. Throughout the season, Pomeroy continually updates his KenPom ratings for all 351 Division I men's basketball programs with metrics such as offensive and defensive efficiency, tempo, and pace. Although his site was more of a personal venture when it was founded, Pomeroy's research is used by numerous college basketball teams in an attempt to gain a competitive advantage. The accuracy of Pomeroy's rankings in predicting game outcomes has been noted by popular newspapers and blogs such as FiveThirtyEight, Mediaite, and The Wall Street Journal."

  "text" : "Katharine Birbalsingh is the headteacher of Michaela Community School, a free school in the London Borough of Brent. She is also a blogger and writer who writes about the British education system. She was born in New Zealand to West Indian parents and grew up in Canada. She was then educated at Oxford University, where she read French and Philosophy. After graduating she settled permanently in the UK. Birbalsingh originally gained attention as the anonymous blogger To Miss With Love, in which she wrote about her experiences teaching at an inner-city secondary school. She then came to national prominence after she spoke at the 2010 Conservative Party conference in support of the party's education policies and criticised the state of the British education system. Due to the fact that she illustrated her speech with pictures of pupils without their consent she was asked not to attend her school \"for the rest of the week while senior teachers and governors discuss her position\". Birbalsingh subsequently resigned after being \"asked to comply with conditions that she did not feel able to comply with\", according to a report by David Barrett of The Sunday Telegraph. A campaign on Facebook was created to have her reinstated. In September 2014, she said that \"it was a great tragedy that Michael Gove had been removed as education secretary before his work was done. It will not be done now.\" Birbalsingh's novel, \"To Miss with Love\", based on her blog, was published in March 2011. It was chosen as Book of the Week and serialised on BBC Radio 4. She is also the author of the chick-lit novel \"Singleholic\", published in 2009 under the pseudonym \"Katherine Bing\"."

  "text" : "Kjeld Lauridsen Stub (10 December 1607 – 20 April 1663) was a Dano-Norwegian priest. He was also involved in the Thirty Years' War in various roles. He was born in Varberg, then-Denmark as a son of vicar Laurids Kjeldsen Stub and his wife Margrethe Hansdatter. He attended school in Landskrona and Slagelse before studying at the University of Copenhagen from 1626 to 1628. During a subsequent travel around continental Europe, he volunteered in Brabant to fight for the Holy Roman Empire in the Thirty Years' War. He reached the rank of Captain before leaving in 1631. He was a teacher in Copenhagen for less than a year, before going on another travel in Europe. This time he volunteered for the Kingdom of France. In 1635, he left the French army, finished his university education and was appointed as vicar in Christiania, one of the larger towns in the then-province Norway. In 1636, he married the daughter of Christiania bishop Nils Simonssøn Glostrup, but she died in 1641. In the same year Stub lost his position after a dispute with Christiania's burgomaster; Stub instead became vicar of rural Ullensaker. From 1643 to 1645 he participated in the Thirty Years' War for the third time, this time as a counsellor for Hannibal Sehested in the Hannibal War. He had an informal command over those who defended the Norway–Sweden border. He was probably the writer of the description of contemporary events titled Aggershusiske Acters første Quartaels summariske Beskriffuelse paa nerverende Aar 1644 flitteligen samlet oc forfattet. In 1644 he married a daughter of the burgomaster in Fredriksstad, but she died in 1648. In the 1650s he married his third wife. Kjeld Stub was an ancestor of Christian Stub, Hans Colbjørnsen, Peder Colbjørnsen, Herman Colbjørnsen, Edvard Grieg, Eiler Hagerup and Halvdan Koht. He was vicar in Ullensaker again from 1645 to 1647, then dean of Øvre Romerike and Solør for the rest of his life, despite accusations of various wrongdoings. He was also involved in business, among others Eidsvoll Iron Works. Following a driving accident in January 1663, he died in April 1663 in Ullensaker Church while holding a sermon. Streets were named after him in Jessheim (in Ullensaker), Vika, Oslo, Larvik and Strømmen. He was a signatory of the 1661 Sovereignty Act, the new constitution of Denmark-Norway, as one of the representatives of the Norwegian clerical estate, one of the two privileged estates of the realm in Denmark-Norway."

He pulled down the original chapel and rebuilt the St. Hripsime Church at Etchmiadzin as it is seen today. Komitas was also the editor of the collection of Armenian translations of patristic texts (including extracts from lost texts, e.g. Timothy Aelurus) known as the Seal of Faith. A devout Catholic, he was never far away from disputes regarding the faith. He was a vociferous participant in doctrinal disputes. He sided with the orthodox school of thought of the Armenian Church during the Council of Ctesiphon (615–616). The Council concluded with the acceptance of Monophysitism; the Chalcedonian and Nestorian doctrines were renounced. His exceptional poetical and lyrical sharakan \"Andzink nviryalk\" (\"Devoted souls\") earned him a special place in the Armenian Church hymn-book. The 'Devoted Souls' was written as a eulogy to mark the completion of the Church of St Hripsime. The work marked not just the beginning of a new church but heralding a new age in Armenian spiritual literature. The work departed from previous sharakans in that it diverted from the tradition of dwelling on the Virgin Mary or The Bible. Instead, it spoke on subjects that were first raised in History, the celebrated work of the fifth-century Armenian historian Agatangeghos, which talks about Armenia's conversion to Christianity."

  "text" : "Kwasi Boakye (24 April 1827 – 9 June 1904), sometimes archaically spelt as Aquasi Boachi, was a Dutch mining engineer who was born a Prince of the Ashanti Empire. Together with his cousin Kwame Poku he was sent in 1837 by King Kwaku Dua I to the Netherlands to receive education, as part of larger negotiations between Ashanti about the recruitment of Ashanti soldiers for the Dutch East Indies Army. Although Kwame Poku did return to the Gold Coast as planned, Kwasi Boakye stayed in the Netherlands. He was trained as a mining engineer at the fore-runner of Delft University, where he graduated in 1847. In 1850, he was sent to the Dutch East Indies. There he was discriminated by his superior Cornelius de Groot van Embden, for which he received financial compensation in 1857. As part of the compensation, he was awarded an estate in Bantar Peteh, south of Buitenzorg. He died on this estate in 1904. Dutch writer Arthur Japin wrote a novel based on the brothers' lives, De zwarte met het witte hart (1997), translated in English as The Two Hearts of Kwasi Boachi."

  "text" : "Conrad Hermann Hubertus Maria Apollinaris Josten (7 June 1912 in Neuss, Germany – 10 July 1994 in Neuss), known as Kurt Josten or C. H. Josten, was a historian of science and Curator of the Museum of the History of Science, Oxford in England. In 1921 to 1929, Josten was educated by the Jesuits at Bad Godesberg in Germany. He studied for a year at the Staatliches Gymnasium in Neuss, followed by studies at the University of Geneva, University of Freiburg, and University of Bonn. In 1934 Josten worked in the office of the then Vice-Chancellor Franz von Papen, where he was involved in conservative plots to use the extensive powers of the aging President von Hindenburg - in particular his supreme command over the army - in order to stymie a complete grab of power by the Nazi members of the Government. When those aspirations came to a bloody end during the occupation of the Papen-Offices by the SS during the Night of the Long Knives on 30 June 1934, Josten scarcely managed to escape while his immetidate superior Herbert von Bose was shot and other members of the Papen staff were arrested and taken to Lichtenburg Concentration Camp. In 1935 Josten achieved a doctorate in law from the, University of Erlangen. However, he gave up law due to disillusionment about the state of law in Germany under the Nazis. Also in 1935, he visited England, including Oxford. Jostem opposed Nazism from 1934 onwards and went into hiding in 1943 in Paris, France and then Bavaria in German. After World War II, he returned to England and eventually became a naturalized British citizen in 1954. In 1949, Josten achieved a major scholastic success when while working at the Bodleian Library, Oxford University's main library, he discovered the code used by Elias Ashmole (the founder of the Ashmolean Museum at Oxford), used to encrypt his diaries. The decoded material was eventually published in 1966. Josten became Curator of the Museum of the History of Science at Oxford in 1950. He was an expert on the early history of chemistry (alchemy), astronomy, and early astronomical instruments. He expanded the museum's collection through purchases and the major gift of the private collection of the shipping owner, Jack Billmeir. This consisted of astronomical and mathematical instruments. It was built up with the help of Josten. On his early retirement in 1964 at the age of 52, he took an emeritus curatorial position at the museum. He encouraged his successor, Francis Maddison, who was previously an assistant curator at the museum. Kurt Josen was a member of Brasenose College, Oxford (also the college of Elias Ashmole) and a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries.He lived in rooms in St John Street in central Oxford. Josten married Constanze Josten in 1962. She died in 1968."

  "text" : "Kathy Bergen (born December 24, 1939) is an American Masters athletics track and field athlete. She is the current world record holder in the W70 100 meters and the high jump. She also holds the Indoor World records for the W65 high jump, the W70 60 meters, 200 meters and high jump. And she holds the American record for the W70 200 meters and the W65 high jump. She is the oldest woman to break the 15 second barrier in the 100 meters and to break 32 seconds in the 200 meters.She is also the first 70-year-old woman to jump 1.30 meters in the high jump at USATF Masters Championships in Sacramento in 2010. 54 and a half years of age is not the normal time for someone to become an athlete. Even amongst senior athletes, where groups correspond with ages evenly divisible by 5, that would be disadvantageous. But the mother of five was not approaching the sport with high aspirations. Her only previous athletic pursuits were two years of high school basketball and many years of playing tennis at as high as 4.0 level and occasionally playing doubles with her husband, Bert. It was chasing the ball in those tennis matches that her husband noticed she was rather quick. Both of them went to the Pasadena Senior Olympics in 1994, where her relative speed vs. other people in her age group showed up. By the end of 1996, she already held the W55 American record in the high jump. She has a professional coach, who has worked with athletes more than 50 years her junior. \"She hasn't reached her peak yet, I definitely think we can break the records she already set.\"— Eric Dixon, Bergen's coach In 2010, she set the W70 100 meter World Record before an audience of thousands at the Mt. SAC Relays. Bergen was featured in ESPN Magazine October 1, 2012 issue in an article called \"Senior moments.\" Upon ageing up to the 75-79 age group in 2015, Kathy broke 6 World Records-3 Indoor Records in the 60m, 200m and high jump, 3 Outdoor Records in the 100m, 200m and high jump. She also broke an American Record in the discus throw. USATF Masters committee named her 2015 co-winner of the Female Masters Athlete of the Year Award"

  "text" : "Kardam (Bulgarian: Кардам) was the ruler of Bulgaria (777 – after 796/before 803). The name of Kardam is first encountered in the Byzantine sources in 791, when Emperor Constantine VI embarked on an expedition against Bulgaria, in retaliation for Bulgarian incursions in the Struma valley since 789. Kardam pre-empted the Byzantine invasion and met the enemy near Adrianople in Thrace. The Byzantine army was defeated and turned to flight. In 792 Constantine VI led another army against the Bulgarians and encamped at Marcellae (near Karnobat), which he proceeded to fortify. Kardam arrived with his army on July 20 and occupied the neighboring heights. After some time passed with the two forces sizing up, Constantine VI gave in to the reassuring advice of a \"false prophet\" and ordered the attack. But the Byzantine forces lost formation and once again were defeated and turned to flight, while Kardam captured the imperial tent and the emperor's servants (battle of Marcelae). After his return to Constantinople, Constantine VI signed a peace treaty and undertook to pay an annual tribute to Bulgaria. By 796 the imperial government was recalcitrant and Kardam found it necessary to demand the tribute while threatening to devastate Thrace if it were not paid. According to the chronicler Theophanes the Confessor, Constantine VI mocked the demand by having dung sent instead of gold as \"fitting tribute\" and promising to lead a new army against the elderly Kardam at Marcellae. Once again the emperor headed north, and once again he encountered Kardam in the vicinity of Adrianople. The armies faced each other for 17 days without entering into battle, while the two monarchs probably engaged in negotiations. In the end conflict was averted and the peace resumed on the same terms as in 792. The reign of Kardam represents the restoration of order in Bulgaria, which had suffered from a rapid turnover of rulers and had been repeatedly defeated by the Byzantines in the third quarter of the 8th century. Kardam not only stood his ground against Constantine VI (who was trying to emulate his much more successful grandfather and namesake Constantine V), but he may have succeeded in precipitating a crisis at the Byzantine court, where Constantine VI's repeated failures undermined the emperor's position and he was dethroned by his mother Irene in 797. Kardam probably did not long survive his opponent, as he is not heard of after 796 and was already dead in 803. The 17th century Volga Bulgar compilation Ja'far Tarikh (a work of disputed authenticity) represents Karadžam (i.e., Kardam) as the brother of Azan Tokta (i.e., Toktu), and as the grandson of Suvar (Sevar). The same source represents his successor Korym (i.e., Krum), as his nephew. If all this is correct, Kardam's accession signifies the final restoration of the Dulo clan, which would have retained the throne until the death of Roman in 997."

  "text" : "Kevin MacNeil is a Scottish novelist, poet and playwright born and raised in the Outer Hebrides. His latest novel, \"The Brilliant & Forever\", was published by Polygon in March 2016. MacNeil's previous novels, A Method Actor's Guide to Jekyll and Hyde (Polygon, 2011)  and best-selling debut, The Stornoway Way (Hamish Hamilton, 2005), were both published to widespread critical acclaim. MacNeil’s first book, the poetry collection Love and Zen in the Outer Hebrides (Canongate, 1998), won the Tivoli Europa Giovani International Poetry Prize for best poetry collection published in Europe by a writer under 35. He is also the author of Be Wise Be Otherwise (Canongate) and the plays Sweetness, an adaptation of a novel by Swedish author Torgny Lindgren, and The Callanish Stoned (Theatre Hebrides), and his short stories have been published extensively. MacNeil's anthology of poetry from the Scottish islands, These Islands, We Sing, was published by Polygon in June 2011. He often collaborates with visual artists and musicians. The album Kevin MacNeil and Willie Campbell Are Visible From Space (An Lanntair)  was released to acclaim in 2011. A single taken from the album, Local Man Ruins Everything (Fantastic Plastic) was formerly Single of the Week in The Guardian, in The List and on Steve Lamacq's BBC Radio 6 show. MacNeil was the inaugural Iain Crichton Smith Bilingual Writing Fellow and has held further prestigious writing residencies in Sweden (Uppsala University), Bavaria (Villa Concordia) and a number of other places, including lecturing on the Creative Writing MSc at Edinburgh University. He has recently become an honorary writer in residence at Kingston University. MacNeil is also a keen cyclist, and in September 2009 cycled 1300 km of the Danube, from source to Budapest, on a fixed-gear track bike, for two cancer charities; the BBC filmed a documentary about him and his bike ride which took just a dozen cycling days. In 2012, he cycled from Ness, in the north of the Isle of Lewis, to Leverburgh, in the south of Harris, on a fixed gear bike, to raise money for local hospice Bethesda, where his late mother was cared for in her final months."

  "text" : "Katie Saylor (born October 23, 1951) is a former American actress. Adopted as a baby by fashion designer Larry Aldrich, Saylor was born and raised in Connecticut and studied with the American Theater Wing/Academy of Dramatic Arts in New York City and at the Shelton Actors Lab in San Francisco. After beginning her acting career in off-Broadway theatre, Saylor relocated to Los Angeles in 1973 and worked primarily as a B movie actress prior to landing the female lead in the NBC-TV science fiction series The Fantastic Journey. The show began filming December 26, 1976, and premiered on February 3, 1977. Saylor's character Lianna, \"daughter of an Atlantean father and an extraterrestrial mother\", was introduced in the second episode. She appeared in all subsequent episodes through episode eight. She was absent from episode nine, the last broadcast in its original time slot before the series' cancellation. A tenth episode was broadcast June 16, 1977, but it did not include Saylor. Saylor married attorney Harvey Strassman in November 1976. Strassman represented Noah Dietrich in Dietrich's lawsuit against his long-time employer Howard Hughes. It has been alleged that Saylor died of cancer in 1991, but her father's 2001 obituary in The New York Times indicates that at the time, she was a surviving daughter. Also, there are current reports that Harvey Strassman and Katie Strassman reside in the Studio City neighborhood of Los Angeles."

  "text" : "Ken Hall (born 13 November 1980) is a former Australian rules football player from Tasmania. He played junior football in his home state and spent two years in the seniors at North Hobart. Hall then moved to Victoria in 2001 to play for Essendon Football Club's reserves side in the Victorian Football League (VFL). He played for the reserves for a year before being drafted onto Essendon's rookie list for the 2002 season. Hall was promoted to the senior list midway through 2002 and subsequently made his Australian Football League (AFL) debut, although he did not record a statistic in what was to be his only AFL match. He was retained on the Bombers' rookie list for 2003 and was again elevated to the senior list during the season. Although he was often named as an emergency after his promotion, Hall was unable to break into the senior team and Essendon delisted him at the end of 2003, ending his AFL career. After being delisted Hall played with the Tasmanian Devils in the VFL for four seasons, before rejoining his old side, Tasmanian Football League (TFL) team North Hobart, in 2008. He won two best and fairest awards and captained the club in his time with North Hobart before retiring at the conclusion of the 2011 season."

Kot terrorized Kraków, the city he was born and raised in, with atrocious crimes for two years before he was finally captured on 12 July 1966. Due to the seemingly random choices of victims, which included children and elderly people, Kot was nicknamed \"the vampire of Kraków\". Kot had passed the school-leaving examinations in high school and planned to become a student at an Officer Candidate School. After the trial, in which he pleaded guilty of the crimes he was charged with, he was sentenced to death, which was announced on 14 July 1967. The death penalty was carried out on 16 May 1968 and Kot was executed at the age of 21."

In 1921, she recorded four sides for Black Swan Records in the classic female blues style, accompanied by Fletcher Henderson's Orchestra. She toured in 1922–23 as the star of a revue, \"Liza and Her Shuffling Sextet\", which included Fats Waller. She subsequently formed a revue, \"Katie Crippen and Her Kids\", in which she was accompanied by a teenaged Count Basie. In the later 1920s she appeared in revues at the Lafayette Theater in New York City and toured the RKO theater circuit with Dewey Brown as Crippen & Brown. After a long illness, Crippen died of cancer in New York City on November 25, 1929. She is buried in Merion Memorial Park, in Bala Cynwyd, Pennsylvania, outside of Philadelphia.

  "text" : "Kosta Angeli Radovani (6 October 1916 – 27 February 2002) was a Croatian sculptor and member of the Croatian Academy of Sciences and Arts. After World War II he was one of the founders of the Zagreb Academy of Applied Arts in 1950 where he was the head of the department of sculpture until the academy closed in 1955. From 1977 until his retirement in 1987 he worked as a professor at the Department of Sculpture at the Faculty of Fine Arts in Sarajevo. He was a guest professor at the International Summer Academy in Salzburg in 1987, 1988 and 1991. In his artistic work, he primarily dealt with the human figure, and his oeuvre contains many nudes and portraits. He made over 30 large-scale public sculptures, such as the one dedicated to the Drežnica Uprising (1949), a monument dedicated to the Zagreb victims who died in NOB Dotrščina, Zagreb (1988–1991) and the monument dedicated to Franjo Bučar located on the Sports Square, Zagreb (1991). A series of some 20 female nudes entitled Dunje are considered to hold an important place in his oeuvre. Radovani also made small sculptures and medals and his opus contains 400 portraits and almost the same number of portrait medals, as well as over 800 small sculptures. Radovani exhibited at many solo exhibitions in Croatia and abroad (Athens, Prague, Tunis, Salzburg, Pordenone), and participated in more than 600 group exhibitions, 50 of which were of international significance. In 1950 he participated at the Venice Biennale along with Vanja Radauš, Vojin Bakić and Zoran Mušič. In 1973 he had a retrospective exhibition at the Modern Gallery in Zagreb, on which occasion a monograph was published to mark 40 years of his work. He received many awards for his work and in 1987 he received the Vladimir Nazor Award for life achievement."

Ring publishes almanacs each year for New Zealand, Australia and Ireland in which he provides weather predictions for the entire year. His New Zealand almanac covers 64 towns. Ring's methods are unscientific and have been widely criticised as fake and pseudoscience by many scientists in the fields of meteorology and geology. Ring says he predicted the 4 September 2010 Christchurch earthquake and the deadly 22 February 2011 Christchurch earthquake. He also said there would probably be an earthquake in Marlborough or north Canterbury \"just before noon\" on 20 March 2011. This caused some residents to leave Christchurch and led to criticism from scientists and sceptics. Further research into his predictions showed that his forecasting record did not hold up under scrutiny."

His experiences in the 2011 Great Tohoku Kanto earthquake were recounted in an op-ed piece in the New York Times under the title, \"In Japan, No Time Yet for Grief\" translated by Seiji M. Lippit. After graduating from high school he moved to Tokyo and worked various jobs including in magazines and as an electrician for 10 years. In the op-ed he writes:\"Before I became a writer, I worked for 10 years as an electrician, until I suffered asbestos poisoning. My main job was to travel around Tokyo, repairing lights, including street lamps and the hallway and stairway lights in apartment buildings.\"His 1990 novel Short Circuit was based on those experiences working as an electrician. The following year, 1991, he returned with his wife to his hometown of Sendai, where he has lived since. In 1997 he spent a year in Norway, writing about those experiences in the novel Norge, for which he received the 2007 Noma Literary Prize."

  "text" : "Ken Grimley (born 7 February 1936) is a former Australian rules footballer who played with Fitzroy in the Victorian Football League (VFL). Grimley was a rugby league full-back while growing up in Brisbane and only took up Australian football after leaving school. He started out in the Wilston Grange junior team but soon broke into the seniors and in 1955 played in the club's first ever QANFL premiership. The following year he was the league's top goal-kicker with over 100 goals. He spent just one season at Fitzroy, having been invited to the club by officials he met during an exhibition game in Brisbane. In just his second appearance, but first full game, Grimley kicked six goals from full-forward against Geelong at Kardinia Park. After he returned to Wilston Grange in 1958 he is credited as having convinced the club to adopt a Gorilla as their logo, which Fitzroy had changed from the previous year. Grimley, who also played as a ruckman, switched to Coorparoo in 1959 and played grand finals in his first six seasons at the club. He was the runner-up in the 1961 Grogan Medal but won it in 1964. The early 1960s also saw him play many of his 22 interstate appearances for Queensland and the state was undefeated under his captaincy in 1963 and 1964. A son, Brett Grimley, also played with Fitzroy, to create the first instance of a Queensland father and son combination playing in the VFL. In 2003, Grimley was named as the ruckman in the official \"Queensland Team of the Century\", next to rovers Michael Voss and Jason Akermanis."

  "text" : "Kidda is the artist name for UK electronic music and video producer Ste McGregor. Described by one national newspaper in the UK as “a bearded 30-something one-man cottage industry”, he is signed to the Brighton-based Skint Records – the home of Fatboy Slim, aka Norman Cook. McGregor has released one album on Skint, \"Going Up\", and his second long-player \"Hotel Radio\" is scheduled for release in the summer of 2011.His track \"Under The Sun\" was used in Bacardi’s worldwide TV advertising campaign, and other singles from his debut sample-based album such as \"Strong Together\" have made the charts in several European countries including Italy, Belgium and Holland, and has recently been licensed to Ultra Records in America.In addition to being a recording artist and DJ, Kidda is an animator and video director and has made music promos for assorted artists such as Midfield General, the Lo-Fidelity Allstars, X-Press 2 and Phil Kieran – as well as completing animation work for the stage shows of US artists Kanye West and Rihanna. McGregor also sewed his own tapestry to make up the artwork for his 2008-released album \"Going Up\". Born and raised in Middlesbrough in the north-east of England, McGregor moved to Nottingham in the Midlands region of the UK to study fine art. In his spare time he began to craft hip-hop beats, and after completing an MA in animation back in Middlesbrough he moved to Brighton on the south coast of England. He moved into a house with Skint Records artist Danielsan, and was soon invited to make a promo video for Danielsan’s \"Force Ten\" single. This led to more video work with other Skint Records artists, and after a couple of EPs for the Brighton-based Catskills Records in the mid-2000s (decade) – \"The Shoe Cash EP\" and \"The Word Booty EP\" – he signed to Skint as a recording artist.Kidda’s debut album featured Gary Lightbody from indie band Snow Patrol (on \"Shining 1\") and various other vocalists, and was notable for being constructed from samples that were then all re-recorded. First single from the album, \"Smile\", used the theme tune from BBC sports show Ski Sunday, while \"Under The Sun\" contained elements of a song written by US songwriters Ashford and Simpson. A section of the single was used in a Bacardi worldwide TV advertising campaign, although most of the money the spirits company paid for its use went to Ashford and Simpson's publishers EMI. The \"Going Up\" album received favourable reviews in most music publications. “With infectious hooks, tasty beats and soul-tinged melodies, Kidda’s debut feels like the natural sequel to The Avalanches’ universally acclaimed ‘Since I Left You’,” said MOJO magazine. It was awarded album of the month status in DJ magazine, album of the week in DMC Update, while BBC Music said: “Somewhere between funk, pop, hip-hop and old skool rave, ‘Going Up’ is the perfect soundtrack to this summer’s festivals.” However, the same review went on to say: \"While Going Up's blatant and intended cheesiness appeals to this particular scribe, more straight-laced musos may find it all a bit too camp and annoying. Basically Kidda's a bit like Marmite; you'll either love him or hate him.\" The NME, meanwhile, said: \"Like airy muzak in a shopping centre, most of ‘Going Up’ washes over you.\" The remix of \"Under The Sun\" by British producer Hervé was a club hit supported by the likes of BBC Radio One's Annie Mac and Kissy Sellout and was subsequently licensed to a number of compilations, including Ministry Of Sound’s \"The Annual 2009\" and Godskitchen \"Anthems 2009\". \"Strong Together\" was also used on a TV ad for Warner Leisure.Second album \"Hotel Radio\" is thought to have a more pop-orientated feel, and contain no samples whatsoever – it’s purported to be all original songwriting from Kidda and his co-writer Lee Muddy Baker. McGregor is also thought to be preparing a live show to support the release of \"Hotel Radio\"."

  "text" : "Kevin Baden Manser (16 February 1929 – 21 December 2001) was an Australian actor best known for his career as a Dalek operator in the early seasons of the British science-fiction television series Doctor Who. He was born in Adelaide and worked for South Australian Engineering and Water Supply until 1957, when he emigrated to London to work as a stage manager. This led to later work as a theatrical and television actor. In 1969 he returned to Australia and continued to play small parts on television while becoming involved with Doctor Who conventions. He wrote his autobiography, The Memoirs of a Dalek, in 2001, after being diagnosed with the cancer that eventually resulted in his death at the end of that year. Amongst his TV and film roles, included appearances in the TV mini-series Bodyline (1984) and The Dismissal (1983), the film The Year My Voice Broke (1987) and appearing as Australian prime-minister William McMahon in the mini-series Vietnam (1987)."

Excerpts from two of his novels have been translated into English: The Scalpel  and Gorilla. Riahi has been translated into English, French, Italian and Hebrew. He was one of the 39 Arab writers under 40 years who were selected for the anthology Beirut39. In an interview 'White Skin, Black Mask', Kamel Riahi explained: \"It might come as a surprise to you to learn that Negro was the term people called my black grandfather. I consider myself as someone of a Negro decent, although I am not black. Perhaps my wide nose proves this theory. Therefore, I am sympathetic towards the blacks ideologically, by heritage and by history. We, the whites, will not be liberated until we liberate ourselves from the racist views we have of other races and religions.\""

  "text" : "Kenneth E. Clark is an American mortgage executive and author of “The Story Behind the Mortgage and Housing Meltdown: The Legacy of Greed,” published in 2010 (ISBN 978-1-4520-5439-1). He is also the host of the housing and mortgage information radio program, “Rebuilding the Dream” on WMAL (www.WMAL.com), a Baltimore-based talk radio station owned by Citadel Broadcasting Company. Clark is the founder and chairman of First Guaranty Mortgage Corporation, based in McLean, VA, a mortgage lender licensed in 44 states specializing in residential lending. He maintains an active management role in the company, coming out of semi-retirement prior to the mortgage meltdown to lead the firm away from the prevalent lending practices of the time, which he felt were overly risky. Clark is a vocal proponent for financial literacy and the systemic restructuring of the country’s mortgage lending paradigms. He is a particular advocate for a balanced involvement in mortgage lending by the federal government, differing from the largely non-government participation philosophy voiced by many in Congress. He has expressed strong support for reducing the footprint of Government Sponsored Enterprises (GSEs) Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, but believes some forms of federal support for the industry are necessary to bring about a long-term housing recovery. He is especially supportive of the role of the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) and the Government National Mortgage Association (Ginnie Mae) in providing a means for home ownership for deserving borrowers. Clark is especially critical of the lending establishment’s over-reliance on technology and credit scoring to render decisions. He frequently expresses the opinion in interviews that abdication of human lending judgment to technology was a key enabler of the subprime mortgage crisis."

  "text" : "Klaus Guido Grutzka (February 9, 1923, in Breslau (Wroclaw), Upper Silesia, Germany – March 28, 2011, in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, US) was a German artist.His father, Johan (Jan) Grutzka, (Grudska) was born in Krakau (Kraków), Upper Silesia. He began working as a young man in a coal mine and enjoyed drawing and painting in his spare time. His artistic talents came to the attention of a local nobel man who decided to sponsor young Grudska. Throughout his career he painted industrial motives as well as the insides of Catholic churches. (Frescos ?)Johann Grudska met his wife Helene, they got married and had two children, one a girl, named her Marianne and a son, whom they named Klaus Guido. As a young man, Klaus moved from Breslau to Kiel, a Baltic harbor town and one of the major naval ports in Germany, the Baltic port at the end of the Kiel Canal. There, around 1940, he joined the Kriegsmarine as an officer’s candidate. During his navy time he underwent training as an engineer. First on a destroyer, which was attacked and sank and he barely survived this harrowing experience. His next command was that of a Chief Engineer on a German submarine, in charge of its massive diesel engines. At the end of the war the crew of his U-boot as well as the crews of many other U-boots became P.O.W. He had married his first wife, Eva, née Koenn, in Kiel, around the end of 1942. They had a son, Claus, who was born in 1945. Before the son was born, Klaus Grutzka went into P.O.W. camp in Scotland. These German navy soldiers were told that they had to transfer the U-boots to a Scottish port, Stranraer in order to scuttle the vessels off of the Scottish shoreline. He remained a P.O.W for a while, but then returned to Kiel, to his wife and young son. Art and painting had always been in his blood, a talent inherited from his father. Klaus then enrolled in the prestigious “Muthesius Werkschule” in Kiel and a formal art study for several years. During that time period he already began to make a name for himself in the local art world. He started illustrating local volumes of books about the region, and participated repeatedly in the annual poster competition for the world famous sailing event, the Kiel Week. One of his posters was accepted as one of the ambassadors for this very prestigious sailing event. His interest in heavy machinery, shipbuilding and Diesel engines had continued during his studies in Kiel. After divorcing his first wife, Eva, he met the love of his life, Sybilla Hamilton, an Irish-born journalist and language instructor. Together they moved to Essen, a city in the center of the “Ruhrgebiet”. This area was the absolute center of Germany’s coal mining and steel mill industry. For several years he worked for energy giants RWE, Krupp and the [[Dortmund (beer)Dortmund Union Brewery]]. Amongst others, he designed the world-famous logo for the Union Brewery, the stylized capital \"U\" logo, still used on every bottle, can and barrel the brewery produced. During that period of his life he took two significant fact finding journeys. One brought him to Moscow in what was then the USSR and the second one enabled him to discover parts of North America. He instantly was completely fascinated by this magnificent Metropolis New York. A friend and fellow alumnus from the Muthesius Werkschule, Eberhard Lüthke, had immigrated to America earlier. Lüthke had suggested they should join him and his wife in this young, exciting country. Upon his return to Essen, he and his wife, Irish-born Sybil started packing for the move to the New World. All of their belongings, including an old, pretty well used VW Beetle were packed into freight containers and shipped to New York, In 1963 they together set foot on this continent, which would become their home for the rest of both of their fascinating lives. At first they settled in an apartment in Astoria, a neighborhood by the East River, where many German immigrants had already begun to settle. Together they began to explore this new fascinating world, its skyscrapers and factories, steel mills and coal mines.Later they became friends with another German immigrant in New Jersey who offered to rent to them half of her house in Hoboken, New Jersey. They had struck gold. The view from that house overlooked the Hudson River and Manhattan with the gigantic George Washington Bridge to the left. The many paintings and line drawings Grutzka produced during that period are proof of his total fascination with that area and the ever-changing scenery before him every day. At that time he developed important contacts with the steel magazine “33”. He produced over 100 covers for that magazine, which got widespread recognition in the Art world as well as the Steel industry.He also partnered with Richard “Dick” Deily, a steal industry researcher. Together they published an internationally acclaimed newsletter, “IISS” Institute for Iron and Steel Studies. At that same time he also taught at the DuCret School of Art in Plainfield, New Jersey He also developed new contacts with the Hess Corporation in Woodbridge, New Jersey, as well as Exxon, then still called ESSO and, most importantly for him, Bethlehem Steel. He traveled nationwide, produced contract work for several major international oil and steel corporations. All this time the cover for “33” was still one of his most significant achievements. His most important client was Bethlehem Steel, where he established archival paintings of steel mills which shortly after he completed his paintings, were pretty much all dismantled. In Pittsburgh, huge tracts of land alongside of the Susquehanna River, once busy with huge steel mills and railroad tracks, needed to provide raw materials. Here in the North East the remaining, abandoned steel mills can be found in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, as well as several other locations, bearing witness to the once magnificent grandeur of the American steel industry. Fewer contracts meant looking for a shift in direction for Grutzka. The world famous Hill School in Pottstown, Pa, was the answer. He was offered a position as an assistant professor in the Arts Department. For about 8 years he remained there, made many new friends and even more admirers. One of his former students was a young Brazilian artist, who referred to Grutzka as one of his most important artistic influences. This young man went on to design the twin Laser Display, “Tribute in Light”, commemorating the 9/11 attack on the site where the twin towers once proudly stood, bearing testament to the American Spirit. After several years of teaching at the “Hill School”, he and his wife Sybil moved to Lancaster in Pennsylvania, where this extremely productive artist continued his creative work for more than 20 years until his passing in March, 2011"

Most notably, he has worked on soundtracks of various Dragon Ball video games. Yamamoto has also composed background music for Dragon Ball Kai, a revamped version of the anime series Dragon Ball Z. On March 9, 2011, Toei Animation publicly acknowledged that many of Yamamoto's musical works for the series infringed upon unidentified third-party copyrights. As a result, Toei removed Yamamoto and replaced his compositions with those from the original Dragon Ball Z series written by Shunsuke Kikuchi. The plagiarism of these works have been known to fans since May 2010. His compositions in the games were also replaced."

Olukotun did his undergraduate studies at Calvin College, and his doctoral studies in computer engineering at the University of Michigan, under the supervision of Trevor N. Mudge. In the mid-1990s, Olukotun and his co-authors argued that multi-core computer processors were likely to make better use of hardware than existing superscalar designs.In 2000, while a professor at Stanford, Olukotun founded Afara Websystems, a company that designed and manufactured multi-core SPARC-based computer processors for data centers. Afara was purchased by Sun Microsystems in 2002; at Sun, Olukotun was one of the architects of the 2005 UltraSPARC T1 processor.In 2008, Olukotun returned to Stanford, and founded the Pervasive Parallelism Laboratory at Stanford after gathering US$6M in funding from several computer-industry corporations. His recent work focuses on domain-specific programming languages that can allow algorithms to be easily adapted to multiple different types of parallel hardware including multi-core systems, graphics processing units, and field-programmable gate arrays. Olukotun is also a member of the board of advisors of UDC, a Nigerian venture capital firm. He was elected as a Fellow of the Association for Computing Machinery in 2006 for his \"contributions to multiprocessors on a chip and multi threaded processor design\". He became a Fellow of the IEEE in 2008. Olukotun has used several words from his African heritage in his research. Afara, the name of the company he founded, means \"bridge\" in the Yoruba language, and he has named his server at Stanford Ogun after the Yoruba god of iron and steel, a play on words since large computers are frequently called big iron."

Descended from 6 generations of artists, Macpherson was a novelist, photographer, critic and film-maker. It is only in recent years that Macpherson's contribution to cinematography has come to be recognised with the re-discovery of his work, which, though limited in output, was far ahead of its time, both in subject matter and cinematic technique. His 1930 film, Borderline, is now very much part of the curriculum in the study of modern cinematography today. In his work with the Pool Group (1927–1933), which he co-founded with Bryher and HD, Macpherson also established the influential film journal, Close Up."

  "text" : "Kasriel Broydo (1907–1945) was a songwriter, singer and coupletist. He was born in Vilnius and played in various troupes and marionette-theaters. His lyrics and songs, like Hot zikh a zun aza breyte tseshpreytn (The sun has spread around), were the folk songs of his place and time. After the first World War Broydo moved to France and continued to work in theater. When Germany invaded Poland, he returned to Vilna. He was an integral and cherished participant, as writer, director and actor, to almost all the revi-theater programs in the Vilna ghetto theaters. An example of his inspirational skill was Tsum besern morgn (Toward a better tomorrow), a 1943 song of hope which he wrote when it seemed the Soviet forces might prevail against the Germans. His last program in the Vilna ghetto, called Moyshe, halt zikh (Hold on, Moyshe!), was almost ready for performance when, during the liquidation of the ghetto in September 1943, Broydo was seized by the Gestapo. He was taken to Estonia, where he and his friends, Sime and Marek Shapiro, although interred, created performances for their fellow inmates in the labor camp. It was at this time that Broydo became religious. Broydo's song Bay undz iz shtendik finster (It's always dark for us), music by Henech Kon, written on a motif by Moshe Broderzon, was taken into Sh. Katsherginski's Lider fun di getos un lagern; the Vilna Ghetto Ensemble performed it in the revue Men kon gornit visn (One Never Knows). Broydo's most famous song may be Tsi darf es azoy zayn? (Must it always be this way?) sung in revi-theaters in Poland before the Second World War. In 1945 he was sent to Königsberg (Kaliningrad), Germany, where he and hundreds of other Jews were thrown in the Baltic sea and drowned."

After playing at Campbell College (now Campbell University), he became a high school basketball coach. During his 24-year coaching career at Burlington Township High School, Faulkner led the team to a 521-129 record and three NJSIAA Group I state championships. He stepped down from his position as coach in 1996 to take a post as principal of Thomas O.

  "text" : "Khenpo Sodargye(Tibetan：མཁན་པོ བསོད་དར་རྒྱས；Chinese:索达吉堪布)was born in the eastern region of Tibet known as Kham in 1962, and was ordained in 1985 at the renowned Larung Buddhist Institute, the largest Buddhist academy of its kind in the world., also in present-day Sichuan province of the PRC. He trained closely with Khenchen Jigme Phuntsok Rinpoche, who was himself one of the great luminaries of his generation. Khenpo Sodargye studied the traditional course of philosophical treatises and also received the entire corpus of Tibetan esoteric Buddhist transmissions.(These teachings include the five principle treatises on Madhyamaka, Prajnaparamita, Abhidharma, Vinaya, and Buddhist Logic, as well as the Great Perfection, Kalachakra, and Mipham Rinpoche's Guhyagarbha Tantra and Longchenpa's Seven Treasuries and Trilogy of Finding Comfort and Ease.) He was eventually placed in charge of the Institute where he became one of the principal teachers. He also served as Jigme Phuntsok Rinpoche’s main translator for Chinese disciples and was assigned by Rinpoche to teach them. Khenpo Sodargye has become one of the most eminent contemporary Buddhist masters. As a Tibetan lama, a Buddhist scholar and teacher, a prolific translator into Chinese, and a modern Buddhist thinker, he is renowned across Asia and the west for his interest in the integration of traditional Buddhist teachings with global issues and modern life. He has lectured extensively across China and other parts of Asia, Oceania, Europe as well as Africa and North America. He has recently given lectures at a number of prestigious Universities including Peking University, Tsinghua, Harvard, Columbia, Yale, Princeton, Stanford, Oxford, Cambridge, University of Toronto, McGill University, University of Auckland, Melbourne University, University of Tokyo, Waseda University, National University of Singapore, National Taiwan University, University of Hong Kong and University of Göttingen. Khenpo often says, “I don’t know how long I can live, but even if there were only one listener, I would exert myself to benefit him with Dharma till my last breath.” Recent Publications: Living through Suffering, To Do Is to Gain, Cruelty Is Youth, The Cutter-A Commentary on the Diamond Sutra, Always Present (available in English), Everything You Wish, What Makes You So Busy?, Letting Go, Everything?, Leaving behind, the Whole World?"

  "text" : "Kurt Kossmann (born Kurt Arthur Kossmann on April 28, 1971) is an American professional race car driver who is known for being the first amputee to compete in the 24 Hours of Daytona. Kurt is a cancer survivor who lost his left leg, above the knee, to an osteosarcoma in 1988. Kurt underwent thirteen months of chemotherapy before making a full recovery. During his recovery Kurt designed a prosthetic leg specifically for operating the clutch system in a race car. This device allowed him to continue his racing career in the Barber Pro Series, Grand American Road Racing Championship, and eventually enter the 24 Hours of Daytona in 2009. Kurt has worked with various charities and organizations to raise awareness and donations for childhood cancer. Since overcoming his illness, Kurt has teamed with Paul Newman's Hole in the Wall Gang Camp and One Lap of America for fundraising events. Kurt was also the only amputee racer to ever compete in the BMW BoxerCup motorcycle series. He raced the American inauguration event at the Daytona International Speedway in 2003 during the annual Daytona Bike Week."

  "text" : "Keith Raphael Briffa (born 1952) is a climatologist employed since 1977 by the University of East Anglia, where he is now emeritus professor and deputy director of the Climatic Research Unit. He has authored or co-authored over 130 scholarly articles, chapters and books. In his professional work, he focuses on climate change in the late Holocene, with a special focus on northern portions of Europe and Asia. Briffa's preferred method is dendroclimatology, which is a set of procedures intended to decode information about the past climate from tree rings. Briffa helped develop data sets from trees from Canada, Fennoscandia, and northern Siberia which have been used in climate research. He completed his PhD at the University of East Anglia entitled \"Tree-climate relationships and dendroclimatological reconstruction in British Isles\" in 1984. From 1994 to 2000, Briffa served on the scientific steering committee (SSC) of the PAGES project; more recently he also served on SSCs for the UK NERC Rapid Climate Change and the European Science Foundation's HOLIVAR program. Briffa served as Lead Author on chapter 6 (Paleoclimatology) of working group I of the 2007 IPCC Fourth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Briffa previously served as associate editor of the scholarly journals Holocene, Boreas and Dendrochronologia."

  "text" : "Keppel Harcourt Barnard (31 March 1887 – 22 September 1964) was a South African zoologist and museum director. He was the only son of Harcourt George Barnard M.A. (Cantab.), a solicitor from Lambeth, and Anne Elizabeth Porter of Royston. Barnard was born in London. His first education was at a private school in Camberley from where he went to the Realgymnasium in Mannheim to improve his German. From 1905 to 1908 this unusually gifted and versatile scholar attended Christ's College, Cambridge, taking the Natural Sciences Tripos in Botany, Geology and Zoology. He also took the newly introduced courses in Anthropology, Ethnology and Geography. For the following three years he studied law at the Middle Temple, becoming a barrister in 1911. After a short spell as naturalist with the Marine Biological Laboratory in Plymouth, he joined the staff of the South African Museum in Cape Town in 1911 as a marine biology assistant. He became assistant director in 1921 and director from 1946 until his 1956 retirement when he was free to work on the molluscs. His D.Sc. was from the University of Cape Town with a dissertation on the \"Distribution of Crustacea in South African Waters\", and he eventually became a world authority on crustaceans. His other favoured field was the taxonomy and classification of South African fishes, a discipline in which he did important pioneering work. Stellenbosch University awarded him an honorary doctorate in 1956. Barnard was a keen mountaineer and served as secretary of the Mountain Club of South Africa from 1918 to 1945, and it was by way of the mountains that he met the amateur botanist Thomas Pearson Stokoe who was to become a close friend and climbing companion. Barnard's mountaineering interest first brought him into contact with the genus Colophon, and many species of the beetle, such as Colophon primosi, were named after his mountaineering friends. In 1915 he married Alice Watkins, and they raised a family of two children, a son and a daughter. Barnard died, aged 73, in Cape Town. Barnard's studies of South African Crustacea, Mollusca, fishes and insects added significantly to our knowledge of these groups. He was undoubtedly one of South Africa's greatest zoologists but a modest and retiring man despite his prodigious scientific achievements. Among the honours he received were: Fellowship of the Linnean Society of London, Fellowship of the Royal Society of South Africa, the Gold Badge of the Mountain Club of South Africa, the King George V Silver Jubilee Medal, the Senior Captain Scott Medal, and the medal and grant of the South African Association for the Advancement of Science. In 1956 the University of Stellenbosch conferred on him the degree of D.Sc. honoris causa.\"— Grindley, 1981,"

  "text" : "Keith Matthews was a prominent historian of Newfoundland, best known for his Oxford University DPhil thesis \"The West of England Newfoundland Fishery\" and for a highly influential essay \"Fence Building: A Critique of the Historeography of Newfoundland.\" Born in Plympton, Devon, Matthews left school at an early age to work as a jazz pianist in London, England. After military service he attended Ruskin College, Oxford where he pursued a degree in history. A chance meeting with Newfoundland lexicographer George M. Story resulted in Matthews being offered a fellowship if he would write on the history of the West of England Newfoundland fishery. His Dphil thesis was an important work, becoming a standard work on the history of the migratory fishery. Matthews took up work at Memorial University of Newfoundland, where he taught the history of Newfoundland and Labrador. His critique of the traditional historiography argued that previous historians had been mistaken in their assumption that conflict between competing groups had shaped the settlement and constitutional development of the island of Newfoundland. Different historians had believed that the conflict was between merchants in the west of England and settlers in Newfoundland, or between West Country merchants and London based merchants. Matthews found little evidence of such conflict and argued that settlement was not inconsistent with the migratory fishery. He argued that the laws prohibiting settlement were short-lived and ineffectual. The slow pace of settlement was, therefore, a result of other factors. In 1966 the National Archive in Britain, then called the Public Record Office, decided to dispose of the “Registrar General of Shipping and Seaman, the Agreements and Account of Crew and Official Logbooks” of the British Empire for the years between 1861 and 1913. When Matthews became aware of that he arranged for the bulk of the records to be transferred to the Maritime History Archive at Memorial University. With his colleague David Alexander, Matthews embarked upon a study of the shipping industry of Atlantic Canada."

  "text" : "K. Ahmed Khan is an Indian scientist and businessman who made success in using plastic for road construction. He is the founder of KK Plastic Waste Management Pvt.Ltd.He along with his brother Rasool Khan,stung by protests to ban plastic, hit upon the idea of recycling plastic and mixing it with bitumen to lay roads. Thanks to their enterprising spirit, they have so far laid almost 1,000 km of roads — Lalbagh Road, Cunningham Road, Old Madras Road and many others — in the city with recycled plastic. RESEARCH & IMPLEMENT Rasool, the director of K K Plastic Waste Management Private Limited, tells Bangalore Mirror how the brothers came up with the idea of recycling plastic for roads: \"In 1996, there were demands for a ban on plastic. Our entire livelihood depended on plastic as we manufacture plastic bags for our company called K K Polyflex. We also had about 100-odd employees working with us. So we thought of researching on alternate uses of plastic.\" During their research the Khans realised that plastic could be used along with bitumen to make roads. After reading up about Bangalore roads, they thought of laying such roads in the city. In 1996, Rasool (59) made the first trial use of plastic with bitumen. He successfully used the bitumen-plastic mixture to fill about 100-200 potholes on Rajalakshmi Nursing Home Road in Jayanagar. He then asked his son Amjad Khan, who was then studying chemical engineering at RV College of Engineering, to take this up as a research project and also funded it. After two years of research work, Amjad concluded that it was feasible to use bitumen-plastic in laying roads. Next, they needed the approval from experts in highway Engineering. Highway engineering professors Justo and Vir Raghavan from the Bangalore University took special interest in the idea and studied it. Now, they had to get the approval of Central Road Research Institute, Delhi. After a two-year they got the green signal from CRRI. Armed with approvals from all quarters, the brothers met the then Karnataka CM S M Krishna. Thanks to the CM's encouragement, the Khans laid their first plastic waste road in front of Rajarajeshwarinagar front gate in 2002. In the first year of their road work, they were paid Rs 11 lakh by the government. \"In 2003-04 we signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the BBMP to lay 250 km of roads,\" says Rasool. Some of the roads they have laid include Millers Road, Cunningham Road, Old Madras Road, J C Road, Lalbagh Road, almost all roads in Jayanagar, and Mysore Road till Kanakpura Junction. FROM WASTE TO ROAD The company gets approximately five tons of plastic waste every day. It buys plastic waste at Rs 6 per kg from apartments, schools, ITC factory, and pourakarmikas. Rasool says, \"We also have our own auto and lorry that picks up plastic waste strewn around the city.\" The plastic waste thus collected is cleaned and put in a shredder. The shredded bits are then stored in bags for six to seven days to drain out the moisture in them. The shredded plastic is then taken to a hot mixing plant located on the city outskirts, where it is mixed with bitumen to make roads. The bitumen-plastic mix is called K K Poly Blend. Ahmed Khan (61), an alumnus of St Joseph's College of Commerce, says, \"Normally the life of a road is about three years. But with K K Poly Blend it increases to about six to seven years. This is because the melting point of bitumen is about 60 to 70 degrees where as plastic's melting point is about 130 to 140 degrees. Moreover, Bangalore generates 5,000 tonnes of solid waste every day, out of which at least 50 tonnes is plastic. If all that plastic waste is used the remaining solid waste can be used to make organic manure.\" He reasons, \"Every day India produces 1,23,000 tonnes of waste, out of which about 2000 tonnes is plastic. If we can use all that plastic, the plastic waste problem can be solved.\" Their plastic road concept has even attracted attention from the Burmese government and entities in Italy. THE MAKING OF ‘PLASTIC’ ROADS • K K Plastic Waste Management Private Limited buys and collects about 5 five tons of plastic waste every day • The plastic waste is cleaned and shred into bits • The bits are dried for six to seven days • The shredded plastic is then taken to a hot mixing plant on the city outskirts, where it is mixed with bitumen to make roads"

In 2003, he was arrested by the State Security Investigations Service (SSI) and placed in solitary confinement for his role in the anti-war movement, causing the Stop the War Coalition in Britain to demonstrate outside the Egyptian Embassy in London."

KRISHAN started off the Tamil rap scene in Sri Lanka together with brother Gajan and fellow MC Yauwanan. KRISHAN was founder member of Urban Sound with Gajan, together the duo released “Smooth Flow” in 1998. The duo was influenced by local hiphop legends Brown boogie nation and Rude Bwoi Republic. Being mentored by Brown boogie nation, the duo released several English rap singles and formed a following in Colombo. The duo split in early 2000, when Gajan left to join BNS and KRISHAN joining IRAJ. KRISHAN later was featured on many singles produced under IRAJ including “Ninda Noyena Hadawe”, “Ran Ran Ran”, “Koththu song”,” Mata Aloke Genadhewi” and many more. KRISHAN left to UK for his higher studies in 2005, prior to that he completed his Solo debut album Asian Avenue.

KRISHAN performed at many clubs, events in the UK promoting this album and opened doors to a new era of Tamil rap music. This super hit album was produced by Yohan R. After many years of silence, KRISHAN had a comeback album titled “Avadhaaram”. The album didn’t work much in favour to the rapper, critics on the album was that the rapper had lost his touch. But yet 2 singles from this album were worldwide hits. “Amudhame” was nominated as one of the most promising songs for 2008 by BBC Radio 1. And was highly rotated by British DJ NIHAL. The song also won him an award at AVIMA in 2009 as the best hip-hop solo act. OH OH ENDHAN Darling on the other hand was a massive commercial success, being played at stations and clubs worldwide. The song was included on RADIO EXPRESS’s DANCE EXPRESS compilation along with big names Jason Derulo, Pitbull and Rhianna. The song was also included in the BEST OF HIPHOP AND RNB 2010 VOL 3 which included the best 100 tracks from the world. KRISHAN is now focusing on productions and has set up his own digital label CONNECT MEDIA and owns a studio in Colombo. He is rumoured to be working on a 3rd album, where he is focusing on his rapping and lyrical skills, and the album boasts big names from the South Indian music scene. The 3rd album is scheduled to release in December 2011. KRISHAN also is now working with prominent South Indian Music Directors on their film projects and is being featured on many Kollywood movie songs. The Sri Lankan born artist Krishan Maheson. Krishan Maheson is one of the most pioneer hiphop artists from Sri Lanka. He formed th rap group Urban Sound in 1998 with fellow musician and brother Gajan Maheson. The Maheson brothers created a stream of underground English hiphop in Sri Lanka and also had many mainstream hit singles including \"Smooth Flow\", \"Celebrities\", \"SL 2030\" and many more. The group discontinued and both continued on their solo acts with other reputed musicians in the country. Krishan was also a member of the ILL Noize hiphop crew with Iraj Weeraratne and released Sri Lanka's first ever Tri-lingual album in 2001 titled \"Iraj\".

The album consisted of many hits including \"Tholaa\", \"Raja raja Sozhaa\", \"Kaadhal Kadidham\" and \"Ninaivugalae\". The album opened doors for Krishan to reach out to the young Tamil diaspora markets in Europe and Canada in the mid 2000s. He later came back to the music scene after a 5-year absence with the album \"Avathaaram\" in 2010, and the album was not promoted well, hence not giving him the adequate come back the listeners expected. He later ventured into the South Indian movie market by working with prominent music directors Vijay Antony, D.Imman and Paul Jacob. Krishan was featured on the 2012 hit single \"Makkayaala\" from the Naan movie and also was on movies such as Amba samuthra Ambani, Yuvan Yuvadhi, Sattapadi Kuttram, Om obama and Naan.

  "text" : "Kenelm Foss (13 December 1885 – 28 November 1963) was a British actor, theatre director, author, screenwriter and film director. He was born in Croydon, Surrey and studied art at the Wellesley School of Art and in Paris. He was, however, more interested in theatre and in 1903 made his first appearance on the London stage at the Royal Court Theatre. He then spent four years at the Glasgow Repertory Theatre producing plays and acting before returning to London to manage the Lyric Theatre in the Strand. He directed the play Magic by G.K.Chesterton, which had been written specially for him in 1913, and which title was the caption to the Vanity Fair caricature of him on 17 December 1913. He then produced the first performance of Chekhov’s The Cherry Orchard in England and in Europe, after which he obliged to leave the theatre for a while when he contracted tuberculosis. In 1915 he began a new career as a film director utilizing the production techniques and acting skills he had learned in the theatre. Many of his films were made for Astra Films. Following a relapse of his illness, he was able to return to the theatre and in the early 1920s spent some time in New York City where he produced a play on Broadway starring John Barrymore. He published several novels, works of poetry and biographical studies of Richard Brinsley Sheridan and J. M. W. Turner. With Mary Pickford, Charlie Chaplin and others he published Practical Course in Cinema Acting in Ten Complete Lessons in 1920. In 1925 he opened a sandwich bar in London which soon became a great success with the theatre fraternity and was followed by more \"Sandys\" to meet the demand. Foss died in 1963. He had married the actress Elisabeth Gilson and had six children, two of whom died in childhood. In 2005 his daughter Fanny Burney Woolnough published (under the name Fanny Burney) a biography of her father, Stage, Screen and Sandwiches: the Remarkable Life of Kenelm Foss."

The three were later released from detention and given back their jobs, which was seen as a key victory for the El-Mahalla El-Kubra textile workers. Socialist and blogger Hossam el-Hamalawy called el-Fayoumi a \"working class hero\". El-Fayoumi also participated in the Egyptian revolution in 2011 as one of the leaders of workers who went on strike. After Mubarak's departure as President, el-Fayoumi declared: \"All of us, as workers, said that the revolution began on February 11 when Mubarak left. When the head of the old regime stepped down, it was just the start of the revolution.\""

Shortly after Young was born his parents became missionaries for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Samoa, where they lived with Karl and his sister. Young received a bachelor's degree in French from the Utah State Agricultural College (now Utah State University), then attended Harvard University for a short time before going to the University of Oxford as a Rhodes Scholar. In 1930 Young joined the faculty of BYU as a teacher of French and English. He was a member of the BYU faculty for 41 years, being the head coordinator of the Freshman English Program for 25 years and head of BYU's English as a second language program for 5 years. Young also conducted various studies of Native American culture. Young also studied Mormon and Utah folklore. He was one of the contributing authors to Thomas E.

  "text" : "Konstantinos Pringos (1892 in Constantinople – 1964 in Athens) was a protopsaltes (leading cantor) in the Great Church of Constantinople from 1939 until 1959. In this position, he succeeded Iakovos Nafpliotis, while Pringos himself was in turn succeeded by Thrasyvoulos Stanitsas. Although the oldest existing recordings of the Patriarchal School of Byzantine chant are the 78 rpm Gramophone records of Iakovos Nafpliotis, Pringos was the first to be recorded performing live in the church, in a normal tempo, and with a \"standard\" completeness of interpretations (unlike the gramophone recordings of Nafpliotis that are known to be slower and simpler than his normal style of chanting). As a result of that, Pringos (together with Thrasyvoulos Stanitsas) is the main source of information and inspiration for those trying to chant in the Patriarchal Style. The other reason why the recordings of Pringos might be preferred to that of Stanitsas, is that Pringos was substantially more conservative, and so closer to the original chanting tradition of the Ecumenical Patriarchate. The melodies Pringos used for those parts of the service that were not notated traditionally (such as the responses to the supplications) are also widely used in current practice as exemplary models."

  "text" : "Karl Toman (January 2, 1884 – February 5, 1950) was an Austrian politician and trade unionist. Toman hailed from a working-class family. He went on to become a metal industry worker. Toman joined the Social Democratic Labour Party of Austria in 1898. In the run-up to the First World War, Toman served as secretary of the Goldsmiths' Trade Union. He was taken as a prisoner of war in Russia, and went on to fight on the Soviet side in the Russian Civil War. Toman becoming a leading figure in the Communist Party of Austria. He served as general secretary of the party for a brief period in 1920. He belonged to the party leadership until 1924. Toman represented the Communist Party of Austria at the second (1920) and third congresses (1921) of the Communist International. He took part in the fifth congress of the Communist International in 1924 as a non-voting delegate, representing of the inner-party minority in Austria. He was expelled from the party on August 31, 1924. In August 1925 he was readmitted to the Communist Party as a member. He worked with the Red International of Labour Unions (Profintern), having been appointed secretary of the Trade Union Sector of the Central Committee of the Communist Party in 1928. At the Profintern congress of 1930, held in Moscow, Toman was elected to the central council of the international body. He moved to Moscow, working as instructor at the Organizational Department of Profintern. Toman relocation to the Soviet Union was seen as a way of resolving the fractional frictions inside the Austrian Communist Party. In the Soviet Union, Toman was accused of mismanagement of funds. In September 1931 he was sacked from Profintern. He was given a new employment at a sailor's club in Leningrad, politically demoted. Having returned to Austria in 1932, Toman was finally stripped of his Communist Party membership. Toman joined the Revolutionary Socialists in 1934. He was detained at the Wöllersdorf prison camp, but was released in 1935. After Anschluss (German annexation of Austria in 1938) Toman was threatened with imprisonment at the Dachau concentration camp. He was however able to negotiate a release from captivity, citing his expulsion from the Communist Party. He undertook a loyalty oath to the Third Reich. In April 1938 German authorities appointed him as a member of the local administration of Eichgraben. In January 1940 he joined the National Socialist German Workers Party (NSDAP) and SA. Toman was captured by Soviet troops in May 1945. He died in a Soviet Gulag on February 5, 1950. There are very few documented cases of former Austrian communists having joined the NSDAP, Toman being the most prominent amongst them. There is little written about Toman's political journey, but speculation points towards blunt opportunism."

  "text" : "Khin Ohmar (Burmese: ခင်ဥမ္မာ, pronounced: [kʰɪ̀ɴ ʔòʊɴmà]) is a Burmese democracy activist noted for her leadership in the 8888 Uprising and her work with the Women's League of Burma and the Burma Partnership. Khin Ohmar was a senior student at Rangoon Arts and Science University studying chemistry when the events leading up to the 1988 anti-government protests began. She was twenty years old. On 5 September 1987, military ruler Ne Win announced the withdrawal of the newly replaced currency notes, 100, 75, 35 and 25 kyats, leaving only 45 and 90 kyat notes, apparently because only the latter two are numbers divisible by 9, considered lucky by Ne Win. Many Burmese people thus lost their savings overnight. Students, who often had savings for their tuition, were particularly affected. The next day, Khin Ohmar joined 20 other students in writing a letter to Ne Win protesting the move, which they forwarded through their university chancellor. The 21 signatories were arrested and held until Burma Union Day, 12 February 1988. According to her 1995 testimony to a US Senate sub-committee, she then joined a 16 March student rally protesting the death of student activist Phone Maw, which was violently suppressed by riot police; she escaped when a Japanese diplomat gave her and other protesters shelter in his home. On 18 March, the universities were closed. She continued to help coordinate protests and international media coverage until the climactic rally of 8 August 1988, from which the \"8888 Uprising\" takes its name. Following the further suppression of pro-democracy protests by the State Law and Order Restoration Council, Burma's military government, she traveled to the Thai-Burmese border to join the All Burma Students' Democratic Front (ABSDF), a revolutionary army. Political differences and alleged leadership failures in the ABSDF leadership eventually caused Khin Ohmar to leave the group, and she subsequently lived in the United States for at least five years. As of August 2007, she was active in the Burmese Women's Union, the Women's League of Burma and the Network for Democracy and Development. On October 25, 2009, she was \"kicked out\" of an Asean (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) summit on human rights, later charging that the organization was ineffective on Burmese human rights and \"afraid to hear from civil society\". In April 2011, she called on the first US Ambassador to Asean, David Lee Carden, to \"[stand] firmly on democracy and human rights for Burma\"."

Known variously in his cricket career as \"Kumar Narayan\" or \"Hitendra Narayan\", he was educated at Eton College and Cambridge University and was a forceful right-handed batsman. He made a lot of runs for the amateur Somerset Stragglers cricket team in 1908. But his four first-class matches for Somerset in 1909 and 1910 were not successful, with a top score of just 16 in his first game, against the 1909 Australians. In 1918, he played three matches for his brother's scratch side against teams composed largely of expatriate Englishmen, captaining his team in the last two of them. The matches have first-class status although all three were of only two-days' duration; Narayan was not successful in any of them as a batsman. He died at the age of 30 from influenza."

He left school in 1962 and briefly worked as a labourer before enlisting for a spell in the Merchant Navy. McClinton was regularly involved in violence during his time away at sea and left the Merchant Navy with 200 stitches in his body from the knife fights in which he had participated. Following his return to Belfast McClinton found himself involved in further street-fighting and heavy drinking until in 1972 he enlisted with the Ulster Defence Regiment (UDR). McClinton lasted only the six months basic training in the UDR, feeling that the regiment was too restricted in what it was allowed to do. In particular he complained that he had to fill in sixteen reports if he shot at rioters."

In 1948 he migrated to Pakistan, where he continued as a lecturer in English at several colleges and was appointed as the first vice-chancellor of the University of Balochistan in 1976. Among his many writings is a biographical treatise about the Urdu poet Mirza Ghalib commissioned by the Idara Yadgaar-e-Gahlib titled \"Ghalib: Sab Achcha Kahein Jissay\". Karrar was also a scholar of Islam, though he advocated that secularism provided the best environment for an Islamic society.

  "text" : "Kris Moyes (born 30 October 1978) is an Australian-born director and producer and founder of KMOYES PICTURES. He is perhaps best known for his innovative music videos. In 2005 he directed The Presets \"Are You The One?\" which utilized a large array of film techniques that playfully proposed answers to who the \"one\" is. The video also featured a digital artifact motif he developed by interrupting the transfer of DIVX files of original footage from a PC to a MAC computer, to which many homage videos were made. Moyes has had close ties to Modular Records since 2005. He is probably better known for his videos for Softlightes and The Presets. In 2008 Moyes directed a traditional performance based music video for Wolfmother \"White Unicorn\" on the condition that Pav, the head of Modular Records allowed him to deface his own work and re-release it, under the pseudonym Banditobruce. The piece of subterfuge was a reference to Marcel Duchamp's Readymade, L.H.O.O.Q. Moyes has also directed four music videos for Sia Furler. His first video for Sia's \"Buttons\" in 2007 was linked by Perez Hilton on his blog and received over 300,000 views in one day, becoming the No.1 Most Linked Music Video and No.2 Most Viewed Music Video on YouTube. In 2010 Moyes directed and co-wrote a satirical short film, called \"City Limits\" featuring costumes by Australian fashion label, Romance Was Born. It was screened at ASVOFF (A Shaded View on Fashion Film) at the Centre Pompidou, Paris. Moyes has also been exhibited alongside John Baldessari, Brian Bress, Miranda July, Peter Sutherland, Paper Rad, Melanie Bonajo, Michael Gondry, Spike Jonze, Chris Cunningham, Mark Romanek and Floria Sigmondi. Over the years, Moyes has appeared in a number of publications including, L.A. Times, Esquire, Tokion, The Open Day Book and The New York Times where he was invited alongside Jeff Koons, Banks Violette, Oscar de la Renta and The Campana Brothers to re-design the ' T ' Logo for The New York Times Style Magazine. In 2015, Moyes redesigned the identity for Australia's longest running TV program RAGE, the first redesign in over 30 years."

Others state that her identity is in question: \n* \"the name of the daughter of Rajaraja of the Suryavamsa, the elder sister of Rajendra-Chola, and the queen of the Eastern Chalukya king Vimaladitya.\" \n* \"The Tanjore inscriptions mention another, still earlier Kundavai, who was the daughter of the Chola king Parantaka II., the elder sister of the Chola king Rajaraja-deva, and the queen of the Pallava king Vallavaraiyan Vandiyadevan.\" Regardless of her precise identity, one of the figures at this time using this name is thought to have established two Jain temples, namely: \n*  Kuntahavai Jinalaya Temple at Tirumalai (Jain complex), near modern Polur, Tamil Nadu \n*  Dadapuram. However, only the Tirumalai site has survived."

After working on Wall Street, she made a decision to leave power, wealth and corporate stress behind her. Martha Stewart dubbed her the Stress Queen—who specializes in stress management, mindful living, and work life balance. John J. Ratey called her the midwife to a movement—Mindful Living. She established Oak Haven, a 300-acres farm in Clarkesville, Ga. in 1988, and built a health, education, and training center called The Hermitage. It also serves as a horse farm and a retreat for wildlife and abandoned/shelter dogs and cats. In A Life in Balance: Nourishing the Four Roots of True Happiness, she wrote about her journey from working on Wall Street to creating an institute for mind-body, complementary medicine. This book won the 2007 Nautilus Book Award."
