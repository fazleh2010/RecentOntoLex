Balslev was born in Aabenraa and originally trained as a nurse. She then studied singing, first at the Academy of Music and Music Communication in Esbjerg, then at the opera academy of the Royal Danish Theater in Copenhagen. In 1976, she made her debut at the Royal Danish Theater as Yaroslavna in Prince Igor. After two years, Balslev left the Royal Danish Theater and had her international breakthrough as Senta in Harry Kupfer's staging of Wagner's Der fliegende Holländer at the 1978 Bayreuth Festival. From 1979 to 1983 she sang at the Hamburg State Opera, after which she has worked freelance at La Scala, the Vienna State Opera and Bayreuth among others. In addition to her professional work, Balslev was in 1992 among the founders of an organization which supports orphanages in Romania and provides summer and Christmas vacations for the children. Balslev has received several awards and honors, including Tagea Brandt Rejselegat (1996) and the Reumert Prize, of which she was the first recipient (1999).

What started off as Linkogle and friends wearing Metal Mulisha gear while performing tricks and jumps at the first-ever FMX course—the Metal Mulisha Compound built at Linkogle’s childhood home—has grown into one of the most recognized and respected brands in action sports. On December 6, 2001, while serving as the stunt double for Vin Diesel in the movie Triple X, Linkogle was accidentally struck by a helicopter blade during a stunt for the movie. At the time of the accident, the injuries suffered were believed to have been minor and Linkogle walked away from the accident. Shortly after the accident, it was discovered that his frontal lobe was torn away from his skull from the impact with the Huey helicopter's blade and his ACL snapped and shoulder separated from the resulting fall."

  "text" : "Louis Johannes Tregardt (10 August 1783 – 25 October 1838) (from Swedish: trädgård, garden) was a farmer from the Cape Colony's eastern frontier, who became an early voortrekker leader, called the \"voorste mense\". Shunning colonial authority, he emigrated in 1834 to live among the Xhosa, before he crossed the Orange River into neutral territory. His northward trek, along with fellow trekker Johannes (Hans) van Rensburg, was commenced in early 1836. He led his small party of emigrants, composed of seven Boer farmers, with their wives and thirty-four children, Bushman slaves and Bantu servants, into the uncharted interior of South Africa, and settled for a year at the base of the Zoutpansberg. At this most northerly point of their trek, unhealthy conditions began to take a toll on man and animal. Seemingly abandoned by a follow-up trek, and distant from supplies and buyers for their ivory, Tregardt abandoned the settlement, and led the party southeastwards to the Portuguese outpost at Delagoa bay. The oceanward route proved arduous and included the challenge of traversing a section of the northern Drakensberg. Though reaching the fort at Delagoa bay, a number of their party contracted malaria en route. Tregardt's wife perished at the fort in May 1838, followed by Tregardt six months afterward."

  "text" : "Lynda Agnes Victoria Heaven MBE (12 April 1902 – 3 April 1987) was an Australian politician. She was the first female Labor Party member of the Tasmanian House of Assembly, and represented the electorate of Franklin between 1962 and 1964. She was born Lynda Hocking in Daylesford, Victoria, and on 2 December 1959, she became the first woman to serve on a jury in Tasmania, after amendments to the Jury Act 1899 enacted two years earlier permitted female jurors. Heaven entered the House of Assembly on 9 March 1962 on a recount following the death of John Dwyer. In fact, the recount following Dwyer's death had elected Brian Crawford to the vacancy, but Heaven successfully challenged Crawford's election on the grounds that he was not resident in Tasmania. She was one of three female candidates for Franklin at the 1964 state election, but was defeated. Heaven was made a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 1968 Queen's Birthday Honours, for services to the community."

  "text" : "Linden J. Lundstrom (1913–1996) of Rockford, Illinois, was an American choral conductor, arranger, author, publisher, and founder of Kantorei – The Singing Boys of Rockford, IL. Lundstrom grew up in Rockford, leaving in the 1930s to attend St Olaf College, Northfield MN, where he was greatly influenced by F. Melius Christiansen, founder of the St Olaf Choir. Upon graduation with a music degree, he returned to Rockford and to his first job, as choral director at the newly built Rockford East High School (1939). He remained there for some 35 years, but this was only one segment of his choral music influence, particularly among students. He was music director at First Lutheran Church, and later Our Savior's Lutheran Church (beginning 1958). With former student, Ronald Nelson, he self-published choral arrangements and curricula under the name Choir School Guild. In addition, AugsburgFortress published Lundstrom's The Choir School: A Leadership Manual in 1957. Lundstrom did further academic work in music at the University of Wisconsin, Madison. Lundstrom's first major contribution to the American choral scene was his adaptation of the European Choir School to the average American congregation. He studied at Union Theological Seminary (1949) and corresponded with choir master Ernst Suter in Germany, then conceived the idea of a Saturday morning program incorporating studies in worship, sight-singing and creative arts, as well as actual choir rehearsals. By beginning such training at a very young age, he hoped to achieve in some measure what the resident schools in Europe were accomplishing. His Choir Schools at First Lutheran Church and Our Savior's Lutheran in Rockford became models for such choir schools in many other parishes throughout the country, beginning with Tabor Lutheran in Rockford, Westwood Lutheran Church in St Louis Park, Minnesota, and House of Hope Church, St Paul, Minnesota. Lundstrom's work also included the founding of an authentic boys' choir,Kantorei - The Singing Boys of Rockford in 1964. Based on his experience in Germany, he insisted that all four voices, soprano, alto, tenor, and bass be included, as opposed to the then-common American tradition of using treble voices only. A choir school supported the musical education and vocal development of young boys, who then matriculated into the main group. As voices changed, members moved from upper voices to lower voices within the group. The Kantorei tackled the most challenging music, including 8-part Bach motets, as well as a wealth of American traditional song. The choir continues today as the same non-profit, non-sectarian community group, travelling the world with the unique vocal sound only such a group may make. Lundstrom retired to rural Wisconsin in the mid-1970s, working from his extensive home library (housed in a large barn) on choral music as well as other activities. In 1976, he organized a trek by rail, float-plane, and native canoe to a possible site on Hudson Bay where the explorer Henry Hudson may have spent a winter before the mutiny of his crew in 1611, marking the end of what we know about Hudson. A member of the Society for the History of Discoveries, Lundstrom wrote an essay, \"The Bay Where Hudson did winter\", which became part of a series of James Ford Bell Lectures published by the University of MN Library. Lundstrom's influence continues, mainly through the many students he taught and conducted, including choral composer Ronnie Nelson, pipe organ builder and church musician, Tom Erickson, and many others."

  "text" : "Born in Toledo, Ohio, in 1909, Lorin Edgar Kerr was educated at the University of Toledo where he received his B.A. in 1931 and at the University of Michigan, receiving his M.D. in 1935 and a M.S.P.H. in1939. From 1937 to 1944 he served in municipal and county public health departments in Ohio and Michigan. Kerr joined the United States Public Health Service in 1944, first in the War Food Administration and later in the Industrial Hygiene Division. While with the Industrial Hygiene Division he provided consultant services for labor unions which were then beginning to develop their own medical care programs. In October 1948 Kerr joined the newly formed Welfare and Retirement Fund of the United Mine Workers of America, simultaneously accepting an appointment as an area medical administrator in Morgantown, West Virginia. From 1951 to 1969 he served as assistant to the medical director of the Welfare and Retirement Fund. While with the fund Kerr developed the U.M.W.A. Department of Occupational Health, the first occupational medical program to be established by a major labor union. In 1969 he was appointed as the first director of the department, a position he held for years. Kerr has been a leader in the field of occupational health for more than four decades and has had an important impact on legislation and on the medical and public health professions. Coal workers' pneumonoconiosis (black lung disease) was one of Kerr's major concerns from the beginning of his employment by the UMWA and it became his primary responsibility after his appointment as director of the Department of Occupational Health. Along with Terence E. Carroll of the National Institute of Rehabilitation and Health Services, Kerr and his colleagues in the UMWA played a major role in gaining recognition of black lung as a disease entity and cause of disability. Their efforts led to passage of the Federal Coal Mine Health and Safety Act of 1969, which created a black lung compensation program for coal miners, and its amendment in 1972, that extended benefits to all miners with fifteen or more years of service who suffered respiratory impairment, whether pneumonoconiosis was pathologically verifiable or not. The recognition of, and compensation for, black lung disease helped to create a much broader definition of the relationship between occupation and disease. In addition to his service with the United Mine Workers, Kerr has participated actively in the American Public Health Association (president, 1974), the Group Health Association of America (president, 1966–1968), and the National Association for Public Health Policy. The American Public Health Association's Section on Occupational Health and Safety awards the annual Lorin Kerr Award for leadership in public policy advocacy. He was a visiting professor at Howard University College of Medicine from 1952 to 1976 and served on the Advisory Council to the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare on Coal Mine Health Research in 1970. He has appeared frequently before Congressional committees as an advocate and expert witness on occupational and environmental health issues. FamilyParents are..Lorin E. Kerr and Florence B.

Gonzenbach was born in a Swiss-German community of Sicily, to a German-speaking mercantile family. (Her sister, Magdelena, began a school in Messina.) She became well educated and gained renown for the stories she gathered from a diverse range of sources, often other women. After the prompting of Otto Hartwig for material to append to a historical survey of the country, she produced what would become an important two volume collection, Sicilianische Märchen (Sicilian folk-tales), published in 1870. Her seminal works collected tales given verbally, by peasants or other working and middle classes; the assemblage is noted as one of the few major collections of the nineteenth century to be compiled by a woman."

  "text" : "Lyndon H. Jackson (born ?) is a Micronesian politician. A former Speaker of the Eighth and Ninth Kosrae State Legislatures, Jackson has served as the Governor of Kosrae since January 11, 2011, with Lt. Governor Carson K. Sigrah. He succeeded outgoing Governor Robert J. Weilbacher. Jackson won the initial Kosrae gubernatorial election held on November 2, 2011, with 1,414 votes, but failed to pass the 50% threshold, which necessitated a runoff in January 2011. Nena S. Nena earned 1,129, qualifying him for the runoff against Jackson. Outgoing Kosrae Lt. Governor William O. Tosie placed third with 869 votes while former Kosrae Governor Rensley A. Sigrah came in fourth place with 824 votes. Jackson won the Kosrae gubernatorial runoff election held on January 2, 2011, with 54.4% of the vote to Nena S. Nena's 45.6%. Jackson and Sigrah were officially sworn into office on January 11, 2011, However, Jackson's public inauguration ceremony was held on January 27, 2011. Jackson's inauguration, which was attended by more than 1,000 people, was held at Kosrae High School over the course of two and a half hours. In his inaugural address, Governor Jackson called private sector economic growth, as well as government transparency and accountability, telling the audience that, \"I will work hard to restore trust in the Government and its people.\" Jackson also thanked his predecessor, former Governor Robert Weilbacher, for his work in reforming Kosrae's government and economy."

  "text" : "Leendert Pieter de Neufville (Amsterdam, March 8, 1729 – Rotterdam, July 28, 1811) was a Dutch merchant and banker trading in silver, grain, silk, and providing the Prussian army since 1757. His business grew very fast during the Seven Years' War, but it appears that De Neufville was paid by the Prussian (temporarily) devalued currency. In the meantime De Neufville used bills of exchange. These \"cavalry bonds\" were not backed by any real transaction. After the peace of Hubertusburg in February 1763 De Neufville went to Berlin to offer his help in reviving the Prussian Asiatic Company. There he met with Johann Ernst Gotzkowsky, the owner of a silk and porcelain factory. Together they bought a huge amount of grain, stored in warehouses, after the Russian army had withdrawn from Pommerania, etc. De Neufville invested 100.000 guilder in Gotzkowsky's project. The grain prices however continued to drop within the next three months. On 18 July General Vasily Dolgorukov-Krymsky forced Gotzkowsky to pay for the (rotten) grain. Following the end of the war, the sub-value Prussian coins were removed from circulation resulting in a shortage of cash money. From June 1763, new coins were minted in line with the pre-war monetary standard, but in shortage. The “war coins” were only exchanged at their metal value. Their loss in value had to be borne by the owners. The brothers De Neufville, who had been paid by \"war coins\", but obliged to pay out their bills of exchange in new coins, closed their business on 29 July and De Neufville he went bankrupt on 3 August 1763, as Gotzkowsky did on the next day. This also brought other banks, especially in Hamburg and Berlin into trouble. An international banking crisis ensued, which extended to Hamburg, Berlin and Stockholm, during which the banks were unwilling to give each other credit. Gotzkowsky was saved by Frederick the Great, who bought his porcelain and silk factory in August/September 1763. (From then on it became known as KPM.) The Prussian king also tried to help De Neufville, but the Amsterdam mayors and bankers were not interested in saving the Neufville company. On 7 October 1763 De Neufville was placed under guardianship. The Amsterdam Chamber of Insolvent Estates became responsible for his property. Twice an auction was organized to sell his paintings (in December 1763 and June 1765). De Neufville promised to pay back his debtors 70, 60 and then 50%. As he did not succeed to pay his debtors more than 10% his debtors went to court in 1770. Until 1777 De Neufville lived in Amsterdam or on his estate near Heemstede. The next year De Neufville moved to Rotterdam, where he remarried in 1805. Another auction of paintings was held in 1804; De Neufville had a special interest for the German painter Christian Wilhelm Ernst Dietrich. In the year of his death the debtors received another 1%."

She started her career at the age of eight, joining the Russian children's act Avenue, then not long after Neposedi. In 1999 Ivan Shapovalov had chosen Lena Katina for his project, t.A.T.u., as well with Julia Volkova. The duo would later become Russia's most successful pop music act. The group produced several hits including \"All the Things She Said\", \"Not Gonna Get Us\" and \"All About Us\".Their first single \"All The Things She Said\" peaked at number one in 19 countries including the UK, Russia and Australia. In 2009 Katina began a solo career, which caused t.A.T.u. to go into a hiatus. In 2011 Katina and Volkova officially split to pursue solo careers. That year Katina released her first mainstream single \"Never Forget\", which in 2011 reached No. 1 on the MTV Russia Top 10 and also won the MTV Russia - 2011 Video Of The Year. The track also reached No. 1 on the US Billboard Hot Dance Club Play and reached No. 1 in Greece. In 2014, she released her debut album, This Is Who I Am."

He began his career in Szeged where he played with Szegedi T.C. mostly in the youth team and occasionally as reserve in the first squad. until 1917 when he joins Ferencvárosi TC where he plays until the end of the First World War. In 1918 because of the hard conditions in his hometown, he leaves Szeged and moved to Novi Sad in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia and joins NAK Novi Sad. It is during this period that he travells as a guest with BSK to a tournament in Dalmatia, however he returned to NAK, and shortly after, in 1921, he moved back to Szeged. He rejoined his former club and became the main goalkeeper. His noticed performances made him a call for an exhibition match played in 1921 between the selections of Budapest against the Hungarian Province. This match fielded what were considered the best players in Hungary by that time, divided in two teams, the ones based in the capital Budapest against the ones playing in the rest of the country, with Tusko playing for the second one, as he was based in Szeged. That year he returned to the Novi Sad and joined FK Vojvodina where he stayed during the rest of the 1921 season. and the 1922. That year, despite the interess of numerous clubs, he opted to move to Belgrade and signed with BSK, a team he already knew from the tournament he was a guest in few years earlier, and where he will become one of the main players of the Yugoslav Championship which started in 1923. After two seasons, he became an idol in Belgrade and during 1923 was often named as the best goalkeeper in the country. However, in 1924 he suffered a heavy kidney injury in a clash with an opponent forward in a friendly match between the city selection of Belgrade, for whom he played, and the selection of Lower Austria region. After spending a couple of days in hospital and two surgeries he died. The main local sports newspaper Sport had extensive coverage of the event and concluded the report with the following sentence: \"He died like a hero and was buried as a small sports King.\" As a result, the Belgrade Football Subassociation created a fund named after him in order to financially support the injured footballers. He was known in Yugoslav media in his Serbian language name version as Lajoš Šenfeld Tusko, or in Cyrillic as Лajoш Шeнфeлд Tуcкo."

On June 10 Chen appeared to retract the accusation, commenting only that, \"I said that in fear, and I don't want to talk about it again.\" On June 22, however, Chen provided further details, naming Zhang Jin, Deputy Director of the Third Department of the Chinese Ministry of Public Security, as the official responsible for the abduction. He also alleged that a drug called \"du zing\" was used to render Lan Meng unconscious and that he was transferred via fishing boat to a Chinese cargo ship. An investigation by the Weekend Australian found that Lan Meng, then 18, was living in the Melbourne suburb of Sandringham from November 1999 until November 2000. They determined that he was in Australia for at least three months before Lan Fu returned to China. Lan Meng was located in Melbourne by the Australian Federal Police on July 7 and, when interviewed, requested that his statements be kept secret. On the basis of his testimony, the AFP \"concluded there's no substance to the allegation.\" Other Australian media have also reported on the alleged kidnap claim Lan Fu's wife, Lai Chongxin, also reported to be on China's wanted list in connection with the Xiamen scandal, is believed to still reside in Australia."

In December 2005, she was elected chair of the Greater Vancouver Regional District board, of which she had been a member for the previous nine years.

He then engaged in literary work as a contributor to various periodicals. He became successively dramatic critic for L'Écho de Paris, La Revue Blanche, and the Revue d'Art Dramatique. From 1890 to 1895 he was assistant librarian at the University of Paris; but he gave up that position to devote himself entirely to literature. He died prematurely of typhoid fever after eating contaminated oysters. He was the author of Le Mauvais Désir (1890), La Carrière d'André Tourette (1900), and L'Associée (1902)—all three novels dealing with Parisian life. His two critical works, La Fin d'un art (1890) and Le monde où l'on imprime (1897), never became popular. He wrote also (with Pierre Veber) a one-act play entitled Dix ans après (produced at the Odéon in 1897)."

  "text" : "Leon Benzaquen (Tangier, 31 December 1928 – May 1977) was a Jewish-Moroccan doctor who became the personal doctor for King Mohammed V of Morocco, and the first Jewish-Moroccan minister after Morocco received its independence in 1956, in its first independent kingdom and government. He was first appointed as telegraph and Communications minister and later minister of Health, a post occupied by Benzaquen until 1958. When Morocco received its independence in 1956, the Jewish community held quite a few respectable political positions, including three parliamentarian seats and one cabinet post as mail and telegraph minister. Upon receiving its independence in 1956, the Sultan insisted upon the appointment of Leon Benzaquen, while the Jewish community was unable to reach a consensus on whom to send as a representative to the cabinet. coincident with his appointment Benzaquen expressed his favor opinion on the Jewish right to immigrate, pending it will not include pressure or propaganda. The problem at the time was the objection of various forces in Morocco to a mass Jewish immigration that will play into the hands of the Jewish Agency for Israel, however the right to immigrate was in fact recognized on an individual basis. He also claimed that Morocco and Tunisia may play a role in mediating between the Arab states and Israel, and that despite not being able to express their opinion in public, the Moroccan leaders do not sense any sympathy towards Gamal Abdel Nasser or other Arab dictators in the middle east. The prevailing view is that Benzaquen remained neutral during the Morocco's struggle for independence, due to an internal Jewish struggle among Jewish-Moroccan modernists, graduates of AIU, Zionists, and traditionalists (In 1944, he refused to sign the first Independence Manifesto of the \"Istiqlal\" group, who opposed the occupation but also the kingdom). Despite this gesture of good will towards the Jewish-Moroccan community, in appointing Leon Benzaquen to a ministerial post, Benzaquen did not survive in occupying the post when there was a government reshuffle for the first time in Morocco since it received its independence, and Jews in Morocco were no longer appointed to the cabinet (until the '80s)."

  "text" : "Li Yantu (李彥圖) (died 913) was a ruler of Qian Prefecture (虔州, in modern Ganzhou, Jiangxi) from 912 to 913, early in the Chinese Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period. Nearly nothing is known about Li Yantu's personal background, including where or when he was born. In 912, when Li Qiu, who had seized control of Qian Prefecture after assassinating the prior ruler Lu Yanchang and subsequently was given the title of defender of Qian by Zhu Wen, died, Li Yantu took over by himself and apparently took the title of defender of Qian as well. (It is not clear from the extant historical records whether he received official sanction from Later Liang and/or its rival Wu, to whom Lu had previously submitted.) After Li Yantu's seizure of power, the senior officer Tan Quanbo, a long-time strategist for Lu Yanchang's father Lu Guangchou, whom Li Qiu had considered killing, claimed to be seriously ill and retired from military service. Upon hearing of Tan's illness, Liu Yan the military governor of Qinghai Circuit (清海, headquartered in modern Guangzhou, Guangdong), nominally a Later Liang vassal, attacked Shao Prefecture (韶州, in modern Shaoguan, Guangdong), which had been part of the domain of the Qian Prefecture rulers since Lu Guangchou's time. Liao Shuang (廖爽) the prefect of Shao, whom Lu Yanchang had commissioned, abandoned Shao and fled to Chu, ending Qian rulers' control of Shao. In 913, Li Yantu died. The people of the prefecture supported Tan to succeed him."

Between 1946 and 1966 he was assistant director of research in zoology at the university. From 1944 he also started to research in traditional Chinese music, and his many publications show his broad ethnomusicological interests (also in instrument studies and of music in Turkey). Between 1966 and 1976 he was assistant director at the Faculty of Oriental Studies at Cambridge University. He was elected to a high number of academic positions, amongst them are: Fellow of the British Academy (1973) and Docteur Honoris Causa of the Université de Paris X, Nanterre (1988).Two Festschriften, commemorating his 60th and 70th birthday, indicate his esteem amongst scholars. Some of his papers and his library can be found at the Cambridge University Library. According to an obituary in The Times Picken was 'accomplished to such a degree that few even in the university could appreciate the range of his achievements in fields that were united in him as in no one else.'"

  "text" : "Legesse Wolde-Yohannes is an Ethiopian horticultural scientist. He cooperated with Aklilu Lemma on the discovery and research on how to use the plant endod as a means of preventing the parasitic disease bilharzia. He was awarded the Right Livelihood Award in 1989, jointly with Lemma.Bilharzia, or schistosomiasis, is a debilitating and eventually fatal illness, which afflicts more than 200 million people in 74 countries of Africa, Asia and Latin America. Present therapies for bilharzia, and molluscicides to kill the snail-carriers of the disease, are far too expensive for the communities that need them. In 1964 a young Ethiopian doctor, Aklilu Lemma, discovered that suds from the fruit of a common African plant, the endod or soapberry, which African women have used as soap for centuries, act as a potent molluscicide. To follow up this discovery, Lemma in 1966 established the Institute of Pathobiology in Addis Ababa University, and for the next 10 years he directed a team to carry out systematic research on endod. He was joined in this work in 1974 by Legesse Wolde-Yohannes. The discovery seemed to offer no less than a cheap, locally-controllable means of eradicating a disease that is the second greatest scourge (after malaria) in the Third World. And Lemma's early research confirmed this potential. Yet progress in making this endod product available to the people who need it has been extremely slow, for reasons that expose some of the biases and failings of the international medical community. In the last few years, however, Lemma's and Wolde-Yohannes' persistence and the support of key scientists and donors in the West has opened the door to the necessary laboratory and field trials. An endod research and application network has also been established, linking five African countries, and the plant is being grown and used for experimental control of schistosomiasis. Before his death in 1997, Lemma and colleagues established the Endod Foundation to serve as an umbrella for all endod-related work. Following collaboration with Lemma, the University of Toledo, USA, was granted a US patent on an endod-based molluscicide intended to control the zebra mussels which have recently invaded American lakes and caused extensive damage to water supplies. This has opened a major new hope for marketing and exporting endod as a cash crop. Legesse Wolde-Yohannes has a doctorate in Horticultural Science from the Technical University of Hannover, Germany. He has coordinated endod research in Addis Ababa since 1980, developing methods for its extraction and application and carrying out relevant agrobotanical studies. He is currently an Associate Professor of Biology at Addis Ababa University and also serves as Director of the National Endod Foundation. Dr. Legesse Wolde-Yohannes has published several articles on endod cultivation and extraction, soil science plant nutrition and is co-author of a handbook on endod utilisation. He has organised national and international seminars and workshops on endod/bilharzia and carried out several WHO consultancy missions to Africa, USA, Canada and Europe in relation to the use of endod for schistosomiasis and zebra mussels control programmes. For his scientific achievement, Dr. Legesse Wolde-Yohannes received the Golden Medal from the University of Oslo, Norway in 1989 and the Golden Medal and Certificate of Merit from Addis Ababa University in 2000. Since 1999 Dr. Legesse Wolde-Yohannes is senior advisor on endod and medicinal plants to the Ethio Agri-CEFT Private Limited Company. He is involved in promoting agrobotanical studies on endod and other medicinal plants towards large-scale production and processing for local and international marketing."

  "text" : "Leonid Vladimirovich Sherwood (Russian: Леонид Владимирович Шервуд (28 April 1871 - 28 August 1954) was a Russian sculptor. Sherwood was born in Moscow. He was of English descent, his grandfather Joseph Sherwood having been an English engineer who emigrated to Russia. His father was the architect Vladimir Osipovich Sherwood and his brother was the architect Vladimir Vladimirovich Sherwood. His surname is often transliterated as Shervud. Leonid Shervud was responsible for the magnificent memorial to Admiral Stepan Makarov, killed at the battle of Tsushima during the Russo-Japanese war, erected in 1913 on Yakornaya Ploshchad (\"Anchor Square\") in front of the Naval Cathedral of St. Nicolas in Kronshtadt, the headquarters of the Russian Imperial Navy. Sherwood chose to use as the pedestal a 160-ton granite rock originally cut for a monument to Peter the Great in front of Kazan Cathedral, which sunk in transit to St. Petersburg. The bottom of the rock is engraved with the words: \"Remember war\". This was the personal motto of Stepan Makarov. Sherwood was one of the first sculptors to be involved in monumental Soviet sculpture after the revolution and was responsible for many official busts and other monumental statues. He was also the architect of the Swallow's Nest, a decorative castle in the Crimea. Sherwood was educated at the Moscow School of Painting, Sculpture and Architecture (1886–91) and the Imperial Academy of Arts, St Petersburg (1892-1898). He was a pupil of Vladimir Aleksandrovich Beklemishev. He was an exchange student in Paris in 1899-1900, where he became a pupil of Rodin. Returning to Russia, he lived in Petrograd and was employed by Vladimir Lenin for monumental sculpture. He taught sculpture at the Academy of Arts in Petrograd. Sherwood was awarded the Order of the Red Banner of Labour and was made a Distinguished Artist of the RSFSR. He died in Leningrad, aged 83."

  "text" : "Lynne Walker (24 October 1956 – 10 February 2011) was a British music and theatre critic who also had experience as a broadcaster. Born in Edinburgh, she attended the Mary Erskine School. She won a medal at the end of her time at Napier College in 1976, and gained a degree from the Huddersfield School of Music (now part of Huddersfield University). It was at this time that Walker became drawn to the Huddersfield Contemporary Music Festival, and gained a scholarship to study choral conducting in France under Arthur Oldham. Her early career was as a musician, but she migrated to marketing and publicity in the early 1980s working for the Scottish National Orchestra and later for the Royal Exchange theatre in Manchester (1987–94). In 1991 she began her own editorial consultancy Edgewise with the music critic Gerald Larner, whom she had married in 1989. Simultaneously she had begun a freelance career in journalism and broadcasting. For about a decade, until the programme was dropped in 1998, she was a contributor to (and for its last two years presenter) of the BBC Radio 4 arts magazine Kaleidoscope. She also hosted the Radio 3 programme In Tune. By 2000 she was a more regular contributor to The Independent, responsible for the newspaper's coverage of theatre events at the Edinburgh Festival, feature articles and arts criticism with an emphasis on the north of England. Lynne Walker died in Alderley Edge, Cheshire having suffered from cancer."

  "text" : "Lida Gustava Heymann (15 March 1868 – 31 July 1943) was a German feminist, pacifist and women's rights activist. Together with her partner Anita Augspurg she was one of the most prominent figures in the bourgeois women's movement. She was, among other things, in the forefront of the Verband Fortschrittlicher Frauenvereine ((German) \"Association of Women's Groups\"). She co-founded the abolitionist movement in Germany. (Translator's note: \"Abolitionist\" in this context refers to abolition of prostitution. The German state allowed, and regulated, prostitution at the time.) In this role she came into conflict with the law as she protested about the treatment of prostitutes and called for the abolition of state regulation for them. Heymann wanted to \"help women free themselves from male domination.\" With her vast inheritance she established a women's centre, offering meals, a crèche and counselling. She also founded a co-educational high school and professional associations for female clerks and theatre workers. In 1902 she jointly founded (with Anita Augspurg) the first German Verein für Frauenstimmrecht ((German) \"Society for Women's Suffrage\"). Together with Augspurg, she published the newspaper Frau im Staat ((German) \"Women in the State\") from 1919 to 1933. This newspaper presented the pacifist, feminist and democratic positions on various subjects. In 1923 Heymann and Augspurg called for the Austrian Adolf Hitler to be expelled from Germany. When Hitler seized power in 1933, both were out of the country; they did not return. Their property was confiscated and they settled in Switzerland. Heymann died in 1943 and was buried in Fluntern cemetery."

He was initially a Lulong officer, but later fled to Li Keyong's Hedong Circuit (河東, headquartered in modern Taiyuan, Shanxi). After Li conquered Lulong and left him in charge, he turned against Li and became an independent warlord, although at times he and Li would still act in concert. His domain later became the basis of the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period state Yan that Liu Shouguang established. In 913, however, Li Keyong's son and successor Li Cunxu the Prince of Jin conquered Yan and captured both Liu Shouguang and Liu Rengong; he put them to death the next year."

After 1828, he worked as an actor-director at the newly established Berlin Königstädter Theater. He retired from the stage In 1830 and bought an inn in Spandauer Strasse in Berlin, while continuing to write plays. His most successful play was the original Berlin Posse Das Fest der Handwerker, in which he himself created the celebrated role of Foreman Kluck. He died in Berlin and was buried in the cemetery of the French Reformed Church (Französischer Friedhof)."

  "text" : "Lindsay Sparkes (born August 6, 1950 in North Vancouver, British Columbia as Lindsay Davie) is a Canadian curler. She is a three-time Canadian champion, world champion and Olympic demonstration champion. In 1976, Sparkes and her team of Dawn Knowles, Robin Klassen, Lorraine Bowles won her first provincial and her first national championship. In 1979, the team returned to the national championship, and won again. This qualified them for the inaugural 1979 Royal Bank of Scotland World Women's Curling Championship. The team lost in the semi-final to Switzerland. In 1984, Sparkes and her new team of Linda Moore, Debbie Orr and Laurie Carney won her third provincial title, and finished in 3rd place at that year's national championship (at that point, called the Tournament of Hearts.) The following season, Sparkes and Moore switched positions, and the team won another provincial and went on to claim the 1985 Scott Tournament of Hearts title, beating Newfoundland in the final. At the 1985 World Championships, the team won the gold medal, defeating Scotland in the final. The 1986 Scott Tournament of Hearts would mark the first event where the defending champion could return as Team Canada, and the team lost in the final to Ontario. The team was chosen by the Canadian Olympic Committee to represent Canada at the 1988 Winter Olympics where curling was a demonstration sport. The team won the gold medal, defeating Sweden in the final. Sparkes' final appearance at the Hearts was in 1997 as an alternate for the Kelley Owen (Law) rink."

He was born on 3 June 1809 at Standish, near Wigan, Lancashire. He was educated first at a school in his native village, and afterwards at Ampleforth College, in Yorkshire. In December 1829, he left Ampleforth and moved to Prior Park College, near Bath, Somerset. Thereafter, he went to complete his theological studies at Rome; where, on 11 November 1832, he was ordained to the priesthood. He returned to England in 1833, and he was sent upon a mission in the Catholic Church's Western District, where he was placed successively at Trelawny; Tawstock, Devon; Weobley, Herefordshire; Poole, Dorset; and Cannington, Somerset. In April 1839, he was appointed chaplain of the Convent of the Immaculate Conception, in Sion House, at Spetisbury, near Blandford Forum, Dorsetshire. On 9 November 1849, he was recalled to Prior Park by Bishop Hendren, then Vicar Apostolic of the Western District. For nearly a year, he held at Prior Park the double position of vice-president and professor of theology at St. Paul's College. On 9 October 1850, he was again sent upon the mission, being appointed to the charge of the Catholic congregation of St. Peter's in the city of Gloucester. He was shortly afterwards installed as a canon of Clifton. As Missionary Rector (the then title for a parish priest) at Gloucester, he oversaw the construction of a new church and presbytery, the former of which was opened in March 1860. He died suddenly of heart disease on 24 June 1864."

  "text" : "Leckford Mwanza Thotho is a politician who served as Minister of Information and then Minister of Defense in Malawi between 2009 and 2011. Thotho ran on the Democratic Progressive Party ticket in the May 2009 elections, and was elected MP for Dowa North East.Thotho was appointed Minister of Information and Civil Education, with Kingsley Namakwa as his deputy, in the cabinet that became effective on 15 June 2009. In March 2010, the Scottish government announced that they would suspend aid to organizations in Malawi that discriminated against gays. Thotho responded by saying \"We may be poor but money will not force us to legalise these acts of immorality because we are not such a society and we have more pressing human rights abuses that we need to pay attention to than gay rights\".This followed the conviction of a same-sex couple for gross indecency after they held a symbolic same-sex marriage. Thotho defended the decision on the basis of customary Malawian morality. He compared the ban on same-sex marriage in Malawi to that on polygamous marriage in the United States. In March 2010, Thotho defended a decision to purchase a presidential jet for US$13.26 million, saying purchase was cheaper than rental. The opposition called the decision irresponsible given the poverty of the people of Malawi.In July 2010, Thotho commissioned a K77 million multi-purpose community Tele-Center in Mzanza. The center would give rural people access to the internet.Thotho caused controversy during his term as Minister of Information with his campaign to change the national flag of Malawi. Thotho was appointed Minister of Defense in a cabinet reshuffle announced on 9 August 2010.On 10 January 2011, Thotho was dropped from his position as Minister of Defense. Although no official reason was given, newspapers speculated that the cause was his decision to purchase arms from the United Kingdom, as recommended by the Army, rather than from China, as preferred by President Bingu wa Mutharika. Another reason could have been that he apologized to the government of Mozambique for the action of Colonel James Kalipinde in sailing on prohibited waters of Mozambique.After the firing, the President assumed direct responsibility for the Ministry of Defense."

  "text" : "Leopoldo Girelli (born 13 March 1953) is the current Apostolic Nuncio to Singapore. Girelli had previously served as Apostolic Nuncio to Indonesia and Apostolic Nuncio to Timor-Leste. Girelli was born in Predore, Province of Bergamo in 1953. He was ordained a priest on 17 June 1978 and incardinated in the diocese of Bergamo. He graduated in Theology. He entered the Holy See's Diplomatic Corps after studying at the Pontifical Ecclesiastical Academy. He entered the diplomatic service of the Holy See on 13 July 1987 and worked in the papal diplomatic missions in Cameroon and New Zealand and at the Section for General Affairs of the Secretariat of State, and finally in the Apostolic Nunciature to the United States where he held the rank of Counsellor. On 13 April 2006 Pope Benedict XVI appointed him Apostolic Nuncio to Indonesia and Titular Archbishop of Capreae. He was consecrated bishop on 17 June, with Cardinal Angelo Sodano as principal consecrator. On 10 October 2006 he was appointed Apostolic Nuncio to Timor-Leste in addition to his duties as Apostolic Nuncio to Indonesia. On 13 January 2011 he was appointed Apostolic Nuncio to Singapore, Apostolic Delegate for Malaysia and for Brunei Darussalam, and non-residential papal representative for Vietnam. He was the first papal representative of any kind to be appointed for Vietnam since the expulsion in 1975 of the resident Apostolic Delegate. His appointment was approved by the Vietnamese Government, although Apostolic Delegates, being accredited not to the Government but to the Church in the country, are normally assigned without prior consultation of the Government. Accordingly, the 2012 Annuario Pontificio, the first edition published after the change, classified the papal representative office for Vietnam as an Apostolic Delegation, but referred to Archbishop Girelli not as an Apostolic Delegate but, generically, as Papal Representative for Vietnam. On 18 June 2011 Girelli was also appointed Apostolic Nuncio to the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). When diplomatic relations with Malaysia were established on 27 July 2011, Girelli continued, pending the appointment of the first nuncio to that country, to act as non-diplomatic Apostolic Delegate for Malaysia, accredited to the Catholic Church in the country but not to the Government. The 2012 Annuario Pontificio gave no indication of where the first Nuncio to Malaysia was to be resident, whether in Malaysia, Singapore or elsewhere."

He had two daughters from his first marriage and five children from his second. He attended Acadia University and later studied architecture in Boston, later apprenticing with Edward Elliot in Halifax. Beginning about 1901, he earned a living as Principal of Drawing and Manual Training at Horton College (Acadia University) in Wolfville. One of his first commissions was the Kings County Courthouse, completed in nearby Kentville in 1903, and in 1904 he moved to Aylesford where he began to practice full-time. He became a charter member of the Royal Architectural Institute of Canada (RAIC) in 1907 and was made a Fellow in 1939. He was also a founder of the Nova Scotia Association of Architects (NSAA). In 1932 he moved to Wolfville where he continued to practice until his death at the age of 96. Meanwhile, around 1946 he opened an office in Halifax which was managed by his son Laird L. Fairn. This company handled large projects and was known as Leslie R. Fairn & Associates. His career lasted 65 years, earning him the unofficial title of dean of Nova Scotia architects. His style ranged from Beaux Arts to Richardsonian Romanesque to Classical Revival and Modernism. His brother, Clifford William Fairn, also practiced architecture, partnering with Charles Hay and designing several schools in Calgary between 1911 and 1914."

However, his support for Chen Boda during the 1971 Lushan Conference led him to be branded as a supporter of Lin Biao; he was purged and sent into internal exile in Anhui province for eight years. He was politically rehabilitated in 1982, and went on to serve in several advisory positions in the party."

  "text" : "Lothar Mendes (19 May 1894 – 25 February 1974) was a German-born screenwriter and film director. who began his career as an actor in Vienna and Berlin in Max Reinhardt's famous troupe. He went to America in the early 1920s and there he remained until 1933, directing more than a dozen features, mostly frothy comedies, while under contract to Paramount. His films included the last silent film made in America, The Four Feathers (1929) and the murder mystery Payment Deferred (1933) starring British expatriate Charles Laughton. After Hitler ascended to power, Mendes travelled to Britain in 1934 to work at Gaumont-British Pictures, directing films with Sir Michael Balcon producing. Under that banner, he directed Jew Süss (1934) starring one of Germany's most famous emigre actors, Conrad Veidt. Mendes' Jew Suss is not to be confused with the later Nazi film of the same title (1940) which is a Reich-made, virulently anti-Semitic film that deliberately contorted the exiled German-Jewish writer, Lion Feuchtwanger's original novel of the same name, on which Mendes' film was based. Mendes' 1934 film version of Feuchtwanger's novel received strong notices at the time, and was considered an important and early film in exposing the origins of the violent anti-semitism of the then-newly empowered Nazi Party; in particular, it was praised by Albert Einstein and the Jewish American leader, Rabbi Stephen Wise, who encouraged its distribution in America under the title Power, though the film itself did not attract an audience in Depression America. In 1936, Mendes directed his best-known film, the H.G. Wells short story, The Man Who Could Work Miracles (1936) starring Sir Ralph Richardson, for which H.G. Well himself co-wrote the adaptation. His last British film was Moonlight Sonata aka The Charmer and starred the aging piano legend Paderewski as himself; it's notable for containing rare performance footage of the legendary pianist, then in exile from his native Nazi-occupied Poland. By 1941, Mendes had returned to Hollywood where he co-directed the pro-British International Squadron (1941), one of several films on the Eagle Squadron of American pilots who volunteered to fly in the Battle of Britain before the US entered the war. His last feature films were patriotic WW2 fare with such stars as Rosalind Russell as a Navy reconnaissance pilot who must fly one more mission before getting married in Flight for Freedom (1943) and Edward G Robinson as a man who may or may not have married a spy in Tampico (1944). He retired from films in 1946, and the remaining decaes of his life remain murky. \"A competent, dependable director,\" comments film historian Larry Langman, \"he never achieved the critical success in America that came to some of his compatriots.\""

Stiff's father was \"a factory worker with only a third-grade education\". Stiff studied mathematics at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, graduating in 1971, and went on to earn a masters degree from Duke University in 1974 and a doctorate in mathematics education from North Carolina State University in 1978. After teaching mathematics at the middle school and high school levels, and then holding a faculty position at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte beginning in 1978, he returned to NCSU in 1983. From 2000 to 2002 Stiff was president of the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics. Under his leadership, the NCTM pushed for a greater emphasis on basic computational skills in elementary and secondary school mathematics education, and for an appropriate emphasis on conceptual understanding. Stiff rejected simple solutions to complex issues, saying that \"Back to basics is moving backward. Number-crunching alone is no longer enough.\" Instead, Stiff has recommended better training and incentives for mathematics teachers, a teaching style that incorporates a variety of ways of looking at the same material, and an attitude that all students can learn mathematics regardless of their background. In 1995 he was a Fulbright scholar in Ghana. In 2009 he was an NCSU College Distinguished Award recipient, and in 2010 the NCSU College of Education gave him their Distinguished Alumni Award."

When the second German television broadcaster ZDF had launched in 1963, van Burg in the following year became the host of Der goldene Schuss, a game show that quickly reached an immense popularity. Referring to Schiller's Wilhelm Tell, in an early example of an interactive game the contestants, supported by viewers via telephone, had to true up the bolt of a crossbow trying to hit the bullseye on a displayed target. The ritual, accompanied by van Burg's catchphrases (\"Wunnebar\"), became a TV classic. On 25 August 1966 the show was even broadcast from the Monte Carlo Casino starring Grace Kelly and in 1967 it was adopted by the British ITV network (The Golden Shot). In the same year however, van Burg had to hand off the show after the yellow press had spread rumours about his private life. In the following years he again worked as a conferencier until he was able to return on the TV screen in 1976, again hosting several game shows on ZDF. From 1979 he also worked with Frank Elstner as a radio host on the German service of Radio Luxemburg. Lou van Burg died in Munich, aged 68."

  "text" : "Lamees Dhaif (Arabic: لميس ضيف‎‎) is a Bahraini journalist, active in the Bahraini resistance campaign. As early as 2009 she was in trouble, being summonsed to the Public Prosecutor's office after she had accused some judges of corruption. She has supported the Bahraini uprising that began as part of the Arab Spring. Her work has made her the target of government crackdowns on journalists. She is renowned for political and social criticism, including satirical articles. She has written in various newspapers in the Persian Gulf region, and she has a column in Alyaum, one of the most important newspapers in Saudi Arabia. Dhaif became famous when she presented a program on Al-Rai, a private Kuwaiti television channel which talked about taboo issues such as poverty, sadism, prostitution, corruption, and inequality. It also included social issues such as enslavement of foreign labor and problems faced by local women who are married to foreigners. Dhaif is popular among youth and intellectuals, but her articles have always aroused controversy. A legal case was filed against her after she harshly criticized corrupt judges, however, the case was suspended because of pressure from both local and international organizations. Dhaif is also a human rights activist and was a member of the Board of Directors of the Bahraini Journalists Association for three consecutive rounds. However, she resigned from the Association in protest at political reports issued by members from the Association. She faces fierce criticism, between now and then, because of her opposition to corruption. She was chosen as an \"agent of change\" by CNN as one of 8 women in the Arab Spring who had supported the revolution in their country Because she has supported the revolution in Bahrain, she was threatened in so many ways. Various international entities like Freedom House have addressed the government to protect her. The Bahrain Press Association has also included Dhaif in their First Report on Press and Journalism in Bahrain from 1 January to 15 July 2011. She was among the journalists who were targeted by the government. International human rights organisations that participated in the UN Human Rights Council’s Universal Periodic Review (UPR) of Bahrain in Geneva in May 2012 were alarmed at threats made against Bahraini civil society members, including Lamees Dhaif, who were present. During the UPR Working Group Session for the adoption of the report on Bahrain on 25 May 2012, UN Human Rights Council President Laura Dupuy Lasserre expressed concern about “a media campaign which is taking place in [Bahrain], identifying and threatening representatives of civil society who came to Geneva to participate in this review.” She emphasised that governments have the obligation to protect the rights of their people and called for Bahrain’s government to commit to that. Dhaif had done lots of videoed reports and commentaries on the situatiuon in Bahrain. She has presented and directed a program on Lualua television. It mainly portrayed what took place in her country in a sarcastic way. In addition to her role in the media, Lamees Dhaif has also worked in collaboration with national and international figures on humanitarian issues for the well being of the Bahraini people. She is now the Chairman of Hope Defenders, a Geneva-based Organization supporting freedom of expression & democratic transformation in the Arab world. (Twitter: @Hopedefenders) She has also worked on various charity campaigns to help needy families and unfortunate students who did not receive scholarships because they belonged to a certain sect. Other campaigns also targeted detainees' and martyrs' families. She is well known in her country for embracing and helping the needy. A few months after start of the revolution, Dhaif moved out of the country. Currently, she is living in London where she received political asylum. Although living in exile, Dhaif continues to use the tools of social media (Twitter & Facebook) in addition to YouTube to report on what is taking place in her country. She continues to represent her country in international conferences and workshops including two sessions in the United Nations."

The troupe played in Odessa, from which it was evacuated to Kharkov and from there to Asia. It played for a short time in Ashkhabad and then ceased to exist.) \"Then Lola Folman, a woman of about thirty, slightly plump, dressed in short trousers fashioned, apparently, from an old floral dress and an open, sleeveless shirt - the finest of feminine fashion on the ship - climbed to the top of the companionway ladder. It was hard to guess, from her appearance, why she had gone up there, but when she opened her mouth and began to sing in a lovely clear strong voice, folk-songs from a world no longer extant, a shudder ran through the audience. ... Lola Folman sang a new song, Exodus, which excited all of us and was cheered to the echo. The words were written by her husband Yitzhak Perlov.\" Folman gave performances in the Bergen-Belsen displaced persons camp in 1948. She emigrated to New York and was buried in the Jewish cemetery in Queens, NY in 1979."

  "text" : "Levoy Exil (born 1944), is a master Haitian artist and painter; he is one of the main contributors to the Saint Soleil art movement. Exil's paintings are mystical and abstract and often depict Haitian Vodou Loas, suns and stars, birds, and Marassas. His painting style is primitive and dreamlike and employs the Pointillism technique of applying small, distinct dots in a pattern to reveal an image. There are rarely unused portions of the canvas in his works and he draws from African, Haitian and Vodou influences. Exil has participated in conferences focused on Haitian Vodou, including KOSANBA's 9th International Colloquium held in Mirebalais in July, 2009. Levoy Exil was born in 1944, in Fermathe, Haiti. Along with Prospere Pierre-Louis, Dieuseul Paul, Denis Smith, and Louisiane Saint Fleurant he formed the renowned Cinq Soleil (Five Suns) art movement. The Five Suns group formed out of the Saint Soleil movement, of which Levoy Exil was a member and master painter. His work is well regarded by collectors and he has exhibited in France, Rome, the United States and parts of Asia. Haitian Art historian Seldon Rodman referenced Exil's paintings in his book “Where Art is Joy: Haitian Art: The First Forty Years” In 2010, Exil was featured in a CNN article after the earthquake that struck Haiti. Later that year the Smithsonian Institution sponsored the Folklife Festival in Washington DC which featured presentations and art work by Levoy Exil and other prominent Haitian artists."

  "text" : "Louis St Vincent Powell (13 November 1902 – 6 June 1995) played first-class cricket for Somerset in 10 matches between 1927 and 1938. He was an all-round sportsman who also once played rugby for Bath Rugby Club.  He was born at Kingstown, St Vincent and died at Bath, Somerset. Powell was a right-handed lower-order batsman and a right-arm fast bowler. He was a prominent member of Bath Cricket Club, and eight of his 10 first-class matches were played at Bath. His debut in 1927, however, was at Taunton and the three Lancashire wickets he took in that game amounted to more than half his first-class career total. In his Obituary in Wisden Cricketers' Almanack in 1996, Powell's batting in this match was also discussed: \"He was... forced to face Ted McDonald in full cry when he went out to bat (at) No 10...: the senior pro Tom Young noticed his pads were not good enough, loaned him his and Powell made 22.\" Powell played a couple of matches in 1927 and then one in 1928, but reappeared more regularly in matches at Bath from 1934 to 1938. His first match on his return was his most successful: still batting at No 10, he made 52 against Hampshire sharing a ninth wicket stand of 97 (Wisden says 101) with Jack White. Powell also played rugby union for Bath and for Somerset. A ubiquitous figure in Bath sport, Louis Powell trophies are still competed for at Bath Cricket Club and Bath Golf Club at Sham Castle, and he was the first to broadcast cricket commentary on a hospital radio system at the Royal United Hospital in Bath, covering cricket from the Recreation Ground alongside Bill Andrews. In 1935, Powell married Nora Pratten from Midsomer Norton, Somerset, daughter of Frank Pratten who founded Prattens, manufacturer of prefabricated classrooms and other buildings."

  "text" : "Luke Seomore is an award-winning English film director, and musician, part of a critically acclaimed filmmaking duo working alongside English director Joseph Bull. They often work together under the name 'Institute for Eyes'. Their work includes music videos, film, television and art installations. They write and direct their films together, while Seomore composes original soundtracks. Their feature documentary Isolation premiered at Edinburgh International Film Festival in 2009. The film received numerous positive reviews,The Guardian wrote that Isolation was 'a beautifully attuned piece of work' while Sight and Sound wrote 'The film replicates this chaos by introducing a potent clash of poetry and magic realism in between the naturalistic interviews.' and Little White Lies proclaimed it was one of the three best British films at EIFF, describing the documentary had a 'visually stunning aesthetic that is absolutely riveting, a vital and important documentary that stays with you long after it has finished' The film also caught the attention of English film director Ken Loach, who described the film as 'important document of the experiences of ex-soldiers through the eyes of someone who knows.’ Dazed & Confused magazine commissioned a discussion between Seomore and Loach, to celebrate the release of Route Irish. Seomore composed the film's entire score and a live soundtrack version of the film premiered at Branchange Film festival in Jersey. After Jersey the film backed by live score (additional musicians Michael Garrad and David Stephens) sold out two dates at The Roundhouse and one date at the Barbican. In July 2010 Picturehouse Cinemas released Isolation nationwide. The film toured throughout the UK, a live score was performed at each screening by Seomore alongside musicians Michael Garrad and David Stephens."

  "text" : "Lovinsky Pierre-Antoine is a Haitian human rights and political activist and former head of the September 30th Foundation, an advocacy group founded to assist victims of the 1991 coup that removed Haiti's first elected president, Jean-Bertrand Aristide, from office. The foundation worked to win the release of hundreds of political prisoners, including some detained during the 2004-06 \"interim government\". Lovinsky was abducted after a meeting in Delmas with American and Canadian human rights investigators on August 12, 2007. Because his whereabouts were known, some believed that someone associated with Lovinsky betrayed him. At the time of his disappearance, he was working as an adviser to their delegation in Haiti. Days before his abduction, he had announced his intention to run for the office of Senator as a candidate of the Fanmi Lavalas party. On August 14, 2007, his family was contacted and a ransom of $300,000 USD was demanded, but there was no further contact from his abductors. His disappearance was taken up by Amnesty International."

In 2009, at the age of 9, he was thrust into the media spotlight as the world's youngest iPhone developer, responsible for the app Doodle Kids. CNN International ranked him as the Singapore \"Icon of cool\" and he was listed as one of the reasons why Singapore is the world's greatest city. He started programming at the age of 7 with the help of his father, working on an old Apple IIGS computer using Applesoft BASIC, Complete Pascal and ORCA/Pascal (based on Object Pascal). He wrote many applications including Doodle Kids and Invader War on the Apple IIGS. He later rewrote Doodle Kids for the iPhone and then Android platforms. Between the time it was launched till the end of 2010, Doodle Kids has been downloaded more than 880,000 times (iOS and Android platforms combined). He can now program in Objective-C, Java, JavaScript and ActionScript. He is currently working on Invader War 2, an iPad arcade game written using Cocos2d. He also hosted a YouTube show called \"The Apple IIGS Show\" with his sisters Lim Xin Quan and Lim Xin Mei. The show uses Apple IIGS computers to do graphics and animation."

  "text" : "Louisiane Saint Fleurant (1924–2005) was a Haitian female artist and painter. She was a founder of the peasant Saint Soleil art movement. Saint Fleurant's paintings often depict primitive maternal scenes of females, children, trees, wildlife, and Haitian Vodou Loas. Her folk painting style is often colorful and vibrant and expresses a distinct female perspective on the Saint Soleil movement and Haitian Vodou art. Louisiane Saint Fleurant was born on September 11, 1924, in Petit-Trou-de-Nippes, Haiti. Along with Prospere Pierre-Louis, Dieuseul Paul, Denis Smith, and Levoy Exil she formed the renowned Cinq Soleil (Five Suns) art movement. The Five Suns group formed out of the Saint Soleil movement, of which Louisiane was the only female artist. She is affectionately called the godmother of the art movement. She was not formally trained in art and began painting only in her late 40s. Louisiane was originally introduced to the Saint Soleil art community as a peasant cook and after receiving some direction from Jean-Claude Garoute, she started her practice in painting and sculpture. Louisiane is the mother of five children including the renowned artist Stevenson Magloire. She painted and sculpted for 30 years until the age of 80 when poor vision precluded her ability to continue in 2002. Saint Fleurant died in her home on June 1, 2005. A second tragedy hit her family when the cemetery where she was buried was bulldozed following the 2010 Haiti earthquake. Her work has been exhibited in Asia, Europe, and the United States and has recently been part of fundraising, relief, and awareness efforts following the 2010 Haiti earthquake. Louisiane Saint Fleurant's folk paintings are well regarded by collectors for their unique manifestations of motherhood and her female perspective on Haitian and Vodou folk art."

She produces a range of functional ware for the preparation, cooking and serving of food. Alongside functional ware, she makes a range of work that she describes as \"individual and playful\". Hammond worked in Greenwich, London, from 1979 and recently set up a studio at Okehampton, Devon. In 2003-2004, she spent three months making and firing in the Mino, Gifu, area for several exhibitions in Japan. She taught ceramics at Goldsmith's College, London, and has lectured and exhibited widely. Hammond has been described as one of the most committed and driven of modern studio potters, \"one of a small number who have clearly inherited the mantle of studio pioneers like Michael Cardew\" and \"the best woman potter working in Britain.\" Her work is represented in museums and collections in the UK and abroad. Hammond was awarded an MBE in the 2016 birthday honours list."

She was the subject of This Is Your Life in 1958 when she was surprised by Eamonn Andrews at the King's Theatre, Edinburgh. In the 1970s, Ramsay acted at Laurence Olivier's National Theatre, in Peter Shaffer's Equus, The Misanthrope, with Alec McCowen and Diana Rigg, and as Joan Plowright's sister in Olivier's acclaimed production of JB Priestley's Eden End. On the first night of Eden End, taking a curtain call with Olivier and Priestley himself, she said to herself quietly: \"Lou, I think you've just peaked.\" Ramsay died on 6 March 2011, at the age of 81. She was survived by her husband, actor George Baker, as well as her son from her previous marriage to Irish actor Ronan O'Casey. Baker himself died just seven months later."

The remains of four victims were found in December 2010, while six more sets of remains were found in March and April 2011. Police believe that the latest sets of remains predate the four bodies found in December 2010. On May 9, 2011, authorities surmised that two of the newest sets of remains might be the work of a second killer. On November 29, 2011, however, the police announced that they believe that one person is responsible for all 10 deaths and that they did not believe that the case of Shannan Gilbert, an escort who was missing when the first set of bodies were found, was related. \"It is clear that the area in and around Gilgo Beach has been used to discard human remains for some period of time,\" said Suffolk County District Attorney Thomas Spota."

  "text" : "Leslie Michael Bethell (born 12 February 1937) is an English historian, university professor, and Brazilianist who specialises in the study of 19th- and 20th-century Latin America, focusing on Brazil in particular. He received both his Bachelor of Arts and Doctorate in History at the University of London. Bethell has served as Visiting Professor at the University Research Institute of Rio de Janeiro at the Universidade Cândido Mendes, the University of California, San Diego, and at the University of Chicago. He has been associated with the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, most recently being appointed Senior Scholar of their Brazil Institute, since 1987. He was the founding director of the Centre for Brazilian Studies at the University of Oxford, serving in that capacity from 1998 to 2007. He has also held lengthy academic posts at St Antony's College (as a Fellow) and at his alma mater, the University of London (as Director of the Institute of Latin American Studies and an Honorary Research Fellow). He is the sole editor of the eleven volume Cambridge History of Latin America, a massive attempt at compiling and integrating the existing scholarship of Latin American studies. The entire project took more than fifteen years to be completed. The work was praised widely, with the historian Paul Gootenberg noting that the series had \"earned rave scholarly reviews throughout the 1990s\". The Library Journal referred to the first two volumes of the series as \"the most detailed, comprehensive, and authoritative work on the subject available\", while the political scientist Paul W. Drake called various volumes in the set \"landmark[s] in their field.\" Reviews were not completely positive, however, with some of the volumes being described as \"unwieldy\" and skewed too much to the present age. Alternately, the series has also been criticised for its lack of coverage of issues whose impacts have extended into contemporary times and of the trends that had been emerging in Latin America around the time of its various publication dates. Bethell was elected a sócio correspondente of the Brazilian Academy of Letters in 2010. He was nominated to fill the vacancy left by the death of the Portuguese author José Saramago, and was only the second English person to have been elected to the position, after the philosopher Herbert Spencer. Bethell was also elected as a correspondent to the Brazilian Academy of Sciences in 2004."

Born a Hungarian, Pazmany grew up, went to school and worked in his formative years in Argentina, then immigrated to the United States where he lived for the remainder of his life. His design engineering stretched from early model airplanes made of wood as a child in Argentina through six decades of work on gliders, small planes, jets, and missiles both for private purchase and for the largest defense contractors in America including Convair, General Dynamics and Rohr. Contributions to the unmanned stealth aircraft were utilized in action during the Iraq War in 2004. And for Ryan the Cloudster was his commercial contribution. With a passion for small personal aircraft he became recognized as a world authority on landing gear, light aircraft, and flight efficiencies through his books, plans and planes: The Pazmany PL-1 and PL-2, were used for training, the PL-4A, is a single seat VW powered, T-Tailed with folding wings; and the PL-9 Stork is a ¾ adaptation of the Luftwaffe STOL warbird. He was inducted into the Experimental Aircraft Association Hall of Fame in 1997 for his work in homebuilt aircraft. \"His work and reputation as an aeronautical engineer stretched across continents and touched people in every level of aviation, from government officials to young amateur pilots.\""

During 1912, Whetter joined two sledging parties, the first to lay supplies, and the second to explore the area to the west of the Main Base at Cape Denison. On the second expedition, his party of three man-hauled a sledge 158 miles (254 km) from the Cape Denison base, and in the process discovered the first meteorite to be found in Antarctica. Mawson thought Whetter lazy, and the two clashed several times, Mawson describing Whetter as \"not fit for a polar expedition\"."

He received his B.A. at Dartmouth College in 1936, his MA in psychology at Reed College in 1939, and his Ph.D. in college and educational administration at Columbia University in 1942. From 1948 to 1955 he was president of Allegheny College, and from 1955 to 1963, president of Colorado College. He transformed Colorado College into a nationally recognized training center. When he left in 1955 he had become a recognized national figure in the field of higher education. The annual \"Benezet Prize\" was named after him. From 1963-1970 he was president of Claremont Graduate School and University Center in Claremont, California. As president of Claremont, he left a nationally important legacy, since he organized a change in the \"College Rating System\", introducing a system which reflected the actual performance of alumni in later life, by following-up on former students with greater efficiency. From 1970 to 1976 he was president of the State University of New York at Albany. Benezet took the view that there had been too much of a readiness to accept the claims of private higher education to improve economic efficiency, the personal treatment of students, to set high standards, and encourage diversity."

  "text" : "Louisa Maria Hubbard (8 March 1836 – 5 November 1906) was an English feminist social reformer and writer. She is best known for her activism for increased opportunities for women's education and employment. Born into a wealthy merchant family in Russia, she moved to England as a young girl and remained there for most of her life. She never married and devoted her time to social activism. She made use of her wealth to fund numerous women's causes. She began her activism in the Anglican deaconess movement in the 1860s. There she organized members and raised awareness of the goals of the movement. Hubbard then began promoting elementary education as a career for women. Though much of English genteel society was scornful of this profession, Hubbard capitalized on increased awareness of the demand for elementary teachers. She then helped to establish a college to train women as elementary teachers. She was concerned that many women were unable to find work as teachers due to poor educational practices. After establishing the college for teachers, she began promoting other careers for women. Hubbard spent much of her life promoting employment opportunities for women who had to work to support themselves. She particularly focused on unmarried women and impoverished gentlewomen and the disdain in which society held the idea of their employment. She also published several pamphlets and newspapers that argued in favour of educating and providing employment for women. She published A Handbook for Women's Work, later known as The Englishwoman's Yearbook, from 1875 to 1889. She also published The Woman's Gazette, later known as Work and Leisure, from 1875 until 1893. Hubbard initially contributed most of the articles to the publications and later served as editor. Though they became well known, they were mostly unprofitable and Hubbard was forced to subsidise them with her personal wealth. Hubbard also established the Women's Emigration Society to help single women find work overseas after she learned of the job opportunities that were available in the British Colonies. She also helped organise other groups that promoted emigration."

  "text" : "Lorraine Huling Maynard (January 20, 1897, Oakesdale, Washington – November, 1971, Old Greenwich, Connecticut) was a silent film actress and author. She was the daughter of Floyd and Florence Simmons Huling. They divorced when Lorraine was five, and her mother worked in Chicago, Illinois, as a nurse/receptionist for Edmund James Doering, who became her lover as well as a father figure for Lorraine. Lorraine attended Chicago public schools and a convent school for the first few years of her education; her mother later placed her in a variety of boarding schools in the United States and abroad. Lorraine spent several summers in Westbrook, Connecticut, with her grandmother, Mary Elizabeth Lyman Simmons, and also frequently travelled abroad with her mother and Doering. When Lorraine was 15, Florence's relationship with Doering ended and she married Charles Young, who drank heavily and made advances to Lorraine on at least one occasion. Encouraged by her mother to go on the stage, Lorraine made her Broadway debut in 1913, playing the role of \"Doll\" in Prunella; she began acting in silent films produced by the Thannhauser Company in New Rochelle, New York, the following year. In 1915, while working as a model in New York City, she met Richard Field Maynard, a portrait painter and Harvard College graduate. A romantic relationship developed between them but was opposed by Richard's parents, who were concerned about the age difference between Richard (born in 1875) and Lorraine, and also about Lorraine's career as an actress. Lorraine's mother also objected to the match, and moved to Hollywood, California, with her daughter. Lorraine appeared in several more films, including King Lear, in which she played Cordelia, and The Fall of a Nation, a response to D.W. Griffith's The Birth of a Nation. (The two films were based on books by the same author, Thomas Dixon, who directed The Fall of a Nation.) Lorraine and Richard corresponded during their separation and married in 1917, with Lorraine retiring from the screen. They had two daughters, Sylvia (born in 1921) and Beverly (born in 1923). Shortly after their marriage, Lorraine began taking creative writing classes at Columbia University. A number of her stories were published in magazines for children; in both 1929 and 1930, her stories were included in anthologies of \"best\" children's stories. She also wrote the children's books Twinkle Little Movie Star, which drew on her knowledge of Hollywood and moviemaking, and Dilly Was Different. In the 1930s, Lorraine began therapy with David Seabury and formed a deep attachment to him. She worked with him on his books, transcribing at least one into Braille, and he provided the introduction to her Genius in Chrysalis: Locked Doors on Greatness Within. Lorraine's last book, Bellevue, written with Dr. Laurence Miscall, was published in 1940. Richard Field Maynard died in 1964 and Lorraine, increasingly dismayed at growing old, committed suicide  in her home in Old Greenwich, Connecticut, in late November, 1971."

  "text" : "Leslie Spier (December 13, 1893 – December 3, 1961) was an American anthropologist best known for his ethnographic studies of American Indians. He spent a great deal of his professional life as a teacher; he retired in 1955 and died in 1961. Spier created a path for the study of cultural change, taking the time to conduct in-depth studies of group contact. His studies focused on changes throughout various cultures over time; he saw great importance in empirical research and made his reports as detailed as possible. Spier’s early years were spent studying the many diverse areas of anthropology ranging from archaeology to physical anthropology. His main interests were studying human relations and analyzing cultural processes among Native American groups. As a teacher, Spier was greatly admired by his students because he was extremely successful in passing along his methodological techniques for gathering exact data. Spier is remembered best for his explanatory studies and widespread fieldwork of cultural groups. Spier continued his research using his personal methodology right to his death in 1961."

  "text" : "Lady Adela Jaff or Adela Khanem, called the Princess of the Brave by the British, was a famous and cultured chief of the Jaff tribe, one of the biggest Kurdish tribes, if not the biggest, native to the Zagros area, which is divided between Iran and Iraq. Adela Khanem was of the famous aristocratic Sahibqeran family, who intermarried with the tribal chiefs of Jaff. Lady Adela exerted great influence in the affairs of Jaff tribe in the Sharazor plain. She was born in 1847 to a leading family in Sanandaj, second largest city of Iranian Kurdistan. She married Kurdish King Osman Jaff, a chief of the Jaff tribe, whose headquarters was in Halabja. Later Osman Pasha was appointed the kaimakam of Sharazor, thus allowing Lady Adela to take over. The revival of commerce and restoration of law and order in the region of Halabja is attributed to her sound judgement. She was known for saving lives of many British army officers during World War I and was awarded the title of Khan-Bahadur by the British commander.She died in 1924 and buried in Halabja. Gertrude Bell, British politician and writer, describes Adela Khanem in a letter in 1921 as follow: \"The feature of Halabja is 'Adlah Khanum the great Jaff Beg Zadah lady, mother of Ahmad Beg. She is the widow of Kurdish King Osman Pasha Jaff, sometime dead, and continues to rule the Jaff as much as she can and intrigue more than you would think anyone could, and generally behave as great Kurdish ladies do behave. She has often written to me, feeling, I've no doubt, that we must be birds of a feather, and I hastened to call on her after lunch. She is a striking figure in her gorgeous Kurdish clothes with jet black curls (dyed, I take it) falling down her painted cheeks from under her huge headdress. We carried on in Persian, a very complimentary talk in the course of which I managed to tell them how well 'Iraq was doing under Faisal and to assure them that all we wished was that our two children, 'Iraq and Kurdistan, should live in peace and friendship with one another\". Vladimir Minorsky has reported his meeting with Lady Adela in the region of Halabja in 1913. Major Soane wrote about her in his book To Mesopotamia and Kurdistan in Disguise: \"a woman unique in Islam, in the power she possesses, and the efficacy with which she uses the weapons in her hands.... In a remote corner of the Turkish Empire, which decays and retrogrades, is one little spot, which, under the rule of a Kurdish woman has risen from a village to be a town, and one hill-side, once barren, now sprinkled with gardens; and these are in a measure renovations of the ancient state of these parts.\""

  "text" : "Leslie Thomas \"Les\" Mogg (27 August 1929 – 2 May 2012) was an Australian rules footballer who played with North Melbourne in the Victorian Football League (VFL). Mogg came to North Melbourne from Ballarat and was a regular member of the team from the second half of the 1950 season. He was a wingman for North Melbourne in the 1950 VFL Grand Final. Also used as a half forward flanker during his career, Mogg kicked 16 goals in 1952. Injuries restricted him to just five games in 1953 but he played all but two of North Melbourne's matches the following year. He left the club after the 1954 season to take up the position of captain-coach for Cobram Football Club in the Murray Football League (MFL). In 1955, his first season, he led Cobram to a grand final win and captain-coached them to three further premierships, all in succession, from 1959 to 1961. As a player he had a particularly strong season in 1961, winning the O'Dwyer Medal as the league's \"Best and Fairest\". He topped the MFL goal-kicking that year as well, with 85 goals. It was the second time he had won the goal-kicking award, which is now named after him, having also kicked a league record 132 goals in 1960, 148 after finals. He also had the distinction of being the captain-coach of the MFL combined team which upset VFL club St Kilda by 14 points in a 1960 practice match. It is believed to have been the first time since 1914 that a country side had beaten a VFL team."

Hodgson was born in Salt Lake City. As a young man, he studied with several architects, including Frank Lloyd Wright. In Utah he was employed as a draughtsman under Richard K.A. Kletting and Ware & Treganza. He moved to Ogden in 1906, and partnered with Julius A. Smith from 1906 to 1910. During that time he designed several of the houses in the David Eccles Subdivision. In 1919, he partnered with Myrl A. McClenahan. During his 40-year career, Hodgson designed more than 75 buildings. He was best known for his art deco style, as seen in Ogden High School. He was also known for prairie school style, seen in the David Eccles Subdivision, and various period revival styles, seen in the Bigelow-Ben Lomond Hotel and Peery's Egyptian Theater. Hodgson was the official architect for the Ogden School board for 25 years, and an architect for federal agencies during World War II."

He played in three matches in 1919, making his highest score, 30, in the second of these, against Worcestershire. Four more games followed with less success in 1921 and to the end of that season he had bowled just a single over in first-class cricket. In 1922, however, in the match against Leicestershire at Aylestone Road, Leicester, White was not playing and Key was given 17.1 overs, and took two wickets, the only dismissals of his first-class career.

Bermen, in drafting acts during his tenure, referred to himself as the royal notary. This was not within his rights to do so since that type of appointment could only be made by the king or his representative. Nevertheless, he created 39 notarial acts in his time in the New World. Four more notaries who followed Bermen in the post acted on his precedent and used the title. They were: Claude Lecoustre (1647–1648), Guillaume Audouart (1649–1663), Jean Durand (1653–1654) and Louis Rouer de Villeray (1653–1657). None legally held the title. Bermen would have fallen under the authority of the Company of One Hundred Associates (Compagnie des Cent-Associés) in regards to his work as a notary. It would seem that they had some ability to shape the laws of this new colony."

  "text" : "Lakdhas Wikkrama Sinha (Sinhala: ලක්දාස් වික්‍රමසිංහ, 1941–1978) was a Sri Lankan poet who wrote in English and Sinhala. He was educated at St Thomas' College, Mount Lavinia, Sri Lanka, and studied law before becoming an English teacher. His interest in Sinhala literature led him to experiment with methods of fusing Western and South Asian traditions creatively in his own writing. A bilingual poet, whose career ended prematurely with his death by drowning, Wikkrama Sinha's first book of verse, Lustre: Poems (Kandy, 1965 ), was written entirely in English in the contrary spirit of one who, finding himself constrained by his education to write in the language of ‘the most despicable people on earth’, had set himself to write as anarchically as possible. This mood did not last. His work appeared in Madrona, Eastern Horizon, New Ceylon Writing, Outposts, University of Chicago Review, and other local and international journals, and was published privately by him in Janakiharana and Other Poems ( 1967 ), Fifteen Poems ( 1970 —both Kandy), and Nossa Senhora dos Chingalas ( 1973 ), O Regal Blood ( 1975 ), and The Grasshopper Gleaming ( 1976 —all Colombo). In honour of a Sri Lankan artist of a previous generation, Wikkramasinha edited and privately published Twelve Poems to Justin Daraniyagala 1903 –67 (Kandy, 1971 )."

During the Nazi invasion of Poland then the SS-Brigadeführer Beutel commanded Einsatzgruppe IV. In this position Beutel organised the initial capture of Warsaw's Jewish population and set in motion their ghettoization. Beutel was also active in Bydgoszcz where he personally ordered a number of mass shootings including the murder of around 120-150 Poles taken to nearby woods and shot on 11 and 12 September 1939. This figure is given as 900 by another source. Police commander Arthur Nebe ordered that Beutel, who quickly became noted for his corruption, be investigated for the rape of a Polish girl whose mother cooked for the SS. By mid-October 1939 Beutel had been replaced as Einsatzgruppe IV chief by Josef Albert Meisinger."

During his 31 years of service, Ferrill attracted and baptized many new members in the growing region; by 1850 the church had 1,820 members and was the largest of any congregation in the state, black or white. Of mixed race, Ferrill had been apprenticed as a carpenter when young. His wife, a free person of color, purchased his freedom and they moved to Kentucky by 1812. In Lexington, Ferrill was successful in working with both black and white leaders of the city, and became highly respected. The funeral procession for him numbered 5,000 people, the largest in the city after that of the white statesman Henry Clay. Ferrill led the first black church west of the Allegheny Mountains; it was the third oldest black Baptist congregation in the United States, and had been founded in 1790 by enslaved preacher Peter Durrett, also from Virginia."

  "text" : "Lennart Per-Olav Hedmark (born 18 May 1944 in Skellefteå) is a retired Swedish track and field athlete who competed in the decathlon. He represented his country three times at the Summer Olympics (1968, 1972 and 1976). He started his career as a javelin throw specialist and claimed three straight titles in the event at the Swedish Championships from 1963 to 1965. He was selected to compete at the 1964 Summer Olympics, but did not start the competition. His first international medal came at the 1965 Summer Universiade, where he was the bronze medallist. Hedmark changed his focus to combined events in 1967 and he was one of his region's dominant athletes over his career: he had four consecutive victories in the Nordic Combined Events Championships from 1967 to 1970, and in a decade of national competition he won seven Swedish decathlon titles in addition to five titles in the pentathlon. At the 1968 Summer Olympics he came eleventh in the decathlon. International medals came at the 1970 Summer Universiade, where he took the silver behind Mykola Avilov, and at the 1971 European Athletics Championships, finishing as runner-up to the defending champion Joachim Kirst. He made his second Olympic appearance at the 1972 Munich Games, but he did not manage to finish the competition. The following year he was the inaugural winner of the European Combined Events Cup. His best performance of the year came in Bonn and his total of 8163 points was the best by any athlete that year. Hedmark's final major appearance came at the 1976 Summer Olympics and had his best Olympic outing with a score of 8002 for eighth place. Although he never won a major title, Hedmark's career was one of the most prolific as he competed in a total of 76 combined events competitions. This was the greatest number ever for a top level athlete at the time and remains among the highest totals; Kip Janvrin bettered this achievement and was himself succeeded by Roman Šebrle, who completed over 100 appearances. Hedmark is now the fourth most prolific combined eventer after Janvrin, Šebrle and Tomáš Dvořák. He married Briton Linda Knowles, a fellow top class European athlete."

Along with Simeonie Amagoalik in Resolute, Pijamini was commissioned by the Canadian government to build a monument to the High Arctic relocation which took place in 1955. Pijamini's monument, located in Grise Fiord, depicts a woman with a young boy and a husky, with the woman somberly looking out towards the ocean. Pijamini said that he intentionally made them look melancholy because the relocation was not a happy event. The monument was unveiled in September 2010, and received praise from the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation."

This person happened to be his son Lophis, whom the king did not hesitate to slay nevertheless. Mortally wounded, Lophis still managed to run around for a short while before he fell down dead. From the flow of his blood rose up a river which was named Lophis after the young man. A similar motif occurs in the story of Idomeneus and his son, and, in Biblical mythology, of Jephthah and his daughter."

In his research, Guth has strengthened Gromov's systolic inequality for essential manifolds and, along with Nets Katz, found a solution to the Erdős distinct distances problem. His wide-ranging interests include the Kakeya conjecture and the systolic inequality. He was awarded one of the 2016 New Horizons in Mathematics prizes. He is the son of physicist Alan Guth known for the theory of Inflation in cosmology and the nephew of Lucille Guth, a social worker."

  "text" : "Leslie M. O'Connor (August 31, 1889 – January 20, 1966) was an American lawyer and professional baseball executive. He was the assistant to the Commissioner of Baseball from January 1921 until the death of Commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis on November 25, 1944; then he filled the void as acting commissioner (technically, as chairman of the Major League Advisory Council) until the election of Happy Chandler as Landis' successor on April 24, 1945. After spending another six months in the commissioner's office as Chandler's top assistant, O'Connor became general manager of the Chicago White Sox of Major League Baseball from November 1945 through November 1948, and he later served as president of the Pacific Coast League. Born in Chicago, Illinois, O'Connor was admitted to the bar and served in World War I as a member of the Judge Advocate General's Corps. When Landis was appointed Commissioner in the wake of the 1919 Black Sox Scandal, O'Connor became his top administrator for 24 seasons until Landis' sudden death in 1944. As Landis' right-hand man, he was involved in investigations, writing Landis' decisions and keeping records. After five months as acting commissioner—as head of the three-man council that included league presidents Ford Frick and Will Harridge—during the waning months of World War II, O'Connor stepped aside for Chandler and was his top aide during the transition until after the 1945 baseball season. He then was named general manager of the White Sox by team owner Grace Comiskey and held that post for three losing campaigns. After the White Sox lost 101 games and finished last in the eight-team American League in 1948, O'Connor stepped down and was succeeded by Frank Lane. He remained in baseball, however, as a member of the Major-Minor League Executive Council, and then as legal counsel for and president of the top-level Pacific Coast League. As PCL president from 1956 through 1959, he was in office during the tumultuous shift of the Dodgers and Giants from New York City to Los Angeles and San Francisco, which resulted in a significant alteration of the PCL map. O'Connor died in Tokyo at the age of 76."

  "text" : "Louis Karchin (born September 8, 1951) is an American composer, conductor and educator. He has composed over 60 works including unaccompanied and chamber music, symphonic works and opera. His music has been recognized by awards from the American Academy of Arts and Letters (Andrew Imbrie Award, Goddard Lieberson Fellowship, and Walter N. Hinrichsen Award), the National Endowment for the Arts, and the John Simon Guggenheim Foundation, and he has received commissions from the Serge Koussevitzky, Fromm, and Barlow Foundations. His 70-minute chamber opera, Romulus, a setting of the Alexandre Dumas, père play, was premiered at the Peter B. Lewis Theatre of the Guggenheim Museum in May, 2007\" and subsequently issued on a Naxos CD. Other major works include American Visions, a vocal-instrumental song-cycle on poems of Yevgeny Yevtushenko (New World Records), and a masque, Orpheus, based on a poem by Stanley Kunitz (Albany Records). Of the latter work, critic Jules Langert wrote of its San Francisco premiere, “The music seemed in constant flux, creating strong, richly textured sonorities….and brilliant splashes of color; this Orpheus floated on an incandescent fabric of sound.”\" Mr. Karchin’s music is published by C. F. Peters Corporation and the American Composers Alliance. Active as a conductor and presenter of new music, Mr. Karchin co-founded the Harvard Group for New Music, the Chamber Players of the League-ISCM, and the Orchestra of the League of Composers. With these groups, he conducted New York or world premieres of works by Elliott Carter, Charles Wuorinen, Joan Tower, Julia Wolfe, Milton Babbitt, Bernard Rands, David Rakowski, Arthur Kreiger, and Jason Treuting, among others. Karchin was born in Philadelphia, PA, and is Professor of Music at New York University. He received a B. Mus. degree from the Eastman School of Music, an M.A. and Ph.D. from Harvard University, and was twice a Leonard Bernstein Fellow at Tanglewood. His principal teachers included Samuel Adler, Joseph Schwantner, Leon Kirchner, Earl Kim and Gunther Schuller."

The investigations he led helped indict a sitting Governor, Aníbal Acevedo Vilá, who was later acquitted, and convict two sitting senators, Jorge De Castro Font and Héctor Martínez Maldonado, among others. Fraticelli, born in 1961, is a native of Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri, where his father was serving in the United States Army and relocated to his parents' native Puerto Rico when he was 10 years old. A graduate of Gabriela Mistral High School in San Juan and earned his bachelor's degree in Business Administration at the University of Puerto Rico's main campus in Río Piedras in 1984. He began his FBI career that same year, serving in El Paso, Texas. From 1988 until 1995 he served as a special agent in San Juan, after which he was promoted to a supervisory role at FBI headquarters. After a stint supervising a drug trafficking task force in Phoenix, Arizona from 1997 to 2000, he was named assistant special agent in-charge at the Dallas, Texas Field Office. Before his appointment in April 2004 as Special Agent in charge for Puerto Rico and the United States Virgin Islands, Fraticelli once again served two years at FBI headquarters, and two months as acting Special Agent in Charge in Puerto Rico for two months in 2002."

  "text" : "Levi Tafari was born and raised in the city of Liverpool by his Jamaican parents. He attended catering college, where he studied classical French cuisine and graduated with distinction. In the early 1980s, while working as a caterer, he started attending the Liverpool 8 Writers Workshop and decided to become a performance poet. Tafari was a firm member of the Rastafarian movement and although his early performances were in that community, he saw it as his duty to reach a wider audience and began performing overseas. Tafari self-identifies as an Urban Griot (the griot being the traditional consciousness raiser, storyteller, newscaster and political agitator). He has four collections of poetry, Duboetry (1987), Liverpool Experience (1989), Rhyme Don’t Pay (1998) and From the Page to the Stage (2006). His plays have been performed at the Blackheath Theater in Stafford and the Unity Theatre, Liverpool. He was also the first person to use the term \"duboetry.\" Several of his musical tracks can be found on compilation albums and he has recorded poetry, which has been released on audiocassette. Tafari often runs creative writing workshops at schools, colleges, universities and prisons. Most recently he has applied his work to working with the British Council, undertaking tours to the Czech Republic, Jordan, Portugal, Germany and Singapore. He was Writer in Residence at Charles University in Prague. He has also appeared in many television programs including Blue Peter and Grange Hill. He also made a film about Rastafarianism for BBC television's Everyman program. In 2001 Tafari toured with scrap recycle band, Urban Strawberry Lunch. He has also worked with the Ghanaian drum and dance ensemble Delado, the Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra, jazz musician Dennis Rollins, and his own reggae band, Ministry of Love. Currently, Tafari is preparing a new collection of poems, experimenting in the recording studio with new sounds along with guitarist Ekio Falkenburg and he continues to perform his work in venues across the globe. In early 2009 Tafari worked with children from Elmgrove Primary School in Belfast for their live performance in St George's Market. He attended the performance on 2 April 2009."

Returning to Pennsylvania, he married Natalie Hannau of Philadelphia on March 8, 1886. In 1889, he went to Vienna to study law and the history of diplomacy, specializing in international law. He published numerous translations of French and German articles in his area of specialization. From Vienna, he launched his diplomatic career.
