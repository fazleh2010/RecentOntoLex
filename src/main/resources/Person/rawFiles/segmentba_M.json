Brizzi married Luigi Giorgi in 1793 and opened a salon, continuing to perform as a pianist in Europe. She was admired as a performer, and Haydn, Muzio Clementi and Leopold Kozeluch dedicated works to her. A military march composed by Brizzi was performed for Napoleon when he passed through Bologna in 1807. She taught music and was member of the Accademia Filarmonica di Bologna.

Khoshaba was known for his bravery, cruelty and military capabilities during this time. Later in life however, Khoshaba became a figure of great controversy among Assyrians. He was seen by many (though not all) as a divisive figure, particularly with regards to undermining the cause of Assyrian autonomy within the newly created state of Iraq in 1932. Khoshaba murdered his own wife and daughters, believing her to have been unfaithful to him. He escaped to Turkey, where he is rumoured to have killed a bear while armed only with a knife."

  "text" : "Marguerite of Burgundy (referred to as Anne by some sources; 1192–1243), was, by marriage, Countess of Savoy from 1233 until her death. She was the youngest daughter of Hugh III, Duke of Burgundy, and his second wife, Béatrice of Albon. Around 1217, she married Amadeus IV, Count of Savoy. As dowry, she brought Miribel castle, Ornacieux castle, and other properties in Viennois territory. The marriage was agreed to as part of a treaty between the families, including terms not to acquire further territories within each other's dominions. She and her new husband were also designated as heirs for her brother Guigues VI of Viennois after any children of his. However, this peace between the families did not last long, with conflict resuming by 1228. She also personally inherited some money upon the death of her mother. The 1267 will of her nephew Guigues VII of Viennois confirmed donations of property which she had made. Marguerite and Amadeus had two daughters: \n*  Beatrice of Savoy (d. 1258), married firstly in 1233 to Manfred III of Saluzzo (d. 1244), married secondly on April 21, 1247 to Manfred of Sicily \n*  Margaret of Savoy (d. 1254), married firstly on December 9, 1235 to Boniface II of Montferrat, married secondly to Aymar III, Count of Valentinois Note that some scholars are unclear on Marguerite's given name. A book about the house of Savoy at this time mentions the debate regarding her name, but finds a source which Cox finds settles the debate."

She is the author of My War at Home, a memoir reflecting on her life as an Afghan American, in which she speaks of conflicts arising from her need for independence in the scheme of Afghan traditional culture, for example, her arranged marriage with an Afghan man. She is president and founder of Young Afghan-World Alliance. The organization was founded upon Masuda's return from a trip to Afghanistan, during which she had learned that 19 members of her family were killed in an October 2001 US air raid 60 miles north of Kandahar. Masuda was featured in and contributed to the making of the documentary From Ground Zero to Ground Zero in which she travels to Afghanistan with documentary maker Jon Alpert. It is during this trip she learns of the killings in the October air raid."

  "text" : "Maureen Muggeridge (13 August 1948 – 7 October 2010) was a niece of Malcolm Muggeridge but made her name in a very different field. After graduating in Geology from the University of St Andrews, she made her own way to Perth, Western Australia, with support from her family. Within a week she got a job with a mining company called Tanganyika Holdings and was flying over the Outback searching for diamonds. Tanganyika Holdings was involved in a joint venture with other companies. In 1976 minerals were found which suggested the presence of diamonds. A joint venture was set up with CRA Exploration which they called the Ashton Joint Venture. This was masterminded by Rees Towie, managing director of Northern Mining. In 1979, Maureen married Towie's son John, she became pregnant and she discovered diamond samples in the flood plains surrounding Smoke Creek, a small stream in East Kimberley that drained into Lake Argyle. At the time word had got out that there might be diamonds and rival exploration teams were in the area. To put them off the scent, CRA put it about that Maureen had gone on maternity leave while in fact she was tracing the source of the diamonds to the headwaters of Smoke Creek and pegging out the boundaries of her claim. This turned out to be the world's largest known diamond deposit, larger than all the rest put together. Today these diamonds are among the world's rarest gems and the mine produces one third of global output. Maureen Muggeridge received international recognition for papers on the applications of explosion-sampling techniques. She directed exploration for Moonstone Diamond Corporation in Perth and then set up her own Paramount Mining Corporation. It was floated on the Australian Stock Exchange in 2004. She died of a stroke while sampling for diamonds at Napier Downs, in a remote part of Western Australia."

  "text" : "Michael Daley [sometimes Michael Daly] (1865–1910) was a boxer from Bangor, Maine who held the lightweight title for New England in the late nineteenth century, and was a claimant for the lightweight title of America in 1893. In 1903, however, Daley was convicted, along with world middle-weight champion George La Blanche of robbing a drunken man in a Bangor hotel and sentenced to two years imprisonment. According to the New York Times Daley was from a 'highly respectable' family. Daley fought and defeated Marcellus Baker of Boston in 1884. The New England lightweight championship had been bestowed on him by 1887, when the VC Club of Gardiner, Maine awarded him a belt emblazoned with the title after an exhibition fight with another Bangor boxer, James Mehan. In 1889 Daley went fifteen rounds in Boston with another boxer formerly from Bangor, Jack McAuliffe, 'The Napoleon of the Ring', who finished his career undefeated. Daley survived with a technical draw. In 1892 Daley was undefeated, and by 1893, was claiming the title of lightweight champion of America. But he had to fight for the title that year against Austin Gibbons, at the Crescent City Club in New Orleans. The contest was a grueling one, and Daley's longest, and ended in his knock-out in the thirty-first round. In 1899 Daley bought the former Elk's Lodge in Bangor and fitted it out as a boxing academy. Daley died in a Bangor jail cell while under arrest for another crime in 1910. He had opened a new boxing club earlier that same year."

In 2005, Theiss captured the highest storm surge on video during Hurricane Katrina in Gulfport, Mississippi. This video premiered exclusively on NBC's Today Show where Matt Lauer dubbed Mike's video as the \"scariest video\" to come out of Katrina. This video is currently being considered for Guinness World Records for the highest storm surge ever caught on camera.

She also toured in Canada, the United States, Russia, the Netherlands, and England. After the 1907 winter season, a shipwreck cost many of the opera company their lives and made her decide never to tour overseas again. Nast specialized in light and soubrette roles, especially Mozart, and she created the part of Sophie in Der Rosenkavalier in 1911. Her clear tone and lack of continuous vibrato were echoed by other sopranos of the period. She made some recordings which indicate high technical accomplishment, including her part in the trio from Der Rosenkavalier. She also sang the part of Micaëla in the first recording of Carmen. Nast died in Füssen."

  "text" : "Mikko Viitanen (born February 18, 1982) is a Finnish former professional ice hockey defenceman who most notably played in the Finnish Liiga. He was drafted 149th overall by the Colorado Avalanche in the 2001 NHL Entry Draft. Viitanen previously played seven seasons with JYP, joining from fellow Liiga club Lukko Rauma in 2009. On April 23, 2015, Viitanen joined his fourth Finnish Liiga club, in agreeing to a two-year contract with Ässät Pori. Viitanen appeared in 32 games for 5 points in the 2015–16 season.

In April 1640, Oldisworth was elected MP for Salisbury in the Short Parliament. In November 1640 he was returned as MP for Salisbury and Plympton Erle and chose to sit for Salisbury. His patron was a puritan and had broken with the King, and Oldisworth continued to support the parliamentarian cause. He was appointed keeper of Windsor Great Park in 1650 and master of the prerogative office. He was satirised by royalist pamphleteers and praised by Herrick.

  "text" : "Martin Roy (Marty) Wood is a celebrated rodeo cowboy from Bowness, Calgary, in the province of Alberta, Canada. Marty was born in 1933 in Carstairs, Alberta, to Dorothy and Harry Wood. His great grandfather was Henry Wise Wood, the founding president of the United Farmers of Alberta, who had settled in Carstairs in 1905. Marty's family moved to Bowness, then a small hamlet just outside Calgary, in 1940 or 1941, and he attended school there. His parents built a house and opened the Wood's Riding Academy, where Marty learned to break, ride and show horses. He took up rodeo in the early 1950s and soon specialized in Saddle broncs. He won his first professional rodeo championship in Omaha, Nebraska, in 1953. During the fifties and sixties, Wood was one of the best Saddle Bronc riders in the United States and Canada, winning at all the major rodeos and, when he didn't win outright, often coming in a close second. He was Canadian Champion Saddle Bronc Rider in 1954, 1955 and 1963, World Champion in 1958, 1964 and 1966, and won the Calgary Stampede a total of five times, in 1954, 1957, 1961, 1964 and 1965. He also won at the Cheyenne, MadisonSquare Garden, San Francisco Cow Palace, Fort Worth, Houston, Salinas, Boston Garden, and Oklahoma City rodeos. Wood was married to Jean Routh in the 1950s and the couple had one son, Chip. He was divorced in the late 1960s. During his career, Wood suffered many injuries, including seven broken legs, fractures of both feet and ankles, broken ribs and a broken collarbone. Because of the cumulative effect of his injuries, he retired in 1974, going on to train quarter and thoroughbred horses for racing and jumping. Marty Wood was inducted into the ProRodeo Hall of Fame in 1991, the Canadian Pro Rodeo Hall of Fame and the Alberta Sports Hall of Fame in 1994, the Ellensburg Rodeo Hall of Fame in 2004, and the National Cowboy & Western Heritage Museum Rodeo Hall of Fame in 2008. He now lives in Pendleton, Oregon."

He is on the list of the 100 most important leaders in Library and Information Science of the 20th century. He was important to the Library Science field because he invented Coordinate Indexing, which uses “uniterms” in the context of cataloging. It is the forerunner to computer based searches. In the early 1950s he started his own company, Documentation, Inc. with Gerald J. Sophar. Previously he worked at such institutions as the Library of Congress, the Department of Defense, and the Atomic Energy Commission. American Libraries calls him “an innovator and inventor, as well as scholar and savvy businessman.” Current Biography called him the “Dewey of mid-twentieth Librarianship.” Mortimer Taube was a very active man with varying interests such as tennis, philosophy, sailing, music, and collecting paintings."

  "text" : "Mark Rowntree is a British spree killer who was committed to a mental hospital after he admitted killing four people at random in the town of Bingley, West Yorkshire, during late 1975 and early 1976. Due to the timing of his spree, some of his victims were erroneously assumed to have been killed by the yorkshire ripper, which distracted police enquiries at the time. On 31 December 1975, 19-year-old Rowntree stabbed widow Grace Adamson to death, then celebrated with a beer at the local pub. Four days later on 3 January 1976 he killed sixteen-year-old Stephen Wilson at a bus stop in Eastburn, West Yorkshire. The victim died in hospital, although he was first able to give a description of his attacker to the police. On 7 January 1976, Rowntree visited part-time model Barbara Booth at her home and stabbed her to death, along with her three-year-old son Alan. By the time he returned home, the police were waiting for him, armed with the description given by the second victim. Rowntree gave a full confession to his crimes and complained that he had not managed to reach five victims — the body count of his hero, Donald Neilson. Diagnosed as suffering from schizophrenia, Rowntree pleaded guilty to four counts of manslaughter on the ground of diminished responsibility at Leeds Crown Court in June 1976. He was ordered to be committed to Rampton Secure Hospital for an indefinite period, but is now based at the Hutton Unit, a secure mental health facility based at St. Luke's Hospital in Middlesbrough. He is now one of the longest serving patients in any British psychiatric/secure hospital."

  "text" : "Allen LaGrant \"Mickey\" Bowers (born February 27, 1949, at Maxton, North Carolina) is a retired American professional baseball player, scout, coach and manager whose entire uniformed career took place in minor league baseball. An outfielder, Bowers threw and batted right-handed, stood 5 feet 10 inches (1.78 m) tall and weighed 175 pounds (79 kg). Bowers graduated from Mount Vernon High School (Alexandria, Virginia) and attended Northern Virginia College. He entered professional baseball in 1968 in the Philadelphia Phillies' organization and in his finest season, 1969, he batted .308 with 124 hits, 10 home runs and 73 runs batted in in 106 games played for the Spartanburg Phillies of the Class A Western Carolinas League. However, his career was highlighted by an incident in his first game as a professional in the Short Season-A Northern League. On July 4, 1968, Bowers, playing right field for the Huron Phillies, ran through an outfield fence while chasing a foul fly ball. He emerged from the hole in the fence unhurt — although he did not make the catch. He retired as an active player after the 1970 season and then served six years as a police officer in Washington, D.C., before returning to baseball as a member of the Major League Baseball Scouting Bureau. In 1978, Bowers became a coach in the Seattle Mariners' farm system. After two seasons (1980–81) as a coach with the Lynn Sailors of the Double-A Eastern League, Bowers managed the 1982 Sailors to an 82–57 mark and the North Division title. His players included future Major Leaguers Alvin Davis, Jim Presley and Harold Reynolds. Seattle moved its Double-A affiliate the following year to the Chattanooga Lookouts of the Southern League. Bowers was replaced as skipper in midseason as the Lookouts finished below .500, despite contributions from future MLB stars Ivan Calderón, Darnell Coles, Mark Langston and Danny Tartabull."

Although regarded as a pioneer of Congolese mycology, he never travelled to Africa. Between 1920 and 1940, he published nearly 30 works about African mushrooms that were kept at the botanical garden, with 11 of the articles being printed in the journal \"Fungi Goossensiani\". He initiated work on the \"Flore iconographique des champignons du Congo\", precursor to the \"Flore illustrée des champignons d’Afrique centrale\", a major regional work. As a taxonomist, he circumscribed the genus Meliolinopsis (synonym Meliolaster)."

He joined the Amadeus Quartet at the age of 19, in 1947. They remained together for 40 years, until the death of violist Peter Schidlof in 1987, when they decided to disband. Since the end of the Amadeus Quartet, Martin Lovett has been much in demand for performances with various chamber music groups including the Amadeus Ensemble. He gives chamber music courses all over the world. The Amadeus Summer Course, held each year at the Royal Academy of Music in London, is a highlight of this activity. A fellow of the Royal Society of Arts, he also acts as a judge in many international chamber music competitions."

He occasionally made some runs, but his highest first-class score was only 35, made in the match against Lancashire in 1905. His bowling style is not recorded and he took only one first-class wicket. Before and after the First World War he played club cricket in London for Hampstead. Sturt joined the Army Service Corps at the start of the First World War as a lieutenant. In the New Year Honours of 1918, he was awarded the Distinguished Service Order and at this stage he was a temporary major within the ASC."

He has regularly argued for enabling the private sector to bring about economic development rather than direct aid to the poorest nations. In a paper he co-authored in 2005, Klein says: \"Private financial flows such as foreign direct investment seem to encourage economic growth and relieve poverty in part because they create excellent incentives for transferring know-how and in part because they are subject to a stern market test that ensures they are allocated and monitored carefully. For aid flows, not automatically subject to these disciplines, it is difficult to be as effective. This Note argues that aid agencies, by learning what makes private flows so effective, can bring better aid to the poorest.\""

However, when Bernhard died in 1346 without issue, Margaret became the heiress of Ravensberg, her elder sister and only sibling, Hedwig, having died in 1336. Then, when Margaret's uncle, Adolf IX of Berg, died in 1348 without issue, Margaret also inherited Berg by right of her mother, since Margaret was Adolf's only surviving niece. As a result of her marriage to Gerhard VI of Jülich, Berg and Ravensberg passed into the house of Jülich where they remained until 1511 when they passed into the house of Cleves."

  "text" : "Mersher Miller, commonly known as Mersher The Strong Arm, (fl. 1900–1912) was an American saloon keeper and underworld figure in New York's Lower East Side at the start of the 20th century. Owner of a popular Norfolk Street beer house, his bar was later the scene of a gun battle when Johnny Spanish attempted to rob the bar and its patrons. In April 1912, Spanish entered the bar and approached Miller's brother who was acting as bartender for the night. Spanish asked where Miller was, his brother said he had left for the day and Spanish demanded $10 from the till. When Miller's brother refused, Spanish left saying he would return later that night. Believing like most of the city that Spanish had fled New York and was in hiding from the police and Kid Dropper, Miller's brother was unaware of his identity and was informed by a patron who suggested he arm himself before the gangster's return. Indeed as promised, Spanish returned with another man and proceeded to shoot up the place, shattering a large mirror over the bar and robbing the till as well as the remaining customers. Not only did Spanish receive the $10 he originally demanded but took the rest of the nights taking as well amounting to $80. He then turned to Mersher's brother supposedly saying \"Now I might as well cook you. I've no use for barkeeps anyway, 'an besides you're built like a pig and I don't like your looks.\" He then began firing, Mersher's brother ducking and dodging as he ran all the way to the end bar, and then Spanish left the bar with his partner. Mersher's brother emerged unscathed from under the bar after Spanish had left, police later finding two bullet holes in the ice box, two through the mirror and five in the top of the bar. This feat greatly enhanced Spanish's reputation in the underworld although he was identified by a bystander and eventually arrested for the robbery."

A graduate of University of Notre Dame with a Bachelor of Science in Microbiology. Mike went on to University of California, Berkeley for his advanced degree in Microbiology. Mike had access to the department's computer and since the administrator of that PDP-11 did not have enough time, Mike started helping him and then making changes to the system.Mike started his contribution to Unix with the 2.9BSD release, distributed for the PDP-11.When Mike saw a job posting with the Computer Systems Research Group in the BSD project, he decided to jump in.In 1982, Mike took over Bill Joy's responsibilities when Mr. Joy left CSRG, and was the system architect for 4.3BSD, the most important BSD release and the base of the development for a number of commercial Unix flavors available today, including Solaris. This release was introduced to the world in deep detail through the all-time famous book, The Design and Implementation of the 4.3BSD UNIX Operating System, with black cover and smiling beastie. Mike was a CSRG principal programmer for 8 years. Mike worked closely with Van Jacobson on a number of widely accepted algorithmsin TCP implementation. Including the Jacobson/Karels algorithm TCP slow start and the routing radix tree are probably the most famous ones.Mike spends little time taking credit for this work, and on the other hand, uses every opportunity to mention the names of people who had in one way or other some role or contribution to the TCP/IP implementation in Unix. In 1993, the USENIX Association gave a Lifetime Achievement Award (Flame) to the Computer Systems Research Group at University of California, Berkeley, honoring 180 individuals, including Karels, who contributed to the CSRG's 4.4BSD-Lite release. Later, Mike moved to BSDi (Berkeley Software Design) and designed BSD/OS, which was, for years, the only commercially available BSD style Unix on Intel platform. BSD/OS is a very reliable OS platform designed for Internet services. BSDi software asset was bought by Wind River in April 2001, and Mike joined Wind River as the Principal Technologist for the BSD/OS platform. In 2009, Mike was Sr Principal Engineer at McAfee. In 2015 he worked for Intel and later for Forcepoint LLC."

Chizhov was born the son of a peasant mason on November 10, 1838 in the village of Pudov in the Podolsky District of Moscow Oblast. Chizhov's father had a small workshop and made tombstones for the Moscow German cemetery. Even as a small boy Chizhov made clay figurines of animals, and from the age of eleven he helped his father in his work. Chizhov studied at Moscow's German School of St. Michael, then attended the Stroganov School of Technical Drawing where he learned sculpting under the guidance of Brovskogo. Brovskogo recommended him to Nikolai Alexandrovich Ramazanov, a professor at the Moscow School of Painting, Sculpture and Architecture, and advised Ramazanov to take the talented young man into the institution. There, Chizhov began to systematically study sculpture and quickly showed his adeptness. In 1858, he fashioned a high relief sculpture, \"Champions\", for which the school awarded him a silver medal. Another high relief, \"Agony of the Saviour\", also won Chizhov a silver medal. Ramazanov took on Chizhov as his assistant in the execution of works for the Cathedral of Christ the Saviour in Moscow. Chizhov, working from the drawings and sketches of his mentor, produced for the cathedral the huge high relief sculpture \"\"Christ's Descent into Hell\". He also produced for two other Moscow churches the high reliefs \"Assumption\" and \"Saint Nicholas\". Chizhov was soon invited by Mikhail Mikeshin to participate in the project to create \"Millennium of Russia\", a large monument erected in Novgorod in 1863. Chizhov created the high relief figures \"Heroes\", \"Enlightenment\", and \"Statesmen\" for this monument. Chizhov moved to St. Petersburg, where in 1863 he enrolled in the Imperial Academy of Arts, where he studied under Peter Klodt and Nikolai Pimenov. Chizhov soon won two silver medals for sculpting from life and a small gold medal in 1865 for \"Kievan riding with a bridle in his hands through the camp of the Pechenegs\", a bronze copy of which exists at the Russian Museum in Petersburg. Chizhov's studies did not prevent him from performing a variety of private commissions and work for Mikeshin, including drawings for a model of the St. Petersburg monument to Catherine the Great and the fashioning of parts of this colossal monument to the empress. Chizhov was graduated from the Academy in 1867 with the title of Expert Artist of the First Degree and a large gold medal earned for a high relief of Christ's resurrection, copies of which are now located at the Academy and in the Russian Museum. He then traveled in Europe, visiting several cities in Germany, Austria, and Italy before settling in Rome, where he spent six years in continuous work. Of the numerous works executed by Chizhov during this period, the most noteworthy are: \n* \"The game of hide and seek\" (at the Russian Museum) \n* \"First love\" \n* \"The unfortunate peasant\" (at the Moscow Public Museum) \n* \"Frolicsome girl\", a graceful figure of a girl crossing a stream on a log (many copies were made of this popular sculpture; one is at Livadia Palace) All of these works were exhibited in St. Petersburg. The first two earned the artist, in 1873, the title of Academician. \"The unfortunate peasant\" earned, in 1874, a gold medal established by the Academy by the bequest of A. Rzhevsk and N. Demidov. \"Frolicsome girl\" won the Le Brun gold medal, third class, at the 1878 Paris World's Fair. Back in St. Petersburg in 1875, Chizhov taught sculpture at the Saint Petersburg Art and Industry Academy and was appointed as a sculptor and art restorer at the Hermitage. In 1893 he was made a member of the Academy of Fine Arts. In addition to the works already mentioned, some of Chizov's major works include: \n* Busts of the Emperor Alexander II, created for the Kharkov Court of Justice and for the County Council of Perm. \n* Busts of Prince Peter Oldenburg (in the Imperial School of Jurisprudence) and of Mikhail Glinka (in the foyer of the Mariinsky Theater in St. Petersburg). \n* Busts of the artist Alexei Bogolyubov and F. G. Gromov (in Saint Petersburg Art and Industry Academy) and Nikolay Nekrasov (in the cemetery of the Novodevichy Convent in St. Petersburg). \n* A colossal statue of Ludwig Knoop in his monument at his Krenholm Manufacturing Company's factory in Kreenholm. \n* A great bust of Alexander II and decorations on the pedestal for the monument the emperor in Kalisz. \n* A large statue of Emperor Nicholas I for his monument in Kiev. \n* A monument to Admiral Pavel Nakhimov in Simferopol. \n* A monument to Count Mikhail Vilensky in Vilna. \n* A monument to Catherine the Great in Odessa. \n* Figure-group sculptures: \"At the well\", \"The reading lesson\", and others. Chizhov died on May 28, 1916, in Petrograd."

Patrick was primary sports anchor for WISH-TV from 1990 to 1998. Patrick also provided a number of voice characterizations on The Bob and Tom Show for many years beginning in the late '80s. His characters included a fictional traffic reporter named \"T.C.\" and impressions of Howard Cosell, Harry Caray, and Marge Schott. The Harry Caray character had a recurring skit called \"After Hours Sports with Harry Caray\" where \"Harry\" would interview various celebrities. After the real Harry Caray died in 1998, the skit was renamed \"After Life Sports with Harry Caray\" so that Patrick could continue his comic impression as the ghost of Harry Caray. Patrick graduated from Brownsburg High School in 1977, and then attended Ball State University where he played basketball. Patrick married Pam Nelson and they have two children; son Drew Storen is a Major League Baseball pitcher for the Seattle Mariners.

  "text" : "Michael Steven Park (22 June 1966 – 18 September 2005) was a rally co-driver from Newent in Gloucestershire. One of the top co-drivers of his generation, Park died as a result of injuries sustained in an accident on the final leg of Wales Rally Great Britain when his Peugeot 307 WRC left the road and struck a tree. As co-driver to Markko Märtin, 'Beef', as he was affectionately known, enjoyed considerable success with the Estonian during three seasons at Ford before joining Peugeot for 2005. A rally enthusiast since the age of ten, he gained experience with some of Britain's top talents. He worked with former world champions Richard Burns and Colin McRae as a gravel note expert while co-driving for both David Higgins and Mark Higgins in the British national series. His big break, however, came when he teamed up with the emerging Estonian talent Markko Märtin as a privateer pairing in a Toyota Corolla WRC for the 2000 World Rally Championship season. After a string of impressive performances, the pair were signed up by Subaru for 2001, before moving to Ford, where they evolved into one of the leading driver/co-driver combinations in the WRC. In 2003, they took two rally victories, in Greece and Finland, and improved on that figure with three wins in 2004 (Mexico, Corsica and Catalunya). Perhaps known best for his keen sense of humour and his distinctive St George's Cross helmet, 'Beef' Park became a fan favourite, especially in his native England and (nearly-adopted) Estonia. His driver Markko Märtin once joked that he gave him a \"9/10\" - lacking one point only because he didn't speak Estonian. After the crash, an emotional Markko said \"Park wasn't my co-driver, I was his pilot.\" The pair were lying fourth in the 2005 season's title race after securing four podiums in a season dominated by Citroën's Sébastien Loeb when the accident occurred. Their performances had been instrumental in Peugeot's challenge for the manufacturer's championship, with the team lying six points behind French rivals Citroën. Park is survived by his wife Marie and children William and Victoria. His death, the first top-level rallying fatality since Rodger Freeth in the 1993 Rally Australia, brought renewed attention to safety issues in the motorsport world. On 20 June 2006, a memorial for Park was unveiled in Tallinn, Estonia."

  "text" : "Michael \"Babs\" Keating (born 17 April 1944) is an Irish retired hurler and Gaelic footballer who played as a forward for the Tipperary senior teams. Born in Ardfinnan, County Tipperary, Keating first excelled at Gaelic games during his schooling at CBS High School Clonmel. He arrived on the inter-county scene at the age of sixteen when he first linked up with the Tipperary minor teams in both codes, before later joining the under-21 sides. He joined the senior football panel during the 1960 championship before being added to the senior hurling panel four years later. Keating was a regular member of the starting fifteen on both teams, and won two All-Ireland medals, four Munster medals and two National Hurling League medals. He was an All-Ireland runner-up on two occasions. As a member of both Munster inter-provincial teams on a number of occasions, Keating won a combined total of three Railway Cup medals. At club level he was a five-time football championship medallist with Ardfinnan. Keating played his club hurling with Ballybacon-Grange. Throughout his career Keating made 27 championship appearances with the senior hurlers. He retired from inter-county hurling following the conclusion of the 1975 championship, however, his inter-county football career lasted until the end of the 1980 championship. Keating is widely regarded one of the greatest players of his generation. In 1971 he was named on the inaugural All-Star team, while he also collected the Texaco Hurler of the Year award. Delaney was also chosen as one of the 125 greatest hurlers of all-time in a 2009 poll. In retirement from playing Keating became involved in team management and coaching. At various times he has served as manager of the Galway, Offaly and Laois senior teams, however, it has been with his own native Tipperary that he enjoyed his greatest success, guiding the team to two All-Ireland victories."

  "text" : "Jaidyn Raymond Leskie (30 April 1996 – 15 June 1997) was the Australian child of Bilynda Williams and Brett Leskie, kidnapped and murdered in 1997. Despite leads, and the arrest and trial of a prime suspect, Leskie's murder remains unsolved. Although the decision was made in 2002 not to hold an inquest into the toddler's death, the case remained in the news for several more years and an inquest was held in 2006 implicating the mother's boyfriend, Greg Domaszewicz, who at the time of the kidnapping was babysitting the boy at his house at Newborough. The circumstances of Leskie's disappearance and death were never clear, and were complicated by a pig's head being thrown at the house and other vandalism on the evening of the toddler's disappearance, an alleged prank about the boy's fate and the body not being discovered until January 1998. Leskie is believed to have died of head injuries. After a missing person's search, believed to have been the largest since the disappearance of Prime Minister Harold Holt in 1967, Jaidyn's body was found on 1 January 1998 at Blue Rock Dam, 18 km north of Moe. His body had been preserved by the cold waters of the lake through winter and the clothing he was wearing was subject to a DNA test in an effort to solve the crime. Greg Domaszewicz was charged with murder but was found not guilty in December 1998. A controversial 2006 inquest, which alleged Domaszewicz's lawyer claimed to have been media driven, found that he had contributed to the toddler's death and had likely disposed of the boy's body. The inability to move forward with what some believe to be new evidence due to the double jeopardy laws in place in Victoria have led Leskie's mother to join a coalition asking for reform of these laws. Almost ten years after Leskie's death, a kit on helping parents choose adequate babysitters was released in his memory."

Born as a princess into a palace life which she lovingly recalled in a series of late essays, she made her name in the wider world as a novelist and a writer of short stories, essays, plays and award-winning screenplays, lyrics and ballet scripts. She received the Padma Shri in 1976, one of India's highest civilian awards, followed by Sahitya Akademi Award given by Sahitya Akademi, India's National Academy of letters) in 1979 for her novel Boro Saheb Ongbi Sanatombi (The Princess and the Political Agent) based on the true life story of a Manipuri princess, daughter of Maharaj Surchandra Singh. However, she returned the Padma Shri to protest the alleged rape and killing of Thangjam Manorama by 17 Assam Rifles personnel in 2004. M. K. Binodini Devi wrote under the single name of Binodini. Her screenplays were made into award-winning feature films, directed by her long-time collaborator director Aribam Syam Sharma, such as My Son, My Precious, 1982; The Chosen One (1990), that have also been screened in the London Film Festival as well as the Museum of Modern Art, and Cannes, Toronto and Locarno Film Festivals. Her wildlife and environment themed script for a modern ballet was made into Sangai – Dancing Deer of Manipur, a performance film that won the British Film Institute's Outstanding Film of the Year Award in 1984. She died at 8:04 pm at her Yaiskul Police Lane residence in Imphal on 17 January 2011. She is survived by her two sons. This article seems to be a duplicate of another article"

  "text" : "Marco Ruffo as known as Marco Fryazin (Марк Фрязин, Марко Фрязин and Марко Руффо in Russian) was an Italian architect active in Moscow in the 15th century. The Fryazin title originates from the old Russian word фрязь (fryaz), derived from frank, that was used to denote people from Northern Italy. Beside Marco Ruffo, at least three contemporary Italians had this nickname in Russia: Antonio Fryazin (Antonio Gislardi), Bon Fryazin (Marco Bon), Aleviz Fryazin (Aloisio da Milano). One of the chronicles says that Marco Ruffo worked in Moscow in 1485–1495 at the invitation of Ivan III. He built a number of the Kremlin towers, including the Beklemishevskaya, Spasskaya and Nikolskaya towers. In 1491, together with Pietro Antonio Solari, Marco Ruffo finished the construction of the Palace of Facets. In December 1991, in Moscow, UNESCO celebrated Palace of Facets' 500th jubilee."

  "text" : "Moses Asch (December 2, 1905 – October 19, 1986), often known as Moe Asch, was a Polish-American recording engineer and record executive. He founded Asch Records, which then changed its name to Folkways Records when the label transitioned from 78 RPM recordings to LP records. Asch ran the Folkways label from 1948 until his death in 1986. Folkways was very influential in bringing folk music into the American cultural mainstream. Some of America's greatest folk songs were originally recorded for Asch, including \"This Land Is Your Land\" by Woody Guthrie and \"Goodnight Irene\" by Lead Belly. Asch sold many commercial recordings to Verve Records; after his death, Asch's archive of ethnic recordings was acquired by the Smithsonian Institution, and released as Smithsonian Folkways Records."

His two brothers are also influential politicians; older brother Hadjiman \"Jim\" Hataman is the representative from the lone district of Basilan, and younger brother \"Boy\" Hataman was previously mayor of Sumisip. Together, the Hataman brothers constitute a powerful political bloc in Basilan. Former Lamitan mayor Roderick Furigay is considered one of their allies. Gerry Salapuddin was also an ally, but they may have had a falling out after the accusations associated with the Akbar assassination."

  "text" : "Michael Davie (15 January 1924 Cranleigh, Surrey – 7 December 2005, Ewelme, Oxfordshire) was a British journalist. Davie was the last of three children born to the head of a firm of stockbrokers. He was educated at Haileybury and Merton College, Oxford, where he began reading English, but after war service in the Royal Navy, returned to study History. Before he graduated, Davie was offered a job as diplomatic correspondent by David Astor, editor of The Observer, but the post had been filled by the time he had left Oxford University. After a brief period at the Manchester Evening News, he joined The Observer in 1950 as religious correspondent. Davie subsequently became the newspaper's news editor, sports writer and editor of the colour supplement when it was first published in 1965. Close to Astor, he was appointed deputy editor of the newspaper, a position he retained until 1969. He then returned to writing, still on The Observer staff, where he edited the 'Notebook' feature. Davie was the editor of the diaries of novelist Evelyn Waugh; the volume appeared in 1976. That year he won the What the Papers Say 'Journalist of the Year' Award. In 1977, he settled in Melbourne, Australia, where he became Associate Editor of The Age, becoming the newspaper's editor in 1979, a post he retained until returning to London and The Observer in 1981 for the remainder of his career. Davie retired in 1988. Following his retirement, he wrote a biography of the press baron Lord Beaverbrook with his wife which was published in 1992. His other books include a study of President Lyndon B. Johnson LBJ (1966); In the Future Now (1972), an account of sun-rise industries in California; The Titanic (1986) and (with his son Simon) The Faber Book of Cricket (1987). His final completed book was Anglo-Australian Attitudes published in 2000. Michael Davie married twice, his wife from 1975 was the writer and journalist Anne Chisholm. With his first wife (Robin Atherton) he had a son and two daughters, and an adopted son (who predeceased him) with his second."

Though predominantly based in Milan and appearing in productions staged at La Scala, Mina also travelled internationally with her work, including appearances in Bluff King Hal – a romantic opera by American composer Humphrey John Stewart, based on King Henry VIII – in 1914. Mina is a featured as a sitter in five photographic portraits by renowned British-Italian high society photographer Alexander Bassano. Bassano had also famously photographed Queen Victoria and Lord Kitchener, the portrait of whom created the First World war recruiting poster Your Country Needs You. The photographic plates featuring Mina Leonesi from the London Bassano Studios, are held in the National Portrait Gallery, London. The National Portrait Gallery holds a large number of the fashion-related plates; Mina was noted for her beauty, and her operatic roles in historical costume were very fashionable for the period. Mina had two children, a son (Anthony) and daughter (Antoinette). Mina died in Italy soon after her daughter, Antoinette, died of pneumonia."

In a Frieze review, Morgan Falconer describes Lopez's work as \"All of these objects are marvelously poised between being one strange thing and something stranger still.\" Michael Wilson of Artforum reviewed Blue Angels when the series appeared at Simon Preston Gallery in New York: “Turning Minimalist form against itself is hardly a new idea-one might even consider, it a genre unto itself- but it still offers room for maneuver. In Vertical Neck, her second solo exhibition at Simon Preston, Brooklyn-based artist Michelle Lopez presented a strong, clean suite of five new sculptures that capitalize on the movement’s enduring legacy but sidestep parody and polemic to arrive at a more subtly allusive language.... Three roughly folded and heavily crumpled sheets of aluminum lean against the wall and tower above head height, their interiors painted blue or black, their exteriors white or colorlessly reflective.The suggestion that attempts at formal perfection are necessarily doomed to failure is clear, but in their fun- house-mirror distortions, these works direct that argument at not only artistic folly but also the viewer’s own vanities and imperfections. Still, the news isn’t all bad; there’s an insinuation in the aluminum’s shiny. paper- like surfaces of gift wrap, a hint of celebration and renewal.... [T]here is a hint of nose-thumbing at the consistent anality of the Guys, but Lopez’s remake is more understated, more extensive, more radical-and a lot more appealing-than that might imply.” (Artforum, November 2011) Lopez first gained critical attention with her sculpture Boy; a leather covered Honda that made its debut in 2000 as part of P.S.1 / MoMA’s Greater New York exhibition. Her work examines cultural phenomena related to fanaticism, violence, and questions of identity. Lopez' artistic process looks at post 9/11 experience and its abject residue on the sculptural object. Such forlorn themes can be found in \"Blue Angels\", \"The Year We Made Contact\", \"Strange Fruit\", \"Banner Year\". Lopez also examines iconography of \"power\" through installation of sound and animation. In her most recent work, Smoke Clouds, Lopez explores themes of disappearance, through the shifting image within the material of silver nitrate (mirroring solution) poured onto large-scale architectural glass. Lopez' mirrored smoke clouds reflect the room and the viewer through the original photographic process of silver tinning. The cloud image appears and disappears as a \"puff of smoke\" depending on the environment and the viewers position in the room. Lopez questions the status of the object and the artistic desire to make iconography, while also questioning the viewer's desire to claim it. Lopez is currently on the faculty at Yale School of Art in the Department of Sculpture."

  "text" : "Michael J. Wytrwal (12 September 1882 in Kraków, Poland – 21 January 1970) was one of the successful businessmen and entrepreneurs of the early 1900s in Amsterdam, New York. He was actively engaged in managing a diversified portfolio of business interests that serve as the precursor to today's conglomerate. These interests include real estate, pharmaceuticals, furniture, timber holdings, insurance, contracting, consumer goods, banking and financial services, textiles, and energy via the M. J. Wytrwal Coal & Oil Company in upstate New York. At the age of 14, Wytrwal immigrated to the United States through Ellis Island, and moved to Amsterdam, a city located in Montgomery County, New York, just in time for the initial stellar growth of the booming textile, carpet and rug-making industries, powered by the rushing waters of the Chuctenunda Creek into the Mohawk River. These textile mills, run by the Sanfords, Bigelows, Shuttleworths and others, employed thousands of new immigrants, made superior floor covering products, and generated tremendous wealth for their shareholders. They were the building blocks of what is now known as Mohawk Industries of Calhoun, Georgia. This wealth generation and concentration in a small city of upstate New York resulted in the Fulton-Montgomery County region having the largest number of millionaires on a per capita basis in the U.S. during the early 1900s. Wytrwal was one of the founding members and initial investors in forming the Amsterdam Federal Savings and Loan Association, a privately owned bank also known as the “Polish Bank” on Church Street. Many years later, the bank conducted an initial public offering and went public under the ticker symbol AFED, (Amsterdam Federal Savings) on October 1, 1996. AFED later merged with Amsterdam Savings Bank to form Mohawk Community Bank, which was later acquired by Hudson River Bank & Trust, and is now part of First Niagara Financial Group, a US$21 billion bank based in Buffalo, New York. He was widely recognized as one of the leading and prosperous merchants of Amsterdam and enjoyed and “unassailable reputation for integrity and reliability”. Wytrwal was actively in engaged in federal, state and local politics and assisted President Franklin D. Roosevelt in implementing various economic relief programs during the Great Depression of the 1930s and was known as the “Polish Mayor” of Amsterdam."

On 11 March 1505, Dall'Aquila also received a grant for a petition where he claimed to have developed a method of printing tablature which he could use to score any lute composition into tablature. In the petition for the grant, he also asked for a ban on other printing methods and imports of music scored by other methods, and for a portion of penalties paid for infringement. However, no printed editions demonstrating his method survive."

  "text" : "Melaku Worede was born in Ethiopia in 1936. After obtaining a PhD in Agronomy (Genetics and Breeding) from the University of Nebraska, he returned to Ethiopia and became involved in the planning of the Plant Genetic Resources Centre in Addis Ababa, of which he became Director in 1979. He held this post until his retirement in 1993 to join the Seeds of Survival Programme of Ethiopia, which he founded with the support of a consortium of Canadian NGOs led by the Unitarian Service Committee (USC/Canada). Melaku Worede was awarded the Right Livelihood Award in 1989. Ethiopia is one of the world's eight 'Vavilov Centres' noted for their great genetic diversity. It is this bio-diversity - now under great threat from drought and modern farming methods - that Worede has sought to preserve. Further, the Plant Genetic Resources Centre (PGRC) set out to establish 'Strategic Seed Reserves' of traditional varieties that could be released to farmers for planting in times of drought when no other seeds were likely to thrive. In only a few years, Worede and his staff collected and safely stored a considerable amount of Ethiopia's genetic wealth. In the process, he established not only Africa's finest facility of its kind, but also one of the world's premier genetic conservation systems. Worede built this institution exclusively with Ethiopian staff, training a whole new generation of plant breeders and geneticists in his home country.Worede retired from government service to continue and develop his pioneer work on a farming-based native seed (landrace) conservation, enhancement and utilisation. Growing without commercial fertilisers or other chemicals, the locally adapted native seeds developed in this way (e.g. durum wheat) have been shown to exceed their high-input counterparts on the average by 10-15% and the original farmers' cultivars by 20-25% in yield. Worede has been active in the training of several gene bank curators and many other young scientists. Several initiatives to support biodiversity conservation and utilisation in Africa take the Ethiopian experience as their model, and are thus attributable to Worede's ground-breaking work. Also very active at the international level, Worede was the first Chair of the African Committee for Plant and Genetic Resources, and has been instrumental in the setting up of the African Biodiversity Network. He has served as Chair of the UN Food and Agriculture Organization's Commission on Plant Genetic Resources, and is currently a Board member of (among others) the International Plant Genetic Resources Institute (IPGRI) and the Rural Advancement Foundation International (RAFI). In 2008 the National Green Award Foundation, headed by the Ethiopian president, gave Worede the Outstanding International Contribution Award. Dr Melaku features in the film Seeds of Freedom which was released in June 2012, and features narration from Oscar-winning actor Jeremy Irons. The film was produced by The Gaia Foundation and the African Biodiversity Network, both organisations with whom Dr Melaku has been a long term ally and worked alongside to lead a number of trainings with Field Officers working across Africa."

She became inspired to record the disappearing folk tales after reading Algonquin Legends of New England, beginning a correspondence with Charles Godfrey Leland. Her earliest publication was Old Rabbit the Voodoo, and other Sorcerers, printed with an introduction by Leland, which was favourably reviewed in the English journal Folk-Lore; the reviewer, E. S. Hartland, dismisses Leland's request for consideration as a first work and says of it, \"[f]rom the first page to the last there is not a dull page...\". Her researches and fieldwork had already been reported in a paper she read before the 1891 \"Second International Folk-Congress\" in London, which was printed in the Transactions of the conference as \"Among the Voodoos\".Her principal work was Voodoo tales as told among the Negroes of the southwest,Owen gave long service to The Missouri Folklore Society, serving as its President until the year of her death. Owen also published articles in Century Magazine and Overland Monthly, writing as Julia Scott, and contributed reviews and journalism to other periodicals."

  "text" : "Maude Cary (1878–1967) was a Christian American missionary to North Africa, specifically Morocco. She was raised knowing she would one day be a missionary because her parents often housed missionaries as they were passing through. Her parents understood the work they were doing as very important and passed this belief onto their daughter. As soon as she was eighteen, Maude signed herself up for an American missionary training school, Avant Ministries (GMU). After completing this schooling and doing some missions work within American inner cities, Maude was accepted to travel with the GMU to serve alongside a few struggling Christian missionaries in Morocco. For the next fifty years of her life Maude Cary would minister to the rich and poor Muslims within Morocco attempting to bring them the Gospel message her school and parents had taught her. A difficult start made Maude question her efffectivness in Morocco but she trusted that there would eventually be conversions from Islam to Christianity and stayed until she was too ill to serve. Becoming very ill she flew back to America for treatment and as soon as possible returned to continue her life living among the Muslims. Through the difficult start and her illness, Maude Cary became a Christian leader within Morocco for the Gospel Mission Union in charge of translation and Bible schools. She eventually became too sick to continue and returned to the United States. Her hard work in Morocco may not have produced many conversions during her stay there, but there were a few conversions which were seen as a success, and continued the Christian influence within the country long after her life. After fifty years of service Maude returned to the United States because of her illness, and died in 1967."

He was also involved in censuses of the Asiatic lion at the Gir forest. Wynter-Blyth was born at Harrow-on-the-Hill, Middlesex, studied at Sedbergh School, Yorkshire and Magdalene College, Cambridge. He took an interest in nature study while still a student and moved to India in 1936 to become a house master at Bishop Cotton School. He later became headmaster of the preparatory school and here his meeting with A E Jones, an amateur lepidopterist, made him interested in butterflies. In 1941 he moved to the Nilgiris to take up a position as headmaster at St. George's School in Ketti; the school, which had been first recognized by the Education Department of Madras as a free primary school, was raised to the status of a high school in 1944 during his tenure. During the war, he was called to service but found unfit for active service and declined a staff appointment. In 1946 he moved to Saurashtra as a private tutor and from 1948 to 1963 till his death, he was the principal of the Rajkumar College, Rajkot, a school founded and run by the Princely Order of Kathiawar. He died in Switzerland of coronary thrombosis on April 16, 1963. His book, Butterflies of the Indian Region published by the Bombay Natural History Society in 1957 was for a long time the only handy guide to butterflies in India."

  "text" : "Mary French Sheldon (1847–1936), as author May French Sheldon, was an American publisher, author, and explorer. Mary French was born May 10, 1847, at Bridgewater, Pennsylvania. Her father was Joseph French, a civil engineer, and her mother Elizabeth J. French (née Poorman), a spiritualist who later practiced \"galvanic medicine\" in Boston, as did her sister. Dr. Belle French Patterson. She was educated in America and overseas, studying art and developing into an author and ethnologist. She married an American, Eli Lemon Sheldon, a banker, in 1876, and they moved to London where they established publishing firms. May French Sheldon is noted as a translator of Flaubert's Salammbô, and author of papers and essays, but acquired fame for an expedition. In 1891 she left London for Africa, unaccompanied, seeking assistance amongst the African peoples as she explored around Lake Chala. She returned with ethnographic materials, wrote on her experience, and undertook a lecture tour. French Sheldon received multiple awards for her exhibition at the World's Columbian Exposition, and was appointed membership in societies such as the Writer's Club and the Anthropological Society of Washington. She was made a fellow of the Royal Geographical Society, among the first 15 women to receive this honour, in November 1892. As a writer Sheldon wrote a number of novels, short stories, and essays."

  "text" : "Mobashar Qureshi is a Canadian novelist and short story writer and was born in Benin City, Nigeria in 1978. When he was eight his family moved to Karachi, Pakistan, staying there for over a year and then moving to Toronto, Canada, where he now resides. Qureshi graduated from the University of Toronto with a degree in Economics. Qureshi wrote his first novel, the unpublished sci-fi/horror thriller The Terror Birds at the age of eighteen. During university, Qureshi wrote a detective novel, An Unforgettable Mistake, about a detective mourning the loss of his wife. After many rejections from publishers and agents the novel was shelved away and remains unpublished. After graduating Qureshi wrote short stories for the amusement of himself and his friends and many are now available in a collection titled, Ten Typewriter Tales. As he entered the work force, he had to confine his writing to evenings and weekends, developing his writer’s voice, until he completed his first fully realized novel, R.A.C.E., published by The Mercury Press in 2007. R.A.C.E. is a comedy/mystery about a parking officer who is assigned by his precinct to save Toronto from radical criminals bent on developing black-market narcotics. The debut novel was critically acclaimed and the Canadian literary review magazine Quill and Quire named Qureshi one of the top ten Canadian emerging mystery writers for 2007. During the writing of R.A.C.E. Qureshi began plotting his next novel which would eventually become The October Five published by The Mercury Press in 2009. The October Five, another mystery, is about the ongoing investigation into a series of brutal murders by Chicago Homicide Detective Karl Whaler. The novel has a unique cast of characters; principally, five Viet Nam veterans, who regularly meet secretly in a room. Taking his police procedural narrative in a different direction, Qureshi’s most recent novel is The Paperboys Club. This mystery/thriller with a psychological twist again features intriguing characters including a troubled mental patient who possesses three extraordinary powers; three children who each have a different one of each of these powers and the mother of one of the children, a female police detective who must solve a cold case in order to earn a promotion. The Paperboys Club marked an exciting new direction in publishing for Qureshi as he released the novel on-line as an e-book, along with his previous two titles, and his short story collection. Qureshi, like most novelists, is an avid reader and he has had many influences on his writing career, including his favourite writer, Michael Crichton. As Qureshi explains it, he is inspired by the way Crichton continued to reinvent and challenge himself with each book he produced by moving from genre to genre. Qureshi made a conscious decision not to repeat himself after R.A.C.E. by publishing another novel featuring the affable lead character Jon Rupret. While the publishing world seems to encourage writers to develop a series of books based on one or two popular characters Qureshi prefers to pursue his own muse and see where that takes him."

  "text" : "Megumi Kinukawa (絹川 愛 Kinukawa Megumi, born 7 August 1989) is a Japanese long-distance runner. She represented her country at the 2007 World Championships in Athletics in Osaka and is the Japanese high school and junior record holder for the 10,000 metres. Born in Takasaki, Gunma, she attended Sendai Ikue High School – an institution renowned for its athletic programme. Kinukawa made her first impact on the national junior circuit in 2006, as she won the junior race at the Fukuoka International Cross Country and was runner-up at the Chiba Cross Country two weeks later. This gained her a debut international selection at the 2006 IAAF World Cross Country Championships (also held in Fukuoka), where the sixteen-year-old came in fourteenth place and helped the Japanese girls to a team bronze medal. Turning to the track later that April, she ran a national junior record in the 10,000 metres at the Hyogo Relay Carnival, placing second behind Lucy Wangui with a mark of 31:35.27 minutes – raising her to eleventh on the all-time junior rankings. Kinukawa ran at the Fukuoka Cross Country in 2007 and became the first high school student to win the senior title at the competition. With the 2007 World Championships in Athletics to be held in Osaka, she opted to focus on her track performances and achieved the \"A\" standard for the 10,000 m in April. She took third place in the event at the Japanese Athletics Championships and earned her first senior selection as a result. At the World Championships in Osaka that August she came fourteenth in the women's 10,000 m, coming in as the second best Asian finisher behind compatriot Kayoko Fukushi. Kinukawa took to the roads at the end of the year to compete for the Japanese team at the Chiba International Ekiden. She played a key role in Japan's victory at the competition, winning the fourth stage and closing the gap on Catherine Kirui of then-leaders Kenya. She suffered a stress fracture injury to her foot in April 2008 and only returned to serious competition in 2009. The injury continued to affect her running and she managed only 56th place at the 2010 Chiba Cross Country. The 2011 season saw her return to form and breakthrough into the senior ranks with a win over 5000 m at the Japanese Athletics Championships and then a third-place finish on her half marathon debut at the Sapporo Half Marathon. At the 2011 World Championships in Athletics in Daegu she missed out on qualification in the 5000 m and finished last over 10,000 m. She was the only Japanese to reach the podium at the 2012 Chiba Cross Country in February, taking third behind Kenyan opposition, and repeated that placing at the Fukuoka meet."

  "text" : "Michel Laurin is a vertebrate paleontologist whose specialties include the emergence of a land-based lifestyle among vertebrates, the evolution of body size, and the origin and phylogeny of lissamphibians. He has also made important contributions to the literature on phylogenetic nomenclature. As an undergraduate he worked in the laboratory of Robert L. Carroll and earned his Ph.D. at the University of Toronto under the direction of Robert R. Reisz; his thesis concerned the osteology of seymouriamorphs. His 1991 review of diapsid phylogeny provided the broadest review of the subject up to that date. In 1995, Laurin and Reisz coauthored a widely cited article providing evidence that the synapsids are the sister group of all other amniotes. He later worked on untangling the phylogeny of the Stegocephalia, a group with a notoriously difficult phylogeny. He later moved to France; since 1998, he has been a CNRS researcher at the Muséum national d'Histoire naturelle. He is an editor-in-chief of Comptes Rendus Palevol, a journal in the Comptes rendus de l'Académie des Sciences family, as well as being a reviewing editor for the Journal of Evolutionary Biology. He has been a key contributor to the International Society for Phylogenetic Nomenclature, where he served as president 2008–2009 and as secretary 2010–2011."

He previously served six years as House Minority Leader (2004–2010) and two terms as chairman of the Alabama Republican Party (2007–2011). He was found guilty of 12 of 23 ethics charges on June 10, 2016, and per state law, was removed from both his position as Speaker and as a member of the Alabama House of Representatives. As the Alabama GOP chairman, he created and headed Campaign 2010, the most comprehensive fund-raising and coordinated campaign plan in the Party's history. The effort raised over $5 million and, in the November 2010 General Election, resulted in Republicans winning every statewide office, picking up a congressional seat and taking majorities in both Houses of the Alabama Legislature for the first time in the 136 years since the end of the Reconstruction Era."

His father was a member of the Board of Deutsche Bank and his grandfather was President of the German Federal Bank. From 1989 to 1996 he worked for McKinsey including two years as partner. Following this he worked for Dresdner Bank, Advance Bank (which subsequently failed) and then joined Commerzbank as a Member of the Board in 2001. In 2008 he became CEO and a year later made the decision to take over Dresdner Bank. The takeover ultimately led to the combined bank being bailed out twice by the German government. Though initial attempts were made to blame the bailout on Dresdner, there were major losses within the original Commerzbank group, particularly at its EuroHypo subsidiary."

  "text" : "Michael S. Bernick (born October 1, 1952) is an American lawyer. He served as Director of California’s labor department, the Employment Development Department (EDD) from 1999 to 2004. He is a practitioner and theorist of job training and employment strategies. In a series of articles and books written during the 1980s and 1990s, drawing on his experience in community job training, he argues against the then-expanding social welfare system. He sets out alternative strategies of inner city entrepreneurship and market-based training and job ladders. In the 2000s, his practice and writing turned to worker retraining and reemployment strategies, including a series of local job training projects targeting displaced workers in California. Today, he is also active in developing local training projects for workers with autism and other neurodiverse conditions."

After a successful career in the military during the Napoleonic invasion, he became involved with multiple liberal Russian secret societies in the early 19th century, including the Union of Salvation and the Union of Welfare, as well as the Northern Society and the Southern Society. After the Decembrist Revolt took place in 1825, he was arrested due to his affiliations with the men responsible, and was subsequently exiled to a labor camp in Siberia. Lunin spent time in Finnish jails, three different prisons in Siberia, and lived on a farm under the watchful eye of the government during his life as an exile. Known for keeping good spirits and maintaining a firm defiance of autocratic rule, Lunin was eventually imprisoned again for writing in \"opposition\" to the Russian government, and lived out the rest of his life in a cell."

  "text" : "Muhammad al-Gharbi Amran (born 1958) is a Yemeni short story writer, novelist and politician. He is known for his short stories and for his controversial novel Mushaf Ahmar. He is also a former deputy mayor of Sanaa. He was born in Dhamar and studied history at university, obtaining a Master's degree in the subject. He has written five collections of short stories, starting with Al-sharashif (1997). His stories have been translated into English and Italian, and have featured in foreign-language anthologies such as Oranges in the Sun (2007) and Perle dello Yemen (2009). al-Gharbi Amran served as the deputy mayor of Sanaa for several years in the latter half of the 2010s. His first novel Mushaf Ahmar (Red Book) was published from Beirut in January 2010. The novel deals with vexing social problems like extremism and the oppression of women in Yemeni society. Two months after the publication of the book, Amran was relieved of his duties as deputy mayor. Amran claimed that this was due to the controversial content of his novel, although this was denied by the authorities. Later in 2010, a group of intellectuals boycotted the 27th Sanaa Book Fair, accusing the organizers of banning several books including Mushaf Ahmar. This too was denied by Yemen's Book Authority. al-Gharbi Amran heads a Yemeni literary club called el-Maqah."

Also known in his time by the honorary title, don Melitón, he founded Cibolo Creek Ranch halfway between Marfa and Presidio, Texas in 1857. He was one of the earliest Texas trail drivers, driving his cattle to market in New Orleans in the 1850s and to other markets later. Although his birthplace is not known with certainty, he was most likely born and raised in Missouri around 1822. Local lore contends that, while in his teens, he fought a duel and fled south, believing he had killed his opponent."

In recognition of his achievements, he was named a Hero of the Russian Federation in 1999. Simonov was born 19 October 1929 in Rostov-on-Don. He became an aviation engineer in the 1950s and joined Sukhoi as a deputy chief designer in 1970. In his time at Sukhoi, he developed the Sukhoi Su-24 bomber and the Sukhoi Su-25 ground-attack airplane, as well as the Su-27. He was the Soviet Union's deputy minister of aircraft industries from 1979 to 1983."

'The Arc' consists of a single string stretched lengthwise across a long piece of wood (around ten feet) which can be played with a bow, fingers or short glass rods. The end of the instrument has a microphone attached so the basic sound can be amplified, recorded and run through sound effect programs. Eastley has collaborated with many different artists and musicians on performances, installations and recordings including: David Toop (Toop's official website), Brian Eno, Paul Burwell, Victor gama, Hugh Davies, Steve Beresford, Peter Greenaway, Dave Hunt, David Buckland, Evan Parker, Peter Cusack, Spaceheads. From 2001–2002, Eastley was a visiting fellow at John Moores University Liverpool and is currently (2010 onwards) an AHRC research fellow at Oxford Brookes University researching Aeolian phenomena. On 17 May 1989, Eastley was awarded a prize in the 'Learning Spaces Category' of the working in the City European Communities Architectural Ideas Competition (University College Dublin)."

In 1990, film makers posted a protest to the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences arguing that Block, as a member of Documentary Steering Committee that selects films as nominees, had a conflict of interest because his company Direct Cinema owns the rights to three of the five films selected as nominees for best documentary feature, while Michael Moore's Roger & Me was omitted. The Academy's Executive Director, Bruce Davis remarked, \"Mitch Block said firmly and unequivocally that he thought that Roger & Me should be one of the nominees.\" Among the films and documentary series that Block has conceived, created and produced are Carrier and Another Day in Paradise, both of which were broadcast on the Public Broadcasting Service and the National Geographic Channel internationally. Carrier received an Emmy Award for Best Cinematography in a prime time series in 2009. In 2008, Block's short film No Lies (1973) was selected for the National Film Registry by the Librarian of Congress. The other films so far selected from films produced in 1973 are: American Graffiti, Badlands, Enter the Dragon, The Exorcist, Frank Film, Mean Streets and The Sting. Only a handful of the 550 films on the registry (as of 2011) are short films made by students. In 2016, film critics for the website IndieWire selected it as one of the ten best short films ever made. Since 1978, Block has been an adjunct professor at the School of Cinematic Arts of the University of Southern California most currently teaching in the Peter Stark Producing Program. The moving image collection of Direct Cinema/Mitchell Block is held at the Academy Film Archive."

There are dedications in verse by Richard Smith, the publisher, who confesses to knowing nothing of the author, and in prose by the author, both addressed to Sir Henry Compton, 1st Baron Compton, father of William Compton, 1st Earl of Northampton. The story of Pelops and Hippodamia is told in ballad metre. There follow many short pieces, chiefly dealing with a lover's joys and pains, and a few epigrams on moral subjects. There are some jesting verses entitled 'A perfect tricke to kill little blacke flees in one's chamber.' Only one copy of the volume is known ; it is in the library of the Earl of Ellesmere. Dr. Grosart reprinted it in his 'Occasional Issues' in 1878. In 1638, Henry Gosson published a work by one Mathew Grove, entitled Witty Proverbs, Pithy Sentences, and wise similes collected out of the Golden volumes of divers learned and grave philosophers, London, 8vo. William Carew Hazlitt was of the opinion that this author is to be distinguished from the writer of 'Pelops.'"

  "text" : "Marvin Ammori is an American innovation lawyer, civil liberties advocate, and scholar best known for his work on network neutrality and Internet freedom issues generally. In 2016, Ammori was named General Counsel for Hyperloop One in Los Angeles. He serves on the boards of public interest advocacy groups Demand Progress and Fight for the Future, and is an Affiliate Scholar with Stanford Law School's Center for Internet and Society. In 2007, while serving as the General Counsel for nonprofit advocacy group Free Press, he brought the Comcast-BitTorrent case, the first network neutrality enforcement action in the United States. Ammori was active in the debate over the controversial copyright bills SOPA and the PROTECT IP Act, arguing that the bills would violate the First Amendment. Partly for his role in opposing SOPA and PIPA, Ammori was recognized in Fast Company's 2012 \"100 Most Creative People in Business.\" In 2014 and 2015, Ammori led the effort to get the Federal Communications Commission to adopt strong network neutrality rules on the basis of its Title II authority. Tim Wu, who coined the phrase network neutrality, said that Ammori \"deserved enormous credit for leading the march to Title II.\" Ammori collaborated with the John Oliver show for its network neutrality segment and worked with White House staff leading to President Obama's network neutrality plan.  For this work, he was named to the Politico 50 and a Washington Tech Titan in 2015. On June 14, 2016, the D.C. Circuit Court, which had in 2014 rejected the FCC's attempts to impose network neutrality rules under its 706 authority, upheld the Title II network neutrality rules, writing in the majority opinion that the FCC had overcome the problems of the previous rules \"by reclassifying broadband service—and the interconnection arrangements necessary to provide it—as a telecommunications service\" under Title II, thereby vindicating Ammori's legal approach. Ammori is a graduate of the University of Michigan and Harvard Law School. At Harvard, he studied under communications scholar Yochai Benkler. From 2008 to 2011, he was a law professor at the University of Nebraska–Lincoln College of Law. He was a 2013 Bernard L. Schwartz Fellow at the New America Foundation. He is the author of an e-book entitled \"On Internet Freedom.\" As a lawyer, Ammori has advised companies including Google and Apple on network neutrality, copyright, and encryption."

Margaretha's father disapproved of her marrying a Catholic, the comte de Liedekerke, and her conversion to Catholicism and withdrew her from his will. Soon after her marriage, Count de Liedekerke died at a hunting party. She remarried with Antoine Alfred Agénor de Gramont, 11th Duke of Gramont (then duc de Guiche) in 1878 who was the son of Agénor de Gramont, an ex-ambassador of Emperor Napoleon III. Baron Carl Meyer von Rothschild refused to attend the wedding, because he had preferred his daughter to marry her cousin Edmond James de Rothschild, rather than a non-Jew. The will of her father was revoked and she received her inheritance at her father's death, in 1886, which was enormous. The Duke and Duchess de Gramont lived in their hôtel particulier on the Champs Élysées where she would give parties for the cream of the aristocracy, and at their château de Vallière, near Paris. They had three children: \n*  Antoine Agénor Armand (1879–1962), duc de Guiche, then 12th duc de Gramont, who was a close friend of Marcel Proust, and married Élaine Greffulhe, daughter of the famous comtesse Greffulhe; \n*  Antonia Corisande Emma Louise (1880–1977), who married Marquis Hélie de Noailles; \n*  Louis-René (1883–1963), Comte de Gramont, who married Antoinette de Rochechouart-Mortemart."

His grandfather, David Napier (1785–1873), had moved to London from Scotland and by 1836 had established an engineering company in Lambeth called D. Napier & Son. Montague Napier bought the business from the executors of his father's estate in 1895, and diversified into producing machine tools for the cycle industry. Following a meeting with businessman and racing driver Selwyn Edge in 1899 Napier diversified into automobile manufacturer, and for a time his company was the leading supplier of luxury cars in the British market. His focus switched from cars to aircraft engines after the outbreak of the First World War in 1914, and he developed the very successful Lion engine. Napier's failing health forced his move to the south of France in 1915, but he continued to work as a design consultant for his company. He died at his home in Cannes on 22 January 1931, aged 60."

  "text" : "Mani Leib (Mani Leyb, Yiddish: מאַני לייב‎; born Mani Leib Brahinsky, Russian: Мани Лейб Брагинский; 20 December 1883, Nezhin, Russian Empire – 4 October 1953, New York) was a Yiddish-language poet. He was one of eight children; his father sold furs, hides, and animals at regional fairs. His mother supported the family selling hens, geese and eggs. In A mayse vegn zikh\" (A Story About Myself), he describes her as a fount of spontaneous rhymes, poems, and epigrams. At the age of 11 Leyb left school to be apprenticed to a bootmaker; as a participant in \"revolutionary activities\", he was arrested twice while still in his teens. He emigrated to the United States at the age of 22 and settled in New York City in 1906. He published his poems in Yiddish newspapers like The Jewish Daily Forward. Writing in the cadences of ordinary speech, he formed a group of poets called Di Yunge (\"the Young\"). According to the Jewish Virtual Library, Leib's \"sound poems drew renewed attention to the Yiddish language through their skillful use of alliteration and repetition.\" These poems proved controversial, and were parodied by Moyshe-Leyb Halpern in 1910; the two, it is argued, became rivals. Mani Leib also wrote about children. His classic, Yingl Tsingl Khvat, was illustrated by the Russian avant-garde master, El Lissitzky. He worked throughout his life making shoes and boots, and he references his profession in the poem \"I Am.\" He contracted tuberculosis and lived in a sanatorium for two years. He never lost his belief in \"the ability of poetry to transform the mundane into the divine.\" His reputation continued to grow after his death, when his collected work was published: Lider un Baladn (Songs and Ballads) in 1955 and Sonetn (Sonnets) in 1961. Lider un baladn was reprinted in 1963 with parallel Hebrew translations by Shimshon Meltzer, and an introduction by Itzik Manger. The second volume of Lider un Baladn contains a brief autobiography."

In 1984 he was convicted of membership in the terrorist organization the \"Jewish Underground\" of the early 1980s, and sentenced to three years in prison for his part in the assassination of Palestinian mayors but only spent a few months in jail. His wife Yael is quoted by the Israeli newspaper Haaretz as having said at the time: \"The underground is not a stage in the life of the Zar family, but a stage in the life of the nation.\" After one of his eight children, his son Gilad, a security officer of the Shomron Regional Council, was killed in an ambush on May 29, 2001, he vowed that he would establish six settlements in his son′s memory, one for each Hebrew letter of his name. The settlement outpost Ramat Gilad was established in 2001, the outpost Havat Gilad was established in 2002 and has been dismantled by the Israeli military forces several times, leading to violent clashes between settlers and security forces."

  "text" : "Martti Kuoppa is a Flatland BMX rider from Finland. He is widely recognised as one of the most skilled and most original riders in the history of the sport. He has invented and innovated many tricks on his quest for originality. He dominated the major contest scene between 2000 and 2002 as the winner of the BMX - flatland event at X Games VIII and has competed in and won a number of contests all over the world, such as the BMX Worlds in Germany in 2002. He has produced some very well received video parts and a solo DVD entitled Moments (Diversion TV). He was plagued by injury around 2005 due to the obsessive and relentless practice of flatland. He has shared many online edits which show his continuing quest and hunger for originality. One project, Ground Tactics, provides a forum and contest for flatland riders around the world. At the heart of Ground Tactics is \"hardcore flatland skills\" and the promotion of originality and creativity. In 2012 Kuoppa announced his retirement from flatland riding to concentrate on other aspects of his life. On October 25, 2015, Martti came out of retirement and won FlatArk, which is one of the biggest flatland BMX contests in recent years. The pro purse of this event was 5,000,000 JPY. This feat is one of his greatest accomplishments, given the competitors at this contest. Specifically, Martti was required to defeat the 2015 World Champion in order to advance to the final round of the competition. Martti Kuoppa held two Guinness World Records for a time that he set in 2001: \"Martti Kuoppa inscrit son nom au Guinness Book of Records with rolling no-footed on the front wheel of his bike for 100 meters and doing 59 pinky squeaks in a minute.\" Both Records have since been surpassed: \n* Longest distance wheelie on bicycle front wheel with feet off pedals - Currently set on Jan 28 2010 by Shane Badman (Australia) \n* Most BMX pinky squeaks in one minute - Nov 24 2007 by Andreas Lindqvist (Sweden)"

  "text" : "Maurizio Ferraris (born February 7, 1956 in Turin) is an Italian philosopher and scholar. His name is attached to the philosophical current named new realism (he wrote the Manifesto of New Realism in 2012, forthcoming for SUNY Press), that shares significant similarities with speculative realism and object oriented ontology. A pupil of Gianni Vattimo, and influenced by Jacques Derrida, he started as a theorist of hermeneutics before turning his attention to the analytic strand. Over the years he has been able to create an effective synthesis between the two approaches, creating a new ontological realism that rejects Kant's schematism in the cognitive area. Since 1995 Ferraris has been full Professor of Philosophy in the Department of Literature and Philosophy at the University of Turin, where he also runs the CTAO (Inter-University Centre for Theoretical and Applied Ontology) and the LabOnt (Laboratory for Ontology). He studied in Turin, Paris and Heidelberg and has taught at major European Universities. He is the director of the Rivista di Estetica and is part of the directive committee of Critique and aut aut. From 1989 to 2010 he has written for the cultural supplement of Il Sole 24 ORE; since 2010 he has been writing for the cultural section of la Repubblica. His main areas of expertise are hermeneutics, aesthetics and ontology."

In 1859, published the first volume of his master's thesis: \"The Lithuanian church union\" in 1862. - The second volume of. In \"Day\" IS. Aksakov put his lectures on the western Russian fraternities and the history of western Russia (the latest edition 1884, with the application of ethnographic maps). In 1865, on behalf of the Archaeological Commission, they issued Documents, with translation into French; in 1869, on behalf of the Academy of Sciences - \"Chronicle of the siege of Pskov by Stefan Batory\", on behalf of the Archaeological Commission - \"Diary of the Diet of Lublin in 1569\", with translation into Russian, in 1872. - \"The Russian Historical Library\", t.

In 1884, published a part of the course Koyalovich on Russian history: \"History of Russian national consciousness to the historical monuments and scientific writings\". According to Koyalovich, \"in the history of the area of objective truth is very low, the rest inevitably subjective \"and he followed so that subjectivism, which is more than all others \"embraces the factual part of Russian history and the best illuminates the real and significant part of its\". This Russian subjectivism Koyalovich found in the writings of Slavophiles. The same trends held Slavophile Koyalovich in their journal articles (mostly on the history of South-West of Russia), and in the speeches, of which is allocated a speech delivered at the St. Petersburg Slavic Benevolent Society speech on the topic: \"The historical persistence of the Russian people and its cultural characteristics\" (1883). He stood there for probably close communication between the Slavic tribes, to unite them under the banner of Saints Cyril and Methodius. Full list of works Koyalovich cm. Article Professor Palm (Slavic Izvestiya, 1891, December)."

He is the main creator of COCA, the Corpus of Contemporary American English. He received a National Endowment for the Humanities grant to build a comparable Spanish language corpus, the Corpus del Español, and another one to create a corpus of Portuguese texts covering material from the 12th century to the present day. Another corpus he compiled is a diachronic corpus of English, containing texts from the years 1810 through 2009, called COHA, the Corpus of Historical American English; this project was also funded by the NEH. Davies is also the creator of the General Conference corpus, which allows a study of how the use of words from the LDS General Conference has changed over time. Davies earned a bachelor's degree with a double major in linguistics and Spanish from BYU in 1986. He earned an MA in Spanish linguistics also from BYU in 1989. He earned his Ph.D. in Iberoromance philology and linguistics from the University of Texas at Austin in 1992. From 1993-2003 Davies was a professor at Illinois State University. He is currently a professor of linguistics at Brigham Young University (BYU) where he has been on the faculty since 2003. In 2008 he held the Barker Lectureship at BYU."

  "text" : "Marianne du Toit (born 1970) is a South African adventurer and photographer, notable for her epic journey on horseback and foot from Argentina to New York over a period of 21 months. After graduating from Stellenbosch University in 1992 with a BA degree in political science and psychology, she spent three years exploring and cycling through Europe before finally settling in Dublin, where she currently lives. Inspired by the Swiss adventurer Aimé Félix Tschiffely, who from 1925 to 1928 traveled from Buenos Aires to Washington DC with two Criollo horses, Marianne resolved to follow in his footsteps. She decided to use the journey to promote and raise money in support of therapeutic riding facilities in Ireland. “I remember, since I was about 17 I would always read these articles about independent daring women who had done these amazing journeys. There was always something deep down driving me to these adventurous things. I just loved the adrenaline and the excitement.” She spoke no Spanish and knew little about horses and horse riding, but set off in May 2002 from Ireland for South America where her two Criollo’s, Mise and Tusa, were acquired. Their names mean respectively Me and You in the Irish language. Six months into her journey, Tusa was found to be suffering from anaemia and had to be put down. Marianne considered admitting defeat; however despite numerous other hardships she persevered and completed the journey, joining in the St Patrick’s Day parade through the streets of New York in 2004. Marianne's adventures are related in her book Crying with Cockroaches. Supporting the Dublin Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, Marianne rescues stray dogs from Dublin streets. The foie gras industry, factory farming, testing on animals, the fur trade and use of animals in the circus are some of the issues she chooses to highlight."

  "text" : "Sir Marshall Campbell (1848–1917) was a pioneer of the sugar industry in the Colony of Natal and parliamentarian concerned with Bantu affairs. The Conquering Hero, a brig of 320 tons under Captain Cockburn, sailed from the Clyde (Glasgow/Greenock) with 127 settlers on 29 March 1850. Marshall Campbell landed in Durban on 28 June 1850 with his parents, William John and Agnes Campbell. They had come under the Byrne Settler scheme, which between 1849 and 1851, brought some 2 500 English emigrants to Natal. Shortly after their arrival in Durban, Marshall's father was awarded a contract to construct the harbour's North Pier. This enabled him to buy land on the Umdhloti River, and develop his farm which he called Muckleneuk, Scots for 'great bend'. The house was designed by Frank Fleming, one of Herbert Baker's partners. By the time he died in 1865 aged 44, he had become a prominent sugar cane planter and miller. Marshall also turned to sugar cane farming and in 1895 founded Natal Estates Limited , and two years later South Africa's first sugar refinery. He married Ellen Blamey, daughter of another sugar pioneer, in 1877 and settled at Mount Edgecombe, raising a family of four children. Being active in local business and politics, he became a member of the Natal Legislative Council, later being appointed Senator for Natal. In 1915 he received a knighthood for services to the country. A Black township outside Durban is named Kwa Mashu, Zulu for 'the place of Marshall'. Of interest is that he played a part in 1892 in introducing rickshaws to Durban, a mode of transport that has become very popular with sight-seeing tourists. Two of his children, Margaret ('Killie') and William, were instrumental in founding The Killie Campbell Collection of Africana housed at Muckleneuk."

Embroiled in the George Koskotas scandal however, he was brought before a Special Tribunal. During the procedure he collapsed in the court room on 11 April 1991 and died a week later."

  "text" : "Mohamed \"Mo\" Nabbous (محمد نبوس ‎; 27 February 1983 – 19 March 2011) was a Libyan information technologist, blogger, businessperson and civilian journalist who created and founded Libya Alhurra TV. At the outbreak of the Libyan Civil War, Nabbous was the founder of Libya Alhurra TV, the first independent broadcast news organization since Gaddafi took power in Libya. Libya Alhurra TV was established in Benghazi, Libya on 19 February 2011 and started broadcasting online when Nabbous established a two-way satellite connection in the wake of a complete Internet blackout imposed by the Gaddafi government after the 17 February protests. Nabbous was shot by a sniper and killed on 19 March 2011 while reporting on attempts by government forces to fight revolutionaries and attack civilians in Benghazi. Hours after the death of Nabbous, international coalition airplanes entered Libyan airspace to enforce a no-fly zone authorized by United Nations Security Council Resolution 1973. In the last weeks of his life, Nabbous focused on bringing international attention to the humanitarian crisis unfolding in Libya. His death was widely reported by CNN and various media outlets. Prior to the establishment of Libya Alhurra TV, Nabbous operated a number of businesses in Benghazi city."

Born in Rochdale, part of Greater Manchester, he studied at the Birmingham Repertory Theatre and had a role as Abanazer in a 1963 performance of Aladdin in the Royal Tunbridge Wells Opera House, which led to a 15-year-long legal battle with presiding agent, Alan Gale, over commission and the displacement of a large quantity of nose putty. Later, he played small parts in several TV shows, including a role as a postboy in the soap opera Compact and, after a dry spell, a non-speaking role as a Dalek operator. Seeing this as a particularly low point in his career, Summerton joined Hazel Malone's talent agency, where he met David Bowie, who was similarly attempting an acting career, and apparently expressed cynicism in Bowie's musical abilities. In 1970 Summerton started his own talent agency, recruiting in its heyday Noele Gordon, the dance groups Love Machine and Hot Gossip, Lesley Joseph, Sinitta, Bonnie Langford and the Beverly Sisters. He later managed several dancers and choreographers, including Debbie Astell, Les Child, Thomas Michael Voss, Arlene Phillips and Bruno Tonioli."

  "text" : "Maurice William Holtze, (8 July 1840 – 12 October 1923) born in Hanover, Germany, was a botanist who established Darwin's Botanical Gardens in Fannie Bay, Darwin in 1878. When he left to take charge of Adelaide's Botanic Garden in 1891, his son Nicholas was appointed curator of the Darwin Botanical Gardens in his place. Holtze studied at Hildesheim and Osnabrück before serving an apprenticeship in Hanover, where he subsequently worked for four years in the Royal Gardens. He spent two years in the Imperial Gardens of St. Petersburg before emigrating in 1872 to Melbourne, then to Darwin, Northern Territory. While in Darwin (then called Palmerston, later Port Darwin) he made trial plantings of a large number of tropical plants of potential economic importance: rubber, rice, peanuts, tobacco, sugar, coffee, indigo and maize. He supplied the sugarcane tubers for the Cox's (later Cox) Peninsula sugarcane venture in which B. C. DeLissa and W. H. and G. T. Bean had a large interest. Holtze sent a large number of botanic specimens from the Darwin area and nearby islands, many of which had not been previously described, to Sir Ferdinand Mueller. In Adelaide, succeeding the great Dr Schomburgk as curator, he did much to make the Botanic Gardens an attractive place for the general public to visit, a novel policy at the time. He established lakes populated with water-lilies and lotuses, which became quite famous. He retired in 1917 and died at Kangaroo Island, South Australia in the home of his daughter. He is buried in Penneshaw Cemetery, Kangaroo Island, South Australia along with his wife, Evlampia (née Mizinzoff), who died 5 July 1937. A son, Alexis L. Holtze, was Horticultural correspondent for the Mount Barker Courier, and editor of the Garden and Field."

  "text" : "Mario Esposito (7 September 1887 – 19 February 1975) was an Irish and Italian scholar who specialised in Hiberno-Latin studies. He was born in Dublin, the third of four children of Michele Esposito, an Italian, and Natalia Klebnikoff (1857–1944) who hailed from St Petersburg. Michele was an influential music professor at the Royal Irish Academy of Music. The couple met in Naples, were married in London in 1879, and their oldest daughter was born in Paris, before the family settled in Ireland in 1882.The children were raised speaking English, German, Italian, French and Russian. The family were well known in the artistic and literary circles of Dublin and numbered James Joyce and Samuel Beckett among their acquaintances. The 1901 census lists the family living at 50 Serpentine Avenue in Dublin and renders Mario's first name as 'Marius'. In 1905 Esposito entered Trinity College Dublin and was awarded a BA in 1912. He was elected a member of the Royal Irish Academy in 1910. Much of his early researches were undertaken in the manuscript collections of Irish and British libraries. Esposito moved to Florence in 1920, a move which facilitated his, already advanced, work on Hiberno-Latin material in continental libraries and particularly in Italy and the Vatican. Although Esposito never held a formal academic post, his scholarly output was prolific. He published his first article (on Dicuil) in the Dublin Review at the age of eighteen and produced a steady stream of publications for much of the rest of his life. According to Michael Lapidge, Esposito \"did more than any scholar before or since to appreciate and define Latin learning in medieval Ireland\".In 1988 twenty of his publications were anthologised and published as Latin Learning in Mediaeval Ireland. In the last decade of his life he suffered with poor eyesight. He never married and died in Florence, aged 87, and was cremated."

  "text" : "Margherita Farnese (7 November 1567 – 13 April 1643) was a daughter of Alexander Farnese, Duke of Parma and Infanta Maria of Guimarães. She was named after her father's mother Margaret of Parma, natural daughter of Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor. Margherita was born in Parma. On 2 March 1581 she married Vincenzo Gonzaga, the future duke of Mantua, probably with the political aim of creating an anti-Florentine alliance between the Gonzaga and Farnese families, after their long feud since 1547, when Ferrante Gonzaga had organised a plot against Pier Luigi Farnese first duke of Parma and Piacenza. The couple made a solemn entry into Mantua on 30 April 1581, but the marriage ended in annulment on grounds of non-consummation on 26 May 1583, with Vincenzo claiming she had been unable to do so due to a deformity and Margherita accusing him of impotence. Vincenzo's brother Ranuccio then took her back to Parma a year after the marriage and Vincenzo remarried in 1584 to Eleonora de' Medici. His first marriage was the basis for the 1966 film A Maiden for a Prince, with Vittorio Gassman, Virna Lisi and Anna Maria Guarnieri, who played Margherita. Thought unable to have children, Margherita was forced to retire to a convent and take vows as a nun. She joined the Benedictine order at the San Paolo monastery in Parma, under the name of sister Maura Lucenia. In 1616 she intervened, supported by financial aid offered by the devotees, in order to complete the Franciscan church of Santi Gervaso e Protaso, now dedicated to the Santissima Annunziata, according to the plans by Giambattista Fornovo. She died in Piacenza."

As an author and photographer he has written many books on the subject of cave diving history and techniques and caving locations. Farr began caving in 1961 and cave diving in 1971, and within 10 years had established a world record for underwater cave penetration in the Bahamas. He is noted within the cave diving community for his explorations in Wookey Hole in 1977 and 1982, and for completing the first traverse of Llangattock Mountain in Wales in 1986, the execution of which was a televised media event, being the longest and deepest caving through trip in the British Isles. In 1978, Farr discovered also the Pollatoomary cave in the Partry Mountains of the Republic of Ireland. In 2008, his student Artur Kozłowski explored this cave to a depth of 103 metres, which made it the deepest known cave on the British Isles. As well as running a cave diving training facility in South Wales, Farr is a regular contributor to diving magazines around the world. Farr has also acted as support diver in some of the world's most notable cave diving penetrations, including the British-led expedition to Pozo Azul in Spain in September 2010, which at 8.8 km (5.5 miles) of underwater travel is the world's longest cave diving penetration. Farr is the author of The Darkness Beckons, regarded as the definitive book on the history of UK cave diving."

  "text" : "Mawlawi Mohammad Afzal (born c. 1925 - d. 2012) was an Panjpiri-educated Afghan clergyman of the Kam tribe from Barg-i-Matal, Nuristan Province. He studied in Deoband, and later at Akora, Pakistan, before teaching at a madrassa in Karachi, and then in his native village of Badmuk. Following the Saur Revolution of 1978 in Afghanistan, Afzal established a Salafist mini-state in northern Nuristan, known as the Islamic Revolutionary State of Afghanistan, with consulates in Saudi Arabia and Pakistan. Though Nuristan was generally a mujahideen area, Afzal was among those leaders who were at least temporarily co-opted by the DRA communist government. In the 1980s, Afzal was among those Nuristani leaders who, after initially supporting him, expelled the southern Nuristan military leader Sarwar Nuristani, suspecting him of supporting the Communist government. With the arrival of the Taliban in the mid 1990s, Afzal aligned himself with that movement, and received their support."

  "text" : "May Cecelia Gutteridge, CM one of Canada's early and most celebrated social workers, was born May 21, 1917 in Gosport, Hampshire, England, the youngest of four children of Ernest and Polly Symonds. Raised in a devout Christian home, she married Arthur Gutteridge, a school teacher, during WW2 on March 23rd, 1940 dressed in her Women's Royal Naval Service uniform. The couple had three children, Sonia, Michael and Lance. They immigrated to Canada settling in Prairie River, Saskatchewan in 1955. Even though May was a busy mother and housewife, while in Saskatchewan, she engaged in numerous community activities. She ran a Scouting group, did substitute teaching, developed a kindergarten, supervised a 4-H club, and reopened a school in this remote area for the small group of children who could not get schooling anywhere else. The family moved to Vancouver, British Columbia in 1958 where she became a regular worshipper at St. James' Church. It was there, in one of the poorest neighbourhoods in Canada, where her unparalleled story of outreach and care for the homeless, the poor and forgotten started. May began looking after seniors in the church's basement and then formed St. James Social Service in 1961, the Home Help program in 1962, and the first shelter for abused women in the Downtown Eastside named The East Ender's Society in 1965. At the same time she organized free legal aid, the Gastown Workshop, a cheque administration program for social assistance clients and later residential housing for seniors (1983) and the first free-standing hospice in British Columbia (1990). Her work has been formally acknowledged by receiving the Order of Canada, the BC Senior Citizen of the year Award, the Silver Eagle Feather Award, the Pioneer Award, an honorary Doctorate of Laws from Simon Fraser University, the Chinatown Lioness Club Ambassador Award, the Certificate of Merit and the Chinatown Rotary Club Award. At the time of her death on February 26, 2002, St. James' Community Service Society had become one of the largest social service agencies in Vancouver with 250 employees and an annual budget of $10 million. May Gutteridge never received an income for her many years of service."

He worked closely with agent Joe Collins (the father of Joan and Jackie Collins), and staged the first Beatles Christmas Shows in 1963. He then managed many of the major pop music touring shows in the UK, including those headlined by such bands and musicians as P.J. Proby, The Byrds, Johnny Cash, Chubby Checker, Marlene Dietrich, Sarah Vaughan, Chuck Berry, Peggy Lee, the Red Army Ensemble and many more. He also directed the Melody Maker Pop Shows held at Wembley Arena in the 1960s, before launching the annual International Festivals of Country Music held at the same venue between 1969 and 1991. The shows were later taken into Europe, and featured such stars as Johnny Cash, Dolly Parton, Tammy Wynette, and Jerry Lee Lewis. More recently he has been responsible for major touring shows including Annie and Three Steps To Heaven. In 1989, Conn was convicted of a serious sexual assault on his 19-year-old receptionist and was sentenced to eight weeks in prison. In July 2014, he was arrested at Gatwick airport in connection with an alleged historic rape and sexual assault. In 2010 Conn published an autobiography, Mr Music Man: My Life in Showbiz."

  "text" : "Michael Rowe (born September 9, 1962) is an award-winning Canadian writer, journalist, novelist and anthologist. He has written for numerous publications in Canada and the United States including the National Post, The Globe and Mail, The United Church Observer, The Huffington Post and The Advocate. As an author, Rowe has published two novels, a novella, four anthologies of original short fiction, and a variety of non-fiction books. His first, Writing Below the Belt: Conversations with Erotic Authors was an exploration of censorship, pornography, and popular culture. Looking for Brothers contains essays on the contemporary gay experience. Other Men’s Sons, which won the 2008 Randy Shilts Award for Nonfiction, is a collection of his work from 2000 to 2005. His first novel, Enter, Night, a vampire story set in Northern Ontario in 1972, was published in October 2011 by ChiZine Publications, and sold in the spring of 2012 to Random House Germany for translation. On April 13, 2012, Enter, Night was announced as a finalist for Canada's prestigious Prix Aurora Awards in the English Language Novel category. The Prix Aurora Awards are awarded annually to celebrate the best in Canadian speculative fiction. \"Enter, Night\" was also shortlisted for the Sunburst Award. The jury said of Rowe's novel, \"After the post-Twilight tsunami of toothless vampire fiction, this nightmare-inducing novel offers a decidedly welcome return to the emotional, physical, and spiritual hells invoked by the best vampire tales. The small northern Ontario town of Parr's Landing in 1972 is a place where history bleeds, both literally and figuratively. Horrors both human and other-than-human have haunted the town for generations, and while some people flee the place, they find themselves summoned back to face the hungry darkness that reaches out to claim this secret-riven community. Richly textured and filled with complex, convincing personalities, as well as being a truly frightening read, Enter, Night is a chilling foray into the emotional, sexual, and ideological horrors we create for one another.\" In December 2013, Rowe's second novel, Wild Fell, a classic gothic ghost story set in Canada's Georgian Bay region was published by ChiZine Publications. Wild Fell was subsequently a finalist for the 2013 Shirley Jackson Award, and will be published in French by Paris-based Editions Bragelonne in 2015. In addition to his nonfiction and fiction writing, Rowe has edited several collections of gay horror, the most notable being Queer Fear for which he won a Lambda Literary Award. Chad Helder, editor of Unspeakable Horror: From the Shadows of the Closet, credited Queer Fear as paving the way for his win of the Bram Stoker Award. Novelist Clive Barker credited Rowe's Queer Fear books as having changed the landscape of horror fiction. Rowe married his partner, Dr. Brian McDermid, in a Holy Union ceremony at the Metropolitan Community Church of Toronto in 1985. The two re-wed in 2003 when gay and lesbian marriage became legal in Canada, which he wrote about in the essay \"From This Day Forward\" which appeared in Other Men's Sons. They were among the first gay couples in Canadian history to be legally married, and are believed to be the first gay couple in history to be married inside a United Church of Canada. They currently reside in Toronto. In October 2015, Rowe's essay \"Some Thoughts On My 30th Wedding Anniversary in the Summer of Equal Marriage\", which was first published in the Huffington Post on August 24, 2015, won the Love Wins essay prize from New Millennium Writings."

  "text" : "Moussa Ibrahim (Arabic: موسى إبراهيم‎‎ ; romanized also as Mussa and Musa, born 7 December 1974) is a Libyan political figure who rose to international attention in 2011 as Muammar Gaddafi's Information Minister and official spokesman, serving in this role until the government was toppled in the Libyan Civil War. Ibrahim held frequent press conferences in the course of the war, denouncing rebel forces and the NATO-led military intervention, often in defiant and impassioned tones. His status and whereabouts remained unknown following the Battle of Tripoli in which the Gaddafi government was overthrown, although there were several claims and subsequent refutations of his capture. Eventually, in late 2014, it was discovered he was in Egypt before he was deported and fled to Serbia. On January 12, 2015 Moussa Ibrahim spoke publicly by video link at a political event hosted at the Committee Rooms Houses of Parliament, Westminster, London from an undisclosed location."

  "text" : "Menashe Oppenheim (Menasha, Menasze Oppenheim, sometimes used pseudonym Mieczyslaw) (1905–1973) was a Polish Jewish singer, composer, songwriter, collector and performer of folk songs. Born in the eastern borderlands of Poland, in the early thirties he performed at revi-teater in Kovne (Kaunas, now in Lithuania) under the direction of Jonas Turkow. In the mid-thirties he worked at the Scala theater. He then became a leading Yiddish film actor. As a singer he recorded many records in Yiddish. He composed and wrote lyrics. He belonged to the Jewish Section of the prewar Association of Theatrical Authors And Composers in Warsaw. In the late 1930s he appeared in several important Jewish sound films, including Joseph Green's Di freylekhe kabtsonim (1937) with Shimon Dzigan and Israel Shumacher (directed by Zygmunt Turkow, screenwriter Moishe Broderzon, music by Henech Kon) and Mamele (1938) with Molly Picon. In February 1939 he accepted Joseph Zeid's (Joseph Seiden)'s offer to play the lead in a movie called Kol Nidre. He left for the United States to do the filming; at the completion of the movie, World War II had begun and Oppenheim was unable to return to Poland. He survived the Holocaust in the USSR-occupied part of eastern Poland, but his entire family died during the Nazi occupation. After 1945 he emigrated to South America. In 1940-1960 he worked in various Yiddish theaters in the United States. Oppenheim performed in Yoshe Kalb with Miriam Kressyn in 1972. He died on 23 October 1973 and was buried in the Mount Hebron Cemetery in Queens, New York, on land owned by the Jewish theatrical union."

  "text" : "The murder of Zoe Nelson was committed in the Cambusnethan suburb of Wishaw, North Lanarkshire, Scotland on 22 May 2010. Seventeen-year-old Zoe Nelson's extensively burned remains were found in woodland near a colliery spoil heap known locally as Monkey Hill after her killer constructed a pyre in an attempt to destroy evidence. Forensic pathologist Julia Bell told the High Court of Justiciary in Edinburgh that the possibilities for a full post mortem were \"limited\" because the body was too badly burned, but that \"some form of throttling or suffocating was the most probable cause of death, which was recorded as 'unascertained'\". During their enquiries, police used new media for the first time in a murder investigation, in an effort to reach out to local teenagers who may otherwise have not wanted to communicate with the police. During the trial it also emerged that the victim's sister had withheld the identity of the killer for five days. On 25 March 2011, 21-year-old Robert Bayne was found guilty of her murder and of a second charge of attempting to defeat the ends of justice. The judge deferred sentencing for psychiatric and social background reports to be prepared. On 27 April 2011 Bayne was sentenced to life imprisonment, with a minimum term of twenty years, for the murder and six years, to be served concurrently, for the second charge."

  "text" : "Matthew Burt (born 1951) is a furniture designer-maker in England who runs a contemporary practice from a studio and workshop (established 1978) based in the South Wiltshire village of Sherrington, west of Salisbury. His work has been displayed in significant public exhibitions, most notably in the OneTree touring show and at the House of Commons in 2008 in a selection of work intended to raise the profile of UK furniture making to members of parliament. His solo museum exhibition Idea to Object was held at the Crafts Study Centre, Farnham in 2008.Matthew Burt’s workshop steadily built on a reputation for furniture design that allies structurally robust work that fulfils its function with a lean, elegant line and the occasional bravura surface. Burt has said that he regards the 'intermingling of science, engineering, mathematics, aesthetics and metaphorics' as the fundamental building blocks for his furniture. He was awarded the Master’s Gold Award by the Worshipful Company of Furniture Makers in 2001. Peter Keen, Master of the Worshipful Company of Furniture Makers said: \"I was delighted to see Matthew Burt receive his well-deserved award from the Lord Mayor. The table is a first class example of the very best in modern furniture design.\""

  "text" : "Maud Gage Baum (March 27, 1861 – March 6, 1953) was the wife of L. Frank Baum. Her mother was the suffragist Matilda Joslyn Gage. In her early life, she attended a boys' high school and was raised to be headstrong. Maud lived in Fayetteville, New York, with her aging parents until she married Frank in 1882, sacrificing her college education at Cornell University. At the onset of their marriage, she accompanied her husband's acting troupe throughout the United States. After she became pregnant, Maud and Frank settled down in a rented house, where she gave birth to Frank Joslyn in 1883. Complications arising from giving birth to her second son Robert Stanton in 1886 caused Maud to become afflicted with peritonitis. Ill for two years, she found solace in visiting her mother and siblings. In 1889 and 1891, she gave birth to Harry Neal and Kenneth Gage, respectively. Described by her children as a no-nonsense mother, Maud took charge of the family finances and the disciplining of her children. She was their primary caretaker because her husband's business obligations frequently led to his being away for weeks at a time. The family moved to Aberdeen, South Dakota, in 1888 because Maud wished to be near her brother and two sisters. After her husband was unable to sustain a living there, they moved to Chicago. Because of their dire financial situation, Maud also worked, teaching embroidery and lace-making. Beginning in 1900, her husband's best-selling picture book, Father Goose: His Book (first published in 1899), brought the family financial security that it had theretofore lacked. They began spending their summers at a cottage in Macatawa Park, Michigan. In November of that year, Frank transferred to Maud the literary rights of his most recent books, including Father Goose and From Kansas to Fairyland (later published as The Wonderful Wizard of Oz). By dint of Frank's literary successes, Maud and Frank were financially secure enough to tour Egypt and Europe for six months. Since Frank was frequently occupied with penning stories for his publishers, Maud was the one who wrote numerous letters home. These letters were later published in 1907 as In Other Lands Than Ours for friends and family. After Frank died, she authorized Ruth Plumly Thompson to write more Oz sequels and helped promote MGM's film The Wizard of Oz (1939). In 1953, she died at 91 years of age, surviving her husband by 34 years."

The couple has three children, Vanessa, Mark and Marcela Vargas Ruiz. During the administration Figueres Olsen (1994–1998) served as Minister of the Presidency, succeeding Rodrigo Oreamuno Blanco. Many observers, including major political figures within his own party, criticized the choice, pointing out that Vargas lacked the political skills needed for the job. During the second administration Arias Sánchez (2006–2010), Vargas served as the Agency Coordinating Minister . Vargas also assumed other ministerial posts during the same administration. He served as Minister of Production, replacing temporarily Alfredo Volio, who resigned from government to direct the campaign to approve the CAFTA-DR trade agreement in a referendum held for that purpose. He also replaced for several months Ms Karla González Carvajal, Minister of Public Works and Transport."

Her diagnosis and search for a bone marrow or stem cell transplant resulted in bone marrow drives being held at Yale and in Canada. While bone marrow drives held at Yale University did not result in a match for Schwartz, they did result in six matches for other patients on the registry who were waiting for a transplant. She underwent a stem cell transplant from donated umbilical cord blood in September 2010. In December 2010, she learned that the cancer had returned and discontinued most forms of treatment. Schwartz died in Regina, Saskatchewan, at the age of 23."

  "text" : "Michael Magee (October 11, 1929 – July 15, 2011) was a Canadian actor and author. He was known for voicing Cyril Sneer and his pet dog Snag in the Canadian animated series The Raccoons. and the voice for The Coach on the CBC show, Yes You Can. He was also well known for his alter-ego that he created in the 1970s known as Fred C. Dobbs. Dobbs first came to the public's attention when a daily telephone call from a crotchety commentator enlivened the Bruno Gerussi network radio program. In the mid-to-late 1970s, Magee starred in a series for Toronto's TVOntario called Magee & Company, in which he played numerous characters, including Dobbs. In 1973, he created the show The Real Magees, where he and his wife Duddie were the hosts of this weekday, half-hour talk show, chatting informally with non-celebrities, such as a cab driver, ambulance driver and nightclub bouncer. Bob Weinstein produced the series in Montreal for Screen Gems and CBC Television. He went on to work as a writer, producer, and commentator for the CBC racing telecasts from 1964 to 1986. The network won the Sovereign Award for outstanding film/video/broadcast in 1985. An avid racing historian, Magee authored the book, “Champions,” in collaboration with Pat Bayes, which was published in 1980. He also was a renowned handicapper and one of his last official connections with racing was as the host of “Racing With Magee,” a daily radio show that aired in the mid-1990s. Magee died on July 15, 2011. He was 81. Magee had been suffering from colitis, which led to internal bleeding and heart stoppage. He is survived by his partner Sally Hamilton, his sister-in-law Maggie Magee and his step children Matthew, Kelly and her husband Stephen and their children Monet, Quincy, Madeleine, Samantha and Hannah."

  "text" : "Mark Nepo (born February 23, 1951, in Brooklyn, New York), is a poet and philosopher who has taught in the fields of poetry and spirituality for over 30 years. Nepo is best known for his New York Times #1 bestseller, The Book of Awakening. He has published 12 books and recorded six audio projects. A cancer survivor, Nepo writes and teaches about the journey of inner transformation and the life of relationship. Nepo has a doctorate in English. He taught for 18 years at the State University of New York in Albany, New York. He then moved to Kalamazoo, Michigan. In his 30s he was diagnosed with a rare form of lymphoma, a struggle which helped to form his philosophy of experiencing life fully while staying in relationship to an unknowable future. In 2010 Oprah Winfrey chose Nepo's Book of Awakening as one of her Ultimate Favorite Things for her farewell season, launching it to the #1 spot on the New York Times bestseller list. Nepo has appeared several times with Oprah Winfrey on her Super Soul Sunday program on OWN TV. He was also interviewed by Robin Roberts on Good Morning America. Oprah has also written about Nepo twice in her O! magazine column, \"What I Know for Sure\" (most recently in April 2011). His recent book, Seven Thousand Ways to Listen (2012) won the Books for A Better Life Award."

In 1992 he went to Antioch College in Ohio to start a regional theatre company; he died of AIDS in Dayton, Ohio on November 25, 1993. Worman's papers, including voluminous research on the history of The Cockettes, served as a basis for a documentary and book about the group. and were later acquired by the New York Public Library for the Performing Arts."

  "text" : "Girolomo \"Momo\" Adamo (1895–1956) was an Italian American mobster in the American Mafia. He lived in Chicago and Kansas City before moving to Los Angeles in the 1930s and soon became underboss to Jack Dragna in the Los Angeles crime family. His brother Joseph Adamo was also a member of the crime family. Both he and his brother were well connected criminals in San Diego, working with such mobsters as Frank Bompensiero. In 1950, Momo was arrested along with several members of Jack Dragna's family including Tom Dragna (brother), Louis Dragna (nephew), and two men named Frank Paul Dragna (his son and nephew, respectively) after Jack fled the state after being named in the California Crime Commission report as a member of a crime syndicate in Los Angeles. The five of them were taken into custody by the Los Angeles Police Department, who believed they were responsible for bombing Mickey Cohen's home or knew who was. They were all released without being charged when the police couldn't find evidence of their involvement (Tom built the bomb, but otherwise none of them were involved). When Jack Dragna died in 1956, the Los Angeles crime family cast a vote to see who would become the next boss. Momo was hoping that as a long time leader he would be elected. However, lawyer-turned-mobster Frank DeSimone was elected in what is believed to be a rigged election. He demoted Adamo and Adamo moved to San Diego shortly after. In the same year, Adamo attempted a murder–suicide by shooting his wife in the head before shooting himself. However, his wife ended up surviving. The reason for the killing isn't confirmed, but according to an unidentified police informant, Adamo's actions were out of shame from DeSimone raping Adamo's wife while being forced to watch. Adamo's wife was having an affair during their marriage and an alternative theory given is that Adamo committed these actions after finding out about it. His wife Marie, who never talked about the incident publicly, recovered and later married Frank Bompensiero."

  "text" : "Makarand Waingankar is an ex-cricket administrator and cricket columnist based in Mumbai, India. He was the CEO of the Baroda Cricket Association and served in various positions with other BCCI organs. As consultant to the Karnataka State Cricket Association in 2001, he set up a Talent Resource Development Wing (TRDW) to spot talent in rural districts in Karnataka, away from the established urban centre of Bangalore. This initiative was successful, and was replicated nationwide by the BCCI in 2002, when Jagmohan Dalmiya was President. The TRDW Chairman was ex-India test captain Dilip Vengsarkar, assisted by Brijesh Patel. The TRDW helped discover many successful players, including present India captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni, Suresh Raina, Irfan Pathan, RP Singh, VRV Singh, and others. Waingankar was contracted to set up a TRDW for the Indian Premier League franchise Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) in 2009, the second IPL season, to spot talent nationwide. However after doing the initial groundwork, he resigned from his position due to strong disagreements with the controversial then KKR coach, John Buchanan, over team selection and John's \"multiple captains\" theory. Waingankar also works closely with Dilip Vengsarkar and helped establish the Elf-Vengsarkar Cricket Academy in Mumbai. In the late 80s, Bombay's Ranji Trophy team was very strong in batting, but lacked in the bowling department. To counter this, Waingankar played a pivotal role in setting up the BCA-Mafatlal Bowling Scheme in 1990, in which budding bowlers were trained by renowned English fast bowler Frank Tyson. Abey Kuruvilla, Paras Mhambrey, Sairaj Bahutule, Salil Ankola and Nilesh Kulkarni are some of the bowlers who emerged from the academy, many of whom became regular India players through the 1990s."

  "text" : "Yogi Minocher K. Spencer was a Parsi author and spiritual healer who lived in Karachi, Pakistan where he also worked as a metal merchant. Spencer was born in Pune, Maharashtra, India on October 4, 1888 and died August 30, 1958. He claimed that he was guided by the spirit of a deceased guru, Rishi Ram Ram, and later by Sai Baba of Shirdi (also deceased). He claimed to have attained 'Jeevan Mukti' during his life. He wrote a number of books that were published posthumously, including: \n* How I found God \n* The other world \n* Joyous mysticism \n* great mystics saints of the world \n* Understanding the divine mysteries \n* Romance of the soul (1954) The most important of his books is \"How I found God\". In this book, Spencer wrote all his experiences first hand. His cousin H. Spencer also helped him in his journey to God.His life can be divided in different phases according to spiritual development. His life changed in 1930 when he met a mystic in Lahore. That mysterious person with occult powers told him that he had hidden spiritual powers of becoming a medium. He started writing articles in local newspaper on weekly basis where he was criticised by few persons of theosophical society for his view for spirituality. Later he met a lady in London which catalysed his spiritual growth. In his second phase of intensification of love for God, he came in contact with \"spiritual healing center, Coimbatore (South India)\". Rishi Ram Ram was spiritual guide of thet center at that time. Rishi Ram Ram was born 2500 years ago in Orissa, India. He was living in spiritual plane at that time and helping souls eager to know God's love. Rishi Ram Ram promised him to help. Later, in 1960 Rishi Ram Ram left spiritual plane and merged in God. M.K. Spencer was told to read holy scriptures and write spiritual stuff. He followed the same. During that time he wrote \"Oneness with God\"Slowly and steadily his desire of meeting God intensified. He used to spend more and more time in his altar room. His meditation sessions started early in morning 2 AM and lasted late in night. He forgot his daily mundane work and worries. Later Rish Ram Ram handed him over to Shirdi Sai Baba, saint of the saints. Sai baba helped him in achieving the perfection and purity required to meet god."

Since the late 20th century, the case has been investigated by a history professor at Tulane University, by the FBI beginning in 2007 as part of its review of civil rights-era cold cases, and in 2011 by CBS 60 Minutes; all point to Allen's having been killed by Daniel Jones, then the county sheriff. No one has been prosecuted for the murder. Allen was among a dozen witnesses of the murder of Herbert Lee by E.H. Hurst, a white state legislator, in September 1961. Civil rights activists had come to Liberty that summer to organize for voter registration; essentially no black had been allowed to vote since 1890, when the state disfranchising constitution was passed."

A member of the Kalhor tribe of Kermanshah, he initially followed the typical tribal path, learning horsemanship and sharpshooting. He gained an interest in calligraphy as a child, and left the tribe for further training. During his career, he introduced several innovations to Nastaʿlīq calligraphy, changing both the aesthetics and mechanics of the technique. Kalhor modified and adapted Nastaʿlīq to be easily used with printing machines and newspaper lithography, which in turn helped wide dissemination of his transcripts. He also devised methods for teaching Nastaʿlīq and specified clear proportional rules for it, which many could follow. He died of cholera in Tehran at age 65, having sired nine children and taught many calligraphy students, several of whom went on to become notable in their own right. He was buried in Ḥasanābād cemetery."

Her work has been characterized by a certain re-reading of the formal and aesthetic categories of avant-gardes and post-avant-garde movements, problematized at the sites and within the horizons of heterotopias. Her production is intimately related to a certain expanded vision of the notion of modernity, maintaining a relationship both with what this means in Latin America, particularly in Mexico, and with the implication this has for her formal explorations as a critical moment in the aesthetic-political structure of modernity and late modernity."

  "text" : "Fertik earned a degree from Harvard Law School. While earning his undergraduate, he co-founded and sold a software company called TruExchange. After he graduated, he served as a clerk for the Sixth Circuit of the United States Court of Appeals. During his position with the court, he was reading media stories about cyber-bullying and the effect it had people's lives in the real world. According to Fertik, \"I noticed something about the Internet that really bothered me: Anyone could say anything about anybody with impunity. Right or wrong, true or false, outdated or misleading — it didn’t matter.\" He turned down a job offer he had in Washington and moved to Silicon Valley to start Reputation.com (formerly ReputationDefender) in 2006. Reputation.com issues take down requests to websites hosting content that is embarrassing to their client. At a larger cost it attempts to influence search rankings to obtain a higher position for positive information or a lower position for negative content. Reputation.com raised $67 million in venture capital. Originally it was intended for parents that wanted to protect their children's online reputation, but it ended up being professionals that were primarily interested in the service. As social media became more prevalent, it introduced more features for it. Fertik became known for pioneering the field of online reputation management. According to Forbes he \"more or less invented the sector of online reputation management.\" He was named \"Entrepreneur of the Year\" by TechAmerica in 2010 and became a regular commenter on internet privacy issues in national broadcast media. In 2010 Fertik co-authored a book with David Thompson entitled \"Wild West 2.0: How to Protect and Restore Your Online Reputation on the Untamed Social Frontier\". Fertik is on the Global Agenda Council on Internet Security for the World Economic Forum. He also blogs for the Harvard Business Review, and maintains a guest column for Inc. Magazine. Fertik also participates in and provides direction for various advocacy programs. He sits on the Advisory Boards of the Internet Keepsafe Coalition (iKeepSafe) and the Future of Privacy Forum."

He left for the Netherlands. In January 1944 Roman was transported to Theresienstadt concentration camp. In summer 1944 he was forced to participate in a propaganda film in Theresienstadt which the commandant Rahm had coerced the actor Kurt Gerron to direct. Roman appeared leading his Ghetto Swingers. When the filming was over Roman and Gerron were sent to Auschwitz, where Gerron perished. Like jazz drummer and guitarist Coco Schumann, Roman survived. Gerron and clarinetist Fritz Weiss of the Jazz-Quintet-Weiss did not. His \"Wir reiten auf hölzernen Pferden\" was recorded on Terezín - Theresienstadt (Anne Sofie von Otter album)."

  "text" : "Magda Spiegel (1887–1944) was a German contralto who was a member of the Frankfurt Opera ensemble and was murdered in the Auschwitz concentration camp. The baritone Richard Breitenfeld, also of the Frankfurt Opera, shared the same fate. Peter Hugh Reed wrote in American Record Guide, 1949: I have also learned with the deepest regret about the similar death of the contralto Magda Spiegel, from Frankfurt. She made some excellent acoustic records in the early 1920s for Odeon, Vox and Homochard – I remember her as a thrilling Adriano in Wagner's Rienzi when the Frankfurt opera company visited Holland in 1934."

He is known for his research on basic developmental processes at work within the mother-infant relationship. Using animal models, he found unexpected neurobiological and behavioral regulatory processes within the observable interactions of the infant rat and its mother. Through an experimental analysis of these sensorimotor, thermal and nutrient-based processes, he has contributed to our understanding of the impact of early maternal separation, the origins of the attachment system, and the shaping of later development by variations in how mothers and infants interact."

  "text" : "Max Lock (1909–1988) was a British postwar urban planner who emphasised the importance of incorporating social research in the planning process. His most notable contributions were associated with planning in Middlesbrough, where he worked with Griselda Rowntree and Ruth Glass on the 1944 Middlesbrough Survey, and Hull. Lock's Hull work achieved acclaim with a 1943 London exhibition at the Housing Centre opened by the Minister of Town and Country Planning and in The Architects' Journal. Darling and Whitworth describe Lock's approach to planning as the most Geddesian of the post-war planners in the UK. Other key features of his approach were to include considerations of a town's hinterland in the planning process, to incorporate insights from other disciplines, to blend both physical and social aspects, using surveys, interviews, community involvement, map overlays, topic reports, and photographs. This was a process involving Civic Diagnosis. The aim was to achieve workable and acceptable plans. This could be achieved by having the public closely involved in a consultation process and making presentations accessible to them and to the press. The Max Lock Centre at the University of Westminster is named in his honour and holds his archive."

Having started off with six sewing machines and six employees in a barn, the company had annual sales of 1.7 billion Euros in 2009, and 37’515 employees. Still family owned, by now the multinational manufacturing and marketing organization operates in 120 countries around the globe. It is one of the leading underwear companies in the world and sells its product primarily under the core brands Triumph®, sloggi®, Valisère® and HOM®.

Thenceforth Marinus withdrew from communion with those Arians who followed Dorotheus and, with a group of followers who grew numerous enough to be considered a distinct sect of Arians, maintained a rival network of churches and oratories. The sect held, in contrast to the Arians under Dorotheus, that 'the Father had always been the Father, even when the son was not.' The sect became known as the Psathyrians as one of its most prominent champions, one Theoctistus, was by profession a cake-seller (ψαθυροπώλης). The schism between the sects would be healed by the former consul Plinta during the reign of Theodosius II. Marinus of Thrace succeeded Demophilus, the leader of the Arians at Constantinople; but he was superseded by Dorotheus, who soon after arrived from Antioch in Syria, and who was considered by his sect to be better qualified for the office than Marinus."

  "text" : "Matthew (died 1199) was the Archbishop of Capua from 1183, when he succeeded Alfanus of Camerota. He supported the claim to the Sicilian kingdom of Constance and her husband, the Emperor Henry VI, against that of the reigning monarch, Tancred of Lecce. Under Henry, he became a royal advisor and imperial familiaris (courtier) at the court in Palermo. After the cities of Aversa and Capua briefly rebelled against Tancred in 1191, it was probably Matthew who persuaded them to surrender without a fight to Henry. In 1198 Constance placed the Jewry of Capua, thitherto under royal protection, under the protection of the archbishop as a reward for Matthew's loyalty. He was also praised by Henry's panegyrist, Peter of Eboli, in his Liber ad honorem Augusti (\"Book Honouring the Emperor\")."

He set a personal best of 2:10:30 hours at the Frankfurt Marathon, coming second behind fellow Kenyan Wilfred Kigen. His single major race of 2007 was the Berlin Marathon but he did not manage to reach the top ten. He significantly improved his best at the Paris Marathon in April 2008 as he duelled against Tsegaye Kebede up to the 40 km and although he ended up as the runner-up to the Ethiopian he recorded a time of 2:06:50 hours. He set a half marathon best of 1:01:31 at the Rotterdam Half Marathon later that year and went on to run at the Chicago Marathon, where he came in thirteenth place. He ran two marathons in South Korea in 2009. In March he claimed his first victory since 2006 at the Seoul International Marathon, defeating high calibre opposition with a run of 2:07:54 hours. He managed only fourth, however, at the less-established Gyeongju International Marathon in October. He missed the 2010 season but returned with good form to take the title at the Madrid Marathon in April 2011. He defeated the defending champion, Thompson Cherogony, and his time of 2:10:58 hours was a race record for the hilly course."

  "text" : "Marilyn A. Brown is an American geographer on the faculty of the Georgia Institute of Technology and is a member of the Tennessee Valley Authority board of directors. During her prior career at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), she held various leadership positions managing programs focused on energy efficiency, renewable energy, and the electric grid. At ORNL, Dr. Brown co-led the report, Scenarios for a Clean Energy Future, which remains a cornerstone of engineering-economic analysis of low-carbon energy options for the United States. While at ORNL, she and Eric Hirst coined the term \"energy efficiency gap\" in a 1990 article on \"Closing the Efficiency Gap: Barriers to the Efficient Use of Energy.\" The term refers to the unexploited economic potential for energy efficiency, and it has attracted wide attention among energy analysts. Marilyn Brown is a national leader in the analysis and interpretation of energy futures in the United States. Her work has had significant visibility in the policy arena as evidenced by her briefings and testimonies before Committees of the U.S. House of Representatives and the U.S. Senate. Marilyn Brown co-founded the Southeast Energy Efficiency Alliance and chaired its first Board of Directors for several years. She also served on the boards of directors of the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy and the Alliance to Save Energy, and was a member of the National Commission on Energy Policy for many years. She has served on six National Academies committees including the Board of Energy and Environmental Systems. She serves on the editorial board of the Journal of Energy Efficiency and the journal Energy Research and Social Science. In 2010, Dr. Brown was sworn onto the Board of Directors of the Tennessee Valley Authority, the nation’s largest public power provider, following her nomination by President Barack Obama. She was renominated and began a second term in 2013. At Georgia Tech, Dr. Brown created and leads the Climate and Energy Policy Laboratory (CEPL), and advises students in the Environment and Energy Policy concentration in the School of Public Policy. CEPL supports this effort by conducting research on global energy security, clean energy employment, policies to promote energy efficiency, renewable energy policies and trends in the U.S. South, smart grid policies, and demand response. CEPL is involved in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, and policy interests span the triad of climate mitigation, climate adaptation, and geo-engineering. CEPL analyzes climate change and energy policies using software tools including the National Energy Modeling System (NEMS), hybrid NEMS-Input/Output approaches, and Monte Carlo methods to characterize uncertainties. These models are used to evaluate the speed and market penetration of new and improved energy technologies, and the ability of possible future policies to accelerate technology adoption."

He was a prominent figure of the party in Homs in the 1940s. During three years he served as an envoy of the party to Europe, working at the World Peace Council in Prague and Vienna. In 1968, the party leader Khalid Bakdash suffered a heart attack and was flown to Moscow for medical treatment. In Bakdash's absence Salibi was elected new party general secretary in September 1968. However, after the election a series of meetings of party leaders were held (in which the Soviet embassy in Damascus participated), and the election of Salibi was annulled. Salibi resigned from the post, and Yusuf Faisal was elected new provisional general secretary. A few months later Bakdash returned and reassumed his role as general secretary of the party. Salibi retained his seat in the party Central Committee, though. When the Syrian Communist Party was divided in two in 1986, Salibi sided with Yusuf Faisal's faction. He remained a Politburo member of the Faisal-led Communist Party."

White claimed that many key elements of Reservoir Dogs were borrowed from City on Fire, a claim he later illustrated via his own short film, Who Do You Think You're Fooling?, while Rotten Tomatoes attempted to do the same via one of their \"Homage or Stealing?\" features. In 2010, White also recently released a collection of his Cashiers du Cinemart articles and interviews in book form as Impossibly Funky: A Cashiers du Cinemart Collection. In 2011, White began co-hosting a film podcast titled The Projection Booth. In July 2013, White broke the story of Lianne \"Spiderbaby\" MacDougall plagiarizing articles. In October 2014, BearManor Media released White's book Mad Movies with the L.A. Connection."

Her husband, Robert Raymond Reid, served as the territorial governor of Florida from 1839 to 1841. Mary Reid was born in St. Mary's, Georgia, to James and Mary Thorpe Smith. She married Robert Reid,who was a federal judge, on November 29, 1836, after meeting him during a visit to St. Augustine, Florida earlier that year. They had two sons, William and Raymond. Her husband died in 1841, and their son William died the following year. Following her husband's death, Reid worked as a schoolteacher in Jacksonville and Fernandina. Her surviving son Raymond enlisted in the 2nd Florida Infantry May 23, 1861, and Mary Martha Reid's wish to be near him made her a nurse. Together with Dr. Thomas M. Palmer, Mary Martha Reid opened a 150-bed hospital in Richmond in September 1862 to treat Confederate soldiers from Florida. With Reid serving as its matron, the hospital treated over a thousand men in its first year of operation. Her requests for donations and supplies as well as letters of thanks to organizations that contributed aid to the hospital were printed in Florida newspapers, and her nursing work earned her the nickname, \"Mother of the Florida Boys.\" Tragically, Lt. Raymond Reid died of wounds received in the Battle of the Wilderness on May 7, 1864. He was buried by his mother in Richmond. The first Florida chapter of United Daughters of the Confederacy was named in Mary Reid's honor."

Her body was found February 14, 2011, wrapped in a plastic garbage bag in the bed of her adoptive father's pickup truck on the side of I-95 in West Palm Beach, Florida. Her body had partially decomposed from being covered in chemicals, possibly pesticides. Her twin brother, Victor Docter Barahona, was in the cab of the truck with his father, suffering seizures from chemical burns and inhalation of toxic gas. Her adoptive parents Jorge and Carmen Barahona were indicted on charges of first-degree murder, aggravated child abuse and child neglect on March 23, 2011. They face the death penalty if convicted. The case has sparked outrage from Florida citizens and officials regarding the Florida Department of Children and Families' handling of previous allegations of abuse by the Barahonas."

Found in 1722, mining gold on the edge of the stream of Prainha, in Mato Grosso, Brazil, near what is now the Church of Nossa Senhora do Rosário e São Benedito (Cuiabá), establishing there a small mine which soon grows due to the large displacement of both the fork and other regions. Several monsoons begin to supply the region. The work was performed primarily by slaves and free men. From the banks of the Cuiabá River, began exploring the region where the city of Cuiabá began. Silva Leme describes his family in volume 1, page 59 in front of their \"Paulistana Genealogy\". These gold mines were initially known as \"pits of Subtle\" and then mine the \"Senhor Bom Jesus do Cuiabá\", discovered by chance by the Indians in the camp of Miguel Sutil.Mines of Cuiabá attracted adventurers from various regions, most obviously those of the captaincy of São Vicente. They were mainly miners, cowboys and monçoeiros, all in search of quick riches. The Lavras do Subtle, is currently the District Chest in downtown Cuiabá.Their remains together as the pioneer of Pascoal Moreira Cabral Leme are buried in the crypt of the Cathedral Church of the \"Senhor Bom Jesus do Cuiabá\"."

After an uneventful early education, he took his honours in Literature, from the Madras Christian College. His literary talents were first discovered, in the College Magazine. He began his professional career at a humorous weekly publication, The Merry Magazine of Madras. He soon moved to The Mail, a Madras daily, but continued to contribute to the Merry Maqazine. Later, he worked in Washington, Singapore, Burma, Libya and various locations in the Middle East and North Africa. While serving as a U.N. delegate in Korea in 1950, he was killed by a mine explosion. A memorial dedicated to him is sited at Waegwan, South Korea. An obituary published by the government of India said: The Government of India have learnt, with deep regret, of the death of Colonel Unni Nayar, one of India’s alternate Delegates to the U.N. Commission in Korea. Colonel Nayar was killed by a mine explosion while out for observation. Colonel Nayar’s early promise in journalism reached destination during the Second World War in which he saw duty on many fronts. His work in reporting these campaigns was marked by vivid objectivity and great personal gallantry. He also served as an Observer during the operation in Kashmir. In 1948, he was posted to Washington as Public Relations Officer of the Indian Embassy, in which capacity he did valuable work. On the outbreak of hostilities in Korea, he volunteered for service there and the Government of India selected him to serve as an alternate Delegate on the U.N. Korean Commission. His dispatches from there proved invaluable to Government in forming an appreciation of the Korean situation. His early and tragic death in no less a loss to the Government of India than to his family, to whom Government extend their profound sympathy."

  "text" : "Moses Garu (born December 1, 1969 in Isunavutu, West Guadalcanal, Guadalcanal Province) is a Solomon Islands politician. With diplomas in tropical agriculture and in secondary teaching, he has worked in public service, as a school teacher, and in banking. He was a bank manager at the time of the severe ethnic conflicts on Guadalcanal and Malaita in the early 2000s. In May 2000, he was attacked by members of the Malaita Eagle Force with machetes and axes. They allegedly attempted to behead him, leaving him with a permanent \"puckered scar on his right jaw running on down his neck\". Jimmy \"Rasta\" Lusibaea, one of the leaders of the Eagle Force, was among those charged with attempting to murder Garu, but charges were dropped when \"witnesses failed to testify\". Garu's political career began when he was elected MP for West Guadalcanal in the August 2010 general election, representing the Democratic Party. Lusibaea was also elected to Parliament for the first time in that election, as an Independent, resulting in the two men sitting across from each other in the assembly. They \"spoke at length\" after the election, and were reported to have \"put their past to rest\", with Garu expressing no resentment over what had happened during the conflicts. With the Democratic Party becoming the main Opposition party, Garu was appointed Shadow Minister for Rural Development and Indigenous Affairs in Opposition Leader Steve Abana's Shadow Cabinet. In February 2011, however, he and two other Opposition members defected to Prime Minister Danny Philip's government majority, stating that they wished to help pass the budget and defend the interests of their respective constituencies. On April 18, he was appointed Minister for Mines, Energy and Rural Electrification. On November 9, 2011, he resigned and rejoined the Opposition, as part of a mass defection which brought down the Philip government two days later. Gordon Darcy Lilo replaced Philip as Prime Minister on November 16, and reappointed Garu to his previous position five days later."

In December 1996, he participated in a student protest, and following the closing of Burma's universities, remaining involved in the pro-democracy movement. On 12 September 1998, he was arrested along with Ko Aye Aung for distributing fliers and organizing student demonstrations in Yangon. Both Ko Aye Aung and Myo Min Zaw alleged that they were subsequently tortured in custody. At a press conference on 8 October 1998, the government announced that they had discovered a plot by Myo Min Zaw to “create disturbances in support of the National League for Democracy demand to convene parliament and to object to the ongoing university and college examinations”. Ko Aye Aung and Myo Min Zaw were reportedly denied legal representation at their trial, which was held in Insein prison; nor, according to the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners, were they allowed to speak in their own defense. Amnesty International further argued that the fairness of their trial was compromised by the press conference given by Burmese officials, in which they presumed the guilt of the two detainees in advance of their trial. Both men were found guilty, and the court ordered that the sentences for each charge must be served cumulatively, rather than concurrently. As a result, Ko Aye Aung was sentenced to a 59-year prison term, which he is currently serving in Kale prison in Burma's northwestern Sagaing Region; Myo Min Zaw was sentenced to 52 years, which he served four in Bassein (Pathein) Prison, East Bassein Township, Irrawaddy Division, prior to his release. According to the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners, Myo Min Zaw was pardoned on 13 January 2012, as part of a series of amnesties for political prisoners."

  "text" : "Mauricio Sotelo (born 2 October 1961 in Madrid), is a Spanish composer. The Spanish composer and conductor Mauricio Sotelo begun his musical studies as a self-taught learner with the guitar, and later at the Real Conservatorio de Música de Madrid. In 1979 he moves to Wien to study at the Universität für Musik. Four years later, after finishing his cours with Dieter Kaufmann, among others, he's admitted in the Chair of Composition commanded by Francis Burt –Sotelo will devoted him the piece De Vinculis: Ge-Burt. A Francis Burt (2001) for violin– and, decisively for him, in Roman Haubenstock-Ramati's Seminars, to conclude this academic period in 1987, being awarded the Prize of Honour for graduated studies. During his time in Wien (1979–1992) Sotelo works, creates (…et l'avare silence (1988), among others) and participates, together with Beat Furrer, in the naissance of the Societé de l'Art acoustique, later known as Klangforum Wien. This group has to be considered a sort of 'fetish' ensemble to Sotelo because of two reasons: first, the personal relationship with Furrer and the musicians; second, the close and continuous work with them to create many pieces, from the Trio Basso – a R.H.R. (1988–89) to Klangmuro... I (2009) for flute, double bass and ensemble. In Vienna he also studied electroacoustic music with Dieter Kaufmann and conducting with Karl Österreicher. Also at this time, Sotelo also came into contact with Luigi Nono, a composer who excerses a lively influence in his musical thought, today even stronger than at those years. He also met the poet José Ángel Valente (Orense, 1929-Geneva, 2000) -an unavoidable figure to comprehend Sotelo's catalogue between 1994 and 2000– at the end of the eighties. Already in Spain, after the successful première of Tenebræ Responsoria in the XXXII Semana de Música Religiosa de Cuenca (1993) with the cantaor Enrique Morente, Sotelo begins an important teaching activity. As invited professor, he participates in the Aula de Música at the University of Alcalá de Henares (1993–1995), in the Seminar of Composition at the Columbia University in Nueva York (1996), in the Summer Courses of Composition at the International Festival Órgano de León – widely known as Cursos in Villafranca del Bierzo– and, more recently, in the Seminar of Composition Casa da Musica in Oporto (2002), the Chair Manuel de Falla in Cádiz (2007) and the Course of Composition at the Conservatorio Superior de Música in Córdoba (2009). From the turn to the 21st century, Sotelo consolidates his career in contemporary music, being institutionally recognized and finishing many main pieces like the cicle Wall of light (2003–2007) -devoted to the figure of Sean Scully-, Sonetos del amor oscuro. Cripta sonora para Luigi Nono (2003–2005) and Muerte sin fin (2010), among others. Mauricio Sotelo has been awarded numerous prizes including the Composition Prize by the Joven Orquesta Nacional de España (1986), by the Sociedad General de Autores y Editores (1989) and by the WDR Forum Junger Komponisten (1992), the Ernst von Siemens Composer's Prize (1997), the Queen Sofia Prize of Composition (2000) and the Spanish National Music Prize (2001). He's been composer in residence at the Wissenschaftskolleg zu Berlin (2011–2012) –just where he met the composer Luigi Nono at the end of the eighties. He lives in Berlin and works today as a Professor of Composition at the Escola Superior de Música de Catalunya in Barcelona."

Baer learned basic commercial photography in Chicago but subsequently honed his skills as a World War II Navy combat photographer. Returning to civilian life an accomplished professional, over the next few years he developed into “one of the foremost architectural photographers in the world,\" receiving important commissions from some of the premier architects in post-war Central California. In the early 1970s, very much influenced by a strong friendship with Edward Weston, Baer began to concentrate on his personal landscape art photography. During the last decades of the 20th century, Baer also became a sought-after instructor in various colleges and workshops teaching the art of landscape photography."

Etching involves using copper plates on which an artist has etched or “bitten” his picture with acid. Color etchings like Bebb's require two to four copper plates, each is inked with one or more different colors and printed one over the other to produce the finished picture. Technically, the process is called multi-plate soft-ground and aquatint etching."

  "text" : "'-Max David Bacon' (1 March 1904, London, England, UK – 3 December 1969, London, England, UK) was a British actor, comedian and musician (drummer and occasional vocalist in Ambrose's band). Although he was British-born, his comedic style centred on his pseudo-European accent and in his straight-faced mispronunciation of words. He was the uncle of David Bacon (1933-2014) and the brother of Harry Bacon (1906-1959). David Bacon's wife gave the following information in 2016: \"David Bacon, who was my husband was born in London (Hendon, actually) in 1933 and died in 2014.  He lived his entire life in London.  He went to Highgate School and professionally was the Managing Director of Camellia PLC and in that capacity was the director of several art galleries.  Personally, he was basically the owner of Heywood Hill Bookstore in Mayfair for about 20 years.  He lived in Regent’s Park for the last 45 years of his life.  He was a passionate reader and supporter of Chelsea FB.  His father was Harry Bacon, 1906 - 1959 who was a businessman of various interests and the brother of Max Bacon, who was a drummer, and wrote ‘Max Bacon on Swing’ and a comedian, and you can see some old (perhaps tv shows?) on You Tube..  1904 - 1969.   There was a third brother, who I thought was named Sydney, but he was perhaps a cousin.\" Before becoming a charcter actor, Max Bacon was one of the most significant drummers in Britain during the 1920s and 30s. Allegedly taught by the vocalist Harry Bentley (who also played drums). After a couple of years at the Florida Club with Ronnie Munro's band he began a very long association with Ambrose's Orchestra (the Rolls Royce of British Dance Bands). Max can be heard on hundreds of records by Ambrose as part of his incredible rhythm section and occasionally as \"Yiddish\" vocalist. In the late 30s he had become well known enough to tour the halls in his own right and as part of a touring unit known as the Ambrose Octet with Evelyn Dall, Les Carew etc.Max was particularly associated with deft cymbal-work whipping up a storm in the many \"speciality\" instrumentals which are regarded by some as the pinnacle of British Jazz/swing between the wars. Cotton Picker's Congregation, Deep Henderson, man About Town, Night Ride are good examples."

After the war he was the Chair of the Modern History Department and the Department of Law and Administration at the University of Kraków (Jagiellonian University). He was moved by the communist authorities to the University of Poznań, a less prestigious institution, in 1949, because he was perceived as harboring \"anti-communist sympathies\"."

He also created a Youth Choir for girls between the ages of 15 and 23 and an instrumental ensemble to accompany the choirs where necessary. Furthermore, Pigazzini makes regular trips around Italy and Europe giving masterclasses on the Cantar Leggendo method, with his destinations including Greece, France, Germany, Andorra, Spain, Portugal, Switzerland and Belgium.

  "text" : "Mladen Juran (born 8 May 1942) is a Croatian film director, screenwriter and actor. Juran was born in Zagreb. He graduated from high school in Split in 1960. After obtaining a diploma from the Faculty of Economics at the University of Zagreb in 1964, he went to Paris, where he graduated from the Dramatic Arts College Charles Dullin at Théâtre National Populaire. During his study, he performed as an actor and worked with the theater, television and film, assisting directors Michael Cacoyannis, Abel Gance and Med Hondo. In 1967 he worked in Paris as an intern for Lee Strasberg, director of the Actors Studio. After his return to Croatia, Juran started a career at the national television. Since 1973, he created more than 200 films and television series of various genres. Juran's 18-minute short film Transatlantic (1982) - described as a \"surrealist depiction of tragic fate of the Croatian emigrant\" - received high acclaim, and has been listed among the best Croatian short films ever. Both before and after making the short film, Juran was trying to make a feature film with the same subject, but hints to political emigration were not seen as welcome, and Juran's idea was realized only after the fall of communism. The feature film of the same name, made in 1998, was also well-received, and was Croatia's submission for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film that year. Juran's 1982 documentary about the early history of Croatian cinematography, The Living Photographs (Živuće fotografije) has been credited with establishing a new perspective on the history of film in Croatia and influencing the education of future Croatian filmmakers and film scholars."

Takenaka was born in Beijing, China in 1925, and lived in China for his first ten years; his father worked for the South Manchuria Railway. He began his studies at Kyoto University, but was drafted into the Japanese army during World War II and sent to Hokkaido. After the war, he completed a degree in business and then studied theology at Doshisha. At the Yale Divinity School in Yale University, he was greatly influenced by H. Richard Niebuhr; he earned his doctorate there in 1955. He returned to Japan, where he became a volunteer leader of the United Church of Christ, and then served a term as vicar in Kurashiki before joining the Doshisha faculty. Takenaka was a proponent of ecumenism, an opponent of the concept of the divinity of the Emperor of Japan, and (later in his life) a promoter of Christian art. He also worked to fit Christian theology more closely to indigenous culture in Asia, for instance by defining God as the \"rice of life\" instead of as the \"bread of life\"."

  "text" : "Sir Marmaduke Lloyd (1585–c.1651) was a Welsh lawyer and landowner and a supporter of King Charles I of England during the English Civil War. Lloyd was the son of Thomas Lloyd, a precentor at St David's Cathedral, and the nephew of Marmaduke Middleton, who was Bishop of St David's from. Having studied at Oriel College, Oxford, and Middle Temple, he qualified as a barrister in 1608. He married Mary Stedman, and the family eventually settled at Maesyfelin, near Lampeter. Lloyd held the position of King's Attorney for the Marches from 1614, in which year he was also appointed to the Council of Wales and the Marches. Knighted in 1622, he became puisne justice of Chester in the same year, and chief justice of the Brecknock circuit in 1636. Official records suggest that he made frequent visits to Shrewsbury. In 1645 he was taken prisoner at Hereford by Parliamentary forces, and remained in custody until 1647. At the Battle of St Fagans in 1648, he was again taken prisoner. The date of his will suggests that he died in 1651. The poet Henry Vaughan at one time served as secretary to Sir Marmaduke. The eldest of Sir Marmaduke's three sons, Sir Francis Lloyd, also a Royalist, was an MP before the war and regained a position of favour following the Restoration of King Charles II of England."

  "text" : "Maggio was born in Houston, Texas and raised there as well attending high school at Jeff Davis High School. When Marty was just a child his mother Ann Maggio would trade her spaghetti to Marty’s music teacher Michael Spompanato for clarinet lessons. Soon after Marty turned his attention to the Saxophone and that was it. At age 16 Marty joined his first band called the PerryMates, headed by Clarence Perry. While with the PerryMates Marty and the band hooked up with Roy Orbison and they even auditioned at Orbison’s house. He hired them and they toured with him for some time. After Marty finally parted with PerryMates and Roy Orbison he ended up recording some tracks with the Nashville Horns and Elvis Presley. Marty’s main work with Elvis was playing backup on his I washed my Hands in Muddy Water track. Marty’s next big run in was when he realized a friend of his by the name of Richard Kemp knew Boots Randolph well. Richard hooked up Marty and Boots and it was magic. When Boots heard how good Marty’s version of “Yackety Sax” was he then invited Marty up on stage to play with him. Together they did a double sax version of the song and this was said to be the first time Boots ever invited another sax player to play with him. Next Marty hooked up with another Nashville musician by the name of Jim Vest, leader of the Nashville Cats. Marty started with the Cats in 1972 and was involved in more recording sessions. In 1976 Marty decided to return to Houston and get back into circulation in his hometown. Marty cut about half a dozen cd’s such as Sax Tradition, Simple things, Jump Jives and Wail and his newest release “YES” Country which was released just months before his death. Marty was also said to be in negotiations to play Sax on American Idol performer John Wayne Shultz album, On April 25, 2011 at 61 years of age Marty unexpectedly died of a possible heart attack."

  "text" : "Marco Visconti (born June 4, 1978) is a musician, producer, and DJ known for his work with the Anglo-Italian band XP8. Visconti was born in Rome, Italy. In 2001 he formed XP8 with Marko Resurreccion and Paul Toohill. Visconti contributed to the band with songwriting, synth production and arrangements till XP8's eventual split in 2014. He is also a DJ focused on Industrial dance music, and the underground Electronic Dance scene in general, having played all over the globe during his fifteen years career. In 2006, he joined two other acts, Unter Null and Grendel, as member of the live lineup of each band. The collaboration with Unter Null did not last long, as he left the band after 6 months on October 28 after a concert held during the Swedish Tinnitus Festival: the split was on friendly terms. Visconti's collaboration with Grendel ended in 2009 to allow him to concentrate once again more on XP8. In early 2007, he was then recruited by VNV Nation as keyboard player for their Judgement world tour. At the end of the tour he returned to Rome, where he resumed DJ duties in the various underground clubs of the city. In 2008 he joined the Faderhead live band, and provided additional production to the song \"Another Dead Boy\" on Faderhead's third studio album \"FH3\", and then to the songs \"Baby Firefly\" and \"Beautiful Freak\" on the follow-up, \"Black Friday\". In the following years, his role as additional producer would grow and become a staple in Faderhead's releases. Visconti received numerous nicknames since he joined Faderhead, the most well-known being \"The Lord\". Marco's other interests include Thelema, Gnosticism, and Freemasonry. Italian's science-fiction and counter-culture author Francesco Dimitri, also a well-known neo-pagan, was inspired by Visconti's online persona to create Dagon, a signature character featured in Dimitri's novels. He currently resides in London, UK, where he moved in early 2013."

During the reign of Ŭijong (1146-1170), the government relaxed the restrictions toward slaves and eunuchs by allowing them to take low offices, which caused some governmental irregularities. In the reign of Myŏngjong (1170-1197) also saw the rise of the status of slaves. In 1197, Choe Chung-heon forced Myŏngjong to abdicate, put Sinjong on the throne, and became a military ruler with de facto control. During his government, Choe Chung-heon was less tolerant toward slaves, and several incidents involving slaves occurred in different places in Goryeo. Manjǒk and some other slaves plotted a rebellion in 1198 against their masters in Kaesong, the capital of Goryeo. A speech of his that questioned inequality was recorded in the history book Goryeosa (고려사; 高麗史). Another slave revealed the plot to his own master, and the plot failed. Manjǒk and many other slaves were executed."

He moved to England before July 1688, where he engraved portraits, book illustrations, and architectural prints. He trained his sons Gerard Vandergucht (1696/7–1776) and Jan Vandergucht (or John) (c.1699-c.1730) as engravers, and also George Vertue. He died at his house in his house, the Golden Head in Queen Street, Bloomsbury, and was buried in the churchyard of St Giles-in-the-Fields. Michael kept to a restrained form of engraving, without etching, but was surpassed by his son Gerard, who became one of the leading engravers in London, following the French method of combining precise engraving with the etched tones. Gerard had over 30 children, including Benjamin Vandergucht, a painter and art dealer."

Her murder sparked calls to sangomas to stop murdering children for their body parts. Kgomo went missing near her home in Soshanguve, a township north of Pretoria, on 31 December 2009. Five people were initially charged with her kidnapping and murder. A suspect led police to Kgomo's body in Soshanguve in the early hours of 9 January 2010. On 28 November 2011, Judge Billy Mothle found 30-year-old Brian Mangwale guilty of her murder and kidnapping in the Pretoria High Court. Mangwale was sentenced to life imprisonment for her murder and six years imprisonment for her kidnapping."

  "text" : "Marjorie Gordon (12 November 1893 – 14 October 1983) was an English actress and singer. Gordon was born in Southsea, Portsmouth, Hampshire as Marjorie Kettlewell. Her professional stage career began in 1915 on tour in the chorus of the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company. The next season, she was given the roles of the Plaintiff in Trial by Jury and Lady Psyche in Princess Ida. She also understudied and occasionally played the title role in Patience and Yum-Yum in The Mikado. She left D'Oyly Carte in June 1916 to understudy the role of Sylvia Dale at the Adelphi Theatre in London in the Rudolf Friml musical High Jinks, sometimes appearing in the role until July 1917 and touring in the role later that year. Gordon starred in the title role in the romantic comic opera Valentine at the St. James's Theatre from January to April 1918. She next starred as Grace in the hit musical Going Up (1918–1919) at London's Gaiety Theatre. She then appeared in the Ivor Novello musical Who's Hooper? at the Adelphi Theatre (1919–1920). Next, she appeared in My Nieces at the Aldwych Theatre, London, in 1921. She also recorded songs from Going Up and Who's Hooper?. For the next two decades, she appeared in both musicals and plays. These included Stop Flirting (1923). She later appeared in a few films, playing Ruth Hopkins in Danger Trails (1935), Matron in All the Way to Paris (1967) and Passenger in Golden Rendezvous (1977). Later stage roles included Midge in Tulip Time in 1935 at the Alhambra Theatre. Her last appearance on stage in London was in the \"revusical promenade\" Let's All Go Down the Strand at the Adelphi in 1939. She died one month shy of her 90th birthday in Eastbourne, Sussex."

  "text" : "Mark Griffin (born 19 October 1985) is a Scottish Labour Party Member of the Scottish Parliament, representing the Central Scotland region. Raised in Kilsyth, he attended St Patrick's Primary School (Kilsyth) and then St Maurice's High School (Cumbernauld), before studying Mechanical Engineering at the University of Strathclyde, where he graduated with a BEng (Hons) degree, in 2007. Griffin is a trained Mechanical Engineer and prior to his election to North Lanarkshire Council in 2008, he was a serving soldier in the British Territorial Army (TA). In May 2012, he was appointed the Scottish Labour Spokesman for Sport. He held the role until July 2013, when he became Shadow Minister for Transport and Veterans. When Jim Murphy was elected Scottish Labour Party leader in December 2014, Griffin was appointed as Shadow Minister for Learning, Science and Scotland's Languages, covering school education, qualifications, science, HM Inspectorate of Education, the Scottish Qualifications Authority and languages. Griffin was also a North Lanarkshire Councillor from 2008-12. Upon his election at the age of 25, he became not only the youngest MSP of the 2011-16 Scottish Parliament, but the youngest in its history. Following the 2016 election this record was taken by 21 year old Ross Greer, who was elected for the Scottish Green Party. Griffin sits on the Scottish Parliament's Education and Culture Committee and is a member of a number of Cross-Party Parliamentary Groups, including the Cross Party Groups on Deafness, Sport and Industrial Communities. Through his work with the CPG on Deafness, he is in the process of putting a British Sign Language (BSL) (Scotland) Bill through Parliament. He became one of the first MSPs elected in 2011 to put forward plans for a Members Bill. The Bill was supported in principle by the Scottish Government in late 2014. In January 2014, Griffin was chosen as the Scottish Labour Party candidate for the Cumbernauld and Kilsyth Scottish Parliament seat at the 2016 election."

  "text" : "Matthias Marris (17 August 1839, in The Hague – 22 August 1917, in London) was a Dutch painter, etcher and lithographer. He was also known as Matthijs Maris or Thijs. He initially belonged to the Hague School, like his two brothers, Jacob and Willem, but his later works deviated more and more from that school into a unique style influenced by the Pre-Raphaelites. When Matthijs was twelve, he registered at the Hague Academy of Art, but did not pass the entrance exam. Therefore, he took lessons from Isaac Cornelis Elink Sterk, secretary of the Academy. One year later he was admitted and studied there until 1855. In 1854 he became a pupil of the marine painter Louis Meijer, who helped him obtain a grant from Queen Sophie that enabled him to follow his brother Jacob to Antwerp, where they rented rooms together. In 1858 Matthijs returned to The Hague, where Jacob already had a studio they could share. A later commission enabled them to travel in and start painting in Oosterbeek with painters as Gerard Bilders and Anton Mauve. In 1860 he traveled with his brother Jacob along the Rhine to Switzerland and back through France to the Netherlands. In Cologne the brothers saw an exhibition that presented an overview of German art since 1800, which intensified the influence of German Romanticism on Matthijs. Upon his return to the Netherlands Matthijs showed some of his works in Amsterdam and The Hague, but they were not well received. This led him to become bitter and withdrawn. Jacob was having success in Paris, and invited Matthijs to join him there, which he did in 1869. After the Franco-Prussian War of 1870–71 Jacob returned to The Hague with his family and the loneliness after the departure of Jacob was difficult for Matthijs. There was bitter poverty for him, as for so many artists at that time in Paris, so he went back to work. His style changed very little and was more reminiscent of the earlier period. Later he would distance himself from these works, dismissing them as 'potboilers', only painted in order to put food on the table. An art dealer Daniel Cottier convinced him to settle in London, which he did in 1877. There he painted more imaginative scenes: fairytale characters and enchanted castles. He also painted a number of brides in fine gray tones, delicate and hazy like a dream. He made portraits, especially children of friends like Baby lessor (private collection, 1880) and Barije Swan (Gemeentemuseum, 1887), the fragile child in her white and gray painted lace dress with fine color accents of yellow lemon and the blue ribbons. Children, whether or not combined with animals, were always a favorite subject. He painted portraits and figure in gray-brown tones in many layers, using dry loose paint. The image is as it were veiled in mist. Maris died on 22 August 1917, when he was seventy eight, following a short illness, and was buried in London."

  "text" : "Michael Evans (born 13 July 1992) is a former professional Australian rules footballer who played for the Melbourne Football Club in the Australian Football League (AFL). He was drafted to Melbourne from the Claremont Football Club in the West Australian Football League with the 31st selection in the 2011 Rookie Draft. He was then elevated to the senior list when Jake Spencer was placed on the long-term injury list. In May 2011 he was named to make his debut with the Melbourne football club in the Round 9 match against St Kilda at Etihad Stadium. In a disappointing loss for the Demons, Evans had an impressive debut, gathering 27 disposals and seven inside 50s; named as one of Melbourne's best players and his good form was one of the few positives Melbourne could take away from the match. Evans was delisted in November 2014, he and the club were in discussions in the weeks leading up to his delisting regarding re-drafting him as a rookie due to him still having a year left on his contract, however, he subsequently retired after deciding not to nominate for the draft."

Al-Sharif was detained and released on 21 May and rearrested the following day. On 30 May, al-Sharif was released on bail, on the conditions of returning for questioning if requested, not driving and not talking to the media. The New York Times and Associated Press associated the women's driving campaign with the wider pattern of the Arab Spring and the long duration of al-Sharif's detention with Saudi authorities' fear of protests. Following her driving campaign, al-Sharif remained an active critic of the Saudi government, tweeting on issues including imprisoned female foreign workers, the lack of elections for the Shura Council, and the murder of Lama al-Ghamdi. Her work has been recognized by Foreign Policy, Time, and the Oslo Freedom Forum."

  "text" : "Mathieu Criaerd (1689 — 1776) was the most prominent of a large family of  cabinetmakers (ébénistes), apparently of Flemish ancestry, who were working in Paris during the 18th century. He became a master in the Corporation des Menuisiers-Ébénistes 29 July 1738 and set up his workshop in the rue Traversière-Saint-Antoine, in the heart of the furniture-making district of Paris, using the stamp M CRIAERD. Through the marchand-mercier Thomas-Joachim Hébert, Criaerd scored an early triumph for them both in 1743, with a commode and corner cabinets (encoignures) en suite, that were delivered on 20 January by Hébert for the use of Louis XV's mistress Mme de Mailly in her Blue Room at the Château de Choisy; it was decorated in vernis Martin in blue and white, with chinoiserie motifs, as if it were entirely made of Chinese porcelain, and its mounts, rather than being gilded, were silvered. Though in fact it was the painted decor that impressed, the sensational success of the set launched Hébert's career as a purveyor of refined furnishings and objets d'art to the court of Louis XV and doubtless brought Criaerd himself to the notice of wealthy clients. Criaerd specialized in furniture veneered with Chinese lacquer or lacquered to imitate it, or with floral marquetry, with rococo mounts. On a number of occasions he supplied furniture carcasses to Jean-François Oeben's workshop, \"a sufficient indication of his high standing\", Francis Watson observed of Criaerd. His large production of lacquered commodes in an admittedly somewhat routine Louis XV manner elicited the observation from André Bouthemy, who was attempting to distinguish, in a Morellian technique, the recognizable workshop characteristics of a number of Parisian ébénistes, \"There is no lack even of reputed artists worthy of interest in other respects, who sacrificed to facility commonplace productions: the Criaerds, Roussels and Delormes, for example, have carried out pieces of furniture that all blend together. The commode and corner cabinets delivered by Mathieur Criard for Mme de Mailly, mistress of Louis XV, are distinguished assuredly by the remarkable paintings with which they are covered, but their metal mounts are of widely available models, such as the hardware trade of the time produced.\"After his wife died in 1767, Criaerd made over the workshop to his younger son Sébastien-Mathieu Criaerd, known as \"Criaerd le jeune\", who expanded the commercial aspect of the venture as a dealer in furnishings, but continuing to stamp with his father's maindron, as was customary practice."

The meaning of Matthias' epithet is obscure. His epithet could mean ‘Handsome’ from the Hebrew language or ‘son of Ephesus’ from the Greek language, as he was sometimes known as ‘Matthias of Ephesus’. For Matthias to obtain his epithet reveals he may have been a distinguished Jew. Matthias was one of the nine children born to Simon Psellus. Matthias came from a wealthy family of priestly descent. His father served as a priest in the Temple in Jerusalem. Through his father, Matthias belonged to the priestly order of the Jehoiarib, which was the first of the twenty four-orders of Priests in the Temple in Jerusalem. Matthias became a Priest serving in the Temple in Jerusalem and married the daughter of High Priest Jonathon. There is a possibility that Jonathon may have been Alexander Jannaeus, the High Priest and Hasmonean ruler who governed Judea from 103 BC-76 BC who was the second husband of Salome Alexandra. Alexander Jannaeus was also known as Jonathon. His unnamed Jewish wife bore him a son, Matthias Curtus. Through his son, Matthias was an ancestor of the Roman Jewish Historian of the 1st century, Flavius Josephus."

All Fernez invented apparatus were surface-supplied but his inventions, especially his mouthpiece equipped with a one-way valve, inspired the scuba diving pioneer Yves le Prieur. He was also a talented businessman who created a company to manufacture and sell the breathing apparatus he invented, and expanded its range of products to include gas masks, respirators and filters."

Matthias came from a wealthy family who descended from the priestly order of the Jehoiarib, which was the first of the twenty four-orders of Priests in the Temple in Jerusalem. He was the son of Matthias Ephlias and the daughter of the High Priest Jonathon. Jonathon may have been Alexander Jannaeus, the High Priest and Hasmonean ruler who governed Judea from 103 BC–76 BC. The paternal grandfather of Matthias was Simon Psellus. Matthias was a contemporary to the last rulers of the Hasmonean dynasty, in particular to Hyrcanus II who served as High Priest from 76 BC–67 BC and 63 BC–40 BC. He followed in the footsteps of his father and paternal grandfather and served as a Priest in the Temple in Jerusalem. He married an unnamed Jewish woman through whom he had a son called Josephus. His son would be the paternal grandfather of the Roman Jewish Historian of the 1st century, Flavius Josephus."

In 1998, he was arrested by authorities following an article covering the house arrest of opposition leader Etienne Tshisekedi. In January 2000, he was assaulted in New York City by the advisors of DRC President Laurent-Désiré Kabila while covering a meeting of the United Nations Security Council. In 2000, he was awarded the International Press Freedom Award of the Committee to Protect Journalists. The award citation described him as \"a relentless advocate for human rights\" and \"an inspiration to journalists throughout Africa who continue to fight against tremendous odds for freedom of expression and better governance\"."

  "text" : "Originally from Pakistan, Masood Ashraf Raja (Urdu: مسعود اشرف راجہ) is an Associate Professor of Postcolonial literature and Theory at the University of North Texas and the editor of Pakistaniaat: A Journal of Pakistan Studies, an open access journal that he founded in 2009. Besides teaching and writing about issues of postcoloniality, globalisation, and political Islam, Raja also actively participates in the public debates through his public writing on his two blogs as well as other popular and scholarly websites.Raja moved to the United States in 1996, after ten years of service in the Pakistan Army as an Infantry officer. Raja graduated with a Masters in literature from Belmont University in 2002, and earned his PhD in Postcolonial Studies from Florida State University in 2006, where he studied with Robin Truth Goodman. While at Belmont University, Raja was awarded the Graduate Writing Award and at Florida State he was awarded the Davis Award for Best Graduate Student and Davis Award for best dissertation in 2005 and 2006 respectively. A strong proponent of peace, social justice, and human rights, Raja hopes to foster a better understanding between his primary culture and rest of the world.Raja's last monograph, Constructing Pakistan, (Oxford University Press, 2010), is an interesting explanation of the rise of Muslim national political identity during the British Raj and offers an innovative explanation of the genesis of the idea of Pakistan. Raja has also published extensively in his area of study and on general academic topics in various academic journals and anthologies. Raja is also a member of the Advisory Committee (2009–12) of PMLA, the premier journal of literature and languages and was also recently elected to a five-year term on the Executive Committee of the South Asian Studies Group, Modern Language Association. Besides his academic and popular writings, Raja has also actively presented his views at academic conferences as well as through public talks. Recently, Raja has also contributed his views on various issues related to the Islamic world and Pakistan to newspapers such as the Fort Worth Star-Telegram on a story on Osama bin Laden and to Aljazeera English on a story about the Blasphemy law in Pakistan.Having recently won a million dollar grant from the US State Department, Raja is now also the Director of a partnership program between University of North Texas and the National University of Modern Languages, Islamabad. Masood Ashraf Raja continues to contribute his thoughts on issues of social justice, political Islam, and issues of Human rights."

  "text" : "Matthew \"Matt\" Fox (1906–1988) was an American illustrator and comic book artist. Fox notably illustrated the covers for the horror pulp magazine Weird Tales from 1943 to 1951. He also contributed art to other pulps, including Crack Detective, Famous Fantastic Mysteries, and Planet Stories. In the 1950s and 1960s he worked for Atlas Comics, contributing inking and penciling to comics publications like Journey into Mystery, World of Fantasy, Tales of Suspense and Journey into Unknown Worlds. Fox was much older than most of his colleagues, and his comics are noted for their large amount of detail, and stiff \"Victorian woodcut\" style. Fox never gave an interview and his only public statement was his own entry for the 1973 edition of Who's Who of American Comics. In it, he names Alex Raymond as his only influence and lists \"lithographs, water colors, color woodcuts, oils and etchings\" as his other mediums. Fox's last known published work is an advertisement, printed in 1967, for original mail-order glow-in-the-dark posters. Two of his comics appear in the 2010 book Art in Time, a collection of works by \"unheralded\" comics artists who worked between 1940 and 1980."

  "text" : "Matthias (Greek: Ματθίας; 6–70) was a Jew living in Jerusalem. Matthias came from a wealthy family and through his father he descended from the priestly order of the Jehoiarib, which was the first of the twenty four-orders of Priests in the Temple in Jerusalem. He was the son born to Josephus and his wife, an unnamed Jewish noblewoman. The parents of Matthias were distant relatives. Matthias’ mother was a descendant of Josephus’ paternal great grandfather, Simon Psellus. His paternal grandparents were Matthias Curtus and his unnamed Jewish wife. Through his paternal grandfather, he was the descendant of the High Priest Jonathon. Jonathon may have been Alexander Jannaeus, the High Priest and Hasmonean ruler who governed Judea from 103 BC-76 BC. He was a contemporary to the Herodian Dynasty governing Judea and the surrounding territories. Matthias followed his paternal ancestors and served as a Priest in the Temple in Jerusalem. He was an aristocratic priest. One of his duties was to oversee the affairs of the Jewry in Jerusalem and Palestine during the Roman occupation. Matthias married an unnamed Jewish noblewoman, who had descended from royalty and of the former ruling Hasmonean Dynasty. Matthias with his wife had two sons: \n*  Matthias \n*  Josephus, the Roman Jewish Historian Josephus in his writings highly praises his father and describes him as a distinguished Jew. He describes him that way because not just of his birth alone but he was praised for his sense of justice for being a very eminent man in Jerusalem. Matthias and his family had connections to the Sadducees. Matthias and his wife were alive during the First Jewish–Roman War. The war occurred from 66 until 73. In the year 70 during the Roman Siege of Jerusalem, Matthias; his wife and Josephus’ first wife were in the city during the siege. The three were held as prisoners by the Jewish rebels because they didn’t trust them. Josephus who was commander-in-chief in Galilee received news through his father about the situation in Jerusalem. Josephus through his intervention was able to save his brother from Roman imprisonment, however he was unable to save his father; mother and his first wife as the three perished during the siege."

From 2009 on Yefremov presents Channel One show Wait for Me, dedicated to search of long lost relatives and friends. In 2010's he collaborated Dmitry Bykov over their project \"Citizen Poet\" (a pun on Nikolai Nekrasov's poem \"Poet and Citizen\"). Yefremov reads poems, written by Bykov, which are usually satirical comments on the contemporary Russian society, politics and culture. Each poem parodies the style of a famous poet of the past, e.g. Pushkin, Nekrasov, Kipling, among others. It was originally broadcast on Dozhd TV channel, but the original project was closed, because the poems were too critical towards Russian government. Currently, the show is hosted in audio format by Echo of Moscow radio station."
