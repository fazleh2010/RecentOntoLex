His business ventures in Bozeman were so successful that he became the town's first millionaire. In 1893, he played a prominent role in the establishment of the Agricultural College of the State of Montana by donating land and facilities. He built the first Story Mansion on Main Street in Bozeman in 1880 and later built today's Story Mansion at the corner of Willson and College for his son, T. Byron Story in 1910.

She is the author or editor of a number of groundbreaking works of American literary history and criticism, beginning with Woman's Fiction (Cornell, 1978), and including Feminism and American Literary History (Rutgers, 1992), American Women Writers and the Work of History (Rutgers, 1995), and \"American Women of Letters and the Nineteenth-Century Sciences\" (Rutgers, 2004). She is also the author of scores of articles, reviews, and essays including \"Melodramas of Beset Manhood: How Theories of American Fiction Exclude Women Authors\" (American Quarterly 1981). Elaine Showalter has called Baym's new (2011) Women Writers of the American West, 1833-1927 (University of Illinois Press), \"the first comprehensive guide to women's writing in the old West,\" an immediately \"standard and classic text.\" This book uncovers and describes the western-themed writing in diverse genres of almost 350 American women, most of them unknown today but many of them successful and influential in their own time. Since 1991 Baym has served as General Editor of the Norton Anthology of American Literature. Beginning with the 9th edition of the anthology (the current is the eighth) Robert Levine, of the University of Maryland, will assume the general editorship. In October 2013 she was recognized by the college of Liberal Arts and Sciences in connection with the 100th anniversary of the college; she was designated as one of the 25 most influential people in the college's history. She has been active in such professional associations as the American Literature Section of the Modern Language Association and the American Studies Association, as well as serving as Director of the School of Humanities at the University of Illinois from 1976-1987. She has served on panels for the National Endowment for the Humanities and the Fulbight Foundation. Among her numerous literary prizes, fellowship, and honors are the 2000 Jay B. Hubbell Award for lifetime achievement in American literary studies (from the Modern Language Association) and fellowships from the John Simon Guggenheim Foundation, the National Endowment for the Humanities, the American Association of University Women, and the Mellon Foundation. Baym was born in Princeton, New Jersey; her father was the eminent mathematician Leo Zippin and her mother taught high school English. She received her B.A. from Cornell University, an M.A. from Radcliffe, and a Ph.D. from Harvard University. She was married to Gordon Baym from 1958 to 1970; their two children are Nancy Baym and Geoffrey Baym. She has been married to Jack Stillinger since 1971."

  "text" : "Nicolas Cochin (1610–1686), called the Elder, was a French draughtsman and engraver. He was born at Troyes in 1610, the son of a painter named Noel Cochin. About 1635, he went to Paris, where he died in 1686. He often imitated and copied Callot, but chose for his model De la Belle, some of whose drawings he engraved. Like these two artists he excelled in small figures, which he grouped and delineated with lifelike animation. His specialty was topography, including battles, sieges, and encampments. He engraved several hundred subjects, the most important of which are those he executed for the 'Glorieuses Conquêtes de Louis le Grand,' called the 'Grand Beaulieu,' published between the years 1676 and 1694. The best of these plates may be the 'Siege of Arras,' engraved on sixteen plates by Cochin and Frosne. Nicolas Cochin is the best of the engravers whom Troyes has produced. His drawing is firm, and his engraving fine and delicate. His plates are marked with his name in full, or with his initials only, or with a monogram. M. Corrard de Breban has given in his 'Graveurs Troyens,' 1868, a list of Cochin's works, among which the following are noteworthy: \n* The Life of the Virgin; after Albrecht Dürer; 18 plates \n* The Marriage in Cana; after Paolo Veronese \n* The Miracle of the Loaves; after Devos \n* The Parable of the Prodigal Son; after Audran; 4 plates \n* Christ bearing the Cross; after Callot \n* The Ascension of the Virgin; after the same \n* The Passion; 12 plates \n* The Conversion of St. Paul \n* The Procession of St. Genevieve in 1652; extremely curious \n* The Entry of Louis XIV. and his Queen into Paris in 1660; an enormous work composed of several plates. \n* The Entry of the Queen of Sweden. 1658. \n* The Fair of Guibray; after F. Chauvel. 1658. \n* Portrait of Boutmie, the goldsmith; rare and highly esteemed. \n* View of Tournay; after Van der Meulen; 2 sheets."

  "text" : "Nikolay Ivanovich Peyko or Peiko (Николай Иванович Пейко) (March 25, 1916 in Moscow – 1995 in Moscow) was a Russian composer and professor of composition. Peyko studied composition at Moscow Conservatory under Nikolay Myaskovsky, graduating in 1940, then working in a military hospital during the Second World War and teaching at the Moscow Conservatory 1942-1949. After he had been working since 1941-1943 in Ufa at a military hospital, NIkolay worked partly with and was influenced by Dmitri Shostakovich. From 1959 till retirement Peyko was professor of composition at the Gnessin State Musical College where his students included Sofia Gubaidulina and Alexander Arutjunjan. NIkolay was considered as an important composition teacher and taught his students twelve-tone case. Nikolay's first successful works, a sympathetic suite \"From the Legends of Yakuta\" (1940). During World War 2 he worked in a military hospital and composed several patriotic pieces \"Dramatic Overture\" (1941), first symphony (1944-1946) were highly appreciated by Myaskovsly and Schostakovich. Some classical archives from Nikolay are Moldavian Suite for orchestra (1950), \"The Tsar Ivan's Night\", \"Jeanne d'Arc\", Ballada, for piano, Piano Sonata NO.1, Variations for piano, Sonatina for piano NO.2, Bylina, for Piano, Piano Sonata NO.2, Concert Triptych for 2 pianos. Nikolay worked on a genre of \"pure\" sympathy composed music for theater plays composed chamber music. Nikolay was more of a traditional composer who performed Folk music to the soviets in his musical language. His music is known for a more harsh, distant sound with lots of expression. Another sense of his music is driving march-rhythms with good humor, also presented with the sound of bells. In 1964 he received the title as a Honored Art Worker of the RSFSR. Nikolay began working with 12-note methods in the 1960s. In 2012 he performed in the Irish-Russian chamber-music festival in Moscow. Nikolay has won many awards throughout his lifetime, including two Stalin prizes for his first symphony (1947) and his Moldavian Suit (1950–51). Unfortunately NIkolay is completely unknown in the west, but his first two CD's ever made covers his piano music and was the first time any piece of music like NIkolay's was recorded on a western label."

  "text" : "Nicolas Goupillet also Coupillet or Goupillier (Senlis, ca. 1650 - Paris, ca. 1713) was a French Baroque composer - albeit a composer who may not have himself composed all of his works. In 1683 the then fifty-year-old \"Sun King\" Louis XIV commanded that a competition be held to select four rotating seasonal choirmasters to replace the retiring Henry Du Mont and at the Chapelle royale. Of the 35 applicants, four were selected: Michel Richard Delalande, then the late Lully's assistant Pascal Colasse; Guillaume Minoret a minor figure from Saint-Germain-l'Auxerrois; and finally Nicolas Goupillet, from Meaux. Goupillet was dismissed from the Chapelle Royale in 1693 when it was discovered that he had been passing off as his own compositions the works of Henry Desmarets - a talented composer who had passed over because of his youth in the competition 10 years earlier. At first the story went around that Desmarets had simply heard his works performed by chance, later suspicions were aroused that Desmarets had been complicit in the deception and blown the whistle when Goupillet failed to pay him. And yet Goupillet clearly could compose when he had to, since the second stage of the original competition in 1683 secluded the applicants in Paris and had them all write grands motets to Psalm 31 Beati quorum remissae sunt iniquitates. In any event the king was not too hard on Goupillet and awarded him a modest pension and a canonship at Saint-Quentin, Aisne. Goupillet claimed to have been a choir-boy at Notre-Dame under Pierre Robert, but no evidence survives of this. Goupillet was first employed at Langres Cathedral till he was dismissed, for reasons unknown, in September 1681. He found work in Meaux, but then in 1683 applied for, and succeeded, in application for the Paris competition. Sébastien de Brossard lists several works (now lost) as possibly by Goupillet, but the way in which Brossard describes them suggest they were actually by André Pechon, Goupillet's predecessor at Meaux. During the 9 months of the year when he was not required in Paris, Goupillet returned to work with Pierre Tabart at Meaux."

  "text" : "Norman H. Margolus (born 1955) is a Canadian-American physicist and computer scientist, known for his work on cellular automata and reversible computing. He is a research affiliate with the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Margolus was one of the organizers of a seminal research meeting on the connections between physics and computation theory, held on Mosquito Island in 1982. He is known for inventing the block cellular automaton and the Margolus neighborhood for block cellular automata, which he used to develop cellular automaton simulations of billiard-ball computers. In the same work, Margolus also showed that the billiard ball model could be simulated by a second order cellular automaton, a different type of cellular automaton invented by his thesis advisor, Edward Fredkin. These two simulations were among the first cellular automata that were both reversible (able to be run backwards as well as forwards for any number of time steps, without ambiguity) and universal (able to simulate the operations of any computer program); this combination of properties is important in low-energy computing, as it has been shown that the energy dissipation of computing devices may be made arbitrarily small if and only if they are reversible. In connection with this issue, Margolus and his co-author Lev B. Levitin proved the Margolus–Levitin theorem showing that the speed of any computer is limited by the fundamental laws of physics to be at most proportional to its energy use; this implies that ultra-low-energy computers must run more slowly than conventional computers. With Tommaso Toffoli, Margolus developed the CAM-6 cellular automaton simulation hardware, which he extensively described in his book with Toffoli, Cellular Automata Machines (MIT Press, 1987), and with Tom Knight he developed the \"Flattop\" integrated circuit implementation of billiard-ball computation. He has also done pioneering research on the reversible quantum gate logic needed to support quantum computers. Margolus received his Ph.D. in physics in 1987 from MIT, under the supervision of Edward Fredkin. He founded and was chief scientist for Permabit, an information storage device company."

  "text" : "Nikolay Sergeyevich Rusanov (Russian: Никола́й Серге́евич Руса́нов; September 16 (28), 1859, Oryol – July 28, 1939, Berne), also known under the pseudonyms of K. Tarasov and N. Kudrin, was a Russian revolutionary who connected the revolutionary populist movement of the 1870s with the revolutionary parties of the early twentieth century, particularly the Russian Socialist-Revolutionary Party (PSR). Rusanov studied medicine at the Medical and Surgical Academy in St. Petersburg, where he became involved in radical student politics. He supported the populist (narodnik) movement and in 1877 joined the group 'Land and Liberty' (Zemlya i Volya). When the group split in 1879, Rusanov sided with 'The People's Will' (Nardodnaya Volya). This group emphasised urban organisation over rural agitation among the peasants and also endorsed political terrorism as a tactic. The group assassinated Tsar Aleksandr II in 1881. Although Rusanov was not directly involved in the plot, the repression which followed caused him to flee into exile in 1882. He remained in Western Europe, mostly in France and Germany, until 1905. Rusanov was one of the earliest Russian revolutionaries to be strongly influenced by Marxism, after reading Marx' Das Kapital, The Communist Manifesto and The Civil War in France. He contributed articles to some early Marxist journals and deployed Marx' thesis that the economic 'basis' determines the political 'superstructure' to argue against the Jacobin voluntarism and élitism of Lev Tikhomirov, the leading ideologue of 'The People's Will' in exile. Rusanov also rejected the popular view among narodniki that capitalism had not yet taken firm root in Russia and could still be avoided. These views put him closer to G.V. Plekhanov, the founder of Russian Social-Democracy, than to populism. Nevertheless, he was attracted to 'The People's Will' and later the PSR for its revolutionary élan. He foundin Nikolai Danielson a welcome interpretation of Marxism that did not seem to require a long period of capitalist development. In the early 1890s, Rusanov helped found the Group of Old Members of the People's Will, together with the venerable revolutionary veteran P.L. Lavrov, I. A. Rubanovich and others. From 1893 to 1896, Lavrov and Rusanov co-edited the seven issues of Materials for the History of the Russian Social Revolutionary Movement. During these years Rusanov also met Friedrich Engels, whom he impressed by reciting Pushkin from memory. In 1901, Rusanov, Rubanovich and M.R. Gots co-founded the journal Herald of the Russian Revolution (Vestnik russkoi revoliutsii), which became the theoretical organ of the Socialist-Revolutionary Party (PSR). Rusanov also contributed to legal Russian journals under the pseudonym 'N. Kudrin'. The PSR emerged at the end of the 1890s and held its first congress in 1901. It united revolutionary socialists who, for various reasons, objected to the \"orthodox\" Marxism of the Russian Social-Democratic Workers Party (RSDRP), and who looked back to the indigenous Russian revolutionary tradition of Alexander Herzen, Peter Lavrov, Nikolay Chernyshevsky, Nikolai Danielson, and others. Ideologically and tactically the PSR was quite diverse, comprising anti-Marxists as well as professed Marxists, advocates and opponents of political terror, those who favoured organisation among urban workers and those who emphasised rousing the peasantry. Rusanov joined the PSR in 1901, together with such venerable veteran revolutionaries as Vera Figner. While remaining in exile he and Rubanovich were instrumental in establishing the PSR's contacts with Western socialist parties and with the Second International, which the PSR eventually joined. The abortive Russian Revolution of 1905 brought Rusanov back to Russia, where he participated in the creation of workers' councils (soviets) - a tactic Lenin then still opposed. In 1914, the PSR, like most European socialist parties, split into 'Defencists' who supported Russia's war effort and 'Internationalists' who opposed it. Rusanov tried to steer a centrist course, like V.M. Chernov. In 1917 he was selected by the PSR as a delegate to the international socialist peace conference in Stockholm. After the February Revolution of 1917, Rusanov supported the Provisional Government and A.F. Kerensky. He opposed the Bolshevik October Revolution and in 1918 emigrated to Western Europe. At first he settled in Berlin, but eventually he moved to Bern, Switzerland, where he died in 1939. He wrote his memoirs in two parts, published under the titles In Emigration (1929) and In the Homeland (1931)."

  "text" : "Nikolai Dimitrovich Avksentiev (Russian: Николай Дмитриевич Авксентьев; 1878, Penza - 1943, New York) was a leading member of the Russian Socialist-Revolutionary Party (PSR). He was one of the 'Heidelberg SRs' (a group of Russian students at the University of Heidelberg in the 1890s), like V.M. Zenzinov. These SRs were influenced by Neo-Kantian philosophy and Marxism. During the First World War Avksentiev was associated with the 'Defencist' wing of the PSR and collaborated closely with V.V. Rudnev, A.R. Gots and others. He supported the February Revolution of 1917 and held various positions in the Duma, the Soviet and the Provisional Government under A.F. Kerensky, including succeeding Georgy Lvov as Minister of the Interior, 15 March 1917 – 21 July 1917. Avksentiev opposed the Bolshevik October Revolution and was briefly arrested by the Bolsheviks. In November 1918 he participated in the anti-Bolshevik 'Directorate' at Omsk but soon fell out with the military counter-revolutionaries around Admiral Kolchak. Briefly arrested by Kolchak, Avksentiev fled Russia via Vladivostok, with the assistance of the British military. He settled in Paris and was active in émigré circles and in Freemasonry. After the German invasion of France in 1940, Avksentiev and his wife Berthe escaped to America with an emergency visa provided by the Jewish Labor Committee and the American Federation of Labor. His daughter, Alexandra became an accomplished artist."

  "text" : "Noel Curran (born 1967 in County Monaghan, Ireland) is a media executive and former Director-General of RTÉ, (Ireland's National Broadcaster), who has worked in the Editorial, Management and Commercial areas of media. According to RTE's Annual Report 2015 the Director General was responsible for four TV channels (RTE ONE, RTE TWO, RTE Jnr, RTE News Now), four radio stations (Radio 1, 2FM, RnaG and Lyric), RTE Digital output (App, Web and Digital Radio), two orchestras (National Concert and Symphony Orchestras), Ireland's transmission Network (2RN) and 334 million Euro in revenue. Curran was born in Carrickmacross, County Monaghan where he attended both primary and secondary school. He studied Communications in Dublin City University where he specialised in Irish and International Broadcasting Policy. He also wrote about European Broadcasting Policy while studying for post-grad. He joined Raidió Teilifís Éireann (RTÉ) as a Business and Investigative reporter in 1992 after a period working as Deputy Editor for Business & Finance magazine. While working at 'Business & Finance' Curran was involved in several prominent investigations, most notably into the controversial collapse of Ballybay Meats. He became Deputy Editor of Business & Finance before leaving for RTÉ. He joined Current Affairs as a Senior Financial Journalist before becoming a Television producer. He then became Executive Producer of live Entertainment series and productions. He produced Kenny Live and The Late Late Show. He also produced several live television shows at the Point Theatre before being appointed as Executive Producer of the Eurovision Song Contest 1997, held in Dublin and presented by Ronan Keating and Carrie Crowley. His younger brother is Richard Curran, Deputy Editor of the 'Sunday Business Post' and presenter of TV's 'Dragons Den' series. Curran left RTÉ in 2000 to become a Director of a private independent production company. As an independent, he won an IFTA award as Executive Producer of the investigative documentary 'Bad Blood'. He returned to RTÉ as Editor of Current Affairs, where he helped launch the Prime Time Investigates series of documentaries. He was Editor of the Mary Raftery documentaries 'Cardinal Secrets' and 'Broken Trust'. In 2003, he was appointed Managing Director of TV, at 37 the youngest person to hold the position, according to the 'Irish Independent' and 'Irish Times'. He led a policy of increased investment in Irish TV production during his tenure, as RTE's Commercial Income grew to its highest historic level. That investment reached a peak of over 170 million Euro, with record hours for Drama production, TV Factual and Entertainment. RTE lost the rights to Heineken Cup and Formula One but held on to the rest of its sports portfolio - although competition from the new private sports channel Setanta and from TV3 made the domestic and international market more difficult. RTE's Programming, Commercial, Acquired and Technical areas were integrated through one TV Board for the first time under Curran as MD. With the upheaval in international markets in 2008 and collapse in advertising, RTE was forced to cut costs substantially. Based on press reports, RTE TV reduced costs by over 40 million Euro in the next two years. In March 2010, Curran left RTÉ to pursue a consultancy and other private business interests before being interviewed and then appointed DG by the RTÉ Board effective from 1 February 2011. Commenting on his appointment in an article headlined 'Hard Station', the 'Sunday Business Post' stated that RTE 'is financially strapped', has 'zero chance of a licence fee increase' and 'has major structural issues' to deal with. The 'Sunday Times' said RTE faced 'difficult circumstances'. Both profiles quoted industry figures praising his leadership of RTE TV but pointing out the challenges. RTE also faced press and public criticism for two Current Affairs programmes it broadcast. News and Current Affairs was restructured in response. RTE Publishing became RTE Digital with a new Digital Strategy launched. RTE News Now App and Channel were launched. RTE launched its biggest infrastructural project, the new DTT service Saorview. New programming strategies were introduced in Radio and TV and RTEJnr was launched. RTE restructured in 2011 and 300 staff left the organisation. Top Ten presenter fees were cut by over 40 per cent. ( References 'RTE On Course To Break Even', 'The Sunday Business Post' December 22, 2013. 'Steering RTE Through The Most Turbulent Era In Media History', 'The Irish Times', April 26, 2013. 'He's Riding The Crest Of The Airwaves', 'The Sunday Times' 13 September 2015. 'Curran Steered RTE Through Choppy Waters. 'The irish Times' October 2015) Since becoming Director General Curran has made a number of speeches on the theme of the Digital Future of Broadcasting in Ireland and on the role of Public Service Media. Speaking at his alma mater Dublin City University in October 2011, Curran admitted RTÉ had paid its presenters too much money and \"We may, during this process of renegotiation lose some of our most talented and loved presenters to our competitors. That would be very regrettable, but if some choose to leave, we will adjust, find new voices and new ways to deliver services and programmes.\" He described the broadcasting of \"Mission to Prey\", as \"one of the gravest editorial mistakes ever made\" at RTÉ. He returned to Dublin City University in April 2016 where he criticised Irish broadcasting policy and warned that public media faced a difficult financial future without changes in policy and funding."

  "text" : "Severino \"Nonoy\" Marcelo (January 22, 1939 – October 22, 2002) was a Filipino cartoonist born in Malabon, Metro Manila, Philippines, an alumnus of the Institute of Arts and Sciences from Far Eastern University, and a former cartoonist in the The Advocate (the official student publication of Far Eastern University), best known for creating the character Ikabod Bubwit (literally \"Ikabod the Small Rodent\" or \"Ikabod the Small Mouse\" in Tagalog) in the comic strip Ikabod. He also created the comic strips Plain Folks, which appeared in the Daily Mirror during the early 1960s, and Tisoy in 1963 for the Manila Times, which tells about the lifestyle of young Filipinos. His main character, Tisoy (slang for \"mestizo\"), and cast members such as Aling Otik, Maribubut, Caligula, Tatang, Tikyo and Kinse, soon became established in Philippine pop culture. Tisoy became a 1977 film directed by Ishmael Bernal, starring Christopher de Leon and Charo Santos. Ikabod ran from the late 1970s to 2002. It was a satirical strip that re-cast the Philippines as a nation called Dagalandia. The strip humorously depicted the socio-political woes of ordinary Filipinos, as represented by the tailless Everymouse hero, Ikabod - who became as iconic in his own way as that other popular cartoon rodent, Mickey Mouse. Marcelo often used the strip to caricature political figures from Ferdinand Marcos and Cory Aquino to Joseph Estrada and Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo, re-imagining them as mice. In 1985, Marcelo was given the Catholic Mass Media Award for print journalism, a category usually given to reporters or columnists. In 1998, Marcelo received the Cultural Center of the Philippines' Centennial Artist Award, the only cartoonist so honored. He died in Manila on October 22, 2002 at the age of 63 of sepsis due to complications from his diabetes."

  "text" : "Nedom L. Angier (November 10, 1814 – February 3, 1882) was Mayor of Atlanta during the Rutherford B. Hayes visit of 22 September 1877. Hayes' visit was part of a \"good-will\" trip to continue post-Reconstruction reconciliation with the former Confederate States of America. Born in Acworth, New Hampshire, he came to Georgia in 1839 and taught school for four years in Coweta County, then completed his medical training at New York University before arriving as an early Atlanta settler in 1847 where he practiced that trade and a few others. He spent the year 1850 gold-hunting in California, but returned to Atlanta amassing real estate wealth before the American Civil War, including a health spring near the current intersection of today's Ponce de Leon and Glen Iris. With Georgia's secession in 1861, many pro-Unionists fled Atlanta. Heeding advice from U.S. Secretary of State William H. Seward and with help from William Markham, Angier was able to escape the South with his family via Cuba to New York City. His son, Alton Angier (1855–1913) also escaped, but only by crossing enemy lines and describing Atlanta's fortifications to Union officials in Tennessee. During the occupation of Atlanta, his home on Mitchell St. facing the Atlanta City Hall was occupied by Union Major General John M. Schofield. After the war, Angier was rewarded for his loyalty with an appointment as U.S. collector of revenue and was elected state treasurer in 1868, where he battled fellow Republican Rufus B. Bullock over public funds. The political fight parlayed into the mayoralship of Atlanta. Later he was a high school principal. Nedom Angier was buried at Oakland Cemetery and remembered by Angier Avenue and Angier Springs Road in Atlanta's Old Fourth Ward."

  "text" : "Nicholas Anthony Bruty or Nick Bruty (born in 1969 in Longfield, Kent) is a British video game designer and entrepreneur. He was raised and educated in Livingston, Scotland. He made his first step into video games when he was 15, working for company SoftStone with his friend David Quinn. Bruty had done some projects for SoftStone when it went bust in 1984. In 1987 Bruty joined Probe Software, where he met another notable VG figure David Perry. Together they formed a team, with Bruty as artist and Perry as programmer, making arcade classics such as Trantor: The Last Stormtrooper, Savage, Overlord and Dan Dare 3. In 1992 Perry and Bruty went to American division of Virgin Games where they worked on Global Gladiators, Cool Spot, Aladdin and The Jungle Book. In 1993 David Perry formed Shiny Entertainment in California and Bruty and some members of Virgin Games followed in after finishing The Jungle Book. While in Shiny, Bruty led the art direction on cult platformers Earthworm Jim and its sequel, and in Special Edition of first game the level \"Big Bruty\" was named after him. The finest hour of Bruty in Shiny came with 1997 hit shooter MDK. He made the idea of game itself, designed the idea of sniper aiming, the characters and designed its humorous style. After MDK Bruty left Shiny and formed video game company Planet Moon Studios with another ex-Shiny employees Tim Williams and Scott Guest. The company since made notable Giants: Citizen Kabuto, Armed and Dangerous (influenced by MDK) and Infected.

  "text" : "Nicola Shindler is a British television producer and executive, and founder of the independent television drama production company Red Production Company Shindler began her career working for Granada Television, for whom she first came to prominence as a script editor on the drama series Cracker (1993). She then went on to work as assistant producer on the BBC's Our Friends in the North (1996) and producer on Hillsborough, a dramatised account of the 1989 football stadium disaster. All three starred actor Christopher Eccleston, who subsequently featured in several dramas for Red. Red – named after the nickname of Shindler's favourite football team, Manchester United – was formed in 1998 and its first project, with Shindler producing, was writer Russell T Davies' gay drama serial Queer as Folk. Queer as Folk gave Red a reputation as producers of noteworthy drama, and they followed this off with subsequent series for Channel 4 such as Love in the 21st Century (1999) and Queer as Folk 2 (2000). Red has since produced dramas for BBC One, BBC Two, and ITV including Clocking Off (2000–03), Flesh and Blood (2002), Bob and Rose (2001) and The Second Coming (2003). Sally Wainwright credits Schindler with bringing Last Tango In Halifax to BBC TV. In February 2013 she was assessed as one of the 100 most powerful women in the United Kingdom by Woman's Hour on BBC Radio 4. In December 2013, it was announced that Shindler had sold a majority stake Red Production Company to the French media company StudioCanal."

  "text" : "Nels Nelsen (3 June 1894 – 3 June 1943), born Nils Johan Nilsen and sometimes incorrectly referred to as Nels Nelson, was a Norwegian-born Canadian ski jumper and later ski jumping organizer. He was among the world's best ski jumpers during the 1920s, and held the world record of 73 meters from 1925 to 1930. Born in Salangen, he moved with his family to Revelstoke, British Columbia, in 1913. He quickly became the town's best ski jumper, making his debut in the town's Big Hill in 1916. He competed throughout Canada and the United States, and became Canadian champion five times. Despite holding the world record at the time, he was not allowed to participate in the 1928 Winter Olympics because the officials did not find it suitable for him to have to work his way to Switzerland. Nelsen worked for the Canadian Pacific Railway, and moved to North Vancouver, British Columbia, where he raised a family. Nelsen lost his hand in a hunting accident in 1933, and was forced to retire as a ski jumper. He continued as an organizer, and was among other things president of the Western Canada Amateur Ski Association and later vice-president of the Canadian Amateur Ski Association. In 1948, after Big Hill had been expanded, it was renamed Nels Nelsen Hill. Nelsen was inscribed in the U.S. National Ski Hall of Fame in 1971 and the Canadian Ski Hall of Fame in 1983."

  "text" : "Kiyonori Imamura (今村 清憲 Imamura Kiyonori), better known by his stage name Norio Imamura (いまむら のりお Imamura Norio) (born April 17, 1954), is a Japanese stage actor and voice actor from Gifu. He is a graduate of the Fine Arts department of Nihon University. Imamura began his career in the musical troupe Musical Company It's Follies and was coached by Nachi Nozawa. Imamura tattoos himself as a hobby and has reportedly spent 4 to 5 million yen (the equivalent of $45,000 to $56,000) on tattoos over the course of a decade. From April 26 to June 7, 2010, Imamura posted pictures of his lower body on his blog with the intention of showing that his body had been completely tattooed. Imamura was arrested on July 2010 for posting images that were deemed indecent. This event forced Imamura to step down from his ongoing voice role as Emporio Ivankov in One Piece (the role was subsequently inherited by Mitsuo Iwata). On September 1, Imamura was released following a summary proceeding at the Tokyo Public Prosecutor's Office and was given a fine of 500,000 yen (approximately $6,000)."

They served on HMS Orion for five years, including during action in L'Orient (1795) and Cape St Vincent (1797). Her official role was to mend the captain's shirts but she also played the role of the Powder Monkey and assisted the surgeons with his operations, including amputations, including during the Battle of the Nile. Nancy gave birth to two daughters while on HMS Orion. Her husband drowned in 1802, and she married a pilot, John Perriam, who died in 1812.

He also earned a Master in Public Administration from the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University. Prevost was appointed as a senator to the House of Assembly from 1990 to 2005. From 1995 to 2000, he served as the Minister of Tourism. He was elected as a representative to the House of Assembly in the 2005 general election, from the Roseau Central constituency. Prevost was reelected in the 2009 general election, by the narrow margin of 839 votes to 836 for his Labour Party opponent, Alvin Bernard. The 2009 election overall was a loss for the UWP, which lost four seats to retain only three. Prevost subsequently joined the UWP boycott of the House of Assembly, in protest against alleged election irregularities. Prevost became the only UWP member to break the boycott, taking his seat on 29 April 2010 in what he stated was a strategic move on behalf of the UWP. The other two UWP seats were declared vacant and a by-election held, though both UWP members won to retain their seats."

Resulting from thirty years of research he has developed a didactic method known as \"Emotion to Know\" which is based on the theories of Vygotsky, Wertheimer and Husserl. The method is based on the premise that a person with a disability should as much as possible lead a life that takes into account their own originality in developing an intentional consciousness, independent living, and independent path in a global, active, lived and acted way."

In addition Parker has worked on major sporting events including the London and Beijing Olympics and football World Cups and European Championships. On February 11, 2012, Parker was arrested by detectives investigating payments to public officials as part of the Metropolitan Police's Operation Elveden. He was subsequently charged with three counts of aiding and abetting misconduct in public office relating to payments made to a police officer and prison officer. He was also charged as part of the Metropolitan Police's Operation Tuleta with receiving a mobile phone belonging to Labour MP Siobhain McDonagh. After a three week trial on December 9, 2014, Parker - who argued all his actions were in keeping with Press Complaints Commission Code of Conduct and in the public interest - was found not guilty of all three aiding and abetting misconduct charges but convicted of receiving the mobile phone and sentenced to three months imprisonment, suspended for 12 months."

  "text" : "Dr. Nitasha Sharma is an Assistant Professor of African American Studies and Asian American Studies at Northwestern University’s Weinberg College of Arts and Sciences. In her time at Northwestern University, Sharma has taught classes such as Comparative Race Relations: Asian and Black Relations in the United States, The Racial and Gender Politics of Hip Hop, and Race, Crime, and Punishment: Prisons, The Border, and Post 9/11 Detentions. Sharma received her formal education at the University of California at Santa Barbara in 2004 specializing in anthropology. Her primary areas of scholarly interest focus on Afro/Asian American relations especially in terms of studying the relationship between the two through hip hop music. In her latest publication, Hip Hop Desis, she examines the reasons that second generation, middle class to affluent Asian Americans strive to be part of the hip hop culture that has been more or less claimed by the African American community. She examines the content of these songs as they represent notions of terror, racism and other pertinent issues in the African American and Asian American communities. Her writing has received positive response from Asian American Activists and scholars such as Vijay Prashad along with popular culture and American Studies scholar George Lipsitz. In addition to Hip Hop Desis, she is currently working on her second book, Hapas and Douglas: Asian/Black Multiraciality in Hawaii and Trinidad. Sharma has received many accolades and academic awards in her field especially during her time as a Northwestern University faculty member. These awards include National Emerging Scholar 2009, Diverse: Issues in Higher Education, Woodrow Wilson Career Enhancement Grant (2009–2010), Outstanding Teaching Award, African American Studies at Northwestern University two consecutive years (2006–2007,2007–2008). Sharma has been cited in many scholarly works, primarily in ethnic journals such as the Journal of South Asian American Public Affairs, Journal of Political and Legal Anthropology, and the South Asian Magazine for Action and Reflection. In addition to her contributions to various written scholarly publications and works, Sharma has offered and continues to offer her insight and research by speaking at universities and colleges throughout the United States including New York University, University of Wisconsin-Madison, and Highline Community College. This June, Sharma will be speaking at the 24th Annual National Conference on Race and Ethnicity in American Higher Education held in San Francisco. In addition to her scholarly pursuits Nitasha Sharma also has a self-produced hip hop album out in 2007 called Island Beatz featuring such luminaries as Ghostface Killah, the RZA, and Puff Daddy."

He received national attention after he was the first person arrested under a South Dakota law requiring that persons inform prospective sexual partners that they are HIV positive. He became the central subject of wide-ranging ethical and philosophical debates regarding the unconstitutionality and illegitimacy of partner notification law. In March 2002, he allegedly participated in a \"Post 9-11\" Red Cross\" blood drive. Several weeks later he was informed by Red Cross officials that the donation that he gave was flagged for HIV. Briteramos admitted having unprotected sex with the woman in his dorm on April 13. The woman later tested negative for HIV. He was arrested after Health Department officials discovered Briteramos and the woman in his dorm room. He was initially charged with three counts of intentional exposure to the AIDS virus. Two counts were dropped in exchange for his guilty plea. He pled guilty to one count of \"Intentional Exposure to HIV\" and received a suspended sentence of five years, 120 days in jail, and 200 hours community service plus fines. According to the plea deal he was to register for school where later found out that he had lost his scholarship. He was eventually arrested for violating the terms of his probation for having spent five hours in the registration process and tested positive for marijuana. Briteramos spent 18 months in the South Dakota State Penitentiary. Following his release from prison, the 6 foot-9 inch Briteramos played in 2005-06 for Chicago State University. He was not drafted by the NBA in 2006."

He was associated with the shakti cult and viewed as a perfect spiritual master of tantra, gyan, yoga and prema or bhakti. His followers idealized him as their worshipped and beloved thakura (ठाकुर). Nigamananda was born into a Bengali Brahmin family in the hamlet of Kutabpur in Nadia district (at present Meherpur district Bangladesh). He was a sannyasi from Shankar's cult. After his ordination as a sannyasi, he came to be known as Paribrajakacharya Paramahansa Srimat Swami Nigamananda Saraswati Deva(परिब्राजकाचार्य परमहंस श्रीमद स्वामी निगमानंद सरस्वती देव). Nigamananda's followers believe that he achieved siddhi (perfection) in four different sadhanas (spiritual disciplines): tantra, gyan, yoga and prema. Based on these experiences, he wrote five Bengali language books: Brahamcharya Sadhana (ब्रह्मचर्य साधन), Yogi Guru (योगिगुरु), Gyani Guru (ज्ञानीगुरु), Tantrika Guru (तांत्रिकगुरु), and Premik Guru (प्रेमिकगुरु). Nigamananda reportedly experienced the state of Nirvikalpa Samadhi. After retiring from Saraswata Matha, Nigamananda spent the last fourteen years of his life in Puri. Durga Charan Mohanty, a school student, met him at Nilachala Kutir in 1930 and recognized him as sadguru. Mohanty became Nigamananda's disciple and wrote books for Nigamananda's establishment Nilachala Saraswata Sangha and translated Nigamananda's Bengali books into Odia. Under Mohanty's encouragement, more than 100 ashrams operate in Orissa. Mohanty continued to spread the message of Nigamananda until his death on 7 Dec 1985."

He and his late wife Helen formed Helmac the next day. Helmac is a household products company that eventually held 92% of the American market in 1996.

He accompanied the Aurora on its first Antarctic voyage—south from Hobart to Macquarie Island, on to the Antarctic mainland to drop off the land parties, and back to Australia. However, Davis thought Toutcher a \"hopeless fool\", and he was replaced by Frank D. Fletcher on 12 March 1912, when the Aurora arrived back in Hobart. Cape Toutcher, on the west coast of Macquarie Island, is named after him."

  "text" : "Nikola Petkov Pushkarov (Bulgarian Никола Петков Пушкаров) (1874–1934) was the first Bulgarian soil researcher and founder of the soil science in Bulgaria. He was also an activist of the Internal Macedonian-Adrianople Revolutionary Organization. Nikola Pushkarov was born on December 14, 1874 in Pirdop, then in the Ottoman Empire. He graduated from elementary school in his hometown and high school in Sofia. Afterwards Pushkarov taught as a teacher in Mirkovo. In the period 1898-1901 he studied natural sciences at the Sofia University. Later he taught in the Bulgarian High School in Skopje, where he became a member of Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization (IMRO). In 1902 he received a task from Gotse Delchev to reinforce the Skopje Revolutionary Region. As a result, Pushkarov was elected as a president of the Skopje Revolutionary Committee of IMRO in 1902. Pushkarov was also the editor of the IMRO organizational newsletter in Skopje, \"Freedom or death\". As a whole the revolutionary network, in Skopje Region was not well developed and the lack of weapons was a serious problem. On the other hand, in some areas, as in Kumanovo, the strong pro-Serbian propaganda gained support, and other districts, as Kratovo, were under the control of the Supremists. Before the start of the Ilinden Uprising in 1903 Pushkarov had on his disposal an armed detachment of 18 people, which carried 100 kilograms of dynamite and 200 bombs. At the outbreak of the uprising Pushkarov was a chief of the rebel forces in the Skopje Region. On July 22, the band of Pushkarov settled in the Monastery \"St. John\", near the village of Vetarsko, close towhere the river Pchinya flows into Vardar. From there the cheta could control the traffic on the railway. The detachment moved from the monastery to the village of Novachene and on August 1, they derailed a military train with 32 carriages. On 3 and 5 August respectively, they attacked a Turkish unit, guarding the bridge on the Vardar river and gave a battle in the \"St. John\" monastery. In the next few days the band was pursued by numerous Bashibozuks and moved slowly to Bulgaria, because it carried the wounded rebels with it. On August 20 the band runs through Vranje in Kyustendil. Nicola Pushkarov formed a new band there, which went into Macedonia again. The cheta moved to Kriva Palanka and in October after a battle in Prelesiya returned to Bulgaria. After the uprising Pushkarov returned to Bulgaria. As he could no longer return to Skopje, as the Turkish police actively sought him, he worked as a teacher in Plovdiv, Sofia and Vidin. Later he devoted himself to scientific work. He dealt with the study of the soil types and created the first soil map of Bulgaria in 1931. Pushkarov died on February 18, 1943 in Sofia. His native house in Pirdop today is a house museum. On his name was named the Institute of Soil Science in Sofia."

  "text" : "Sir Nicholas Mosley (ca. 1527 – 12 December 1612), also spelt Mosly and Moseley, was a manufacturer of woolen cloth, who subsequently became lord of the manor of Manchester, and a Lord Mayor of London. Nicholas Mosley was born in or near Manchester in c. 1527, supposedly the eldest son of Edward Moseley and his wife Margaret Moseley (née Elcock). With his younger brothers, Oswald (1534-1621), Francis (1535-1570), and Anthonie (1537-1607), he appears to have initiated what became a highly successful business as a woolen manufacturer and merchant. By the early 1550s, Mosley had moved from Manchester to London as a step in the expansion of the business. Mosley went on to become a city of London merchant and a member of the Worshipful Company of Clothworkers. In London (on 20 February 1553) Mosley married Margery Whitbroke at All Hallows, Honey Lane, in the City of London. They were to have a total of nine known children, of whom the youngest, Edward, became a highly successful barrister, was knighted by King James I in 1614; was appointed a justice of the peace and Attorney-General for the Duchy of Lancaster; was elected as an MP for Preston in 1614, 1620-2, and 1624-5; and was the Mosley who first acquired the estates at Rolleston on Dove, in Staffordshire, held by the Mosley family for 400 years from the early 1600s until the 20th Century (see below). Between the early 1560s and the mid to late 1570s, Mosley returned to the Manchester area (where five of his children were baptized at St James' Chapel, Didsbury, between 1562 and 1568). However, after the death of his brother Francis in c. 1570-71, Mosley returned to London to manage the commercial end of the family business. In 1589 Mosley was elected an alderman of the City of London for Aldersgate ward. In 1591 he was a Sheriff of London. In 1592 (following the death of his first wife) he married the widow Elizabeth Hendley (née Rookes) at All Hallows, Bread Street in the City of London. He moved to become alderman for Langbourn ward in 1594, remaining until 1602. In 1596, he bought the manor of Manchester and the same year began to build Hough End Hall at Chorlton-cum-Hardy, Withington. In 1599, he was elected Lord Mayor of London. His mayoralty was notable for the fact that there was a significant threat of Spanish invasion during that year, and Mosley was required to raise funds and forces for the defense of London. He was knighted by Queen Elizabeth I between 15 March – 2 July 1600. He was High Sheriff of Lancashire from 1609 to 1610. Mosley was responsible for formalizing the spelling of the family name as \"Mosley\" when, in 1592, he sought and obtained \"the grant of a crest to be borne with his paternal arms, the same being duly entered and then enrolled in the Heralds' College.\" The text further states that, \"It became a fashionable practice in the reign of Queen Elizabeth [I] to assume some motto bearing a quaint allusion to the family name, and in conformity with [this fashion], as well as out of compliment to his youngest son, Edward, who was just then rising to eminence in his profession as a barrister, Sir Nicholas adopted the Latin words, 'Mos legem regit' ('Custom, or precedent, rules the law').\" Mosley died in 1612 and was buried in the Church of St James, Didsbury, where a monument shows him kneeling, \"dressed in the robes of the Lord Mayor of London\". In his will, he left £100 to employ a schoolmaster at a salary of £5 a year for 20 years after his death. The Mosley Baronetcy of Rolleston, Staffordshire, was created in 1640 in the Baronetage of England for Mosley's grandson Sir Edward Mosley, 1st Baronet, of Rolleston Hall."

  "text" : "Nellie Casman (1896–1984) was an actress and singer in Yiddish theater. She was born in Proskurov, Russia, and moved to the United States in the early 1900s; her father was a hazzan. Casman showed such talent as an actress when a child, the actress Rose Rubin took her into a professional Yiddish theater, where she began to play child roles in 1910. Playing Gitele in Zalmen Libin's Gebrokhene hertser (Broken Hearts), she came to the attention of Regina Prager's husband, a theater manager, who hired her for his company in New York. She played several years as a soubrette in vaudeville houses and became successful enough to be hired to replace Bessie Thomashevsky in Edelstein's People's Theater where she played opposite David Kessler in Mish Mash. She then abandoned \"legitimate theater\" and went back to vaudeville (in English as well as Yiddish). She recorded Yiddish songs and couplets for the Victor and Columbia labels. She married playwright Samuel Steinberg and collaborated with him in writing songs and shows; their biggest hit, written in 1923, was Yosl, Yosl, popularized in English by the Andrews Sisters in 1938. She went to Warsaw in 1929, concertizing and appearing in her husband's play A khasndl oyf shabos. The couple went to Russia as well, where she performed in Dos vaybele. They then went to Argentina and toured with equal success. She played at the Odeon Theater in New York and then went back to Argentina where she performed Spanish songs and appeared in Steinberg's Di Komediantke. In 1932 she performed in London, Paris, Berlin, and Riga, then back to Warsaw. Her most popular character was a \"Little Cantor\" in the Aron Nager's play \"Dos Khazndl\". In 1937 she played Di zingerin at the Roxbury and then left again for Argentina, where she toured the provinces in Lilian's operetta A shif mit kabtsonim (A ship with paupers) She performed on radio and later on TV, in English, and did some film work at Paramount Studio. In 1973, she appeared in the film The Adventures of Rabbi Jacob. Casman played Pathe on the TV show The Goldbergs for eight years, reprising the role in a 1950 film. She and her husband wrote a musical comedy, The Showgirl, performed by the Shalom Yiddish Musical Comedy Theater at Town Hall in 1982. She died in New York City."

  "text" : "Nathan Jackson (born August 29, 1938) is an Alaska Native artist. He is among the most important living Tlingit artists and the most important Alaskan artists. He is best known for his totem poles, but works in a variety of media. Jackson belongs to the Sockeye clan on the Raven side of the Chilkoot Tlingit. As a young adult, he served in the military in Germany, and then became involved in commercial fishing. While ill with pneumonia and unable to fish, he began to carve miniature totem poles. His interest in art was piqued, and he enrolled in the Institute of American Indian Arts in Santa Fe, New Mexico. Since then, Jackson's work has included large totem poles, canoes, carved doors, wood panel clan crests, masks, and jewelry. Jackson has worked to pass on traditional Tlingit carving skills to younger artists, and has offered many demonstrations and workshops in Alaska and the Pacific Northwest. Jackson has created more than 50 totem poles, some of which are on display in the National Museum of the American Indian, the Field Museum in Chicago, Harvard University's Peabody Museum, and other museums in the United States, Europe, and Japan. Other totem poles stand outside Juneau-Douglas High School, Juneau's Centennial Hall, in Juneau's Sealaska Building, in Totem Bight State Historical Park, at the Alaska Native Heritage Center, at Saxman Totem Park, and at the Totem Heritage Center in Ketchikan. He is a recipient of a National Endowment for the Arts National Heritage Fellowship (1995), a Rasmuson Foundation Distinguished Artist Award (2009), and an honorary doctorate in humanities from the University of Alaska Southeast. Jackson currently resides in Ketchikan, Alaska. His wife and son are also artists."

  "text" : "Noman M. Benotman (born 1967) is the former head of the Libyan militant organization known as the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group. Benotman has been active in reforming his former terrorist comrades in prison, attempting to persuade them to renounce violence. He wrote an open letter to Osama bin Laden in 2010 repudiating al-Qaeda's use of violence, and calling on bin Laden to unilaterally halt all attacks. He is also a Senior Analyst (Strategic Communications) at Quilliam, a British-government-funded Middle East focused think tank. Noman Benotman has lived a hard life living in exile overseas during the Qaddafi‘s regime of 42 years of power hold on Libya. Noman comes from a wealthy Tripolitania family that suffered under the past regime, Qaddafi confiscated many properties like land, houses, factories and buildings belonging to Noman’s father and many other well known Libyan families that also lived a harsh life under the Qaddafi regime. During the '80s the beginning of Gaddafi’s oppression on many Libyans, Noman fled Libya and decided to join the Jihad call to take up arms during the Soviet occupation in Afghanistan, he fought for an Islamic cause and made many friends in his teenaged life. After several years of fighting Communists Russia that invaded Afghanistan the Jihad was a victory to all Muslims, Russia withdraws its troops from Afghanistan. Noman then realized with the knowledge gained fighting the Soviets in Afghanistan using guerilla combat tactics that his country was also occupied and needed to do the same in Libya, establishing a network of Libyans to fight Qaddafi and to overthrow the regime from power establishment of the (LIFG) the Libyan Islamic fighting group came to birth in the late '80s early '90s their mission target was Qaddafi. The LIFG was the most feared by from Qaddafi they have taken the war to his door using all tactics to combat Qaddafi and his forces in Libya. Many attempts on Qaddafi’s life were made during the regime's 42 years of power but none were successful enough to end his life. Qaddafi used Libya’s Oil reserves and all assets he could to stay in power to fight the LIFG Islamists and other Libyan organizations. Qaddafi was successful crushing the Revolt in the '90s and many LIFG members were caught captured and killed some served in Libya’s Notorious famous Prison named Abou Sleem and awaiting death sentence. The LIFG kept fighting until the September 11th attacks on the United States soil. It was a blow to the organization leaving America and the United Kingdom only to label the LIFG as a terrorist organization bringing all operation to overthrow Qaddafi from power to a full stop, reports showed that Bin Laden had funded the LIFG baking the group with funds and helping them obtain weapons. In the beginning of 2007 with pressure from Libya by Qaddafi requesting the British Government to hand over people Like Noman to Libyan Authorities labeling them terrorists, Noman was forced to fight for his life in London obtaining a UK citizenship helping Noman not to be extradited to Libya he was active in Politics and was chosen to mediate the release of his former comrades in arms, He had the support of the British government and was backed by the new slogan (de-radicalization of Hardcore Islamists) Qaddafi was shocked and frustrated by the UK and had no choice but to accept the UK Government proposal if he ever wanted back in the world international community. Noman was very successful in mediating the release of his former comrades. Many regarded Noman as a traitor for dealing with the Qaddafi regime during 2007/2010 mediation but he had no choice, in the end Noman saw his fellow Comrades as brothers and had to do something to save their lives. At present he is the president of Quillam Foundation in London. He has appeared on many TV channels as an expert in Terrorism and the Middle east, more recently as the expert on the Arab Spring and its effects; despite working with Saif ul Islam Gaddafi to free his comrades from the notorious prison named Abousleem. At the time of the start of the Libyan uprising, he was in Tripoli meeting with Saif Gaddafi with the supervision of the British Government, calling some of the rebels 'Al Qaeda' operatives pointing to Mokhtar Belmokhtar as he had information during the Libyan uprising that some Islamic hardcore militant had entered Libya. The Washington Post quoted Benotman in 2006 in a profile of Atiyah Abd al-Rahman, another Libyan exile who was to rise to a senior membership of Al Qaeda's leadership.Benotman said that Atiyah had been taken captive by the Armed Islamic Group, in Algeria, in the mid 1990s."

As the president of the New Guinea Council was the Dutch civil servant Frits Sollewijn Gelpke, Jouwe was the highest ranking Papuan politician in the colony. After the colony was ceded to the United Nations Temporary Executive Authority in October 1962 and subsequently to Indonesia six months later, Jouwe left New Guinea for the Netherlands, where he settled in the town of Delft. He vowed never to return to his native land if it were still occupied by Indonesia, but nevertheless resettled to West Papua in 2010 to die there. In October 2008, a documentary was broadcast on Dutch television about Jouwe's life. In the documentary, Jouwe reiterated his stance not to return to Indonesian occupied West Papua. In January 2009, however, he was invited by the Indonesian government to visit his ancestral land. Jouwe responded positively, and visited Papua and Indonesia in March 2009. About this visit a follow-up documentary was made by the same director."

Ni organized with neighbors to attempt to save their homes or demand equitable compensation. In 2002, Ni was arrested while filming the destruction of a neighbor's home. She was disbarred and sentenced to a year in prison. As a result of torture incurred in prison in 2002, Ni was left permanently disabled, and she now uses a wheelchair. Soon after the 2008 Beijing Olympics, Ni was again arrested for advocating on behalf of displaced residents, and sentenced to two years in prison. Upon her release, she had to live in a tent, since she was a victim of land eviction herself. On 7 April 2011, Ni and her husband were detained by police as part of a nationwide crackdown on dissent. On 29 December 2011, Chinese authorities put Yulan on trial for fraud in Beijing. In April 2012, Ni was sentenced to two and a half years in prison for “making trouble” and \"fraud.\" Her husband, Dong Jiqin, was similarly sentenced to two years for \"making trouble.\" In 2011, Ni was the recipient of the Human rights defenders tulip, an annual award presented by the government of the Netherlands.

Cameron was associated with the cocaine-fuelled ravages of the razor gang violence of that era, commonly associated with her contemporaries, Tilly Devine and Kate Leigh, both criminal entrepreneurs who controlled much of Sydney's illegal sex industry and Sly-grog distribution during that period. Nellie Cameron received 73 criminal convictions during her life of crime, mainly for soliciting and vagrancy, and had the distinction of becoming the first woman in Australia to be convicted of consorting with criminals."

His first single, \"Image of a Girl\", a cover version of a US top ten hit by The Safaris, reached # 37 on the British singles chart in 1960, but was outsold by Mark Wynter's rival version of the same song. Two follow-ups, \"Keep Loving Me\" (1960) and \"Miracles Are Happening To Me\" (1961) failed to reach the chart, and Keene's recording career appears to have ended at that point. He was reported as living in Australia in 2010."

He was the son of Svante Stensson Sture and Märta (\"King Martha\") Erikdotter Leijonhufvud. His diplomatic missions included negotiations at the court of Elizabeth I of England in 1561, with John of Finland in 1562, and at the court of Lorraine in 1566/67. As a soldier, he participated in the Nordic Seven Years War's battles of Varberg and Axtorna, where he was wounded, and in the Siege of Bohus. Sture fell into disgrace twice, due to Erik XIV's general distrust of the aristocracy and his astrology-based fear that Sture might usurp his throne. On 15 June 1566, after a death sentence Sture had received was commuted, he was publicly humiliated in Stockholm, where he was forced to ride a wretched hack through town with a straw crown on his head. On 21 May 1567, returning from his final mission in Lorraine, he was arrested again in Uppsala Castle. In what became known as the Sture Murders (Sturemorden), he was murdered in his cell three days later by Erik XIV in person."

In 1942, at the age of 18, he enlisted with the Royal Australian Navy and was sent to HMAS Cerberus in Victoria for training. During his time in Victoria, Way played eight VFL games for St Kilda, before discharging from the Navy at the year's end. While he studied at the University of Adelaide during the 1940s, Way was one of the leading centre half-forwards of the SANFL, playing with Norwood. He was the leading goal-kicker at Norwood in 1945 with 39 goals and again in 1947 when he kicked 49 goals. The runner-up in the 1947 Magarey Medal count, Way also enjoyed team success, participating in Norwood's 1946 and 1950 premiership winning teams. He made a total of nine interstate appearances for South Australia, some of which came in the 1947 Hobart Carnival. Seven of his 19 interstate goals were kicked in South Australia's win over the VFL in 1945. He went on to have a medical career, starting out at Royal Adelaide Hospital. In 1953 he moved to England for two years and qualified as a Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons of England. When he came back to Australia he joined the Royal Perth Hospital where he worked as a general surgeon until his retirement in 1989."

Since its opening on 3 July 1996, Cruz has headed the Fundación Sobrevivientes (Survivors' Foundation), a Guatemala City-based women's rights organization. This foundation seeks to provide \"emotional, social, and legal support to hundreds of female victims seeking justice and protection.\" According to the US Department of State, \"in 2007 alone, her foundation helped find, prosecute and convict 30 individuals accused of murdering women. The NGO runs a victims’ shelter — one of only a handful in the country — and also fights to protect mothers whose babies are stolen as the first link in an illegal and lucrative supply chain for international adoptions.\" In 2009, the US Department of State named Cruz an International Woman of Courage, stating that Cruz served as \"an inspiration and symbol of courage and hope to women in Guatemala and women everywhere who are working for positive change.\" She received the award from US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and First Lady Michelle Obama. Since May 2009, Norma Cruz has been subject to repeated threats of rape and murder by text message and phone; her family has also reported threats. Though the Guatemalan government has provided her with police protection, the threats have reportedly continued, leading Amnesty International to name her work a \"priority case\" in 2011. In March 2011, her organization's offices were damaged by a Molotov cocktail, though no one was hurt in the attack. In Spring 2011, Boston's American Repertory Theater and System of a Down's Serj Tankian dedicated their production of Prometheus Bound to Cruz and seven other activists, stating in program notes that \"by singing the story of Prometheus, the God who defied the tyrant Zeus by giving the human race both fire and art, this production hopes to give a voice to those currently being silenced or endangered by modern-day oppressors.\""

  "text" : "Nellie Wallace (18 March 1870 – 24 November 1948) was a British music hall star, actress, comedian, dancer and songwriter who became one of the most famous and best loved music hall performers. She became known as \"The Essence Of Eccentricity\". she dressed in ultra-tight skirts (so tight in fact, that she would lie down on the stage and shuffle back and forth on her back to pick up whatever she had contrived to drop), her hat sported a lone daisy, feather or a fish bone and once even a lit candle (supposedly, so she could see where she was going and where she had been). Wallace was born in Glasgow in 1870 as Eleanor Jane Wallis Tayler. Her father, Francis George Tayler, was a vocalist and musician and her mother a retired actress who became a teacher and governess. Her first solo performance on the stage was as a clog dancer at the age of 12 in Birmingham. Prior to this, she had performed with her sisters Emma and Fanny, also singers and dancers. She had a rapid rise to fame and became much loved by her audiences. Not a naturally pretty woman, a reviewer noted her 'grotesque get-up', which started the audience laughing the moment she appeared on stage; her cleverness, vivacity and facial expressions were second to none. Wallace's London debut came in 1903, and by 1910 she was given billing at the London Palladium. Her career lasted until her death in 1948; she appeared in the Royal Command Performance of that year. Her main character was a frustrated spinster, singing ribald songs such as \"Under the Bed,\" \"Let's Have a Tiddley at the Milk Bar\" and \"Mother's Pie Crust.\" Other well known songs in her repertoire included: \"Meet Me,\" \"The Sniff Song,\" \"Three Cheers for the Red White & Blue,\" \"Half Past Nine,\" \"Geranium,\" \"Tally Ho!,\" \"The Blasted Oak,\" \"Three Times a Day\" and \"Bang! Bang! Bang!\" Her appearance made her unusually successful as a pantomime dame — a role usually performed by men. She usually wore a fur stole, which she described as her \"little bit of vermin\". Wallace appeared in a \"short\", filmed in 1902, entitled: A Lady's First lesson On A Bicycle. She later moved into bigger budget productions and appeared in The Golden Pippin Girl (1920); The Wishbone (1933); Radio Parade of 1935 (1934), alongside fellow music hall performer Lily Morris and established actor Will Hay; Variety (1935) and Boys Will Be Girls (1936). Nellie Wallace died in a London nursing home on 24 November 1948, aged 78, after a serious bout of bronchitis. The Wallis WA-116 Agile gyrocopter featured in the James Bond film You Only Live Twice \"Little Nellie\" was named after her, as was \"Wet Nellie\", the submarine Lotus Esprit from the James Bond film The Spy Who Loved Me."

  "text" : "Neil Anderson is a Sheffield-based author and journalist who first came to prominence in the mid-1990s with the Dirty Stop Out’s Guide to Sheffield which was published at the height of the dance club explosion of the era. This tour around the highlights and lowlights of Sheffield at night attracted critical acclaim from titles including The Rough Guide to England, DJ Magazine and The Times. His Take It To The Limit book about legendary venue The Limit, which ran on Sheffield’s West Street from 1978 to 1991, became a best-seller in 2009. Launched by Sex Pistol Glen Matlock, the book’s launch party was attended by members of the Human League, Pulp, Artery, Vice Versa (who later became ABC) and other bands who played early gigs at the venue. Sheffield’s Date With Hitler was published in 2010 to commemorate the 70th anniversary of the Sheffield Blitz. The book formed the basis of BBC1’s Sheffield The Forgotten Blitz documentary and followed over a year of research and attempts to explain why the city’s munitions works were largely missed by the Luftwaffe on December 12 and 15, 1940. Also in 2010, Anderson wrote Signing On For The Devil which chronicled Sheffield’s heavy metal music dominance in the 1980s. His Dirty Stop Out’s Guide to 1970s Sheffield became known countrywide as the book that reunited Chris and Ann Jackson and inspired them to get remarried after 26 years apart. Anderson is a regular contributor to the international music magazine Vive Le Rock. He is working on projects including citywide plans to mark the 75th anniversary of the Sheffield Blitz and the Dirty Stop Out's Guide to 1960s London with Peter Stringfellow. He also runs PR/publishing company Neil Anderson Media."

He appeared in more than one hundred television dramas on the BBC and ITV during the course of his career, including Our Friends in the North, Poldark and House of Cards. Selby was also a long-standing member of the Royal Shakespeare Company. Selby was born in London on 13 September 1925. He served in the British army during World War II, making his stage debut in Dangerous Corner at Preston, Lancashire, for the forces' entertainment organisation ENSA. In 1948 he enrolled at the Central School of Speech and Drama, receiving commendation for his student performance in Mary Hayley Bell's Men in Shadow. There then followed seasons in repertory at Liverpool, Birmingham, Coventry, York, Hornchurch and Cambridge. His first professional West End appearance was in 1959, in William Douglas-Home's Aunt Edwina. In 1963 Selby made his first appearances for the Royal Shakespeare Company, as Casca in Julius Caesar, the Bishop of Winchester in The Wars of The Roses and Antonio in The Tempest. His association with the company lasted for ten years, until he followed Peter Hall to the new National Theatre in London in 1976. In his first season there he appeared as Menander in Tamburlaine and the Captain in Tales from the Vienna Woods. He was van Swieten in the inaugural production Amadeus and the parliamentary Speaker in The Madness of George III. His last stage role was as Dilly Knox in Breaking the Code in 1987. Selby died in London on 14 September 2010, at the age of 85. He was preceded by his wife, Kathleen Rayner, for whom he had been caring during her ill-health for many years."

  "text" : "Noxolo Nogwaza (1987 – 24 April 2011) was a South African lesbian LGBT rights activist and member of the Ekurhuleni Pride Organising Committee. She was raped, then stoned and stabbed to death by assailants in KwaThema, Gauteng. Nogwaza had been with a friend at a bar the previous evening, and had a heated argument with a group of men who had propositioned her friend. Police found used condoms, a beer bottle, and a large rock around Nogwaza's body, which was left in a drainage ditch. The attack on Nogwaza appeared to be a corrective rape, a practice by which men sexually assault women believed to be lesbians in an attempt to \"correct\" their sexual preference. 31 women had been murdered during corrective rape in South Africa over the previous decade, and according to the rape survivor charity Luleki Sizwe, at least 10 lesbians per week were raped in the Cape Town area. Human Rights Watch described the attack as part of a hate crime \"epidemic\" against South African gays, comparing it to the rape and murder of footballer and lesbian activist Eudy Simelane in the same township three years before. More than 2,000 people attended her funeral. At one point, some of the mourners sang that they would castrate the suspects with razor blades themselves if police failed to arrest them. 170,000 people worldwide signed a petition for authorities to crack down on corrective rape. Noxolo left behind 2 young children. After her death, the US-based nonprofit GO Campaign stepped in to raise funds for the children's education and to promote a tolerance campaign for youth in the township. Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International called the killing a hate crime. A police spokesperson refused to classify it as a hate crime, stating, \"murder is murder\" and that police did not consider a victim's sexual orientation. No arrests had been made in the case of as November 2012. In November 2012, Amnesty International featured the case in its \"Write for Rights\" campaign, calling for a renewed investigation into the murder."

  "text" : "Neil Robinson (born 20 April 1957, Walton, Liverpool, Lancashire) is a former footballer. The youngest of a family of 7 children (6 boys, 1 girl), he played for Everton, Swansea City, Grimsby Town and Darlington. Born just 100 yards away from Everton Football Club's ground, Goodison Park, in Spellow Lane, Walton Liverpool), Robinson began his football career as an apprentice professional at his beloved Everton FC in April 1973, age 16. He signed as a full-time professional for Everton one year later in April 1974. He scored his only goal for Everton at Goodison park in the last game of the 1977–78 season beating Chelsea 6–0, the game which saw Bob Latchford score his 30th goal to win a £10,000 prize offered by a national newspaper for the first footballer to reach 30 goals in a single season. Robinson became a vegetarian at age 13 in 1970 and in 1980, age 23, he became a vegan and is reportedly the first vegan footballer to have played professionally. Robinson was the Grimsby Town Player of the Year for 1985–86 and is the youngest brother of Sir Ken Robinson, a world-renowned authority on creativity and innovation."

De Bruyn was the son of the sugar manufacturer Jan de Bruyn and nephew of the engraver Abraham de Bruyn. He was the brother-in-law of Jan van Londerseel, another Flemish engraver who would move to Rotterdam. He was trained in the art of engraving by his uncle Abraham. He did not follow he style of his master, either in the style of his execution, or in the size of his plates. He appears to have studied and to have formed his style from the works of Lucas van Leyden. His compositions are abundant, but he lacked taste in the selection of his forms. He finished his plates very neatly with the burin. There is not much effect in his print as he was not skilled in chiaroscuro. Notwithstanding this defect, which was very general in the period in which he lived, his works possess considerable merit. He worked in Rotterdam from 1617 onwards, and he died there in 1656. He signed his plates sometimes with his initials N. de B., and sometimes with a monogram. The following are his principal works:"

He is a member of the Advisory Committee of Human Rights Watch's Middle East Division, Deputy Secretary General for the International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH), former chairman of CARAM Asia, member of the Advisory Board of the Bahrain Rehabilitation and Anti-Violence Organization (BRAVO), and president of Gulf Center for Human Rights (GCHR). Rajab started his human rights activity during the 1990s uprising before going on to become involved in campaigning on behalf of migrant workers in GCC countries.He is known for his pioneering use of social networking as an important element in human rights campaigning which has brought him into conflict with the authorities. Front Line Defenders, Human Rights Watch (HRW) and Reporters Without Borders have described him as being targeted by Bahraini authorities for his human rights activities. During the Bahraini uprising, in which he led numerous protests, he has clashed with the political authorities and security forces. As well as criticizing the Bahraini government itself, he has also been sharply critical of the role of Bahrain's allies, including the United States. Following protests during the Formula 1 race in April 2012 that attracted media attention, Rajab was arrested and incarcerated several times. On 9 July, he was detained and sentenced to three months prison for having \"insulted Bahrainis\" in a Twitter message and most recently on 16 August, while still in detention, Rajab was sentenced to three years' imprisonment on three protest-related charges. The verdict has drawn criticism from Bahrain's western allies and human rights organizations. In December, 2012, the sentence was reduced to 2 years in prison after appeal. In December 2013, a court denied him early release. He was released on 24 May 2014, after serving 2 years in prison. He was re-arrested on 1 October over criticizing the government on Twitter. On 2 November he was released on bail, pending his next trial on 20 January 2015. Rajab's human rights work has been recognized internationally but within Bahraini society he remains a figure of controversy. Labeled as the informal leader of the uprising and a hero to protesters, Rajab is viewed by government supporters as a troublemaker."

  "text" : "Norman Hyde is a motorcycle development engineer, racer and world record holder. Hyde joined Triumph motorcycles as an apprentice in 1964. Following the closure of the factory at Meriden in 1973, Norman moved to the Kitts Green site run by Norton Triumph International. When that shut down in 1975 he used his redundancy payment to establish his own business, designing and selling performance parts for Triumph twins and triples. Having passed his mechanical engineering diploma with flying colours in 1968 Norman secured a position in Triumph’s racing development department, working under Doug Hele, the legendary Chief Development Engineer. As a result, Norman was directly involved in the development of the T120, T140, T150, T160 and T180 twins and triples, as well as projects that never made it into production, like the four-cylinder Quadrent, OHC Triple and 350cc Bandit twin. He and his colleagues also supported the factory’s racers, including Percy Tait. Hyde is particularly proud of the Triumph Trident triple, launched in 1969, which, along with the Honda 750/4, redefined the sportsbike sector of that era. When not at work, Norman was racing motorcycles for fun. Following a frustrating foray into trials, he discovered an aptitude for drag racing and sprinting. In 1968 he took the World Record for a standing start 1/4 mile in his Triumph 350cc sidecar outfit and in 1969 he beat the World Record for a standing start kilometre on a Triumph 500cc twin (set by the works Gilera two years previously). In 1972 Norman captured the World Sidecar Land Speed Record on his Roadrunner III 850cc Triumph Trident powered outfit, at an average speed of 161.8 mph, a record that remained unbeaten for over 35 years. Having started his own performance parts business early in 1976, Hyde used his engineering experience to design his own bikes and in 1987 he introduced the Hyde Harrier, a café racer kit for Bonneville and Trident engines using a frame developed with Harris Performance. This was followed up in 1995 by the Hornet, a 126 mph single-cylinder motorcycle, also Harris-framed, powered by a 600cc Rotax engines tuned to produce 70 bhp. Following the rebirth of Triumph at their new Hinckley factory and the introduction of the retro-styled Bonneville, Norman introduced a wide range of performance and styling parts for the new British twins."

  "text" : "Nadira Isayeva or Isaeva (Russian: Нади́ра Иса́ева) is a Russian journalist who has been internationally recognized for her reporting on security issues in North Caucasus. Isayeva is editor-in-chief of the weekly newspaper Chernovik (English: Rough Draft) in Dagestan, described by Reporters Without Borders as \"Dagestan’s leading independent newspaper\". In this role, she ran a series of articles criticizing the Federal Security Service's tactics in fighting the region's insurgency. In 2008, she published an interview with a former guerrilla leader in which the subject accused local authorities of corruption and connections to the Kremlin. She was subsequently arrested on 31 July under anti-extremist legislation for \"inciting hatred toward law enforcement officials\" and other charges. If convicted, she would have faced up to five years' imprisonment. Chernovik reporters Magomed Magomedov, Artur Mamayev and Timur Mustafayev were also charged, along with their lawyer Biyakai Magomedov. The trial began in January 2010, with the prosecution claiming that Isayeva's articles \"publicly justified terrorism\". The prosecution also required her to take part in multiple psychological and linguistic examinations, on which its case was largely built. Following a defense challenge, the findings of these examinations were overturned by the Federal Centre for Forensic Examination in Moscow, and the case against Isayeva and her colleagues was dismissed on 19 May 2011. Following her acquittal, Isayeva stated that she saw the case as \"a test for the institution of press freedom\" in Dagestan. Isayeva's reporting and prosecution drew the attention of numerous press and press freedom organizations. The editorial board of the US newspaper The Washington Post has praised Isayeva's work, calling her a \"first-rate journalist\" and \"hero\". UK press freedom group ARTICLE 19 condemned her prosecution as part of a \"trend\" of harassment by authorities of Dagestani reporters. Reporters Without Borders and the Committee to Protect Journalists both hailed her acquittal, and the latter organization awarded her a 2010 International Press Freedom Award for risking her \"freedom and security\" for her reporting. Following continued harassment by authorities, Isayeva left Dagestan in November 2011. On 15 December Gadzhimurat Kamalov, Isayeva's former boss at Chernovik and close colleague, was shot dead by an unknown gunman. CPJ described his death as \"a lethal blow to press freedom\" and \"a massive loss for independent journalism in the North Caucasus, Russia's most dangerous place for reporters\". After staying with friends in Moscow for two months, Isayeva was named a visiting scholar at Columbia University's Harriman Institute in the U.S., arriving there in February 2012."

  "text" : "Nils Daniel Bang (13 September 1941 – 2 December 1977) was a South African oceanographic scientist who was a pioneer in the study of the fine structure of coastal upwelling systems. In March 1969, Bang initiated, planned and executed South Africa's first truly multi-ship oceanographical research operation, the Agulhas Current Project, along the current's length. Although the research was conducted on a limited budget and with rudimentary equipment, Bang's studies using thousands of closely spaced bathythermograph readings were later corroborated by satellite imagery and airborne radiation thermometry. In the field of physical oceanography, in the fine structure of coastal upwelling systems, Bang—along with W.R.H (Bill) Andrews and Larry Hutchings, his counterparts in biological oceanography—produced work that was acclaimed in their field. Bang's work shed light on the dynamics of the interleaving water masses of the frontal zone in coastal upwelling systems and the meandering of the front. At the time of his death, aged 36, Bang was acting head of the Physical Oceanography Division of the National Research Institute for Oceanology at the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (South Africa)."

  "text" : "Norman Davis MBE FBA (16 May 1913 – 2 December 1989) was a New Zealand-born professor of English language and literature at the University of Oxford. Davis was born in 1913 at Dunedin, New Zealand. He received his education at Otago Boys' High School and the University of Otago, where he was taught by Professor Herbert Ramsay. He was awarded a Rhodes scholarship to Merton College, Oxford, in 1934 and studied comparative philology. From 1937–38, he lectured in English at the University of Kaunas in Lithuania, and then at the University of Sofia, Bulgaria, 1938–39. According to his biographer James McNeish, Davis was \"undistinguished in appearance\" and had a talent for mimicry. When the Second World War broke out, he was recruited by the Special Operations Executive of British Intelligence and became Assistant Press Attache at the British Legation in Sofia. In 1941, he warned the British ambassador in Sofia George William Rendel of the imminent Bulgarian entering of the Axis. He smuggled the leader of the Bulgarian resistance G. M. Dimitrov out of Bulgaria to the safety of the British Legation in Turkey (January-February 1941). He was trying to escape from Yugoslavia when he was captured by the Italians and interned in Italy for three months, before being repatriated to England. He continued his clandestine work, operating out of Turkey under an assumed name. His wife Lena was also \"in the firm\". Davis and G. M. Dimitrov were tried in Sofia for subversion and sentenced in absentia to execution by hanging. At the end of the War, Davis had reached the rank of major and in 1945 was awarded the MBE. He resumed his university teaching, as a lecturer in English language at Queen Mary College, University of London, in 1946, having proceeded to MA at Oxford in 1944. He was then appointed to a similar position at Oriel and Brasenose Colleges, Oxford, where he also lectured in Medieval English. From 1949 to 1959, he taught at Glasgow University. He then followed J. R. R. Tolkien as Merton Professor of English Language and Literature at Oxford, until his retirement in 1980. According to McNeish,\"... he liked to say that his achievement was that he \"added a letter to the Bulgarian alphabet\", but his monument is the great edition of the Paston Letters, \"a text throwing light on the attitudes of a 15th-century English family in Norfolk on the make.\" Davis died in Oxford on 2 December 1989. Practically his entire estate was left to the University of Otago. According to McNeish, the proper use of the funds was contested by the executor, as the University Council decided to use them to fund visiting academics, rather than sending New Zealand scholars to benefit from study at Oxford."

Dailakis was born in the village of Vernik, Devoll District, modern Bulqizë municipality in southern Albania (Northern Epirus). He participated in various operations of Greek guerillas groups under the revolutionary leader Konstantinos Christou or Captain Kottas against Bulgarian groups in Ottoman Macedonia. During this time he was ransomed by the local Ottoman landlord Hussein bey, but although his hideout near Hoçisht was surrounded, he managed to escape. After the Balkan Wars Dailakis settled near the city of Kastoria, Western Macedonia, Greece. In 1941, during the Axis Occupation of Greece he was assassinated by the left wing resistance. Today a quarter in the city of Kastoria bears his name."

  "text" : "Sir Nicholas Martyn (12 April 1593 – 25 March 1653) was an English politician who sat in the House of Commons from 1646 to 1648. Martyn was the son of Sir William Martyn and his wife Susan Prestwood, of Exeter. He was educated at Broadgates Hall, Oxford matriculating on 8 March 1611, at the age of 17. He became a student of the Middle Temple in 1613. He was knighted by King James I at his Court at Newmarket on 12 February 1624. He was landowner of Oxton and Kenton and in November 1639 he became High Sheriff of Devon. In 1641, in a year of plots and treasons, Martyn was proclaimed a traitor by the king, and he was excepted from the offer of a general pardon together with Sir George Chudleigh, Sir John Northcote, and Sir Samuel Rolle. He was included in an order clearing proclaimed persons issued on the 7 December 1642. In June 1646, he was elected Member of Parliament for Devon in the Long Parliament. He was added to the committee of militia for Devon in 1648 and was excluded under Pride's Purge at the end of the year. Martyn died at Netherex at the age of 59. It is said that before he died, as he lay sick at his house, one of the bells of the church began to toll of its own accord and continued for about a quarter of an hour until the time of his death. A monument was erected in Kenton church. Martyn married Elizabeth Symes, of Pounsford, Somerset. His daughter, who married a wollen draper of Watling Street in the city, provided sanctuary for the five members that King Charles tried to arrest in the House of Commons."
