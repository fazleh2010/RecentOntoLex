With this position came great responsibility but it also meant he had to be absent from home often. Five years later he was recalled by the party and he was promoted to be the secretary for welfare. The position also carried with it a seat on the ZANU Central Committee. Oliver was shot and killed in January 1980 by two assailants armed with AK47 assault rifles while reversing from his house on his way to work. He died instantly from the wounds he sustained. The reasons put forward for his killing have a link to his strong condemnation for corruption."

In 1912, he became operational engineer of the company Holmenkolbanen, which owned and operated the Holmenkollen Line in Oslo, Norway. In 1934, Braarud was promoted to incorporated engineer of Holmenkolbanen. He was made responsible for the finishing of the Sognsvann and Røa Lines, which opened in 1934 and 1935, respectively. Following the death of Tobias Bernhoft in 1937, Braarud became the managing director of Holmenkolbanen. Even though the board of Holmenkolbanen was occupied by Nasjonal Samling and nazi military during World War II, Braarud remained managing director of the company during the war. Edvard Heiberg succeeded him as managing director on 1 July 1953. For his work at Holmenkolbanen, Braarud was decorated as a Knight, First Class of the Royal Norwegian Order of St. Olav in 1952.

  "text" : "Oran B. Hesterman is the president and chief executive officer of Fair Food Network, a non-profit organization based in Ann Arbor Michigan, is a national leader in sustainable agriculture and food systems and the author of Fair Food: Growing a Healthy, Sustainable Food System for All (Public Affairs), as well as more than 400 reports and articles on subjects such as cover crops, crop rotation, and the impact of philanthropic investments on food systems practice and policy. Since its release, Fair Food has garnered a significant amount of attention, with over 4,000 food and social justice activists attending book events nationwide in 2011. Beyond listing the health, environment, and economic dysfunctions of the current broken American food system, the book presents burgeoning success stories and illuminates a clear path toward a more sustainable and equitable food future. The New York Times calls it “an important, accessible book on a crucial subject.” Before starting Fair Food Network, Dr. Hesterman co-led the Integrated Farming Systems and Food and Society Programs for the W.K. Kellogg Foundation for 15 years, during which time the Foundation seeded the local food systems movement with over $200 million. At Kellogg, Dr. Hesterman envisioned and nurtured national and international food system projects and collaborations and organized seminars on sustainable agriculture and community-based food systems on behalf of the Foundation. Prior to his position at the Kellogg Foundation, he was a fellow at the National Center for Food and Agriculture Policy in Washington, DC and a professor of crop and soil science at Michigan State University in East Lansing from 1984-1995. Dr. Hesterman earned his bachelor's and master's degrees from the University of California, Davis, in plant science/vegetable crops and agronomy, respectively. He received his doctorate in agronomy and business administration from the University of Minnesota, St. Paul. He grew up in Berkeley, California and presently lives in Ann Arbor, Michigan with his wife, Lucinda Kurtz."

  "text" : "Prof. Dr. Otto Naegeli (born 9 July 1871 in Ermatingen; died 1938), was a Swiss hematologist. He was the brother of Oskar Naegeli. He is best known for refining the classification of leukemia by dividing them into myelogenous and lymphocytic classes. He also made the observation that many individuals are infected with tuberculosis and do not develop the disease, which he attributed to differences in individual immune systems. While initially controversial, this was later demonstrated by others. Every two years the Otto Naegeli Prize for the promotion of medical research is awarded to a scientist working in Switzerland who has made outstanding contributions to biomedical and/or clinical research and is likely to continue doing so. The prize isawarded by the Zurich based Bonizzi Theler Foundation and is named in honor of Otto Naegeli."

He published many previously unpublished works by authors including Paradis Moncrif, Benserade, Caylus, Besenval, the Marquis de Sade and Baudelaire. He founded the Société des Bibliophiles Contemporaines, of which he was president. His research produced a considerable literary output and frequent publications in newspapers such as L'Echo, Le Plume, Dépêche de Toulouse, Le Mercure de France, Le Gaulois and Le Figaro of Paris. One of the topics his research focused on was the discussion of fashion and femininity in the French fin-de-siècle. This took the form of monographs and works including Son Altesse la femme (French for Her Highness Woman), Féminies and La Française du siècle (The Frenchwoman of the Century). His own works include novels and fantasy books, such as Surprises du Coeur and Contes pour les bibliophiles (Tales for bibliophiles)."

After his death she assumed the regency of the kingdom on behalf of her two sons, Pyrrhus II and Ptolemy; and in order to strengthen herself against the Aetolian League she gave before 239 BC her daughter Phthia in marriage to Demetrius II, king of Macedonia. By this alliance she secured herself in the possession of the sovereignty, which she continued to administer till her sons were grown up to manhood, when she resigned it into the hands of Pyrrhus II. But the deaths of that prince and his brother Ptolemy followed in quick succession, and Olympias herself died of grief for her double loss. Such is Justin's statement: according to another account Olympias had poisoned a Leucadian damsel named Tigris, to whom her son Pyrrhus was attached, and was herself poisoned by him in revenge."

Billingsley served as General Counsel for the National Democratic Party of Alabama (NDPA) and was a delegate for the NDPA at the 1968 Democratic National Convention in 1968. Billingsley helped to incorporate more than 20 small towns in Alabama that had majority black populations. He was well known for his 15-year defense of Caliph Washington who was falsely accused of killing a white officer; it was this case that helped to end all-white juries in Alabama. Billingsley was arrested for helping to secure farmland for the Black Muslims in Alabama. Presidents John Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson were known to call on Billingsley regarding the turbulence in Alabama. Billingsley was a founding member of the Alabama Lawyers Association. He was known as the “black Patrick Henry of Alabama.”"

  "text" : "Otto Harvey Kelly (15 May 1880 – 30 July 1946) was an Australian sportsman who represented Western Australia as a first-class cricketer and played for South Melbourne in the Victorian Football League (VFL). Kelly also played with East Fremantle and South Fremantle in the West Australian Football Association (WAFA). The eldest of three brothers in the VFL, Kelly participated in 16 of a possible 17 games in the 1902 season. His brother, Harvey, was also with South Melbourne that year and his other brother Ernie would later play at Carlton. Along with Harvey, Kelly made his way to Western Australia in 1903 and signed with East Fremantle. All three brothers were members of the 1904 East Fremantle premiership side. He switched to rival club South Fremantle in 1905 and played for them in three WAFA seasons. As his football career was coming to an end, Kelly was at his peak as a cricketer and made two appearances for Western Australia, both against New South Wales, in the 1906/07 cricket season. He played as a right handed top order batsman but could only manage scores of 23, 0, 13 and 4. In 1907/08 he was picked for his third and final first-class match, against the touring Marylebone Cricket Club from England. He scored 22 in the first innings, dismissed by Wilfred Rhodes, and 13 not out in the second. A nephew, Ernest Bromley was the first Western Australian to play cricket for Australia."

  "text" : "Omar Mokhtar El-Hariri (c. 1944 – 2 November 2015) was a leading figure of the National Transitional Council of Libya who served as the Minister of Military Affairs in 2011, during the Libyan Civil War. He controlled the National Liberation Army and the Free Libyan Air Force from March to May 2011. Though he no longer serves on the council Executive Board after being replaced by Jalal al-Digheily, he still heads Military Affairs in the unicameral National Transitional Council legislature. El-Hariri was involved in the initial 1969 coup against the monarchy that began Muammar Gaddafi's 42-year rule of Libya. He organised a plot to overthrow Gaddafi in 1975. When the coup was uncovered, 300 men were arrested, four of whom died during interrogation. Of the remainder, 21 were sentenced to death, including El-Hariri. He was imprisoned for 15 years from 1975 to 1990 under a death sentence, with four and a half years in solitary confinement. Gaddafi commuted the sentence in 1990 and El-Hariri was subsequently placed under house arrest until the Libyan civil war broke out in 2011. After breaking free of his detention, El-Hariri eventually became the political head of the National Transitional Council's armed forces. In an interview with The Globe and Mail, El-Hariri said of Libya's future, \"They will elect a new president and he will serve for a limited time. He could be removed if he does not serve the people. And, of course, we will need a parliament, and a multiparty system.\" On 19 May 2011, The Economist reported Jalal al-Digheily had been appointed \"defense minister\". Al Jazeera and The Jamestown Foundation later confirmed that Digheily had replaced El-Hariri. Unlike El-Hariri, Digheily was reportedly given a seat on the Executive Board of the National Transitional Council, while the \"military affairs\" department that El-Hariri had headed was afforded a seat on the council itself. He died in a road accident on 2 November 2015 on the road between Al Bayda and Al Qubbah."

  "text" : "Otto Willi Gail (18 July 1896 – 29 March 1956) was a German science journalist and author. Gail was born in Gunzenhausen, Mittelfranken. He studied electrical engineering and physics at the Technical University Munich. He worked for newspapers and radio broadcasting and wrote non-fiction books about physics, astronomy and space travel. He also wrote science fiction novels to delight the youth for these themes. He had good relations to the German space pioneers Max Valier and Hermann Oberth. As a result of these relationships he acquired special knowledge that influenced his books and gave them much details. His novels were translated into American English and influenced early American utopian literature. He died in Munich. R. D. Mullen noted that Der Schuß ins All is \"justly famous for the realistic detail with which it depicts the construction of a rocket ship, its launching into space, and the experiences of its crew.\" Of (the English version of) Hans Hardts Mondfahrt, Richard Godwin writes \"this novel for young adults is an accurate mirror of many of the space travel concepts that have been discussed by pre-war European experts,\" and continues, \"Otto Willi Gail was one of the most popular science fiction authors in Germany during the early 20th century.\" Wonder Stories compared By Rocket to the Moon to the work of Jules Verne, saying \"The style is easy and rapid, and the story moves along with facility\"."

  "text" : "Osman Saqizli (Turkish: Sakızlı Osman Paşa, literally, Osman Pasha of Chios) (died 1672), (r.1649-72) was Dey and Pasha of Tripolis. He was born into a Greek Christian family on the island of Chios (known in Ottoman Turkish as Sakız, hence his epithet \"Sakızlı\") and had converted to Islam. His rule was effective, continuing the policy of his predecessor Mehmed Saqizli. He occupied Cyrenaica, and was tolerant in religious matters. Anyway, the damages caused by the Tripoli's Pirates to the European trade put him often in conflict with the European powers. Due to that, Tripoli was bombed in retaliation in 1654 by the British Navy under Robert Blake, in 1662 by the Dutch Navy under Michiel de Ruyter, and in 1669 ad 1672 by the French Navy. He died in 1672, and with his death started a period of instability for his country."

  "text" : "Olya Lilith (Lillith, Lolya Tsederboym, Laja Cederbaum) 1906-1980 was a Polish Jewish singer and actress. Born in Otvotsk. By 1925, her singing (in Warsaw) attracted the attention of Kvi Pro Kvo (Qui Pro Quo) actor Boronski; it was he who suggested changing her stage name (Federovska) to Ola Lilith. Her husband Władysław Godik convinced her to sing in Yiddish and to join him in founding the famous Warsaw Yiddish nightclub (kleynkunstbine) Azazel in 1925. She sang as a soloist and in duets with Hanush (Ganushem) and Makhevski. She then performed with the Qui Pro Quo troupe – and on her own – throughout Poland and, later, all of Europe, with Vladislav Godik (Willy Godnick) and later with Boris Thomashefsky and Ruth Rene in Czechoslovakia, Austria, France, Berlin, Holland and England. She was brought to America by Joseph Rumshinsky and Menashe Skulnick; she performed in New York City in 1931 and played the title role in Rumshinsky's Second Avenue production \"A Maiden from Warsaw,\" with leading man Willy Godick, and subsequently the musical comedy Pleasure. Mordechai Yardeini called her the \"Yiddish Edith Piaf.\" Lilith gave concerts in Yiddish, and then in English, in Vaudeville RKO. She returned to Europe in the years just prior to World War II. It has mistakenly been said that she died in a Nazi concentration camp. Instead, after her divorce she emigrated to the United States and became a U.S. citizen in 1935. She refused to join the Yiddish Theater union, calling their audition process \"The Inquisition\". She sang and performed on WEVD radio programs in New York. Her last acting role was in Ven di zun geyt oyf (Sunrise, When the Sun Rises) with Ludwig Satz and Edmund Zayenda in 1941. She subsequently joined the American army and remarried, to a non-Jewish contractor named Leland Benton; they settled in Miami Springs, Florida, where she died."

  "text" : "Ole Fogh Kirkeby (born 1947) is a Danish philosopher and a professor at Copenhagen Business School in the Philosophy of Leadership. He is a Doctor of Philosophy from Aarhus University, graduated with honours, 1994, with the dissertation \"Event and Body-mind. A phenomenological-hermeneutic Analysis\". He has an MA (mag.art.) in the History of Ideas from Aarhus University. As a professional philosopher, Kirkeby focused on the event as the centre of being. In order to describe the event, he conceived it as a way in which the body-mind (his neologism) absorbed the event by being absorbed by it. The media in which this takes place is language. Thus Kirkeby combined the theory of language games, and the phenomenological tradition, with its emphasis on self-reflective being (Heidegger), and the theory of bodily incorporation developed by Merleau-Ponty, interpreted through the Stoic vocabulary of the event, into an epistemological theory of the way in which we are “evented”. In his philosophical trilogy about the event, with the volumes ”Eventum Tantum – The Ethos of the Event (“Eventum Tantum - Begivenhedens ethos,” København: Samfundslitteratur, 2005); Beauty Happens. The Aesthetics of the Event (“Skønheden sker. Begivenhedens æstetik. København: Samfundslitteratur 2007): and The Self happens. The Event of Consciousness (”Selvet sker. Bevidsthedens begivenhed”. Samfundslitteratur) 2008, he created a new framework for approaching the event. Kirkeby developed a theory of the Good and Welfare, which will be published in the autumn 2011 by Gyldendal, Copenhagen. Kirkeby also worked intensively with business economics, creating a new agenda for leadership, exerting a great influence on managers in Denmark. He focused a radical-normative perspective on leadership, emphasizing leadership virtues, the duty of the leader to make values real, and the indispensable importance of the leader to know himself. He wrote several bestsellers inside this field, among others The Philosophy of Management. A Radical-Normative Perspective (”Ledelsesfilosofi. Et Radikalt Normativt Perspektiv”, København: Samfundslitteratur, 1997, tranl. To Swedish); The New Leadership (”Det Nye Lederskab”. København: Børsens Forlag, 2004); and The Leadership of the Event and the Force of Action (”Begivenhedsledelse og handlekraft”. Børsens Forlag. København 2006). In English, these topics of business economics are published in the books Management Philosophy. A Radical-Normative Perspective, Heidelberg and New York: Springer Verlag 2000; The Virtue of Leadership. Copenhagen: CBS Press 2007; and The New Protreptic. The Concept and the Art. Copenhagen: CBS Press 2009. In 2002, Kirkeby founded the Center for Art and Leadership at CBS, with particular emphasis on the way arts are able to inspire leadership. He still functions as its director. Kirkeby has been active as an author of fiction with the books Philosophical Stories (”Filosofiske Fortællinger”. København: Lindhardt & Ringhof, 2004); More Philosophical Short Stories (Flere filosofiske fortællinger: Lindhardt og Ringhof, København 2008). In 2010 he wrote the dramatic draft for Cantabile-II, Project Seek-to-Seek, participating himself as an actor.In 2008 he hosted the re-casting the draft to a new law of Danish Theatre together with a group of experts. In 2007 he developed experimental theatre together with Bent Noergaard, developing and participating in the play The Creative Human Being, Centre for Art and Science, SDU. From 1996 to 2000, Kirkeby co-developed and was the head of the studyboard at the MSc study programmes in Economics & Business Administration (cand.merc.) at the Copenhagen Business School, Denmark. From 2006-2008 he was Professor II at Trøndelag Research & Development, Norway, in Art, business and philosophy. In 2003 he co-founded a Danish think tank on Public Governance together with The SAS Institute, Denmark."

  "text" : "Roquette was born in Krotoschin, Prussian Province of Posen. The son of a district court councillor, he first went to Bromberg (modern Bydgoszcz) in 1834, and from 1846 to 1850 studied Philology and History in Heidelberg, Berlin, and Halle. After tours in Switzerland and Italy, he moved to in Berlin in 1852. He became a teacher in Dresden in 1853. He returned to Berlin in 1857 and in 1862 became a professor of literary history at the War Academy until he changed to the Vocational Academy (now the Berlin Institute of Technology) in 1867. In 1868 he joined the Vandalia-Teutonia Berlin. From 1869 he taught at the Polytechnic in Darmstadt (now TU Darmstadt). In 1893 he was named to the Geheimrat. Roquette befriended the German author Paul Heyse and, like Heyse, was a member of the literary group \"Rütli\". Roquette's pseudo-romantic and epigonic lyric poetry and his fairy tale-laden epic verse is representative of Butzenscheibenlyric. From 1850 on, his works were extremely popular and especially beloved in conservative circles. His fashionable post-revolution poetry was a deliberate departure from the politically tinged verse of the pre-March era. His celebrated verse-epic on themes of love, wine, and youth, Waldmeisters Brautfahrt, first appeared in 1851 and enjoyed sensational success for a book at that time – appearing in more than 50 editions over thirty years. Roquette's work was popular with some Lieder composers. His 1851 poem Noch ist die blühende, goldene Zeit was fit to a well-known folk tune in 1863 by musician Wilhelm Baumgartner. Roquette was also a novelist, playwright, literary historian and autobiographer. Roquette died in Darmstadt. Later generations found Roquette's work to be predominantly shallow and of little artistic value, and it is virtually forgotten today."

Her paternal grandparents were Orazio Ludovisi and his wife Lavinia Albergati. Her cousin was Olimpia Aldobrandini. Unlike her two sisters Lavinia and Ippolita, Olimpia did not marry, instead she dedicated her life to the church as nun. In 1699, Olimpia's older brother Giovan Battista Ludovisi died and left his estate to his newborn son Niccolo. However, the young child died 1700 and Olimpia succeeded being the closest surviving paternal relative. Olimpia inherited all fiefs including Piombino. She was only the second ever Princess of Piombino to rule in her own right after Isabella Appiani. Olimpia remained a nun after her accession. Olimpia only reigned for several months until she died on 27 November 1700. As she left no children, the succession passed to her only surviving sibling Ippolita."

  "text" : "Olga Gray (born 1906, date of death unknown) was a British secretary and typist recruited as an Mi5 infiltration agent by Maxwell Knight of B5(b) section in 1931. She was born in Manchester. Under the instructions of Knight, Gray moved to London and became a member of the Friends of the Soviet Union in 1932. Knight's reasoning behind Gray becoming a member of a soviet friendly organisation but not actually offering to spy on Great Britiain for the Soviet Union, was that the most successful counter-espionage agents were those who were approached by the enemy organisation. This plan met with success when in 1934 after a period working for the Anti War Movement she was approached by Harry Pollitt and asked to undertake a 'special mission' on behalf of the Communist Party of Great Britain (CPGB). Having accepted this request Gray was sent to Paris on June 6, 1934 where she was to rendezvous with Percy Glading (an officer of League Against Anti-Imperialism and a founding member of the CPGB). Following this meeting Gray was instructed by Glading to go to India to deliver money and messages to insurgent elements therein. However the cover-story provided to Gray by the CPGB was so flimsy for a woman travelling alone during the monsoon season to India that she would not fail to rouse the suspicion of the authorities. Knight's B5(b) section therefore stepped in and concocted a passable cover-story to enable her to continue to gain evidence of CPGB espionage. On her return from India Gray worked as Pollitt's personal secretary, till dropping all work with the communists in 1935 due to the strain of maintaining a double life."

  "text" : "Orville Prescott (Sept. 8, 1906, Cleveland, OH – April 28, 1996, New Canaan, CT) was the main book reviewer for the New York Times for 24 years. Born in Cleveland, Prescott graduated from Williams College in 1930. He began his career as a researcher for Newsweek, then known as News-Week, and became the literary editor of Cue Magazine before joining the Times, where he wrote three or four book reviews every week from 1942 through 1966. His reviews showed a preference for traditional novels with strong narratives and clear characterizations. In 1958 he reviewed Lolita by Vladimir Nabokov and described it as \"dull, dull, dull in a pretentious, florid and archly fatuous fashion.\" In 1961, Gore Vidal wrote a scathing portrait of Prescott as a reviewer. Vidal later wrote that Prescott was so offended by his depiction of a homosexual love affair in The City and the Pillar that he refused to review his work or allow the Times to review it. (Reviews of Gore's books continued to appear in the pages of the Times after 1948, when The City and the Pillar was reviewed.) More than any other reviewer, he influenced sales of books across the country, and was held in high esteem. Prescott edited three anthologies about history and after his retirement wrote two books about the Italian Renaissance."

  "text" : "Oliver McMullan (born 22 March 1952) is an Irish Sinn Féin politician, who was elected as an MLA to the Northern Ireland Assembly to represent the East Antrim constituency in May 2011. He was also elected to Larne Borough Council in the 2011 local elections. McMullan was active in business life in his native Cushendall, where he owned a local pub. He entered politics in 1993 when he was elected as an Independent to Moyle District Council, topping the poll. He also topped the poll in the same elections in 1997 and 2001, standing as either an Independent or Independent Nationalist. McMullan headed the Independent McMullan list in the 1996 elections to the Northern Ireland Forum. He received 670 votes (2%) in North Antrim, with the list receiving 927 votes (0.12%) across Northern Ireland, meaning that no candidates were elected. McMullan failed to be elected in the same constituency in the 1998 elections, where he polled 1.0%. He joined Sinn Féin before the 2003 Assembly elections and stood unsuccessfully for the party in East Antrim in those elections and the 2007 Assembly elections. He was re-elected to Moyle District Council in 2005, serving as the first Sinn Féin chairman of the council and a board member on the North Eastern Education and Library Board. He was also a member of Sinn Féin's All Ireland Advisory Committees for Agriculture, Tourism and Rural Development. After 18 years as a member of Moyle Council, McMullan contested and won a seat on Larne Borough Council in May 2011, standing in and topping the poll in the Coast Road electoral area. In doing so he became the first Sinn Féin councillor on the predominantly unionist council. In November 2011 he resigned from the council, enabling fellow Sinn Féin member James McKeown to take his place. Just over a week after gaining election he received a death threat from a group claiming to be called the 'Loyalist Action Force'. McMullan spoke about a family that had been the target of several racist attacks in Glenarm, saying, \"There has been a petrol bomb thrown at the house and there has been another occasion when acid was poured over their vehicle.\" In 2013 he revealed he was suffering from prostate cancer. Standing for re-election in the 2016 Assembly election, he retained his seat with 2633 votes."

  "text" : "Oswald Walter Wright (20 March 1877 – 19 December 1933) played first-class cricket for Cambridge University in 1899 and Somerset in 1902. He was born at Maxton, Dover, Kent and died at Cheltenham, Gloucestershire. Wright was educated at Malvern College and Selwyn College, Cambridge; at school he played for the first eleven at cricket and captained the soccer team. He played in two first-class cricket matches as a left-arm opening bowler while at Cambridge in 1899, taking one wicket in each of them; his better bowling figures, one for 16, and his highest first-class score of 14, made as a tail-end batsman, came in the first of these, the match against Surrey. He appeared in a single match for Somerset in 1902, batting at No 11 and failing to score in either innings; he bowled just two overs and did not take a wicket in this match. The Malvern Register compiled in 1904 records Wright's family as living in Wickwar, Gloucestershire and that he was employed, after graduation, as an assistant master at a preparatory school, Stone House School, Broadstairs, Kent."

In March 2010, he was arrested \"less than 24 hours after his new exhibition opened\" at the National Gallery in Bulawayo. His works referred to the massacres of Ndebele civilians during the Gukurahundi in the 1980s, carried out by forces loyal to Robert Mugabe. The exhibition, called \"Sibathontisele\" (\"Let's Drip On Them\"), consisted in \"three installations and twelve paintings\". Maseko was charged, under the Public Order and Security Act, with \"undermining the authority\" of President Robert Mugabe. He was also charged with \"causing offence to persons of a particular race or religion\". The charges carried a possible twenty-year prison sentence. He was granted bail. In September, his trial was postponed pending consideration by the Supreme Court as to \"whether criminalising creative arts infringes on the freedom of expression and freedom of conscience\", as guaranteed by the Constitution. A magistrate granted an application to the Supreme Court on constitutional grounds, and on the grounds that Maseko's art depicted events which had unquestionably happened. Maseko was second runner up for the Freedom to Create Prize in 2010, for his exhibition on the Gukurahundi killings."

  "text" : "Olaf Alfred Hoffstad (18 March 1865 – 15 September 1943) was a Norwegian botanist, writer, school principal and Conservative politician. Born in the mid-Norwegian city of Stjørdal to a mercantile family, he initially embarked on an educational career. Having taught at girls' schools across the country in the early 1890s, he was permanently employed at two universal schools in Sandefjord, a city whose political life he influenced in the latter part of his life. During his schooldays Hoffstad read voraciously, developing a passion for botany that never left him. His first botanical book was published in 1891; it sold well, being released in nine revised editions before Hoffstad's decease during the Second World War. He also wrote floras intended for use in schools, the most prominent of which was published in six editions. In the 1890s Hoffstad travelled widely, searching for new plant species hitherto undiscovered. In the conservative middle-class city of Sandefjord, Hoffstad engaged himself politically: in 1894 he was elected chairman of a local conservative youth league. Two years later, he entered the Sandefjord city council, which catapulted him into the political limelight: for 23 years he was the city's mayor, and later served as deputy representative for the Conservative Party in the Norwegian Parliament. A patriotic citizen of Sandefjord, Hoffstad was member of numerous boards of directors in the city."
