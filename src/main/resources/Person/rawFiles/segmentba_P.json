  "text" : "Patrick R. Donahoe was the 73rd United States Postmaster General, having been appointed to the post on October 25, 2010. A 35-year veteran of the Postal Service, he reported to the Postal Service Board of Governors. Before being Postmaster, Donahoe served as the 19th deputy postmaster general. He entered the Postal Service as a clerk in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Donahoe is a 1977 graduate of the University of Pittsburgh where he majored in economics. He also graduated from the MIT Sloan School of Management, where he was a Sloan Fellow. His predecessor, Postmaster General John E. Potter testified before the Senate that if the Postal Service is not able to readjust their payment toward the pre-funding of retiree health benefits, as mandated by the Postal Accountability & Enhancement Act of 2006, the USPS would be forced to consider cutting delivery to five days per week during the summer months of June, July & August. Donahoe echoed his predecessor's views on five-day delivery when he assumed office in 2011. On February 6, 2013, Donahoe announced that the Postal Service would implement five-day mail delivery beginning August 5, a move he claimed would save $2 billion annually. Later the same day, the national board of the National Rural Letter Carriers' Association voted unanimously to call for his dismissal. July 16, the House passed the Financial Services and General Government Appropriations bill, which included language protecting six‐day mail delivery, thereby blocking Donahoe's plan. Donahoe retired on November 14, 2014, and Megan Brennan, the first female Postmaster General, was appointed as his successor the following February."

  "text" : "Dom Pedro de Menezes Portocarrero, (1370 – Ceuta, September 22, 1437) was a 15th-century Portuguese nobleman and military figure. Pedro de Menezes (sometimes modernized as 'de Meneses') was the 2nd Count of Viana do Alentejo, 1st. Count of Vila Real and the first Portuguese governor of Ceuta. Pedro de Menezes was the son of the powerful 14th-century nobleman João Afonso Telo de Menezes, 1st Count of Ourém, 1st Count of Viana do Alentejo, and Mayor Portocarrero y Silva, lady of Vila Real. Pedro was the cousin of Leonor Telles de Menezes, the scandalous but powerful consort of King Ferdinand I of Portugal. During the 1383–1385 Crisis, Pedro's father had supported Beatrice of Portugal against the pretender John, Master of Aviz (the future John I). Nonetheless, unlike many other nobles, Pedro de Menezes had been allowed to inherit his father's title of Count of Viana do Alentejo and proved himself a faithful loyalist of the usurper king John I He also inherited the Castilian lordships of Ayllón and Aguilar from relatives, but these titles were not recognized in Portugal. Pedro de Menezes participated and distinguished himself in the 1415 Conquest of Ceuta, and, in the aftermath, was appointed by King John I of Portugal as the first Portuguese governor of Ceuta. Allegedly, he was the only Portuguese noble willing to remain in charge of the Portuguese garrison, which was sure to be attacked by the full force of Marinid Morocco in due time. Pedro de Menezes was left with a garrison of 1600 soldiers. In 1416, Prince Henry the Navigator was placed in charge of supplying provisions to the Ceuta garrison from Portugal. (Legendarily, while John I was canvassing for governors, the young Pedro was nearby, distractedly playing choca (a kind of Medieval hockey) with a stick of zambujeiro (wild olive tree). Hearing all the high nobles making excuses to avoid the job, the young Pedro de Menezes stepped forward and approached the king with his gaming stick (aleo) in hand and told him that, with only that stick, he could defend Ceuta from all the power of Morocco. As a result of this story, all future Portuguese governors of Ceuta would be presented with a zambujeiro staff as a symbol of their office upon their investiture.) In 1418 (or 1419), the armies of the Marinid rulers of Morocco, assisted by auxiliary forces from the Nasrid Emirate of Granada, finally gathered and laid siege to the citadel. Pedro de Menezes managed the defenses of the citadel, while princes Henry the Navigator and John of Reguengos were dispatched with a relief fleet from Portugal. According to the chroniclers, the relief fleet turned out to be quite unnecessary. In a bold gambit, D. Pedro de Menezes led the Portuguese garrison in a sally against the Marinid siege camp and forced the lifting of the siege before the relief fleet even arrived. Blamed for losing Ceuta, the Marinid sultan was assassinated in a coup in Fez in 1420, leaving only a child as his heir. Morocco descended into anarchic chaos, as rival pretenders vied for the throne and local governors carved out regional fiefs for themselves, selling their support to the highest bidder. The political crisis in Morocco released the pressure on Ceuta for the next few years, leaving Pedro de Menezes and the Portuguese garrison with little to do, but entrench themselves in the largely empty fortress-citadel. They were only occasionally pestered by small parties of Moroccan nobles, who came to challenge Portuguese knights to feats of arms and personal combat, or scrappy columns of Sufi-inspired religious radicals looking for Holy War. Although the Portuguese crown was losing substantial amounts of money maintaining the expensive garrison, Pedro de Menezes is said to have accumulated a small personal fortune from ransoming Moroccan knights captured in skirmishes and from kickbacks from the corsairs he allowed to operate out of Ceuta. He is said to have lent substantial sums to the perennially-indebted Henry the Navigator. In 1423, Pedro de Menezes briefly returned to Portugal to settle some domestic affairs. In 1424, Pedro de Menezes was invested with his mother's dominions as the first Count of Vila Real by King John I of Portugal and appointed the alferes-mor (standard-bearer) of the royal prince and heir Infante Edward. That same year, he secured from the king a royal letter legitimizing his natural son, Duarte de Menezes. Around 1430 Pedro de Menezes once again returned to Portugal, leaving Ceuta under the command of the 16-year-old son Duarte de Menezes and his lieutenant (and son-in-law) Ruy Gomes da Silva. During this second sojourn, Pedro de Menezes received the title of Admiral of Portugal in 1433, as dowry for his marriage to Genebra Pereira (daughter of the admiral Carlos II Pessanha). Pedro de Menezes returned to Ceuta soon after (c. 1434), but his bride did not survive the journey. In 1436-37, preparations were underway in Portugal for a renewed campaign against Morocco, seeking to capture Tangier and several other coastal citadels. In anticipation, in 1436, Pedro de Menezes ordered the Ceuta garrison, led by young Duarte, to attack and raze the citadel of Tétouan, to prevent it from becoming a threat to the Portuguese operations. The Portuguese expeditionary force, led by Henry the Navigator, arrived in Ceuta in August 1437, and were greeted with great pomp by D. Pedro de Menezes, who offered to join the force and personally lead the Ceuta garrison in the campaign. As the ageing governor was already evidently ill, Henry turned down the offer and took his son Duarte de Menezes instead. Pedro de Menezes condition took a turn for the worse shortly after and he died within the first week of the siege of Tangier. His son Duarte managed to rush back in time to receive his father's blessing on his deathbed. Despite having married four times, Pedro de Menezes did not have any direct male heirs. His legitimized bastard son Duarte de Menezes inherited his father's old dominion of Count of Viana do Alentejo, but the crown-granted title of Count of Vila Real went to his eldest daughter Brites de Menezes and her consort, Fernando de Noronha. The title of Admiral of Portugal was inherited by his nephew, Lançarote da Cunha. An account of the life and career of Pedro de Menezes was written down in 1463 by Portuguese chronicler Gomes Eanes de Zurara, Chronica do Conde D. Pedro de Menezes, which helped cement his reputation. Among the many legendary stories that have circulated is that Pedro de Menezes wore a coat of mail continuously for sixteen years, wearing it out before ever taking it off. Pedro de Menezes is sometimes denoted as Peter I, to distinguish him from his namesake grandson Peter II, the first Marquis of Vila Real, who was to serve as a later governor of Ceuta. Pedro de Menezes was originally buried in the cathedral of Ceuta (a converted mosque), but his remains were later translated by his daughter to the Augustinian monastery church of Igreja da Graça in Santarém. His remains are still found there, in an effighy tomb alongside his third wife, Brites Coutinho. The Menezes tomb is decorated with carved wild olive tree branches, and repeatedly embossed with the word aleo, a reference to the gaming stick which Pedro de Menezes made famous. The same motif and slogan, \"aleu\", is found in the coat of arms of the town of Vila Real, the seat of Pedro de Menezes's fief. 16th-century poet Luís de Camões is believed to be referring to D. Pedro de Menezes's aleo episode in his first Ecloga, where the poet writes: \"So long as from sturdy, wild olive trees, the shepherds of Luso can find gaming sticks (cajados) and the ancient valor that first made them so famous in the world, do not fear, Frondelio, my companion, that they shall be subdued at any time.\""

  "text" : "Pierre Tabart (Chinon, baptized 8 January 1645 – Meaux, 1716) was a French composer and maître de chapelle. Said to have studied music under 'the best contrapuntist of his time', he served as maître de musique in Orléans until 1683, followed by Senlis from 1683-1689. He then succeeded Nicolas Goupillet as maître de musique of Meaux Cathedral. However, due to the fact that his nine-year contract was left unrenewed, he was succeeded by Sébastien de Brossard in 1699. He later aided his successor to the post in selecting the maître de musique for Évreux Cathedral."

With L. Kaufman he coined the word medoid when proposing the k-medoids method  for cluster analysis, also known as Partitioning Around Medoids (PAM). His silhouette display  shows the result of a cluster analysis, and the resulting index is often used to select the number of clusters. The Rousseeuw-Croux scale estimator is an efficient alternative to the median absolute deviation, see robust measures of scale.With I. Ruts and John Tukey he introduced the bagplot, a bivariate generalization of the boxplot. His more recent work has focused on concepts and algorithms for statistical depth functions in the settings of multivariate, regression  and functional data, and on robust principal component analysis. His 1984 paper  has been reprinted in Breakthroughs in Statistics  collected and annotated the 60 most influential papers in statistics from 1850 to 1990."

His mission to Scotland was concerned with the King's marriage and the international crisis caused by the pretender Perkin Warbeck. In his later career he supported Catherine of Aragon in England but was involved in a decade of rivalry with the resident Spanish ambassador in London. Ayala was a Papal prothonotary, Archdeacon of London, and Bishop of the Canary Islands. Sources in English reveal little of Ayala's background, however he was from the noble family of the Counts of Fuensalida in Toledo. He was the son of Pedro Lopez de Ayala, Commendator of Mora and Treze, and Doña Leonor de Ayala. His contemporary, the historian Polydore Virgil, who may have known him in England, remarks that he was clever, but no scholar."

Her parents, Reverend Asa Thurston (1787–1868) and Lucy Goodale Thurston (1795–1876), were in the first company of American Christian missionaries to the Hawaiian Islands. When she was four, she had been asked to be given in hānai to Princess Kapulikoliko, daughter of Kamehameha I. Her mother politely refused. The concept of giving a child to be raised by a relative or friend was common in Hawaii, but it horrified the missionaries who preached one doesn't give out their children like puppies. For three years, she lived in Lahaina, Maui, where she assisted in the work of the seminary press at Lahainaluna School. In 1847, she married Rev. Townsend Elijah Taylor of LaGrange, New York, who was serving as the seaman's chaplain for the Port of Lahaina. Taylor is best known for her landscapes (two of which were made into engravings at the Lahinaluna seminary) and silhouettes of both missionaries and Hawaiian royalty."

In January 2010, Collins authored a book entitled Challenging the Culture of Corruption: Game Changing Reform for Illinois.(ISBN 978-0879464240). In 2010, Collins was selected by the Chicago Law Bulletin as one of Chicago's \"Top Ten\" attorneys of the decade.

After ending his player career, he opened a restaurant in his hometown of Biarritz. English prop Jason Leonard said that \"Pascal Ondarts was the best, the toughest and hardest prop against I ever played\"."

His pioneering research on molluscs was mainly concentrated in the western part of the Mediterranean Sea and in the Middle East. He was a prolific writer on malacofauna. But his interests also extended to other fields of zoology, geology and in particular the prehistory of Northern Africa. He became known as the \"Dean of North African Prehistory.\" In 1892 he discovered, together with François Doumergue, several paleolithic and neolithic caves at Cuartel and Kouchet El Djir. He named more than 100 mollusc species and even a few genera (Adansonia Pallary, 1902; Corbula (Physoida) Pallary, 1900; Orania Pallary, 1900) Ten species have been named in his honour, some of which have become synonyms: \n*  Arbacina allaryi Gauthier, 1897 : synonym of Genocidaris maculata A.

  "text" : "Paul Methuen (fl. 1566), was a Scottish reformer. Methuen was originally a baker in Dundee, was an early convert to the new doctrines. Although imperfectly educated, his eloquence and intimate acquaintance with scripture enabled him to render such good service to the Protestant cause that he became obnoxious both to the prelates and the secret council; and the latter not only issued an order for his apprehension, but also forbade the people to listen to his orations or to harbour him in their houses. Methuen avoided arrest through the intrepidity of Provost Haliburton, and to show their disappointment at his escape, the secret council fined the town of Dundee in the sum of 2,000l. During the war between Scotland and England, which began in the autumn of 1556, and continued through the following year, the Protestants enjoyed considerable liberty, and their numbers rapidly increased. Methuen, William Harlaw, John Douglas, and John Willock now began to preach with greater publicity in different parts of Scotland. On 10 May 1559 Methuen and other prominent reformers were placed on their trial before the justiciary court at Stirling for usurping the ministerial office, for administering without the consent of their ordinaries the sacrament of the altar in a manner different from that of the Catholic Church, in the burghs of Dundee and Montrose, and for convening the subjects of the realm in those places, preaching to them erroneous doctrines, and exciting seditions and tumults. Being found guilty, he was 'denounced rebel and put to the horn as fugitive'. He was nominated by the lords of the congregation to the church of Jedburgh, Roxburghshire, 19 July 1560, in which year and the following he was a member of assembly. He was deposed from his incumbency, with some difficulty, towards the end of 1562, for adultery with his servant, and sentence of excommunication was also pronounced against him. Thereupon he fled to England and resumed his ministerial office there. In 1563 it was declared in the assembly that he was 'verie sorrowful for his grievous offence, and wald underly whatever punishment the kirk would lay upon him,' which declaration, on 27 Dec. 1564, 'the haill Assemblie with ane voyce are content to receive.' After an absence of up wards of two years the assembly, on 26 June 1566, ordained his public repentance. He was ordered to appear at the church door of Edinburgh when the second bell rang for public worship, clothed in sackcloth, bare-headed and bare-footed; to stand there until the prayer and psalms were finished; when he was to be brought into the church to hear the sermon, during which he was to be 'placeit in the publick spectakill [stool of repentance] above the peiple.' He was to repeat this procedure at Dundee and Jedburgh, where he had officiated as minister. Methuen went through a part of this discipline, but being overwhelmed with shame, or despairing to regain his lost reputation, he stopped in the midst of it, and again returned to England."

Hickey worked in the Unification Church as a state leader and regional spokesperson. In 1978 he was matched with his wife, Shin Myung-hee of South Korea, by church founder Sun Myung Moon. They were married in 1982 in a Blessing ceremony of the Unification Church, held in Madison Square Garden in New York City, along with over 2000 other couples. They now have four grown children. Hickey moved to Nevada in the 1990s and worked as a reporter as well as founding a house painting company. In 1996 he was elected to the Nevada State Assembly and served for one term. In 2010 he ran again and was elected. He is a member of the Republican Party and has advocated conservative positions on taxation and immigration. He is now a member of the Roman Catholic Church, in which he was originally raised."

She earned a BA from Smith College in 1906 at age 21 and was elected to Phi Beta Kappa. After teaching at a private school, she returned in 1907 to do graduate work in mathematics and music and earned an MA in the latter in 1908. She continued on at Smith to teach until 1911. Sperry began studying at the University of Chicago in 1913 and earned an MS in mathematics in 1914. Under the guidance of Ernest Julius Wilczynski, her doctoral thesis, \"Properties of a certain projectively defined two-parameter family of curves on a general surface\", drew on his work as the founder of the American school of projective differential geometry. She earned her PhD in mathematics and astronomy in 1916 and was elected to the Sigma Xi honor society. After a year teaching again at Smith, Sperry spent the rest of her academic career at the University of California at Berkeley, beginning in 1917. In 1923, she became the first female assistant professor in the mathematics department at the university. Her students at Berkeley included Raymundo Favila. At the height of McCarthyism, the Board of Regents required university employees to sign a loyalty oath. Sperry, Hans Lewy, and others who refused were barred from teaching without pay in 1950. In the case Tolman v. Underhill, the California Supreme Court ruled in 1952 the loyalty oath unconstitutional and reinstated those who refused to sign. Sperry was reinstated with back pay and the title emeritus associate professor. Sperry was an active Quaker and involved in various humanitarian and political causes."

His victory in the elections for mayor was partly due to the backing of then-president of Brazil, Getúlio Vargas. During his term in office, he made several social and populist reforms in the fields of health care, education, and indigenous culture (to his credit stands the revival of the Samba). He quickly became the most popular politician in Brazil, and was even considered as a suitable candidate for the future presidential elections of 1938. In 1936, however, Ernesto was charged with participation in a communist conspiracy against the government, and was arrested. He spent the next few years defending himself against charges of treason, and was eventually absolved. By then, however, Vargas had already launched his autocratic \"New State\" (Estado Novo), erasing the possibility of democratic elections."

Subsequently he was named Political Director, and later Executive Director of the Georgia Republican Party, serving under chairman Alec Poitevint. During this 2003-06 period at the Georgia GOP, Republicans seized control of the State House of Representatives (a net gain of 34 seats) and the State Senate (net gain of 8 seats). The party also elected a Lieutenant Governor and Secretary of State, as well as re-electing Perdue in 2006, the first Republican in 134 years to serve as Governor. Throughout these years, Bennecke had worked with Nick Ayers, Perdue's 2006 campaign manager. Perdue was elected to a one-year stint as RGA Chairman, and he named Ayers as Executive Director and Bennecke as Political Director. The two young Georgians conceived an unprecedented four-year plan to professionalize the committee's operation and implement a long-range strategy, leading up to the 2010 midterm elections, when 37 Governors would be elected. Their plan was accepted by the Governors, and Ayers and Bennecke served through four gubernatorial cycles encompassing all 50 states. When the two began at RGA, Republicans were reeling from a terrible 2006 cycle, and held only 22 statehouses. When they left in early 2011, the GOP held 29 Governorships, a net gain of seven (including Ohio, Michigan, New Jersey, Wisconsin and Virginia). Bennecke oversaw a budget totalling $35 million in 2007-09, which rose to more than $100 million for 2010 alone. In the intervening years (2011–14), Bennecke founded his own political consulting firm (Red Clay Strategies), and then joined the Atlanta-based public-affairs firm, ConnectSouth, together with longtime associate Clint Austin. In November 2013, ConnectSouth affiliated itself with the Mississippi-based Capitol Resources LLC, whose partners include Henry Barbour. He also formed Jenson Strategic Partners LLC in 2013. Bennecke spent much of 2011 in Virginia, where he directed a PAC affiliated with Governor Bob McDonnell in its mission to regain control of the Virginia State Senate. The GOP scored a net gain of two seats that November, achieving a 20-20 tie (allowing Lieutenant Governor Bill Bolling to cast tiebreaking votes in favor of the GOP for the next two years). Continuing his work in the Old Dominion, Bennecke in March 2012 announced the formation of a federal SuperPAC, Independence Virginia PAC, whose sole purpose was to aid the bid of George F. Allen to the U.S. Senate. Allen ultimately lost his bid to Democrat Tim Kaine; Independence Virginia PAC spent $4.9 million to aid the Republican. Bennecke also worked for the independent America 360 Committee in Massachusetts to aid Sen. Scott Brown in his re-election effort; he was defeated by Democrat Elizabeth Warren. Bennecke's close cooperation in both races with Las Vegas billionaire GOP activist Sheldon Adelson was noted. Republican setbacks in the 2013 Virginia statewide elections gave Democrats control of the State Senate through the ascension of Ralph Northam to the Lieutenant Governorship. Bennecke directed the campaign of B. Wayne Coleman to succeed Northam in the Democratic-leaning, Norfolk-based 6th District, falling short by 11 votes after a lengthy recount in January 2014. Persisting after the Coleman defeat months before, he directed the successful August 2014 special-election campaign of Ben Chafin to the Virginia State Senate, which returned complete control of the General Assembly to the Republicans. Also in 2013 and for all of 2014, he served as general consultant to the David Perdue campaign for U.S. Senate in Georgia, guiding it to success through three hotly contested primary, runoff and general elections. His 2014 independent-expenditure efforts aided winning candidates in Illinois and Tennessee; further, Bennecke was hired to direct the RGA's IE campaigns in support of GOP gubernatorial nominees in Massachusetts, Kansas and Georgia (all of whom were elected that November). Bennecke lives in Atlanta with his wife, the former Jennifer (Jen) Englert, and their son, Barron. Under Gov. Sonny Perdue, she served as top assistant to Georgia First Lady Mary Perdue, as Executive Director of the Georgia Children’s Trust Fund, and finally as Executive Director of the Governor’s Office for Children and Families (GOCF). She was reappointed to the GOCF post by Governor Nathan Deal in 2011, but resigned that fall."

  "text" : "The American artist Paulette Van Roekens was born in Château-Thierry, France late New Year's Eve 1895. At a young age, she emigrated to the United States with her parents, Victor (a horticulturalist) and Jeanne van Roekens, to reside in Glenside, Pennsylvania. In 1915, Van Roekens enrolled in the Philadelphia School of Design for Women (now Moore College of Art and Design), where she was awarded the John Sartain Fellowship (1916). She also attended classes at the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts, and studied sculpture at the Graphic Sketch Club of Philadelphia. She also studied under Henry B. Snell, Leopold Seyffert, Joseph Pearson, and Charles Grafly. She became a professor at the Moore College of Art in drawing and painting in 1923, a position she held for almost 40 years. At the time of her retirement in 1961, the College presented her with an honorary doctorate. In 1927 she married a colleague at Moore, Arthur Melzer, a respected artist in his own right. They had two children, Davis Paul and Joanne. She and Melzer lived in the Philadelphia area for the rest of their lives. They each had a studio in the family home, but painted subjects from New York as well as outdoor scenes from excursions to Europe. She worked in a variety of media and is well known for her oils and pastels. Still lifes are prominent in her early work, but as her career developed she turned more and more to landscapes. She called herself a “sometimes impressionist” because while she was strongly influenced by impressionism she found it difficult to completely break with academic drawing. She exhibited throughout her career, with 14 solo exhibitions (her first in 1920) and two retrospective exhibitions with her husband. Her final exhibition was only a few months before her death on January 11, 1988. Her work is represented at the Corcoran Gallery of Art, the National Academy of Design, the Carnegie Institute, the Art Institute of Chicago, the Mint Museum (Charlotte, N.C.), the Albright Gallery, and the Detroit Institute of Art. She held memberships in the Art Alliance of America and the National Association of Women Painters and Sculptors."

  "text" : "Petr Kotik (surname originally Kotík) (born January 27, 1942, in Prague) is a composer, conductor and flutist living in New York City. He was educated in Europe (Prague Conservatory, graduated 1961; Vienna Music Academy, graduated 1966; AMU Prague, graduated 1969). From 1960 to 1963, Kotik studied composition privately with Jan Rychlík in Prague, and from 1963 to 1966 at the Music Academy in Vienna with Karl Schieske, Hans Jelinek, and Friedrich Cerha. In Prague, he founded and directed Musica Viva Pragensis (1961–64) and the QUAX Ensemble (1966–69). He came to the United States in 1969 at the invitation of Lukas Foss and Lejaren Hiller to join the Center for Creative and Performing Arts at the University at Buffalo. Since 1983, Kotik has been living in New York City. Kotik is the founder and Artistic Director of the S.E.M. Ensemble, based in New York City, which presents both chamber and orchestra concerts. Kotik has received numerous commissions and composition grants, from the National Endowment for the Arts. Kotik received a 1996 Foundation for Contemporary Arts Grants to Artists Award. He is also known for his realization of the complete musical works of Marcel Duchamp. With the S.E.M. Ensemble (which he founded in 1970), Kotik has for many years actively promoted the work of other (mostly American) composers sharing a stylistic affinity with his own work, giving frequent performances as conductor and performer with the group as well as its larger version, the Orchestra of the S.E.M. Ensemble. Kotik's music is composed in the minimal vein, with works often being of long duration and featuring slow tempi and quiet dynamics. Though his works feature innumerable gradual, slight changes, giving them a seemingly static quality, his harmonies, however, are more complex than those employed by many other American minimal composers, and his musical process is not as apparent to the listener as, for example, in the works of Steve Reich or Philip Glass. Further, Kotik does not draw as heavily on jazz or rock in his works as do many of his American colleagues (though, like Steve Reich, he is quite interested in Medieval music and often integrates Medieval compositional techniques into his works). These qualities set Kotik's music apart from American minimal trends, giving his music a decidedly European character more similar in outlook to, for example, that of Hungarian minimalists such as Zoltán Jeney, László Sáry, or László Vidovszky. Among Kotik's best known works is the six-hour opera Many Many Women (1976–78), based on a text by Gertrude Stein, for whose work, appropriately, Kotik has a special affinity. As a performer, Kotik has been an active chamber musician throughout much of his life. Until 1992, Kotik did not have the slightest interest in orchestra. That changed in 1992, when he conducted Atlas Eclipticalis by John Cage with the 86-piece Orchestra of the S.E.M. Ensemble in Tribute to John Cage at Carnegie Hall, with David Tudor as the soloist. Since then, Kotik has been organizing large-scale events, expanding the S.E.M. Ensemble into The Orchestra of the S.E.M. Ensemble, and encouraging and commissioning other composers to write for orchestra. In 1999, after conducting Gruppen by Karlheinz Stockhausen, Kotik initiated a project of compositions for 3 orchestras and commissioned the creation of new 3-orchestra works by Alvin Lucier, Christian Wolff, Martin Smolka, Phill Niblock and Olga Neuwirth. In 2001, Kotik founded the biennial Ostrava Days, an Institute and Festival of New Music in Ostrava, Czech Republic. This three-week program, one of the largest in existence, focuses on works for orchestra, with 2 resident orchestras and number of resident composers, chamber music groups and soloists. Although Kotik entered the conservatory at the age of 14, he only began composing in his late teens. This was due to his lack of interest in classical harmony, a tendency shared with other composers such as Christian Wolff and John Cage. As a composer, Kotik is essentially self-taught, in spite of his education in Western composition fundamentals in Prague and Vienna. His technique has very little to do with commonly used compositional methods. Kotik's compositional system can be compared to a game in which the use of controlled chance is balanced by conscious decision-making. The two alternate, one influencing the other. In this way Kotik triggers unpredictable processes while the work progresses in the envisioned direction. In recent years, Kotik has relied increasingly on intuitive gestures. The strategies and limitations Kotik imposes on chance, along with intuitive decisions, are at the root of his compositional process. Among Kotik's best-known compositions are Music for 3 (1964) for piano and 2 strings; Spontano (1964) for piano and ensemble (composed for Frederic Rzewski); Kontrabandt (1967), a live electronic work commissioned by the WDR Electronic Music Studio; Many Many Women (1975–78) on a text by Gertrude Stein; and Letters to Olga (1988–91) on a text by Václav Havel. His orchestra pieces include: Quiescent Form (1994–96); the one-hour-long Music in Two Movements (1998–2002); Variations for 3 Orchestras (2002–2005); and Spheres and Attraction (2005–2006) for 2 voices, string quartet and percussion on a text by R. Buckminster Fuller. \"Kotik’s massive and too modestly named Fragment (1st movement of Music in Two Movements), which he conducted with his SEM Orchestra gives me sufficient pretext to voice the overdue sentiment that he is one of the best composers working today...among those writing abstract works for ensembles of unconventional instruments, Kotik stands very near the top and possibly at the top. He produced some of the most durable, though still little-known musical monuments of the post-Cage 70s, and his output has been amazingly consistent in quality.” (New York music critic and composer Kyle Gann, The Village Voice 1998). Kotik's music is available on the Labor, Dog w/a Bone and Ear-Rational labels. His father was the painter Jan Kotík. He is married to the curator and art historian Charlotta Kotik, great-granddaughter of Tomáš Garrigue Masaryk, and has a son, Tomas (Tom), who is a New York-based sculptor. His other son, Jan Jakub Kotik, was born in 1972 and died of cancer in 2007. Also he has another son Benjamin Alvin Kotik, who was born in 2001. His middle name Alvin was given from Alvin Lucier, another great composer."

Over the next nine years, Menichelli made a series of films, often trading on her image as a diva and on her passionate, decadent eroticism. Menichelli became a global star, and one of the most appreciated actresses in Italian cinema, before her retirement in 1924, aged 34. Since her death, restorations of Menichelli's surviving films have been shown at important film festivals, and her filmography has been re-assembled and re-evaluated by film historians."

He was one of the closest associates of Meyer Lansky, and assisted Meyer and his brother Jake Lansky in operating the Mob's Hallandale Florida casinos, including the plush \"rug joint\" the Colonial Inn. He was arrested at a restaurant in Little Italy and charged with \"consorting with known criminals for unlawful purposes\" in 1965. Kovolick fled New York to avoid an indictment to appear before a Manhattan grand jury investigating illegal gambling, bribery and corruption. Authorities were attempting to extradite him back to New York before his disappearance, as assistant district attorney Samuel S. Yasgur filed an affidavit in Miami in February 1971. The body of Philip Kovolick was found sealed in a steel drum at the bottom of a rock pit in Hallandale, Florida, after disappearing on April 7, 1971. Police would later charge 36-year-old John Alvin Baxter with first degree murder regarding the case. Baxter was sentenced to death. Eventually the sentence was commuted to life imprisonment."

Baras set the world land speed record on November 13, 1904. Driving a Darracq 100 hp, he completed the flying kilometer in twenty-one and two-fifths of a second to give an average speed of 104.34 mph (167.92 km/h). In 1906, he participated in the inaugural French Grand Prix, and led the early stages of the race. He eventually finished seventh, although he also had the fastest lap of the race. The following year, he finished third in the French Grand Prix. In 1908 he retired after three laps of the race. \n* Baras at the 1908 French Grand Prix \n* Baras in 1900. \n* Gaillon 1901. \n* Paris-Vienne 1902."

Peter founded his company, Shazam Magic, in 1994, and is sometimes assisted by his younger brother, Matt Wood. In 2003, his work with Immersion Active (an interactive design and marketing company in Frederick, Maryland) gained the attention of local media, and won him a Silver Addy Award from the Greater Frederick American Advertising Federation. Peter and his brother were profiled in a 2009 Frederick News-Post article, where Peter discusses his interest in magic as well as special effects. \"'When I would play as a kid, it would usually involve setting up special effects in the backyard with a sprinkler and strobe light, or putting on a show in the basement with sound effects and lighting.'\" Peter's childhood interest in special effects has led to his involvement behind the scenes of several films. In 2010, Peter worked with the education department of the International Spy Museum to create an exclusive spy-themed magic show, \"The Magic of Spying: Tradecraft Trickery.\" It premiered in April, 2011, and continues several times annually. Peter Wood partnered with Technica.ly in 2014 for Baltimore Innovation Week. Peter resides in Towson, Maryland with his wife Christie."

He also served as one of the Settlement Commissioners (Forlikskommissær) from the time the Conciliation Board (Forliksråd ) was introduced in rural areas in 1797 until 1813. Peder Hjermann represented Nordre Bergenhus amt (now Sogn og Fjordane) at the Norwegian Constituent Assembly at Eidsvoll in 1814 together with Lars Johannes Irgens and Niels Nielsen.

He is best known as the author of the novels Julie's Diary, Marie, and God's Peace, which together constitute Love's Trilogy. Marie in particular became in short order very highly esteemed, and Pierre Bonnard's illustrations (which appeared in 1897 in La Revue Blanche) for the novel were much admired by Renoir. An English translation of Love's Trilogy by Julia Le Gallienne (the second wife of Richard Le Gallienne) appeared in 1908. He was born in Copenhagen and worked for two decades for the publishing house Gyldendal. It was in his capacity as an editor at Gyldendal that he famously told Sigrid Undset not to attempt to write any more historical novels because she had \"no talent for it\". His second wife was the actress Betty Nansen. He died in 1918 in Mariager, a small town in central Denmark. He is generally regarded as having been very much influenced by the critic Georg Brandes."

  "text" : "Paul Barthelemy Telukluk is a ni-Vanuatu politician. In 2000, he was the co-founder, along with Father Gérard Leymang and Vincent Boulekone, of the Green Confederation, to \"promote sustainable development balancing custom, the environment, social welfare, free enterprise and regional autonomy foreach of the six provinces\". In the 2002 general election, he was elected to Parliament as Green MP for Malekula. Within the Green Federation, he was the leader of Namangi Aute, a francophone movement originally founded in 1975, and committed to decentralisation. Prior to merging with the Greens, Namangi Aute had been merged into the Union of Moderate Parties, and Telukluk had begun his political career as an MP for the UPM. Shortly after being elected to Parliament as a Green, however, he left the Confederation and re-established Namangi Aute as an independent party. He was re-elected as MP for Malekula in the 2004 and 2008 general elections, being Namangi Aute's sole Member of Parliament on both occasions. In the mid-1990s, Telukluk served as Minister for Lands in Prime Minister Maxime Carlot Korman's government. Later, he was investigated by the Ombudsman's office, which in 1999 published a report accusing him of having mismanaged the sale of deportees' properties. The report recommended that Telukluk \"should not be considered for a ministerial portfolio in any future Government\". Telukluk served as Minister for Energy, Lands and Natural Resources under Prime Minister Ham Lini in the mid-2000s. As such he considered the use of solar energy and coconut oil to help provide electricity to a greater number of people in the country. He also looked into the possibility of mining offshore natural mineral resources. In December 2010, when Sato Kilman replaced Edward Natapei as Prime Minister following a motion of no confidence, Telukluk joined Kilman's coalition government, and was appointed Minister for Lands and Natural Resources. Less than a week later, he was removed from Cabinet in a reshuffle aimed at consolidating the new government's majority by offering Cabinet posts to new coalition allies. On 24 April 2011, Kilman was himself ousted in a motion of no confidence, and succeeded by Serge Vohor. Vohor appointed Telukluk as Minister for Ni-Vanuatu (i.e., indigenous) Business. Three weeks later, however, Vohor's election and premiership were voided by the Court of Appeal, and Telukluk lost his position in government. On 16 June, Kilman's election and premiership were themselves voided by the Supreme Court, on constitutional grounds, and previous Prime Minister Edward Natapei became caretaker Prime Minister until a new leader could be elected. Telukluk was restored as caretaker Minister for Ni-Vanuatu Business. On 26 June, Sato Kilman was elected Prime Minister by Parliament, with twenty-nine votes to Serge Vohor's twenty-three, thus beginning his first lawfully recognised term as Prime Minister. He reinstated his previous Cabinet, and Telukluk once more lost his position in government. On 23 March 2013, there was a new change of government, with Moana Carcasses Kalosil (of the Green Confederation) becoming Prime Minister. On 26 February 2014, facing defections to the Opposition, Carcasses offered Cabinet positions to Opposition MPs, so as to shore up his parliamentary majority. Telukluk (now a member of the Reunification of Moderate Parties) was one of those who defected to Carcasses' government for a Cabinet job; he was appointed Minister for Internal Affairs, replacing Christophe Emmelee, who was reshuffled to the position of Minister for Justice. Telukluk lost office when the Carcasses government was brought down by a motion of no confidence on 15 May 2014. In June 2015, following a further change of government, Telukluk became Minister for Lands in the government of Sato Kilman. In October 2015, Telukluk, together with several other MPs, was convicted of bribery by the Vanuatu Supreme Court. Telukluk was found to have accepted 1,000,000 vatu from Moana Carcasses MP, in return for support in the motion of no-confidence that brought the Kilman government to power."

  "text" : "Panayiotis \"Panos\" Ioannou (Greek: Παναγιώτης (Πάνος) Ιωάννου; 26 January 1951 – 18 April 2005) was an internationally known cell biologist and neuroscientist who pioneered in research on Thalassemia.He was born in Kalograia, in the Kyrenia District of Cyprus on 26 January 1951. He died on 18 April 2005 in Melbourne, Australia at the age of 54. In 1966 after the death of his younger brother from Hodgkin's disease he and his family moved to London, United Kingdom. Panayiotis Ioannou received both his B.Sc. and his Ph.D. in biochemistry from University College, London, with a focus on the molecular mechanisms of memory laydown. His fascination with the mechanism of DNA replication also led him to publish a model for this mechanism in Nature while still a student. Ioannou set up and ran for almost 15 years the Prenatal Diagnosis for Thalassaemia in Cyprus, followed by the setting up of the Department of Molecular Genetics in the Cyprus Institute of Neurology and Genetics. He had held fellowships from various organizations, including WHO and UNESCO. In the course of a UNESCO fellowship in 1992 at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, he created the first human PAC genomic library, which has been used extensively for the sequencing of the human genome. In 1997 Ioannou moved to the Murdoch Children’s Research Institute, Melbourne, Australia, where he led the Cell and Gene Therapy (CAGT) Research Group. He concentrated on the development of novel therapies with intact genomic loci for haematological and neurological disorders, while similar approaches may have major implications in biotechnology and the biological emancipation of the human species. The Murdoch Children’s Research Institute, in Melbourne Australia, has established the ‘Panos Ioannou Fellowship’ in his memory. Jim Vadolas was awarded the Panos Ioannou Fellowship for 2006. Shireen Lamande was awarded the Panos Ioannou Travelling Fellowship in 2007. The Cyprus Institute of Neurology and Genetics has established a Young Scientist Award in his memory. Maria A. Loizidou received the award in 2009."

Her eyes were damaged by tear gas used by police on students marching to protest such arrests, and she wore dark glasses for the rest of her life. She served in many leadership roles in CORE and the NAACP, fighting against segregated stores, buses, theaters, schools, restaurants, and hotels, protesting unjust laws, and leading one of the most dangerous voter registration efforts in the country in northern Florida in the 1960s. With her daughter, Tananarive, Due wrote Freedom in the Family: a Mother-Daughter Memoir of the Fight for Civil Rights, documenting the struggle she participated in, initially as a student at Florida A&M University, and later working for civil rights organizations and Florida communities, sometimes in partnership with her husband, civil rights attorney John D.

  "text" : "Patrick Anthony Hennessy RHA (28 August 1915 – 30 December 1980) was an Irish realist painter. He was known for his highly finished still lifes, landscapes and trompe l'oeil paintings. The hallmark of his style was his carefully observed realism and his highly finished surfaces, the result of a virtuoso painting technique. He was brought up in Arbroath by his mother and step-father, his father having being killed during World War One. He attended Dundee School of Art where he met his lifelong companion Harry Robertson Craig. Two of his paintings were accepted in 1939 at the Royal Scottish Academy for their Annual Exhibition. For the next 29 years he lived in Ireland with extended trips abroad. He was elected a member of the Royal Hibernian Academy in 1949. The Hendriks Gallery in Dublin and the Guildhall Galleries in Chicago were the main outlets for his work. In the late 1960s he moved permanently to Tangier and then, after suffering ill health, to the Algarve. He died in London."

  "text" : "Pierre Francastel (8 June 1900 – 2 January 1970) was a French art historian, best known for his use of sociological method. Francastel's initial period of study was in literature, at the Sorbonne. He worked in building conservation at Versailles while undertaking research toward his doctoral degree, which was on the sculpture of Versailles, and in 1928 he published a monograph, including a critical catalogue, on the seventeenth-century French sculptor François Girardon. In 1930, he was appointed director of the Warsaw Institut français, and in 1936 he was appointed professor at the University in Strasbourg. In 1948, he was created inaugural Professor of the Sociology of Art at the École pratique des hautes études in Paris. Francastel's research interests varied between the French seventeenth century and the nineteenth century, but his sociological methodology, strongly influenced by the work of Émile Durkheim, remained the intellectual basis upon which his scholarly thought and corpus were organised. Francastel is also noted for his promotion of spatial concerns, both physical and conceptual, prefiguring the \"spatial turn\" of later scholars such as Henri Lefebvre. Two of his key works, that emphasise Francastel's view of art as a system both embedded within and productive of social relations, are his Art et Sociologie (1948) and Peinture et Société (1951)."

  "text" : "Pearl Stewart was the editor of the Oakland Tribune for one year beginning December 1992, the first African-American woman editor of a metropolitan daily newspaper. Said to be \"well known for her dogged reporting,\" she was hired by David Burgin, who took a seven-month absence. The Tribune had recently been bought by the Alameda Newspaper Group where Burgin was editor-in-chief. She was intent on keeping the same style of the previous Tribune saying the negative stories about Oakland were important because it would be wrong to only highlight the good. Stewart resigned when Burgin returned, saying that she respected him \"but it is not possible for me to work with\" him. At this time the newspaper was criticized for a lack of focus on minorities in Oakland. Before her position as editor for the Oakland Tribune she was a reporter for the San Francisco Chronicle from 1980 to 1991. Later, she was director of career development and an instructor at Florida A&M's School of Journalism and Graphic Communication. While there she started the website Black College Wire which promotes journalism among HBCUs.  In January 2005 she became managing editor of the \"black-oriented Chicago Defender.\" She resigned two months later."

  "text" : "Pain fitzJohn (sometimes Payn fitzJohn, Payn FitzJohn, or Pagan fitzJohn; died 1137) was an Anglo-Norman nobleman and administrator, one of King Henry I of England's \"new men\", who owed their positions and wealth to the king. Pain's family originated in Normandy, but there is little to suggest that he had many ties there, and he appears to have spent most of his career in England and the Welsh Marches. A son of a minor nobleman, he rose through ability to become an important royal official during Henry's reign. In 1115 he was rewarded with marriage to an heiress, thereby gaining control of the town of Ludlow and its castle, which he augmented with further acquisitions. Although later medieval traditions described Pain as a chamberlain to King Henry, that position is not securely confirmed in contemporary records. He did hold other offices though, including that of sheriff in two counties near the border between England and Wales. In his capacity as a royal justice Pain also heard legal cases for the king throughout much of western England. After King Henry's death in 1135 Pain supported Henry's nephew, King Stephen, and was with the new king throughout 1136. In July 1137 Pain was ambushed by the Welsh and killed as he was leading a relief expedition to the garrison at Carmarthen. His heirs were his daughters, Cecily and Agnes. Cecily married the son of one of Pain's close associates, Miles of Gloucester. Pain was generous in his gifts of land to a number of monastic houses."

  "text" : "Pierre-Alexis Delamair (French pronunciation: ​[pjɛːʁ aleksi dəlamɛːʁ]) (Châtenay-Malabry 1675/6 — Agde 25 July 1745) was a French architect, theorist and city planner, whose ambitious plan for a rational restructuring of the center of Paris, 1737, never came to fruition, as it would have required the demolition of the existing city to be replaced with an ideal city. Delamair was the son of Antoine Delamaire, and received his training in the Bâtiments du Roi, directed by Robert de Cotte. His three works on architecture remained in manuscript. In one, Delamair proposed in 1725 enlarging and connecting as one, the three islands in the Seine, the Île de la Cité, the Île Saint-Louis, and the Île Louvier, to make a single Île de Paris that would make a more suitable site for the Hôtel de Ville. The idea was taken up by Pierre-Louis Moreau-Desproux in 1769 and expanded towards the end of the 18th century by Pierre Patte and by Charles De Wailly. Delamair completed three hôtels particuliers, the Hôtel de Soubise at Paris (1704–1709), for François de Rohan, prince de Soubise, and the adjoining Hôtel de Rohan (1705–1708), built for Soubise's son, Armand-Gaston, bishop of Strasbourg, and revisions to the former Palais Rohan at Strasbourg (1705–1708, demolished within Delamair's lifetime for the present structure). His replacement at the Rohan houses by Germain Boffrand, at the moment of his precocious triumph, left him an embittered man."

  "text" : "Charles \"Packy\" Axton (17 February 1941 - January 1974) was an American rhythm and blues tenor saxophone player and bandleader, who was a member of the Mar-Keys and later the Packers. He was born in Memphis, Tennessee, the son of Everett and Estelle Axton. Estelle Axton and her brother, Jim Stewart, were the founders of Stax Records. By 1959, Packy Axton had become a member of the Royal Spades, a group formed by Steve Cropper, Donald \"Duck\" Dunn, Charlie Freeman and Terry Johnson, which expanded to include a horn section composed of Axton, Don Nix and Wayne Jackson. In 1961, they renamed themselves the Mar-Keys and had a major hit with \"Last Night\" (number 3 on the Billboard Hot 100, number 2 on the R&B chart). Axton and Jackson were the only members of the band to perform on the record; the other parts were played by session musicians. After Cropper left the band in 1961, soon followed by Dunn, Axton became the effective leader of the Mar-Keys and also worked as a session musician at Stax. He left in 1965 to live in Los Angeles, reportedly after a series of disagreements with Jim Stewart. Later in 1965, the Stax Revue performed in Los Angeles, and radio disc jockey Magnificent Montague persuaded Axton to record there with Cropper, Booker T. Jones and Al Jackson, of Booker T. & the M.G.'s. They recorded an instrumental track together, \"Hole in the Wall\", which Montague then released as by the Packers; it reached number 43 on the pop chart and number 5 on the R&B chart. Axton formed a pickup group to promote the record. He later returned to Memphis, where he recorded several singles credited to the Pac-Keys, mostly featuring members of the Bar-Kays. After 1967, he ran the Satellite Record Shop in Memphis, occasionally performing with musicians such as Charlie Rich. Axton died in January 1974 at the age of 32. According to one source, the cause of death was cirrhosis of the liver; according to another source, he died of a heart attack."

Oatey played 120 SANFL games with Norwood, from 1965 to 1972. Early in his career he was a half forward flanker but he later appeared mostly as a rover. He is the son of Jack Oatey and brother of Robert Oatey, both South Australian Football Hall of Fame inductees. He partnered Ian Bidmeade in the 1967 Australian Championship doubles but they were eliminated in the opening round, by Americans Jim McManus and Jim Osborne. In the 1968 Australian Championships he had more success, reaching the quarter finals of the doubles with his partner Barry Phillips-Moore. They defeated eighth seeds William Coghlan and Colin Stubbs in the opening round, in five sets. In the next round they had a walkover win over the Japanese pair, Jun Kamiwazumi and Toshiro Sakai. Their quarterfinal encounter with the number one seeds, William Bowrey and Ray Ruffels, proved too much and they exited in straight sets. Oatey also competed in the singles draw and again encountered William Coghlan in the first round, this time losing in four sets. Had Oatey won he would have met his own doubles partner, Phillips-Moore, in the second round."

He was born in Kokand, Uzbekistan and raised in central Russia. In 1990, at the age of 26, Kulakov was the first Christian to appear live regularly on two national communist radio networks, blanketing 11 time zones with 900 FM stations. Moscow State University research showed the Voice of Hope radio program as the most popular among all the other religious broadcasts. In 1992 he appeared at the Kremlin Palace of Culture for 12 days as a Russian translator for American Evangelist Mark Finley, as well as in the Moscow Olympic Stadium in 1993. In 2005 Peter Kulakov started a weekly Light of Hope television program in two languages, Russian and English. The Russian Light of Hope program is broadcast on the CNL evangelical satellite network, as well as on the Hope Europe satellite channel. The English program is aired weekly on Comcast channel 5 in Metro Atlanta. In 2007 and in 2010 Kulakov presented two major satellite evangelistic series of meetings live from Kiev, Ukraine and Chisineu, Moldova."

  "text" : "Pavel Pavlovich Muratov (Russian: Па́вел Па́влович Мура́тов), also known as Paul Muratov (3 March [O.S. 19 February] 1881 - February 5, 1950), was a Russian essayist, novelist, art historian, critic and playwright. Born in Bobrov in the Voronezh Oblast into the family of a military doctor, Muratov attended a Cadet Corps and graduated from the Petersburg State Transport University in 1903. He traveled abroad in 1905-06, after which he moved to Moscow and worked at the Rumyantsev Museum until 1914. He became friends with the writers Boris Zaytsev, Vladislav Khodasevich, and Nina Berberova (who called him \"one of the most remarkable men I ever met\"), as well as the artist Nikolai Ulyanov. From 1906 he began to publish in journals like Vesy, Zolotoe Runo, and Apollon. He collaborated with Igor Grabar on the latter's History of Russian Art, and in 1913-14 he helped publish the journal Sofia, dedicated to early Russian art. He served in World War I and was awarded medals. After 1918 he helped Grabar restore cathedrals and was associated with the only bookshop in Moscow which remained unregulated by the state - the Writer's Library. Having been banished in 1922, he spent the 1920s in Berlin, where he became part of the émigré community. By the 1930s he had moved to Paris - during the late 1920s and early 1930s he brought out several books in French, including ones on Fra Angelico and Russian icons, as well as a novel in Russian, Egeria (1922). During World War II he was in Ireland, working as a military journalist ; he wrote an account of the Russian campaigns for Penguin Books. Clive James has called Muratov an example of \"just how brilliant somebody can be and still be a forgotten man,\" and called his book Obrazy italii (Images of Italy) (in three volumes, published in 1911, 1912, and 1924) \"one of the most dazzling books of its type ever written. As a book on the Italian Grand Tour it not only stands directly in the tradition of Goethe, Gregorovius, Burckhardt and Arthur Symons, but it is better than any of them.\""

  "text" : "Paata Shamugia (in Georgian: პაატა შამუგია) – one of the most influential contemporary Georgian poets.

In 2015 year he became the first Georgian poet to get the most prestigious SABA literary prize twice. After publishing his début poem \"Panther's Skin\" in 2006 (in which author countered so-called \"Georgian Bible\" \"The knight in the panther's skin\"), he gained wide popularity in Georgian public. During several months in the Georgian press and TV people had disputed around this book.After 3 years, in 2010 Paata Shamugia published book \"Preference\", Was commended by the critics and estimated as an author's best book. In 2015 year publishing-house INTELEKTI published Paata Shamugia's famous book SCHIZO-POEMS, which brought him most prestigious literary prize of Georgia for the second time. As a literary critic and poet, George Lobjanidze has mentioned, \"Paata Shamugia's poetry is the most adequate for the reality of today, because no one reader remains indifferent toward his texts. For some people - and mostly for his peers or the younger generations - Paata is an idol. Some strongly believes he's a mason, godless, anti traditional etc...\" \"One can randomly open SCHIZO-POEMS at any page and find an inspiring quotation - an influential social message, slogan, motto - as the best sample of intertextuality; as an innovative, quite an unusual product born between poetic and mathematic logics\" - Poet and literary critic Shota Iatashvili has emphasized in his review."

  "text" : "Philip Denwood is a British Tibetologist noted for his work on traditional Tibetan arts and handicrafts, Himalayan architecture and Tibetan linguistics. He was born on 29 August 1941 in Workington, Cumberland where he also grew up. In 1962 he gained his BA in Geography and History at University College London (UCL), and later in 1964 an MA in Architecture and Town Planning from Liverpool University. He became a research Fellow in Tibetan at SOAS in 1965 and became Lecturer in Tibetan in 1973. Denwood describes his interest in Himalayan cultures as purely accidental. Having completed his study at Liverpool and based in England, Denwood was living next door to a friend of his from college David Snellgrove. Snellgrove had not long returned from a trip to the Himalayas and had brought five Tibetan refugees back with him around the time of the first wave of exiles post 1959. Denwood's intrigue about the situation with his friend's house guests, coupled with his interest in oriental architecture inspired him to join Snellgrove on an overland trip to India he had been planning. They drove a landrover to Nepal together, (which they later sold to a Bhutanese army officer,) and Denwood stayed there learning Tibetan while Snellgrove went ahead to South India. When Snellgrove returned to Nepal, Denwood joined him once again and they drove to Bhutan. The trip lasted a year in total and learning the Tibetan language had prompted Denwood's interest in linguistics. When he returned to England, Denwood landed the training post of Research Fellow of Tibetan at the School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London (SOAS), where he was eventually appointed as a lecturer. During his time learning Tibetan in Nepal, Denwood had observed the lack of material available for learning the language, and found the native approach to teaching too unscientific. His budding interest in linguistics brought about his own analysis of the language, learning also from Richard Keith Sprigg who at the time was teaching in the SOAS Linguistics department. This study culminated in the writing of his own book of Tibetan grammar, titled; 'Tibetan'. Denwood's interest in Tibetan handicrafts he again describes as accidental. The SOAS library had sent him to Delhi, India on a placement for 6 months. He traveled with his wife and two young children. Having been introduced to the Tibetan community there he became familiar with the carpet trade. It was his wife who decided to learn how to weave a carpet, whilst Denwood wrote a book about the process. Denwood retired from teaching at SOAS in 2006."

  "text" : "Periannan Senapathy is a molecular biologist, geneticist, author and entrepreneur. He is the founder, president and chief scientific officer at Genome International Corporation, a biotechnology & bioinformatics firm based in Madison, Wisconsin, which develops next-generation DNA sequencing analysis technologies. He is known for an algorithm for discovering disease-causing mutations in splice junctions in cancerous and non-cancerous diseases (known as Shapiro & Senapathy algorithm, S&S) that is being used in major research institutions around the world. The S&S algorithm has been highly cited in nearly 3,000 publications on finding splicing mutations in thousands of diseases including many different forms of cancer. Senapathy is also known for offering a new theory on the origin and diversity of life on earth, where he proposes that genomes for eukaryotic life forms could have been directly assembled from a common pool of split genes in prebiotic chemistry. He had authored a book, titled Independent Birth of Organisms in 1994, where he first proposed this theory. He has also published his scientific findings in journals such as  Science (journal), Nucleic Acids Research, PNAS among others, and is the author of several patents in the genomics field."

Ladd was a lecturer and MSc Coordinator (MSc in Deaf Studies to approx 2007, then after a brief pause, MSc in Deafhood Studies 2009) at the Centre for Deaf Studies at the University of Bristol. Despite considerable international pressure, the centre was wound down as the MSc was closed in 2009, the undergrad programme taught out from 2010 to 2013, and the centre finally closed in the July of that year. Ladd was one of the first presenters of BBC's See Hear and presented the earliest programmes from 1984 in both sign and speech. He has been a core campaigner for Deaf rights since the 80s, and was involved in the National Union of the Deaf, one of the earliest British Deaf activist organisations. He held the Powrie V. Doctor Chair in Deaf Studies at Gallaudet University, Washington DC. He completed his Ph.D. in Deaf Culture at Bristol University in 1998 and has written, edited and contributed to numerous publications in the field. His works have received international recognition. Ladd's contribution to the Deaf world has not only been academic. For a period, he toured with the Grateful Dead as their on stage sign translator. He was also the founder of the Glastonbury Festival Sign Zone. Dr. Ladd authored the book, Understanding Deaf Culture: In Search of Deafhood. He was added to the Roll of Honour of the British Deaf Association for “Outstanding Contributions to the Deaf Community in Deaf Education” (2007)."

  "text" : "Peter Kamais (born 7 November 1976) is a Kenyan long-distance runner who specialises in road running events. He was the winner at the Oeiras International Cross Country and Almond Blossom Cross Country races in 2006, but it was at the Cursa de Bombers 10K where he established himself, taking consecutive wins in 2006 and 2007. He knocked almost a minute of the course record in 2006 as he crossed the line with a time of 27:29 minutes. In 2009, he came seventh at the Berlin Half Marathon, going on to win at the Paderborn Easter Run, and then running one of the fastest times of the year at the Tilburg 10K, which he won in 27:09 minutes. This ranked him as the fourth fastest ever over the distance at the time. He upset the predictions for the 2010 New York City Half Marathon, taking the men's title with his first time under an hour (59:53 minutes) and beating opposition including Haile Gebrselassie and Moses Kigen Kipkosgei. Kamais came second to Gebre Gebremariam at the UAE Healthy Kidney 10K in Central Park in May. He was invited to the 2010 New York City Marathon later that year and he completed his debut over the distance with a time of 2:14:59 hours for twelfth place. He returned to the New York Half in March 2011, but a clash with Galen Rupp upset his run and he ended the race in fifth place. He repeated that placing at the 2011 Beijing Marathon and set a personal best time of 2:12:58 hours in the process. Kamis set a new personal best time in the 2012 Xiamen International Marathon, winning the race in a course record of 2:07:37."

  "text" : "Paul-Henri Grauwin (1914–1989) was a medical doctor who served with the French Army, most notably commanding the \"Mobile Surgical Unit\" during the prolonged Battle of Dien Bien Phu, after which he was taken prisoner and briefly held captive by the Viet Minh. Of Flemish background, Grauwin served as a surgeon during the Second World War. During the course of the First Indochina War, the French had established a base at Dien Bien Phu in late 1953. Dr. Grauwin, holding the rank of major, arrived in February 1954 to take charge of the 42-bed hospital unit there, conducting triage for evacuation and operating when necessary. After the Viet Minh siege began in early March, Dr. Grauwin was kept busy with large numbers of casualties that flooded his surgical bunker. While the airstrip at the base was still in use, he evacuated many of the injured back to Hanoi. Grauwin soon found his facilities overwhelmed with casualties who had to be put in the halls. In one night, he and another surgeon amputated twenty-three limbs, plastered fifteen fractures, and repaired numerous other wounds: ten abdominal, ten chest, and two cranial. At other times, shelling killed those waiting for medical attention. By the end of March Grauwin's hospital consisted of six shelters with 250 beds. Supplies dropped from the air included the contents of a United States field hospital with pajamas, sheets, cots, and vials of antibiotics. He also received two new aides, a Private Fleury and Geneviève de Galard In the last week of April, with the airstrip no longer usable, Grauwin's hospital contained more than one thousand wounded, and he had begun using some of the women from the base's brothels as medical orderlies. By the end of the battle in May, Grauwin had more than 1,300 wounded in the makeshift wards of his hospital, and deprived by the shelling of electricity, was forced to operate by candlelight. With the fall of the base on May 7, he was taken into captivity by the Viet Minh. Grauwin remained in captivity until June 1, when he and other French medical officers were exchanged for several hundred Vietnamese prisoners. In 1954, Grauwin published a memoir entitled J'étais médecin à Diên Biên Phu, which was translated into English in 1955 with the title Doctor at Dien Bien Phu."

While the content of his thought remains relatively unknown, Plaoul is often noted for his role in ending the Great Schism. He was present at the three French clergy councils in the 1390s called by King Charles the VI. There he advocated for the withdrawal of obedience from the Avignon Pope. He was also a speaker at the Council of Pisa, where the members attempted to end the schism by electing a third pope. Peter became sick and died before he could take part in the Council of Constance, which finally brought an end to the schism."

  "text" : "Phillips Tead (September 29, 1893 - June 9, 1974), sometimes billed as Phil Tead, was an American character actor in film and television. Among his many roles he might be best remembered as the semi-recurring character \"Professor Pepperwinkle\", an eccentric inventor in several of the color episodes of the 1950s TV series Adventures of Superman. His appearances included the final episode, \"All That Glitters\". His first appearance had been as a shopkeeper named Mr. Willy, a similarly eccentric character. One visible early role is an appearance in Horse Feathers, the 1932 Marx Brothers comedy, in which he plays a radio play-by-play announcer at the film's climactic college football game. His film career began in silent pictures in 1914 and ran some 40 years. In the early 1950s he turned his attention primarily to television, appearing in various western series as well as Superman. Phil Tead starred in the episode \"Old Bailey\" of the western series, The Lone Ranger, in 1952 from Season 3, episode 49, where he played the title character Old Bailey along with John Hart (actor) & Jay Silverheels. Tead's final television work came in several episodes of the western series, The Lawman, during 1958-1959. He appeared as a storekeeper, as with his early Superman appearance."

  "text" : "Priscilla Coleman has worked as a court artist for ITN and newspapers in the UK for over 20 years, having originally started her career in her native America. Coleman studied Fine Art and graphics at Sam Houston University in Texas. She worked for advertising agencies and a printing company laying out pages for publications before moving to the UK when her English husband wanted to return home. She became a court artist when her art college teachers recommended her to cover a big case near where she went to university. With her background in graphics she was able to produce images for television news reports. In London, she was taken on by ITN. \"I walked past the Old Bailey court and told one of the reporters from ITN that I could do court drawings and he put me in touch with his boss. I was soon sent to cover my first court case.\" When working, she prefers to sit in the court rather than in a media annexe, where the cameras tend to concentrate on who is speaking and the images are frequently too fuzzy. She does not actually draw in court - to do so would be illegal - but like other court artists takes notes in shorthand, for example about size of head, shape of nose, tie colour, haircut, without taking their eyes off the accused, as well as cryptic comments such as \"gt bones... v. pretty silver hair... a v. glam older man... like an eagle\" (Lord Hutton). Depending on TV news deadlines, she may have only 15 to 30 minutes to prepare a sketch. She works in oil pastel and water-based sticks because \"they look like chalks, but are durable and don’t smudge\". Among the high-profile cases Coleman has covered are the trials of Rosemary and Fred West, Ian Huntley and Maxine Carr, Barry George, Colin Ireland, Harold Shipman and Raoul Moat's accomplices. She also covered Gillian Taylforth's unsuccessful libel case against The Sun, the Hutton inquiry and the inquests into the deaths of the July 7 bombings. Apart from her work as a courtroom artist, Coleman produces silk screens and colour block graphics for interiors."

  "text" : "Paul Emil Jacobs (August 20, 1802 in Gotha – January 6, 1866) was a German painter. Jacobs, son of the philologist Frederick Jacobs, received his art training at the Munich Academy of Fine Arts and first became known for his painting of Mercury and Argus (from Classical mythology). In 1824 he went to Rome, where he attracted critical attention by painting \"The Raising of Lazarus\". In 1836 he made a series of historical paintings at the Welfenschloss in Hannover. Jacobs was noted for his mastery of nudes, expressed particularly in the representation of such Orientalist themes as \"A slave market\" or of sleeping and waking naked boys. Graceful depictions of the female body include his \"A Harem Beauty At Her Toilette\" and \"Zither-playing Turk\". His image of Scheherezade from Arabian Nights is noted for its light effects. The famous Ali Pasha was depicted by Jacobs in a moment of relaxed intimacy with his favorite mistress (or wife) Kira Vassiliki. Like many Europeans of his generation, Jacobs shared in the Philhellene sympathy for the Greek War of Independence, which took place when he was in the early stage of his artistic career. This was manifested in his painting very sympathetic pictures of \"Greek Freedom Fighters\". Jacobs was also a portrait painter. Lithographed portraits by him include those of Goethe, Karl Gottlieb Bretschneider and Döring. In 1844, Jacobs created the monumental altarpiece \"Calvary\", for St. Augustine's Church in Gotha. It was removed from St. Augustine's in 1939, and since 1998 the altarpiece has been located in the church of Hohenleuben. Jacobs was married to Louise Jahn, and his grandson Emil Jacobs (1868–1940) was a librarian and head of the library at the University of Freiburg."

  "text" : "Patrick Baert (born 23 January 1961 in Brussels) is a Belgian sociologist and social theorist, based in Britain. He is Professor of Social Theory at the University of Cambridge and Fellow of Selwyn College, Cambridge. Baert studied at the Free University of Brussels and at Oxford University where he obtained his D.Phil. in 1990. In Oxford he studied with Rom Harré and wrote his dissertation on George Herbert Mead's notion of time and its relevance for social theory, subsequently published as Time, Self and Social Being. He carried out postdoctoral work with Claude Javeau in Brussels and Anthony Giddens in Cambridge before taking up a teaching position at Cambridge. He has held various visiting positions, including Brown University, the University of Cape Town, the CNRS/EHESS and the University of British Columbia. His most recent books include The Existentialist Moment; The Rise of Sartre as a Public Intellectual and (co-written with Marcus Morgan) Conflict in the Academy; A Study in the Sociology of Intellectuals.  He also published Social Theory in the Twentieth Century and Beyond. and Philosophy of the Social Sciences: Towards Pragmatism. Since January 2013, he is the Editor-in-Chief of the International Journal of Politics, Culture, and Society. Baert's recent work lies at the intersection between the sociology of intellectuals and intellectual history. The Existentialist Moment explains the sudden rise of Sartre as a public intellectual in the mid-1940s.  In this book Baert describes the reshaping of the intellectual and cultural field in France during WWII and he shows how Sartre was able to present a neat vocabulary to make sense of and come to terms with the trauma of the war. Baert pays particular attention to the trials of French collaborationist intellectuals in which the notion of responsibility loomed large - a notion which also became central in the broader cultural realm at the time. During this period, Sartre redefined his philosophy, making it simpler and more digestable, centring it around this notion of responsibility of the intellectual. Hence his idea of the engaged intellectual which also became a guiding principle of the journal Les Temps modernes. Towards the end of The Existentialist Moment Baert also discusses the gradual decline of interest in Sartre and existentialism from the early 1960s onwards. With the rise and instititionalisation of the social sciences, expert public intellectuals gained in significance in comparison with authoritative public intellectuals. Authoritative public intellectuals like Sartre rely on their privileged parcours and elite training to speak with moral vigour about a wide range of social and political issues without necessarily having expertise in them. Expert public intellectuals draw on methodological training and expertise in the social sciences to intervene politically. In this context, the rise of structuralism in the late 1950s and 1950s is particularly significant. In contrast with existentialism (which was very much embedded in the humanities), structuralism was compatible with the emerging social sciences (and indeed with other theoretical currents such as Marxism and psychoanalysis). The last chapter of The Existentialst Moment develops the theoretical framework - positioning theory - that underpins the book. This frame of reference also guides partly Conflict in the Academy although the latter also draws explicitly on insights from cultural sociology. Baert's earlier work deals with the philosophy of social sciences. He argues against several existing contributions to the philosophy of social sciences. Against those philosophies of social science that infer prescriptions for the social sciences based on attempts to demarcate science from non-science, he argues that developments in the history and sociology of science have undermined the validity of the notion of demarcation. Contrary to those social scientists who liken their empirical research to an arbitration court that helps to decide the fate of the theory or research programme under consideration, he contends that research in the social sciences relies on theoretical presuppositions which are contestable - and contested - to such an extent that empirical research cannot be regarded as a straightforward testing device. In opposition to what he coins ‘the social cartography model’ (according to which high-quality social research captures the inner essence of the social world as accurately and completely as possible and social theory provides the conceptual building blocks for this representation), he argues that it is not fruitful to conceive of research in terms of the passive recording of the external world, and that this representational model ultimately leads to theoretical ossification. Baert argues in favour of a neo-pragmatist philosophy of social science which promotes social research in the pursuit of self-referential knowledge. Whereas many contributions to the philosophy of social science assume that social research is primarily an explanatory (and possibly predictive) endeavor, Baert contends that this picture does not correspond to the actual practice of social research. He points out that few significant contributions to sociology - and social research in general - are straightforward explanatory works, and even fewer are exclusively explanatory. Baert's position is that most of those groundbreaking works involve ‘self-referential knowledge’: they enable communities to re-describe and re-conceptualise themselves and their presuppositions. Inspired by Rorty's neo-pragmatism, he has argued in favour of the pursuit of self-referential knowledge, and he has analysed the methodological strategies that make this possible in various disciplines, ranging from archaeology and social anthropology to sociology and history. For instance, Nietzsche's genealogical history can provide contemporary communities with tools that enable them to re-evaluate the moral and cognitive categories they use to describe the world and their place within it. Baer's notion of self-referential knowledge relates to the German notion of Bildung or self-edification and with a new role for intellectuals, whereby they facilitate envisaging alternative socio-political scenarios rather than presenting a set of normative or epistmeological foundations. A special issue of the journal Human Studies was dedicated to a symposium around Baert's Philosophy of the Social Sciences: Towards Pragmatism. In this issue Stephen Turner questioned Baert's attempt to promote dialogue whilst holding onto a notion of expertise. In the same issue Paul Roth  argues that Baert contradicts himself: whilst rightly rejecting the notion of a scientific method, Baert then surprisingly suggests a method for pursuing self-referential knowledge. Bohman  contends that Baert underestimates the ability of social scientists to develop generalisations which can lead to emancipatory political agendas. For a critical exchange between Baert and Peter Manicas, see the Journal of Critical Realism; Whilst sympathetic to Dewey, Manicas disagrees with Baert's neo-pragmatism. For a critical exchange between Patrick Baert/Filipe Carreira da Silva and Simon Susen (in relation to Baert and Silva's 2010 book), see the journal Distinktion; Scandinavian Journal of Social Theory. Whilst sympathetic, Susen laments, for instance, Baert and Carreira da Silva's anti-foundationalism."

On November 15, 1962, Hansen moved from his position as Defence Minister to replace the recently deceased Hans R. Knudsen as Minister of Finance. As Jens Otto Krag did not have a Danish Minister of Economic Affairs ready for his newly elected government on September 26, 1964, Hansen served as interim Minister of Finance and Economic Affairs both for two weeks, until Henry Grünbaum was named permanent Minister of Economic Affairs on October 8, 1964."

Saunier's life story has been assembled by William Robbins and Mary Howson of the New York Botanical Garden and Department of Botany, Columbia University: their account includes lists of seeds and plants sent by Saunier to France in 1788, 1790 and 1791 together with literature and letters relating to his life."

  "text" : "Paolo Canevari (born Rome, 1963) is an Italian contemporary artist. He lives and works in New York. He is one of the Italian internationally recognized artist of his generation, known for using different kind of materials and media like animation, drawing, video, sculpture and installation. Paolo Canevari presents highly recognizable or even commonplace symbols in order to comment on such concept as religion, the urban myths of happiness or the major principles behind creation and destruction. Starting as a sculptor the artist treats the rest of his work also as a drive to turn the passive state of mind into an energetic, creative act. His adoption of the medium of video is associated also with his desire to make images which are ephemeral yet visually striking. His recent video works can be seen as a form of ephemeral sculpture which rejects the rhetoric about eternal monuments. As he underlines in one of his statement: \"I believe that the most important inspiration for an artist’s work is people’s way of thinking. Spirituality, as part of the human condition, brings with it a presence, a meaning, a symbol, a soul. I utilize icons in my work as a way of connecting with this fundamental truth. A tire, a skull, or a bomb are recognizable images and part of our universal knowledge, just as much as a sacred image, or an image of a dog. What I do is use these icons in a new context, or structure, that places their meaning in jeopardy.\" Between 1989 and 1990 he lives in New York where he has his first solo show Rocce. In the 1990s he exhibited in numerous group shows in Los Angeles at the art gallery of Otis Parsons College of Art and Design, in Paris, in Kiev at the Soros Center for Contemporary Art, Vienna at the Vienna Secession, Frankfurt, in Dublin at the IMMA Irish Museum of Modern Art, Geneva, Taiwan, Liege as well as in Bologna, Rome, Milan, Prato, Naples, Spoleto, Venice.In 1999 the participation in the XIII Quadriennale Palazzo delle Esposizioni Roma.In the next years his work is featured in numerous solo exhibitions.

In 2004 the solo project \"Welcome to Oz\" at the Center for Contemporary Art PS1, New York curated by Alanna Heiss and the show “A Couple of Things I Have to Tell You” in the Sean Kelly Gallery, New York.

Brennan was born Patricia Wilkinson in Sydney and had a traditional Anglican upbringing. After completing her medical studies at the University of Sydney, she and her husband, Robert Brennan, travelled to Nigeria where they worked as missionaries. Upon their return to Australia, she became concerned with the status of women in the Anglican Church and founded the Movement for the Ordination of Women. The movement had some success, with the first female priests being ordained in Perth in 1992, although Brennan's home diocese of Sydney continues to refuse to ordain women priests. She was made a Member of the Order of Australia (AM) in 1993, in recognition of her services to the community, particularly as founding president of the Movement for the Ordination of Women. Brennan died in 2011, aged 66, of pancreatic cancer."

  "text" : "Patrick Finglas (died 1537) was a leading Irish judge of the sixteenth century, who was regarded as a mainstay of the English Crown in Ireland. He was also the author of an influential \"Breviat \" or tract, Of the Getting of Ireland, and of the Decay of the same, concerning the decline of English power in Ireland. Little is known of his parentage, but Francis Elrington Ball states that he came from a long established family who took their surname from Finglas, County Dublin. He later held estates at Piercetown, near Dunboyne, County Meath, and at Westphailstown in County Dublin. He was at Lincoln's Inn 1503-6 and became Serjeant in 1509. He was considered one of the ablest lawyers of his time and a gifted writer. Finglas was appointed Chief Baron of the Irish Exchequer by Henry VIII in 1520, and afterwards, by patent dated at Westminster 8 May 1534  he was constituted Lord Chief Justice of the King's Bench for Ireland in the place of Sir Bartholomew Dillon, recently deceased. He resigned the latter office in 1535, and later served a second term as Chief Baron until his death in 1537. He was a member of the Privy Council of Ireland. He wrote A Breviat (summary) of the getting (conquest) of Ireland, and of the Decaie (decay) of the same. An original manuscript of this work is in the Public Record Office  It is described in the calendar as \"An Historical Dissertation on the Conquest of Ireland, the decay of that land, and measures proposed to remedy the grievances thereof arising from the oppressions of the Irish nobility\". The measures proposed included settlement of the province of Leinster by \"English lords and gentlemen\", the securing of castles and other strong places, and more controversially, the suppression of all monasteries which he regarded as potential centres of rebellion. He did not urge the expulsion of the native Irish people, arguing that they would be a useful element in society if properly governed. The \"Breviat\" probably built on an earlier treatise, \"The Decay of Ireland\", by Sir William Darcy, the long-serving Vice-Treasurer of Ireland. Finglas was regarded by the English Crown as one of the principal supporters of its rule in Ireland; in 1520 the Lord Deputy of Ireland, the Earl of Surrey, praised him to Cardinal Wolsey as one of \"the best willed and most diligent to do the King's Grace true and faithful service of all the learned men of this land.\" He married Isabella Golding, daughter of Robert Golding of Churchtown, Dublin. Their daughter and heiress, Genet, married Sir Thomas Fitzwilliam and had four children: they were the grandparents of Thomas FitzWilliam, 1st Viscount FitzWilliam."

A witness stated that Scott died trying to save a child. In the courtroom, quiet cheers and weeping could be heard after the verdict had been read aloud just shortly after 1:30. Justice Robert Kilpatrick, the presiding justice, said that the verdict reflected \"the quality of justice in the jurors' hearts and in their own community\". Andrew Mahar, defence attorney for Kolola, stated outside the courthouse that this is the saddest case he has ever worked in his entire career as a defence attorney. \"A family lost a lovely young man. Another family lost their father – six kids – all for a moment of basically pointless violence,\" Mahar told reporters, \"There's just no happy ending to this for anybody.\""

  "text" : "Pedro Virgili (Catalan: Pere Virgili i Bellver) (Vilallonga del Camp, Tarragona, 1699 – Barcelona, 1776) was one of the most prominent royal surgeons of Spain in the 18th century and one of the surgeons of the King of Spain. He has been described as particularly influential and was regarded as a role model by subsequent esteemed men of this profession in Spain, such as Antonio Gimbernat. He trained in the medical profession in Montpellier and Paris. He served as a military surgeon at hospitals in Tarragona, Valencia y Cádiz. where he founded the Royal College of Surgeons and the Botanical Garden of Cádiz in 1760. Along with Jorge Juan y Santacilia, Virgili organized a scientific \"assembly\" which they had envisioned developing into a national academy of science in Madrid. A British medical journal of 1861 said of him \"What Piquer was to scientific medicine in Spain, Pedro Virgili, his contemporary, was to scientific surgery ; but in this not so much by his writings, as through the powerful impetus he gave for its advancement by his successful organization of those separate surgical schools\". Virgili is also noted for his use of tracheostomy to treat quinsy; the procedure is better known for treating diphtheria. One of his most notable publications was his Compendium of Midwifery, an important textbook used by new surgical colleges in Spain. He died in 1776 at the age of 77. The military hospital Sanitari Parc Pere Virgili (his Catalan name) in Barcelona has been named in his honor. An award is also given by the City of Cádiz and the Royal Academy of Medicine in his name."

Winner of 40 awards, her productions have been presented on television in North America, Europe, Latin America, Asia and Australia, at numerous universities, within niche communities as well as in the international film festival circuit. The American horror movie site Dread Central  referenced her in their list of the \"Rising Female Filmmakers\" to watch along other notable female directors like the Soska Sisters and Jennifer Kent. \"Patricia Chica is known for making bold, edgy, and visually striking independent films”, mentioned the article. Over the years, Patricia has developed a cinematic style characterized by its use of surreal imagery and meticulous editing techniques to portray the intrapsychic of her characters. She uses twisted and disturbing elements within her films to shock audiences and make them think differently about certain hard-hitting realities. As reported in the documentary \"Let it Out!\" (2013), Patricia Chica incorporates energy work within her creative process as a tool to empower her actors, collaborators and even herself. She uses energy and meditation in order to bring her actors to a higher level of consciousness and awareness that will allow them to connect, in a more profound way, with their characters."

He was a member of the American Philatelic Society, the Sudan Study Group and, from 1962 until his death, the Egypt Study Circle. As an authority in his field, Feltus helped catalogue Egyptian stamps at the Smithsonian Institution, also. Peter Feltus was born in New Orleans, scion of an old Southern landowning family. His father, John Hampden Randolph Feltus, worked closely with Secretary of the Treasury Henry Morgenthau, Jr. during World War II, and his brother, Alan Feltus, is an internationally recognized painter who lives in Assisi, Italy. Educated at Tulane University and the University of Hong Kong, Feltus was awarded a B.A. in philosophy by the University of California at Berkeley in 1969. In 1982 he published the first detailed catalogue of Egyptian and Sudanese revenue stamps. Feltus visited Egypt five times in order to prepare the catalogue which, apart from normal Egyptian revenue stamps, included descriptions of cinderella stamps, inter-postal seals and stamps incorporating deliberate errors produced for the collections of King Fuad and King Farouk. In connection with his focus on 19th century Egyptian revenue stamps, Feltus also developed a sideline as a bookseller specializing in Baedeker Guides on Egypt. He died in Berkeley, California, in 2012."

The United States Senate later put so many restrictions and conditions on US entry into the World Court that the other nations participating in it refused to allow the United States to join. Stovall was the son of Bolling Anthony Stovall, a cotton broker, and his wife the former Martha Wilson. Stovall grew up in Augusta, Georgia and was a boyhood friend of Woodrow Wilson. who would later, as President, appoint him as an ambassador. When Stovall was 16 his family moved to Athens, Georgia. he was educated at Richmond Academy and the University of Georgia graduating from the later in 1875. Stovall married Mary Ganahl (1861–1951). In the late 1880s Stovall was editor of the Augusta Chronicle. In 1891 Stovall founded the Savannah Press, a newspaper in Savannah that he served as editor and owner of. This paper was later renamed the Savannah Evening Press. The paper later merged with the Savannah Morning News. Stovall served as a member of the Georgia State Legislature from 1902–1906 and from 1912 until he resigned to become United States ambassador to Switzerland. He was a member of the Democratic Party and served as a delegate to the Democratic national Convention in 1924. Stovall wrote a biography of Robert Toombs in the 1890s and a book on Switzerland largely drawing on his experience as US ambassador there that was published posthumously in 1939."

According to Bally's 2003 Securities and Exchange Commission 10-K report, Toback was the director of administration for Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley until 1993.

He studied German studies and political sciences from 1949 to 1955, when he moved to Bonn for a one-year research fellowship to study Christianity and Marxism under professor Helmut Gollwitzer. He then spent time at a seminary in Lincoln from 1956 until 1958, before spending 1958 and 1959 as assistant guest pastor to the Protestant church in Rǖsselsheim in the church province of Hessen-Nassau. In 1959 he was ordained deacon in St Paul's Cathedral London and priest a year later. He served as curate in the parish of Holy Trinity Church, Dalston in east London. From 1961 to 1964 he was a programme producer in the religious department of the BBC from 1964 to 1969 was the Secretary of the East Europe Relations Department of the British Council of Churches. He took an active part early on in the Christian Peace Conference (Prague) and in 1964 was elected to its executive committee. On account of his critique of Soviet policies he was expelled from the Executive in 1968. From 1968 to 1981 he was the parish priest of the Church of the Ascension, Blackheath, and from 1981 to 1985 the Director of the Division of International Affairs of the British Council of Churches. During this period he became a member of the Society of Friends, and from 1985 to 1987 was a residentiary canon of Coventry Cathedral and director of the Cathedral's Centre for International Reconciliation. He made a substantial contribution to the work of the Dresden Trust, which raised funds in the UK for the reconstruction of the Frauenkirche in Dresden. He retired from the Cathedral in 1998, becoming its Canon Emeritus and moving to Brighton, where he lives with his second wife, the New Zealander Barbara Einhorn, a professor at the University of Sussex. He travelled through Germany in autumn 2010. He still works as a journalist and expert on human rights, peace, faith and society. He recently wrote a controversial piece in The Guardian (Online edition, 20 April 2012) claiming that Jesus was 'probably gay'. As chairman of the British section of Amnesty International, he worked for political prisoners in Eastern Europe during the Cold War and South Africa under apartheid. He has also worked for the end of the Cold War, German reunification, and improving relations between the Church of England and churches in East Germany and South Africa."

In November 2008, the Financial Times credited Philippa for being one of the leading young British jewellery designers. In 2010, Philippa's jewellery was featured in \"Fashion for Jewels:100 Years of Styles and Icons,\" a book written by UK Vogue's Jewellery Editor, Carol Woolton. She draws her inspirations from the worlds of nature and history, using organic objects such as seed pods, leaves, insects and skeletons, that are collected largely from where she lives, in the Savernake Forest. She uses a Renaissance ceramicist technique, \"casting from life,\" where the pieces are electro-formed and cast in gold and silver, thereby transforming these raw objects into exact replicas of wearable art. All the jewellery is produced in small workshops in England, further giving the brand an English identity."

  "text" : "Paul Barbeau is a Canadian film producer who lives in Montreal. He has produced more than 700 music videos, six feature films and has written and directed a feature film. Barbeau has produced approximately 700 music videos for various international artists (Celine Dion, Arcade Fire, Martha Wainwright, Daniel Lanois, Tragically Hip, and others) with his production company NúFilms which was founded in 2000. After several MuchMusic Video Awards, Victoires de la Musique and Grammy Award nominations, NuFilms was forced to end production largely due to the financial impacts of illegal downloading of music. In the winter of 2009, under financial strain, Barbeau shuts down the company. The experience inspired him to write and then later direct his first feature film, Après la neige aka Winter Passed (English title), released in 2012. Under his new company Reprise Films, Barbeau has produced five films. Demain and Jo pour Jonathan were directed by Maxime Giroux, with the latter having its world premiere at the 2010 Locarno International Film Festival. Roméo Onze was directed by Ivan Grbovic, and premiered at the Karlovy Vary International Film Festival in 2010 where it received the Ecumenical Jury Commendation. In 2012, he completed Sébastien Rose's film, Avant que mon coeur bascule, which starred Sophie Lorain, Sébastien Ricard and Alexis Martin and premiered at International Film Festival Rotterdam in 2013. Barbeau has been nominated for several Jutra Awards in Quebec, including a 2013 nomination for Best Picture for the film Roméo Onze. (Romeo Eleven)"

  "text" : "Sir Peter Courtney (c. 1616 – c. April, 1670) was an English politician who sat in the House of Commons in 1640 and in 1660. He fought for the Royalist cause in the English Civil War. Courtney was the son of Edward Courtney of Ladock, Cornwall, and his wife Elizabeth Gorges daughter of Tristram Gorges of Butshead, St Budeaux, Devon. He matriculated at Exeter College, Oxford on 21 June 1633, aged 16 and was admitted to Lincoln's Inn in 1636. He settled at Trethurfe, Cornwall. In April 1640, Courtney was elected Member of Parliament for Mitchell in a double return for the Short Parliament. He was knighted at York on 28 June 1642 after a hazardous ride from Cornwall to tell the King that he had the good affection of the Cornish people. During the Civil War he served under Sir Bevil Grenville. He compounded for a fine of £346 in 1648. In 1650, he was a member of the Western Association and was ready to serve on any insurrection. He claimed he had lost £7,000 and been imprisoned seven or eight times during the Commonwealth. Following the Restoration Courtney was granted the farm of Cornish tin customs which was then rescinded when it was found someone else had an earlier grant. In October 1660, he was elected Member of Parliament for Tregony in the Convention Parliament. Courtney petitioned for a pension in 1665 in view of his losses in the Royalist cause, but nothing was done. His will was proved in 1670. Courtney married firstly Alice Rashleigh, daughter of Jonathan Rashleigh of Menabilly Cornwall, and had a son and four daughters. He married secondly Amy Courtney, daughter of Peter Courtney of Penkivel, Cornwall. He had a son William and a daughter Alice who married Humphrey Courtney."

  "text" : "Peter Smyth (1800 – February 6, 1879) was an Irish-born merchant and politician in Nova Scotia. He represented Inverness County in the Legislative Assembly of Nova Scotia from 1847 to 1867 as a Reformer and then as a Conservative. He was born in Dublin and came to Nova Scotia in 1817. He was married twice: first to Mary O'Grady in 1830 and then to Ellen Keating. Smyth was a fish and cattle merchant, owned at least two stores and also dealt in land. He served as a school board commissioner, road commissioner, justice of the peace and as custos rotulorum for Inverness County. Originally a Liberal, Smyth crossed the floor in 1857 to become a Conservative. He was a member of the Legislative Council of Nova Scotia from 1867 until his death in Port Hood in 1879. A devoted Roman Catholic, Smyth donated a portion of his estate to the Diocese of Antigonish. His daughter Elizabeth married Duncan J. Campbell.DESCRIPTION OF HISTORIC PLACEThe Peter Smyth House stands prominently on raised ground in the north end of Port Hood, commanding an unrestricted view of Port Hood Harbour and two off-shore islands. Its front elevation is one-and-a-half storeys with two-and-a-half storeys at the rear. Built in the mid-1850s, its front façade has a central front entrance with two windows on either side and a Scottish dormer above. It is the only house in Inverness County built of dressed stone ashlar masonry. Municipal designation covers both the building and surrounding property. HERITAGE VALUEThe Peter Smyth House is valued as the finest example of a Georgian stone residence in Inverness County and is one of only three stone houses remaining in the county. Built for prominent merchant Peter Smyth, the stone is believed to have been quarried locally in the district of Port Hood. In true Georgian style, it has a raised first floor level entrance with a fanlight and sidelights with original stone stairs ascending to it. While one-and-a-half storeys at the front, at the rear there are a full two-and-a-half storeys. The lower level of the house, (partly below ground level on the front), contains a kitchen with original fireplace, pantry, storage and bedroom. It may be the only surviving house in Inverness County with servants quarters.The Peter Smyth House is also valued as the home of one of the most prominent Inverness County merchants and politicians of the nineteenth century - Peter Smyth. Born in Dublin, Ireland circa 1800, Peter Smyth came to Port Hood in 1830 and established himself as a fish and cattle merchant. He was heavily involved in the shipping trade and owned at least two stores for both retail and wholesale businesses. He also dealt extensively in land. After a period as a Justice of the Peace for Inverness County, he was elected to the Provincial House of Assembly in Halifax and served Inverness County in various sessions from 1847 to 1863. In 1867, he was appointed to the Legislative Council, a position which he held until his death in 1879. He also served as Custos Rotulorum (Chief Magistrate) and as commissioner for the school board and for roads.Peter Smyth is remembered as a strong supporter of the Roman Catholic Church in the Diocese of Arichat (later the Diocese of Antigonish, 1886). When he died in 1879, he was reputed to be the wealthiest man on Cape Breton Island. He made generous bequests towards St. Ninian's Cathedral and St. Francis Xavier College in Antigonish. In Port Hood, he made a major contribution to the construction of the present St. Peter's Catholic Church (1881) and was instrumental in the establishment of a boys and girls public school in Port Hood under the tutelage of the Sisters of Notre Dame of Montreal. His widow, Ellen (Keating) Smyth, was a gracious hostess and when the first two Sisters arrived in 1884, they resided with her in the stone house until their new convent was ready for occupancy. This house was also occupied by two more generations of the Smyth family. It was the official residence of John I. Smyth when he was elected the first mayor of the newly established town of Port Hood in 1903. From the 1920s through to the 1940s, Eleanor Smyth, a granddaughter of Peter Smyth, was a very well known female entrepreneur in Inverness County. She operated an inn at her home called Killarney Manor and an ice cream parlour (in an adjacent building on the property) catering to visiting county councillors, politicians, lawyers, judges, and educators in Port Hood, the Shire Town of Inverness County.Source: Municipality of the County of Inverness, Municipal Heritage Files, Peter Smyth HouseHis former home in Port Hood has been designated as a provincial heritage property."

Konoplenko had studied violin under professor Karbulka and guitar in Odessa under an Italian teacher Spetsi. He joined the Sich Riflemen and retreated with Ukrainian forces to Poland. He continued to perform throughout Europe in the mid war years. After World War II he emigrated to Canada, settling in Winnipeg where he continued to perform kobzar repertoire on his kobza. In 1961 Paul Konoplenko-Zaporozhetz recorded a disc of kobza music for the Folkways label, which is available from the Smithsonian website Konoplenko's instrument had eight strings strung along the neck and four treble strings strung on the soundboard. The tuning used was reminiscent to that of the seven-string Russian guitar tuning (open G tuning). Konoplenko was the author of a number of books about the history of the bandura, koza and kobzars published in Canada including: \n*  Кобза і бандура (\"The Kobza and Bandura\"), Winnipeg, 1963. \n*  Kobzar, Winnipeg, 1978. In 1980 he was awarded the Shevchenko Medal by the Ukrainian Canadian Congress."

  "text" : "Philip \"Phil\" Skehan (21 June 1894 - 17 June 1921) was an Australian rules footballer who played with South Melbourne in the Victorian Football League (VFL). Skehan played as a follower and was recruited to South Melbourne from Middle Park. A butcher by profession, he was a member of the South Melbourne team which defeated Collingwood in the 1918 VFL Grand Final. His last game for South Melbourne was a semi final in 1919 and he was then sacked by the club after a dispute with the committee. He hoped to continue playing football with Williamstown in the Victorian Football Association and on Wednesday 8 June 1921 was given a permit to transfer from South Melbourne. The subsequent weekend, he made his debut for Williamstown in a fixture against Essendon Association and in the first half was involved in a collision with an opponent, with both of them going for the ball. The Essendon player was able to continue the game after being treated but Skehan suffered serious concussion and had a broken right leg below the knee. He would die in hospital six days later, due to hypostatic pneumonia and concussion of the brain. He is believed to be the first VFL footballer to have lost his life as a result of an on-field injury and his death came just over a month before a similar tragedy, when Carlton rover Lyle Downs died of a heart attack in the club's training rooms."

  "text" : "Paine Proffitt (born 1972; Phoenix, Arizona) is an American-born artist living in England, best known for his sporting works and for his depiction of the \"working man's life\". Proffitt moved to Philadelphia when he was fourteen after spending his early years in Saigon, Beirut and Kenya as a result of the work of his father - novelist and war correspondent Nicholas Proffitt. Proffitt studied illustration at the University of Brighton in 1994 before moving to England permanently in 2001. Proffitt cites some of his influences as being Chagall and Picasso and while not ascribing himself to any one art movement in particular, feels that surrealism, cubism and contemporary naïve art are the best labels for his work. The influence of Fred Otnes has also been noted, with this being most apparent in the collage work Proffitt produced under the pseudonym of Nicholas Hudson Paine. Similarities to L. S. Lowry have also been recognised due to the northern working-class themes of some of his works. Sport, and especially football, has been a major inspiration to Proffitt's artwork: 'Football is central to who we are and where we come from'. This sporting theme has seen exhibitions such as that at Twickenham for the Rugby World Cup in 2007 as well as commissions for football programme artwork. West Bromwich Albion used Proffitt's work for their programme covers throughout the 2011-12 season, this culminating in the July 2012 exhibition at The Public. Proffitt's artwork featured on the 2012-13 programmes of Port Vale and Aberdeen FC although Proffitt's association with Port Vale goes back several seasons before this. Stoke-born popstar Robbie Williams is purported to own several of Proffitt's pieces, as do cyclists Bradley Wiggins and Mark Cavendish after the city council presented them with two commissioned paintings during the Stoke-on-Trent stage of the Tour of Britain in September 2012. An early Proffitt piece took top lot in a 2011 UK auction alongside work by Govinder Nazran, Sir Sidney Robert Nolan and Reggie Kray. In a departure from his football-related work, Proffitt most recently exhibited a series of gothic fairy-tale inspired paintings in an exhibition entitled Broken Sleep."

  "text" : "Perla Siedle Gibson was a South African soprano and artist who became internationally celebrated during the Second World War as the Lady in White, when she sang troopships in and out of Durban harbour. Gibson was born in Durban in 1888, the daughter of Otto Siedle, a prominent local shipping agent, businessman and musician of German extraction. In the early twentieth century she studied music and art in Europe and the US, and gave recitals in London and New York. Her youngest brother was Jack Siedle, the South African Test cricketer. During World War 2 Durban was an extremely busy waystation for convoys of ships en route to the fronts in North Africa and the Far East. Gibson became famous among thousands of Allied troops when she serenaded them as their ships passed in and out. One account of the origin for Gibson's custom was that it arose when she was seeing off a young Irish seaman her family had entertained the day before. As his ship was departing he was said to have called across the water asking her to sing something Irish, and Gibson responded with a rendition of \"When Irish Eyes are Smiling\". She decided to sing to every ship connected with the war which entered or left the harbour. Over the following years she went on to sing to more than 5,000 ships and a total of about a quarter of a million Allied servicemen. Clad in white with a red hat, she would stand at a spot at the mouth of Durban Bay where ships entering and leaving the harbour pass quite close, and sing patriotic and sentimental songs through a megaphone from a torpedoed ship, which grateful British soldiers had given her. Soldiers' talk led to the fame of the Lady in White spreading around the world. A British army newspaper called Parade, dated 3 March 1945, described Gibson as a highlight of troops' visits to Durban: As the crowded ships passed into the harbour, men lining the landward rails saw a woman, dressed in white, singing powerfully through a megaphone such songs as \"There'll Always be an England!\" and \"Land of Hope and Glory.\" A well-known local figure, she would drive down from her home on the Berea as soon as she could see that the ships were moving in. Gibson was married to Air Sergeant Jack Gibson, who served in Italy, and had two sons and a daughter in the military. She had sung all their ships goodbye as they left for the war. She even sang on the day she received news that her son Roy had been killed in the fighting in Italy. She died in 1971, shortly before her 83rd birthday. The year later a bronze plaque donated by men of the Royal Navy was erected to her memory on Durban's North Pier on the spot where she used to sing. In 1995 Queen Elizabeth II unveiled a statue of Gibson near the Ocean Terminal in Durban harbour. The statue of Perla Gibson was re-located to the Port Natal / Durban Maritime Museum on 27 September 2016"

  "text" : "Peter Max F. Sichel (born September 12, 1922) is a German American wine merchant, who created the success of the Blue Nun wine brand, for a while the largest international wine brand in the world. He was born in Mainz in 1922, where his grandfather's family wine business, H. Sichel Söhne had been established. He was educated in Germany and at Stowe School in England. The firm had offices in London and Bordeaux, and at the start of World War II, while he was apprenticed to the Bordeaux firm, he was interned as he was Jewish. He escaped to the USA via Spain and worked as a US Foreign Service Officer, running agents in Germany for which he was given the Distinguished Intelligence Medal. He continued to work for the Central Intelligence Agency in Berlin, Washington and Hong Kong until 1960, when he left, saying \"I left because the CIA did things I didn’t like, such as send people into the Ukraine to work in fabricated resistance groups. They were potentially being sent to their deaths. I made a huge fuss.\" He took over the family wine import business in New York, which he dissolved, instead dealing with Schieffelin, then a large drinks company. At this time wine was taking off as a drink in America, overtaking fortified wine, and he advertised Blue Nun as a wine you can drink \"right through the meal\", using widespread advertising. At its peak in the 1980s, annual sales in the US reached 1.25 million cases. Peter has appeared often on television in Germany as a witness to the immediate post-war years in Berlin  when he was head of the CIA in Berlin, and wrote several books on German wine and a guide to wine. He became chairman of the German parent company in 1984. By the 1990s, the Sichel company was sold to another German company, Langguth, and Peter had arranged sale of part of the Schieffelin company to LVMH. He was president of the International Wine and Spirit Competition in 1991. Until 2006 he owned the Bordeaux Château Fourcas-Hosten in Listrac, which he sold to Hermès. On the Beastie Boys 1992 album Check Your Head there is a musical interlude called The Blue Nun in which a narrator describes a party held in Peter Sichel's comfortable study in his New York townhouse in which the guests compliment the wine. This includes samples from Peter's audio recording \"On Wine: How to Select and Serve\"."

  "text" : "Paige Bradley is an American sculptor known for representative figurative bronzes. Bradley became popularly known for her sculpture concept, Expansion, a work of bronze and electricity depicting a woman's figure in a cross-legged position with light emanating from cracks in her body, originally photographed in 2004 against a Manhattan skyline. Paige Bradley is a classically trained American sculptor living and working in London, England. Her representative figurative bronzes reveal the beauty of the human form as well as the complex, often contradictory, yearnings of the human spirit. In an era when abstract and conceptual sculpture is often favored over figurative works, Bradley maintains her love of figurative art. She believes that the figure can speak an essential, timeless and universal language, one that powerfully evokes the nuanced elements of the human experience. In 2001 Bradley was voted into the prestigious National Sculpture Society, as a professional sculptor. In 2006 Ballet International Foundation commissioned her to create a bronze award to be given annually at major international competitions. 2 “Her sculptures demonstrate an ability to fuse human emotion and spirituality into an immediately appealing, yet profound form of communication,” said Andreas Kronenberg, founder and president of Ballet International. Her piece “Freedom Bound” was installed in the lobby of the new Dance Complex at Point Park University in Pittsburgh, when it opened in 2008. Much of Bradley’s work emanates from her desire to use art as a medium that is both healing and inspirational. An example is “The Ribbon of Hope and Courage” which in 2012 was donated to St. Cloud Hospital in Minnesota. Suspended approximately 15 feet above the floor in a glass-walled room, the piece features a dancer performing an arabesque and trailing a 50-foot-long bronze ribbon that rises above her and then unfurls across the room. Speaking in the hospital’s magazine, Bradley said, “My wish is that this sculpture will help inspire those with pain to feel free again, and those with troubles to feel light again. The magic of art, however, is that I can never imagine the profundity of what the viewer can bring to the meaning of the work.”"

His pursuits include or have included 1) clarinet performance with scholarships to Interlochen Arts Academy* and Oberlin Conservatory of Music as well as fellowships at the Tanglewood Music Center and the National Orchestral Association* – followed by principal clarinet positions in symphony orchestras at Carnegie Hall and Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts; 2) creation of events to honor the traditional music and dance of ethnicities in the United States and Puerto Rico – most notable being the Latin Dance Spectacular, the National Gospel Choir Competition, and the New York Hispanic Heritage Month Celebration; and 3) bridging the gap between CR research and CR application that non-scientists can use easily. This bridge enables people to improve their health thus increasing the years that they live in good health. The bridge takes the form of a) The CR Way, co-authored with his wife, Meredith Averill, and launched on Barbara Walters’ longevity special, \"Living to 150: Can You Do It?\" It presents an approach to CR that recognizes the special challenges and opportunities that human beings experience in applying CR, as compared to the lab animals that thrive on it; b) The CR Way to Happy Dieting, an online resource that takes advantage of research in neurochemistry to support healthful weight-loss efforts by starting people on a diet that first deals biochemically with their food-related emotions; and c) the Web site, LivingTheCRWay.com, maintained to provide new research results as they develop and are evaluated. The CR Way \"diet\" is based on decades of research. To this McGlothin has added his passion for testing – in the lab and in his life – the effects of what he is doing. He has carried this over to facilitating university-based research, e.g., at University of California, San Francisco (UCSF)* by providing a model for testing the effects of various foods, exercise, and other lifestyle aspects on biomarkers for health."

  "text" : "Paul Dittel (14 January 1907 in Mittweida, Saxony – 1976?) was a German historian and Anglicist who was also an Obersturmbannführer in the Schutzstaffel (SS). He played a central role in the Nazi German policy of confiscating libraries and literary collections from occupied countries. Within the SS, Dittel was affiliated with the Sicherheitsdienst (SD) intelligence service and he was chief of that body's museum, library and research department. In late 1939 he was one of a number of Ahnenerbe members selected by Wolfram Sievers to travel to Poland in order to raid its museums and collections. In 1943, Dittel succeeded Franz Six as chief of the SS-Reichssicherheitshauptamt (RSHA) office, Amt VII, the \"written records\" section which had responsibility for ideological research. In this role his activities soon came to focus on the topic of Freemasonry and he was involved in the looting of collections, devoted to this topic. Dittel oversaw the publication of a number of anti-Masonic books from the collection of material that he had gathered as well as the establishment of a Masonic Library. He was also responsible for the development of a special collection of books on occult topics such as theosophy and astrology, a project that had been devised by Ernst Kaltenbrunner and in which Heinrich Himmler took a keen interest. Dittel was imprisoned after World War II. Following his release he moved to Mönchengladbach where he was employed as a clerk until at least 1973."

He was one of the ushers of the Privy Chamber to King Charles I, and was knighted on 27 May 1633 when he was of Hutton Bonville York. In April 1640, Neile was elected Member of Parliament for Ripon in the Short Parliament. During the interregnum he was living at White Waltham, Berkshire where he studied astronomy and built telescopes. Sir Christopher Wren was using Neile's telescope at White Waltham in 1655 and in 1658 Neile gave a 35-foot telescope to Gresham College. He was one of the twelve founder members of the Royal Society and in 1661 the Society \"desired him to continue his employment of the artificer for making glasses for perspectives\". In 1673 Neile was elected MP for Newark together with his business partner Henry Savile. However his election was unpopular and contested and he was unable to take his seat properly in the next four years. The election was eventually declared void on 21 Mar 1677. Neile died at the age of 73. Neile married Elizabeth Clarke, daughter of Gabriel Clarke, D.D., Archdeacon of Durham. Their son William Neile was a mathematician and astronomer.."

He represented Fermanagh and South Tyrone (Assembly constituency) and was the Sinn Féin party spokesperson on Enterprise, Trade and Investment. Flanagan also served as a councillor on Fermanagh District Council following his co-option in 2009  and re-election in May 2011. He resigned from his council seat in August 2011 in line with Sinn Féin party policy on dual mandates and was subsequently replaced on the council by Stephen Huggett. Flanagan lives in Tempo, is originally from Garrison, County Fermanagh and was educated at St Michael's College, Enniskillen. He is a former retail manager and small-business owner. In references to the Seán Quinn case, Flanagan stated that, \"It is not up to the media, to politicians or to anyone else to determine the outcome of this case. That decision needs to be made by a judge and the sooner that happens and a clear outcome is decided, the better it will be for all concerned.\" In December 2015 it was announced that Mr Flanagan would not run in the May 2016 Assembly elections when he failed to gain the necessary support from delegates at a Fermanagh South Tyrone constituency selection convention. In January 2016, at a re-convened selection convention, he was put back on the party ticket at the expense of Michelle Gildernew. In February 2016 Sinn Féin decided to run an extra candidate in Fermanagh South Tyrone and the extremely popular Gildernew was added back on to party ticket. During the Assembly election on the 5th of May 2016 Mr Flanagan polled 3,449 first preference votes, lost his seat and was the first Sinn Féin candidate to be eliminated from the count."

  "text" : "Pyrros Spyromilios (Greek: Πύρρος Σπυρομήλιος; 1913 – 31 March 1962) was a Greek officer of the Greek Navy in World War II and later director of the Greek Radio Orchestra. Spyromilios was born in Himara, southern Albania (a region that Greeks refer to as Northern Epirus). He became an officer in the Hellenic Navy and participated in the Greco-Italian War (1940-1941). During his service he was positioned in the Northern Epirus Naval Command. In December 1940, he participated in the military operations that led to the capture of his home town by the Greek military. In another occasion, on March 1, 1941, in charge of a small patrol boat he repelled an attack by an Italian submarine that approached the shores of Himara, in the Panormos sector. After the end the war Spyromilios became director of the Greek Radio Orchestra. During this era a number of new music celebrities emerged in Greece with his support, like Nana Mouskouri. Spyromilios also agreed to allow the composer Mikis Theodorakis to use his ensemble, along with the popular bouzouki instrumentalist, Manolis Chiotis, and singer Grigoris Bithikotsis, in a premier performance of the Epitaphios, a melodized poetic cycle by the leftist poet Yiannis Ritsos, in Greek radio. This was a rare move at a time when, following the Greek Civil War, the Left and any works associated with it was suppressed."

D. from the University of Chicago (1985), and is currently a Professor of History and Co-director of Latin American Studies at the State University of New York at Stony Brook. He has been both a Rhodes Scholar and a Guggenheim Fellow. Along with the historian Herman Lebovics and the sociologist Daniel Levy, he is a coordinator of the Stony Brook Initiative for Historical Social Sciences. Gootenberg is the author of Imagining Development: Economic Ideas in Peru's \"Fictitious Prosperity\" of Guano, 1840-1880, which has been described as having \"had a profound impact on Peruvian historiography\". Referring to himself as a \"recovering economic historian\", Gootenberg has centered his scholastic energies on contributing to the crafting of a \"new history of drugs\" and has published several works in the field. He has also written Andean Cocaine: The Making of a Global Drug, which Gootenberg describes as \"cocaine's first full-length biography\". It has received mostly positive reviews, with the historian Arnold Bauer calling it Gootenberg's \"most accomplished book to date\" and the St. John's University scholar Elaine Carey stating that the book should be considered \"an essential work for any scholar or student of the histories of narcotics, Latin America, and economics.\""

  "text" : "For the Canadian ice hockey player, see Peter Slater (ice hockey). Peter Slater (born 1932) is an Australian ornithologist, wildlife artist and photographer. Slater grew up in Western Australia and moved to North Queensland in 1966. He began photographing birds from an early age, has won numerous awards in international exhibitions, and was made an Artiste of the Fédération Internationale de l'Art Photographique in 1964. He has produced several natural history books and field guides, often in collaboration with his wife Pat or his son Raoul. In her 2001 book Feather and Brush, a historical survey of Australian bird painting, Penny Olsen says: ”Naturalist, artist and writer, Peter Slater could be said to be the most modern equivalent of Neville Cayley Jr. Both have published enormously successful field guides to Australian birds, reprinted many times, and both have written on and illustrated butterflies.””To knowledgeable critics, Slater is now a more accomplished artist than his predecessor. However, this was not yet evident in his early artwork, which includes the plates in Australian Flycatchers and their Allies, among the first of a new wave of bird identification books. More than any of his contemporaries, he has developed his art in the public eye, chronicled in the many publications containing his work. His rare but successful exhibitions serve to mark stages in his progress and delineate the beginning of new phases in his work. Since 1964, he has illustrated with photographs or paintings, an impressive 30 or more books on birds, and reckons to have painted every Australian bird no less than four times.”"

Along with his two brothers, Filippo and Nicolao, and his cousins, Giovanni Foscari and Filocalo Gradenigo, who controlled the other half of the island, he opposed the Byzantines when they attacked the island in 1276 under Licario. Licario however persisted, and gradually took the island, as one by one the Latin princes fell in battle. The main fortress of Kastro continued to resist, and after Paolo was killed in 1277, his widow, a daughter of Angelo Sanudo, continued to defend it until she was eventually forced to surrender it in 1278."

  "text" : "Peter Fritz Willi Lustig (27 October 1937 – 23 February 2016) was a German television presenter and author of children's books who has become especially well known as leading actor in the weekly children's television show Löwenzahn (which he hosted from 1979 up until 2006; during its first year the show was still called Pusteblume). He also appeared on the shows Mittendrin (1987–95) and Gordos Reise ans Ende der Welt (2007). Lustig originally qualified as a broadcast engineer and an electronics engineer before becoming a television host and actor. Working for American Forces Network as a radio engineer in 1963, he was responsible for the recording of US President John F. Kennedy's speech Ich bin ein Berliner held in Berlin. He often ended an episode of the show Löwenzahn (where he explained various phenomena of science and nature to children) with a proposal to turn off the TV now. His show persona always wore characteristic blue dungarees and lived in a wooden building site cabin in fictitious Bärstadt (\"Beartown\"). Since the 1980s Lustig was a follower of Osho. Lustig's books include the science comic Wie funktioniert ein Auto? (\"How cars work?\") (1983) on the working principles of automobiles, the two-volume handicraft book Peter Lustigs Bastelbuch (\"Peter Lustig's Book of Handicraft\") (1985 and 1987), and the children's cookbook Kochbuch für kleine Feinschmecker (\"Cookbook for little gourmets\") (1992). He also authored Vertonen: Der Ton zu den Bildern (\"Set to music: The Soundtrack to the Images\") (1987), a book on post-recording of soundtracks for films and slideshows, and Lieber Momme: Wunderliche Briefe (\"Beloved Momme: Strange Letters\") (1989), a book made up of letters he wrote to his young son from hospital, where Peter Lustig stayed many times throughout the 1980s due to lung cancer surgery. Lustig's second wife, British-Austrian children's author and fellow follower of Osho Elfie Donnelly, published the book Peters Flucht (\"Peter's escape\") (1986) about the 8-year-old Lustig's escape with his family from the city of Breslau (modern-day Wrocław) in 1945. He died on 23 February 2016 at the age of 78 at his home in Bohmstedt near Husum surrounded by his family. He is survived by four children and nine grandchildren."

Born in the Broadstone in Dublin, Greene came to prominence in the 1940s and gave his first live commentary on Ireland’s 1-0 defeat by Argentina at Dalymount Park in 1951. He also covered the League of Ireland for the Evening Press and covered many international events including the European Athletics Championships in Stockholm in 1956 and the 1972 Olympic Games.In a broadcasting career spanning four decades, he earned the title of 'the voice of Irish football'.He retired from RTÉ in 1985. Despite his father being a Bohs fan Greene loved The Hoops from the age of nine  and as a big Shamrock Rovers fan, he was known universally as Philip Green-and-White. Whether true or not, the story is that he reported that \"the score is 2-2, in favour of Shamrock Rovers\" in a match. He died on 15 May 2011 aged 90."

  "text" : "(For the politician, see Peter Loehr (politician).) Peter Loehr was born in 1967. After seven years of entertainment industry experience in Japan and Taiwan, Peter Loehr established Imar Film Co., Ltd., China's first independent film company, in 1995. Imar was China's first true, multi-faceted independent film company, producing, distributing and marketing all of their films entirely in-house. Loehr was selected as one of Variety's \"10 Producers to Watch\" in 1999. Loehr has produced nine feature films in Asia, including: \"Spicy Love Soup\", which swept the 1998 domestic Chinese awards; \"Shower\" (1999), which won 11 awards at nine different film festivals, including Toronto, San Sebastian, Thessaloniki, Rotterdam, Udine and Seattle, and \"Quitting\" (2001), which won awards at the Bangkok, Singapore and Stockholm Film Festivals. All five Imar produced films were among the top domestic releases in China the year they were released. In early 2002, Loehr began a new venture, Ming Productions, focusing on larger scale Asian-themed pictures for a world audience. His sixth film, \"Sunflower\" (directed by Zhang Yang, starring Sun Haiying and Joan Chen) won Best Director and Best Cinematography awards at the 2005 San Sebastian Film Festival. Loehr's seventh film, \"One Last Dance\" (Directed by Max Makowski, starring Francis Ng, Ti Lung and Harvey Keitel) attended the Sundance Film Festival in the World Dramatic Competition. In 2005, Loehr was a producer on \"Jade Warrior\", a Finnish/Dutch/Estonian Co-Production that premiered at the 2006 Toronto Film Festival and had number one opening weekends at both the Chinese and Finnish box offices. In 2007, Loehr was a producer on \"The Children of Huang Shi\", a German/Australian/Chinese Co-Production directed by Roger Spottiswoode and starring Jonathan Rhys-Myers, Radha Mitchell, Chow Yun-Fat and Michelle Yeoh. The film was released world-wide in 2008. In January 2005, Peter Loehr became Managing Director of the Creative Artists Agency (CAA) in China, China's largest and most successful literary and talent agency. During Loehr's seven-year tenure leading CAA in Asia, the agency grew from the ground up to represent over seventy artists in China, Hong Kong, Japan and Korea. In six short years, CAA was involved with four of the largest co-productions in Asian history, John Woo's \"Red Cliff\", Rob Minkoff's \"The Forbidden Kingdom\", \"Mission: Impossible III\" and the Will Smith produced \"The Karate Kid\". In 2009, CAA directors directed 5 of the top 8 films at the Chinese box office. CAA directors and actors have won countless awards, including the Golden horse for best Actor (Huang Bo) and the Golden Bear at the Berlin International Film Festival (Wang Quanan). CAA talent, including Yang Lan, Daniel Wu and Karen Mok, have served as spokespeople for many of Asia's largest brands. In April 2012, Peter Loehr joined Legendary Pictures and became CEO of its China joint venture - Legendary East, a film company focusing on big budget Sino-US Co-productions with subjects based on Chinese history, mythology, or culture. He is one of the producers of \"The Great Wall\" - directed by Zhang Yimou, starring Matt Damon, Willem Dafoe, Pedro Pascal and Andy Lau.\"The Great Wall\" is the largest ever US-China Co-Production and the largest production ever shot in China. It will be released worldwide through Universal Studios in 2016. Peter Loehr is a graduate of the Georgetown University School of Foreign Service with a major in International Politics and speaks fluent Mandarin and Japanese."

He was the younger brother of the architect Pierre-Anne Dedreux (winner of the 1815 Prix de Rome), and uncle of the painter Alfred de Dreux. He studied for some time under Guérin. His paintings, one of which, called 'Bajazet et le Berger,' is in the Museum of Bordeaux, are in the style of Greuze. He also painted, together with Géricault, a picture called 'La Baigneuse'. He died at Bellevue in 1874. His surname was Dedreux, but he was usually called Dorcy. Dedreux-Dorcy was one of the closest friends of Géricault, having met each other in the atelier of Guérin. When Géricault fell ill after a fall of his horse, he stayed with Dorcy for over a year. Dorcy afterwards was one of the few friends of Géricault present when he died on 18 January 1824. In 1824, after Géricault's death, Dedreux-Dorcy bought his masterpiece The Raft of the Medusa for 6000 francs, while the French government, bidding for the Louvre, wasn't willing to bid more than 5000 Francs. He afterwards declined an offer to resell it to an American for thrice the price he paid, and sold it one week later to the French government for the same 6000 francs, on the condition that it was to be placed in the Louvre."

  "text" : "Peter Arthur Onslow Graham (27 December 1920 – 2 March 2000) played first-class cricket for Somerset in six matches in 1948. He was born at Kurseong, Darjeeling, India and died on the island of Jersey. The son of a Darjeeling tea-planter and educated at Tonbridge School, Graham was a lower-order right-handed batsman and a right-arm bowler: his CricketArchive profile rates him as \"fast\", but the report in Wisden Cricketers' Almanack of his first first-class match in 1948 reads: \"Graham, from Burnham-on-Sea, bowled well at medium-pace\". In fact, that first game, a first-class friendly match between Glamorgan and Somerset at Rodney Parade, Newport, was Graham's most successful: he took four wickets in the match, including three for 47 in the Glamorgan first innings, and scored 33 at the end of Somerset's second innings. In five County Championship matches in the early part of the season, Graham never managed to surpass either the bowling figures or the highest score, and he took only three wickets in these games, all of them in the match against Gloucestershire, in which Gloucestershire made a total of 522 to win by an innings. He did not appear for Somerset in first-class matches after June 1948, though as late as 1953 he played a non-first-class game for the side against a Royal Air Force side that included Fred Trueman. His obituary in Wisden in 2001 states that he later became a tobacco farmer in Southern Rhodesia. Peter's older brother; Captain John Onslow Graham (8th Punjab Regiment), was killed leading a heroic charge during the Battle of Kampar during the Malaya Campaign in 1942."

  "text" : "Pierre Roussel (1723 - 7 June 1782) was a successful but somewhat pedestrian cabinetmaker (ébéniste) of Paris. He was joined in his extensive business by his two sons, Pierre-Michel (master in 1766) and Pierre le jeune (master in 1771). Roussel's stamp, with its fleur-de-lis between the P and ROUSSEL, is often seen, but such quantities of goods made by others, both new and old, passed through the shop, and so much cabinetwork from Roussel's workshop was sold and stamped by other marchands-ébénistes, that it is not easy to recognize any consistent sequence of characteristic styles, characteristic constructions, gilt-bronze mounts unique to his shop or marquetry. Consequently Roussel is often credited with a wide-ranging stylistic approach. The elder Roussel's father was a simple compagnon, a journeyman cabinetmaker working for a master ébéniste. Four of Roussel's brothers were menuisiers, working on carved seat furniture and room paneling. He married Marie-Antoinette Fontaine in 1743 and was received as a master cabinetmaker in the Paris guild, 21 August 1745. From modest beginnings, by the 1760s Roussel worked himself to the top of his profession: he was appointed a juré in 1762 and by 1780 and had held other offices in the Corporation des Menuisiers-Ébénistes. Among his grand later patrons was the Prince de Condé, who made considerable purchases for the Palais Bourbon and the Château de Chantilly between 1775 and 1780. At the time of his death, the inventory was compiled by a noted ébéniste, Jean-François Leleu and Jean-Baptiste Cochois. There were at least three workshops, a store-room (magasin) and a retail shop (boutique). A number of pieces were lacquered, and six lacquer panels and marquetry was mentioned, geometric, floral and landscape. There were also marble tops, and a stock of veneers. Roussel was able to give his four daughters dowries and marry them successfully into the solid bourgeoisie. Roussel's son Pierre-Michel established himself as a furniture dealer in fashionable rue St-Honoré. Pierre II Roussel, \"le jeune\" inherited the family shop from his mother, who had continued to run it after her husband's death, using the same stamp, but in 1792 he closed it, to deal exclusively in exotic timbers and veneers."

He attended the Pictou Academy before graduating from the Royal Military College in 1885. Upon his graduation, he took up employment with the North-West Mounted Police (NWMP) (later merged into the Royal Canadian Mounted Police). Over the 30 years he spent with the NWMP, he was stationed at many locations throughout the North-West Territories, serving as Superintendent on four separate occasions before his retirement from the force in 1915. Primrose then moved to Edmonton and accepted the position of city police magistrate, a position he would hold for 20 years. Amongst other positions, during World War I he commanded the Edmonton Reserve Battalion of the Canadian Army. Although he had never actively participated in politics, in 1936 Primrose was appointed Lieutenant Governor of Alberta, a position he held for only 167 days before he died after a long illness."

  "text" : "Philocles (Greek: Φιλοκλῆς), was an Athenian tragic poet during the 5th century BCE. Through his mother, Philopatho (Greek: Φιλοπαθώ), he had three famous uncles: Aeschylus, the famous poet, Cynaegirus, hero of the battle of Marathon, and Ameinias, hero of the battle of Salamis. Philocles is best known for winning first prize in the competition against Sophocles' Oedipus Rex. Philocles also wrote a play on the subject of Tereus, which was parodied in Aristophanes' The Birds along with Sophocles' treatment of the same subject. A scholiast has noted that Philocles' Tereus was part of his Pandionis tetralogy. An extant fragment shows that Philocles wrote a play covering the story of Hermione, Neoptolemus and Orestes, a story also addressed by Euripides in his play Andromache and by Sophocles in his Hermione. In Pholocles' version of the Hermione myth, Hermione is betrothed to Neoptolemus by her father Menelaus while she is pregnant with Orestes' child. Philocles also wrote plays entitled Oedipus and Philoctetes."

After a series of strong performances, in which during a span of 2 months he was able to defeat World No.1 Ke Jie in two consecutive international tournaments, namely the LG Cup and the Ing Cup, Park was able to reach the final of the latter, and the round of 8 in the former. Park will face Tang Wei-Xing in the final of the 2016 Ing Cup, with the first two games being played in mid-August. The first 2 games of the Ing Cup were played, with Park winning the first by resignation whilst losing the second. In both games the margin of victory was small, but Park was able to produce a comeback in the second game, with Tang lamenting that he went wrong after the midgame. Park's most recent result was the Bailing Cup, where despite his best efforts, he was not able to defeat the Chinese Tian yuan holder Chen Yaoye. During that game, both sides opened up securing territory and doing big territorial exchanges, but a slip-up by Park allowed Chen to win an important ko that ultimately led to loss of territory. Chen was then able to capitalize and win the game, thereby ending the Korean player's string of dominance in the international tournaments."

  "text" : "Plenty Horses (Tasunka) (b. 1869) was a Sicangu (Brulé) Lakota from the Rosebud Indian Reservation. On January 7, 1891, eight days after the Wounded Knee Massacre, he shot and killed Army Lieutenant Edward W. Casey, commandant of the Cheyenne Scouts (designated Troop L, Eighth Cavalry) two miles north of the Stronghold Table in the Badlands of the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in South Dakota. Plenty Horses – who was present at the Drexel Mission Fight the day after the Wounded Knee Massacre, was arrested for the murder and his case went to trial. His defense was he shot and killed Casey as an effort to redeem himself in the eyes of his people after having spent five years at the Carlisle Indian School learning the ways of the white man. He returned in time to be present on the reservation during the massacre. Five years I attended Carlisle and was educated in the ways of the white man. When I returned to my people, I was an outcast among them. I was no longer an Indian. I was not a white man. I was lonely. I shot the lieutenant so I might make a place for myself among my people. I am now one of them. I shall be hung, and the Indians will bury me as a warrior. The trial of Plenty Horses, which took place at Fort Meade near Sturgis, figured prominently into the investigation of the events surrounding the Wounded Knee Massacre specifically as to whether or not Spotted Elk's band were considered to be prisoners of war. The central argument of Plenty Horse's two lawyers George Nock and David Powers- both working pro bono, was that a state of war existed between the United States and the Lakota Nation and as such the belligerents may kill each other without threat of criminal penalty. In such case Plenty Horses should not be tried for murder. If the prosecution's argument that a state of war did not exist between the Lakota and the United States held true, his lawyers argued that the soldiers involved with the killings at Wounded Knee should also be charged with murder. It was in the governments' interest that the victims of Wounded Knee be considered as combatants who were prisoners of war who rose up in armed resistance. On May 28, 1891 George Shiras, Jr. the presiding judge in the case halted the proceedings and instructed the jury to find that a state of war did exist around the time of the killing between the Lakota and the United States and that the skirmishes between the Lakota warriors and the U.S. Army were actually battles. As Judge Shiras stated on record; \"If they were not it would be hard to justify the killings of the Indians at Wounded Knee and other places\". General Nelson Miles would state publicly that a state of war did exist at the time. He called as a witness by the defense attorneys, Captain Frank D. Baldwin a member of Mile's staff was already in the state having gone to Pierre to urge the governor to ban the sale of weapons to Indians which the legislature had failed to do. Baldwin appeared as a surprise witness at the trial. Baldwins testimony supported the main assertion of the defense; that Plenty Horses had killed Casey as the officer was spying on the Indian encampment on the Stronghold Table. As a result of the finding that a state of war did exist Plenty Horses escaped conviction for murder and was released, thereby exonerating the soldiers of the Seventh Cavalry the perpetrators of the Wounded Knee Massacre, none of whom were ever charged."

  "text" : "Patricia Preece (January 1894 – June 1966), born Ruby Vivian Preece, was an English artist associated with the Bloomsbury Group and the second wife of painter Stanley Spencer, for whom she modelled. As a teenager, in 1911, Preece was involved in the death of dramatist W. S. Gilbert. While swimming in his lake, she lost her footing and called out; the 74-year-old Gilbert dived in to assist her, dying of a heart attack. She soon adopted the name Patricia and became engaged, but her progressive views displeased her fiancé, who terminated their engagement. In 1918, Preece met her lifelong lover, Dorothy Hepworth, at the Slade School of Fine Art. After further studies in Paris, the two returned to Britain. In 1928, they moved to Cookham and befriended the artist Stanley Spencer. Spencer became obsessed with the flirtatious Preece, and he showered her with gifts. She persuaded him to divorce his first wife and to sign his house over to her. Preece married Spencer in 1937, but she did not leave Hepworth and refused to have sexual relations with Spencer. She eventually evicted Spencer from the house, and would not grant him a divorce, but continued to receive payments from him. After he was knighted in 1959, she insisted on being styled Lady Spencer and claimed a pension as his widow. Throughout their lives, the gregarious Preece exhibited and sold the shy Hepworth's paintings under her own name, causing the artist Augustus John to declare Preece one of the six greatest women artists in England. In later years, Preece traded in antiques. The Preece-Spencer relationship was dramatised in the 1996 Olivier Award-winning play Stanley."
