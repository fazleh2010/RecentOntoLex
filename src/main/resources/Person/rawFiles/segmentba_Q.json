Little is known with certainty about Qudama's life and work. He was probably born ca. 873/874, possibly at Basra, came from a Syriac Christian family and converted to Islam ca. 902–908. He held various junior administrative positions in the caliphal secretariat in Baghdad, and eventually rose to a senior post the treasury department. Various dates for his death have been supplied, ranging from 932 to 939/940 and 948. Of his several books on philosophy, history, philology, and administration, only three survive: \n*  the Kitab al-Kharaj (the Book of the Land Tax, in full form Book of the Land Tax and the Art of the Secretary), for which Qudama is chiefly known. Only the second half of the book, with four of its original eight sections, survives. It was written after 928 as a manual for administrators, and deals with the structure of the state and the army, as well with geographic details, including valuable accounts on the Caliphate's neighbours, especially the Byzantine Empire. It also included a now lost section on literary rhetoric. \n*  the Kitab al-Alfaz (Book of Words) or Jawahir al-Alfaz (Jewels of Words), a compilation of synonyms and phrases for the use of poets and orators, as well as containing an introduction on the figures of speech. \n*  the Kitab Naqd al-shi'r (Book on Poetic Criticism), an essay and guide on composing good poetry."

He was said to have gained supernatural powers gained through his skill in speaking the dharma and meditation. Through this, he is said to have saved the town of Anxi during a period of drought, bringing rain as he went from place to place. In reverence, the villagers built shrines to him and hence became a deified person in Chinese folk religion. Qingshui is also known by the following nicknames: \n* Dropping Nose Ancestor (Chinese: 落鼻祖師公; Pe̍h-ōe-jī: La̍k-phīⁿ chó͘-su-kong), known for the prominent nose featured in Qingshui's effigies \n* Black Faced Ancestor (Chinese: 烏面祖師公; Pe̍h-ōe-jī: o͘-bīn-chó͘-su-kong) Worship of Qingshui is especially popular in Taiwan, where he is worshiped by local villagers for protection and in overseas Hokkien-speaking communities. His birthday is celebrated on the sixth day of the sixth lunar month."

He joined the People's Liberation Army in 1949 and earned recognition in the campaigns that were waged to exterminate bandits. Early 1951, Qiu signed up with the Chinese Volunteer Army taking part in the Korean War. In October 1952, Qiu died as a martyr in the Korean War, and is considered by the Chinese government to be a war hero. In the struggle for Hill 391, Qiu and his squad mates crawled closer to the enemy position, using hay and twigs as natural camouflage. The UN troops used incendary bombs, dropped by airplanes, to try and smoke out the Chinese units. It is claimed Qiu got trapped in the ensuing brush fire and in order to not betray the 500 other Chinese soldiers taking part in the assault, he did not move and burned to death."
