  "text" : "Robert Koenig (born 1951) is an English sculptor, who specialises in wood sculpture and is a prominent exponent of the art of woodcarving using the traditional tools of mallet and chisel. He is known for his carved and polychromed figurative wood sculptures, which he has been creating since the early 1980s. One of the earliest polychromed figures was shown in the 'Temple' exhibition at the Shaw Theatre, London in 1988. In 1992 the artist Craigie Horsfield wrote: \"Koenig drew from the culture of carving that was rooted in the folk art of Central Europe; a naturalist depiction of the world with mythic overtones. It is no coincidence that the small renaissance of wood carving apparent in Europe should have happened in Germany; in our century the focus of the long struggle of nationalism and mystery. It was given impetus and found acceptance through the painted wood sculpture of Georg Baselitz. In the line of Kirchner's expressionist figures the wood is scarred and the heads, excessive and gestural, have pigment dragged across them. They came out of the expressionist tradition but made space effectively for other artists to be seen. The most visible of these has been Stefan Balkenhol, an artist making naturalistic painted figures acknowledging a tradition of Central European village carving. It is against this background that Robert Koenig works.\" (from the catalogue \"Robert Koenig sculpture\")"

  "text" : "Robert Balmer (1787–1844), was a minister of the United Associate Synod of the Secession Church. Balmer was born at Ormiston Mains, in the parish of Eckford, Roxburghshire on 22 November 1787. He evinced considerable abilities and a disposition towards the Christian ministry. He entered the University of Edinburgh in 1802, and in 1806 the Theological Hall at Selkirk, under Dr. Lawson, a professor of divinity in the United Secession Church. In 1812 he received license as a preacher from the Presbytery of Edinburgh, and in 1814 was ordained minister in Berwick-upon-Tweed, where he remained till his death. In 1834 he became a professor of pastoral theology at the Secession church, and later a professor of systematic theology. In 1840 he received a D.D. from the University of Glasgow. Balmer had great influence in the denomination to which he belonged. When certain discussions arose among his brethren on some Calvinistic doctrines, he supported the less stringent views. At a meeting held in Edinburgh in 1843, to commemorate the bicentennial of the Westminster Assembly, he delivered a speech in favour of Christian union, which attracted the attention of Thomas Chalmers and others, and led to important measures being taken by John Henderson of Park for promoting that cause. Balmer did not publish much during his life but two volumes of Lectures and Discourses were posthumously published in 1845, a full year after he passed on 1 July 1844."

Educated in Hong Kong and the United States, she has taught at several major American universities, including Brown University. Chow is currently Anne Firor Scott Professor of Literature at Duke University. Chow's writing challenges assumptions in many different scholarly conversations including those about literature, film, visual media, sexuality and gender, postcolonialism, ethnicity, and cross-cultural politics. In the introduction to a collection of Rey Chow's essays, Chow scholar Paul Bowman emphasizes the direct heritage of Chow's work in the works of Louis Althusser, Michel Foucault, Edward Said, Jacques Derrida, Gayatri Spivak, Stuart Hall, Laura Mulvey, and Teresa de Lauretis. Building on the work of these theorists, Chow explores the problematic assumptions about non-Western cultures and ethnic minorities within the context of academic discourse as well as in more public discourses about ethnic and cultural identity. Many of her explorations of critical concepts have been recognized by scholars as important, including her ideas about visualism, the ethnic subject and cultural translation."

  "text" : "Raymond Allen Davis is a former United States Army soldier, private security firm employee, and contractor with the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). On January 27, 2011, Davis killed two reportedly armed men in Lahore, Punjab, Pakistan. Although the U.S. government contended that he was protected by diplomatic immunity because of his employment with the U.S. Consulate in Lahore, Davis was jailed and criminally charged by Pakistani authorities with double murder and the illegal possession of a firearm. A car coming to aid Davis killed a third Pakistani man, Ibadur Rahman, in a \"hit and run\" while speeding on the wrong side of the road. On March 16, 2011, Davis was released after the families of the two killed men were paid $2.4 million in diyya (a form of monetary compensation or blood money). Judges then acquitted him on all charges and Davis immediately departed Pakistan. The incident led to a diplomatic furor and deterioration in Pakistan–United States relations. A major focus of the incident was the U.S.'s assertion that Davis was protected under the principle of diplomatic immunity due to his role as an \"administrative and technical official\" attached to the Lahore consulate. The U.S. government claimed that Davis was protected under the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations and demanded he be released from custody immediately. President Barack Obama asked Pakistan not to prosecute Davis and recognize him as a diplomat, stating, \"There's a broader principle at stake that I think we have to uphold.\" The Pakistani officials disputed the claim of immunity from a murder charge, asserting that Davis was involved in clandestine operations, and questioned the scope of his activities in Pakistan. The Pakistani Foreign Office stated that \"this matter is sub judice [\"under adjudication\"] in a court of law and the legal process should be respected.\" Pakistani Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi stated that, according to official records and experts in the Foreign Office, Davis was \"not a diplomat and cannot be given blanket diplomatic immunity\"; Qureshi's stand on the issue allegedly led to him losing the Foreign Affairs ministerial post. The incident led to widespread protests in Pakistan demanding action against Davis. Almost a month after the incident, U.S. officials revealed Davis was a contractor for the CIA after it was reported in The Guardian. According to The Telegraph, he was acting CIA Station Chief in Pakistan. An unnamed official with the Pakistani intelligence agency Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) stated that Davis had contacts in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas along the Afghanistan border and knew both the men he shot. He said the ISI is investigating the possibility that the encounter on the streets of Lahore stemmed from a meeting or from threats to Davis. Some media outlets have suggested, according to anonymous sources, that data retrieved from Davis's phones and GPS device indicated that he had been to Islamabad, Lahore, Peshawar and some tribal areas of the country, areas that have been the subject of U.S. drone attacks. These attacks were interrupted for several weeks after Davis's arrest before resuming on March 18, 2011, in an attack at Datta Khel."

  "text" : "Robert Couteau (born 1956 in Brooklyn, NY) is an Americanastrocartographer best known for his theory of the Least-AspectedPlanet (LAP) in astrocartography and astrology. The concept of the LAP, first advanced in 1998, proposes that the horoscopeplanet that receives the fewest astrological aspects is thekeynote or focal point of the birth chart. In the analysis ofplanetary lines in astrocartography, the rising, setting, Imum coeli, and midheaven lines of the LAP represent geographic areasof greatest potential for the native. The theory was initiallydeveloped by analyzing accurately recorded horoscopes of historicalpersonalities, and it has also been successfully applied, in mundane astrology, to the study of historical events. The complete text of this research was made available as a free e-bookin 1998, and manyexcerpts of it were later published in online and print journals overthe next decade. The essay The Role of the Least-Aspected Planet inAstrocartography: New Insights Into the Spirit of Place, whichintroduced these ideas, was featured in Matrix Software’s Learn Astrology archive (originally, Astro-Talk magazine) laterthat same year.In 2000, the Jim Lewis Slayden Foundation, devoted to the legacy ofthe founder of modern astrocartography, Jim Lewis, hosted anessay by Couteau titled The Least-Aspected Planet inAstro*Carto*Graphy: A Metaphor of the Soul, which discusses howthe LAP symbolizes the “overall archetypal pattern” residing “at thevery core of the chart” and cites Carl Jung as a primaryinfluence. TheUniversity Centre for Astrological Research (C.U.R.A.) in Paris published two more essays on the subject: Couteau’s An Introduction to Astrocartography (with an introduction in French by Patrice Guinard) and Beyond the Trigger Effect: A Personal Note on the ‘Numinous Consciousness.’The latter work explores the writing of Rudolf Otto, the scholarof comparative religion who first coined the term numinous,and it attempts to link Otto’s ideas on religious experience totraditional astrology and Least-Aspected Planets. This essay was later translated into Spanish by Gerry Hache and published in C.U.R.A. as Mas allá del efecto disparador. In 2002 the Finnish astrology magazine Astro Logos published Couteau’s lengthy essay Transcendental Mercury as a two-part feature in its summer and fall print editions (translated as “Transsendenttinen Merkurius”).The essay describes the various ways that Mercury may manifest aseither a Least- or Most-Aspected Planet in astrology andastrocartography. In 1999 Anima Mundi magazine hosted his essay“Transcendental Mars,” which explores the same dynamics in the Martian complex and lists various celebrity personalities with a Least-Aspected Mars whose life and work was epitomized by the symbolism and astrocartographic proximity of that planet. In 2004 excerpts from Couteau’s work on Least- and Most-Aspected Pluto were published in the book The Astrology of Film: The Interface of Movies, Myth, and Archetype, by Bill Streett and Jeffrey Kishner. In October 2006 The Mountain Astrologer featured a review of the complete text of The Role of the Least-Aspected Planet in Astrocartography. Planetary Symbolism in Astrocartography and Transcendental Astrology.Other print magazines that have featured Couteau’s work on the subjectinclude Astrolore: The Astrology Magazine, published in Poole, England, and the Celtic Astrologer: The Journal of the Dublin Astrological Centre. In 1999, in the summer and fall editions of Aspects magazine, astrologer Claudia Dikinis published a two-part article titled “Election 2000” that cited Couteau’s statistical findings, namely that Least-Aspected Saturn appears with higher frequency than other horoscope planets in the birth charts of American presidents. Although the professional astrology community’s response to the theory of the Least-Aspected Planet has been overwhelmingly positive, several astrologers have disagreed over methods of applying the theory in astrology and astrocartography."

The following year, in 1973, he was elected for the Social Democratic and Labour Party to Derry City Council, and was immediately elected as first nationalist mayor of the city since 1923. He held his seat on Derry City Council at the 1977 election, but did not stand in 1981. Later in life, McClean wrote about Bloody Sunday and the events leading up to it, holding a special interest in the long-term effects of the use of CS Gas. He died in 2011, and was survived by his wife Sheila, son Sean, and daughter Sheila."

After Henry's landing at Milford Haven in early August 1485, his army was bolstered by contingents from across Wales. One of these contingents was that of Rhys, who had travelled from north Wales to meet Henry, probably near Welshpool; certainly, Rhys had joined him by the time Henry captured Shrewsbury in mid-August. On 22 August, Rhys and his men participated in the battle at Bosworth. At the height of the fighting, Henry's standard bearer, Sir William Brandon, was killed; according to later testimony, Rhys picked up the standard, hoisting it high until the conclusion of the battle. He lived at Plas Iolyn in north Wales, and his effigy, along with that of his wife, Lowri, can be seen in the parish church of Ysbyty Ifan, Denbighshire. His son, Robert ap Rhys, was chaplain to Cardinal Wolsey and his grandson, Ellis Price, was MP for Merioneth."

Dr. Dexter was awarded many honors as a teacher and scientist, including the Outstanding Faculty Member award and the President’s Medal. He received the prestigious President's Medal from Kent State on May 15, 1977 based on his singular leadership in the field of biology in Ohio, prolific scholarship and unswerving devotion to Kent State University.

  "text" : "Robert Boury (born December 28, 1946) is an American composer and pianist. Boury was part of the revival of Ragtime led by William Albright and William Bolcom in the late sixties. Boury has composed many types of instrumental works and in a variety of medias and genres, such as solo/duet piano works, art songs, both comic opera/opera seria, choral works, ragtime works, orchestral works and elect acoustic pieces. As a professor of music and resident composer at the University of Arkansas at Little Rock, he is an active musician and a devoted teacher, who hosts a \"Songwriters Showcase\" for his students each semester. Boury's commissioned work, To Dream Again, which contains four songs from Shakespeare's The Tempest, was given its first performance in the summer of 2003 at the 100th Anniversary Convention of Sigma Alpha Iota, in Dearborn, Michigan. In 2004, his university commissioned him to create a work in honor of the opening of the Clinton Library in Little Rock and he continues to volunteer in schools and churches to share his music. Boury has composed music for his university's alma mater, as well as for opera and theater events, produced at University of Arkansas at Little Rock. His many art songs and chamber music pieces have been performed regionally, nationally and internationally as well. Robert Boury is known for his beautiful art songs and cycles. His renowned songs are well thought of and are sung by students and professionals nationwide. Boury also composed many solo piano pieces along with piano ensemble works such as two pianos, four hands pieces (Two Beguines, op. 4, Duelin' Pianos, op. 10d) and one piano, eight hands piece (The Mice Will Play, op. 19). Like many composers before him, Boury was influenced by different eras and musical styles. Having been born in the middle of the 20th century, he was exposed to a variety of compositional styles. His works combine elements of tonal and non-tonal classical music with a touch of American music and non-Western music. For instance, some of his piano works exhibit a Romantic style while others consist of Rag style influences. His recent piano works show his interest in a Medieval compositional technique called soggetto cavato (Italian: Carved-out subject), which is an innovation that Renaissance composer Josquin des Prez used. In this technique, the vowels of words are transformed into a musical theme by matching them to the corresponding pitches. The details of his compositional styles will be discussed later in this document, along with his piano solo pieces. His solo piano pieces are also listed in chronological order. Despite the fact that Boury is a well-established composer, it appears that no written analyses of his piano works exist. His piano works indicate that Boury has absorbed a number of influences, for instance J. S. Bach, Chopin, Debussy, Ross Lee Finney. The variety of styles in Boury's piano pieces reveal music history itself in that they connect to the music of an earlier age, such as Renaissance and Baroque eras to Romantic, and Contemporary eras. This characteristic is crucial to the understanding and appreciation of Boury's style/compositions, and is in need of research and analysis for those who desire to explore Boury's piano works."

  "text" : "Richard Green (1803–1863), was a shipowner and philanthropist. Green was born at Blackwall in December 1803, the son of George Green, by his first marriage with Miss Perry, daughter of a shipbuilder of repute at Blackwall. On the introduction of the elder Green into Perry's business, he became a shipowner, and fitted out a number of vessels in the whaling trade, thus laying the foundation of the house which at the time of his son's admission to the firm was styled Green, Wigram, & Green. Increasing their operations the partners took advantage of the East India Company's charter to build East Indiamen, for which they became well known. On the death of the head of the firm and the consequent dissolution of partnership, Richard Green continued the business in conjunction with his then surviving brother Henry. Green increased the number of vessels until the discovery of gold in Australia, when he and his brother launched a large number of ships for this voyage also. To this service they were about to add another to China, one vessel having made the voyage just before Green's death, and a second being then near completion. Green devoted much care to the improvement of the mercantile marine. The establishment of the Sailors' Home was one of his earliest efforts. In connection with it he provided a course of instruction in navigation for officers and men. He was the principal supporter of schools at Poplar, at which two thousand children were taught and partly clothed. To the Merchant Seamen's Orphan Asylum, the Dreadnought Hospital, the Poplar Hospital, and many other charities he was a great benefactor. Green was affectionately regarded in East London. He warmly interested himself in the naval reserve, and was chairman of the committee and a chief mover in the employment of the Thames Marine Officers' Training Ship. His favourite saying was that 'he had no time to hesitate,' and he was noteworthy for his unfailing promptitude, quick decision, clear judgment, and great business acumen. He died near Regent's Park on 17 Jan. 1863, and his funeral at Trinity Chapel, Poplar (founded by his father), was attended by an immense concourse. Green left by his will a large number of charitable bequests, including a free gift of the building and a perpetual endowment of his Sailors' Home at Poplar."

  "text" : "Richard Imison (31 October 1936 – 9 February 1993) was Script Editor for BBC Radio Drama from 1963 to 1991. In the thirty years that Imison worked for BBC Radio Drama it was the largest patron of original creative dramatic writing in Britain. In his role as Script Editor no other single individual therefore had as much influence in either the discovery of new talent or the encouragement of established writers such as Edward Albee, Ludmilla Petrushevskaya, Alexander Gelman, Harold Pinter and Samuel Beckett in the production of drama for this genre. Richard Imison was key in setting up The Giles Cooper Awards in 1977, together with Geoffrey Strachan of the publishers Methuen. These lasted until the year after his death and were the premier celebration of dramatic writing for radio. They were named after the radio dramatist Giles Cooper whose work first appeared on BBC radio in 1949. After his death in 1993 the Society of Authors established the Richard Imison Award in recognition of Imison's enduring influence on the development of high quality dramatic writing."

  "text" : "Ralph Keyes (1945 - ) is an author and lecturer who has written 16 books including Is There Life After High School?, which was adapted as a musical that opened on Broadway in 1982 and is still produced by theater groups across the United States. His 1995 book The Courage to Write has become a standard work among aspiring writers. Keyes’s books have dealt with topics in popular culture such as risk-taking, time pressure, loneliness, honesty, and human height. More recently he has turned to language: researching quotations, words, and expressions.“Nice Guys Finish Seventh” and The Quote Verifier explore the actual sources of familiar quotations. I Love It When You Talk Retro is about common words and phrases that are based on past events. His most recent book is Euphemania: Our Love Affair with Euphemisms. (The British edition is titled Unmentionables: From Family Jewels to Friendly Fire, What We Say Instead of What We Mean.) Keyes has also written numerous articles for publications ranging from GQ to Good Housekeeping. An article he co-authored in 2002 won the McKinsey Award for Best Article of the Year in The Harvard Business Review. Keyes is a frequent guest on NPR shows such as All Things Considered, Talk of the Nation, and On the Media; and has appeared on The Tonight Show, 20/20, and The Oprah Winfrey Show on television. He also speaks to professional, corporate and educational groups. After graduating from Antioch College in 1967, Keyes did graduate work at the London School of Economics and Political Science. From 1968 to 1970 he worked as an assistant to Bill Moyers, then the publisher of Long Island’s Newsday. For the following decade he was a Fellow of the Center for Studies of the Person in La Jolla, California, then did freelance writing and speaking in the Philadelphia area. Keyes now lives with his wife Muriel in Yellow Springs, Ohio where he continues to write books, give lectures, and serve as a trustee of the Antioch Writers’ Workshop."

  "text" : "Roberto Marcolongo (August 28, 1862 in Rome – May 16, 1943 in Rome) was an Italian mathematician, known for his research in vector calculus and theoretical physics. He graduated in 1886, and later he was an assistant of Valentino Cerruti in Rome. In 1895 he became professor of rational mechanics at the University of Messina. In 1908 he moved to the University of Naples, where he remained until retirement in 1935. He worked on vector calculus together with Cesare Burali-Forti, which was then known as \"Italian notation\". In 1906 he wrote an early work which used the four-dimensional formalism to account for relativistic invariance under Lorentz transformations. In 1921 he published to Messina one of the first treaties on the special relativity and general, where he used the absolute differential calculus without coordinates, developed with Burali-Forti, as opposed to the absolute differential calculus with coordinates of Tullio Levi-Civita and Gregorio Ricci-Curbastro. He was a member of the Accademia dei Lincei and other Italian academies."

At the 2010 Chicago Marathon, he broke his previous world record for athletes with lower-limb amputations, with a time of 2:42:52. Whitehead was unable to compete in the marathon at London 2012 as there was no category for leg amputees, and was refused permission by the IPC to compete against upper-body amputees and so had to turn to sprinting to compete at the 2012 Paralympics, where he won the gold medal in the 200m T42 Athletics event with a world record time of 24.38 seconds. His earlier career was a swimming teacher at Clifton Leisure Centre in Nottingham. He is a former ice sledge hockey player, and competed for the GB team at the 2006 Winter Paralympics in Turin. Whitehead was appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 2013 New Year Honours for services to athletics. Whitehead was appointed the first-ever patron of Sarcoma UK, the bone- and soft-tissue cancer charity, on 28 January 2013 Richard is also a patron of Gedling Sports Partnership, a charity that promotes sport and Physical Education in the borough of Gedling. His name was added to the Nottingham City Transport bus service \"Pathfinder 100\" on 18 September 2012; the bus links his home village of Lowdham with Southwell and Nottingham. On 21 April 2013 he competed in the London Marathon coming in 23rd place with a time of 3:15:53.

The islands top organist of more than 40 years Dr. John George Fletcher (D.Mus., F.R.C.O. (C.H.M.), A.D.C.M., F.T.C.L., L.R.A.M., A.R.C.M., L.R.S.M.) planned a very special programme with his choir for all the services which were officiated by the cathedral’s Dean and Chapter, with arrangements by then Precentor, Reverend Michael Clarke included ushers from the six main Anglican churches of St. Mary’s, St. Paul’s, St. Peter’s, Holy Trinity, St. Matthias, as well as St. Michael’s. His brother Rev. Dr. Henderson L. Brome of the St. Cyprian's Episcopal Church, Boston (Roxbury), MA was invited to speak. Regarded as a highly auspicious occasion, all the services themselves were broadcast and recorded by the islands local television network Caribbean Broadcasting Corporation. He began his first episcopate the following Sunday evening with an appeal for unity among Christian churches on the island. In the sermon he said the credibility of the church had been hurt by \"disunity and rivalry\" among the various denominations. \"Instead of merely coming together once a year to pray for unity, we must demonstrate unity”, referring to the annual observance of Christian unity week, he called for dialogue among congregations of the various churches to discover what they had in common, saying \"such communication and consultation will enable us to dispel ignorance and to remove the misconceptions which we hold of one another.\" The new chief pastor advocated that Christians in the diocese adopt a more activist role in the society. The 16 page sermon called \"Developing a Society on the Foundation of the Family\" was published in 1994 by Caribbean Development Bank. Brome retired as Bishop, to spend more time with his wife and four children, on January 2000 at which time the position of Bishop was taken up by John Holder. Since 2004 Brome has been attached to St. James Parish Church, Barbados as assistant to the Rector. Celebrating the fiftieth anniversary of his ordination to the diaconate on 21st December 2011, when he also published his first book \"Preaching In and Out of Season\", a compilation of sermons covering the various church seasons as well as special occasions in the church and community and difficult subjects."

Starting from 2010 he is an associate professor at McGill University. In addition he is extraordinarius professor at the University of Vienna. Seiringer made substantial progress in the mathematical theory of quantum gases and particularly Bose–Einstein condensate (BEC). He partly proved the existence of BEC for interacting boson gases in the Gross–Pitaevskii limit in collaboration with Elliott Lieb. They proved also superfluidity in this limit and derived the Gross–Pitaevskii equation in the special case of BEC in rotating containers. In 2009 Seiringer received the Henri Poincaré Prize."

William Turner, then fellow of Pembroke, says that Hutton was his servant there. He was probably Turner's scholar as well as servant, but does not appear to have taken any degree. During the reign of Mary he went abroad to escape persecution. Some time in Elizabeth's reign he was made rector of Little Braxted in Essex, and on 9 April 1560 became rector of Wickham Bishops in the same county. These preferments, together with the vicarage of Catterick in Yorkshire, he held until his death, which took place in 1568. Hutton published The Sum of Diuinitie drawen out of the Holy Scripture …, London, 1548, a translation from Jonannes Spangenberg's Margarita Theologica, for which his patron Turner wrote the preface. The book was popular, and new editions appeared in 1560, 1561, 1567, and 1568. An edition of the Margarita in the original appeared in London in 1566."

  "text" : "Printmaker Rosemary Kilbourn (born April 3, 1931, Toronto, Canada) Kilbourn graduated from Toronto's Ontario College of Art in 1953, then studied wood engraving in London, England. Upon returning to Ontario, she was commissioned to paint a mural for the new dining hall at University of Western Ontario. Along with commissioned portraits, her early works included illustrating, with wood engravings, two books by brother William Kilbourn, The Firebrand (1956); The Elements Combined (1960) and Farley Mowat's, The Desperate People (1959). In addition to her book size wood engravings, Kilbourn used larger than normal wood blocks to engrave both landscape and figure compositions for individual prints (1960s to 1980s). In the late Sixties Kilbourn began to create stained glass commissions for churches, including windows for St. Thomas's Anglican Church, Toronto where she illustrated one of T.S. Eliot's poems from the Four Quartets. Other windows include those in St. Bartholomew's Anglican Church in Ottawa.; St. Timothy's Anglican Church, Toronto; St. Michael and All Angels Anglican Church, Toronto; St. James' Cathedral Church, Toronto and Trinity Anglican Church, Ottawa, among others. Kilbourn has lived and worked in an old schoolhouse in the Albion Hills since 1957, and has taught at the Artists' Workshop in Toronto, Central Technical High School, and McMaster University . In 1976 she illustrated Florence Wyles' collection of poems Shadow of the Year published by Aliquando Press. Recently, with Anne Corkett, she selected poems by Richard Outram to accompany illustrations by Thoreau MacDonald, a work commissioned by the Arts and Letters Club in Toronto: South of North: Images of Canada by Richard Outram with drawings by Thoreau MacDonald (2007). In 2012 The Porcupine's Quill published Out of the Wood, a collection of eighty reproductions of wood engravings by Kilbourn, done over a period of fifty years, accompanied by short, elegiac fragments of text that elucidate her unique and influential aesthetic. Some of the reproductions fold out into a double spread; 'Out of the Wood' also includes a full size reproduction of The Obedience of Noah, which gives an example of the large scale of some of Kilbourn's work. In 1977 she was elected to the Royal Canadian Academy of Arts, and to England's Society of Wood Engravers in 2001. She also figures in Havergal College's Hall of Distinction from 2004."

  "text" : "Richard Crawford is a British theatre director and actor. He was born in Scotland and performed in many Edinburgh festival plays and musicals where he won best breakthrough actor at the Fringe Festival at the age of 18. Having started his career in the UK as an actor, Crawford is based between London and New York where among his other performing ventures he is also a member of New York's Actors Studio after being accepted into the prestigious studio in 2011. He is also a previous student and performer at the Lee Strasberg Theatre and Film Institute. Crawford, a member of The Flying Machine (a theatre company associated with Jacques Lecoq), has directed many productions across the world, from Cirque du Soleil's Dralion, to the World Stage premier of Evanescent which he wrote, which opened to sell out audiences in New York and the comedy Filthy McNasty presents Dick Biscuit. at The Edinburgh Festival. He is also the Artistic Director of the Brooklyn Studio Lab, a collective of film and theatre artists based in Willamsburg, New York, and he is also a founding member of The New York Rebel Film Club. Crawford played the title role in The Flying Machine's Frankenstein, a Drama Desk nominated production. He also directed the world stage premier of Tim Burton's Edward Scissorhands in New York in 2010. Crawford took the Scissorshands helm in New York saying \"There's a mystique around this project\" Describing the project in an interview with the New York Times he said \"It's not Broadway, It's everyone pitching in and doing their bit for the love of the art, really.\" The production had mixed reviews, Show Business Weekly stated that \"despite Crawford's valiant attempt at engaging the audience, however, Edward Scissorhands is simply a story better told on film than on stage.\" Free Willamsburg, on the other hand, lauded the production stating \"What's cool then is you aren't just watching another re-enactment of a storyline hashed out over years of rebuttals, but a first-time staging, done by friends, not for money or fame, but led by their passion for the stage, and perhaps spooked themselves by the tragic story of the underdeveloped stranger with scissors for his hands.\" After Edward Scissorhands, Crawford opened his third play in three years, \"Diary of a Sociopathic Freakazoid\", where \"Writer/director/actor Richard Crawford and his international band of performers who comprise the Brooklyn Studio Lab are performing Diary of a Sociopathic Freakazoid in Hollywood after a successful premiere at New York's View Theatre.\" In an interview with Amy Tofte at the LA Bitter Lemon Magazine, Crawford explained the move to Hollywood, \"\"I like the theatre scene in LA because it's underground and you're doing something that isn't necessarily commercially appealing to everyone,\" Crawford says. \"The people who do it here really want to fucking do it. It reminds me of Edinburgh.\" The show described as \"a relentless exploration of the mind of a twenty something sociopath and his family and friends in Manhattan, a theatrical experience that will explore and express the mind of a sociopath using theatrical, musical and installation elements,\" was well received in LA and was nominated for best International play.Notoriously tough LA Weekly critic Bill Raden singled the show out as one of the highlights of the Hollywood theatre offerings stating, \"By the end of this unrelentingly Dostoyevskian descent into vice, self-abasement, caddishness and appalling personal betrayal, Dominic (Crawford) successfully sweeps such emotional encumbrances from his life with a fierce and frightening finality. A hilariously scathing serenade to the all-consuming self-absorption of the artistic ego.\" In 2013 Crawford returned to London and collaborated with fellow New York Strasberg Alumni Brooke Johnston and co directed Shakespeare's Hamlet with a Method influence at The Drayton Theatre in Kensington. London Theatre profiled the production \"Set in the swinging sixties with Mad Men era costumes expect the sex, drugs, and rock and roll indicative of the period,\" This controversial take on Hamlet proved highly successful with Timeout giving it a 4/5 star average stating \"I found this Hamlet to be fresh, lively and provocative.\" London Hot Hot Magazine also praised the productions risky modern take with critic Cameron Yorke stating \"Whether or not you have a passion for Hamlet, this production will have you riveted throughout the entire performance with its connection to today's lifestyle and above all is a thoroughly enjoyable, witty Show.!\" In July 2013 Crawford became the Artistic Director of Secret Theatre London and adapted and directed the London stage premier of Quentin Tarantino's \"Reservoir Dogs\". The production aimed to help charities including Shelter and Save The Wild Tigers, journalist Emma Stone stated in an interview with Crawford \"The commitment and passion Richard speaks of his production with is a breath of fresh air amidst a climate dominated by profit and recession, with the ever increasing cuts to arts funding marring the potential of original British theatre.\" The production of Reservoir Dogs split critics with Dominic Maxwell at The Times stating \"Sell the sizzle not the steak,\" and The Stage noting \"Crawford's dialogue is punchy enough but his adaptations defuse the power of Tarantino's blistering script.\" whilst Everything Theatre stated the production was \"Edgy and exciting. Tarantino is a big name to live up to, and this production does him justice.\" The production quickly sold out and gained a cult following and a five star average user rating with Time Out. 2014 saw Crawford open his play Freakazoid in May at The Proud Archivist in London as part of Secret Theatre. The production, which was site specific in an east end art gallery where you watched the artist have a personal breakdown as performance art, sold out and gained a 5 star review in Punk Art London who stated \"It was refreshing and remarkable for a production company that has previously performed Reservoir Dogs and Edward Scissorhand’s would choose to take a risk with new material. The topics hit raw nerves. Highly relatable and disturbingly spot on, the ending cuts deep.\" The raw nerves caused some audience members to walk out with Miista Magazine stating \"we can see he why Crawford’s work is compared to the likes of Bret Easton Ellis. In this case it drew more parallels with Less Than Zero but his style is as eerie and entertaining as the American writer’s.] The show was not to everyones taste with critic Anna Forsyth describing the show as \"Unsubtle. This might sound odd, but the most subtle acting and story (and my favourite parts of the show) came from trans prostitute Nadia, a six foot something wonder in heels.\" After a site specific production of Hamlet at Garricks Temple in London in July 2014, co directed by Richard Crawford and Brooke Johnston, the production, originally performed at The Drayton Theatre in London in 2013, transferred to Edinburgh for the Fringe Festival in August 2014. The production gained 4 stars from Edinburgh Spotlight who expressed \"Secret Theatre’s Hamlet boasts a very natural performance and it earns its stars for a fresh take on the play, and the energy and interactive connection of its direction and most of its performers.\"  Three Weeks also praised the production and the performances giving it 4 stars and stating \"All of the cast do an excellent job, with the actor playing Hamlet delivering a mesmerising performance. \"  Audience Fringe reviews were also very positive with Cristina Olsson writing \"One of the best Hamlet I have seen! Brilliant!\" In 2015 Crawford produced and directed the world stage premier of SE7EN (Deadly Sins) in London and Hong Kong. Both shows sold out and were met with critical acclaim and the production featured on the front cover of Time Out stating \"Secret Theatre, one the most critically-acclaimed and ground-breaking theatre companies around today, has finally come to Hong Kong to smash preconceptions surrounding stage performances.\" 2015 also saw the Crawford produced Secret Studio Lab Romeo and Juliet on a secret Island in London. The production was a huge success with On in London stating \"What I can say is that Richard Crawford, the original mastermind of ‘Secret Theatre’ whose previous sell-out productions include: Tim Burton’s Edward Scissorhands in a disused New York factory and Diary of a Sociopath in a Theatre Asylum in Hollywood, has raised the bar for immersive theatre to a whole new level with his latest offering.\" 2015 also saw the production of Evanesce, written and directed by Richard Crawford and performed in a disused police station in London. Rachael Marsh of the justice gap reviewed the production stating \"Richard Crawford, Secret Theatre’s artistic director, who wrote the original play, was inspired by the stories of innocent people exonerated after long years in prison, both here and in the US. He pulled together a fabulous cast of actors, passionate about raising awareness of the issue; some motivated by the way that the legal system had touched their own lives.‘Intense and thought-provoking’ were among the responses of the audience, and was exactly what we were trying to achieve. By bringing the experiences of those wronged by the justice system into the light, we hope to create system-wide change that will prevent others from being put through such an ordeal.\""

  "text" : "Roger Blackwell, Ph.D., is an American marketing expert, well-recognized in his field, and an international public speaker - he has lectured to executive groups on six continents. He was described in the New York Times as one of America's top speakers on business and marketing, along with Daniel Burrus and Tom Peters. He has served on the board of directors for multiple public and private companies, most prominently Max & Erma's Restaurant, Inc., Abercrombie & Fitch, and Worthington Foods. Blackwell was a long-time marketing professor at Ohio State University, and has also taught at Stanford University, Cape Town University in South Africa, and Guelph University in Canada. Prior to his retirement from Ohio State, Sales and Marketing Executives International named him Outstanding Marketing Professor in America. He is known for his pioneering model of the consumer decision-making process. Blackwell has published more than twenty-five books and research reports. His most notable publications include Consumer Behavior, 10th edition (he is a co-author), a textbook used in several languages internationally. He also wrote Brands That Rock on the interaction of rock and roll and branding strategy, From Mind to Market, which discusses transforming supply chains into demand chains, Customers Rule!, which contains suggestions and solutions for online businesses, and From the Edge of the World on global marketing strategies. He published a major report with Dr. Tom Williams, Consumer Driven Health Care, describing how to use HSAs to reduce health care costs, and has published over 100 articles in multiple scholarly and trade journals. In 1999, Worthington Foods, on whose board Blackwell served, discussed a possible merger with the Kellogg Company. During the time the merger was discussed, the stock price of Worthington dropped to half its eventual sale price and 6,000 people bought shares, including hundreds of associates of Worthington directors and employees. Two included an employee of Roger’s consulting firm and her husband, who bought additional shares in the IRA accounts. Roger and they were convicted of insider trading. Blackwell's trade nemesis, Lucas Rogers, had no influence or negotiation in regards to the Worthington trades, but had conducted sales of art pieces in Columbus and traded contact information. Blackwell made nothing on the purchases, but received a six-year prison sentence and a fine of one million dollars. Throughout this process and continuing today, Blackwell maintains his innocence, believing his policy of not commenting about board meetings was the appropriate response to people who asked about the company. Today, Blackwell is a frequent speaker to corporate seminars and university classes on behavioral economics, marketing and ethics."

Digby's younger brother John perched himself on a ladder at the door of the chamber which the speaker, William Lenthall took as an act of disrespect and insubordination and told him to take his place, and not to sit upon the ladder as if he were going to be hanged. King complained that the Speaker had transgressed his duty in using so disgraceful a speech to so noble a gentleman and after some turmoil obtained a conditional apology. King supported King Charles and was disabled from sitting in parliament on 27 February 1643. King died between 1643 and 1645."

  "text" : "Robert Farrier (1796–1879) was an English painter. Farrier was born in 1796 in Chelsea, London, and lived in that area throughout his life. He was first placed for instruction under an engraver, but subsequently began to earn a living by painting portraits in miniature, and became a student at the Royal Academy. He first exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1818, sending some miniature portraits, and in 1819 exhibited the first of a series of pictures in a slightly humorous vein, depicting domestic subjects, and especially scenes from schoolboy life. These were popular, and a number of them were engraved. The first which attracted notice was The Schoolboy—\"He whistled loud to keep his courage up\" (Blair's Grave)— exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1824, and engraved by J. Romney. Romney also engraved Sunday Morning—The Toilet (R.A. 1825), Sunday Evening and The Declaration. Other pictures by Farrier were engraved by Mrs. W. H. Simmons (The Loiterer), C. Rolls (Hesitation), E. Portbury (Minnie O'Donnell's Toilet), William Ward Jr. (The Mischievous Boy), Thomas Fairland (lithograph, The Village Champion) and William Fairland (lithograph, The Culprit Detected). Farrier occasionally travelled, but continued to live in Chelsea, where he died in 1879. One of his pictures, The Parting, was presented after his death to the South Kensington Museum. His sister, Charlotte Farrier, was also an artist: she had a large practice as a miniature-painter and was a frequent exhibitor at the Royal Academy."

Educated at Owen's School, Islington and Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, for many years he was secretary of the National Federation of Housing Societies He joined the Labour Party soon after the First World War. At the 1945 general election he was the party's candidate for the south London suburban constituency of Norwood. The constituency had been held comfortably by the Conservatives since its creation in 1885, but a landslide in favour of Labour saw Chamberlain elected member of parliament, overturning a Conservative majority of 12,456 to win the seat by 2,023 votes. He was appointed parliamentary private secretary to the Minister of Town and Country Planning, Lewis Silkin. Chamberlain was regarded as a \"maverick\" member on the left wing fringe of the Parliamentary Labour Party. He was disciplined after voting against the signing of the North Atlantic Treaty in 1949. He also controversially accepted an invitation to visit Francoist Spain, returning with favourable reports on the régime. He narrowly avoided de-selection prior to the 1950 general election. When the election was held he was unseated, with the Conservatives regaining the seat. In 1971 he resigned from the Labour Party over its support for trade unions whose only purpose he claimed was the \"continual forcing up of wage rates, regardless of their less fortunate brothers and sisters and equally regardless of the public interest.\""

  "text" : "Robert J. Weilbacher (born 1948?) is a Micronesian politician and former Governor of Kosrae state. Weilbacher served as the Governor of Kosrae from February 2007 until January 2011. Governor Robert J. Weilbacher and Lt. Governor William Tosie were sworn into office on February 23, 2007. Their public inauguration was held on March 13, 2007, with Micronesian President Joseph Urusemal in attendance. Weilbacher inherited a poor economy and massive public debt left by the administration of outgoing Kosrae Governor Rensley A. Sigrah. The Kosrae state government was barely able to make payroll due to financial mismanagement when Weilbacher took office. On March 8, 2007, just days after taking office as governor, Weilbacher traveled to the Micronesian capital of Palikir to request nearly $3 million in financial aid to \"make payroll and meet basic services\" for the remainder of the financial year. Weilbacher spearheaded government reforms saying in a 2007 interview, \"I want us to change how we operate. Change the way we think about government.\" Governor Weilbacher did not seek a second term in office in the 2009 gubernatorial election. His successor, Governor Lyndon Jackson, thanked Weilbacher for reforming Kosrae's government and economy during his inaugural address in January 2011."

  "text" : "Rudolf Kaiser (10 September 1922 – 11 September 1991) was a designer of gliders who worked for Alexander Schleicher GmbH & Co. The designs of Rudolf Kaiser have proven themselves for over 50 years all over the world. His designs for Schleichers can be recognised by the K in the ASK designation. The designs that he did on his own account have the designation Ka. He was born in Coburg, Germany, and graduated in house construction in 1952. However at the same time he took up gliding. He built a small single seater, the Ka 1 at his home in 1952 to perfect his design skills. (He used it to get his 'Silver C' gliding badge.) His next glider, the two-seat Ka 2, was created for Alexander Schleicher, the sailplane manufacturer in Poppenhausen. Rudolf Kaiser also worked for Egon Scheibe designing the Ka 5 \"Zugvogel\" which was the best performing production sailplane in the world at the time. To get his Gold C, he again built a sailplane for himself; the Ka 6. It won the OSTIV prize for the best new design in 1958. After Schleicher put it into production, it became the most popular Standard Class sailplane, winning two World Gliding Championships (1960 and 1963). 1368 Ka 6's were built and many are still flying. Kaiser then designed three more classic gliders: \n*  Schleicher K7 two-seat trainer (550 built)  \n*  Schleicher ASK 13 two-seat trainer (645 built) \n*  Schleicher K 8. The K 8 was a single seater with similar characteristics to the two-seaters and so it is still a popular glider for early solo pilots who had trained on Kaiser's two seaters. 1212 K 8 were built. Further designs followed: the Schleicher ASK 18 single seater and two motorgliders, the ASK 14 and ASK 16. He then designed two glass fibre gliders the two-seat Schleicher ASK 21 trainer, which first flew in 1978, and the single-seat Schleicher ASK 23 which filled the role of the K 8. The ASK 23 first flew in 1983. When the certification process of the ASK 23 was complete Rudolf Kaiser retired at the age of 61."

  "text" : "Rudolf von Beckerath (19 February 1907 – 22 November 1976) was a German master organ builder. He was born in Munich, but grew up in Hamburg, where his parents moved the year he was born. He initially pursued an interest in mechanical engineering. After encountering the quality organ building in northern German instruments, particularly that of master builder Arp Schnitger his interest shifted. He trained as a cabinet maker at the art school in Hamburg, while studying the fundamentals of organ building theory on his own. In the cellar of his parent's home, he built a small house-organ. This was heard in a radio transmission from the house and in concerts there. His training continued in France, where he moved on the recommendation of Hans Henny Jahnn. In Châtillon-sous-Bagneux, near Paris, he entered the workshop of Victor Gonzalez. North American churches with noteworthy von Beckerath organs include Trinity Lutheran Church (Cleveland, Ohio), Holy Cross Lutheran Church (Wichita, Kansas), St. Michael's Church (New York, New York), Saint Joseph's Oratory Montreal, Quebec, First Congregational Church (Columbus, Ohio), the H. Frank Bozyan Memorial Organ at Dwight Chapel, Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut, the Wacek Family Memorial Organ in St. Turibius Chapel, Pontifical College Josephinum, Columbus, Ohio, and St. Paul Cathedral (RC), Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania."

  "text" : "Rade Bulat (28 August 1920 – 25 January 2013) was a Yugoslav Partisan and communist activist. He was one of the last three living recipients of the Order of the People's Hero in Croatia. Bulat was born August 28, 1920 in Vrginmost within the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes. He attended gymnasium in Sisak, Gradiška and Zagreb. In 1936 he joined the Young Communist League of Yugoslavia and was accepted into the Communist Party of Yugoslavia in 1939. After the April War he joined the Yugoslav Partisans. In 1942 he joined the Headquarters of the People's Liberation Movement of Croatia. He led the 13th Proletarian Attack Brigade from late 1942 on. Bulat became commander of the 32nd Zagorje Division on June 6, 1944. After the war he was a representative in the Parliament of the Socialist Republic of Croatia, and was a member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Croatia. He was awarded the Order of the People's Hero on July 24, 1953, along with his wife Milka Kufrin. During the Croatian Spring in 1971, Bulat publicly called for a Serb autonomous region within SR Croatia. He published a book about the 10th Zagreb Corps in 1985. After vandalism of a memorial grave in Lasinja in 2010, Bulat called for the perpetrators to be beaten by whoever found them. In February 2011 it was revealed that Bulat had been subject of an ongoing investigation for war crimes by the Ministry of the Interior since 2007. The police investigation resulted in accusing him of ordering the killings of Croatian Home Guard war prisoners near Čazma on the night of November 28–29, 1943."

  "text" : "Ryszard Stocki (born 1960) is an organizational psychologist, educationalist and business consultant, who developed in his habilitation the first nosology of organizational pathologies. analogous to a clinical doctor’s diagnosis. in his more recent work  he offered the answer to the question of the amazing oversight  i.e. why some companies are exceptionally productive. He proposes that productivity results from total participation which is based on assuming certain anthropological foundations about human beings in organizations. His work is the continuation of the work of McGregor  and Maslow  but he finds the best expression of this anthropology in the works of Karol Wojtyła, particularly his theory of participation The work on total participation complements the work on organizational pathologies as it offers a concrete vision what \"a healthy\" organization is like. After obtaining MAs in Psychology and English language, he completed his PhD in Psychology  He is head of Managerial and Organizational Department and Associate Professor at National-Louis University Business School in Nowy Sącz, Poland. Ryszard Stocki holds that total participation may help to \"cure\" educational systems. health care, and business Stocki is a proponent of the professionalization of management in non-governmental organizations, for which he wrote the handbook “Managing the Goods.”"

  "text" : "Robert Chisholm Robertson (1861–March 1930) was a Scottish political activist. Born in Limerigg, then in Stirlingshire, Robertson started working in a coal mine at the age of eight, but after the Mines Regulation Act 1872 prohibited children working underground, he returned to school. He returned to mining aged thirteen, and through studying at night school, he and his brother both obtained mine manager's certificates. His brother later became superintendent of mines for Charles Brooke, Rajah of Sarawak, while Chisholm Robertson turned to trade unionism. In 1886, he was elected as the first secretary of the Forth and Clyde Valley Miners' Association, serving until 1896, and also President of the Scottish Miners' National Association. He was on the first executive of the Miners Federation of Great Britain, founded in 1889, while in 1894, he was the founding secretary of the Scottish Miners' Federation. Robertson co-authored an influential labour programme with Keir Hardie in the first issue of The Miner, used in his Mid Lanarkshire by-election campaign, but he fell out with Hardie two years later, accusing him of neglecting mining issues at the expense of supporting seamen. Chisholm Robertson was also active on Glasgow Trades Council, and was the secretary of the Scottish United Trades Councils Labour Party. He stood for the party in Stirlingshire at the 1892 general election, but was not elected, taking only 663 votes. The following year, he was the party's delegate to the founding conference of the Independent Labour Party, and he was elected to the new organisation's first National Administrative Council. In the mid-1890s, Robert Smillie successfully challenged him for the secretaryship of the local Miners' Association, prompting Robertson to emigrate to Australia. Robertson returned from Australia and started a business in Glasgow, using his spare time to write in support of Christian fundamentalism and arguing that trade unions should avoid all potentially political issues. Even after his retirement, he continued to write letters to newspapers attacking Smillie."

  "text" : "Robert Jackson Hanvey, born at Blennerhasset, Cumbria, on 16 August 1899, was an English sportsman. Robert Jackson Hanvey, or Bob as he preferred, was born at Blennerhasset Cumbria on 16 August 1899. Conscripted into the Border Regiment in 1918, he took up Rugby Union and joined the newly formed Blennerhasset ‘Reds’ in the following season. Strongly built and of fine physique, his ability as a prop forward was quickly recognised. He gained the first of his forty-seven Cumberland County caps in 1919 and with a few exceptions, through injury, continued to play until 1929. He was a member of the Cumberland County team which won the English County Championship, when they defeated Kent in 1924. In 1922, he represented the North in their annual game against the South, an honour he would repeat on five further occasions. He also played in five international trial matches. In 1923, he joined Aspatria RUFC and helped them to gain two victories in the Cumberland County Cup. The year 1926, was the pinnacle of Bob’s playing career, playing in all four of the Home international series; against Wales at Cardiff, Ireland at Dublin, and Scotland and France at Twickenham. Although tipped to play for England again in 1929, he received an injury before the final trial. Contemporary reports described him as: \"A forward of the bustling type, a good tackler, with a rare turn of speed, and a man who can last the full eighty minutes.\" After he retired from the game in 1931, he became a respected referee and handled county games in his third season; and elected to the international panel of referees in 1937. As a referee he officiated at the North versus South match at Twickenham, England versus The Rest of the World, and the English Midlands versus the New Zealand All Blacks; in addition to several international trial games. He served as Cumberland and Westmorland Rugby Union County president between 1956 and 1958, and afterwards elected one of its few life members. In 1965 he became president of Aspatria RUFC a position he held until his death on 17 October 1989. Perhaps his greatest achievement came in 1971, when he addressed the Rugby Union Centenary Congress at Cambridge University. Bob enthralled the representative’s from forty-nine countries with a memorable speech entitled: - \"What the game meant to me.\" Dickie Jeeps remarked at the time. \"Bob put everyone’s thoughts into words, it was straight from the heart and extremely moving.\" Sir William Ramsay, President of the Rugby Football Union added:- We gave much thought as to whom we should invite as speaker. We thought we wanted to have a typical great man representative of Rugby Football, so we came to Aspatria and invited the president Mr Bob Hanvey to Corpus Christi College, and no-one could have spoken better.\""

Ragnall's Norse name was Røgnvaldr Guðrøðsson and he was titled rí na nInnsi meaning that he ruled over the Hebrides. It is also possible his territory included the Isle of Man. Very little is known of his life save that he was the son of Gofraid mac Arailt, who died in 989 and that Ragnall himself died in Munster in 1004 or 1005. His presence in Munster may indicate an alliance with Brian Bóruma mac Cennétig against the growing strength in the western seas of Sigurd the Stout the Earl of Orkney & Mormaer of Caithness. Sigurd was a vassal of the King of Norway who appointed a jarl called Gilli to rule over the Western Isles in 990, the year following Gofraid's death and Sigurd resumed direct control of the isles following Ragnall's death. It is therefore possible that Ragnall's rule was either only over part of the territory of the Sudreyar or was wrested back from Sigurd in the year's following his father's death, or both. Hudson (2005) contends that Echmarcach mac Ragnaill was Ragnall's son, which may make Cacht ingen Ragnaill, the queen of Donnchad mac Briain, Ragnall's daughter. Echmarcach was King of Dublin from 1036–38 and 1046–52 and the King of the Rhinns in Galloway, and may have ruled over part of the Hebrides as well."

In 1611 he was a scholar and was awarded BA in 1612 and MA in 1615. He was incorporated at Oxford University in 1615. He was described as a learned author and an excellent poet. In 1624 Goodwin was elected Member of Parliament for Ludlow and was re-elected in 1625, 1626 and 1628. He sat until 1629 when King Charles decided to rule without parliament for eleven years. In April 1640, Goodwin was re-elected MP for Ludlow in the Short Parliament and was re-elected for the Long Parliament in November 1640. He supported the King and was disabled from sitting in February 1644. Goodwin married Dorothy Long, daughter of Sir Walter Long. In 1630 he settled his property at Cowarne on his wife Dorothy. In 1646 he married a second time to Elizabeth Brabazon, daughter of Wallop Brabazon. Fourteen years after his death there was a dispute over his inheritance. In his will he left Cowarne to his brothers John and Thomas Smith. He also mentions his brother Sir Thurston Smith and the nephew of his tutor at Trinity Dr Samuel Heron. The allegation was made that he was illegitimate and that the estate at Cowarne defaulted to the crown. A marginal note states that he was legitimate and born at Ipswich."

Mikkelsen was US Champion in ski jumping in 1933 and 1935, but was also a strong skier in the new discipline of alpine skiing, competing in that sport from 1933-42. Roy Mikkelsen was born at Kongsberg in Buskerud, Norway and emigrated to the United States in 1924, settling in Chicago where he joined the Norge Ski Club which had been formed by Norwegian immigrants nearby in Fox River Grove. He competed in ski jumping at the 1932 Winter Olympics in Lake Placid, and at the 1936 Winter Olympics in Garmisch-Partenkirchen. Mikkelsen finished out of the medals in both 1932 at Lake Placid and at the 1936 games in Germany. But he was thought of so highly by the team in 1936 that he was named its captain. Mikkelsen was poised to participate in a third Olympics in 1940 but the event was cancelled because of the outbreak of World War II. During the war, he would put his ski and snow experience to good use as a member of the Army’s 10th Mountain Division, fighting from Normandy to Norway with the 99th Norwegian Battalion under General George Patton. . Mikkelsen eventually settled in Auburn, California where he was elected mayor in 1952 and competed there for the Auburn Ski Club in Soda Springs. Active in civic affairs, Mikkelsen worked with the Bid Committee that brought the 1960 Winter Olympics to Squaw Valley. He served on the Auburn City Council, including two years as mayor in 1952 and 1953. And 24 years after his last Olympic Games as a skier, Mikkelsen was the center of attention again when he lit a torch in Auburn’s Central Square to mark the coming of the Olympics to Placer County – up the newly paved Interstate 80 at Squaw Valley. He was instrumental in the Auburn Ski Club and the development of Boreal Mountain Resort. Mikkelsen died in 1967 at 60, three years after being elected to the National Ski Hall of Fame in 1964.. In Auburn, Mikkelsen Drive was named after one of the city’s most illustrious sportsmen. And at Boreal Mountain Resort, a statue of Mikkelsen has been erected outside the Western Ski Sport Museum."

  "text" : "Robert of Lauro (died 1183) was the Count of Caserta, a powerful nobleman and administrator in the Kingdom of Sicily, \"effectively the king's viceroy on the mainland\" between 1171 and his death. He was a close colleague of Count Tancred of Lecce, the future king. His influence helped his cousin Roger become Archbishop of Benevento (1179–1225). In 1168, when Count Bohemond II of Manoppello accused Count Richard of Molise of a conspiracy against the Chancellor Stephen du Perche, it was Robert who prevented the case from being settled by judicial duel when he alleged that Richard had also illegally acquired the town of Mandra and others near Troia from the crown. Robert was made the first master constable and master justiciar of the Duchy of Apulia and the Terra di Lavoro (in Latin, magister comestabulus et justitiarius Apuliae et Terra Laboris) in 1171, when a new system for governing the mainland territories of the kingdom was instituted following the restoration of royal authority in 1169 after years of unrest and open rebellion. In 1171 Robert convened a curia (court) in Capua, outside his jurisdiction, with two royal justiciars, Matthew de Venabulo and John de Valle. In 1172 King William II ordered Robert and Count Richard of Gravina with the chamberlain (camerarius) of the Terra di Lavoro to determine whether the monastery of Sora had been gifted by William's predecessor, Roger II, with the rents of four churches. In 1173 he, two royal justiciars, and a chamberlain were in Capua to adjudicate a case relating to the abbey of Santa Sofia of Benevento. In 1176 Tancred of Lecce succeeded Richard of Gravina as constable and justiciar in the same district as Robert. While Tancred generally held court at Bari, Barletta and Troia, Robert was generally at Caserta, Capua or Aversa. The equal competence of either is illustrated by Robert's advice to the monks of Casauria that they could seek justice from either him or Tancred (1182). In the autumn of 1176, Robert accompanied Richard Palmer and Alfanus of Camerota with twenty-five galleys to Saint-Gilles to take custody of Joan, daughter of Henry II of England, who was betrothed to William II. In 1182, following royal orders, Robert and Tancred of Lecce were in Aversa to pass judgement in the case of the Bishop of Marsia, who was unable to enforce his rights over the monastery of San Bartolomeo di Avezzano, which was supported by Gentilis de Palearia. The high standing of the litigants probably necessitated joint action by the justiciars. A list of those plaintiffs who required both justiciars to adjudicate during Robert's career suggests this: the Bishops of Teano and Sessa in 1171, the monaster of La Cava in 1171, 1177 and 1182, the Bishop of Venosa in 1176, the monastery of Montecassino in 1180, the Bishop of Benevento in 1180 and 1185, the Bishop of Bari in 1181, and the Bishop of Troia in 1183. While at Aversa in 1182, Robert gave orders to the chamberlain of the Principality of Salerno \"as though he was his normal superior\". Robert was succeeded after his death by Count Roger of Andria."

Lovelace was born in Hurley in Berkshire, the son of Richard Lovelace and his wife, Anne, the daughter of Richard Warde of Hurst, also in Berkshire. He was educated at Merton College, Oxford. Lovelace became a soldier and commanded a force under the Lord Lieutenant in Ireland, after which he was knighted by the Earl of Essex (Dublin, 1579). His association with the earl led to a brief period of imprisonment on charges of plotting against Queen Elizabeth I but he was released without charge. In 1627 he was created Baron Lovelace of Hurley by Charles I. Lovelace died in Hurley in 1634. He had married twice: firstly, Katherine, daughter of Sir George Gyll and widow of William Hyde of Denchworth in Berkshire (now Oxfordshire) (no children) and, secondly, Margaret, daughter and co-heir of a rich merchant, William Dodworth, with whom he had four sons and five daughters. The eldest son was his heir John Lovelace, 2nd Baron Lovelace and a daughter Elizabeth married the regicide Henry Marten. His son Francis should not be confused with the person of the same name who became the second Governor of the New York colony but who was however the grandfather of the John Lovelace who was a later Governor."

In 1970, he graduated from Brigham Young University with an M.S. degree. He was trained as a clinical audiologist and beginning in 1977 operated a hearing center in Salt Lake City, Utah. Van Wagoner wrote the books Sidney Rigdon: A Portrait of Religious Excess and Mormon Polygamy: A History. His 1994 biography of Sidney Rigdon won awards from the Mormon History Association and the John Whitmer Historical Association. Van Wagoner was a member of the board of Signature Books, and was described after his death as a \"trailblazer in Mormon studies\", having published historical articles in Utah Historical Quarterly, Dialogue: A Journal of Mormon Thought, and Sunstone. He lived in Lehi, Utah, and acted as the town's historical archivist. From the early 1980s, Van Wagoner lost his hearing due to otosclerosis; he received a cochlear implant in 2001, which partially restored his hearing.

He supported the Royalist side in the English Civil War. Harrison was the son of Richard Harrison of Hurst in Berkshire and his wife Elizabeth, daughter of Thomas Anton of Stratfield Saye in Hampshire, the Clerk of the Court of Wards and Liveries. His father died in 1587 and his mother remarried to Robert Marsh of Edmonton in Middlesex and Finchampstead in Berkshire. Harrison matriculated at St Mary Hall, Oxford on 1 July 1603 aged 19. He inherited the estates of Hurst and East Court at Finchampstead from a grand uncle Richard Warde (the son of Richard Warde Senior MP). He was knighted on 31 August 1621. In 1621 Harrison was elected Member of Parliament (MP) for Wootton Bassett. He was elected MP for Berkshire in 1624 and again in 1628 and sat until 1629 when King Charles decided to rule without parliament for eleven years. Harrison lived at his manor-house at Hurst, and was a friend of Archbishop Laud, who referred to him in his diary in 1625 and 1626 when Laud visited Sir Francis Windebank at Haines Hill in Hurst. He is said to have been created a baronet but the patent was lost. He was High Sheriff of Berkshire in 1636. In April 1640, Harrison was elected MP for Windsor in the Short Parliament. In the civil war, his son Richard fought on the Royalist side and the family suffered in the royal cause. Harrison married Frances, the daughter of George Garrard, of Dorney in Buckinghamshire, and his wife, Margaret Dacres. They had two sons and three daughters. Harrison died at the age of 72 and was buried in Hurst parish church."

  "text" : "Richard Montgomery Scammon (July 17, 1915 – April 27, 2001) was an American author, political scientist and elections scholar. He served as Director of the U.S. Bureau of the Census from 1961 to 1965. Afterwards, he worked for decades directing election analysis for NBC News. Scammon was born in Minneapolis, Minnesota, and earned a bachelor's degree in political science from the University of Minnesota in 1935. He later earned a master's degree from the University of Michigan, also in political science. Scammon enlisted in the Army during World War II, attaining the rank of captain. He served in occupied Germany after the war, rising to head the military government's office of elections and political parties. After his discharge, he served as chief of the research division in Western Europe for the U.S. Department of State from 1948 to 1955. After leaving government service, Scammon founded the Elections Research Center in 1955. Its enduring contribution was the long-running series of volumes, America Votes, which for the first time provided standard and reliable statistics for the results of major elections in all 50 states. (The biennial compilations, published by Congressional Quarterly's imprint, CQ Books, were later co-produced with Scammon associate Alice McGillivray. After Scammon closed the Center in 1995, Rhodes Cook has continued to oversee production of America Votes. Scammon also served as a consultant to NBC News in the 1960 general election, working with the RCA computers and methods to call state-by-state totals for the Presidential race. He was briefly introduced to the audience on the air on election night. In 1961, President John F. Kennedy appointed Scammon as Census Director, which he continued until 1965, during the administration of Lyndon B. Johnson. According to the Washington Post, while serving as Director of the Census, Scammon was \"a personal adviser to Presidents Kennedy and Johnson on public opinion and political trends.\" Returning to his voting research, Scammon was hired by NBC News to direct its extensive election-night coverage in November 1968. He continued his work as a consultant for NBC until 1988. In 1976 he was elected as a Fellow of the American Statistical Association. As an author, Scammon's most famous work was The Real Majority: An Extraordinary Examination of the American Electorate (1970), co-authored with Ben J. Wattenberg. The New York Times described it as \"arguing that, for the Democratic Party to survive, it needed to look beyond the economic issues that dominated the American electoral scene in the first half of the 20th century, [and] toward social issues that deeply disturbed voters in middle America.\" In Scammon's words, the typical voter was \"unyoung, unpoor and unblack.\" His blunt phrasing \"shocked many Democrats, but resonated true with others.\" In some ways, The Real Majority served as an answer to Kevin Phillips's 1969 volume, The Emerging Republican Majority. And it presaged a shift away from the politics of the New Deal, and towards a more ideological politics, especially at the presidential level, that largely benefited Republicans in 1972, 1980, 1984 and 1988. Scammon was married to Mary Allen Scammon and lived in Chevy Chase, Maryland for five decades. He died of Alzheimer's disease at a rest home in Gaithersburg."

  "text" : "Raymond Stover Fulmer, known as Ray Fulmer (born February 17, 1933), is a former actor, originally from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, best known for his role as Steve Baxter in the final season of Shirley Booth's situation comedy Hazel, which aired on CBS television from September 13, 1965, to April 11, 1966. Fulmer first began on Broadway with a role in Auntie Mame, co-starring with a number of different actresses in the lead role, including Rosalind Russell, Greer Garson, Beatrice Lillie and Eve Arden. His big acting break came in Chicago when he co-starred opposite Kathryn Crosby in the play, Sunday in New York. Crosby's husband, legendary singer Bing Crosby, gave Hollywood producers rave reviews of Fulmer's work, which led to a number of roles. Prior to Hazel, Fulmer had appeared once on film, in the role of \"Aga\" on Wild Is My Love in 1963 and four times on network television: as Holmes in the 1964 episode \"Mail Call\" of ABC's war-time drama Combat! and in three segments between November 1964 and January 1965 of NBC's The Rogues. Fulmer was thirty-two when he assumed the new role of Steve Baxter, a fictitious real estate agent and younger brother of corporation attorney George Baxter; his wife Barbara is portrayed by Lynn Borden. Hazel and Harold move into the home of Steve and Barbara Baxter while George, played by Don DeFore and his wife Dorothy, portrayed by Whitney Blake, are assigned overseas temporarily by virtue of George Baxter's work. The twenty-nine episodes in which Fulmer appears are the last of the series (after it had switched networks, moving to CBS), but Hazel had already run for 125 episodes on NBC from 1961-1965. The name \"Steve Baxter\" had never been mentioned in the previous four years of the series. Hazel could have been renewed for a sixth season with Fulmer in the cast, as it had good ratings, but Shirley Booth's health state at the time led instead to cancellation. Booth also owned her series. Fulmer's debut episode is entitled \"Who's in Charge Here?\" His last segment, indeed the final of the series, is entitled \"A Question of Ethics.\" In that final season, Bobby Buntrock remained in his role as Harold Baxter, the son of George and Dorothy, while Julia Benjamin debuted in the role of Susie Baxter, the daughter of Steve and Barbara and cousin of Harold. After the show was cancelled following his only season, Fulmer made no attempt to hide his criticism of the show's scripts, saying that they were repetitious, full of grammatical errors and sloppy writing, and had plot flaws. However, he had nothing but praise for Booth, saying, \"What's amazing is how Shirley Booth can make something out of nothing.

  "text" : "Sir Ralph Ellerker (died 1546), was an English soldier, knight and Member of Parliament. Ellerker was the eldest son of Sir Ralph Ellerker of Risby, Yorkshire, by Anne, daughter of Sir Thomas Gower of Stittenham. The elder Ellerker took part in the useless Spanish expedition in 1512, was an esquire of the king's body, received a salary as one of the king's spears of honour, and died in 1540. Both father and son were knighted in 1513 by the Earl of Surrey at Flodden Field. Whether it was he or his son who represented Scarborough in the parliament of 1529 is uncertain. The younger Ellerker was appointed chief steward of the lordships of Cotingham and Rise in 1522, and from that time onward frequently was on the commission of the peace for the East Riding. He was on the royal commission to treat for redress of outrages in the west marches in 1531, when he also served on a commission for the reform of the weirs and fishgarths in Yorkshire. In 1533 he was busy in the north mustering troops and fighting, and in July of that year he was one of the English commissioners who concluded a year's truce with Scotland. He was returned as knight of the shire for Yorkshire for the parliament of 1542. In that year he was also head of a commission appointed to survey the waste grounds on the border, to describe the condition of 'all castells, towers, barmekins, and fortresses,' and to advise on the best means for strengthening the defences and peopling the district. The official report of this commission is preserved among the Harleian MSS. (292, ff. 97-123). In the same year Ellerker was one of the council at Calais, and in 1544 he was marshal of the English army in Boulogne when that town was captured. He distinguished himself by taking the crest from the dauphin of France. He returned to England in January 1545-6, but in April was at Boulogne again, and died there in battle in that month. He was buried in the church of St. Mary at Boulogne. He had married Joan, daughter of John or Thomas Arden, by whom he had a son, Ralph. Ralph was High Sheriff of Yorkshire in 1529, was knighted by Henry VIII for winning an ensign in France, and was killed by the French on 1 August 1550."

Welles gave 33 years service to the navy in a variety of placements, eventually being promoted to Rear-Admiral. As an ensign he was engaged in surveys in Alaska, where he made a study of native peoples culture and language in his spare time. He served two years in the post of Special Counsel to the World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago, and was awarded by its board for research on Orinoco River Indians.A former commander of the Naval Training Center in Newport, his command of the Oklahoma was a short period of time mainly involving the command as a training ship. This was because the oil-fired boilers that she used were not able to be fueled in England, as German U-boats had drained their supply. After he gave command over to Rear Admiral Spencer K. Wood, he was appointed Director of the Office of Naval Intelligence (April 1917 – January 1919). Welles married Harriet Deen Gardner on 17 October 1908, who followed her husband's ship to Asia and later published accounts of journeys in Scribner's Magazine and the popular book Anchors Aweigh. He was entered on the Navy's Retired List on 7 December 1926, upon attaining the age of 64, and died in New York on 26 April 1932."

He began his professional songwriting career at the age of 17, when he wrote an entire album of songs for the Tacoma, Washington-based Wailers. He released two albums of his own on A&M Records, Silent Song Through the Land and U. F. O, which he co-produced with Grammy Award winning engineer Tommy Vicari. Davies's song \"It Ain't Easy\" was covered by Three Dog Night (title song on their 1970 album), Long John Baldry (as title song of his 1971 album), David Bowie (on his 1972 Ziggy Stardust album), Dave Edmunds, and Grammy Award winner Shelby Lynne, among others; his \"Long, Hard Climb\" by Helen Reddy and Maria Muldaur; \"The Man I Used to Be\" by Jerry Jeff Walker; and \"Waitin' on a Dark-Eyed Girl\" by the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band. Davies moved to Nashville, Tennessee; in 1985 where he wrote for Cedarwood Publishing and later for Warner/Chappell Music. Although not a professional actor, he played the lead role in the George Jones video Cold Hard Truth in 1999. Davies died of a heart attack at his home in Nashville on October 30, 2003. In 2013 an album of his songs entitled Unsung Hero: A Tribute To The Music Of Ron Davies was released, featuring 22 well-known artists including John Prine, Dolly Parton, Vince Gill, Alison Krauss, Delbert McClinton, Crystal Gayle and Benny Golson."

In 1618, while Dhameri was still ruled by Suraj Mal, Jagat Singh was in charge of a mansabdar (Mughal army detachment) in Bengal. The rebellious and fiercely independent attitude of Suraj Mal was a source of constant annoyance to the Mughals and caused their emperor, Jahangir, to exile him to Chamba and place Jagat Singh on the gaddi'’ (throne)."

  "text" : "Richard Ferris (fl. 1580-1606) was an English adventurer. Ferris was one of the five ordinary messengers attached to Queen Elizabeth's household. A subpœna was issued for him to give evidence in a suit in the court of the Archbishop of Canterbury on 7 November 1580. In July 1606 he was still filling the office of royal messenger. Although ‘never trayned upon the water,’ he resolved in 1590 to accomplish the daring feat of rowing in an open boat from London to Bristol. He embarked in a ‘new built’ wherry on Midsummer day at Tower Wharf, with two friends, Andrew Hill and William Thomas. At Greenwich they landed, and were entertained at court. Afterwards their journey began in earnest, and although they usually anchored in safe harbours at night, and were well received by the townspeople of the southern seaports, they ran some risks, and did not reach Bristol till 3 August. The mayor and aldermen gave them a triumphal welcome. They returned to London on 8 August, and wherever they showed themselves were enthusiastically received. The exploit excited the admiration of all classes from the court downwards. On 7 August 1590—only four days after the voyage was finished—‘a ballad of Richard Fferrys cominge to Bristowe’ was ‘licensed to Edward White on 10 Aug.’ Another ballad of ‘the ioyfull entertainement of the wherry and iij wherrymen, viz., Richard Fferrys, Andrewe Hilles, and William Thomas by the maiour, aldermen, and citizens of Bristoll, 4to Augusti, 1590,’ was licensed to Henry Carre. In the same year John Wolfe printed for Edward White ‘The most dangerous and memorable Adventure of Richard Ferris.’ On the title-page appear the words, ‘Published for the sayd Richard Ferris,’ and a dedication to Sir Thomas Heneage, the queen's treasurer, follows. At the close of the tract is ‘a new sonnet’ celebrating Ferris's arrival at Bristol, by James Sargent. A copy of this rare work is in the Bodleian Library. It was reprinted in J. P. Collier's ‘ Illustrations of Early English Literature,’ vol. ii. No. 5 (1864), and in Professor Arber's ‘English Garner,’ vol. vi. Warton asserted that Ferrers was the author's correct name."

  "text" : "Robert Beake (died 22 September 1708) was an English politician who sat in the House of Commons variously between 1654 and 1679. He supported the Parliamentary cause in the English Civil War. Beake was a Presbyterian alderman and draper of Coventry, and was commissioned into the parliamentary army. In 1654, he was elected Member of Parliament for Coventry in the First Protectorate Parliament. He became mayor of Coventry in 1655 and was elected MP for Coventry in the Second Protectorate Parliament in 1656. In 1657 he wrote his diary which showed how zealous he was in his puritan duties enforcing strict Sabbatarianism and suppressing disorder. Those who travelled on Sundays were put in the stocks or the cage, and even a man whose journey was in order to be a godfather was fined. On Sundays Beake spent his time in the park, observing 'who idly walked there'. He took action to suppress the sale of unlicensed ale and visited all the unlicensed alehouses in three wards in person. He was re-elected MP for Coventry in 1659 for the Third Protectorate Parliament. In 1660, Beake was elected in the Convention Parliament However a parliamentary enquiry declared the election illegal, and in the following by-election, he lost his seat to William Jesson. Beake was elected again as MP for Coventry in 1679. He only sat for a short time, but voted for the first Exclusion Bill. Beake's diary is held in the local record office."

  "text" : "Ronnie Lazaro (born November 14, 1957) is a Gawad Urian Award-winning Filipino film and television actor, producer, casting and art director. He has received many nominations throughout his career as an actor, nine of which were for Best Supporting Actor, and two for Best Actor (Ebolusyon in 2005 and Boatman in 1984). His films received recognition not only in the Philippines but also in international film festivals such as Cannes, Berlin and Hong Kong. The short film Anino (English title: Shadow), where he played the lead, received the Palme d’Or in Cannes Film Festival in 2000. He is currently working on a saga, Heremias, with Filipino director Lav Diaz, the first part of which has been shown for exhibition in the 23rd Turin Film Festival. He has also performed in several foreign projects filmed both in the Philippines and abroad. Lazaro is also active in television and has appeared in various soap operas, such as Kamada, winner of the Dove Awards in 1997, and Anna Luna, where he was nominated for Best Supporting Actor in 1990. Lazaro was born in Negros Occidental, Philippines. His roots are in theatre: He co-directed an improvisational play entitled Pugakhang in 1979, and has toured nationwide to stage several plays including Hiblang Abo, which he co-produced. Aside from his work as a film, theatre and television actor, Lazaro has had his share of achievements behind the camera. His art direction in Manila by Night (City after Dark) won the Best Production Design Award in 1981. A self-taught photographer, he also launched in January 2005 a photo exhibit in the Museo de la Cárcel Real in Cáceres, Spain entitled Manila en las palmas de la luz (Manila in the palms of light), which ran for two months. The same exhibit was again mounted in October 2006 in Museo Perez Commendador–Leroux, coinciding with the 20th anniversary of the said museum. The Gawad Urian Awards named Lazaro Best Actor in 2009 for his portrayal of a troubled father in the movie Yanggaw (English title: Affliction). He clinched two nominations from this same award-giving body in 2012: he was nominated as Best Actor for the film Boundary, and for Best Supporting Actor for Manila Kingpin: The Asiong Salonga Story. Aside from his native Hiligaynon, Ronnie speaks Tagalog, English and a little Spanish."

  "text" : "Richard de Ferings (died 1306), was the archbishop of Dublin. Ferings was official of Canterbury, in which capacity he won the friendship of Archbishop Peckham. In 1279 he was present at the Council of Reading. In 1280 he was also for a short time official of Winchester, having been appointed by Peckham during a vacancy of the bishopric; but before long Peckham found him so indispensable that he brought him back to Canterbury, and put Adam of Hales into the post at Winchester. Next year Peckham made him Archdeacon of Canterbury, and in 1284 gave him the rectory of Tunstall, near Sittingbourne, to be held in commendam with the archdeaconry. Ferings remained archdeacon until 1299, when he was appointed by Pope Boniface VIII to the archbishopric of Dublin. The feuds of the two rival chapters had long made the elections to that see constant subjects of disputes. In 1297 William of Hothum, himself a nominee of the pope after a contested election, died soon after his consecration. Early in 1298 Christ Church elected Adam of Belsham, and St. Patrick's chose their dean, Thomas of Chadsworth, for whom the canons had previously tried to secure the archbishopric. In their hurry neither body had secured the royal licence to elect. Both were accordingly summoned to answer for the contempt, and the temporalities of Christ Church were for a time seized by King Edward. Ferings's appointment by the pope was consequently not opposed by the king. His consecration was probably abroad, as it is not noticed in the English authorities, though the date is given as 1299 in the ‘Annals of Ireland’ published with the ‘Chartulary of St. Mary's Abbey, Dublin’. It was not, however, until June 1300 that Ferings received from the crown the temporalities of his see, after a renunciation of all the words in the bull of appointment which were prejudicial to the royal authority. Ferings spent little of his time in Ireland. His conciliatory temper led him to several attempts to make peace with disappointed candidates and angry chapters. Even before his consecration he had appointed his old rival, Thomas of Chadsworth, his vicar, though he subsequently feared lest the infirmities of age made him unfit for the post, and urged the canons of St. Patrick's and Chadsworth himself to recommend a fit substitute if he were incapable. In 1300 he succeeded in persuading the canons of St. Patrick's and the monks of Christ Church to agree to a ‘final and full concord,’ which, while recognising that both churches were of metropolitical and cathedral rank, gave Christ Church, as the elder foundation, a certain honorary precedence. (The composition is printed in Mason's ‘St. Patrick's,’ App. vi.) It was perhaps to conciliate the wounded pride of St. Patrick's that he continued to make Chadsworth his vicar-general during his frequent absences abroad. In 1303 he also endowed St. Patrick's with the new prebends of Stagonil and Tipperkevin, the latter of which supported two prebendaries, and in 1304 he exempted the prebendal churches from the visitations of dean and archdeacon (Mason, St. Patrick's, App. iii. sec. vi.). In the same year he also confirmed the arrangements of his predecessors in reference to St. Patrick's (Hist. MSS. Comm. 10th Rep. pt. v. p. 217). In 1302 he resigned to Edmund Butler the manor of Hollywood, near Dublin, which had for some time been in the possession of the see. In 1303 Ferings was summoned to the English parliament in his capacity of archbishop of Dublin. There are other precedents for this somewhat unusual course. His absence from Ireland was so far recognised by the king that he gave Ferings special permission to have the revenues of his see sent to England for his support, and in letters of protection granted to him Edward speaks of his being in England ‘by the king's order’. During his archbishopric the great valuation of the Irish churches was gradually taken. He died on 17 October 1306."

The university of Edinburgh conferred on him the degree of D.D. in 1868. Blakeney died at Bridlington on 31 December 1884.

Following studies in Iceland, Rudolf Keyser was appointed as a docent at the Royal Frederick University in Christiania in 1828. He became a professor in 1831 and remained at the University until he retired in 1862. Keyser was also the first manager for the University Museum of National Antiquities. He cataloged and categorized prehistoric artifacts which had originated from excavations. He did so utilizing the chronological system developed by Christian Jürgensen Thomsen. Keyser was most commonly associated with the Theory on immigration to Norway. Keyser was a supporter of the migration theory that the Norse tribes had wandered into Norway from the north and east, a view also shared by Peter Andreas Munch, a former student of Keyser. This theory was inspired in part by the earlier works of Gerhard Schøning. The theory was commonly denounced by many Norwegian historians especially by Ludvig Kristensen Daa. Rudolf Keyser became a knight in the Order of St. Olav in 1847."

  "text" : "Richard Weston (1620 – 23 March 1681) was an English judge and politician who sat in the House of Commons in 1660. Weston was the son of Edward Weston of Hackney. He matriculated at Corpus Christi, Cambridge in 1639, and migrated to Jesus College, Cambridge on 6 September 1641, but left without taking a degree. He was admitted to Gray's Inn on 10 August 1642, and was called to the bar in 1649. In April1660, Weston was elected Member of Parliament for Weobley in the Convention Parliament. However the election declared void on 16 July 1660 on the grounds that the Sheriff had failed to send a precept and had not given due notice of the time. By 1662, Weston's arguments in court had attracted attention and were noticed by Thomas Raymond in his Reports of Cases. Weston was made Lent reader at Gray's Inn in 1676, Serjeant-at-law on 23 Oct. 1677, and became King's Serjeant on 5 February 1678. He was knighted at the same time. He was judge in several important trials between 1678 and 1680. On 7 February 1680 he was made Puisne Baron of the Exchequer. In the midsummer assizes at Kingston in 1680 he checked George Jeffreys for browbeating the other side in their examination of witnesses, and so made an implacable enemy for himself. Also in 1680, he granted a habeas corpus to Sheridan, whom the House of Commons had committed, when some of the judges held back from so doing. In December 1680 the commons voted an impeachment against him based on some expressions he used in his charge to the jury at Kingston. In speaking of the theologians Calvin and Zwinglius he said ‘Now they were amusing us with fears, and nothing would serve them but a parliament .... for my part I know no representative of the nation but the king.’ The crime with which he was charged was that his words were ‘scandalous to the reformation, and tending to raise discord.’ Parliament was dissolved before the impeachment was brought in and he died before the next parliament proceeded to the business. Weston died in Chancery Lane and was buried at Hackney on the 26 March 1681. Weston married Frances Manwood, daughter of Sir George Marwood of Little Buskby."

  "text" : "Reginald Walter Maudslay (1 September 1871 – 14 December 1934) was a British car manufacturer and founder of the Standard Motor Company. Born in Paddington, London, Maudslay was the son of Athol Edward Maudslay, \"gentleman\", and Kate, daughter of Sir Thomas Lucas, founder of a large firm of building contractors. Maudslay was educated at St David's School in Moffat, Scotland, followed by Marlborough College. After leaving school he attended the Crystal Palace School of Engineering, trained as a civil engineer under Sir John Wolfe-Barry, during which time he worked on a number of major engineering projects such as Barry Docks. Maudslay abandoned his civil engineering career in 1902 and with financial support from Wolfe-Barry moved to Coventry, where he leased a small workshop; his cousin, Cyril Maudslay, was by then managing director of the nearby Maudslay Motor Company. In 1903 Reginald Maudslay established the Standard Motor Company in larger premises in Much Park Street. Unable to use the family name to brand his vehicles, Maudslay appears to have been influenced in his adoption of the \"Standard\" marque by the Roman standard on display in the lounge of his house. In 1914 the Standard Motor Company went public, for a \"comparatively modest\" £50,000. Production was increased and soon reached 750 cars per year. Maudslay was reported to be a designer of \"considerable ability\", and reputedly invented the side-entrance car body so familiar today, but his contribution to the development of Standard after the First World War is \"difficult to assess\". He relied heavily on the engineering skills of others such as John Budge and later John Black, who by 1933 was joint managing director with Maudslay. Maudslay's enthusiasm for the export market drove the company's finances into the doldrums during the 1920s, particularly in 1927 after an anticipated large Australian order, to which most of the company's production had been diverted, failed to materialise. Maudslay married Susan Gwendolen, née Herbert, on 30 January 1908; the couple had two sons and a daughter. Little is known of his private life, but \"he acquired the reputation of a country gentleman and was fond of inspecting the shop floor wearing a deerstalker hat and matching overcoat.\" Contemporaries described him as \"a gentlemanly engineer of the old school who found it difficult to adjust his ideas to the post-1918 industry\". He died in Marylebone, London, on 14 December 1934 after a short illness."

  "text" : "Roger M. Milgrim (born March 22, 1937 in New York City) is an intellectual property lawyer, and the author of two multivolume law treatises: Milgrim on Trade Secrets (published in 1967 and updated three times per year: in 2015, in its 110th edition and comprising five volumes) and Milgrim on Licensing (published in 1990 and updated twice annually: in 2015, in its 42d update and comprising four volumes). Beginning in about 2007, these two treatises were updated by Eric E. Bensen, of the New York Bar, and Roger Milgrim. These two treatises are companions to other major intellectual property treatises in the LexisNexis IP series, which includes Chisum on Patents and Nimmer on Copyright, which are cited by the U.S. Supreme Court and other courts, including by the Court in Kimble v. Marvel Entertainment LLC, 135 S. Ct. 2401, 2408 (2015). In late 2012 Milgrim's Guide to IP Licensing was published Wolters Kluwer. Milgrim was a Root-Tilden Scholar at NYU School of Law, and won the National First Prize in the Nathan Burkan competition, awarded by the American Society of Authors, Composers & Publishers (ASCAP) for his essay on territoriality of copyright. He did graduate comparative law studies at NYU and the University of Paris School of Law as a Ford Foundation Fellow and a Fulbright Scholar. He was the first American associate in the Paris office of Baker & McKenzie, then the largest international law firm, and entered practice in New York as an associate in Nixon, Mudge, Rose, Guthrie, Alexander & Mitchell, where he served as a personal attorney to Richard Nixon, later the 37th president of the United States, and as the senior associate in the case that Mr. Nixon argued before the U.S. Supreme Court, Hill v. Time, Inc., 385 U.S. 374 (1967). That case explored the relationship of the First Amendment and the Right of Privacy. In 1968, Milgrim co-founded the firm of Milgrim Thomajan & Lee. By 1992 it had grown from two to 160 lawyers in five cities (NY, Boston, Austin (Texas), Washington, DC, and Los Angeles). In 1992 Milgrim and his firm’s intellectual property group joined the New York office of the law firm of Paul, Hastings, Janofsky & Walker, a prominent international law firm, where he served as a senior partner and held such positions as the head of the Firm’s intellectual property group and the Firm’s litigation department. In addition to practice, Milgrim taught trade secret and intellectual property law at NYU School of Law for over two decades, and has also lectured at law schools including Columbia, Fordham, Houston, Kansas, Loyola (Chicago), Stanford, Texas and Yale. He has been a principal speaker before many bar associations, including those of California, Illinois, Michigan, New York and Texas. He was one of four speakers at the Tokyo Press Club where the then new Japanese Unfair Competition Prevention Law was discussed before an audience of Japanese executives and lawyers; the other three speakers were the heads of the Japanese and U.S. patent offices and a professor from the Max Planck Institute (Japanese law is based on the German Civil Code). Milgrim was the first Dean’s Distinguished Lecturer at the Annenberg School for Communication of the University of Pennsylvania, which lecture, the following year, was given by Cass Sunstein, professor of law (then at the University of Chicago) and currently the Advisor to the White House for Information and Regulatory Affairs, advising president Barack Obama. Milgrim has also lectured to numerous legal departments, including AT&T, Eastman Kodak, Exxon, PPG, Procter & Gamble and United Technologies. In addition to an active transactional and litigation practice, he has acted as a lawyer’s lawyer, serving as an expert witness in the field of trade secret and intellectual property licensing practices in over 45 litigations and domestic and international arbitrations, having been retained by a wide variety of law firms including Baker Botts, Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft, Dechert, Gibson, Dunn, Hogan & Hartson, Keker & Van Nest, Kenyon & Kenyon, Kirkland & Ellis, Latham & Watkins, Morrison & Foerster, Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe,Quinn Emanuel, Skadden Arps, Sullivan & Cromwell, White & Case and Wilson Sonsini. Milgrim has served on the boards of directors of Technip (a Paris-based NYSE-Euronext major international engineering firm, which is one of the CAC 40 public companies, the French equivalent of the Dow Jones Industrial Average), Coflexip-Stenna, and on the boards of not for profits, such as The Fulbright Association and The Brooklyn Hospital."

  "text" : "Rotten Rita (real name Kenneth Rapp), was an influential denizen of Andy Warhol's The Factory and was sometimes referred to as \"The Mayor\" there. Although he worked by day in a fabric store, he spent many nights at the Factory bringing his unique influences to encourage others to become artists. He was an opera aficionado, and also an alleged amphetamine dealer (and user), and he touched the lives of many members of Warhol's artist collective. He was particularly close to another member, Brigid Berlin. Warhol wrote about Rita in his 1980 memoir Popism: The Warhol Sixties. In one mention, Warhol recalled asking a mutual friend, Duchess, why Rita was known as \"The Mayor\" and received the reply 'Because he screws everybody in town'. Rapp's death in late 1991 (together with that of songwriter Doc Pomus by cancer) inspired Lou Reed, another famous Factory denizen, to compose his 1992 album Magic and Loss. Reed also makes mention of Rotten Rita in the song \"Halloween Parade\" on the 1989 album New York. Writing about his first year in New York City for the New York Times, in 2000, Reed recalled returning to find his apartment trashed, and the front door 'which hung off its hinges', had a poem by Rita carved into it."

His great-grandfather, Sir Ralph Abercromby, who died in 1801, in the moment of victory, at the Battle of Alexandria, had served his country with brilliant distinction, in the West Indies (Trinidad) and at the Helder.\" He himself served in the British army from 1860 to 1869 and was stationed in Quebec. Ralph Abercromby is noted for his contributions to meteorology, his travels producing reports in Seas and skies in many latitudes such as weather and telegraphy at the US signals office. He wrote on the nomenclature of cloud formation, and figured prominently in the history of the classification system developed by Luke Howard; along with Hugo Hildebrand Hildebrandsson (1838-1920) he developed the system laid out by Howard. He attained the rank of Lieutenant in the 60th Rifles. Abercromby died on 21 June 1897 in Sydney, Australia."

  "text" : "Rodolphe Bresdin was a French draughtsman and engraver, born in Le Fresne-sur-Loire on 12 August 1822, who died in Sèvres on 11 January 1885. His fantastic works, full of strange details, particularly attracted Charles Baudelaire, Théophile Gautier, Joris-Karl Huysmans, Robert de Montesquiou and André Breton. Odilon Redon was his pupil. Bresdin influenced contemporary artists like Jacques Moreau, George Rubel, Jean-Pierre Velly, and Philippe Mohlitz. Bresdin's life story and his art are both extraordinary and fascinating. He was one of the finest and most original exponents of the art of print-making in the nineteenth century and his name ranks alongside those of Whistler, Doré and Meryon in achievement and influence. Huysmans described in his beautifully written, arresting novel, 'Against Nature' (alternative translation, 'Against the Grain') how his aesthete hero, Des Esseintes, 'in search of the rarest perfumes of visual splendours', has just savoured the prints of Jan Luyken, 'an old Dutch engraver almost unknown in France' : \"In the adjoining room, the vestibule, a larger apartment panelled with cedar wood the colour of a cigar box, were ranged in rows other engravings and drawings equally extraordinary. Bresdin's 'Comedy of Death' was one, where an impossible landscape bristling with trees, coppices and thickets taking the shape of demons and phantoms, swarming with birds having rat's heads and tails of vegetables, from a soil littered with human bones, vertebrae, ribs and skulls, spring willows, knotted and gnarled, surmounted by skeletons tossing their arms in unison and chanting a hymn of victory, while a Christ flies away to a sky dappled with little clouds; a hermit sits pondering, his head between his hands, in the recesses of a grotto; a beggar dies, worn out with privations, exhausted with hunger, stretched on his back, his feet extended towards a stagnant pool.\" Another was 'the Good Samaritan' by the same artist, an immense pen and ink drawing lithographed, a wild entanglement of palms, service trees, oaks, growing all together in defiance of seasons and climates, an outburst of virgin forest, crammed with apes, owls and screech owls, cumbered with old stumps shapeless as roots of coral, a magic wood, pierced by a clearing dimly revealing far away, beyond a camel and the group of the Samaritan and the men who fell by the wayside, a river and behind it again a fairy-like city climbing to the horizon line, rising to meet a strange looking sky, dotted with birds, woolly with rolling clouds, swelling as it were, with bales of vapour. You would have thought it the work of an early Italian master or a half-developed Albert Dürer, composed under the influence of opium.' ('Against the Grain', New York: Dover, 1971, p.59) Huysmans' description, although brilliantly conveying the mystique of Bresdin's work, does not fully do justice to the profundity of it. He only refers to two works, whereas Bresdin produced one hundred and forty etchings, twenty lithographs and a number of pen and ink drawings difficult to estimate. Bresdin was, in part, a product of the Breton countryside with its sagacious, bardic folklore traditions, later beloved of Gauguin and his circle, and in part a refugee from the Paris Bohemia of Henri Murger with its dolorous, witty intonations. His portrayals of the household interiors of the rural poor show uncanny empathy with their inhabitants and rapport with the imaginative hinterland of their psyches. His series of the Holy Family's flight to Egypt was highly praised by Redon, who thought it Bresdin's best work, and by de Montesquiou. His depictions of nature, showing its seductive charm alongside its underlying menace are unique and some time spent with these works can change one's whole way of seeing the natural world. Bresdin's life story is as dramatic and iconic as those of Van Gogh and Gauguin. It has the ingredients of a great Hollywood epic: childhood in the Breton countryside; a family row leaving him homeless in Paris and becoming part of the bohemian milieu with Charles Beaudelaire, Henri Murger and Victor Hugo ; after the counter revolution walking 678 kilometres to Toulouse; living in the open air, workmen's and fishermen's huts; taking a wife and six children to Canada in pursuit of the dream of 'living off the land'; rescued and brought back to France by Hugo and the bohemian writers and artists; separation from the family and death in a garret room in Sevres."

  "text" : "Rudolf Arnold Nieberding (4 May 1838 – 10 October 1912) was a German jurist and politician. Nieberding was born in Konitz (modern Chojnice, Poland) to Karl Nieberding, a teacher and later director of the “Gymnasium Petrinum” in Recklinghausen. He passed his Abitur in Recklinghausen and studied law at the Universities of Breslau (modern Wrocław), Heidelberg and Berlin. Nieberding finished his studies in 1863 and, after a short period at the regional administration of Breslau, started to work at the Prussian ministry of commerce in 1866. Between 1872 and 1889 he worked at the Reich Chancellery in Berlin and became head of the first département at the Reich office of the Interior in 1889. In 1893 he was appointed Secretary of State of the Reichsjustizamt, and he remained in this position under the changing chancellorship of Leo von Caprivi, Chlodwig, Prince of Hohenlohe-Schillingsfürst, Bernhard von Bülow and Theobald von Bethmann-Hollweg until 1909. Nieberding coordinated the elaboration of a new German civil code, the Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch (BGB), the associated Commercial law (Handelsgesetzbuch) and the codes of criminal law and criminal and civil procedure; thus he was responsible for the standardisation of German law after the Unification of Germany.In his opening speech to the parliamentary debate on the BGB in 1896 Nieberding described the legal situation in Germany as a “colorful muddle, .. for so long forgotten, citizens and families have determined their own legal relationships for themselves.” In a Reichstag debate on 23 November 1907 he publicly stated that the lèse-majesté laws of Imperial Germany resulted in a “growth of a base and hostile climate of denuncation” in which “even members of the same family, indeed the best of friends, denounce each other for lèse-majesté the minute discord between them occurs,” and these laws were ”not entirely reconcilable with the general sense of justice.” Nieberding retired in 1909 and died in Berlin."

He lived in New York City and moved to Florida in the early 1950s. He died while living in Coral Gables in 1963. He authored English language books by himself but also collaborated with others. Many of these books have been used throughout the world by those who wanted to learn or improve their knowledge of grammar, usage and pronunciation, particularly American English. Although the original editions served the intended purpose of his books, several have been re-published in different countries, most with translated notations to facilitate comprehension."

He was also Stage Manager at 'His Majestys Theatre' in Melbourne where Bert Newton and Toni Lamond performed. In his later years, he formed a small group who travelled to Aged people's homes and put on performances.

In his early career, between the late 1950s and the early 1960s, Gianco played in several bands, including \"I Ribelli\", \"I Quelli\" (which would later develop into Premiata Forneria Marconi), and Celentano's Clan Celentano. He also collaborated with Luigi Tenco, Enzo Jannacci, and Gino Paoli, among others. His most renowned solo works are from the mid-1960s, when he became a declared imitator of The Beatles. In the 1970s, he began expanding his range activities, working on theatre projects and as a record producer as well as a musician."

  "text" : "(\"Theories of Truth\" redirects here. For other uses, see Truth § Major theories.) Richard Ladd Kirkham (born June 18, 1955) is an American philosopher. Among his published works are the much-cited Theories of Truth (MIT Press, 1992), \"Does the Gettier Problem Rest on a Mistake?\" Mind (1984. Vol.93, No.372), and \"On Paradoxes and a Surprise Exam\" Philosophia (1991). Kirkham graduated from Cornell College in 1977 and received his Ph.D. from the University of Notre Dame in 1983. Kirkham is probably best known for his work on analytic theories of truth. In his praised book, Theories of Truth, Kirkham describes the largely overlooked fact that the various theories of truth proposed through the centuries are really not all competitors of each other because they are often intended to answer distinct questions about truth. For example, some have been intended only to provide the extensional necessary and sufficient conditions for truth, while others have been intended to provide a definition of truth, and still others are intended only to explain the linguistic and non-linguistic purposes of statements that predicate truth or falsity. According to MIT Press, this book is their all-time best-selling work in analytic philosophy and nearly half of all English-reading professional philosophers in the world own a personal copy of the book. It has been used as a text in graduate seminars on every inhabited continent and translated into Portuguese. He is also the author of four articles in the Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Routledge, 1998)."

Rosa Elena Egipciaco was born in Moca into a family steeped in lace-making, as her mother and grandmother were noted makers of lace. She recalls starting to learn mundillo when she was three or four years old. After graduating from the University of Rio Piedras, she continued to practice mundillo and co-founded the Cultural Center of Moca. In 1986, Egipciaco moved to New York and dedicated herself to teaching lace-making through a variety of programs ranging from workshops for the International Ladies Garment Workers Union to serving as a master in the New York State Council on the Arts Folk Arts Apprenticeship Program. On September 19, 2003, Rosa Elena Egipciaco of New York City was honored for her mundillo. She is one of sixteen artists to receive National Heritage Fellowships from the National Endowment for the Arts. The fellowships are the country’s highest honor in the folk and traditional arts. The awardees, chosen their artistic excellence, authenticity, and contributions to their field, each receive a one-time award of $20,000. NY Folklore Journal"

There is some uncertainty as to whether a supposed grandson, Robert Barnham, succeeded in the baronetcy or if it became extinct on Barnham's death."

  "text" : "Professor Roger Baron, an ERISA Subrogation and Reimbursement Expert, has been teaching at the University of South Dakota School of Law since 1990. He has become a recognized advocate for the rights of ERISA participants and beneficiaries in connection with the aggressive pursuit of ERISA reimbursement (subrogation) claims which came into vogue in the 1990s. ERISA reimbursement claims are filed by ERISA plans and their insurers, seeking a return of money spent on medical claims paid as part of health insurance coverage. These claims are pursued on a “first dollar priority” basis and often consume the all or most of tort recovery secured by the ERISA participant/beneficiary, leaving the person penniless. Professor Baron is a 1976 graduate of the University of Missouri at Columbia School of Law. He practiced law in Missouri for nine years before beginning his teaching career at South Texas College of Law in 1985. He is licensed to practice law in Missouri, Texas and South Dakota. His writings on ERISA Reimbursement and subrogation have been cited in written opinions by Federal Courts in Nebraska, Illinois, New Jersey, and Washington. In addition to the subjects of Subrogation and ERISA Reimbursement, Professor Baron has also authored numerous other law review articles on the topics of Insurance, Civil Procedure and Family Law. Professor Baron’s other non-ERISA law review articles have been cited and quoted with approval by state supreme courts and appellate courts in Alabama, Arkansas, California, Michigan, Missouri, New Jersey, North Carolina, North Dakota, Puerto Rico, South Dakota, Texas, Washington, West Virginia, Wisconsin, and Wyoming. Professor Baron was named the recipient of the John Wesley Jackson Outstanding Faculty Award in 1995 and again in 2008. This is an award given to a law professor at the University of South Dakota who demonstrates excellence in teaching."

After the war, she married Charles C. Crawford and published her first book The White Moth. Her marriage ended in 1929 and by 1930, she decided to go back to school to learn more about human behavior. After speaking with Franz Boas and Ruth Benedict in the Anthropology Department at Columbia University, she decided to pursue the field, graduating with a doctorate in 1937. She wrote numerous books on Native American tribes and helped to dispel many myths about their cultures."

  "text" : "Raymond Eustace Grant Govan, CBE (known more often as R.E. Grant Govan and also as REG Govan, born December 1891, Croydon district - died January 26, 1940 in Hardwar, United Provinces)was a Delhi-based British industrialist and the first President of the Board of Control for Cricket in India. He was the Managing Director of Govan Bros. Ltd., a leading business house of the time. The company was managing agents for a number of industrial enterprises. Grant Govan was a keen pilot and the founder of Indian National Airways Ltd, an aviation company formed in 1933 under Govan Bros Ltd.  Apart from the airline, Govan Bros operated Delhi Flour Mills, set up Sugar Mills-Raza Buland at Rampura, and had a travel department, Govan Agencies (which was sold in 1947). Apart from the airline, Govan had other interests in aviation, like the Delhi Flying Club which he founded in 1928. Govan was an avid sports enthusiast. He founded the Roshanara Cricket Club in Delhi, named after the nearby tomb of Roshanara Begum, with a group of friends in 1922. The club was officially inaugurated by Marquess of Reading in December 1922. Govan had the distinction of being both the founding President of the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) in 1928, a position he held till 1933 and the Cricket Club of India (CCI) in 1933.  He, along with then BCCI secretary Anthony De Mello, was instrumental in getting the BCCI affiliated to the Imperial Cricket Conference (now International Cricket Council) in 1928. In 1931 BCCI with Govan at its helm invited the Marylebone Cricket Club to tour India for the first time, with the support of Lord Irwin, the then Viceroy of India. When he died in 1940, Dr. P. Subbaroyan, then President of the (BCCI), issued a statement which read \"In the death of Mr. Grant Govan, Indian Cricket has lost a friend ...\".  After his death, a few of his friends set up the Grant Govan Memorial Homes in Delhi. These are meant to be retirement homes for Anglo-Indians with limited means and were inaugurated by Marchioness of Linlithgow, wife of the then Viceroy of India in October 1940."

  "text" : "Russell Jeffrey (born 6 February 1966) is a former Australian rules footballer who played with St Kilda and the Brisbane Bears in the Victorian/Australian Football League (VFL/AFL). Jeffrey, a former St Mary's junior, started his VFL career at Geelong and with the exception of one night match spent all of his time in the reserves. A serious knee injury looked to have ended his league career and he left Victoria, only to be called up by St Kilda to play a game in 1987. After playing 14 games for St Kilda in 1988, Jeffrey again left the state, spending the 1989 season in New South Wales with Jerilderie. He was re-signed by St Kilda in the 1990 preseason draft, with the 23rd draft pick. Used mostly as a defender, Jeffrey had his best season in 1990, not missing a single game and averaging just under 16 disposals. Although he had represented the Northern Territory in the 1988 Adelaide Bicentennial Carnival, he played State of Origin football for Victoria in 1990. At the end of the 1991 season, Jeffrey was traded to the Brisbane Bears and on debut became the 100th footballer to play for the club. In 1992 he returned to his former club Wanderers and won the Chaney Medal when he captained them to a win in the 1992/93 Northern Territory Football League grand final. He coached Wanderers until 1997, during which time he was also coach of the territory's Teal Cup side and the league's representative team. Joining Palmerston as playing coach in 1998, he steered the club to four consecutive grand finals. He coached their 2000/01 and 2001/02 premiership sides. Jeffrey is an Indigenous Australian and represented the Indigenous All-Stars in 1994. He was the Labor candidate for the conservative seat of Brennan at the 2012 election; however, he was defeated by the incumbent Country Liberal Party MP."

  "text" : "Roy Kuhlman (1923–2007) was an American graphic designer. Roy Kuhlman was born in 1923 in Fort Worth, Texas, and raised in Glendale, California. He received a scholarship to the Chouinard Art Institute in Los Angeles and in 1946 obtained another scholarship to the Art Students League of New York, and also attended the Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture in Maine. In 1951, at age 28, he showed his portfolio to Barney Rosset, publisher of the avant-garde Grove Press. Rosset was not impressed. However, as Kuhlman was putting away his book, two pieces of abstract art that he had not intended to show fell from one of the side pockets. Kuhlman was hired to design Grove's book covers and did so until the late 1960s. Kuhlman gradually began to apply abstract art in a more graphic way, not only to imagery, but also to type. Rosset describes Kuhlman's designs as an attempt to \"go between being a purely creative act and a commercial one.\" His work was occasionally representational and conceptually based as well. Rosset saw in Kuhlman's designs the perfect counterpoint to the texts he was publishing. He also designed the original format for Evergreen Review, Grove's cultural magazine. Kuhlman also got a start in the advertising business from the famed art director Herb Lubalin at Sudler & Hennessy, and became an art director and designer for Columbia Records. Later he was hired by the public relations firm Ruder & Finn to establish an in-house art department, then joined Benton & Bowles, where he designed the award-winning Mathematics Serving Man campaign for IBM, which appeared in Time, Newsweek, and U.S. News & World Report in May 1960. IBM also commissioned him to produce 700 slides and 52 live-action and animated shorts to promote computer sales. In 1962, he joined Electra Films to work on motion graphics and title sequences. After retiring as a designer in the 1980s, he continued to make his own photographic experiments. In 1995 he was inducted into the Art Directors Club Hall of Fame."

  "text" : "Robert Freeman Asleson was a major contributor to the publishing, library and information industries. He led a number of key information companies as they evolved from print, to microfilm, to mainframe, CD-ROM and then web based databases. He brought professional management to entrepreneurial library companies, without which they might not have succeeded. Some of these organizations are now among the titans of the library industry. His connection with the information industry began in 1961 as a sales representative with the Xerox Corporation. In 1964 he became Manager of Sales Promotion at University Microfilms International (UMI) which had been acquired by Xerox in 1961. UMI was a pioneer in the field of micropublishing, and one of the most significant players in the field. In 1990 Eugene B. Power, the founder of UMI, acknowledged Asleson’s pioneering role in setting up sales and marketing for the company. In 1967, Asleson became president of UMI. The company later became ProQuest, It remains one of the largest vendors in the field with revenues in excess of $350m (2010) and more than 2 billion pages of archival materials. In 1976 Asleson left UMI to become president of R.R. Bowker, a reference-book publisher in New York. As the publisher of Books-in-Print and Serials-in-Print Bowker held a pivotal role in cataloging publishing output. This corporation now trades also under the ProQuest brand. From 1980 to 1982 he led Information Handling Services, a Colorado based vendor of business information . At that time it was close to becoming the world’s largest commercial producer of microfilm with nearly 3 million feet of material. IHS remains a major player in electronic publishing. In 1988 he became President of The Library Corporation (TLC), an Inwood, West Virginia based library automation company. In 2001 he became Chairman at Paratext, LLC. an electronic publisher of research databases in history, documents, scholarly reference and classical studies. Together with Eric Calaluca he developed a number of innovative reference products From 1988-2010 Asleson served as president of The Redalen Group. He later co-founded the Children’s Literature Comprehensive Database. He was chairman of the board of directors of the Information Industry Association (1979). He was a member of the board of the National Micrographics Association (now part of AIIM), where he received a Distinguished Service Award in 1977. He was a member of the National Advisory Board for the Library of Congress’s Center for the Book and the National Commission on Libraries and Information Science: Task Force on Public and Private Sector. He was active in the creation of major library protocols and standards, including Z39.50. He attended the White House Conference on Library and Information Services in 1979. He wrote and lectured extensively on the evolution of the information industry and in particular on the transition from micropublishing to electronic databases. Asleson died on July 22, 2010 of prostate cancer at his home in Bethesda."

  "text" : "Ronnie Robinson (March 9, 1951 – May 8, 2004) was an American basketball player. Robinson played high school basketball at Memphis Melrose High School, where one of his teammates was his future college and professional teammate, Larry Finch. Robinson played college basketball in his hometown at Memphis State University. Robinson, Finch and Larry Kenon led Memphis State to the 1973 Final Four; the Tigers lost to the undefeated, Bill Walton-led UCLA Bruins in the Finals. Affectionately nicknamed \"The Big Cat\" for his leaping ability, Robinson is one of eight University of Memphis Tigers basketball players to have his jersey number retired by the school. A 6'8\", 225 pound forward, Robinson finished his college career prior to the ABA-NBA merger and thus was selected in the fourth round of the 1973 NBA Draft by the Phoenix Suns and in the first round of the 1973 ABA Draft by the Utah Stars. Robinson opted for the American Basketball Association and began the 1973-74 season with the Stars. In January, the Memphis Tams traded Johnny Neumann to Utah for Robinson, Glen Combs, Mike Jackson and cash. With the Stars and Tams throughout the 1973-74 season, Robinson appeared in 62 games, averaging 6.4 points and 4.5 rebounds per game. Robinson spent the 1974-75 season with the Memphis Sounds. With the Sounds, Robinson appeared in only 10 games, averaging 4.0 points and 2.7 rebounds per game."

  "text" : "Ruzha Fuchs (Róża Fuchs) (1890–1942), was a Yiddish theater actress. Born in Lwów, Poland (now Lviv, Ukraine). She entered the chorus of a Polish-language theater as she didn't know much Yiddish, but through connections was taken into the Yiddish theater chorus a month later. The director, Adolf Gimpel, was favorable impressed and cast her as Yitskhok in Abraham Goldfaden's Akeydos Yitskhok (The Sacrifice of Isaac). After a few months in Lwów, she was engaged in Rumania and then Chernovets, as a soubrette - and she became der libling fun teater-oylem (the darling of the theater audiences). After three years she returned to Lwów. In 1915 she played in the Polish-language Bagatela miniature theater. In 1917 she starred in Pinsk, now Belarus. She and character actor Yakov Fuchs were the parents of the famous Polish-American actor Leo Fuchs. After divorcing Yakov she remarried to the actor Georg (Gershon) Rot. Soon after Molly Picon ended her tour in Lwów, Róża took over her roles in Yankele and Tsipke Fayer. In 1939 Nazi Germany and Soviet Russia both invaded Poland, starting World War II. The Soviet Red Army took Lwów, and a new Yiddish theater took over the Koloseum theater. Fuchs and her second husband played there. In 1941 Germany attacked Soviet Russia and took Lwów. Some members of the theater troupe, including Róża, were trapped in Równe (Rovne) and sent to the ghetto, where Róża was shot dead by Germans."

In 1660, Dowdeswell was elected Member of Parliament for Tewkesbury in the Convention Parliament. He was re-elected in 1661 as MP for Tewkesbury in the Cavalier Parliament and sat until his death in 1673.

He played for Rochester in 1962 and won the Michelsen Medal, given to each season's \"Best and Fairest\" in the Bendigo Football League. Willett, who was also a premiership player with Rochester, returned to Collingwood briefly in 1964. In his first game back he kicked six goals, against Fitzroy, but played just five more games.

  "text" : "Robert Alexander Wason (6 April 1874 – 11 May 1955) was an American writer. He was known for writing novels predominantly on a western theme, and short stories, some of them serials. Wason was born in Toledo, Ohio to Robert Alexander Wason, a merchant, and Gertrude Louise Paddock. He went to High School in Delphi, Indiana and then clerked for his father for eight years, punctuated by episodes of tramping and camping in the west. Wason served in the U. S. Army (artillery) for nine months during the Spanish American War (1898–99), and worked in a wide variety of jobs and places before settling down to a career writing, with his westerns incorporating items from his life's experiences. In addition to clerking for his father, he worked as an office boy, a grip man on the San Francisco cable cars, a miner in a Nevada mercury mine, and as a farmer in Delphi, Indiana. Over his life he lived in Ohio, Indiana, San Francisco, Detroit, Orr's Island, Maine, Temple, Arizona, Arden, Delaware, Norwalk, Connecticut, and Mountain Lakes, New Jersey. Wason married Emma Louise Brownell in Peru, Indiana in 1911. They had two sons and a daughter. He died in Mountain Lakes, New Jersey."

Thomas's grandfather Robert Thomas printed South Australian Gazette and Colonial Register in London in 1829, and The South Australian Register, the first South Australian newspaper, in 1839. He also printed the first Government Gazette, but lost that business when he ran foul of Governor Gawler. Thomas was educated at Mr. J. L. Young's' Adelaide Educational Institution, a contemporary of the Right Hon. C. C. Kingston. He took up journalism at the age of 18 and was soon chief reporter. He was admitted as a partner in the firm in 1877, and at the time of his death he was the senior proprietor of The Register. Thomas was a prominent member of the South Australian branch of the Royal Geographical Society, the Adelaide Chamber of Commerce and the Adelaide Glee Club and served a term as president of each. He was treasurer of the Old Colonists' Association, an active Freemason and a Justice of the Peace for 22 years. While in Great Britain in 1902 Thomas helped form the committee which commissioned Captain Adrian Jones to create the South African War Memorial, to be seen on the corner of King William Road and North Terrace, Adelaide, in front of Government House. On the same trip he acquired a number of paintings for the National Gallery of South Australia. He was knighted in January 1909, one of the last to be conferred by King Edward VII. Thomas died on 13 June 1910 in Ardington, North Adelaide, South Australia."

Besides singing she also produced the shows \"Funky Divas\" and “Robmariel, Muy Básico\". She began her acting career with the leading roles Carmen Jones and Serena in the famous musical “Fame”, in its Latin American Tour, under Jaime Azpilicueta’s direction, a successful Spanish director. “Fame” toured Latin America (Venezuela, Colombia, Argentina, Puerto Rico, Dominican Republic and Mexico) for two years. In musical theater, she worked with some of the most renowned producers in the D.R among which are Nuryn Sanlley, Fidel López and Amaury Sánchez. She played the role of Velma von Tussle in “Hairspray” and appeared in “Cabaret” as the main character Sally Bowles, as Mary Magdalene in “Jesus Christ Superstar,\" as Liesl Von Trapp in “The Sound of Music,” as Miss Farrell in “Annie,” and as Babette in “Beauty and the Beast”. The aforementioned roles generated wonderful articles and reviews, which highlighted Robmariel’s work. She also worked with producer Guillermo Cordero in “Fiddler on the Roof”(as Tzeitel) and was directed by María Castillo in Edward Albee’s Pulitzer Prize-winning play “Three Tall Women” produced by the American Embassy in the Dominican Republic. In 2002, she had great success producing and acting in theatre with the solo show “El Último Instante” and later on the play “Palabras Encadenadas,” both of which received great praise from the public. Subsequently, in 2003, as a result of her outstanding acting performance, Robmariel received a Casandra Award for Best Actress for her work in the solo show “El Último Instante.\" She has been nominated in the same category for three consecutive years; she was even nominated for two different plays in the same year (“Palabras Encadenadas” and “Fiddler on the Roof” in 2010; Cabaret in 2009; “Regalo de Navidad” in 2008) She was also nominated for the plays “Cárcel de Mujeres” and “El Último Instante.”She appeared in the motion picture production “Un Macho de Mujer” directed by Alfonso Rodriguez and in the German TV Serie “Auf Wiedersehen, Pet”. In her most recent project, “Casting Express” directed by Leonard Zelig, Robmariel played the character of Sonia Ibarra, and her performance led to standing ovations from the audience. This last play was presented in the First Venezuelan Theater Festival in New York City."

She started her career as an assistant to Frank Temerson, publisher for Holyoke and other loosely affiliated companies. From 1943 to 1944, she was managing editor and co-owner (with Esther Temerson) of Continental Magazines, publishers of Cat-Man Comics and Terrific Comics. In 1945 she wrote for the syndicated comic \"Hep Cats\", before taking over as publisher, business manager, and co-owner (with Marjorie May) of Orbit Publications in 1946. Orbit's titles included The Westerner (featuring Wild Bill Pecos), Love Diary, Patches, and Wanted Comics, and contributing artists included Syd Shores, Bernard Krigstein and Mort Leav. She wrote for their Western comics, as well as Love Diary and another romance comic, Love Journal (both published under the \"Our Publishing\" imprint). She was also the rare actually female writer of a romance advice column comic; most advice columnists for other romance comics were male staff members using a female pseudonym. In 1948, she also pencilled and inked crime comics for D.S. Publishing. Also in 1948, she helped found the Association of Comics Magazine Publishers in response to the rising anti-comics sentiment in the United States. They created the first Publication Code for policing the content of comics, but comics were not subject to formal review to use their seal of approval, and it was largely ignored. By 1950, the ACMP was virtually defunct, though a few publishers continued to use the seal. However, its Publication Code formed the backbone of the later Comics Code."

  "text" : "Robert William Davidson was an American sculptor. Davidson was born in Indianapolis, Indiana in 1904. He was an apprentice to his father, Oscar Davidson, also an artist. He studied sculpture at the John Herron Art Institute (now the Herron School of Art), the Art Institute of Chicago, the School of American Sculpture in New York City, and the Bavarian Fine Arts Academy in Munich, Germany. His paternal lineage is traced to the early 17th century, the beginning of the colonies. Davidson’s wife, Maryetta Mauck, was an Indiana ceramics artist and they both graduated from the John Herron Art Institute in 1926. They moved to Saratoga Springs, New York where Davidson taught art at Skidmore College from 1934 to 1972. He moved to Saratoga under the intention of creating the sculptures for the Hall of Springs yet through an unfortunate event, the man spearheading this project died, and the offer was not respected. So, Davidson never fulfilled this job, however, he followed a career in Saratoga that would entail a life of mastering the Arts of his field; he educated those wanting of the arts and refined those of whom he, through an artist's eye, deemed \"the Artists of Mankind.\" Davidson is a nationally known artist whose work is in the collections of the Indianapolis Museum of Art and the Smithsonian. He has won many awards for his works including the Art Association Prize at the Herron Art Institute in 1925, the Harry Johnson Prize from Hoosier Salon in 1930, and two first prize wins at the Indiana State Fair in 1923 and 1924. He died in Schenectady, New York in 1982. According to a Hathorn Gallery, Skidmore College Retrospective Exhibition, on February 6–27, 1972 the following accolades wereattributed to R.W. Davidson in his brochure:' \"It is with great pleasure that we present this retrospective exhibit of sculpture, drawings, paintings, and prints by Mr. Robert W. Davidson. Throughout his career as a teacher and sculptor, he has widely exhibited his work and received man honors. Yet we are particularly happy that this exhibit is one of the events in the celebration of Skidmore's 50th Anniversary celebration, for Mr. Davidson has been a very real part of the Skidmore Community for many years. We would like to take this opportunity to thank those who have willingly agreed to loan works for this exhibit; Mrs. Ivan Smith, Mr. James Benton, Mr and Mrs. Frank Eaton, Mr. R.D.McDowell, Mr. Theophile Krawiec, The Indianapolis Museum of Art, The Munson-Williams-Proctor Institute, and Weatherspoon Art Gallery, University of north Carolina at Greensboro. To Mr. David Murray and Mr. Peter Winant, Mr. Davidson's student assistants, should go special thanks for their help throughout the preparationof this exhibit.George F. KueblerDirector, Hathorn Gallery.\" \"It is altogether fitting that an exhibition of work by Robert Davidson is one of the first events of the 50th anniversary celebration of Skidmore, which in its earliest days, even before it became a full-fledged college, encouraged work in the arts and in its half century as a college has become known for its exceptional art department. Robert Davidson joined the faculty of the Skidmore Art Department in 1933. For almost 4 decades, then, for almost all of Skidmores College life, he has inspired students to work as beginning sculptors and to see the relationship of sculpture to the other visual arts which the department offers- to painting, drawing, graphics,ceramics. Indeed, in addition to teaching sculpture, he himself has been one of its effective teachers of drawing. From almost the beginning of his career his works have been added to distinguished museums and private collections, a record to which this current retrospective show gives impressive evidence.Edwin M. MoseleyProvost and Dean of Faculty\" \"I have known Bob Davidson as a colleague and friend for twenty years or more and have made certain observations about him which are a privilege to record. He is an artist whose attitude about life is reflected in his respect and concern for his fellow man; for individual thought and expression; a desire to help any and all; his belief in human integrity and dignity. Bob's images in sculpture , drawing and prints most often evolve around the human figure which he treats uniquely with wit, skill and charm as is most evident in this retrospective exhibition. I have a profound sense of gratitude to one who maintains a constant devotion to his discipline.I am sure I can speak for the many students who have shared his obvious delight in art; his knowledge of history; his respect for the present and his recognition always of the inner struggle of artists as well as the student new to materials, ideas and images.He delights us all in reminiscences of well known artists who have been his personal friends.Congratulations and thank you once again, Bob Davidson, for sharing so generously with us your contribution, your tangible personal response to life.Earl B. PardonChairman, Art Department\""

He only made three appearances with Melbourne in 1984, having been unable to play in his favoured full-back position, which had been taken up by Danny Hughes, another first year player. Unable to transfer back to West Perth as they believed Melbourne were asking for an exorbitant amount of money, Holden was instead signed by Perth. After two injury plagued seasons, Holden returned to West Perth, where he would finish his WAFL career."

For some period in the 1170s he served as Justiciar in Lothian (along with three others). He also had some part of the township of Innerwick. He seems to have held this of Walter fitz Alan. He passed this on to his younger son Vincent. His nephew Glai or Glay may have held part of Innerwick too. He died on 8 March 1185, according to the Chronicle of Melrose Robert Avenel, our novice-associate, died on the eighth day before the Ides of March. He gave to God, and to St Mary and the monks of Melrose, his land of Eskdale, as his charter testifies; may his blessed soul ever live in glory. He had entered the monastery of Melrose shortly before his death. He had three sons, Gervase, Vincent and Robert, the latter of whom became a clerk. Gervase was Robert's principal heir, and the latter also served as Justiciar of Lothian. Robert had a daughter who was a concubine of William the Lion, king of the Scots. The king and Robert Avenel's daughter had a daughter named Isabella, who was given as wife in 1183 to Robert III de Brus, son of Robert II de Brus lord of Annandale. After her husband died in 1191, she was married to the Yorkshire Anglo-Norman Robert, Baron de Ros (died 1226)."

He was elected WBSC president in May 2014, and is serving a 7-year term. Fraccari was elected as president of the International Baseball Federation in December 2009, succeeding American Harvey Schiller, and immediately set out to hold merger discussions with the International Softball Federation. He spearheaded negotiations to consolidate international baseball and softball to establish and successfully launch the World Baseball Softball Confederation in October 2012, uniting baseball and softball's global movements and streamlining the two sports' efforts to return to the Olympic Games. In February 2015, Fraccari appointed Antonio Castro, the son of former Cuban leader Fidel Castro, as WBSC Global Ambassador and Kenyon & Kenyon Washington D.C.-based attorney Edward Colbert, brother of American political satirist Stephen Colbert, as WBSC General Counsel. In less than three years since overseeing the establishment of the WBSC, Fraccari has elevated the new world ruling body to be considered among the Top 30 \"Ultimate Sports Federations\" in the world. Fraccari has expanded international baseball properties to include a new flagship world tournament, the WBSC Premier 12 Professional Baseball National Team Championship, and also the Under-12 Baseball World Cup and the Under-21 Baseball World Cup, which affect baseball's World Rankings. Under Fraccari, the world governing body for baseball also established the first-ever \"Europe\" team to compete in officially recognized international competitions, setting a historical precedent. Fraccari also serves as the current chairman of the Italian National Olympic Committee's (CONI) International Relations Exploratory Committee and is a member of the CONI Council. In May 2013, Fraccari was elected as the Secretary General of the Association of IOC Recognised International Sports Federations. Fraccari is also an advisory board member of the global sports think tank, Doha GOALS. Fraccari is fluent in English, French, Italian and Spanish."

  "text" : "Roger of San Severino (died December 1221) was the Archbishop of Benevento from 1179 until his death. He was probably a younger brother of Count William of San Severino, the most powerful lord in the Cilento and a royal justiciar. He may also have been a cousin of Count Robert of Caserta. He was a monk at Montecassino before becoming bishop at a young age. His high aristocratic lineage and monastic vows were both unusual for bishops of southern Italy at the time. He was appointed archbishop of Benevento and cardinal-priest of Sant'Eusebio by Pope Alexander III. In June 1180 Roger and five of his twenty-two suffragans and two other bishops visited Montecassino, where they issued an indulgence for one year's penance to visitors of the abbey and one year and forty days' penance to visitors on Saint Benedict's day. In 1182, when Roger dedicated the abbey church of Montevergine, he was accompanied by nine of his suffragans. In 1199 Roger's own canons brought charges against him before Pope Innocent III, who sent a cardinal and the archbishop of Naples to investigate. Among the charges was that Roger had encouraged the citizens of Benevento to destroy the castle (castellum) of a neighbouring baron with whom they were in dispute. Therefore, the canons alleged, Roger was \"a participant in, and master of, civil war\"."

Clarke died in early 1931, of tuberculosis while trying to recuperate in Switzerland. King completed the ongoing work on the windows of St. Mel’s Cathedral in Longford, and managed the studio from 1935 to 1940. He then worked independently from his own studio in Dalkey. Among his works are the stained glass windows of St. Jude's Shrine, Faversham and St. Anthony's church in Athlone. Many of his illustrations are to be found in the Capuchin Annual from 1940 onwards. Between 1933 and 1949 he designed twelve Irish postage stamps. They are: Holy Year, 1933; Constitution, 1937; St. Patrick, 1937; Davitt and Parnell, 1946; four airmail stamps, 1948/1949; G.A.A., 1934; Four Masters, 1944; Thomas Davis, 1945; James Clarence Mangan, 1949.

Perhaps his best season was 1922, when he hit .347 with 44 doubles, 14 triples and 17 home runs for the Norfolk Elk Horns and Sioux City Packers. Marr managed in at least part of 15 seasons. He skippered the Norfolk Elk Horns (1922), Springfield Midgets (1923), Fort Smith Twins (1924, 1927-1928, 1930-1932), Vicksburg Hill Billies (1925), Raleigh Capitals (1926), Joplin Miners (1933, 1935), Springfield Cardinals (1942), Lima Red Birds (1944) and Johnson City Cardinals (1945). He led the Fort Smith Twins to a league championship in 1927. Following his managerial career, Marr served as a St. Louis Cardinals scout, signing Cloyd Boyer and Ken Boyer. He was also the first scout to contact Mickey Mantle. Aside from the Cardinals, Marr scouted for the Detroit Tigers, Cleveland Indians, Kansas City Athletics, and New York Mets. In 1953, he was inducted into the Kansas Baseball Hall of Fame."

  "text" : "Richard Bethune Fripp Selwyn Payne (18 September 1885 – 1 February 1949) played first-class cricket for Somerset in one match in the 1906 season. He was born at Rangoon, now in Myanmar and died at Exmouth, Devon. In some sources, his third name is written as \"Tripp\"; in others, his last two names are hyphenated as \"Selwyn-Payne\". Selwyn Payne's only first-class cricket came in the match against a feeble Hampshire at the United Services Ground, Portsmouth in 1906; he batted at No 10 in Somerset's only innings and made 15. He was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the fourth battalion of the Somerset Light Infantry in 1907. Early in the First World War he was back in the Somerset Light Infantry in the seventh battalion, being promoted from temporary second lieutenant to temporary full lieutenant in October 1914. In November 1914 (though it was not gazetted correctly for four months), he was transferred from the Somerset Light Infantry to the Motor Machine Gun Service, which operated machine guns mounted on motorcycles. This division was transferred a year later to the bigger Machine Gun Corps and in 1916 Selwyn Payne is gazetted as a temporary captain within the Corps with seniority as a temporary lieutenant in the Somerset Light Infantry backdated retrospectively to September 1914. That appears to have been contradicted by a promotion to temporary captain within the Machine Gun Corps (Motor) backdated to March 1916 but not gazetted until 1919, when he was transferred to the Machine Gun Corps (Infantry) division. He left the army on 11 November 1919 and retained the rank of captain."

  "text" : "Rudolf Wilhelm Besier (2 July 1878 – 16 June 1942) was a Dutch-English dramatist and translator, who is best known for his play The Barretts of Wimpole Street (1930). Besier was born in Blitar, East Java (Dutch East Indies, in 1878 as the son of an English mother, Margaret Ann Collinson, and the Dutch soldier Rudolf Wilhelm Besier, who died 6 months before he was born and after whom he was named.He had some limited success early in his career in England, which began with The Virgin Goddess (1906). Then followed a series of plays, mainly dramas, but also including satires and comedies. In 1912 he collaborated with H. G. Wells to convert Wells's Kipps into a play; he also worked with Hugh Walpole on Robin's Father (1918). Secrets (1922) was written with May Edginton (1883-1957). Besier's only major success came with The Barretts of Wimpole Street (1930), based on Elizabeth Barrett and Robert Browning's courtship. After being rejected by two London producers, it premiered at the Malvern Festival of 1930, produced by Sir Barry Jackson. Besier could not interest American producers, 27 of whom rejected his play, but the actress Katharine Cornell took a personal interest in it and had it staged in Cleveland in 1931, and then in New York. It was revived and produced in many countries, and was made into two films and a musical. Rudolf Besier died in Surrey in 1942, aged 63."

  "text" : "Richard Michael Pearson (born 27 January 1972) is a former English cricketer who represented England in two Youth Test matches in 1991, and went on to play first class county cricket in England between 1992 and 1997 for Northamptonshire, Essex and Surrey. A right-arm off-break spin bowler, Pearson's career featured 98 matches across the one and four-day formats of the game, where he captured 137 wickets. Pearson, born in Batley, Yorkshire, attended Cambridge University and represented them for three matches in May and June 1991, including one match against a touring West Indies side. His ability earned him a place with England Young Cricketers for the second and third Youth Tests against a touring Youth Australia side at Chelmsford and Old Trafford cricket grounds. His performance brought him two match appearances during a one-season stint at Northamptonshire prior to moving to Essex for the 1994 and 1995 seasons. He played 22 times for Essex before moving to Surrey at the end of 1995, where he would play more regularly - with 38 games - until the end of his career in 1997."

  "text" : "Richard Kenyon Paull (born 20 March 1944) played first-class cricket for Somerset in six matches in 1963 and 1964 and for Cambridge University in seven games in 1967. He was born at Bridgwater, Somerset. Educated at Millfield School, Paull was a right-handed batsman and an infrequent leg-break bowler. He made his debut for Somerset in a single match against Cambridge University in 1963, scoring 13, and maintained this as his career average throughout his short career. As a student at Hull University over the next three years, he played only in the second half of each first-class season, and in fact appeared in first-class matches for Somerset only in 1964, when he again averaged exactly 13. His highest first-class score for Somerset was just 21 not out, made in the match against Sussex at Glastonbury in 1964. From 1965 to 1967, he played only for Somerset's second eleven in both the Second Eleven Championship and the Minor Counties Championship. Having graduated from Hull, though, he reappeared in first-class cricket for Cambridge University, where he was on a one-year postgraduate course, in 1967 and, as with his earlier career with Somerset, he again averaged just 13 with the bat, though he supplemented that with occasional bowling. In the match against Derbyshire at Ilkeston he scored 37, and this was his highest first-class score. Despite the modest record, he was awarded a Blue and in the match against a much stronger Oxford University he scored 0 and 21 as Cambridge managed to achieve a draw after being made to follow on. Though he played for Somerset's second eleven to the end of the 1967 season, he did not return to first-class cricket."

  "text" : "Robert Laurens Kelly (born March 16, 1957) is an American anthropologist who is a Professor at the University of Wyoming. As a professor, he has taught introductory Archaeology as well as upper-level courses focused in Hunter-Gathers, North American Archaeology, Lithic Analysis, and Human Behavioral Ecology. Kelly’s interest in archaeology began when he was a sophomore in high school in 1973. His first experience in fieldwork was an excavation of Gatecliff Rockshelter, a prehistoric site in central Nevada. Since then, Kelly has been involved with archaeology and has dedicated the majority of his work to the ethnology, ethnography, and archaeology of foraging peoples, which include research on lithic technology, initial colonization of the New World, evolutionary ecology of hunter-gatherers, and archaeological method and theory. He has been involved in research projects throughout the United States and in Chile, where he studied the remains of the Inca as well as coastal shell middens, and Madagascar, where in order to learn about farmer-forager society, Kelly has participated in ethnoarchaeological research. A majority of his work has been carried out in the Great Basin, but after moving to Wyoming in 1997 he has shifted his research to the rockshelters in the southwest Wyoming and the Bighorn Mountains. Outside of his research in archaeology, Bob Kelly also promotes tourism to historic and archaeological sites in Wyoming. In doing so, he has given many lectures around Wyoming and helped create a website to promote Wyoming’s heritage. The website, funded by the Wyoming Cultural Trust Fund and maintained by the University of Wyoming Department of Anthropology, acts as a directory for information about Wyoming Prehistoric and Historic Sites. Kelly also served as an Amicus Curiae in the Kennewick case.. He has served as President of the Society for American Archaeology from 2001 to 2003. He is running a major research project in Glacier National Park to examine the effects of climate change."

In addition to his time as a teacher, Morrison coached multiple sports — football, baseball, basketball, track and field and golf. At various times he was head coach in baseball, track and golf. Retiring in 1994, Morrison missed the school and returned a year later, spending much of his time there. In addition, Morrison served for several years on the Ashland school board.

This economic success resulted in him becoming the laird of Ascog. He then created a larger system to supply water power to Greenock.

He ran for Massachusetts Attorney General in 1966, but dropped out of the race before the Republican primary. Hahn was elected Chairman of the Republican State Committee on November 22, 1971. He lost his chairmanship on May 25, 1972 amid allegations that he was being investigated by the State Attorney General's office for fraud. Hahn was indicted on June 16, 1972 on the charge of conspiracy to commit larceny. He was acquitted by a jury and later sued former Governor Francis W. Sargent, former Attorney General Robert H. Quinn, former State Insurance Commissioner John G. Ryan, and former Secretary of Consumer Affairs William Cowin. Hahn alleged that the defendants had violated his rights under the Civil Rights Act of 1871 when they \"perjured themselves, suborned perjury, suppressed evidence and manipulated administrative processes in an effort to destroy appellant's political career by generating adverse publicity and procuring his indictment.\" Three of the charges were dismissed and a summary judgment in favor of the defendants was issued on the fourth."

He was a native of Burlington, Iowa and graduated in philosophy from the University of Iowa in 1934. He received a master's degree in philosophy in 1935 and a doctorate in sociology in 1946 from Columbia University. He headed the department of sociology at City College of New York and at New York University before becoming emeritus professor of sociology at the University of Virginia. He was a student of the Russian-American sociologist Pitirim Sorokin when he was a visiting graduate student at Harvard University during the 1930s.Bierstedt served as vice-president of the American Sociological Association when Sorokin was elected president. Bierstedt was a longtime director of the American Civil Liberties Union, serving as chairman of its academic freedom committee and the church-state committee in the 1960s and 1970s. In addition, he was a former director of the American Council of Learned Societies, a federation of scholarly groups focused on the humanities, and president of the Eastern Sociological Society. In his 1959 presidential address \"Sociology and Humane Learning\" to the Eastern Sociological Society he argued for the role of debate in sociology and the importance of what he referred to as the \"theoretic bias\" in interpreting social phenomena. He also held Fulbright Senior Lectureships at Edinburgh University and the London School of Economics. He wrote several books, including The Social Order, Power and Progress: Essays on Sociological Theory and American Sociological Theory and has published many papers and essays in several sociological, anthropological, and literary journals. He died on September 8, 1998 at Martha Jefferson Hospital in Charlottesville, Virginia at 85."

In 1828 and in 1863, he was an emissary on behalf of Jerusalem to the countries of North Africa, remaining there on both occasions for several years. In 1845 he travelled to Italy as an emissary of Hebron and was received with great respect at the Vatican by Pope Gregory XVI. In 1880 he became rishon le-Zion, and in 1890 the Ottoman authorities appointed him hacham bashi (head of the Jewish community of Palestine). He was held in great esteem by all communities and authorities. He authored Lev Marpe (1887), talmudic novellae, responsa, and homilies. His son-in-law, Jacob Saul Elyashar, later succeeded him."

  "text" : "Richard Macdonald Lyle (born 12 June 1950) is a Scottish National Party Member of the Scottish Parliament, representing the Uddingston and Bellshill constituency. Lyle had previously represented the Central Scotland region. Lyle, who was educated at Lawmuir School and Bellshill Academy, has served as a local councillor on Motherwell District Council and North Lanarkshire Council since 1976. Lyle worked for RBS During the debate on same-sex marriage in Scotland, Lyle along with his SNP colleagues Dave Thompson, John Mason and Bill Walker was widely condemned for raising a motion stating that no person or organisation should be forced to be involved or to approve of same-sex marriage. In the lead up to the 2016 Holyrood election it was revealed that Lyle's Holyrood nickname is \"Salty Dick\" after it became public knowledge that he had once claimed the cost of a £1.80 bag of chips on expenses. Lyle has been at the center of an ongoing internal party dispute within the SNP Uddingston and Bellshill branch which saw party members state that they would refuse to vote for him at the Holyrood election."

  "text" : "Robert de Finingham (died 1460) was an English monk in the Franciscan (Greyfriars) monastery at Norwich, and an author. He was born at Finningham, Suffolk, and educated at the monastery where he later became a monk. He flourished in the reign of Henry VI. He is said to have been a very learned man, skilled, as Pits expressed it, \"in all liberal arts, excelling especially in canon law\", and was the author of numerous Latin works. The chief purpose of his writings was to defend the Franciscans against the common accusation that their profession of poverty was hypocritical. The titles of his known works are as follows: 1.  \n*  Pro Ordine Minorum 2.  \n*  Pro Dignitate Status Eorum 3.  \n*  Casus Conciliorum Angliæ 4.  \n*  De Casibus Decretorum 5.  \n*  De Casibus Decretalium 6.  \n*  De Extravagantibus 7.  \n*  De Excommunicationibus. Thomas Tanner describes a manuscript of this in John Moore's library, that is now in the Cambridge University Library (E. e. v. 11)."

  "text" : "Robinson Elsdale (1744-1783), was a British privateer and autobiographer. He was the son of Samuel Elsdale (1704–1788), of Surfleet, Lincolnshire. His sister Mary (1739–1772) was the mother of John Molson who founded the Molson Brewing Company. Elsdale entered the Royal Navy as a midshipman, but left early by reason of the slowness of promotion, and served in various privateers cruising against the French, chiefly off the coast of Hispaniola and the west coast of Africa, between 1762 and 1779, when he retired. For the benefit of his wife he wrote an account of some of the most exciting adventures and experiences which he had met with during his sea life. Those episodes in a life of adventure are told in a fresh, simple, and lively style, and abound in hair-breadth escapes and romantic incidents. The manuscript fell into the hands of Captain Marryat, and was freely used by him in the earlier chapters of Extracts from the Log of a Privateersman One Hundred Years Ago (1846), also known as The Privateersman. After his retirement from active service Elsdale lived quietly on an estate at Surfleet which had been in his family for many generations. He died on 15 October 1783."

In 1827, Smith was hired to establish coal mining operations in Nova Scotia for the General Mining Association. He established sites at Albion Mines (later Stellarton), Sydney Mines, Bridgeport and Little Bras d'Or. Smith contested a new assembly seat for Cape Breton in a violent election held in 1832 where William Young's supporters intimidated voters at some polls; he was declared elected to the assembly in 1833 after Young's election was overturned. In 1834, he returned to England. Smith managed the mineral holdings of the Earl of Dudley from 1836 to 1864. He died near Lichfield, Staffordshire at the age of 85."

  "text" : "Ryan Nicholas Sandes \"Hedgie\" (born 10 March 1982 in Cape Town), is a South African trail runner. In 2010 he became the first competitor to have won all four of the 4 Deserts races, each a 6/7-day, 250-kilometer (160 mi) self-supported footrace through the Atacama Desert in Chile, the Gobi Desert in China, the Sahara Desert in Egypt, and lastly Antarctica. His achievement prompted Mary Gadams, founder and CEO of RacingThePlanet and organiser of the event, to state “Ryan Sandes is clearly one of the top endurance athletes in the world - to have won all 4 Deserts is a remarkable accomplishment.” To date only 81 individuals have completed all four trails. 11 competitors have managed the 4 Deserts Grand Slam, that is, completing the four trails in a calendar year (from 1 January to 31 December of the same year). In 2010, Time magazine included the 4 Deserts Challenge on a list of the ten most demanding endurance races in the world. Sandes was winner of the Sahara Race in 2008, the Gobi March in 2008, second in 2009 RacingThePlanet Namibia, and winner of the Jungle Ultra Marathon in Floresta Nacional do Tapajós in Pará, Brazil, setting a new course record. Sandes won the 2011 Leadville Trail 100 in a time of 16:46:54, more than half an hour ahead of runner-up Dylan Bowman. He won the 2012 North Face 100 in Australia in a time of 9:22:45, and had placed 3rd in 2011. In August 2012, Sandes bettered Russell Pasche's record for the 90K Fish River Canyon hiking trail from 10:54 to 6:57. Sandes won the second race in the Ultra-Trail World Series Tour, The North Face Transgrancanaria, on March 1, 2014. After winning, Sandes was temporarily disqualified after a misunderstanding relating to his failing to produce the mandatory emergency blanket from his kit at the finish. Sandes appealed the disqualification and was subsequently reinstated as the winner. Sandes attended the South African College Schools (S.A.C.S.) where he took part in cricket, rugby and water polo. He was awarded a BSc degree in Construction and later an Honours in Quantity Surveying at the University of Cape Town. In addition to trail running, he is an active mountain biker, paddler and surfer."

  "text" : "Ruth Glass (born Ruth Adele Lazarus, 1912–1990) was a German-born British sociologist. Glass's work reflected her belief \"that the purpose of sociological research was to influence government policy and bring about social change\". A lasting legacy is her coining of the term 'gentrification', which she created to describe the processes by which the poor were squeezed out of parts of London as upper-class ghettos were created. A key figure in urban sociology, Ruth Glass made a significant contribution to the institutionalisation of British sociology as an academic discipline in the 1950s. Her reputation in this field was established from the late 1930s by studies of housing developments and planning in Watling and Middlesbrough, and later by pioneer work on black immigration. However, as Eric Hobsbawm acknowledged in his obituary of Glass, the text of what would have been her major work, the Third London Survey (successor to the surveys of Booth and Llewellyn Smith), was never quite completed. Between 1935 and 1941 she was married to Henry William Durant, the statistician and pioneer in the field of public opinion polling. She married David Victor Glass, a sociologist and demographer, in 1942."

In 2008 Cooper began the Immersion project, in which he records the expressions of people watching TV, playing video games and using the internet. \"Cooper's work creates a dual feedback: the players react intensely to the images they see on the screen, whereas we - the observers - react with our own feelings to their powerfully emotional facial expressions that to us, in turn, are just another image on a screen\".  Over time the project will build into a body of work which captures people of all ages immersed in digital media. Topics covered by the Immersion project, as of 2013, include video games, pornography, children's cartoons, comedy, sports, horror and music videos."

  "text" : "Sir Richard Leveson (1598–1661) was an English politician who sat in the House of Commons from 1640 to 1642. He supported the Royalist cause during the English Civil War. Leveson was the second son of Sir John Leveson of Halling, Kent, and his second wife Christian Mildmay, daughter of Sir Walter Mildmay. In 1605 he inherited property in Trentham, Staffordshire and Lilleshall, Shropshire from his father’s cousin Sir Richard Leveson, Vice-Admiral of England. Leveson's elder brother, John, who was intended to inherit his father's estates, died in 1612, three years before his father. Leveson therefore inherited his father’s estates in Kent as well as the Vice-Admiral’s estates. He rebuilt the family seat at Trentham Hall between 1630 and 1638 at a cost of over £6000. In November 1640, Leveson was elected Member of Parliament for Newcastle under Lyme in the Long Parliament. He encouraged Royalist support in Staffordshire and was disabled from sitting in parliament on 24 November 1642 for raising forces against parliament. In 1645 Lilleshall Abbey fell to the parliamentary army and Leveson was imprisoned at the Parliamentary garrison in Nantwich. Leveson married Katherine Dudley, daughter of Sir Robert Dudley, but had no children. His co-heiresses were the two daughters of his elder brother John. One of them, Christian, married Sir Peter Temple of Stowe. A portrait of this Sir Richard Leveson seems to have found its way into the collection of paintings at Stowe House, Buckingham. A portrait of Sir Richard Leveson, said to be by Vandyck, belonged to the Duke of Sutherland in 1891. This portrait was purchased for £65 02s 00d from the sale of the possessions of the Dukes of Buckingham and Chandos held at Stowe House in 1848. It was described in the sale catalogue as by Van Dyck (whereas other paintings are described as 'after Van Dyck' or a 'copy of Van Dyck'). The catalogue records that Sir Richard is shown ‘in a black dress, with a frill’and that the painting was ‘bought ‘after a very active competition.’"

Reidt was a house painter living in Long Island, New York, and heard about Californian Margaret Rowen's claim that the day of judgment was coming on February 6, 1925. Calling himself the \"Apostle of Doom\", he sold all his assets to spread word of the coming event. After nothing happened at the appointed hour outside his small rented abode in East Patchogue, he later blamed photo flashbulbs for obscuring a supposedly visible sign in the skies. He then suggested the end was coming in the following week. The events received regular front-page coverage in The New York Times and nationwide news coverage. In February 1926, Reidt made a new prediction that a fireball would soon strike New York City. This event also failed to occur. He made yet another unsuccessful prediction of doom in 1932. The last contemporary press coverage that Reidt received was in 1938, in connection with a planetarium trying to publicize a show about end of the world predictions. Reidt died at age 73 in March 1966 in Florida."

He was the pupil of a Sienese painter, named Giovan Battista Giusi, and they together painted an altar-piece, representing the 'Virgin and Child, with Saints,' which is in the Siena Academy, and in 1524 the 'Baptism of Christ,' for the baptistery of the cathedral of the same city. In 1525 the brothers went to Florence, and in the same year Andrea, and probably Raffaello also, was registered in the Painters' Guild. The brothers appear to have worked under the influence of Fra Bartolommeo. Raffaello died at Florence in 1545."

From 1768 to 1784 Symons sat as Member of Parliament for Hereford. In 1774 he was created a baronet, of The Mynde in the County of Hereford. Symons never married. He died in July 1796, when the baronetcy became extinct."

He received the support of Prince Rupert and in November 1640 was elected Member of Parliament for Lichfield in the Long Parliament. He was disabled from sitting in parliament in 1642 for supporting the King. Cave became Governor of Hereford Castle after the Royalists re-captured the town in 1642, but on 25 April 1643, the Parliamentarian forces under General Waller attacked Hereford and found little opposition. Waller demanded the surrender of the City, and a £3000 ransom, and imposed fines on the citizens instead of plunder. Cave was court-marshalled for the surrender of the City but he explained how reluctant the citizens had been to help with the defence and was acquitted. Cave subsequently fought at the Battle of Naseby where he was killed on16 June 1645. Cave married Elizabeth Bartlett, daughter of Sir Thomas Bartlett."

Later in her career, Dr. Allen shifted her focus to plant pathology. Her major contribution to the field of mycology was furthering the understanding of rust fungi, a group of economically important plant pathogens. Dr. Allen completed many studies on Puccinia graminis, once considered a catastrophically damaging disease-causing agent in cereal crops before the discovery of current management measures (Schumann and Leonard, 2000)."

The opportunity to serve as mayor arose because the incumbent mayor, Charles Stenvig, a former police detective who had also been defeated when seeking re-election, resigned on his final day in office to become acting Chief of Police. Erdall was a member of the Republican Party, and the last Republican to serve as Mayor of Minneapolis. In 1976, Erdall received the Republican nomination in the race to represent Minnesota's 5th congressional district, which was then represented by seven-term incumbent Donald M. Fraser. Erdall received less than 26 percent of the vote, and Fraser was re-elected."

Stribling was born in Markham, Virginia to his parents, Dr. Robert Mackey Stribling and Caroline Clarkson. Stribling received training as a doctor and completed medical degrees at the University of Virginia and University of Pennsylvania in 1854, and 1856, respectively, practicing medicine briefly before the outbreak of the Civil War. He was married to Mary Cary Ambler, daughter of Major Thomas Marshall Ambler and Lucy Johnston, from the neighboring estate of \"Morven\" in 1857. After her death in 1868, he married Agnes Harwood Douthat, daughter of Robert Douthat and Mary Ambler Marshall of \"Weyanoke\". In June 1861, he joined the Confederate Army and was made Captain of the Markham Guard and subsequently the Fauquier Artillery. The artillery was more commonly known as Stribling's Battery. Stribling saw action at Antietam, Bull Run, Suffolk, and provided cover at Gettysburg during his cousin George Pickett's Charge. By the end of the war Stribling was a Lt. Colonel in command of the 38th Virginia Light Artillery Battalion. Following the War, he returned to Markham and took over the family estate, Mountain View. He was elected as representative to the Virginia House of Delegates in 1879 and served until 1887. During his time in the legislature, he focussed on collecting and saving all Confederate military records. In July 1897, the Woodrow Wilsons stayed at the Colonel's home for vacation. In 1904 he published a book on Lee's Gettysburg Campaign. Stribling, along with his close friend, Gen. Lunsford L. Lomax, spoke frequently to veteran's groups about the Civil War. The Confederate War Memorial on South Washington Street in Alexandria also bears his name."
