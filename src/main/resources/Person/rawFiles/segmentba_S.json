She read music at Newnham College, Cambridge from 1998–2001, where she was the first ever Newnham Choral Scholar in Selwyn College's Chapel Choir. After gaining a first class degree, she undertook an MA at Edinburgh University, subsequently becoming a tutor, a post she retained until 2006. While based in Edinburgh, Mohr-Pietsch embarked on a career in arts administration and began to broadcast on Radio 3, winning a BBC talent contest in 2004 . After moving back to London her involvement with the network became more extensive. She became a regular presenter of the network’s Breakfast programme in 2007. Her fortnightly stretches alternated with those of Petroc Trelawny; previously Rob Cowan was the other regular presenter. In addition, she presents (with others) the contemporary music programme Hear and Now. Mohr-Pietsch began to present The Proms in 2008 on Radio 3, and on television for the BBC. At the beginning of December 2013, Clemency Burton-Hill replaced her on Breakfast. She regularly presents Radio 3's \"The Choir\", and the Discovering Music series, particularly in programmes on Bach, whom she greatly admires and has studied extensively; early music is another interest. She is also a singer and pianist and plays the viola da gamba – \"incredibly badly\" in her own words. In support of Red Nose Day 2013, Mohr-Pietsch set herself the challenge of learning eight notes on the cello in seven days, as part of a comic rendition of Pachelbel's Canon."

There she received a silver medal and also a special award for the most original solution. It was the first such award in the history of that Olympiad. Gong participated in IMO five times, winning HM in 2002, bronze in 2003, silver in 2004 and 2005 and gold in 2007. In 2005 she was named the 2005 Clay Olympiad Scholar; the Clay Olympiad Scholar Award recognizes the most original solution to a problem on the US American Mathematics Olympiad (USAMO). In 2006 she earned a silver medal at the 2006 International Physics Olympiad. She was a winner (top twelve) at the United States of America Mathematical Olympiad in 2005, 2006, and 2007, including placing 2nd in 2007. As a Harvard freshman, Gong scored over 100 in Harvard’s famous problem solving course, Math 55, which required perfect scores on all assignments, tests, bonus problems, and the final exam. In 2010 Gong helped coach the U.S. team that competed in the China Girls’ Mathematical Olympiad; five team members won gold medals. In 2011 she won the Alice T. Schafer Prize for Excellence in Mathematics by an Undergraduate Woman.

  "text" : "Stanley Waterloo (1846-1913) was an American newspaperman, editor, newspaper owner, and author of both non-fiction and fiction. He was born in St. Clair County, Michigan in 1846 and died in Chicago, Illinois in 1913 (of pneumonia). He married Anna Charlotte Kitton on February 11, 1874. Waterloo attended the University of Michigan. One source says he graduated in 1869, but another says he did not. Waterloo secured an appointment to West Point, but was not able to attend, because he suffered an injury. One account was that he had been kicked by a horse he was trying to break. Having grown up in the countryside, Waterloo was fond of the outdoors and was highly regarded for his descriptions of nature. He was, among other things, a Game Warden for Illinois. By 1870 Waterloo was in Chicago, where he went to study law but dropped out and instead began his career in journalism. In 1871, after the Great Chicago Fire, he moved to St. Louis, Missouri, and acquired a proprietorship interest in the Evening Journal. For the next dozen years he worked in Missouri at, variously, the Missouri Republican, the St. Louis Chronicle, and the St. Louis Globe-Democrat. While Waterloo was editor of the Chronicle, an editorial appeared which was critical of a local judge. The judge threatened Waterloo and there were concerns that the threat included physical violence. Waterloo refused to back down. It turned out that the editorial was actually written by another judge. He then moved to St. Paul, Minnesota, where he began a newspaper named The Day. He then moved back to Chicago and worked in an editorial capacity at the Chicago Tribune. This occupied the next half dozen years, and during this time he was twice president of the Chicago Press Club. He then turned exclusively to literature. His first novel, A man and a woman, sold more than 100,000 copies in six months. His work was well received in England, and he was one of the first American authors to sell well there. His most famous work, The Story of Ab: A Tale of the Time of the Caveman, was followed by a story by Jack London, \"Before Adam\", which was so similar to Waterloo's novel that Waterloo accused London of plagiarism. London denied this, explaining that his story was in the nature of a commentary on Waterloo's work."

From 1898 to 1918 he taught at several universities: Colorado College, Stanford University, Tulane University, and Ohio State University. In 1903 he published his book Elements of Electromagnetic Theory, which he dedicated to his friend Professor Francis H. Smith at the University of Virginia. From 1918 to 1926 he worked at the Carnegie Institution for Science in Washington, DC. In 1926 he was a professor at the University of California at Los Angeles. Barnett worked mainly on electromagnetism, and discovered the Barnett effect. His wife, Mrs. Lelia Jefferson Harvie Barnett, was a scientific co-collaborator, and together they worked in a magnetic metal-free lab at the California Institute of Technology from 1924-1953. He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1921. Barnett died in Pasadena, California, about a month after the death of his wife, Lelia Jefferson Harvie Barnett.

  "text" : "Sir Edward Greaves, 1st Baronet (1608 – 11 November 1680), was an English physician. Greaves was the son of John Greaves, rector of Colemore, Hampshire. He was born at Croydon, Surrey, in 1608. His brothers were John Greaves, Nicholas Greaves and Thomas Greaves. He studied at Oxford University, and was elected a fellow of All Souls' College in 1634. After this he studied medicine at Padua University, where in 1636 he wrote some complimentary Latin verses to Sir George Ent on his graduation, and returning to Oxford graduated M.B. 18 July 1640, M.D. 8 July 1641. In 1642 he continued his medical studies at the university of Leyden, and on his return practised physic at Oxford, where, 14 November 1643, he was appointed Linacre superior reader of physic. In the same year he published' Morbus epidemicus Anni 1643, or the New Disease with the Signes, Causes, Remedies,' &c, an account of a mild form of typhus fever, which was an epidemic at Oxford in that year, especially in the houses where sick and wounded soldiers were quartered. Charles I is supposed to have created him a baronet 4 May 1645. Of this creation, the first of a physician to that rank, no record exists, but the accurate Le Neve did not doubt the fact, and explained the absence of enrolment. With his friend Walter Charleton, Greaves became travelling physician to Charles II, but settled in London in 1653, and was admitted a fellow of the College of Physicians 18 October 1657. He delivered the Harveian oration at the College of Physicians 25 July 1661 (London, 1667, 4to), of which the original manuscript is in the British Museum (Sloane 302). He says that before Harvey the source of the circulation was as unknown as that of the Nile, and compares England to a heart, whence the knowledge of the circulation was driven forth to other lands. He became physician in ordinary to Charles II who granted him the lands of St Leonard's Forest in Sussex, including that part which became Leonardslee. He married Alicia Nevett (1624–1684), widow of Peter Calf (d. 1668). Greaves lived in Covent Garden, died there 11 Nov. 1680, and was buried in the church of St. Paul's, Covent Garden."

  "text" : "Sir Gilfrid Lawson, 6th Baronet (1675–1749), was an English politician. He was one of the Lawson Baronets. Upon the death of Mardaunt Lawson, the title and all of the estate passed to his cousin Gilfrid Lawson the grandson of Sir Wilfrid Lawson, 1st Baronet, of Isell, Member of Parliament Cumberland 1660, who had left Isel Hall to his eldest son, the father of Sir Wilfrid Lawson, 1st Baronet, of Isell, and Brayton, Cumberland to his second son, Gilfrid’s father. Sir Gilfrid Lawson 6th Bart (1675–1749) was Member of Parliament for the Cumberland constituency from 1702–1705 and also from 1707-34. A moderate Tory, though a member of the October Club, he voted after 1715 consistently against the Government. In parliament he was plain Mr Lawson and two parliamentary speeches are recorded in the parliamentary proceedings (Hansard began in 1803). On 4 April 1717, after James Stanhope had offended several members after moving that parliament grant the King supplies to subsidise foreign powers, Lawson declared that no one but ‘such as ... were not the King’s friends’ could refuse to support the vote of credit for measures against Sweden. He further said that if a Member must be accounted an enemy to the King when he happens not to fall in with his ministers ... they had nothing else to do but to retire to their country seats. According to records Lawson's inflammatory response accused the speaker of ‘interfering with freedom of debate’. An extract from Tindal's England (Vol 2) records: \"...that he was surprised to hear such unguarded expressions fall from so respectable a person, and that if every member of the House who used Freedpom of Speech must be accounted an enemy to the King whenever he happened to disapprove of the measures of his Ministers, he knew no service they could render to their country in that House, and it were better at once to retire to their country seats, and leave the King and his Ministers to act entirely at their discretion.\" On 15 Dec. 1720 he attacked the South Sea Company directors, and four days later he seconded Sir Joseph Jekyll’s motion for a select committee of the Commons to inquire into the affairs of the Company. On 6 Apr. 1723, he opposed the bill of pains and penalties against Francis Atterbury on the grounds of insufficiency of evidence.. No further speeches by Lawson are reported till 1730, when he spoke in favour of removing the duty on salt, as most affecting the poor. He also spoke against the removal of the duty on Irish yarn, and against the wool bill in 1731. In 1734 he retired, giving his interest to his first cousin once removed, Sir Joseph Pennington, having ‘broke with all other considerable people in the county’.Sir Gilfrid Lawson died on 23 August 1749 without issue and the title passed to his brother Alfred. After the death of Sir Alfred Lawson 7th Bart died in 1752, his eldest son Wilfrid received the title. Sir Wilfrid Lawson 8th Bart (1712–63) became Sheriff of Cumberland in 1756. In 1761, he entered Parliament for the Cumberland constituency after James Lowther, 1st Earl of Lonsdale who had been returned for that constituency, and for Westmorland, preferred to sit for the latter. Sir Wilfrid died in 1763, and having no issue the baronetcy passed to his brother Glifrid."

  "text" : "Sir Gilfrid Lawson, 9th Baronet (1713 – 1794), was one of the Lawson Baronets. He was the son of Sir Alfred Lawson, 7th Baronet and inherited his title in 1762 on the death of his brother Sir Wilfrid Lawson, 8th Baronet, who died on the way to Parliament. Although never a Member of Parliament, Gilfrid left his mark on the political scene while serving as High Sheriff of Cumberland during the controversial election for the Cumberland constituency in 1768. A contest between the representatives of the Lowther family and those sponsored by the Duke of Portland, the first time a county election had seen an open contest between the Tories and the Whigs. Hitherto, the representation of the County of Cumberland had been divided; and whereas both representatives had been Whigs, one had generally been a Court Whig and the other an Independent Whig. The desire of King George III of Great Britain to free himself from the rule of the great aristocratic houses (Whigs) not only united all sections of that party, but also by bestowing his favour on the Tory party, greatly enhanced their political importance. The said election was contested between Whigs and Tories, not between Whigs on one side, and the Country party composed of Whigs, Tories and Jacobites on the other. A significant proportion of the people of Cumberland were imbued with Jacobite principles, thus favouring the Lowthers. Henry Curwen and Henry Fletcher represented the Whigs, while James Lowther, 1st Earl of Lonsdale and Humphrey Senhouse represented the Tories. Both Parties were equally wealthy and according to the contemporary gossip chronicles, as much as £80,000 may have been expended. The controversial poll lasted nineteen days and on its termination, the Sheriff having rejected many of the electors, returned Curwen and Lowther. Many voters were rejected because the Land-tax lists, which were then the register of voters were in many instances signed only by two Land-tax Commissioners, whereas the Act imperatively required three signatures. In other cases the proper duplicates (which were then the legal registers) were not produced, but only the collectors lists. Had Lawson rejected all of the invalid votes, he would have acted correctly and Curwen and Lowther would have been duly elected. However, Lawson appears to have been a man of indecision, for he accepted some of the voters, which he marked with a query, and then did what he had no right to do; he struck several of the voters out of the poll book and returned Curwen and Lowther. Both parties petitioned Parliament. The Whigs based their complaints around the conduct of the Sheriff who was clearly in the wrong. Had he simply refused to receive the votes, which were clearly invalid, the return would have been the correct decision; but having placed the invalid votes on the poll book, which he had no authority to interfere with, for that was the duty of the members of the House of Commons. After much further wrangling, a compromise was reached, resulting in the election of Curwen and Fletcher. It was also agreed that all future polls would be contested by one nominated member from each party only, a compromise, respected for 63 years. Sir Gilfrid through all this meddling was very fortunate to end his days at Brayton. A motion moved by the Whigs in the House of Commons, later withdrawn, sought his committal to Newgate. Lawson became one of the early Cumberland landlords to promote a parliamentary Land Enclosures Act, when in 1770 at his request, parliament passed the Bassenthwaite Enclosures Act, enabling the wasteland in that parish to be enclosed and made available for cultivation. Sir Gilfrid died in 1794, and his remains lie in the south-east corner of Aspatria churchyard. Lawson had married Amelia, daughter of John Lovett Esq. The marriage produced two children, a son Wilfrid and a daughter Amelia. He was succeeded by his son Sir Wilfrid Lawson, 10th Baronet, the last of that order."

  "text" : "Stephen Glover (1794-1870) was an English author and antiquary. The following biography is written by descendants of Stephen Glover and is based on materials in their possession. Stephen Glover was born at Long Clawson, near Melton Mowbray, Leicestershire to William and Jane Glover (née Crafts) on 20 February 1794. He was the seventh child of some twelve or fourteen children.He was brought up by his maternal grandmother Mrs Craft at Nether Broughton near Hinckley and educated by her son, his uncle, Mr Craft, who kept the school at Burbage.After leaving school he served a five year apprenticeship with Mr Thomas Welldon, an iron-founder. Following this, he was sent to school to study navigation and was promised a Commission in the Royal Navy by George Canning. Although his uncle was prepared to pay £200 for his outfit, his aunt objected, and so was unable to further this career.Sent back to Derby, he became apprenticed to Mr Marriott, bookseller. Stephen then took charge of the County Library. He soon became known as ‘The Young Bagman’ as he travelled over three counties, on horseback with saddlebags, to obtain orders for paper. At the conclusion of his apprenticeship, Mr Marriott offered him employment, which Stephen accepted for a salary of £70 per annum. However, this only lasted for 12 months. Stephen immediately went to London, where he formed a connection with a London bookseller. Returning again to Derby, he commenced business in Full Street as a printer. In order to expand this business he began to deal wholesale in paper and travelled for orders. He was still only twenty years old. He was married at Wirksworth, Derbyshire on 8 April 1815 to Anne Shaw, youngest daughter of James Shaw of Bolehill, Derbyshire. Stephen left Derby and purchased a house in Wirksworth, where a son, Stephen Shaw Glover was born to Anne on 15 March 1817; however Anne died later that year on 8 October.He married again at Matlock Church on 7 December 1818 to Anne Milnes (born 30 March 1796), daughter of Joseph Milnes of Mansfield, a yeoman and Anne (née Hodgkinson of Langton Hall. While living at Wirksworth, Anne gave birth to three children, Francis Milnes 2 February 1820 who died 21 February 1822 and was buried at Wirksworth, William 18 June 1822 and John Edwin Milnes 12 January 1824.Stephen remained with his family in Wirksworth for eight years. A lawsuit during this time about a property, which lasted 2 and a half years and cost him £500, was eventually settled by arbitration. He sold the property.In his younger days he was very fond of Coursing and while at Wirksworth belonged to a Club of six persons each of whom kept a brace of greyhounds and coursed over the estates at Stubbing Edge House and AlderwarleyA letter (held in Derby Local Studies Library, Irongate, Derby) dated 16 February 1825 is significant because it gives the first indication of incurred debt. Stephen’s avoidance of repaying his creditors, for whatever reasons, heralded a pattern of his behaviour, which would be evident throughout his life and become increasingly problematic to him and his family. This is revealed through business and personal correspondence still surviving. To be continued Stephen Glover compiled the Peak Guide in 1830, and assisted author Stephen Bateman in his Antiquities of Derbyshire, in 1848. Glover's best known work is the History and Gazetteer of the County of Derby. The first volume was published in 1831, and the second in 1833. These volumes had been delayed some time owing to the disputes between the compiler and the engravers. As a result, the work was never completed. Glover died in 1870 and was buried at Moreton, Cheshire."

He ran 15,401 kilometres (9,570 mi) during his marathons over 2010. Engels said that a slow pace was the key. Before him, the record was held by  Ricardo Abad Martínez of Spain with 150 marathons in a row in 2009. Abad is the current world record holder. Of his feats, Engels described: \"I don't regard my marathon year as torture. It's more like a regular job...I am running just as Joe Average goes to work on Monday morning, whether or not he feels like it. I don't always feel like running, but when I am done, I take a shower, have some physiotherapy for an hour, and that wraps up my day.\" Growing up Engels had asthma and was instructed to avoid activity."

Islambouli organised the first teams of Egyptian mujahideen entering Afghanistan to battle the Soviet invasion, and by 1983 he had established a network smuggling people and weapons through Karachi, Pakistan and Egypt that still functioned towards the dawn of the War on Terror in 2001. In late May 1995, Hassan al-Turabi met with al-Zawahiri to discuss the future of the Vanguards of Conquest; now to operate solely out of Egypt. al-Zawahiri and Mustafa Hamzah organised a meeting in Ferney-Voltaire on the French-Swiss border, attended by a colleague of Tal'at Fu'ad Qasim, an associate of Showqi Al-Islambouli and the son of Said Ramadan. The group decided to focus their efforts on Addis Ababa, and that their veteran members would come together under the leadership of Islambouli. Al-Islambouli came close to assassinating the Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak on June 22, 1995 on the way from Addis Ababa International Airport to an African summit in the city. Showqi and his associates opened fire on the armor-plated limousine destroying most of the escort vehicles. However, Mubarak was saved by the skills of his chauffeur, who U-turned the damaged limousine and raced back to the airport where the presidential plane was waiting with running engines. Over the winter of 1996/1997, al-Islambouli was commanding a team of al-Gama'a al-Islamiyya members, and allocated them to travel to Somalia to bolster the forces of the Islamic Liberation Party. Al-Islambouli was deported to Egypt in May 2011 from Iran after having stayed there for 8 years. He was arrested upon arrival at Cairo International airport and was retried on terrorism charges. An Egyptian military court in Cairo ordered his release on health grounds in February 2012."

  "text" : "Stewart Martin Wood, Baron Wood of Anfield (born 25 March 1968) is a Labour life peer in the House of Lords. Wood grew up in Tonbridge, Kent and attended the Judd School. In 1986 he went to University College, Oxford, where he obtained a first-class degree in Philosophy, Politics and Economics. He then went to Harvard University as a Fulbright Scholar where he completed a PhD in Government in 1996. He has taught at Oxford University since 1995. From 1996-2011 he was a Politics Tutor at Magdalen College, Oxford, where he is still an (unpaid) emeritus fellow. In 2016 he was appointed a Fellow of Practice at the Blavatnik School of Government in Oxford. From 2001-2007 he was a member of the Chancellor of the Exchequer's Council of Economic Advisers, specializing in education policy, local government affairs & EU policy. He was part of the Treasury team that delivered the \"Five Tests\" assessment recommending that the UK not join the Euro in 2003. From 2007-2010 he served as an adviser to Gordon Brown, Prime Minister covering foreign policy; Northern Ireland; and culture, media and sports policy. After the 2010 election he helped run Ed Miliband's campaign to become Leader of the Labour Party, and served as an adviser to Ed Miliband, the Labour party's leader, from 2010 to 2015. On 15 January 2011, Wood was created a life peer with the title Baron Wood of Anfield, of Tonbridge in the County of Kent, and was introduced in the House of Lords on 18 January 2011, where he sits as a Labour peer. From 2011-2015 he served as a Shadow Minister without Portfolio. Wood's research and writing focuses on contemporary political economy in Europe, German politics, American politics, and public policy issues around industrial policy & the future of the welfare state. He worked with the think tank Policy Network on the concept of pre-distribution as a means to tackle what Ed Miliband has described as 'the growing crisis in living standards'. The announcement that pre-distribution would become a cornerstone of the UK Labour Party's economic policy was jokingly mocked by Prime Minister David Cameron during Prime Minister's Questions in the House of Commons. Given that the ideal of a predistributive \"property owning democracy\" was first put forward by the Scottish conservative MP Noel Skelton and was later endorsed by Margaret Thatcher, this was an odd turn for Conservative policy to take. In July 2016 he succeeded Jeremy Greenstock as Chair of the United Nations Association (UNA-UK). In the same month he was appointed to the Board of the Marshall Aid Commemoration Commission. He has been a Board member of the Royal Court Theatre since 2006. He is a fan of Jethro Tull, Liverpool FC & Kent County Cricket Club."

With his brother Charles, he discovered the largest recorded gold nugget ever discovered at that time, with a weight of 54 kilograms. Napier returned to Bathurst but spent his share of the profits.

He is famous for the Gell-Mann-Okubo mass formula for mesons and baryons in the quark model; this formula correctly predicts the relations of masses of the members of SU(3) multiplets in terms of hypercharge and isotopic spin. In 2005 he received the Sakurai Prize from the American Physical Society; \"For groundbreaking investigations into the pattern of hadronic masses and decay rates, which provided essential clues into the development of the quark model, and for demonstrating that CP violation permits partial decay rate asymmetries\". In 1976 the Nishina Memorial Prize in Japan and in 2006 the Wigner Medal. In 1966 he was a Guggenheim Fellow and in 1969 a Ford Fellow. He is a member of the American Physical Society and the American Mathematical Society.

At that time, Galatista was a Bishopry and had many schools providing formidable education. The same town was the birthplace of the hagiographers Galatsanoi, who painted many icons and murals in the Mount Athos Vatopedi monastery. Agapius, when still young, travelled to Jerusalem, where he became first a monk and later a priest by Patriarch Parthenius (1737–1766). He returned to Thessaloniki, where he served as a priest. In 1743, he was sent to Moscow to collect charities and financial assistance to the Patriarchate of Jerusalem and remained there till 1747. He returned to Thessaloniki, where he taught at the Athos Academy and other schools. On 18 August 1752, Agapius was tortured and murdered by Janissaries on his way from Galatista to Thessaloniki. It is not known where he was buried. He was honored as a saint for the first time in 1997 and since then his memory is observed on 18 August."

  "text" : "Sven-Olov Lawesson (9 September 1926 in Bräcke, Sweden, - 5 March 1985) was a Swedish chemist known for his popularization of Lawesson's reagent within the chemical community. He is also known for his 1982 work exploring the possibility of a connection between recreational use of amyl nitrite and an increased incidence of Kaposi's sarcoma in homosexual men Lawesson obtained his education at Uppsala University. He did most of his work at the University of Aarhus in Denmark and his last paper was published in 1986. After finding that 2,4-bis(4-methoxyphenyl)-1,3,2,4-dithiadiphosphetane 2,4-disulfide was useful for some reactions, Lawesson undertook a general survey of the reactivity of organic compounds with this reagent. It is often named after him as Lawesson's reagent. The synthesis of thioketones is his most cited paper. At one point S. O. Lawesson worked with the chemist N. M. Yousif. After Lawesson's death, Yousif has been working in Egypt and has been very active within the phosphorus sulfur chemical community. Yousif has published many new reactions of Lawesson's reagent. Prof T. B. Rauchfuss, who is in the United States did some very important work on Lawesson's reagent. He did the 31P NMR experiment which proved that Lawesson's reagent could form the dithiophosphine ylides in solution."

  "text" : "Sergei Ivanovich Shchukin (Russian: Серге́й Ива́нович Щу́кин) (27 May 1854 in Moscow – 10 January 1936 in Paris) was a Russian businessman who became an art collector, mainly of French Impressionist and Post-Impressionist art, following a trip to Paris in 1897, when he bought his first Monet. He later bought numerous works to a total of 258 paintings decorating the walls of his palatial home in Moscow.By 1914, Shchukin owned thirteen Monets, including the iconic Lady in the garden and the smaller but complete version of \"Picnic\", three Renoir, eight Cézanne, including famous \"Carnival\" (Mardi Gras), four Van Gogh (including the portrait of Dr Rey but the most famous Van Gogh in Russia \"Prison Courtyard\" and \"Red Vineyard\" were purchased by Shchukin's friend and competitor, Ivan Abramovitch Morozov), sixteen Gauguin of the Tahitian period, which were hanged in his dining room in the manner of an orthodox iconostasis), seven Henri Rousseau, sixteen Derain, eight Albert Marquet, two Dethomas...Shchukin was particularly notable for his long association with Matisse, who decorated his mansion and created one of his iconic paintings, La Danse, specially for Shchukin. La Danse is commonly recognized as \"a key point of (Matisse's) career and in the development of modern painting\". Henri Matisse created one of his major works La Danse for Shchukin as part of a two painting commission, the other important painting being Music, 1910. An earlier version of La Danse (1909) is in the collection of The Museum of Modern Art in New York City. The collection also featured fifty choice works by Pablo Picasso, including most of his earliest Cubist works, such as Three Women and major landscapes, but some key pieces of the Blue and Rose periods as well. In 1909, Shchukin opened his home on Sundays for public viewings, introducing French avant-garde painting to the Moscovites. After the 1917 Revolution, the government appropriated his collection (decree of the Council of the people commissioners, signed Lenin, November 8, 1918) while Shchukin escaped to Paris, where he died in 1936. His mansion in Moscow became the State Museum of New Western Art (Государственный Музей нового западного искусствa, section I), the section II being the mansion and collection of the other famous Russian patron Ivan Morozov. Eventually (1928), the two sections were merged and exhibited in the former Ivan Morozov mansion at Prechistenka, 21. In 1948 the State Museum of New Western Art was closed down by a decree signed by Stalin due to its allegedly bourgeois, cosmopolitan and wrongly oriented artworks. The two collections were randomly divided between the Pushkin Museum of Fine Arts and the State Hermitage Museum in St. Petersburg. Irina Antonova, Director of the Pushkin Museum, once remarked about Shchukin: \"He started to collect unpopular art, which was snubbed by the Louvre and other museums. It was his personal taste. Perhaps he heard foreshocks that would change the world. Such a collector could appear only in a country that awaited a revolution. He collected art that prefigured the global cataclysms\"."

  "text" : "Suintila (Gothic: Swinþila), or Swinthila, Svinthila; (ca. 588 – 633/635) was Visigothic King of Hispania, Septimania and Galicia from 621 to 631. There was a new peace in the Kingdom of the Visigoths. As a direct result, by 624 the king was able to retake those lands that had been under the control of the Byzantine Empire. He was a son of Reccared I and wife Bado, and a brother of the general Geila. On the linguistic front, it was around Suintila’s time that a secondary form of the word Hispania was growing in usage: Spania, from which the modern name of Spain originated. According to Isidore of Seville, who died in 636, it was with the Visigothic domination of Hispania that the idea of a peninsular unity was sought, and the phrase mater Spania (‘mother Hispania’) was first used. Up to that date, it had been the word Hispania that designated all of the lands in the Iberian peninsula. In his Historia de regibus Gothorum, Vandalorum et Suevorum, Isidore describes Suintila as the first king of totius Spaniae. In the prologue to this work, De laude Spaniae (‘About Hispania’s Pride’), the country is dealt with as a Gothic nation."

Formerly mayor of Tashkent and a key ally of the first Uzbek President Islam Karimov, Mirsaidov had served as the last Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars (prime minister) of the Uzbek SSR (1990) and then as Vice President of Uzbekistan until Karimov abolished this office on 8 January 1992. Mirsaidov criticised Karimov's administration, posing the most significant political threat to the administration at that time. Before his resignation, he sent an open letter to Karimov stating, \"democracy and a policy of openness are being replaced by an authoritarian regime.\" In 1993, he formed the Forum of Democratic Forces as an attempt to unite parties opposed to Karimov's rule. It was unsuccessful. Mirsaidov created a new party, Adolat (Justice) in December 1994, calling for liberal economic reforms, political pluralism and secularism. Mirsaidov was tried and convicted of embezzlement and corruption in 1994, and had to pay $1 million in fines. On 24 August 1994, a bomb destroyed his car as he and a colleague were walking toward it. On 18 September of that year, he and his son, Hasan, were beaten in the street by unknown assailants. Hasan was also kidnapped and beaten in 1996. Mirsaidov died in Tashkent at the age of 73 on 1 November 2012."

Best known for her role of Mayumi Nagamine in Gamera: Guardian of the Universe (1995) and Gamera 3: The Revenge of Iris (1999), Shinobu Nakayama like her older sister, Miho Nakayama, started out her career as a musician. Unfortunately, Nakayama could never quite attain the same popularity of her older sister as a solo artist, but became successful when she joined a music group called Rakutenshi. In the early 1990s Shinobu Nakayama started a career in acting, again following in the footsteps of her older sister. Her career finally started going after she landed a role in the Jet Li movie Fist of Legend, a remake of the Bruce Lee film Chinese Connection. Shortly afterwards she got the part of Mayumi Nagamine in Gamera: Guardian of the Universe (1995), which led to playing that same character four years later in Gamera 3: The Revenge of Iris (1999)."

She lived in Norfolk, England, and preached widely around the county. After the death of her husband she travelled with another female preacher (Martha Grigson) which enabled her to preach both in London and Birmingham.

  "text" : "Sylvester A. Barrett (18 May 1926 – 8 May 2002) was an Irish Fianna Fáil politician. He served under Jack Lynch and Charles Haughey as Minister for the Environment (1977–1980) and Minister for Defence (1980–1981). Sylvester Barrett was born in Darragh, near Ennis, County Clare in 1926. His father, who was a founder-member of the Fianna Fáil party, died while Barrett was still very young. As a result he was raised by an uncle and aunt. Barrett was educated at Ballyea National School and St. Flannan's College in Ennis. He studied engineering at University College Galway though did not complete his studies. He was a cadet in the Irish Army and later worked as a rate collector and an auctioneer. He was first elected to Dáil Éireann on 14 March 1968 at the Clare by-election in the Clare constituency, held following the death of Fine Gael TD William Murphy. Barrett topped the poll at the general election the following year. At the 1973 general election Fianna Fáil lost power to a Fine Gael–Labour Party coalition government under Liam Cosgrave, and Barrett was appointed to the party's front bench as spokesperson on Transport and Power. After Fianna Fáil's landslide victory at the 1977 general election he was appointed to the Cabinet as Minister for the Environment. In 1979 Barrett supported George Colley in the Fianna Fáil leadership election. Charles Haughey was the eventual victor, but Barrett was retained in the cabinet in the Environment position. Following a reshuffle in 1980 he was appointed Minister for Defence. After the February 1982 general election Fianna Fáil were returned to power but Barrett was not appointed to the Cabinet. However, several weeks later he was appointed a Minister of State at the Department of Finance. In October 1982, when Charlie McCreevy put down a motion of no confidence in Haughey's leadership, Barrett was the only Minister of State to support it. Haughey survived, and while Barrett was a member of the so-called \"Gang of 22\" he was not sacked from his office. Indeed the following month he topped the poll at the November 1982 general election. Fianna Fáil were out of power again and Barrett was appointed to the front bench as spokesperson on Defence. He remained there until 1984 when he won a seat in the Munster constituency at the 1984 European Parliament election and was replaced on the Front Bench by Noel Treacy. He decided not to contest either the 1987 general election or the 1989 European Parliament election, and retired from politics. He died in 2002."

  "text" : "Shrilal Shukla (31 December 1925 – 28 October 2011) was a Hindi writer, notable for his satire. He worked as a Provincial Civil Services (PCS) officer for the state government of Uttar Pradesh, later inducted into the IAS. He has written over 25 books, including Raag Darbari, Makaan, Sooni Ghaati Ka Sooraj, Pehla Padaav and Bisrampur Ka Sant. Shukla has highlighted the falling moral values in the Indian society in the post independence era through his novels. His writings expose the negative aspects of life in rural and urban India in a satirical manner. His best known work Raag Darbari has been translated into English and 15 Indian languages. A television serial based on this continued for several months on the national network in the 1980s. It is a little-known fact that he also wrote a detective novel entitled Aadmi Ka Zahar which was serialised in the weekly magazine 'Hindustan'."

Touted as a future prime minister, his aspirations to higher political office were effectively terminated in 1885, after a notorious and well-publicised divorce case. His disgrace, and the alignment of Joseph Chamberlain with the Conservatives, greatly weakened the radical cause."

  "text" : "Samuel Fancourt (1678–1768), was a dissenting minister and projector of circulating libraries. Fancourt is said to have been a native of the west of England. One of ‘the four London ministers’ of 1719 was his tutor, and another his predecessor at the place from which he removed to Salisbury. This probably indicates that he was trained for the ministry by Benjamin Robinson at Hungerford, and succeeded Jeremiah Smith as pastor at Andover. From 1718 to 1730 he was minister and tutor in Salisbury. On the occasion of the controversy which arose in consequence of the proceedings at the Salters' Hall conference of London ministers in February 1719, he wrote two tracts on the side of the dogmatists. Some years later he involved himself in a controversy about free-will and predestination, which eventually resulted in his having to leave Salisbury. He went to London and there established what was said, about forty years afterwards, to have been the first circulating library. A library conducted by him, in which the subscription was a guinea per annum, was dissolved at Michaelmas 1745, and he then carried out a new plan. This plan is described in the ‘Alphabetical Catalogue of Books and Pamphlets belonging to the Circulating Library in Crane Court’ (Fleet Street), 2 vols. 8vo, 1748, which he issued in parts between 1746 and 1748. According to this scheme for ‘The Gentlemen and Ladies' Growing and Circulating Library,’ any one might become a proprietor by an initial payment of a guinea and a quarterly payment of a shilling. The proprietors were to choose trustees in whom the library was to be vested, Fancourt himself being appointed librarian during good behaviour. Each proprietor was to be allowed to take out one volume and one pamphlet at a time. ‘He may keep them a reasonable time according to their bigness; but if they are not wanted by others he may keep them as long as he has a mind.’ The library contained two or three thousand bound volumes and about the same number of pamphlets; from a third to a half of the books and pamphlets consisted of theology and ecclesiastical history and controversy, and only about a tenth of it was ‘light’ literature. The house in Crane Court in which it was placed was close to the quarters of the Royal Society, and either it or the house next to it was eventually taken by that society for an enlargement of its own library. Dr. Cromwell Mortimer, second secretary to the society, was a persistent enemy of the circulating library till his death in 1752. At some period later than 1755 Fancourt left Crane Court, and, after several changes, moved his library to ‘the corner of one of the streets in the Strand,’ where his various schemes finally broke down. The library was taken by his creditors, and he retired to Hoxton Square, where he was supported by some of the dissenting ministers, till he died at the age of ninety, on 8 June 1768. In the Crane Court library catalogue he offered for twelve guineas to teach ‘any one of a common capacity and diligence’ to read, write, and speak Latin with fluency in a year, by giving them five or six hours' tuition a week. The following is a list of Fancourt's various writings, which are all, except the ninth, enumerated with long titles and extracts in the Crane Court Catalogue (vol. i. pamphlets, pp. 11, 24, 27, 166–70): 1. ‘Sermon at the Funeral of Mr. John Terry,’ 1720. 2. ‘Essay concerning Certainty and Infallibility, or Reflections on “The Nature and Consequences of Enthusiasm,”’ 1720. 3. ‘Enthusiasm Retorted, or Remarks on Mr. Morgan's Second Letter to the Four London Ministers,’ 1722. 4. ‘Greatness of the Divine Love,’ a sermon. 5. ‘Greatness of the Divine Love Vindicated,’ 2nd edit. 1727. 6. ‘Appendix to the “Greatness &c., Vindicated,”’ 1729. 7. ‘Essay concerning Liberty, Grace, and Prescience,’ 1729. 8. ‘Apology, or Letter to a Friend setting forth the occasion, &c., of the Present Controversy’ (between Fancourt and Messrs. Bliss and Norman), 2nd edit. 1730. 9. ‘What will be must be, or Future contingencies no contingencies, in a Letter to the Rev. John Norman,’ Salisbury, 1730. 10. ‘Appendix to a Letter to the Rev. Mr. Norman,’ 3rd edit. 1732. 11. ‘Greatness of the Divine Love further Vindicated in Reply to Mr. Millar's “Principles of the Reformed Churches,”’ 1732. 12. ‘Free Agency of Accountable Creatures,’ 1733. 13. ‘Nature and Expediency of the Gospel Revelation and of a Public Ministry,’ a sermon with appendices, 1733. 14. ‘Union and Zeal among Protestants,’ 2nd edit. 1745. 15. ‘Seasonable Discourse on a Slavish Fear of Man and a Holy Trust in God, suited to the Alarms and Danger of the Present Time.’ 16. ‘Nature and Advantage of a Good Education, a Sermon preached in St. Thomas's, for the benefit of the Charity School in Gravel Lane, Southwark,’ 1746."

  "text" : "Shahira Amin (Arabic: شهيرة أمين) is an Egyptian journalist, the former deputy head of Egyptian state-owned Nile TV and one of its senior anchors. She resigned from the position on February 3, 2011, allegedly due to her disapproval of the channel's coverage of the Egyptian Revolution of 2011. She also said that they don't approve we air about Tahrir protests and we are only allowed to cover the pro-Mubarak ones. Shahira Amin has been a correspondent for CNN's weekly program Inside Africa for 8 years. Amin became the subject of criticism after she interviewed Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit on October 18, 2011 in Egypt, following Shalit's release from more than five years of captivity in Gaza but preceding his return to Israel and reunification with his family. Israeli officials and various commentators said the interview, which they alleged was held in the presence of armed, masked Hamas militants, broke the ethical rules of journalism and violated the terms of Shalit's release.  Disputing that the interview was held in the presence of armed Hamas militants, Amin stated that it is \"true that he was brought in by armed Hamas men, but in the room itself there were only Egyptian intelligence people. They didn't intervene, and neither did the Hamas men\". She described the criticism as \"incorrect\" stating \"I'm a journalist, and any journalist would want to conduct an interview that would be aired all over the world\".  Amin also defended the interview by saying that it was conducted \"after he had been released by Hamas and had a medical checkup by the Red Cross.\" But a Red Cross spokesman later said that no such medical check-up took place. During the interview, Amin asked Shalit why Egypt had successfully brokered his release, and what he would like to say to Egypt. Amin subsequently explained, \"For five years Mubarak made promises and nothing happened, and now, eight months after his removal, things started moving and resulted in a deal, and I believe the [Egyptian] government and the [Egyptian] military council are due credit\". As a result, Amin was criticized for producing \"a propaganda video\" and \"fishing for compliments for Egypt.\" Amin also asked Shalit why the world heard from him \"just once\" while he was in captivity, and she asked him, \"What has the experience taught you?\" This prompted one commentator to opine that Amin's interview \"questions ranged from the illogical to the ridiculous.\"  Other journalists characterized the interview as \"merciless\" and \"insensitive\""

She is significant as an early example of influential women whose non-fiction writings were addressed to a wide audience regardless of the sex of the reader. Given the wealth of her writings that survive and which are now beginning to become widely available as online resources, there is a puzzling lack of scholarship on Hume.

  "text" : "Sergei Aleksandrovich Vinogradov (April 16, 1958 – December 16, 2010) was a Russian journalist, translator and writer. He worked for the UN from 1986 until his death. Sergei Vinogradov was born in Kurgan, Kurgan Oblast, Russian SFSR in 1958. In 1960, however, he moved to Moscow with his family as his father was promoted to a new position there. He attended school from 1965 to 1975 and was involved in school bands during his senior years (playing the guitar). From 1975 to 1980, Sergey Vinogradov studied international journalism at the Moscow State Institute of International Relations. Upon graduation, he received a job at the International Life (Mezhdunarodnaya Zhizn) magazine. Apart from writing articles for the magazine, Vinogradov also wrote short stories which remained unpublished, however (partially due to their critical tone towards the Soviet authorities). In 1985, he was able to get enrolled in the UN translation courses. Upon completion, he passed the final exams and became a UN translator in New York City. Soon after his arrival to New York City, he was nearly killed in a car accident (as a passenger). However, upon his recovery, he resumed his work as a translator. In 1990, he was transferred to the Department of Political and Security Council Affairs as a Political Affairs Officer and in 1991 began writing for the UN Chronicle (as a member of the Department of Public Information). In 1997, he briefly returned to Moscow to work for the local United Nations Information Center. In December 1997, he came back to New York. In 1999, he became an Information Officer for the UNMIK and lived in Pristina for three years. In 2002, he moved to the UN Office at Geneva, where he once again became a translator (translating from English to Russian). During his tenure at the UN, Sergey Vinogradov continued writing short stories and also started writing longer novels. One of the novels, Sealed-up Hell (Запломбированный Ад), along with several short stories, was published in 2006. He wrote another novel, Heavenly Seedlings (Райская Рассада), but it remained unpublished. He began working on a third novel, provisionally titled A History of Time Travel, but it remained unfinished. Sergey Vinogradov was married twice; his first marriage ended with divorce, while his second marriage ended with his death. He had a son from his first marriage. In June 2010, he was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer and began a course of chemotherapy, which was ultimately unsuccessfully, as the cancer had metastasized to his liver. He died on December 16, 2010 in Carouge, Geneva, Switzerland."

  "text" : "Sheikh Mohammad Rohani(1220-1305 AD)(Pashto:شيخ محمد روحانى) also known as Shah Mohammad Rohani and Rohani Ba Ba was a Sufi cleric born around 1220 AD. The cleric, whose shrine in southern Afghanistan attracts thousands of Sufi visitors every year, is said to have migrated to current day Afghanistan in the later parts of the 13th century AD during the decline of the Abbasid Caliphate in Baghdad. He was a disciple of the renowned Sheikh Rukn-e-Alam. The demise of the Abbasid dynasty in Baghdad in 1258 AD triggered a mass exodus of Islamic scholars and spiritual leaders from Baghdad fearing persecution at the hands of Turko-Mongol invaders. Some of the Abbasid members migrated westward and established yet another dynasty in Egypt that lasted until 1519. Most of the Abbasid cadre migrated southeastward to Iran, Central Asia, Afghanistan, and parts of India. The descendants of Sheikh Mohammad Rohani in the Bannu region of Pakistan and parts of Western Afghanistan identify as \"Shah,\" \"Said\" or \"Sheikh\" to claim hereditary spiritual honor. Afghan ethnographers refer to the descendants of Sheikh Mohammad Rohani as Sayyid. Sheikh Mohammad Rohani is also said to have converted some remote Afghan tribes to Islam. He was the spiritual leader, \"Pir,\" of the Banuchi tribe in Bannu where the cleric is still held in great esteem. According to Mohammad Hayat Khan, the author of the acclaimed reference book on Afghan tribes Hayat-i-Afghani, Sheikh Mohammad Rohani and his son Sheikh Naikbin aided the Banuchi tribe gain control of the Bannu region after Mangal and Hani tribes reneged on their promises to deliver the customary ten percent tax to the family of the Sheikh. The descendants of the Sheikh were allowed to collect and appropriate local taxes during the reign of Mogul emperor Aurangzeb Alamgir but the emperor's son Bahadur Shah discontinued this trend. Nevertheless the Sheikhan of Bannu were exempt from Mogul and later Durrani taxes until 1847 when Sir Herbert Edwardes, a British colonial officer, levied six percent tax on the annual income of the tribe. Following the imposition of colonial taxes large numbers of this community migrated to southern Afghanistan."

He served as the minister of the First Baptist Church of Swansea from 1685 until his death. He also served as a militia captain. Through his wife Mary Abell, daughter of Robert Abell, his descendants have richly documented English ancestry, including extensive ties to royalty and nobility. Samuel Luther perhaps survived a raid by a group of Lenape Indians at age nine while accompanying his father on a trading voyage to Delaware Bay, and was held captive for a period. His father, Captain John Luther, was killed in the raid. Some chroniclers question the likelihood of a nine-year-old boy participating in such a risky trading endeavor, proposing that an older brother may have been the captive Luther. However, no older son of Captain Luther is acknowledged by genealogical authorities. In any event, the general circumstances of the incident are corroborated by several primary sources."

Dashew has been issued fourteen U.S. patents directly, and more than fifty assigned to his many companies. He has created mechanical systems in the business data, banking, shipping, mining, transportation, marine recreation, water purification, and medical-health industries. These included the Databosser and Datawriter under Dashew Business Machines, the single point mooring buoy in Imodco (SBM Offshore), the Dashaveyor mining cars and people transport, a ship bow thruster under the Omnithruster Company, liquid aeration and oxygenation treatments through Omniphaser, wastewater purification system for Biomixer, Inc., and personal spinal decompression mobility devices under the title Dashaway on YouTube—the latter developed and marketed under his oversight, while in his nineties, from 2005 to 2010."

Rosenfeld, washingtonpost.com) The Post wrote on his death that the ones he was proudest of were a series of editorials calling for the release from internal exile in the Soviet Union of Russian physicist Andrei Sakharov. According to the Post, Sakharov, after his release in 1986, visited Washington and asked to speak to the person who had written the editorials. Rosenfeld was the author with his wife, Barbara, of Return From Red Square (1967) about his time as the Post's Moscow chief in Moscow in 1964, and The Time of Their Dying (1977) about his parents' death."

He also wrote his own music, and performed himself as a chanter or singer. The figure of Simon Karas is highly controversial, and it strongly divides Byzantine music scholars and performers into two camps: one supporting, and one opposing his philosophy and his works.

Ali's father personally saw to his education which was deeply rooted in the religion of Islam but he also received instruction from other Islamic and philosophical scholars from around their city of residence. While Ali was still young, his father, who held the position of Qazi in Dholpur, was dismissed from this role and he chose to move their family to Agra. From here Ali continued his studies which led to his philosophical and theological questioning of his childhood religion of Islam. Ali's questioning led to what he called a three-year struggle through the Christian and Mohammedan scriptures as well as other works of controversy pertaining to either faith. At the end of his three-year journey, Ali finally attained what he called his full assurance of salvation. He was finally baptized on Christmas Day in 1864."

  "text" : "Stephanie Skabo (born May 23, 1983 in Greenwich, Connecticut, USA), is an American/Norwegian figurative painter and photographer. Themes and styles in Skabo´s work reference anecdotes and narratives, while primary influences by Andy Warhol and Robert Rauschenberg, place her work as a contemporary \"Pop Art\" artist. Skabo works with mixed medias, her main tools are photography and painting. The picture composition is mainly made out of iconic motives with textual reflection. Typical motives are cars, buildings, monuments and commodity products. There is a hint of political agenda in her pictures with a strong aspiration towards feminine ideals."

Sidi Fredj Halimi was born on October 23, 1876 in Constantine, shortly after all the Jews of Algeria received French nationality following the Crémieux Decree in 1870. He died on September 25, 1957, the eve of Jewish New Year, and was buried in the Jewish cemetery in this city. His death occurred a short time before the massive emigration of virtually all Algerian Jews, following the events of Algerian war (1961–63). Sidi Fredj Halimi was the spiritual father of the Jews living in Constantine, and his reputation spread during his life far beyond that city, in Algeria as well in the neighboring countries of North Africa and in the Jewish community of France. He also maintained a correspondence with famous rabbis from different European countries. So far he is still one of the most revered figures of Algerian Judaism in France and in Israel. In recognition for his work for the nation, Sidi Fredj Halimi received from the French government the order of Knight of the Legion of Honour."

  "text" : "Savva Ivanovich Chevakinsky (Russian: Савва Иванович Чевакинский) (1709 – aft. 1774) was a Russian architect of the Baroque school. He worked in St. Petersburg and Tsarskoe Selo. Chevakinsky was born into a noble family in the village of Veshki in the Novotorzhsk district of Tver province. In 1729 he entered the Naval Academy in St. Petersburg, from whence he was assigned to the Izmaylovsky Life Guards Regiment in 1734. At the request of the Admiralty board he was discharged for unauthorized absence from the Academy and apprenticed to the architectural company of Ivan Korobov, under whose direction he worked for seven years. In 1739 Chevakinsky began his independent career. From 1741 to 1767 he was chief architect for the Admiralty Board. From 1745 to 1760 he was an architect at Tsarskoe Selo, supervising the reconstruction of the palace and surrounding park. Here Chevakinsky erected two buildings (a church and a hall) connected by galleries to the central part of the palace, erected the \"Monbizhu\" pavilion (which housed palace officials), and participated in the creation of the \"Hermitage\" pavilion\". Chevakinsky's largest building in St. Petersburg was the St. Nicholas Naval Cathedral (1753–1762) with a separate tiered bell tower (1756–1758). He also rebuilt the Kunstkamera, the museum of anthropology and ethnography established by Peter the Great. Chevakinsky also designed large private homes. For the Sheremetev family, he built the Fountain House (1750–1755) on the Fontanka Embankment, which building now houses the Anna Akhmatova Literary and Memorial Museum. For the Shuvalov family, he built a mansion at the corner of Malaya Sadovaya Street and Italyanskaya Street (1749–1756, rebuilt in the 19th century), which building later housed the Imperial Ministry of Justice (1802 to 1917) and is today home to the Museum of Hygiene. From 1755 to 1758 Chevakinsky was an architect for the Imperial Academy of Sciences. During those years he taught Vasili Bazhenov and Ivan Starov. According to some sources, Chevakinsky died between 1774 and 1780; according to other sources, he died in 1783."

  "text" : "(This article is about the Indian screenwriter. For the Indian artist (1911-83), see S. N. Swamy (artist).) S. N. Swamy is an Indian screenwriter who works in Malayalam cinema. Particularly known for scripting films in the thriller genre, he has scripted some of the biggest hits in Malayalam film history including the CBI film series (Oru CBI Diary Kurippu, Jagratha, Sethurama Iyer CBI and Nerariyan CBI), Koodum Thedi, Irupatham Noottandu, Moonnam Mura, 1 August, Naduvazhikal, Adikkurippu, Parampara, Dhruvam, and Nariman. Though he is best known for the association with directors K. Madhu and Joshiy, he has also associated with other major directors in a few films. Recently,he appeared in a movie with Mammootty. He played the role of a layman in the A.K.Sajan movie named 'Puthiya Niyamam'. Swamy is the creator of some of the well-known fictional characters in Malayalam cinema including the most famous Sethurama Iyer (portrayed by Mammootty) and Sagar Alias Jacky (portrayed by Mohanlal). Sethurama Iyer, a CBI officer and the protagonist of the CBI film series, was based on a real life police officer called Radhavinod Raju who retired as Chief of India's National Investigative Agency. The four time portrayal of the same character by the same actor (Mammootty) under the same director-writer team (K. Madhu and S. N. Swamy) was a first in Indian cinema. Sagar Alias Jacky, a notorious gold smuggler, was the protagonist in Irupatham Noottandu and the eponymous Sagar alias Jacky Reloaded. The characters Tharadas (originally created by John Paul for the 1984 blockbuster Athirathram) and Inspector Balram (created by T. Damodaran for the 1986 blockbuster Aavanazhi), both portrayed by Mammootty, came together in Balram vs. Tharadas through his script. DySP Perumal, another cop enacted by Mammootty, appeared in two films: 1 August and its sequel 15 August. Another character which has a cult following is Ali Imran, a cop played by Mohanlal in Moonnam Mura. His Total films (Scripts) 42, Mammootty played 26 films, Mohanlal played 10 films, Mammootty and Mohanlal jointly acted 2 films, Suresh Gopi acted in 8 films."

  "text" : "Susan Barnes Crosland (23 January 1927 – 26 February 2011) was an American journalist and novelist who was resident in London for more than fifty years. She was the widow of the Labour Party politician Anthony Crosland. Born Susan Barnes Watson in Baltimore, Maryland, the descendant of passengers on the Mayflower, she was the daughter of Mark Skinner Watson, a defence correspondent for The Baltimore Sun, later the publication's editor, and Susan Owens who was also a journalist. She graduated from Vassar College and taught at the Baltimore Museum of Art. In 1952 she married Patrick Skene Catling, then working with her father, and relocated to London in 1956 when Catling was posted to the London office of The Baltimore Sun. At a party during the year she met Anthony Crosland shortly after The Future of Socialism, his most significant book, had been published. Her first marriage collapsed in 1960, and she and Crosland married in 1964; they kept separate residences at first. By now she had begun to write for British newspapers, originally as Susan Barnes. Taken on by John Junor of The Sunday Express just prior to her divorce, she freelanced after her second marriage, and specialised in writing features and profile articles. Following a period on the pre-Murdoch The Sun, Crosland worked for The Sunday Times from 1970. Noted for her profiles she insisted on not interviewing the wives of 'great men' feeling that \"they wanted to perpetuate the image\". Labour politician Tony Benn though, one of her subjects and a friend of her husband, persuaded Crosland not publish an article dedicated to himself (he had been allowed to vet it) which Benn considered unflattering. The interview was eventually published in The Spectator during October 1987. Anthony Crosland had a fatal stroke in February 1977. His wife had strongly supported him throughout his periods as a Cabinet Minister, culminating in his appointment as Foreign Secretary in 1976, was pressed to stand as the Labour candidate for his Grimsby constituency in the subsequent by-election. She declined, but subsequently wrote a well-received biography of him published in 1982. One friend she acquired in this period via the biography, Therese Lawson, second wife of the Conservative politician Nigel Lawson, once spoke of the impression Crosland made on her:Some people make a deliberate stage entrance. Susan isn't like that but she does have a definite presence. Her voice has a slow, gentle, appealing laugh to it. It's not in the least bit raucous. Susan is much too ladylike for that. She has a particular American sense of humour which I appreciate. Resuming her writing career, a biography of Anthony Blunt fell through after Crosland had already spent a third of the advance. George Weidenfeld, her publisher, suggested a novel instead, the result Ruling Passions appeared in 1989, the first of several works of fiction ending with The Politician's Wife in 2001. Crosland also assembled two volumes of collected journalism. By the mid-1980s, Crosland had formed a deep platonic relationship with the conservative journalist Auberon Waugh which lasted until his death in 2001. By then she had begun to suffer from severe arthritis, thought to have had its origins in a riding accident she had suffered at eighteen, and acquired the MRSA bacterium while in hospital having a hip replaced; the infection went undiagnosed for some time. Susan Crosland was survived by her first husband and their two daughters."

  "text" : "Sonja Maria Barend (born 29 February 1940, in Amsterdam) is a Dutch television personality and former talk show host. Her talk show Sonja, which she presented since the 1970s, was noted for breaking taboos and allowing ordinary people a voice in public dialog. She retired from television in 2006, after four decades of television making. Barend has worked for television since 1966. From the late 1970s on she presented her own weekly talk show for the (socialist) VARA broadcasting organization, a show whose name was based on the day of transmission, e.g. Sonja op Maandag (\"Sonja on Monday\"). In 1996 Sonja op Zaterdag (\"Saturday\") came to an end, after the retirement of Ellen Blazer, her regular producer, with whom she collaborated from the beginning of her television career. Her show, which featured interview and public discussion, was known for allowing ordinary people to have their say. This included, for instance, the viewpoints of ethnic minorities, and relied to a great extent on Barend's personality and commitment. Barend was outspoken on political and ideological topics, and television viewers either loved or hated her. Especially in the 1970s and 1980s she was never afraid to openly discuss taboo topics—homosexuality, feminism, emancipation, and sexuality. According to Marcel van Dam, chairman of the VARA from 1985 on to 1995, she personified the public's negative perception of the VARA (ill-tempered, moralistic), but he could not imagine how the VARA would have survived without her. From 1997 until 2002 she and Paul Witteman had a daily news and talk program, B&W. She officially retired from making television in 2006, and on the occasion of her last Sonja show, was awarded as Officer of the Order of Orange-Nassau by Job Cohen, then-mayor of Amsterdam. That last episode, which included an overview of her career and a number of notable television personalities, received a subtitle, \"En morgen gezond weer op!\" (\"And tomorrow, wake up healthy\"), in reference to her usual closing of her TV shows. Gezond Weer Op is also the title of a collection of interviews culled from her shows. An annual award for best television interview is named after her."

  "text" : "Stephen \"Steve\" Robert Dacri (March 22, 1952 – February 11, 2011) was an accomplished sleight-of-hand magician who worked for nearly 30 years at his craft earning him the moniker \"The Fastest Hands in the World.\" He was born in Worcester, Massachusetts, attended Worcester Polytechnic Institute, and died on February 11, 2011 from colon cancer, leaving a wife, Jan, and a son, Jesse. Dacri's interest in magic began at the age of six when his parents gave him a Mandrake the Magician magic set. Within a few years, he was performing magic at family and community gatherings. “I grew up watching Red Skelton, Abbott & Costello, The Three Stooges, The Amazing Ballantine and Jackie Gleason. I always knew I wanted to be able to entertain people like they did,” Steve wrote. Dacri's joy in entertaining audiences for the majority of his life was clear to everyone who crossed his path. In a blog post dated March 18, 2010, he wrote: It is obvious to me that most people have never had the chance to see magic in such a setting, performed without props or special sets. To me, this is the real magic, magic that is created in the hands, using age old methods of sleight of hand and misdirection perfected by masters before me. I was lucky to be tutored and coached by the greatest magicians who ever lived, and I owe my success to them. During the show I try to acknowledge them all and we even show a short film clip of the legendary Dai Vernon, whom we called the Professor, as a tribute to the remarkable man who had the distinction of being the only man to fool Houdini. Some nights I even perform the same trick that Vernon used to fool Houdini. To keep things fresh, I am constantly changing things, adding new routines and old ones that I haven't done in many years. I do that for myself as much as for the show. Helps keep me sharp and fresh."

He was later dismissed by Duke Jing of Qi, who apparently listened to hypocrites, falsely accusing Rangju. He was depressed and fell ill, resulting in his death. Little is known about his life due to the lack of historical records, but his thoughts and ideas passed on. His works were later composed into a book called The Methods of the Sima.

He was secluded under Pride's Purge in December 1648. During the Interregnum he prospered for a time in the French trade and was liveryman of the Drapers Company from 1648 to 1651, junior warden from 1651 to 1652 and assistant from 1652 to 1658. He was commissioner for assessment for Staffordshire in 1657. In 1658 he went bankrupt for £20,000. Terrick was commissioner for assessment for Staffordshire from January 1660 to 1663. In April 1660, he was elected MP for Newcastle-under-Lyme in the Convention Parliament. He was commissioner for assessment for Newcastle from August 1660 to 1661. He was deputy receiver of hearth-tax for Denbighshire, Flintshire and Anglesey from 1667 to 1667. Terrick died in 1675 and was buried \"inexpensively\" in the cloisters of St. Nicholas Cole Abbey on 14 October 1675. Terrick married Eleanor Layton, daughter of John Layton of London in about 1628. They had three sons and two daughters. His great-grandson Richard became bishop of London in 1764, but no other member of the family sat in the House of Commons."

  "text" : "Sheikh Shady Alsuleiman (born 1978 in Sydney, Australia) from a Palestinian family who migrated to Australia in the late 1960s. He initially obtained an Ijazah (licence) with Sanad (complete chain back to Muhammad) in complete and sound memorization of the Quran at Darul Uloom Al-Husainiah in Sindh, Pakistan. He then travelled to the Arab world for a six years to continue his Islamic and Arabic studies at numerous Islamic institutions with many well-recognised scholars, primarily in Damascus. In Syria, he studied various Islamic subjects and modules, from Fiqh, Usool Al-Fiqh, Hadith, Mustalah al-hadith, Quranic Science and Tafseer and Arabic studies. He generally focused on and specialised in Arabic and Comparative Fiqh (Islamic Law/Jurisprudence) and received numerous Ijaza's in that field. Shady arrived back to Sydney in early 2001, where he began to be heavily active and involved with the Muslim youth and the second Muslim generation in Australia. He is the founder of one of Australia's largest youth centres known as the UMA in Sydney, and also the founder of Sydney Islamic College that delivers Islamic studies to adults. He also held the position of the secretary of the Australian National Imams Council (ANIC) from 2006 to 2015. He operates from various mosques in Australia, and travels to numerous interstate and overseas countries in which he delivers lectures and participates in many different Islamic conferences and events around the world. Shady Alsuleiman has been described as \"controversial\" by Fairfax newspaper WAtoday. However, he has also been described as \"moderate\" by the Sydney Morning Herald, another Fairfax newspaper. He has been verbally attacked by British extremist Abu Haleema for some of his fatwas. Shady Alsuleiman established the organisation, United Muslims of Australia and in 2016 was elected as the president of Australian National Imams Council (ANIC)."

  "text" : "Shmuel Fershko (Stanisław Ferszko, Samuel FERSZKO, also Fereszko) (1914-1990). Born in Łuck, he was a child prodigy on the piano in Warsaw and then went to Warsaw Conservatory. At the age of 23 he composed the operetta Polowanie na lamparta (The Leopard Hunt) first performed in Warsaw in the theatre 8.30, later in Vienna under the name Salzburg Ausverkauft. He worked at the Heyman-Front Jazz dance band (orchestra led by Zygmunt Heyman and Julian Front) and as a piano soloist in the Paradis, Krzywa latarnia (Crooked Lantern) and F.F. nightclubs. He composed for and accompanied the stage diseuses of the late 1930s: Wiera Gran, Nadieżda Bielicz and Waria Łaska. Some of his greatest hits were Bo to się zwykle tak zaczyna (That's How It Usually Begins), Gdy odejdziesz (When You're Gone) and Maleńka (My Tiny Gal). In 1937 he moved to Palestine and played in the Tel Aviv Małałe theater, as well as Li-La-Lo and Ochel. Known as \"The Israeli Gershwin,\" he was very popular in then-Palestine and later Israel. Many think his songs Beb el Wad, Jeep and Moti are folksongs. In 1952 he was hired by NBC to go to America where he composed tunes, musicals, operettas and directed the NY Symphony Orchestra. He died 1990 in Florida."

Sergey Lomonosov graduated from the Tsarskoye Selo Lyceum with a silver medal in 1817 and then began his career at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. A year later Lomonosov was sent to the Russian embassy in Washington. Upon his return to St Petersburg in 1821, Sergey Lomonosov was sent to Spain to assist Count Mark Bulgari (a Russian charge d'affairs). After some time he was transferred to Paris as a secretary at the Russian embassy, where he remained until 1829. In 1831, Sergey Lomonosov was appointed charge d'affairs to Copenhagen and then as first secretary to London. In 1841, he was appointed charge d'affairs to Brazil. During his stay in South America, he travelled along the Brazilian coast from Rio de Janeiro to the estuary of the Amazon River and probably became the first Russian ever to introduce this country to Russia. In 1848, Sergey Lomonosov was transferred to Portugal. In 1853, he was appointed envoy extraordinary and minister plenipontentiary at the Dutch Royal Court, keeping this post until his death in 1857.

  "text" : "Dr Suelette Dreyfus is a technology researcher, journalist and writer. Her fields of research include information systems, digital security and privacy, the impact of technology on whistleblowing, health informatics and e-Education. Her work examines digital whistleblowing as a form of freedom of expression and the right of dissent from corruption. She is a researcher and lecturer in the Department of Computing and Information Systems at the University of Melbourne Her most recent work in e-Health has focussed on the patient information experience in the health system and the role of technology in error incident reporting in hospital settings. She has co-invented innovative prototypes in information design for pathology reports with the aim of transforming them from simple lab information outputs, into multi-layered information tools. These tools would then allow doctors to improve communication with patients, and then patients with their families regarding status of disease in progressive and chronic illnesses, such as diabetes. In such diseases patient adherence to lifestyle, exercise, diet and medication regimes can have significant impact on diseases progression. Knowledge and understanding of disease status has been shown to improve adherence. Her research in e-Education has focussed on using social media to teach foreign language to English-speaking primary school students, particularly for difficult languages that require more hours of practice such as Asian languages. She is the Principal Researcher on an international research project on the impact of digital technologies on whistleblowing. Dreyfus is described as having particular interest in digital whistleblowing, health informatics, computer security and organisational change. Dreyfus has written on the importance of protecting Freedom of Information access (FOI), the problems of information asymmetry and ‘tool asymmetry’ between the individual citizen and the state, and the trend of ‘security clearance creep’. She stated, ‘Information Systems are a good way to organize data, but they’re not a form of democratic, free and open government.’ She gave a speech to 300 senior civil servants in Australia on this topic at the ANZSOG annual conference in August 2015. She is the author of the 1997 cult classic Underground: Hacking, Madness and Obsession on the Electronic Frontier. The book describes the exploits of a group of Australian, American, and British hackers during the late 1980s and early 1990s, among them Julian Assange who is credited as researcher for the book. The book was first published under the Mandarin imprint (Random House Australia). The author subsequently released it in e-version in 2001 for free, which was unusual at the time for a professional published author at a major publishing house. More than 400,000 copies of the book were downloaded for free in the following two years. She donated the e-book to Project Gutenberg’s library so it would be available in perpetuity to the public, in various text formats, for free. The introduction written specifically for the Project Gutenberg edition states that another purpose of the donation was so that the book would be easily accessible by the vision-impaired. In 2011, a new edition of the book was published, with updated chapters. The book has average a reader score of 4.8 out of 5 stars on Amazon. On Goodreads the book has an average score of 4.15 out of 5 based on 373 ratings. Underground has been translated into seven other languages, including French, German, Spanish, Japanese, Chinese (simplified), Chinese (traditional) and Russian. The German edition incorporated a QR reader code into the front cover design which took the reader to a secret recorded audio message about the book. The fact that the cover design was actually a functional QR code was not publicised nor documented inside the book itself, but was left for the curious reader to discover on his or her own. Thus it echoed the hacker discovery experiences described in the work’s literary non-fiction stories. It was published in 2012 by German publisher Heyne Taschenbuch in paperback, having been first published in hardback by Benediction Classics in Berlin in 2011. The German, French and Spanish editions of the books have different introductions and/or conclusions, with unique commentary for each edition, written by Dreyfus. Dreyfus is represented by literary agents Curtis Brown in Australia and the UK. Dreyfus was an Associate Producer for the documentary In the Realm of the Hackers, inspired by Underground, in 2003. Underground was also the basis for a 2012 film by Australian screenwriter and director Robert Connolly. She has been a contributor to The Sydney Morning Herald, The Australian, The Independent and The Age, as well as to radio programs including the Australian Broadcasting Corporation's Late Night Live with Philip Adams. She trained and worked as a staff reporter on a daily newspaper in Australia. In 2015 and 2016, Dreyfus has run training for journalists in a major media organisation and in a journalism school on digital and physical methods of protecting sources and data. Her essays have also appeared in The Conversation, discussing the importance of protecting public access to strong encryption, the need for legal protections for whistleblowers, and the security paradox of legislation enforcing retention of metadata for two years for everyone in Australia."

His most recent effort is a novel, time-oriented programming language, called Flapjax, in support of asynchronous web programming. Krishnamurthi also authored a textbook on programming language design. In 2012, Krishnamurthi became the inaugural winner of the Robin Milner Young Researcher Award, given by SIGPLAN to a researcher whose research career began within 20 years of the nomination date. The award citation describes Krishnamurthi as \"a prolific researcher who brings programming language theory to bear in many other disciplines, thus exposing its foundational value\"."

Ben-Arie holds an undergraduate degree in political science, sociology and anthropology from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and a graduate degree in government and public policy. While in his studies he represented Israel in numerous international forums, including his selection as a sole representative from his country to the International Youth Leadership Conference. In 2015 he took part in an election observation mission in Estonia. In 2004, Ben-Arie initiated a gathering of all women to serve throughout the years in the Israeli parliament – the Knesset. Preparations to the event led to his initiative documenting the lives and public actions of all female Knesset members. Over the years of writing his book, Ben-Arie has had personal contact with 70 of Israel's female MKs. His book was published on International Women's Day in 2011 and introduced to the public for the first time by Knesset member Tzipi Hotovely in a festive sitting of the parliamentary committee on the status of women. Alongside the life stories of all women to serve in the Israeli parliament in the years 1949-2011, a historical chapter includes a first of its kind listing of women who served in the Assembly of Representatives during the British Mandate for Palestine. It has been nominated for several awards at Yad Ben Zvi, Shazar Center for Jewish History and the Israeli Ministry of Culture and Sport. Ben-Arie lectures in Israel and abroad on women in Israeli politics. In December 2012 he led five sessions at the International Limmud Conference held at Warwick University and in 2014 a new series of twelve lectures was issued, focusing on women members of the First Knesset. The Women's Parliament organization honored his \"contribution to the public awareness of women's leadership\" with a \"Man of the Year\" title for 2012-13. In 2011 he began volunteering with Yad Levi Eshkol."

  "text" : "Sarah Catherine Vogel FLS (née Darwin; born 14 April 1964 in London) is a British botanist. She is the daughter of George Erasmus Darwin, a metallurgist, and his wife Shuna (née Service). She has two older brothers; Robert George Darwin (born 1959) and the conservationist Chris Darwin (born 1961). She is descended from Charles Darwin via Charles's son George Howard Darwin (1845–1912); his son William Robert Darwin (1894–1970), a stockbroker, and his wife Sarah Monica (née Slingsby) were the parents of George Erasmus Darwin (1927-). Sarah Darwin first visited the Galapagos Islands in 1995 with her parents and brother Chris on holiday. She stayed behind to prepare botanical illustrations for a field guide to the Islands. She is an ambassador for the conservation charity Galapagos Conservation Trust. She gained a BSc in Botany from Reading University in 1999 and a PhD from University College London in 2009. Her PhD thesis was entitled The systematics and genetics of tomatoes on the Galápagos Islands. Her supervisors were Sandra Knapp, James Mallet and Ziheng Yang. She has been married to German botanist Johannes Vogel, former Keeper of Botany at the Natural History Museum and now Director General of the Museum für Naturkunde in Berlin, since 2003, with whom she has two sons, Leo Erasmus Darwin Vogel (born 2003) and Josiah Algy Darwin Vogel (born 2005). In 2005 the family, along with other descendants of Charles Darwin, including George Erasmus Darwin, and Chris Darwin were involved in counting the flowers at Down House. She wrote a foreword for the 2009 book Galapagos: Preserving Darwin's Legacy by Tui de Roy. In 2009, Darwin was reported in various media outlets as having \"won\" a \"talking to plants competition\" against ten others. In the experiment, tomato plants grew the most when subjected to Darwin reading extracts from The Origin of Species. She appeared in the 2009–10 Dutch VPRO television series Beagle: In Darwin's wake in which she, with her husband and children, along with others such as Redmond O'Hanlon, participated in a recreation of Charles Darwin's voyage on HMS Beagle on board of the sailing ship Stad Amsterdam. She attended the Science & Technology Summit at the World Forum Convention Center in The Hague on 18 November 2010, at which O'Hanlon was also a featured guest."

  "text" : "Stephen Adolphus Caldwell (March 1, 1889 – April 16, 1956) was an American educator originally from the village of Bienville in Bienville Parish in North Louisiana, best known for A Banking History of Louisiana, originally published in 1935. Caldwell's parents were J. D. Caldwell and the former Cordelia Whitney. He did not receive his Bachelor of Arts degree, from Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge, until 1925, when he was thirty-six years of age. He procured a Master of Arts and Ph.D. from the University of Texas at Austin in 1927 and 1934, respectively. In 1911, at the age of twenty-two and without a college degree, Caldwell became the principal of Ringgold High School in Ringgold, also in Bienville Parish. It appears that he had no classroom experience before becoming principal. Caldwell was thereafter in the 1914-1915 school year the principal at Amite City High School in Tangipahoa Parish, one of the Louisiana Florida Parishes in southeastern portion of the state. Caldwell then served from 1915-1922 in Bastrop as school superintendent in Morehouse Parish north of Monroe in north Louisiana. He was an associate professor at Louisiana Tech University in Ruston from 1922–1926, by which time he had received his bachelor's degree. From 1931-1934, he was an instructor at the University of Texas while engaged there in graduate studies. From 1936-1937, Caldwell became dean of the University of Louisiana at Monroe, then known as Northeast Center of LSU, not yet having attained four-year status. He was an assistant professor and then professor at his alma mater, LSU, from 1934 to 1944, including his stint at Monroe. Thereafter, he was named dean of the LSU Junior Division, having held his terminal position from 1944 until his death at the age of sixty-seven. Caldwell's A Banking History of Louisiana examines five chronological periods from the 18th century until 1930. The work was reprinted by Louisiana State University Press in 1980 and is partly carried by Google Books. In his study, Caldwell examines the Reconstruction era under Governors Henry Clay Warmoth and William Pitt Kellogg and the repudiation of part of the inclusive state debt of then $24 million. Caldwell also authored Economic Development of the Shreveport Trade Area (1943), a look at the economic growth about Shreveport, the largest city in North Louisiana. He also contributed articles to various legal, business, and social science journals. He was active in the administration of the Boy Scouts of America. He was a member and past president of the Baton Rouge Lions Club. On June 1, 1929, he married the former Grace Martin, and the couple had two children. Caldwell died in Baton Rouge and is interred there at Roselawn Memorial Park."

  "text" : "Sultan Haydar (pronounced [sulˈtɑn ˈhajdaɾ]; born May 23, 1985 in Golerogi, Ethiopia) is an Ethiopian-born Turkish female long-distance runner. The 170 cm (5 ft 7 in) tall athlete at 55 kg (121 lb) is a member of Enkaspor, where she is coached by Nikola Borić. Born Chaltu Girma Meshesha in Ethiopia, she started off her career as a middle distance runner and was the bronze medalist in the 800 metres at the 2005 African Junior Athletics Championships. Her final international appearance for Ethiopia came at the 2006 African Championships in Athletics, where she showed a talent for racewalking as she came sixth in the women's 20 km walk. She transferred her eligibility to Turkey in 2008. Haydar's first competition for Turkey was the 2008 European Cross Country Championships. She started the women's under-23 race quickly but yielded her early lead and dropped out at the halfway point. She was the 1500 metres gold medalist at the 2009 European Athletics U23 Championships, then won the under-23 race at the 2009 European Cross Country Championships later that year. At the beginning of 2011 she made her debut over the half marathon and recorded a time of 1:10:02 hours for seventh place at the high calibre RAK Half Marathon. She ran in the 1500 m at the 2010 European Athletics Championships, but failed to finish her heat. She turned to the 3000 metres at the 2011 European Athletics Indoor Championships, where she set a personal best of 9:03.50 minutes to win her heat, but was slower in the final, coming in ninth place. Outdoors, she competed for Turkey on home soil for the First League of the 2011 European Team Championships and won the 3000 m in a long-distance event sweep with Alemitu Bekele Degfa and Binnaz Uslu. Haydar also won the bronze in the 1500 m. She was the leader for much of the 2011 Istanbul Marathon, but slowed after 35 km and eventually finished seventh. The 2012 Paris Marathon saw her establish herself as a top level marathon runner. In spite of being well-beaten by winner Tirfi Tsegaye Beyene, Haydar improved her best by over ten minutes to set a Turkish national record mark of 2:25:07 hours in second place. Sultan Haydar qualified for participation in the marathon event at the 2012 Summer Olympics but managed only 72nd place with a slow time of 2:38:26 hours. She ended the year with a third-place finish at the Istanbul Marathon. In her first marathon of 2013, she came third at the Rome City Marathon with a time of 2:27:10 hours. On November 17, 2013, Sultan Haydar repeated her third-place success at the Istanbul Marathon finishing with 2.29.40 after her countrywoman Elvan Abeylegesse."

  "text" : "Seligman (Isaac) Baer was a masoretic scholar, and an editor of the Hebrew Bible and of the Jewish liturgy. He was born in Mosbach, the northern district of Biebrich, Sept. 18, 1825 and died at Biebrich-on-the-Rhine, March, 1897. Baer commenced his Masoretic studies as early as 1844. He belonged to the school of Wolf Heidenheim, and had in his possession some of Heidenheim's original manuscripts and personal copies of his published works with handwritten marginal notes. Few scholars in the nineteenth century had so intimate an acquaintance with all the details of the Masorah as had Baer, and it was largely due to him that the study of this branch of Hebrew philology was brought to the notice of Biblical critics. His friendship with Franz Delitzsch, who stood sponsor for much of his work, aided him in making known to the world the results of his studies. Baer's monumental edition of the Jewish prayerbook according to the Ashkenazic rite, Seder Avodat Yisrael (Rödelheim, 1868), accompanied by a critical commentary, became the authoritative model for numerous editions published subsequently in the 20th century. His editions of the Jewish liturgy also include Kinnot for the fast of the ninth of Av. He never occupied an academic position, but was content with the office of Hebrew teacher to the Jewish community of Biebrich. In recognition of his services to the Commission for the History of the Jews in Germany, the honorary degree of doctor of philosophy was conferred upon him by the University of Leipsic. His edition of the Masoretic Bible was published in cooperation with Delitzsch."

  "text" : "Sybille Gruner (born 18 May 1969) was a member of the women’s national handball team between 1989 and 1995. In 1993 the team won the world championships in a very close game against Denmark. One year later, during the European championship final in Berlin, they played the Danish team again and lost. At the Olympic Games in Barcelona in 1992 the team had high hopes of a medal but placed a disappointing fourth. In the play-off for the bronze medal they lost against the odds-on favourite, Russia. Sybille was born in Erfurt in East Germany. She attended Kinder- und Jugendsportschule in Leipzig, a special school for athletically-talented children. At the age of 16 she was a member of the senior SC Leipzig team that won the European cup. Several national titles with SC Leipzig followed. In 1990 she moved to Leverkusen and played for Bayer 04 Leverkusen for the next 12 years. After the birth of her first daughter and winning the national cup she finished her active career as a handball player. For the next 3 years she worked as co-trainer and, after the birth of her second daughter in 2004, she returned for another year to the coaching bench. Since 2006 she has been working for TNT Innight. She married the former basketball player Bodo Kuczmann in 2004."

  "text" : "The nephew of John Angier, he was born at Dedham 28 August 1639, and was a pupil of Richard Busby. He went to Christ Church, Oxford, in 1659, but was compelled to leave by the Act of Uniformity 1662. After some time staying with John Owen he settled as assistant to his uncle at Denton. His ordination, which took place in 1672 at the house of Robert Eaton in Deansgate, Manchester, was the first presbyterian ordination amongst the nonconformists in the north of England, and perhaps the first in any part of the kingdom. At his uncle's death many people supported Samuel Angier as his successor. The warden and fellows of Manchester, however, were not disposed to appoint another nonconformist, and the Rev. John Ogden was nominated; but great difficulty was experienced in inducing Samuel Angier to give up possession of the house. He retired to the adjacent village of Dukinfield. He had to suffer for his nonconformity, and in 1680 was excommunicated; but under the Act of Toleration in 1689 he became minister of a dissenting meeting at Dukinfield, where a chapel was built for him in 1708. In his later years he was almost blind, and died 8 November 1713. Angier kept a register of 'christenings and some marriages and funerals' from 1677 to 1713. One entry relates to the death, 20 February 1698, of another Samuel Angier, who is believed to have been a minister of the 'ancient chapel' of Toxteth Park, Liverpool."

  "text" : "Shifra Lerer (August 30, 1915 – March 12, 2011) was an Argentine-born American Yiddish theater actress based in New York City. Lerer appeared opposite every major Yiddish theater actor during her career, which lasted 90 years. She was also cast in film roles, including the 1997 Woody Allen film, Deconstructing Harry. Her father, a manager at a soap factory, had immigrated to Argentina from the Russian Empire to escape anti-Semitism and poverty through the sponsorship of philanthropist and banker, Maurice de Hirsch. Lerer was born in the Santa Catalina colony in Argentina on August 30, 1915. Lerer was discovered in Buenos Aires by Yiddish theater legend, producer and actor Boris Thomashefsky, who was starring in the area, when she was just five or eight years old, at the recommendation of her sister (the actress Miryam Lerer). At ten she was participating in Yakov Botashanski's productions in a theater circle. When she was older, she studied at a Spanish-language drama school and performed for three years on the Argentinian stage. She then passed the examinations for the actors' union and became a member, playing with the star Miryam Karalova-Kambarov, then Moyshe Oysher and Florence Weiss, finally playing in serious drama roles with Zygmunt Turkow in Urteyl, Hirsh Lekert, Ivan Kruger and Di glokn-tsier fun Notr-dam (The Bell-ringer (Hunchback) of Notre Dame). She played with Yakov Ben-Ami and Bertha Kalich in Wolf's Profesor Malok, Strindberg's Der Foter, and Leyvick's Der poet is blind gevorn (The poet became blind), with Samuel (Hymie) Goldenberg in Kalmanovich's Hayntike kinder (Kids these days) and with Maurice Schwartz in Singer's Moyshe Kalb. In 1943 she was invited by Samuel Goldberg to perform at the Parkway Theater in Brooklyn (owned by Hymie Jacobson and his brother Irving). Her first performance was in Fun Niu York keyn Berlin; she then toured concertizing at places like the Arbeter Ring, the National Yiddish Workers Union, and Camp Boyberik. In 1946 she went back to Argentina where she worked with Ben-Zion Witler at the Mitre theater and thereafter toured and performed with him (she married Witler in 1957 - he died from a brain tumor in 1961.). She joined the actors' union in 1949 and played in Got, mentsh un tayvl with Mikhal Mikhalesko and Gustav Berger. In 1952 she participated in Herman Yablokoff's production of Benyomin Ressler's Onkl Sem in yisroel (Uncle Sam in Israel) in the Public Theater in New York. She ultimately decided to settle permanently in New York City. Lerer worked actively in the Yiddish theater circuit until she was 90 years old. Her second husband, Yiddish actor Michael Michalovic, died in 1987. She was best friends with the late Yiddish theater actress, Mina Bern, who died in 2010. Shifra Lerer died of a stroke in Manhattan on March 12, 2011, at the age of 95. She was buried in Block 67 of Mount Hebron Cemetery in Flushing, Queens, next to her second husband, Michael Michalovic. The cemetery's Block 67 is reserved for who worked in New York City's Yiddish theater industry. Lerer was buried just rows from Boris Thomashefsky, who discovered Lerer at the age of 5 in Argentina. She had no immediate survivors."

Her career in Hewlett-Packard took off in 1998 and she was General Director for Bulgaria for more than 10 years. During this period she succeeded in establishing the company as the leader in the local IT market. Sasha played significant role for the attracting of a strategic investment from Hewlett-Packard for the construction of the Global Delivery Center in Bulgaria. The project positioned the country on the global investment map and today more than 5000 highly qualified employees work there. Among Sasha’s notable professional achievements is the implementation of a system for new ID, which was a main precondition for Bulgaria's acceptance in the EU visa-free countries list and the free traveling of Bulgarian citizens in the EU."

  "text" : "Sarah Applewood (born Sarah Grimwood, 30 August 1980) is a British stage/film actress and singer who, despite having a long theatrical career is best known to the UK public as the face of 2011 Halifax film and TV campaign. Applewood began her theatrics at an early age performing in her school musical of Trolls! playing the evil goblin Snick. Her weeks were filled with playing the clarinet, saxophone and piano at her local music centre, where she gained a scholarship on clarinet and was lucky enough to share the stage with the legendary John Dankworth. Jazz bands, quartets, quintets, symphonic windbands and orchestras all played a part in her early years until she discovered her love for being on the stage and singing. She then went on to study at Drama at Hull University. Productions here included Snoopy The Musical, Saucy Jack & The Space Vixens, The Wiz and singing in German for the musical Cabaret. The Academy of Live and Recorded Arts in London followed (ALRA) where Applewood gained a Post Graduate Diploma in Professional Acting and met her fiance and the father of her twins. Since graduating Applewood has continued her singing studies with The Royal Academy of Music. She has worked in several new musicals for composers around London and has recorded many tracks for Mercury Musical Developments. TNT's production of A Christmas Carol took her to Germany, Prague, Madrid, The International Festival of Musical Theatre in Greece, Malta's National Theatre 'Manoel Theatre' and to Tokyo, Hiroshima, and Osaka in Japan. Applewood has performed in The Lost Musicals at Londons Sadlers Wells, in NewsRevue (a launch pad for budding comic talent), and in London's West End in Anthology a concert filled with West End regulars for Conor Mitchel. She sang in Venice at The Hilton for Incognito Artists and spent the summer 2010 singing in Athens. She appeared in the 2008 TV Movie Silent Voices, a docudrama about domestic violence in the United Kingdom written by Barbara Gorna, directed by Charles Harris and produced by Paul Atherton."

  "text" : "Shishman, Despot of Vidin (Bulgarian: Шишман; fl. 1270s/1280s — before 1308/1313) was a Bulgarian noble (boyar) who ruled a semi-independent realm based out of the Danubian fortress of Vidin in the late 13th and early 14th century. Shishman, who was bestowed the title of \"despot\" by Bulgarian emperor George Terter I, was a Cuman, and may have been established as lord of Vidin as early as the 1270s. In 1291, he came under Tatar suzerainty and in 1292 he was in charge of an unsuccessful campaign against neighbouring Serbia. Even though the Serbs captured Vidin in their counter-offensive, perhaps thanks to Tatar influence Shishman was placed once more as the ruler of the region, this time as a Serbian vassal. However, he continued to rule his lands largely independently. As his son and successor as despot of Vidin Michael Shishman acceded to the Bulgarian throne in 1323, Shishman was the progenitor of the last medieval Bulgarian royal dynasty, the Shishman dynasty."

In 1778 he was presented to the rectories of Dowlish Wake and Dowlish West, Somersetshire. He graduated B.D. in 1792, and D.D. in 1793. For some years he was one of the city lecturers at Oxford. In 1794 he accepted the college living of Holwell, Dorsetshire, but remained there only about two years, as in 1796 he was appointed provost of Queen's College on the death of Dr. Thomas Fothergill. In 1798 he obtained the Lady Margaret professorship of Divinity at Oxford, to which is annexed a prebend of Worcester Cathedral. His lectures on the Thirty-nine Articles, though much admired at the time of their delivery, have never been printed. He was a frequent preacher before the university. He died at the college lodge on 24 January 1827."

  "text" : "Saidai Samiyappan Duraisamy (born 16 February 1952) is a South Indian politician and, as of 2011, is the incumbent Mayor of the Corporation of Chennai. He is the first All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) candidate to become the Mayor of Chennai. He is the also the founder and Chairman of the Manidhaneyam, a free IAS and IPS coaching centre in Tamil Nadu. He was elected to the Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly in 1984 from the Saidapet constituency. He stayed away from politics after the demise of M. G. Ramachandran.. Jayalalithaa has sprung a surprise ahead of the April 13 assembly polls in Tamil Nadu. She has fielded an AIADMK veteran who has earned a name for himself by running a successful free coaching centre for IAS aspirants to take on the DMK's heir apparent M.K. Stalin. Her choice of Saidai S. Duraisamy for the newly carved Kolathur assembly seat clearly shows that she wants to give the DMK heavyweight a run for his money. A former AIADMK legislator of the MGR era, the dhoti-clad Duraisamy, 59, has proved to be a politician with a difference. During his heyday in politics, he was the powerful AIADMK district secretary in south Chennai. But then, for a long time, the amiable Duraisamy kept a low profile and engaged himself in charitable work. To his credit, he never sought greener pastures and, now, patience and perseverance seem to have worked in his favour. Though it was expected that the seasoned politician would get the party ticket, his name did not figure in the first candidates' list released by 'Amma' last week. In the revised list, however, his name was the cynosure of all eyes and he is already on the campaign trail. But, for this politico, the CM's seat was never a dream; becoming an IAS officer was. When he could not make it, he started helping aspirants, mostly from the poor sections, through his free coaching centre that he launched in 2006. He contested the assembly elections as a candidate for the AIADMK in the Kolathur constituency, which he lost. He contested the mayoral election of Chennai corporation, and became the first AIADMK mayor of the city on 21 October 2011. He won the election by a margin of over 5.19 lakh votes. He took the oath of office on 25 October 2011."

  "text" : "Susan Christie is an American singer-songwriter from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. She had a minor hit with the novelty song \"I Love Onions\" (written by Donald Cochrane and John Hill). The track, which peaked at #63 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in 1966, is described as having a sound reminiscent of the 1930s, with Christie's \"breathy\" vocal backed by a chorus of kazoo players and male backup singers. The song features a harmonica player and a spoken recitation from a male speaker. It ends with an Elmer Fudd type of voice saying, \"How very, very crude\". In Canada, however, the single fared much better, reaching #19 on the RPM 100 national singles chart on August 1, 1966. The tune was adapted as \"I Love Funyuns\" for a late 60's TV commercial for an onion-flavored snack food. The tune was later adapted for a Canadian television commercial as \"I Love Turtles\" in 1980. Signed to Columbia Records, Christie recorded an album in 1970, Paint a Lady. Described as \"psychedelic folk music\", the album went unreleased by Columbia, which considered it to be non-commercial, and Christie was dropped from the label. The album, of which only three vinyl copies were ever pressed, languished in obscurity until 2006, when Manchester-based DJ Andy Votel received a copy and brought the album renewed attention and a CD release. SPIN magazine described the album as \"funky free folk\" filled with \"[b]rilliantly original songs\" and Christie as a \"dark, strange songbird\". Christie participated in the 2008 \"Lost Ladies of Folk\" project spearheaded by Votel and his spouse, recording artist Jane Weaver, performing in concert at Queen Elizabeth Hall in London and appearing on the compilation album Bearded Ladies. In 2010, Christie appeared as a guest artist on Weaver's album The Fallen By Watch Bird."

  "text" : "Shitaye Eshete Habtegebrel (born 21 May 1990) is an Ethiopian-born long-distance runner who competes internationally for Bahrain. She first began competing for the oil-rich Gulf state in 2009, making her debut at the Asian Cross Country Championships in Manama. She won the women's junior title while team-mate Tejitu Daba, another former Ethiopian, completed a Bahraini 1–2. Her debut at the global level came shortly afterwards at the 2009 IAAF World Cross Country Championships and she finished 24th in the junior race, one place behind Daba. She was entered into the 5000 metres race at the 2009 Asian Athletics Championships in November and she came sixth. Shitaye made her senior debut the following year, running at the 2010 IAAF World Cross Country Championships and she was eleventh overall in the rankings, leading the Bahrain women alongside Mimi Belete to ninth place in the team competition. In August she made her first appearance on the IAAF Diamond League, setting a 5000 m best of 15:25.67 minutes at the DN Galan. She was the sole representative for Asia-Pacific in that event at the 2010 IAAF Continental Cup, where she was sixth. The 2010 Asian Games saw her claim her first international medal, as she took third for the bronze medal over 10,000 metres behind Indian duo Preeja Sreedharan and Kavita Raut. She was one place lower than her previous position at the 2011 IAAF World Cross Country Championships, just edging into the top twelve of the women's senior race. However, she led the national team to fourth in the rankings, aided by the presence of Maryam Yusuf Jamal. She performed well on the track that year, taking the 10,000 m title at the 2011 Asian Athletics Championships, the 5000 m title at the 2011 Military World Games, and then breaking the Bahraini record with a run of 31:21.57 minutes to finish sixth in the 10,000 m final at the 2011 World Championships in Athletics. She ended the year with a 5000 m bronze and 10,000 m silver at the 2011 Pan Arab Games. Shitaye began the next season indoors, setting a national record for the 3000 metres to take the title at the 2012 Asian Indoor Athletics Championships. She then finished fifth in the final of that event at the 2012 IAAF World Indoor Championships. Heading outdoors, she won the women's title at the Asian Cross Country Championships, leading a women's sweep of the top three. She took a career break in 2014 to have a child and returned to competition in late 2015."

  "text" : "Sandra Jordan is an Irish television journalist, best known for her investigative visits to many conflict zones around the world for the Channel 4 series Dispatches and Unreported World. She attended Sacred Heart Secondary School in Westport, County Mayo and in 1987 went on to National University of Ireland, Galway for a degree in English. Temping in journalism led her to the foreign news desk at The Observer in London, where she was promoted to Assistant Editor. However, the desk job did not suit her, and she moved into television, making documentaries in Latin America for Channel 4. In March 2003, Jordan was in the Gaza Strip reporting on the Israeli withdrawal from Gaza. She reported on Israeli violence against Palestinians, and interviewed local people and protesters from the International Solidarity Movement within two days of the death of American activist Rachel Corrie. She also covered the killings of British activist Tom Hurndall and filmmaker James Miller. The resulting documentary was aired in June 2003 on Dispatches titled \"The Killing Zone\". As well as repeat visits to Gaza, the West Bank, Sri Lanka and Nepal between 2001 and 2007, she reported from Indian Kashmir, Thailand, Colombia, Bolivia, Venezuela, Peru, El Salvador, Mexico, Haiti and the Paris riots of 2005. Jordan and her team repeatedly risked being caught in crossfire and other dangers. In 2008 she married and returned to Ireland. In 2011 she completed work on her own documentary feature, Little Matador, co-directed with Gabriel Range. The film follows the training of child bullfighters in Mexico."

  "text" : "Dr. Saeb N. Jaroudi (Arabic: صائب جارودي) was the former Minister of National Economy, Industry, and Tourism in Lebanon and a senior economic consultant advising international public and private institutions on economic policy and project finance. He held a number of leadership roles in the Arab world, Europe, and the United States throughout his career. He also served on several Boards and was a long-standing member of the Board of Directors of Arab Finance Corporation. He was elected as the first Chairman of the Board and President of the Kuwait-based Arab Fund for Economic and Social Development by the Arab Ministers of Finance. He established the Fund as the regional development bank of the Arab world, initiating and financing major national and inter-country industrial, agriculture, rural development, power, water, education, and healthcare projects. During his tenure, he also initiated the establishment of the Arab Monetary Fund and the Arab Authority for Agricultural Investment and Development. As minister in Saeb Salam's first cabinet during president Suleiman Frangieh's mandate, Dr. Jaroudi introduced policies that successfully stimulated the development of lesser developed regions of the country, encouraged the flow of foreign direct investment into the country and increased exports through bilateral trade agreements. To promote investment in Lebanon’s industrial sector, he developed and led a pioneering matchmaking program with the United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO), which culminated in the signing of 20 new joint venture projects between Lebanese and foreign investors. His strong United Nations ties began when he joined the UN’s Center for Development Planning in New York as a Senior Economist. During a decade-long UN career, he assisted in the establishment and implementation of several Arab countries’ national development plans. He also assisted the Kuwaiti government in establishing the Kuwait Fund for Arab Economic Development and driving its operations during its early years. Fresh from completing his Master's degree at the University of California, Berkeley and his PhD Studies at Columbia University, Dr. Jaroudi began his professional experience teaching Economics at the American University of Beirut, where he also participated in the pioneering work of the Economic Research Institute on economic development and business legislation in the Middle East. In recognition of his contributions to the economic and social advancement of developing countries, Dr. Jaroudi was elected as a member of the United Nations Committee for Development Policy and UNESCO’s International Fund for the Promotion of Culture. He also served as a member of the Board of Trustees of the Arab British Chamber of Commerce Foundation, the British Lebanese Association, and International College in Lebanon. He was also an elected fellow of The Royal Numismatic Society (RNS), a learned society and charity based in London, United Kingdom whose patron as of 2014 was Queen Elizabeth II. On September 18, 2014, upon the request of the Lebanese Prime Minister Tammam Salam, he was honored by a minute of silence by the Lebanese Council of Ministers at the start of the cabinet meeting."

Under Bogislaw X, Pomerania experienced a golden age: Szczecin was made the residence in 1491, the ducal administration was organised in a chancery, a well-regulated tax collection was introduced and peace and stability were maintained.

As a child in the 1930s, Sherman Junior was already collecting reptiles near his home and learning their scientific names. He wanted to study herpetology, but his father insisted on law or medicine, and he chose medicine, enrolling at Indiana University Bloomington and obtaining his B.S. degree in 1939. Sherman then transferred to Indiana University Medical School and received his M.D. in 1942. He met Madge Alice Shortridge Rutherford (20 March 1920 – 2004) at Bloomington in November 1937, when she introduced herself with the remark \"I understand you collect snakes\". They became friends but did not marry until October 1943 because of World War Two."

He succeeded to the estates of his uncle Henry, and was known as Sir William, the elder. As heir to Susan D'Oyly, his cousin, he came into possession of Pond-hall (Hadleigh), Topsfield, and Cossford, in Suffolk, and Shottisham (now more generally spelled Shotesham), Gostlings, and three manors in Warham, in Norfolk. He was serving abroad in the army of Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden, and remained abroad after Gustavus Adolphus's death until he returned to take possession of the family fortune. He was knighted by King Charles I in 1642, for his gallant behaviour. In 1654, D'Oyly was elected Member of Parliament for Norfolk in the First Protectorate Parliament. He was re-elected MP for Norfolk in 1656 for the Second Protectorate Parliament and in 1659 for the Third Protectorate Parliament. In 1660, D'Oyly was elected Member of Parliament for Great Yarmouth in the Convention Parliament. He was among the most zealous in the convention parliament, for the restoration of the royal family. He was a very accomplished gentleman, and much esteemed in his county. He was one of the commissioners appointed by the House of Commons, to see the army disbanded, in 1661, and was chosen by the city of Norwich, with Sir Horatio Townsend, Sir John Holland, and Sir Ralph Hare, to wait on the King, soon after his return with the resignation of the charter which the king restored. He was re-elected MP for Great Yarmouth in 1661 for the Cavalier Parliament and sat until his death in 1677. In 1663, he was created a baronet, of Shottisham. D'Oyly married Margaret Randall of Pulham, Norfolk. They had six daughters and three sons. He was succeeded in the baronetcy by his son William."

  "text" : "Stan Openshaw (born 10 August 1946) is a retired British geographer. His last post was professor of human geography based in the School of Geography at the University of Leeds. After eighteen years at Newcastle University, including three years as professor of quantitative geography, he moved to work in Leeds in 1992. Stan was a leading researcher in computer-based geography and his work aimed to automate aspects of geographical research and reduce subjectivity in geographical analyses. He worked hard and was not just enthusiastic, but inspirational and catalysed research, developed researchers, projects and collaborations, and helped to evolve geographical information systems, analysis technology and models that in their day were state-of-the-art. Stan is still passionate about geography and keen to learn about the employment of geographical approaches that attempt to make the world a better place. In the past, he debated the direction geography should take putting forward a view that the subject needed an applied and scientific edge that harnessed the growing power of computers to make positive impacts to help us avoid and mitigate risk and cope better with disasters. In 1992 Stan set up the Centre for Computational Geography (CCG) as an inter-disciplinary unit at the University of Leeds, an organisation dedicated to bringing computers to bear on complex social and physical problems. Stan directed the CCG for seven years until suffering a severely disabling stroke in 1999 after which he was retired. Stan became a Fellow of the Royal Geographical Society and a Chartered Statistician in 1993, a Fellow of the Institute of Statisticians in 1983 and was a Member of the British Computer Society from 1983. In 2012 at the GISRUK conference in Lancaster a special session was arranged to celebrate Stan's work and geographical career. A festschrift document about Stan's work and career as a geographer is partially developed. If you have something to add, then please contribute to this work. A short Stan Openshaw Festschrift Film is linked from the festschrift and is available on YouTube on The Stan Openshaw Channel. Also on that channel are edited presentation videos from the GISRUK 2012 special session held in Stan's honour. The Stan Openshaw Festschrift Film features (among others) one of Stan's most brilliant students Danny Dorling. Since his major disabling stroke in 1999 Stan has struggled to communicate verbally and get around, but he is well aware of the world around him and the problems we face. Stan is much diminished now in his abilities to help the world and our society address its problems, but Stan now presents to the world his artwork in the form of acrylic paint on canvas. Stan has been developing his style for a few years and has graduated to selling his works. Like much of Stan's work, it somehow adds an extra dimension to what you might expect. One painting was produced for Danny Dorling and was presented to him after his inaugural lecture as Halford Mackinder professor of Geography at the University of Oxford on 3 February 2014."

  "text" : "Stephen Lerner (born January 29, 1958) is a labor and community organizer who has spent more than three decades organizing hundreds of thousands of janitors, farm workers, garment workers, and other low-wage workers into unions. Lerner is a critic of Wall Street bankers and the increased financialization of the US economy. He argues that the power of investments banks and other financial entities have led to income inequality and served as the driving force behind the creation of overwhelming debt obligations seen at the state and local level. The result, Lerner says, is a consolidation of economic and political power in the hands of a small number of banking and finance executives. Lerner advocates the use of non-violent civil disobedience as a tactic to challenge the influence of Wall Street and corporations. Lerner is a contributor on national television and radio programs and has published articles charting a path for a 21st-century labor movement focused on growth and meeting the challenges of a global economy."

  "text" : "Sir Christopher Wyvill, 3rd Baronet  (1614 – 8 February 1681) was an English politician who sat in the House of Commons in 1659 and 1660. Wyvill was the son of Sir Marmaduke Wyvill, 2nd Baronet of Constable Burton Hall and his wife Isabel Gascoigne, daughter of Sir William Gascoigne of Sedbury Yorkshire. He was baptised on 6 December 1614. Wyvill is credited with a rare little octavo in the Bodleian Library entitled Certaine serious Thoughts which at severall times & upon sundry occasions have stollen themselves into verse and now into the publike view from the author [monogram, ‘C. W.’], Esquire. Together with a chronological table denoteing the names of such Princes as ruled the neighbour states & were contemporary with our English Kings published in London in 1647. This volume of verse is described at some length in Brydges's Censura Literaria (1808, vii. 261–4), and there dubiously attributed to C. Warwick. The Wyvill arms on the title-page point almost conclusively to (Sir) Christopher's authorship, which is conjecturally adopted in the British Museum Catalogue. Wyvill inherited the baronetcy on the death of his father in 1648. In 1659, Wyvill was elected Member of Parliament for Richmond in the Third Protectorate Parliament. In 1660, Wyvill was elected MP for Richmond in the Convention Parliament. He was the author of an anti-papal duodecimo entitled The Pretensions of the Triple Crown published in London in 1672. Wyvill died at the age of 66. Wyvill married Ursula Darcy, daughter of Conyers, Lord Darcy. His son William succeeded him in the baronetcy."

  "text" : "Sam Fonteyn (born Samuel Soden, c. 1925–1991) was an English composer-pianist whose most significant output was for the Boosey & Hawkes Music Library, for which he composed and recorded countless works. Most are short character pieces for the piano with colorful titles indicating the images the pieces are meant to conjure. Others are bright orchestral pieces. Fonteyn's work has been heard on television since he recorded for Boosey & Hawkes in the 1970s. A music library recording was used as the theme of the British sitcom Please Sir! in 1968, and \"Pop Looks Bach\", originally written for the 1976 Winter Olympics, was later used as the theme of the long-running television programme Ski Sunday. His work has been featured recently on SpongeBob SquarePants, Ren & Stimpy, and Family Guy (a vaudeville duo use Fonteyn's \"Galloping Gertie\" as a vamp in a recurring gag)."

  "text" : "Santos Amaro, better known as \"Canguro\" Amaro, (March 14, 1908 - May 31, 2001) was a Cuban athlete competing in Cuban and Mexican professional baseball. One of the most aggressive players in Cuban baseball, Amaro had thousands of admirers both in Cuba and Mexico. He was inducted into the Mexican Baseball Hall of Fame in 1977. Amaro initially played at the catcher position, which was difficult for him because of his height (1.92 m). He then played third base, but his best position was right field, where he made good use of a strong throwing arm. He was one of the most consistent hitters that have passed through the Mexican League, playing for seventeen seasons and batting over .300 in eleven of them. When he hung up his spikes in 1955, he retired with a .314 overall average with 1,339 hits. In 1951, he replaced Martin Dihigo as manager of the Veracruz Eagle, a team he led to the championship in 1952 and 1961. His son Ruben Amaro, played 11 years in American Major League Baseball, and his grandson, Ruben Amaro Jr., also played in the major leagues and was the general manager of the Philadelphia Phillies."

He later worked in practically all theatres of Leningrad. Georgy Tovstonogov once wrote about Mandel in Russian: “His fantasy was enormous and highly imaginative and his creative mind knew no borders. The artist never took the beaten path in finding a unique theatrical solution for a certain play or film; he was highly resourceful in implementing the newest theatrical techniques, materials and lighting available at the time. For him, nothing was impossible in the search to achieve the best theatrical vision for the production.”1. Mandel was also known for his creation of theatrical posters that were seen throughout the city."

  "text" : "Sarah Ann Hackett Stevenson (February 2, 1841 – August 14, 1909) was an early female physician in Illinois, and the first female member of the American Medical Association (AMA). Born in Buffalo Grove, Illinois, she began her studies at the Mount Carroll Seminary (which later became Shimer College), continuing to Illinois State Normal University where she graduated in 1863. She taught school and served as principal in Sterling, Illinois, but later moved to Chicago to study medicine at Women's Hospital Medical College, where she obtained her MD in 1874, having in the meantime also spent a year in England studying under Thomas Huxley. In 1875, she took up a professorship at the Women's Hospital Medical College, which later became part of Northwestern University but was closed in 1892. In 1876, attending the AMA convention as a delegate of the Illinois State Medical Society, she was accepted without controversy as the AMA's first female member. In 1880 she co-founded the Illinois Training School for Nurses together with Lucy Flower. She retired in 1903."

In 2009, LAWeekly called the series of interviews, \"a nice collection\". Shabooty gained further notoriety in 2009 for breaking several news stories, one of which was an exclusive report, where it was unveiled that Michael Lohan's series of suicidal Twitter messages were a hoax. In 2010, Los Angeles TV Personality Jillian Barberie-Reynolds spoke out in support of Shabooty and his brand of interviews and humor, \"your tweets on their own are very funny. I love reading them, they’re just funny and it’s stuff that everybody thinks and nobody says.\" In March 2011, Howard Stern pointed out on his SiriusXM radio show, that Twitter had recommended \"Shabooty Bieber\" as a user similar to him. This is because Shabooty.com has a strong focus on 'The Howard Stern Show' and Hip-Hop music."

Fernandes trained as a navigator in Spain at the famed Casa de Contratación in Seville, but later took up arms against the Spanish empire, preying upon Spanish shipping along with fellow pirate John Callis. Charged with piracy in 1577, he was saved from the hangman's noose by Sir Francis Walsingham, becoming a Protestant and a subject of the Queen of England. In 1578 Fernandes entered the service of Sir Humphrey Gilbert and later Sir Walter Raleigh, piloting the failed 1587 expedition to Roanoke, known to history as the \"Lost Colony\". Fernandes disappears from the records after 1590, when he sailed with an English fleet to the Azores, a journey from which he most likely did not return alive. However, a copy of one of his charts of the East coast of North America still survives in the Cotton Collection, and was probably one of the chief sources used by John Dee for his 1580 map justifying English claims to North America."

  "text" : "Dr. Steven Kull is a political psychologist who studies public opinion on public policy.He has conducted polls and focus groups in over 30 countries around the world. He has led in-depth studies in the United States and the Muslim world, as well as numerous large multi-nation studies of world public opinion. Kull appears regularly in international media and has testified to or consulted with the U.S. Congress, the U.S. State Department, the United Nations, NATO, the European Commission, and other agencies. His most recent book, Feeling Betrayed: The Roots of Muslim Anger at America (Brookings Institution Press, 2011) explores attitudes in the Muslim public toward the United States based on extensive focus groups and polls he conducted in majority-Muslim countries. Kull has been a faculty member in the School of Public Policy at the University of Maryland since 1990. In 1992, he established the Center on Policy Attitudes (COPA) with the purpose of giving the public a greater voice in public policy. Dr. Kull is director of the Program on International Policy Attitudes (PIPA), a joint program of COPA and the Center for International and Security Studies at the University of Maryland(CISSM). PIPA has conducted numerous studies of public opinion on international issues and is noted for polls that probe respondents not only for their opinions but also for their beliefs and perceptions. Particularly well-known is a poll PIPA conducted in 1995 in which it was revealed that the median American assumes that 20% of the U.S. federal budget is devoted to foreign aid and believes that it should be 10%, when in fact the real amount is 1%. Starting in 2002, Kull became increasingly involved in studying public opinion around the world. In 2004 he and PIPA, in conjunction with the international polling firm GlobeScan, initiated the global polling program for BBC World Service, which continues today. In 2006 PIPA also initiated the WorldPublicOpinion.org project, which is a collaborative project of research centers in over 25 countries that conducts international polls. Kull began intensive study of public opinion in the Muslim world in 2006, conducting focus groups in six majority-Muslim nations and polls in eleven countries, of which the result is Feeling Betrayed, his book on Muslim attitudes toward the United States. In 2010 Kull initiated the Program for Public Consultation (PPC), a joint program of COPA and the School of Public Policy at the University of Maryland. PPC seeks to give the public a greater voice in public policy by improving the capacity for policymakers to consult the public on government decisions. The process of public consultation goes beyond standard polls by first presenting the respondent with the kind of information that policymakers have when making decisions. PPC conducted a major study in 2011 in which a representative sample was presented with the U.S. federal budget in some detail and were given the means to design their own budget. Kull is licensed as a clinical psychologist and practiced as a psychotherapist for over 10 years. He was associated with the method psychosynthesis, having been trained by its founder Roberto Assagioli at the Istituto di Psicosintest in Florence. Kull graduated from the University of California in 1972 with a B.A. in Psychology and from the Saybrook Institute in 1980 with a Ph.D. in psychology. From 1984-1988 he was a post-doctoral fellow at Stanford University, studying international relations under the tutelage of Alexander George."

  "text" : "Suzanne Segal (1955–1997) was a writer and teacher about spiritual enlightenment, known for her sudden experience of Self-Realization which she wrote about in her book Collision With the Infinite: A Life Beyond the Personal Self. In addition to gaining note in the spiritual community, Segal became a model case of the dissociative condition known as depersonalization disorder (DPD). Along her journey some therapists formally diagnosed her with DPD, while others did not have clear explanations. Two years after her shift into a \"sense of unity\", Segal relapsed into the uncomfortable state of constant anxiety she had first experienced. At this point she returned to exploring psychological themes from her childhood which included recovered memories of abuse and persistent migraines. Shortly thereafter, in 1997, Segal's health began rapidly deteriorating, and she was diagnosed with a malignant brain tumor. She died two months later that year, leaving many questions about the root cause of her experience unanswered."

  "text" : "Lieutenant-Colonel Sir Charles Gould Morgan, 2nd Baronet (4 February 1760 – 5 December 1846), was a Welsh soldier and politician, the MP for Brecon (1787–1796) and later the County of Monmouth (1796–1831). Born to Sir Charles Morgan, 1st Baronet (originally Charles Gould) and Jane Morgan, he became a Captain in the Coldstream Guards. On retirement from the British Army to enable him to concentrate of the family estate, he became an MP for Brecon, and later the County of Monmouth. He married Mary Margaret Stoney in 1791, with whom he had eight children. He never remarried after her death in 1808. In 1800, industrialist Samuel Homfray married his daughter Jane Morgan, and thus obtained a favorable lease of mineral land at Tredegar, where he established the Tredegar Ironworks. Morgan was succeeded by his son, Charles Morgan, 1st Baron Tredegar."

  "text" : "Sieglinde Wagner (21 April 1921 – 31 December 2003) was an Austrian operatic contralto, who could also sing mezzo-soprano roles. Wagner was born in Linz, and studied in Linz and Munich. In 1947, she made her debut at the Vienna State Opera. Two years later, she was hired by Wilhelm Furtwängler to sing in The Magic Flute at the Salzburg Festival. After this successful collaboration, Furtwängler signed her to sing Floßhilde and Grimgerde in Richard Wagner's Der Ring des Nibelungen at La Scala. This was the beginning of a career that included many of Wagner's alto roles (she and the composer were not related). In 1950, Sieglinde Wagner sang as a contralto, as Orlovsky, a blase young nobleman in Die Fledermaus. In 1952, she made her first appearance at the Städtischen Oper in Berlin as Maddalena in Rigoletto. She sang Carmen there in December of the same year. This was the start of a 34-year relationship. Sieglinde Wagner had a very wide repertoire, including Clairon in Richard Strauss's Capriccio, Annina in Der Rosenkavalier, Magdalena in Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg, Fenena in Nabucco, the mother in Hansel and Gretel and Mary in The Flying Dutchman. In 1963, she was awarded the title of Kammersänger by the senate of Berlin. She was active for many years at the festivals in Bayreuth, Edinburgh, Glyndebourne, and Salzburg under conductors such as Otto Klemperer, Wilhelm Furtwängler, Clemens Krauss, Fritz Busch, Karl Böhm, Herbert von Karajan, and Wolfgang Sawallisch. She made numerous recordings with illustrious casts, including The Magic Flute with Karl Böhm, Fritz Wunderlich, Roberta Peters, and Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau. She retired from singing in 1986. She died in a Berlin hospital in 2003, at the age of 82."

  "text" : "Sir Sidney Ford, MBE (29 August 1909–13 August 1983) was a British trade union leader. Sidney William George Ford was born in Edmonton, London. Ford began working for the Miners' Federation of Great Britain (MFGB) in 1925. He received his knighthood for his work on Lord Devlin's Docks Inquiry and other T.U.C. (trade union congress). He never worked as a miner, but became Secretary of COSA, the colliery officials and staffs section of the union. He was known for his loyalty to the Labour Party and his opposition to the union's left-wing. The MFGB was refounded as the National Union of Mineworkers. Its president-elect, Alwyn Machen, died suddenly in March 1960, the same month he was elected. A new presidential election was held, and Ford stood against Alex Moffat, a Scottish communist. He retired in 1971. For a number of years prior to his death he suffered from Parkinsons Disease, and died as a result of this on 13 August 1983. He died in Palmers Green, Winchmore Hill, London N.21. Ford's period as leadership was marked by mass pit closures and relatively little resistance. His successor, Joe Gormley, wrote in his autobiography that this passivity led many mineworkers to distrust the white-collar COSA section of the union, which influenced the lack of support for the moderate Trevor Bell, who ran against Arthur Scargill for the leadership in 1981."

  "text" : "Shahvaar Ali Khan is a Pakistani writer, singer-songwriter and composer. His first single \"No Saazish No Jang\" is being touted as the official peace anthem by youth organisations across South Asia and America. In the peace anthem song, Shahvar has used the voices of Muhammad Ali Jinnah, Imran Khan, Benazir Bhutto, Mahatma Gandhi and Barack Obama. The song has also been especially well received by Pakistani, Indian, Bangladeshi and Nepali students from colleges like Harvard, Trinity, NYU and many other institutions abroad, in addition to assorted listeners in Pakistan and India Shahvaar Ali Khan graduated in Economics & International Studies from Trinity College in Hartford Connecticut after attending Cambridge Rindge & Latin School, MA, USA and Lahore Grammar School. After meandering from Investment Banking in New York to the Petroleum Industry in Pakistan the passion for music, entertainment, writing, an amalgamation of business acumen, people skills and penchant for creativity landed Shahvaar in Advertising. Shahvaar found the whole ad man lifestyle intriguing in the company of some extremely artistic peers and incisive clients, which helped him understand the pulse of the audience. Concurrently, Shahvaar started singularly focusing on his Music, singing, songwriting/writing since 2008 and did a soft/viral internet availability of his first song \"NO SAAZISH, NO JANG – Peace NOT Pieces\" (NSNJ) on his website as an experiment. Even without a Music Video-launching pad or a single advertising dollar spent on promoting NSNJ, Shahvaar found himself sharing print space with the likes of Shahrukh Khan and Michael Jackson as Front Page news on many Pakistani and Indian Newspapers/Magazines including The News Instep, The Times of India (Delhi/Bombay Times), The Hindu, The Daily Jang, MSN India, Yahoo India, The Asian Age – Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, London, Deccan Chronicle, India, News Today, India, The Daily Siasat, India, USA Today, Hum Shehri (Urdu), Pakistan, India News (Hindi), Bombay Mid Day, Daily Pakistan (Urdu), etc. including a few Bollywood websites. However, despite the response, contrary to his expectations the struggle for Shahvaar had just begun. It took him close to two years to find the right concept and Director for his Music Video. In the meantime Shahvaar started writing for publications and opened his own Advertising Creative shop."

  "text" : "Samarus (died 1201) was the Archbishop of Trani from 1192, when he succeeded Bertrand II, until his death. He was successful as a lawyer before becoming archbishop, and excelled at diplomacy after that. Samarus was a member of a family of government officials from Trani. A document of 1104 was written by a certain Samarus iudex (judge), probably a relative of his. His relatives Nicholas and Samarus were justiciars at Trani and his father, Rainald, and another relative, Roger, were royal chamberlains. He himself originally served Bertrand as a notary (1160s?) before becoming archdeacon of the cathedral around 1174. Six documents drawn up by Samarus before his election as archbishop are known. In 1182 he argued before Pope Lucius III his cathedral's case against the clergy of Corato. In light of this and his subsequent success at political manoeuvring, it is probable that his election had more to do with his merits than his connexions. In 1192 Samarus was still on good terms with King Tancred, who donated to him \"the tithe of the royal revenues at Trani and Barletta\", a donation confirmed that year by Pope Celestine III. Nevertheless, Samarus supported Queen Constance and the Emperor Henry VI in their claim on the Kingdom of Sicily. He was warmly praised by Henry in a diploma of April 1195, in which the emperor granted imperial protection to the church of Trani and confirmed all its rights and customs since the time of King William (probably William II). In reward for his service to Henry, Samarus also received the lordship of the Jewry of Trani. On a diplomatic mission to Cyprus in 1196 he negotiated commercial privileges for his town's merchants."

Until his death in Pune, Satish continued to be actively involved with film appreciation and teaching of cinema. According to the obituary in The Indian Express, he was \"...one of the founding teachers of the FTII, he played a crucial role in shaping the policies and vision of the Institute. Even today, he is held in high esteem by his students, some of whom are luminaries of the Indian cinema. Arun Khopkar, filmmaker and student of Bahadur, was quoted as saying, '\"...from day one, he became the guiding light in my life. Like a music teacher who explains the intricacies of taal and laya to his students, he would unveil countless aspects of films for us. Unlike many teachers who overshadow their students, he had the knack to bring the best out of his students. In fact, he was the one who started the concept of film diary amongst FTII students. I have this habit of calling the old, good and late faculty of the institute, the ghost faculty. Now, he belongs to that and sitting up there, he will continue to guide his students\"."

  "text" : "Before taking a promotion to the athletic director job at the University of Florida on September 26, 2016, that doubled his salary from $500,000 to $1 million (and bonuses that could increase the salary to $1.4 million) Scott Stricklin was the 16th director of athletics in Mississippi State University history. Stricklin began his role on May 7, 2010 when he took over for Greg Byrne, who left to become the director of athletics at the University of Arizona. He was named the 2016 Under Armour Athletics Director of the Year. Stricklin graduated from Mississippi State in 1992, after working as a student assistant in the media relations office. He served three years as the baseball contact while an undergraduate, and was named assistant media relations director following his graduation. Following a year at his alma mater, Stricklin was named associate media relations director at Auburn, where he served as the baseball contact from 1993-1998. In 1998, he took over the top media relations post at Tulane and coordinated media for the 12-0 Green Wave football team that season. A four-year stint at Baylor (1999-2003) as Assistant AD for Communications and Marketing followed, before Stricklin returned to the Southeastern Conference as the Associate AD for Media Relations at Kentucky. Stricklin returned to Mississippi State in 2008 as the Senior Associate Athletics Director for External Affairs, overseeing fundraising efforts among many responsibilities. He is the son-in-law of Mississippi State basketball legend Bailey Howell. With an investment of nearly $140 million in facilities, a strong roster of successful coaches, and significant increases in Bulldog Club membership and donations, MSU Athletics has achieved the highest-ever Learfield Director’s Cup finish (44th in 2015-16) for any school from the Magnolia State, while consistently seeing the majority of its teams compete in post-season championships. In an era that has seen 30-consecutive sellouts at Davis Wade Stadium and impressive football facility enhancements, Coach Dan Mullen’s team has played in six-consecutive bowl games, while the Bulldogs spent five-straight weeks in 2014 ranked No. 1 in the polls for the first time in school history. In 2015-16, eight sports advanced to NCAA postseason play, with seven finishing ranked in the Top 25. Eleven first- or second-team All-America honors were won, while MSU broke single-season total and/or average attendance records in five sports (soccer, football, women’s basketball, softball and baseball). Two sports – baseball and women’s basketball – earned the opportunity to host NCAA postseason play. In addition, MSU won individual track and field national titles with Curtis Thompson (javelin) and Marta Freitas (1500m run). All this success unfolded after Mississippi State sports advanced 11 teams to NCAA postseason play in 2014-15, with eight earning Top 25 rankings during the season, including the women’s golf team, which ascended all the way to No. 1 in the fall. The year was capped by All-American Rhianwedd Price winning the 1500-meter run at the NCAA Outdoor Track & Field Championships in Oregon, one year after Brandon McBride claimed the crown in the 800-meter run and two years removed from the baseball team playing for the national championship in Omaha. In the classroom, Bulldog students continue to excel. In the 2015-16 academic year, Mississippi State’s men and women athletes posted a combined GPA of 2.99 (second highest in school history), while 182 of the 340 Bulldog student-athletes had a 3.0 or better. Also in 2016, Bulldog students again excelled in the NCAA’s Academic Progress Rate, with all 16 sports far exceeding the minimum standard, with eight teams posting a perfect score. Stricklin, who was named Under Armour’s Athletics Director of the Year in April 2016, has overseen record fundraising for Bulldog Athletics, which has produced new facilities such as the $11.7 million Mize Pavilion at Humphrey Coliseum, the $25 million Leo W. Seal Jr. Football Complex, as well as $75 million in expansion and upgrades to Davis Wade Stadium that were completed prior to the start of the 2014 campaign."

She sang during the contest, and ended up in second place. Just as she was about to go home, Raúl Velasco brought Sheyla to the attention of another Televisa producer, Luis de Llano Macedo, who invited her to appear in an episode of the telenovela Agujetas de color de rosa later that year. Then, in 1996, Tadeo became one of the original \"Sketchistosos\" on the comedy/variety series Al Ritmo de la noche with Jorge Ortiz de Pinedo. One recurring sketch on the series was set in a classroom; Sheyla's character was named Zoila. Because of the success of the classroom sketches, Tadeo was invited to reprise her role when those sketches became a separate television series in 1998 as Cero en conducta. On the series, as on the sketches before it, Zoila is an overweight elementary school student who is usually seen bringing a sandwich to class. In 2000 she was cast in the telenovela Mi destino eres tu; this eventually led Tadeo to leave Cero en conducta, although she would reprise her role of Zoila in 2004 for La Escuelita VIP, the successor to Cero en conducta. By then, she had portrayed a maid in another comedy series, La Jaula, and had married Javier Padilla (in 2003). Also, in 2004, she participated in the Televisa reality series Cantando por el sueño and Reyes de la cancion; she ended up winning the competition. She was so good that she was invited to participate in El show de los sueños in 2008; she finished fourth in that competition. She and Padilla were divorced that same year. In 2009, Tadeo finally recorded her debut album, which features new songs written by Juan Gabriel, who has also written for other singers. She returned to television in 2011 for the telenovela Rafaela. Later that year her second album, Dos estilos una voz was released. The next year, Tadeo underwent weight reduction surgery, losing 52 kilograms (114 2/3 pounds), resulting in a decline of health problems. As a further consequence of the surgery, which took place in her hometown, 8.5 kilograms (18 3/4 pounds) of excess skin removed during the surgery was donated to Culiacan-area children hospitalized in burn units. Her most recent television series was Amorcito Corazon, also in 2012. She most recently released the album Amemonos: un homenaje a Lucha Villa. All three of Sheyla's studio albums to date have been released by EMI Televisa Music in Latin America, including Mexico, and Capitol Records (itself an EMI subsidiary) in the United States."

In 1621, Eure was elected Member of Parliament for Beaumaris. He was made Kings Attorney for Wales for life on 11 April 1622 and, together with Ralph Goodwin, was granted the office of Examiner in the Court of the Marches of Wales on 19 November 1625 . In 1638 he became a Bencher of his Inn and in 1640 was elevated to Serjeant-at-law and then King's Serjeant. In November 1640, Eure was elected MP for Leominster in the Long Parliament. and was knighted on 7 August 1641. When the Civil War was taking shape he made his way to join King Charles at Oxford and was created DCL (Doctor of Civil Law) there on 7 February 1643. He was also made Speaker of the King's Parliament in Oxford (as distinct from the de facto Parliament in Westminster). In consequence he was disabled from sitting in the House of Commons on 22 January 1644 and made to suffer, although not excessively, for his support of the King's cause. Eure died at his home at Gatley Park, Herefordshire in 1659."

In 2006 he described Hezbollah's defeat of the Israeli Defense Force in the Lebanon War as \"a very important victory for the anti-war movement worldwide\", claiming it prevented or delayed US and Israeli plans to attack Iran and Syria. Naguib has also criticized others on the far-left of not differentiating between Islamic organizations such as al-Qaeda - whom he labels a network of \"individual terrorists\", Hamas and Hezbollah - \"national liberation movements\", and the Muslim Brotherhood - \"reformist mass movements\". In 2007, Naguib was a speaker at the fifth Cairo Anti-war Conference, which he used as a platform to condemn former President Hosni Mubarak and pointed to Egypt's striking workers as a way forward for the movement: [T]he struggle against Mubarak’s regime is just in its beginning and not end as the regime hopes. Despite the constitutional coup, passed by force and forgery, the Egyptian state terrorism will not intimidate us. Their laws and dictatorial constitution will not deter us from fighting for freedom and justice. He is the author of several articles and a pamphlet, The Egyptian Revolution: A Political Analysis and Eyewitness Account (London: Bookmarks, 2011)."

  "text" : "Stanley Edward Spencer (1868–1906) was an early English aeronaut, famous for ballooning and parachuting in several countries, and later for building and flying an airship over London in 1902. Stanley's family had a history of flying: all his five siblings were also aeronauts, with Arthur and Percival the more well-known; his father Charles Green Spencer pioneered gliding and founded the balloon factory C.G. Spencer & Sons in London; and his grandfather Edward had flown balloons with Charles Green since 1836. On 15 September 1898, Stanley piloted a hydrogen balloon for the meteorologist Arthur Berson in what was believed to be a record ascent to 27,500 feet. On 15 November 1899, Spencer ascended with John Mackenzie Bacon and Gertrude Bacon to observe the Leonid meteor shower from above the clouds. Ten hours later, their balloon landed near Neath, South Wales, narrowly missing drifting out over the Atlantic."

  "text" : "Samuel \"Sammy\" Tirop (born 13 January 1959 in Nandi District) is a former Kenyan middle-distance runner who ran in the 800 metres. Tirop's first major medal came at the 1986 Goodwill Games, where he was his country's sole medallist with his bronze in the 800 m. His career coincided with a period of Kenyan dominance in men's middle-distance running: Kenyans won all the major titles from 1987 to 1992 through runners such as Billy Konchellah and Paul Ereng. As a result, he frequently missed out on major competitions due to the high calibre of opposition at the national level. He won at the East and Central African Championships in 1989 and in December he managed second at the 1989 Kenyan Trials for the Commonwealth Games, running a personal best of 1:44.3 minutes which ranked him eleventh in the world that year. Largely unknown outside of his home nation, he went on to upset both Nixon Kiprotich and Sebastian Coe to win the 800 m at the 1990 Commonwealth Games in Auckland. When asked how he had achieved such a feat at the age of 31 with little international experience, he responded that he was typically fourth or fifth at the Kenyan Championships behind World and Olympic champions for opposition. When the trials for the 1992 Barcelona Olympics came, Tirop again missed out on selection. Renowned Kenyan running coach Brother Colm O'Connell remarked: \"You had the Olympic champion, Ereng; the world champion, Konchellah, and the Commonwealth champion, Sammy Tirop, and none of them made the team. That's what running in Kenya is like.\""

Stuart assumed the Wishart Baronetcy in 1777 in dubious circumstances on the death of his great-uncle, Sir William Stuart, 2nd Baronet after taking legal advice, although it was not disputed in his lifetime. He also assumed the surname of Stuart in lieu of Wishart-Belsches by Royal licence on October 1797. Now it is accepted that women can be baronets his mother is today considered to have rightfully been the 3rd Baronet even though her son was already using the title. He was elected M.P. for Kincardineshire as above and became a Baron of the Exchequer in Scotland from 1807 until his death. He married, on 9 November 1775, Lady Jane Leslie, the eldest daughter of David Melville, 6th Earl of Leven. She died on 28 October 1829. They had a daughter, Williamina Stuart (died 5 December 1810; married Sir William Forbes, 7th Baronet). On his death with no heir the Wishart baronetcy of Clifton Hall, Edinburgh became dormant."

She is married with three children; her father-in-law is former Vanguard politician Robert Overend. She worked in accountancy before taking up employment as office manager for her father Billy Armstrong MLA in 1998. Overend is the Ulster Unionist Party Women's Development Officer. Overend stood unsuccessfully in Mid Ulster at the 2010 general election, taking 11% of the vote and fourth place. In 2015, she stood again in Mid Ulster at the 2015 general election, taking 15.4% of the vote and second place and overtaking the DUP in Mid Ulster. Overend has said that there must be an equitable solution found for Northern Ireland’s dairy farmers or else the industry runs the risk of being strangled by low prices. \"Whilst Thursday's increase in the milk auction, 25.04ppl to 26.22ppl, is to be welcomed we must remember that exactly the same auction last year produced results of 29.53ppl. Therefore whilst milk prices may be rising from their cripplingly low 22ppl only a few months ago, they still have much further to go to simply match last year’s prices.\""

  "text" : "Sir William Dolben, 3rd Baronet (1727–1814) was a British MP and campaigner for the abolition of slavery. He was born in Finedon, Northamptonshire, the only surviving son of Sir John Dolben, 2nd Baronet and his wife Elizabeth Digby. He was educated at Westminster School and Christ Church, Oxford, matriculating in 1744. After leaving Oxford he married in 1748 Judith, daughter of Somerset English, heiress to a considerable fortune. In 1756 he inherited the baronetcy on the death of his father. He was appointed High Sheriff of Northamptonshire for 1760 and in 1766 a verderer of Rockingham Forest. After a short period as a stopgap MP for Oxford University he was returned in 1768 as MP for Northamptonshire from 1768 to 1774. In 1780 he was re-adopted by the University and represented them again from 1780 until 1806. On 20 April 1797, he was appointed captain in the Northamptonshire volunteer cavalry regiment. During his long parliamentary career as an independent MP he was a fervent advocate of parliamentary reform and the abolition of slavery. He took up the abolitionist cause after he chanced to visit a slave ship docked in the port of London; the conditions he found on the ship so horrified him that he resolved at once to work for abolition. With the support of other abolitionists Dolben put forward a bill in 1788 to regulate conditions on board slave ships which was passed as the Slave Trade Act 1788 by a large majority. After the death of his first wife in 1771, he married in 1789 a second cousin, Charlotte Scotchmer, née Affleck. He died in Bury St Edmunds in 1814, aged eighty-seven, and was buried at Finedon church. He was succeeded in the title and estates by John English Dolben, his only surviving son from his first marriage."

  "text" : "Susanne \"Sanne\" Ledermann (October 7, 1928 – November 19, 1943) was a German Jewish girl who was killed by the Nazis in the Auschwitz concentration camp. Susanne is best known for her friendship with the famous diarist Anne Frank and her sister Margot Frank. Sanne was born in Berlin, the younger of two daughters of Franz Ledermann, lawyer and musician, and Ilse Citroën-Ledermann, a pianist. In 1933, Adolf Hitler's Nazi party came to power. The Ledermanns, faced with the threat of death because they were Jews, emigrated to Amsterdam, Netherlands. Sanne was admitted to a Montessori School, where she befriended Anne Frank and Hanneli Goslar. In 1940, the Nazis invaded the Netherlands, and Sanne had to move to a Jewish school. Hanneli and Anne moved to a different Jewish school. However, Sanne still kept good contacts with both Anne and Hanneli, and was a member of the ping pong club Little Dipper Minus Two (they had thought the little dipper had five stars for the five girls who were in the club, while there were actually seven stars, thus they called it \"Little Dipper Minus Two\"), which was formed by her friends. In July 1942, Anne and her family (Margot, Otto, and Edith, along with the van Pels family and Fritz Pfeffer) went into hiding, although Sanne didn't know about this. On June 20, 1943, the Ledermanns were arrested by the Nazis. They were transported to the Westerbork transit camp, and on November 16th  were deported to the Auschwitz death camp. Immediately upon their arrival, Sanne and her parents were murdered in the gas chambers of the camp. Sanne's sister, Barbara, was able to escape the Nazis through her contacts with the Dutch underground. Barbara emigrated to the United States and later married the Nobel prize winning biochemist Martin Rodbell."

Topol's expertise in microwave systems led to the development of the first effective portable television relay links, allowing broadcasts from even remote areas. His foray into satellite technologies in the 1960s provided the foundation for building the emerging cable television industry, permitting the transmission of transoceanic television broadcasts. Topol also played a pivotal role in the development of international telecommunications trade policies and the promotion of high definition television (HDTV), a technology that enhances video images by using digital, instead of analog, encoding techniques. retiring in the early 1990s, Topol has been engaged in philanthropic work, contributing to the educational and cultural life in Boston and Atlanta."

  "text" : "Sebastian Kamwanga (29 April 1929 – 22 January 1999) was a Hompa (king) of the Gciriku, one of five kingdoms of the Kavango people in northern Namibia, from 1985 to 1999. His royal seat was situated at Mamono. He sat in the Legislative Council and the Executive Council of Kavangoland from 1973 until Namibian independence in 1990 when Bantustans were abolished along with the South African apartheid occupation of South-West Africa. Kamwanga was born on April 29, 1929 in the village of Shankara in the Kavango Region. He completed teacher education at Döbra in 1951 and began training as Roman Catholic Catechist at Bunya Catholic Mission in 1959. Soon after being crowned Hompa of the Gciriku in 1985, Kamwanga drew criticism from his peer traditional leaders in the Kavango kingdom for referring to himself as Nkuruhompa (paramount chief), implying that he was the prime leader of the Kavango and paramount over the other four vaHompa. This turned out to be a misunderstanding because he was chairman of the Executive Council of Kavangoland at that time and as such indeed in a position of power, albeit in modern rather than traditional politics. Sebastian Kamwanga was a member of the Democratic Turnhalle Alliance (DTA) but nevertheless friendly towards SWAPO people and aims. In the mid-1980s his farm Shamangomba was used as People's Liberation Army of Namibia (PLAN) operational base for their guerrilla actions in the Namibian struggle for independence against the South African army. He was a passionate pianist, performing at church services, and assisted with the Bible translation from Afrikaans into Rumanyo, his native tongue. Seven children resulted from his marriage to Regina Nankali Mberema. Kamwanga died on January 22, 1999."

He matriculated at Christ's College, Cambridge in December 1588 and was admitted at Middle Temple on 11 May 1593. In 1593, Montagu was elected Member of Parliament for Brackley. He was elected MP for Malmesbury in 1601 and for Wells in 1614. He became Master of Requests to King Charles I and was Knighted on 28 July 1616. In November 1640, Montagu was elected MP for Huntingdonshire in the Long Parliament. He was expelled and committed to the Tower of London in 1642. Montagu was of Hinchingbrooke House, Huntingdonshire, England. He married Paulina Pepys, daughter of John Pepys, of Cottenham, Cambridgeshire, England and sister of Richard Pepys and Thomas Pepys, grandfather of Samuel Pepys. His son Edward was created Earl of Sandwich. His brothers included Edward Montagu, 1st Baron Montagu, Sir Walter Montagu, Henry Montagu, 1st Earl of Manchester, Sir Charles Montagu and James Montagu, Bishop of Winchester. Samuel Pepys, as he admitted, owed his start in life to the \" chance without merit\" which made his great-aunt the mother of the Earl of Sandwich."

Her father was British and her mother hailed from an Anglo-Russian family who had made their home in Russia for several generations. Stella's brother was Montague Law Whishaw. Another relative, James Whishaw, was a British businessman in St Petersburg, who published his memoirs, A history of the Whishaw family, in London in 1935. She was married in 1907 to Baron Paul Meyendorff, Captain in the Horse Guards and Aides-de-camp to Tsar Nicholas II in 1907 and then later Colonel in his Military Secretariat. Arbenina and Meyendorff had three children, Georgi, Helena and Irina. During the Russian Revolution the family suffered greatly under the Bolsheviks. Their possessions were seized and they were imprisoned. Through efforts by the Baltic Germans Committee they were released from prison and finally permitted to leave Russia at end of 1918. They settled briefly in Estonia where they lived on a remnant of the family estates. Arbenina acted in theatres in Tallinn and Tartu, and also in Berlin, in from 1921 to 1922. In 1923 she arrived with children to London, where she permanently settled, appearing in English stage and film roles. In 1930, she released her memoirs, Through Terror to Freedom, which describes her experiences during the Russian Revolution."

She earlier served as MLA of Araidanga constituency in Malda district from 1991 until 2011, when she defected from the Indian National Congress to join the Trinamool Congress. In the 2011 election, she won the Manikchak constituency with 64,641 votes, defeating her immediate rival, Ratna Bhattacharya of the CPI(M) by 6,217 votes. She was sworn in as the Minister for Women & Child Development and Social Welfare by the Governor on the advice of Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee. She is one of the 34 ministers in the Council of Ministers of West Bengal, who hold the Cabinet Minister rank. She was earlier affiliated with the Indian National Congress party but defected to the Trinamool Congress in 2011. She also served as the Vice-President of the West Bengal People's Congress Committee (WBPCC) during her affiliation with the INC. Her strained relationship with WBPCC President and now Minister for Irrigation & Inland Waterways and Small & Micro Enterprises and Textiles in the Government of West Bengal, Manas Bhunia, has been widely publicized. One of the first decisions she took as the Minister for Women & Child Development and Social Welfare in the Government of West Bengal was to dismiss any retired officials in her Ministry still clinging on to their jobs. She also froze the number of new appointments under the Integrated Child Development Services in various districts, saying there were irregularities in the manner the appointments were made, as these appointments were made in back dates. Apart from Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, Mitra is the only other woman in the 38-member strong Council of Ministers of West Bengal. Sabitri Mitra was divested of her portfolio and retained as minister without portfolio in May 2014."

Simon belonged to the priestly order of the Jehoiarib, the first of the twenty-four orders of Priests in the Temple in Jerusalem. Simon lived when the Hasmonean rulers Simon Thassi (reigned 142–135 BC) and his son John Hyrcanus I (reigned 134–104 BC) ruled over Judea. Simon had nine children; among them was his son Matthias Ephlias. Through his son, Simon was an ancestor of the Roman Jewish Historian of the 1st century, Flavius Josephus. Josephus in his writings calls Simon the Patriarch of his family."

  "text" : "Annemarie Margot \"Sunny\" Harnett (1924 - May 1987) was an American model in the 1950s and actress. She can be found in fashion magazines throughout that era — including frequently on the cover of Vogue — and was often a model of choice by photographer Edgar de Evia. Harper′s Bazaar ranks her as one of the 26 greatest models of all time. After becoming an assistant to Eileen Ford of Ford Models, she soon quit modeling. Harnett allegedly turned down the chance to represent Naomi Sims, who eventually became the first African-American supermodel, because Ford had \"too many\" black models already. At some point, Harnett gained weight and underwent a mastectomy. Due to health concerns, she was later placed in a home for long-term care. According to fellow 1950s Ford model Betsy Pickering, Gerald W. ″Jerry″ Ford, founder of Ford Models, hospitalized Harnett for mental illness. Harnett died from injuries sustained in a fire at the home in May 1987 when she was 63. She was also an actress and appeared in the film Funny Face. An ash blonde, she was a favorite model of photographer Richard Avedon, who served as a thinly veiled model for Fred Astaire′s character of Dick Avery in Funny Face. Avedon snapped one of the most famous photos of Harnett, in which, clad in an evening gown by Grès, she peers at a roulette wheel in a casino in Le Touquet, France. That iconic August 1954 photograph fetched $35,000 when Christie's auctioned it in October 2012."

After the unexpected death of the Dauphin on 10 August 1536 he was suspected of having poisoned the thirsty young man by bringing him a glass of water. A book about toxicology was found in Montecuccoli's possession, and he had previously been in the service of Charles V, but had come to France with Catherine de Medici. Under torture Montecuccoli confessed to having tried to poison King Francis and the Dauphin on behalf of the Emperor. Later he retracted his confession, but was executed by écartelage at the Place de la Grenette in Lyons on 7 October 1536. This manner of execution was reserved for regicides and meant that the victim was torn to pieces by four horses galloping into four different directions. Charles V officially protested against the charges levelled at his government. The true cause of the Dauphin's death is believed to have been tuberculosis."

Mill married twice; firstly Elizabeth More, daughter of Sir George More, of Loseley Park, but she died without issue and secondly, Anne Fleming, daughter of Sir Thomas Fleming, Lord Chief Justice of England, with whom he had several children. His eldest son Sir John Mill was killed fighting on the Royalist side in the English Civil War and had married Philadelphia Knollys, daughter of Sir Henry Knollys, of Grove Place, Hampshire, comptroller of the household to Charles I. Their son John succeeded his grandfather in the baronetcy and inherited his (sequestered) estates."

His work, along with that of Maja Pantic and Michel Valstar, won the British Computing Society Machine Intelligence Award in 2007. The work has also been the subject of some media attention. Prior to his work on The Painting Fool, Simon worked on the HR tool, a reasoning tool that was applied to discover mathematical concepts. The system successfully discovered theorems and conjectures, some of which were novel enough to become published works."

He was the son of the French painter Jean d'Arbois, who had come to Italy at the court for Gian Galeazzo Visconti after working for Philip II of Burgundy. He likely apprenticed at Pavia in the workshops of illuminators of the Visconti. He was influenced by Michelino da Besozzo, as it can be seen in the Madonna of the Rose Garden (1420s–1430s), variously attributed to him or Michelino. Before settling in Verona, Stefano worked at Padua. In Verona he executed his major works, such as the Adoration of the Magi (now in the Pinacoteca di Brera), signed and dated 1434. A painting depicting The Virgin and Child with Angels in a Garden with a Rose Hedge at the Worcester Art Museum has been attributed to Stefano. He was a friend of Pisanello, who was in Verona in the same period. Vincenzo di Stefano da Verona was likely a son or pupil. His brothers Giovanni Antonio and Giovanni Maria were also painters."

No painting of his is known with any certainty to survive. Some of the frescoes in the Cistercian abbey of Chiaravalle, near Milan, were attributed to Stefano and his studio in 2010.

In April 1641, Vernon was elected at a by-election as Member of Parliament for Andover in the Long Parliament. He voted against the attainder of Strafford, but was unseated on petition on 3 May 1642. He was appointed a commissioner for array by King Charles, but does not appear to have taken any part in the English Civil War and was therefore not disabled from sitting. In 1660, Vernon was elected MP for Shropshire in the Convention Parliament. He was created a baronet in 1660. He was elected MP for West Looe for the Cavalier Parliament in 1661 and sat until his death in 1676. Vernon married Elizabeth White daughter of Sir Richard White of the Friers in Anglesey. He was succeeded in the baronetcy by his son Sir Thomas Vernon, 2nd Baronet."

  "text" : "Samuel Gilbert \"Sam\" Scott (c. 1813 – January 11, 1841) was an American daredevil who was killed performing a stunt at Waterloo Bridge in London, England. Scott was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and served in the United States Navy, where he became well known for jumping off the masts of Navy vessels. Upon leaving the Navy he became a professional stuntman, passing the hat for contributions after his performances. Scott performed stunts in Boston, Massachusetts, Philadelphia and on the St. Lawrence River. He dived from a precipice near Niagara Falls, reported in newspapers as a 593-foot jump, although historians consider this figure to be impossible. Scott also worked as a bartender in Rochester, New York, where Sam Patch had jumped to his death from the High Falls in 1829. In 1837, Scott traveled to England to continue his diving career. He dove 100 feet in Manchester, 167 feet in Liverpool, and jumped from a 140-foot scaffold at the Chain Pier, Brighton. On the battleship St. Joseph, moored in Devonport, he jumped from a 200-foot topmast. In Cornwall, Scott allegedly jumped from a 240-foot cliff into eight feet of water; this achievement exceeds the current world record high dive, and is also considered unlikely. Scott was nearly killed in an accident while performing on an American ship in Deptford. He often swung from a rope by his feet and neck before jumping. While he was doing so in Deptford, the rope accidentally slipped around his neck and nearly strangled him. Scott was saved only by the quick thinking of a sailor who caught his feet and supported him, allowing Scott to loosen the rope. Scott's comment to the crowd after this accident was, \"The hemp that is to hang me is not grown yet!\" On January 11, 1841, Scott planned to run from the White Lion Pub in Drury Lane to Waterloo Bridge, jump from a scaffold on the bridge into the river, and return to the pub during the hour between 1:00 and 2:00 P.M. Upon arrival at the bridge, Scott began swinging from a noose attached to the scaffold. Once again the noose slipped and tightened around Scott's neck. As had also happened in Deptford, the spectators erroneously thought that this was part of Scott's act, and no immediate action was taken. Eventually, one man in the crowd insisted that Scott be cut down, but it was too late. According to a contemporary broadside, Scott \"was immediately taken to Charing Cross Hospital, where every attention was paid to him, but unfortunately without effect, as life was quite extinct.\" There were conflicting reports of Scott's marital status. According to The Times of London, Scott was residing with his wife in Deptford at the time of his death. His wife usually accompanied him to his performances, but was not present on the occasion of his fatal accident. Thomas Carlyle mentioned Scott's death in a letter to his brother Alexander Carlyle, written on January 15, 1841. In Carlyle's words: A wretched mortal that was wont to leap from top masts, bridges &c, and dive and do feats of that kind, perished in a shocking manner (as you will see by that Newspaper) here this week. One of his tricks was to act hanging; the noose slipt; he was found hanged in earnest! When I think of the mob looking at him, brutal animals, the still more brutal ‘gentlemen’ of the Bridge Committee encouraging such a scene,—few things I have ever heard of seem more detestable. The case is further mentioned in Alfred Swaine Taylor's Manual of Medical Jurisprudence, 6th American edition (Philadelphia 1866), p. 339, albeit giving a wrong year: The death of Scott, the American diver, in January, 1840, shows how readily asphyxia may be induced by a slight compression of the throat, even when a person might be supposed to have both the knowledge and the power to save himself... No attempt was made to save him until it was too late, and he was not brought to a hospital until thirty-three minutes had elapsed. He was allowed to hang thirteen minutes –– the spectators thinking that the deceased was prolonging the experiment for their gratification!"
