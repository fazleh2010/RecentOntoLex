He graduated with B.A. and LL.B. degrees, and joined the law firm of South Carolina Congressman Robert B. Elliott. A close friend of Booker T. Washington, Stewart followed his philosophies of self-reliance. He moved to New York in 1880, and eventually to Liberia in 1883, to serve as a professor at Liberia College. After two years, he returned to the United States, lived in New York and later Hawaii, before moving to London in 1905. In 1911 he was appointed Associated Justice of the Liberian Supreme Court. His criticism of president Daniel Edward Howard, however, resulted in his removal from the court in 1914. Stewart returned to London, and in 1921 he settled on the Virgin Islands, where he established a legal practice with Christopher Payne. He died in St. Thomas, Virgin Islands in 1923. His son, McCants Stewart, was the first black lawyer in Oregon."

Born in Antep in the Ottoman Empire, he was forced to leave to Syria because of the Armenian Genocide. In 1943, Nersoyan was elected Archbishop Primate of the Eastern Diocese of the Armenian Apostolic Church of America reporting to Catholicos of All Armenians in the Mother See of Etchmiadzin. He served for 10 years in office until 1953. In this period, Archbishop Nersoyan established 11 new churches, 21 priests were added to the clergy. He founded the Armenian Church Youth Organization of America (A.C.Y.O.A.) as well as a church choir association. Under his direction, land was purchased for St. Vartan Cathedral and Cultural Center in Manhattan, New York City at Second Avenue and 34th Street. The Primate was also a founder of the St. Nersess Seminary in New Rochelle, N.Y., and served as its dean. A religious scholar, Archbishop Nersoyan lectured extensively and wrote articles and theological studies in Armenian and English. The fifth edition of his translation and commentary of the Divine Liturgy of the Armenian Church was published in London in 1984. He died of cancer in New York City in September 1989."

She leads the group \"Women Journalists Without Chains,\" which she co-founded in 2005. She became the international public face of the 2011 Yemeni uprising that is part of the Arab Spring uprisings. She has been called the \"Iron Woman\" and \"Mother of the Revolution\" by Yemenis. She is a co-recipient of the 2011 Nobel Peace Prize, becoming the first Yemeni, the first Arab woman, and the second Muslim woman to win a Nobel Prize and the second youngest Nobel Peace Laureate to date. Karman gained prominence in her country after 2005 in her roles as a Yemeni journalist and an advocate for a mobile phone news service denied a license in 2007, after which she led protests for press freedom. She organized weekly protests after May 2007 expanding the issues for reform. She redirected the Yemeni protests to support the \"Jasmine Revolution,\" as she calls the Arab Spring, after the Tunisian people overthrew the government of Zine El Abidine Ben Ali in January 2011. She has been a vocal opponent who has called for the end of President Ali Abdullah Saleh's regime. A Saudi cable leak from WikiLeaks revealed that while publicly denouncing Saudi Arabia she was secretly arranging meetings with the Saudis to request their support. Karman lavished praise on the Saudis for pushing through a transition agreement that for many reformers, was seen as a deep betrayal of the revolution. She accused Abd Rabbuh Mansur Hadi of supporting the Houthis and Al Qaeda."

  "text" : "Ida Nikoline \"Tikken\" Manus (née Lindebrække, previously Bernardes; 28 June 1914 – 12 October 2010) was a member of the Norwegian resistance during World War II. Born Ida Nikoline Lie Lindebrække, she was a daughter of County Governor Gjert Lindebrække (1879–1960) and Ida Bessesen Lie (1881–1944), and a sister of politician Sjur Lindebrække. She was also a niece of writer Bernt Bessesen Lie. She hailed from Kalfaret in Bergen, and tried different ventures before the Second World War. She worked an office job in England, and attended French classes while socializing in Paris. She returned to England where she married diplomat George Bernardes, and had a son (George, Jr.) in 1939. They moved to Norway, where her husband was a consul in Haugesund. When the Second World War reached Norway on 9 April 1940 with the German invasion, Tikken was in Bergen. Her husband was injured while visiting Åndalsnes, and when he was operated in Sweden, Tikken followed and was hired at the British legation in Stockholm in 1943. Here, she was tasked with coordinating the contact with Norwegian resistance members who had fled German-occupied Norway for neutral Sweden, and the political and military authorities in Great Britain. Her codename was \"Tante\" (\"Aunt\"). While working here, she met resistance member Max Manus (1914–1996). After a lengthy process of divorcing her husband, she married Max Manus in March 1947 and took his last name. After the war, Tikken Manus was hired by resistance member Harald Grieg in the publishing house Gyldendal, but eventually joined her husband Max in running a small company in the office machine business. They lived at Landøya in Asker. Her husband died in 1996, and she died in October 2010. In addition to George Jr, the two had the children Max Jr. and Mette. A book about Tikken Manus was published in February 2009, Tikken Manus. Sabotørenes hemmelige medspiller. In 2008, she was made known to a broader audience when her character was included in the film Max Manus. She was portrayed by actor Agnes Kittelsen."

He won medals at world junior level and has represented Kenya at the Commonwealth Games. He made his international debut in 2008: having come fifth in the national junior race, he was selected for the 2008 IAAF World Cross Country Championships and took fifth place on the international stage, helping Kenya to the team title. He repeated national and world placings again in the 10,000 metres – he won the silver medal at the 2008 World Junior Championships in Athletics in a personal best time of 27:31.65 minutes after having come second at the Kenyan junior trials. He returned to the world stage in 2009, taking a silver medal in the junior race at the 2009 IAAF World Cross Country Championships behind pre-race favourite Ayele Abshero. He began competing on the European circuit towards the end of the year, running at the Cross de l'Acier and winning the Course de l'Escalade in Geneva in December. Mbishei stepped up to the senior ranks in 2010. He took fourth place at the Campaccio meeting and second at the Great Edinburgh Cross Country, but didn't manage to qualify for the senior men's team for the world cross that year. He enjoyed success on the roads, however, claiming victory at the Great Edinburgh Run and then at the World 10K Bangalore in May. He easily won the 10,000 m at the Kenya national selection event for the 2010 Commonwealth Games, gaining himself a place on the team. At the Games in New Delhi he just fell short of obtaining a medal, finishing in fourth place. He started his 2011 cross country preparation well with runner-up finishes at both the Antrim International Cross Country and the Cross de San Sebastián."

  "text" : "Sydney Edmund Tolchard Evans (20 September 1901 - 12 March 1978) was a British songwriter, composer, pianist and bandleader, whose works were popular from the 1920s to the 1960s. He was born in West Kilburn, London, the son of Edmund George Evans and his wife Maud, née Tolchard. The family later moved to Willesden, where Evans lived for the rest of his life. He started playing piano at the age of six, and studied orchestration and conducting with a view to becoming a classical musician, but in 1919 joined the staff of the Lawrence Wright popular music publishing company. In 1924, he left to work as a pianist for silent films and dance bands, before establishing his own band at the Queen's Hotel, Westcliff-on-Sea, later moving to the Palace Hotel, Southend, where he stayed through most of the 1930s. He also achieved success as a songwriter, with his song \"Barcelona\" (1926) becoming an international hit. With lyricists Stanley Damerell and Robert Hargreaves, he formed the Cecil Lennox song publishing company, which published one of their most successful collaborations, \"Lady of Spain\" (co-credited to \"Erell Reaves\", a pseudonym for Damerell and Hargreaves), in 1931. Using an unfamiliar paso doble rhythm, it was turned down by several bands before being made successful by Jack Payne. He achieved further success as a songwriter with \"Let's All Sing like the Birdies Sing\" (1932), co-written with Damerell, Hargreaves, and Harry Tilsley, and successfully recorded by Henry Hall; \"Faith\" and \"If (They Made Me a King)\" (1934); \"The Song of the Trees\" and \"There's a Lovely Lake in London\" (1935); \"I Hear Your Voice\" (1942); and \"Sailor, Who are You Dreaming of Tonight?\" (1944). At one time, four of his songs were being used by major London dance bands as signature tunes. He was often featured on BBC radio, notably with his \"Tuneful Twenties\" series from 1949 on. In 1951, his career was boosted when Perry Como's version of \"If\" sold over a million copies. Evans spent some time in the US, and the following year Eddie Fisher's recording of \"Lady of Spain\" also became a best-seller. His songs also continued to be successful in Britain, with \"Ev'rywhere\" winning an Ivor Novello Award in 1955, and David Whitfield having UK hits with \"My September Love\" (1956) and \"I'll Find You\" (1957). His own recording of \"The Singing Piano\" (1959) was used as a signature tune at Butlins holiday camps. He also appeared on British television. In 1973 he won an Ivor Novello Award for outstanding services to British music. He married Phyllis Elizabeth Mayhead in 1931; they had two sons. He died in London in 1978, aged 76."

  "text" : "Tamara Shayne (25 November 1902 – 23 October 1983, also known as Tamara Nikoulin) was a Russian-born actress long resident in the United States. Tamara Shayne was born in Perm, Russia, to the family of a Jewish actor Veniamin Olkenitsky-Nikulin (ru) (Benjamin Nikulin); her older brother was the actor Konstantin Shayne. Shayne appeared in European films before migrating to the United States in 1929 with her future husband, the actor Akim Tamiroff; the couple married in 1932. On Broadway Shayne appeared in The Cherry Orchard, Judgment Day and These Few Ashes. Her first role (uncredited) in an American film was in Ninotchka (1939) as Anna, the cellist roommate in Moscow of the lead character played by Greta Garbo. Shayne is possibly best remembered as Moma Yoelson in The Jolson Story (1946) and Jolson Sings Again (1949), though Shayne appeared in nearly two dozen films from 1934 to 1961. Shayne remained married to Akim Tamiroff until his death in 1972, and she retired at that time. She died from complications following a heart attack."

He was elected as President of the National Union of Students (NUS) in 1968, as a moderate candidate, defeating the then-radical Jack Straw. During his term in office, he toured South Africa, where he supported British academics taking up posts in white-only universities. He launched a campaign for the reform of British universities, but attracted criticism for asking students not to attend protests against the Vietnam War, and opposed removing a \"no politics\" clause from the NUS constitution. In 1969, he became the first incumbent President of the NUS to lose a bid for re-election until 2016, being defeated by Straw. Fisk was also assistant to the General Secretary of the National Union of Teachers, and was a member of the Fabian Society. After leaving student politics, he worked in the United Kingdom for British Steel Corporation. Fisk emigrated with his family to the United States in 1978, where he was an innovator in the field of healthcare marketing. He first worked for Cooper Medical Center in Camden, New Jersey and then for Thomas Jefferson University Hospital in Philadelphia. He was also an adjunct lecturer at the University of Pennsylvania on Health Care Marketing. He died suddenly on 14 March 1993 while on a business trip in Orlando Florida."

  "text" : "Tom D. Walshaw (1912–1998) was an engineer, author and contributor to the British magazine Model Engineer. Many of his magazine contributions and books were authored under the pseudonym Tubal Cain. The pseudonym relates to the Tubal-cain, the biblical metal worker. As Tubal Cain he made over 424 contributions to Model Engineer, beginning in 1971. These were mainly divided between workshop equipment articles and model stationary engine constructional articles. He graduated in mechanical engineering at Loughborough University in 1934, and eventually, after a career in mechanical design, went back to that university in 1943, becoming, after some years, senior lecturer in mechanical engineering. He went on in 1948 to teach at University of Liverpool. In 1952 he was appointed Head of Department of Mechanical, Civil and Electrical Engineering at Darlington College of Technology. His final academic post was Head of Mechanical, Production and Civil Engineering at Lancashire Polytechnic. He gained the first of his many model engineering exhibition awards in 1949. At one point he was editor of the Transactions of the Newcomen Society. Walshaw died on 2 May 1998."

  "text" : "Truman Taylor has been a popular television personality in southeastern New England for more than four decades. Beginning as a general assignment reporter, he was the principal evening news anchor on the (then) WTEV; and late the same station as WLNE-TV (ABC 6), Providence, RI from 1964 through 1980. He reported through the turbulent 1960s and 70s on the major stories of those decades; the assassination of the Kennedy brothers and Martin Luther King, Jr.; and the demonstrations and street disturbances that brought shootings and fires to some of southeastern New England's core cities. And the Vietnam War protests that roiled the campuses of area colleges. Named Director of Programming for the station in the late 1980s he retired from his administrative duties at the station in January 2001. However, he continued, until December 2005, to moderate the Sunday interview program, \"Truman Taylor,\" that he had begun in 1963. Among the guests on the program have been 2 U.S. Presidents, three future presidents and scores of newsmakers from both the local and national scene. The program has received four Emmy nominations including one for \"Jobathon.\" In the economically hard hit southeastern New England of the 1980s, \"Jobathon,\" aired live in prime time from four cities in Rhode Island and Massachusetts, and put more than 400 unemployed people back to work. \"Jobathon\" won him a personal commendation and an invitation to the White House from President Ronald Reagan. He is the recipient of the National Television Academy's Silver Circle and Gold Circle Awards and is a member of the Academy's Board of Directors. Truman Taylor of course will always be remembered for his legendary tag-line used to sign off at the end of every newscast\"Have a good night tonight and a better day tomorrow\" Truman Taylor's commentaries on the passing scene were heard at the end of each of his Sunday programs. They currently appear regularly on the op-ed pages of the Providence Journal and other newspapers throughout the country."

There, he met members of the People's Will and Polish socialist groups, and he joined the student movement, becoming in 1883 a member of the central committee of the First Proletariat party. Rechniewski was arrested and sentenced to fourteen years in prison. In 1886, Rechniewski arrived at the harsh Kariyskaya labor camps, where he led study sessions on Marx's Das Kapital and survived the Kariyskaya tragedy. In 1889, Rechniewski was joined by his wife, who was helping to support political prisoners. In 1894, he was sent to settle in the Transbaikal region, where he worked as a draftsman in the construction of the Trans-Siberian Railroad. In 1901, he moved to Irkutsk, where he worked for the newspaper Eastern Review (Восточное обозрение). During all this time, he continued his revolutionary activities and organized escapes for other exiles. During the 1905 Russian Revolution, Rechniewski was arrested for participating in rallies. After being freed, he went to Poland and became one of the leaders of the Polish Socialist Party – Left (one of the precursors of the Polish Communist Party) and editor of its organ from 1906 to 1914. In 1915, he was one of the founders of the People's University in Warsaw."

  "text" : "Theodor des Coudres (March 13, 1862 in Veckerhagen, Weser – October 8, 1926 in Leipzig) was a German physicist. Theodor des Coudres was the son of Julius des Coudres and his wife Anna Henrietta Rosenstock. His younger brother, Richard des Coudres, later became president of the \"Mitteldeutschen Sängerbundes\" (Central German singer federation); his uncle on the paternal side was the painter Ludwig des Coudres. In 1881 des Coudres began to study natural science and medicine at the University of Geneva and later in Leipzig and Munich. At the Humboldt University of Berlin in 1887, he successfully finished his study with a thesis on the optical constants of mercury with Professor Hermann von Helmholtz. 1889 he was employed at the University of Leipzig as an assistant of Professor Gustav Heinrich Wiedemann. His research led him to his Habilitation in 1891. 1895 he was appointed to the University of Goettingen at the chair for \"applied electricity\". In 1901 he went to the University of Würzburg and took over the chair for theoretical physics as an extraordinary professor. In 1903 he became the successor of Professor Ludwig Boltzmann at the University of Leipzig, where he worked until the end of his life. Sometimes he suffered from an enormous writer's block and could handle this problem only during long trips by railway. Theodor des Coudres died at the age of 64 years on October 8, 1926 in Leipzig. The publisher Georg Hirzel and the physicist Otto Wiener wrote noteworthy obituaries on Theodor des Coudres. Des Coudres worked among other things on metal reflection, the Kerr effect, high pressure physics, and he was the first to determine the specific charge and the speed of alpha particles."

  "text" : "Theodore Major 19 February 1908 – 17 January 1999) was an English artist who was considered a great individualist in the British art world. Born in Wigan, England, Major insisted that he was essentially self-taught as an artist. He actually studied at Wigan Art School between 1927–1932, and taught there between 1930-1950, and in 1952 founded the Wigan Arts Club. Major established a reputation as a Lancashire artist. He drew cartoons for the Daily Mail and the Manchester Guardian. He shared exhibitions with his close contemporary L. S. Lowry. Major became noted for his grim depictions of Wigan streets and factories, pictures of children, of lonely seascapes, of nudes and nightmare imaginations. \"To disturb and extend consciousness in the mind of the viewer\" was his declared aim. He declined to sell pictures, \"not to the people who want them, the rich people\".  He eventually had to buy the house next door as a store. He used a small front bedroom, with a good light, as a studio. He kept around 3000 of his pictures back from sale, saying that they were painted for ordinary people, not money. He used the house next door as a gallery & the general public were welcome to view his paintings for free. The art critic and novelist John Berger called Major's pictures \"among the best English paintings of our time\"."

Danos successfully represented Julian Michael Clarke before the Victorian Court of Appeal in 2005. Clarke's conviction at a first trial before the Supreme Court of Victoria in 2004 for the murder of Melbourne solicitor Keith William Allan, together with co-accused Sudo Cavkic and Costas Athanasi, was annulled, and a re-trial ordered. Argument by Danos in relation to the definition of reasonable doubt, that the jury should have been told by the trial judge that it should not be construed as a percentage, was accepted by the Court of Appeal. This judgment of the Court of Appeal created an important precedent in Australian law. Danos represented Clarke subsequently at the second trial in 2006 and third trial in 2007. The second trial resulted in a hung jury, but Clarke, together with his two other co-accused, were convicted at the third trial."

  "text" : "Tom Browne born Thomas Arthur Browne (8 December 1870 Nottingham - 16 March 1910 Shooter's Hill), was an extremely popular English strip cartoonist, painter and illustrator of the late Victorian and Edwardian periods. Browne started earning a wage as a milliner's errand boy in 1882. From there he was apprenticed to a lithographic printer and eked out a living with freelance cartoons for London comic papers. He received 30 shillings for his first strip, published by the magazine Scraps, and called \"He Knew How To Do It\". Comic Cuts, a British comic book was founded by Alfred Harmsworth in 1890. Cheaply printed, it proved to be the ideal medium for Browne's bold drawing style. Browne's comic strips soon became so popular that he moved to London and into a studio in Wollaton House at Westcombe Park. Here he turned out six full-page strips a week, but also managed to produce illustrations for several British magazines. His cartoons appeared in Punch, The Tatler and other highly rated periodicals of the day. The logo of Johnnie Walker whiskey, the strutting, monocled character, was created by Browne in 1908. Browne was a founding member of the London Sketch Club, was publicly acclaimed and was made a Royal Illustrator. His cycling trips took him all over the world, while illustrations of these exploits appeared in the newspapers. Returning to Nottingham, he started a colour printing firm and joined the Territorial Army. He also created the comic strip 'Weary Willy and Tired Tim', inspired by Don Quixote and Sancho Panza, which appeared on the front page of Illustrated Chips from 1896 to 1953. Browne played a major part in the evolution of the British comic style, influencing Bruce Bairnsfather, Dudley Watkins and Leo Baxendale. His strip 'Airy Alf and Bouncing Billy' first appeared in The Big Budget around 1900, and was later continued by Ralph Hodgson aka \"Yorick\". His comic, Dan Leno, portrayed the Victorian English music hall comedian and appeared in Dan Leno's Comic Journal in 1898. Echoes of his impudent urchins can still be seen in The Beano and The Dandy today. More of his characters were 'Little Willy and Tiny Tim', 'Mr. Stankey Deadstone and Company', 'The Rajah' and 'Don Quixote de Tintogs'. Browne died after surgery for cancer at the age of 39. He was buried with military honours at Shooter's Hill."

  "text" : "Thomas M. Blackstock (January 12, 1834 – February 27, 1913) was an Irish-American Republican politician and businessman who spent most of his life in Wisconsin. Born in County Armagh, in what is now Northern Ireland, Blackstock settled first in Canada and then in 1849 moved to Sheboygan, Wisconsin. There, he bought a drug store and eventually owned a farm, a bank (the Sheboygan Mutual Loan, Saving, and Building Association), and real estate (via the South Sheboygan Land Company). Blackstock participated in the establishment of the Phoenix Chair Company, serving as Secretary, then as President and General Manager, and ultimately gaining a controlling interest in the company. In November 1861, Blackstock married Bridget Denn, of Waterford, Ireland. In 1882, the Blackstocks had an Italianate style home built for them on a small hilltop site in the Ellis Addition area of Sheboygan, which is now listed on U.S. National Register of Historic Places. Thomas and Bridget Blackstock were childless, but around 1890 adopted three of Bridget's brother's children, Mary, Nellie, and Annie, after the death of their mother. In 1868, Blackstock served a term in the Wisconsin State Assembly. In 1883-1885, Blackstock was mayor of Sheboygan and also served on the Sheboygan Common Council."

Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band by the Beatles, in which he revealed the group's extensive drug use; an in-depth look at Frank Sinatra and his alleged Mafia ties; and the 40th and 50th birthdays of Elizabeth Taylor. His book Hearts (1971) concerned the rivalry between Houston surgeons Michael DeBakey and Denton Cooley at the dawn of the heart transplant era. Richie: The Ultimate Tragedy Between One Decent Man and the Son He Loved (1973) was the story of a Long Island man who killed his drug-addicted son. This was made into a TV-movie called The Death of Richie. Thompson's most successful book, \"LOST\" (1975), was his unapologetic telling of the true story of two men who were lost at sea after a tragic boating accident. Their brutal 'against all odds' struggle to survive was brilliantly captured in this riveting expose of human torture so unimaginable as to shock and disturb readers to their core. The story unveils the awesome truth of what the human spirit can endure in graphic but restrained detail. Thompson's \"LOST\" was retold in a made for TV movie in 1984. Blood and Money (1976) was based on a true story of scandal and the murders of Houston socialite Joan Robinson Hill and her husband John Hill, and the alleged involvement of Mrs. Hill's father, Ash Robinson, a wealthy Texas oil magnate. The book sold four million copies in fourteen languages. There were three lawsuits against Thompson after the book's publication. Ann Kurth, John Hill's second wife, sued Thompson for his description of her as a \"sex bomb\". Kurth's suit and that of a Longview, Texas police officer, were both dismissed. Ash Robinson, the father of Joan Robinson Hill, also sued Thompson for his portrayal in the book; Robinson was unsuccessful in his suit against Thompson. Robinson had been allowed to read the book prior to its publication and initially said he approved of what Thompson had written about him. His only criticism was that he believed the book was too long. Thompson's publishers withheld his royalties until all suits connected with the book were settled. Thompson also wrote Serpentine (1979), the story of convicted murderer Charles Sobhraj. Thompson wrote one novel, Celebrity (1982), which was on the national best-seller list for six months. That novel became the basis for a five-hour mini series in 1984. Thompson received the National Headliner Award for investigative reporting. He was also the 1977 Edgar Award winner for Blood and Money. Thompson's family believed that the liver disease that caused his death was contracted in the Far East while investigating the Charles Sobhraj saga. When he became ill, Thompson was teaching writing at the University of Southern California. Among his survivors were two sons, Kirk and Scott."

Some Visigothic king lists skip Theudigisel, as well as Agila I, going directly from Theudis to Athanagild. Theudigisel was a leading general of Theudis, and, when the latter was murdered, managed to make himself king. He had repelled the Franks from Spain after their invasion of 541, cutting them off in the pass of Valcarlos, but accepted a bribe to allow them to return to home. According to Isidore of Seville, Theudigisel was assassinated because he \"defiled the marriages of very many powerful men by public prostitution\", and was assassinated by a group of conspirators during a banquet in Seville. Although he agrees that Theudigisel died during a banquet, Gregory of Tours records a different tale of his end: in the middle of the feast, the lights were blown out and an unidentified person killed Theudigisel in the dark. \"The Goths had adopted the reprehensible habit of killing out of hand any king who displeased them and replacing him on the throne by someone they preferred,\" Gregory concludes."

He is also credited with inventing a water level, a carpenter's square, and, according to Pliny, a lock and key and the turning lathe. According to Vitruvius (vii, introduction), Theodorus is the architect of the Doric Order temple Heraion of Samos temple. In some texts he is described, above all, as a great artist and in some statues he is depicted as a great inventor. The ancient historian Herodotus, also from Samos, twice refers to Theodorus as \"the son of Telecles,\" a Samian artist. Herodotus credits Theodorus along with Rhoecus with improving the process of mixing copper and tin to form bronze, as well as being the first to use it in casting. Elsewhere, he credits Theodorus alone for discovering the art of fusing iron and using it to cast statues. Carl Sagan, in the episode \"The Backbone of Night\" from his series Cosmos, claims Theodorus invented the level, the ruler, the key, the square, the lathe, and bronze casting."

A skilled kaikaranga, McGarvey advocated for education and the retention of Māori language and customs, and played an active role in tribal issues. During the 1940s she became an active member of the Te Wharekura o Ruatoki school. She mentored and tutored Māori cultural groups from around New Zealand and she was a judge at kapa haka competitions in New Zealand and Australia. Born in 1927, McGarvey was a niece of soldier and community leader Henry Te Reiwhati Vercoe, and a first cousin of Whakahuihui Vercoe, who was the Archbishop of New Zealand from 2004 to 2006. The Māori educator Turuhira Hare is her daughter. In 2009 McGarvey was a recipient of the Sir Kingi Ihaka award at the Creative New Zealand Te Waka Toi Awards in recognition for her \"lifetime contribution to the development and retention of Māori arts and culture.\" McGarvey died on 5 June 2015, in Ruatoki. Her body was taken to Waikirikiri marae, where she lay in state for four days. Mourners at her tangi included former MP Tuku Morgan and the Māori king, Tuheitia Paki. Former Māori news presenter and actor Waihoroi Shortland attended the tangi and said that McGarvey was \"the voice that guided Tūhoe in hard times.\" Te Uruhina was survived by her 8 children, over 90 of her great-grandchildren, and over 100 of her direct descendants."

  "text" : "Terry Allen Meiners, born January 22, 1957, is an American radio and television personality on WHAS (AM) and WHAS-TV in Louisville, Kentucky. On radio, The Terry Meiners Show has aired weekday afternoons since 1985, with the show airing 3–7 pm from 1985 to May 15, 2015 and now from 3–6 pm. Meiners is known for broadcasting impersonations of prominent local citizens, and his satirical interviews of eclectic news figures, comedians, film and television stars, and politicians. In a region that thrives on college sports, Meiners lampoons the flightiness of University of Louisville (U of L) Cardinals fans and the zealotry of University of Kentucky (UK) Wildcats fans. Many of Meiners' fabricated callers are dimwitted sports fans delivering a tirade on the air, who then close with the contradictory statement \"I'll hang up and listen to your answer.\" Additional Meiners radio sketches include conversations with imaginary characters like a street-tough problem solver named Trubba Man, an arrogant Hollywood has-been, a delusional Elvis impersonator, a pair of foulmouthed morning deejays who speak in unison, and a character variously called \"Beasman\" and \"Old Joe\". The last of these is a parody of both overzealous UK fans and former UK basketball coach Joe B. Hall. Several part-time voice impersonators have worked with Meiners over the years, including actor Jeff Ketterman, singer Laura Cox, writer Laura Johnston, singer Randy Davidson, and comedian Chuck Knipp (Shirley Q .Liquor). Meiners is also known for his offbeat television interviews with sometimes tipsy fans at sporting events such as the Kentucky Derby and Kentucky Oaks. Meiners is a co-host of Great Day Live (news, knowledge, and nonsense) with WHAS-TV news anchor Rachel Platt, weekday mornings on WHAS-TV. \"Great Day Live\" debuted with No. 1 ratings in its time slot. Meiners' Friday television interviews on the early show Good Morning Kentuckiana often take a comic twist. Pat Forde, a Louisville resident who was once a sportswriter for the city's daily newspaper, The Courier-Journal, and now writes for Yahoo! Sports, has called Meiners \"a skilled smart aleck, a local legend who is able to skewer almost everyone without making too many enemies.\""

  "text" : "Thoros (short in Armenian for Theodoros; Թորոս կուրապաղատ, T'oros the Curopalates; d. March 9, 1098) was an Armenian ruler of Edessa at the time of the First Crusade. Thoros was a former officer (curopalates) in the Byzantine Empire and a lieutenant of Philaretos Brachamios. He was Armenian but practiced the Greek Orthodox faith. The Chronicle of Matthew of Edessa records that \"Thoros son of Hethum\" was installed as governor of Edessa by Tutush, who had defeated and killed emir Bouzan in the year 543 of the Armenia era (26 Feb. 1094 - 25 Feb. 1095). According to Sturdza, Hethum [I] was descended from the Pahlavouni, an important family in Caucasian Armenia. He conquered land to the east of that conquered by his fellow Armenian Rupen. Steven Runciman calls Thoros the \"son-in-law\" of Gabriel of Melitene. Around 1094, the Seljuk emir of Damascus, Tutush I, captured Edessa and established Thoros as governor. Thoros immediately tried to take control of the city for himself; when Yaghi-Siyan, emir of Antioch, and Ridwan, emir of Aleppo, took refuge in Edessa after being defeated by Malik Shah I, Thoros tried to take them captive and ransom them. The other Edessan nobles did not agree with this and they were freed. Thoros then fortified Edessa and cut off the citadel, garrisoned by Turkish and Armenian troops. The Turks and Ortoqids besieged the city for two months, but were unable to capture it even after breaking through the walls. The Turks withdrew and Thoros was recognized as lord of the city. As a Greek Orthodox Christian, he was not well loved by his Armenian subjects in Edessa. He resisted attacks from the Seljuks, but in 1098 had to ask for help from the crusaders, who were occupied at the siege of Antioch. Baldwin of Boulogne had come to Edessa rather than participate in the siege, probably looking to carve out some territory for himself, and had captured Turbessel. Thoros invited him to Edessa and made an alliance with him in February 1098. Baldwin gradually convinced Thoros to adopt him as his son and heir, but having done this, Baldwin attacked Thoros' officers and besieged him in the citadel. Thoros agreed to let him have the city and made plans to flee with his family to Melitene, but shortly afterwards, on March 9, Thoros was assassinated by the Armenian inhabitants of the city, possibly at Baldwin's command, and Baldwin became the first count of Edessa."

  "text" : "Thomas Fletcher Waghorn (1800–1850), whose statue stands in Chatham, Kent, was a postal pioneer who developed a new route from Great Britain to India. Waghorn's route reduced the journey from 16,000 miles, via the Cape of Good Hope, to 6,000 miles: from three months to between 35 and 45 days. Waghorn was born in Chatham, England, and baptised at St Mary's Church on 16 July 1800. His father, also Thomas, was a butcher and had married Ann Goodhugh at All Saints' Church, Snodland, on 28 July 1794. At twelve years of age, Thomas entered the Royal Navy at Chatham, joining HMS Bahama as a midshipman in November 1812. He married Elizabeth Bartlett at St John's Cathedral, Calcutta, in 1822. He became a pilot and took an interest in the early attempts at establishing a steamship route from England to India and the East. But the East India Company—which effectively ran that continent for Britain—showed a remarkable indifference to his ideas. After leaving the Navy as a lieutenant in 1832, he made the journey to India via Egypt as an experiment to send mail. Disastrously, the journey took four and a half months—but on his way back, he met the Pasha of Egypt, who supported his desert route idea. Personal tragedy followed in March 1834 when his wife died in Calcutta. By December, however, Waghorn had remarried—to Harriet Martin, daughter of the miller at Snodland and a neighbour of his mother. That month, he also inherited a substantial estate from his grandfather, and the couple lived in Rochester until building The Lodge in Snodland’s upper High Street about 1841. Waghorn's business plan began to flourish. He set up an agency in Cornhill, London, for conveying post—and passengers—to India via Egypt. Between 1835 and 1837, he lived among Arabs in the desert and laid the foundations for the overland route across the desert from Cairo to Suez. This involved building rest-houses and supplying guides, boats, horses and carriages for travelers. He became deputy consul in Egypt in 1837 but soon fell out with the authorities. From 1840, P&O set up in competition with him, backed by the British government. Then came another setback: 300 horses died in a plague. It was the end—and the Pasha bought him out. Waghorn turned his attention to speeding the post in Europe, through the new railway system. He was successful, but the Government reneged on a deal to pay his expenses, for the trials left him £5,000 in debt. Waghorn died at his London home in Islington on 7 January 1850. He was buried at All Saints', Snodland, just outside the vestry door. The south wall of the nave bears a memorial to him. A statue of Waghorn was raised in Railway Street, Chatham, in 1888. Its inscription is: \"Thomas Waghorn - Lieutenant RN - Pioneer and founder of the overland route - Born at Chatham 1800 - Died January 7th 1850\"."

  "text" : "Thomas Augustus Watson (January 18, 1854 – December 13, 1934) was an assistant to Alexander Graham Bell, notably in the invention of the telephone in 1876. He is best known because, as the recipient of the first telephone call - although coming from just the next room - his name became the first words ever said over the phone. \"Mr. Watson - Come here - I want to see you,\" Bell said when first using the new invention, according to Bell's laboratory notebook. There is some dispute about the actual words used, as Thomas Watson, in his own voice, remembered it as \"Mr. Watson - Come here - I want you,\" in a film made for Bell Labs in 1931 which is referenced below in \"The Engines of our Ingenuity.\""

Given his reluctance to field research, he collected a considerable amount of specimens to be studied in collaboration with other scholars. During his many travels in Italy and abroad, he kept many contacts with famous malacologists. His scientific production was of considerable importance. He described many new species, enumerated the Mediterranean shells and studied the fossil deposits of Mount Pellegrino.

Their debut, Dead and Gone, was mixed by Barrett Jones (Foo Fighters, Nirvana, Pearl Jam). Soon after the release of the record, the band took an unexplained hiatus. Although the band never released a public statement regarding the hiatus, sources claim it was related to family health issues and not due to any sort of feud. Coffey announced in February 2011, that he and Smith will be co-producing a new record together under the moniker \"ASHA\". The title of the record is A.R.C. Coffey is slated to front the band, Smith is participating as a producer, and will not perform with the band. In 2012 he created and executive produced \"One Night Only\" a television series featuring up and coming bands, collaborating with better known acts. He is currently working on preproduction for his first feature length film. Tentatively titled Conor Wayne which he wrote and will direct. The film is set to shoot in winter 2016."

Literary historian F. L. Patee has described Female Quixotism (1801) as the most popular novel written in America prior to the publication of Uncle Tom's Cabin in 1852. Female Quixotism went through at least five editions and was still in print when Harriet Beecher Stowe wrote her landmark book. In 1788, she married Samuel Tenney, a former army surgeon. He was elected to Congress in 1788. They had no children. Upon her 1837 death in Exeter, she was buried at the Winter Street Burial Ground."

  "text" : "Tyson Edwards (born 6 August 1976) is a former Australian rules footballer with the Adelaide Football Club in the Australian Football League (AFL). Raised in the small Mallee town of Wynarka, around 120 km from Adelaide, he is widely regarded as one of the most consistent and durable players in the game. Between the ages of 11 and 15, Edwards' mother Jan would drive him the 250 km round trip to Adelaide at least twice a week so that he could train with West Adelaide's junior teams. He is married to Mandy with three sons - Jackson, Luke and Brodie. Recruited from West Adelaide in the SANFL, Edwards made his AFL debut in 1995 and has since established himself as one of the AFL's most consistent and underrated midfielders. This is to such an extent that he has not won any of the AFL's major awards, or even a club best and fairest award; his greatest honour to date has been featuring in Adelaide's 1997 and 1998 premiership sides. In 2008 he placed 4th in the Crows Club Champion voting with 137 again highlighting his consistency within the playing group. Edwards played his 300th game for the Adelaide Crows against Essendon in Round 11, 2009. The Crows won the match 21.4 (130) - 18.6 (114), and Edwards celebrated by gathering an equal career best 41 possessions. Four games later he and dual premiership teammate Andrew McLeod played their 290th match together, a VFL/AFL record. On 27 May 2010, Edwards announced his retirement from the AFL effective immediately after being dropped from the Adelaide side. Coach Neil Craig later agreed to allow Edwards a farewell game, his 321st, the next week against Fremantle in Adelaide. The decision worked wonders, with the Crows upsetting the second-placed Dockers by 23 points, with Edwards again celebrating his milestone with a best-on-ground 32-possession two-goal effort. On 19 March 2011 Edwards revealed he had battled testicular cancer in his final year at the Adelaide Crows, in what he described as his 'year from hell'. Edwards was an assistant coach at the Port Adelaide Football Club from seasons 2012 to 2015."

  "text" : "Theodore Skoutariotes (Greek: Θεόδωρος Σκουταριώτης) was a Byzantine cleric and official during the reign of Michael VIII Palaiologos (r. 1259–1282). Skoutariotes was born ca. 1230. As a deacon, he served as epi ton deeseon (receiver of petitions) and was named as dikaiophylax in 1270. He served as Michael VIII's ambassador to the Pope in 1277, and was metropolitan bishop of Kyzikos from 1277 until he was deposed in 1282. The German historian A. Heisenberg identified Skoutariotes with the anonymous author of a chronicle preserved in the Marcian Library in Venice (Marc. gr. 407), which begins with the Creation and reaches to 1261. The chronicle is particularly valuable for its additions to the narrative of George Akropolites, which are of great importance for the history of 13th-century Byzantium."

  "text" : "Antonio Parretti (1892 - February 17, 1927), also known as Tony Parretti or Tony the Shoemaker, was a Camorra gangster. He was a member of the Brooklyn based Coney Island gang in New York City, serving as the right-hand man of Pellegrino Morano. He received a death sentence for his part in the killing of Nicholas Morello and Charles Ubriaco on September 7, 1916, during the Mafia–Camorra War. Paretti originally fled to Italy to escape capture, while his brother Aniello Paretti was imprisoned charged with another murder. Both were also involved in the murder of Joe Nazzaro. He returned to New York in March 1926, confident that most of the witnesses against him would no longer be there. Nevertheless, Paretti was convicted for first degree murder, despite witnesses who \"suddenly developed a surprising lack of memory\" - replying \"I cannot remember\" to all questions asked of them. However, the prosecution was able convince a fellow gangster, Alphonso Sgroia, to come back from Italy and testify against Paretti. Leading to his execution security in Sing Sing prison was enhanced from 16 hours a day to 24 hours a day. He was pressuring politicians to deny the death penalty but this was not granted. He was electrocuted on February 17, 1927, at the age of 35. One of his last visitors was future Mafia boss, Vito Genovese, and his brother Aniello who had spent 8 months on death row himself before being released."

Like Ballou and Ballou's grand-nephew, Hosea Ballou II, first president of Tufts College, Whittemore contributed to Universalist historiography by identifying precedents for Universalist beliefs in earlier Christianity. With Thomas J. Sawyer of New York, he co-founded the Universalist Historical Society in 1834. These histories were influential in bringing many readers to regard the Christians of the first centuries as Universalists."

  "text" : "Theo Maximilian Berger (25 January 1941 — 20 November 2003) was a notorious Bavarian criminal, best known for his numerous escapes from prison. Despite escaping four times, Berger spent 36 years in jail and eventually committed suicide there. Berger had been sentenced to a collective 137 years in jail. In 1986, he became the subject of a documentary titled Der Al Capone vom Donaumoos (English: The Al Capone of the Donaumoos) and later wrote his memoirs, which were smuggled out of Straubing prison. In 2006, he also became the subject of a theatre play in Neuburg an der Donau titled Bruchstücke (English: Shards). In his time, Berger received a number of nicknames, among them Al Capone vom Donaumoos, König der Ausbrecher (English:King of the jail breakers) or Der schöne Theo (English:The beautiful Theo). He was at times compared to some of the other legendary Bavarian criminals and robbers, the Räuber Kneißl and the Bayerische Hiasl."

  "text" : "Thomas Cawthron (25 May 1833 – 8 October 1915) was a New Zealand businessman and philanthropist responsible for the establishment of the Cawthron research institute. Thomas Cawthron was born at Newington, Surrey, on 25 May 1833 and was 15 years old when his parents and family set out for Nelson, New Zealand, in the sailing ship Mary. He worked in Wellington, then followed the gold miners to Australia, spending several years as a contractor for miscellaneous goods on the goldfields of Bendigo and Ballarat. Returning to Nelson in the mid-1850s when his father became ill, he won a contract to dig the test drives for copper deposits on the Dun Mountain, going on to contract for the supply of food and stores for the copper-mining project and for the Jenkins Hill coal mine. He delivered supplies to miners in the rough Mineral Belt country, around 20 km away by a mountainous track from the Nelson township. Many fortunes were made and lost in New Zealand’s 19th century gold rushes. Cawthron invested in property, shares, local bodies, war loans and mortgages and seemed to have a ‘golden touch’ in all his business transactions. A canny merchant, he amassed his wealth from offices in the beached hulk of a ship at Nelson, but most of his money came through the hunt for coal and copper and from sending supplies to gold miners in Golden Bay and Hokitika. By the time of his retirement in the late 1880s, he had amassed a considerable fortune. After his retirement, he lived quietly and frugally with his sister Mrs Wright. He seemed to have few interests other than the investment and care of his money. However, behind the scenes, he helped out in many individual cases of hardship and distress and contributed to causes such as relief funds, church organisations and educational and recreational schemes. In his later years, he made larger and more public gifts, including the Cathedral steps, the Rocks Road chains, Cawthron Park (in the hills to the east of the city), contributions towards a public hospital and nurses' home, and smaller donations to the Nelson Institute (which used to run the Nelson library), the Nelson School of Music and its pipe organ. Thomas Cawthron died on 8 October 1915. He bequeathed £231,000, practically the whole of his estate, for the development of an industrial and technical school, institute and museum to be called the Cawthron Institute. This was officially opened in 1921 with Thomas Hill Easterfield, emeritus professor of chemistry at Victoria University College, as its first director."

  "text" : "Sir Thomas Burgh (pronounced: Borough), KG (c. 1431- 18 March 1496) was an English gentleman. In records, the peerage, and genealogy books he is shown as being created 1st Lord Burgh, of Gainsborough [England by writ] on 1 September 1487. He was several times summoned to Parliament, but never sat; whether he held a hereditary peerage is debatable; fifteenth century records treat him as a knight. His son was never summoned to Parliament [because he was found insane in 1510]; his grandson was summoned and sat in the House of Lords, but sixteenth century records treat this as a new creation in 1529 after the death of his father. When the Burgh peerage was drawn out of abeyance in 1916, however, it was given precedence as of 1487. He had noble ancestors on both sides: his mother was one of the daughters of Sir Henry Percy, who was in turn grandson to Henry Percy, 1st Earl of Northumberland and to David of Strathbogie, Earl of Atholl, descended from the ancient Mormaers of Atholl. The Burgh family sprang from Hubert de Burgh, younger son of Hubert de Burgh, 1st Earl of Kent and his wife Beatrice de Warrenne, daughter of William de Warrenne, Lord of Wormegay, and Beatrice de Pierrepont. The Burghs were rich, flamboyant and powerful people. Thomas was in great favour with the King as many offices, positions, land grants, and pensions were bestowed upon him."

  "text" : "Thore Albert Boye (27 October 1912 – 1 October 1999) was a Norwegian diplomat. He was born in Kristiania as a son of Supreme Court Justice Thorvald Boye (1871–1943) and Mia Esmarch (1880–1966). In 1945 he married Nøste Siem (1918–1999), a daughter of Ole Siem and sister of Martin Siem. He took the cand.jur. degree in 1936, and was an attorney and deputy judge in Tromsø before being hired in the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs in 1938. After the Second World War reached Norway on 9 April 1940, and the government fled the capital, Boye set out on skis to catch up with them. After doing so he acted as a courier to Stockholm, returned to Molde where he followed the flight of the Norwegian National Treasury to Tromsø. From Tromsø, he left the country together with the government and royal family. They reached London, where Boye became a secretary in the Ministry of Finance-in-exile; from 1941 the Ministry of Defence-in-exile. He was promoted to assistant secretary in 1942. From 1944 he participated in the rebuilding after the liberation of Northern Norway, and in the spring of 1945 he was a secretary for the provisional government in Oslo, awaiting the return of the real government from exile after the war. He was a legation concellor in Belgium from 1946 to 1948, assistant secretary in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs from 1948 to 1949, secretary-general for the Northern European group in NATO from 1949 to 1951. He was promoted to sub-director in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in 1951 and deputy under-secretary of state in 1953. From 1955 to 1961 he worked as vice chief executive in the SAS Group, and he served as the Norwegian ambassador to Italy from 1961 to 1965. From 1962 he doubled as the ambassador to Greece. He was then the permanent under-secretary of state (the highest-ranking civil position) in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs from 1965 to 1971, then the Norwegian ambassador to Spain from 1972 to 1977 and Sweden from 1977 to 1981.

Of that establishment Fich compiled a meagre necrology in Latin, styled ‘Mortilogium’ or ‘Obitarium.’ He was also the compiler or transcriber of a collection of memoranda, chiefly on ecclesiastical matters, known as the ‘White Book of Christ Church, Dublin,’ still preserved in that cathedral. The necrology was printed at Dublin by the Irish Archæological Society in 1844, with an introduction by James H. Todd, D.D. A reproduction of a page of the ‘White Book of Christ Church’ was given on plate i. of part iii. of ‘Facsimiles of National MSS. of Ireland,’ published in 1879. Fich died at Dublin in 1517, and was interred in Christ Church there, to which he had been a considerable benefactor. He would appear to have been related to Geoffrey Fych, dean of St. Patrick's, Dublin, 1529–37. In that cathedral is still extant a brass plate bearing the effigy of Geoffrey Fych and a monumental inscription."

At the Ruhpolding world championships in 2012 Bachmann became a double relay champion. Just as in 2011 she teamed up with Magdalena Neuner Andrea Henkel and Miriam Gössner. Bachmann turned in a near perfect performance needing just 1 spare round to clean the targets and putting in one of her strongest performances in a relay. Bachmann's strong individual performance in the relay was a perfect way to make up for poor shooting in the relay's in Hochfilzen and Antholz where she had one penalty loop which meant Germany finished off the podium. Bachmann finished the 2011/2012 world cup season 14th overall with 546pts."

He studied under Bartolozzi, but more especially under William Wynne Ryland, to whom he acted both as pupil and assistant, and was so much engaged on the engravings bearing that artist's name, that few original works of his own exist. After Ryland's disastrous end, Fielding produced some engravings in his own name. Among them were ‘The Meeting of Jacob and Rachael,’ and ‘Moses saved by Pharaoh's Daughter,’ after Thomas Stothard, R.A .; also ‘Theseus finding his Father's Sword and Sandals,’ and ‘The Death of Procris,’ after Angelica Kauffman, R.A. The latter are finely engraved in Ryland's stipple manner, and quite reach the level of that artist's productions. Little is known of his life, and the year of his death is unknown. Fielding should be distinguished from an engraver, John Fielding, who preceded him, and about 1750 engraved some prints after Hogarth and others."

The collection was best known from its frequent appearances at steam rallies through the 1970s and '80s. Varley's wagons were recognisable from their fine paintwork and signwriting, each named and prefixed Pendle .... Six of his rarer, and often unique survivors, were re-imported from Australia before restoration. Tom Varley died in the 1990s. His contribution to the preservation of steam vehicles in the UK has been widely recognised."

  "text" : "Sir Timothy Fetherstonhaugh (died 1651) was an English royalist during the English Civil War. Fetherstonhaugh was son of Henry Fetherstonhaugh of Kirkoswald, Cumberland, high sheriff of that county under James I, who was second son of Albany Fetherstonhaugh of Fetherstonhaugh, Northumberland, by his wife Lucy, daughter of Edmund Dudley of Yanwath, Westmoreland. His mother was Dorothy, daughter of Thomas Wybergh of Clifton, Westmoreland. In 1620 he was admitted a member of Gray's Inn. He was knighted at Whitehall on 1 April 1628. During the English Civil War he liberally contributed money to the royal cause, raised troops at his own expense, and served in the field. In 1642 he marched with Sir William Hudleston to King Charles at York, having under him three hundred foot. In February 1644 he left Oxford with introductions from the king and Lord Digby for Ireland, where he applied to Ormonde to send troops for the relief of Cumberland. At the Battle of Wigan Lane, Lancashire, 26 August 1651, he was taken prisoner, and after trial by court-martial at Chester he was beheaded in that city on 22 October, despite his plea that he had quarter for life given him. He married Bridget, daughter of Thomas Patrickson of Caswell-How in Ennerdale, Cumberland. Two of his sons were slain at the Battle of Worcester on 3 September 1651; the elder, Henry, had been knighted on the field there. The family's losses amounted, it is said, to 10,000l. In June 1661 two other sons, Philip and John, were obliged to petition for places as pages to the queen ‘to lessen the charges of their mother, who was brought very low by the late times’. The petition was granted. These appointments and the present of a portrait of Charles I are said to have been the only recompense the family received. In the chancel of Kirkoswald Church is a monument to the memory of Sir Timothy erected by his grandson Thomas. His portrait is given in the frontispiece of William Winstanley's ‘The Loyall Martyrology,’ 1665, from which an enlarged engraving was published in octavo."

Born in Long Beach, California, Crosby graduated from Wilson High School before receiving an A.B. from Stanford University in 1962, an LL.B. from UC Berkeley School of Law in 1965, and an LL.M. from the University of Virginia School of Law in 1988. Crosby worked for the National Labor Relations Board from 1965 to 1967, the Peace Corps in Peru from 1967 to 1969, and the Orange County District Attorney's office from 1969 to 1973. From 1973 to 1981, he worked in his own law firm. Governor Jerry Brown appointed Crosby to the Orange County Superior Court in 1981. Thirteen months later, Brown moved Crosby to the newly created Division Three of the Fourth District Court of Appeal in December 1982. As a graduate student at Berkeley, Crosby met his first wife, undergraduate Sharon Scott, with whom he had two sons: Scott (born during the 1970 Super Bowl) and Brett (born 1974). While a Justice of the Court of Appeal, he married his second wife, Patty."

In 1695 Watson inherited the fortune of the Earl of Strafford, including the Wentworth Woodhouse estate, as the son of second earl's sister Anne. This was in preference to the earl's nearer relative, Thomas Wentworth, and led to a fierce rivalry between the two men and their families. In recognition of the bequest, Watson adopted the name Wentworth, becoming Thomas Watson-Wentworth thereafter. He was a Member of Parliament for the Malton constituency from 1713 until 1722 and for Higham Ferrers in 1703–1714 and from 1722 until his death. He has a monument in York Minster.

  "text" : "Theodore M. Brantley (or Brantly) (February 12, 1851 – September 16, 1922) was the longest-serving Chief Justice of the Montana Supreme Court, serving for 23 years (1899–1922). Brantley was born near Lebanon, Tennessee. He came from a political family in Tennessee—two of his mother's brothers were elected governor of Tennessee (Neill S. Brown in 1847, John C. Brown in 1871).Brantley was educated at Southwestern Presbyterian University in Clarksville, Tennessee and the law school of Cumberland University in Lebanon, graduating in 1881. After practicing law for several years, Brantly became a professor of Ancient Languages, first at Illinois College and then at the College of Montana in Deer Lodge. After returning to the practice of law for several years, Brantley was elected District Judge in the 3rd Judicial District of Montana in 1892 and then Chief Justice of the Montana Supreme Court in the November 1898 elections. He remained Chief Justice until resigning for reasons of health shortly before his death in 1922, in Helena, Montana. Brantley's brother Erskine Brantly (1850–1936) was a prominent clergyman and school official in Oklahoma. (The rest of the family seems to have preferred the spelling Brantly, without the \"e\". Many period sources, however, spell Theodore Brantley's name with the added \"e\".) Brantley was married in 1891 to Lois Reat and had 3 children - Theodore Lee, Lois Brown, and Neill Duncan Brantly. (Note that his children seem to have reverted to the \"Brantly\" spelling.) Neill Duncan Brantly (1897–1972) joined the navy and became a Rear Admiral during World War II, commanding vessels at the Battle of Leyte Gulf. Lois Brown Brantly (1894–1972) married Francis A. Hazelbaker, who was lieutenant governor of Montana 1929–1933."

  "text" : "Thomas Magarey (25 February 1825 – 31 August 1902) was an Irish-born miller and pastoralist who, with his brother James, migrated to Nelson, New Zealand in 1842 (aged 17), and to Adelaide, South Australia in 1845 (aged 20). He was also one of the Members of the South Australian House of Assembly, 1860–1862 for West Torrens, and one of the South Australian Legislative Council 1865-1867. He was also intensely religious, setting up the first Church of Christ in Australia by 1849, and later joined the Plymouth Brethren, being interested in their writings since 1873. Magarey was born in County Down, Ireland. He married Elizabeth Verco on 13 March 1848, first living at Noarlunga, then moving to Hindmarsh in 1849 where, with his brother James, he had bought the Hindmarsh flour-mill from John Ridley. In the 1850s he moved to Enfield, South Australia. Elizabeth and Thomas had 10 children and many grandchildren. In 1880 he joined the Plymouth Brethren, leaving the Church of Christ. He was very public spirited “At quite an early stage of his life he had embarked on a project of acquiring blocks of land in the country, and renting them reasonable to struggling farmers, to whom he would give the right of purchase. Over the years he had the satisfaction of seeing a number of poor men become comparatively well-off landowners through their application and industry”. In 1876 TM also contributed “100 guineas(guinea= £1/1)” to help found the Adelaide Children’s Hospital. In 1890 TM gave a Fire Engine to the Hindmarsh Volunteer Fire Brigade(Presented on November 9, 1890). He died at his farm at Enfield on 31 August 1902."

  "text" : "Thomas Cantock (died 1309) was an English-born cleric and judge in medieval Ireland, who held the offices of Bishop of Emly and Lord Chancellor of Ireland. O'Flanagan, writing in 1870, complained that any biographer of Cantock was faced with an almost complete lack of information about his life, and not a great deal more is known about him today. He was English by birth, and was probably a relative of the Roger de Cantock who held the manor of Dyrham, Gloucestershire in 1347, and died in 1349; the family had earlier connections with Bristol. Roger's father, also named Roger, visited Ireland during Thomas' tenure as Lord Chancellor, possibly to solicitor a favour from him. Thomas began his career as a clerk in royal service; he was sent by King Edward I on a mission to Scotland in 1288 with the title of Master. He was known to be a man \"learned in the law\", and for this reason he was appointed Lord Chancellor of Ireland, serving from 1292–1294, and he held that office again from 1306–1308. He was Canon of Emly and prebendary of Mollagymon, Cashel, County Tipperary. He was elected Bishop of Emly in 1306, and installed as bishop in a ceremony at Christchurch Cathedral, Dublin, which was followed by a banquet at which he feasted first the nobility, and then the citizenry of Dublin with a magnificence \"unheard of in those times\".  In 1307 he was granted a third part of the manor of Ballyfermot by William Fitzwilliam and his wife Avice, of the family which in time would come to own most of Dublin south of the River Liffey. He is also known to have acquired lands at Chapelizod. He died on 4 February 1309. O'Flanagan states that from the little that is known of him he seems to have been popular and hospitable. According to Smyth, during his tenure as Lord Chancellor a serious fire destroyed all the Irish Chancery records; this is probably a reference to the Great Fire of Dublin of 1304, which destroyed much of the medieval city."

He is a senior economist at the W.E. Upjohn Institute for Employment Research in Kalamazoo, Michigan. He developed a method of isolating local labor demand changes that is referred to as the Bartik Instrument. This measure averages national employment growth across industries using local industry employment shares as weights to produce a measure of local labor demand that is unrelated to changes in local labor supply. See Bartik (1991). Bartik earned a B.A. degree from Yale University (magna cum laude) in 1975 and M.S. and Ph.D. degrees from the University of Wisconsin-Madison in 1982. Prior to joining the Upjohn Institute in 1989, Bartik was assistant professor of economics at Vanderbilt University (1982–1989), and legislative assistant for housing and urban policy for U.S. Senator Donald W. Riegle Jr. (1975–1978)."

He is considered one of the foremost 15th-century illuminators of the Ferrara school, and also has the distinction of being the probable engraver of the first book illustrated with maps, which was also the first book using engraving. His most prestigious commission was a lavishly illustrated two-volume Bible produced between 1455 and 1461 for Ferrara's ruler, Duke Borso d'Este. Other surviving works he took charge of in Ferrara include an illuminated copy of Boccaccio’s Decameron and a luxurious book of hours known as the Gualenghi-d'Este Hours. After Borso's death in 1471 he moved to Bologna, where payments for his work declined. Despite the lavish works he supervised during his career he sometimes pawned parts of manuscripts he was supposed to illuminate, suggesting his finances were far from stable. His last recorded work dates from 1476."

  "text" : "Thomas Tunnecliffe (13 July 1869 – 2 February 1948) was an Australian politician. He was a member of the Victorian Legislative Assembly, representing the districts of West Melbourne (1903–1904), Eaglehawk (1907–1920) and Collingwood (1921–1947) for the Australian Labor Party. In February 1932 Edmond Hogan, the Premier of Victoria and leader of the Labor Party, travelled to London to talk to the banks about Victoria's desperate economic plight during the Great Depression. While he was away Tunnecliffe was acting Premier, and he was much more willing than Hogan to reject the Premiers' Plan. As a result, the Country Party withdrew its support from Hogan's minority government, and in April the government was defeated in a confidence vote. Tunnecliffe, as acting leader, led the Labor campaign in the May 1932 state election, now completely rejecting the Premiers's Plan, which was the main issue at the election. The Labor Party Executive expelled everyone who had supported the Premier's Plan, including Hogan, although it did not run a candidate against him. Tunnecliffe was elected leader of the party. At the elections the United Australia Party won 31 seats to Labor's 16 and the reunited Country Party's 14. Hogan and one of his ex-ministers were elected as \"Premiers' Plan Labor\" candidates. The UAP's Stanley Argyle became Premier of Victoria, and Tunnecliffe was Opposition leader until the 1935 state election, when Labor won only 17 seats and finished with-third party status, thereby not even qualifying as the official Opposition. (Due to the weighting of country votes, at the 1935 election the United Country Party polled only 13.7% of the popular vote and won 20 seats, whereas Labor's 37.9% only garnered it 17 seats.) Tunnecliffe was a close friend of the gambling boss John Wren, (in the view of most historians, Tunnecliffe was, in fact, under Wren's control) who was also very close to United Country Party leader Albert Dunstan. Due to Wren's influence, Labor supported Dunstan's minority government from 1935 onwards. Following the 1937 state election, Tunnecliffe was succeeded as leader of the Labor Party in Victoria by John Cain, Snr. Tunnecliffe was Speaker of the Victorian Legislative Assembly from 1937 to 1940, and continued as the member for Collingwood until August 1947, when he resigned due to ill-health. Labor's support for Dunstan continued until 1943."

  "text" : "(This article contains a patronymic name. This person is addressed by their given name, Abél, and not as Makkonen.) Abél Makkonen Tesfaye (born 16 February 1990), better known by his stage name The Weeknd (pronounced \"the weekend\"), is a Canadian singer, songwriter and record producer. In late 2010, Tesfaye anonymously uploaded several songs to YouTube under the name \"The Weeknd\". He released three nine-track mixtapes throughout 2011: House of Balloons, Thursday, and Echoes of Silence, which were critically acclaimed. The following year, he released a compilation album Trilogy, thirty tracks consisting of the remastered mixtapes and three additional songs. It was released under Republic Records and his own label XO. In 2013, he released his debut studio album Kiss Land, which was supported by the singles \"Kiss Land\" and \"Live For\". His second album, Beauty Behind the Madness, which became his first number one album on the Billboard 200, included the top-five single \"Earned It\" and produced the number-one singles \"The Hills\" and \"Can't Feel My Face\". The songs have simultaneously held the top three spots on the Billboard Hot R&B Songs chart, making him the first artist in history to achieve this. The Weeknd has won two Grammy Awards and has been nominated for an Academy Award. In September 2016, the release of the third album, Starboy was announced, along with the release of the tracks \"Starboy\" and \"False Alarm\"."

Whidden, who began sailing at age ten at the Cedar Point Yacht Club in Westport, Connecticut, is one of the most experienced America's Cup sailors in the world. \"When I was 16 my dream was to become a sailmaker and race in the America's Cup,\" said Whidden of his years as a junior sailor on Long Island Sound. He has sailed with Dennis Conner in a total of eight America's Cup campaigns, beginning in 1979 as Conner's trial horse skipper. He has raced as tactician in five America's Cup series races and has won the America's Cup three times (1980, 1987 and 1988.) Along with Conner, Whidden was given a key to New York City from Mayor Ed Koch in 1987 after bringing the America's Cup back to the United States from Australia. Whidden was inducted into the America's Cup Hall of Fame in 2004. Outside the America's Cup arena, Whidden has won the Newport-Bermuda Race (Class A) five times and has won his class at Miami SORC five times and twice overall. He is the publisher and co-author of two books: The Art & Science of Sails and Championship Tactics. In 2005, he was featured in an article titled CEO Sailing on Forbes.com.

  "text" : "Thomas Chase (died 1449) was a 15th-century judge and cleric who was Chancellor of the University of Oxford, and subsequently held the office of Lord Chancellor of Ireland. Chase was Warden of the Hospital of St Bartholomew near Rye in 1420 and was subsequently attached to the free chapel at Jesmond near Newcastle. In politics he was a supporter of Humprey, the \"Good Duke of Gloucester\", and served as one of his chaplains. He was Chancellor of the University of Oxford from 1426 until 1431, and Lord Chancellor of Ireland from 1441 until 1446. The Crown had originally appointed him as Irish Chancellor in 1432, and he travelled to Ireland to take up office, but Richard Talbot, Archbishop of Dublin, the outgoing Chancellor, simply refused to hand over the seal of office. Chase, perhaps intimidated by the Archbishop's formidable personality, seems to have meekly returned to England, until such time as Archbishop Talbot was willing to surrender his office, as he duly did in 1441. Due to the more than usually turbulent conditions in Ireland, which was wracked by the feud between the Butler and Talbot factions, Chase when he eventually took up office was urged not to leave the country unless strictly necessary and to hurry back as soon as possible. Although he was described as a man of great learning, Chase, unlike most holders of high office at the time, never became a bishop, and spent his last years as parson of High Ongar in Essex, where he died in 1449. As Lord Chancellor he is mainly remembered for his petition to the Privy Council that Irish law students seeking admission to the Inns of Court in London should receive equal treatment with their English colleagues, to which the Council returned a favourable response. St.Mary, High Ongar"

  "text" : "Thomas Stewart, 2nd Earl of Angus (b.b.1331-1361) was a medieval Scottish nobleman. He was the son of John Stewart of Bonkyll and Margaret de Abernethy. Stewart was an infant when his father died and inherited his estates and titles in Berwickshire, Abernethy and Angus. In 1353 he married Margaret Sinclair, a daughter of William de St Clair of Rosslyn. (St Clair was slain in 1330, along with Sir James Douglas, at the Battle of Teba whilst accompanying King Robert's Heart to the Holy Land.) The petition for this marriage was sent to the Holy See, with support from John II of France, which would suggest that the young Angus spent time at the French court. Present at the siege of Berwick in 1355, Angus was one of the lords that negotiated the release of David II following his 10-year captivity following the Battle of Neville's Cross. At some point in the late 1350s, Stewart was made Great Chamberlain of Scotland, an office he lost at some point before 1359, when Walter de Biggar was in office. Angus was considered one of the conspirators in the murder of King David's mistress, Catherine Mortimer, at Soutra in 1360, and was duly imprisoned. Whilst being held at Dumbarton Castle, he succumbed to Bubonic plague in 1361."

  "text" : "Born Maurice Hawkins, Third Hawkins is a recognized music producer in and out of the DMV area including his hometown of Baltimore, Maryland. He has been producing music for over 10 years and was formally in the r&b group JONDOE. His group was signed to a demo deal with Universal Music Group during the late 90's but an album never formed. After performing on the Apollo Theater the group decided to disband and Third Hawkins began his production career. Buying music equipment piece by piece he started working with local artist including a young group which he helped formed. After working with several local artist Third began writing for different singers and became one of Baltimore and Dc's most unknown talent. He started Ghostwriting for artist because he did not want the notoriety that comes with fame. QUOTE: “My goal is to become the best multi-genre African American male author of the future.” Third Hawkins hits the scene with the pure gifted talent of story telling in a way that captivates each reader as if they were a part of the story twisting Urban Literature writing in a way that has never been done. . QUOTE: “I have done so many things in my life that has made me become the man I am today. Some good and some bad but none of them do I regret.” Third Hawkins began his journey in the music business in an R&B group called JONDOE of which they were signed to a major record label but never produced a full album. It was then when he focused his talent for writing songs and developing them into musical love stories that he began his curiosity for the literary arts. Although writing is what he loved to do music was always his passion. Producing tracks for local and other music artist. Performing at the legendary Apollo theater and other venues are what inspired him to become a better artist. Between work and relationships the music in his life dwindled and the love he once had left after years of R&B changed in the musical domain. He began to write short stories just for fun and one day while on the subway train. Using nothing but his data phone began texting his first book, “My Only Syn\". After writing the book and seeing how new found friends that were writers were screwed over by several publishing companies Third started his own publishing company, 3rdHawkins Publishing and began to write the self acclaimed drama \"Wake Me When It's Over\" based on the life of a strong man trying to survive living with depression. “I look at urban novels as the future of literary art because of the fact that it's as real as you can get in telling a story. Hip Hop was once looked at as a genre in music that would never last and now the stories that they tell have influenced all genres of music from rock to country. Every one has some sort of story to tell and some stories may help even if it’s just one person who will read my book and can relate: I am satisfied and feel I have done my job as an author.\""

  "text" : "Thomas Todd (c.1832 - 1908) was a noted player of the Northumbrian smallpipes, considered by William Cocks to be 'of highest rank'. One account, from 1890, states that he learned the pipes from Thomas Hair, a blind piper and fiddler of Bedlington, who also taught Todd's contemporary, Old Tom Clough.A photograph of him is in the Cocks Collection, and is visible at It is known that Todd taught the pipers Tom Clough and Richard Mowat to play, as well as Mary Anderson, known as 'Piper Mary'. W. A. Cocks later noted that she was herself 'well known in her day as a piper of the first order'. Todd can be tracked throughout his life through census records. He seems to be the same as the Thomas Todd who appears in 1841 in Longframlington, apparently aged 7; later census appearances are largely consistent with this, but with his being born in 1832, and there is a record of a Thomas Todd being baptised in Longframlington in 1832; later appearances show that he was a miner, living in pit villages in the Bedlington area, first Nedderton (sometimes called Netherton), later Bedlington itself, then Choppington Station, Northumberland. A vivid contemporary picture of the Choppington area is found at . William Cocks noted that he was a favourite piper of Dr J. Collingwood Bruce, one of the editors of The Northumbrian Minstrelsy, and that he played at Bruce’s lectures. He also played at the Crystal Palace, in London, and, late in his life, at the Riding of the Bounds, in Morpeth, in 1889; two photographs, one taken on this occasion, are in the Cocks Collection, and may be viewed at the FARNE website,. On several occasions, Todd is recorded as having played at benefit concerts; one, in Blyth, was for the widow of Mr. William Beadon, a fellow miner who had \"distinguished himself at the Hartley Calamity in trying to rescue the miners\", one, in Sleekburn, was for the Teachers' Orphan and Orphanage Fund, and another in Cambois, for the widow and family of another miner, Mr. Forster. From these and other reports, as well as competition records, we see that Todd's repertoire included Northumbrian pipe variation sets, such as I saw my love come passing by me, Wylam Away, New Highland Laddie, The Keel Row, Meggy's Foot, Monymusk and Felton Lonnen, as well as other pieces such as Caller Herrin, Auld Lang Syne, Last Rose of Summer, Carnival of Venice, and an aria, Sweet Spirit, Hear my Prayer, from the opera Lurline. He entered the competitions organised by the Newcastle Society of Antiquaries from 1877 onwards, which were won for three years by 'Old' Thomas Clough (II), the father of Henry Clough - Todd was placed second in 1877 and the next two years. He was later a judge at the Northumbrian Smallpipes Society's Third Annual Contest, 1896, sitting with G H Thompson and Charles F Bowes. He also composed - The Barrington Hornpipe, which requires fluent use of every key on a 7-keyed chanter, is his, and remains popular today. It is unusual for pipe tunes in G to require all seven keys, including c sharp and d sharp, so it may well have been composed as a test piece.Forster Charlton, who knew Tom Clough, wrote that when learning from Todd, Tom had the ambition to play The Barrington Hornpipe, but at first was forbidden to try it, instead being given exercises to practice on. After mastering these, he was allowed to tackle the hornpipe, and found \"he could play'd straight away\".In Tom Clough's manuscripts, the setting of The Suttors of Selkirk is described as the \"favourite tune of Thomas Todd\".Clough also attributed last two the triplet variations on \"Corn Rigs\" to Todd, but this must be an error on Clough's part, for they are found in the early 19th century John Hall manuscript ; however this attribution, from Todd's pupil, does suggest that Todd knew and played these variations. A setting in E minor of the jig The Laird of Cockpen, suitable for smallpipes, is believed to be by Todd. He lived in or near Choppington for most of his adult life, but a few months before his death, he moved to live with his son-in-law at Bedlington. He died in July 1908 aged about 76, and is buried at Choppington. His obituary said \"His execution was remarkable, but he excelled more in the quality and sweetness with which he embellished the old and now nearly forgotten Northumbrian and Scottish airs\". It also states that 'considerably over 50 years ago', he was host of the Shakespeare Tavern in Guide Post, Choppington, where he was certainly living in 1862. As the tavern was sold by auction in March 1860, and again had a different landlord by 1867, it seems he did not make a success of the business. The article continues that \"many came long distances to hear him play\", and \"he played all over Northumberland and in many parts of Durham\". One story told by Todd, and recorded in the obituary, and by Cocks, tells that 'Todd once was to play a concert at Allendale and lost his way on the fells. He played his pipes “for company”, was heard by a shepherd and rescued.' His pipes, a fine silver-mounted set in ivory, are in the Cocks Collection, and may also be seen at the Woodhorn museum website,."

Under the direction of Goodspeed and University of California landscape architect, John William Gregg, the garden was moved from its location on the central campus to its current site in Strawberry Canyon in the hills above the campus. As director of the UCBG, Goodspeed led several plant hunting expeditions to the Andes of Colombia, Peru, Chile, Argentina, and Uruguay. He obtained a substantial collection of Nicotiana during these expeditions, which were then assembled at the Botanical Garden for further study. His study lead to increased understanding of the origins and diversity of tobacco species. The collection was later used to reintroduce wild disease resistance traits into domesticated species. During World War I Goodspeed, along with desert rubber expert and fellow Berkeley botanist, Harvey Monroe Hall, worked for the United States' Western strategic plants surveys for native sources of rubber. His positive relations with South American countries lead to him being asked to help maintain relations with these countries during World War II. He spent some time in Chile helping to design the Chilean Botanical Garden. The Australian tobacco species Nicotiana goodspeedii H.-M. Wheeler is named after Goodspeed."

He was the Editor-in-Chief of The Journal of Cell Biology and is the current editor of Current Opinion in Cell Biology. Tom Misteli is best known for his work on elucidation of how genomes function in living cells. While a post-doc at the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, New York, United States, he developed methods to visualize proteins in the nucleus of living mammalian cells allowing for the first time to study gene expression in intact cells. His more recent work focuses on the role of genome organization and nuclear architecture on differentiation and disease. His cell biological elucidation of the mechanisms involved in the pre-mature aging disease Hutchinson–Gilford progeria syndrome have revealed novel mechanisms of human aging. For his work he has won numerous awards including the Flemming Award and the Feulgen Prize."

  "text" : "Tom Jones (1 September 1822 – 1916) was a British trade unionist. Born in Ledbury, Herefordshire, he worked in his father's tin plate business, before moving to London in 1839, where he joined the Operative Tin Plate Workers Society. In 1859, he acted in support of the London builders' strike, the movement which produced the London Trades Council, and Jones was elected as its first secretary, serving only one year. In the same year, he was elected as Secretary of the Tin Plate Workers, while, in 1861, he published the first national trade union directory, and helped launch the trade union journal, The Bee-Hive. Jones was also known for his tall silk hats, always worn at an unusual angle. After standing down from his trade union posts in 1865, he became a foreman at R. W. Wilson, but he remained a union member and received a pension from them from 1892. He retired to Ledbury, where he lived to the age of ninety-four."

Owen was the son of Edward Owen of Shrewsbury, and entered Shrewsbury School in 1589. He became town clerk of Shrewsbury in or before January 1610. In 1624, Owen was elected Member of Parliament for Shrewsbury. He was re-elected in 1625 1626 and 1628 and sat until 1629 when King Charles I decided to rule without parliament for eleven years. In April 1640, Owen was re-elected MP for Shrewsbury in the Short Parliament. He followed the royalist side in the Civil Wars, although he acted as a witness against Archbishop Laud. He acted as deputy to Sir Thomas Gardiner, Recorder of London, during the reign of Charles I and after Gardiner's death the King had given him an order for a grant of the office of Prothonotary of South Wales . The grant was never executed, and the order itself was destroyed by a fire in the lodgings of Sir Edward Herbert, the Attorney-General. He remained as town clerk until 1645, when the parliamentary forces captured the town. He was taken prisoner and dismissed from his position as town clerk as a delinquent on 17 November. After the Restoration, Owen petitioned the King to grant him the office of Prothonotary of South Wales. He also petitioned to be restored to his post as town clerk. However the matter was referred to Lord Carberry who ruled in favour of a rival claimant. Owen died in May 1661 and was buried at the old St Chad's Church, Shrewsbury, on 25 May."

  "text" : "Theodore Ritch (1894 in Odessa – 1943) was a Russian tenor. During the 1920s he was tenor of the Chicago Opera. In Chicago in 1929-30 he sang Leopold in La Juive with Rosa Raisa, Charles Marshall, and Alexander Kipnis. He also sang the King of the Fools in Louise with Mary Garden, Rene Maison, Maria Claessens, and Vanni Marcoux. The following season (1930–31) he sang Ramon in La Navarraise, Gaston in Camille by Hamilton Forrest with Garden and Charles Hackett, and also Cassio in Otello with Marshall, Claudia Muzio, and Vanni-Marcoux. Recordings exist of arias from Tosca and Manon. He retired in Paris, where he appears to have evaded the rafle du Vél' d'hiv in July 1942, but was arrested in 1943 and sent to Drancy. He died on a train headed for a concentration camp, presumably Auschwitz, in Poland."

  "text" : "Thomas Burr Osborne (August 5, 1859 – January 29, 1929) was a biochemist and early discoverer of Vitamin A. He is known for his work isolating and characterizing seed proteins, and for determining protein nutritional requirements. His career was spent at the Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station. Thomas was the son of lawyer Arthur Dimon Osborne and the grandson of US Representative Thomas Burr Osborne. His life exhibited \"a single purpose, the understanding of the relationships of proteins to each other and the animal world. He began his researches upon vegetable proteins in 1888,...\" He published his findings in The Vegetable Proteins in 1909. Osborne wrote over 100 papers with longtime collaborator Lafayette Mendel. Both were appointees of the Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station. In their early work, they studied the deadly poison ricin which is classified as a type 2 ribosome inactivating protein (RIP) from castor beans. In 1909, Osborne and Mendel's work found what amino acids are necessary for the survival of the laboratory rat. At the Connecticut experimental station they developed a lab with about 200 rats whose dietary intake was carefully controlled. Their carefully controlled studies on rats revealed the necessary elements in a healthy diet. The program was described by J.R. Lindsey and H.J. Baker: The striking differences in amino acid composition of plant proteins, which had been documented by Osborne, suggested that possible differences might exist in their biological value. The nutritive values of various purified proteins from cereal grains and other plant sources were compared for growth and maintenance in rats. This led to supplementation of \"incomplete proteins\" with those amino acids limiting each foodstuff’s \"biological quality\" (eg. Tryptophan and lysine). Casein was found to be a \"complete protein\", thus paving the way for the use of this protein in modern rat diets. Within a few years it was possible to list the \"essential\" and \"nonessential\" amino acids. The science of nutrition thus evolved beyond the caloric energy of food, turning to the structural issue of essential amino acids. Vitamin A discovery Osborne and Mendel discovered Vitamin A in 1913 in butter fat – independently discovered by Elmer McCollum and Marguerite Davis, who submitted their publication first, with both papers appearing in the same issue of the Journal of Biological Chemistry – as well as water-soluble vitamin B in milk. Osborne and Mendel showed, for example, that a lack of Vitamin A in the diet led to xerophthalmia. They also established the importance of lysine and tryptophan in a healthy diet."

She is the chairperson of the For the Poor party, a member of the council of the city of Espoo, the ambassador for human rights and children's rights in the Finnish United Nations alliance, and a lecturer in the Finnish Refugee Help Association. In the early 1990s, Savola belonged to the council of the Christian Democratic Party and was the chairperson of the party's women association. In November 1995, Savola attended the founding conference of the True Finns party, where she was elected as the party's deputy chairperson. Savola only resigned from the Christian Democratic Party after her election as deputy chairman of the True Finns. In the June 1997 party conference Savola lost her place as deputy chairperson. She still remained a member of the party council. In early 1998, Savola resigned from the True Finns and joined the Remonttiryhmä (\"Renovation Group\") party. In October 1998 Savola was elected to lead the party's women association Naisremmi (\"Band of women\"). Savola was fired from the Remonttiryhmä party in spring 1999, when she accused the party chairman Risto Kuisma of being too authoritative. Savola was elected to the city council of Espoo in the 2008 municipal elections and the party For the Poor received its first council seat in its entire history. The cause for this was an electoral alliance with the True Finns. Timo Soini's huge popularity also brought Savola, who had received 176 votes, to the city council. Savola was a candidate for the European Parliament in 1996 (839 votes), in 2004 (1352 votes) and in 2009 (385 votes) In the 1994 presidential election, Savola supported Elisabeth Rehn of the Swedish People's Party of Finland, and in the Finnish presidential election, 2006 she supported Sauli Niinistö of the National Coalition Party. Savola is the editor of the Plari newspaper published by the Southern Ostrobothnians in Helsinki. She is also a former model."

  "text" : "Timmy O'Neill (born 1969) is an American professional rock climber, guide, and comedian. He is nicknamed the \"Urban Ape\". O'Neill is originally from East Lansdowne, Pennsylvania, one of seven children. After whitewater kayaking as a child, he began climbing as a teenager, scaling the cables of the Brooklyn Bridge and climbing in Yellowstone. He left Temple University after one semester and worked at the Old Faithful Gift Shop in Yellowstone, and in Yosemite. He has lived in Boulder, Colorado since 2000. He climbs buildings, including the Chicago Tribune Tower, without ropes. In 2001, along with Dean Potter, O'Neill set the-then speed record for the \"Nose\" climb on El Capitan in Yosemite National Park, climbing it in three hours and twenty-four minutes. O'Neill has been featured in several climbing films including Return2Sender, Front Range Freaks, and most recently 180 Degrees South. He also produced \"Return2Sender\", which won Best Climbing Film from the Alpine Club of Canada. He narrated and co-wrote the non-fiction comedy \"Across the Atlas\", about an adventure in Morocco that turned out to be less epic than the participants hoped. One of his comedy personas is \"Dr Steven \"Death Zone\" Clark\", in his \"Mallory Revisited\" play. With Dennis “DJ” Skelton he co-founded a non-profit organization for disabled outdoor sport athletes, Paradox Sports, in 2007. His brother Sean broke his back jumping off a bridge into the Mississippi River and is still a climber. Paradox Sports is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization that improves people's lives by creating an adaptive sport community built to inspire. Currently, O'Neill is the executive director of Paradox Sports"

Von der Dunk was raised in Bilthoven, and from 1979 to 1988 studied art history at the University of Amsterdam. He was a doctoral candidate in the history department at Leiden University (1989–1993), and received his Ph.D. in 1994, having written a dissertation on the political and ideological characteristics of the cult of monuments in the Holy Roman Empire between the fourteenth and the eighteenth century. He worked at Utrecht University from 1994 to 1999, and from 1999 to 2002 again in Leiden. Since 2002 he has been working as a freelance writer and pundit. From 2010 to 2011 he wrote a regular column for HP/De Tijd, but was fired in March 2011, and is now an online columnist for de Volkskrant and a columnist for the regional paper De Gelderlander. In April 2011, Von der Dunk was to give the annual Willem Arondéus lecture, organized by the States-Provincial of North-Holland. Politicians from the PVV, CDA, and VVD prevented this, claiming that his lecture was too partisan. However, VVD and CDA later decided to let Von der Dunk give his lecture anyway."

  "text" : "Terence Wilmot Hutchison FBA (August 13, 1912 – October 6, 2007) was a world-famous economist. Born in Bournemouth, England, he attended Peterhouse, Cambridge in 1931 to study the classics but switched to economics. He took his bachelor of arts degree, with first class honours, in 1934. Subsequently, he spent a year at the London School of Economics (LSE), then became a lecturer in economics in Bonn, Germany in 1935, due to an interest in Ludwig Wittgenstein. He spent approximately three years in Bonn, learning the German language while researching German studies in economics. The son of Robert Langton Douglas, he was a half-brother to Marshal of the Royal Air Force William Sholto Douglas, 1st Baron Douglas of Kirtleside. He married the German national Loretta Hack. The couple moved to Baghdad, where he took a position at a teacher training college. Eventually, they moved to Bombay. During World War II, he joined the British military, serving as an intelligence officer on the Northwest Frontier, in Egypt, and then in Delhi. In 1946, he began his British university career with a position at the University of Hull. After a year at Hull, he moved to the LSE, where he became interested in the history of economics. The University of Birmingham named him Mitsui Professor of Economics in 1956, holding that position he held until he retired in 1978. He continued to teach the history of economics for another two years. After retiring, Hutchison published the book Before Adam Smith in 1988, the first book in English to systematically analyze 18th Century economic writing before the publication of Adam Smith's seminal work The Wealth of Nations (1776). His wife Loretta died in 1981. In 1983, he married Christine Donaldson, who died in 2003. He had three children. Hutcheson's much-cited 1938 treatise The Significance and Basic Postulates of Economic Theory established his credentials as an economic methodologist."

  "text" : "Sir Thomas Finch (died 1563), was an English military commander. Finch was the second son of Sir William Finch, who was knighted for his services at the siege of Therouanne in 1513, and attended Henry VIII with a great retinue in 1520. His mother, his father's first wife, was Elizabeth, daughter of Sir James Cromer of Tunstall, Kent, and widow of Sir Richard Lovelace. An elder brother, Lawrence, died without issue, and Thomas succeeded to his father's property. He was trained as a soldier, and in 1553 was engaged in suppressing Wyatt's rebellion in Kent. On the day after Mary's coronation (2 October 1553) he was knighted. Soon after Elizabeth's accession (1559), Nicholas Harpsfeld, archdeacon of Canterbury, threatened violent resistance to the new ecclesiastical legislation, and Finch was despatched to Canterbury to disarm his household. Early in 1563 he was appointed, in succession to Sir Adrian Poynings, knight-marshal of the army then engaged in war about Le Havre. He at once sent his half-brother, Sir Erasmus Finch, to take temporary charge, and his kinsman Thomas Finch to act as provost-marshal. He himself embarked in the Greyhound in March with two hundred followers, among them James and John Wentworth, brothers of Lord Wentworth, another brother of his own, a brother of Lord Cobham, and a nephew of Ambrose Dudley, earl of Warwick. When nearing Havre the ship was driven back by contrary winds towards Rye. Finch and his friends induced the captain - 'a very good seaman,' says Stow - 'to thrust into the haven before the tide,' and 'so they all perished' with the exception of 'seven of the meaner sort' (19 March). The news reached the court two days later, and produced great consternation. A ballad commemorating the misfortune was licensed to Richard Griffith at the time. Finch was buried at Eastwell, Kent."

Many of his earlier four paneled works contain elements of political satire and those which are purely comical such as his well known work, The Drunken Swordsman (大醉俠).

  "text" : "Thomas Spencer (10 June 1850 – 28 November 1933) played first-class cricket for Somerset in three matches between 1891 and 1893. His birthplace is not known, and he died at Bishopsteignton, Devon. Spencer's batting and bowling styles are not known and in his three first-class matches, one in 1891 and two in 1893, and all played when he was more than 40 years old, he batted as a tail-ender and did not bowl. His highest first-class score was 14, made in his first match, against Yorkshire, for whom George Hirst was also making his debut. Spencer had, however, played as a middle-order batsman and as an occasional bowler in other matches for Somerset during the period up to 1891 when the team's matches were not deemed first-class. Spencer's role within Somerset County Cricket Club was wider than just as a player: a history of the club indicates that at the time of the restoration of Somerset to first-class status, Spencer was helping the club secretary, H. E. Murray-Anderdon, with the administration duties, a task he handed over when Sammy Woods was recruited as an \"amateur\" player in need of financial assistance in 1893. Another history refers to him as the \"diffident and effective joint secretary\" alongside Murray-Anderdon. As a Somerset official, he attended the meeting of the County Cricket Council in December 1890 with Somerset captain Herbie Hewett at which the council unexpectedly voted to abolish itself, opening the way for the first-class counties to increase their number by arranging fixtures between themselves, with Somerset as the first beneficiary of this loosening of the rules."

He returned to Britain in 1958, but came back in 1960, to his old job at the soon to be renamed Lincoln College, New Zealand.

  "text" : "Timo Laaninen is the party secretary of the Centre Party in Finland since 12 June 2010. Laaninen has been the editor-in-chief of Suomenmaa party newspaper from January 2008. Before that he has been a political secretary (special adviser) in Esko Aho's cabinet to the minister of internal affairs, Mauri Pekkarinen, minister for foreign affairs Heikki Haavisto and prime minister Esko Aho. In Anneli Jäätteenmäki's cabinet he was a political secretary for prime minister Anneli Jäätteenmäki and later also for Matti Vanhanen in Matti Vanhanen's cabinet. Laaninen supported Matti Vanhanen's presidential campaign by writing an electoral campaign book Se on ihan Matti! (It is really Matti!, the proverb Olen ihan Matti means I am really sure of it), which was published 23 October 2005. During the juridical process Antti-Pekka Pietilä claimed, that Timo Laaninen had said, that the political secretaries of the Centre Party in Finland will take care of the fact that the editor-in-chief of Ilta-Sanomat, a Sanoma company will have to resign. Timo Laaninen denied this on his behalf on 4 December 2006. Laaninen had said, that there is a half-criminal part in the Centre Party in Finland, which \"collects money from here and there and manipulates the construction permission plans\" (Keskustassa on puolirikollinen osa, joka kähmii vaalirahoja sieltä sun täältä ja suhmuroi vaalirahoja). Laaninen described the elections in 2011 as historical, as there are big issues to solve. Väestö ikääntyy, työssäkäyvien määrä suhteessa pienenee ja takana on finanssikriisi, jonka seurauksena valtiot ovat velkaantuneet aika pahasti. Kyllä tässä on isot asiat käsillä. (The population grows older, the relative proportion of the working people diminishes and there is a financial crisis behind, which had led to the badly debt-driven states. There are big issues within the reach of hands.) On Mayday 2011 Laaninen delivered a Mayday political speech near Kyösti Kallio's statue criticizing Teuvo Hakkarainen. He joined the critics and said in typical Mayday political speech near Kyösti Kallio's statue in Helsinki, that Neekeriukko (Negro old man) was the worst insult. He also added, that he wonders, how is it possible, that Hakkarainen can apologise his sayings by claiming, that he comes from countryside. \"Pahempaa loukkausta maalaisille ja maalla syntyneille on vaikea keksiä\" (It is difficult to find a worse insult concerning the rural people and people, who have been born in the countryside). He also commented Hakkarainen's statements, that they are an \"all time low\" comment in the immigration debate. Laaninen has become a baccalaureat in 1973 and master of science in administrative sciences in 1983."

  "text" : "Thomas Betagh (1737 – 16 February 1811) was an Irish Catholic priest, schoolteacher, and professor of languages at Pont-à-Mousson seminary. Betagh was born in Kells, County Meath. He was educated abroad and resided at Paris and Metz as a professor before returning to Ireland in 1769. In 1773, shortly after he became a priest, the Jesuits was suppressed by pope Clement XIV, so Betagh had to resign from the order. The order was restored only six months after his death. In Dublin he worked with fathers John Austin S.J. (1717–1784), Mulcaile, and Fullham in the old chapel at Rosemary Lane. With them for years he assisted the secular clergy, and acted as curate, and succeeded the Rev. Field as parish priest of Ss. Michael and John's, and Vicar-General of the diocese. The parish was located in one of the poorest areas of Dublin. Betagh established free schools in Schoolhouse Lane, off Cook Street, then in Skinner's Row, and finally in Smock Alley, catering for about 330 boys. Amongst his pupils were the future Archbishop of Dublin Daniel Murray, and the founder of Clongowes Wood Fr. Peter Kenney SJ one of the leading jesuits who reestablished the order in Ireland, whose studies he sponsored. Until just before his death he taught each evening at these schools and provided clothing for the most destitute of the pupils, where a total of over three thousand boys had been educated. The schools were afterwards known as the Dr Betagh Schools. The chapel in Rosemary Lane was in a ruinous state, but before Betagh died the foundation-stone of the new Church of SS. Michael and John in Exchange Street was laid, which was partially opened on Christmas Day, 1813. He died at his residence, 80 Cook Street. His funeral was attended by over 20,000 persons. His remains were interred in the Jesuits' vaults in Old St. Michan's, Church Street. About 1822 they were removed to the vault of his own church, SS. Michael and John, under the High Altar, where a monument to his memory was also erected. This was sculpted by his one time student (who had subsequently turned to sculpture), Peter Turnerelli. In 1990 his remains were moved to Glasnevin Cemetery."

  "text" : "Theodore Papakonstantinou (1949–1970) was a composer and psaltis from Cyprus, who performed an attempt of innovative, and in some respects ground-breaking harmonization (polyphonic adaptation for a 4-parts choir) of the traditional Byzantine chant. His life was cut short, as he was killed during the Cyprus conflict, and the only adaptation he managed to publish was that of the Liturgy of St John Chrysostom. He did however publish the theoretical work, outlining the basic principles of his adaptation. The key idea of his approach was in following the innate attractions of the Byzantine modes, and not the formal classical rules of Western European music harmony, thus to \"preserve the imposing character of traditionally monophonic Byzantine chant, whilestriving to avoid superficial parallels with Western music.\" In his efforts, Theodore Papakonstantinou started from the most simple modes of the Byzantine system (First Mode and the Plagal First Mode), and his system can not be automatically generalized to more complex modes, such as the Fourth Mode, or the Soft Chromatic mode. Five of his compositions (Psalm 136, Doxastikon of Pascha, We praise thee, It is truly meet, and the Cherubic Hymn) were adapted into English and recorded in the 1986 cassette tape \"Byzantine Music in the New World.\" by Vassilis Hadjinicolaou, a Greek chanterfrom Montreal, Canada. His music are performed by other experimental choirs as well."

He became a freeman of East Greenwich in 1690, aged about 24, and began a long career of civil service in 1696 when he became a deputy, serving in that role during most years over a period of three and a half decades. From 1698 to 1704 he was Justice of the Peace, he later served as Clerk of the Assembly for several years, and he was Speaker of the House of Deputies for ten years between 1713 and 1730. In 1707 he was appointed one of the commissioners to settle with Massachusetts the northern boundary of Rhode Island, and two years later he was appointed to a committee to run lines between the two colonies. In 1715, he and Andrew Harris were appointed by the Assembly to transcribe and to prepare for the press all the laws of the colony, and in 1719 he was allowed ten pounds for his efforts to get the laws printed. In 1727 he was selected to complete the term as Deputy Governor of Jonathan Nichols who had died in office. He served under Joseph Jenckes who had just taken office the same year, and then was selected for the same position in 1728 for another year. He died in 1748, leaving a very large estate valued at more than 22,000 pounds, which included black slaves that were conveyed in his will to his unmarried daughters. His wife was Welthian Greene, daughter of Thomas and Elizabeth (Barton) Greene, niece of Deputy Governor John Greene, Jr., and granddaughter of John Greene who was a co-founder of the town of Warwick, Rhode Island."

Hawkins graduated in 1950 from the University of Washington with a degree in English. He married Kathleen Marie Gallaner and worked for Boeing (as did Pynchon) in the early fifties, then in Beaumont, Texas in television, for station KFDM, and in advertising. In 1960, Hawkins moved to San Francisco to join the Beats, supporting himself as a postal worker. After his work was rejected by local Beat publications, he took to self-publishing under the name \"Tiger Tim\" Hawkins. As a fan of William Gaddis, Hawkins discovered newspaper, the self-published Gaddis fansheet of \"jack green\". He became convinced that green was Gaddis, a detail that would show up in the Tinasky letters. Tinasky also claimed, \"The novels of William Gaddis and Thomas Pynchon were written by the same person\". After Hawkins retired, he and Kathleen moved to Mendocino County just outside Fort Bragg, where they lived in poverty for most of the eighties. Hawkins engaged in petty scams and thefts, and took to disguising himself. Kathleen came into an inheritance and bought a car for herself and a pickup truck for her husband. She also bought a kiln, and began a promising career in pottery."

Her works have won recognition in a range of competitions and exhibitions, including being selected as one of 33 finalists in the Australian Ranamok awards and being selected for participation in the Bombay Sapphire Blue Room exhibition in 2007 and a Matariki-themed exhibition organised by Manukau City Council in 2009. In 2009 she won the Auckland Royal Easter Show art awards in the glass art category with her 'Puawai' piece. She has also contributed to the Project Twin Streams project in Waitakere by producing a major artwork near the pathway at Millbrook Esplanade. She credits her initial interest in glass art to meeting Danny Lane in the UK. When she returned to New Zealand, her interest grew, but with two young children, she was not able to attend a formal multi-year course in glass art at a university, and so became a self-taught glass artist."

  "text" : "Tadeusz Rychter (c. 1873 in Lviv – 1943 in Warsaw) was a Polish early twentieth-century artist best remembered for his watercolors of the Holy Land. Rychter studied at the Jan Matejko Academy of Fine Arts in Kraków, where he became the contributing artist to the legendary Zielony Balonik art-and-literary cabaret. He married a fellow Cracovian artist Bronisława Janowska, but left her for a German artist from an aristocratic family, Anna May-Rychter, whom he met while in Munich. He was Catholic and could not obtain a divorce; they could not be legally wed, which may also explain their decision to settle in Palestine in 1920–1923. While still in Europe, the two worked with Rudolf Steiner on the construction of the first Goetheanum in Switzerland and were members of the artist's group \"Aenigma\". In Palestine, Rychter earned a living restoring art in old churches, and selling watercolor paintings of Christian holy sites to tourists. Many of his surviving paintings are in the possession of British families whose ancestors purchased them while stationed with the British administration in Mandate Palestine. In 1935 Tadeusz Rychter applied for membership in the Palestine Artists' Association but was turned down because of his religion. He returned to Poland at the time of the German invasion in 1939, and disappeared in Warsaw in 1941. He died in 1943, murdered by the Nazis."

  "text" : "Thomas Millington Sir Thomas Millington FRS (1628, Newbury – 5 January 1703/1704, Gosfield), the son of Thomas Millington, was an English physician. Greatly respected in his day, he was eulogised by Samuel Garth under the name of Machaon in his poem 'The Dispensary' while Thomas Sydenham held him in high regard. He received his education at Richard Busby's Westminster School, and then in 1645, at Trinity College, Cambridge under James Duport. From here he graduated AB in 1649, and moved on to Oxford University, obtaining his AM. He was elected a fellow of All Souls College and became a doctor of medicine at Oxford on 9 July 1659. Appointed to the chair of Sedleian Professor of Natural Philosophy in 1675, a position he held for life. Admitted as a candidate for the College of Physicians in 1659, he became a Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians in 1672. He was in turn Censor, Harveian Orator, Treasurer, Consiliarius and President, and was present at the deathbed of Charles II. After his admittance to the College of Physicians, he was said to be 'the delight of it; affable in his conversation, firm in his friendships, diligent and happy in his practice, candid and open in consultations, eloquent to an extraordinary degree in his public speeches; being chosen President, his behaviour was grave, tempered with courtesy, steady without obstinacy, continually intent on the good of the College.' He was appointed physician in ordinary to William III and Mary II, and later to Queen Anne. Millington was knighted in 1679. Millington was one of the physicians to dissect William III’s body. Millington had ventured in a conversation with Nehemiah Grew that the stamen (\"attire\") serves as the male organ for the production of the seed. Grew at once \"replied that he was of the same opinion, gave some reasons for thinking so, and answered some objections which might be made to it.\" Grew further explored this idea and found that stamens with their thecae are male sex organs while pistils represent the female organs. These ideas were published by Grew in the Anatomy of Plants in 1682, which is today regarded as a major milepost in the development of botanical science. In 1691 he was living at Gosfield Hall and was responsible for a great deal of reconstruction. His family Coat of Arms is displayed in the hall and consists of the 'blazon of a silver shield, theron a black eagle displayed with two heads, the crest being a bull's head erased,' and the motto Virtutis proemium honor (\"Honour the reward of virtue\"). He married Hannah King, the widow of Henry King, on 23 February 1680. The union produced a son, Thomas (notorious as a rake), and two daughters, Anne and Mary. According to unsubstantiated family stories, a certain \"Lady Anne\" followed her lover, a British army officer, to America, but eventually married Gershom Lockwood of Greenwich. The story of this woman's aristocratic roots is supported by her receipt of an ornate chest in the 1660s filled with \"half a bushel of guineas and many fine silk dresses\". These sources however fail to substantiate a paternal link between this woman and Sir Thomas. Indeed, Parliamentary probate records successfully demonstrate Anne Millington, daughter of Sir Thomas Millington as having died intestate, unmarried and childless. Thomas Millington was laid to rest on 28 January 1703-4 in the Wentworth Chapel of Gosfield church. A monument of Purbeck marble to his memory was destroyed some sixty years on by looters who tore up the brasswork. There is a good portrait of Millington at the College. Linnaeus named the genus Millingtonia in the Bignoniaceae in his honour."

  "text" : "Tyree Scott (1940–2003) was a labor leader and civil rights activist deeply involved in many minority workers’ and equal opportunity organizations. Scott, an electrician, grew up in Texas, moved to Seattle in 1966 and became a leader in the Central Contractors Association. This organization of minority workers led many peaceful demonstrations against discriminatory hiring practices in Seattle’s construction industry in the summer and fall of 1969. Through the protests, the issue of discriminatory employment was noted by the American Friends Service Committee. After investigating the situation, the American Friends Service Committee approached Scott and the leadership of the Central Contractors Association and proposed a new community-based organization that would organize minority workers to fight discrimination in the unions and in the construction trades. The United Construction Workers Association was founded in 1970 with financial support from the American Friends Service Committee. Tyree Scott was a founding member and worked intensively within the Association, first as a paid staff member and then later as a director. United Construction Workers Association combined community organization, peaceful demonstrations, and legal action to fight workplace discrimination. The Association saw an early victory in the class action suit United States vs. Ironworkers Local 86 et al., in which the United States Department of Justice sued five local unions and apprenticeship and training committees under Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act. In 1970 Judge William J. Lindberg found that there had indeed been racial discrimination in the practices of all institutions named in this case. He ordered wide-ranging relief programs, including quotas for union membership, hiring, and apprenticeship classes and changes in hiring and dispatching procedures. Tyree Scott became less involved in the activities of the United Construction Workers Association in the late seventies, and the organization faded out of existence around 1981. Tyree Scott retired from the electrician’s trade and remained active as a board member for the Labor and Employment Law Office until his death in 2003."

  "text" : "Thomas Flower Ellis (1796 – 5 April 1861) was an English law reporter. Ellis was the son of Thomas Flower Ellis. Born in Walthamstow, he was educated in Hackney and at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he graduated in 1818, and was elected a fellow in 1819. He was a brilliant scholar, though only a senior optime in the mathematical tripos. He became a member of Lincoln's Inn, and was called to the bar in February 1824, and for some years went the northern circuit. Here he first became acquainted with Macaulay, and he remained Macaulay's close friend until his death. So attached were they, that when Macaulay went to India, Ellis wrote to him that, 'next to his wife, he was the person for whom he felt the most thorough attachment, and in whom he placed the most unlimited confidence.' In later life they visited the continent together every autumn, and he was an executor of Macaulay's will. After his friend died the light seemed to have gone out of Ellis's life, but he occupied himself in preparing for publication the posthumous collection of Macaulay's essays, in 1831 he was a commissioner under the Reform Act 1831 to determine the boundaries of parliamentary boroughs in Wales. In early life he enjoyed a considerable practice. He was till his death Attorney-General for the Duchy of Lancaster, and had 'Palatine silk;' and in 1839 he succeeded Armstrong as Recorder of Leeds. He was, about 1830, a contributor to the Edinburgh Review, was a member of the Useful Knowledge Society, and revised several of its publications. He is best known as part author of three excellent series of law reports: Adolphus and Ellis, 1835–42; Ellis and Blackburn, 1853-8 (the co-author was Colin Blackburn the future Law Lord) ; and 'Ellis and Ellis, published after his death. He was a fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society and elected in 1847 a fellow of the Royal Society. He died at his house, 15 Bedford Place, Russell Square, on 5 April 1861. His wife died in March 1839; and he had two children, Francis and Marian. Robert Leslie Ellis was his cousin."

  "text" : "Tom Myers (15 February 1872 – 21 December 1949) was a British Labour Party politician. Born in Mirfield, Myers left school at the age of 12 and spent several years working in coal mines and factories in the West Riding of Yorkshire before taking up employment at a glass bottle works. An early supporter of the Labour Party, he was elected to Thornhill Urban District Council in 1904. In 1910 the urban district was absorbed by the municipal borough of Dewsbury, and Myers became a member of Dewsbury Borough Council. At the 1918 general election Myers contested the constituency of Spen Valley for the Labour Party, but failed to unseat the sitting Coalition Liberal member of parliament, Sir Thomas Whittaker. Whittaker died in November 1919, and Myers was selected to fight the ensuing by election. The by-election came at the same time as a serious split in the Liberal Party over continuing support for the coalition government: Colonel B C Fairfax was nominated as the Coalition Liberal candidate while Sir John Simon stood as an Independent Liberal. The poll was held on 20 December 1919, although the votes were not counted until 3 January of the following year. Myers received 11,962 votes and was elected to the Commons, with a majority of 1,718 over Simon, and the coalition candidate trailing in a poor third place. The result was seen as sensational, with The Times describing it as a \"political event of great significance\" with voters deserting the government candidate in \"a humiliation which cannot be explained away\". The coalition finally fell in 1922, with a general election called for November. Myers defended his seat against Sir John Simon, now the Liberal candidate, and W O R Holton of the Conservative Party. Myers was defeated by Simon. He tried unsuccessfully to regain the seat in 1923 and 1924. He returned to Dewsbury Borough Council in 1935, and was the town's mayor in 1940–1941. He died in Dewsbury in 1949, aged 77."

Educated at Cheltenham School, in 1881 he was commissioned as a lieutenant in the 36th (Herefordshire) Regiment of Foot, which became the 2nd Battalion of the Worcestershire Regiment in July of the same year. From 1884 to 1894 and again from 1896 to 1900 he was attached to the Egyptian Army, serving in the Camel Corps during the Mahdist War. He was awarded the Osminieh Order (fourth class) and Order of the Medjidie (fourth class) by the Khedive of Egypt, and made a companion of the Distinguished Service Order. He also served in the Second Anglo-Boer War, and he remained in South Africa until 1908. He was placed on half-pay on return to the United Kingdom, and officially retired from the army with the rank of brigadier-general in April 1914. Hickman entered politics, and was elected as Conservative member of parliament for Wolverhampton South at the general election of January 1910. He held the seat until its abolition at the 1918 general election. With the outbreak of World War I Hickman returned to the army, and was appointed general officer commanding the 109th Brigade, 36th (Ulster) Division, in September 1914. He remained with the brigade in France until 1916, then involving himself in recruitment activities. At the 1918 general election he was elected as Coalition Conservative MP for the new seat of Wolverhampton Bilston. He retired from parliament at the next election in 1922. He was the director of a number of companies and was master of the Albrighton Hunt. He died at his residence, Wergs Hall, near Wolverhampton, aged 71."

He moved to Leicester, a centre for the manufacture of footwear. In 1893 he began his career as full-time union official, taking up a post with the Leicester Branch of the Boot and Shoe Operatives. From 1894–1903 he was a member of Leicester Borough Council. Richards was chosen by the Labour Representation Committee to contest the Wolverhampton West constituency at the 1906 general election. Against expectations he defeated the sitting Conservative member of parliament, Sir Alfred Hickman. The Conservatives put their defeat down to apathy by their supporters, and when the next general election was held in January 1910 made a determined effort to regain the seat. Their candidate, Alfred Bird, was able to unseat Richards. Richards attempted to return to the Commons in December 1910 when he unsuccessfully contested East Northamptonshire. Richards returned to trade union work and local politics. He was general president of the National Union of Boot and Shoe Operatives from 1910–1929 and a member of the Management Committee of the General Federation of Trades Unions from 1905–1924. He was a member of Leicester City Council 1929–1939. He died at his home at Birstall, Leicester, aged 79 in October 1942."

He was a U.S. Congressman from North Carolina between 1805 and 1811. Born in Kenansville, North Carolina, Kenan was educated by private tutors at home. He married Mary Rand Kenan on January 3, 1800, and soon after the second Liberty Hall was built located in Kenansville after his father's home had been lost to fire. Kenan was a member of the North Carolina House of Commons representing Duplin County from 1798 to 1799. Between 1799 and 1803 he served in the North Carolina Senate in 1804. In 1804, Kenan was elected to the 9th United States Congress and was reelected to terms in the 10th and 11th Congresses (March 4, 1805 – March 3, 1811). He did not stand for reelection in 1810. He and Mary Rand had ten children and in March 1811 Thomas decided to move the family to Selma, Alabama, to start a new plantation. Thomas left behind his oldest son Owen Rand Kenan to look after the Liberty Hall Plantation and start his own family. While in Alabama, Thomas served as an Alabama State Representative. Kenan later moved to Selma, Alabama in 1833, where he engaged in planting; he served in the Alabama House of Representatives for several years before dying near Selma in 1843, aged 72. He is buried in Selma's Valley Creek Cemetery. He died in October 1843. He and his wife are buried at Valley Creek Cemetery near Selma."

  "text" : "Colonel Thomas Stephen Kenan (February 12, 1838 – December 23, 1911) was a Confederate soldier, and later a politician. His parents were Sarah Rebecca Graham and Owen Rand Kenan; he was the grandson of U.S. Congressman Thomas Kenan and great-grandson of Revolutionary War general James Kenan. He started his education in Duplin County, North Carolina at Old Grove Academy in Kenansville (the town was named for his great-grandfather in 1818). Later he spent a year at Central Military Institute in Selma, Alabama. Thomas spent his freshman year of college at Wake Forest in June. Thomas then transferred his sophomore year to the University of North Carolina where he would graduate in 1857. He studied law for two years with Judge Pearson at Richmond Hill where he practiced law in Kenansville. After graduation and during the Civil War he became Captain in the Duplin Rifles for the Confederate Army, elected Lieutenant Colonel of the 43rd Regiment in April 1862, and was promoted to Colonel later that year. He was wounded at the Battle of Gettysburg. While on an ambulance train, he and his older brother James Kenan were both captured; they were then imprisoned on Johnson's Island, Ohio. On March 22, 1865, he was released on parole but never switched sides during the war. On his return home he was elected to the State legislature from 1865-1867. Later that year he ran for Congress and lost. Not letting that defeat end his political career, he moved to Wilson, North Carolina, where he became mayor and was elected North Carolina Attorney General, serving from 1877-1885. In May 1868 he married Miss Sallie Dortch but they had no children; Sallie died in 1916."

She is best known for her natural treatment of AIDS and related diseases with a lemon mixture, garlic and beetroot. She was the caretaker of Nozipho Bhengu, who died in 2006 from an AIDS-related illness after being persuaded to stop taking her medication. Bhengu posthumously became a center of awareness on HIV/AIDS. She works with her mother Nelly van der Maas, who appears with her in the documentary, Power to the People. The documentary was filmed in Kwazulu-Natal during 2005, believed to have the highest HIV infection rate in South Africa at the time. The core ingredients of her Wellness Program is the lemon and olive oil mixture among others. Former South African president Thabo Mbeki questioned the link between HIV and AIDS. In his speech to the 13th International AIDS Conference in Durban (2000), he stated, \"The world's biggest killer and the greatest cause of ill health and suffering across the globe, including South Africa, is extreme poverty.\" This occurred at the same time Tine van der Maas came to public attention working with then Minister of Health, Dr. Manto Tshabalala-Msimang."

  "text" : "Hans Thomas von Absberg (1477 – 3 July 1531) was a Frankish knight of the Absberg family, known as a robber baron. He kidnapped important travellers like royal legates or merchants from Nuremberg or Augsburg. He was supported by several Frankish knights, who helped to hide the hostages, e.g. members of the houses of Sparneck or the Guttenberg. The hostages were taken on a route with several castles far away from the point they were kidnapped. An advantage for Thomas von Absberg were the nearby borders of several principalities and sometimes he escaped to Bohemia. He was known for the cruelty of cutting off the right hand with a dussack and sending it to the family of his victims to underline his demands for ransom. Eventually prisoners held at the Waldsteinburg were able to escape and reveal who the supporters of Thomas von Absberg were and where their castles were. To punish the behaviour of Thomas von Absberg the Swabian League destroyed the family's castle seat in 1523, as well as all of the castles belonging to the House of Sparneck. This was documented in a series of woodcuts by Hans Wandereisen. But Thomas von Absberg was not caught and continued his robbery, until he was murdered in Alten-Sedlitz in 1531 by one of his accomplices."

The son of Lochlann, king of Galloway, Thomas was an active agent of his brother Alan of Galloway as well as the English and Scottish kings. When King John, the English monarch, decided that central and western Ulster were to be added to his dominions (with the earldom of Ulster already created by John de Courcy), he conscripted Thomas and Alan of Galloway to his aid, offering them much of later counties Antrim, Londonderry and Tyrone as incentive. Thomas had begun his recorded career as a mercenary in Angevin service, and obtained much land in Ireland while gaining several victories with his fleet. In Scotland he obtained from William the Lion marriage to Isabella of Atholl, heiress to the province of Atholl in central Scotland. Although little is otherwise known about his life in Scotland, he was involved in the affairs of Coupar Angus Abbey, while much of his Irish activity coincided with and supported the interests of the Scottish ruling dynasty there in opposing the allies of the MacWilliams. He left one heir in Patrick, mormaer of Atholl, but the latter's premature death at the hands of the Bisset family meant that Thomas's line had failed by the 1240s."

  "text" : "Tom Cone (born Thomas Edward Cone, 1947 – April 2012) was a Canadian-American playwright and librettist. His work often presented provocative ideas about morality and art and it stretches existing forms through the integration of music and the visual arts. In many of Cone's plays characters are \"riding a fault line, about to make a change which may result in tragedy,\" sharing an \"evocative, somewhat taboo recollection of their common past.\" In True Mummy two former lovers who once crossed a dangerous line together, are reunited. The title of the play refers to a black, luminous glaze used by artists such as JMW Turner, that was made from the ash of cremated mummies. Visions of life and death of an Egyptian Princess form alternating scenes, and, as she is being prepared for mummification, towards the end of the play when a Turner painting is displayed, it becomes clear that she is on it. Other plays include Herringbone, Stargazing and Love at Last Sight and Cone wrote librettos for operas The Architect (for Vancouver Opera, 1993), The Gang (Vancouver New Music, 1997), and Game Misconduct (Vancouver Playhouse 2000). He also wrote adaptations of Molière's The Miser and Goldoni's The Servant of Two Masters  which were performed at the Stratford Festival where he was a writer-in-residence between 1978 and 1980. He adapted Herringbone into a musical in 1981, with music by Skip Kennon and lyrics by Ellen Fitzhugh. It premiered in Chicago followed by productions in New York at Playwrights Horizons, in London at The King's Head Theatre, at the Edinburgh Festival, at Hartford Stage starring Joel Grey, and in many cities throughout North America. From 2007 to 2009 it toured Williamstown Theater Festival, McCarter Theatre (Princeton, NJ) and the La Jolla Playhouse (CA) in a production starring BD Wong, directed by Roger Rees.Tom Cone lived in Vancouver where he was an active curator and promotor of experimental music and the avant-garde. He died in April 2012 of cancer."

  "text" : "Patricia Rae Hunter, known by her nickname Tricia, is a former California state Assemblywoman in San Diego, California. A nurse by profession and a former member of the Registered Nurse Board, she won a special election to the state Assembly in 1989 in a major upset that caught both political parties by surprise. In the Assembly, she became known as an expert in health care and an advocate for the practicing registered nurses. Considered a moderate, she was disliked by conservatives and faced vigorous primary challenges. She was reelected by a comfortable margin in 1990, and in 1991, an attempt was made to recall her but it failed. However, the following year, redistricting dramatically changed the boundaries of her district and she had to run in a different district in 1992. That year, she was narrowly defeated by Democrat Julie Bornstein. After the election, she also worked for the Flannery Group, a lobbying firm. She sought to return to the state Assembly in 1996, but lost a close race to Democrat Howard Wayne, a former state Assistant Attorney General. After her second election loss, she was appointed Special Assistant to the Health and Human Services Agency and to the California Medical Assistance Commission by Governor Pete Wilson. In 2004, she sought to return to the state Assembly again in, but lost the election to Democrat Lori Saldaña. Hunter is currently a member of the Government Relations Group, a lobbying group that she helped found. She continues to be outspoken on health care issues and do volunteer nursing work."

In 2001, BBC News described her as one of Russia's \"best-known news presenters\". In 1991, she received one of the first International Press Freedom Awards from the Committee to Protect Journalists. In January 2001, she was summoned by prosecutors to discuss an alleged $70,000 loan from NTV. The summons came in the midst of an attempted takeover of the station by Gazprom, and Mitkova described it as \"psychological pressure and a direct threat to journalists.\" At the end of the month, a Moscow court gave Gazprom control of NTV's owner Media-Most, which was by then described by BusinessWeek as \"Russia's sole independent national television station\" and by the New York Times as \"the last nationwide voice critical of President Vladimir V. Putin\". Despite a lockout of some journalists who refused to \"plead fealty\" to new management, Mitkova was persuaded to stay with the station by new owner Boris Jordan."

  "text" : "Tanfield Vachell (1602–1658) was an English politician who sat in the House of Commons between 1645 and 1653. Vachell was the son of John Vachell of Warfield and his wife Mary Vincent, daughter of Clement Vincent of Peckleton, Leicestershire. He was baptised Gayton, Northamptonshire on 27 December 1602. He was educated at Exeter College, Oxford, taking BA in 1622. His uncle, Sir Thomas Vachell of Coley Park in Reading, Berkshire, who had married three times and had no issue, wanted someone of his name and blood to inherit the Vachell estates which had become concentrated upon him. Vachell was therefore persuaded to marry and after the uncle’s death in 1638, Vachell inherited the estates. He was High Sheriff of Berkshire in 1641. Vachell was also influenced by his uncle's widow, Lady Letitia (née Knollys) Vachell who married John Hampden, and supported the Parliamentary cause during the Civil War. Lady Vachell carried on living at Coley Park, whilst Tanfield rented the Reading home of her grandfather at Abbey House. On 1 November 1642, the King gave instructions for Vachell to escort him through the county, but as this had previously been an excuse to disband local militia, Vachell refused to obey. In 1645, Vachell was elected Member of Parliament for Reading in a disputed election to the Long Parliament. Vachell was more concerned with arts than politics and built a collection of rare pictures, books and curios. His portrait was painted by Sir Peter Lely. In around 1651, he restored Coley Park. Vachell died at Reading in May 1658 and was buried in St Mary's Church in Reading on 1 June 1658. Vachell married firstly Anne Cox, daughter of Richard Cox, an alderman of London. She died childless in 1651 and was buried in the chancel of St. Mary Woolnoth in London. In 1652, he married Rebecca Leman, daughter of Sir William Leman, 1st Baronet, Parliament’s Treasurer of War. She survived him, but he had no issue by either wife. Vachell left his \"several paintings and books of print, [his] collection of medals in gold, silver and brass; all [his] ware, turnings of ivory and guyacombe with [his] presse of bookes and [his] chest of drawers with the perspective in it, to his wife for life, and failing issue to the son of his kinsman, Thomas.\" A codicil executed in his last illness, resulted in about fifteen years' litigation between his widow and his heir. After the Lord Chief Justice, the Lord Chief Baron and various civilians became involved, the case was eventually decided in favour of his heir. It is still a leading case — Vachell v. Leman. The Coley estate passed, upon his death to Thomas Vatchell, the son of his kinsman Thomas who had refused his uncle's request to marry. The suburb of Coley Park was built largely on the lands of the estate."

  "text" : "Terry \"Lucky Tel\" Hogan (1931–15 January 1995) was a professional criminal and prominent figure in the London underworld in the 1950s and 1960s. Terry Hogan was born in 1931 and grew up in Fulham. In his teens, he was recruited by notorious gang leader Billy Hill, he took part in the Eastcastle Street mailbag robbery in which £287,000 (worth 7.8 million pounds in 2014) was stolen from a Post Office van on its way across the West End from Paddington station. The crime was regarded so seriously that then prime minister Winston Churchill received daily updates on the investigation and Parliament demanded an explanation from the Postmaster General, Herbrand Sackville, as to how it had been allowed to happen. It was one of the first intensely masterminded robberies that would rock Britain. Terry Hogan had been responsible for getting into the cab of the mail van during the Eastcastle street robbery and, according to notorious thief George \"Taters\" Chatham, who had taught him how to cat burgle, he was lucky to escape. Taters had been associated with Peter Scott ('the human fly') - who was reputed to be the thief of Sophia Lauren's hotel suite jewellery. Terry Hogan knew the ramifications of getting caught from the Eastcastle robbery, it would not just be imprisonment but threats from gang leaders. No one was captured for this huge crime. Lucky Tel had been recruited as a boy, into being a bookmakers runner and later to steal, he was also running from a physically abusive childhood. A punch as a child left him deaf in one ear. His boyhood years haunted him in later life, crime to him as a boy was his only escape from poverty and abuse, he was fast and the only time his family paid him the slightest attention was when he brought stolen money home to them. He became obsessed with timing. Everything was timed and re-timed including crime which made him the perfect criminal, with an OCD attention to minute detail. During the Eastcastle St. robbery he timed the distances and mail delivery vans over many days and when questioned by police while he was watching the street, he said that he was a film producer, locating good areas for a gangster film. In fact, the Eastcastle St. Robbery was mentioned in the Alec Guinness film Arsenic and Old Lace. In 1962 Hogan was involved in the robbery of an armoured payroll truck at Heathrow Airport, in which £62,000 (approximately £2 million today) was stolen. It was a deeply planned and sophisticated robbery, involving a film company make up artist, wigs, suits and bowler hats. He had contact with the Krays only when he escaped from their small basement window after an argument, it was a LUCKY Tel escape, as he always kept far away from them. On the day of the Great Train Robbery in 1963 Hogan was in Cannes with a family of French–Iranian millionaires. Hogan believed the plan was flawed once the gang got too big - one squeal and they would fall like dominoes, as they did. He repeated over and over to the robbers to keep their gloves on, and perhaps to torch the farm to remove evidence - this was ignored. His daughter (5 years old) recalled dragging black bags into the garage, unaware of their contents, thinking it was a game. Terry Hogan shielded the money for two nights. He also helped Great Train Robber Bruce Reynolds to stay on the run, often looking after Bruce's young son and wife. He was a generous man, he gave a lot of money away, and like many criminals of his time died in poverty. Many of the great train robbers, died through murder, suicide, or in prison, or came out of prison to find the proceeds of their robbery spent and gone. Married and with a family, Terry Hogan decided to quit crime completely in the 1960s. He went into the textile business and lived a respectable life in West London. After wrestling with the demons of his childhood and a deep wish to reform and become sober, he sponsored many people in AA and found great solace there. His son Keith was born and was his life - he taught his three children honesty and spent large amounts of money on buying them the education he never had. During Terry's life, his family saw him struggle with the guilt he felt for crime In the latter years of his life he was profoundly affected by the deaths of several of his friends and fellow robbers: the shooting of Charlie Wilson in 1990, the suicide of Buster Edwards in 1994, and the death of Rick Withers. He committed suicide on 15 January 1995. He jumped from his top flat window, crouching for a while, before deciding to jump to his death, he felt he had become a burden, he died in the road where a family member found him. The last phone call he made was to say he wished he could have taken a different road in life, and that he regretted everything, the crime and his intermittent alcoholism, everything, except his wife and children. The money was never worth the mental struggles he had in later life, coming to terms with what he had done to get it, and having been forced to witness violent, psychotic gang behaviour, where one of his 'bosses' carved the letter 'V' for victory on the faces of his enemies before the open wounds were stitched up by a tailor - something a sixteen-year-old boy would never forget. He paid for his crimes with his life, and his psychiatrist said to his daughter after he died, \"there was nothing his family could have done to save him, it was all in his childhood\"."

  "text" : "Thomas L'Archer (died 1329) was an English monk. He held the office of English Prior of the Order of St. John of Jerusalem, but his incompetence in matters of finance left the Order in severe financial difficulty. He was born at Tanworth in Arden in Warwickshire, younger son of John L'Archer and Margery Barniville. His father's family owned Umberslade Hall from the time of Henry II until the nineteenth century. Two of his brothers also entered the Church, while John L'Archers, prior of the Order's Irish house in the 1340s, was his great-nephew. In 1321, Thomas became English Prior of the Order. He proved to be a most unfortunate choice as Prior: through a combination of old age and financial incompetence, he appears to have bankrupted the English house. The Grand Master of the Order of St. John set up an inquiry into the state of the English house, which recommended Thomas's removal on grounds of old age. He died soon afterwards, on 28 August 1329. Under his priory the Hospitallers acquired 33 ex-Templar possessions, distinct more than under his predecessors and successors."

  "text" : "Thomas Bancroft (1756–1811), was a vicar of Bolton-le-Moors in Lancashire, England. Bancroft was the son of Thomas Bancroft, a thread-maker, was born in Deansgate, Manchester. At the age of six he was admitted into the Manchester Grammar School, where, in course of time, he became a teacher. He held a school exhibition from 1778 to 1781, and graduated B.A. at Brasenose College, Oxford, 10 October 1781. In 1780 he obtained the Craven scholarship; in the same year he assisted in correcting the edition of Homer published by the Clarendon Press, and further helped Dr. Falconer in correcting an edition of Strabo. Being disappointed of a fellowship at Oxford, he returned to Manchester grammar school as assistant master, and remained there until he was appointed head-master of King Henry VIII's school at Chester. ‘Towards the end of last century,’ writes Dr. Ormerod, ‘the school attained a considerable degree of classical celebrity under the direction of the late Rev. Thomas Bancroft, afterwards vicar of Bolton-le-Moors in Lancashire. Plays were occasionally performed by the boys, and a collection of Greek, Latin, and English exercises, partly written by the scholars and partly by Mr. Bancroft, was published at Chester (1788) under the title of “Prolusiones Poeticæ”’. While at this school he married Miss Bennett, of Willaston Hall, against the wishes of her father, a wine merchant in Chester. Her father prevented an attempted elopement by running his sword through Bancroft's leg, a feat for which he had to pay Bancroft 1,000l. compensation. A marriage soon afterwards took place in defiance of the father, who was never reconciled to his daughter. He bequeathed, however, 1,000l. each to her two daughters. In 1793 Bancroft was presented by Bishop Cleaver to the living of Bolton-le-Moors, then worth about 250l. a year. In 1798 Bancroft was made chaplain to the Bolton volunteers by royal warrant, and four years previously he had been appointed domestic chaplain to Viscount Castle-Stewart. He was made one of the four ‘king's preachers’ allowed to the county of Lancaster by Dr. Majendie, bishop of Chester, in 1807. He continued vicar of Bolton until his death on 5 February 1811. There is a tablet to his memory in the parish church. He published various sermons, the ‘Prolusiones’ already mentioned, and wrote three dissertations (Oxford, 1835). Two tracts, ‘The Credibility of Christianity vindicated,’ Manchester, 1831, and ‘The Englishman armed against the Infidel Spirit of the Times,’ Stockport, 1833, were privately printed for his son-in-law, J. Bradshaw Isherwood. There remain several of his manuscripts in possession of the family of Major Fell, of Bolton, who married one of Bancroft's granddaughters."

  "text" : "Timothy Lee \"Tim\" Blixseth (born 1950) is an American real estate developer, record producer, songwriter and timber baron. He was a co-founder of the Yellowstone Club in Montana. In 2006, Blixseth was featured in the Forbes 400 List of wealthiest Americans with a net worth of $1.3 billion. However, based on court records from his 2009 divorce, news reports estimated his 2011 net worth to have dropped to $200 million. By 2012 he faced a forced bankruptcy for failing to pay Montana $57 million in income taxes and in 2014 he told the courts he was \"too broke\" to pay pending judgments and contempt findings for his fraud role in the Yellowstone Club bankruptcy. Blixseth's wealth and assets have been the subject of controversy. The bankruptcy of the Yellowstone Club in 2008 led to extensive litigation with Blixseth and his creditors. The property emerged from bankruptcy under new ownership in 2009. In December 2014 and again in April 2015 he was jailed for civil contempt for failing to pay court ordered sanctions and disclose what happened to assets the court had ordered held to pay his creditors. As of December 14, 2015, Blixseth remains jailed for the contempt, near Great Falls, Montana."

He was an activist and influential strategist in the Civil Rights Movement. He was a senior adviser and leader in the U.S. labor movement. Kahn was raised in New York City. At Brooklyn College, he joined the U.S. socialist movement, where he was influenced by Max Shachtman and Michael Harrington. As an assistant to civil rights leader Bayard Rustin, Kahn helped to organize the 1963 March on Washington, during which Martin Luther King delivered his \"I Have a Dream\" speech. Kahn's analysis of the civil rights movement influenced Bayard Rustin (who was the nominal author of Kahn's \"From Protest to Politics\"). A leader in the Socialist Party of America, Kahn supported its 1972 name change to Social Democrats, USA (SDUSA). Like other leaders of SDUSA, Kahn worked to support free labor-unions and democracy and to oppose Soviet communism; he also worked to strengthen U.S. labor unions. Kahn worked as a senior assistant to and speechwriter for Democratic Senator Henry \"Scoop\" Jackson, AFL–CIO Presidents George Meany and Lane Kirkland, and other leaders of the Democratic Party, labor unions, and civil-rights organizations. In 1980 Lane Kirkland appointed Kahn to organize the AFL–CIO's support for the Polish labor-union Solidarity; this support was made despite protests by the USSR and the Carter administration. He acted as the Director of the AFL–CIO's Department of International Affairs in 1986 and was officially named Director in 1989. Kahn died in 1992, at the age of 53."

Tina has spoken openly about being born in the cult The Children of God and subsequently being raised in foster care in California. She created a podcast called \"Cultish\" where she interviewed former members of cults, and discussed her uncle Rick Dupuy's public defection. She has been a poster child for Alcoholics Anonymous.
