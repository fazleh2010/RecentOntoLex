Moosa (2003), Runway (2004), Thuruppu Gulan (2005), Twenty:20 (2008), Pokkiri Raja (2010), Christian Brothers (2011) and Mayamohini (2012); all turning out to be big commercial hits. The duo started their career as assistant directors and wrote their first screenplay in 1997, for Hitler Brothers. They got their break through Mattuppetti Machan (1998) but it was Udayapuram Sulthan (1999) that made them bankable screenwriters. They made memorable films with directors including Joshiy, Johny Antony, Jose Thomas and Sandhya Mohan. The duo are often criticised for the lack of content in their screenplays, their continuous association with superstars. But most of their films were big hits owing to the elitist nature of the industry. The duo part away in 2015, Udayakrishna to continue as a scriptwriter while Sibi K. Thomas as a filmmaker. Udayakrishna penned his first Independent script Puli Murugan in 2015 and is scripting for Sibi's first directorial debut."

Following the protests, he went into hiding and published two editorials critical of the Burmese government in the Washington Post and The Guardian on 4 November 2007. He was arrested the same day. In October 2008, he was sentenced to 68 years in prison, including 12 years hard labour; the sentence was reduced to 65 years on appeal. Gambira reportedly protested his imprisonment by organising chanting with other imprisoned monks, boycotting his trial, and going on hunger strike. Human rights groups including Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch also protested his imprisonment. Gambira was released during a mass pardon of prisoners on 13 January 2012 as part of the 2011–2012 Burmese political reforms. He ceased to be a monk in April 2012, stating that he had been unable to find a monastery to join due to his status as a former prisoner. He was re-arrested at least three times in 2012."

He retired as the additional director of India's Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), which he served as an officer of the Indian Police Service (West Bengal cadre, 1968 batch). He first became a news-maker by relentlessly pursuing former Chief Ministers of Bihar, Jagannath Mishra and Lalu Prasad Yadav in the Rs. 950 crore Fodder scam as the joint Director (East), CBI. As the joint director in CBI, his honest investigation report to the court was changed with a milder one written by his deputy Ranjit Sinha by the head of the CBI, Joginder Singh to please the political establishment, for which the CBI received strictures from the court. He created a controversy by seeking the help of the Indian Army in rushing to arrest Lalu Prasad Yadav, following which he was harassed by his department and the political establishment. He is also known as a caste historian. His efficiency and honesty were always on the top. He was involved in detecting and resolving many scams when he held the Office of the Joint Director, Central Bureau of Investigation aka CBI.The most popular of these was perhaps the scam for Chara Ghotala in which he caught the corrupt politician Lalu Prasad Yadav and sent him to jail also. Even after threats to his life from different politicians,he did his duties perfectly up to the end.After retirement from his job, he joined the All India Trinamool Congress party and won from Bagda in Bongaon subdivision."

In 2008, he won a Daniel Pearl Journalism Fellowship, becoming the first Pearl fellow to work at The New York Times. He also attended London School of Economics as a Chevening Scholar (Chevening Scholarship) doing M.Sc. in Comparative Politics (Conflict studies). On 4 September 2010, he was abducted, beaten, flogged and sexually assaulted by a group of assailants. They also shaved his head, eyebrows, and mustache. Cheema reported that his attackers asked him if he was trying to discredit the government with his reporting, leading him to believe that they were from Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence agency. Following the incident, The New York Times issued an editorial calling on the Pakistani government to \"make clear that it will no longer abet or condone this behavior ... [and] to find out who abducted Mr. Cheema and bring them to justice.\" The Committee to Protect Journalists echoed the call, describing the attack as \"a message sent to all journalists in Pakistan\" that must be answered. For his brave journalism and willingness to publicly speak about the attack at risk of his own life, the CPJ awarded Cheema its 2011 International Press Freedom Award, \"an annual recognition of courageous journalism\". In his acceptance speech, Cheema thanked the group for its \"recognition of the bold work Pakistani media is doing\". On 14 April 2011, Cheema also received the Tully Center Free Speech Award of Syracuse University. Cheema is a father of a son and a daughter. Adil, his son, was two years old when Cheema was abducted."
