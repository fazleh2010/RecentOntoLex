  "text" : "Viktor Stepanovych Kosenko (Ukrainian: Віктор Степанович Косенко; 23 November [O.S. 11 November] 1896 – 3 October 1938) was a Ukrainian composer, concert pianist, and educator born in Saint Petersburg. Regarded by his contemporaries as a master of lyricism, his first compositions were markedly influenced by the works of composers such as Alexander Scriabin, Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky, Sergei Rachmaninoff, and his compatriot Mykola Lysenko. Kosenko's life is conclusively divided into three distinct phases, in Warsaw, where he studied with renowned teachers Mikhail Sokolovsky and Iryna Miklashovskaya, in Zhytomyr, where he began teaching piano and music theory at the Music Technicum, later becoming director of the Zhytomyr Music School, and finally in Kiev, where he devoted more time to symphonic compositions such as his Heroic Overture, which brought him due recognition in the world of Soviet music. A true artist in the very sense of the word, he was a leading figure among the broad-minded artistic collective of the 20th-century Ukrainian music. Kosenko's legacy is filled with romantic feeling and intonations of Slavic folk songs and Western-European influences. His vocal, chamber and symphonic works are among the most important pieces of that time in Ukraine. He composed over 100 compositions for piano among waltzes, preludes, nocturnes, sonatas and mazurkas, in a total of about 250 musical works such as his symphonic Moldavian poem, violin and piano concertos, trios and string quartets during his short musical career. His vocal compositions include a large number of ballads, choral and folk arrangements as well."

She first appeared in London under Frederick Gye's management at the Lyceum Theatre on 28 May 1857, as Amina in La sonnambula. On 31 March 1860, she was married to Sir John Fiennes Twisleton Crampton, 2nd Baronet, the British minister to Russia. The marriage was annulled on her petition on 20 November 1863 on grounds of impotence. In 1864, she married José Bernardin Fernández de Velasco, duke of Frías, a grandee of Spain. On 2 January 1871, she died in Madrid. She was buried in Burgos Cathedral, leaving behind three children."

He graduated from MSU Faculty of Journalism in 1955. He lived in Moscow working as an editor of Molodaya Gvardiya publishing house. Burich's poetry was occasionally published as early as 1961, but a certain degree of recognition came only in the 1980s and 90s with the appearance of the first collections of Russian vers libre \"Beliy Kvadrat\" (lit. White Square), \"Vremya Iks\" (lit. Time X) and later the Anthology of Russian vers libre. Burich was an ardent supporter of vers libre at a time when it was nearly nonexistent in the USSR. He translated modern Polish, Czech and Serbian poetry into Russian. The poetry of Vladimir Burich is minimalist, precise and aphoristic, often with both social and philosophical overtones. Often poignant and somber, Burich' vers libre attempts to contain as much emotion in as few as possible words."

  "text" : "Vasily Mikhailovich Zarubin Василий Михайлович Зарубин (1894–1972) was a Soviet intelligence officer. In the United States, he used the cover name Vasily Zubilin and served as Soviet intelligence Rezident from 1941 to 1944. Zarubin's wife, Elizabeth Zubilin, served with him. Zarubin was born in Moscow. He served with the Russian Imperial Army on the Eastern Front during World War I from 1914. For agitation against the war Zarubin served in a penal battalion. Zarubin was wounded in March 1917. He served in the Red Army and fought in the Russian Civil War from 1918-1920. He joined the Cheka in 1920 and served in its internal security section. In 1923 he was appointed as the chief of economic division OGPU in Vladivostok and organized the fight with the smuggling of narcotics and weapons from Europe to China. In 1925 he transferred to foreign intelligence. In 23 years of service, 13 years were on the Illegal work in different countries. He served as a legal officer in China (1925), a legal officer in Finland (1926), \"Illegal\" Rezident in Denmark and Germany (1927–1929) posing as a Czechoslovak citizen Jaroslav Koček and his wife Liza, born Rosenzweig as Mariana Koček, an Illegal Rezident in France (1929–1933), and an Illegal Rezident in Germany (1933–1937) after Adolf Hitler came to power. In 1937, Zarubin returned to the USSR for work with the KGB's central apparatus and was awarded the Order of the Red Banner for his work in creating the underground antifascist groups. From 1939 to 1940 he was one of NKVD's officers in Kozelsk camp for Polish prisoners of war. In Kozelsk his task was to investigate the Polish POWs in the camp. After most of the POWs were massacred in the Katyn Forest, he was reassigned to other duties. In 1940 he survived an accusation of working for the Gestapo. In the spring of 1941 he undertook an assignment in China. He is credited with obtaining information from a high-ranking German adviser to Chiang Kai-shek about Hitler's plans to attack the USSR in mid-1941. Zarubin became the chief of the KGB legal Rezidentura in the United States in the fall of 1941. On 12 October 1941, just as the Germans were on the outskirts of Moscow, Zarubin was personally directed by Joseph Stalin to his primary task: to discover if the United States would attempt to arrange for a separate peace with Germany. Zarubin was unpopular with the other agents in New York City. It was believed that he showed too much faith in Elizabeth Zarubina and other officers he had brought with him to the United States. One of his officers, Vassili Dorogov reported back to Moscow that he disapproved of his \"crudeness, general lack of manners, use of street language and obscenities, carelessness in his work, and repugnant secretiveness.\" Zarubin came to the attention of the FBI when in April 1943, he attempted to meet Steve Nelson, a member of the Communist Party of the United States in California. \"Zarubin travelled to California for a secret meeting with Steve Nelson, who ran a secret control commission to seek out informants and spies in the Californian branch of the Communist Party, but failed to find Nelson's home. Only on a second visit did he succeed in delivering the money. On this occasion, however, the meeting was bugged by the FBI which had placed listening devices in Nelson's home.\"  The FBI bug confirmed that Zarubin had \"paid a sum of money\" to Nelson \"for the purpose of placing Communist Party members and Comintern agents in industries engaged in secret war production for the United States Government so that the information could be obtained for transmittal to the Soviet Union.\" Zarubin actively participated in recruiting work. The Rezidency obtained political information from the United States Government, and the scientific-technical information that was highly valuable to Moscow and regularly reported to Stalin. The Rezidentura under Zarubin achieved large results and made the weighty contribution to strengthening of the economic and military power of the Soviet Union. Zarubin was recalled in 1944 to face a second accusation of working for the Germans, which he survived. For the results achieved during September 1944 Zarubin received the title of the Commissioner of State Security, and by the decision of the Council of People's Commissars of the USSR on 9 July 1945 became a Major General. After returning to the USSR, Zarubin became deputy chief of foreign intelligence and simultaneously deputy chief of illegal foreign intelligence. He worked in this capacity up to 1948 when he was discharged due to health status. Zarubin was awarded the Order of Lenin twice, the Order of the Red Banner twice, and the Red Star, with many other medals."

  "text" : "Vasil Kostov Glavinov (Bulgarian and Macedonian: Васил Костов Главинов) (Veles, 1872 – Sofia, 1929) was a Bulgarian socialist from Ottoman Macedonia, a member of the Bulgarian Workers' Social Democratic Party. He is considered a Macedonian in the Republic of Macedonia. Glavinov worked in his native Veles before moving to Sofia in 1887. There he went bankrupt, owing to the financial support which he gave to the first Bulgarian theatre troupe. In July 1891 on the initiative of Dimitar Blagoev, several social democratic circles united to form the Bulgarian Social Democratic Party (BSDP). In 1892 Glavinov became acquainted with Dimitar Blagoev's exposition of the Marxist view of history and in 1894 he entered the Bulgarian Social Democratic Workers Party. In the same year, under Vasil Glavinov's leadership and in order of Blagoev, the first Social-Democratic group in Ottoman Macedonia was formed. In 1896 Glavinov founded a Macedonian Revolutionary Social-Democratic Union, as part of the Bulgarian Workers' Social-Democrat Party. The last idea was probably influenced by the League for the Balkan Confederation, created in 1894 by Balkan socialists, which supported Macedonian autonomy inside a general federation of Southeast Europe. In Sofia Glavinov met the future leader of the Internal Macedonian-Adrianople Revolutionary Organization (IMARO) Gotse Delchev and both became a friends. Glavinov also edited several Socialist papers here. The first Conference of Macedonian Socialists was held on June 3, 1900, near Krushevo, where the activities of Vasil Glavinov's political group defined the basic aspects of the creation of a Macedonian Republic as a part of a Balkan Socialist Federation, with equal rights to all its citizens. After the Young Turk Revolution in 1908, he moved to the Ottoman Empire and initially gravitated around the People's Federative Party (Bulgarian Section). The newspaper \"Rabotnicheska Iskra\" (Worker's Spark), edited by him, described the two rivaling Bulgarian parties at the time, the PFP (Bulgarian Section) and the Union of the Bulgarian Constitutional Clubs. According to the newspaper, both of the parties, the former a defender of the poorer Bourgeois, the latter - of the richer, were nationalist and were led by desires of unification with Bulgaria. Because of that, Glavinov was disappointed and entered the Ottoman Socialist Party in Salonica in 1910. It was actually not a real political party, but rather a group of intellectuals. In the same year he participated also in the First Balkan Socialist Conference held in Belgrade, which important aspect was the call for a solution to the Macedonian Question. After the Young Turks had taken stringent measures against it, difficult times began for the Ottoman Socialist Party. As a consequence, on the eve of the Balkan Wars in 1911 Glavinov moved back to Sofia, where he rejoined the Bulgarian Narrow Socialists. Here he opposed the Balkan Wars and World War I and was sympathetic to the October Revolution in Russia. In 1919 his Bulgarian Social Democratic Workers' Party (Narrow Socialists) joined the Comintern and was reorganised as the Communist Party of Bulgaria. In 1920 Glavinov was elected as a member of the Central Emigrant's Commission to the Central Committee of the Party. After the St Nedelya Church assault on 16 April 1925 he was arrested and afterwards Glavinov withdrеw from political life. He died in Sofia in 1929."

  "text" : "Victor Charles Carlson (16 July 1893 – 23 February 1974) was an Australian rules footballer who played with East Fremantle in the West Australian Football League (WAFL). Carlson spent his early childhood in Adelaide and almost died at the age of six following an incident with a train. He had been sitting in a cart beside a shop when the horse became uncontrollable and backed onto railway tracks, just as a train was approaching. The train ran over the cart and Carlson was thrown out upon impact. With only a minor scalp wound, Carlson was later found safe under the train after it had stopped. Now living in Western Australia, Carlson captained Wentworth, a junior club in Fremantle, before joining Easts. He was a wingman in East Fremantle's 1914 premiership team and also played in their 1918 premiership side, as a centre half back. He was also a leading district cricketer and represented Western Australia in three first-class matches. Playing as a right handed top order batsman, he could only make 14 runs in his five innings. This included a pair against Victoria at the Fitzroy Cricket Ground, when he opened the batting and was bowled by Bert Ironmonger in each innings."

  "text" : "Vasili Ivanovich Vainonen, also spelled Vasily (Russian: Васи́лий Ива́нович Вайно́нен) (1901-1964), was a renowned Soviet choreographer, mainly for the Kirov Ballet, now known as the Mariinsky Ballet, with which he worked from 1930 to 1938. Perhaps his most celebrated production was his 1934 version of Tchaikovsky's The Nutcracker, a production which was successfully revived in 1954, is available on DVD in a 1994 revival, and remains in the repertory of the company to this day. Other choreographers of the beloved Christmas ballet, such as Mikhail Baryshnikov and Yuri Grigorovich, have freely borrowed several ideas supposedly from the Vainonen Nutcracker for their own productions. (Vainonen is often erroneously credited with being the first choreographer to introduce the idea that Clara's adventures with the Nutcracker turns out to be a dream, a plot twist not found in the 1892 original production, and he is also often mistakenly credited with the idea of casting adults rather than children in the roles of Clara and the Nutcracker/ Prince, thereby introducing a love interest into the plot which was not present in the original production. It was choreographer Alexander Gorsky who actually came up with both these ideas in his 1919 revival of the ballet.) However, Baryshnikov, in his production of The Nutcracker did borrow Vainonen's choreography for the \"Snowflake Waltz\", and gave him credit for it in the billing.  He also included, like Vainonen, a puppet show staged by Drosselmeyer during the Christmas Party scene. The puppet show foreshadows the later fantasy scenes by having a Prince, a Princess, and a Mouse King as characters. Vainonen choreographed several other ballets, one of the most notable being the first full-length staging of Dimitri Shostakovich's The Golden Age. He also spent a total of eight years with the Bolshoi Ballet."

Under Harris, the Jewish Telegraph expanded to four editions in four major British cities – Manchester, Leeds, Liverpool and Glasgow. Her husband and newspaper co-founder Frank Harris died in 1979. Their son, Paul, became group editor while Vivienne remained financial director and co-owner. In June 1997, Harris was the recipient of the MBE for her contributions to journalism and to Greater Manchester. She remained the Jewish Telegraph's financial director until her death in 2011. Harris was active in numerous charitable organizations, including Save the Children, the Citizens Advice Bureau of Salford, the League of Jewish Women, St Ann's Hospice and the Jewish Day Centre.

  "text" : "Victor Vianu is a computer scientist, a professor of computer science and engineering at the University of California, San Diego and since 2009 the editor-in-chief of the Journal of the ACM. Vianu did his graduate studies at the University of Southern California, earning his Ph.D. in 1983 under the supervision of Seymour Ginsburg; he joined the UCSD faculty in 1984. Vianu's book Foundations of Databases (with Serge Abiteboul and Richard Hull, Addison-Wesley, 1995) is a standard graduate textbook in database theory. In finite model theory and computational complexity theory, the Abiteboul–Vianu theorem (also published with Abiteboul, at the 1991 Symposium on Theory of Computing) states that polynomial time equals PSPACE if and only if fixed point logic equals partial fixed point logic. At the 2010 Symposium on Principles of Database Systems, Vianu and his co-authors Dan Suciu and Tova Milo won the Alberto O. Mendelzon Test-of-Time Award for their work ten years prior on type checking for XML transformation languages. In 2006, Vianu was elected as a Fellow of the ACM for his \"contributions to database management systems\". In his first paper recorded by DBLP (presented at MFCS, 1977), Vianu acknowledges Solomon Marcus for guidance."

He has also worked on the ontology of material digital objects and of the so-called cyberspace. He has also put some work into the analysis of 'borderline topics such as the relation between philosophy and psychoanalysis, and philosophy and cinema. He has been involved in the project \"Ethicbots\" in the field of roboethics and is Director of the Research Project Metaphysik und Ontologie in der Schweiz im Zeitalter der Reformation (1519-1648) funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation.

The woman's claims contrast with Putin's official biography, which states that Putin's parents died before he became president. The Telegraph concluded that while the woman might be simply wrong or part of a public relations effort, the story \"identifies the holes in the known story of Mr Putin's past\". The official story is that Putin's parents were already in their forties when Putin was born, which leaves a gap of over fifteen years since the births of their previous sons, Oleg and Viktor, neither of whom survived childhood. Details of the first ten years of Putin's life are scarce in his autobiography, especially when compared with other world leaders.\" Putina lives in the village of Metekhi, about 18 kilometers from Gori, Georgia. Putina says that Putin's father is a Russian mechanic, Platon Privalov, who got Vera pregnant while he was married to another woman. A \"Vladmir Putin\" was registered at Metekhi school in 1959-1960. Records show that his stated nationality is Georgian. Putina married a Georgian soldier Giorgi Osepahvili. Her husband pressured her to abandon Putin. In December 1960 she delivered \"Vova\" back to his grandparents in Russia. Putina believes that the St. Petersburg-based \"parents\" referred to in Putin's official biography adopted her son from his grandparents. Through her contacts, she learned that Putin had become a KGB officer. In 1999 she spotted Putin in television.Putina says that Russian and Georgian people visited her village to pressure her to remain silent. A school teacher, who says she taught Putin, stated that she too had been threatened. Putina says she is ready to do DNA tests. Russian journalist Artyom Borovik's plane crash coincided with the documentary he was making about Putin's childhood, including a report about Vera Putina. Italian journalist Antonio Russo was reportedly also interested in Vera Putina before he was murdered."

  "text" : "Vyacheslav Yakovlevich Shishkov (Russian: Вячесла́в Я́ковлевич Шишко́в) (October 3 [O.S. September 21] 1873—March 6, 1945) was a Soviet and Russian writer known for his descriptions of Siberia. He was awarded the Stalin Prize posthumously (1946). Shishkov was born in Bezhetsk in the Tver Governorate of the Russian Empire into a merchant family. In 1891 he graduated from the Vyshny Volochyok Civil Engineering College (Vyshnevolotskoe uchilishche konduktorov putei soobshcheniya). After working for short periods in Novgorod and Vologda governorates, in 1894 he came to work for the Tomsk District department of waterways. He participated in geodetic expeditions and from 1903 was a supervisor of many of them, studying the Ob, Yenisei, Chulym, Charysh, Lena, Vitim, and other Siberian rivers; of particular importance for him, both as an engineer and as a writer, was his work on the Biya River and on the route of the future Chuya highway. His first publication was the story \"Cedar\" (1908) in Siberian Life (Tomsk); following this, he published a number of travel essays and short stories. He began an active literary career in 1913 and moved to Petrograd in 1915, where he became friends with Maxim Gorky. In 1916 with Gorky's assistance he published his first collection of short stories, Sibirskii skaz (\"Siberian skaz\"). After the October Revolution, about which he felt apprehension, he spent some time wandering around Russia (in the Luga district, Smolensk, Kostroma, and Crimea). He visited the city of Ostashkov, where he began work on his novel Ugryum-reka (\"Ugryum River\" or \"Grim River\"), a historical novel about wealthy Siberian merchants at the turn of the century which was published in two volumes in 1933. His first novel to be published, however, was Vataga (\"The gang,\" 1923). From 1927 he lived in Detskoye Selo. For the last seven years of his life he worked on the historical epic Yemelyan Pugachev (Russian: Емельян Пугачёв), \"a colorful panorama of the 18th-century Cossack and peasant uprising,\" whose first volume he published in 1941 while he was living in blockaded Leningrad; it was published (unfinished) in three volumes after his death and won him the Stalin Prize. He left Leningrad in April 1942 and his seventieth birthday was celebrated in Moscow in October 1943; on this occasion he was awarded the Order of Lenin. After his death in 1945 he was buried in Moscow at the Novodevichy Cemetery (site number 2). In 1950 a monument to him was unveiled in Bezhetsk, and in 1973 a museum dedicated to him was opened there. Biographies and critical works have been written by V. Bakhmetev (1947), A. Bogdanova (1953), I. Izotov (1956), V. Chalmayev (1969), N. Yeselev (1976), and N. Yanovsky (1984). D. S. Mirsky wrote of him, \"Vyacheslav Shishkov, a Siberian, is notable for his good Russian, a worthy pupil of Remizov and Prishvin.\""

The program was produced in Garden Grove, California and was aired on several stations, including KXMX in Anaheim, weekdays from 6pm to 6am and all day in Saturdays and Sunday. Vo's program was taken off the air when he decided to enter the California gubernatorial recall election as a Republican in 2003. Campaigning mostly near his home of Garden Grove (but also taking trips to San Francisco and San Jose), Vo received 7,226 votes (with 48% of the votes cast for him coming from Orange County), good enough for 13th place. Vo has since relocated to Las Vegas and his radio program is now available on the internet."

Arrigoni maintained a website, Guerrilla Radio, and published a book of his experiences in Gaza during the 2008–09 Gaza War between Hamas and Israel. Arrigoni was the first foreigner kidnapped in Gaza since BBC journalist Alan Johnston's abduction in 2007. The murder was condemned by various Palestinian factions. A Hamas court in Gaza convicted four Salafist extremists on charges of kidnapping and murdering Arrigoni in September 2012. Mahmoud al-Salfiti, 28, and Tamer al-Hasasna, 27, were sentenced to life imprisonment, with hard labour. On 19 February 2013 a Gaza military court reduced the sentences of the two from life to 15 years. \"We asked in our appeal for the conviction for murder and abduction to be dropped to only abduction,\" their lawyer Mohammed Zaqut said. 24-year-old Khader Jram was given a 10-year sentence. Amer Abu Ghouleh, 23, was given a prison term of one year for sheltering fugitives."

After some time spent in a reformatory as a teenager, he learned wood carving and won competitions as a marathon dancer in the 1930s. He was convicted of armed robbery in 1938, but was released in 1942 and joined the US Merchant Marine. Around 1946, he moved to Los Angeles where, by the early 1960s, he had set up home on Beverly Boulevard. There he established an art studio where he \"made a living of sorts by giving clay modeling lessons to Beverly Hills matrons who found the atmosphere in his studio exciting,\" and also ran dance classes. He married in 1961; his wife, Szou (b. Sueanne C. Shaffer, 1943) established a clothing boutique which was credited with being one of the first to introduce \"hippie\" fashions. By about 1963, Vito, Szou, and their friend Carl Franzoni (b. 1934 in Cincinnati, Ohio), also known at the time as \"Captain Fuck\", had begun going to clubs with a growing group of self-styled \"freaks\", who reputedly \"lived a semi-communal life and engaged in sex orgies and free-form dancing whenever they could\". According to writer Johnny Rogan, Paulekas' \"free thinking lifestyle and artistic passion inspired beatniks, aspiring existentialists and Valley girls in need of rebellion.\" In 1964, Paulekas offered rehearsal space to the Byrds, and the following year the troupe of free-form dancers, with Paulekas and Franzoni, accompanied the group on their nationwide tour. Later, Arthur Lee and Love also used his premises for rehearsals. In some clubs, Paulekas and the dancers became as big an attraction as the onstage entertainment. The troupe - including several of the young women later to become known as The GTOs, and members of the Fraternity of Man - occupied the Log Cabin in Laurel Canyon formerly occupied by Tom Mix and later by Frank Zappa. Credited as \"Vito and the Hands\", Paulekas recorded a single, \"Where It's At,\" which featured some of the Mothers of Invention, with producer Kim Fowley in 1966. He has been credited with first using the terms \"freak\" and \"freak-out\" to describe the scene, and with Franzoni and other members of the troupe contributed to the first album by Zappa and the Mothers, Freak Out!. He appeared in several documentaries of the period, including Mondo Hollywood (1967) and You Are What You Eat (1968). After Richard Nixon's election as US President in 1968, he moved to Haiti and later Jamaica, before returning to settle in Cotati, California. There, he and Franzoni established the Freestore street theatre and performance group, and built a bandstand for the town as well as contributing sculptures. He and Szou divorced in 1975. They had four children, at least one of whom, Godo, died as a child. Paulekas died in Cotati in 1992, aged 79."

He sided with the Social Democratic Left Party (later Communist Party) in the split of the Social Democratic Labour Party. Herou received communist political training in Soviet Russia. He was elected to parliament in the 1921 election, being one of seven deputies of the first Communist Party parliamentary faction. He was again elected to parliament in 1928, 1932 and 1936. When the Communist Party was divided in October 1929, Herou sided with the dissident Communist Party (later renamed Socialist Party) led by Karl Kilbom and Nils Flyg. When the Socialist Party parliamentary group was divided over a parliamentary motion on the Spanish Civil War (a debate in which the majority of the parliamentarians with Kilbom at their helm implied that Flyg had adopted a too ambivalent position towards the defense of the Spanish Republic), Herou took a neutralist position. Albeit not explicitly supporting Flyg's line, Herou positioned himself closer to Flyg than Kilbom's group. In 1940 Herou broke with the Socialist Party and joined the Farmers' League (later renamed as the Centre Party). Herou became a prominent local politician in Österfärnebo, being active in municipal politics until 1952. In 1964 he became the interim chairman of the newly founded Österfärnebo branch of the Swedish National Pensioners' Organisation (PRO)."

  "text" : "Violet \"Vi\" Cowden (October 1, 1916 – April 10, 2011) was an American aviator who served as a member of the Women Airforce Service Pilots (WASP) during World War II. Cowden was one of the surviving members of the 1,074 WASPs, who were the first women to fly American military planes. Cowden was born Violet Thurn and raised on a farm in Bowdle South Dakota. She taught first grade students in Spearfish, South Dakota. Cowden was issued her pilot's license before the United States entered World War II. She initially enlisted in the a volunteer women's emergency service program following the Attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941. However, before her basic training began, Cowden joined another all women's program created by Jacqueline Cochran and General Hap Arnold through the Army Air Corps, which came to be called the Women Airforce Service Pilots, or WASP. However, Cowden who weighed only 92 pounds and stood at just 5-feet-2-inches tall at the time, was too short and too light to join the WASPs. To quickly gain weight she ate bananas and drank milk and to make herself taller she tied a wrap in her hair. She successfully gained the eight additional pounds and two inches needed to enlist. Cowden was commissioned as a member of the WASPs in March 1943. She successfully flew her first solo flight on March 5, 1943. The WASPs, including Cowden, became the first women in US history to pilot American military planes. Cowden and other members of WASP did not see combat during World War II. Their mission was to fly military planes from domestic military factories to training sites or military bases in the United States. Cowden became one of only 114 WASP to fly the fighter planes during the war, including the P-47 Thunderbolt, P-39 AiraCobra, P-63 Kingcobra, and her favorite and the \"love of her life,\" the P-51 Mustang. Cowden, a long-time resident of Huntington Beach, California, remained very active in community affairs throughout her life. She served as the Grand Marshal of Huntington Beach's Independence Day parade. Cowden was also a member of the board of directors for the Bolsa Chica Land Trust and participated in the city's Veterans Day celebration and beach restorations. She participated in \"Living History\" in which World War II veterans gave speeches and presentations at high schools in southern California. and was on the Board of Directors at the Yanks Air Museum in Chino, California where they display many of the fighter planes that she flew during World War II and now display her WASP uniform. Cowden was awarded the Congressional Gold Medal in 2010, as one of only 300 surviving members of the Women Airforce Service Pilots. Supporters had lobbied for the recognition for WASP for more than a decade. She was also the subject of the 2010 independent film, Wings of Silver: The Vi Cowden Story, directed by Mark & Christine Bonn. Among the 10 awards that her film won was the Audience Award for short films at the Newport Beach Film Festival in 2010. (in less than a year it won 5 Audience Awards and 5 Best Documentary Short awards from film festivals around North America). Cowden went skydiving with the elite Army Golden Knights when she was 89 years old. On her 90th birthday she decided to go paragliding. In 2010, Cowden took part in an aerial mock dogfight over Fullerton Municipal Airport in Orange County, California. And in 2009 she again flew in the Collings Foundation P-51c Mustang, co-piloting and taking the stick for take off, landing & some fast flying in between. Violet Cowden died at 8:34 p.m. on April 10, 2011, at Hoag Memorial Hospital Presbyterian in Newport Beach, California, at the age of 94."

  "text" : "Vitaly Viktorovich Peskov (Russian: Вита́лий Ви́кторович Песко́в, May 12, 1944–March 12, 2002) was a Russian cartoonist who also worked as an illustrator and an animation director. In all, Peskov authored about 15,000 cartoons. His first cartoon was published in Smena in 1967, after which he was invited to the Literaturnaya Gazeta. In the following years, he worked for a variety of other publications. However, Peskov's cartoons never had an official support by the Soviet authorities, and unlike with other well-known artists, no exhibition of Peskov's works had ever been organized during his life. After Peskov's death in 2002, his apartment was looted and his wife Irina Korshikova with her son received numerous threats and emigrated to the United States soon after. One month after Peskov's death, an exhibition of three hundred cartoons was organized by Leonid Tishov in his private gallery in Moscow. The questions of how Tishkov got a hold of the stolen cartoons and where the remaining drawings and other property are was never answered. His widow Irina Korshikova, who emigrated to the United States with the copies of 3,000 of Peskov's drawings, later created a commemorative website and published his biography To Vitaly from Irina (Mir Collection NY, 2007, ISBN 1-893552-50-0; available at ). In the meanwhile, the threats and harassment against the artist's family continued. Three hundred drawings re-appeared in Moscow in various publications and at exhibitions attended by Russian artists and senior officials of the Moscow Government and the Ministry of Culture. Even though a criminal case was opened, it was stalled, allegedly due to corruption. In relation to this, Viktor Korshikov, a musical critic and writer and an author of various articles on the history of opera, committed suicide. No arrests have ever been made."

His work also appeared in the Gasonevski Exhibition in Leningrad in 1975; and many other important showings.Due to political pressure, Klever had to show his paintings in many underground art galleries and home exhibitions. The 300 paintings he made as part of his “Freedom Search” series gained much popularity due to their anti-government sentiment and biblical themes; which gave Klever notoriety with the KGB. For 4 years, Klever and his family faced heavy persecution. Klever lost his Soviet citizenship in 1978 and moved to America by way of Austria, Germany, and France. He continued to work and exhibit his paintings in all the aforementioned countries. He currently resides in America and continues to paint."

He also served on the Constitutional and Public Law, Economic Affairs, and Finance committees. In 1989, Cushwa joined several other senators in a filibuster to block an abortion-rights bill, which eventually fell one vote shy of passing. Gov. William Donald Schaefer appointed Cushwa to a five-year term on the state's utility-regulating Public Service Commission in July 1990 after Cushwa resigned from his state Senate seat. About a year after his appointment, Victor Cushwa died from lung cancer at Washington County Hospital in Hagerstown at the age of 66; he continued his duties on the commission until shortly before his death. Born in Hagerstown, Cushwa served in the Navy in the Pacific during World War II. He graduated from Georgetown University in 1948, and later served for 20 years as production manager of the Cushwa Brick Co. in Williamsport. The Victor Cushwa Memorial Bridge at Sideling Hill in Western Maryland is named in his honor."

Students from the Catholic Education in the Diocese of Parramatta were involved in the installation. He was born in Gia-Kiem, Vietnam. He studied at the diocesan minor seminary. He and his family came to Australia in a refugee boat in 1981. In 1983, Nguyen became a Conventual Franciscan friar and studied for the priesthood in Melbourne. After his priestly ordination on 30 December 1989 by George Pell, he went to Rome for further studies and was awarded a licentiate in Christology and spirituality from the Pontifical Faculty of St Bonaventure. He served as a parish priest for four years in Kellyville, New South Wales, and for seven years in Springvale. He was elected superior of the Order of Friars Minor Conventuals in Australia in 2005. Since 2008, he has been in Rome serving as Assistant General, responsible for the Asia-Oceania section of order. Pope Benedict XVI appointed him as an auxiliary bishop in the archdiocese in May 2011. Four thousand people packed St Patrick's Cathedral, Melbourne, on 23 June for his episcopal consecration. Archbishop Denis Hart, Archbishop of Melbourne, was the principal consecrator and Archbishop Giuseppe Lazzarotto, Apostolic Nuncio, and Cardinal George Pell, Archbishop of Sydney, were co-consecrators."

  "text" : "Victor Vlad Delamarina (August 31, 1870 – May 15 [O.S. May 3] 1896) was an Austro-Hungarian-born Romanian poet. Born in Satu Mic (today called Victor Vlad Delamarina) near Lugoj in the Banat, he attended primary school taught in Hungarian and German, followed by gymnasium in Lugoj. Moving to the Romanian Old Kingdom, he went to Saint Sava National College in Bucharest, to the military high schools in Craiova and Iaşi, and to the Higher Military School in Bucharest for two years, becoming a Second Lieutenant in the Romanian Naval Forces. Commissioned to the brig Mircea, during the summer of 1891 he sailed on the Constanţa-Istanbul-Chios-Rhodes-Piraeus-Thessaloniki-Constanţa route. He chronicled the journey in Călătoria bricului Mircea (\"The Voyage of the Brig Mircea\"), published later that year. He also participated in tours on the protected cruiser NMS Elisabeta on the Black Sea, the Mediterranean and the Adriatic. Delamarina began writing as a schoolboy. Travel recollections of his appeared in Familia in 1893, and the following year, Valeriu Branişte published his poems in the Timişoara journal Dreptatea. By virtue of these poems' being written in the Banat subdialect of Romanian, Delamarina introduced a new trend in Romanian poetry: the use of written subdialect. A number of literary historians underlined the importance of his contribution, including Titu Maiorescu, Ilarie Chendi, I. D. Suciu, Gabriel Țepelea, George Muntean, Al. Bistrițeanu and Virgil Vintilescu. The latter published a study of his life and work in 1967. He died in 1896, aged 25, in Petroasa Mare village near his birthplace, and was buried in Lugoj."
