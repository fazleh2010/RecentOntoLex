  "text" : "John Wesley \"Wes\" Joice (October 22, 1931 – June 6, 1997)  was the owner of the Greenwich Village's literary hangout, The Lion's Head (also called The Head), which he first opened in 1966 at 59 Christopher Street. A former minor league baseball player, policeman and P.J. Clarke's bartender, the establishment attracted writers and editors who spread the word. Joice filed for bankruptcy in 1994. The The Lion's Head closed two years later, in 1996, due to rising rents. The place became legendary as the location where: \n*  Lanford Wilson had scribbled a play on a napkin \n*  Rod Steiger picked up his mail \n*  Norman Mailer had planned his 1969 campaign for Mayor \n*  Pete Hamill had reportedly talked Robert F. Kennedy into running for the Senate  \n*  Jessica Lange was once the second prettiest waitress on her shift"

  "text" : "William James Waterhouse (15 August 1917 – 22 November 2003) was a Canadian violinist and music educator. At the age of 4 he began studying the violin with his father, John Waterhouse, and music theory with the composer and conductor Bernard Naylor. While a teenager he entered the Royal Academy of Music (RAM) in London where he was a pupil of Michael Head and Rowsby Woof. He earned a L.A.B. diploma from the RAM in 1933 and was later awarded an honorary doctorate from the school in 1976. He remained in London throughout the 1930s, playing as a member of the Boyd Neel Orchestra (1936-1939), the London String Orchestra (1936-1939), the Silverman Quartet (1935-1938), and the Stornoway Players (1937-1939). In 1939 Waterhouse returned to Canada, notably appearing as a soloist with the Montreal Symphony Orchestra during several concerts in the 1939-1940 season. In the early 1940s he was heard as a soloist with several orchestras in Canada and the United States, including performing Johannes Brahms's Double Concerto in partnership with Martin Hoherman with both the Boston Pops Orchestra and the CBC Winnipeg Orchestra. In 1946 he began pursuing further studies at Boston University where he graduated with both a Bachelor of Music and a Master of Music in 1950. From 1951-1975 he was a member of the Boston Symphony Orchestra and from 1975 until his retirement in 1987 he was principal second violin of the Boston Pops Orchestra. He concurrently played in the Winnipeg Symphony Orchestra from 1975-1987 and was also actively performing in duo concerts with the pianist Leonard Isaacs during those years."

Peterson's, formed the basis of what is now considered the \"Cadillac style\". Ramey primarily carved decoys for himself and some friends. His output was very limited and therefore his pieces are considered fairly rare, even in highly used condition.

  "text" : "William Robinson \"W. R. \" Brown (January 17, 1875 – August 4, 1955) was an American corporate officer of the Brown Company of Berlin, New Hampshire. He was also an influential Arabian horse breeder, the founder and owner of the Maynesboro Stud, and an authority on Arabian horses. After graduating from Williams College, Brown joined the family corporation, then known as the Berlin Mills Company, and became manager of the Woods Products Division, overseeing the company's woodlands and logging operations. He became an early advocate for sustainable forest management practices, was a member of the New Hampshire Forestry Commission from 1909 until 1952, and served on the boards of several forestry organizations. As chair of the Forestry Commission, Brown helped send sawmills to Europe during World War I to assist the war effort. He was influenced by the Progressive movement, instituting employee benefits such as company-sponsored care for injured workers that predated modern workers' compensation laws. As a Republican, he served as a presidential elector for New Hampshire in 1924. Brown founded the Maynesboro Stud in 1912 with foundation bloodstock from some of the most notable American breeders of Arabian horses. He looked abroad for additional horses, particularly from the Crabbet Arabian Stud, and imported Arabian horses from England, France and Egypt. At its peak, Maynesboro was the largest Arabian horse breeding operation in the United States. In 1929, he wrote The Horse of the Desert, still considered an authoritative work on the Arabian breed. He served as President of the Arabian Horse Club of America from 1918 until 1939. Brown was a remount agent and had a special interest in promoting the use of Arabian horses by the U.S. Army Remount Service. To prove the abilities of Arabians, he organized and participated in a number of endurance races of up to 300 miles (480 km), which his horses won three times, retiring the U.S. Mounted Service Cup. This accomplishment occurred even though The Jockey Club donated $50,000 to the U.S. Army to buy Thoroughbreds that tried but failed to beat the Arabians. Brown's legacy as a horse breeder was significant. Today, the term \"CMK\", meaning \"Crabbet/Maynesboro/Kellogg\" is a label for specific lines of \"Domestic\" or \"American-bred\" Arabian horses, many of which descend from Brown's breeding program. In 2012, the Berlin and Coös County Historical Society held a 100th anniversary celebration of the stud's founding. Although Brown family members sold personal assets to keep the Brown Company afloat during the Great Depression, including Brown's dispersal of his herd of Arabian horses in 1933, the business went into receivership in 1934. Brown remained in charge of the Woods Division through the company's second bankruptcy filing in 1941. He retired from the company in 1943 and died of cancer in 1955. His final book, Our Forest Heritage, was published posthumously, and his innovations in forest management became industry standards."

Dr Hoskyns died on 19 February 2015. The 17th Bt carries and uses the name Wren that derives from the name of the son of the 7th Bt. who married Theodosia, the great-granddaughter of the famous English architect and polymath, Sir Christopher Wren. Theodosia was her father's only child, and married Chandos Wren-Hoskyns on 20 April 1837 after Chandos Hoskyns had his name changed in the previous week by Royal Licence. They had one daughter, who died without marrying. The Hoskyns family continued to use Wren and Chandos in other branches in subsequent generations to keep the names alive. The Harewood Park estate was in the family until 1941, and since 2000 has been owned by the Duchy of Cornwall. Media speculation is that the impending development of the estate is as a country residence for The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge."

  "text" : "William Cochran (1738–1785) was a Scottish painter. Cochran was born at Strathearn in Clydesdale, and received his first instruction at the Academy of Painting at Glasgow, founded by the two celebrated printers, Robert and Andrew Foulis. About 1761 he went to Italy and studied under Gavin Hamilton, and on his return to Glasgow about 1766 he practised portrait painting both in oil and miniature. Some pieces from fable, executed by him when at Rome, are to be found in Glasgow. He was a modest artist, and never exhibited his works, nor put his name to them. He died at Glasgow in 1785, and was buried in the cathedral, where a monument was erected to his memory."

  "text" : "Wilhelm \"Wilhelmi\" Malmivaara (until 1900 Malmberg, 13 February 1854, Lapua – 12 January 1922, Lapua) was one of the leaders of Finnish Awakening in the beginning of the 20th century. He was a member of the synod of the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland in 1898, 1908, 1913 and 1918 and was also a representative of the clergy in the pre-independence Diet of Finland in 1897, 1899, 1900 and 1904–05 and a member of the Parliament of Finland in 1907–1914 (Finnish Party) and 1917–1919 (National Coalition Party). Malmivaara was the son of Finnish Awakening movement leader Nils Gustav Malmberg and Helena Jaakontytär Huhtala. He worked together with Mauno Rosendal and Juho Malkamäki as a leader of the awakening movement and as a vicar (leading pastor) of Lapua parish in 1900-1922. Before that he was an assistant pastor in Kiuruvesi (1879–92) and vicar of Paavola (1892–1900). Malmivaara and Malkamäki's work resulted in awakenings in many places in southern Ostrobothnia and the movement entered a new revival period. In 1914 the first folk high school associated with the Awakening started at Karhunmäki in Lapua. Malmivaara is a notable Finnish hymnwriter who renewed the hymnal of Finnish Awakening Siionin virret. Seven of his texts are included in the hymnal and three of his texts are used in the  hymnal of the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland. He also carried out the renewal of the hymnal originally composed by Finnish pastor and revivalist preacher Antti Achrenius. In 1888 Malmivaara founded the periodical of the Finnish Awakening, Hengellinen Kuukauslehti. As a preacher, Malmivaara was equal to his father and had a particular capability to touch the hearts of his listeners. His sermons were published posthumously in a two-volume collection, Viestejä vaivatuille (1927–33), which remains one of the most remarkable achievements in Finland in the field of published sermon literature. On the question of alcohol Malmivaara was an absolute prohibitionist and introduced that position into Finnish Awakening. Malmivaara married Karin Rajander. The couple had many children, and several of their sons became pastors. Malmivaara's descendants are still represented in the Finnish clergy."

  "text" : "William Felton (1715 – 6 December 1769) was an English composer. William Felton was born in Market Drayton, Shropshire. He was educated in Manchester and at St. John's, Cambridge, where he graduated B.A. in 1738 and M.A. in 1745. He was vicar-choral in the choir of Hereford in 1741, custos of the vicars-choral in 1769, and chaplain to the Princess Dowager of Wales (Augusta of Saxe-Gotha). During a time when, according to Charles Burney, players of the harpsichord had little choice of good music; several of Felton's three sets of six concertos for organ or harpsichord and of his eight suites of easy lessons became the \"pride of every incipient player in town and country.\" Felton's gavotte, attained great popularity; it was introduced in Vincenzo Ciampi's opera Bertoldo in 1672. However, it \"was too common and vulgar for an opera audience\". His concertos were modelled on those of Handel, whom the amateur held in admiration. Burney relates that Handel was asked, while in the barber's hands, to allow the mention of his name in the list of subscribers to Felton's Second Set. He started up in a fury, and, with his face still in a lather, cried with great vehemence: \"Tamn yourseluf and go to der teiffel—a barson make concerto! why he no make sarmon!\" and Brown, the leader of the queen's band, who had had the temerity to prefer the modest request, fled from Handel's presence. No record, in fact, appears of sermons by the composer Felton, but, besides writing for the harpsichord and other instruments, on which he was a skilled performer, he is said to have composed the glee \"Fill, fill, fill the glass,\" and to have acted as steward at the Three Choir Festivals of Hereford, 1744, and Gloucester, 1745. He died 6 December 1769, and was buried in Hereford Cathedral."

In 1875 O-Ti-Cot-i was baptized a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) by George Washington Hill at which time he ended his involvement as a shaman. O-Ti-Cot-i was later one of those who assisted in the construction of the Logan Temple. He had a farm near Elwood, Utah and a residence in the town of Washakie, Utah. Willie Ottogary attended the day school in Washakie where he learned to write in English. He was baptized a member of the LDS Church at about age eight. In 1906 Ottogary began his journalistic career with a column in the Tremont Times. He later also had writings published in the Oneida County Enterprise of Malad City, Idaho, the Box Elder Journal and Box Elder News both of Brigham City, Utah and the Logan Journal of Logan, Utah. In 1907 Ottogary was ordained to the office of seventy in the LDS Church priesthood. He was sealed to his wife Nancy in the Logan Temple. He served a stake mission in 1913 during which he baptized around 100 Shoshone. Ottogary in general made his living as a farmer on the farm by Elwood his father had homesteaded. In 1915 and 1917 Ottogary went on trips to Washington, D.C. seeking to get a return of the lands given to the Shoshone in the Box Elder Treaty of 1863. In 1918 he was arrested for encouraging draft resistance during World War I."

He fought on the Royalist side in the English Civil War. Carnaby was the son of William Carnaby of Farnham and Langley Northumberland and his wife Mabel Carnaby, daughter of Cuthbert Carnaby of Halton Tower. He was aged 22 at the visitation of 1615. He was knighted at Welbeck Abbey in August 1619. He came into possession of his mother's property at Halton, and also acquired the estates of Hadston from Robert Brandling. In 1624 Carnaby was elected Member of Parliament for Morpeth. He was elected MP for Northumberland in 1628 and sat until 1629 when King Charles decided to rule without parliament for eleven years. He was a close friend of the Cavendish family and managed the estates of the Earl of Northumberland from 1634 to 1638. He was High Sheriff of Northumberland in 1635. In April 1640, Carnaby was elected Member of Parliament for Marlborough in the Short Parliament. He was elected MP for Morpeth again for the Long Parliament in November 1640. He raised forces for the King and was accordingly disabled from attending parliament on 26 August 1642. He was Treasurer of the Army and fought in the Northumberland Regiment, commanded by the Marquess of Newcastle at the Battle of Marston Moor. Following defeat in the battle he accompanied the Marquess, the marquess's sons Charles Viscount Mansfield and Henry Lord Cavendish, the marquess's brother Sir Charles Cavendish, Dr. Bramhall Bishop of Londonderry, Lord Falconbridge, Lord Widdrington, the Earl of Elthyne and Lord Cornworth and was conducted by a troop of horse and dragoons from York to Scarborough. They set sail for Hamburg where they arrived on 8 July 1644. Carnaby married Jane Bindlosse daughter of Sir Robert Bindlosse."

Norborne married Mary Chivers, daughter of Henry Chivers of Quemerford and his wife Elizabeth Seacole of Milton, Oxfordshire. His son Walter was later MP for Calne until he was killed in a duel."

From 1921 to 1945 he was professor of sculptor at the Norwegian National Academy of Craft and Art Industry and had among others, Ørnulf Bast as a student. His most extensive work was the 34-meter high column originally titled Eidsvollsøylen, which in 1925 had won the competition sponsored by the Parliament of Norway for a monument on Eidsvolls plass in front of the Parliament building in memory of the Norwegian Constitution. Following a very controversial history, the 34 meter tall was re-titled Sagasøyla (Saga column) and was finally erected in the Bøverdalen valley in Lom municipality in the County of Oppland during 1992. Among his other works are busts of Norwegian architect Magnus Poulsson and of Norwegian poet Olav Aukrust at the National Gallery of Norway."

Dynes spent his early years in southern California, where he attended UCLA and received his B.A. in 1969. After extended sojourns in Italy and England, he settled permanently in Manhattan, New York City where he obtained his Ph.D. from the Institute of Fine Arts of New York University. The subject of his art-history dissertation was an eleventh-century illuminated Bible from Belgium. His training as a medievalist provided the basic core of his college teaching (first at Columbia, then at Hunter College). During the 1960s Dynes was a member of the Mattachine Society of New York (MSNY). He was in Europe at the time of the Stonewall Uprising in Greenwich Village in June 1969. After returning in 1973 he collaborated with Jack Stafford, a librarian, to work on one many bibliographies of gay studies. This interest ultimately yielded his volume Homosexuality: A Research Guide (1987), followed by his work as editor-in-chief of the two-volume Encyclopedia of Homosexuality (Garland, 1990)."

  "text" : "William Forsyth (1722–1800), was a Scottish merchant. Forsyth was born in 1722 at Cromarty, where his father, a native of Morayshire, had settled as a shopkeeper. He made good progress at the town school, then taught by David Macculloch, not only in the ordinary branches, but in the classics. Forsyth spent some time in a London counting-house, but, his father dying suddenly, he was called home, and had to take the place of head of the family at the early age of seventeen. Cromarty was then in a low state. The herring had deserted the coast, and there was no trade. Forsyth, however, saw that the old town had some special advantages. There was a fine harbour, and ready access to the surrounding districts, not only by the roads, but by the firths of Dornoch, Dingwall, and Inverness. He therefore formed the bold and original idea of making it a depôt of supplies for all the country round, and this plan he carried out with energy and success for many years. He brought flax and other commodities from Holland. He traded with Leith and London, and was the first to introduce coal (about 1770), called by the country people ‘black stones.’ On the suggestion of his old schoolfellow, Dr. Hossack of Greenwich, he started the manufacture of kelp. He also employed many of the people in their own homes in spinning and weaving in connection with the British Linen Company, of which he was the first agent in the north, and encouraged fishing and farming industries. For more than thirty years he was the only magistrate in the place, and such was the confidence in his judgment and integrity that during all that time no appeal was taken against any of his decisions. The general respect of the neighbourhood was shown by his popular title as ‘the maister.’ Forsyth not only did much to revive the old glory of the town, but helped many young men to make their way in the world; one of these was the well-known Charles Grant, chairman of the East India Company, and M.P. for Inverness. Forsyth died at Cromarty 30 January 1800. He was twice married, first to Margaret Russell, who died within a year in childbed, and next, after eleven years, to Elizabeth Grant, daughter of the Rev. Patrick Grant of Nigg, Ross-shire. He had nine children, three only surviving him. He and his family were large benefactors to Cromarty. Hugh Miller, himself a native of Cromarty, says: ‘He was one of nature's noblemen; and the sincere homage of the better feelings is an honour reserved exclusively to the order to which he belonged.’ He also says of the inscription on his gravestone in Cromarty churchyard, that its ‘rare merit is to be at once highly eulogistic and strictly true.’"

  "text" : "William Fowler (12 March 1761 – 22 September 1832) was an English artist. Fowler was born at Winterton, Lincolnshire. His father was Joseph Fowler, a builder at \"The Chains\" in West Street. Fowler became an architect and builder at Winterton, and about 1796 made drawings of Roman pavements discovered there. He took them to London to be engraved by his brother-in-law, Mr Hill. There he studied the process of copper-plate engraving, and in April 1799 brought out his own coloured engraving of a Roman pavement at Roxby. Between 1799 and 1829 he published three volumes of coloured engravings of twenty-five pavements, thirty-nine subjects from painted glass, five brasses and incised slabs, four fonts and eight miscellaneous subjects. He also created at least twenty-nine unpublished engravings, mostly of objects of antiquity. Many of the published plates were accompanied by printed broadsides. He became acquainted with Sir Walter Scott and other celebrities, and was presented on at least one occasion to the royal family at Windsor. Some of his work can be seen in North Lincolnshire Museum in Scunthorpe and Baysgarth House Museum in Barton-on-Humber. Sir Joseph Banks said of him: \"Others have shown us what they thought these remains ought to have been, but Fowler has shown us what they are, and that is what we want.\" According to the Dictionary of National Biography his works are distinguished by a strict fidelity especially remarkable at the time. Whenever it was possible he worked from tracings, rubbings, etc. It is claimed that he was the first to introduce the lead-lines in representations of painted glass. There is a characteristic portrait of him by W. Bond, from a painting by George Francis Joseph, A.R.A., dated 4 June 1810. Fowler, though a member of the Church of England, was also a ‘class-leader’ among the Methodists. He died 22 September 1832, and was buried at Winterton under a cruciform slab."

  "text" : "William Howard Glover (1819-1875), was an English musical composer and writer. Glover was the second son of Julia Glover, the actress, and said to be descended from the Bettertons. He was born at Kilburn, London, on 6 June 1819; entered the Lyceum Opera orchestra, conducted by his master, wagstaff, as violinist when fifteen; continued his studies on the continent, and was soon afterwards employed as accompanist and solo violinist in London and the provinces. He founded, in conjunction with his mother, the Musical and Dramatic Academy in Soho Square, and was encouraged by its success to open a season of opera at Manchester, his pupils forming the nucleus of the company. Glover was joined in this or similar enterprises by his elder brother Edmund and Miss Romer. Returning to London he gave annual monster concerts at St. James's Hall and Drury Lane Theatre. His pupils Miss Emily Soldene, Miss Palmer, and many first-rate artists appeared, the length of the entertainments inspiring more than one foreign critic with philosophic reflections upon the English amateur's capacity of endurance. To Glover belongs the credit of initiating the performance of Beethoven's 'Pastoral Symphony' with pictorial and choregraphic illustrations in 1863; and 'Israel in Egypt' with scenery, dresses, and poses, in 1865. His cantata, 'Tam o' Shanter,' for tenor solo, chorus, and orchestra, was produced at the New Philharmonic, Berlioz conducting, on 4 July 1855, and pleased so greatly by its pleasant melodies, local colouring, and lively effects, that it was given at the following Birmingham festival, 30 August 'Ruy Blas,' opera,written and composed by Glover, was produced on 24 Oct. 1861 at Covent Garden, and was successful enough for frequent repetition and a revival two years later: the comic opera, 'Once too Often,' was first performed at Drury Lane on 20 Jan. 1862, 'The Coquette' in the provinces, 'Aminta' at the Haymarket, and 'Palomita' in New York. The overtures 'Manfred' and 'Comala,' the songs, 'Old Woman of Berkeley,' 'Love's Philosophy,' 'The Wind's a Bird,' are only a few of his compositions, many of which were published in America. From about 1849 to 1865 Glover undertook the musical criticisms for the 'Morning Post;' in 1868 he settled in New York as professor and conductor of Niblo's orchestra, and he died there on 28 October 1875."

  "text" : "William Jesson (1580 – 1651) was an English dyer and politician who was active in local government in Coventry and sat in the House of Commons between 1640 and 1648. Jesson was the son of Richard Jesson of Coventry and his wife Elizabeth Hill. He became a wealthy dyer of Coventry and was admitted to the council 1628, becoming mayor of Coventry in 1631 and an alderman from 1634. In 1640 Jesson purchased the Warwickshire manor of Nuthurst from Edward Trussell and it remained in the family until around 1754. In April 1640, Jesson was elected Member of Parliament for Coventry in the Short Parliament. His uncle and fellow MP Simon Norton was also a dyer and together they helped defeat the aims of a Coventry weaver who petitioned Parliament against cloth from Gloucestershire being brought into the city for dyeing. Jesson was not elected immediately to the Long Parliament in November 1640 but was brought in after the death of Norton in 1641. In 1647 Jesson successfully brought in a vote in parliament to de-garrison Coventry which had been under army and committee domination in the Civil War. He was excluded in 1648 under Pride's Purge. Jesson married Elizabeth Barker, daughter of Alderman John Barker. Their eldest son William was also MP for Coventry in 1660. Their grandson was Sir William Jesson of Burleigh Hall, Loughborough."

He received his art training at the Lambeth School of Art, and evolved a style similar to that of Tom Browne and John Hassall. Owen was the son of a Royal Navy engineer, and received his first education at Sir Joseph Williamson's Mathematical School in Rochester. Before becoming a full-time illustrator, he worked at the Post Office Savings Bank where he met the writer W. W. Jacobs whose novels and short stories for The Strand Magazine he illustrated for many years. Owen himself wrote short stories, eventually joining the East Kent Mercury where he worked as a journalist. During the First World War he produced cartoons for the Illustrated Sporting and Dramatic News, introducing readers to new terms such as 'strafe', 'Blighty', 'pipsqueak' and 'brass'. Owen produced highly popular cartoons for the Bystander and The Sketch, and designed some posters for the Underground Group in 1926. His profusely illustrated guide, Old London Town, was published in New York by Robert M. McBride in 1922 and has been placed on the web by Project Gutenberg. His work was usually signed \"WO\" or \"WILL OWEN\" in a cartouche."

  "text" : "William Wayne Paul (1939–1989) was an American martial artist, educator, psychologist and social/political activist. Born in Nevada County, California, Bill Paul lived in three group homes and attended four high schools during adolescence. He began his study of judo with Richard Takemoto in Oakland, continuing with Mits Kimura at the San Francisco Judo Institute from 1957 and competing successfully in numerous judo tournaments during the later 1950s and early 1960s. Between 1962 and 1964 he worked as a bouncer at Pierre's Bar in San Francisco's North Beach area.Having spent time training in Japan, in late 1964 he was an alternate on the US Olympic judo team, and he captained the US team at the Pan American Games in Winnipeg during 1967. Thereafter he largely switched to the study of the Chinese martial arts, especially T'ai chi ch'uan. It was also during the late 1960s that Paul became politically active. A keen photographer, he documented clashes between police and student protesters during the unrest at the San Francisco State University and was later reported to have defended Vietnam War protesters from assaults by angry onlookers during peace marches in San Francisco. Although a self-avowed pacifist with regards to violence as an instrument of state policy, he was notably drawn to interpersonal conflicts and he continued to work as a bouncer at several gay bars in San Francisco. Paul received a Master's Degree from San Francisco State University in 1974 and then a Doctorate of Education degree from Harvard University. His thesis was on the use of humane, nonviolent self defense, especially for workers in psychiatric institutions; a development of the self defense methods that he had taught to university students, gay activists and women's rights groups. He continued to refine this system, which combined elements of Chinese martial arts and judo with conflict de-escalation and resolution techniques, for the remainder of his life, eventually producing a VHS video guide for instructors in the system. During the 1980s Paul became increasingly politically active as an advocate of gay rights. He was a member of the Stonewall Democrats and took part in numerous protests, including being instrumental in the November 27, 1985 protest that inspired the NAMES Project AIDS Memorial Quilt. He was also a vocal supporter of the Gay Games. He died in 1989 due to a brain tumor associated with HIV."

By 1923, his company was one of the strongest independent producers of oil and gasoline in the United States. He helped organize the first International Petroleum Exposition in Tulsa in 1923 and became president of that organization, a position he held for the rest of his life. He was a founder of the Kansas-Oklahoma branch of the United States Oil and Gas Association, then known as Mid-Continent Oil and Gas Association. Skelly became an active promoter as well of the aviation industry, though he was not a pilot himself. In 1926, he purchased the financially struggling Mid-Continent Aircraft Company and turned it into the successful Spartan Aircraft Company. In 1928, he led the fundraising to build the Tulsa Municipal Airport. In October 1928, he opened the Spartan School of Aeronautics. Skelly was active in other civic projects.

  "text" : "Sir William Farrington (fl. 1412), was an English soldier and diplomat. Farrington was from a well-known Lancashire family. He was knighted by the Duke of Lancaster before the battle of Nájera, 1366. During the decline of the English power in Aquitaine he there held several important military commands. He made an unsuccessful attempt to come to the assistance of the Earl of Pembroke in the sea-fight at La Rochelle. Having become governor at Saintes, he was in the fight at Soubise, where he narrowly escaped being made prisoner. Being obliged to abandon Saintes, he joined the forces under the command of Sir Thomas Felton, who went to relieve the town of Thouars, then besieged by the French. He subsequently joined the Duke of Buckingham, and distinguished himself during the campaign by several feats of arms. In 1376 he was named one of the guardians of the truce concluded with the French. The son of the Count Denia, one of the prisoners taken at the battle of Nájera, having managed to escape, Farrington was imprisoned with others in the Tower, as being therein guilty of negligence, and released by request of Henry Percy, earl of Northumberland, 1377. In 1381 he was charged by royal order to assist at a duel in the Scotch marches, fought between Sir John Chatto, a Scotch knight, and Sir William Badby. He seems to have taken part in the crusade led by the Bishop of Norwich to assert the supremacy of Pope Urban over Clement, both of whom were claimants to the papal chair at this period. According to Rymer he was obliged to pay into the treasury a fine of fourteen hundred francs in gold for having taken part in the quarrel. He was sent on a mission to Philip van Arteveld in Flanders. Having stopped at Calais, he there received and brought to England the news of the battle of Rossebeke, 1382, fought between the French and the Flemings, led by Van Arteveld, in which the latter were defeated and their leader slain. He was at the battle of Dunkirk, and was besieged in Bourbourg. He was also with the Duke of Lancaster in Galicia. He was sent by Richard II on a special mission to Portugal, and his name is mentioned in the charter of 4 June 1390 among the principal personages then at the Portuguese court. He was also sent by Henry IV, shortly after his accession, on a mission to Paris, where he was not very favourably received. In 1403 Henry IV gave him the command of the castle of Fronsac, on the Dordogne, near Livourne. In terms of a royal edict dated 19 Oct. 1404 he was charged with the direction of all the sea traffic between England and the neighbourhood of Bordeaux. His duty was to see that all English ships engaged in trading between the two countries were duly despatched with their crews. In 1409 the exercise of these functions led him into a dispute with Jean Bordin, chancellor of Guyenne. In 1412 he was commander of the castle of Bordeaux."

Upon the death of his brother, Count Adolf VIII of Berg, William succeeded as Count of Berg. Formerly serving as a monk, he was absolved of his religious vows by the pope in order to take the position. His tenure was notable due to increased and constant conflict with the Archbishop of Cologne. In 1300 he supported King Albert I of Germany against the Rhenish electors which further strengthened his position against the archbishop. During his life he started foundations for monasteries and churches, including those in Beyenburg (now part of Wuppertal) and Gräfrath. He was also served as the benefactor of the citizens of Hückeswagen. William married Irmgard of Cleves (?–11 May 1319), widow of Conrad I of Saffenburg and daughter of Dietrich VI, Count of Cleves. William and Irmgard are buried in the Berg family vault of the Altenberg Cathedral. As William had no children, his nephew Adolf IX of Berg, son of his brother Henry of Berg, Lord of Windeck succeeded him as Count of Berg."

In August 1942 the sitting Labour member of parliament for Poplar South died. The vacancy occurred at the height of the Second World War, and under an agreement between the parties forming the wartime coalition government, Guy was expected to take the seat at the ensuing by-election unopposed. In the event he was opposed by the Reverend Patrick Figgis running as a \"Christian Socialist\". The poll took place on 13 August, with a turnout of less than 10% of the electorate and Guy secured 3,375 votes to 541 for Figgis. Guy retained the seat at the 1945 general election, but retired from the Commons at the 1950 election, when the Poplar South constituency was abolished. He became a member of Poplar Borough Council, and was mayor of Poplar in 1953. He was a director of the Amalgamated Tobacco Corporation. He died in Poplar in August 1968."

The son of William Mills Ivins, Sr. (1851 – 1915), a public utility lawyer who had been the 1905 Republican candidate for Mayor of New York City, Ivins studied at Harvard College and the University of Munich before graduating in law from Columbia University in 1907. After nine years' legal practice, he was asked to take on the conservation and interpretation of the Met's print collection. He built up the remarkable collections that can be seen there today, and he wrote many prefaces to exhibition catalogues, as well as other, occasional pieces which were later collected and published. His best-known book is Prints and Visual Communication (MIT Press, 1969, ISBN 0-262-59002-6 (first published 1953 by Harvard University Press)), and his How Prints Look (1943, revised edition 1987) remains in print."

James III of Scotland made him a Lord of Parliament to gain his support against his rebels, who intended to make his son James, Duke of Rothesay King. The King left Edinburgh in March 1488, and joined Ruthven at Perth, and they travelled to Aberdeen. The first battle with the Prince's army was near Blackness Castle. The King was forced to negotiate with his rebels, and handed over Ruthven as a hostage. Ruthven may have chosen as a hostage because he was the rival of a rebel, Lord Oliphant, for the office of Sheriff of Perth. He remained a prisoner until the end of the conflict after the death of James III at the Battle of Sauchieburn, and was made to pay a ransom of £1000. He was invested as a Privy Counsellor of Scotland in August 1513, and after 1515 became one of the guardians of the boy King James V of Scotland. He was rumoured to have died sometime after July 1528."

Keasberry was \"brought up to the china business in London\", but took instead to \"the more alluring profession of the stage\". He joined the Edinburgh theatre in 1755, and from 1757 to 1795 was associated with the Orchard Street Theatre, Bath, as both actor and manager, taking over as manager in 1760. Outside Bath, he also acted in Bristol, London, and Richmond. In 1760, Keasberry and Richard Griffith established a temporary theatre at Winchester \"in consequence of a Camp consisting of eight regiments\". On 30 August 1773, at New Brentford, Middlesex, Keasberry married Henrietta Hamilton (1737–1812), a member of a family of actors. They had several children, William (1760–1797), John Palmer (1773–1840), Catherine Liddell (1763–1845), Henrietta (1768–1797), Julia Maria (1769–1849), and Henry Edward (1771–1847). At the time of his death, Keasberry was described in a brief obituary as \"Mr. William Keasbury, in his 71st year, formerly an actor, and late one of the joint patentees and managers of the Bath Theatre.\" He was buried at St Thomas à Becket's church, Widcombe, Bath."

  "text" : "Walter F. Fontaine  (1871–1938) was an American architect of French Heritage from Woonsocket, Rhode Island. Fontaine was born in Fitchburg, Massachusetts in 1871 to parents that had moved there from Woonsocket. When he was a young child, his family moved back to Woonsocket, where his father, John B. Fontaine (1836-1895) was a prominent building contractor. He was educated in the local schools, and began his architectural training in 1887 in the office of Willard Kent, a local architect.  After additional training in Europe in 1893, he worked for the Providence firm of Stone, Carpenter & Willson. Near the end of his time there, he was responsible for the construction supervision of that firm's Providence Public Library and Union Trust Co. Building. In 1901 he returned to Woonsocket where he opened his own office. Beginning in 1903, he worked with Elmer H. Kinnicutt as Fontaine & Kinnicutt. This association ended upon Kinnicutt's death in January of 1910. In 1921, his two sons, Oliver W. and Paul N. Fontaine began working for him. By this time Joseph M. Mosher was also associated with the office. In 1935, both sons became partners in the newly reorganized firm of Walter F. Fontaine & Sons. It remained as such until the elder Fontaine's death. After their father's death, his sons reorganized the firm as Walter F. Fontaine, Inc. It remained as such until 1942, when Paul left to participate in the war effort. In his brother's absence, Oliver opened his own office, which remained active into the 1970s. Fontaine was a member of the AIA and served for a time as Vice President of the Rhode Island chapter. He was also a member of the Rhode Island State Planning Board. Fontaine and his wife, Obeline Lucier Fontaine, died during the Hurricane of 1938 at their summer home in Charlestown, Rhode Island. Several of his buildings have been included in the National Register of Historic Places."

  "text" : "Despite his surname, William and his relatives appear in contemporary documents relating mainly to what is now the modern county of Cumbria, not Lancashire, especially Copeland in western Cumberland, Furness in the Lake District, The Barony of Kendal, which became part of Westmorland, and various areas such as Barton between Kendal and Ullswater, also in Westmorland. Much of this area was not yet permanently part of England. Although only part of this area was within the later English county of Lancaster or Lancashire, this entity had not yet come to be clearly defined. So the title of \"de Lancaster\", by which William is remembered, could have referred not only to the church city of Lancaster, to the south of this area, but to an area under its control. In 1900, William Farrer claimed that \"all of the southern half of Westmorland, not only the Kirkby Lonsdale Ward of Westmorland, but also the Kendal Ward, were linked with Northern Lancashire from a very early time\" and formed a single district for fiscal administrative purposes. The two apparently lost records which are said to have mentioned William's father Gilbert also apparently connected him to Cumbria, specifically to the area of Furness. The following are areas associated with him, for example ... Muncaster in Cumberland. According to William Farrer, in his 1902 edition of Lancashire Pipe Rolls and early charters,wrote: It appears that he was possessed of the lordship of Mulcaster (now Muncaster), over the Penningtons of Pennington in Furness, and under Robert de Romille, lord of Egremont and Skipton, who held it in right of his wife, Cecilia, daughter and heiress of William de Meschines. According to Farrer, this title would have been one of those granted by Roger de Mowbray, son of Nigel de Albini, having come into his hands after the decease without male heirs of Ivo de Taillebois. He also believed that this grant to William de Lancaster came to be annulled. Workington, Lamplugh and Middleton. The manors of Workington and Lamplugh in Cumberland were given by William de Lancaster, in exchange for Middleton in Westmorland, to an apparently close relative, Gospatric, son of Orme, brother-in-law of Waldeve, Lord of Allerdale. Hensingham. The Register of St Bees shows that both William son of Gilbert de Lancastre, and William's son William had land in this area. William's was at a place called Swartof or Suarthow, \"probably the rising ground between Whitehaven and Hensingham, known locally as Swartha Brow\". The appears to have come from his father Gilbert. His brother Roger apparently held land at Walton, just outside modern Hensingham, and had a son named Robert. Roger and William also named a brother called Robert. Ulverston. Farrer argued that this may have been held by William and perhaps his father Gilbert, before it was granted by Stephen, Count of Boulogne and Mortain, to Furness Abbey in 1127. The possible connection of William's father Gilbert to Furness will be discussed further below."

The \"sand dance\" that formed the highlight of their act was a parody of postures from Egyptian tomb paintings, combined with references to Arabic costume. The lithe and extremely lanky Wilson and Keppel, who wore long moustaches and make-up to emphasise the sharp angularity of their features and make them appear almost identical, demonstrated their impressive suppleness in adopting wild gestures and dancing in identical \"stereo\" movements, while Betty watched their antics. The dance itself was a soft-shoe routine performed on a layer of sand spread on the stage to create a rhythmic scratching with their shuffling feet. The act was usually performed to the familiar Egyptian Ballet (1875), by Alexandre Luigini."

Foster, sometimes referred to as Bill Foster (1884–1940), was a pioneering African-American film producer who was an influential figure in the Black film industry in the early 20th century, along with others such as Oscar Micheaux laying the groundwork for the modern black film industry. He was the first African American to found a film production company, establishing the Foster Photoplay Company in Chicago in 1910. Foster had a vision for the African-American community to portray themselves as they wanted to be seen, not as someone else depicted them. He was influenced by the black theater community and wanted to break the racial stereotyping of blacks in film. He was an actor and writer under the stage name Juli Jones, as well as an agent for numerous vaudeville stars. His film The Railroad Porter, released in 1912, is credited as being the world's first film with an entirely black cast and director.

  "text" : "William Thomas Larkin (March 31, 1923 – November 4, 2006) was the Roman Catholic bishop of the Roman Catholic Diocese of St. Petersburg, Florida. Born in Mount Morris, New York, Larkin was ordained to the priesthood on May 15, 1947. He later served as Vicar General of the Diocese of St. Petersburg and interim diocesan administrator, before being appointed the Second Bishop of St. Petersburg on April 17, 1979. He was ordained to the episcopate on May 27 by his former classmate, Pope John Paul II. Bishop Larkin was formally installed as the diocese's second bishop on June 28. A period of tremendous growth occurred during Bishop Larkin's tenure. Larkin's ambitious pastoral plan resulted in the establishment of fifteen new parishes and three new schools. Larkin expanded the outreach of the social ministries of the diocese, established a radio station (WBVM 90.5 FM), and further sought to keep pace with the population growth and economic expansion of the 1980s. On November 29, 1988, Larkin retired for health reasons. He died on November 4, 2006. Bishop Larkin Catholic School (Grades EC-3 through 8th) in Port Richey, Florida is named in his honor, as is the Bishop W. Thomas Larkin Pastoral Center in St. Petersburg which has housed the diocese's main offices since early 2000."

  "text" : "William Lawrence Saltonstall (May 14, 1927 – January 23, 2009), an American politician, was a member of the Massachusetts Senate from 1967 to 1979. He was a Republican and a resident of Manchester-by-the-Sea, Massachusetts. He led an unsuccessful campaign in 1969 to represent Massachusetts's 6th congressional district in the U.S. House of Representatives. Born in Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts, he was a member of the Saltonstall family, which had strong historical roots in Massachusetts. His father, Leverett Saltonstall (1892–1979), was a Massachusetts governor and a U.S. senator. While the Saltonstall men were known to join the U.S. Army, he instead enlisted the U.S. Navy on his eighteenth birthday. His first day of service was V-J Day in 1945. With World War II at its end, Saltonstall enrolled at Harvard College, from which he graduated in 1949. He later graduated from Harvard Business School. After working as a security analyst for seven years, Saltonstall worked at his father's U.S. Senate office in Washington, D.C. He returned to Massachusetts in 1966 where he ran for the state Senate. He won, and went on to represent the Third Essex district from 1967 to 1975 and the First Essex and Middlesex district from 1975 to 1979. One of his top priorities was bicycle safety. Saltonstall ran for the U.S. House in a 1969 special election to succeed the deceased William H. Bates from the 6th Massachusetts district, but lost to Democrat Michael J. Harrington. Saltonstall married Jane Chandler in 1953. They had three children, Abigail, Claire, and William, Jr. Claire was struck and killed by an automobile driver in 1974 while she was riding her bicycle. The Claire Saltonstall Bikeway from Boston's Emerald Necklace to Provincetown is named in her memory. On a Friday evening in January 2009, after returning home from dinner with his wife, Saltonstall died \"of an apparent heart attack or blood clot\"."

  "text" : "William Henry Stowe (1 January 1825 – 22 June 1855), scholar and journalist, eldest son of William and Mary Stowe, was born at Buckingham on 1 January 1825. After attending a school at Iffley, near Oxford, he spent six months at King Edward's School, Birmingham. Leaving at Easter 1840, he studied medicine for three years at Buckingham, but, finding the pursuit uncongenial, entered at Wadham College, Oxford, in January 1844. At Oxford he was intimately associated with George Granville Bradley (afterwards Dean of Westminster), John Conington, and other members of the Rugby set. In 1848 he was placed in the first class in the final classical school with Edward Parry (afterwards Bishop Suffragan of Dover) and William Stubbs (afterwards Bishop of Oxford). After occupying himself for two years in private tuition at Oxford, he began in 1851 a connection with The Times by contributing literary articles, among them a comparison of the characteristics of Thackeray and Dickens. In March 1852 he obtained an open fellowship at Oriel College, and afterwards entered at Lincoln's Inn. In May 1852 John Walter, the proprietor, gave him a permanent post on the staff of The Times. His work for the paper was mainly confined to literary subjects, although he wrote many leading articles on miscellaneous topics. His reviews of John William Kaye's History of the War in Afghanistan and of Dickens's David Copperfield were reissued in Essays from the Times (2nd ser. 1854), edited by Samuel Phillips. Other literary notices by him of interest were on Niebuhr's Letters (1853) and on The Mechanical Inventions of James Watt (1855). His obituary article on Lord Brougham appeared in The Times of 11 May 1868, thirteen years after Stowe's own death. In 1855 The Times organised a \"sick and wounded fund\" for the relief of the British army in the Crimea, and Stowe was selected to proceed to the east as the fund's almoner. He reached Constantinople (now Istanbul) before the end of February, and was soon at Scutari (now Üsküdar), whence he moved to Balaklava. There he visited the hospitals and camp, and reported on the defects of the sanitary situation. \"Others talked, Mr. Stowe acted,\" wrote Frances Margaret Taylor, the author of Eastern Hospitals and English Nurses (1857). On 16 March his first letter from the Crimea appeared in The Times, and described the Balaklava hospitals and the health of the army. Many further despatches on like subjects followed up to midsummer 1855. Two of Stowe's letters (Nos. 80 and 81) described the third bombardment of Sebastopol, and were included in The Times Crimean War correspondent William Howard Russell's The War (1855). But Stowe's health was unable to resist the fatigue and exposure to an unhealthy climate which were incident to his labours. He died of camp fever at Balaklava on 22 June 1855 and was buried in the cemetery there (see Illustrated London News, 22 November 1855). A cenotaph to his memory was erected by friends in the chapel of Oriel College. John Walter, in a leading article in The Times of 6 July 1855, recounted Stowe's experiences in the Crimea, and characterised his despatches as \"an astonishing effort of intellectual and descriptive talent.\""

Barringer Trophies, and numerous other awards and honors, including induction into the Soaring Hall of Fame in 1965. Scott flew various sailplanes more than 300,000 miles while twice winning the transcontinental Smirnoff Sailplane Derby race, the longest sailplane race in the world. On July 26, 1970, he and Ben Greene co-set the world distance record of 716.95 miles, both flying ASW-12 sailplanes."

He was born in Halifax, Nova Scotia and educated at Mount Allison University, McGill University, Harvard University (where he studied under Josiah Royce, about whose theory of knowledge he was later to write his doctoral dissertation), the University of Leipzig, and finally at the University of Göttingen (where he completed his doctoral studies under Edmund Husserl). Edith Stein was among his friends during his Göttingen period. During the First World War he was held in the civilian internment camp at Ruhleben, near Berlin, for more than three years. After the war he taught philosophy at the University of Toronto and at Harvard University, which he left in 1927 to pursue a career in business. In his latter years he focused his energies on historical research, much of which concerned the group of mid-18th-Century immigrants to Nova Scotia known as the \"Foreign Protestants\". His most notable publication was The \"Foreign Protestants\" and the Settlement of Nova Scotia, which was published by the University of Toronto Press in 1961; his Register of the Foreign Protestants of Nova Scotia was published some years after his death."

For relaxation he produced scores of beautifully carved walking sticks, which he presented free to the older townspeople. His mind roamed the entire mechanical firmament. He was a dreamer with the most practical of brains, who, even in his youth, foresaw the future by drawing tentative plans for a vertical take-off aero engine. ‘Wullie Gairden’ as he was known locally had six children, two sons and four daughters of which two sons William and John and daughter Mary joined the firm. As well as being a Master Joiner he was a genius for invention."

  "text" : "William Esdaile (6 February 1758 – 2 October 1837 in Clapham), was an English banker and print collector. Esdaile was the fourth son of Sir James Esdaile of Great Gains, Essex, lord mayor of London, by his second wife, Mary Mayor. He received a commercial education, and was placed as a clerk in the banking-house of Ladbrooke & Co. In or about 1780 Sir James Esdaile was induced by his son-in-law, Sir Benjamin Hammet, to found with him a new banking business, and on its formation William Esdaile transferred his services to the house of Esdaile, Hammet, & Co., 21 Lombard Street. Esdaile's son describes his appearance at work in a private journal: Last but not least in the welfare of the concern came W. Esdaile, the man of business; perched on a high stool he was to be seen intent on the movements of the machine; hardly regarding those who came into the partners' office he was absorbed in his task. He had neither talent nor inclination for conversation on general subjects, and he knew little or nothing of what was passing out of banking hours. The business prospered under his care, and, finding money at his command, Esdaile widened the scope of his tastes, and began to frequent sales of prints. His earlier purchases were sparing and cheap, but, distrusting his own judgment, he engaged a professional assistant, accompanied by whom he attended all the great auctions in London. Though prints formed the bulk of his collection, he also largely purchased, as opportunity offered, coins, china, books, and the general miscellanea of the sale-room. Towards the last few years of his life, when his mind was breaking up, he abandoned his usual caution, and spent on a large and sometimes reckless scale, greatly to the advantage of his collection, which was considered one of the most valuable in England. It was sold after his death, the sale extending over sixteen days. The chief attractions were the very complete set of Rembrandt etchings and Claude drawings, which Esdaile had bought on the dispersal of Sir Thomas Lawrence's collection, and a large selection from the best work of the early Italian engravers. In 1825, at the age of sixty-eight, Esdaile took his first trip abroad, visiting Italy, and was so pleased with the experiment that he repeated it two years later. In 1832, on returning to his home at Clapham from Dover, he was seized with a dangerous malarial fever. Though he recovered his health, he was never again able to attend to business or to manage his property. He neither read nor wrote, and spent the whole day in overlooking his collection of prints. He passed the winter of 1835–36 at Rome and Naples, but after his return his constitution began to gradually break up. He was confined to his bed for nine months, and, dying at Clapham, 2 October 1837, was buried in Bunhill Fields. The banking-house of Esdaile & Hammet had ceased to exist from the beginning of the year. Esdaile's portrait was painted by both Wilkie and Lawrence, and an engraving was made from another picture by George Sharples. He married Elizabeth, the only child of Edward Jeffries, treasurer of St. Thomas's Hospital, by whom he had two sons and four daughters. Their grandson, Edward Jeffries Esdaile, married, 27 September 1837, Ianthe Eliza Shelley, the daughter of Percy Bysshe Shelley and Harriet Westbrook."

A third baseman, Smith played from 1946 to 1962 and again in 1969. Though his statistical record is incomplete, it is known that he collected at least 1,755 hits in his career - with at least 342 being doubles, 43 being triples and 130 being home runs. In 1951, he had perhaps his best season when he hit .320 with 30 doubles, six triples, three home runs and 162 hits for the West Palm Beach Indians. He spent 1957 with the Miami Marlins of the International League, where he, Pancho Herrera, Mickey Micelotta, and Pancho Herrera were considered to be one of the best infields in the International League, with one writer saying, \"they make plays the Phillies couldn't make.\" In October 1957, he was purchased by the Philadelphia Phillies to be placed on their roster, however he never appeared in the major leagues with them. Smith began his managerial career in 1969 as skipper of the Miami Marlins, heading them until 1970. He then skippered the Miami Orioles until 1972. Each of the teams he managed in his first four seasons ended up becoming league champions. In 1973, Smith managed the Key West Conchs. He skippered the San Antonio Missions in 1974 and 1975. Though he did not manage in 1976, he returned in 1977, managing the Waterloo Indians. That year, he led them to the league finals, which they lost, and in 1978 he led them to the playoffs, though they did not get past the first round. From 1979 to 1981, he managed the Chattanooga Lookouts."

He founded the firm W. R. Holway and Associates in 1922. Holway was chief engineer for the Pensacola Dam, which created the Grand Lake o' the Cherokees on the Grand River (the lower Neosho River), in northeastern Oklahoma. Construction began in 1938 and was completed in 1940. At the time, this was the longest multiple-arch dam in the world. In 1952, W. R. Holway and Associates was the engineering firm that built Lake Eucha, which functions as additional storage and as a buffer for Lake Spavinaw."

  "text" : "Wei Sun Christianson was born on August 21, 1956 to an army officer father and doctor mother as part of the Frontier Generation from China's Cultural Revolution. She grew up in Beijing as the youngest of four daughters. Growing up, her mother would often sew clothes that were \"just a bit more stylish than what was generally available\", stimulating Christianson's early interests in fashion. Her parents believed strongly in a Western education, going as far as to spend a month's salary buying her a tape recorder so she could play English tapes. She took the Gao Kao in 1978 and was accepted by the prestigious Beijing Language and Culture University, with the intention of learning English and working as a translator for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. During college, she met visiting Columbia University professor Randle Edwards and was urged to set her goals higher, aiming to become a lawyer as it would be a more respected profession and highly atypical of women at the time. As she wanted to ultimately attend Columbia Law School, Edwards advised that she first attain a degree from a top liberal arts college in the U.S. in order to better her chances of acceptance. Christianson applied to dozen liberal arts colleges in the United States and was accepted to all of them. In 1983 she transferred to Amherst College and became its first student from mainland China following China's opening to the Western world in early 1980s. She graduated cum laude with a B.A. in political science in 1985. She immediately continued on to Columbia Law School, where she met her future husband Jon Christianson and received her J.D. degree in international law in 1989."

  "text" : "Willy Christian Simonsen (13 September 1913 – 4 December 2003) was a Norwegian engineer and business founder. He was born in Kristiania as a son of chemist Einar Simonsen (1867–1918) and Alice Sophia Andersen (1877–1969). He finished his secondary education at Hegdehaugen School in 1933, and graduated in electrical engineering from the Dresden University of Technology in 1938. He worked as an engineer for Elektrisk Bureau and Chr. Michelsen Institute. During the German occupation of Norway from 1940 he was involved in the Norwegian resistance movement where he cooperated with fellow engineers Odd Dahl and Helmer H. Dahl to wiretap German forces. This was discovered and Simonsen was arrested by Gestapo, but admitted to Ullevål Hospital from which he escaped. He fled to the United Kingdom, where he started working in the Radio Production Unit of the British War Office. He developed the shortwave radio \"Sweetheart\". He was hired as a technical consultant for the Norwegian High Command after the war. In 1947 he started the company Simonsen Radio in Oslo, and in 1957 the company Simonsen & Mustad followed in Horten. He received initial capital from Halfdan and John Mustad. The brand name Simrad became known in the communications business, and was leading in echo sounding equipment. He backed out of these companies in 1968 and started Simonsen Elektro (in Oslo) in 1970 and Simonsen Elektro Løkken (in Løkken Verk). These companies produced automatic cell phones, in the NMT 450 system, and were leading in the Norwegian market until the 1980s. Simonsen was decorated with the Defence Medal 1940–1945, the UK Defence Medal, the Haakon VII 70th Anniversary Medal and the Order of St. Olav, and has received the Reginald Fessenden Award. He died in December 2003."

He was baptised at Stratford on 8 December 1586. He matriculated at Christ Church, Oxford on 8 July 1603 aged 15. The Combe family had some connection with William Shakespeare. Combe's uncle another William Combe was High Sheriff and sold property to Shakespeare in 1602. Another uncle John Combe left Combe some land at Welcombe when he died in 1614. Combe immediately caused a local dispute when he tried to enclose some land at Welcombe. The council took action against Combe's enclosure, but Shakespeare gave some support to Combe. Combe was probably High Sheriff of Warwickshire in 1616. In April 1640, Combe was elected Member of Parliament for Warwickshire in the Short Parliament. He was elected MP for Warwickshire for the Long Parliament in November 1640, but his election was declared void in December 1640. Combe died at Stratford in January 1667 aged 80. Combe married Katharine Boughton, daughter of Edward Boughton. She died in 1662. They had one son and nine daughters."

  "text" : "William Pitt Byrne (c. 1806 – 6 or 8 April 1861) was a British newspaper editor and proprietor of The Morning Post. He graduated from Trinity College, Cambridge with a BA and M.A.. He was admitted to the Inner Temple in 1835 and called to the bar in 1839 but never practised law. His father Nicholas Byrne was his predecessor as editor and proprietor of the Morning Post, about whom there is little biographical information in the historical record. Nicholas Byrne took a strongly pro-Tory editorial stance, and his son was named after William Pitt the Younger. He was mysteriously attacked by a masked intruder around 1833 and never fully recovered, dying of his injuries about two years later. His mother was the Gothic novelist Charlotte Dacre, who had three children with Nicholas: William Pitt Byrne (born 1806), Charles (born 1807) and Mary (born 1809); however the children were not baptised until 1811 and Nicholas and Charlotte did not marry until 1 July 1815. William Pitt Byrne was baptised on 8 Jun 1811 at St. Paul's, Covent Garden. He married the writer Julia Clara Busk on 28 April 1842. Her books were sometimes attributed to \"Mrs. William Pitt Byrne\", and for this reason some sources (particularly online book sellers) mistakenly attribute authorship of her books to her husband. He broadened the focus of the Morning Post from being a mostly political journal by including more general topics. He ended his connection with the paper prior to his death to follow literary pursuits, contributing to leading journals."

His glowing reputation among magicians and card men revolves around his time as a card cheat and a single demonstration of sleight-of-hand to some of the era's best magicians in New York in 1930. He lived out his last years in Rhode Island as a music teacher.Scott spent his formative years perfecting several difficult sleights of card manipulation in order to work as a cardsharp in card games throughout America. He participated in several different types of swindles and hustles. Eventually turning to a music career he was asked to perform one more demonstration. This single event created a legend within the magic community that continues to this day. 1.  \n* REDIRECT  \n* From a page move: This is a redirect from a page that has been moved (renamed).

It has been argued that Safran \"has contributed substantially to the body of knowledge regarding ethnic politics, nationalism, and related subjects, such as institutional and cultural pluralism, citizenship, immigration, diaspora, national identity, and the politics of language and religion\". He is a specialist on France, and much of his research concerns French ethnic politics. Safran was born in Dresden, Germany, to Romanian and Polish immigrant parents. In his youth under the Nazi regime in Germany, he spent a total of more than three years in a ghetto, forced-labour camp and concentration camp. After liberation, he spent four months in a United Nations displaced persons camp. He migrated to the United States in 1946 with the surviving members of his family. He subsequently gained a BA degree in history and an MA in international affairs from City College of New York, served for two years in the US army, and gained a PhD in public law and government from Columbia University, under the supervision of Otto Kirchheimer, in 1964. He was appointed to the post of assistant professor at the University of Colorado Boulder in 1965. He retired from a full professorship at the same institution in 2003. Safran was editor-in-chief of the journal Nationalism and Ethnic Politics from its founding in 1995 until 2010. He has also served as a series editor for the Routledge series on nationalism and ethnicity, and has chaired the International Political Science Association's Research Committee on Politics and Ethnicity and co-chaired its Research Committee on Language and Politics. He has held visiting professorships at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and the universities of Nice, Grenoble, Bordeaux, and Santiago de Compostela."

  "text" : "William Greenfield (1 April 1799 – 5 November 1831) was an English philologist. Greenfield was born in London on 1 April 1799. His father, William Greenfield, a native of Haddington, attended Well Street Chapel, London, then under the ministry of Alexander Waugh. He joined a missionary voyage in the ship Duff, and was accidentally drowned when his son was two years old. In the spring of 1802 Greenfield was taken by his mother to Jedburgh. In the summer of 1810 they returned to London, and Greenfield resided for some time with his two maternal uncles, who gave him instruction. They were men of business who studied languages in order to understand learned quotations, and they taught him. In October 1812 Greenfield was apprenticed to a bookbinder named Rennie. A Jew employed in his master's house, and a reader of the law in the synagogue, taught him Hebrew gratuitously. At sixteen Greenfield began to teach in the Fitzroy Sabbath School, of which his master was a conductor. At seventeen he became a member of Well Street Chapel, and a close friend of the minister, Dr. Waugh. In 1824 he left business to devote himself to languages and biblical criticism. In 1827 he published The Comprehensive Bible … with … a general introduction … Notes, &c. The book, though fiercely attacked as heterodox by the 'Record' and a Dr. Henderson, became very popular, especially among Unitarians. An abridgment was afterwards published as The Pillar of Divine Truth immoveably fixed on the foundation of the Apostles and Prophets. … The whole of the arguments and illustrations drawn from the pages of the Comprehensive Bible, by …[W. Greenfield], 8vo,London, 1831. Greenfield's valuable Defence of the Serampore Mahratta Version of the New Testament (in reply to the Asiatic Journal for September, 1829), 8vo, London, 1830, commended him to the notice of the British and Foreign Bible Society, by whom he was engaged, about April of that year, as superintendent of the editorial department. He had no previous knowledge of the Mahratta and other languages referred to in the pamphlet, which, it is said, was written within five weeks of his taking up the subject. He followed it up by A Defence of the Surinam Negro-English Version of the New Testament …, 1830 (in reply to the Edinburgh Christian Instructor). While nineteen months in the society's service Greenfield wrote upon twelve European, five Asiatic, one African, and three American languages; and acquired considerable knowledge of Peruvian, Surinam Creole, Chippeway, and Berber. His last undertaking for the society was the revision of the Modern Greek Psalter as it went through the press. He also projected a grammar in thirty languages, but in the midst of his labours he was struck down by brain fever, dying at Islington on 5 November 1831. He left a widow and five children, on whose behalf a subscription was opened His portrait by Hayter was engraved by Holl. Greenfield was a member of the Royal Asiatic Society."

The family had been members of the Society of Friends almost from the time of George Fox, but Ffennell's father, a hospitable country gentleman, was excluded from the society on account of undue conformity to the world. William Joshua resented this sentence (which was afterwards reversed), and with his five brothers joined the established church. He had a desultory education, and spent much time in hunting, shooting, and fishing. He became especially expert in angling for salmon; and his attention was drawn to the decay of the fishing in the Suir and other rivers."

William's descendants settled in New Amsterdam (now known as New York (city)) in the early 1600s; he had famous descendants and relatives in North American history; and many North Americans can trace their lineage to William. William and his family appear to have survived the murderous rampage of the Spanish Fury in 1576. A romanticized version of William's life tells (incorrectly) that he was a Huguenot that fled Paris on the day before the St. Bartholomew's Day massacre of 1572."

  "text" : "Wilfred \"Wilf\" Martin (born January 25, 1942) is a former ice hockey player and coach. He played at the center position for the Michigan Wolverines men's ice hockey team from 1963 to 1965, including the 1963–1964 NCAA national championship team. He also served briefly as the head coach of the Michigan hockey team in 1980 before resigning for health reasons. Martin was born in St. Paul, Alberta, and raised in Mallaig, Alberta.

He subsequently attended the University of Michigan where he played on the Michigan Wolverines ice hockey team during the 1963–1964 and 1964–1965 seasons. During the Wolverines national championship season of 1963–1964, Martin scored 34 goals and totaled 24 assists and 58 points. During the Wolverines run for the national championship in 1964, Martin scored two goals to lead the team to a 4–3 playoff victory over Michigan Tech. He was the captain of the 1964–1965 team. In two seasons of college hockey at Michigan, Martin scored 54 goals and 37 assists.

After coaching the first two games of the 1980–1981 season, Martin stepped down for health reasons. He announced his resignation in late November 1980, eight months after being hired. At the time of his resignation, Martin said, \"I've been having some health problems and have been away from the team for quite a while.

  "text" : "Wiley B. Glass (1874 - November 14, 1967) was a Southern Baptist missionary in China with the North China Mission with his primary ministry being established in then Hwanghsien, China. He was best known in China by his local name Kuo Mu-Shih. Glass was dearly loved by Chinese and missionaries alike and was considered the rock in which the missionaries were held together in Hwanghsien and the light that led so many to Christ. His primary work was teaching and then leading the North China Mission's Seminary in Hwanghsien which produced many strong leaders of Christ. He had a great heart for the poor and headed up many famine relief projects and, with his colleagues and some of the native believers, helped to establish a Red Cross Organization. This gave him good standing personally and provided \"great face\" for himself and foreigners in general among many of the Chinese. Although he was one of the lesser known missionaries to China during this period, he nonetheless produced some of the greatest work. His daughter Eloise Glass Cauthen, who wrote his biography in her book Higher Ground, and her husband Baker James Cauthen (an official in the Southern Baptist Convention Foreign Mission Board) followed faithfully in his footsteps and greatly served the Chinese for many years. It can be sure that Wiley Glass's years of faithful service are a reason that the Chinese Church has such a solid foundation and has exploded the way it has."

  "text" : "William Riley (23 April 1866 - 4 June 1961) was an English novelist. He was born in Laisterdyke, Bradford. He wrote 39 books using the name W. Riley, mostly fiction and mostly published by Herbert Jenkins Ltd. After an education at Bradford Grammar School he entered his father's business in textiles, but two years later the firm diversified and William led the innovative new business in the sale of magic lantern slides and equipment. The business was successful until 1914, when, with the onset of World War I, it failed: Riley then developed a second career as a writer, having already published Windyridge. His first novel Windyridge was written as a series of weekly chapters, in the winter of early 1911, to entertain his wife and two friends, the Bolton sisters, whose parents and third sister had all recently died. He quotes himself as saying \"I tell you what I'll do, I'll write a story and read each chapter to you as I go along, week by week. It may help to keep us from brooding\". The story is set in the village of Hawksworth near Baildon. He completed the tale in early 1912, having paused in his writing over the summer, and was persuaded to submit it for publication. He agreed to send it to just one publishing house, and chose this by writing on slips of paper the names of three established houses and the novice publisher Herbert Jenkins. It was this last slip which he selected, and Jenkins agreed to publish the book, as his firm's first publication. In 1919 he moved to Silverdale, Lancashire for the sake of his wife's health, and named his house Windyridge after his novel. In his autobiography, Sunset Reflections (1957), he recalls tales of life in Silverdale, where amongst other activities he was chair of the Building Committee for the Gaskell Memorial Hall. Bradford University Library's Special Collections department holds an archive of Willie Riley's manuscripts and other papers and a collection of his books. His death was recorded in obituaries in The Times and other local and national newspapers. He was buried in the village graveyard at Silverdale, along with his first wife Clara."

On his return he conducted the drawing classes of the Trustees' Academy for several years, and also occasionally contributed art criticisms to Edinburgh newspapers. His crayon portraits, of which a good many were exhibited at the Royal Academy in London, were much sought after. He was elected an Associate of the Royal Scottish Academy in 1862. Among his genre paintings we may mention his 'Highland Keeper's Daughter' (1866), 'Waiting for the Ferry,' 'Return from Maying,' and 'Too Late,' a striking picture exhibited at the Royal Scottish Academy in 1869, in which year he died."

Lowrey was born to John William Lowrey, Sr., and Loretta Lowrey (ca. 1881-1970) in Mansfield, the seat of DeSoto Parish south of Shreveport. He had three brothers and two sisters. He received his Bachelor of Arts degree from Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge. During World War II, he served in the United States Army in the European theater of operations. He subsequently obtained a Master of Arts from LSU and a Ph.D. from Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee. He was professor of history and the dean of arts and sciences at Nicholls State University in Thibodaux in Lafourche Parish in south Louisiana. In 1963, he joined the Centenary faculty; he was subsequently named Centenary's \"Outstanding Professor of 1966.\" In 1948, Lowrey wrote the article \"The Political Career of James Madison Wells,\" a former Louisiana governor in the then entitled Louisiana Historical Quarterly. He penned the article on the Red River in the publication The Rivers and Bayous of Louisiana. Through his role as chairman of the United Methodist editorial committee in the late 1970s, Lowrey spearheaded the project A History of Louisiana Methodism. The project includes the history of the church's extensive network of circuit riders. Lowrey's affiliations included Phi Kappa Phi, the scholastic honor society; Omicron Delta Kappa, the leadership fraternity; the Southern Historical Association, and the North Louisiana Historical Association, of which he vice president. He was also a member of the Commission on Archives and History of the United Methodist Church, the Historical Study Committee of Shreveport, and the Louisiana Committee for the Humanities. From 1963–1964, he was president of the Louisiana Historical Association, an organization now based in Lafayette which publishes A Dictionary of Louisiana Biography, both on-line and in hard volume. Lowrey died suddenly at the age of fifty-eight. Colleague John D. Winters of Louisiana Tech University, wrote a tribute to Lowrey in the Journal of the North Louisiana Historical Association, since renamed North Louisiana History, in which he referred to Lowrey as \"a skilled researcher, polished writer, and a master teacher.\" Lowrey's principal colleague in the Centenary history department was W. Darrell Overdyke, a specialist in the American South."

  "text" : "William Bowen Bonnor (9 September 1920 – 17 August 2015) was a mathematician and gravitation physicist best known for his research into astrophysics, cosmology and general relativity. For most of his academic career he was a professor of mathematics at the University of London. William Bonnor was born in London on 13 September 1920. He was educated at County High School, Ilford, at South East Essex Technical College and at Birkbeck College. His degrees of B.Sc., Ph.D. and D.Sc. were all obtained by part-time study. On leaving school in 1937 Bonnor served in clerical and executive branches of the Civil Service until 1944, when he became a chemist in the Admiralty, doing development work in paint technology. In 1946 he joined Shell Refining and Marketing Company to work on the rheology of lubricating greases. His career as a mathematician commenced in 1949 after obtaining a degree in mathematics at Birkbeck College. He joined the Department of Applied Mathematics at the University of Liverpool, where he met his future wife, Jean Stott, a staff tutor in social science. In 1957 he was appointed Reader and head of the mathematics department at Queen Elizabeth College (QEC), University of London. He was promoted to Professor in 1962, and stayed with the College until retirement in 1985. This period was the golden age of general relativity, and Bonnor played a part in it, particularly in the London Relativity Seminar. This had begun at Imperial College in the 1950s, moved to King's College and then to QEC from 1977 to 1983. He was also active internationally, making contact with scientific workers in the socialist countries in eastern Europe, particularly those in Jena in East Germany. During this period he published a paper on the Bonnor Beam which models the gravitational field of a beam of light. Bonnor held visiting appointments at the Universities of Illinois (1960–61), Otago (1984) and Cape Town (1984–86). In 1999 he was awarded the honorary degree of D.Sc. by the University of Portsmouth. Bonnor's research was published in about 150 papers in various scientific journals. The most cited paper described the effect of gravitation on Boyle's law; this has been extensively used in the theory of star formation. Another well-cited paper applies Newtonian dynamics to the formation of galaxies in cosmology. However, most of Bonnor's research was on the theory of general relativity. In this area he worked on the theory of gravitational waves, on the field of two charged bodies, and on the interaction of spinning particles. In 1964 he published \"The Mystery of the Expanding Universe\", a popular book on cosmology. He married Jean Stott, and had two children: Helen and Richard. He had four grandchildren: Amy, Tim, Jessica and George. William Bonnor died at his home of a heart attack on 17 August 2015."

He was also known as Gu Chen (顧琛) during the time he served under Gu Yanhui around 895. Wang Zongbi continued his rise in power during the reign of Wang Jian's son Wang Zongyan, first as Prince of Julu and then as Prince of Qi. In 925, after Former Shu suffered a number of key defeats at the hands of an invading Later Tang army, Wang Zongbi forced Wang Yan to surrender, hoping that would allow him to retain power in the Xichuan region (西川, i.e., the region around the Former Shu capital Chengdu). However, the deputy commander of the Later Tang army, Guo Chongtao, viewed Wang Zongbi as untrustworthy and put him to death."

  "text" : "William Hundley (born 1976) is an American artist born in St. Paul, Minnesota, who lives and works in Austin, Texas. In 2006 he began an ongoing series of photographs that he titled “Entoptic Phenomena” in which he photographs people jumping underneath fabrics and other various materials. The instant of the jump can be thought of as super ephemeral sculpture, lasting only a few seconds before reverting to their base components. The resulting photographs appear to have been made by computer manipulation, but Hundley stresses that “they are just photographs” and that there were absolutely no computer applications used in creating the images. He goes on to say that having “acrobatic models” is the key to the success of the imagery. A few of his \"Entoptic Phenomena\" photographs were featured in the 2007 Texas Biennial in which he was awarded the Juror’s Choice Award. In 2008 he started a new series of photographs “w/ cheeseburgers” that went on to become wildly popular or “viral” on the internet, primarily due to the photograph “Chihuahua on Cheeseburgers”. Another series of photographs, entitled “Little Naked Person Storage,” consists of photographs of naked people hiding in various places around the average American household. In an article on Sight Unseen, Hundley is quoted as saying, “My work started with the influence of Erwin Wurm and Maurizio Cattelan, these absurdists. I love the practical-joke nature of it; if I can make humor and beautiful aesthetics come together, that’s the biggest powerhouse I can imagine.” His photography has been featured in numerous publications and countless blogs and websites. In 2007 Hundley was nominated for Best Artist in the Austin Critics Table Awards. Though not initially mentioned in the credits, a few of his ideas were re-created in the music video “Heaven Can Wait” by Charlotte Gainsbourg featuring Beck. Eventually the director, Keith Schofield, contacted Hundley to apologize for not crediting his work as “inspiration” for portions of the video. Although most widely known for his photography, Hundley’s work also includes sculptures and installation and has been exhibited across the US and in Berlin. Recent works have focused on assembled collages and a series of tribal inspired masks with the idea of gathering objects from contemporary culture and using them in a “tribal” way. He recently contributed to the TEDx event in Austin, TX in February 2011. In 2011, a Hundley photograph is to be published in Adbusters magazine and he will also have an exhibition at Show & Tell Gallery in Toronto, Canada."

  "text" : "Walter Charles Mycroft (1890 – 14 June 1959) was a British novelist, screenwriter, film producer and director. In the 1920s he was film critic of the London Evening Standard, and a founder of the London Film Society, before joining the film industry. In 1928 he became Literary Adviser and Scenario Editor at the newly founded studio British International Pictures at Elstree, sometimes working with his friend Alfred Hitchcock. He was by his own account the principal author of Hitchcock's first BIP film The Ring (1927), and credited as the author of the original story on which Champagne (1928) was based. Their friendship does not seem to have survived their collaboration. Mycroft was elevated to head of production at Elstree during the 1930s, during which time BIP was reconstituted as the Associated British Picture Corporation. The company released a large number of films on which Mycroft was credited as producer, with varying levels of actual involvement. His adopted son, David Rees Mycroft worked as assistant director on a number of Elstree productions. David Mycroft, who isn't mentioned in Walter Mycroft's autobiography The Time of My Life, edited by Vincent Porter and published posthumously, was an experimental filmmaker, poet and psychologist who studied with R.D. Laing. David Mycroft's daughter Ruth Novaczek is a British experimental film maker."

In 1850 at Port Lincoln he married Margaret, 18-year-old daughter of John Tennant who had arrived in South Australia from Scotland in 1839. He was a veterinary surgeon and sheep inspector in Adelaide for a period. In 1847, he occupied land near Port Lincoln that would subsequently become Yalluna Station, and he resigned his inspector role in 1856. He acquired three more leases in 1867-68: the Mount Arden, Pichi Richi, and Yudnapinna Stations. He was elected to the South Australian House of Assembly at the 1868 election, representing Flinders, but did not contest the 1870 election. He was elected for Flinders a second time at the 1871 election, but again declined to recontest at the 1875 election, and advertised that he was leaving the colony soon afterwards. He was elected for a third time at the 1878 election and re-elected in 1881, before being defeated in 1884, just weeks before his death. He died in 1884 at Avenel House, Medindie, aged 63. His son, William Tennant Mortlock, inherited and expanded his pastoral empire and was elected to parliament for his old seat. Along with his son, daughter-in-law Rosina, grandson, John Andrew Tennant Mortlock (1894–1950), and John's wife Dorothy Elizabeth Mortlock (1906–1979), the Mortlock family left the Waite Agricultural Research Institute, the University of Adelaide, the State Library of South Australia, the City of Adelaide and the State of South Australia with many significant and lasting legacies."

His candidature for the by-election caused by the death of John Hammond, was endorsed by the Catholic Bishop of Kildare and Leighlin Dr. Patrick Foley (former president of Carlow College), due to Kavanagh's support for a Catholic University of Ireland. He served as Chairman of Carlow County Council 1907 - 1918 but was replaced as Chairman because of his support for conscription. Kavanagh had been a member of the Reform Association who advocated a limited devolution for Ireland. He supported the more independent Nationalist Party and Home Rule. He married Helen Louisa Howard, daughter of Colonel John Stanley Howard, on 1 February 1887 and had two sons, the elder of whom was an officer in the Army.

  "text" : "Warren W. Matthews, Jr. (born April 5, 1939) is a retired jurist, who served as the 8th and 12th Chief Justice of the Alaska Supreme Court. His service as a justice of that court from May 1977 to April 2009 makes him the second-longest serving justice in Alaska history, slightly less than that of Jay Rabinowitz. Born in Santa Cruz, California, Matthews graduated from San Benito High School in Hollister, California in 1957, where he says he was inspired to become an attorney when one paid a visit to his classroom. He went on to earn his Bachelor of Arts degree from Stanford University in 1961 and his Juris Doctor degree from Harvard Law School in 1964. Matthews came to Alaska in 1965 to serve as an associate at the law firm of Burr, Boney & Pease in Anchorage. In 1969, he formed the law firm of Matthews, Dunn and Bailey. He served as ethics committee chair for the Alaska Bar Association from 1968 to 1974. Then, in 1977, Republican Governor Jay Hammond appointed Matthews as an Associate Justice of the Alaska Supreme Court. The other Supreme Court justices elected Matthews to be the 8th Chief Justice from 1987 to 1990 and as the 12th Chief Justice from 1997 to 2000. As Chief Justice, he also served concurrently as Chairman of the Alaska Judicial Council. The nation's other chief justices elected Matthews as second vice president of the Conference of Chief Justices. Matthews wrote the 4–1 majority opinion in the 1981 Supreme Court case of Nix v. Alaska, in which he ruled that an undercover police officer gaining access to a residence was not a violation of the Fourth Amendment prohibition against unreasonable searches and seizures, stating, \"the use of undercover police agents 'is a highly necessary tool in fighting crime.'\" In 2007, Matthews dissented in the 3–2 Supreme Court decision of Alaska v. Planned Parenthood in which the Court struck down Alaska's law requiring parental consent for minors to obtain abortions while Matthews supported the law, arguing: \"Without a parent's consent, [minors] may not become licensed drivers or get married or obtain general medical or dental treatment.\" Later that year, Matthews wrote the dissenting opinion in the 3–2 Supreme Court decision Godfrey, d/b/a Mendenhall Valley Tesoro v. State of Alaska, Community and Economic Development, in which the Court supported Alaska's law holding retailers legally liable if their employees (even unknowingly) sold tobacco to minors. while Matthews opposed the law, arguing that the law was too broad in not allowing a retailer to argue that a clerk was not negligent. Several of his former law clerks eventually went on to prominence in Alaskan politics: Supreme Court Justice Craig F. Stowers, Attorney General Daniel S. Sullivan, and State Representative Lindsey Holmes. Since retiring from the Supreme Court in 2009, Matthews has served as a pro tem judge. Warren Matthews has been married to Donna since 1963. They have two daughters: Holly (born ca. 1974), a psychiatric social worker; and Meredith (born ca. 1978), an attorney in private practice."

  "text" : "Wes Graham was an influential Professor of Computer Science at the University of Waterloo, with strong ties to industry.Graham was named an Officer of the Order of Canada, in July 1999, but succumbed to cancer before the formal award ceremony in September 1999. Graham was one of the first Professors of Computer Science at the University of Waterloo, joining the new institution in 1959.When Waterloo first made its Computing Centre a separate department, in 1962, he was its first director.In 1965, when James G. Mitchell, then an undergraduate student at Waterloo, wrote an academic paper on how to write a teaching compiler for Fortran, that could compile, link, and execute a typical undergraduate's program in a single pass, Graham arranged for Mitchell and a small team, under his supervision, to write that compiler. The compiler was eventually known as WATFOR, and was eventually to be used by students at 420 Colleges and Universities around the world. WATFOR was followed by similar teaching compilers, like WATBOL, for teaching COBOL, and WATIAC for teaching the principles of assembly language programming. Graham is credited with convincing leading computer manufacturers that it was in their interests to donate equipment to the University, because Waterloo students would then write valuable software for those computers that would make the manufacturers` products more valuable.A total of $35 million CAD in donated equipment is credited to Graham. Graham, some of his colleagues, and students and former students of theirs, formed the University spin-off software company Watcom, which was sold to Powersoft in 1994, for $100 million CAD. Powersoft was then acquired by Sybase in 1994 which was subsequently acquired by SAP SE in 2010. The J.W. Graham Medal for excellence in Computer Science was named in his honor."

  "text" : "William Trabue Major (1790–1867) was a prominent religious leader in Bloomington, Illinois in the mid-19th century. He founded the First Christian Church (affiliated with the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ) denomination) and built the city's first public meeting hall, Major's Hall, which hosted an early convention of the Illinois branch of the Republican Party and became best known as the site of \"Lincoln's Lost Speech\". Major was born in Kentucky in 1790, a son of John Major and Judith Trabue. He moved to Illinois in 1835. He had begun as a Baptist, but disagreed with their beliefs that supported slavery. He changed his affiliation to the \"Campbellites\", as the Disciples of Christ denomination was then known informally, and founded the First Christian Church of Bloomington in 1837. Initially he and his wife, the former Margaret Allen Shipp, held services in their home. In 1840, they opened a wooden church building near the corner of Front and East Streets just south of the downtown. In 1852, they opened a public meeting hall next door to the church, which was known as Major's Hall. The Hall received much attention in 1856, when the Illinois branch of the fledgling Republican Party held a convention on the building's third floor, featuring frequent Bloomington visitor Abraham Lincoln. The future President's fiery, influential anti-slavery speech has no known transcript, and became known as \"Lincoln's Lost Speech\". In 1857, Major's Hall became the first home of Illinois State Normal University, which the teachers' college occupied until the school's new campus was opened in Normal, Illinois in 1861. Also in 1857, the Majors dedicated a new, brick-clad building to house First Christian Church, at the corner of Jefferson Street and what is now Roosevelt Street. The current sanctuary, opened in 1959, is the third church structure on that site. Major died in 1867 as a prominent citizen of the city. He and Margaret, who had produced nine children between them, are buried in Evergreen Cemetery. Although what was left of Major's Hall (an 1872 fire having destroyed the historic third floor) was demolished in 1959, the Major name is commemorated in a portion of the church's annex, which includes a large meeting room known as Major Hall."

Along with Chief Manteo he travelled to London in 1584, where the two men created a sensation at court. Hosted at Durham House by the explorer and courtier Sir Walter Raleigh, he and Manteo assisted the scientist Thomas Harriot with the job of deciphering and learning the Carolina Algonquian language. Unlike Manteo, Wanchese evinced little interest in learning English, and did not befriend his hosts, remaining suspicious of English motives in the New World. In April 1586, having returned to Roanoke, he finally ended his good relations with the English, leaving Manteo as the colonists' sole Indian ally."

The trek was to the forks of the South Saskatchewan and Red Deer rivers. He added an 850-mile side trip on this occasion, along with John Edward Harriott, to the Cypress Hills and Missouri country.

(Downloadable at www.umich.edu/~cses/) Making democracy work requires a deeper understanding than we have hitherto been able to gain, of how various kinds of democratic institutions operate and how citizens respond to them. In any study of a single country it is difficult to ascertain this, since the institutions are invariant for all citizens one can study. The CSES is a large cross-national survey involving approximately 50 countries in which an international team has conducted a common survey over the last five years. The survey is designed to allow analysis of the impact of political institutions on citizens’ political engagement and political choices, with the data made available immediately on our website to all scholars. I was chair of the project until the fall of 2003, and until 2006 was the PI for the project. To date at least 120 books, chapters, articles, and Ph.D. theses have been written using these data.

  "text" : "William Jones (christened 18 June 1726 – 20 August 1795) was a Welsh antiquary, poet, scholar and radical. Jones was an ardent supporter of both the American and French Revolutions – his strong support of the Jacobin cause earned him the nickname \"the rural Voltaire\" or \"Welsh Voltaire\". Despite his support for foreign revolutionary causes, he never advocated an uprising within his own country, instead campaigning to encourage his countrymen to emigrate to the United States. Jones held strong anti-English feelings, which led to one contemporary to describe him as \"the hottest arsed\" Welshman he had ever known."

  "text" : "William Edwin Harvey (5 September 1852 – 28 April 1914), known as W. E. Harvey, was a British Lib-Lab Member of Parliament. Born in Hasland, Derbyshire, Harvey worked in a coal mine from the age of ten. He joined the South Yorkshire Miners' Association (SYMA) in 1869, and was the union's local delegate by 1872. For his trade union activity, he was dismissed from the local pit, but managed to find work at Sheepbridge, then later at Morton. He also converted to Primitive Methodism and in his spare time was a lay preacher. In 1880, the Derbyshire-based members of the SYMA split away to form the Derbyshire Miners' Association (DMA), and Harvey became the new union's first treasurer. He resigned in 1882, because union meetings clashed with cricket matches for his employer's team. However, the following year, he was elected as the union's assistant secretary. In 1891, he was elected to the national executive of the Miners' Federation of Great Britain (MFGB), serving on it in most subsequent years, and in 1894 he was the President of Chesterfield Trades Council. Politically a liberal, strongly opposed to socialism and syndicalism, Harvey became the vice-president of the Labour Electoral Association in 1894. This organisation aimed to secure the election of workers under the auspices of the Liberal Party, and Harvey was elected to Chesterfield Borough Council in 1897, serving until his death. In 1906, Harvey became financial and corresponding secretary of the DMA, and his high-profile secured him the Liberal Party candidacy in the North East Derbyshire by-election, 1907. He was successful, and reluctantly joined the Labour Party in 1910, on the instructions of his union. Despite his seat in Parliament, he remained an active trade unionist, serving as Vice-President of the MFGB from 1912, and as General and Financial Secretary of the DMA from 1913. Harvey became increasingly unhappy with how the Labour party was behaving towards the issue of Miners' representation. In particular he was unhappy with the way Barnet Kenyon was treated during and after the Chesterfield by-election, 1913. He therefore decided to resign the Labour whip and re-took the Liberal whip on 30 March 1914. He died, aged 61, almost a month later."

  "text" : "Wawrzyniec Cezary Anichini (born Cesare Anighini; 1787 in Florence – January 31, 1861 in Raudondvaris) was an Italian architect, active mostly in what is now the Republic of Lithuania. Anichini arrived to the lands of the former Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth in 1812 as an engineer within Napoleon's Grande Armée. Following Napoleon's defeat in Russia he was captured as prisoner of war. Released by the Russians he settled in Vilna (modern Vilnius) together with yet another Italian expatriate, Franciszek Andriolli (a sculptor and father of Michał Elwiro Andriolli). With time he polonised his surname and signed most his projects as Cezary Anichini. Throughout most of his later life he served as an architect of the mighty Tyszkiewicz family. Among the most notable works are the reconstruction of Raudonė Castle, construction of churches in Raudondvaris (did not survive) and Biržai, and park of the Raudondvaris Castle."

  "text" : "William Hunter Campbell (September 9, 1839 – June 18, 1862) was an Ohio civilian who worked for the Union Army during the early years of the American Civil War. He participated in a daring raid behind enemy lines on the Western and Atlantic Railroad, known famously as the Great Locomotive Chase. The mission failed and Campbell and seven fellow raiders were executed by the Confederates on the charge of spying. William Hunter Campbell was born in Fox Township, Carroll County, Ohio to Samuel and Sarah Hunter Campbell. Howe says in Historical Collections of Ohio that his mother was named Jane Morgan, a cousin of Confederate General John Hunt Morgan. Campbell was visiting friends with 2nd Ohio Infantry in Kentucky in 1862 when he was recruited to participate in a raid to steal a Confederate locomotive and bring it to Federal lines. James J. Andrews, also a civilian, recruited Campbell and 22 soldiers from three Ohio regiments, the 2nd, 21st and 33rd Ohio Infantry. Another participant described Campbell : \"He was a man of two hundred twenty pounds, handsome as Apollo, and of immense physical strength, which he was slow to use when roused, though good-natured and clever in the main.\" The raiders were to sneak south in civilian clothing and rendezvous in Marietta, Georgia. All but two made it and boarded a train pulled by the locomotive General on April 12, 1862. The train traveled north and stopped in Big Shanty, Georgia for breakfast, and the raiders stole the General and a few cars, intending to tear up track and burn bridges behind them and meet advancing Federal troops. After a chase described in Great Locomotive Chase, the raiders ran out of fuel near Chattanooga, Tennessee, and were captured. As a civilian, Campbell was tried and convicted of being an unlawful combatant. He was hanged with six others June 18, 1862 at the corner of Fair Street (now Memorial Drive) and South Park Avenue, Atlanta, Georgia. His hanging was described : \"Five only remained dangling in the air; for two of the seven, Campbell and Slavens, being very heavy men, broke the ropes, and fell to the ground insensible. In a short time they recovered, and asked for a drink of water, which was given them. Then they requested an hour to pray before entering the future world, which lay so near and dark before them. This last petition was indignantly refused, and as soon as the ropes could be adjusted, they were compelled to re-ascend the scaffold, and were again turned off!\" Campbell was buried nearby, and his remains were removed April 25, 1866 to Chattanooga National Cemetery, near the Ohio Memorial, (Section G, grave No. 11,180). Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton awarded the first Medals of Honor to several of the raiders. As a civilian, Campbell was not eligible. Jeff York played Campbell in the Disney movie The Great Locomotive Chase."

Cherry was born in Dayton, Tennessee. He grew up in Morristown, Tennessee, and the Karns community of Knox County, where he attended Karns High School. After high school, Cherry went on to the University of Tennessee-Knoxville, where he was a walk-on basketball player. He appeared in 18 games for the freshman team in 1970–1971. In the 1971–1972 season, he and Larry Robinson, a junior college transfer with an athletic scholarship, became the first African-Americans to play on the university's varsity team. In 1971–72 Cherry played in four varsity games, making him a member of the 1972 team that won the Southeastern Conference (SEC) championship. A five-foot-eleven-inch point guard, Cherry was cut from the team after that season. Cherry completed his undergraduate and J.D. degrees at the University of Tennessee-Knoxville and an MBA at the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga. He worked for the Tennessee Valley Authority before entering the practice of law in Knoxville. He died on August 4, 2007."

Kaufmann (born Jizchak Schmeidler), son of a Polish-Jewish woman called Rachela Schmeidler, was adopted by the wealthy German-Jewish couple Dr. Sally and Johanna Kaufmann at the age of three. While his adoptive parents were eventually murdered in Auschwitz, Kaufmann fled to England during the outbreak of the War, and was later deported to Australia on the infamous ship HMT Dunera in 1940. He soon joined the Australian army as a volunteer. After the war and demobilisation he worked in different environments and various jobs at the same time trying to further his education. Kaufmann joined the Melbourne Realist Writers' Group and had some of his stories published in the Realist Writer. He became politically active and travelled extensively. He was encouraged by writers such as Frank Hardy and David Martin to write a novel based on his own past in Nazi Germany (Voices in the Storm). Later Kaufmann settled in the East Berlin and continued publishing in English and German. Kaufmann's schematic socialist realistic stories on the struggles of Australian trade unionists and the disenfranchisement of the Aborigines, became very popular in the GDR after his return to East Berlin in 1957."

Originally a chorister at Westminster Abbey, he developed a reputation as a fine tenor, but was passed over for another musician at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden and thus went to Europe to seek employment. Returning to England, he was assistant director at the George Frideric Handel commemorations in Westminster Abbey and the Pantheon in 1784, and composed a number of anthems for royal usage. He gained a doctorate in music at Oxford University in 1790. In his spare time, he acted as a magistrate for the jurisdiction near his house in Portman Square. He was knighted by the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, John Jeffreys Pratt, second Earl Camden in 1795, thus becoming the first British musician honoured with a knighthood. An unremarkable composer and musician, he gained the title more through tutoring the king's family and his contacts than any merit, being a friend of several members of the royal family and composers such as Joseph Haydn. Few of his compositions survive."

After acting as a consultant to the Swedish biathlon team in the 2014-15 season, in April 2015 the Swedish Biathlon Federation announced that Pichler had been re-appointed as the team's head coach. Wolfgang's brother, Claus Pichler, is a Social Democratic politician who was elected mayor of the brothers' home town of Ruhpolding.

  "text" : "William B. Caldwell (June 3, 1808 – March 21, 1876) was a Democratic Party jurist in the U.S. state of Ohio who sat on the Ohio Supreme Court 1849–1854. William B. Caldwell was born on a Butler County, Ohio farm, where he stayed his first 21 years. He entered Miami University at Oxford, Ohio in 1830, and graduated in 1835. He studied law under John Woods of Hamilton, Ohio, and was admitted to the bar in 1837. He began practice in Xenia, Ohio and moved to Cincinnati, Ohio the next year. There he formed a partnership with General Samuel F. Cary. In 1841 Caldwell was elected Prosecuting Attorney of Hamilton County, Ohio, and in 1842, President Judge of the Court of Common Pleas of that county. He held that position until 1849, when the Ohio General Assembly elected him to the Ohio Supreme Court. In autumn 1851, a new constitution of the state made judges elective, and Caldwell received the most votes among 11 candidates for five positions on the court. The five winners drew lots, and Caldwell was assigned a one year term. He was re-elected in 1852 to a five-year term. Caldwell resigned his seat in December, 1854, and resumed his practice in Cincinnati. Caldwell was married to Agnes Corry of Cincinnati in 1844, and was survived by a son of the same name. He died at Cincinnati March 21, 1876. He was buried at Spring Grove Cemetery. Caldwell married Agnes Corry on January 3, 1844. They had three children."

Having received his general education at the High School, he was apprenticed to his father, and at the same time attended the practice of the Dundee Royal Infirmary. In 1842, he matriculated at the university of Edinburgh, and in 1848 graduated M.D., obtaining a gold medal for his thesis 'On Inflammatory Effusions into the Substance of the Lungs as modified by Contagious Fevers'. In October of the same year he was appointed demonstrator of anatomy at the university of Glasgow, under Allen Thomson, and also pathologist to the royal infirmary, which posts he held up to 1855. In that year he was sent out to the Crimea under Dr. Robert S. D. Lyons as assistant pathologist to the commission appointed to investigate the diseases from which our troops were suffering (Parl. Papers, 1856). In 1860, he was selected for the post of professor of pathology in the newly constituted army medical school at Fort Pitt, Chatham, which was afterwards removed to Isetley. This appointment he held until April 1892, when failing health necessitated his retirement, and he died the same year on 25 June. He had been elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1873, and was knighted at the jubilee in 1887. In the following year, he received the honorary degrees of LL.D. from the universities of Edinburgh and Glasgow. He married in 1884 Emily Clara, daughter of Henry Allen, esq., who survived him. His portrait by Symonds is at Netley Hospital."

He then studied law at Gray's Inn (1635), and was called to the bar in 1642. He succeeded his father before 1650 and was appointed High Sheriff of Pembrokeshire for 1645–46. He may have been the William Phillipps of Heathook, Pembrokeshire who was a zealous royalist. Information was laid against him on 29 June 1649 that he was a delinquent and he was excepted from the General Pardon for South Wales and Monmouthshire on 26 February 1651. His estates were sequestered by the Committee for South Wales on 13 May 1651 by order of the Committee for Compounding, London, on the grounds that he was concerned in Poyer's Rising of 1648. In 1660, Philipps was elected Member of Parliament for Haverfordwest in the Convention Parliament. His opponent Sampson Lort claimed victory after being judged unsuitable by the corporation in view of his oppressive behaviour during the interregnum and the election was declared void on 29 June. Philipps was re-elected on 7 August 1660. He served as deputy lieutenant of Cardiganshire from 1674 to February, 1688. He married Martha Price of Kingston upon Thames, Surrey. They had a son, who predeceased his father and 4 daughters. Picton castle passed to his brother Morgan, and thence to his descendants."

  "text" : "Whit Burnett (1900–1972) was an American writer and writing teacher who founded and edited the literary magazine Story. In the 1940s, Story was an important magazine in that it published the first or early works of many writers who went on to become major authors. Not only did Burnett prove to be a valuable literary birddog for new talent, but Story remained a respectable though low-paying (typically $25 per story) alternative for stories rejected by the large-circulation slick magazines published on glossy paper like Collier's or The Saturday Evening Post or the somewhat more prestigious and literary slick magazines such as The New Yorker. While Story paid poorly compared to the slicks and even the pulps and successor digest-sized magazines of its day, it paid better than most of, and had similar cachet to, the university-based and the other independent \"little magazines\" of its era. Burnett and his first wife, Martha Foley, founded the magazine in Vienna, Austria in 1931. Showcasing short stories by new authors, 67 copies of the debut issue (April–May, 1931) were mimeographed in Vienna. Two years later, the couple moved to New York City, where they continued to publish the magazine. Burnett and Foley created The Story Press in 1936. In 1939, Harper & Bros. published his memoir The Literary Life and to Hell With It. In the Time Magazine review of the book, entitled \"Funny Editor\", the anonymous reviewer characterized Burnett as a humorist."

Dr. Spratling was the superintendent of the Craig Colony for Epileptics in Sonyea, New York from 1893 to 1908, and co-founded the National Association for the Study of Epilepsy. In 1904, Spratling was appointed superintendent of Bellevue Hospital Center; however, due to civil service requirements, he did not actually hold the office. Later in life, Spratling suffered a nervous breakdown and retired to Florida. In 1915, he died of a gunshot wound while hunting."

  "text" : "William Henry Pyne (1769 in London – 29 May 1843 in London) was an English writer, illustrator and painter, who also wrote under the name of Ephraim Hardcastle. He trained at the drawing academy of Henry Pars in London. He first exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1790. He specialized in picturesque settings including groups of people rendered in pen, ink and watercolour. Pyne was one of the founders of the Royal Watercolour Society in 1804. His book The Costume of Great Britain, including 60 paintings of professional and working-class men and women and scenes from everyday life (published by William Miller in 1805), attracted the attention of the publisher Rudolph Ackermann, and Pyne was to engrave and write for many of his projects, including writing the text for the first two volumes of the very successful illustration-centred The Microcosm of London. He was his own publisher for The History of the Royal Residences (1816–1819), a large illustrated book with 100 engravings of the exteriors and interior decorations and furnishings of Windsor Castle, St. James's Palace, Carlton House, Kensington Palace and Hampton Court Palace. It caused financial difficulties for him – he was imprisoned for debt more than once, and died a poor man in 1843. As Ephraim Hardcastle, he wrote gossipy columns on art for the Literary Gazette, which in 1824 were collected in 2 volumes as Wine and Walnuts, or After-dinner Chit-chat. He wrote for other journals, and in 1825 published a novel The Twenty-ninth of May, or Rare Doings at the Restoration. Pyne’s watercolours are in major museum collections, such as the Royal Collection and the British Museum. His son, George Pyne (1800–01 - 1884), was also a painter in watercolour, writer on drawing and perspective."

  "text" : "Willem Duys (17 August 1928 – 2 June 2011) was a Dutch radio and television presenter, commentator, tennis player and music producer. Duys was born in Bussum. Having made the final NK Older Youth (Van Lennep Cup) in 1946, he won the Spieghel Hilversum and Heide B tournament, took the semi-finals Plaswijck Kralingen and won the B tournament in Rotterdam. He also reached the final three men's doubles Flehite A with Peter Scholtz and was 1956 men's singles champion Unilever (following Jan de Soet). After retiring from tennis in mid 1956 Duys began writing for various music magazines and was invited to act as an announcer on AVRO in 1956. He became a television presenter in 1959. From 1963 until 1979 he presented the TV program \"Voor de Vuist Weg\", generally considered to be the first talk show on Dutch television. In 1974 he received the Gouden Televizierring for this program. He regularly presented the Grand Gala du Disque and was a commentator for large tennis matches. For eight years (1962, 1963, 1974–1976, 1978, 1979 and 1983) he was the regular Eurovision Song Contest Commentator for Dutch television viewers. Duys also presented the Sunday morning radio show \"Muziek Mozaïek\" for four decades. A TV version of that show ran for six seasons. In 1999, after a cerebral infarction, he retired. He worked for the AVRO for more than forty years. Willem Duys lived alternately in Saint-Paul, Alpes-Maritimes and Naarden and thereafter in Hilversum. He died in Hilversum on 2 June 2011 from a lung infection."

The son of Rowland and Mary (Allen) Robinson of South Kingstown in the Rhode Island colony, his father was a relatively late immigrant to Rhode Island, arriving in Newport from Cumberland, England in 1675. Robinson first served in a civil capacity in 1724, becoming Deputy from South Kingstown, and subsequently served an additional eight terms. In 1735 and again in 1741 he was the Speaker of the House of Deputies. In 1742 he was appointed by the Assembly with four others to determine if the \"woods\" part of Newport, consisting mostly of farmers, should be set apart from the \"compact\" part of Newport, consisting mostly of merchants and tradesmen. The following year the \"woods\" part became the new town of Middletown. In 1745 Robinson was selected as Deputy Governor of the colony for a one year term, and then selected again in 1747 for another term, serving under Governor Gideon Wanton both times. Robinson married twice, first to Martha, the daughter of John and Sarah (Wilson) Potter with whom he had five children. Following Martha's death he married Abigail, the widow of Caleb Hazard, and daughter of William and Abigail (Remington) Gardiner. This marriage resulted in eight more children. Robinson died on September 19, 1751 in South Kingstown, leaving a very large estate to his heirs, valued at over 21,000 pounds. He is buried in a Robinson family cemetery near Narragansett Pier."

He was the oldest son of Rev. John Anderson, and was born in Washington County, Pennsylvania. He graduated in 1824 from Washington College where his father served as chairman of the board and then studied theology under his father. His entire adult life was spent in the ministry with the exception of a short period (1843-1844) when he was professor of rhetoric and belles-lettres at Hanover College, Hanover, Indiana, and later when he was president of Miami University at Oxford, Ohio, from 1849 to 1854. He was a popular president at Miami, following the turbulent and unhappy presidency of Erasmus D. MacMaster. In 1869 Anderson moved to Kansas and settled in Junction City where he occasionally preached in the Presbyterian church. Sermons were also delivered in Abilene, Kansas, when that town was at the height of its cattle shipping activities. Anderson died and was buried at Junction City. Anderson was the father of John Alexander Anderson who was a U.S. Congressman, president of Kansas State University and ambassador to Egypt during the administration of Benjamin Harrison who had been a college roommate of Anderson's at Miami University during the time William C. Anderson was president. Anderson's brother was Civil War officer and railroad executive John Byers Anderson. Anderson Hall, a dormitory, is named in Anderson's memory at Miami."

  "text" : "William Frankland (c.1573 – 10 December 1640) was an English politician who sat in the House of Commons from 1628 to 1629 and in 1640. Frankland was the son of Ralph Frankland of Carlton, near Thirsk, and his wife Margaret and educated at Barnard’s Inn and Gray's Inn (1596). He inherited the manor of Great Thirkleby from his uncle Hugh Frankland in 1606. Frankland was appointed High Sheriff of Hertfordshire for 1613–14. Between 1619 and 1623 he sold his properties in Hertfordshire and built a house on the Great Thirkleby estate he had inherited. In 1628 he was elected Member of Parliament for Thirsk and sat until 1629 when King Charles decided to rule without parliament for eleven years. In April 1640, he was re-elected MP for Thirsk in the Short Parliament. Frankland died in 1640. He had married Lucy Boteler, daughter of Sir Henry Boteler, of Hatfield-Woodhall, Hertfordshire, by whom he had seven sons. He was succeeded by his son Henry, who was the father of Sir William Frankland, 1st Baronet."

  "text" : "(For other people named William Rogers, see William Rogers (disambiguation).) William Rogers (born c. 1545, active c. 1589–1604) was an English engraver. A citizen of London – one of his surviving engravings is signed Anglus et Civis Lond. – he is the first English craftsman known to have practised engraving and the greatest portrait engraver of the Tudor period. The English were extremely late in coming to printmaking, though several artists from the thriving Flemish industry had worked in England already; the engraved print had been invented over 150 years before Rogers began to produce them. Rogers was also a goldsmith, and presumably acquired his technique in that context. His portrait style reflects Flemish models, while his backgrounds are often \"overloaded with ornament\" that is \"redolent of the goldsmith's shop\". Rogers is known for his engraved portraits of Queen Elizabeth I of England, which are very scarce. Eliza Triumphans (1589), celebrating the defeat of the Spanish Armada in 1588, shows Elizabeth surrounded by the allegorical symbols of empire common to her portraiture at this time. Queen Elizabeth Standing in a Room with a Lattice Window, one of the best-known Tudor engravings, is based on a drawing of the queen by the miniaturist Isaac Oliver; the densely ornamented setting is probably the invention of Rogers. Elizabeth I as Rosa Electa, of which the two surviving impressions are in the Bodleian Library at Oxford University and the British Museum, is undated but can be assigned to the later years of Elizabeth's reign by the style of the costume. The portrait depicts the Queen surrounded by roses, symbolising the Tudor union of the houses of York and Lancaster. Rogers also engraved a version of the large allegorial picture of Henry VIII and his family attributed to Lucas de Heere, now at Sudeley Castle. Rogers' print, of which only three impressions are known, shows Elizabeth in the updated fashions of the 1590s and adds verses at the bottom making explicit the contrast between Mary I's marriage and its accompanying war on the left, and Elizabeth's virginity accompanied by Peace and Plenty on the right. Rogers engraved numerous portraits, title-pages, and illustrations for books, among these being the titles to Jan Huyghen van Linschoten's Discours of Voyages into ye Easte and West Indies, 1596, and to Sir John Harington's translation of Ariosto's Orlando Furioso (1591); the author portrait and title for John Gerard's The Herball, or a Generall Historie of Plantes (1597); the cuts in Broughton's Concert of Scripture (1596); and the portraits in William Segar's Honor, Military and Civile (1602) and Milles's Catalogue of Honour, or Treasury of True Nobility (1610). Rogers' work shows him to have been a trained artist in the art of engraving. He is mentioned by Francis Meres in his Palladis Tamia (1598): \"As Lysippus, Praxiteles, and Pyrgoteles were excellent engravers, so have we these engravers: Rogers, Christopher Switzer, and Cure.\""

  "text" : "Henry Wallace Stuart Clark MBE (20 November 1926 – 8 May 2011) was a sailor, author and businessman from Northern Ireland. Clark was educated at Shrewsbury School and served in the Royal Navy Volunteer Reserve in World War II. He was an officer in the Ulster Special Constabulary and upon its dissolution became a major in the Ulster Defence Regiment serving until 1981. He was the elder brother of Henry Maitland Clark, MP for North Antrim from 1959 to 1970. He was appointed High Sheriff of County Londonderry for 1969. He is best known for his writing and his sailing exploits. He began sailing at an early age, and from the late 1940s began to explore the waters near his family's ancestral home in Upperlands, County Londonderry. Basing himself in Portrush, County Antrim, he sailed along the north coast of Ireland, and in particular visited Rathlin Island, County Antrim and Inishowen, County Donegal, Republic of Ireland. His cruises became more adventurous with experience, and his 1954 voyage round Ireland became the basis for his best-known book, Sailing Round Ireland, first published in 1976. In 1963 he was a leading light in the recreation of St Columba's voyage from Derry to Iona in a currach. Nearly thirty years later he was heavily involved in another major reconstruction journey, the Lord of the Isles Voyage, from Ireland to Scotland in Aileach, a wooden galley of the kind used in those waters in medieval times. Other early voyages in his long sailing career included a cruise to Norway in 1953, and frequent trips to Brittany as well as a longer voyage to the Mediterranean in 1961 through the French canal system. One of the most challenging projects he was involved in was a circumnavigation of Europe. The journey in Wild Goose by his son Miles, travelled around North Cape, Norway, and then through Russian waterways to the Black Sea, and on through the Mediterranean back to Northern Ireland. Wallace helped plan the voyage and sailed on the first and last legs of the journey. Miles died before the completion of the account of the voyage, and Wallace compiled the book Sailing Round Russia from Miles's logs. He continued sailing late into life, and completed another reconstruction journey in 2009 when he recreated the 1814 journey of his ancestor Robert Harvey to the Western Isles. Having sold his last boat Agivey in 2009, Wallace was to complete one last cruise in the summer of 2010 along the Croatian coast with old friends. He died on 8 May 2011, and is survived by his wife June and his son Bruce. His last book, The Call of the Running Tide, an all-new work edited by Bruce Clark and Tara Mackie, looking back on his long sailing career, was launched on Rathlin Island on 7 July 2012."

After the German attack on the Soviet Union, Birkner was deployed in the Bezirk Bialystok district behind Army Group Centre due to reports of Soviet guerrilla activity in the area. Birkner arrived in Białystok from the General Government on 30 June 1941, sent in by SS-Obersturmbannfuhrer Eberhard Schöngarth on orders from the Reich Main Security Office.

  "text" : "Colonel Valdemar Franklin Quintero (January 26, 1941 – August 18, 1989) was the commander of the Colombian National Police in Antioquia Province. Franklin had led several major raids which resulted in the seizure of multiple tons of cocaine. He was murdered by the Medellín cartel in Medellín because of these drug seizures and his refusal to talk with the cartel. He successfully thwarted an attempt to kill Luis Carlos Galán, a Colombian journalist and presidential candidate, when an RPG was launched at Galán. The cartel formally took responsibility for the slaying of the police commander by calling a series of local radio stations. The caller, who identified himself as a person from the \"The Extraditables\", said \"We, the Extraditables, claim responsibility for the murder of Col. Valdemar Franklin in response to the repression committed and the government's refusal to have a dialogue with us\". Pablo Escobar, a major Colombian drug lord, had allegedly ordered the murder of Franklin on the day of the death of Luis Carlos Galán. On 18 August 1989 (the same day in which the Colombian politician Luis Carlos Galán was murdered), at the age of 46, Franklin left his residence in a chauffeur-driven car. When the vehicle was 450 feet from the compound, its route was blocked by another car and several gunmen emerged, according to officials. Various witnesses said that Franklin's car was destroyed by gunfire and the interior was covered in blood. One eye-witness stated to a local radio station, \"They fired without mercy for several minutes at the colonel, who was hit more than a hundred times\". That witness also said that the chauffeur was injured in the ambush. He is portrayed by the actor Mauricio Figueroa as the character Osvaldo Quintana in the colombian TV Series Escobar, el patrón del mal."

Bale says that he was already of 'mature years' when he went to Oxford, where he studied for several years among the brethren of his order in their college. He was chiefly renowned for his minute knowledge of theology, and took a D.D. degree probably before he left the university. He was much esteemed by his contemporaries, and having moved through several honourable stations, was chosen provincial of his order in England. He died at Lynn in 1507 in the prime of life, and was buried in the church of his order there. Galeon was looked upon as a great ornament to his society, which he is said to have roused from slothfulness. Bale says that he gave many of his writings in his lifetime to his own religious house at Lynn. Bishop Pamphilus is incorrect in his statement that Galeon died in 1500, aged 90. The works ascribed to him are: Lectiones in Theologia, Disputationes Variæ and Conciones per Annum."

Wipas is a Thai \"Red Shirt\", a supporter of the United Front for Democracy Against Dictatorship, the movement loosely affiliated with deposed prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra. On 29 April 2010, he was arrested at his home in Rayong Province by the Department of Special Investigation on charges of lèse majesté, following a Facebook post to his account allegedly criticizing the king. He was 37 years old at the time of his arrest. Wipas denied that he had made the post, stating that his account had been hacked. In May 2011, The Nation quoted a \"reliable source\" as saying that Wipas had been released on bail, but was trying to avoid further news coverage. The Bangkok Post reported that this was thought to be the first lèse majesté charge against a Thai Facebook user. A media reform activist described the case as escalating \"the climate of fear among [Thai] internet users\" and stated that \"now many people refrain from revealing their real identities on Facebook.\" In its 2011 Annual Report, Amnesty International criticized the arrest, expressing its concern that \"[Thai] freedom of expression is being curbed through the use of the emergency decree, the lese majeste law and the Computer Crime Act.\" The organization named Wipas a prisoner of conscience, apparently the first in several decades. An advisor to Amnesty International said he was uncertain why Wipas had been classified as a prisoner conscience while the possibly hundreds of other citizens detained under the lese majeste law had not."

He was born in Saint John, New Brunswick, the son of Jonathan Bliss and Mary Worthington, Massachusetts loyalists, and he was educated at King's Collegiate School and King's College. Bliss was called to the Nova Scotia bar in 1818. He continued his law education at Westminster Hall and at the Inner Temple with Sir William Wightman. In 1823, he married Sarah Ann Anderson, the adopted daughter of Sampson Salter Blowers. Bliss supported a group of Halifax businessman by advocating a charter for the Bank of Nova Scotia in 1832 and he later served as a director for the bank. In 1834, he was named a puisne judge for the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia. Bliss resigned from the bench in January 1869. He served on the board of governors for King's College from 1848 to 1853. Bliss died in Halifax at the age of 78. His portrait hangs in the Halifax County Court House. His daughter Elizabeth Ann married William Hunter Odell, his daughter Mary married Bishop Hibbert Binney and his daughter Louisa married Bishop James B. Kelly. His brother Henry was a lawyer and author who served as provincial agent in London for Nova Scotia and New Brunswick.

Clark, whose Union Baptist Church was located across the road from the Quantico Baptist Church in the village of Independent Hill. Elder Smoot was a prolific writer of religious tracts setting forth the true order of predestination, election, total depravity of all humans in their natural state, with GOD's elect children being called in the Spiritual birth while they lived upon this earth, and their sanctification and preservation are eternal; including several books and pamphlets, and a monthly newsletter he printed himself on a press set up in his home in Occoquan. This newsletter, \"The Sectarian\" devoted to the Cause of the Anti-Means, Old School, Predestinarian, or Bible Baptists\" appeared in monthly installments from 1890 until Elder Smoot's death in 1938. In 1904 Elder Smoot also published a collection of 698 hymns, called \"The Sectarian Hymnal\". Elder Smoot died at his home in 1938 at the age of 90. He was found on his front porch seated in a chair with his Bible in his hand and glasses still on his nose."

  "text" : "The Hon. William Firth (21 July 1768 – 25 February 1838) was a Canadian lawyer, judge and political figure in Upper Canada. Son of merchant William Firth and his wife Elizabeth, Firth studied law and became a barrister. He married Anne Watts, and they had five children. Firth wrote four political pamphlets between 1794 and 1825, all published in Norwich. In 1803, he was appointed steward of Norwich, where he acted as city counsel and presided over the sheriff’s court. He resigned soon after being commissioned as attorney general of Upper Canada through the influence of William Windham, colonial secretary on the 19 March 1807. Firth arrived at York (Toronto) in time to take up his duties as attorney general in November 1807. His office had been vacant for over a year, since the appointment in January 1806 of his predecessor, Thomas Scott, as chief justice of the province. D'Arcy Boulton, the solicitor general, performed the duties of the attorney general in the interim. In April 1808, Firth asked for a transfer to Lower Canada as chief justice, but his application failed. In 1809, Firth began to ask for more money from Lieutenant Governor Francis Gore's administration, as his stipend was £300 sterling a year – about half the cost of his removal to Upper Canada. By 1811, Firth's attempts to increase his fees had made him nearly friendless in the provincial administration. In March 1811, Firth claimed that all legal instruments under the great seal of the province were invalid without his signature. Firth's accounts for unauthorized court attendances were disallowed by the Board of Audit. He applied for a leave of absence to argue his case in London, was refused permission by Gore. He departed for England regardless in September 1811, and the Lieutenant-Governor suspended him, and informed Lord Liverpool, in a letter dated September 30, 1811, that \"too much care cannot be exercised in choosing a successor to Mr. Firth.\" Gore recommended his dismissal. Lord Bathurst decided that Firth was entitled to half his salary and fees from the date he left the province until 13 April 1812, when his removal from office was confirmed. Firth returned to his legal practice. In 1817, he was promoted to \"serjeant at law\", and he ended his career where it had begun, on the Norfolk circuit. In 1820, Firth applied for a land grant in Upper Canada, but was refused on the grounds that he was not a resident. He died intestate on February 25, 1838; succumbing to influenza in Norwich."

  "text" : "William \"Bill\" Powell is a Liberal Democrat politician and a member of the National Assembly of Wales between 2011 and 2016. He was elected as the first Welsh Liberal Democrat Assembly Member for the Mid and West Wales region in the elections in May 2011. Since the election he has been Welsh Liberal Democrat Spokesperson for Environment, Sustainable Development and Rural Affairs. Within the Assembly, William has been Chair of the Petitions Committee throughout the 4th Assembly and a member for the Environment and Sustainability Committee. Since 2011 he has represented the Welsh Liberal Democrats in the National Assembly on both the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association (CPA) and the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly (BIPA). William is also Chair of the Cross Party Group on Europe. William has represented Talgarth ward on Powys County Council since 2004 and has been active in rural regeneration projects, including the restoration of Talgarth Mill, of which he is a founder Director. He is also a Member of the FUW, a Governor of Talgarth CP School and Gwernyfed High School. He is also a member of the Lloyd George Society, where he serves on the Committee. He is a former member of the Brecon Beacons National Park Authority. For many years William has been one of the central figures in the European Movement in Wales. He was a founding Board Member of Wales in Europe and is an active Member of Wales Council European Movement, which he chaired for over a decade. In addition, he is a Council Member of the European Liberal Democrats (ALDE) which includes Liberal sister-parties from across Europe. In 1999 he stood for the pro European Conservatives in the European election in Wales but joined the Liberal Democrats shortly afterwards. A close friend of the late Lord Richard Livsey, he has been central to the Welsh Liberal Democrats presence in Brecon and Radnor since the turn of the 21st century. Having been introduced to it by the late Lord Livsey, William has consistently attended the annual Cilmeri commemoration to mark the last battle of Prince Llywelyn. William attended Talgarth Community Primary School and Gwernyfed High School, gaining a scholarship to read Modern Languages (French and German) at Pembroke College, Oxford. He is a qualified teacher and has taught French and German at a number of schools in Wales and the Marches. Latterly, William was Head of German at Hereford Sixth Form College, where he was also the European Officer. He now lives with his family on their farm in the Black Mountains near Talgarth, Powys, where his ancestors have farmed since the 18th Century. In 1998 he was awarded County Winner of the Royal Welsh Agricultural Society Agri-Environment Award. In 2015 William was shortlisted for the Wales Green Energy Awards in recognition for his tireless support for renewable energy throughout his time as an Assembly Member. He speaks positively and consistently about the topic during Plenary sessions, and has worked with energy companies to try and advance their case, whilst at the same time ensuring that the communities and businesses he represents have their voices heard. As Chair of the Assembly’s Petitions Committee, he has been central to a number of successful petitions, including one on term-time school holidays, one calling for the construction of a second Dyfi bridge and a further one which successfully resulted in the reinstatement of the Diabetes Reference Group for Powys. In January 2014, the BBC and Western Mail  reported that William Powell had been given a formal warning by the Liberal Democrats for inappropriate behaviour towards a young female party activist. In July 2014, William Powell hit out at Alun Davies AM for seeking to gain personal information on him and four other Assembly Members, Andrew RT Davies, Llyr Huws Gruffydd, Kirsty Williams and Antoinette Sandbach, regarding EU farming subsidies received by their respective family businesses. The Minister’s actions led directly to his sacking by First Minister Carwyn Jones and Alun Davies subsequently issued a personal apology to all AMs involved.regarding EU farming subsidies received by their respective family businesses."

Morgan's career spanned some of the most influential developments in the history of American photography. He was instrumental in introducing the first 35mm camera in the US, was an early director of photography at MOMA, and was the first to exhibit the Farm Security Administration photographers. He was also a writer and editor of technical publications on photography (from the Leica Manual, to Ansel Adams’ Basic Photo Series, Encyclopedia of Photography, to Encyclopædia Britannica), and was a photo editor at LIFE and later a photo editor at Look."

He became a member of the Worshipful Company of Mercers and a director of the East India Company. In 1626 he was imprisoned for refusing to pay the forced loan. He was a member of the congregation of St Stephen Coleman Street, and the Massachusetts Bay Company two strongly puritan organisations which were opposed to Crown and Church between 1629 and 1640. In November 1640, Spurstow was elected Member of Parliament for Shrewsbury in the Long Parliament. He served on the Committees for Scandalous Ministers, and the Committee for Plundered Ministers’. He sat until his death in 1644. Spurstow died a wealthy man with his cash alone amounting to over £5,000. He left charitable donations which included £300 to Shrewbury to set poor up in work."

He was an amiratus (admiral) of the Kingdom of Sicily in the late 12th and early 13th centuries, during the reign of the Hohenstaufen dynasty. His family, the Malconvenant, originated in Coutances (Normandy), was one of the oldest Norman baronial families in Sicily.

  "text" : "William Fermor, 1st Baron Leominster (1648–7 December 1711), was an English connoisseur. Fermor was the eldest son of Sir William Fermor, 1st Baronet, of Easton Neston, Northamptonshire, by Mary, daughter of Hugh Perry of London and widow of Henry Noel, second son of Edward Noel, 2nd Viscount Campden. He succeeded as second baronet in 1661, was elected MP for Northampton in 1671 and again in 1679, and was elevated to the peerage, 12 April 1692, by the title of Baron Leominster of Leominster, Herefordshire. He was thrice married: first to Jane, daughter of Andrew Barker of Fairford, Gloucestershire, by whom he had a daughter, Elizabeth, who died unmarried in March 1705; secondly, to the Hon. Catherine Poulett, daughter of John Poulett, 3rd Baron Poulett, by whom he had Mary, married to Sir John Wodehouse, 4th Baronet, of Kimberley, Norfolk; and, thirdly, to Lady Sophia Osborne, daughter of Thomas Osborne, 1st Duke of Leeds, and widow of Donogh, Lord Ibrackan, grandson and heir of Henry O'Brien, 7th Earl of Thomond. By this lady, who survived until 8 December 1746, he had a son, Thomas, and four daughters. Leominster built the house and planned the gardens and plantations at Easton Neston. The house was completed by Nicholas Hawksmoor in 1702, about twenty years after the erection of the wings by Sir Christopher Wren. He adorned the whole with part of the Arundel marbles which he had purchased and which his son attempted to restore with the assistance of the Italian sculptor Giovanni Battista Guelfi, 'a scholar of Camillo Rusconi.' The collection was afterwards greatly neglected. ‘Coming back,’ writes Horace Walpole to George Montagu on 20 May 1736, ‘we saw Easton Neston, where in an old greenhouse is a wonderful fine statue of Tully haranguing a numerous assembly of decayed emperors, vestal virgins with new noses, Colossus's, Venus's, headless carcases, and carcaseless heads, pieces of tombs, and hieroglyphics’. The marbles were presented in 1755 to the University of Oxford by Henrietta Louisa, countess of Pomfret. A description of Easton Neston and its art treasures is included in the Catalogue of the Duke of Buckingham's Pictures, 4to, London, 1758 (pp. 53–66). Leominster died on 7 December 1711, and was succeeded by his only son, Thomas, who was advanced to an earldom 27 December 1721 by the title of Earl of Pomfret, or Pontefract, Yorkshire."

Walsh was born in that portion of the colonial Province of Canada which would later become the province of Ontario. Upon attending public schools in his hometown of Simcoe, Walsh studied at the University of Toronto graduating in 1878 and then at Osgoode Hall Law School. After being called to the bar, he joined a practice in Orangeville, where he also held municipal offices as mayor and councillor. Drawn in by the Gold Rush, he then relocated to the Yukon where he established a practice with two others. Shortly after being created a King's Counsel in 1903, Walsh moved south to Calgary, where he quickly established another practice. He remained in that firm for 8 years, before being appointed to the Supreme Court of Alberta in 1912. He was appointed Lieutenant Governor in 1931 and would serve in the office until 1936, when he was succeeded by his friend, Philip Primrose. He then retired to Victoria, British Columbia, where he died in 1938."

  "text" : "Walter Stanley Mooneyham (14 January 1926 in Houston, Mississippi, United States – 3 June 1991 in Los Angeles, California, USA) Dr. Stan Mooneyham was a remarkable evangelical visionary with an even more remarkable heart for seeing and meeting global needs of the world's most hurting populations. He cared deeply for suffering people and tangibly secured relief for them in the most direct ways possible. He authored the books, \"Is There Life Before Death?\", \"Come Walk the World, \"China: A New Day\", \"Sea of Heartbreak\" and \"Dancing on the Strait and Narrow\". The world was his home, traveling 70% of the time. He had unprecedented success in gaining audiences with world leaders to initiate needed humanitarian change, saving many lives in the process. While with National Association of Evangelicals, he started as Editor of 'United Evangelical Action (1959–1964), later he was Vice President of the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association', during which time he moved his family to Berlin, Germany to direct the first World Congress on Evangelism. After this success, they moved to Singapore for the Southeast Asia Congress on Evangelism. '(1967–1969) He then became President of the Christian humanitarian NGO World Vision (1969–1982). Mooneyham thought of himself not as liberal or conservative but as pragmatist and his positions were similar to the positions of the U.S. Senator Mark Hatfield, an evangelical who was conservative on issues like abortion but who sided also often with liberals, such as his opposition to the Vietnam War and who was on the board of World Vision at this time. During Mooneyham's leadership, World Vision developed from a small organization near bankruptcy to an organization with a budget of several hundred million dollars. In addition to disaster relief, World Vision introduced a form of development work during Mooneyham's presidency, where evangelism is regarded as an integral part of the organization's operations; Mooneyham viewed evangelism and assistance as going hand in hand. In 1982, after the invasion of Lebanon by Israeli forces, Mooneyham personally lead a convoy to the Palestinian refugee camps near Sidon and Tyre. Being appalled by the conditions and treatment of the people, he protested the Israeli actions and issued statements to the U.S. press, which were published. These actions caused severe attacks from conservative evangelicals as well as from the Israeli Prime-minister Menachem Begin. Although under pressure, Mooneyham did not retract his statements but to the contrary arranged for the publication of a report about the situation in the September issue of World Vision Magazine. In the same month, he resigned as president of World Vision International after severe criticism within the World Vision Board; according to Ken Waters (a World Vision employee at that time), accusations ranged from a dictatorial leadership style to an ethnocentric American communication style. New president of World Vision International became the conservative evangelical Ted Engstrom. After his resignation, Mooneyham became a pastor in Palm Desert, California."

He met the Bashorun of Abeokuta, who told him that the recent robberies of traders' property were due to the war with Ibadan. It was the custom to suppress trading so as to force the men to war, and the plunder would cease when the war was over. In the meantime, traders should not travel to Abeokuta since their safety could not be guaranteed. Mulliner died on 25 July 1863 while on board the African mail steamer Ethiope near Bathurst, aged 29.He was replaced as Acting Governor by John Hawley Glover. William was the fourth and youngest son of Northampton Coach Maker and Coach Master, Francis Mulliner (1789–1841) and his wife née Jane Manton (1796–1875).

In November 1640, Morley was elected MP for Chichester in the Long Parliament. On the outbreak of the Civil War, he put a garrison into Chichester, and was thereupon disabled from sitting in Parliament on 23 November 1642. Morley lived at Halnaker.

  "text" : "Wilhelm Karpenstein (born 24 May 1903 in Frankfurt am Main – died 2 May 1968 in Lauterbach, Hesse) was a German Nazi Party politician. He served as Gauleiter of Pomerania during the early days of the Third Reich. Karpenstein was elected to the Reichstag in the 1930 election and served as a Nazi Party deputy until the end of the Second World War. He was appointed the party's Gauleiter in Pomerania in 1931. Immediately after the Nazis came to power a significant amount of autonomy lay with the gauleiters and their radicalism threatened to disrupt the relationship between Adolf Hitler and the middle classes that had helped to ensure his election. Karpenstein was one of the few who did not offer this problem as he was conservative and pro-middle class. Nevertheless, he did not miss the opportunity to increase his personal power in the early days of Nazism and sought to make all of the churches, government officials and media outlets in Pomerania answerable to him directly. Karpenstein however, despite not holding left-wing economic ideas, was too weak to control the dissident sentiments emerging from the Sturmabteilung in Pomerania, which was one of their power bases. As a result, Karpenstein was one of those to be purged during the Night of the Long Knives, although his lack of direct involvement with the SA meant that he was not killed but rather sacked in favour of Franz Schwede-Coburg. Ostensibly however Karpenstein was dismissed for his supposed links to Gregor Strasser and his failure to work with Hermann Göring."

Born at Antwerp about the year 1647, he was trained as a jeweller, but as an amateur practised in miniature, enamel, and oil-colours. Having painted some altar-pieces at Antwerp, his business called him to Dunkirk, where he painted a picture, for the chapel of the English nuns, who were so pleased with it, that they persuaded De Keyser to go to England, and gave him letters of recommendation to Lord Melfort, then in favour with James II. The enthusiastic painter could not resist the proposal; he embarked on board an English vessel, and, unknown to his wife or family, sailed for England. His reception was equal to his wishes. He was introduced to the king, who promised to countenance him, and several persons of rank, who had known him at Antwerp, encouraged him in his new vocation. Transported with this prospect he sent for his wife, ordering her to dismiss his workmen, and convert his effects into money. Within half a year the bubble burst; the Revolution happened, De Keyser's friends could no longer be his protectors, his business decreased, and the pursuit of the philosopher's stone, to which he had recourse in his despair, completed his ruin. He died at the age of forty-five, about the year 1692. He left a daughter, whom he had taken great pains to instruct, and with success. She painted small portraits in oil, and copied well."

Shellabear, as he was generally known, first went to Malaya as a British soldier, then returned as a Methodist missionary, where he worked from 1891-1948. “He introduced and guided changes in attitudes towards Malays and Islam, which made it possible for Methodist missionaries to relate positively to Malays while maintaining the integrity of their evangelistic outreach.” He helped Westerners appreciate “how Malay spirituality represented a genuine commitment to Islam, despite its failure to conform to the expectations of [Western] Orientalists”. His appreciation of Malay language and culture made him promote Malay language schools, which brought him into disagreement with many missionaries who preferred to organize and teach at English-language schools. He produced a voluminous amount of writings, some of which were aimed at Christian Malays, some for Muslims Malays, some for missionaries coming to Malaya, and some for scholars. These included Sejarah Melayu (Malay Annals), Hikayat Abdullah (The Life of Abdullah bin Abdul Kadir), a Malay hymnal, dictionary and grammar of Malay, and a translation of Pilgrim’s Progress. He also collaborated with a Malay scholar, Sulaiman bin Muhammed Nur, in joint publications such as Kitab Kiliran Budi (The Book of Wisdom, a collection of proverbs) and Hikayat Hang Tuah (The Life of Hang Tuah). \"His grammar, dictionary, and Bible translation remained in print for decades\". His scholarly activities involved him in the Straits Philosophical Society, the Straits Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society, and the faculty of Hartford Seminary. He was born in Norfolk, England and died in Hartford, Connecticut after retiring from the Seminary in 1936. Shellabear is the founder of MPH Group, a publication house that was founded on 1890, as Amelia Bishop Press. He is also associated with the founding of the Straits Chinese Methodist Church, now the Kampong Kapor Methodist Church in Singapore."

Lang partnered with Marshall Pugh to from Lang & Pugh in 1889. The firm also employed Reinhard Schuetze for a time. Lang's business interests, like his father's, often faced financial stumbles and may have collapsed following the Panic of 1893. He moved to Illinois and in 1897. His medical records describe him as suffering from severe depression and as manic depressive. Lang was born in Ohio in 1846. Early in his career he designed at least three buildings in Kansas including Albion School in Albion, Nebraska. He moved to Denver in 1886. Lang is known for his use of turrets, gargoyles, polychromatic stone, and a mixture of columns. He ran into financial and related legal troubles. His business collapsed and he seems to have lost his mental faculties. He was hit and killed by a train. Lang's presentation book is at the Western History Collection of the Denver Public Library. He married Delia and had one daughter, Mabel."

Rapp edited Die Turn Zeitung in Philadelphia and Cincinnati, then moved to Baltimore in 1857 to become editor of the Baltimore Wecker. Rapp's anti-secessionist and anti-slavery views made him the target of mob violence, and in 1861 he narrowly escaped lynching by fleeing to Washington D.C. disguised as a minister. While in Washington, Rapp met with Abraham Lincoln, who offered him the position of postmaster general. Rapp declined, instead moving to Chicago to become editor of the Illinois Staats-Zeitung. Rapp remained in Chicago until his death at age 80 on February 28, 1907. He and his wife Gesine had three daughters: Emilie, Frida, and Mathilda, and a son, William Jr."

  "text" : "Col. William Thompson (1846–1934) was an American-Indian fighter and journalist, the editor of multiple newspapers in Oregon and California, having his longest run with the Alturas Plaindealer. Thompson was born in Missouri on February 2, 1846, the son of Samuel George Thompson. He immigrated to Oregon in 1852, studying at Columbia College in Eugene, Oregon before beginning a career in journalism that led him to travel extensively and, between 1870 and 1910, to be one of the few to cover the periodic incidents of internal strife that affected Central Oregon. His first work in the newspaper business was with the Eugene City Guard where he worked for a year and a half. Then he sold his stake in The Guard for $1,200 and started the Roseburg Plaindealer. In 1871, he was involved in a shootout with Henry R. Gale, the editor of a rival newspaper in Roseburg; he sustained severe injuries but survived while his opponent did not. He later wrote of the confrontation: Theirs was an old established paper, conducted by two brothers, Henry and Thomas Gale. They soon saw their business slipping away and sought to regain it by indulging in abuse of the coarsest character. I paid no further attention to their attacks than to occasionally poke fun at them. One Saturday evening I met one of the brothers in the post office. He began an abusive harangue and attempted to draw a pistol. I quickly caught his hand and struck him in the face. Bystanders separated us and he left. I was repeatedly warned that evening to be on my guard, but gave the matter little concern. The next morning, Sunday, June 11, 1871, I went to my office as was my custom, to write my letters and attend to some other matters before going to church. On leaving the office I was joined by a young friend, Mr. Virgil Conn. As we proceeded down the street towards the post office I saw the brothers standing talking on the street. One looked up and saw me, evidently spoke to his brother, and they then started toward me. I saw at once that it was to be a fight and that I must defend myself. Some said I could have avoided a meeting by turning in a different direction. Probably I could, at least for a time, but I had started to the post office and there I intended to go. As we approached the young men, one of them dropped behind, and as I passed the first one he dealt me a blow with a heavy cane. At the same instant the other drew a pistol and fired, the bullet taking effect in my side and passing partly through. Stunned by the blow on my cheek, I reeled and drawing my pistol fired point blank at the breast of the one who had shot me. I was then between the men, and turning on the one with the cane, he threw up his hands, as if to say \"I am unarmed.\" As I again turned he quickly drew his revolver and shot me in the back of the head, and followed it up with another shot which was aimed at the butt of my ear. I felt the muzzle of the revolver pressed against my ear, and throwing up my head the bullet entered my neck and passed up through my mouth and tongue and lodged back of my left eye. As I rushed at him he fired again, the bullet entering the point of my shoulder while another entered my body. That was his last shot. Many gave Thompson up for dead, but with the help of a surgeon, he soon recovered. The shootout caused quite a stir and was referred to by many publications at the time as \"The Oregon Style\". In 1872 Thompson sold the Roseburg Plaindealer for $4000 and took up control of the Salem Mercury, about which he wrote: \"My success there as a newspaper man was all that could be desired. A large circulation was rapidly built up, and a daily as well as weekly started.\" His final stint in the newspaper business was with the Alturas Plaindealer, where he worked for twenty years, selling his stake in 1915 to R. A. French, his partner. In 1912 he published his autobiography, Reminiscences of a Pioneer, which concluded: The events here recorded were seen with my own eyes, or were received from the lips of the actors therein. Hundreds of men and boys passed through equal or greater dangers and privations than I, and are entitled to equal or greater credit. Reared in the wilderness and on the frontier of civilization, I was merely the product of environment, and lay claim to no particular distinction above those who were my companions. And yet, as I look back over the past, I must be excused for a feeling of pride in having been a part, however insignificant, in the building here on the western rim of the continent, of the mighty Empire of the Pacific. To have seen proud cities rear their heads from a wilderness—from a cluster of log huts in a primeval forest—whose everlasting stillness was alone broken by the yells of savage men, the long howl of the wolf and the scream of the panther—is something to have lived for. And yet I question if those who now possess this land of plenty—this land of \"milk and honey\" ever give a thought for those who \"Conquered the Wilderness\" and made it a fit and safe abode for the millions of civilized men and women who now enjoy its blessings. Thompson married Elizabeth Charlotte Shannon in August 1869. They were married until her death in 1919 and had two children, Asher and Sallie. He died on May 24, 1934, of bronchial pneumonia at his home in Alturas."

  "text" : "Wardah Hafidz (pronounced [ˈwardah ˈhafɪdz]) is an Indonesian activist lobbying for the rights of the nation's urban poor. She currently serves as coordinator of the Urban Poor Consortium (UPC) and was formerly its head. She is protagonist in the 2013 documentary Jakarta Disorder about gentrification and democratization in Jakarta. She raised controversy in 1999 after announcing that numerous groups had misused social security funds during the elections, calling it \"money politics\". The accused groups included the Public Participation Center, Women's Participation Cooperative, the People's Sovereignty Party, and Suharto's former ruling party Golkar. Hafidz said that she was \"terrorized\" after the disclosures and told to vacate her office as it was located in a residential zone. For her work in promoting human rights in Indonesia, Hafidz won the 2000 Yap Thiam Hien Award, an annual human rights prize named for Chinese-Indonesian activist Yap Thiam Hien. In 2002, Hafidz accused the Betawi Brotherhood Forum (BBF) of accepting payment for rallying at Jakarta City Hall after the BBF chased flood-victims organized by UPC with swords and sticks. In response, the head of the Betawi Brotherhood Forum, A. Fadloli El Muhir, publicly threatened to have her arrested, beaten, and escorted to Monas (the National Monument) to clarify her statements. Hafidz ignored the threats, stating that the military and authorities should not use the masses to protect their own interests. Hafidz alleged in 2003 that the Indonesian government had unclear mechanisms for the distribution of subsidized rice. She stated that the lack of a clear mechanism left the program open for misuse, with the public distribution \"mere window-dressing\". In 2005, she won the Gwangju Prize for Human Rights, awarded by the South Korean May 18 Memorial Foundation to recognize \"individuals, groups or institutions in Korea and abroad that have contributed in promoting and advancing human rights, democracy and peace through their work.\" In 2009, Hafidz organized and presided over a mock trial of the Asian Development Bank for its policies on agriculture, debt, water, gender, the environment, and indigenous people."

In 1843 he emigrated with his parents to a farm near Cape Town. By the age of thirteen he had joined the Cape Mounted Rifles and was in this capacity aboard HMS Birkenhead, his unit being sent to fight in the war in the eastern province. According to an account of the incident: \n* When the ship went down he swiftly got away from the wreck and being a powerful swimmer he struck out for the shore and after a time managed to join another soldier holding on to a floating spar. The waves threw them on to the rocks where they rested for a while then made for the shore which they reached bruised and bleeding. After recovery he was sent to serve in the Kaffir wars. After the wars, he worked unsuccessfully in the gold and diamond fields. In 1877 he was commandeered into the Diamond Field Horse, where he gained the rank of Sergeant. His last military action was as a member of the Beaconsfield Town Arms during the siege of Kimberley. Retiring from the military, McCluskey worked for De Beers as a security guard, at Bultfontein. Here he was beaten to death in October 1903. Michael Mongale was found guilty of his murder but escaped the death penalty due to insanity, instead serving life."

  "text" : "William Patterson MacCracken, Jr. (September 17, 1888 - September 1969) was a pioneer aviator. MacCracken became the first federal regulator of commercial aviation when then-Secretary of Commerce Herbert Hoover named him the first Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Aeronautics in 1926. During World War I he had served as a flight instructor, had served on the Chicago Aeronautical Commission, and was a member of the board of governors of the National Aeronautical Association when selected by Hoover. After helping to draft key safety standards and regulations that became part of the 1930 Air Mail Act, MacCracken returned to his private law practice, where he continued to be involved in the growth of commercial aviation by representing many major airlines. For that reason Postmaster General Walter F. Brown asked him to preside over what was later scandalized as the Spoils Conference, to work out an agreement between the carriers and the Post office to consolidate air mail routes into transcontinental networks operated by the best-equipped and financially stable companies. This relationship left both exposed to charges of favoritism. When MacCracken refused later to testify before Congress, he was declared a lobbyist and found in contempt of Congress for allowing clients to rip up subpoenaed documents. MacCracken filed a petition of habeas corpus in federal courts to overturn his arrest, but after litigation, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that Congress had acted constitutionally, and denied the petition in the case Jurney v. MacCracken."

  "text" : "Will Black is an English writer and journalist with a background in anthropology and mental health care. He has written books related to the anthropology of medicine and religion. In his first book, Beyond the End of the World – 2012 and Apocalypse, Black gives a broad overview of apocalyptic ideologies through the ages, including those underpinning Zoroastrianism, Judaism, Hinduism, Christianity, Islam and smaller new religious movements. He also outlines realities of ancient and modern Maya societies while satirising elements of New Age culture. Black studied in Bristol, Cambridge and London - where he also trained as a journalist. He has researched shamanism, cults and apocalyptic movements in the UK and overseas. His early research into 2012 centred on the Planet Art Network (PAN), a New Age movement that started in California. In Beyond the End of the World, Black subjects PAN, its founder Jose Arguelles and their Mayan-inspired calendar ‘Dreamspell’ to scrutiny. He concludes that Argüelles and other Dreamspell promoters have appropriated elements of Mayan culture, often without crediting the Maya for their crucial contribution. Black suggests that this has had the effect of distracting the public from the real Mayan calendar and Mayan insights into spirituality and apocalyptic thought. Black draws a parallel between the New Age appropriation and distortion of the Mayan calendar with the New Age appropriation of shamanism, where intense and dangerous practices traditionally performed by highly trained ritual specialists on behalf of tribal societies, are taught, often by New Age enthusiasts, to prosperous workshop attendees. Arguing in Beyond the End of the World, that the public’s focus should be centred on the Maya rather than self-proclaimed New Age prophets, such as Jose Argüelles, Black contrasts the living conditions of many Central Americans with the relative comfort and safety enjoyed by many New Age enthusiasts. Drawing on the work of fellow journalists, Black gives an account of the brutal cocaine wars destroying many thousands of lives each year in Mayan countries, such as Mexico and Guatemala. Taking issue with those who used the internet to circulate the belief that the world will end in 2012, Black emphasised that apocalypse means \"uncovering\" rather than \"doomsday\" and he pointed out that the Maya themselves did not anticipate the world ending in 2012. His second book, Psychopathic Cultures and Toxic Empires, examines the influence powerful psychopaths have on societies. Examples given of what Black terms psychopathic and toxic cultures include those within paedophile rings, politics, finance, gangs, security services, religious organisations and the media. He suggests that not only are high-functioning psychopaths drawn to positions of power, but they also have considerable influence in shaping human cultures and institutions of all sizes, to the extent that compliant non-psychopaths may continue conforming to a 'psychopathic culture' even after a psychopath that dominated it has moved on. Within the book and during a 2015 interview with academic and author Guy Mankowski Black uses examples from finance, the mass media and abuse rings to point out that ordinary citizens in many countries have a greater capacity than ever to expose wrongdoing and overcome abuses of power."

In 1733 he assisted James Oglethorpe in the founding of the new Province of Georgia, laying out the town of Savannah. His father Stephen Bull was Lord Ashley's deputy and one of the leaders of the expedition which came from England in 1670 and settled Charles Town. He was married to Mary Quintyne and his descendants include a son, also named William Bull, who was also a South Carolina acting governor, as well as William Henry Drayton and Charles Drayton, sons of his daughter Charlotta Bull and John Drayton. A monument to Governor Bull (c. 1791) is located at Ashley Hall Plantation, listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1975.In the aftermath of the Stono rebellion, Lieutenant Governor William Bull wrote to the British King's Royal Council to inform them about the revolt. In his letter, he describes the \"daring\" actions pf the determined Stono rebels, as well as the measures the militia took to subdue the rebellion. He also proposed that the council employ Indian slave hunters to track down runaway slaves."

By 1981, Ruis moved from the KRO to the VARA, trading in his Willem Ruis Show for the Willem Ruis Lottoshow. Ruis was unhappy with his director at the KRO, who he felt did not allow him to show off all his talents, and got a contract with the VARA, which was losing viewers to the competition and was looking for a star to bolster its roster. He was paid a salary unheard of at the time (Hfl 300,000 per year, high enough to lead to questions in parliament). He also tried a career in movies, but his only appearance, in the Belgian/Dutch production Het Beest (1982), could not save the movie from becoming a \"legendary flop\". He explained that his career in television was not going to last forever, and his side step to cinema was a career plan for the long-term."

  "text" : "William Henry Gaunt (born in Bradford, Yorkshire, 13 January 1874 – 31 October 1951) was an English transport engineer who began his working life developing and building gas-powered trams. He was educated at Manchester Grammar School before joining the Ashbury Company in Manchester as an apprentice. The works at Ashbury supplied the trams for Britain's first gas-powered tramway, the Blackpool, St Annes and Lytham tramway, operated by the British Gas Traction Company. Gaunt transferred to the tramway company in 1896, and then became manager of a similar gas-powered scheme at Trafford Park in 1896. Following the financial collapse of the Gas Traction Company in 1898 Gaunt was appointed manager of Trafford Park's gas and electric tramways, a position he held until 1905, when the operation of the electric line was taken over by the corporations of Manchester and Salford. Gaunt then moved south to manage the world's first garden city, at Letchworth. During the First World War he worked for the Coal Mines Department of the Board of Trade as a distribution superintendent in charge of coal, gas, and electricity. He subsequently joined J. Lyons & Co. as a transport manager, and eventually rose to become a director of the company. In 1940 Gaunt became transport adviser to the Ministry of Food. Gaunt married Kate (neé Brooks Kearsley) in 1900. The couple had no children, and she died in 1941. He was a member of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers and a Vice-President of the Institute of Transport. He was awarded a C.B.E. in 1938."

  "text" : "William Frederick Purcell (18 September 1866 London - 3 October 1919 Cape Town) was an English-born South African arachnologist and zoologist. He is regarded as being the founder of modern araneology in South Africa. Purcell was awarded a doctorate after studying at a number of German universities. He then took up an appointment as First Assistant at the South African Museum in charge of terrestrial vertebrates. He was the first South African zoologist to start a systematic study of spiders, devising keys and providing full descriptions of species. Up to that time Arthur Stanley Hirst (1883–1930), Pickard-Cambridge and R. I. Pocock of the British Museum had occasionally named spiders sent them from South African sources. Pocock especially was supplied with unknown specimens from Natal and Rhodesia, many coming from Selmar Schonland, the botany professor at Rhodes University. South Africa is a fertile hunting ground for the study of Mygalomorphae or 4-lunged spiders, and both Purcell and R. W. E. Tucker who succeeded him, were drawn to this group, as was J. Hewitt. William and Anna Purcell afford an example of collaboration in arachnology of husband and wife, the other well-known couple being George and Elizabeth Peckham from the States who worked on South African Salticidae. A species of South African gecko, pachydactylus purcelli, is named in his honor. The standard author abbreviation Purcell is used to indicate this individual as the author when citing a zoological name."
