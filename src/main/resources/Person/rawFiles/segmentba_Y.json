  "text" : "Patriarch Yeghishe Derderian (Armenian: Եղիշէ Տէրտէրեան) (21 July 1910 – 1 February 1990) was Armenian Patriarch of Jerusalem serving the Armenian Patriarchate of Jerusalem as bishop under the authority of the Catholicos of Armenia and of all Armenians of the Armenian Apostolic Church from 1960 to 1990. Yeghishe was born Yeghiazar Derderian in Van, then the Ottoman Empire, now Turkey, in 1910. He lost all of his relatives in 1915, during the Armenian genocide. In 1922, he came to Jerusalem at the age of 12, to study at the St. James Theological Seminary. He served eventually as the dean of the seminary, before being named deputy patriarch of Jerusalem upon the death of Patriarch Guregh Israeli (1944–1949). The position of Patriarch of Jerusalem remained vacant from 1949 to 1957 and 1958 to 1960, with a brief period from 1957 to 1958, when Tiran Nersoyan was elected Patriarch, but not consecrated. In 1960, Yeghishe Derderian became the 95th Armenian Patriarch of Jerusalem and served for thirty years until his death in February 1990. His period as patriarch was marred by a number of controversies. Most notably, a financial scandal involving the Patriarchate prompted calls for Derderian's resignation. In August 1983, a five-man church auditing committee issued a report charging Derderian with impropriety in handling church funds. Derderian issued an eighty-page response denying the allegations that he had misappropriated church funds. He continued to serve despite the controversy. Patriarch Derderian was also a scholar. He wrote 22 books including biographies of religious as well as literary figures and also - under his pen name Yeghivart - poems and prose. He died in February 1990 in his residence at the St. James convent and monastery complex in the Armenian Quarter of the Old City from a heart attack after having been ill with the flu for two days. He was 80. He was succeeded by Patriarch Torkom Manoogian, who was enthroned in November 1990."

He took over the position after the patriarchate position remained vacant for 11 years (1910–1921). Born in Constantinople in the district of Uskudar as Mihran Tourian, he was the younger brother of Western Armenian poet and playwright Bedros Tourian. He was a staunch believer in education. In Constantinople, he published a series of textbooks for teaching of Armenian Ընթացք ի գրոց բարբառ, with first volume in 1880 and second volume in 1883, Ընտիր ասացվածք օտարազգի նշանավոր անձանց (1882), Պատմություն հայ մատենագրության (1885). In 1909 he published his poems, and regularly contributed to Armenological studies in various publication under the title Հովվական սրինգ. He was the Armenian Patriarch of Constantinople from 1909–10. Then moved to Jerusalem where he was consecrated as Patriarch. He engaged in vast educational reform and in 1925, established a unified elementary school to accommodate the growing number of children in the community. He also modernized the curriculum of the Armenian Seminary and acquiring highly qualified instructors from the cadre of talented teachers and educators who had come to Jerusalem as refugees after the Armenian Genocide. In 1929, the unified elementary school officially opened its doors. By consolidating disparate locations, including the St. Gayane Girls' School, this new elementary school became the primary Armenian co-educational institution in the Holy Land and was renamed \"School of the Holy Translators\" (in Armenian \"Serpots Tarkmantchats Varjaran\"). Starting 1927, he resumed the publication of Sion (Armenian: Սիոն) as the official organ of the Patriarchate of Jerusalem. His collections and writings were published in Jerusalem in a multi-volume series by \"Matenashar Tourian\" dedicated to his name. It also contained some of his poems under the title Srpazan Knar (Սրբազան քնար). He was awarded an honorary KBE in the British 1930 New Year Honours List. Patriarch Torkom Koushagian wrote a lengthy study about his legacy first in a series in Egyptian Armenian daily Arev and later in a separate publication in Jerusalem. Yeghishe Tourian was succeeded by Patriarch Torkom Koushagian."

  "text" : "Yuri Korneev (March 26, 1937 in Moscow, Soviet Union – 2002), was a Russian basketball player. A 1.98 m tall small forward, he started his career for Dynamo Moscow, but moved to CSKA to become one of its cornerstones in the 1960s. Together with the Red Army's club, Korneev won a Euroleague championship in 1963, scoring 15 crucial points in the tie-break final game against Real Madrid, as the two first contests were not enough to crown a champion. He reached the continental final once again two years later, when Real took their revenge for what had been a bitter loss. In addition to that, Korneev led CSKA to five Soviet Union League titles. A regular of the Soviet Union national basketball team, Korneev won two Eurobasket titles in 1959 and 1961, two Olympic silver medals in 1960 and 1964 as well as a bronze medal at the 1963 FIBA World Championship. Korneev left CSKA in the prime of his career due to a Soviet rule that did not allow players above 25 years old to play for the Army-supported team."

His arrest, initially without charges, generated surprise and protests from circles in Turkey and also the United States, including from Richard Hovannisian of the University of California at Los Angeles, and former US Senator Bob Dole. Türkyilmaz later said that security officials who had arrested him appeared to have thought him involved in espionage, but eventually he was charged with illegally removing books and other materials, more than fifty years old, that he had openly and legally purchased in Armenia, or which had been presented to him as gifts during his research. In August, 2005, Türkyilmaz was set free with a suspended sentence."

He was initially an agrarian rebel under Wang Xianzhi, but later came to serve under the imperial eunuch general Yang Fuguang, becoming Yang Fuguang's adoptive son. He was gradually promoted in the imperial guard ranks, and was eventually made the military governor (Jiedushi) of Shannan West by Emperor Xizong. After his adoptive uncle Yang Fugong broke with Emperor Xizong's brother and successor Emperor Zhaozong in 891, however, Yang Shouliang followed Yang Fugong's lead and resisted the imperial government. He was subsequently defeated by the warlord Li Maozhen the military governor of Fengxiang Circuit (鳳翔, headquartered in modern Baoji, Shaanxi) and executed."

As an engineer specializing in lasers, Yves Gentet first worked on holographic targeting systems of the French fighter plane Dassault Rafale. In 1995, he developed a method called Ultimate, which allows the creation of muticolored holograms. It consists of three lasers (red, blue and green) instead of the usual technique of using only a red laser. This novel technique relies on an emulsion of silver particles in a gelatin, which is able to store many more interference fringes than the previous methods due to the silver particles' diameter (a few nanometers)."

  "text" : "Yukio Ishizuka (born June 14, 1938, in Hakodate, Japan) is a psychiatrist who grew up in Japan and graduated from Keio Medical School. He completed his internship at Jefferson Medical College Hospital in Philadelphia and his residency in psychiatry at Harvard Medical School's Massachusetts Mental Health Center in 1969. Ishizuka was a clinical assistant Professor of Psychiatry at NYU Medical Center. In 2007, the Japanese International Medical Student Association Ishizuka founded as a medical student received the coveted Health Culture Award at the Japanese Imperial Palace. He is the author of the Japanese book, Self-Actualization and has been a full-time practicing psychiatrist in New York since 1976. In 1969, when Ishizuka completed his residency in Boston, psychoanalysis was at its zenith in American psychiatry, with many professors having undergone psychoanalytical training. Harvard Professor David Riesman encouraged Ishizuka to undergo further training in psychoanalysis under Erich Fromm. Impressed by Fromm’s initial definition of health, but questioning that psycho-analytic psychology with its emphasis on one’s past was clinically effective, Ishizuka hesitated. Not convinced that undergoing seven years of psychoanalysis could help him better understand health or happiness, he left psychiatry. His French wife, Colette, who later inspired much of his work on intimacy and the role a spouse or comparable intimate partner plays in it, supported his decision to follow his intuition. In 1969 he joined McKinsey and Company, an international consulting firm, as an associate in Paris. In 1972, he left consulting to become President and Co-founder of a subsidiary of Mitsubishi International Corp for mergers and acquisitions. During his fourth year in M&A, a business colleague sought his advice on how to overcome depression. Dr. Ishizuka’s rewarding experience helping his friend led him to return to the field of psychiatry in 1976. Ishizuka returned to medicine with a desire to understand what it meant to be well."

The only difference is that the Mesopotamian civilization had cultural continuity while the Jiroft civilization suffered from ups and downs for natural reasons. Thus it emerged in a certain period and was buried at a later time.\" He retired from University of Tehran after Iranian Revolution and now lives in France."

From 1980 until 1996 he spent time in prison in Syria for his membership in the left-wing opposition group Syrian Communist Party (Political Bureau), which he calls a \"communist pro-democracy group\". However, he has also stated that his time in prison allowed him to break out of the \"internal prisons [of] narrow political affiliation [and] rigid ideology\", and has called the Syrian revolution an \"open-ended and multi-leveled struggle\", while remaining supportive of aspects of Marxism. He was arrested while he was studying medicine in Aleppo and spent sixteen years in prison, the last in Tadmur Prison. He took his final examination as a general medical practitioner in 2000, but never practiced. He has been granted a Prince Claus Award for 2012 as \"actually a tribute to the Syrian people and the Syrian revolution. He was not able to collect the award as he is living hiding in the underground in Syria. He was one of the talkers in a two-day anti-capitalist forum, which was held in Ankara, Turkey, on Nov 23rd-24th, 2013. Additionally, he was speaking at the event 'Reporting Change - Stories from the Arab region' in Amsterdam on 15 June 2014, an event jointly organized by Human Rights Watch and World Press Photo. Al-Haj Saleh is married to Samira Khalil, a communist dissident, former political detainee and a revolutionary activist abducted in Douma in December 2013. After 21 months of hiding in Damascus and whole Syria, for being wanted by both the government and radical Islamist militants, he fled to Turkey. He now currently lives in Istanbul."

She is best known for her association with the artist Marc Chagall, which resulted in over 40 tapestries, but she also created tapestries of art works by Pablo Picasso, Max Ernst, Roberto Matta, Paul Klee, Fernand Léger, Wassily Kandinsky, Brassai, Alexander Calder, Niki de Saint Phalle, and others. Cauquil-Prince attended the Académie Royale des Beaux-Arts (ARBA) in Belgium, but her mastery of tapestry weaving was largely self-taught, inspired by her study of Coptic textiles and tapestries from the Renaissance and Middle Ages. She established her first studio in Paris in the late 1950s and later worked in Corsica. In 1963 Marie Cuttoli engaged Cauquil-Prince to weave Picasso tapestries, under the condition that she would remain in the background and never meet the artist personally. One of these tapestries, La Fermière, is now in the Picasso Museum at Antibes. Cauquil-Prince was awarded the Chevalier of the Ordre national du Mérite in 1977 by the French government."

  "text" : "Yingluck Shinawatra (Thai: ยิ่งลักษณ์ ชินวัตร, rtgs: Yinglak Chinnawat, pronounced [jîŋ.lák tɕʰīn.ná.wát]; born 21 June 1967), nicknamed Pu (Thai: ปู, pronounced [pūː], meaning \"crab\"), is a Thai businesswoman and politician, a member of the Pheu Thai Party who became the 28th Prime Minister of Thailand following the 2011 general election. Yingluck was Thailand's first female Prime Minister and its youngest in over 60 years. She was removed from office on 7 May 2014 by a Constitutional Court decision that found her guilty on a charge of abuse of power. Born in Chiang Mai Province into a wealthy family of Hakka Chinese descent, Yingluck Shinawatra earned a bachelor's degree from Chiang Mai University and a master's degree from Kentucky State University, both in public administration. She then became an executive in the businesses founded by her elder brother, Thaksin Shinawatra, and later became the president of property developer SC Asset and managing director of Advanced Info Service. Thaksin served as Prime Minister from 2001 until 2006 when he was overthrown by a military coup. He fled abroad shortly before he was convicted in absentia of using his position to increase his own wealth. He has since lived in self-imposed exile to avoid his sentence in prison. In May 2011, the Pheu Thai Party, which maintains close ties to Thaksin, nominated Yingluck as their candidate for Prime Minister in the 2011 general election. She campaigned on a platform of national reconciliation, poverty eradication, and corporate income tax reduction and won a landslide victory. After mass protests against her government in late 2013, she asked for a dissolution of parliament on 9 December 2013, triggering a snap election, but continued to act as caretaker prime minister. On 7 May 2014, the Constitutional Court of Thailand removed Yingluck Shinawatra from the office of caretaker prime minister and defence minister following months of political crisis. The court found her guilty of charges of abuse of power over the transfer of national security chief Thawil Pliensri in 2011 to make way for a Pheu Thai supporter. In the wake of the May 2014 military coup, Yingluck was arrested along with former cabinet ministers and political leaders of all parties and held at an army camp for a few days while the coup was consolidated."

His tower churches in Ubory and Troitse-Lykovo \"may owe something to prototypes in wooden Russian architecture\". They are built of brick and decorated with profuse white stone ornamentation. A soaring white tower in front of New Jerusalem Monastery was also built from Bukhvostov's designs. Other buildings attributed to him include the Fili and Zyuzino churches. Some of the attributions are far fetched, since \"there is documentary evidence of his being in charge of constructing only a handful of buildings\"."

He was the gold medallist over 100 metres at the 2006 Asian Games and represented Saudi Arabia at the 2007 World Championships in Athletics. His best for the distance is 10.28 seconds. He made his first appearance on the world stage at the age of fifteen, competing in the 100 metres and 200 metres events at the 2001 World Youth Championships in Athletics. The following year he won the 100 m at the Gulf Cooperation Council Youth Championships and was the silver medallist at the Pan Arab Junior Championships. He reached the quarter-finals of the 100 m at the 2002 World Junior Championships in Athletics. He rose to prominence alongside fellow Saudi sprinter Yahya Al-Gahes, as Habeeb was the 100 m runner-up behind him at the 2003 World Youth Championships in Athletics and then the 2004 Asian Junior Athletics Championships. Habeeb tested positive for the banned substance Prednisolone on the Asian Grand Prix circuit in 2004 and as a result he received a public warning and his mark at the competition was disqualified. He ran at the 2004 World Junior Championships in Athletics later that season and was a semi-finalist. After a quiet 2005, he set a personal best of 10.28 seconds in Doha in May 2006. He went on to claim the national title and then won the 100 m at the 2006 Asian Games, defeating Naoki Tsukahara who was the pre-race favourite. He also helped the Saudi Arabian men to sixth place in the 4×100 metres relay. He began 2007 with individual and relay wins over 100 m at the Arab Championships. He competed at the 2007 Asian Athletics Championships and the 2007 World Championships in Athletics, but failed to progress beyond the qualifying rounds at either competition. He was chosen for the relay team at the 2007 Pan Arab Games and won the gold medal alongside Moussa Al-Housaoui, Yahya Al-Gahes and Salem Mubarak Al-Yami. He ran in the 60 metres at the 2007 Asian Indoor Games but was disqualified in the semi-finals. He made a handful of appearance in 2008, running in the United States and Finland, but did not compete internationally that year. He was a semi-finalist in the 100 m at the 2009 Asian Athletics Championships. He attempted to defend his title at the 2010 Asian Games and gave his best performance in three years, running a time of 10.35 seconds, although that was only enough for fifth place. He was also part of the Saudi Arabian relay team which finished seventh that year."
