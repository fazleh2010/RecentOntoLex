After playing for Central District in the SANFL in 2007, including in their 2007 SANFL Premiership side, he was selected by North Melbourne in the 2008 Rookie Draft. Obst made his AFL debut in Round 8 of the 2008 AFL season, two days before his 21st birthday. He was badly injured from a collision during the game. He fractured ribs and suffered a collapsed lung, resulting in him being unable to fly home from the Gold Coast and instead was driven home. He return later in the year to play two more games, but was delisted again at the end of the season. North Melbourne then re-selected him in the 2009 Rookie Draft. He only played in the final two matches of the 2009 AFL season and not at all in 2010, before he was delisted from an AFL club for the third time in October 2010. In 2011 he returned to South Australia to again play for Central District. Obst has twice suffered injuries from late-night incidents at bars, firstly in May 2010 in Melbourne and then in April 2011 in Adelaide, when he received a broken jaw."

  "text" : "Adele Terese Katz (26 August 1887 – May 1979) was a music teacher and music theorist, and author. She was the first person to publish English-language writings about Schenkerian analysis. Katz was born in San Francisco, California to Emanuel Katz (who was born in Missouri), who worked in advertising, and Hanna Gunst Katz (who was born in Talberton, Georgia), both Jewish of German descent. She had one brother, Sidney (born 1874), who followed his father in advertising. By 1910, Sidney and his father were living in Chicago, while Adele and her mother were living at 308 McDonough Street in Brooklyn, New York. By that time she was already teaching music. From 1896 to 1907, she attended the Packer Collegiate Institute where she studied harmony with Raymond Huntington Woodman and violin with Henry Schradieck. She also studied theory and composition with Alfredo Casella, Gena Branscombe and Mortimer Wilson. In 1927, she moved to 277 West End Avenue in Manhattan, where she lived until her death in 1979. From 1928 through 1935, she was a student at the David Mannes Music School (now the Mannes College The New School for Music), where she studied with David Mannes and Hans Weisse. For a single season (1928–29), she was also a student at the Curtis Institute where she studied composition with Rosario Scalero. Her first teaching position was with the Rand School of Social Science (1931–40). She also held positions at The New School, the 92nd Street Y, Mannes College of Music (Westchester Branch), Teachers College, Columbia University. Her last teaching position was with the Studios of Music Education, a position she held from the mid-1940s until 1969. She also practiced music therapy at the Manhattan Psychiatric Center. In speaking of her 1935 article \"Henrich Schenker's Method of Analysis\", Berry notes: \"she issued the first substantive English-language distillation of Schenkerian concepts.\" Her 1945 book Challenge to Musical Tradition (and Schenkerian theory at large) was heavily criticized in Paul Henry Lang's famous \"Editorial\" in The Musical Quarterly 32/2 (1946)."

Al-Sarakhsi was killed by Caliph al-Mu'tadid because, according to an anecdote preserved in Yaqut al-Hamawi's Mu'jam al-Udaba', he had urged the caliph towards apostasy. Al-Biruni reports in his Chronology that al-Sarakhsi had written books in which he denounced prophecy and ridiculed the prophets, whom he styled charlatans. However, Rosenthal has disputed the historicity of the stories that claim al-Sarakhsi was executed for heretical beliefs."

  "text" : "Pandit Amarnath (1909-1996) was the well-known disciple of Ustad Amir Khan, founder of the Indore gharana of Hindustani [Indian classical] music. He was his first and closest disciple, and continued the legacy by bringing into the gayaki or style, his own unique raga-meditations in over 150 ragas, a peak range, as far as raga repertoires of his generation go. While Amir Khan had specially propagated the vilambit or the slow style of singing, Amarnath further enriched the gharana with the mystic poetry he wrote as bandish for khayal singing, under the pen-name of Miturang. Amar Nath was born in 1909 in Jhang in Punjab, now in Pakistan. He received his initial training in music from Professor B.N. Datta of Lahore, from 1942 to 1947, and moved to Delhi after the partition of India. It was his first guru, Prof. Datta, who suggested that he go to Khan for further learning. As Amarnath was already singing the ustad's style, and as public opinion was that the disciple sounded so much like his guru, Amir Khan was convinced about his sincerity, and accepted him as a disciple. Besides devoutly following Amir Khan's style, teaching and demonstrating the style, Amar Nath also served at All India Radio for eight years, as Composer, recruited specially by Pandit Ravi Shankar during the latter's tenure at AIR. Pandit Amarnath later served as Director of Triveni Kala Sangam, and then as Guru at the Shriram Bharatiya Kala Kendra, in Delhi. This is where he evolved the futuristic, and unique Pandit Amarnath Teaching Method. He also provided music for the 1955 film Garam Coat starring Balraj Sahni and Nirupa Roy, in which Lata Mangeshkar sang the 5 songs out of which one song, Jogiya se preet kiye dukh hoye, became one of her all-time favourites. She featured this song in her life's 10 best-song collection brought out by HMV. Garam Coat was a story by Rajinder Singh Bedi  Pandit Amarnath also directed the music for a documentary on Mirza Ghalib. This included the first and only ghazal recorded in the voice of Ustad Amir Khan; the documentary was made by M. S. Sathyu. He died March 9, 1996. The book, Conversations with Pandit Amarnath conducted by Bindu Chawla, based on conversations with him, was published by Indira Gandhi National Centre for the Arts, Delhi, in the year 2004. His memoire about his guru, Amir Khan, was published in 2008, by the Pandit Amarnath Memorial Foundation. The book is entitled Indore ke Masiha/Prophets of Indore, memoires of my guru, USTAD AMIR KHAN SAHEB.The Pandit Amarnath Vaggeyakar Samman, or Composer's Award, is instituted in his memory every year by the Pandit Amarnath Memorial Foundation, whose Chairperson is his daughter, Bindu Chawla."

  "text" : "\"Aza Sydykov\" born 1986 in Bishkek (Frunze), formerly USSR, now Kyrgyz Republic) is a Kyrgyz concert pianist. Aza Sydykov was born in February 1986 into a musical family in Bishkek, the capital of the Kyrgyz Republic, a former Republic of the Soviet Union. His mother, Alymkan Sydykova, was the Dean of the Choral Conducting Department of the University of Culture and Arts; his father, Djumakadyr Kanimetov, is the Principal Conductor of the Kyrgyz National Opera and Ballet Theater. His formal musical education began at the age of 7 when he entered the National School of Music in Bishkek, where he studied with Svetlana Krivopalova. At age 14, he was accepted into the Central Music School of the Moscow Conservatory, where his teacher was Professor Anatoly Ryabov. In 2004, he entered the Moscow Conservatory where he studied under the tutelage of the great Russian pianist Nikolai Arnoldovich Petrov. A member of the International Academy of Creative Endeavors (Moscow 2009), Mr. Sydykov has been the recipient of many awards and prizes including the first prize in five national music competitions in the Kyrgyz Republic; First Prize at the Musician of the 21st Century International Piano Competition in Kazakhstan; First Prize and the Grand Prize at the Euterpe International Piano Competition and the Euterpe Chamber Music Competition in Italy in 2009. He has been a fellow of the Vladimir Spivakov International Charity Foundation, the New Names Foundation, and the Nikolay Petrov International Philanthropic Foundation. He made his debut with the National Philharmonic of Russia under the baton of Vladimir Simkin in the Great Hall of the Moscow International House of Music together with the great Russian pianist, Andrei Gavrilov. In addition, he was the artistic director and organizer of the Musical Friendship Necklace International Festival, which was held for two years in the White Hall of the Saint Petersburg State Polytechnic University from 2009-2010, founded by the Meerim International Charity Foundation and attended by young artists from 15 countries. In 2010, Mr. Sydykov was the artistic director of concerts in Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan, dedicated to the 170th anniversary Tchaikovsky’s birth. Aza Sydykov has performed in Germany, Turkey, Finland, Iran, Switzerland, Netherlands, Ukraine, China, Italy, Spain and the United States, and has appeared at Carnegie Hall, the Great Hall of The Moscow Conservatory, the Great Hall of the Moscow International House of Music, Great Hall of the Kyrgyz National Philharmonic, the Palace of Nations in Geneva, and the United Nations Headquarters in New York City. His recordings with the Kyrgyz State Academic Symphony Orchestra of Tchaikovsky’s First Piano Concerto, Liszt's First Piano Concerto, and Beethoven's Fifth Piano Concerto were entered into the Golden Fund of the Kyrgyz National TV and Radio Broadcasting Corporation, an official archive of great moments in Kyrgyz performing arts. In 2012, he received an Honorary Diploma of the Kyrgyz Government from President Roza Otunbaeva. The first President of Kyrgyzstan, Askar Akayev, played a special role in Aza's fate when he gave his full support to the young pianist after noticing his budding talent. Over twelve years, young Aza accompanied the President during his state visits, and performed before many heads of state. When he was fourteen, the President gave him the keys to a new apartment so that the boy and his mother could move there from the school dormitory; this provided Aza with the perfect environment for making music. In subsequent years, Mr. Sydykov and the President bound a warm friendship, meeting again in Moscow, where President Akayev lived following his presidency. Popular opinion concerning the former President of Kyrgyzstan notwithstanding, he continues to openly express his respect for and gratitude to President Akayev. Since 2011, Aza has lived and studied in the United States, where he was discovered by Professor Pavlina Dokovska, Chair of the Piano Department at the Mannes College The New School for Music in New York City. Professor Dokovska, who described him as “a pianist of uncommon sensitivity, technical verve and refinement beyond his years,” invited him to study at the prestigious American school where he received a full scholarship to pursue the Professional Studies Diploma program. In early 2013, he was awarded the New School University’s Presidential Scholarship and Schoenberg Piano Stipend to pursue a Master of Music degree at Mannes. For the last three years, Aza Sydykov has performed at concerts and festivals throughout the United States. He was a regular participant in the Mannes yearlong festival concerts, which took place in such prestigious venues as Carnegie Hall, Steinway Hall, Neue Galerie, Union Hall, and the Center for Jewish History. He also made appearances at the Young Artists Forum Festival in ]]Schenectady, New York]]; at the AYC Speakers Program’s classical music series festival at Rye, New York; the Carnegie Concert Series in Nyack, New York; the Golden Key Music Festival at Jazz at []Lincoln Center]], New York City; and the October 2014 opening concert of the Clayton Piano Festival in North Carolina. As a collaborative artist, he regularly works with artists from the Bolshoi Theater and the Metropolitan Opera as well as with highly respected voice teachers such as Professors Robert White, Arthur Levy and Monica Harte. In the summer of 2012, he was invited by the Nevada Opera Association to be a musical director of Strauss’s “Die Fledermaus” and also worked as a musical director with the Remarkable Theater Brigades Opera Shorts programs in Carnegie Hall. His work as a cultural ambassador played a positive role during some difficult moments in Kyrgyzstan’s history: in 2010, he returned to Kyrgyzstan with American conductor Joel Spiegelman to give a series of charity concerts with the Kyrgyz State Academic Symphony Orchestra to support the families of victims massacred by then-President Kurmanbek Bakiev during the April 7, 2010 overthrow of Bakiev’s regime. In June 2010, soon after the spring revolution, there was a bloody inter-ethnic skirmish that resulted in hundreds of deaths. Mr. Sydykov requested support from the U.S. government for a project to organize a musical caravan of peace in the conflict-torn city of Osh. With this support, he traveled to Osh—again with the Kyrgyz State Academic Symphony Orchestra—where he enjoyed great success in organizing and performing a benefit concert that brought together people from the two conflicting ethnic groups. Although steeped in the music and tradition of the great 19th century masters attained through his years of study at the historic Moscow Conservatory, his broad musical interests embrace modern works and those of lesser-known composers with equal commitment and artistry. He has performed and premiered works by such contemporary composers as Bern Herbolsheimer and Patrick Soluri, and lesser-known composers such as Vladimir Drozdoff. He is also playing a key role in promoting the classical music of Kyrgyzstan and the names of Kyrgyz composers such as Abdylas Maldybaesv, Kalyi Moldobasanov, Nasyr Davlesov, Muratbek Begaliev and Mkhail Burshtin, and is active in building cultural connections between Kyrgyzstan and the United States.In May 2014, Aza made history with his solo debut recital at Weill Hall in Carnegie Hall; in the first appearance by a Kyrgyzstan artist in Carnegie-Weill’s history, he performed world premieres of works by Kyrgyz composers. In October 2015, he was again invited to perform at Carnegie at the behest of the Kyrgyz Republic."

  "text" : "Aristide \"A.J.\" Laurent (September 15, 1941, Magnolia Springs, Alabama – October 26, 2011, Los Angeles, California) was an American publisher and LGBT civil rights advocate. He co-founded The Los Angeles Advocate (now known as The Advocate) in 1967 with Sam Allen, Bill Rau, and Richard Mitch. He was born in Magnolia Springs, Alabama to Duval “Buck” Laurent, a farm hand, and Elizabeth “Betty” Weeks, and was of Creole ancestry. Joining the Air Force in 1960, serving for four years as an instructor (at Keesler Air Force Base in Mississippi) and signals intelligence operator in Karamursel, Turkey, and being discharged, he moved to California and came out. Between 1964 and 1967, he worked for KABC in Los Angeles. He allegedly participated in the 1966 Compton's Cafeteria riot in Los Angeles, and participated in the riots following the police raid on Black Cat Tavern in Los Angeles. In the wake of the two incidents, he joined Steve Ginsberg's PRIDE organization and co-founded The Los Angeles Advocate. While helping to publish the early editions of the paper, he wrote a nightlife column (“Mariposas de la Noche”) under the pseudonym “P. Nutz.” In 1974, The Advocate was sold and in 1975 was relocated to the Bay Area; Laurent relocated to the Bay Area for a short time before returning to Los Angeles to establish NewsWest (1975–1977) to fill the void left by The Advocate. In 1976, Laurent was one of 40 arrested after a police raid on the Mark IV Gay Bathhouse following a mistaken tip that the charity \"slave auction\" being held at the locale to benefit was an actual, illegal slave auction. In the 1980s, Laurent bought a printing company and participated in ACT UP demonstrations to advocate for AIDS/HIV patients. He also participated in the 1993 March on Washington. In 1996, he was diagnosed with prostate cancer and was given two years to live, but managed to outlive the expectation. In his latter years, he spent more time as an amateur genealogist who focused on Mobile Alabama Creole ancestry. He died on October 26, 2011, in Los Angeles after a long struggle with prostate cancer."

In 1832, he won the second Grand Prix de Rome for his Capanée foudroyé sous les murs de Thèbes. He exhibited at the Salon between 1836 and 1850, winning a third-class medal in 1839 for his Jésus Christ environné de petits enfants and a second class in 1847 for his Une esclave indienne portant une torche. As well as working on his own projects, Toussaint was professor of sculpture at the École des Beaux Arts and carried out several official and church commissions. Around 1850 he was included among those working in Notre Dame de Paris to restore sculptures destroyed during the French Revolution. In 1852, he was made a Knight of the Legion of Honor. He is buried in the cemetery of Montmartre. On his tomb is a bronze medallion by his former student Charles Gumery. A well known work of his in the United States is the statue of Persephone located in Indianapolis, created around 1840."

He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1736, his candidature citation describing him as \"a very noted & Skilfull Physician at Florence, and formerly Professor of Physic and Philosophy in the University of Pisa, desirous of being elected into this Honourable Society; he is a Gentleman of very distinguished merit both in his profession and all other parts of Natural & Philosophical Learning; he is the Author of Several Books and is now publishing some Greek Medical Writers never before printed from the MSS in the Laurentian Library; he is also at this time Secretary to a Society newly Set up at Florence very much on the Same foot as the Royal Society is here\" Cocchi spent three years in England, where he knew Isaac Newton. Although offered a position by the Princess of Wales, he returned to teach in Tuscany. Cocci was also a classical scholar, producing the first edition of the Ephesian Tale, a novel by Xenophon of Ephesus, as well as other work on Greek romances. His Discorso primo sopra Asclepiade (1758), on Asclepiades of Bithynia, appeared also in his collected Opere (1824). Elizabeth Rawson called the Discorso \"learned and often penetrating, though over-enthusiastic about his subject's moral virtues.\" Cocchi's writing style was characterized by purity of diction, and in his own time was regarded as a model for scientific writing."

He was fluent in six languages and used this talent to good effect to flourish as a dialect comedian in British music halls. Many of his film appearances were so fleeting that his characters often had no names, only descriptions, e.g. \"Valet with violin\" in The Prince and the Showgirl (1957) and \"Woodcutter\" in The Fearless Vampire Killers (1967). During his stage career, Andreas Malandrinos billed himself simply as Malandrinos; conversely, his movie billing was often simply \"Andreas.\""

  "text" : "Apollodorus (Greek: Ἀπολλόδωρος) was a loyal follower of the Egyptian Queen Cleopatra VII. In 48 BC he is supposed to have enabled Cleopatra to get in the palace of Alexandria to Julius Caesar and in this way to strengthen decisively her position in the power struggle with her brother Ptolemy XIII. When Caesar came to Alexandria in the summer of 48 BC he summoned the estranged Ptolemaic brother and sister to submit to his decision. Ptolemy XIII was at this time with his army at the Egyptian border near Pelusium opposite the troops of Cleopatra. He was first to go to Caesar. Cleopatra first sent negotiators to explain her point of view but, according to the historian Cassius Dio, she soon became convinced that if she came personally she could more easily win the Roman ruler over by her charm and beauty. Caesar promised her a confidential conversation. Apparently Ptolemy XIII tried to block his sister the access to Alexandria. Plutarch gives an account of her adventurous journey to the Egyptian capital. According to this report she chose from her retinue only one follower, Apollodorus the Sicilian, and travelled with him to Alexandria. The Roman poet Lucan claims, that when Cleopatra arrived near the city she bribed a guardian to remove the defensive chains in the harbour of Pharus In any case she entered the harbour of Alexandria by sea, because both Plutarch and Lucan say that she landed unobserved with her barque near the royal palace. According to Plutarch this happened in the twilight, and the Greek biographer adds that Cleopatra thought that her only chance to get to Caesar was to stretch herself at full length inside a bed-sack or carpet while Apollodorus tied it up with a cord and carried it past the guardians into the palace. The Egyptian Queen allegedly succeeded in that way in reaching the Roman general and in winning him over with this bold action. The credibility of this episode is disputed among scholars. But it is certain that Cleopatra gained Caesar’s support by her personal appearance. Nothing else is known about Apollodorus. The role of Apollodorus is played by Cesare Danova in the 1963 epic, Cleopatra. In the 1945 film Caesar and Cleopatra, based on the play by George Bernard Shaw, he is played by Stewart Granger, and is depicted as being somewhat in love with Cleopatra. He was played in the first television adaptation of the play by Farley Granger (no relation), and in the second TV adaptation by Clive Francis."

The election of the new princess-abbess was confirmed by Holy Roman Emperor Rudolf II. She frequently confronted Quedlinburg city council and the city patron, Christian I, Elector of Saxony, and appealed to the Emperor for support. Elector Christian I died in 1591 and was succeeded by Elector Christian II under the regency of Frederick William I, Duke of Saxe-Weimar. The Princess-Abbess selected Anne Margaret of Brunswick-Harburg as her coadjutrix but the Duke of Saxe-Weimar refused to consent as he wanted his own sister, Maria, to succeed Anna III. Anna III died suddeny aged 36 after a walk. The official cause of her death was stroke. She was succeeded by her enemy's sister."

  "text" : "Duchess Anna Dorothea of Saxe-Weimar (12 November 1657 - 24 June 1704) reigned as Princess-Abbess of Quedlinburg from 1684 until her death. Born in Weimar, Duchess Anna Dorothea was the daughter of John Ernest II, Duke of Saxe-Weimar, and Christine Elisabeth of Holstein-Sonderburg. Her father decided she should pursue an ecclesiastical career when she was still a child. From 1681 until 1684, Anna Dorothea was provost of the Quedlinburg monasteries. Upon the death of Princess-Abbess Anna Sophia II, Anna Dorothea was chosen to succeed her, though not without difficulties that required the intervention of the abbey-principality's guardian and fellow Wettin, John George III, Elector of Saxony. The Elector consented to her election on 4 September 1684 and Holy Roman Emperor Leopold I confirmed it on 29 January 1685. In 1698, Frederick Augustus I, who had succeeded to the Electorate of Saxony in 1694 and had been elected King of Poland in 1697, found himself in need of money as the election had cost him a fortune. The King of Poland therefore decided to sell his rights of guardianship of the abbey-principality to Elector Frederick III of Brandenburg. The change was not welcomed by the citizens of Quedlinburg nor by the Princess-Abbess, as it led to diminishing of her power and loss of many of the abbey-principality's possessions. The Princess-Abbess protested against the sale and refused to recognise the Elector of Brandenburg as the abbey-principality's new guardian until military occupation the same year forced her to do so. As many of her predecessors, she often came into conflicts with the Council of the City of Quedlinburg and her guardian. Anna Dorothea suffered poor health in 1703 and went to Carlsbad to recover, but without success. She died the next year. She is buried in Weimar."

Bergner reported was a suspected member of the Asa'ib Ahl al-Haq \"Special Group\" and was killed by US forces on 19 May 2007.Bergner did not describe how Dulaimi died. On October 22, 2010, the New York Times reported that whistleblower organization WikiLeaks had published formerly secret documents where US intelligence analysts described why they thought al-Dulaimi had been trained in the “dark arts of paramilitary operation” by Iran and Hezbollah. “Dulaymi reportedly obtained his training from Hizballah operatives near Qum, Iran, who were under the supervision of Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps Quds Force (IRGC-QF) officers in July 2006.” On October 25, 2010, the Foreign Policy Journal published an article skeptical of the conclusions the New York Times had drawn from the leaked documents. According to Kimberly Kagan's The Surge: A Military History Dulaimi was \"the executor of the Ministry of Health and Karbala attacks\".Bill Roggio, writing in the Long War Journal also attributed an attack on the Karbala Provincial Joint Coordination Center to Dulaimi. According to Mark Urban's book on Special Forces in Iraq, Task Force Black, documents seized on March 20, 2007, when Qais Khazali and Ali Musa Daqduq were captured, described al Dulaimi's role in the Karbala attack and provided sufficient information for the raid where al Dulaimi died."

He had his real estate offices in the Kimball Building on Wall Street, a street otherwise totally occupied by whites. He brokered the deal for the sale of the land where the Georgia State Capitol now stands. His is the only mausoleum in the black section of Oakland Cemetery. When principal of Gate City Colored Public School, Jefferson Davis's body passed in front of the school on the way to Richmond, Virginia for burial. Schools were ordered to close that day so everyone could attend the memorial parade, but Graves refused to honor a man who fought for slavery. Graves was fired as a result of this refusal. His wife Catherine Webb was the daughter of Sinai Calhoun Webb, born a slave in 1830 and the biracial daughter of prominent Southern politician and mayor of Atlanta Judge William Ezzard. The Atlanta Housing Authority's Antoine Graves senior citizen highrise (built 1965, demolished 2009) was named after him."

She took her first ballet lessons there and, showing talent, received a scholarship to Michel Fokine's school in New York and lived with relatives in Brooklyn. Lyon was a member of George Balanchine’s American Ballet, founded by Lincoln Kirstein in 1936, and danced in the original casts of Le baiser de la fée, Jeu de cartes and Serenade. Three years later she was one of the original dancers of Ballet Theatre, now known as American Ballet Theatre. On January 12, 1940, she was the company's first Giselle, partnered by Anton Dolin. The next year, on October 31, she danced her former teacher Fokine's Le Spectre de la Rose; she and her partner Ian Gibson were the last dancers taught the rôles by the choreographer. Her repertory included classical as well as contemporary works by the company's founders Antony Tudor and Agnes de Mille; de Mille's 1941 Three Virgins and a Devil (as The Lustful One), Tudor’s 1942 Pillar of Fire. On May 12, 1947, she danced with Jerome Robbins in the premiere of his Summer Day at New York City Center. Leaving Ballet Theater, Lyon danced on Broadway in Carousel (1945–47) and in Juno (1959), both choreographed by de Mille.

  "text" : "(For other people named Archibald Stuart, see Archibald Stuart (disambiguation).) Archibald Stewart (30 December 1867 – 29 May 1925) was an Australian trade unionist and ALP official. Stewart was born at Sebastopol to Scottish-born parents: miner John Stewart and Anne, née Erskine. His father worked as caretaker of the botanical gardens in Creswick and he took numerous jobs in his youth. Active in the early labour movement, he struggled to find permanent employment after being placed on an employers' blacklist. On 25 June 1891 he married Mary Edwards at Fitzroy. He was a member of the Australian Workers' Union and was its delegate on the Ballarat Trades and Labor Council until 1910. He helped found the Ballarat branch of the Labor Party in 1902 and was its secretary from 1905 to 1906; he was involved in James Scullin's ultimately unsuccessful attempt to unseat Alfred Deakin at the 1906 federal election. In 1908 Stewart ran for the Victorian Legislative Assembly, standing unsuccessfully as the Labor candidate for Ballarat East. He was also narrowly defeated standing in 1910 and 1913 for the federal seat of Grampians. After the 1910 election he moved to Melbourne and was elected senior vice-president of the Political Labor Council, later taking on the secretaryship in 1911. In 1914 he was considered one of the \"powers behind the throne\" of Andrew Fisher's federal administration, and he was appointed the first secretary of the ALP's federal executive in 1915, serving until 1925. A staunch anti-conscriptionist, he organised opposition to Billy Hughes' conscription referenda in 1916–17 and avoided a second split over the socialist objective in 1919–21. In 1925 he died at his home in Sandringham of tuberculosis. A memorial tablet was unveiled at Stewart's grave in December 1926 by the then president of the Victorian branch of the ALP. Stewart is buried at Coburg Cemetery, Preston, Victoria. His grave is included in a self-guided heritage walk at the cemetery and information about his life is available on a sign posted at his graveside."

He chaired the skiing club Bærums SK from 1900 to 1904, in 1906 and 1919 to 1920, and was a board member of the Norwegian Ski Federation from 1908 to 1911. He was also a board member of the newspaper Asker og Bærums Budstikke after the political takeover in 1913. He chaired the development society Bærums Sogneselskap from 1930 to 1938, and received honorary membership here. He died in 1953."

Carson ran for parliament at the 1922 federal election, unsuccessfully contesting Perth as one of four endorsed Nationalists. He returned to journalism; he retired from 1938 until he resumed work in 1941 as a result of staff shortages caused by World War II. Carson also had an active career in social work, founding the Infant Health Association and serving as president of the Silver Chain District Nursing Association and chairman of the Bush Nursing Society (1923–44). In 1941 he was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire. He died in 1944."

Between 1984 and 1986 he was a visiting research fellow at Florida State University, followed by two years as a research associate at Uppsala University and ten years as a senior lecturer at Linköping University. In 1998 Anders Blomqvist was appointed professor of pain research at Linköping University. Blomqvist’s early research concentrated on the construction and function of the nerve paths for the sense of feeling. He revealed how the sensation of pain is mediated by specific nerve pathways, and not, as has been previously suggested, conditioned by stimulation of other sensory pathways. Blomqvist’s later research is focused on how immune signals are transmitted to and processed by the brain. He has shown that the expression of prostaglandin E2 synthesizing enzymes are critical for the febrile response to peripheral inflammation."

At the University of Bonn he studied under surgeon Karl Wilhelm Wutzer (1789–1863), and after receiving his doctorate from the University of Berlin, he was an assistant to psychiatrist Carl Wigand Maximilian Jacobi (1777–1858) at the asylum in Siegburg. As a young man, Erlenmeyer was influenced by Jacobi's somatic approach to psychiatry, and felt that there needed to be a close unity of psychiatry and neurology. In 1848 he opened a private asylum in Bendorf bei Koblenz that was to become known as Asyl für Gehirn- und Nervenkranke. During the ensuing years the facility expanded, eventually having a department of neurology (1866) and an \"agricultural colony\" called Albrechtshöhe (1867). In 1854 Erlenmeyer became a co-founder of the Deutsche Gesellschaft für Psychiatrie und gerichtliche Psychologie (German Society for Psychiatry and Forensic Psychology). His son, psychiatrist Friedrich Albrecht Erlenmeyer (1849–1926) is remembered for his research of morphine addiction."

In 1915 Carranza participated in the Battle of El Ebano, San Luis Potosí, against Villa's forces, and helped Yucatán campaign Salvador Alvarado. He organized the Department of Aviation, with its aeronautical workshops and a school for training military pilots. He was also the head of a cartridge factory. After the war Carranza was exiled in Lima, Peru, and then in the United States. He was a Senator of the Republic in the XXXVII Legislature. In June 1942 he was conferred the rank of General, and in January 1951 reached the rank of Brigadier General. He was a military air attache at the embassies in Washington, Paris, Rome and Belgrade.

The New York Post asserted that Aziz was radicalized when he traveled to Kosovo during its war of independence from Yugoslavia to treat wounded Muslim Yugoslavians. Aziz was seized by American security officials on October 21, 2002, and held and interrogated by officers of both the FBI and the CIA. Aziz refuted the speculation that bin Laden was suffering from Kidney disease, or some other serious disease. He asserted that the two times he examined bin Laden, in 1999 and November 2001. Aziz had been paying visits to Afghanistan, to treat mujahideen since the war to oust Afghanistan's Soviet invaders in 1989. In 2005, the Los Angeles Times reported that Aziz travelled to perform emergency medical work when remote Pakistan controlled Kashmir was hit by an earthquake that killed 86,000.They reported on tensions with US forces who were also providing emergency service, due to his known past association with Islamists. His field hospital was in a camp run by the Jamaat-ud-Dawa—a group associated with Lashkar e taiba. On April 25, 2011, the whistleblower organization WikiLeaks published formerly secret documents signed by the Guantanamo camp commandants. One brief recorded that one captive, Ayman Batarfi, was a young doctor who had interned under Aziz in 2000. The document quotes Aziz, and records several suspicions American intelligence officials held about Aziz.American officials suspected Aziz had been involved in an al Qaeda's plans to develop biological and chemical weapons."

His father also had business interests in South Africa, and the family spent some years in the Cape Town area. He was educated at South African College School and Trinity Hall, Cambridge. He took a second in the Law Tripos in 1905. He was called to the bar at the Middle Temple in 1907, and practised as a barrister in Sheffield. He also lectured in common law at the University of Sheffield. During the First World War Caporn served as an officer in the Royal Field Artillery. He was invalided home in 1916, spending the rest of the war as an intelligence officer in the United Kingdom. He remained on the reserve of officers until 1934, reaching the rank of major. At the 1931 general election he was chosen by the Conservatives to contest Nottingham West, which was held by Arthur Hayday of the Labour Party. Caporn won the seat in a bitterly fought contest, but only served a single term in Commons with Hayday regaining the constituency in 1935. Returning to his legal career, in 1939 Caporn was appointed a County Court judge. He remained on the bench until his death. He married Dorothy Frances Marriott of Nottingham in 1912, and the couple had two sons. He died in Saxondale Hospital in November 1953 aged 69."

He later published a sketch of the history of Khazaria and opposed the Anti-Normanist dogma perpetuated in the official Soviet historiography inter alia by Boris Rybakov. Novoseltsev was elected a corresponding member of the Russian Academy of Sciences in 1984. He managed the Russian History Institute, affiliated with the Academy of Sciences, between 1988 and 1993.

Three other brothers, Harald, Gunerius and Carl, were Axel's business partners. In 1895 he inherited the company founded by and named after his father, Gunerius Pettersen. The company was passed down from his mother, and shared between the brothers Harald, Gunerius, Axel and Carl. They soon made important investments and expansions. A building, Storgaten 32 was bought in 1897, followed by Brogaten 2 and 4 in 1912. The company was expanded from a store to also encompass retailing and wholesaling. Axel Pettersen was a member of the executive committee of Kristiania city council. He served as consul for Bolivia from 1909, chaired the employers' association Manufakturgrossistenes Landsforening, was a supervisory council member of Den norske Creditbank and Hypotek- og Realkreditbanken and a board member of the Norwegian Association of Hunters and Anglers. Axel's son Gunerius (called Gunerius, Jr. even though he was the third Gunerius) was hired in the family company in 1916, and worked as a jurist. However, he died in 1928, only aged 34. Axel died later that summer. The family company was eventually taken over by Axel's nephew Christian Børs Pettersen, who was later joined by Axel's grandson Gunerius. The family company still exists in the same location, but the store is now named Gunerius Shoppingsenter."

  "text" : "Aoife Kavanagh is a former reporter and presenter for Raidió Teilifís Éireann (RTÉ) and was at the centre of the \"Mission to Prey\" scandal that rocked the Irish national radio and television broadcaster in 2011. She resigned from RTÉ following the publication of the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland (BAI) statement of findings and the full report on the programme. Previously, she was a presenter of RTÉ flagship radio programme Morning Ireland (RTÉ Radio 1) and a reporter with RTÉ television programme Prime Time Investigates (RTÉ One). She, herself, made national news headlines in 2011 however when she was at the centre of a controversy surrounding the defamation of Fr. Kevin Reynolds in a documentary entitled Mission To Prey. The defamation of Fr. Kevin Reynolds led to the suspension of the Prime Time programme, prompted an investigation and led to interventions by politicians as senior as the Taoiseach Enda Kenny. The entire team involved in the programme including the Managing Editor of News and Current Affairs temporarily stepped aside from involvement in on-air programming to co-operate with the investigation. In 2011, a defamation/libel suit was filed against RTÉ following Ms Kavanagh's report 'Mission To Prey' on Prime Time – about sexual abuse by Irish Catholic Missionary Priests in Africa, including one whereby the Priest (Fr. Kevin Reynolds) was falsely accused of child-rape and fathering a child while a missionary in Kenya. The suit against the national broadcaster was settled for an undisclosed sum. RTÉ later broadcast an apology to Fr Kevin Reynolds. On 18 November 2011, the head of the Irish Missionary Union said Kavanagh's continuing presence on Morning Ireland after being found guilty of defaming Fr Kevin Reynolds was \"unfair and unjust\" and a demonstration of \"double standards\" in the media. RTÉ was fined €200,000 by the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland (BAI) as a result of the defamation of Fr Kevin Reynolds following what the BAI said were serious breaches of the Broadcasting Act 2009. The report found that \"Second-hand repetition of gossip appears to have been treated as corroboration, as Ms Kavanagh did not appear to have met or questioned colleagues who according to the primary source, were aware of the allegations\". Kavanagh resigned from RTÉ on 4 May 2012. She had previously been tipped as a replacement for Charlie Bird in the role of RTÉ's US Correspondent after he left the States. Director-General of RTÉ Noel Curran admitted the broadcasting of \"Mission to Prey\" was \"one of the gravest editorial mistakes ever made\" at RTÉ. \n*  \"Far Away Up Close (Development series)\" (2006) \n*  \"White Collar Crime\" (2009) \n*  \"Mission to Prey\" (2011)"

You well remember with what bitter feelings your teachers have tried to plant in you a sort of hatred against the Hessians, those soldiers who came from the other side, hired to do the work of King George III against the American Colonists, and those were only the ragtag of the people; they were the hired murderers who came here to do the bidding of King George III; think how much more bitter the Russian people today have a right to feel against people who, in the name of democracy, in the name of everything that seems to be sacred, come there and hand out the same dose to Russia today which was handed out by the Hessians to the American Republic." ],

  "text" : "Armand Nassery is an independent filmmaker and Iraqi-American author. Armand was born near the Iraqi province of Dhi-Qar; one of eleven children. His family moved to the capital, Baghdad, when he was young in search of an improved life. He spent his early years of school reading history, literature, poetry and was fascinated with his English language class. In the early eighties, Armand’s family was forced to move back south because of being labeled disloyal to the ruling Ba'ath Party. His family soon settled in a small southern town, which became the setting of his novel. In high school Armand joined the school theater group. He wrote and directed most of the plays with the help of one of his brothers. In college, Armand met some students who opposed the oppressive dictatorship of Saddam Hussein; some of the students were members of opposition parties. The ruthless Iraqi secret police Al-Amen arrested him on the final day of his last year. The charges were for writing poetry that was considered disrespectful to the Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein. This charge held the penalty of death. Armand spent two months in the dim airless Al-Amen dungeons enduring continuous torture and interrogation. His conditions for release were that he would never again write poetry or join any forbidden political party. Armand and his brothers joined the uprising against the regime of Saddam Hussein in March 1991 after the Gulf War. In this ill fated armed struggle for freedom he frequently stared death in the face. When the last southern town fell to the brutal suppressive Ba’ath forces Armand fled to avoid certain torture and death. He was tried and sentenced in absentia. The sentence was death. He spent three grueling days in the desert of Iraq and was able to reach Saudi Arabia with the aid of the American 82nd Airborne Soldiers. Upon reaching Saudi Arabia the Americans were required to turn him over to the authorities of Saudi Arabia. He was again imprisoned and spent six months being tortured for crossing the borders illegally. Then in 1992 Armand was able to immigrate to the safety of the United States. He has spent the last two decades living in California and the Midwest. Many of his personal experiences have been the inspiration in his fictional novel ‘Where Wolves Dream’. Dream."

  "text" : "Alexander McClurg Drake (c. 1859 – 8 October 1934) was a Minnesota investor and pioneer of the U.S. state of Oregon. He was the founder of Bend. Drake was born in St. Paul, Minnesota as the second son of Caroline Matilda McClurg and railroader Hon. E. F. Drake, speaker of the Ohio house of representatives and Minnesota senator Elias Franklin Drake.Drake, reacting to the 1893 Panic, traveled in a covered wagon with his wife, Florence (Ada Florence Williams), arriving to what was called \"Farewell Bend\" in June 1900. Mrs. Drake's love of the area's natural beauty, \"the majestic Cascades to the West and the Deschutes River in the foreground\" is said to be responsible for the selection of the site on which Bend now stands. Their home, the Drake Lodge, was built upon the spot now part of the Masonic Lodge in the center of Bend, which developed around the Drake's property. Mr. Drake was owner of the first sawmill in Bend and saw the irrigation potential of the area. Drake formed the Pilot Butte Development Company on October 18, 1900. He platted the streets of Bend and was organizer in the Central Oregon irrigation project that was assigned the first land under the Carey Act segregation, building the Central Oregon Canal and Pilot Butte Canal which later led to the Bend area population boom from rapid agricultural development. Drake founded the Deschutes Water, Light and Power Company in 1909 and built the dam and original wooden powerhouse on the Deschutes River. On November 2, 1910, the first electricity was provided to the business district (with intentions to later expand to the residential areas) through five miles of power lines on 85 poles throughout Bend. At that time, 375 lights had been installed and 125 further were contracted for connection to electrical power that was available from 4:30 p.m. to midnight and from 4 to 8 a.m. Mr. Drake sold his holdings just a few months before his power project was completed, however his original turbines and generators still produce the power for part of Bend’s downtown at the same 100-year-old Bend power plant, now owned by Pacific Power. The Alexander Drake Building at 250 NW Franklin Avenue in Bend was built in 2001, a three-and-a-half story 32,000 square foot office building designed by BBT architects and Froelich Consulting Engineers, Inc., is named after Mr. Drake. Drake Park is also named after him. Wall Street, one of Bend's core roads, is named after the stone fence along the east side of the Drake property now part of Drake Park Neighborhood Historic District."

He served a three months prison sentence as part of the \"32 Process\", was deported from the country and died in 1867 in Rome hospital, after having been injured, as a member of the Giuseppe Garibaldi's squad. Arthur Benni's activities and persona caused controversy in Russia where rumours of him being a spy and a 3rd Department agent were being spread, much to his outrage and distress. Ivan Turgenev and Nikolai Leskov did much to clear Benni's name. The latter (who chose Benni as a prototype for Rainer, the No Way Out novel's revolutionary character) wrote a posthumous essay on him called The Mystery Man."

He finished his secondary education in 1918, and graduated from the Royal Frederick University with the cand.jur. degree in 1925. Since 1927 he was married to Sofie Wold. He was a deputy judge from 1927 to 1929, then a secretary in Oslo municipality; first in the tax authority until 1938, then under the chief administrative officer of finances from 1938 to 1941. At the time this was criticized as a political appointment, since the burgomaster had suggested that Thor Stabenfeldt be hired. In the executive committee of Oslo city council, Stabenfeldt carried the 10 bourgeois votes whereas the Labour Party gathered 11 votes for Hazeland, who then prevailed. During the Second World War Hazeland left the civil service and was a junior solicitor and attorney. After the war he served as tax director in Oslo from 1946 to 1951 and presiding judge in Eidsivating Court of Appeal from 1951 to 1969. He died in December 1977 and was buried in Vår Frelsers gravlund."

Baqi threatened Fayiz Mohammad by God that the Haqqani garrison would bombard the Matoun citadel stone by stone unless he let the Arabs go. Subsequently, Baqi also served at this post during the Taliban emirate, which left the southeastern province's administration unchanged. In 1999 he was quoted as encouraging the family of a murder victim to show clemency to the murderer, who was about to be executed. (Source: ) However, a former Taliban diplomat who switched sides, Wahid Muzdah, described Baqi in worse terms and accused him of narrow-mindedness. He replaced Abdul-Rahim Houtak, who had protested against the destruction of the Bamiyan Buddhas in 2001. (Gutman, \"How we missed the story, 2007\"). During the Taliban regime Abdul Baqi was a diplomat, Vice-Minister of Information and Culture, Governor of Khost Province and Paktika Province."

  "text" : "Alonzo Kimball (November 29, 1808 – 1900) was an American politician. He served as Mayor of Green Bay, Wisconsin in 1871 and 1873. Kimball was born in Jefferson County, New York, the fifth of twelve children to Ruel and Hannah Kimball. He attended Union College and Andover Theological Seminary. Kimball had intended to become a clergyman, but health problems kept him from doing so. He married the daughter of a clergyman when he married Sarah Weston (1811-1891), daughter of Rev. Isaiah Weston of Dalton, Massachusetts, in 1840. The couple had six children: William, Sarah, Mary, Alonzo, Charles and Mather. Alonzo Kimball moved to Milwaukee, Wisconsin in 1847, before moving to Green Bay in 1849. After a few years of teaching in the public school he engaged in the hardware trade. At the time of his death in 1900, aged 91, he was the oldest living graduate of Union College. He was survived by five of his six children."

At the time of his first exhibition in Berlin he displayed some works that critics defined as of a style close to Cubism. He arrived in Paris around 1925. In extreme poverty, married with a child, he was observed by the art dealer René Gimpel, who wrote in his journal: \"I have bought about 35 of his canvasses, some are quite uneven, but that in itself is some proof of talent ...he barely managed to scrape a 100 sous to live on; he wouldn't eat, and, dying of hunger would say to his wife: Eat, Mintchine isn't hungry. Now, (in 1929), that he's achieved a measure of comfort and his health has deteriorated, he continues to deprive himself for his wife saying:Mintchine doesn't need anything. \""

On 11 June 1912 he married Ruby Adelaide Fraunfelder at St James Old Cathedral in Melbourne, moving to Shepparton the following year to become secretary of Goulburn Valley Industries Co. Ltd. After spending several years managing at meatworks in Carnarvon, Western Australia, he moved to Sydney in 1922 to become an accountant and in 1926 was appointed manager of the Theosophical Society's radio station 2GB. In 1929 Bennett and George Arundale founded the Who's for Australia? League and served as president until 1931, when his brother Gordon Bennett succeeded him. An open admirer of Benito Mussolini, Bennett ran for the Australian House of Representatives in the 1931 federal election as a United Australia Party candidate for the seat of Lang, but was unsuccessful. Bennett travelled to the United States twice in the 1930s and continued his broadcasting activities. He was president of the Australian Federation of Commercial Broadcasting from 1934 to 1936 and took a stand against government interference, as well as demanding equal status with the Australian Broadcasting Commission. He also directed the stations 3AW in Melbourne and 5DN in Adelaide. He was appointed director of the Theosophical Broadcasting Station Ltd in 1935 and in 1937 won a court case for the rest of his fees after he was asked to resign. He later won a High Court appeal in 1947, which decided that compensation was a capital payment. In his retirement Bennett worked for welfare for children and old men and was general secretary of the Australian Child Welfare Association. He died at the wheel of his car at Vaucluse of coronary vascular disease in 1963 and was cremated."

  "text" : "Alfred Russell \"Alf\" Wallis (16 April 1888 – 3 August 1963) was an Australian trade unionist and conciliation commissioner. Born at North Carlton in Melbourne to carpenter William Wallis and Mary Ann, née Gorman, he attended state schools at Horsham and Moreland before becoming a cutter's apprentice and journeyman. He joined the Victorian Socialist Party (VSP) when he was eighteen, and in 1906 was sent to gaol for thirty days for his part in the party's free speech campaign. On his release he joined the Victorian Clothing Operatives' Union and represented it in the Trades Hall Council, also being elected to the VSP's executive. However, the increased stress of these positions led to a breakdown and Wallis retired to the country to recover. He returned to his career in 1908 and in 1909 was elected president of the Victorian branch of the Federated Clothing Trades Union of Australia. From 1912 he represented his union at state conferences of the Australian Labor Party. In 1920 Wallis was appointed secretary of the Clothing Trades Union's Victorian branch and edited its journal, the Clothing Trades Gazette. At Collingwood on 5 March 1921 he married Josephine Wood. Wallis supported the Premiers' Plan and contested the Senate as a Labor candidate in 1931. In 1932 he was elected President of the Victorian Trades Hall Council, and in 1933 he was appointed the workers' delegate to the International Labour Conference in Geneva. In 1934 he was general secretary-treasurer of the Amalgamated Clothing and Allied Trades Union, serving until 1944. A workers' representative on the Women's Employment Board during World War II, Wallis was appointed a Commonwealth conciliation commissioner in 1947 and resigned his union positions. He retired in 1953 and died at Fitzroy in 1963. Always a controversial figure, Wallis's later career made him enemies among his former union colleagues and his tendency towards prejudice against women and anti-Semitism made him unpopular among the clothing trades."

Schrobsdorff's first novel, \"Die Herren\" (\"The Gentlemen,\" 1961) caused a scandal and made her famous. She has published a dozen additional books, several of them about Bulgaria. Her memoir of her mother, \"Du bist nicht so wie andre Mütter\" (1992, 2nd ed.1994) was a best-seller and was also made into a movie for television (1999). It appeared in English under the title \"You are not Like Other Mothers\" (2012). Schrobsdorff was also an actress; she appeared in \"Der Ruf\" (\"The Last Illusion,\" 1949) and in several films and television programs about her own life. One of the most famous ones is the German documentary of Bulgarian film-maker Christo Bakalski named \"Bulgaria of all Places\" (\"Ausgerechnet Bulgarien\" in German). Schrobsdorff died on 31 July 2016 in Berlin, Germany at the age of 88."

  "text" : "Antoine Dubois (19 June 1756 – 30 March 1837) was a French surgeon born in Gramat, department of Lot. He was the father of obstetrician Paul Antoine Dubois (1795–1871). Dubois was appointed a professor of surgery in 1790, and in 1798 took part in the French Campaign of Egypt, serving as chief surgeon. On 22 August 1798 he became a member of the Institut d'Égypte. In 1802 he became a surgeon in a private hospital that later was to become known as the Maison Dubois. After the death of Pierre Lassus (1741–1807), Dubois was appointed as consultant-surgeon of the Emperor, and in 1810 replaced Jean-Louis Baudelocque (1745–1810) as head of maternity services. In 1811 he is chosen by Jean-Nicolas Corvisart (1755–1821) to deliver the child of Empress Marie-Louise, and following the birth of Napoleon II, he is given the title of \"baron\". In 1820 Dubois was appointed as a clinical professor to the Faculté de Médecine. He was relieved of these duties in 1822, only to have them reinstated several years later (1829). He published little during his career, but is credited with making improvement to a number of surgical instruments, including a forceps."

While a student at Cambridge Cowell planned (but was unable to take part in) the 1954 Oxford and Cambridge Trans-Africa Expedition, took part in the 1955-6 Oxford and Cambridge Far Eastern Expedition to Singapore, and the 1957-8 Oxford and Cambridge Expedition to South America. It was while on the latter expedition team Cowell met the Villas-Bôas brothers and left the Oxford and Cambridge Expedition to join them on the Centro Geographico Expedition to find the geographical centre of Brazil. This was the beginning of his connection with South America and in particular, Brazil. He was awarded the Royal Geographical Society's Cherry Kearton Medal and Award in 1985. In his obituary in The Guardian, Anthony Hayward wrote that he was \"one of the most successful\" documentary makers of his generation. His documentaries about the rain forest brought the subject significant political attention."

  "text" : "Armegot Printz (1625–1695) was a Swedish noble. She was the daughter of Johan Björnsson Printz, governor of New Sweden, and she married her father's successor, governor Johan Papegoja. She is the most well documented and known woman of New Sweden. Armegot Printz was born in Bottnaryd, Småland, Sweden. She was the daughter of the Swedish noble Johan Printz, colonel lieutenant of the Västgöta cavalry, and the German Elisabet Bock. She, as well as her mother and siblings, accompanied her father to Germany during his participation in the Thirty Years' War in the army of Gustav II Adolf of Sweden. In 1642, after her father's appointment as governor of the Swedish colony New Sweden in America, she followed her father to America in the company of her siblings and stepmother, where they arrived in February 1643. In New Sweden, her father had The Printzhof manor built as their residence at Tinicum Island. In 1645, the poor noble Johan Papegoja arrived to the colony with permission from Per Brahe to marry Armegot. After the marriage took place, her spouse was given a position in the colony by her father and the couple settled in Fort Christina, where they had four sons. Armegot Printz was described as dominant, proud and willful, and was said to have totally dominated the relationship. In 1653, Papepgoja replaced her father as governor so Armegot was given the position of first lady of the colony. When her husband was replaced by Johan Risingh and returned to Sweden, Armegot remained in the colony to manage her father's properties. She also stayed in Fort Christina, where she kept control of the staff and retained the position of first lady until Risingh managed to have her removed to Printzhof. After this, five officials turned in their notices and wished to join Armegot's service instead. Risingh persuaded them to stay, but blamed the conflict on the influential position of Armegot and wrote to Sweden for a wife to undermine her status. In 1655, however, New Sweden was conquered by the Dutch. The Printzhof, where Armegot had allowed her neighbors to hide their valuables, was looted. When her possession of Printzhof was questioned by the Dutch, she had her ownership of Printzhof, as well as her possession of Fort Tinicum, confirmed by the Dutch governor in New Amsterdam. In 1662, she sold Printzhof to Dutch merchant Joost de la Grange (1623-1664). She traveled to the Netherlands to collect her payment, but was not paid. She visited her family in Sweden, and upset the local church authorities by her refusal to submit to her husband. In 1663, she returned to America to claim the payment for Printzhof, which was now owned by de la Grange's widow's new husband Andrew Carr. The process was drawn out for years. Meanwhile, she resided at Printztorp (now Chester, Pennsylvania), where she managed an inn, a tavern and a liquor distillery. In 1675, Printzhof was given back to her, and the year after, she sold it and returned to Sweden. She spent her remaining life traveling between the estates of her children and died at Läckö Castle."

  "text" : "Aengus Mac Grianna (born 10 October 1964) is an Irish newsreader for Raidió Teilifís Éireann (RTÉ). Mac Grianna was born in Raheny, a suburb in north Dublin to an Irish language speaking family. His father was a scientist and his mother was a teacher. Mac Grianna was educated solely through Irish. He broadcasts in both Irish and English. Mac Grianna has presented the Oireachtas Media Awards. He lives on an alpaca farm in County Meath just outside Ashbourne with his husband Terry Gill who he married in June 2014. His first job was in the Arnotts Sports Department where he earned £80 per week. He is a fan of Desperate Housewives and Coronation Street and supports Dublin and Manchester United. Mac Grianna was considered a favourite to replace iconic newsreader Anne Doyle when she retired on 25 December 2011. On 9 January 2013, a video of Mac Grianna surfaced on YouTube showing him being caught unaware whilst applying some make-up to his face as he prepared for a live bulletin on RTÉ's digital news channel News Now. The presenter did not realise the cameras were rolling after a technical error meant that footage of Mac Grianna readying himself for the broadcast was shown instead of the title sequence. The incident quickly became an internet sensation with over one million YouTube hits in the first couple of days. Aengus commented on it by saying \".. I saw the fun in it. You have to laugh at yourself as well, I think that’s important.\" In August 2013, he came second in Celebrity MasterChef Ireland."

  "text" : "Alexander Rollett (14 July 1834 – 1 October 1903) was an Austrian physiologist and histologist born in Baden bei Wien, Niederösterreich. He studied with Ernst Wilhelm von Brücke (1819–1892) in Vienna, and in 1863 became a professor of physiology and histology at the University in Graz. He was a prime factor in making Graz an international center for physiological training and education. Between 1872 and 1903 he was rector of the university four times, and from 1893 was president of the Styrian Medical Association. He was a member of the Austrian Academy of Sciences (1864), a corresponding member of the Societas Medicorum Svecana (1882) and the Royal Bavarian Academy of Sciences (1892). He was the author of numerous scientific papers on gastric glands, connective tissue, blood cells, tendons, nerves, etc. He also penned treatises on the construction and physiology of striated muscle fibers, and works involving the eye and eyesight that discussed topics such as binocular vision, color in Newton's rings and subjective color. His name is associated with \"Rollett's stroma\", being defined as an insoluble, spongy network forming the framework of a red blood cell. Embedded within the interstices of Rollett's stroma is hemoglobin. Rollett was politically active, serving as a member of the Styrian Parliament and as a city council member in Graz. He was the grandson of naturalist Georg Anton Rollett (1778–1842), a nephew of poet Hermann Rollett (1819–1904), and the father of author Edwin Rollett (1889–1964) and physician Octavia Aigner-Rollett (1877–1959)."

In Genoa, he may have encountered a work of St Jerome by Jan van Eyck. A fresco of St Bernardino (1451) at the church of San Francesco at Gualdo Tadino in attributed to Antonio.

  "text" : "Alban Schachleiter (20 January 1861 – 20 June 1937) was a Roman Catholic Benedictine monk and musicologist. He was closely associated with the Nazis, and with Adolf Hitler personally. Schachleiter first became closely associated with the NSDAP, and with Hitler, in late 1922. Originally from Mainz, he served as the long-time abbot of the Emmaus monastery in Prague before being forced out of that position in late 1918 following the establishment of the new Czechoslovak state. After brief stays at several Austrian monasteries, including St. Florian near Linz, by early 1920, he was at Munich's St. Boniface's Abbey. By September 1922 he was noticed for the radicalism of his anti-Semitic agitation and his involvement with groups like the volkisch Bund Bayern und Reich. He cultivated connections with members of Munich's Catholic elite, including w:de:Karl Alexander von Müller, professor of history at the University of Munich and Helene Raff, whose father was the composer Joachim Raff. With Muller he discussed politics and Gregorian chant. Through these connections he first met Hitler in late 1922; the pair were observed by both Muller and Ernst Hanfstaengl engaging in lively and lengthy conversation. It was the beginning of a relationship that ended only with Schachleiter's death in 1937. The meeting opened the way for Schachleiter to play an important propagandist role on behalf of the NSDAP in the summer of 1923. Following the commemorative activities of 10 June 1923, which included a massive rally in honour of Albert Leo Schlageter, staged on Munich's Konigsplatz and attended by 20-30000 activists—a Catholic memorial mass was held immediately after the rally in St. Boniface Abbey, organised exclusively by the NSDAP which was presided over by Schachleiter. Hanfstaengl had sketched out for Hitler the symbolic impact a related Catholic-Nazi mass for Schlagater would have on Munich's Catholic population—Schachleiter could also consecrate the standards of the SA. Hitler quickly agreed. Schachleiter delivered a eulogistic sermon that was remembered as having a powerful impact—a young and devoutly pious Heinrich Himmler joined the NSDAP in the wake of Schachleiters eulogy. A year later however, Schachleiter was writing to Oswald Spengler lamenting the impact of Erich Ludendorff and his anti-Catholic followers on the movement—following the refounding of the NSDAP in early 1925 the stronghold of the Nazi movement in Bavaria would no longer be Munich but rather the Protestant regions of Mittel- and Oberfranken. Schachleiter increasingly distanced himself from the NSDAP in the mid-1920s, although he maintained an idealised image of Hitler personally. Schachleiter continued for years to be angry at Ludendorff's anti-Catholic crusade following the putsch of November 1923—after maintaining his weekly Schola Gregoriana at the Allerheiligen-Hofkirche in Munich until 1930, he then moved to a newly built country house in Bad Feilnbach where he was still living when Hitler came to power in 1933. In late spring Schachleiter wrote to Cardinal Faulhaber—\"it seems to me to be a catastrophe that the Holy Church stands aloof from the new freedom movement, whose triumph I foresaw, and that the massive uprising of the volk, which is now lifting our poor fatherland out of its misery and shame, may well go down in history as a triumph of Protestantism.\"  Faulhaber forbade Schachleiter from performing masses within the archdiocese, and Schachleiter reluctantly refused Hitler's request for him to come to Berlin on 20 March 1933 to perform a personal mass for the fuhrer. Hitler visited in mid-May to personally congratulate Schachleiter on his 50th anniversary as a Benedictine. His invitation to sit among the Nazi dignitaries at the Nuremberg party rally in 1934, which he accepted, (and an enduring image through Leni Riefenstahl's Triumph of the Will), showed him \"on the sidelines as the Nazis' striking, yet thoroughly secularized, performative aesthetic played out before him.\" From 1933-1936 Schachleiter spent much energy campaigning against what he saw as peripheral Nazi personalities directing the Nazis in an anti-Catholic and anti-Christian direction—and particularly the ideology advanced by Alfred Rosenberg. Schachleiter regarded this as a restraint on a renewal of wide-ranging Catholic support for the NSDAP. Schachleiter eventually wrote more than two dozen appeals to a variety of Nazi officials, including Hans Lammers, but was ignored. In September 1936 he admitted privately to a friend that, \"a believing Christian can no longer participate [in the NSDAP]; they do not want believing Christians in the party.\" Publicly he continued to profess loyalty to the Führer and to the church. Following his death in June 1937 the Nazis ordered a state funeral arranged by Bavarian minister-president Ludwig Siebert. A year later the editorial leadership of the Beobachter refused attempts to publish official commemorations. According to historian Derek Hastings, by 1937, Schachleiter's vision of a renewed Catholic-Nazi synthesis had become increasingly marginal."

He trained at Point Cook in 1926, and following graduation accepted a Short Service Commission in the Royal Air Force (RAF) as there were no places available in the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) at the time. After four years service in Egypt and Palestine, he returned to Australia and was commissioned into the Citizen Air Force, flying with No. 1 Squadron at Laverton, where he gained flying instructor qualifications. Soon after, he was employed by Guinea Airways as an aircraft captain, and spent five years in Papua and New Guinea (PNG), gaining fame as the rescuer of the Archbold expedition. Koch was transferred to the RAAF Active Reserve upon going to PNG. He joined Qantas a year before World War II broke out, employed predominantly on the Singapore route. He was unfortunate to be the captain of the only Qantas aircraft known to be shot down during that war, when the Short Empire flying boat Corio was lost off Timor (Circe disappeared in 1942, possibly also shot down, and Corinna was destroyed by enemy action on the water at Broome, Western Australia). Post war he was recruited by Lester Brain at the formation of Trans Australia Airlines (TAA), specifically to be Senior Pilot DC4 Skymaster. At 45, he retired from active flying to become Inspector of Safety and Accidents, TAA."

Although he lived in Warsaw for most of his life, Bogucki also worked in several other cities. He lived in Warsaw's Mariensztat neighborhood from 1947 until the end of his life, and he is buried in the Powązki Cemetery in the western part of Warsaw. Bogucki was awarded the Order of Polonia Restituta for his career and actions during World War II. In 1978 the Yad Vashem institute awarded him and his wife the Righteous Among The Nations award, an award given to non-Jewish people who helped Jews during the Nazi persecution."

  "text" : "Alfred Nailer Jacobs MM (11 July 1897 – 26 January 1976) was an Australian medical practitioner and campaigner for civil liberties and Aboriginal rights. Jacobs was born at Surrey Hills in Melbourne to English-born warehouseman Henry Atwood Jacobs and Amy Lilian, née Scales. He attended Scotch College and the University of Melbourne but suspended his education during World War I to enlist in the Australian Imperial Force (5 January 1916), serving on the Western Front in the 15th Field Ambulance. He won the Military Medal for his actions on 29–30 September 1918 at Bellicourt, where he evacuated the wounded under heavy fire for thirty-six hours continuously. He completed his degree after the war, qualifying with a Bachelor of Medicine and a Bachelor of Surgery. He moved to Western Australia and took up a position on the staff of Fremantle Hospital. On 6 January 1929 Jacobs married nurse Eva Ivy May Hurst in the chapel at Perth College. He worked at Harvey during the Depression and joined the Douglas Credit Party, of which he was vice-president in 1933. He ran unsuccessfully for the Senate in 1934 (for Social Credit) and for the Western Australian Legislative Council in 1944 (for Labor) and 1968 (as an independent). He jointly founded the Western Australian branch of the Australian Council for Civil Liberties and the rise of fascist ideologies drove him towards the left of the political spectrum; he was under surveillance from the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation. Jacobs and his family moved to Narrogin in 1940, where he became involved in Aboriginal welfare. He was one of the founders of the Narrogin Native Welfare Committee in 1946, which campaigned for full citizenship rights and better opportunities for indigenous people. During this period Jacobs began to suffer from tuberculosis, and he was hospitalised in 1947, 1950, 1952 and 1955. He fought vigorously against Robert Menzies' attempt to ban the Communist Party, but denied involvement in the party itself; he occupied himself as a civil liberties and Aboriginal rights campaigner. Jacobs died at Narrogin in 1976."

Both he and Hackett well over 6'4\" made worthy adversaries in the famous duelling scene from 'Zenda'. It was the most famous duelling scene in the American theatre at the turn of the 20th century. Hoops moved on to silent film in 1914. As his screen career progressed Hoops appeared in several films with Mary Pickford, one film with Marguerite Clark and finished his career in over half a dozen films at Metro Studios starring early screen vamp Olga Petrova. Hoops died in Los Angeles at 46 following a heart attack."

The great vocalist Amir Khan considered Aman Ali to be a major musical influence in his life. Aman Ali left Bombay in 1947 and settled in Pune. He contracted pneumonia while visiting Delhi for concerts and died on February 11, 1953. His style influenced Amir Khan and Vasantrao Deshpande. His disciples include T. D.

  "text" : "Anthony Knivet, also Anthony Knyvett or Antonie Knivet (fl. 1591-1649), was an English sailor who fell into Portuguese hands in Brazil, lived for a while with a native Brazilian tribe, and wrote about his adventures after his eventual return to Britain. He was an illegitimate son of Sir Henry Knyvet of Charlton, Wiltshire. In 1591 he joined an English privateer, Thomas Cavendish, on a voyage aimed at raiding Portuguese holdings in Brazil. Cavendish was at the height of his fame, having completed a successful voyage around the world from 1586 to 1588. After Cavendish's men had raided the town of Santos and destroyed several Portuguese sugar plantations, they traveled on and eventually left Knivet, who had developed frostbite in the Strait of Magellan, along with nineteen other sick or mutinous men on the then remote island of Ilhabela. He was captured by the Portuguese and was put to work as a slave on a sugar plantation. Later he was tasked with traveling inland and contacting natives in order to obtain more slaves. After a failed escape attempt, he was sent back to a plantation, where he attacked his owner and fled again. He met a native who had also fled from slavery, and together they made it to an indigenous Brazilian tribe of Tupí people, where they stayed for nine months. Sold for metal tools back to the Portuguese, he was forced to work for the governor of Rio de Janeiro, Salvador Correia de Sá, o Velho. He managed to escape to West Africa (Congo and Angola). The Rio governor obtained his extradition to Brazil and he then returned with the governor to Portugal, from where he finally made his way back to England in 1601. Upon return, Knivet wrote his memoir and sold it to Richard Hakluyt, who sold it on to Samuel Purchas. Purchas published an abbreviated version in his Purchas his Pilgrimes (1613) and a more complete version under the title \"The Admirable Adventures and Strange Fortunes of Master Antonie Knivet, which went with Master Thomas Candish in his Second Voyage to the South Sea, 1591\" in Purchas his Pilgrimes, part IV, book 6, chapter 7 (London 1625). This work was reprinted in 1906. Excerpts about his time in Africa were published as \"Appendix I: Anthony Knivet in Kongo and Angola\" of The strange adventures of Andrew Battell of Leigh, in Angola and the adjoining regions, 1901. While Knivet's descriptions of Brazil are generally precise and believable, his writing about Africa contains several mistakes and contradictions. The published memoir suffers from Purchas' deletion of several sections; it is possible that these were motivated by his negative attitude towards Catholicism. Anthony Knivet went on to become co-teller of the Royal Mint, thanks to intervention by his uncle Thomas Knyvet who had served as Warden of the Mint and was famous for having foiled the Gunpowder Plot."

  "text" : "Abba Estifanos (English Translation: Father Stephen) was an Ethiopian Christian monk, itinerant preacher and martyr who is known for his reformation movement and as an early dissident of the Ethiopian Orthodox Church and Emperor Zara Ya'iqob in the 15th century. His followers were known as Stephanites and were known for advocating sola gratia (salvation by grace alone through faith, not of works), soli Deo gloria (veneration to God alone and not to religious icons and saints) and for their asceticism. Over the course of a century of persecution by clergy and five consecutive kings following Zara Ya'iqob, membership in the Stephanites movement dwindled and vanished.Estifanos was a proponent of soli Deo gloria which placed him at odds with Ethiopian Orthodox Church authorities and Emperor Zara Ya'iqob as his teachings deemed prostration as an act reserved to God alone and hence the teaching of The Church of Ethiopia that prostration for veneration of saints, angelic beings, religious icons and monarch (Zara Ya'iqob) was wrong. His reformation movement taking place close to seventy years prior to European Protestant reformation, the similar tenets that it has with Protestantism and the exponential growth of Evangelicals membership in Ethiopia in the late 20th century has sparked a new interest in his life and that of his followers."

After the peace, he opened an academy for young ladies in Philadelphia, for which occupation, however, his irritable temper unfitted him. In 1788 he began to publish the Federal Gazette (changed in 1793 to the Philadelphia Gazette), the channel through which many of the friends of the federal constitution addressed the public. He was the first who regularly reported the debates in Congress. His death (on 4th February 1797) was caused by injuries received while fruitlessly endeavoring to save his wife and three children from the fire which destroyed his establishment eight days previously. His son Andrew until 1803 carried on the Gazette; but, taking the British side in politics, he became unpopular, and removed to England, where he died in 1847.\""

She sat for more of his finished works than any other of his more well-known muses, including Elizabeth Siddall, Jane Morris and Fanny Cornforth. Comparatively little is known about Wilding, while Rossetti's other models, Siddall, Morris and Cornforth, are frequently written about. This is perhaps partly due to the lack of any romantic or sexual connection between the pair, which differentiates Rossetti's relationship with Wilding from those with his other muses."

He was born in Neumarkt-Sankt Veit. He studied medicine at the Universities of Munich and Vienna, and in 1837 relocated to Tann, Bavaria as a general practitioner. Later, he performed similar duties in Murnau am Staffelsee. In 1845 he moved to Munich, where he opened a small private hospital for treatment of underprivileged sick children. The original facility had six hospital beds with a busy out-patient clinic. Gradually, over the years, the hospital grew in size and stature. In 1850 he obtained his habilitation at Munich, and began teaching clinical courses in pediatrics. In 1853 he was made an \"honorary professor\" with no entitlement to a salary. In 1882 a new hospital building was constructed on the Lindwurmstraße, two years prior to his death."

From 1987 he spent three years as Head Chef at Birmingham's Plough and Harrow Hotel, at a time when its restaurant was among the finest in the Midlands. Antona originally opened Simpsons in Kenilworth, Warwickshire in September 1993, the restaurant's name being taken from that of the chemists shop owned by his father-in-law that used to occupy the property. Simpsons was awarded a Michelin Star in 1999 and moved to a grade II-listed Georgian villa in Edgbaston, Birmingham in 2004, by which time it had built a European-wide reputation. Since then, Antona has opened a second restaurant in Kenilworth, The Cross, which was awarded a Michelin Star in 2014 just shortly after opening."

In Ringsaker municipal council he was elected in 1898 and served for twenty years, and he was also a member of the school board. He participated in his first parliamentary election in 1906, and was elected as a deputy representative to the Parliament of Norway for the Coalition Party, from the constituency Nordre Hedemarken. His running mate E. Svartshoel was not elected, so that Hemma served as a deputy for Liberal Wollert Konow (H). In the 1909 election he narrowly failed re-election as deputy. The Coalition Party was no more, but Hemma had joined the Liberal Left Party. Svartshoel had joined the Conservative Party, and they stood against Konow. Svartshoel and Hemma lost the first round; having carried the municipalities Furnes and Nes but lost Ringsaker. There was a second round of voting, but before it took place, Svartshoel died and Konow was allowed to run unnoposed. In the 1912 election Hemma stood as deputy candidate, and won the first voting round together with his running mate Axel Krogvig. In the second round however, Konow won and carried Nordre Hedemarken. From 1915 to 1918 Hemma was a central board member of the Liberal Left Party. In the 1918 election things had turned around. Wollert Konow was fielded by the Norwegian Agrarian Association with the backing from the Liberal Left and Conservative parties. Hemma stood as his deputy, and they won comfortably. In 1921 there was a new election system with ballot lists; Hemma stood as seventh ballot candidate for the Agrarian Party but without chance of election. In 1924 he was the tenth candidate, in 1927 he was the fourth candidate and was elected as second deputy, and met for some months in Parliament in 1928 and 1930. In 1930 he was the eleventh candidate. He died in August 1950."

  "text" : "George Alan Garton FRS (4 June 1922 in Scarborough, Yorkshire – 13 May 2010) was a British biochemist, and Head of the Lipid Biochemistry Department, at the Rowett Research Institute, now part of the University of Aberdeen. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1978. His candidature citation read: \"Distinguished for his careful, thorough and imaginative studies on digestion, absorption and metabolism of fatty acids, particularly in ruminants. His recent work on branched chain fatty acids is particularly noteworthy. He showed, for example, that in cows fed grass silage the phytanic acid found in their plasma lipids originates from chlorophyll. He then went on to discover other novel branched-chain acids in sheep fed carbohydrate-rich diets. These compounds are of great significance arising, as they do, from excess propionate produced by rumen fermentation. This occurs because the conversion of propionate into methylmalonyl-Coenzyme A (a vitamin B-12 - dependent reaction) is rate-limiting and hence the ability of the animal to channel propionate into the tricarboxylic acid cycle is considerably reduced. This work opens up a completely new field of lipid biochemistry. \" The 55th International Conference on the Bioscience of Lipids, will be held in his memory."

Adam Friedrich von Seinsheim was born in Regensburg on 16 February 1708, the son of Maximilian Franz Graf von Seinsheim (1681-1739) and his wife Anna Philippina Gräfin von Schönborn (1685-1721). His mother was the sister of Franz Georg von Schönborn, Archbishop-Elector of Trier; Friedrich Karl von Schönborn, Prince-Bishop of Bamberg and Würzburg; and Damian Hugo Philipp von Schönborn, Prince-Bishop of Speyer. He became a canon of Bamberg Cathedral and Würzburg Cathedral in 1718. He studied Christian theology at the University of Salzburg (master's degree 1724) and at the Collegium Germanicum 1725-27; and law at the University of Würzburg and Leiden University. In 1747, he became provost of the Church of St. Gangolf in Bamberg. He was ordained as a priest on 29 September 1753. The cathedral chapter of Würzburg Cathedral unanimously elected him Prince-Bishop of Würzburg on 7 January 1755, with Pope Benedict XIV confirming his appointment on 17 March 1755. He was consecrated as a bishop by Cardinal Franz Christoph von Hutten zu Stolzenfels, Prince-Bishop of Speyer, on 15 June 1755. At the insistence of Francis I, Holy Roman Emperor, he was elected Prince-Bishop of Bamberg on 21 April 1757, thus creating a personal union between the Prince-Bishopric of Würzburg and the Prince-Bishopric of Bamberg. The pope confirmed this appointment on 23 May 1757. Adam Friedrich von Seinsheim supported the imperial side during the Seven Years' War. Troops from the Kingdom of Prussia invaded both bishoprics during the course of this war. He died of pneumonia in Würzburg on 18 February 1779 and is buried there."

In 1995, Turani established the East Turkistan National Freedom Center (ETNFC), a non-profit human rights organization based in Washington DC. He is the first person to start the East Turkistan independence movement in the United States. In 2004, Turani set up the \"East Turkistan Government in Exile\" (ETGIE) and was elected Prime Minister."

  "text" : "Ashley Cowie (born 1973) is a Scottish historian, author, photographer, television presenter and producer, who started out studying photography before returning to his homelands of Caithness in the north coast of Scotland. Beginning in 1993, Cowie explored the landscapes of northern Scotland and over the following decade he discovered many pre-historic artefacts including Meolithic & Neolithic flint scatters and carved artefacts. In 2000, Cowie was involved in field walking projects in Caithness which revealed lithic scatters around the shores of Loch Watten and Yarrows, which was new evidence of early prehistoric settlement in Caithness. He went on to discover some of the first flint tools from the Mesolithic lithic scatter at Oliclett in the Yarrows basin which became one of the most significant archeological digs in British history. Cowie began presenting his work in up-beat lectures on the International Science Festival in Orkney where his lecture entitled The Rope Age received a standing ovation from over 100 of the worlds most acclaimed professors of archaeology. After this lecture, Cowie was elected as a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland and his work was featured in several Scotsman Newspaper features. Between 2002 and 2009, Cowie was privately commissioned to conduct research projects at various historic locations and during this time his discoveries in the architecture and symbols of Rosslyn Chapel were published in the best selling \"The Book of Hiram\", where he is credited for having discovered one of the earliest mapping systems known to date. In his own books, The Rosslyn Matrix (2007) and The Rosslyn Templar (2009), he detailed the possible connections between the Clan Sinclair, the chapel and the activities of the Knights Templar. Cowie's last book 'The Super Star - America's Royal Secret' 2011 solves a long-standing historical mystery recounting his discovery of an ancient map, which leads him on an adventure through the Scottish Highlands and finally to a far-flung island where he discovers evidence of the, pre-Columbian, Norse discovery of America. In 2009, Cowie became Resident Historian on STV's The Hour Show, where he wrote and presented a series of live TV episodes discussing the origins of Scottish traditions and superstitions. At this time the Scottish media branded him \"The Hunky Historian\". He next appeared as an expert/sceptical historian on Sky Living TV's 2010 Paranormal Investigation Live where he analysed apparently supernatural occurrences and debunked them with logic and reason. Cowie also appeared as an expert historian in History Channel's Holy Grail in America. In 2011, Cowie was credited as producer, writer and host, of NBC Universal's TV series, Legend Quest. This fast-paced, cinematic, action-adventure series follows Cowie as he travels the world in search of history's greatest and most mysterious artifacts. Each of the six one-hour episodes include  Indiana Jones-type adventure and Da Vinci Code-style puzzle solving. In Legend Quest, Cowie hacks through dense jungles, dives in volcanic lakes, treks through forbidding deserts and climbs some of the highest mountains in the Peruvian Andes. The show premiered on Syfy Channel on 13 July 2011 attracting 1.2 million viewers, boosting SyFy's ratings by 19%. The series is a co-production from BASE Production’s John Brenkus and Mickey Stern and Universal Networks International.Legend Quest has aired in the USA, Canada, Australia, Asia and Europe and premiered in the UK on SyFy Channel on 23 April 2012. Cowie's research was featured in the Scottish Sun's 2012 Lost Treasure Week, where he wrote several articles about his searches for various lost treasures. Cowie recently featured in the documentary series Great Estates Scotland, which aired on PBS in the US and on History Channel in International territories. In 2015 he discovered a witches stella stone and a wizards grave, details of which he published on ashleycowie.com. He also published the results of a 12 year long research project in which he has amassed the world's largest photographic and topographical collection on kerbstone stonemasons marks. In 2016 Cowie published two new non-fiction historical books: Secret Viking Sea Chart and A Twist in Time. He also teamed up with BBC journalist Sarah Mack to present a new series of The People's History Show on STV, beginning September 6th 2016. Taking a look back in time to discover the stories that make up Scotland's People's History, the premier episode covers the tragic story of Benny Lynch, Scotland's greatest boxer, the grizzly tale of Aberdeen's 19th century body-snatchers and the bizarre death in Edinburgh of one of the world's great illusionists."

He has written four novels to this day and is also the editor-in-chief of the Kultura.az website. In 2009, Akbar published a book entitled Artush and Zaur, a homosexual love tale between an Armenian and an Azerbaijani who felt apart after Nagorno-Karabakh War. The book became highly controversial and was banned in bookstores in both Armenia and Azerbaijan which for the past two decades have been bitter rivals due to the ongoing ethnic conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh and where homosexuality is still highly stigmatised."

  "text" : "Barrett Parke was descended from a long line of Irish warriors and aristocrats who settled in Ireland in 1170. Her branch of the Barrett family (motto: Omnia virtute no vi) came originally from Normandy, and is believed to have been among Crusaders who accompanied Richard the Lionheart. Barrett Parke's father, Theobold (Toby) Butler Barrett, was born at Banagher, Ireland, in 1817 and was thirteen years old when the Barretts sailed to Canada and settled in Sorel, Quebec. Upon his marriage in 1850 to Emily Lands, of Pennsylvania Dutch stock, he moved with his new wife to Port Dover, Ontario, where he found a position in Her Majesty’s Customs service. Between 1851 and 1869 Toby and Emily Barrett had eight children, of whom Alice was the fourth and youngest daughter. Born in Port Dover on November 5, 1861, she received an education grounded in Latin and some French. In her diaries, she described her family as large, loving, devout, intellectually lively and close-knit."

  "text" : "Ambrose O'Madden (died 1715) was an Irish prelate of the Roman Catholic Church. He served as the Bishop of Clonfert from 1713 to 1715. He was the parish priest of Loughrea when he was nominated Bishop of Killala and Apostolic Administrator of Kilmacduagh by the Sacred Congregation for the Propagation of the Faith on 30 August 1695. However, the nomination to Killala did not take effect, but he probably acted as administrator of Kilmacduagh. He was made Bishop of Kilmacduagh by Pope Clement XI on 15 November 1703, but the papal brief was delayed until 15 March 1707. Although appointed as Bishop of Kilmacduagh, he remained unconsecrated. On 10 May 1707, Archbishop James Lynch of Tuam wrote to Pope Clement XI saying it would be more convenient for O'Madden to be translated from Kilmacduagh to Clonfert, since O'Madden's parish of Loughrea was in the Diocese of Clonfert. However, it was not judged best at that time, and O'Madden was allowed to retain his parish of Loughrea, along with the see of Kilmacduagh. Six years later, O'Madden was elected Bishop of Clonfert by the Propagation of the Faith on 6 August, and was approved by Pope Clement XI on 22 August 1713. His papal brief was dated 15 September 1713. He was consecrated on 15 April 1714 by Thaddeus O'Rourke, Bishop of Killala. Bishop O'Madden died in office in July 1715."

In 1631, the family was forced to flee when the city was burned down. Later he attended the Gymnasium in Halle, and in 1650 he enrolled at the Law Faculty of the University of Jena. In 1657 he was appointed Hofmeister by Count Albert Anton von Schwarzburg-Rudolstadt. In his legal career, he was clerk of the Court in 1665, and in 1687 Chancellor of Schwarzburg-Rudolstadt. He was the first German legal scholar to deal with the danger of influencing the people by the press. Besides a large number of legal publications, he wrote hymns and devotional writings. He died in Rudolstadt. Johann Sebastian Bach based his chorale cantata Liebster Immanuel, Herzog der Frommen, BWV 123, for Epiphany 1725 on a hymn in six stanzas by Fritsch and used single stanzas in other cantatas. His stanza \"Wie herrlich ist die neue Welt\" (How magnificent is the new world)\" is part Carl Heinrich Graun's oratorio Der Tod Jesu."

In 1906 he attained the chair of general and applied zoology at Lille, and during the following years established a laboratory and museum of applied zoology. During World War I both facilities sustained extensive damage, with restoration and re-installation taking several years to complete, the museum being reopened to the public as late as 1925. In 1919 Malaquin was named chevalier of the Legion d'Honneur, and in 1937 became an officer (year of retirement). A species of monstrillid copepod known as Cymbasoma malaquini (Caullery & Mesnil, 1914) is named after him."

She became heavily involved in songwriting beginning in 1962, and her career took off when she won a contest in her native state with the song \"Hermosísimo Lucero\". In 1969, she moved to Mexico City to attend a music school. Shortly after, she released her first album De la mano del viento. Ochoa is best known for writing songs with strong messages against social injustice as well songs about Mexican history and culture. Most of her lyrics focus on poverty, indigenous rights, and women's rights."

  "text" : "File:Arabella Elizabeth Roupell13.png Arabella Elizabeth Roupell (23 March 1817 Newport, Shropshire – 31 July 1914 Swallowfield, Berkshire) was an English flower painter, noted for an anonymous set of flower paintings published in 1849 under the title 'Specimens of the flora of South Africa by a Lady'. Roupell was the daughter of Rev. John Dryden Piggott, rector and squire of Edgmond, and married Thomas Boone Roupell, an East India Company official, on 16 September 1840. In 1843, shortly after the birth of her eldest son, her husband was posted to the Cape for a period of service leave and she chose to accompany him. During her two-year stay in South Africa Roupell whiled away her leisure hours by painting the local flowers that happened to catch her eye. A visitor to the Cape, Nathaniel Wallich, who was at that time in charge of the Calcutta Botanical Garden, and happened to be a guest at the same Cape Town hotel as the Roupells, was struck by the quality of her work. Wallich accompanied Roupell on collecting trips to the Cape countryside, and introduced her family to his friends Thomas Maclear, the Cape Astronomer Royal, and his wife Mary, leading to a lasting friendship between the women. Among the others Roupell befriended were Baron von Ludwig, planner and developer of the Botanical Garden in Cape Town, and the Kew plant collector, James Bowie. The Roupells returned to Madras in 1845 where Arabella continued her botanical painting. When Wallich retired to London from Calcutta in 1846, he persuaded her to allow him to take along some of her paintings to show to Sir William Jackson Hooker. Hooker was delighted with her work and with Arabella's botanist brother-in-law, George Roupell, chose ten of the plates for publication. Having received the blessing of both Hooker and Wallich, the plates were handed to the eminent Victorian lithographer, Paul Gauci, who prepared the illustrations for the printer W. Nicol of the Shakespeare Press on Pall Mall. The descriptive text accompanying the plates was provided by William Henry Harvey, the Irish botanist. One hundred subscribers were listed, a large portion being from the Peerage, and not counting Victoria, Prince Albert and the Directors of the East India Company. The book was well received not only in England, but also on the Continent, where the author was elected a member of the Regensburg Society of Arts. The work is dedicated to Wallich in recognition of his 'flattering encouragement and scientific guidance' with 'every feeling of grateful and affectionate esteem'. It is thought that only 110 copies of the atlas folio were printed, making the work rare, expensive and highly desirable to collectors. The East India Company was dissolved in 1858 whereupon the Roupells retired to Loddar Court near Reading in Berkshire. By this time the family were financially secure, Thomas having been promoted to sessions judge while in India, and posted first to Coimbatore and later to Cuddalore. Arabella took up landscape gardening and spent part of each year at Sundorne Castle, her father's inheritance in Shropshire. The hundred or so plates that had not been published were located in the 1930s through Elizabeth Chute Roupell, the widow of Norton Aylmer Roupell, and daughter-in-law of the artist. They had passed into the possession of George Roupell, a grandson of the artist and nephew of Elizabeth Chute Roupell. Repeated letters from his aunt and from Pretoria went unanswered by George and the matter seemed to have got nowhere. In a surprising development, a package arrived in Irene from England for General Jan Smuts during his final illness. The parcel remained unopened until after Smuts' death in 1950 when it was passed on to Illtyd Pole-Evans, who in 1930 had accompanied John Hutchinson and Jan Smuts on a two-month botanising expedition through Southern and Northern Rhodesia to Nyasaland and Lake Tanganyika. Pole Evans passed the paintings on to Mary Gunn, librarian at the Botanical Research Institute, who immediately recognised them as the long sought-after collection. After being displayed at an exhibition held at the Johannesburg Public Library in November 1951, the Smuts family presented the paintings to the University of Cape Town, which passed them on to the library of the Bolus Herbarium. Eleven of the plates from this collection were published under the title 'More Cape Flowers by a Lady' in 1964, while the same plates, with the addition of two more and biographical material, appeared under the title 'Arabella Roupell' in 1975. A painting of a Cape Erica, which had been given to Lady d'Urban, Sir Benjamin d'Urban's wife, is now held by the Museum Africa in Johannesburg. Arabella Roupell is commemorated by Protea roupelliae, named by the Swiss botanist Carl Meissner. The short-lived taxon Roupellia grata, a flowering creeper from Sierra Leone and named to honour various members of the Roupell family, was lumped as Strophanthus gratus by the French botanist Henri Ernest Baillon. The standard author abbreviation Roupell is used to indicate this individual as the author when citing a botanical name."

He became deputy botanist at the French Academy of Sciences on January 25, 1716, associate chemist August 11, 1721 and associate botanist August 20, 1722. He signed the Jardin du Roi plant catalogue in 1709. He collected numerous plants from the Parisian region, where he worked with Rournefort, Sébastien Valliant and Antoine de Jussieu. His herbarium, purchased by Philibert Commerson and then by Adrien-Henri de Jussieu is conserved in the National Museum of Natural History (France)."

He worked as a lawyer for the Supreme Court of Prussia until 1934, when he emigrated to the United States after the Nazis banned Jews from entering courthouses. He subsequently worked for a shoe manufacturer in Virginia. In 1943 he married Katharine Scherman, and was made comptroller of the Book-of-the-Month Club, which had been founded by Ms. Scherman's father Harry Scherman in 1926. Rosin became president of the company in 1960, a position he held until 1973, and was then chairman until his retirement in 1979. His decision in 1967 to pay $250,000 for the right to offer William Manchester's book, The Death of a President as a club selection helped to foster the company's resurgence. During Rosin's leadership the company's annual sales doubled and membership reached 1.25 million. Overseeing the Scherman Foundation, Rosin was responsible for distributing grant monies to organizations promoting the arts, social welfare programs, the environment, disarmament, and reproductive rights."

He was the head of the Estonian Writers' Union in 1939–1940 and in 1944–1946 (then known as Writers' Union of the Estonian SSR). From August 1940, Jakobson was a member of a Soviet censorship committee. From 1950 to 1958 he was the head of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Estonian Soviet Socialist Republic.

Since 2005 he has been well known as a news presenter for Segodnia (Today), usually appearing with Lilia Gildeeva, and for his own TV projects. At the beginning of his TV career, Pivovarov was a protégé of Leonid Parfyonov. In 2004-2005 when Parfyonov was fired from NTV, Pivovarov supported him with a sarcastic comment on the air, and was suspended from the evening news as punishment. In 2008-2011 Pivovarov made five historical films for Russian TV. The news agency Reuters called Pivovarov \"an unlikely opposition hero\" after the website of the newspaper Kommersant reported that he allegedly refused to read the news on December 8, 2011 if he could not report on the ongoing protests in Moscow, which were being ignored by the state-controlled media. The next day, reports on the protests were included in the evening NTV news report, and other channels followed their example. NTV denied that Pivovarov had made any ultimatum, and Pivovarov himself never confirmed the report. Pivovarov is married to journalist Anna Schneider, and has a son named Ivan."

  "text" : "Arthur Augustus Allen (28 December 1885 – 17 January 1964) was an American ornithologist. Allen was born in Buffalo, New York, the son of Daniel Williams Allen and Anna née Moore. He studied at Cornell University, where he obtained his Bachelor of Arts in 1907, his Master of Arts in 1908 and his Ph.D. in 1911. His thesis is entitled \"The Red-Winged Blackbird: A Study in the Ecology of a Cattail Marsh\". From 1911 to 1912 he went on an expedition to Colombia, and from 1912 to 1916, he was appointed an instructor in zoology at Cornell. Allen married Elsa Guerdrum in 1913. They had five children. His wife also received a doctorate at Cornell and pursued a successful career as a historian of ornithology. Arthur continued his career at Cornell until his retirement in 1953, becoming an assistant professor in 1916, and a professor in 1926. After his retirement, he was a public lecturer for the National Audubon Society from 1953 to 1959. It has been estimated that over 10,000 students took his courses, including over 100 doctoral students, at a time when Cornell was the only institution to offer advanced degrees in ornithology. Through his work, Allen introduced the field of ornithology to generations of professionals and amateurs. Allen released a published an ornithological history in 1933 under the title Fifty Years' Progress of American Ornithology, 1883–1933. He was dedicated to promoting the study of birds to a wide audience, in his books, films and public lectures. His Book of Bird Life (1930, reissued in 1961) was a well-written introduction to ornithology for its time. He also conducted pioneering studies on recording bird songs in 1929 which led to the first record on the phonograph of bird songs in 1932. He worked on what eventually became the independent Cornell Lab of Ornithology in 1955, and founded the Wildlife Society in 1936, leading the organisation from 1938 to 1939."

Collecting butterflies from his youth, he published his first publication (The Butterflies of Woodbury County) in 1914. For his Ph.d. he studied the private Lepidoptera collection of William Barnes (1860-1930) in Decatur, Illinois.That began a friendship with James Halliday McDunnough (1877-1962) Barnes curator. In 1919, he argued his doctoral thesis entitled The Hesperioidea of America, North of Mexico. The same year, he replaced McDunnough, as Curator at Decatur a function he held until 1921. Barnes and Lindsey published in the same year a revision of the Pterophoroidea. Lindsey was the main author. After teaching at Morningside College, he became in 1922 Professor and Director of the Department of Zoology of Denison University in Granville, Ohio. He retained these functions until his retirement in 1960. Lindsey was the author of many works on the Hesperioidea, including a revision of his thesis in 1931 under the title of Hesperiidae of North America with Roswell Carter Williams Jr (1869-1946) and Ernest Layton Bell (1876-1964). He was also the author of five books on Zoology as well as on genetics and evolution. He also directed the publication, from 1945 to 1948 of the Annals of the Entomological Society of America.

  "text" : "Armand Deperdussin (1860 in Liège, Belgium – June 11, 1924 in Paris) was a French industrialist and aviation pioneer. Having established himself as a silk-broker, he became involved in the aviation industry in 1910 after witnessing the triumphs of aviator Louis Blériot, founding Société de Production des Aéroplanes Deperdussin. In 1912 he bought Champagne Airfield, and built 30 workshops and other buildings, founding one of the first flying schools. He hired aircraft designer Louis Béchereau, who designed monohull aircraft whose streamlined shapes achieved previously unattainable performance. With dedicated staff and revolutionary technical advances, the company won many prizes, especially the famous international Gordon Bennett Trophy in France in 1912 with pilot Jules Védrines, who became the first pilot to fly over 100 mph [169.6 km/h (105.4 mph)], and again in 1913 with pilot Maurice Prévost, who flew 200.8 km/h (124.8 mph). The company went bankrupt in August 1913, and Deperdussin was disgraced in 1913 when he was accused of obtaining bank loans by fraud and forgery. He was not brought to trial until 1917, and on March 30, 1917 he was convicted of embezzling 32 million francs from his company, fined 1,000 francs, and jailed for five years The company was renamed the Société Pour L'Aviation et ses Dérivés (SPAD) when it was taken over by Blériot Aéronautique in 1914. Deperdussin committed suicide in 1924."

  "text" : "Athanasius (Greek: Ἀθανάσιος) was a 6th-century Byzantine official who served as envoy and praetorian prefect of Italy and Africa under Emperor Justinian I (r. 527–565). Nothing is known of Athanasius's origins or early life. The historian Procopius of Caesarea and the African poet Corippus record only that by 545 he was elderly. Two members of Athanasius's family are known: his brother, the comes and senator Alexander, who led embassies to Sassanid Persia and Ostrogothic Italy in the early 530s, and his son-in-law Leontius, who led an embassy to the Franks in 551. Athanasius first appears in 536, when he was sent to Italy alongside Peter the Patrician to accept the surrender of Gothic forces, as Peter and the Ostrogothic king, Theodahad, had agreed in previous embassies. Theodahad, however, upon learning of Byzantine reversals in Dalmatia and of the death there of the general Mundus in battle with Gothic forces, took heart and resolved to resist the Byzantine attack. The two Byzantine envoys were arrested, while the war recommenced. They remained imprisoned in Ravenna for three years, until released in June/July 539 by the new Gothic king, Witigis, in exchange for Gothic envoys sent to Persia who had been captured by the Byzantines. On their arrival in Constantinople, Emperor Justinian rewarded them both with high office, appointing Peter as his magister officiorum and Athanasius as praetorian prefect of Italy. Athanasius arrived again in Italy in the early spring of 540, but little is known of his tenure, except that he accompanied the commanders dispersed by Belisarius around Italy, perhaps to organize their supplies. Athanasius probably held the post until summer/autumn 542, when replaced by Maximinus, but seems to have remained in Italy as late as 544. In early 545, shortly after his return from Italy, Emperor Justinian dispatched Athanasius as praetorian prefect to Africa, alongside the aged senator Areobindus, who was named as the province's new magister militum. Areobindus soon faced a military revolt led by the dux Numidiae, Guntharic. In March 546, Guntharic seized Carthage and imprisoned Athanasius and Areobindus. When summoned before the rebel, Athanasius presented himself as his supporter and took care to flatter Guntharic. This, and his advanced age, may have saved him later, when Areobindus was murdered during a dinner in the palace. According to Corippus, Athanasius then masterminded the palace coup that murdered Guntharic and restored Byzantine imperial control over Africa a few months later: the Armenian officer Artabanes murdered the rebel at a banquet. Although Procopius does not mention Athanasius's role, according to the authors of the PLRE this is likely because Artabanes, or one of his close associates, was Procopius's source for the episode. At any rate, after Guntharic's death, Athanasius moved quickly to secure control of his treasury. Athanasius continued in office and was instrumental in the reorganization of the Byzantine forces under John Troglita in the winter of 547/548, following the disastrous defeat at the Battle of Marta. He was still in office circa 550, but he was replaced at the latest by September 552. Nothing further is known of him, although he may be the same as the senator Athanasius who was sent to Lazica in 556 to investigate the murder of king Gubazes II by the Byzantine generals stationed there, and to examine the accusations of treason levelled by the latter against Gubazes."

  "text" : "Albert Edwin Lynch (10 December 1900 - 23 August 1976) was a musician and Catholic priest. Lynch was born in Collie, Western Australia to Ernest Lynch and Elizabeth Lynch (née Stewart). He was raised an Anglican and educated at state schools. He received his first musical training from Sister Monica at St Joseph's Convent in Boulder. In the early 1920s his talent as a violinist earned him a place in orchestras supporting silent movies and enabled him to perform solo recitals on the wireless. Joseph Nowotny became his mentor. The Rivervale Progress Association sponsored the first of a series of concerts to raise the £1000 needed to send Lynch to Belgium in 1923 to study under Emile Marchot at the Conservatoire Royal de Musique de Bruxelles for three and a half years. During his time in Belgium he was converted to Catholicism. Lynch began to study for the priesthood at Pontifical Urban College of Propaganda Fide, Rome in 1930. Lynch was ordained priest in St John Lateran Basilica on 16 March 1935. He returned to Western Australia where he was appointed curate of Palmyra in October 1935. In 1938 he formed an all-male choir at St Mary's Cathedral, Perth, which he conducted for fifteen years. In conjunction with Christian Brothers' College, St George's Terrace, he established Western Australia's first Catholic choir school. He served on the music examinations board of the University of Western Australia. He was the college chaplain of Aquinas College in Salter Point from 1938-1942. He was to become the founding parish priest of Applecross in 1952, which he dedicated to St. Benedict. He stayed at Applecross parish until he retired in 1973. Lynch died on 23 August 1976 at Applecross and was buried in Karrakatta Cemetery."

  "text" : "Axel Maurer (12 April 1866 – 1925) was a Norwegian stagewriter, editor and theatre director. He was born in Kristiania. He took the law degree cand.jur. in 1889, but did not practise as a lawyer, as he instead traveled abroad to study theatre. From 1895 to 1896 he was the artistic and financial director of the Karl Johan Theatre in Kristiania. This theatre had been established in 1893 in the premises of Kristiania Tivoli, and led by Olaf Hansson before Maurer took over, but it went defunct in 1896. During this period he wrote and issued the play Lykkens Pamphilius, which was staged at Sekondteatret in 1900 to mediocre reviews. The same reception happened to his next play, Kundskabens Træ, staged in November 1897 at Christiania Theatre. His play Babylons konge, staged at Nationaltheatret, received somewhat more mixed reviews. Another play, Arilda, was accepted by Nationaltheatret, but probably never staged. Maurer edited the humorous magazine Tyrihans from 1898 to 1899. His songbook Kristiania-viser, issued in 1906 with new lyrics to known melodies, was received well. He also embarked on recitation tours in Norway as well as in Denmark (1909), the US (1910) and Germany (1911). In 1917 he issued the novel Den store kjærlighed, and the humoresques Portnøklen and Mindebægeret in 1918 and 1919 respectively. Maurer was not uncontroversial. In 1905, when Norway was about to dissolve the union with Sweden, he attacked the Negotiations in Karlstad in a leaflet which was sold on the street. The leaflet was soon forbidden by the Norwegian authorities, who did not want a critical viewpoint on the negotiations, according to the diaries of Johan Castberg. In 1915 Maurer attended the general assembly of Nationaltheatret. In the open discussion at the assembly, he denounced the presence of a \"camorra\" in Norwegian art and literature, which acted as a \"secret society\". The \"camorra\" had a secret influence over which plays were staged, and which artists that received grants. The purported \"chairman\" of this \"camorra\" was theatre critic Sigurd Bødtker. A debate was called in Kunstforeningen, where Maurer was asked to back his allegations up. During the debate it was pointed to a work by Axel Borge, which had supposedly been refused under murky circumstances, but Borge himself appeared to deny this and support Bødtker. Bødtker denied the claim of a camorra, and stated that the probable reason for the attack was the refusal of one of Maurer's plays. Maurer was strongly attacked by Nils Kjær, and also received unfavourable comments from Peter Egge, Hjalmar Christensen and Arnulf Øverland. He died in 1925, only 59 years old. A street in Oslo, Axel Maurers vei, was named after him in 1934."

He has also written a bestselling novel titled Terrorist Number 20 (2006). The book recalls his teenage years as a religious extremist and was inspired in part by Ahmad Alnami, one of the 9/11 hijackers and a fellow resident of Abha who was vaguely familiar to Thabit. In April 2006, three months after the release of the book, Thabit was forced to move from Abha to Jeddah with his family after receiving death threats. In 2009-10, Thabit was recognised by the Beirut39 project as one of the best writers in the Arab world under the age of 40. His work has appeared in English translation in the Beirut39 anthology, edited by Samuel Shimon."

  "text" : "Anantavarman Chodaganga Deva (1077-1150) was a ruler of the Eastern Ganga dynasty during its apogee, which ruled southern part of Kalinga, India. He was the son of Rajaraja Deva and Rajasundari, the daughter of Virarajendra Chola. The Chola king Kulothunga Chola I of the Chola dynasty was his uncle. However, Sen states Anantavarman was the maternal grandson of Kulottunga. The Jagannath Temple at Puri was rebuilt in the 11th century atop its ruins by Anantavarman Chodaganga. King Chodaganga was originally a Shaivite from Srimukhalingam who became a Vaishnava under the influence of Ramanuja when he visited Jagannath Puri. Despite Kulothunga Chola I being his maternal uncle, it did not stop the Chola sovereign from burning Anantavarman's empire. Historians propose that it was probably because the king failed to pay his rent for two consecutive years. He was ousted by Kulothunga's general Karunakara Thondaiman and this victory is detailed in the Tamil classic Kalingattupparani. Monarchs from this region of the subcontinent regularly assumed the title Chodaganga Deva throughout the ancient and medieval periods to allude to their Chola and Ganga heritage From various inscriptions it is known that King Anantavarman Chodaganga Deva established the present temple some time near the end of the eleventh century. A copper plate inscription made by King Rajaraja III found on the Tirumala Venkateswara Temple near the north entrance states that Jagannath temple was built by Gangesvara, i.e., Anantavarman Chodaganga Deva. Later, King Ananga Bhima Deva II (1170–1198) did much to continue the work of Chodaganga Deva, building the walls around the temple and many of the other shrines on the temple grounds. He is thus often considered one of the builders of the temple. He also did much to establish the regulations around the service to the Deity. A scion of this dynasty made rich donations to the Koneswaram temple, Trincomalee on Puthandu, 1223 CE in the name of King Chodaganga Deva. Shortly afterwards, the Konark temple was constructed in Orissa."

  "text" : "Alexander V. Markov (born October 24, 1965) is a Russian biologist, paleontologist, popularizer of science. Prize winner (2011) of the main Russian prize for popular science (\"Prosvetitel\"). Markov graduated from the Moscow State University (Faculty of Biology) in 1987. He has been working in the Paleontological Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences since 1987. Doctor of biological sciences, Senior Research Professor of the Paleontological Institute, RAS. Professor of the RAS. In collaboration with Andrey Korotayev he has demonstrated that a rather simple mathematical model can be developed to describe in a rather accurate way the macrotrends of biological evolution. They have shown that changes in biodiversity through the Phanerozoic correlate much better with hyperbolic model (widely used in demography and macrosociology) than with exponential and logistic models (traditionally used in population biology and extensively applied to fossil biodiversity as well). The latter models imply that changes in diversity are guided by a first-order positive feedback (more ancestors, more descendants) and/or a negative feedback arising from resource limitation. Hyperbolic model implies a second-order positive feedback. The hyperbolic pattern of the world population growth has been demonstrated by Korotayev to arise from a second-order positive feedback between the population size and the rate of technological growth. According to Markov and Korotayev, the hyperbolic character of biodiversity growth can be similarly accounted for by a feedback between the diversity and community structure complexity. They suggest that the similarity between the curves of biodiversity and human population probably comes from the fact that both are derived from the interference of the hyperbolic trend with cyclical and stochastic dynamics."

When Sterry left Lytton's company, he was given the stage and film rights to the play The Man They Could Not Hang, based on the life story of John Babbacombe Lee, including Lytton's 1912 version of the story. Sterry took the film on the road and enjoyed great commercial success exhibiting it, often giving lectures at screenings. He produced his own film version of this story in 1921, as well as a film adaptation of The Waybacks (1918). He kept distributing films and dabbling in a number of areas, including retail and property investment, up until his death."

  "text" : "Anatoly Aleksandrovich Roshchin (Russian: Анатолий Александрович Рощин, 10 March 1932 – 5 January 2016) was a heavyweight Greco-Roman wrestler from Russia. Between 1962 and 1972 he won nine medals at the Summer Olympics and world championships, including four gold medals. Roshchin lost his father during World War II and had to start working as a shepherd aged 10. In 1950, seeking a better job, he moved from his village to Moscow. At the time he trained in weightlifting and basketball and changed to wrestling only in 1954, while serving in the Soviet Navy. His career was interrupted in 1957, when he was diagnosed with a thyroid disorder that required a complex surgery. He recovered by 1960, and in 1961 placed second at the Soviet championships. He also placed second at the 1962 World Championships and 1964 and 1968 Olympics, losing to István Kozma on all occasions, but won the world and Olympic titles in 1963, 1969, 1970 and 1970. Roshchin needed to wind himself up 10–15 minutes before a bout, and for this purpose would often start a friendly verbal brawl with teammates. By 1972, when he was 40 years old, he was already working as a coach and looking into retirement. He was convinced to compete at the Munich Olympics by the Soviet Sports minister Sergey Pavlov, and won the gold medal. In the last bout he won by default against Wilfried Dietrich, who had a spectacular victory earlier in the tournament and did not want to spoil it by a potential loss. Roshchin retired after the Olympics and later worked as a sports instructor and an international wrestling referee."

  "text" : "Albert \"Ginger\" Baker (born c. 1951) is a Northern Irish former loyalist and ex-British Army soldier who was convicted of four murders carried out by the Ulster Defence Association (UDA), of which he was a leading member. He turned himself in to the police in 1973 after throwing a hand grenade into a bus transporting Catholic workmen in East Belfast, Northern Ireland, which killed one man. He admitted to this killing and those of three other Catholics the previous year, as well as 11 armed robberies. He was sentenced to 25 years imprisonment for the four murders. Baker claimed he was a British intelligence agent and member of the Military Reconnaissance Force (MRF). He gave evidence against his former UDA associates, including Ned McCreery, in the murder trial of the \"romper room\" torture and killing of James McCartan on 3 October 1972. This made him Northern Ireland's first loyalist supergrass. Although McCreery had assisted in the torture of McCartan, Baker had actually carried out the shooting. Baker's testimony, however, proved inconsistent and was given with the aim of minimising his own role in the killing, so the judge dropped the charges against McCreery and the others. McCreery was also involved in the grenade attack. Baker contacted the Stevens Inquiry team in 1989 and alleged that the security forces assisted in the majority of loyalist paramilitary attacks in the 1970s by providing the UDA and Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF) with the necessary intelligence to facilitate them. He confirmed that loyalist paramilitaries had perpetrated the 1974 Dublin and Monaghan bombings and stated that \"half the assassinations in Northern Ireland in the early 1970s would not have been committed without RUC backing\". Whilst in prison, he was interviewed by Labour MP Ken Livingstone; an edited transcript of their meeting appears in his book Livingstone's Labour."

After teaching in Saint Petersburg university, he left the Soviet Russia in 1921 to settle in Estonia, where he advised the government in monetary issues. He also gained the Estonian citizenship, but moved to Paris in 1925. He taught at the Institute of Political Studies in Paris and in the International Law Academy in The Hague before moving to London in 1929 to work as an expert for Equitable Life Insurance. Work for this company led him to New York, where he definitely established in 1930. After obtaining the USA nationality, he was invited to teach at Northwestern University and New York University until 1943, working as a free-lance law expert for the Justice Department until 1947. Sack is best known for his formalization of the odious debt doctrine in his work Les effets des transformations des Etats sur leurs dettes publiques et autres obligations financières (Effects of the transformations of the states in their public debts and other financial obligations), published in Paris in 1927, when he taught law at the Institute of Political Studies. Alexander Sack synthetised the concept of odious debt based on precedents from the 19th century, such as the Mexican government rejection to pay debts acquired by the emperor Maximilian I, and the rejection by the USA, once annexed Cuba, to pay the debts acquired when it was a Spanish colony."

She married John Leslie, who was the 7th Earl of Rothes and 1st Duke of Rothes, and had two daughters: \n* Margaret Leslie, 8th Countess of Rothes (d. 20 August 1700), married Charles Hamilton, 5th Earl of Haddington (c. 1650 - 1685), and had issue. \n* Lady Christian Leslie, married firstly James Graham, 3rd Marquess of Montrose (1657–1684), and had issue, and secondly Sir John Bruce (before 1671 - 19 March 1710). Anne was a devout Presbyterian, and was well known in her day to have had allegiances with the Covenanters. She would regularly attend field preaching meetings, known as coventicles, and on many occasions would invite Covenanters to Leslie House in Leslie as her guests. Her husband, however, believed strongly in restoring the episcopacy. Serving faithfully under Charles II's government, he was naturally opposed to the Covenanters, but for the sake of his wife he generally tolerated them. If he would see any of them at Leslie House, he would remark to Anne, \"My lady, I would advise you to keep your chickens in about, else I may pick up some of them.\" On one occasion, a warrant moved Rothes to conduct a search for any preachers hiding on his estate, and he remarked to his wife, \"My hawks will be out tonight, my lady, so you had better take care of your blackbirds!\" As a warning, Anne would signal the Covenanters hiding on their estate by placing a white sheet on one of the trees on a hill just behind Leslie House, which could be seen at quite a distance. The Covenanters would also seek the duchess to exert her influence over her husband and the Privy Council, interceding on their behalf in order to lessen the severity of the punishments that would have been carried out by the officials of the day (one of the most notable repressers being Archbishop Sharp, who was a distant kinsman of the duke of Rothes and on occasion was a guest at Leslie House)."

  "text" : "Andrew Koob (born 1976) is an American neuroscientist and writer. Koob is the author of The Root of Thought, which explores the theory that the astrocyte, a type of glial cell in the brain, is 'responsible for our creative and imaginative existence as human beings.' Originally thought to do nothing in the brain, glial cells are now believed to be the new frontier in neuroscience research and play a significant role in brain processing. Earlier concepts, such as Robert Galambos's theory about glial cell involvement in synaptic functioning, were controversial. When published in 1961, this theory resulted in Galambos's departure from the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research. However, since the discovery of gliotransmitters, the idea of active glial cell involvement in brain function is considered valid, and Koob discusses what may have led to the repression of glial research throughout most of the 19th and 20th centuries. Recent evidence has indicated that astrocytes may act as the brain's 'supervisors' and guide neuronal function during learning and memory, as well as regulate other processes originally believed to be strictly the domain of neurons. Koob is from Cascade, Iowa."

He became an assessor in Trondhjem in 1907, and served as district stipendiary magistrate in Søndre Gudbrandsdalen from 1915 to 1919, then Supreme Court Justice from 1919 to 1929. He was also elected to Kristiania city council in 1898. In the 1909 parliamentary election he stood for his party in the constituency Strinden, and was pitted against Liberal candidate P. A. O. Fjermstad, and finished second with 1,052 against 1,096 votes. There was a second round of voting, in which the Conservative candidate, Even Larsen Loreng, edged out the other two with Hazeland in third. In 1912 he won the first round against both Fjermstad and Loreng, but Fjermstad prevailed in the second round. In 1915 he stood in the constituency Lillehammer, Hamar, Gjøvik og Kongsvinger, but Axel Thallaug carried the constituency already in the first round. He died in November 1945. He was buried at Vår Frelsers gravlund."

  "text" : "Amanda R. Block (February 20, 1912 – November 8, 2011) was an American artist. Born in Louisville, Kentucky, Block studied art in Cincinnati, Ohio, and exhibited sculpture at her first national show at the Chicago Art Institute in 1941. Her graduation from John Herron School of Art in 1960, at age 48, marked a return to creative work. Her superb color sense has always been Amanda's trademark. Bright, sensual, engaging, full of movement, her work draws the viewer into its orbit, forcing questions upon us. Her female subjects, no matter how abstract their portrayal, always seem to be real people; and we, the viewer, feel forced to question: who are they, and why do they speak so clearly to us.Amanda Block's Head 2 The figural work of Block, her most accessible, falls between the traditional and the avant-garde, between simple and subtle, between passion and control. Although she became well known for her large abstract landscapes in acrylic and her decorative, colorful lithographs from the middle and late 1970s; ultimately, it is through the figural work that one may truly understand this complex artist. A lover of beauty, it is the female form that most stimulated Block's sensibilities. Her women are strength itself, often veering toward fierce, frank and open, but always sensual."

From 1936 onwards, Freeth exhibited regularly at the Royal Academy, the Royal Watercolour Society and elsewhere. During World War Two, Freeth served in the Middle East as an official war artist to the Royal Air Force. The War Artists' Advisory Committee commissioned two lithographs from Freeth. During the War, he also worked on the Recording Britain project. Freeth was one of the first artists to make the people of the Black Country the main subject of his work, as other artists placed greater emphasis on representing the industrial landscape. Freeth won the prestigious Prix de Rome in engraving in 1936 and 1937, for his series of Black Country images. After the war, the National Coal Board commissioned Freeth to produce works about mine-workers due to the success of his representation of the people of the Black Country. Freeth was elected to the Royal Academy in 1965 and taught at St Martin's School of Art and the Central School of Art in London. Freeth's work is held in a number of public collections, including Birmingham Museums Trust, National Football Museum, Royal Academy of Arts and a number of university collections. Freeth was a friend of fellow artist Raymond Teague Cowern who was also born in Birmingham."

His early years were involved in decorative work, but in 1762, he tied with Filippo Castelli for a first prize in architecture award from the Accademia Parmense di Belle Arti. His winning submission was for a model of a rustic casino on a hillside. He was then rewarded a position for the next decade designing the alterations to the interior of the church of the Steccata. He also helped, with Ghidetti, in the decorations of the nave of the church of San Antonio Abate. He also helped design the decoration (1777) of the chapel of the Beato Giovanni Buralli (1777) in the Piacenza Cathedral. Later he worked on the Parmesan Benedictine Convent of San Giovanni, the church of San Sepolcro, and the facade of the church of San Giuseppe (completed 1782). He died in his home city of Parma, aged 48."

  "text" : "Steinnes was born in Klepp, District of Stavanger (now Rogaland), Norway on 11 October 1892. He was the son of a farmer, teacher and cantor. He earned his Ph.D. in 1928 with a dissertation on the tax system in the Middle Ages. From 1933 to 1960 he was the National Archivist of Norway. From 1961 he was a statsstipendiat (government scholar). Steinnes was one of the pioneers of the agrarian tradition in the research of Norwegian history research. His major contributions were primarily detailed studies of taxation, property and settlement in earlier times. Insights from them were used to shed light on major historical issues such as the reasons why Norway ceased to be an independent state in the Late Middle Ages, the impact of the Black Death and the growth of royal power. The method of Steinnes was a thorough and exact (quantitative) analysis of place names, land books, legal documents, financial statements and cadastres, etc. His systemic efforts to map the actual dimensions of units of size, weight and money in the Middle Ages became the model for all the subsequent analyses of the economic history of the ancient times. For his work, Steinnes was made the Commander of the Order of the Dannebrog in Denmark in 1948 and the Knight of the Order of St. Olav in 1961 in Norway. Steinnes died in Oslo, Norway, on 6 July 1973."

He is best known for his time as a play-by-play announcer for Philadelphia Phillies baseball from 1976 to 2001. Born in Lemoyne, Pennsylvania, he grew up in nearby Harrisburg. He earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in communications from Syracuse University in 1959. He was part of a team, with Richie Ashburn and Harry Kalas, which broadcast Phillies games on both radio and television for 21 consecutive seasons from 1976 to 1997. He retired after the 2001 season. Musser worked for WCAU radio and television in Philadelphia from 1965 to 1971. During this time, he served as the radio play-by-play announcer for the Eagles football as well as 76ers and Villanova Wildcats basketball. One of the youngest lead broadcasters in the National Football League at the time, he covered the Eagles games with Charlie Gauer for four years until the station lost the broadcast rights to WIP in 1969. Musser also called various events for CBS Radio, including Super Bowl VI and Super Bowl VIII. Musser was the lead voice for Chicago Bulls telecasts on WSNS from 1973 through 1976, pairing with Dick Gonski in the first two seasons and Lorn Brown in the third. Musser would call New York Knicks games with Cal Ramsey on WOR-TV (away) and Manhattan Cable Television (home) for the next four seasons from 1976 to 1980. He handled all the matches in the first three years, but only the home ones in the fourth. Musser was married for 50 years to Eun Joo. They had two children, Allan and Luanne, and four grandchildren. Musser died on January 22, 2012. The Broadcast Pioneers of Philadelphia  inducted Musser into their Hall of Fame in 2011."

  "text" : "Arthur Albert Ellefson (born 17 April 1932 in Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan) is a Canadian jazz saxophonist. Having played trumpet and euphonium as a boy, he began playing tenor saxophone at 16, beginning his career in Toronto with Bobby Gimby and others, before going to London in 1952. He played soprano, alto, tenor, and baritone saxophones and clarinet in many British dance bands. They include the Vic Lewis Orchestra from 1953–57, the Ronnie Ross-Allan Ganley Jazzmakers, touring North America with them in 1959, and, from 1960-65 he was with the John Dankworth Orchestra. He also played in touring bands led in England by Woody Herman and Maynard Ferguson. Ellefson moved in 1969 to Bermuda, and returned to Canada in 1974, where he played tenor saxophone with Nimmons 'N' Nine Plus Six until 1977, appearing occasionally thereafter with his own groups in Toronto. He moved to Courtenay, British Columbia in 1988, taught at Malaspina College in Nanaimo and formed a quartet, called Modus, that included his son Lee, a guitarist. Jack Batten (Toronto Globe and Mail, 29 Sep 1976) wrote of Ellefson's style, ‘his sound seems a direct extension of the old masters... Coleman Hawkins and Ben Webster and Lucky Thompson, and so is his sing-song lyricism, but the drive and naked passion of his playing comes from later, more beboppy tenor men’."

Euler was born at Oelde in Westphalia and was educated at Oelde and at public schools in Cologne and Aachen and from 1885 started a career in engineering. He worked for Seidel & Neumann, originally a sewing machine company,which later made cycles and motor cars. Euler took up cycle racing and then motor racing and became interested in aviation. In 1908 he started a company to build Voisin aircraft under licence. In February of 1908 August Euler erected a building on the site of the Griesheim Airport, which he relocated from Mainz castle, costing him 2,400 Marks. In that building he began aircraft production. In 1910 he set a German flying duration record by staying airborne for 3hr 6min. 18sec  On 31 December 1909 he obtained German Pilot's brevet No. 1 and started a flying school. Before the First World War he moved his factory to Frankfurt and helped set up a German aircraft manufacturers association. After the war he was appointed Secretary of State for Air with an instructions to create a ministry for transportation, but with the restrictions of the Versailles Treaty they had little to do, and when the treaty was ratified in 1920 Euler resigned. Euler built a house in the Black Forest on the Feldberg mountain where he lived in retirement until his death in 1957. Although his services were requested by the Nazi government during the Second World War he resisted due to his age and remained retired. He was associated with many of the country's motoring and aviation associations and received many honorary distinctions for his early work."

  "text" : "Allan Kerr Taylor (1832–1890) was a notable New Zealand landowner and businessman. He was born in Negapatam, India in 1832. His second wife was Sophia Taylor (née Davis). His father was General Taylor and his brothers Charles John Taylor and W J Taylor. Allan Kerr Taylor had three half brothers who lived in Auckland near the Tamaki River: Charles John Taylor at Glen Orchard (now St Heliers), William Innes Taylor at Glen Innes, and Richard James Taylor at Glen Dowie. The names of their properties later became the names of the suburbs. It is possibly to differentiate themselves from the main part of the family that the Mt Albert Talyors adopted Allan's middle name as part of their surname - becoming the Kerr Taylors or Kerr-Taylors. This may well have simply grown out of the social conventions of the period."

She became very rich as a courtesan in Paris, and retired in 1881. She briefly worked as a journalist, under the pseudonym of Mitaine de Soie, and published two novels without much attention: Mademoiselle Pomme (1886) and La Famille Carmettes (1888). She is best known for marrying in secret the French writer Octave Mirbeau, in May 1887, in London. After his death, she published the fictitious Testament politique d’Octave Mirbeau, which was in fact written by former anti-militarist and pacifist Gustave Hervé. Sacha Guitry dramatized this \"betrayal\" in his 1923 comedy, Un sujet de roman, inspired by Alice and his old friend Octave Mirbeau, whom he admired very much."

  "text" : "Archer Butler Hulbert, FRGS (26 Jan 1873 – 24 Dec 1933), historical geographer, writer, and professor of American history, son of Rev. Calvin Butler Hulbert and Mary Elizabeth Woodward, was born in Bennington, Vermont. His father later became President of Middlebury College. Hulbert was married twice. On 10 September 1901 he married Mary Elizabeth Stacy, who died in 1920. On 16 Jun 1923 he married Dorothy Printup. He had two daughters by each wife. Hulbert graduated from Marietta College, Marietta, Ohio, in 1895. Hulbert also received an honorary MA in 1904 and was awarded an LHD in 1930. He received a Litt.D. from Middlebury in 1929. He was Vice-Principal of the Putnam Military Academy, Zanesville, Ohio, until 1897. Hulbert then did newspaper work in Korea in 1897 and '98: he was editor of the Korean Independent (Seoul) and edited Far East American newspapers. His brother, Homer Hulbert, had gone there in 1886. He was Professor of American History at Marietta College 1904-18. After Marietta College, Hulbert became a lecturer in American History at Clark University from 1918 to 1919. He also was a lecturer at the University of Chicago in 1904 and 1923; and he served as archivist for the Harvard Commission on Western History (1912–16). Hulbert's last position was at Colorado College, from 1920 until his death. After his death, his wife, Dorothy Printup Hulbert, continued his work. Hulbert's interest in trails dated from fishing trips taken during his college, when he noticed Indian trails. This interest led at first to his 16 volumes of Historic Highways of America (1902–05). The 1929 Bibliography of Archer Butler Hulbert lists 102 volumes. His work Forty Niners (1931) won a $5,000 prize from The Atlantic Monthly magazine."

For three years, he served as a professor in the New York \"Institution for the Deaf and Dumb.\" Stone studied theology at Union Theological Seminary and became a Congregational clergyman. He resided in Middletown, Connecticut and then moved to Boston to become pastor of Park Street Church in January 1849. In 1856-57 Stone invited evangelist, Charles Finney to preach at Park Street. After Finney preached, Stone proclaimed publicly that he had experienced a spiritual rebirth due to Finney's preaching, causing a stir around Boston and setting off a city-wide revival. Stone received an honorary S.T.D. from Amherst College in 1861. During the Civil War, Stone served as a chaplain for the 45th Regiment of the Massachusetts Volunteers. He remained as pastor of Park Street until the spring of 1866. He then moved to San Francisco, California where he served as pastor of San Francisco's First Congregational Church for twenty-five years until his death in 1892.

  "text" : "Arnold Voigt (1864 - 1952) is a stringed instrument maker and luthier of the 19th to 20th century. He was born in Markneukirchen, and worked there from 1890 till his death. During that time, he made copies of Stradivari and other types of Cremonese violins. He was a student of Heberlein. He was the first of the Voigt family to settle in England (from 1885 and 1890) and some of his stringed instruments, especially his violins, were made there. He also made some fine bows for violin, cello, and viola, which can reach prices of up to £3000.The tonal quality of these instruments can be rather hard, but with almost no limit to volume. The family of Voigt is largely associated with the London based firm of that name, but it is true that the Voigt family never really gave up its German roots. This was trully a large family - the French authority René Vannes lists no less than 43 violin makers of that name.Arnold Voigt (1864 - 1952), who was a student of Heberlein, in fact spent merely 5 years in London - from 1885 to 1890. For the rest, he lived and worked in his birth city - Markneukirchen, where he also died. He was prolific in his output as violinmaker, but Henly also calls him 'an expert bow maker. Faithful representations of celebrated models worked with an artistic eye.' Arnold Voigt bows please from every perspective - it demonstrates beautiful workmanship on good material. The heads are a statement in elegance - more French than German. They bears Arnold Voigt's stamp on the shaft in the usual place, and also has the intertwined 'AV' logo embossed into the left flank of the frog, making this certainly his authentic work. In England the firm of Voigt was the great competitor for the firm of W. E. Hill & Sons - in many respects their output was very much on a par, and situates this bow well in quality."

Cushing is a Republican State Senator from Maine's 10th (formerly 33rd before 2013 redistricting plan) Senate District, representing Carmel,Corinna, Corinth, Dixmont, Etna, Exeter, Hudson, Glenburn, Hampden, Kenduskeag, Levant, Newburgh, Newport, Plymouth, and Stetson Maine and his residence in Hampden. He was first elected to the House of Representatives in 2008, reelected in 2010, then the Maine Senate in 2012 and reelected in 2014. He has also served on the Hampden Town Council, (2007-2012) and,was deputy mayor of the town (2010-2012). After the Republicans took over the Maine House of Representatives in 2010, Cushing was named the Assistant Majority Leader for the 125th Maine Legislature (2010–2012). He was chosen to serve as Assistant Majority Leader of the Maine Senate for the 127th Legislature. In 2010, he was named chair of the Elections Committee and House Chair of the Select Committee on Joint Rules.In 2012 he was appointed to the Joint Standing Committee on Labor, Commerce, Research and Economic Development as the Senate lead.In the 127th Legislature he was reappointed. He also was appointed to the decentennial Commission on Apportionment to work on redistricting of house, senate and county commissioner districts. Cushing serves on the senate Rules Committee and the Senate Elections Committee, which oversaw the contested election in Senate District 25. He offered legislation in 2011 which led to three study commissions, two of which he co-chaired: The Blue Ribbon Panel on Affordable Housing and the Study Committee on regulatory takings, which reviewed the relationship between government laws and rules and their impact on property owners. A report was issued which resulted in a new bill to protect the value of property from diminution as the result of new state enacted laws. After a contentious debate with the environmental lobby, it passed the House but died in the Maine Senate. He also sponsored LD 1571, a comprehensive reform of Maine's Workers Compensation system which led to a directive from the Joint Committee on Labor, Commerce, Research & Economic Development (LCRED) to have the executive director empanel a working group to study and report back suggested changes based upon their discussions of the points proposed by the bill. This report was due by mid-February 2012. AS a result of this work by the 13 members of the panel a new bill was crafted and Rep. Cushing asked to have it replace LD 1571. This legislation was passed and made changes which help see workers comp rates reduced and service for injured workers adjusted to better serve their needs.In 2013 he introduced legislation to allow for the collaborative practice between doctors and pharmacists to better manage patient care, he also sponsored a resolve to allow for a citizen vote on a constitutional amendment to allow for the public election of three constitutional officers (Attorney General, Secretary of State and State Treasurer), he resubmitted this legislation in the 127th. He also was the lead sponsor (in the 126th Legislature) on a bill to extend a trial program which allowed for the exemption from tax on aircraft parts which spurred a number of developments in aviation services in Maine. In December 2011, Cushing announced his candidacy for the Maine Senate District 33, which includes 17 communities in So. Penobscot County. He is seeking to replace fellow Republican Debra Plowman, who is unable to seek re-election due to term-limits. As the Assistant Republican Leader in the Maine Senate, Cushing introduced a tax proposal that increased taxes on all annual incomes under 57,000 while cutting taxes on all annual incomes over 89,000."

  "text" : "Agnes Louisa Weston (née Steuart, 17 January 1879 – 8 August 1972) from Wellington was appointed a member of the New Zealand Legislative Council on 22 June 1950. Weston was the wife of Claude Weston, who was effectively the first president of the National Party (1936–1940). In the 1946 election, Claude Weston was a candidate for the National Party in the Wellington Central electorate. He died suddenly on 10 November 1946 in Wellington, and she replaced him as a candidate. The election was won by Charles Henry Chapman of the Labour Party. She was one of three female members of the suicide squad, which was appointed by the First National Government in 1950 to vote for its abolition. The other women appointed in 1950 were Cora Louisa Burrell and Ethel Marion Gould. Only two other women, Mary Anderson and Mary Dreaver, had ever been appointed to the Council (in 1946)."

  "text" : "Alexei Augustovich Davidov (Russian: Алексей Августович Давидов) (1867-1940) was a Russian cellist and composer, and also a banker, industrialist, and businessman. Davidov was born in Moscow on August 23, 1867, the son of mathematician and educator August Davidov originally from Courland. His uncle Karl Davidov was a cellist and composer, and head of the Saint Petersburg Conservatory. In 1891 Davidov was graduated from the Faculty of Mathematics and Physics of the University of Saint Petersburg and also from the Saint Petersburg Conservatory with a concentration in cello and composition. Davidov was a founder and member (from 1894) of the Saint Petersburg Music Society (Russian: Петербургского общества музыкальных собраний), and in 1896 and 1897 its chairman. He participated in the staging of the operas The Maid of Pskov and Boris Godunov. Davidov served in the Special Office for Credit in the Ministry of Finance and from the late 1890s was a member of the board of trustees of the Saint Petersburg International Bank. He was head of the Commercial Bank of Saint Petersburg from 1909 to 1917, and was a member or chairman of boards of many companies with which the bank was involved, engaged in gold mining, coal mining, machinery manufacturing, and other industries. He was a board member of the Electric Lighting Company (formed in 1886) and that company's Electric Power Division, which built power plants in Baku. As head of the Commercial Bank, and working jointly with the Russo-Asiatic Bank, Davidov participated in the creation of various monopolies. Davidov was a member of the board of the Saint Petersburg Stock Exchange and, from 1913, a state councilor (a civilian rank equivalent to the military rank of brigadier general). After the Russian Revolutions of 1917, Davidov fled to exile in Germany. He became a Freemason on February 24, 1922, and died in Berlin on March 6, 1940. Davidov was married twice, first (in 1895) to the Georgian noblewoman Tamara Eristova. His second wife was the Mariinsky Theatre ballerina Eugenie Platonovna Eduardova. He had three children, Yuri (born 1897), Cyrus (born 1900), and Tatiana (born 1902)."

In an early interview with The Globe and Mail, she told the newspaper that she was only a recent convert to underground music, having previously been primarily a fan of country music. She left Brave New Waves in 1985 and moved on to other roles with the CBC, including stints as host of Cross Country Checkup, Two New Hours, Arts National and Home Run, the network's local afternoon program in Montreal.

  "text" : "Andrew Nelson Caudell (18 August 1872 – 1 March 1936) was an entomologist who specialized in the study of grasshoppers and other insects in the order Orthoptera, becoming a prolific author of taxonomic studies, a member and President (in 1915) of the Entomological Society of Washington, and a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. Caudell was born August 18, 1872, in Indianapolis, Indiana, a son of Andrew Jackson and Mary Jane (née Bannon) Caudell. Raised in Oklahoma, he completed his Bachelor of Science degree at Oklahoma Territorial Agricultural and Mechanical College in Stillwater, Oklahoma, now Oklahoma State University, and undertook postgraduate study at Massachusetts Agricultural College, now the University of Massachusetts Amherst. After a brief employment with the Gypsy Moth Project in Massachusetts, he joined the Division of Insects of the United States Department of Agriculture in 1898 and remained with the Department until his death. In addition to his USDA duties, he served as custodian of the Orthoptera collection of the Division of Insects of the United States National Museum, now the National Museum of Natural History in Washington, D.C. He married on April 12, 1900 to Penelope Cundiff in a unique ceremony performed over telegraph lines with the bride in Mulhall, Oklahoma and the groom in Kansas City, Kansas with the minister and two witnesses, possibly the first such ceremony ever performed. Caudell died on March 1, 1936 at Washington, D.C. Among other honors, he is memorialized by two pyralid moth taxa published in a single paper by fellow entomologist and co-worker Harrison Gray Dyar, Jr., the species Megasis caudellella (Dyar, 1904) and the genus Caudellia (Dyar, 1904) and the tettigoniid grasshopper Conocephalus caudellianus (Davis, 1905), \"Caudell's Conehead.\""

  "text" : "Anne Macnaghten, CBE (9 August 1908 – 31 December 2000) was a British classical violinist and pedagogue. Anne was the youngest daughter of high court judge Sir Malcolm Macnaghten and grew up in Northern Ireland and Kensington, London. She began her violin studies at the age of six with Hungarian soloist Jelly d'Arányi. Macnaghten later stated in an interview with The Strad that d'Arányi \"wasn't really a very good teacher\". At the age of seventeen she travelled to Germany to study at Leipzig Conservatory (now University of Music and Theatre Leipzig) with German pedagogue Walther Davisson, who later became the director of the conservatory. In 1931 she co-founded the Macnaghten Concerts together with composer Elisabeth Lutyens and conductor Iris Lemare, which aimed to promote contemporary classical composers. The concert series was based at the Mercury Theatre, Notting Hill Gate and originally ran from 1931-1937. In the same year Macnaghten founded the (then all-female) Macnaghten String Quartet, which played in many of the series' concerts. The quartet premièred works of several well-known composers as part of the concert series, including Sinfonietta, Op. 1 by Benjamin Britten in 1933, Tippet's String Quartet No. 1 in 1935 and works by Gerald Finzi, Elizabeth Maconchy and Alan Rawsthorne. The Macnaghten String Quartet are still an active quartet and regularly coach chamber music at Benslow Music Trust. In 1952, with the help of composer Ralph Vaughan Williams (a strong supporter of the original concert series) and funding from the Arts Council of Great Britain (now Arts Council England), Macnaghten was able to revive the concert series, which was renamed the New Macnaghten Concerts and ran for over forty years, the last concert given in 1994. The New Macnaghten Concerts saw the première of works by British composers such as Harrison Birtwhistle and Richard Rodney Bennett. The recital series saw performances by some of the most internationally renowned musicians of the era, including John Williams, Cecil Aronowitz, Peter Pears, Steve Reich, Michael Nyman, Derek Simpson, Thea King and many others. From the late 1970s onwards, she taught violin in Hertfordshire, stopping only as a result of a fall aged ninety. Macnaghten received a Gold Medal from the Worshipful Company of Musicians in 1962, and in 1987 was awarded the CBE in recognition of her work."

  "text" : "Amina Kamara (born 31 January 1987 in London, United Kingdom) was the first winner of the title Miss West Africa in 2008, where she represented Sierra Leone at the inaugural Miss West Africa pageant in London. Amina Kamara was born in London, England in 1987 to Sierra Leonean parents, Abass Alieu Kamara and Kadi KamaraShe grew up in North West London and attended school at Harlesden Primary School before moving on to Queens Park Community School in 1997. As tough as life in Harlesden was for ethnic minorities, Amina Kamara always looked up to her both her parents and especially her brother Alieu Kamara who was 10years older. Alieu Kamara usually took the responsibility of looking after and advising Amina and her 2 sisters. She socialised well with her peers and took pride in the people of her neighbourhood, and still today she regularly visits. She attended QPCS up to year 9 and then her parents decided to move to East London. Amina then attended a school in Chingford called Rush Croft School and finished her GCSEs there. Separated from her West African origins, her one great wish was to travel around the world and experience different cultures and meet all sorts of people, including being a strong part of the growth of her home country Sierra Leone. She then moved on to Waltham Forest College where she began to study Tourism for 3year and achieved an Advanced Vocational Certificate in Tourism. Highly influenced by her brother Alieu, Amina Kamara lived her young days as a tom boy, climbing over fences to play football and basketball with the guys, never knowing she would eventually one day become a beauty pageant winner of an African region where she would then explore her lifelong intent to travel the world. She then attended the University of Kent to study a BA Hons in Tourism Management, where she learnt the importance of Tourism planning and development and managing tourism in countries. Amina’s time at Kent was tough due to social differences amongst her peers. At this stage, feeling distant from her peers, Amina had to drop her tom boy lifestyle and began wearing dresses and make up. Although Amina’s dream towards touring the world was coming closer and closer, she still faced much difficulties with her social life. Just as things began to pick up, she received a phone call from Alieu her brother, to inform her that he had travelled to America and he had been diagnosed due to a brain tumour. Fear for his life made it difficult for Amina to keep focused at Uni, but he returned to London reassuring Amina not to worry about his conditions as everything would be ok. When he returned to America, Amina was soon to find out from her mum that he had died from an aggressive brain tumour. It took Amina roughly 3–4 months before she could get back to her studies motivated by his strong words and influences. Sooner in life, Amina then also picked up an interest in modelling and engaged in various modelling activities before coming across an invite by Nana Tamakloe to participate in the first ever Miss West Africa beauty pageant."

McKay reached New Zealend in 1863 where he spent a number of years prospected for gold. A meeting with Julius von Haast saw a change of direction in which McKay, largely self-taught, undertook geological mapping and fossil collecting expeditions throughout the islands. In 1872 James Hector appointed him to the Geological Survey of New Zealand. McKay's greatest achievement was to free New Zealand sciences from the strictures of European-based thinking, developing new theories, of worldwide importance, on block faulting in the evolution of mountain systems. The discipline of neotectonics is largely based upon McKay's observations and theories."

He settled in Virginia and graduated again from the Gettysburg seminary and was ordained as a minister in Woodstock, Virginia. He married Anne Steenbergen née Caperton, and took over the administration of the plantation of her late husband located at Locusts Grove in Shenandoah County, Virginia. There he built a church on the hill which was later to take his name, Rude's Hill. During the American Civil War he lost everything as the plantation came to be used as the headquarters for General Stonewall Jackson in 1862. He lost his wife and daughter as the Confederate and Union forces struggled over the Shenandoah Valley from 1862 to 1864. Another Dane, Ole R. Olsen recounted that fighting in the Union Army he participated in the looting of the Rude home. He noted Danish items in the house and cursed at the house's elderly owner in Danish. He saw that Rude understood his curses, but he received no response to taunts from his compratriot who wisely remained silent. Rude's son William Steenbergen Rude volunteered for the Confederate Army. Having lost everything in the Civil War, Rude relocated to Texas where he became a minister and professor. He died there in 1883."

Her fight for life was documented on her parent's blog with an unexpected sense of humor, compassion and religious identity while in the hospital.Ayelet was the daughter of Seth Galena and Hindy Poupko, an Orthodox Jewish couple, and lived on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. Ayelet was born at NYU's Langone Medical Center two months prematurely weighing just 2 lbs 7 ounces. She spent six weeks in the neonatal intensive care unit, feeding and growing, before being released. When she was a year old, Galena was diagnosed with dyskeratosis congenita of the HH variant. She presented with IUGR, colitis, immune deficiency, cerebellar hypoplasia, microcephaly and very short telomeres. The Galena family partnered with Gift of Life Marrow Registry to set up many drives in the hopes of finding Ayelet a perfect bone marrow donor match. She underwent a Bone Marrow Transplant on August 31, 2011 with an unrelated 7/8 donor. Ayelet's family set up a Tumblr blog when they transported her from Sloan Kettering Hospital to Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, where they would do the transplant, to keep their family and friends updated on her progress. Through Facebook and other social media, the family's story gained support across the Jewish world and beyond. Ayelet is the granddaughter of Rabbi Reuben Poupko of Montreal, QC and Arna Poupko Fisher of Cincinnati, Ohio and Rita Lourie-Galena of New York City and the late Dr. Harold Galena, for whom she was named. (Ayelet means deer in Hebrew.) On January 31, 2012, Ayelet died on Day 150 post transplant due to lung complications and lived for 788 days. She is buried in Baron Hirsch Cemetery in Staten Island, New York."

  "text" : "Abdul Samay Hamed is an Afghan journalist and cartoonist. The Village Voice described him in 2003 as \"one of Afghanistan's sharpest political satirists\". Hamed was trained as a physician, but he views his primary work as the promotion of freedom of expression. In 1985, he began his first underground newspaper, Salam, in Mazar-i-Sharif. He went on to found nine more, including the women's magazine Sadaf. In 2003, Hamed said that he had started more than 90% of Afghanistan's \"free\" publications. He has criticized the power of local warlords on the BBC's Dari service, to which he is a frequent contributor. In 1997, he had a confrontation on the street with Mohammed Mohaqiq, then the Interior Minister of Afghanistan, for his outspokenness. Hamed alleges that Mohaqiq and eight bodyguards proceeded to assault him, the bodyguards striking him with rifle butts and bayonets. Alarmed by the lawlessness of Afghanistan and the rise of the Taliban, he fled the country the following year and received political asylum in Denmark. He returned to Afghanistan in 2002 after the US invasion drove the Taliban from power. He then co-founded the press freedom organization \"Association for the Defense of Afghan Writers' Rights\", as well as a new magazine, Telaya, focused on social and political problems. When regional authorities attempted to ban Telaya in Baghlan Province, Hamed responded by appealing to the national Information Ministry, who overruled the regional authorities and allowed him to continue publishing. Hamed also began to contribute to the satirical newspaper, Kalak-e-Rhaastgoy—an \"ironic parody of news events\" that he compares to the US satirical paper The Onion—as well as drawing cartoons and writing satirical songs. In April 2003, an unknown man approached Hamed on the street, called his name, and handed him a piece of paper; as Hamed was reading it, the man slashed him in the chest with a knife. Hamed was cut several more times, but eventually succeeded in disarming his attacker. However, the assailant began to call for a friend to help, at which point Hamed released him and fled to a hospital. His attacker was never caught. Since the attack, Hamed has rarely gone out in public unless accompanied by one of his six brothers. In November 2003, he was awarded the International Press Freedom Award of the Committee to Protect Journalists, \"an annual recognition of courageous journalism\"."

  "text" : "Alice Henriette Lapize (3 March 1889 – 10 February 1979), better known by her stage name, Alice Delysia, was a French actress and singer who made her career in English musical theatre. After performing in the chorus at the Moulin Rouge and other theatres in Paris from the age of 14, she became a chorus girl in Edwardian musical comedies, briefly on Broadway in 1905, then in London for several years and back in Paris in 1912. She got her big break in 1913, when she was offered a leading role in a revue presented by the impresario C B Cochran. The show was a hit and established Delysia as a star. During World War I, she starred in a string of West End revues and an operetta, all of which consolidated her success. In the star vehicle Afgar, from 1919 to 1921, first in London, then New York and on tour in the U.S., Delysia's fame was at its height, and her lively performance was celebrated by the critics. Returning to London in 1922, Delysia fell ill and was forced to withdraw temporarily from the stage. From 1924, she was again starring in revues, including the successful 1925 London show On With the Dance, which helped to establish Noël Coward's fame. Another highlight, in 1926, was Princess Charming. In the later 1920s and the 1930s she played in a range of musical theatre and, increasingly, in non-musical comic plays in London, earning further critical accolades. During the Second World War she abandoned the West End and devoted herself to entertaining British and allied troops, marrying a naval officer in the Free French Forces. After the war, she retired completely, accompanying her diplomat husband on various overseas postings. She returned to England in her last years."

Brooks finished her studies in architecture at the University of Waterloo, Ontario, in 1988. She moved to the UK and worked with designer Ron Arad. In 1991 she became a partner in Ron Arad Associates. In 1996 she founded her own practice, Alison Brooks Architects, based in London. Brooks' architecture has been described as \"a late flowering of the most elegant and sensuous modernism\". She is particularly known for designing intelligent and beautiful houses but has also moved into the cultural sector, for example designing the Performing Arts Centre at Folkestone. In 1999 Brooks was placed third in the UK's 'Young Architect of the Year' competition. In 2000 she was winner of the 'European Hotel Design and Development Awards - Best Interior Design of a New Hotel / Best Guestroom Design'. In 2008 Alison Brooks Architects were the joint winners of the RIBA Stirling Prize for their part in the design of Accordia, a high density development of 378 dwellings. In March 2013 Brooks received the AJ Woman Architect of the Year Award. One of the judges, Paul Monaghan, said \"Her mixture of sculpture, architecture and detail is what has made her such a powerful force in British architecture.\" In 2016, she designed Smile, a temporary cantilevered wooden structure on the grounds of the Chelsea School of Art, demonstrating the structural feasibility of cross-laminated timber."

He purchased and hand-built a SOL-20 personal computer from Processor Technology, and a Cromemco Z-2 as test platforms. On arriving in the U.S.A. in 1979, Johnson-Laird wrote the software drivers to permit the CP/M Operating System to run on an Onyx computer—this was the first commercial CP/M microcomputer with a hard disk and a data cartridge tape drive. Johnson-Laird is one of the early pioneers in the field of digital forensics. His specialty, developed in 1987, is forensic software analysis of computer and Internet-based evidence for copyright, patent, and trade-secret litigation. He is also an expert on software reverse engineering, software development, and developing software in a clean-room environment. Johnson-Laird developed techniques for computerized source code analysis and the presentation of computer-based evidence that have helped to bring digital forensics into the courtroom. He has served as a Special Master to Federal District Court judges, and has served as an expert witness and provided litigation testimony in many intellectual property cases in the United States and Singapore. He also has published numerous articles on topics related to digital forensics and the legal challenges posed by emerging technologies."

  "text" : "Amy Merania Harper was a New Zealand photographer. Harper was the first photographer in Auckland who used fluorescent lighting. Harper began her career in photography when she was eighteen years old at the studio of H.J Schmidt in Queen St, Auckland. She worked as a retoucher and finisher. In 1922, her family purchased the Glenmore Studio in Eden Terrace where Harper became chief photographer. In 1928 the family practice expanded further with the purchase of Belwood Studios in Queen St which was later renamed to the Amy Harper Studios. In 1944 she purchased yet another studio on Karanghape road which she named Belwood Studios. She became widely known for her formal portraits which captured major life events for her customers. However, she was most well respected for her wedding photography which became a thriving business for her. In 1945, Harper helped to establish the New Zealand Professional Photographers Association and was subsequently made a life member in 1975. Harper retired in 1979. Harper's collection of work has been exhibited at the Auckland War Memorial Museum in an exhibition titled 'Reflections; New Zealand Women's Lives Presented Through the Collections of Auckland Museum' in 1993. It was also displayed for the public in 1992 at the Auckland City Art Gallery in 'the 1950s show'."

He was born in Dunedin, New Zealand, where he lived and died, though he represented clients nationwide. Hanlon represented at least 16 people charged with murder, but he is best known for his first defence case, in which he represented the only woman to be hanged in New Zealand, Minnie Dean. Dean was the only murder defendant of Hanlon's to be hanged. Hanlon's career was the subject of a 1985 New Zealand television drama series, called Hanlon. The series was a critical and a commercial success, and was nominated for Best Overseas Program at the 1986 Emmy Awards. Its first episode, In Defence of Minnie Dean, \"contributed to a re-evaluation of Dean's conviction\", and won the Best Director, Best Drama Programme, Drama Script, and Performance, Female, in a Dramatic Role categories at the 1986 Listener Television Awards (also called the GOFTA Awards). David Gwillim, who played Hanlon, won Best Performance, Male, in a Dramatic Role at the awards for his performance in the series, and Terry Gray's music won Best Original Music."

Her father William Halcomb was his father's brother. He married Edith Swainson on 3 December 1863 at St James' Church, Hutt. She was the daughter of William John Swainson and his second wife, Anne Grasby. He represented the Rangitikei electorate on the Wellington Provincial Council from May 1865 to March 1872. Between May 1865 and July 1871, he was a member of four Executive Councils, where he held the roles of provincial secretary and treasurer. He lived in Feilding from the 1870s, and the nearby township of Halcombe is named for him. The settlement of Stanley near Halcombe is named for his wife; her middle name was Stanley. The Halcombes later moved to Urenui in Taranaki, where he died on 3 March 1900. His wife survived him by three years."

  "text" : "Andrew Wight (14 November 1959 – 4 February 2012) was an Australian screenwriter and producer best known for his 2011 film Sanctum. He produced over 45 films including television documentaries, live television specials and 3D IMAX films. His credits include Ghosts of the Abyss, Aliens of the Deep and Expedition: Bismarck. Andrew Wight has been honored with the Australian Geographic Society Spirit of Adventure Awards in 1989. On 4 February 2012, he was killed in a helicopter crash at Jaspers Brush near the town of Berry in New South Wales, Australia. The crash also claimed the life of American filmmaker Mike deGruy. Andrew grew up on the family farm \"Tarqua\" near Harrow in Western Victoria, and attended Hamilton College as a boarder between 1972 and 1977. It was here that he developed a taste for caving, exploring the nearby Byaduk Caves network of lava caves, under the direction of his Chemistry teacher, accompanied by a few other close school friends. In 1988, he eventually went on to attempt a record cave dive in Pannikin Plains Cave on the Nullarbor Plain, where flash floods turned the expedition into a life-or-death adventure. This was captured on film by his support team, and eventually published as Nullarbor Dreaming. This short film launched his career as an international film-maker and culminated in him becoming James Cameron's right-hand man on many 3D and other film projects. Sanctum was inspired by his Nullarbor experience."

  "text" : "Alexandre Mikhailovich Besredka (29 March 1870 – 28 February 1940) was a French biologist and immunologist born in Odessa. In 1910 he became a citizen of France. He studied biology in Odessa (1888–92), afterwards moving to Paris, where he was an assistant to Ilya Ilyich Metchnikov (1845–1916) at the Pasteur Institute. He obtained his medical degree in 1897 with the thesis Abscès sous-phréniques. In 1903 with Amédée Borrel (1867–1936), Félix Mesnil (1868–1938), Gabriel Bertrand (1867–1962), Camille Delezenne (1868–1932) and Auguste-Charles Marie (1864–1935), he co-founded the Bulletin de l'Institut Pasteur. From 1905 to 1914 he was in charge of the laboratory at the Pasteur Institute. In 1910 he attained the title of professor, and for several years worked with Metchnikoff conducting experiments of typhoid fever on chimpanzees. During World War I he served as a medical officer at Verdun and Bar-le-Duc. From 1919 he focused on studies of immunity involving intestinal infections. Besredka specialised in research of immunology, cellular self-defense mechanisms and phagocytosis. During his career at the Pasteur Institute, he made contributions in his work involving antiviral therapy, as well as in the development of vaccines against various infectious diseases. He is best known for his research of anaphylaxis. His name is associated with \"Besredka's method\", a type of vaccination he proposed for avoiding anaphylactic shock in the usage of serotherapy (sometimes referred to as \"Besredka's desensitization\")."

During the Libyan Civil War he quit his job to join the uprising in his hometown of Zintan. He is seen as an influential commander from the Zintan brigade. On 2 October, he announced the creation of an armed group, the Tripoli Revolutionists Council, to keep order in Tripoli. Analysts said such a mission would overlap with the existing Tripoli Military Council (TMC) which is led by Abdelhakim Belhadj. Naker told his forces had 22,000 armed men at its disposal and were in control of 75 percent of the capital. He stated his TRC was working under the auspices of Mustafa Abdel Jalil and was “cooperating” with the TMC. On 18 November, few days before Abdurrahim El-Keib presented his government, Naker warned in an interview that his men could overthrow the government even before it was appointed if it failed to meet their demands for representation. On 1 January 2012 he announced to launch a political party."

His atlases were popular, and many went through multiple editions. Despite a prolific cartographic career, not a lot is known of Vuillemin's life. He studied under the French cartographer Auguste Dufour (1798 - 1865), and his atlases and maps are held by and available through many collections including the British Museum and the University of Alabama Historical Maps of Europe Archive. Vuillemin's most important works include his detailed, highly decorative large format Atlas Illustré de Géographie Commerciale et Industrielle as well as his many French Atlases."

He founded the winemaker that is now Pernod Ricard NZ Corban arrived in New Zealand in 1892. In 1902 he purchased for £320 a 10-acre (40,000 m2) block of land in Henderson, Auckland, although at the time this was quite some distance from what was known as Auckland. He named the block of land Mt Lebanon Vineyards. The first vintage was in 1908, coinciding with the local electorate voting in prohibition, meaning he was unable to sell wine from the property. Assid's son Wadier took over wine-making in 1916. By the 1920s the Corban family were the largest winemakers in New Zealand."

Savill, who had a passion for the Boston Red Sox in his youth, was an owner of the Indianapolis Capitals of the now-defunct Continental Football League from 1963 to 1969. He was also an owner of the Columbus Owls of the International Hockey League from 1973-1978, and an owner of the NHL's Pittsburgh Penguins from 1975-1979.

He was a bookseller and publisher (as Wright and Carman); his Lambton Quay bookshop was a landmark for thirty years. He was on several local bodies: the Wellington Hospital Board, the Tawa Borough Council and the Hutt Valley Power and Gas Board. He published sports books as Arthur Carman (The New Zealand Rugby Almanack, The New Zealand Cricket Almanack; both annuals) and local history books as A. H. Carman or Arthur H. Carman. These included The Birth of a City: Wellington 1840-1843 and Tawa Flat and the Old Porirua Road, which went into three editions (1956, 1970, 1982) He was noted as a Christian pacifist, who spent some months in Mt Crawford prison in Wellington, NZ in 1941, for 'subversion' when he attempted to publicly espouse the Christian pacifist view. His viewpoint had changed from traditional Methodism toward Quakerism following a 1925 visit to the World War I battlefields (he had been touring the United Kingdom as the sole press correspondent travelling with the 'Invincibles' All Black rugby team), although he remained a Methodist local preacher for the whole of his life."

She earned a Bachelor of Arts in 1910 and secured Senior Scholarship in economics, leading to a Master of Arts with honors in political science in 1911. After leaving Canterbury College (now University of Canterbury) she taught at several schools including Chilton Saint James School in Lower Hutt. Candy was appointed to lecture history at the College in December 1920, making her the second woman academic at the institution, after biologist Elizabeth Herriott. She worked closely with James Hight, including writing the 1927 A short history of the Canterbury College (University of New Zealand) with a register of graduates and associates of the college; it was to be her only major publication; with her background in school teaching, she specialized in teaching rather than research. At the time between a quarter and a third of students were women, and Candy played an active role in caring for them, being warden of Helen Connon Hall, an all-women hall of residence. By the time of her retirement in 1948 she had risen to senior lecturer. After her retirement she served on the University Council. Candy never married. She died on 18 May 1977 in Christchurch.Candy lives on in the name of a building on campus and in a W. A. Sutton portrait in the collection of the university. The Christchurch Art Gallery holds some preparatory sketches for the portrait."

For almost a decade she was a lead soloist with amongst others the Rotterdam Dance Group and Amanda Miller's Pretty Ugly Dance Company. In 1996 Anouk van Dijk dedicated herself exclusively to the creation and performance of her own work. She has been running her own dance company since 1998. Van Dijk gained an international breakthrough in 1999 with her work ‘Nothing Hurts’, a collaboration with Falk Richter. ‘Nothing Hurts’. was selected for the Berliner Theatertreffen and toured Europe afterwards. During the Dutch Dance Days in 2000, Van Dijk was awarded the Lucas Hoving Prize for her production ‘Microman’. She developed during her career her own movement system, called the Countertechnique. The Countertechnique discards the dominant opinion in the dance world that all movement relates to one center in the body. Instead, in the Countertechnique dancers always keep their alignment and balance by continually giving counterdirections to each movement. Van Dijk has been appointed artistic director of Chunky Move, succeeding Gideon Obarzanek, who founded the company in 1995. In 2006, she was named one of \"25 to Watch\" by Dance Magazine."

In 1911 he began work as a veterinarian at the Pasteur Institute in Algiers, afterwards being promoted to chef de laboratoire (1913). From 1919 to 1931 he was laboratory chief (tuberculosis services) at the Pasteur Institute in Paris, where he later served as head of tuberculosis services from 1931 to 1947. At the Pasteur Institute in Algiers he participated in development of the \"anticlaveleux-vaccine\", a vaccine used for rapid vaccination of millions of sheep in North Africa and Europe. In Algiers with Léopold Nègre (1879-1961), he conducted research on epizootic lymphangitis, a disease affecting horses and mules caused by Cryptococcus farciminosus. In Paris he performed studies on Mycobacterium tuberculosis, pseudo-tuberculosis of rodents, the bubonic plague in humans, ulcerative lymphangitis, paratuberculosis in cattle and anthrax. With Léopold Nègre he developed antigène méthylique (antigen-methyl) for treatment of tuberculosis. He became a member of the Société de biologie in 1919, a chevalier of the Légion d'honneur in 1923 (officer- 1939), general secretary of the Annales de l'Institut Pasteur in 1928 and a member of the Académie de Médecine (veterinary division) in 1947."

In 1837 she came to Port Underwood in Marlborough, New Zealand, with her family. She married William Boyce when she was 16 or less, and they lived in the Nelson area, and later Motueka. She had 13 children. Boyce had close contact with Māori people from the time she came to New Zealand. In Motueka, she was known as a herbalist especially knowledgeable about the medicinal use of plants, and provided medical assistance to Māori. She died at Motueka on 28 February 1914 aged 87, having outlived her husband by nearly 19 years. She was written about in a two-page story by her granddaughter Flora Park Cave Spurdle called 'Tales my grandmother told me'. Ann's parents were Samuel Cave and Susannah Noon, both sent to New South Wales from England as convicts. Susannah was only a young girl when she was transported in 1811. A factual account of her life and those of the other women on the convict ship Friends, The Girl Who Stole Stockings, was published in October 2015."

  "text" : "Isabel Annie Aves (née Michaelsen) (18 March 1887–15 October 1938) was a New Zealand abortionist. She was born in Waipawa, Hawke's Bay, New Zealand on 18 March 1887. Aves ran an abortion business from her home in Napier using sea-tangle tents (probably Laminaria digitata seaweed stalks or a local substitute) which, when inserted into the cervical canal, absorbed water and slowly expanded, dilating the cervix. Her first trial was in Napier on a charge of \"unlawfully using an instrument with intent to procure a miscarriage\", but the jury could not agree on a verdict. Two further trials were held in Wellington, with the juries again failing to agree on a verdict, amid much publicity. An unusual fourth trial followed, which also resulted in no conviction. Aves was represented by Cyril Harker at the trials in Napier in August 1936, Wellington in October 1936, December 1936 and February 1937. Harker's defense rested on lack of direct evidence; none of the women gave evidence and the crown prosecutor relied on circumstantial evidence. In 1938 Aves was shot by Colin Herbert Hercock, the fiancé of a woman she had performed an abortion on, after he was led to believe that his fiancée was going to die as a result of the abortion. Aves died later in hospital; the fiancée survived to give evidence at Hercock's trial. Harker defended Hercock, getting him off on the lesser charge of manslaughter rather than murder and subsequently getting his prison term reduced. In the 1940 by election Harker was elected as a Member of Parliament for the National Party in the Waipawa electorate."

In 2001, Clark was fired by Major League Baseball after downgrading his first class airline tickets to economy class, thus either pocketing funds by selling extra tickets or to gain additional airline tickets for unapproved personal travel. In 2004, he was sentenced to four months in jail and four months on house arrest after a memorabilia scheme resulted in a federal mail fraud conviction. He now is a member at Ford's Colony Country Club in Williamsburg, VA, and currently lives in that development."

His is most famous for his massive efforts as a Slackliner. \"Sketchy Andy\" has successfully completed a long list of accomplishments as a highliner and trickliner, but also is a highly distinguished BASE jumper and rock climber. He has created many aspects of the sport of Slackline, created new \"slack\" vocabulary, new Slackline disciplines (spacelines, spacenets, etc.), and is likely the worlds leading ambassador to the sport.  He is most highly noted for his slackline creativity and style along with being credited for his many innovations in the world of tricklining. Originally from Marin, California, he graduated valedictorian of his class of 2008 from Humboldt State University. He learned to slackline in 2004, and since 2008 has been winning or placing on the podium at the biggest slackline competitions in the world, helping to establish modern day competitive tricklining. His tricklining accomplishments include OverALL World Championship titles of 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, and a world cup win in 2012. He also holds multiple world records within the sport including, a slackline surfing record with Guinness, the Longest Highline (2010 100+m)), highest highline walked (2014) as well as the more prestigious record of Longest Highline walked without a form of safety protection (2011); otherwise referred to in the sport as \"Free Solo.\" Lewis created a title for the mindset referred to as FreeSoLoco; writing about it in his music online @ Soundcloud.com/Slacklife and better recordings at slacklife.bandcamp.com. He also is a key figure in a strange fringe activity called \"netting,\" developing what he deemed a \"space net\" that is gaining international acclaim."

  "text" : "Abigail Fallis (born 1968) is a British sculptor, known for her commentary about over-consumption and consumerism. Fallis trained at Camberwell College of Art, London, in silversmithing and metalwork. She initially wanted to be a blacksmith, but realised she \"wasn't strong enough to bend the metal\". Instead she chose to work with lighter, softer materials. Fallis's works first brought to public attention include a pair of framed hand stitched Union Jack underpants, entitled Cock-Eyed Jack, a comment on the Cool Britannia phenomenon. These were featured on the BBC documentary \"New Brit\". In 2009 a public sculpture by Fallis was installed in Central Square, Newcastle, entitled DNA DL90. A monumental 9 meter high double-helix of shopping trolleys, commenting on contemporary consumer culture. The sculpture opening was attended by James Watson, best known as one of the discoverers of the structure of DNA in 1953 with Francis Crick and Rosalind Franklin. Fallis took part in the \"Women Make Sculpture\" exhibition in 2011, at the Pangolin Gallery, London. She had previously been the gallery's first sculptor-in-residence, for a year from October 2008. Fallis is much concerned with environmental matters such as overfishing, as shown in her recent exhibition \"Fallis in Wonderland\". Tom Hodgkinson, editor of The Idler, wrote that Fallis in Wonderland was : “an exhibition of sculptures that are startling in their collision of qualities: for here is wit, beauty and protest; here is life and passion; here is playfulness and fun; here also is awe and wonder; and here is a commentary on an unsustainable way of living…Abigail Fallis’ work takes the fun, the wit and the radical political edge of Dada and combines it with beauty and gentleness and the result is a triumph.” Fallis is also a participant in the \"Ghosts of Gone Birds\" project, which will raise money and awareness for BirdLife International's Preventing Extinctions programme. Fallis's work is part of many public and private collections including Parabola Land Ltd and The Damien Hirst \"Murderme\" Collection. Fallis uses various materials in her sculptures including bronze, paper and felt. Regarding her work Fallis has said \" I'm a maker, I use my sculpture as a thinking tool. I'm naturally inquisitive and quite sceptical about the way information is relayed to consumers by the media. it is this that fires my imagination and inspires me to make.″ Radio 2 Arts Show with Claudia Winkleman, interview with Penny Smith for Women Make Sculpture\""

In Egmond aan den Hoef he renovated the chapel at the ancestral castle, surrounded the castle with a moat, and had a canal dug to connect it with Alkmaar. In 1396, he participated in the military campaign in West Friesland. In 1398, he was enfeoffed with the Lordships of Ameland and De Bilt. He was commander of the Dutch troops that were tasked with stabilizing Frisia.

  "text" : "Ailsa McKay (7 June 1963 – 5 March 2014) was a Scottish economist, government policy adviser, a leading feminist economist and Professor of Economics at Glasgow Caledonian University. She was noted for her research on gender inequalities and the economics of the welfare state, for her contributions to feminist economics, as a leading proponent of the basic income concept and as one of the UK's foremost experts on gender budgeting. She served as Vice Dean of the Glasgow School for Business and Society, and was also well known for her support of Scottish independence and as a key adviser to the Scottish government and First Minister Alex Salmond on economic and welfare state policies. Ailsa McKay is highlighted as a leading intellectual figure in the campaign for independence in Alex Salmond's 2015 book The Dream Shall Never Die. Both Salmond and his successor Nicola Sturgeon have highlighted McKay's influence on Scottish gender equality policies. She was a member of the board of directors of the left-wing Jimmy Reid Foundation think tank, and was an adviser to the United Nations. With Margunn Bjørnholt, she co-edited the book Counting on Marilyn Waring: New Advances in Feminist Economics, which was published days before her death. The Ailsa McKay Fellowship, the Ailsa McKay Lecture, and the McKay House at Lenzie Academy are named in her honour."

El Khalifi thought he was working with al-Qaeda operatives, but was actually in contact with undercover FBI agents. He is believed to have no actual ties to al-Qaeda. All arms and support was provided by the FBI, and authorities say the public was never in danger. On June 22, 2012, El Khalifi pleaded guilty in federal court in the Eastern District of Virginia of trying to carry out a suicide bomb attack on the U.S. Capitol Building in February 2012 as part of what he intended to be a terrorist operation and was sentenced to 30 years in prison the following September."

  "text" : "Andy Archer (born Anthony Andrew Dawson) is a British radio presenter, best known for his work on pirate radio stations in the 1960s and 1970s. He later worked for Independent Local Radio and BBC Local Radio. He was born in Terrington St Clement in Norfolk, on 22 January 1946. He had a brief stint as a presenter on the pirate station Radio City in 1965, but had already signed-up to join the Royal Air Force, and left the station after just one week. He bought himself out of the RAF after two years, and in 1967 joined Radio Caroline, remaining as a presenter until the station shut down the following year. He presented on Radio North Sea International in 1970 and 1971, and then returned to Radio Caroline when it resumed broadcasting in 1972. In 1975 he moved to on-shore broadcasting when he joined Radio Orwell, broadcasting from Ipswich in Suffolk, where he was the drive time presenter. He was an extremely popular presenter in the local area during his time at Orwell. During this time he also worked as a continuity announcer for Tyne Tees Television and Television South West. He subsequently worked for several commercial stations, including DevonAir, Centre Radio, County Sound and Ireland's Radio Nova and Radio ERI. At Nova, he was the programme director. In the 1980s he also returned to working for Radio Caroline and later Radio Orwell for periods, before in 1990 becoming programme controller at Invicta Supergold. In 1996, Archer made the move to working for the BBC, presenting programmes for BBC Radio Suffolk. The following year he moved to its sister station BBC Radio Norfolk, where he presented shows such as The Morning Mix and later, from 2002, Drive Live. In 2003 he returned to commercial radio, presenting a mid-morning programme for North Norfolk Radio. Archer is credited with having pioneered the use of the word \"anorak\" as a lexical description for an obsessive fan, using the term for fans of offshore radio in the early 1970s, who chartered boats to come out to sea to visit the radio ships."

Adalbert was the son of Elector Ernest of Saxony and his wife Elisabeth of Bavaria-Munich. In order to protect the Thuringian areas of the Archdiocese of Mainz around Erfurt and in the Eichsfeld area, archbishop Diether von Isenburg and the cathedral chapter of Mainz appointed Aldalbert, who was still a minor, in 1477 as Provisor of the city of Erfurt and High Bailiff of Rusteberg Castle in Rustenfelde in the Eichsfeld. In 1479, Adalbert was made a member of the cathedral chapter in Mainz. In 1480, he was elected coadjutor with the right to succeed as archbishop. This election result was confirmed by Pope Sixtus IV in 1481, despite the Pope's reservations. After Dieter died, Adalbert succeeded him as ruler of the Archbishopric of Mainz on 8 May 1482. Since he was too young to be ordained as bishop, he became administrator. In 1483, he demanded that the city of Erfurt recognize the suzerainty of Mainz over the city. The archbishop's residence, Martinsburg Castle in Mainz, was completed during Adalbert's reign. Adalbart died in 1484, before he could be ordained as bishop, so he was never archbishop. He is therefore depicted without mitre and pallium. Adalbert was unmarried. However, he had an illegitimate daughter named Sybilla."

  "text" : "Abul-Qasim Babur Mirza bin Baysonqor Beg (Chagatai/Persian: ابوالقاسم بابور میرزا بن بایسنقر بیگ‎‎), was a Timurid ruler in Khurasan (1449–1457). He was the son of Ghiyath-ud-din Baysonqor ibn Shahrukh Mirza, and thus a great-grandson of Amir Timur. Babur was one of the many people involved in the succession struggle that took place during Shah Rukh's last years. Together with Khalil Sultan (a great-great-grandson of Timur), he plundered the baggage-train of the army and then made his way to Khurasan. Meanwhile, Ulugh Beg also invaded Khurasan in 1448 in an attempt to defeat Ala-ud-Daulah Mirza bin Baysonghor (علاء الدولہ میرزا بن بایسنغر), who held Herat. Ulugh Beg defeated Ala-ud-Daulah Mirza bin Baysonghor at Tarnab and took Mashhad, while his son Abdal-Latif Mirza conquered Herat. Ala-ud-Daulah Mirza bin Baysonghor fled to south-western Afghanistan. However, Ulugh Beg felt Transoxiana, where he had already ruled for decades, to be more important, and soon left the area. On the way back, Babur sent a force that inflicted heavy losses on his army. With a power vacuum now in Khurasan, Babur quickly seized control. Mashad and Herat fell to him in 1449. Ala-ud-Daulah Mirza bin Baysonghor occasionally raided the area but was not a significant factor. Together with Ulugh Beg and Sultan Muhammad bin Baysonghor (سلطان محمد ابن بایسنغر  ) (who gained control of central Persia), Babur became one of the three important Timurid rulers. This balance of power was soon upset by Sultan Muhammad bin Baysonghor, who invaded Khurasan. The campaign started out badly for Babur, with a defeat at Mashad in March 1450 convinced him to cede parts of his territory. However, Babur soon recovered and took Sultan Muhammad prisoner, and then executed him. He then marched to Shiraz to take control of Sultan Muhammad's lands. At this point Jahan Shah of the Black Sheep Turkmen ended his loyalty to the Timurids. He quickly put Qum and Sava to siege. Babur began to march against him but was forced to return to Herat, due to the overwhelming superiority of the Black Sheep's armies and a plot hatched against him by 'Ala' al-Daula. Most of Persia was taken from the Timurids by 1452, with the exception of Abarquh, which was conquered by the Black Sheep in 1453. While Kirman was temporarily conquered some time later and a few attempts were made to seize Ray, Persia as a whole was never retaken by the Timurids. In 1454 Babur invaded Transoxiana, then under the control of Abu Sa'id Mirza in retaliation for the latter's seizure of Balkh. He quickly laid siege to Samarkand. The conflict between the two soon ended, however, with the Oxus River agreed to as the border. This remained in effect until Babur's death in 1457. He was succeeded by his son Mahmud."

  "text" : "Ambrogio Contarini (1429 – 1499) was a Venetian nobleman, merchant and diplomat known for an account of his travel to Iran. Ambrogio Contarini was a member of the patrician family of Contarini and spent his youth in the Ottoman capital of Constantinople as a merchant. He left the city after the Ottoman–Venetian war began in 1463. In 1470, he was aboard the Aegeus, fighting the Ottomans at sea. The Republic of Venice sought to forge a larger alliance against the Ottoman Empire and sent Contarini with a diplomatic mission to Uzun Hassan, the Iranian ruler of the Aq Qoyunlu clan. He left Venice in February 1474, traveled through central Europe, Kiev, and Georgia and reached Tabriz in August 1474. In October, he met Uzun Hassan at his capital of Isfahan. He was kindly received, but the Venetian proposal of alliance was declined. Contarini returned to Venice only in April 1477, after many delays and a difficult return voyage. On his journey home from Iran, Contarini stopped in Moscow, where he had an audience with the Russian tsar Ivan III. On the day of his arrival in Venice, Contarini orally reported to the Council of the Republic. His report was published in Venice in 1476 by H. Foxius as Questo e el Viazo de misier Ambrogio Contarini. A written account of his mission appeared in print in 1486 in Vicenza. Contarini's itinerary is dominated by his own personal vicissitudes, but contains many valuable information about the regions he visited, especially Iran under Uzun Hassan's rule."

  "text" : "Angelo Ravagli (1891–1976) was an officer in the Italian Bersaglieri who is notable for the part he played in the life of D. H. Lawrence. In 1926, shortly after Lawrence and his wife, Frieda von Richthofen, went to stay in Spotorno in Italy in late 1925, von Richthofen started an affair with Ravagli that continued intermittently over the four years until Lawrence's death in 1930. Ravagli took English lessons from Lawrence who, when Ravagli helped him fix a smoking chimney, told von Richthofen that \"That is a man who would be useful to have at the Kiowa ranch\". In 1931, Ravagli left his wife and three children and went with von Richthofen to Lawrence's ranch in New Mexico, married her in 1950, and lived there with her until her death in 1956. In 1935, von Richthofen sent Ravagli to Vence, where Lawrence had spent the last weeks of his life in the Ad Astra Sanatorium, to have Lawrence's body exhumed and cremated and his ashes brought back to the ranch. Ravagli claimed that Lawrence once discovered him and Frieda having sex. One of Lawrence's biographers says that Lawrence responded by having an affair with Dorothy Brett. Another of his biographers, John Worthen, believed that Frieda's affair with Ravagli inspired Lawrence to write Lady Chatterley's Lover, which Lawrence started to write in Italy in October 1926. Worthen based this on letters Frieda wrote to her mother in the 1920s."

He worked as a General Practitioner in North London, then directed the University of Sussex Health service, and later worked as a Consultant Psychotherapist in St. Thomas' Hospital, London, from 1983 to 1992. While in general practice he realised that a lot of his patients were presenting with psychological problems or distress, which he confirmed by epidemiological studies. He developed interest in psychotherapy and later developed a time limited therapy which can be offered in the National Health Service. This type of therapy is known as cognitive analytic therapy.In the 1960s he moved to Kingston, on the outskirts of Lewes, East Sussex with his wife and four children. Ryle died aged 89 on 29 September 2016."
