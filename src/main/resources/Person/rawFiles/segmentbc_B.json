Edwards worked on the construction and design of instantaneous shutters and originated the method of intensifying plates with mercuric iodide. He was the first, in 1887, to make orthochromatic plates in Britain. Edwards lived at Wistowe House in Hayes, Middlesex, which also housed the small factory where for a time he manufactured a special type of printing paper marketed as \"Wisto\". Edwards died just before the First World War in 1914. A photograph of Edwards may be found in the 1926 edition of the British Journal Photographic Almanac. B. J. Edwards became a limited company in 1900. In the 1906 edition of the British Journal Photographic Almanac, their advertisement states that Edwards himself once more had sole control of the company. The company was acquired by Leto Photo materials Co. (1905) Ltd. in 1909. The Ealing works remained and Edwards became a brand name."

His job as a milk carter meant he didn't feature at all in the 1933 VFL season, as his employers didn't want him playing football. He was, however, a regular fixture in the side from 1935, until his retirement in 1944. Williams was Hawthorn's second leading goal-kicker in 1940, with 23 goals, just two behind Albert Naismith. He finished second in the goal-kicking again in the 1943 season, which he had spent as captain. Only a one-point loss in the final round of the home and away season prevented him from having the distinction of captaining the first ever Hawthorn team to compete in finals football."

  "text" : "Dular Bombogor (Chinese: 博木博果尔 or 杜拉尔·博穆博果尔, pinyin: Bomboguoer) (Yaksa, ? - Mukden, 1640) was an Evenk chief, leader of the Evenk federation. His power base laid on the basin of the Amur river In 1638, the Qing Emperor Hung Taiji sent general Samshika against Bombogor but his campaign failed to subdue Evenk resistance. In December 1639, Hung Taiji sent another large force to the Amur. This force penetrated deep into Solon territory, reaching the Kumara River. The Battle of Gualar was fought between 2 Manchu regiments and a detachment of 500 Solons and Daurs led by Bombogor. In May of 1640, the Manchus assaulted the Evenk fortresses of Duochen, Asajin, Yakesa, and Duojin; capturing all four of them and large numbers of horses, cattle, pelts and slaves. Although Bombogor continued his resistance he was losing support, the Evenks were no match for the powerful Manchu armies and many Solons switched their allegiance to the Manchu Khan. In August 1640 Hung Taiji sent general Xiteku against Bombogor. The latter fled to Mongolia, but Xiteku caught up with him in the vicinity of Qiluotai, capturing his baggage train, wives and children. Bombogor was captured and taken to Mukden where he was executed. With Bombogor's death Evenk resistance collapsed and the Manchu secured control of the Amur peoples. The Evenks and other local peoples were absorbed into the Eight Banners."

  "text" : "Wikler grew up in Madison, Wisconsin, where he cofounded The Yellow Press, an entirely student-run newspaper. While a student, he won election to the student senate and launched Students United in Defense of Schools with Peter Koechley to demand increased school funding and succeeded in allowing students to elect a representative to the Madison School Board. He also organized protests against granting Coca-Cola exclusive access to Madison schools. During high school he also worked for Wisconsin gubernatorial candidate Ed Garvey and on the first congressional campaign of now-Senator Tammy Baldwin. In 1999, he began attending Harvard University, where he studied economics. While a student, he cofounded the Student Global AIDS Campaign (SGAC) and the Harvard AIDS Coalition. He represented the SGAC at the United Nations General Assembly Special Session on AIDS in New York, the UN World Youth Forum in Senegal, and the International AIDS Conference in Barcelona. He also worked for economist Jeffrey Sachs and interned for Sen. Russ Feingold. He also served as editor-in-chief of the Harvard Review of Philosophy and contributed to The Onion. While at Harvard, he joined TeamFranken, a group of students who assisted Al Franken in writing his #1 bestseller, Lies and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them: A Fair and Balanced Look at the Right. Wikler took a term off to help Franken \"through every step of the process\" of writing the book. \"When I was staying with the Frankens [to finish the book], we'd get up around 10 or 11 and then work for fourteen or fifteen hours,\" he told an interviewer. \"We'd stop only for meals and a little break before dinner. It was exhausting, but it was also exhilarating, because he's so funny. We were constantly cracking up.\""

  "text" : "Benjamin Franklin Graves (1771–1813) was a politician and military leader in early 19th-century Kentucky. During the War of 1812, Graves served as a Major in the 2nd Battalion, 5th Kentucky Volunteer regiment. Together with other officers, he commanded relatively inexperienced Kentucky troops in the Battle of Frenchtown (also known as the Battle of the River Raisin) in Michigan Territory. This battle had the highest number of American fatalities in the war: of 1000 American troops, nearly 400 were killed in the conflict on January 22 and 547 were taken prisoner. The next day an estimated 30-100 Americans were killed by Native Americans after having surrendered. Graves was among Americans known to be taken by the Potawatomi on a forced march to Detroit, Michigan. He is believed to have died on the way, as he disappeared from the historic record. Because so many men of the Kentucky elite were lost in this battle, it has been commemorated in the state. Graves is included among the officers memorialized on Kentucky's Military Monument to All Wars in the state capital of Frankfort. In 2009, the Michigan area was commemorated as the River Raisin National Battlefield Park, the only such park to mark a War of 1812 site, although others are noted as national or state historic sites."

He settled on two career goals: carrying out experiment-based field research to investigate the dynamics of rocky intertidal communities, focusing on species interactions and environmental context and how this might shape a community, and using the resulting data to test and modify theories on how communities were organized."

  "text" : "Brian Viner (born 25 October 1961,London) is an English journalist and author. Viner was born to an unmarried mother at the now demolished Royal Northern Hospital, London, and was adopted by a couple in Southport, Merseyside when a few weeks old. He met his birth parents for the first time in the 1990s. He was educated at King George V School, Southport, then at St Andrews University. In 1985/6 he was a Robert T Jones Memorial Scholar at Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia. From 1994 to 1999 Viner wrote for the Mail on Sunday. In 1997 he won a What the Papers Say Award for his work as the paper's television critic. He was a columnist on The Independent from January 1999 to December 2011, and then turned freelance, writing for numerous national newspapers, including the Daily Mail, The Mail on Sunday, the Financial Times, The Sunday Telegraph, The Sunday Times, The Independent, The Guardian, the Daily Mirror and the Sunday Express. At The Independent, he was principally a sports writer, and \"The Brian Viner Interview\" with a well-known sporting figure became the longest-running weekly interview in British newspaper journalism. He has been shortlisted multiple times as Interviewer of the Year in the British Press Awards and the Sports Journalism Awards. In October 2013, Viner became film critic of the Daily Mail, succeeding Christopher Tookey. He is the author of seven books, all non-fiction. The latest, \"Looking For The Toffees\", is an account of his teen years following Everton FC, in which he goes in search of his childhood heroes. Prior to that, he wrote The Good, The Dad and The Ugly: The Trials of Fatherhood, published in May 2013. Of his earlier books, Tales of the Country and its sequel The Pheasants' Revolt recount the story of his, and his family's, move from London to Herefordshire. Ali, Pele, Lillee & Me: A Personal Odyssey Through the Sporting Seventies recalls his childhood as a sports enthusiast, and Nice To See It, To See It Nice: The Seventies in Front of the Telly is similarly a memoir, but about television. His book Cream Teas, Traffic Jams and Sunburn: The Great British Holiday was voted Travel Book of the Year in The 2011 British Travel Press Awards. In 2010 Tales of the Country was adapted for the stage by the Pentabus Theatre Company. He is married to the novelist Jane Sanderson; the couple have three children."

  "text" : "Fuller was born in London to compositor John Fuller and Harriett, née Jones. From December 1884 to February 1885 young Ben appeared in a juvenile production of The Pirates of Penzance at the Savoy Theatre; two years later he was a member of Montague Robey's Midget Minstrels and later joined Warwick Gray's Juvenile Opera Company. His father, also involved in the theatre, migrated to Australia in 1889. Ben followed him after touring England briefly and eventually joined his father in Adelaide. He had also learned to play the piano and the double bass by ear. In 1894, having been joined by younger brother John, the Fullers moved to Auckland, where the elder John set up waxworks and lantern shows with Ben as comedian. The family left Ben in charge in Dunedin and returned to Melbourne, but they soon returned after his success. On 6 October 1900 Ben Fuller married Jessie Elizabeth Burton, née McDonald, a widow; she bore him a son in 1902 but died in May 1903. He married again, to Elizabeth Mary Thomson on 8 November 1905. The Fullers continued to tour around New Zealand and extended their circuit to Australia, eventually establishing John Fuller & Sons Ltd; Ben based himself in Sydney. He volunteered for active service in World War I. After the war in 1920 he donated £1000 to Vernon Treatt so that he could take up his Rhodes scholarship and he subsequently established the Fuller Trust for overseas training in agriculture. Knighted in the 1921 Birthday Honours, he contested Sydney in the 1922 state elections as an independent without success, and was a Nationalist candidate in the federal election of that year. In 1923 the Fullers partnered with Hugh J. Ward and focused on musical comedy. The family built the St James Theatre in Sydney, and survived the Depression by installing cinema apparatuses in their theatres. After the brothers divided their assets, Ben Fuller was governing director of Fullers' Theatres Ltd and attempted to establish an English language opera company without success. In partnership with Garnet Carroll from 1939, he jointly established the Carroll-Fuller Theatre Company Pty Ltd in 1946. He was chairman of the Howard Prison Reform League, vice-president of the Sydney Industrial Blind Institution, and president of the Australian Council for International Social Service. He died at St George's Hospital in London in 1952."

  "text" : "William Joseph \"Billy\" Duggan (31 January 1884 – 4 July 1934) was an Australian trade unionist who served as the first president of the Australian Council of Trade Unions. Duggan was born in Melbourne to ironoulder William Duggan and Elizabeth Margaret, née Whitmore. He attended local state schools before working as an estate agent and plumber, eventually joining the navy. In his early years he developed both his penchant for self-education and his boxing skills. He later left the navy to return to plumbing. On 12 March 1910 he married Frances Annie Barratt at St James Old Cathedral. In March 1912, as a member of the Commonwealth Military Cadet Corps, he was commissioned lieutenant, but in 1913 he resigned; despite his early support for military training he would oppose conscription during the 1916–17 referenda. Duggan had joined the United Operative Plumbers and Gasfitters' Society of Victoria (which became the Australian Plumbers and Gasfitters Employees Union in 1912) in 1910. He was state vice-president from August 1911 until his election as first organiser in January 1912. In 1914 he became first secretary of the Building Trades Federation, and in March 1918 he sat on the Shipbuilding Tribunal. He continued to be active in the union movement throughout the 1920s, serving as a Plumbers' Union delegate on the Victorian Trades Hall Council until his election as THC President (1926–27). He chaired the 1927 Third All-Australian Trade Union Congress, which established the Australian Council of Trade Unions of which he was inaugural president, serving until 1934. He was also active in the Australian Labor Party, serving as first metropolitan council president in 1926 and as Victorian president from 1928 to 1929. He served on the federal executive (1929–31, 1932) and ran for preselection for Bendigo in 1928, unsuccessfully contesting Henty in 1929. He served on Coburg Council from 1924 to 1930 and as mayor from 1928 to 1929. Duggan died from a duodenal ulcer in 1934 at Moreland."

Some of his pieces have been used in theatres and concert halls in towns throughout Denmark. Petersen is recognized for his simple style which is suitable for industrial production. One of his finest pieces is a small, light stool (1959), in rosewood and cane, with beautifully shaped legs."

He replaced the first civilian Commissioner William J. S. Elliott who is currently working with INTERPOL. Paulson was born in Lachute, Quebec. He joined the Canadian Forces after high school  and served in the ranks for six years. Leaving the Forces in 1984, he spent two years at Simon Fraser University and then joined the RCMP as a cadet in 1986. Paulson's first posting was to Chilliwack Detachment. He spent the next 19 years in various RCMP postings in British Columbia before being transferred to National Headquarters in Ottawa. Commissioner Paulson has shown resistance to commenting on proposed changes to the way police deal with marijuana offences. He was quoted as saying \"I'm a simple country cop you know. I'm in the business of policing and others are in the business of policy and law.  However, the following year he opined \"The people that use drugs are not the people we got to be bothering, right? We’ve got to be sort of helping them.\""

His father may have been Friedrich, a count in the Sülichgau area (roughly corresponding to today's Tübingen district). His mother may have been Irmentrud, the daughter of Count Burkhard of Nellenburg. In the annals of the monk Berthold of Reichenau from the year 1061, Buchardus de Zolorin and Wezil de Zolorin are mentioned. Based on this source, Burkhard was killed due to a feud. Little is known about the aforementioned persons themselves, or their possible relationship. The next documented member of the dynasty is Friedrich I, Count of Zollern, who was probably a son or a grandson of Burkhard I."

  "text" : "Bill Mitchell (born August 2, 1935) is a former award winning professional Canadian football centre in the Canadian Football League. He also regularly played defensive line and was a kicker. Born in England and coming to Canada at 11 years old, Mitchell graduated from the University of Western Ontario as the Mustangs most valuable player. The Toronto Argonauts stirred up considerable controversy when they selected him in the draft, as they passed over Lionel Conacher Jr., (the son of Canadian sports legend Lionel Conacher) who went to the Montreal Alouettes. However, the Boatmen were immediately rewarded, as Mitchell played both offensive and defensive line (and intercepted 2 passes) and won the Gruen Trophy as best rookie in the Eastern Conference. He also scored 60 points in 1962 as a back up kicker when Cookie Gilchrist was injured. After three season in Toronto, he was traded to the Edmonton Eskimos in a blockbuster 6 player deal that saw the famed Jackie Parker head east. In three seasons in Edmonton, besides being a lineman, he scored 123 points with his boot, including a 58-yard field goal (versus the Calgary Stampeders on August 17, 1964) which was the longest in CFL history at the time. Mitchell was traded to the British Columbia Lions in 1966 and scored his highest points in a season that year with 67. He eventually retired three games into the 1968 season. His brother Doug Mitchell also played in the CFL with the Hamilton Tiger-Cats and the Montreal Alouettes."

  "text" : "Breffny Morgan is an Irish socialite and television personality, known for his appearances on reality shows such as The Apprentice, Celebrity Salon and Celebrity Bainisteoir. He was born in Cork, and moved to America to study and row crew at Harvard University, graduating in 2008 with a degree in biology. He was raised by single mother, Geraldine Morgan, and has been public in his pride at this. He was a candidate in the 2009 series of The Apprentice. This season featured the on-screen romance of Breffny and a fellow cast member. In 2010, he was a contestant on Celebrity Salon on TV3. In 2010, he did Celebrity Bainisteoir on RTÉ One. He is an experienced rower, having won an Irish Rowing Championship in 2002. Morgan was a member of the Irish and British crew that attempted a crossing of the Atlantic Ocean in 2009, aboard the fourteen-man vessel 'La Mondiale'. Teammates here included Leven Brown, and Ian McKeever. Eleven days into this crossing, La Mondiale was rowing three days ahead of world record pace when the rudder was sheared off by a submerged object, possibly a whale. Rudderless, the crew was stranded in a prolonged sea gale, and after a time they were safely rescued by the 24,000 ton bulk carrier 'Island Ranger'. La Mondiale, however, was destroyed in the process. Morgan is a fashion model, signed with Celia Holman Lee. Campaign work has included Remus Uomo and Jacamo. He has modelled for Paddy Power, sometimes partnering Georgia Salpa, who parties with Morgan on the Dublin social scene. Morgan was the recipient of a Best Dressed Newcomer Award from the Kerry Fashion Awards. The Irish Independent and the Irish Examiner both labelled him a sex symbol. However not all media portrayals are as positive, indeed Morgan reported to the Evening Herald that an online search cost Morgan his American girlfriend, claiming that her parents googled him and advised their daughter to end the relationship. A separate Herald article discussed Morgan's tendency to polarise audiences and online commentators and summarised by stating, \"If TV entertainment was edible, then Breffny Morgan is a large jar of marmite\"."

Dawson was a standout junior player with the Windsor AKO Fratmen team, winners of the 1952 national junior championship (the \"Little Grey Cup\") in a 15–12 victory over the Edmonton Wildcats. Several CFL teams were bidding for his services, but he chose the Hamilton Tiger-Cats, with whom he'd have a 7 season career. In his first season he won the Gruen Trophy as best rookie in the east (no stats were kept, and only Canadians qualified for the award) and won the Grey Cup championship. He also won the Grey Cup in 1957. Primarily a defensive back, he made five interceptions in his career, and he could substitute on offense, catching 11 passes in 1956. He could also play quarterback, and in 1956 he got the chance, which was a rarity, as very few Canadians got to play QB during this era. On October 20, 1956 the Cats were suffering a record setting defeat to the Montreal Alouettes, 82–14, when coach Jim Trimble replaced starting QB Tony Curcillo. Dawson came on and completed five of eight passes for one touchdown. Dawson was enshrined in the Windsor/Essex County Sports Hall of Fame in 2001."

  "text" : "Bernard Szumborski (German: {{{1}}}) was a Moravian knight and a mercenary. Szumborski was hired by the Teutonic Knights during the Battle of Chojnice (part of Thirteen Years' War), and was sent with 15,000 men to relieve the besieged city of Chojnice. King Casimir IV of Poland sent cavalry attacks to the rear of the Teutonic lines and Szumborski was captured. However, Teutonic knights rallied up and caused panic. Szumborski managed to escape and organized the pursuit of the fleeing Polish army. On October 24, 1457, together with 2000 mercenaries, Szumborski captured Chełmno (Kulm), and killed its mayor, Michal Segemund, claiming that he was a traitor. His forces captured other towns of Pomerelia and Chełmno Land, and on March 21, 1458, Szumborski with his army approached Toruń (Thorn), burning its suburbs, but failing to capture the heavily fortified city. On September 19, 1460, Szumborski captured the town of Golub-Dobrzyń, but Polish garrison of its castle, commanded by Andrzej Puszkarz, managed to hold it. In August 1466, Szymborski, as envoy of the Teutonic Knights, was sent to Bydgoszcz, to negotiate with King Casimir IV and his envoys, Jan Długosz and Jan Sapienski. The negotiations ended on October 19, 1466, when the Second Peace of Thorn was signed. Szymborski, regarded as a very cruel man, died on January 7, 1470. As Jan Długosz recorded, he was poisoned by a female resident of Chełmno."

  "text" : "Benjamin Bennett (1904–1985) was a well known South African crime writer. He worked as a journalist with the Cape Argus newspaper from 1925 to 1975, as a crime reporter, and subsequently as news editor and finally editor of Argus Action. He was born in Kimberley, South Africa, and was educated at Kimberley Boys' High School. Bennett’s prodigious output of books reflects a close involvement, as crime reporter, both at the crime scene and in the courtroom, where his professional life regularly took him, pen and notebook in hand. It is said that, for his insight, he was even consulted by the police for the solving of certain complex cases.He is credited with having posed the most plausible scenarios for enduring murder mysteries, such as that of Bubbles Schroeder. Bennett’s books include: \n*  Down Africa's Skyways (1932) \n*  Up For Murder (1934) with François Pierre Rousseau \n*  Famous South African Murders (1938) \n*  Hitler Over Africa (1939) \n*  Too Late For Tears (1948) \n*  The Clues Condemn (1949) \n*  The Evil That Men Do (1950) \n*  Murder Is My Business (1951) \n*  Why Did They Do It?

He was a pupil of Cosimo Tura, and was also a medallist. In 1469 he painted the likeness of Borso I, and was ordered to present it in person to the Duke of Milan. From 1471 to 1504 he was a salaried officer at the court of Ferrara, living first in Castel Nuovo, for which he painted a canvas that has perished, and afterwards in Castel Tedaldo, of which he was the governor. In 1483 he painted the portrait of Tito Strozzi, now in the Costabili Gallery at Ferrara. His will, dated 1500, is in the archives of Ferrara, but the exact date of his death is unknown. \n* Portrait of a young man, now in the Museo Correr \n* John Corvinus, 1486, now in the Alte Pinakothek"

  "text" : "Bambang Mustari \"Bob\" Sadino (9 March 1933 – 19 January 2015) was an Indonesian businessman who was the CEO of Kem Chicks, Kem Foods, and Kem Farms. He started his business by selling domestic chicken eggs door to door. At that time, domestic chicken eggs were not popular in Indonesia, thus his goods were purchased only by expatriates, who lived in Kemang (an area in South Jakarta, Indonesia), as well as few people in Indonesia who had lived abroad before. Over time, the domestic chicken eggs began to be popular so that Sadino's business grew significantly. Sadino then expanded his business by selling chicken meat. He released two books containing his unique view of doing business. People admire his unique view which he called \"Stupid Learning\", that we do not need to be smart to start doing business, instead we can use our dullness to start doing business. He illustrates a stupid man will start doing business as soon as an idea pops into his head, while an educated man will spend his time thinking which ideas need to be applied, and then at the end none of his ideas become reality. Sadino also emphasizes that theory without practice is nothing. Furthermore, he also has a unique trademark that he usually wears short-sleeved shirts and shorts on most occasions. Even when he met Suharto, a former Indonesian president, he stuck with his style of dress."

  "text" : "Brown was born and raised in Dresden, in upstate New York. After receiving his Masters in Painting from Syracuse University, he moved to California in 1891 to create the Art Department at Stanford University. Brown headed the department for almost ten years, but was dismissed in a dispute over his use of nude models in the classroom. Although his own art was heavily influenced by the Tonalist aesthetic, his methods of teaching, which contrasted sharply with the traditional approached at the nearby School of Design in San Francisco, stressed the Impressionist credo of a rapid execution of “natural subjects” in the wilderness. Students often visited his studio-home for discussions on various environmental and political causes. In 1898 Brown designed the studio rooms in Stanford’s new Art Building, which included such “radical” innovations as “one continuous belt of glass” eight feet high and muted terra cotta and gray tones on the walls. The walls were covered with reproductions and original works “by the avant-garde artists of Paris.” One of his more successful students, the painter Jennie V. Cannon, published reviews of his exhibitions and several short biographies which described a quiet, serious and, compassionate teacher with steadfast principles. Brown was an accomplished mountain climber and benefited from Stanford’s proximity to the Sierra Nevada range, mostly famously explored by Sierra Club founder John Muir (1838–1914). Brown was the first to record climbing a group of peaks in the Sierras with, in two instances, his intrepid wife Lucy; his most challenging first ascent was of Mount Clarence King (also known as Mount King) in August 1896. According to the Climber’s Guide to the High Sierra, Brown’s ascent of Mount King was the first time advanced aid-climbing techniques were used in North America. Nearby Mount Bolton Brown (13,538 ft) is named after him; Brown also named several peaks in the area of Mount King."

  "text" : "Basil Arthur Helmore OBE (28 February 1897 – 4 November 1973) was an Australian solicitor and businessman. Born at Newcastle to company secretary Ernest Arthur James Helmore and Gertrude, née Allbon, he attended local state schools and in 1913 was first in the state in French and Latin for the Leaving certificate. He became an articled clerk with Sparke & Millard in 1914 but suspended his articles to enlist in the Australian Imperial Force (5 September 1916), in which he became a gunner. After training in England he was sent to the Western Front with the 4th Field Artillery Brigade in August 1917; in October 1918 he began work with the AIF Education Scheme and returned to Sydney in June 1919. Helmore was admitted as a solicitor in November 1920 and became a partner in the firm (now Sparke & Helmore). At Lake Macquarie on 4 November 1922 he married Jessie Wilhelmina Cannington. Helmore also edited four legal textbooks and qualified by correspondence for his Bachelor of Law (1933) and PhD (1955) from the University of London. He was involved in various legal societies as president of the Newcastle Law Society (1957–58) and councillor of the Incorporated Law Institute of New South Wales (1953–60). Helmore contested the Senate unsuccessfully in 1937 as a United Australia Party candidate; he would also make an unsuccessful attempt to enter the New South Wales Legislative Council in 1948. In 1960 he was elected to the council of the University of Newcastle, which he had helped found; he was later deputy chairman (1965–66) and warden of convocation (1967). He was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire in 1971. Helmore died at Newcastle in 1973 and was cremated."

Here he was arrested by the Portuguese, who kept him imprisoned on São Tomé. It is here that he heard of the trading opportunities in Elmina on the Gold Coast. It is unknown how Eriksz escaped from captivity, but around 1593 he was back in the Netherlands, only to make another trading trip to the Gold Coast in the same year, coming back successfully in March 1594. Eriksz remained active in the trade on the Gold Coast, and made 11 trips in total to the area."

  "text" : "Betty Broadbent (November 1, 1909 - March 28, 1983) also known as the “tattoo’d lady” was born on November 1, 1909 in Philadelphia. Broadbent’s interest in tattooing began at the early age of fourteen. It was then Broadbent met Jack Redcloud while working as a nanny in Atlantic City. Jack Redcloud first came in contact with Broadbent on the boardwalk of Philadelphia. He was covered in tattoos, which fascinated Broadbent. This fascination would lead Redcloud to introduce Betty Broadbent to his tattoo artist, Charlie Wagner. In 1927 Wagner, alongside several other tattoo artists, including: Tony Rhineagear, Joe Van Hart and Red Gibbons would tattoo a bodysuit of over 565 tattoos on Broadbent. Charlie Wagner was friends with the circus man Clyde Ingalls. When Ingalls discovered Broadbent’s passion for tattooing, he offered her a position at the circus. In the same year, Broadbent began exhibiting her art with the Ringling Brothers and Barnum and Bailey Circus. While working at the circus, Broadbent also trained as a steer rider who would perform with circus performer Tom Mix. Later in Broadbent’s career, she learned how to ride horses and mules. Broadbent’s tattoos varied in theme. On Broadbent’s back she had a tattoo of the Madonna and child. The art on her lower limbs included a tattoo of Charles Lindbergh on her right leg and a tattoo of Pancho Villa on her left. One of Broadbent’s more famous tattoos took over six sittings, a spread eagle that stretched from one shoulder to the other. On May 3, of 1939 the New York Times would quote Broadbent stating, “It hurt something aweful, but it was worth it.” In the same year, Broadbent began exhibiting her art with the Ringling Brothers and Barnum and Bailey Circus, while also appearing as a steer rider with Tom Mix. While working in a side show in 1939, Broadbent challenged the traditional views of beauty for women during the 1930‘s by participating in a beauty pageant at the 1939 New York World’s Fair. Alongside exhibiting her art, Broadbent tattooed others herself. She worked in shops across the country including spaces located in Montreal, San Francisco and New York. In 1937, Betty Broadbent decided to take her job internationally. She spent time working for independent circuses in both New Zealand and Australia. When she returned home to the United States, she continued performing and traveling in a side show until 1967. It was in 1967 that Broadbent retired. Betty Broadbent is regarded as the most photographed tattooed lady of the 20th century. In 1981, Broadbent was the first person to be inducted into the Tattoo Hall of Fame. Betty Broadbent died in her sleep while living in Florida on March 28, 1983."

  "text" : "William \"Bill\" Freyse (June 12, 1898 – March 1969) was an American cartoonist notable for his three decades of work on Our Boarding House, syndicated by Newspaper Enterprises Association. After Freyse graduated from the Central High School of Detroit, he began as an editorial cartoonist for the Detroit Journal. As a staff artist for the Detroit Times, he did theatrical caricature. His commercial artwork included billboards, theatre advertising and cartoons for Ford Motors. In 1939, he took over Gene Ahern's Our Boarding House from Bela Zaboly and continued to draw it until his death in 1969. Over a 20-year period, Our Boarding House was written by William M. Braucher (1896–1958). Others who worked on the strip included Jim Branagan and Tom McCormick. The Sunday color strip ended on March 29, 1981; the weekday panel continued until December 22, 1984. Freyse was married to Evelyn S. Freyse (1908–2003). Their daughter was actress Lynn Borden, born Lynn Freyse in Detroit on March 24, 1937. The family moved to Cleveland, Ohio, and later to Tucson, Arizona, due to Evelyn Freyse's health needs, which required a warm, dry climate. He described his son, Steve Freyse, as a \"hand gun and rifle sure shot\". In Tucson, Bill Freyse became a Blue Ribbon flower grower. Freyse occasionally drew elephants into his cartoons, and his hobby was collecting elephants, as noted by Ken Hall in his column, \"The Celebrity Collector\": Borden's father, the noted cartoonist Bill Freyse, was himself a lover of elephants and drew them for his (and Lynn's) amusement when she was a child. Freyse drew the daily and Sunday panels for Our Boarding House with Major Hoople from the 1930s through the '60s. The strips were syndicated to hundreds of newspapers nationwide. He also created the cartoon version of The Lone Ranger and co-created The Green Hornet. Artistry was his life's work, but elephants intrigued him. \"My father instilled in me a great sense of wonder and respect for the elephant,\" Lynn said from her home in California, where she lives with her husband, Roger, an automotive designer, and their Doberman Pinscher, Dino. \"Elephants are great, majestic creatures, very gentle by nature, and it's true they never do forget!\" The first pieces in her collection were left to her by her father, including a bronze elephant, about eight inches tall, and a pair of bronze elephants sitting back to back, their legs in the air."

  "text" : "Benjamin Henry Blackwell (1849 - 26 October 1924) was an Oxford bookseller and politician, best known for founding the Blackwell's chain of bookshops. Benjamin Blackwell left formal education aged 13, working as an apprentice for local bookseller Charles Richards. Originally, he had hopes of becoming a librarian like his father, Benjamin Harris Blackwell; however his application for the post of City Librarian for Cardiff was turned down due to his lack of formal education. An entry from his diary shows that in spite of this setback, Blackwell intended to continue working in the book trade: \"I have now been with Mr Rose six years and seem likely to stay for a year or two, at the end of which I hope to be able with a little assistance to open in London or elsewhere a business on my own account.\" In 1879 he opened his own shop, B.H. Blackwell's, on Broad Street in Oxford. The local fame he gained as a result enabled him to successfully campaign for political office, and he served as Liberal Councillor for Oxford North."

  "text" : "Billy Arnold (September 21, 1926 – May 18, 1995) was a highly touted welterweight/middleweight prospect of the 1940s. Born in Slab Fork, West Virginia, Arnold turned pro November 1, 1943, while still in high school. He became an overnight sensation by racking up an impressive string of 16 straight knockout victories. Arnold's style was similar to Sugar Ray Robinson; he was a slick boxer with lightning-fast combinations, and a knockout punch. The Ring Magazine and various newspapers across the United States touted Arnold as the next Joe Louis or Sugar Ray Robinson. Arnold was a heavy favorite to defeat Rocky Graziano, and then to go on to fight for the world title. In a brutal battle staged in March 1945, Arnold battered the rough and tough Graziano for the first few rounds. It seemed only a matter of moments when the fight would be stopped. However, Graziano absorbed the beating and went on to batter and knockout Arnold in one of the major upsets in boxing."

Born in Springfield, Illinois, Watson began his career at age 15 performing a vaudeville act at the Olympic Theatre in Springfield. As a teenager, he toured the U.S. midwest with the \"Kickapoo Remedies Show\", a traveling medicine show. He then appeared in Coney Island in a Gus Edwards show. In 1918, he first played on Broadway when he was a replacement in the role of Robert Street in Going Up and then created the role of the flamboyant dressmaker \"Madame Lucy\" in the hit musical Irene (1919), later repeating the role. He continued to play on Broadway through the 1920s. Watson began to appear in films at the end of the silent film era, in 1925, playing various character roles, including an interior decorator, a radio announcer, a hotel manager, a dance director, a band leader, a dress maker and a detective. He was a diction coach (uncredited) in Singin' in the Rain (1952). In 1942, he appeared as Adolf Hitler in a Hal Roach Studio short subject called The Devil With Hitler. Watson would appear as Hitler in nine films all together, including Hitler – Dead or Alive (1942), Nazty Nuisance (1943), The Miracle of Morgan's Creek (1944), The Hitler Gang (1944), The Story of Mankind (1957), On the Double (1961) and Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse (1962). Watson died in Los Angeles in 1965 at age 76. He is buried in the Oak Ridge Cemetery in Springfield, Illinois."

  "text" : "Bruno Bianchi (c. 1955 – 2 December 2011) was a French cartoonist and animator. Bianchi worked extensively as an artist, film and television director and screenwriter for animated productions, including the series Inspector Gadget, Rainbow Brite, Heathcliff and its spinoff film, Heathcliff: The Movie in 1986. In 1980, Bianchi directed two series for DiC Audiovisuel, the studio he had been working for since 1977. One of them was Cro et Bronto (Cro and Bronto), a series of 45 episodes of 1 minute and 20 seconds each, about a stone age man trying to catch and eat a brontosaurus. The other series, Archibald le Magi-chien (Archibald the Magic Dog), was an educational show, running for 46 episodes, about a magic anthropomorphic dog (in reality an old wizard who had lost the magic formula allowing him to become himself again). Archibald befriends a young boy named Pierre and go on many highbrow adventures with him, teaching him important lifestyle lessons along the way. This series was presumably the first major collaboration between Bianchi and Jean Chalopin, who, as the founder and CEO of DiC (now part of DHX Media), developed the show. Both Cro et Bronto and Archibald le Magi-chien are very hard to find today. In 1981–82, Bianchi co-created the animated television series Inspector Gadget together with Andy Heyward and DiC's founder Jean Chalopin. Bianchi also served as main character designer and supervising director on the show, which ran for two seasons and became one of the most iconic series created by DiC. Bianchi worked as a producer, artist, animator, television and film director, and writer for numerous other DiC Entertainment, Saban Entertainment and S.I.P. Animation productions from the 1980s until the early 2000s. His credits include Heathcliff, Jayce and the Wheeled Warriors, MASK, Rainbow Brite, Iznogoud, W.I.T.C.H., Diplodos, Beverly Hills Teens, Princess Sissi and Gadget and the Gadgetinis (a spinoff of Inspector Gadget). In 2008, Bianchi founded his own studio, named Ginkgo Animation, following the closure of S.I.P. International. Biachi died on 2 December 2011 at the age of 56. He was buried in Père Lachaise Cemetery in Paris on 6 December 2011."

  "text" : "Bas Nijhuis (born 12 January 1977) is a Dutch football referee. Since 2007 he has officiated for FIFA international matches. Nijhuis comes from Enschede and is full-time baker. Inspired by his father, who had also served as a referee, Nijhuis began refereeing at the age of 15 years. In March 2005 he made his debut in a SC Heerenveen match against RKC Waalwijk in the highest Dutch league, the Eredivisie. He has served as an official in the group stages of the UEFA Champions League and UEFA Cup in 2007 after being appointed as a FIFA referee. In 2009, Nijhuis was one of six referees at the FIFA U-20 World Cup. In 2011 he was selected for the U-17 World Cup in Mexico. Nijhuis has also officiated in qualifying matches for the 2010 and 2014 World Cups. On 21 December 2011 Bas Nijhuis gained worldwide attention and public criticism for sending off AZ Alkmaar goalkeeper Esteban Alvarado in a KNVB Cup second round match against Ajax after an Ajax supporter ran onto the pitch of the Amsterdam Arena and attacked him, prompting Alvarado to retaliate in self-defence by kicking the attacker several times. Alvarado's sending off caused his manager, Gertjan Verbeek, to order the team to walk off and abandon the match in protest."

He was also known as \"The Champ\", due to his exquisite riding skills. He won six Sydney jockeys' premierships during a distinguished career riding in Australia and overseas. Some of the achievements during his career included winning the 1941 and 1945 Melbourne Cups (Skipton and Rainbird), the 1930 Caulfield Cup (Amounis), the 1953 Sydney Cup (Carioca), and the 1954 CB Fisher Plate (Rising Fast). Perhaps his most famous victory was defeating Phar Lap on Mollison in the 1929 Chelmsford Stakes. He officially retired from riding in 1959. His son Peter was also a successful jockey.

Glassman and Judith McHale led to the award of the Joint Meritorious Civilian Service Award by the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in May, 2010. A 1969 graduate of Vanderbilt University, Brian Carlson served 36 years in the U.S. Foreign Service, rising to the rank of Career Minister.

He wrote numerous freelance articles on baseball for the The Sporting News between 1951 and 1965. When TSN cut its baseball coverage, Davids began his own short-lived baseball publication, Baseball Briefs. He contributed baseball fact boxes to several newspapers, including The Washington Post and Chicago Sun-Times. In 1971, Davids identified approximately 35 others with similar interests in baseball statistics and history – he called them \"stathistorians\" – and invited them to meet in Cooperstown, New York at the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum. Sixteen attended the meeting, and agreed to the formation SABR. Davids was elected the group's first president, an office he held on two other occasions. He also served two 5-year terms on SABR's board of directors, and was actively involved in producing many of the organization's early publications. Davids was also active in SABR's first regional chapter, based in Baltimore and Washington, which was named in his honor."

  "text" : "Bothwell Browne (born Walter Bothwell Bruhn; 1877 – 1947) was a Danish-American stage and film performer, best known as a female impersonator. Born in Copenhagen, Browne grew up in San Francisco  and developed a vaudeville act. At one point he was performing as a duo with male impersonator Kathleen Clifford. He was in New York by 1908, when the New York Times reports him as suing Texas Guinan over the rights to a Gibson Girl stage act. Deliberately or not, Browne competed with the better-known female impersonator Julian Eltinge. Some audiences, and theater managers, found his act more seductive and therefore more unsettling than Eltinge. Browne's Broadway production Miss Jack opened in September 1911 at the Herald Square Theater, exactly one week before Eltinge's more successful The Fascinating Widow. Browne's only film appearance is the 1919 Mack Sennett production Yankee Doodle in Berlin, Sennett's highest-budget film up to that point, and a bit of World War I propaganda. This release was parallel to Eltinge's own anti-German film Over the Rhine, (which was re-cut into The Isle of Love three years later). The same year Browne appeared as the headliner at the Palace Theater in New York, the single most sought-after booking in American vaudeville, in December 1919, supported on stage by the Sennett Bathing Beauties. This appears to be the pinnacle of his career. He thereafter retired to teach dancing classes in San Francisco, and died in Los Angeles."

Beatrix was the daughter of Margrave Albert III of Brandenburg and his wife, Matilda of Denmark. Their wedding in 1292 is historically significant because Beatrix brought the Lordship of Stargard as dowry into the marriage and thus into the hands of Mecklenburg. Beatrix's marriage did not produce a male heir, so the Ascanians reckoned Stargard fell back to Brandenburg when she died. Mecklenburg disagreed and this led to the so-called \"North German Margrave War\". Mecklenburg won and under the terms of the Treaty of Templin of 1317, Stargard definitively became part of Mecklenburg."

His parents' marriage was later declared illegal, because his father had already received minor orders. Baldwin was later declared legitimate by the pope, at the instigation of King Louis IX of France. In 1246, Baldwin received Beaumont as an apanage. He fought his whole life, together with his brother John I, against his half-brothers from his mother's second marriage with William II of Dampierre. He was said to be responsible for the accident that killed his half-brother William III of Dampierre during a tournament in Trazegnies. After the Edict of Péronne and the death of his brother John, he reconciled with his mother, who sent him to Namur on a revenge expedition. In 1287, Baldwin sold Dunkirk and Warneton to Guy, Count of Flanders. He is also known as a chronicler; he wrote the Chronique Universelle."

His photographic work documenting the 1871 Paris Commune is considered an important early example of photojournalism. While largely forgotten after his death, his work was rediscovered during preparations for the Commune's centennial in 1971, and his photographs have since been the exhibited at numerous museums, including the Musée d'Art et d'Histoire, the Musée d'Orsay, and the Carnavalet Museum."

He claimed to be descended from the French aristocracy, namely the Comte de Sales de Saint Salvy. He joined the army, serving in the 5th Battalion Royal Fusiliers, and later as Captain of the 18th Hussars. He gained the rank of Lieutenant-colonel. From 18 January 1902, he was an Exon of the King's Body Guard of the Yeomen of the Guard. In 1924, de Sales La Terriere's autobiography, Days that Are Gone, being the Recollections of some Seventy Years of the Life of a very ordinary Gentleman and his Friends in Three Reigns was published. The autobiography received favourable reviews in The Times shortly after its publication. De Sales La Terriere was a luminary of fashionable society at the time, although the Oscholars Library called his opinions of Oscar Wilde \"conservative and rather naïve\""

He ran for the party in the 2010 Donegal South-West by-election but lost to Pearse Doherty. Because of his involvement with both RTÉ and Fine Gael he has drawn comparisons with George Lee. O'Neill is a fan of the Donegal football team and Finn Harps and enjoys music by Daniel O'Donnell. O'Neill married Lorraine McCabe on 30 December 2011. Their January 2012 honeymoon in Europe attracted attention when controversial pictures of McCabe giving a Nazi salutes beside wax sculptures of Adolf Hitler and others were posted on Facebook. Sinn Féin TD Pádraig Mac Lochlainn defended O'Neill, saying: \"I think in my view, it's intended to be a bit of fun. It's very clumsy and he's apologised for any offence caused so I think it's one of those unfortunate... we all make mistakes.\""

  "text" : "Brenden Adams (born September 20, 1995 in Ellensburg, Washington) held the record for being the tallest teenager in the world. His father, Willie Adams, and mother, Debbie Ezell, first observed his extreme height condition when he was two months old. The condition is caused by a disorder with the 12th chromosome. His activities include joining a middle school football team. In 2008, there was an attempt to halt Brenden's growth when he was 7 ft 4.5 in (2.248 m) tall. Adams' growth curve almost mimics that of Robert Wadlow (currently the tallest man in recorded history). Some doctors estimate he would have been over 8 feet (2.4 m) tall if he kept growing constantly. After endocrinologist Dr. Gad Kletter's treatment with high-dose testosterone, his growth was arrested."

  "text" : "Captain Bertram Dickson FRGS (21 December 1873 – 28 September 1913) was a pioneer Scottish airman and the first British serviceman to qualify as a pilot. His exploits in the air, watched by Winston Churchill and Lord Kitchener, indirectly led to the creation of the Royal Flying Corps. Bertram Dickson was born in Edinburgh, Scotland on 21 December 1873. In 1892 Dickson accompanied the geographer Sir Thomas Holdich to the Andes Mountains to define the border between Chile and Argentina. After officer training at the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, Dickson was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Royal Artillery in November 1894. He was promoted to lieutenant in November 1897 and in November 1900 he was promoted to captain. The following May, Dickson was seconded for service with the Foreign Office. By 1908 Dickson was in the Ottoman Armenian city of Van serving as the military attaché and vice-consul. At the beginning of 1910 he enrolled at the Farman flying school at Mourlemon, and gained Aero-Club de France license no. 81 on 12 April.Dickson took part in the Lanark flying meet in August 1910, where he won the £400 prize for the greatest aggregate distance flown. In September 1910 Dickson flew one of the two Bristol Boxkites that took park in the British army manouevres on Salisbury plain: his aircraft was captured by the opposing team when he landed to report the result of his reconnaissance by telephone. On 1 October 1910 while in Milan, Dickson was involved in the first mid-air collision between two aeroplanes. An Antoinette monoplane, piloted by René Thomas of France, rammed Dickson's Farman biplane. Both pilots were injured in the crash. Although Dickson survived, he never fully recovered from his injuries, which contributed to his early death on 28 September 1913. His body was buried in the Highland village of Achanalt in Ross and Cromarty."

  "text" : "Herbert Otto Roth (7 December 1917 – 27 May 1994) was a notable New Zealand socialist, labourer, librarian and historian. He was born in Vienna, Austria in 1917. In his native Austria, he was known as \"Otti\", but in New Zealand, he was known as \"Bert\". Roth was leader of the Red Falcons in Austria. He fled from his native country to avoid conscription after having sworn an allegiance to Adolf Hitler. He then lived in Grenoble, where he was later imprisoned as an enemy alien. His mother managed to organise a permit for him to emigrate to New Zealand, and he arrived in Wellington in April 1940. He immediately became politically active in left wing circles, but was forbidden by the Department of Justice to take on official positions, as he was classed as an enemy alien. Roth applied for naturalisation in 1944, and was granted citizenship in March 1946. Roth joined the Air Force and this allowed him to study towards a Bachelor of Arts at Victoria University College. After attending the New Zealand Library School, he worked for the National Library Service in Wellington. He was later the president of the New Zealand Library Association. In January 1962, he started work for the University of Auckland Library. He went into retirement in 1983. He married Margaret (Margot) Frances Hogben on 29 November 1946. She was a journalist, and the granddaughter of George Hogben. Roth's first book was a biography of the seismologist. After that, Roth has mostly written about labour history. His most important work is Trade unions in New Zealand past and present, which was published in 1973. He was a major collector of union and labour publications, and his collection is today a major resource for the Alexander Turnbull Library. He died at his home in Mount Eden on 27 May 1994. He was survived by his divorced wife, two sons and a daughter."

  "text" : "Ramón Amor Amezcua Sánchez (born November 10, 1962), a.k.a. Bostich is an electronic music composer. Amezcua is an important figure in electronic music, especially in Mexico, Tijuana, and along the USA-Mexico border regions, but also in the United States and internationally. He has written songs for The Nortec Collective, as well as Nortec Collective presents: Bostich+Fussible. He has earned several Grammy Nominations, the most recent in 2011 for Bulevard 2000 by Nortec Collective Presents Bostich+Fussible under the category of Best Latin Rock/Alternative Album. Amezcua is considered the Godfather of Nortec by producers and fans alike since Bostich's early Nortec music clearly established the characteristics of his style: an interest in the electronic exploration, fragmentation, and reconstitution of tarola (snare drum) rhythmic patterns and tuba sounds and timbres, and their combinatorial possibilities. His song “Polaris“ marks the genesis of the Nortec style of music with its sequenced burpy tubas and machinegun drum sprays. Amezcua began his career as a recording artist and performer in the early 1990s when electronic music began to gain prominence in Mexico. He has recorded consistently since 1992 using the aliases Bostich, Point Loma, Monnithor and Las Cajas del Ritmo. As Bostich, he has collaborated with visual artists (Fritz Torres, Jorge Verdin, Checo Brown, Ernesto Aello), film directors (Les Bernstein, Hans Fjellestad, Emilio Maillé, Alex Rivera), writers (José Manuel Valenzuela, Alejandro L. Madrid, Juan Carlos Reyna), and musicians and composers (Pauline Oliveros, Kronos Quartet, Alan Parsons, The Baja California Orchestra, and Pepe Mogt). Since 2007, Amezcua has performed with Pepe Mogt, together known as \"Bostich+Fussible,\" and presenting themselves in concert as Nortec Collective presents: Bostich+Fussible. In 2011, the duo were honored performers at the opening ceremony of the 2011 Pan-American Games in Guadalajara, Mexico."

  "text" : "Bella Fromm (20 December 1890 – 9 February 1972) was a German journalist and author of Jewish origin, who lived in exile in the United States from 1938. She is best known as the author of Blood and Banquets (1943), an account of her time as diplomatic correspondent for Berlin newspapers during the Weimar Republic, and of her experiences during the first five years of the Third Reich. Although this book was published as an authentic contemporary diary, and is frequently cited as such, recent research suggests that Fromm wrote it in the U.S. after leaving Germany. Fromm was born in Nuremberg and grew up in Kitzingen in Lower Franconia, part of a family of prosperous assimilated Jewish wine merchants. By her own account, her family was on friendly terms with the Bavarian royal family and other leaders of Bavarian high society. Her father died when she was a child, and her mother, to whom she was devoted, died in 1918. In 1911 she married a Jewish businessman, Max Israel, with whom she had a daughter, Grete-Ellen (known as “Gonny” in Fromm’s writing). After her divorce from Israel she married Karl Julius Steuermann, from whom she was also later divorced. During World War I Fromm worked for the German Red Cross and was decorated by the King of Bavaria. After her mother’s death she inherited the family fortune and was able to devote her time to social work. The inflation of 1923, however, destroyed her wealth and she was forced to look for work. Using family contacts, she was employed by the Ullstein press, a major Jewish-owned publishing house, and worked for the Ullstein newspapers, notably the Berliner Zeitung (“BZ”) and the Vossische Zeitung, a leading Berlin liberal newspaper. Initially confined to traditional roles for female journalists such as fashion and social gossip, Fromm proved talented and ambitious and soon graduated to writing about politics and diplomacy."

  "text" : "Barrett Lancaster Brown (born August 14, 1981) is an American journalist, essayist and satirist. He founded Project PM, a research collaboration and wiki, to facilitate analysis of the troves of hacked emails and other leaked information concerning the inner workings of the cyber-military-industrial complex. In January 2015, Brown was sentenced to 63 months in federal prison for the crimes of accessory after the fact, obstruction of justice, and threatening a federal officer stemming from the FBI's investigation into the 2012 Stratfor email leak. Prosecutors had previously brought other charges associated with his sharing of an HTTP link to the leaked Stratfor data, but those charges were dropped in 2014. As part of his sentence, Brown was also required to pay almost $900,000 to Stratfor. Prior to 2011, Brown had ties with the hacktivist collective Anonymous."

Gordon was drafted into the US Army, where he worked with the former Nazi rocket scientist, Dr Wernher von Braun. Gordon's calculations of the gravitational interactions of earth, moon, and satellite contributed to the success and longevity of Explorer I, which launched in 1958 and remained in orbit until 1970. He was the step-grandson of General George Barnett and is a descendant of the Gordon family of British distillers, producers of Gordon's Gin."

  "text" : "Bruce Adolf H. Magnuson (February 21, 1909 – June 24, 1995) was a Canadian trade unionist and Communist leader. Magnuson was born in the Swedish province of Värmland and grew up on his parents' farm. He immigrated to Canada in the spring of 1928 at the age of 19 and worked on farms in Saskatchewan before settling in the Lakehead district of northern Ontario in 1933 where he got involved in a bushworkers' strike led by the Lumber Workers Industrial Union of Canada. He was hurt working in the bush and spent several months in hospital convalescing during which time he read the Communist Manifesto and other leftwing literature and decided to join the Communist Party of Canada. Magnuson as elected president of Local 2786 Lumber and Sawmill Workers' Union in 1940 and led the union until 1951 when Communists were purged by the parent union, the United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners of America, after which Magnuson organized a breakaway union, the Canadian Union of Woodworkers In 1946, he led a strike that is credited with establishing the Lumber and Sawmill Workers Union on a broad basis in northern Ontario winning recognition of the union by lumber companies as the bargaining authority for workers in the pulpwood industry and establishing collective bargaining in the region's timber industry. From August 1940 to August 1942, Magnuson was interned first at Camp Petawawa and later at an internment camp at Hull, Quebec as a subversive under the Defence of Canada Regulations. He and other communists were released after the Soviet Union became an ally as a result of Germany's invasion of the USSR. Magnuson was on the founding executive of the Labor-Progressive Party in Ontario and a frequent candidate. In the 1957 federal election, Magnuson was the Labor-Progressive candidate in Port Arthur against Liberal cabinet minister C.D. Howe but withdrew a few weeks prior to the election in order to support Co-operative Commonwealth Federation candidate Douglas Fisher who went on to defeat Howe by 1,400 votes in an upset victory Magnuson had won 923 in the 1953 federal election in Port Arthur. He became leader of the Labor-Progressive Party in Ontario following its crisis in 1956 when provincial leader Stewart Smith, former MPP J.B. Salsberg and hundreds of other party members left in the aftermath of Nikita Khrushchev's Secret Speech, the 1956 Hungarian Uprising as well as revelations about the extent of anti-Semitism in the Soviet Union under Stalin. Magnuson led the Labor-Progressive Party in the 1959 Ontario election, and remained leader of the party as it renamed itself the Communist Party of Canada (Ontario) and contested the 1963 and 1967 provincial elections He last ran as a Communist Party candidate in the 1984 federal election in Sudbury winning 75 votes. He remained a member of the Central Executive of the Communist Party of Canada in the mid-1980s. He died in Toronto in 1995."

Serving as Senior Creative director for 15 years, he worked with such clients as Troublemaker Studios, Pixar, Disney, DreamWorks and Blue Sky Studios. From 1998 to 2009 Oldenburg oversaw a joint venture with William Joyce and Reel FX. Oldenburg and Joyce’s other collaborations include Halloween decor for Martha Stewart, Parade Floats for Disney and Title Design for feature films. Their most recent story is now in production at DreamWorks called The Guardians of Childhood. Oldenburg's work has won many industry accolades, most recently the Distinguished Alumni of the Year from Ringling College of Art and Design, where he received his BFA in Illustration and sits on the Board of Trustees. Oldenburg and renowned designer Brad Oldham collaborated on a giant sculptural series for a $1.4 million commission called The Traveling Man, which has drawn national attention. Brandon's illustrations have graced the covers for such prestigious authors' books as Elmore Leonard and Michael Chabon. In 2009, Oldenburg and Joyce founded Moonbot Studios in Shreveport, Louisiana. Their initial goal was to create an Academy Award-nominated animated short film as a calling card of the quality of the studio's work. In 2012, they overshot their goal when The Fantastic Flying Books of Mr. Morris Lessmore won not only the nomination but the Oscar."

Brian wrote two books in the 1970s: Experimental Music in Schools (ISBN 978-0193231955) and Projects in Sound (ISBN 978-0900938450), which propose a new graphical form of Musical notation, showing instruments as images representing their sound, rather than traditional notation on a stave. For example, the notation of a scraping wood Güiro would be shown as zig-zag lines. Both books have been used extensively in classrooms and became part of the National Curriculum of England, Wales and Northern Ireland His compositions include approximately 150 songs many of which are settings of Chinese poems with lyrics in English prepared by the composer, as well as a number of piano pieces.

  "text" : "Betty Jane Rhodes (April 21, 1921 – December 27, 2011) was an American actress and singer, most active in film during the late 1930s and the World War II era. She was widely known to wartime movie audiences for her debut performance of the classic song, \"I Don't Want To Walk Without You\", in Sweater Girl in 1942. In 2012, Tom Vallance of The Independent wrote of Rhodes performance, \"Her place in the history of popular song is secured by her having introduced on screen one of the great songs of wartime longing, \"I Don't Want To Walk Without You.\" Rhodes later had her own weekly show on NBC during the 1950s, which aired on Saturday nights. Her appearances, as well as other early television roles, earned her the nickname, \"The First Lady of Television.\" Rhodes also sang in cabaret until the 1960s. Rhodes was born in Rockford, Illinois, on April 21, 1921. She began her broadcasting career when she was just eight years old. Paramount Pictures signed her to her first film contract as an actress at the age of fifteen. She made her screen debut in the 1936 film, Forgotten Faces, in which she was credited as Jane Rhodes. In Forgotten Faces, which was directed by Ewald André Dupont, Rhodes played an adoptive daughter whose father, portrayed by Herbert Marshall, is arrested for killing a man with whom his wife was having an affair. This was followed by a co-starring role in the 1936 comedic film, The Arizona Raiders. The film, in which she played the younger sister of Marsha Hunt's character, marked the first time that Rhodes sang in a movie. She was the regular singer on the radio show Meet Me at Parky's, the series starring Harry Einstein as his character Parkyakarkas. In 1945, Rhodes married her husband, Willet Brown, the co-founder of the Mutual Broadcasting System. She and Brown had one child during their marriage, as well as Brown's three children from his previous marriage. Brown died in 1993. Betty Jane Rhodes died on December 27, 2011, at the age of 90."

  "text" : "Bernadette Davis is a television screen-writer, who co-wrote the first 2 series of the BBC's sitcom Game On with Andrew Davies. She wrote the third series on her own. She was nominated for a BAFTA award for Game On in 1997. Game On was said to be: \"a part of a zeitgeist that came to define a generation\" and was a \"sitcom that was so of its time, that it took its name from a catchphrase of the decade.\" She studied English and Drama at Goldsmiths College, University of London. In 1996, Davis co-wrote the mini-TV series Wilderness with Andrew Davis, from the novel by Dennis Danvers. She also wrote an episode of Soldier Soldier in 1997, titled \"Line of Departure\". She wrote a 6-episode sitcom series called The Wilsons in 2000, which featured David Bradley and Julian Rhind-Tutt, in one of his earliest roles. In 2012, she wrote the BBC Three sitcom series Some Girls. Series 1 aired in November 2012, and series 2 started airing in September 2013. Some Girls has been described as: \"...a comedy about the kind of girls more usually seen in worrying documentaries about inner city teens. The series centres around a group of 16/17 year old pupils at [a] Comprehensive School in London.\" Davis herself said about the show: \"As far as I know, there aren't any other comedies about girls of this age. Inbetweeners has shown what a rich area for comedy this age group is - but girls are very different and I thought they should have their own show.\" The Daily Mirror made the first episode of Some Girls \"Tuesday's must-see TV\" and described the show as \"Energetic, irreverent and real\". The Stage online said: \"the relationship between the quartet of friends is well observed and firmly rooted in recognisable, realistic emotions\". Comedian Jimmy Mulville, Managing Director of Hat Trick Productions, says: “This second series of Some Girls confirms Bernadette Davis as one of the funniest writers working today. We're lucky to have her.”"

  "text" : "Boris Spiegel (born 18 February 1953 in Khmelnytskyi, Ukraine) (Russian: Бори́с Исаа́кович Шпи́гель) is a Russian politician and businessman. Haaretz describes him as an oligarch who is \"closely tied to the Kremlin.\" From 2003 to 2013, he has represented Penza Oblast in the Russian Federation Council; in December 2011, he was appointed the First Deputy Chairman of the Committee on Constitutional Legislation, Legal and Judicial Affairs and Civil Society Development. In 2010, he founded World Without Nazism, an organisation with close ties to the Russian government, formed to affirm the Russian version of history, particularly in relation to the Soviet occupation of the Baltic states and The Holodomor. This followed the establishment of the Presidential Commission of the Russian Federation to Counter Attempts to Falsify History to the Detriment of Russia's Interests the previous year. The organization is described in the Annual Review of the Estonian Security Police as a propaganda organization aimed at promoting \"a Soviet-era approach to World War II.\" It cooperates closely with the Finnish Anti-Fascist Committee. He is also chairman of the organization World Congress of Russian Jewry (WCRJ), an organisation that according to The Jewish Chronicle \"works on behalf of the Kremlin\" despite its nominal independence. During the 2008 South Ossetia War, he accused Georgia of committing genocide, acting as president of WCRJ, which attracted criticism from Israeli voices. The Jewish Chronicle writes that Spiegel \"is firmly in the pro-Putin camp. His subservience was clearly on show […] during the fighting in the Caucasus when he joined the Kremlin's propaganda campaign calling for the establishment of a tribunal that would investigate Georgia's 'war crimes' and 'genocide.'\" Spiegel has accused the countries that were formerly part of the Communist Bloc (except Russia and Belarus) of \"rapid nazification.\" He also criticizes the \"Western European democracies\" for their alleged role in starting World War II. He proposes a common history textbook for all of Europe based on \"serious scientific study, as well as the decisions of international judicial and political authorities on which basis the postwar world order had been built.\" He founded the pharmaceutical company BIOTECH in 1990 and the music production company \"Music. Perfection. Beauty\" in 1999. He has been deputy chairman of the political party Revival of Russia since 2002. In January 2011, Spiegel was the subject of media attention when he was robbed of 280,000 USD in cash in his hotel room. He is the former father-in-law of popular Russian tenor singer Nikolay Baskov. He is one of the few Russian politicians who openly proclaim himself as the adherent of Judaism. On Spiegel's initiative, monuments of Soviet Red Army soldiers have been erected in the Israeli city of Netanya. In March 2013 Boris Spiegel resigned from the Russian Federation Council."

Passman (22 January 1916 - 10 February 2007) was a sculptor and jeweller, founder of a black coral jewelry company and brand, Passman (currently produced by Glyptica, Inc. under license). Passman founded his company in 1975 on Grand Cayman. He created black coral and gold sculptures for the White House, the British Royal Family, and various museums. Examples of his work include the Cayman Islands's gift of a 97-piece set of sterling silver and black coral tableware for Prince Charles and Lady Diana's wedding in 1981; a black coral horse and corgi dogs for Queen Elizabeth and Prince Philip, and commissions for the Pope and various celebrities. Other well-known works are his Can Can Girls and his statues of Charlie Chaplin. Passman died in 2007 aged 91. His company was acquired the same year by Cayman Islands-based Active Capital Ltd. This is a private equity firm belonging to the family that founded Dart Container. There were Bernard K. Passman galleries and retail outlets in Charlotte Amalie, United States Virgin Islands, George Town, Cayman Islands, Las Vegas, Beverly Hills, etc. In May 2013 the galleries and business faced closure after the CEO of the past owner of Passman, GEM Manufacturing LLC pleaded guilty to illegally importing a batch of black coral. In 2014 the production of the Passman collection has been renewed using sustainably harvested black coral when Glyptica, Inc. under Tchavdar Tchouchev (previously Passman's Director of Design Development), has acquired the license."

  "text" : "Sir Basil Bramston Hooper, ARIBA (17 April 1876–3 February 1960) was a New Zealand architect. He was born in Lahore, India on 17 April 1876. Hooper was one of Dunedin's leading architects in the arts and crafts movement, and many of the city's stately homes were designed by him. Hooper's houses revitalised domestic architecture in New Zealand prior to the First World War, and he also carried out commercial and ecclesiastical commissions. In 1948 he retired having weathered the lean architectural years of the 1930s and the Second World War. He died at Waiuku on 3 February 1960, survived by a daughter and a son."

She probably lived within the period 1090 to 1150 and was one of few Christian women mentioned in Heimskringla by Snorre Sturlasson. Borghild was the daughter of a wealthy farmer who owned the farm Stordal (Store-Dal i Skjeberg) in the parish of Skjeberg in Østfold. One winter, King Sigurd spent a period as a guest at her father. The close friendship which developed between Borghild and Sigurd gave rise to rumours that they were lovers. Borghild regarded these rumours as offensive, and voluntarily demanded to perform a trial by ordeal to prove that they were slander. She successfully did so. When King Sigurd heard of this ordeal, he took Borghild for his concubine and brought her away with him."

The pope, however, ruled in favor of Barbara, who managed to build up a good relationship with the members of the chapter."

Through his spiritual discourses he was instrumental in propagating the knowledge that Swaminarayan was Purushottam, the Supreme Being, and that his own guru, Gunatitanand Swami, was Akshar, the divine abode of God. His spiritual realization and elevated spiritual practice as a low-caste householder set new precedents and acted as a bulwark against the idea that spiritual elevation was confined to upper castes. He passed on the knowledge of the Akshar-Purshottam Upasana to his closest disciple, Shastriji Maharaj, who later founded BAPS Swaminarayan Sanstha in 1907. His extraordinary spiritual service and unflinching devotion towards Gunatitanand Swami elevated him to an exalted status among devotees of the Swaminarayan sect both past and present."

Born into a U.S. Air Force family in 1949, O'Neill's growing up years were spent on many Air Force bases throughout the United States, at a time when piston-engined aircraft a generation or two behind the B-17 were still in wide use. His Air Force upbringing fostered a lifelong interest in World War II aviation history. After graduating from the University of Maryland in 1971, O'Neill served with the U.S. Navy for three years, first as a destroyer gunnery officer and then as a shipyard repair officer at the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard. Upon leaving military service he became an attorney and the General Counsel of Curtiss-Wright Corporation, the aviation company that had manufactured the P-40 Warhawk fighter and the Cyclone B-17 engines during World War II. In 2001 O'Neill left corporate life to enter the private practice of law. As of 2013 he manages a very active immigration and employment law firm based in Morristown, New Jersey."

  "text" : "Berthe Weill (Paris 1865 – 1951) was a French art dealer who played a vital role in the creation of the market for twentieth-century art with the manifestation of the Parisian Avant-Garde. Although she is much less known than her well-established competitors like Ambroise Vollard, Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler and Paul Rosenberg, she may be credited with producing the first sales in Paris for Pablo Picasso and Henri Matisse and with providing Amedeo Modigliani with the only solo exhibition in his lifetime (see poster advertising the exhibition). The impressive list of artists who made their way through her gallery and into the canon of modern art continues with names such as Raoul Dufy, André Derain, Maurice de Vlaminck, Diego Rivera, Georges Braque, Kees van Dongen, Maurice Utrillo. Her role was also important in the early exposure and sales of women painters such as Suzanne Valadon, Emilie Charmy and Jacqueline Marval. In 1933, Weill published her memoirs, an account of thirty years as an art dealer, from which many historical renditions quote. Her gallery lasted until 1939 and notwithstanding the number of luminary artists that passed through her gallery, she remained poor and destitute her whole life and after her death was almost forgotten. Recently, interest in Berthe Weill has become more significant. In 2007, Picasso’s portrait of Berthe Weill (1920) was designated a French national treasure. In 2009 her memoirs (1933) were republished  and a compilation of her gallery exhibitions; in 2011 the first study dedicated to her life and dealership was published. In February 2012, the City of Paris decided to put a memorial stone at 25 rue Victor Massé (paris 9e) where Berthe Weill opened her first gallery in 1900."

  "text" : "Boetius MacEgan (Baothnalach Mac Aodhagáin) (died May 1650) was a 17th-century Irish Roman Catholic Bishop of Ross. He was born in the barony of Duhallow in north-west County Cork and educated in France and Spain. He returned to his native Munster as a Franciscan friar in the 1630s and was promoted to several positions of importance in the Franciscan order. He was an enthusiastic supporter of the Confederation of Kilkenny, which controlled most of Ireland between the 1641 uprising and the Cromwellian conquest of 1649. In 1645 a new Papal nuncio landed in Ireland with arms and funds to support the rebellion and befriended MacEgan, appointing him chaplain general of the Ulster forces. In this capacity MacEgan accompanied the Confederation forces on many campaigns and was present at the Confederation victories at the Battle of Benburb in 1646, Limerick and Kilkenny. In 1646 he was proposed as bishop of Ross by the nuncio himself and consecrated at Waterford in 1648, but probably never gained access to his see, which remained under Protestant control. On Cromwell's landing in 1649, MacEgan became very active in rallying the Confederation forces and organising defensive measures. He then joined David Roche's force of untrained men who were intending to relieve the siege of Clonmel. They were however intercepted near Macroom by the seasoned cavalry of Lord Broghill and put to flight. MacEgan himself was captured and taken the following day to the walls of Carrigadrohid castle, which was occupied by Confederation forces, and told to call on them to surrender. He chose instead to exhort them to hold on and as a result was hanged from a nearby tree. The garrison surrendered shortly afterwards. MacEgan's body was later buried in the local churchyard at Aghinagh."
