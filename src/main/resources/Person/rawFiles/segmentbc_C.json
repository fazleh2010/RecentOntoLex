  "text" : "Charles E. Alden (fl. 1906) was an obscure inventor mentioned in a 1906 edition of the New York World who was claimed to have created the idea of a vest pocket telephone, a device that was the precursor of the cell phone. An article entitled: “Ingenious Yankee Invents Simple Telephone System” appeared in the May 24, 1907 edition of L’Abeille de la Nouvelle-Orléans–a New Orleans newspaper. He envisioned the idea in 1906, sixty-seven years before the first hand-held mobile phone was demonstrated by Dr Martin Cooper of Motorola in 1973. In 1907, Alden invented and tested a wireless, remote controlled boat off the coast of Martha's Vineyard. This boat was said to have “lifted its own anchor, blows its own whistle, signals, fires a gun and steers” all while the operator is controlling it on shore."

After his father's death, his brother Nicholas V ruled alone until Christopher came of age; from 1401, they ruled jointly. After Nicholas V died in 1408, Christopher ruled alone. He began calling himself \"Prince of the Wends\" on 4 May 1418 on the basis of chronicles written by Bishop Otto of Havelberg, which he regarded as evidence for his royal descent. He was probably killed on 25 August 1425 during a battle at Pritzwalk against troops from Brandenburg. He was probably unmarried and definitely childless. With his death, the Werle-Goldberg line died out and Werle-Goldberg fell to his cousin William."

Hopefully that anonymity will become lost at the museum in Missouri and in his upcoming book.  What's more he is the only collector alive who spent more than a year traveling around the world, from continent to continent, collecting and documenting his finds.  If history teaches any lessons at all, Bert will be remembered as the one individual in our time who preserved treasures of the past, which would have otherwise been completely lost or forgotten.  I am confident future generations will realize the value of his work even more than today" ]

At Kenyon College and at Oxford University, he began the research that was published as Milton and the Christian Tradition, a classic study of John Milton's Christian theology. Patrides was a professor at the University of California and the University of York and a distinguished professor at the University of Michigan. He was a prolific writer on literature and intellectual history who gave elegant lectures around the world. He edited study editions of the prose of Milton and of the poems of John Donne and George Herbert. After his 1986 death, his works and alms and all his good endeavors were commemorated by the annual Patrides lectures at York and by both the Patrides Fellowships and the Patrides Professorship at Michigan."

His container was equipped with a bed, toilet, heater, food and water, a laptop, cell phones and a satellite phone. He was found when workers in the Italian port of Gioia Tauro heard strange noises coming from his container. The container ship had left Egypt five days earlier and was bound for Canada. Forty-three-year-old Rizk was born in Egypt and had been a Canadian citizen for almost 20 years. He was carrying a valid Canadian passport that he had obtained in Cairo in August. He also carried a confirmed airline ticket for travel from Rome to Montreal (where he had family), as well as an aircraft mechanic certificate and security passes for airports in Canada, Thailand and Egypt. According to Italian prosecutors he had studied in Egypt and North America to become an airline mechanic. Shortly after the events of September 11, 2001, Rizk's story raised fears of a terrorist connection. Rizk was arrested on terrorism charges and interviewed. He was released on 15 November 2001. According to his lawyer, he chose the container because he believed a hostile brother-in-law was attempting to prevent his departure from Egypt."

  "text" : "Clarence Ridgley Greathouse (1846–1899) was an American journalist, lawyer, and diplomat serving in Japan and Korea. In Korea he was most renowned for leading the investigation into the murder of that country's Queen Min in October 1895. Clarence Ridgley Greathouse was born in Kentucky, the son of Dr. Ridgley Greathouse, who emigrated to California. In 1870 Clarence Greathouse moved to San Francisco to practice law. There he also became active in local Democratic politics and in 1883 was named general manager of the Democratic daily the San Francisco Examiner, a position he held until 1886 when he was appointed United States consul-general at Yokohama, Japan. He served successfully at this post for four years, from 1886 to 1890. Meanwhile, in Korea successive American representatives in the Korean capital of Seoul had succeeded in impressing Korea's King Gojong with the friendly and disinterested nature of the policy of the American government that he was led to secure a comparatively large number of American advisors. Thus, in September 1890, Greathouse was engaged to serve as legal advisor to the Korean government. At that time there were eight other Americans already serving in Seoul in various advisory capacities, a reality that displeased the Chinese. But despite positive suggestions by the Chinese Resident Yuan Shikai against the employment of further foreign advisors, on January 3, 1891, the Korean government named Greathouse a vice-president of the home office, granting him charge of matters pertaining to foreign legal affairs. General Legendre at this time was a vice-president of the same office as foreign advisor to the king. Greathouse's legal knowledge was often called upon in the drafting of conventions, in the constant negotiations with foreign representatives in Seoul, and in the revising of Korean law and the reorganizing, at least on paper, of the Korean judicial system. The best-known work of Greathouse was in connection with the trial of the Koreans implicated in the murder of the Queen of Korea by Japanese and Korean conspirators on October 8, 1895. After the king had escaped from his Japanese and Korean captors to the safety of the Russian legation, he asked Greathouse to supervise the investigation into the circumstances surrounding the death of the Queen. Greathouse attended all sessions of the court, examined the witnesses, and had the trials conducted in a thoroughly modern manner. It was owing to his influence that the trials were free from the gross faults which customarily disfigured the proceedings of all Korean courts, and that for general approximation to Western notions of justice and integrity they were in every way remarkable. During the last few years of his life Greathouse acted as confidential advisor to the King on foreign affairs. As far as the records show, he was never married; his mother remained with him until his death. While he was in Japan he secured the services of a young Goan, H. A. Dos Remedios, as his secretary. When he went to Korea he took his assistant with him and Dos Remedios came practically to occupy the position of son as well as secretary, although he was never officially adopted. Greathouse died in Seoul on October 21, 1899 while still in the service of the government of Korea. He is buried in the Yanghwajin Foreigners' Cemetery in central Seoul."

  "text" : "Cheryl Ann Wong is a Chinese–American writer and entrepreneur who was born in 1960 in Hollywood. She is a leader in minority business and was cited by Minority Business Magazine as an influencer who \"bridges the language gap for burgeoning Asian-American communities.\" She has led projects for industries ranging from entertainment (Universal Studios) and toys (Disney) to real estate development (City of Long Beach and Monterey Park, CA) and government representation (Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors and U.S. Congress). As an international business consultant, her most notable credit is her work on the billion dollar intellectual property, \"The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,\" where she co-developed the seminal writing for the property when it was first licensed for exploitation by Playmates Toys in the mid-1980s. She worked on Capitol Hill as a liaison to the White House, policy analyst and legislative aide for Rep. Gephardt and performed government representation for public transportation interests in the mid-1980s. She returned to California to run her own minority, woman-owned public relations firm, which by 1986 had folded into Pangea Corporation, an entity known for its entertainment, toy, licensing and animation development. As a co-director of Pangea, Wong has manufactured and distributed products worldwide (Yoga Divas), published software (Speed Racer) and developed online communities (AOL Kids) and networks (Radio Aahs). She is also one of the writers and developers of the intellectual property, The Brotherhood, which debuted on America Online as an animated online computer adventure. Most notably, Wong was staffed on political campaigns at the local, regional, state and federal government levels, including the Congressional run of Representative Richard Gephardt, California Governor Jerry Brown, and party fundraiser and delegate liaison for presidents Ronald Reagan and George H. Bush. She was responsible for creating the multilingual advertising and public relations programs to inform the Asian community of Southern California about the new Los Angeles Metro Rail System that started construction in 1990. Community outreach and dissemination of information were essential components of the massive undertaking of building a complex rail system beneath the second largest city in the United States. Wong and Pangea partnered with Coronado Communications to service the plethora of minority markets in California, from Latino to Chinese. She worked with Latino entrepreneur, Fernando Oaxaca, former associate director of the Office of Management and Budget during the Ford administration and Sandy Serrano-Sewell, a Latina activist and the Executive Director of Centro de Ninos in East L.A. Their efforts, combined together, created a triumvirate marketing and public relations team that afforded their constituency access to the Asian, Latino and Pacific Islander communities of California. Wong was the subject of the lead article, \"Different Drummer\" in Transpacific Magazine because of her provision of a multi-cultural perspective to key global corporate giants, who are able to better reach and serve minority communities from her insights. In mainstream culture, besides her work on the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, she has written for DIC Entertainment and was the keynote speaker in 1994 at the San Diego Comic Con for the session that debuted the one act play, Spritle: A One Man Show, a licensed parody about Speed Racer's younger brother, which she produced and directed with her writing partners, John Schulte and John Besmehn. Wong's program received coverage and accolades from Wizard Magazine, which listed it as one of the top 10 sessions of Comic Con 1994 She served as executive producer and co-writer on the Blair Witch Project: Official Interactive Companion. Wong also serves as a business consultant and governmental liaison to new business development for cities like Monterey Park, CA, participating in trade missions to promote both business and cultural exchange. She is the daughter and campaign director of civic leader and politician, Sophie C. Wong, former President of the Alhambra School Board and former Republican candidate for the California State Assembly."

Born in Alameda, California, Ravazza was a violinist who also started singing when he was in the Anson Weeks Orchestra. He was later the lead violinist with Tom Coakley when he took over that band upon Coakley's retirement from the music business. The Carl Ravazza or Carl Ravell Orchestra, with the theme song \"Vieni Su\", performed mainly in hotel venues in several cities in the United States. Ravazza later became a solo singer, settling in Reno, Nevada where he co-founded the Nevada Entertainment Agency in 1960. Ravazza's 1937 version of \"So Rare\" may be the earliest recording of the song, although it is unclear whether it was the first released version. Recorded on June 4, 1937, it was released under the name of Carl Ravell and His Orchestra."

  "text" : "Charles Bagge Plowright (3 April 1849 – 24 April 1910) was a British doctor and mycologist. Plowright trained as a doctor at the West Norfolk and Lynn Hospital, eventually becoming a surgeon there. He was also a Medical Officer for Health for many years in Freebridge Lynn, and was the Hunterian Professor of Comparative Anatomy and Physiology at the Royal College of Surgeons from 1890 to 1894. While a professor he gave lectures on ergot and fungi in the human body which were noted in the British Journal of Medicine. Plowright's most significant contributions were in mycology. In 1872 he published a list of 800 Norfolk fungi in the Transactions of the Norfolk and Norwich Naturalists' Society and was elected an honorary member. Starting in 1873, Plowright published a series of fasciculi (pamphlets intended to be collected into a book) titled Sphaeriacei Britannici describing members of the fungal genus Sphaeria (species modernly placed in Pseudovalsa, Macrospora, Homostegia, and others). With his collaborator William Phillips, Plowright published a series of papers titled New and Rare British Fungi (1871–1884) which described almost 300 new species. Plowright contributed to The Gardeners' Chronicle for over thirty years, writing principally on fungal diseases of plants; he was an early advocate in England of the use of Bordeaux mixture. Early in his career he made a special collection of Pyrenomycetae (now Sordariomycetes) and published several papers on them; he later moved on to the Uredinaceae, in 1889 publishing A Monograph of the British Uredinaea and Ustilaginaea. He was one of the early organizers of the British Mycological Society and served as president in 1898–9. Plowright had an interest in archaeology and published a number of articles on the subject, including several works on woad. Plowright also was active in his local community, serving as a local magistrate, director and vice-chairman of a local girl's high school, and governor of the Lynn Grammar School."

In 2003, he announced a breakthrough in microchip design and China who is anxious to develop indigenous hi-tech industry, greeted the news with great delight. He was even named as dean of microelectronics at Jiaotong University and promises even to deliver newer chips Hanxin II and III in 2004. However, it was proven to be fraudulent as a whistleblower revealed Hanxin chips were not really his creation at all which resulted in his expulsion, retrieval of his research funds and possible criminal investigation by authorities. The Chinese government banned him from any research in future."

  "text" : "Charles \"Charlie\" Luke (22 June 1915 – 1 January 1998) was an Australian rules footballer who played with Footscray in the Victorian Football League (VFL). Luke, a forward, came to Footscray from Phillip Island. He played 13 of his 18 career games in 1937 and kicked at least two goals in each of his home and away season appearances that year. His final season tally, 44 goals, was enough to top Footscray's goal-kicking. He spent much of the 1939 season playing for Yarraville and transferred to Gippsland club Morwell the following year, as captain-coach."

  "text" : "Clyde Vaughan (born in Mount Vernon, New York, United States) is a basketball coach and former professional player, who enjoyed a distinguished career at college level and professional level and international level for the England team. He was also selected as the 117th pick in 1984 NBA Draft by the Indiana Pacers but never appeared in the NBA. The 6 foot 4 small forward played college basketball for the Pittsburgh Panthers. Though he only played his last two seasons in the Big East Conference, they were the best two seasons of his career. As a junior, he averaged 21.9 ppg and grabbed 9.2 rpg. His 22.0 ppg average in conference led the league. As a senior, he added another 21.0 ppg and 8.3 rebounds. In his four years at the Panthers (1980–1984), Vaughan finished with a tally of 2,033 points scored and 922 rebounds. After being selected as the 117th pick in the 6th round of the 1984 NBA Draft with the Indiana Pacers, Vaughan was one of the final-cuts in training camp so instead went on to enjoy seven successful season's playing in England. He still ranks third on the all-time scoring average list, averaging 28.2 points per game. His 4,766 career points are 20th in league history and he is tenth in free throw shooting percentage at 83.2%. He averaged 7.9 rebounds per game and shot 57.9% from the floor, both among the career leaders in those categories. He was the BBL Player of the Year in 1989-90 whilst with Sunderland Saints and made 27 appearances for the English National Team. but his playing career came to an end with several back problems during his final season in Europe. Following his successful player career, Vaughan took a coaching job in 1992 with Long Beach State University, first as an assistant coach (1992-93 through 1996-97) and then as the associate head coach (1997-98 through 1998-99). From 1999 to 2002, he was assistant coach at the University of South Florida before taking the assistant coach job at UConn and the Huskies in 2002. In August 2004, Vaughan was arrested for patronizing a prostitute during an undercover police sting and immediately resigned from his post at the Huskies."

  "text" : "Chris J. L. Doran is a physicist, Director of Studies in Natural Sciences for Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge. He founded Geomerics, and is its Chief Operating Officer. Doran obtained his Ph.D. in 1994 on the topic of Geometric Algebra and its Application to Mathematical Physics. He was an EPSRC Advanced Fellow from 1999 to 2004. In 2004, he became Enterprise Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. Doran has been credited, together with Anthony N. Lasenby, Joan Lasenby and Steve Gull, for raising the interest of the physics community to the mathematical language and methods of geometric algebra and geometric calculus. These have been rediscovered and refined by David Hestenes, who built on the fundamental work of William Kingdon Clifford and Hermann Grassmann. In 1998, together with Lasenby and Gull, he proposed the gauge theory gravity. He took a break from academics in 2005, and he subsequently founded the software company Geomerics, making use of his extensive knowledge of mathematics. In his own words, he had been looking for a challenge and for other ways to win people over to geometric algebra. His research interests relate to applied mathematics and theoretical physics, in particular quantum theory, gravitation, geometric algebra and computational geometry. Doran has authored more than 50 scientific papers."

  "text" : "Charles Edwin Jones (1828 – 18 March 1903) was an Australian politician, member of the Victorian Legislative Assembly 1864 to 1871 and 1886 to 1889. Jones was born in Plymouth, Devon, England, to Welsh tailor John Jones and Elizabeth, née Tucker, becoming a tailor like his father. He became involved in radical and temperance causes and vigorously opposed Roman Catholicism. He married Anne Letitia Angear at Devonport in 1850, and in 1851 the couple migrated to Melbourne where Jones continued to work as a tailor until 1862. He was elected to Melbourne City Council in 1862 and remained until October 1865, his activism against Premier John O'Shanassy's \"Irish ministry\" led him to be associated with the protectionists despite his earlier free trade leanings. In 1864, having been persuaded by the Orange Order to stand for the Victorian Parliament, he was elected to the seat of Ballarat East as a supporter of James McCulloch, and was appointed government whip. Jones' wife died on 3 June 1863, and he remarried on 17 February 1865 to Charlotte Ryan. Appointed literary editor of the Ballarat Evening Post in 1867, he had defected to the Opposition in October 1866 after being disappointed in his hopes for a ministry; he later returned to McCulloch but lost his seat at the 1868 election. During the Darling grant crisis he was re-elected to the parliament, defeating the lands minister William Vale in a ministerial by-election for Ballarat West and joining the opposition to Charles Sladen's government. In July, with McCulloch's return to government, he was appointed commissioner of roads and railways and vice-president of the Board of Lands and Works. He quickly became embroiled in a series of court cases and inquiries resulting from his involvement in corrupt land operations; despite resigning his seat and winning re-election in March 1869, he was expelled from the Assembly in April and re-elected again by his constituents. He lost his seat in 1871 after his support was split by a large field of candidates. Jones' marriage fell apart in 1872 and after an unsuccessful court case in which he tried to marry Rebecca Einley he travelled to America, where he worked as a journalist and lecturer, living in Utah and Wisconsin. He returned to Victoria in 1881 and attempted to re-enter politics, failing at a by-election for Geelong in 1882 and for Ballarat West at the 1883 election before winning the seat in 1886. Running for Windermere in 1889 he was decisively defeated, losing again in 1892 for East Bourke Boroughs, after which he moved to Western Australia to work as a librarian. He continued his political efforts, running for Fremantle in the first federal election in 1901 with disappointing results. He returned to Ballarat in 1902 and died at Korumburra in 1903."

  "text" : "Calvin C.J. Sia (born Calvin Chia Jung Sia on June 3, 1927) is a primary care pediatrician from Hawaii who developed innovative programs to improve the quality of medical care for children in the United States and Asia. Two particular programs have been implemented throughout America: the Medical Home concept for primary care that has been promoted by the American Academy of Pediatrics and the federal Emergency Medical Services for Children program administered by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ Health Resources and Services Administration, Maternal and Child Health Bureau. His Medical Home model for pediatric care and early childhood development began to take root in several Asian countries in 2003. Sia is also creator of Hawaii Healthy Start Home Visiting Program to prevent child abuse and neglect and co-founder of Hawaii's Zero to Three program and Healthy and Ready to Learn Center. The Hawaii Healthy Start program, which targets expecting and new parents who may be at risk of abusing or neglecting their children, became the model for the Healthy Families America home visiting program that the United States Department of Justice's Office of Justice Programs identified in 2010 as a \"promising\" approach to child abuse prevention. The Healthy and Ready to Learn Center was a three-year pilot project to initiate training and health delivery services in an integrated system of care, with pediatric residents and graduate students in social work and early childhood education working as a team. In addition, Sia spearheaded the creation of the Variety School for learning disabled children, a Honolulu-based educational institution for children ages 5 through 13. Sia retired from his Honolulu-based medical practice in 1996, after almost 40 years of treating patients, but continues to promote Medical Home and community pediatrics as professor of Pediatrics at the University of Hawaii John A. Burns School of Medicine. Although he retired as chairman of the American Medical Association Section Council on Pediatrics in 2007, a post he assumed in 1983, Sia continues to play a national role as an emeritus member of the executive committee of the National Center for Medical Home Implementation Project Advisory Committee, an organization he formerly served as chairman."

  "text" : "Charles Plumb (November 13, 1899 - January 19, 1982 ) was an American cartoonist best known for maintaining a high quality of artwork on the comic strip Ella Cinders over three decades. He usually signed his work with the signature Charlie Plumb or Chas. Plumb. He also drew the topper strip Chris Crusty which ran above Ella Cinders from 1931 to 1940. Born and raised in Joplin, Missouri, Plumb moved at age 15 to Baxter Springs, Kansas, where his father, Carl H. Plumb, was a mining engineer in the Tri-state area of Kansas, Missouri and Oklahoma. After attending Baxter Springs High School, Charlie Plumb studied journalism, art and advertising at the University of Missouri and then worked as an artist and political cartoonist for newspapers in Chicago, Los Angeles and other cities. His parents eventually relocated to Ozark, Missouri."

  "text" : "Colonel Sir Charles Edward Merrett CBE (8 January 1863 – 11 November 1948) was an Australian merchant, agriculturist and political activist. Merrett was born at South Yarra in Melbourne to civil servant Samuel Headen Merrett and Sarah Ashton, née Baxter. His father died in 1878 and Charles, despite being a graduate from Melbourne Grammar School, was unable to attend university and instead became an office-boy at a merchants' and manufacturer's representation firm in 1880. By 1890 he had risen to become a partner in the business; he would eventually be managing director in 1916. He married Annie Florence Slocombe on 21 April 1891. He joined the St Kilda Rifles in 1880 and transferred to the Victorian Mounted Rifles in 1883, holding the posts of lieutenant and quartermaster (1889) and captain (1892). He later transferred to the Australian Light Horse and was promoted major in 1905; in 1915 he became lieutenant-colonel of the 5th Light Horse Brigade and the oldest serving officer in the Light Horse. Despite his wishes he remained in Australia during World War I and retired from the armed services in 1920 as a colonel. In 1915 Merrett was appointed president of the Royal Agricultural Society of Victoria he would serve a record term of 32 years, retiring in 1947. He was involved in founding the Young Farmers and the Country Women's Association. He was also politically involved, and in 1913 ran for the federal seat of Melbourne Ports for the Liberal Party. His later career tended towards organisational politics but he became disenchanted with the Nationalist Party and instead he and Thomas Ashworth founded the Liberal Union, a breakaway group opposed to Billy Hughes' leadership. Although the Union only operated as a political entity at the 1922 election, when it elected two candidates to the House of Representatives, it continued to endorse Nationalist candidates throughout the 1920s. He would later be involved in the downfall of the Allan-Peacock state government in 1927, forming the short-lived Australian Liberal Party. Merrett served on South Melbourne Council from 1915 to 1937 and was mayor from 1922 to 1923. He was also the chairman of a number of organisations, including the Canned Fruits Export Control Board, the Big Brother Movement, the New Settlers League, the State Employment Council and the Society for the Protection of Animals. In 1929 he was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire, and he was knighted in 1934. He died at Brighton in 1948."

  "text" : "Caspar Maximilian Brosius (12 June 1825 – 17 February 1910) was a German physician and psychiatrist born in Burgsteinfurt, Westphalia. Son of a parish doctor, Brosius studied medicine at the Universities of Greifswald and Bonn, receiving his doctorate in 1848 with a dissertation titled De hebetudine animi (Über den Stumpfsinn der Seele). Following graduation, he practiced medicine in Burgsteinfurt, and in 1855 started work as an assistant to Adolph Albrecht Erlenmeyer (1822-1877) at the Asyl für Gehirn- und Nervenkranke in Bendorf bei Koblenz. In 1857 he established a private psychiatric hospital at his homestead in Bendorf, where he created a humanitarian environment for the mentally ill based on a philosophy he called the \"familiare system\" (family system). In the following decades the facility underwent considerable expansion in size and function. At Bendorf he strove in providing living conditions for the mentally ill that were the equivalent to the those of the healthy, non-institutionalized public. He believed that his patients should have a place where they \"felt at home\", and deemed it necessary to assess and treat them on an individual basis. In 1859, with Friedrich Koster (1822-1893), he was a contributing editor of the psychiatric journal Der Irrenfreund, becoming its sole editor from 1878. In 1860 he published a translation of John Conolly's \"Treatment of the insane without mechanical restraints\" as Die Behandlung der Irren ohne mechanischen Zwang."

In 1958, Mark, along with George Fell, the first president of the Nature Conservancy, negotiated the purchase of Volo Bog by The Nature Conservancy. Mark, botanist Dr. Margery Carlson, the secretary of the Illinois chapter of The Nature Conservancy, and many others raised almost 1300 contributions from organizations and individuals (including teachers and students) to cover the cost of the acquisition. This was the first time in the chapter's history that there was an appeal to the public for help in raising funds. Mark employed many strategies in his fund-raising efforts from emphasizing the scientific and educational values of the land, to pointing out that contributions were tax-deductible. After its purchase by the Nature Conservancy, Volo Bog was conveyed to the University of Illinois and then to the State of Illinois for protection."

  "text" : "Charles-Dominique-Joseph Eisen (17 August 1720 – 4 January 1778) was a French painter and engraver. The son and pupil of Frans Eisen, he was born at Valenciennes. In 1741 he went to Paris, and in the following year entered the studio of Le Bas. His talent and his sparkling wit gained him admission to the court, where he became painter and draftsman to the King, and drawing-master to Madame de Pompadour. He afterwards fell into disgrace, and in 1777 retired to Brussels, where he died in poverty in 1778. His pictures are not without merit, but it is as a designer of illustrations and vignettes for books that he is best known. The most remarkable of these are the designs for the Fermiers généraux edition of the Contes of La Fontaine, published at Amsterdam in 1762; Ovid's Metamorphoses, 1767-71; the Henriade of Voltaire, 1770; the Baisers of Dorat, 1770; and the Vies des Peintres hollandais et flamands of Descamps, published in 1751-63. He etched some few plates of the Virgin, a St. Jerome, St. Ely preaching, etc. There are pictures by him in the Museums of Bordeaux, Alençon, and Bourg."

  "text" : "Claude Nau (died 1605), full name Claude Nau de la Boisseliere, was a confidential secretary of Mary, Queen of Scots in England from 1575 to 1586. Nau was a successful lawyer practicing in Paris when he was recruited by the Guise family in 1574 to be Mary's secretary. He was presented by the Duke of Guise, Mary's nephew, to Henry III of France who gave him diplomatic accreditation and sent him to Elizabeth I of England. Elizabeth gave a him a letter of introduction to the Earl of Shrewsbury the Scottish Queen's keeper at Sheffield Castle. Nau was frequently mentioned in Mary's correspondence, and many of his own letters survive. In June 1579, Mary sent Nau as her ambassador to her son, James VI of Scotland, instead of John Lesley, Bishop of Ross. However, the Scottish court at Stirling Castle would not allow him an audience, apparently because Mary's letter was addressed to her son, not the King. Although Nau was accompanied by Nicholas Arrington, Provost Marshal of Berwick upon Tweed, he had no papers from Elizabeth. The Privy Council of Scotland issued a proclamation that he deserved punishment and should be commanded to depart. Claude's brother, the Sieur de Fontenay, sent from France, had more success. Fontenay was able to meet James VI in August 1584. Fontenay wrote to Claude about his good reception, James had met him in his cabinet at Holyroodhouse, and lent him a horse to join the hunting. In November 1584, Nau spoke with Elizabeth, on the subject of Mary's allegations against Bess of Hardwick. Nau was arrested at Chartley in 1586, but seems to have lived comfortably with the family of Francis Walsingham. After Mary's execution he returned to France where he was exonerated from accusations of treachery to Mary by the King and the Duke of Guise. Joseph Stevenson discovered Nau's memoirs of Mary and her history and published these works in 1883. Stevenson also attributed a treatise in French on Mary's title to the English throne to Nau. Nau started translating John Lesley's Latin history of Scotland, the De Origine, into French. He did not complete this historical work."

He studied medicine in Marburg, Würzburg and Leipzig followed by work as an assistant at clinics in Rostock and Munich. In 1880 he became an assistant to Carl Westphal (1833–1890) in the psychiatric clinic at the Berlin-Charité. At the Charité he performed anatomical studies of the optic nerve, research involving the pupillary reaction of mental patients, the effects of syphilis on the brain, and clinical studies of alcoholism. In 1883 he received his habilitation for psychiatry, and during the following year worked as an assistant medical director at the Städtische Irrenanstalt Dalldorf in Berlin. In 1893 he became the first director of the newly built Irrenanstalt Herzberge, a position he maintained until 1914. Also he played an important role as adviser to the German government in regards to mental health issues. One of Moeli's better known assistants at Herzberge was neurologist Karl Birnbaum (1878–1950). Moeli died on 4 November 1919 in Berlin. He is best remembered for his work in forensic psychiatry. He performed extensive research involving the forensic relationship of alcoholism and alcoholic psychosis. He had particular interest in so-called \"degenerative personalities\" and associated psychoses."

  "text" : "Cynthia G. Franklin is a contemporary American literary and cultural critic educated at Stanford University and University of California (Berkeley). She is a feminist commentator on developments in cultural theory and, on academic culture in general. In two books and a series of articles, Franklin has paid special attention to life-writing, directing attention to overlooked subgenres such as the academic memoir and \"collective\" life-writing. As co-editor of the journal Biography, she plays a key role in shaping global scholarship on life-writing. Two special issues—Personal Effects and Translating Lives—she co-curated for Biography indicate this role. Through these special issues she has driven scholarly recognition of life-writing as a political as well as global genre. Franklin's book-length latest work is Academic Lives: Memoir, Cultural Theory and the University Today (U of Georgia Press, 2009). This book is a trenchant and wide-ranging critique of strands of contemporary cultural theory—feminist, post-colonial, disability studies and critical race studies. amongst others. By scrutinizing memoirs written by such influential fellow critics as Edward Said and Jane Tompkins, Franklin throws startling light on ignored aspects of academic culture. Franklin's previous book Writing Women's Communities: The Politics and Poetics of Contemporary Multi-Genre Anthologies (University of Wisconsin Press, 1997)shows how feminist writers of the 70s and 80s pioneered the anthology as a unique form of narrating women's lives. Franklin got her Bachelor of Arts from Stanford University and her MA and Ph.D. from University of California at Berkeley. She teaches at the University of Hawai'i at Manoa, where she is the recipient of teaching awards, including the Board of Regents Award for Excellence in Teaching, the highest award for teaching bestowed by the university."

  "text" : "Catherine Galliford (born 1966-1967) is a Royal Canadian Mounted Police Corporal in British Columbia, Canada. Galliford served as spokesperson for the Missing Women's Task Force (associated with the BC Missing Women Investigation), who came to prominence in 2011 for bringing forward allegations of extensive sexual harassment and misconduct within the RCMP.Chief among her allegations is the claim that officers in the Missing Women's Task Force neglected their duties and tolerated a three-year delay in apprehending serial killer Robert Pickton. When asked to testify before the Missing Women Commission of Inquiry, Galliford stated that she would not be testifying for the RCMP \"but rather, on behalf of the victims.\"However, one month before hearings began in 2012, the inquiry deemed Galliford \"too fragile\" to testify, citing alcoholism and post traumatic stress disorder. The RCMP, which denies the accusations by Galliford, is now seeking to dismiss her from the force  Her case is scheduled to go to trial in 2015. A class action lawsuit is proceeding alongside hers and Janet Merlo has credited Galliford with inspiring hundreds of female police officers to join it. Catherine Galliford has a son with fellow RCMP officer Darren Campbell. This information was released when the son, Connor Campbell, was arrested in September 2015 along with two others for the murder of 19-year old Langley resident Nicholas Hannon."

He was born in Ottawa, the son of Frank Beard, and, at the age of 17, served two years aboard the British Merchant Training ship Conway. He then served aboard several Canadian fisheries patrol vessels. In 1909, Beard joined the Royal Naval Reserve and, in 1910, the Royal Canadian Navy. He served as senior naval officer at Esquimalt and as Commanding Officer and as Commander of the Dockyard at Naden. In October 1915, he married Kathleen Kent. He served as commander of Maritime Forces Pacific in 1922. At the start of World War II, Beard came out of retirement to command HMCS Prince Robert, which captured the German merchant freighter Weser off the coast of Mexico. He later retired due to poor health. His son Midshipman Thomas Norman Kemp Beard was killed on HMS Hood during its encounter with the German battleship Bismarck in May 1941. Beard was a member of the Liberal-Conservative coalition in the provincial assembly. He died in office at Esquimalt and was buried with full military honours."

Rankin, a co-founder of the Metropolitan Street Railroad horsecars in Atlanta.The company became one of the wealthiest patent medicine concerns in the country, and S. S.

The rights of the characters had been taken up by Disney, who threatened to sue them if they didn’t cut out Miss Piggy and Kermit. Disney said that they were submitting scripts for Muppet shows to Disney, Promoter, Paul Bridson said this was not the case. After two shows in Irvine and Stirling Disney lawyers discovered that they asked the estate of Jim Henson, the late Muppet creator, last September for permission but were told the rights had been sold to Disney and were misled. They case was closed but Fletcher still cut out Kermit and Miss Piggy, he said “'It's just a frog and a pig but we can't afford to take on Disney.”"

Subsequently, he opened a sanatorium in Durtol for treating patients with tuberculosis and pulmonary tuberculosis. He was first physician to provide a comprehensive description of nodular regenerative hyperplasia of the liver. In French medical literature the eponym Cirrhose alcoolo-tuberculeuse de Hutinel et Sabourin is used to describe hypertrophic fatty cirrhosis of the liver of alcoholic or tuberculous origin. It is named along with physician Victor Henri Hutinel (1849–1933). Today, the Hôpital-sanatorium Sabourin, north of Clermont-Ferrand, is named in his honour."

He visited Norway, the North Cape, Sweden, Iceland, and England. One of his best paintings is in the Modern Gallery at Munich; it represents a Forge by the side of a Waterfall. He died at Munich in 1851. His younger brother Christian Friedrich Ezdorf (1807-1858) was also a landscape painter. He was educated in art at the Munich Academy, and at first practised porcelain painting, but afterwards devoted himself to landscapes, in which he followed much the same style as his brother, producing forest scenes, rooky valleys, and winter pieces. After his brother's death he returned for a while to Pösneck, but afterwards took to the business of tanning, and settled first in Kissingen and finally in Würzburg, where he died in 1858. Besides his paintings he has left eighteen etchings of landscapes, mostly after his brother, and one lithograph."

  "text" : "Charles I, Duke of Mecklenburg[-Güstrow] (28 December 1540 in Neustadt – 22 July 1610 in Güstrow), was the reigning Duke of Mecklenburg in the Mecklenburg-Güstrow part of the country. He was the youngest son of the Duke Albert VII and his wife, Anna of Brandenburg. Between 1564 and 1610, Charles was administrator of the commandry of the Order of Saint John at Mirow. After the deaths of his elder brothers John Albert I in 1576 and Ulrich in 1603, he became the ruling Duke of Mecklenburg-Güstrow from 14 March 1603 until his death. He also acted as guardian and regent for his grandnephews John Albert II and Adolf Frederick I, who had inherited Mecklenburg-Schwerin from John Albert I in 1576. Between 1592 and 1610, he was also administrator of the Bishopric of Ratzeburg. When in 1603 John VII of Mecklenburg-Schwerin died, Charles I tasked John's widow, Sophia of Schleswig-Holstein-Gottorp with the guardianship and regency of Mecklenburg-Schwerin on behalf of her minor sons Adolf Frederick I and John Albert II. In 1608, Charles asked the emperor to declare Adolf Frederick I an adult."

He married her, after the death of his second wife, Countess Emilie of Reichenbach-Lessonitz, on 28 August 1843 in Wilhelmsbad (now part of Hanau). This was a morganatic marriage, because she was considered lesser nobility and therefore not befitting for a sovereign Elector. Caroline was the daughter of Baron Hermann Ludwig of Berlepsch and Melusine of Kruse and 43 years younger than her husband. The couple's main residence was Frankfurt, since the elector had in 1830 and virtually abdicated the government to his son, Frederick William I, from his first, non-morganatic, marriage. In 1844, the Elector of rose Caroline to \"Baroness of Bergen\" and in 1846, she received the Austrian title of \"Countess of Bergen\". After William died in 1847, she married again, in 1851 in Frankfurt, with Count Charles Adolph of Hohenthal (born: 27 November 1811 in Dölkau; died: 9 October 1875 in Knauthain). With him, she had two sons: Charles Adolph (b. 1853) and Charles Louis (b. 1857)."

  "text" : "Charles Turner Howard (1832–1885) was an American businessman notable for organizing the Louisiana State Lottery Company in 1869. This corporation bribed Louisiana lawmakers to enable it to stay in business, and the firm amassed a considerable fortune over the years while Howard led a controversial life. He died at age 53 after a fall off of a carriage in Dobbs Ferry, New York, but his family continued his efforts at philanthropy and charitable giving. Howard was born in Baltimore and attended college in this city. He moved south, and worked as a newsdealer and then later as a lottery and policy dealer. When the Civil War broke out, Howard's business dealings were described as \"obscure\" according to a report in the New York Times. At a later point in his life, he claimed to have been a soldier for the confederate side for Tennessee, but this was subsequently disproven. In 1866, he was hired by the Kentucky lottery firm of C. H. Murray & Company to apply for a lottery charter in Louisiana from the state legislature. This effort failed, but after two years, a second attempt succeeded, partially as a result of bribery of key lawmakers in Louisiana. Howard was given $50,000 to apply for a charter and when the legislative grant came through, he refused to turn the charter over to his employers. A member of the firm of C. H. Murray & Co. named Marcus Cicero Stanley filed suit against Howard for being refused his \"just share of the profits\". The suit alleged that Howard had bribed a \"large number of legislators\" as well as an ex-Governor of Louisiana. But the lawsuit was dropped because it was decided that, given the nature of the gambling business, that the parties had no legal standing to enforce the contract. The Louisiana Lottery Company gave Howard and his partners profits of 50%, and business began in January 1869. Howard used monies from the lottery to help win favor with the state legislature. In less than a year the company was enabled to put under its control the Legislature and the politics of the entire State. Its paid agents were on the floor of the Legislature not only as lobbyists, but as members of both houses. More than one Governor of the State acknowledged its sway, and the Mayor of the capital city of Baton Rouge was one of its regular agents for the sale of tickets.— The New York Times Howard and his partners were adept at using money and influence to keep the lottery going and profitable. At one point, a state Constitutional Convention was about to be passed which would have outlawed the lottery, but \"false pretenses, bribery and coercion\" were used to ensure that any new constitution did not exclude the lottery. At one point, a Louisiana judge made some \"extraneous remarks\" which had \"no legal value\" which said that the new Louisiana Constitution had \"legalized\" the Louisiana Lottery, and Howard made sure not to appeal this decision. During its heyday, the firm divided about $2 million annually among stockholders, including Howard, as well as pay for the numerous bribes for public officials. Howard built a beautiful house on St. Charles Street in New Orleans with a garden described as the \"finest in the city.\" He had a second home in Dobbs Ferry, a suburb of New York City. He acquired a reputation for giving generously to the city's charitable institutions. While he was a social climber, he did not respond kindly to snubs, and he \"got even\" with groups and organizations which had excluded him, such as the Metairie Jockey Club and the La Varietes Club, by waiting patiently, buying up the properties at propitious times, and casting out the snubbers. A noted instance of the manner in which he got even with those who refused to associate with him was afforded in his treatment of the Metairie Jockey Club. He sought an entrance in the company of this association, whose race course was the most noted in the South. The club, however, refused to admit him, and he swore that he would buy out their course and turn it into a graveyard. he bided his time, and when the opportunity came he did according to his oath. The beautiful Metairie Cemetery took the place of the Metairie race course, and a new course was established by Howard in its stead.— Report in the New York Times, 1885 Howard was involved in controversy on several occasions. When a serious fever struck New Orleans in 1878, one report suggested that Howard has not contributed any monies to a relief effort. In 1879, he was arrested in New York City for starting lottery agencies to sell shares or tickets of the Louisiana State Lottery. A detective charged that he had been selling lottery tickets which had been against the laws of New York State at the time. There was no record of Howard having spent any time in jail, but he was reported to own an interest in a sugar plantation, own a \"stud of horses\", have financial interests in two New Orleans newspapers, and at one point aspired to the office of Governor of Louisiana. Howard died in a carriage accident in 1885 when he was thrown from the vehicle and severely injured. Howard's son, Frank T. Howard, continued in the lottery business and amassed fortunes, according to one account, with revenues of $4,000,000 a month reported, with about 60% of that being paid out in the form of prizes. Howard's daughter, Annie Howard, along with her brothers helped to build the Howard Memorial Library as well as the Louisiana Historical Annex, which has a collection of Confederate archives, including the private and state papers of southern president Jefferson Davis."

He held a bachelor's degree in political science and a master's degree in communications from Canadian universities. President Martelly appointed Henriquez as his Minister of Culture and Communication in 2011.

Henriquez was initially hospitalized at Canape Vert Hospital before being transferred to Canada for treatment. He died at Ottawa Civic Hospital in Ottawa, Canada, from a cerebral hemorrhage on November 11, 2011, at the age of 51. Henriquez had suffered from hypertension and diabetes. President Martelly released a statement stating, \"With the early departure of the holder of Culture and Communication, the country loses a son animated by the desire to support the new government on the path of change as desired by the people of Haiti.\" Pierre-Raymond Dumas, a journalist and writer, was nominated by the INITE political party and approved by President Martelly, as Henriquez's successor."

Charles of Brandenburg-Schwedt joined the Prussian Army at an early age and distinguished himself during the First Silesian War at the capture of Głogów, at the Battle of Mollwitz and the Battle of Chotusitz. He took command in Upper Silesia in the spring of 1745, to the special satisfaction of his cousin, King Frederick II of Prussia. During the Seven Years' War Margrave Charles again held independent commands, as Frederick II had confidence in him, and he distinguished himself at the Battle of Hochkirch and the Battle of Torgau. In both battles, as at Mollwitz, he was wounded. The General German Biography (ADB) describes him as a noble, philanthropic character and lover of the arts and sciences. For 31 years he governed the knights, the Bailiwick of Brandenburg, and its fiefs as Grand Master of the Order of St. John, having been installed at Sonnenburg in 1731."

She was the second counselor to general president Louie B. Felt from 1880 to 1895. Clara Moses was born in Westfield, Massachusetts. She was a Mormon pioneer and in 1846 took the six-month journey on the ship Brooklyn from New York City to San Francisco via Cape Horn and the Sandwich Islands. Instead of traveling on to Utah Territory, she settled in San Francisco. In 1859, she married William H. Mason; they had two children. William Mason died in 1868. Clara moved to Salt Lake City and in 1875 she became a plural wife of Angus M. Cannon, who would later be prosecuted for unlawful cohabitation under the Edmunds Act; the case of Cannon v. United States eventually went to the United States Supreme Court. Clara and Angus Cannon had three children together. Prior to her service in the general Primary presidency, Clara Cannon was a counselor in the presidencies of the Primary and Relief Society in the Salt Lake Stake of the LDS Church. When Louie B. Felt became the first general presidency of the Primary, Matilda M. Barratt and Cannon were selected as Felt's counselors. Cannon was a counselor until 1895; the next year she was succeeded in the position by Josephine R. West."

He was apparently an illegitimate son of Charles I, Duke of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel, who was adopted into the Pincier von Königstein family, known as von Pincier in German and Swedish, or de Pincier in French. They were members of the Swedish nobility. Throughout his military career in German-speaking regiments, he used the surname von Pincier, but, later, in Canada, he adopted a French version of his surname, altering the spelling to de Pencier. He left many descendants in Canada. Some became prominent: and include an Anglican archbishop, The Most Rev. Dr Adam de Pencier, and that prelate's grandson, Michael de Pencier, a decorated Canadian publisher, entrepreneur, and environmental conservationist. Family members continue to spell the surname, de Pencier or dePencier."

  "text" : "Charles Alfred \"Charlie\" Crofts (11 July 1871 – 25 March 1950) was an Australian trade unionist. Born at Bethnal Green in England to general dealer James Crofts and Ann Rebecca, née Luxton, Crofts entered the workforce at the age of twelve, leaving school to work in a sheet metal factory and joining the Tinsmiths, Braziers and Gas Meter Makers' Society of London. He married Agnes Humphreys at Bethnal Green on 6 August 1893. He and his family moved to Melbourne in 1898, where Crofts became a member of the Sheet Metal Workers' Union (SMWU), serving as vice-president (1907) and president (1908–09). In 1911 he was on the first executive of the Federated Gas Employees' Industrial Union and in 1914 was elected to the SMWU's national executive. He defied his employer, the Metropolitan Gas Company, to attend a union meeting in Sydney in 1914 and was subsequently dismissed, but soon after won the position of secretary to the Gas Employees' Union, a paid position, winning the national secretaryship two months later. Crofts, an activist president, served on the Melbourne Trades Hall Council's executive and was its president from 1924 to 1925. He was secretary of the Commonwealth Council of Federated Unions from 1923 to 1927 and was first secretary of the Australian Council of Trade Unions in 1927, a position he held until 1943. In 19430 he was the Australian delegate to the Fourteenth Session of the International Labour Conference in Geneva, the International Federation of Trade Unions' Fifth Annual Congress in Stockholm, and the British Commonwealth Labour Conference in London; he also served as a deputy on the board of the International Labour Organization. A leading workers' advocate during the Depression, he retired from the secretaryship in 1943 to concentrate on his presidency of the Gas Employees' Union. Crofts was also active in the Australian Labor Party, serving as a Victorian executive member and Federal conference delegate and being president (1926–27) and treasurer (1942–44) of the Victorian branch. He ran unsuccessfully for the Senate in 1934. He was frequently an advocate in the Arbitration Court. Identified as a moderate within the Labor movement, Crofts was a firm anti-communist but identified as a socialist. He died at Caulfield in 1950 and was cremated."

  "text" : "Count Walter Butler was a member of the Butler family of Ormond who emigrated to Germany early in the 1600s with his brother, James. According to the Compendium of Irish Biography, both entered the Imperial service, and \"Both obtained command of regiments, and served with distinction under Tilly and Wallenstein in many of the actions of the Thirty Years' War. When it became evident to Walter that Wallenstein was turning traitor to the Emperor, and going over to the enemy, he conspired with several other officers, and caused the assassination of that great commander, at Egra, on 25th February 1634. For this crime he was created a Count of the Empire, and large estates in Bohemia, still held by his descendants, were settled on him. Mr. F. Prendergast, who gives an exhaustive account of the transaction, thus apologises for him: \"This deed of Walter Butler may have prevented a train of consequences the most momentous; and if the manner of executing it forbids us to call the act, with Carve, heroic, the circumstances, as now stated, will, I trust, go far to relieve Butler's character from the infamy which has hitherto rested upon it, and to exhibit him in the light of an officer impelled by a stern sense of duty, in a critical hour, to use the best and only means remaining to him to protect his sovereign's crown.\" He died in Wirtemberg shortly after the battle of Nordlingen, at which he distinguished himself, in September 1634, and was buried with great pomp at Prague. He or his brother left a bequest to found a college of Irish Franciscans in that city.\""

Her call to service in India fell from a need to have a female physician provide quality medical care to high-caste women, that were religiously secluded to zenana. Supported by the Women's Foreign Missionary Society of the Methodist Episcopal Church, Swain left the United States in 1869, for Bareilly, India, where she spent the next twenty-seven years of her life treating women and children from illnesses, while simultaneously working to evangelize natives. By the end of her first year in Bareilly, Swain had acquired seventeen medical students, clinically trained under her supervision, and had treated at minimum, 1,300 patients. Within the next four years, she helped establish the first hospital in India for women and children."

  "text" : "Caldwell Hart Colt (November 24, 1858 – January 21, 1894) was an American inventor and yachtsman. He was born in Hartford, Connecticut, the son of Samuel Colt, founder of Colt's Patent Fire-Arms Manufacturing Company (now known as Colt's Manufacturing Company) and Elizabeth Jarvis Colt. Caldwell Colt attended Yale University and was known later in life for being a yachtsman. He served as vice-commodore of the New York Yacht Club in 1888 and commodore of the Larchmont Yacht Club from 1892–1893. Following in his father's footsteps as a gun maker, in 1879 he designed the Colt double barrel rifle. This rifle was chambered in .45-70 Government and is one of the rarest Colt firearms that was ever made. Colt drowned at sea at the age of 35 near Punta Gorda, Florida while piloting his ship, The Dauntless. His mother had a parish house built near Armsmear in his name opposite the Church of the Good Shepherd. The building was designed by Edward Tuckerman Potter who designed the earlier church on the site. The Church of the Good Shepherd and Parish House is listed in the National Register of Historic Places."

He was the second biggest film star in the world in the years leading up to World War I, just behind his rival Max Linder. Prince's \"Rigadin\" character was similar to Linder's \"Max\" in that they were both upper-class dandys that were constantly getting into trouble with authority figures and love interests. Prince began his acting career on the stage and was hired by Pathé Frères in 1908. He made over 200 films as \"Rigadin\" from 1909 until 1920. By 1920 his popularity had faded and he played supporting roles in a handful of films in the 1920s and 1930s."

  "text" : "Caroline Emily Clark (6 September 1825 – 18 November 1911), invariably known as Emily Clark, was a South Australian social reformer well known for championing the cause of children in institutions and founding the \"boarding-out system\" for settling orphan children with foster families in Adelaide. She was born in Birmingham, the eldest of the family of Francis Clark, a silversmith of Birmingham, and his wife Caroline, a sister of Rowland Hill. The family settled in Adelaide, South Australia in 1850. A delicate child with poor eyesight, she was an apt and industrious student like her brother Howard. In 1837 she was sent to stay with her grandmother Hill in Tottenham, half a mile from Bruce Castle, to study at \"Miss Woods School\" in a nearby town, perhaps Upper Clapton. Around 1840 scarlet fever struck the family and Emily was left with rheumatism in her hands. In 1863, shortly after the death of brother Howard's wife Lucy, Emily joined him in his newly built \"Hazelwood Cottage\" (a few hundred metres from the original \"Hazelwood Homestead\") to care for his three young children: Frank, Nellie and new-born Lucy, and stayed there until Howard's marriage to Agnes McNee in 1865."

  "text" : "Charles L. “Pie” Dufour (1903-1996) was an American newspaper journalist, historian, humorist, and book author from New Orleans, Louisiana who served as a columnist for the New Orleans States-Item newspaper. He wrote approximately 9700 installments of his column “Pie Dufour’s A La Mode” for the States-Item and for the Sunday edition of the New Orleans Times-Picayune during his newspaper tenure, from 1949 until his retirement in 1978. He authored 20 books and approximately 50 articles for scholarly literature. Dufour’s column covered diverse topics including Louisiana history, New Orleans Mardi Gras, law, local sports, classical music, New Orleans cuisine, and European travel. Dufour lived his entire life in New Orleans, except to serve in the US Army in World War II in a non-journalistic role. He enrolled at Tulane University for college in 1921, although he commenced his career with newspapers before completing his degree. He ultimately completed his college degree in 1953. Dufour was awarded an honorary doctorate of humane letters by Tulane University in 1978, after retiring as a newspaper columnist. Together with fellow local historian John Churchill Chase, he taught a course on New Orleans history at Tulane University for 25 years. Dufour referred to this course as \"New Orleans on the Half Shell\" as an acknowledgement of its emphasis on food and culture. Dufour was a member of the gourmet group in New Orleans called \"La Societe des Escargots Orleanais\". A 1967 New York Times article characterized Dufour as a columnist and historian \"who has devoted most of his professional life to the idea that history is news\"."

In December 1445 she went to Nantes, where her husband organized wedding celebrations in her honor. Then she lived in Parthenay and travelled only in 1457 with her husband again to Brittany, because his nephew, the duke Peter II, had fallen ill. After Peter’s death (22 September 1457) Arthur III became new Duke and therefore his wife Catherine briefly Duchess consort of Brittany, but Arthur already died on 26 December 1458 at Nantes at the age of 65 years. His marriage with Catherine had remained childless. Catherine lived as widow a secluded life, probably died in March 1492 and was buried in the Carthusian monastery of Nantes, which she had finished."

  "text" : "Charles Rochussen (Kralingen, August 1, 1814 – Rotterdam September 22, 1894) was a 19th-century painter from Rotterdam, the Netherlands, who was also known as an illustrator and printmaker. Charles was the second son of the wealthy businessman and art collector Hendrik Rochussen (1779–1852), who was himself an amateur draftsman of some distinction and owned an extensive art and history library. His brother Henri Rochussen (1812–89) became a painter. While still a child, Charles showed a talent for drawing; between 1831 and 1834 he produced watercolor studies of birds. However, it was decided that he would pursue a career in business. He worked for a few years in an office before resolving at the age of 22 to turn to painting. In 1837 he enrolled at the academy in The Hague, where he was taught by Wijnand Nuijen (1813–39) and, after Nuyen's death, by Anthonie Waldorp (1803–66). During his Hague period, which lasted until 1843 (or, according to some sources, 1846), he painted landscapes and beach and village views. From 1849 to 1869 he lived in Amsterdam and thereafter in Rotterdam. He started painting looser, more along the lines of the upcoming Impressionism movement."

  "text" : "Cynthia F. Cooley (born July 17, 1931) is an award-winning Pittsburgh artist. She was born Cynthia Jean Furber in Minneapolis, Minnesota. She graduated Phi Beta Kappa from Lawrence University, which honored her with the 1997 Distinguished Career Achievement Award. She also studied at the Boston Museum of Fine Arts School and the Minneapolis College of Art and Design. She is married to professor emeritus William W. Cooley. Cooley is best known for her vivid paintings of steel mill interiors and of Pittsburgh's hillside neighborhoods and industrial valleys. She says she was “originally drawn to the powerful geometric forms of the working mills.” She also has captured another of western Pennsylvania’s industries in her series of coal mine paintings. She works mostly in acrylic and watercolors to create memorable works from her own on-site sketches and photographs. As a lifelong traveler, Cooley’s paintings also reflect the many places she has visited, ranging from her watercolors of Giverny to her acrylics of doorways in Tunisia. In 1989, she accompanied the American Wind Symphony Orchestra as the artist-in-residence as they sailed on the waterways of northern Europe. Cooley has had over 45 individual exhibitions in 8 states, including one at the National Academy of Sciences in Washington, D.C., and has received over 25 awards in group exhibitions. In 1989, she won Artist of the Year at the Pittsburgh Center for the Arts. She was named a \"Master Artist\" in Pittsburgh in 1998. In 2003, Cooley was one of the selected artists who participated in the DinoMite Days event sponsored by the Carnegie Museum of Natural History. In honor of Pittsburgh’s “historical connection to dinosaurs and to world-class scientific research,” Cooley transformed a Stegosaurus sculpture into a cityscape tribute to her hometown of Pittsburgh. Her dinosaur, which was displayed outdoors to the public, was named “Troyus Hillosaurus,” and displayed a view of Troy Hill from downtown Pittsburgh on one side, and a view of downtown from Troy Hill on the other. Over 1,860 of Cooley’s works are in private collections, and over 90 are in public and corporate collections, including: \n* Carnegie Museum of Art \n* Pennsylvania State Museum \n* Westmoreland Museum of American Art \n* Butler Institute of American Art \n* University of Pittsburgh \n* Senator John Heinz Pittsburgh Regional History Center \n* Pennsylvania State University Earth & Mineral Sciences Museum \n* Pittsburgh Public Schools \n* The Duquesne Club"

  "text" : "Carlos Javier Benielli (March 26, 1878, Mendoza – Nov. 4, 1934, Buenos Aires) was an Argentine writer, poet and educator. He penned the lyrics for marches and hymns that are dedicated to famous figures from Argentinian history, many of which have become part of that nation's common cultural heritage. Benielli studied teaching in Mendoza. In 1897, he became a professor at the Escuela Normal de Profesores \"Mariano Acosta\" in the Balvanera district of Buenos Aires. Later, he was posted to a teaching position in Venado Tuerto, Santa Fe Province. While there, he made friends with Cayetano Alberto Silva, a violinist and composer. As a result, in April 1907 he wrote the lyrics to the San Lorenzo March (composed by Silva in 1901). This march (his most famous work), commemorates the Battle of San Lorenzo and memorializes the heroic actions of sergeant Juan Bautista Cabral. He also wrote lyrics for marches commemorating the battles of Tuyutí and Curupaytí (both also with music by Silva) and the Hymn to San Martín (set to the music of the Triumphal March from the opera \"Aida\" by Verdi). He is also the author of a book; Menudencias Lingüísticas (Linguistic Trifles). Benielli dedicated 43 years of his life to teaching. He was the founding director of Escuela 22, located at Calle Sánchez de Bustamante 260 (Buenos Aires). In 1969, the school was named in his honor. Escuela 6392 (founded in 1953) in the Bouchard district of San Lorenzo, on National Route 11, also bears his name. He died in Buenos Aires in 1934. In 2005, his remains were transferred to the cemetery at the Convent of San Lorenzo, where the Regiment of Mounted Grenadiers performs an annual ceremony in his honor."

  "text" : "Charles (Carl) Frederick Voegelin (or C. F. Voegelin) (January 14, 1906 – May 22, 1986) was an American linguist and anthropologist. He was one of the leading authorities on Indigenous languages of North America, specifically the Algonquian and Uto-Aztecan languages. He published many influential works on Delaware, Shawnee, Hopi and the Tübatulabal languages. He was president of the Linguistic Society of America in 1954, and he revived the journal International Journal of American Linguistics after the death of its first editor Franz Boas in 1944. Born in New York, he entered Stanford University and received a BA in Psychology, after which he traveled to New Zealand to study Maori music. Then he decided to study anthropology at Berkeley University where he was trained by Alfred Kroeber, Robert Lowie and Melville Jacobs writing his dissertation as a grammar of Tübatulabal. At first he had great difficulties hearing the phonetic distinctions of the language, but in 1931 he went to the field with Danish linguist Hans Jørgen Uldall who taught him to recognize all the phonetic contrasts. He went on to do postdoctoral work in linguistics at Yale University with Edward Sapir, and then he taught at DePauw University, before joining Indiana University Bloomington in 1941 as that university's first professor of anthropology. His proficiency in Indigenous languages became so good that he was able to correspond with Leonard Bloomfield in Ojibwe, letters later published in the journal Anthropological linguistics.He was first married to ethnologist Erminie Wheeler-Voegelin, with whom he conducted fieldwork. Later he married linguist Florence M. Voegelin, his erstwhile graduate student at Indiana. During his tenure at Indiana he managed the United States' largest Army Specialized Training Program in foreign languages. Among his graduate students at Indiana were Ken Hale and Dell Hymes. Later he was at the University of Hawai'i, before returning to Indiana as an emeritus professor. His collection of papers are held by the American Philosophical Society In 1975, several of Voegelin's colleagues and former students collaborated on the festschrift Linguistics and Anthropology: In Honor of C. F. Voegelin."

  "text" : "Catherine D. Chatterley (born in Winnipeg, MB, Canada) is a historian, specializing in the study of modern European history, the Holocaust, and research on antisemitism, and is the founding director of the Canadian Institute for the Study of Antisemitism (CISA). Chatterley is Editor-in-Chief of Antisemitism Studies, a journal devoted to the study of antisemitism published by Indiana University Press. Chatterley appeared in the documentary called \"Unmasked: Judeophobia\" (2011), where she was one of the scholars interviewed. That same year, she was invited as an expert scholar to participate in the Canadian All-Party Parliamentary Inquiry into Antisemitism, which produced the Ottawa Protocol. Chatterley also teaches history at the University of Manitoba. Her undergraduate studies included European history and Near Eastern and Judaic Studies at the University of Manitoba, European Intellectual History at Concordia University (Montreal), followed by a doctorate in Modern European and Jewish History, and German-Jewish Literature, which she completed at The University of Chicago. Syracuse University Press published her first book, Disenchantment: George Steiner and the Meaning of Western Civilization After Auschwitz, in their series on Religion, Theology, and the Holocaust, edited by Steven T. Katz. Disenchantment was named a 2011 National Jewish Book Award Finalist in the category of Modern Jewish Thought and Experience. Alongside Juan Asensio in France and Ricardo Gil Soeiro in Portugal, Chatterley is recognized as the leading North American scholar of George Steiner, an internationally renowned cultural critic, and has published two chapters in international collections about his work, both edited by Ricardo Gil Soeiro. As the founding director of CISA, Catherine Chatterley was invited to be a member of the official government delegation to Israel in January 2014."

He was made serjeant-at-law on 27 November 1787, and held for a time the office of deputy-judge of the Marshalsea Court. On 27 May 1815 he was appointed to the chief-commissionership in insolvency, which he resigned in 1819. He died at Brighton on 18 January 1821. Runnington married twice—in 1777, Anna Maria, youngest sister of Sir Samuel Shepherd, by whom he had a son and a daughter; secondly, in 1783, Mrs. Wetherell, widow of Charles Wetherell of Jamaica. His only son, Charles Henry Runnington, died on 20 November 1810. Runnington, besides editing certain well-known legal works by Sir Geoffrey Gilbert, Sir Matthew Hale and Owen Ruffhead was author of A Treatise on the Action of Ejectment (founded on Gilbert's work), London, 1781, 8vo, which was recast and revised as The History, Principles, and Practice of the Legal Remedy by Ejectment, and the resulting Action for Mesne Profits (London, 1795, 8vo; 2nd ed.) published by William Ballantine in 1820."

  "text" : "Clarence Elkins Sr. (born 1963) is an American man who was wrongfully convicted of the 1998 rape and murder of his mother-in-law, Judith Johnson, Melinda Elkins's mother, and the rape and assault of his niece, Brooke. He was convicted solely on the basis of testimony of his 6-year-old niece who testified that Elkins was the perpetrator. Brooke later voiced doubts about her identification, claiming that in her initial statement when she said \"He looked like uncle Clarence\", she simply meant that he reminded her of Elkins as opposed to being a positive identification and that she only identified him in her testimony because Summit County Prosecutor Maureen O'Connor (now Chief Justice of the Ohio Supreme Court) and Lead prosecutor Michael Carroll urged her to. Brooke recanted her statement and Elkins appealed on that basis, but his appeal was denied. The family finally raised funding to test DNA found at the scene and he was excluded. Once again, his appeal was denied. The judge ruled that because the jury convicted Elkins without the DNA results, it was likely that he would have been convicted even if the DNA did not match. Elkins wife, Melinda, conducted her own investigation. She eventually identified Johnson's next door neighbor, Earl Mann, a convicted sex offender, as a likely suspect. Elkins collected a cigarette butt from Mann, who was serving time at the same prison, and Mann was found to be a match. Elkins was finally exonerated after serving 6.5 years in prison. Elkins now works as an advocate to halt wrongful convictions and was instrumental in getting Ohio to pass Senate Bill 77, also known as Ohio's Innocence Protection Act. This bill contains provisions requiring the police to follow best practices for eyewitness identifications, provides incentives for the videotaping of interrogations, and requires that DNA be preserved in homicide and sexual assault cases. A 2009 documentary was made about the case titled Conviction: The True Story of Clarence Elkins."

  "text" : "Chaim Walder (born 1969) is an Israeli Haredi rabbi and author of literature for children, adolescents, and adults. In 1993, he became an Israeli publishing sensation with his first book, Yeladim Mesaprim al Atzmam (Hebrew: ילדים מספרים על עצמם‎‎, Children Talk About Themselves, translated into English as Kids Speak), which revolutionized literature for Haredi children by introducing young protagonists who speak openly about their problems and feelings. Yeladim Mesaprim al Atzmam became one of the top five bestselling books of all time in Israel, and opened the door for many more writers to produce original fiction for Haredi youth. Walder is also a long-time columnist on social issues for the Hebrew daily Yated Ne'eman, an educational counselor, and manager of the Center for the Child and Family, operated by the Bnei Brak municipality."

  "text" : "Cecil John Doty (1907–1990) was an American architect, notable for planning a consistent architectural framework for the U.S. National Park Service's ambitious Mission 66 program in the 1950s and 1960s. Doty spent his childhood in May, Oklahoma, then attended Oklahoma A&M (now Oklahoma State University), and received a degree in architectural engineering in 1928. During the Great Depression that immediately followed Doty's graduation, Doty found intermittent work, but was unable to establish a business in Oklahoma City. In order to make a living, Doty signed up with the Civilian Conservation Corps, first as a file clerk, then as an architect in the state parks program. Doty was hired by Park Service design director Herbert Maier to complete plans for a museum building at Glacier National Park, and absorbed Maier's style by studying the design guidelines issued by Maier, which contained prototype designs executed by Maier and Park Service staff for national and state parks. By January 1935, Doty was promoted to associate engineer and given responsibility, together with landscape architect Harry Cornell, for the state parks of Kansas and Oklahoma. The next year he became regional architect, and in 1937 moved to Santa Fe, New Mexico to work with Maier at the new regional office, where he took up work on national park structures. Doty designed his new workplace, the Santa Fe Regional Office, while still in Oklahoma, completing the design after moving to Santa Fe. Doty moved to the San Francisco Office in 1940, where he took on work for the new White Sands National Monument. During World War II Doty worked on major war effort projects like the Alcan Highway and Shasta Dam. Following the war in 1946 he became the Park Service's regional architect in 1948. He designed the lodge at Hurricane Ridge in Olympic National Park and the Joshua Tree National Park administration building. In 1954 Doty joined the Western Office of Design and Construction, where he assumed a leadership role in the Mission 66 project. Doty spent some of his post-Mission 66 time with the park service on projects at the National Mall in Washington. retiring in 1968. He lived in Walnut Creek, California in the 1980s."

  "text" : "C. V. Ananda Bose is an Indian civil servant who served in the Indian Administrative Service. He is notable for not yielding to the corrupt system of the Indian bureaucracy. An eminent administrator, writer, orator and innovator, Dr C. V. Ananda Bose pioneered pathbreaking administrative innovations in rural development, affordable housing, eco-tourism development, redressal of public grievances, women's empowerment, development of weaker sections of society and promotion of art and culture. The innovations have found expression in various developmental programmes that have been executed at the district, state and national levels in India. It was in the area of low cost housing that Dr Bose pioneered a movement that won international acclaim. He set up the first Nirmithi Kendra (Building Centre) in the country in the Kollam district which became the institutional mechanism for the propagation of cost-effective, environment-friendly (CEEF) building technology. This was positively evaluated by the Department of Administrative Reforms and Public Grievances, Government of India (1993). Based on the Kollam model, the Government of India launched the National Building Centre Movement to replicate Nirmithi Kendras (Building Centres) in every district of the country. The Nirmithi Movement was adjudged by the United Nations as one of the Global Best Practices in the field of sustainable human settlement development. Early in his career, Dr Bose introduced the 'Gramotsava' programme in Kerala wherein the local people were encouraged to actively participate in the village development planning. The initiative, launched in the Kasargode district of Kerala in the 1980s, was subsequently implemented in 200 panchayats across the state. Dr Bose also founded The District Tourism Promotion Council (DTPC) in the Kollam district during his tenure as Collector. The Council generated high tourism interest in the region and created new job opportunities for the local people. The Government of Kerala subsequently set up similar councils in all 14 districts of the state. DTPCs have made perceptible contributions in positioning Kerala as 'God's Own Country'. He later pioneered an Eco-Village Programme in the Mannanan Village of the Kottayam district of Kerala wherein the family clusters were encouraged to pursue activities such as organic farming, soil and water conservation through traditional methods, floriculture, horticulture, vermiculture, generation of energy from non-conventional source, homestead forestry, etc., with institutional support, governmental assistance and financial support from different agencies. As Chairman of the Atomic Energy Education Society, Mumbai, Dr Bose introduced and reinforced the concept of alternative education wherein people could pursue studies in disciplines in which they did not have prior academic background. He founded the Institute of Alternative Education. He also launched the ASTER Project (Application of Science & Technology in Educational Reforms) which sought to alter the mode of academic delivery through the application of Information and Communication Technology (ICT). As managing director of Nafed, Dr Bose initiated a few innovative programmes which helped control the price spiral during 2009–10. Christened as 'Farm Gate to Home Gate', this innovation sought to buy agricultural produce directly from the farmers for distribution among the consumers taking only marginal profit. Spurred by the success of this pilot programme in New Delhi, the Easy Market Scheme was envisaged for price control in the rest of the country. As the Administrator of the National Museum, Dr Bose launched a 100-day programme which spelt out specific measures to revamp and revitalise the institution. Most of the improvements suggested were achieved in 60 days, such as opening the closed down galleries, modernising the display and lighting, launching outreach programmes to take the Museum to the community, arranging children's programme to ignite young minds to the greatness of India's national heritage, organising international exhibitions and launching the People's Museum Movement, to mention a few. Pursuit of excellence was always central to Dr Bose's role in public administration. His contributions were seldom circumscribed by the call of duty. Instead, he has been engaged in continuous research and field experimentation in developing the most appropriate, people-first solutions. He also took key steps to synergise the various government programmes and schemes to create comprehensive, sustainable and inclusive administrative mechanisms that have since been replicated in multiple domains. In recognition of this remarkable turnaround of the Museum management and the perceptible makeover of the institution, Government of India asked Dr Bose to continue with this mission even after his retirement from service."

As its editor-in-chief, he became known for his wit and sharp-tongued remarks; he ruthlessly derided key contemporary political figures as \"clerical lutefisk\" and \"royal stable jacks\". In the 1884 impeachment case against Prime Minister Christian August Selmer, Friele sided with Selmer, and retreated from his position as editor of Morgenbladet following the court's verdict. Firmly believing that orders of merit would compromise his integrity as editor, he twice declined the offer of being rewarded the Order of St. Olav."

Anstey previously held the post of World Bank Vice President of External Affairs, after earlier being appointed in September 2007 and serving for three years as chief of staff by then World Bank President Robert B. Zoellick, his first high-level appointment after taking over the presidency in July that year. Anstey also served as World Bank Sherpa to the G20. During her previous role as the World Bank’s country director for the Caribbean, Anstey was successful in raising funds for Haiti's reconstruction as donors prepared to re-engage in 2004 after former president Jean-Bertrand Aristide went into exile. She also played a key role, as acknowledged by regional leaders, in the setting up of an innovative regional disaster insurance scheme for Caribbean states, to give governments immediate access to funds after hurricanes and earthquakes. In July 2013, the World Bank's President, Jim Yong Kim, announced that, as part of a larger management reshuffle, Anstey would leave the Bank's employment following the Annual Meetings in the Fall of the year."

  "text" : "Carl Kiefert (c.1855–1937) was a composer and conductor, who spent much of his career conducting at the Hippodrome and other London theatres. He was the musical director of the original London productions of such musical theatre pieces as His Excellency (1894), An Artist's Model (1895), Florodora (1899) and The Quaker Girl (1910). He wrote songs, arranged dance music from shows and wrote or co-wrote the scores to several London musicals, including The Ballet Girl (1897) and The Gay Grisette (1898). He orchestrated several West End musicals early in the 20th century, especially those of Lionel Monckton, and later several Broadway musicals, including Honeydew (1920) and The Chiffon Girl (1924). \"His acknowledged expertise and speed at instrumentation made Kiefert the most sought-after arranger of theatre scores and he regularly orchestrated for Lionel Monckton and Osmond Carr.\""

  "text" : "Catherine Trianon, née Boule, called La Trianon (1627 - 6 May 1681), was a French fortune teller and poisoner, one of the accused in the famous Poison Affair. She was actively involved in the attempted assassination of king Louis XIV of France in 1679. Catherine Trianon was a widow and fortune teller. She was one of the most important associates, as well as a personal friend and confidante, of La Voisin. She managed her business with her partner, La Doddée, who was also her lover in a homosexual relationship. Trianon was described by her colleagues as very well educated. Her reception room contained a human skeleton, officially said to be there as a pious reminder of mortality. In 1679 Madame de Montespan commissioned La Voisin to murder king Louis XIV of France. It was at the home of Trianon that La Voisin conspired with the help of her lovers, Bertrand and Romani. Trianon tried to convince La Voisin to abandon the plan, even making up a horoscope to warn her that it would be a mistake, but did not succeed. The group decided that the king should be poisoned by a petition. La Voisin's failed first attempt failed on the 5th of March; she planned to meet with Trianon on the 12th of March to plan the next attempt, but she was arrested. Voisin's arrest was followed by that of Trianon in May. Upon her arrest, authorities found 25 \"manuscript volumes on the occult sciences\" in her house. In August 1680, after the execution of La Voisin in February, the connection between La Voisin, Montespan, and the plan to assassinate the king was revealed by her daughter, Marguerite Monvoisin, who on October 9th also confirmed the statements made by Adam Lesage in August of child sacrifice at the black masses. After her statements about Montespan and child sacrifice were confirmed by Francoise Filastre on October 1st and Etienne Guibourg on October 10th, Trianon, who had been personally involved in the attempt, also confirmed the statement. Catherine Trianon committed suicide in Château de Vincennes."

Hinde served in executive leadership positions in the river navigation, shipping, railroad, and hotel businesses. By his late forties, Hinde had already amassed a great fortune from his work in the steamboat and railroad industries. In the late 1880s Hinde was invited to San Diego by his close friend E. S. Babcock to invest in and run several businesses, including the Hotel del Coronado and the Spreckels Brothers Commercial Company with John D. Spreckels. Hinde vastly increased his personal fortune during his time in southern California, and he helped spur the economy of the region. Towards the end of his life he donated much of his wealth to further various projects in the Californian city of Coronado and its surrounding area, some dedicated to the memory of his daughter Camilla, who died in Evansville, Indiana, at the age of 13."

Later he worked with Bernardino Campi, for example in the Transfiguration (1565) in the church of San Fedele in Milan. The canvas of Doubting Thomas is found in the Pinacoteca di Brera. He painted in the Chapel of the Angels in Sant'Eustorgio, a Pentecost in the church of San Marco.

  "text" : "Colin James Lawson CBE FRCM FRNCM FLCM Hon RAM (born 24 July 1949) is an English clarinettist, scholar and broadcaster. He was born in Saltburn-by-the-Sea and educated at Bradford Grammar School. A pupil of Thea King, Lawson was a member of the National Youth Orchestra of Great Britain during his teenage years. He subsequently read music at Keble College, Oxford. Postgraduate studies in music at the University of Birmingham saw Lawson awarded an MA in 1972 for his study of the clarinet in eighteenth-century repertoire. His pioneering doctoral research into the chalumeau was completed at the University of Aberdeen in 1976. In 2000, in recognition of his work across theory and practice, Lawson received a DMus from the University of London. In 2015, celebrating Lawson's pre-eminence in performance studies, the University of Sheffield awarded him an HonDMus. Following academic positions in Aberdeen and Sheffield, Lawson was appointed to the Chair of Performance Studies at Goldsmiths, University of London in 1998. Between 2001 and 2005 he was Pro-Vice Chancellor and Dean of the London College of Music & Media at Thames Valley University (now the University of West London). In July 2005 he became Director of the Royal College of Music, London, where he holds a Personal Chair in Historical Performance. Lawson is internationally recognised as a performer of chalumeaux and historical clarinets, having held principal positions with leading British period orchestras, notably The Hanover Band, The English Concert and the London Classical Players, with whom he recorded extensively and toured world-wide. Described as 'a brilliant, absolutely world-class player' (Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung) and ‘the doyen of period clarinettists’ (BBC Music Magazine), he has appeared as soloist in many international venues, including London's major concert halls and New York's Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts and Carnegie Hall. His extensive discography comprises concertos by Fasch, Hook, Mahon, Mozart, Spohr, Telemann, Vivaldi and Weber, as well as a considerable variety of chamber and orchestral music. Among recent recordings are two discs of sonatas by Xavier Lefèvre and a highly acclaimed CD of the Mozart Clarinet Quintet and other fragments. Lawson has an especially close association with Mozart’s Clarinet Concerto K622, which he performs regularly on both modern and historical instruments. In addition to directing performances of the work, he has played it in collaboration with conductors such as Roy Goodman, Christopher Hogwood, Roger Norrington and Joshua Rifkin. Lawson’s Cambridge Handbook to Mozart’s Clarinet Concerto (1996) examines the work’s genesis, composition and construction, as well as the career of the dedicatee Anton Stadler and his innovative basset clarinet. His first monograph, The Chalumeau in Eighteenth-Century Music, was published in 1981 by UMI Research Press, and remains the most extensive study of the instrument and its repertoire. Amongst later publications for Cambridge University Press are The Cambridge Companion to the Clarinet (1995), a Cambridge Handbook to Brahms’s Clarinet Quintet (1998) and The Cambridge Companion to the Orchestra (2003). With Robin Stowell he initiated the series of Cambridge Handbooks to the Historical Performance of Music, including their joint introductory volume (1999) as well as his own volume on the early clarinet (2000). A further publication by Lawson and Stowell, The Cambridge History of Musical Performance, appeared in February 2012. In the Queen's 2016 Birthday Honours Lawson was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) for services to music and music education."

  "text" : "Sir Christopher Rawlinson (1806–1888), was a colonial judge who was Chief Justice of Madras. Rawlinson was born at Combe on 10 July 1806, the second son of John Rawlinson (d. 1847) of Combe and Alresford, Hampshire, by his wife Felicia (Watson). He was educated at the Charterhouse and at Trinity College, Cambridge (B.A. 1828, M.A. 1831). Called to the bar at the Middle Temple in 1831, he joined the western circuit in 1832, and was recorder of Portsmouth from 1840 to 1847, when he was appointed recorder of Prince of Wales Island, Singapore, and Malacca. In 1847 he was knighted. In 1849 he was appointed Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Judicature at Madras, and held that position till his retirement in 1859. In his charge to the grand jury on 5 January 1859 he expressed the belief that great benefits would accrue from the recent transfer of the government of India from the East India Company to the Crown, and refuted the assertion then commonly made by English officials in India, that no materials for self-government existed in the country. On 9 February 1859 he was presented with a farewell address by the native community of Madras at an entertainment at which the governor, Lord Harris, was present. In 1842 he published a work on \"The Municipal Practices Act\". He died at 33 Eaton Square, London, on 28 March 1888. On 27 May 1847 he had married Georgina Maria, younger daughter of Alexander Radclyffe Sidebottom, barrister, by whom he had three sons—Christopher (b. 1850), Albemarle Alexander, late major 8th hussars, John Frederick Peel—and one daughter."

  "text" : "Curt Teichert (May 8, 1905 in Königsberg, East Prussia – May 10, 1996 in Arlington, Virginia) was a German-American palaeontologist and geologist, noted for his contributions to geology, paleozoic stratigraphy and paleontology, Cephalopoda, ancient and modern reefs, and correlation, the matching of strata of the same age in different locations. He studied geology at universities in Munich, Freiburg and Königsberg, receiving his Ph.D. degree from Albertus University in Königsberg in 1928. The same year he married Gertrud Kaufmann, daughter of Walter Kaufmann, a physics professor in Königsberg, and sister to Rudolf Kaufmann, the tragically short-lived palaeontologist. He was appointed as assistant at Freiburg from where he went to Washington to study cephalopods on a one-year Rockefeller Foundation award in 1930. In 1931-32 he took part as geologist in a Danish expedition to Greenland. With the rise of the Nazi Party in Germany in the 1930s, he was advised by the University to divorce his wife as she had a Jewish ancestry. The couple hastily left for Copenhagen in 1933, and eked out a living there for the next four years. A Carnegie Foundation grant in 1937 enabled the Teicherts to settle in Australia where Curt had been offered a position at the University of Western Australia in Perth. Here he was the only palaeontologist in a vast and unexplored fossil-rich area. With the outbreak of World War II the Teicherts were interned by the authorities, and were later offered a trip back to Germany in exchange for Australian prisoners of war, an offer which was politely declined. The position as research lecturer at Perth lasted from 1937 to 1945. During the war years he investigated reefs from a naval shipping point of view, and was a consultant to Caltex Oil in their search for oil in western Australia. After the War he became assistant chief geologist in the Mines Department of Victoria until 1947, and lastly senior lecturer at the University of Melbourne until 1952. In 1949 Raymond C. Moore of the University of Kansas had asked Teichert to assist in compiling a volume on the Cephalopoda for the Treatise on Invertebrate Paleontology (1953–1981). A Fulbright Fellowship allowed Teichert to go on a fifty-university tour in 1951–52 to interview potential contributors to this volume. In 1952 Teichert started work at the New Mexico School of Mines in Socorro where he studied the local Devonian age rocks, his paper being published by the U.S. Geological Survey. In 1954 he joined the USGS, setting up a laboratory and the necessary infrastructure at the Denver Federal Center. He also found time to return to Germany as guest professor of the universities of Bonn, Freiberg, and Göttingen. The success of the Denver laboratory led to Teichert's transferring to Quetta in Pakistan in 1961, where an International Development-USGS project was improving the minerals and exploration mapping. Teichert's part in the program was a detailed study of the Permian-Triassic boundary in the Salt Range. He helped develop a National Stratigraphic Code for Pakistan, leading to stratigraphic correlations among Pakistan, Iran, and Turkey, all members of the Central Treaty Organization. When the Pakistan project was wrapped up in 1964, Teichert became Regents’ Professor at the University of Kansas. During this period he edited seven volumes of the Treatise on Invertebrate Paleontology. He left the University of Kansas in 1977 for the University of Rochester in New York where he stayed until 1993. He leftRochester in 1995, two years after his wife's death, and moved to Arlington in Virginia to close out his final years near many of his friends and former associates. During his career Teichert served on the faculties of seven universities on three continents. He was co-editor of the Treatise on Invertebrate Paleontology from 1964 to 1979, president of the Paleontological Society in 1971–72, and president of the International Paleontological Association between 1976 and 1980. His major moves were from Europe to Australia in 1937, and Australia to the US in 1952. The Curt Teichert Festschrift (Ellis Yochelson, Wolfgang Struve, editor, Senckenbergiana Lethaea, v. 69, 628 p., 1988/1989) describes his many notable contributions to palaeontology. He authored or co-authored more than 325 papers during his lifetime."

  "text" : "Cruz Obiang Ebele is an Equatoguinean political activist currently imprisoned on weapons possession charges. His imprisonment drew protest from the US State Department and Amnesty International, the latter of which designated him a prisoner of conscience. Ebele was active with the Progress Party of Equatorial Guinea (PPGE), a banned political party opposing the long-dominant Democratic Party of Equatorial Guinea. He had previously worked that the Moroccan embassy in Malabo, but had been dismissed from the job. On 10 April 2008, he was arrested without a warrant at his brother's house in Malabo. Within a week, fellow PPGE activists Emiliano Esono Michá, Gumersindo Ramírez Faustino, Juan Ecomo Ndong, Gerardo Angüe Mangue, and Bonifacio Nguema Ndong were also arrested. Ebele was held for a month at the police station, stating later that he was tortured there by beatings and electric shocks; he also was allegedly hung by his feet from the ceiling. In May 2008, the six men were charged with knowledge of a weapons cache in the home of another PPGE activist, Saturnino Ncogo. Ncogo had died in prison on early March in suspicious circumstances. Authorities alleged he had thrown himself from the top bunk of his cell to commit suicide, but relatives received his body in an advanced state of decomposition, and no investigation was ever conducted.According to Amnesty International, the six men were given an unfair trial at which no evidence was presented save the weapons from Ncogo's home and the statements the six had made under duress; in addition, the six defendants alleged that police had altered their statements after the defendants had signed them. Despite being charged with unrelated crimes, the six were tried alongside Simon Mann, a UK national who had helped to organize a 2004 coup attempt. The six PPGE members were given sentences of one to five years apiece. The US State Department considers Ebele a political prisoner, and objected to his continued imprisonment. Amnesty International named him a prisoner of conscience and called for his immediate release."

The original work was long thought to be completely lost, however fragments constituting about one-fifth of the original were found among the manuscripts found at Dunhuang, with fifty-five poems by thirteen men. One notable feature of this anthology is that Cui Rong arranged the work in descending order of official rank of the included poets; which, among other things, highlights the nature of early Tang poetry as a type of court poetry."

In 1989, she painted a mural with the artist Rupert Till, decorating the construction work at 4 Millbank during its redevelopment by the Swedish developers Nisses Millbank. Parish was the winner of a competition to select the best design for the 160 foot mural which faced the Houses of Parliament and was unveiled by Lord St John of Fawsley on 13 July 1989.

A railway worker and union representative by trade, he got involved in the civil rights movement in Birmingham, Alabama in the mid 1950s, working with Reverend Fred Shuttlesworth. He started a civil rights organization called the Civil Rights Guards that protected homes and business involved in the movement, usually while armed. Johnson was born in Lowndes County, Alabama to Fannie and Colonel Johnson. His family moved to Birmingham when he was 4. Graduating from Lincoln High School in 1939, he was hired at Louisville & Nashville Railroad Company, where he worked for nearly 40 years. He claimed to be the first black union representative for the company in Birmingham. Johnson may be best known for having helped to carry a Ku Klux Klan bomb away from Bethel Baptist Church in Birmingham, AL. He also provided armed protection to nonviolent activists in Anniston, Alabama during the 1961 Freedom Rides, rescuing them from a segregationist mob. He also served for a time as vice-president of the Birmingham chapter of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference. An oft-repeated remark of Johnson, when asked how he'd managed to protect civil rights leaders given his commitment to nonviolence, Johnson replied, \"With my nonviolent .38 special.\" In 2011, The city of Birmingham dedicated a street in his honor."

  "text" : "Calvin Ryder (1810-1890) was an American architect who practiced in Maine and Massachusetts. A number of his surviving buildings are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Ryder was born in Orrington, Maine, but by 1831 was residing in nearby Bangor, Maine with his brother Perry, a plane-maker. Within two years he had relocated a few miles down the Penobscot River to Winterport, Maine (then part of Frankfort), where he received his first known commission, the Winterport Congregational Church (1833). Ryder was likely the builder as well as the architect for this and other early commissions. In the early 1840s Ryder designed and built at least four Greek Revival houses in the port of Belfast, Maine, just south of Winterport: the Sherburne Sleeper House (1840), Hiram Alden House (1840), James P. White House (1842), and Joseph Williamson House (1844–45). The White House, the only one to remain entirely unaltered, has since become a famous coastal Maine icon, particularly for its glass cupola. Ryder was threatened with debtor’s prison in 1846 and relocated to Boston. In Boston, Ryder went into partnership with William Hovey, later with Enoch Fuller, and still later with Edward D. Harris. His major idiom in the 1850s-60s became the Mansard style, and he pioneered its use in a number of wooden mansions around Boston and Cambridge. A design for he sent back to Bangor, Maine for the William Blake House (1858), built by his sister and brother-in-law, established a look which came to define that city’s domestic architecture in the 1860s. His masterpiece in this idiom, the Charles G. Sterns House (1866) in Bangor, was unfortunately destroyed in the 1930s. Ryder died unexpectedly while visiting his sister and brother-in-law in Bangor (in their house of his design) and was buried in nearby Winterport, Maine."

  "text" : "C. Parker Crowell (1876 - 1959) was an American architect who practiced in the state of Maine. One of the first Maine architects to become a member of the American Institute of Architects (in 1931), Crowell and his firm would design over 1000 buildings in the course of his career, including many in his home city of Bangor, Maine. The firm Crowell co-founded is still in business as WBRC Architects. Crowell and John F. Thomas founded Thomas & Crowell in 1902 in Bangor. Walter Lancaster was later added as a partner. The Great Fire of 1911 destroyed half of the city’s downtown, including Crowell’s office, but the rebuilding also presented an unprecedented design opportunity (see Great Fire of 1911 Historic District). Crowell and his firm received a number of commissions in the burnt district, including the Eastern Trust Building (1912, extant). An earlier Crowell building, The Tarrantine Club, was among the significant downtown buildings to survive the fire. Crowell & Thomas also designed a number of the buildings for the University of Maine campus in Orono, Maine, including the Phi Gamma Delta House and Oak Hall. Crowell was a graduate of the same university (class of 1898). Other major commissions of the firm include the Oak Grove Seminary for Girls in Vassalboro, Maine and the Millinocket, Maine Hospital. Crowell served as Vice President of the Maine chapter of the AIA, and became a Fellow of the AIA in 1952. He retired in 1956 as the dean of Maine architects, and by 1970 his name had been dropped from the firm’s title. It would go through a number of additional name changes before becoming WBRC Architects & Engineers in 1989."

  "text" : "Charles Toucey Coiner (January 1, 1898, Santa Barbara, California – August 13, 1989, Mechanicsville, Bucks County, Pennsylvania) was an American painter and advertising art director. Born into a California farming family, Coiner attended the Chicago Academy of Fine Art and the Art Institute of Chicago, while also working at an advertising agency. He went to work for the Philadelphia-based N. W. Ayer & Son advertising agency, starting as a layout designer in 1924 and rising to vice president in charge of art in 1936. He was among the first in his field to commission modern artists. For example, for one of his early advertising campaigns, for the Container Corporation of America called \"Great Ideas of Western Man\", he incorporated works by such artists as Pablo Picasso, Georgia O'Keeffe and Salvador Dalí. He once sent O'Keefe to Hawaii for a campaign for canned pineapple juice. When \"she came back with all kinds of beautiful paintings but nothing to do with pineapple\", she explained that nobody had shown her any pineapple plants, so he sent her one, which she then painted. When the administrator of the National Recovery Act (NRA) was dissatisfied with designs presented by Ayer, Coiner himself designed the Blue Eagle symbol that is closely associated with the NRA. He also conceived the Red Feather emblem of the Community Chest. During World War II, he designed war and civil defense posters; an offset lithograph of one with the slogan \"Give It Your Best!\" (1942) for the Office of Emergency Management is in the collection of the Museum of Modern Art. Another of his works is the Boys Clubs of America commemorative stamp issued in 1960. One of Coiner's passions was painting, primarily landscapes, in a style he himself described as impressionist. The Whitney Museum, the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts and the Philadelphia Museum of Art exhibited his works. A 1966 self-portrait owned by the National Academy of Design is in the collection of the Smithsonian Institution. After he retired from Ayer in 1964, he became the first American given the Art Director's Award of Distinction, and was inducted into the Art Director's Hall of Fame in 1973 and the Philadelphia Advertising Hall of Fame in 1988.He was a trustee of the Philadelphia Museum of Art and chairman of the Philadelphia College of Art. In 1993, he was posthumously inducted into the Advertising Hall of Fame. He was also awarded the 2004 AIGA (American Institute of Graphic Arts) Medal. Coiner died on August 13, 1989, at the age of 91. He was survived by his wife, E. May Coiner (née Howe). A collection of his papers is held by the Syracuse University Library."

Bury was the only son of Charles Bury, 1st Earl of Charleville, by Catherine Maria Dawson, daughter of Thomas Townley Dawson. He was educated at Eton and served as High Sheriff of King's County in 1825. In 1826 he was returned to parliament for Carlow Borough, a seat controlled by the family. The constituency was abolished in the Great Reform Act of 1832 and Bury's father launched an expensive campaign to keep his son in the House of Commons. He failed to be elected for King's County but was returned for Penryn and Falmouth in Cornwall, a seat he held until 1835. From 1834 to 1835 he also served as a Lord of the Bedchamber to King William IV. He succeeded his father in the earldom in 1835. This was an Irish peerage and did not entitle him to an automatic seat in the House of Lords. However, in 1838 he was elected an Irish Representative Peer. Lord Charleville was also an advocate of homeopathy. He was a friend of Frederic Hervey Foster Quin, the first homeopathic physician in England, and also of the French artist and dandy Alfred d'Orsay. Charleville came increasingly into debt and was forced to sell off major parts of the family estates during the economic crisis in Ireland in the mid-1840s and eventually settled in Berlin. In 1821 in Florence, Lord Charleville married Harriet Charlotte Beaujolais Campbell, daughter of Colonel John Campbell of Shawfield and Islay and Lady Charlotte Bury, and sister of Walter Frederick Campbell. They had three sons and a daughter. Lady Charleville was a minor author. She died in Naples in February 1848, aged 46. Lord Charleville died in July 1851, aged 50, and was succeeded by his eldest son, Charles."

  "text" : "Carina Isabel Vance Mafla (born 1977) is a former Minister for Public Health of Ecuador. Vance was born in Oakland, California. She went to high school in Ecuador and attended university in the United States. After attending Williams College for her undergraduate degree and earning a master's degree in public health from the University of California, Berkeley, she returned to Ecuador in 2004. Vance is openly lesbian. She spent time in Europe as a girl, where, at the age of thirteen, she and her first girlfriend were attacked by homophobic youths. Vance had already begun to understand and accept her identity as a lesbian, but said that this incident \"was not only a discovery of my homosexuality, but also society's reaction to it.\" She subsequently worked as a lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) rights activist and was the executive director of Fundacion Causana, a lesbian rights organization. Vance was appointed to the Cabinet by President Rafael Correa in January 2012, after her predecessor David Chiriboga resigned amid concerns that he was unable to fix the problems in Ecuador's national healthcare system. Vance announced her intent to shut down a system of religious \"clinics\" which said they could \"cure\" gays and particularly lesbians of their homosexuality and which had been reported to torture inmates physically and psychologically and to hold them against their will. Fundacion Causana had been working to close these sorts of institutions for ten years. When a network of almost 200 such illegal \"clinics\" was discovered four years earlier, Vance's organization and other LGBT rights and progressive organizations pressured Correa's government to shut them down. This led to the closure of thirty such clinics in September 2011 and a plan, presented by Chiriboga before his resignation, to continue the work. Soon after Vance was appointed to the Cabinet, the ministry raided three of the \"torture clinics\" near Quito and rescued dozens of women. She also discussed plans to reform the administration of the country's hospitals."

  "text" : "Carol Wax (born June 17, 1953) is an American artist and author whom the New York Times called \"a virtuoso printmaker and art historian\" for her work in mezzotint and her writings on the history and technique of that medium. She has described her work: My images of commonplace objects reflect my personal experience of the ordinary as extraordinary. Most people rarely think about the \"stuff\" in our lives but, to me, even the most ordinary items seem magical. I often depict old instruments, mechanical devices, and fabric because their repetitive patterns create rhythms of light, shadow, and forms that can be manipulated to convey my phantasmagorical perceptions. The ability to achieve dramatic lighting effects through the mezzotint engraving process makes it the ideal medium for rendering my imagery. Although my style may be categorized as representational in the nature morte tradition, to me, still-life does not mean dead weight. By portraying my subjects transcending their status as lifeless objects I strive to depict the anima in the inanimate."

  "text" : "Charlie Williams (born January 5, Seoul, Korea ) is a Korean American promoter and TV producer. He started his company Dragon Promotions in 2001, and for nearly 14 years has been one of the leading producers and pioneers in the sporting side of the billiard industry. A professional pool player himself, Williams is also known as a world class pool champion, still ranked in the top 10 in the United States, despite his majority focus on his productions. Williams is also a sports writer with a monthly column and professional coach and manager of top billiard professionals including Allison Fisher, Yu Ram Cha, Shanelle Loraine, Rodney Morris, and Eunji Erica Park. Most recently Williams has turned his attention to other industries including football (soccer) and produced a highly successful match between Philippines and South Korea. Williams has produced over 200 events worldwide, and has been the only billiards producer to successfully create international televised events in Korea, China, Philippines, and the United States. Williams has at times been a subject of controversy. In 2001 he was elected President of the United States Professional Poolplayers Association (UPA) which attempted to boycott the US Open 9-Ball Championship for reducing its prize fund at the event and not paying the top finishers. His role as top ranked player, promoter, and pro tour association president seemed a conflict of interest to some, and as the youngest president of any US billiards pro association in history, many questioned his ability to lead.Williams also has come under fire for his professional play of representing USA in world sanctioned events, and at time for South Korea in invitational exhibition events. Most recently at the annual USA vs Europe Mosconi Cup, he was selected as the USA captain, which had some fans and industry peers object to. Williams was successful in negotiating TV contracts with ESPN for the UPA as well as successfully signing on a full season of tour stops for the players, and left the men's tour presidency when his term was finished, adhering to the promises he kept to the public that he would not want to continue in that role and recognizing the conflict of interests. Williams went on to continue growing his company and partnered later with Cindy Lee, a Chicago-based entrepreneur who he made CEO of his company. Dragon Promotions went on to develop events and TV contracts with a dozen TV networks. The team has been successful in staging large and historic events in the sport with high TV ratings. Williams and his team has also been a part of many charity productions including for the benefits of the Boys & Girls Club, Police Athletic League, the Red Cross and raised $50,000 in one night for the Typhoon Sendong Victims in the Philippines. Williams also produced the Typhoon Haiyan Tennis Tournament which raised money for victims in Asia. Williams and his company Dragon Promotions was selected as the #2 Most Influential Entity in the Sport by a worldwide vote of industry leaders and media. Williams is the Chief Marketing Officer for www.Realrealcool.com and Orlando Synergy. Today Williams also continues producing and promoting events in other sports and industries such as tennis, MMA, golf, and special events as the Executive Producer at Dragon Promotions."

  "text" : "Chris Field is a Los Angeles-based singer/songwriter, composer, and musician. He was raised in the San Fernando Valley, and played guitar in Los Angeles for groups among multiple genres including electric guitar, jazz, and rock music. He learned how to compose music by inputting compositions from Ludwig van Beethoven and Sergei Prokofiev into his computer. Through his music associates, he became acquainted with two friends who started X-Ray Dog, and he began to contribute musical compositions to this company. Field also works with Extreme Music, and through them, Field's music has been placed in numerous television shows. In December 2014, a part of Field's catalogue was acquired by BMG Chrysalis. Chris Field is the writer of the composition, \"Gothic Power\", which developed an international cult following. Field's work as a musical composer for movie theatrical trailers has included Alice In Wonderland, X-Men, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, XXX, Austin Powers in Goldmember, Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines, Hotel Rwanda, Kinsey, Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl, Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest, and The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring. His first contribution to a film trailer was for the The Full Monty. \"Gothic Power\" was the main theme for the trailer for The Lord of the Rings film series; this was later used as a trailer for a film within a film in a sequence for Ben Stiller's movie Tropic Thunder. In 2014, Field's piece \"Acts of Courage\" was released on the album, This Is Epic Music, Volume I, through Imperativa Records, on iTunes and physical cd. The album notes state that the piece \"Gothic Power\", written by Field in 1999, started a new direction in cinematic music that came to be identified as epic music. Field released his second album \"Personal Elegy\", a rock album, in 2015. The title track is an elegy for the passing of actor Heath Ledger. Field released his debut album, Sub-Conscious, in 2006; it was made available on iTunes, CD Baby, Amazon.com, and for retail sale.

  "text" : "Camille Delezenne (10 June 1868 – 7 July 1932) was a French physician and biologist born in Genech, a town in the department of Nord. He studied medicine in Lille, obtaining his hospital internship in 1890. In 1892 he supported his doctorate with a dissertation on parapneumonic pleurisy. Afterwards he undertook experiments on blood circulation at the Wertheimer laboratory in Lille. During this time period, he also served as mayor of Genech (1893-95). In 1896 he was appointed associate professor of physiology at the University of Montpellier. At Edouard Hédon's laboratory he conducted systematic investigations of blood coagulation in vertebrates, demonstrating the hepatic origin of antithrombin and describing the blood coagulation system of birds. In 1900 he relocated to Paris, where he worked as a lecturer in the laboratory of physiological chemistry at the Ecole des Hautes Etudes. With assistance from Emile Duclaux (1840-1904) and Elie Metchnikoff (1845-1916), he was appointed head of the physiology laboratory at the Pasteur Institute, where his primary focus was research of enzymes, venoms and toxins. In 1902 he demonstrated a link between the action of enterokinase in mobilizing pancreatic digestive enzymes and the phenomena of hemolysis. He also showed that certain microbial cultures, snake venoms, and some plants and poisonous mushrooms have diastases that act on the pancreatic juice in the same way as does enterokinase. In 1902 Delezenne became a member of the Société de biologie, in 1903 he was co-founder of the Bulletin de l'Institut Pasteur with Amédée Borrel (1867-1936), Félix Mesnil (1868-1938), Gabriel Bertrand (1867–1962), Alexandre Besredka (1870–1940) and Auguste-Charles Marie (1864-1935), and in 1910 became a professor at the Pasteur Institute. In 1912 he was elected as a member of the Académie Nationale de Médecine, and in 1929 became a member of the Assemblée de l'Institut Pasteur."

He was born in Kentish Town, Middlesex, England on 30 September 1843, but educated in Melbourne, Australia, where he got a BA and an LLB from University of Melbourne. He then went to St John's College, Cambridge, initially to train for the English Bar but became interested in mathematics. In 1874, a year before being due to be called to the bar, Cook was appointed founding head of mathematics at Canterbury College, University of New Zealand (now Canterbury University). He joined co-founders John Macmillan Brown and Alexander Bickerton in Christchurch, New Zealand and initially focused on Latin and mathematics. He was also involved in promoting the establishment of the University's engineering school. He is remembered primarily for his teaching; Nobel Prize-winning physicist Ernest Rutherford cited him as an influence: Cook was evidently a sound mathematician and an excellent teacher along orthodox lines, with no marked tendency to stray from those lines. He was involved in secondary education, acting as an examiner for the New Zealand Department of Education and holding a fellowship at the Anglican Christ's College, Christchurch from 1891 to 1908. Cook was a member of the Royal Commission on Higher Education 1878–1800 and a member of the senate of the University of New Zealand. In 1903, Cook appeared in the vanity press The Cyclopedia of New Zealand, with a photo and short article. He died in Marton, New Zealand on 21 May 1910."

  "text" : "Charles Blomfield (5 January 1848–15 March 1926) was a New Zealand decorator, artist and music teacher. He was born in London, England on 5 January 1848. A widow, Blomfield's mother brought her family to New Zealand intending to settle in Northland as part of a settlement called Albertland. On arrival in Auckland they decided not to proceed on Northland to become farmers but to pursue urban trades in Auckland. The family remained in Auckland after that and many of the descendants of the various children still reside in the Auckland area. Charles Blomfield lived in Freeman's Bay - 40 Wood Street, in a house built by his brother and allegedly made out of the timber from one large Kauri tree. As well as an exhibiting easel painter Blomfield worked as a sign-writer and interior decorator; for this trade he maintained studios in shops at various times. These were usually on Karangahape Road, one of these was shared with his daughter who made a living painting floral pieces which she also exhibited at the Auckland Society of Arts. Blomfield travelled throughout the centre of the North Island on several occasions in the 1870s and 80s creating many landscape paintings of the New Zealand countryside, often for sale to visitors to New Zealand. He was fortunate to view the famed Pink and White Terraces several times and paint them before they were destroyed by the eruption of Tarawera in 1886. His meticulous sketches and finished paintings are some of the main records of them. For the remainder of his life he was probably able to rely on new versions of his classic views of them to supplement his income. His paintings are widely regarded as the epitome of 19th century New Zealand landscape art, although his work, like many of his contemporaries, fell out of fashion during the 20th century, only to be re-evaluated in the 1970s. He was unable to come to terms with developments in art and remained staunchly conservative and hostile to 'modern art'. In his later years he found himself increasingly sidelined by the artistic circles in Auckland which he had previously shone in and was probably embittered by this. Blomfield was an elder of the Baptist Church and partly responsible for the construction of the Auckland Baptist Tabernacle on the city's main thoroughfare Queen street, which when it opened in 1886 was the largest building in the city and also contained the largest room.The ceiling of the auditorium of the Tabernacle is decorated with stencil work carried out by Charles and his brother Samuel.He died at his residence in Wood Street in 1926. He was survived by several children. One of his brothers, William, was a noted newspaper cartoonist."

He emigrated with his family to New Zealand, arriving in Wellington in August 1849. His wife was a cousin of Judge Henry Samuel Chapman, and it was Chapman who encouraged the emigration, lending the Barrauds a cottage when they arrived, and in which they lived until their own house had been built. Barraud quickly set up shop in Lambton Quay as a pharmacist. At the same time he soon gained recognition as an artist, at this point regarded as an \"enthusiastic amateur\", and working mostly in watercolours. He painted the children of Henry William Petre in 1850, but the visiting Charlotte Godley, who wanted a portrait of her son Arthur, was scathing of his talent: There is a chemist here who has lately turned artist, and who has perpetrated a few likenesses, very like, but very bad... If it were likely to be tolerable I should so like to have Arthur done, but I am afraid it would be only a disappointment."

  "text" : "Cy A Adler (b. Cyrus Adler, 1927, Brooklyn, NY) is an author and conservationist, known for his work over the course of several decades in raising awareness for shoreline issues in and around New York City, United States, and especially for his early work on the initiative that would result in the creation of The Great Saunter, an annual walk which goes through Hudson River Park and around the island of Manhattan. For his effort to see to completion a park stretching almost the entire circumference of the Hudson River shore of the island of Manhattan, Adler was recognized by Manhattan Borough President Scott Stringer, New York City Parks Commissioner Adrian Benepe, New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, and former US Senator Hillary Clinton. Trained as a Mathematician and Oceanographer, Adler taught physics at the City College of New York and oceanography at SUNY Maritime and Long Island University. He contributed to several scholarly publications in his field in the 1960s and 1970s, but his environmental advocacy work began in earnest after the 1973 publication of his first book, Ecological Fantasies - Death From Falling Watermelons: A Defense of Innovation, Science, and Rational Approaches to Environmental Problems, which had grown out of a series of somewhat contentious debates on environmental policy published in Science (journal) and The Village Voice in May and November 1972. By the late-1970s Adler's articles on shoreline issues had appeared in The Village Voice, as well as other local papers including The New York Times and Newsday. His science based letters and articles appeared in the American Journal of Physics (January 1958), Undersea Technology (August 1968), Journal of Ocean Technology V.2 No.1 (1967), Science and Technology (October 1969), Wall Street Journal (February 1971), Marine Engineering Log (March 1971), American Fish Farmer (August 1972), Science (November 1972), etc. In early December, 1982, Adler placed an ad in the Voice announcing a public walk along the Hudson River from Battery Park to Riverside Park, which at the time consisted largely of docking facilities abandoned due to Containerization. The walk, which served to raise awareness of the disused and inaccessible shoreline, became an annual event, and came to become known as The Great Saunter, eventually constituting a complete shoreline circumnavigation of the island of Manhattan. This walk developed into a non-profit group, Shorewalkers, of which Cy is still president. Shorewalkers was incorporated in 1984. In 1984 Adler wrote an article in The New York Times advocating a public shoreline path from the river's mouth at Battery Park to the river's source, Lake Tear of the Clouds in the Adirondack Mountains. Adler's third book, Walking The Hudson, Batt to Bear (From the Battery to Bear Mountain) detailed the route, as of 1997, as far as Bear Mountain (Hudson Highlands). A second edition, published by W. W. Norton & Company updated the route for 2012, and contains an introduction by folksinger Pete Seeger, a member of Shorewalkers and friend of Adler. Adler organized several New York State corporations including OFFSHORE SEA DEVELOPMENT CORP, est. 1972, where he and others developed systems for offloading oil tankers and aquaculture techniques. Several patents were issued to him, including one for a Single-Point Mooring, U. S. patent number 3.756.293."

He constructed a network of Swedish agents to work for French interests in Sweden, especially female agents, among them being Margareta Gyllenstierna - who also maintained a political correspondence with the queen of France, Marie Leszczyńska - Charlotta von Liewen and Hedvig Catharina Lillie. He also unsuccessfully attempted to recruit the kings mistress Hedvig Taube. He was called home on request by the Swedish government in 1737."

  "text" : "Caroline Carleton (6 October 1811 – 10 July 1874) was a South Australian poet, born in England, who is best known for her prize-winning poem Song of Australia, which, put to a tune by Carl Linger was used as a patriotic song in South Australian schools and elsewhere, and one of four in a national plebiscite to select a National Song in 1977. She was born Caroline Baynes, at Bonnar's Hall (also written Bonner's Hall), Middlesex near London, the youngest child of bookseller William Baynes (29 May 1760 – 7 January 1832) and his second wife Mary Ann (née Bailey) (1771–1862). Although her birthdate is generally given as 1820, this may have been a useful fiction, as baptism records give the 1811 date. She was highly intelligent and received a good education; she could converse in French and Italian, as well as being well-versed in Latin; she played pianoforte and harp. In 1836, at West Hackney (perhaps on York Road near modern Dalston?), she married Charles James Carleton (ca.1814 – 20 July 1861), a medical student working at Guy's Hospital and who could claim a family connection with the Earls of Dorchester. Together with their two young children they left for Australia in 1839, on the Prince Regent. It was a rough passage and both children died and were buried at sea. The passengers disembarked at Glenelg on 26 September 1839."

  "text" : "Catherine Healy is a New Zealand sex workers' rights activist, field researcher and former prostitute working for decriminalisation of prostitution and generally for the improvement of the sex work profession. She is the national coordinator and a founding member of the New Zealand Prostitutes' Collective (NZPC). She was employed as a primary school teacher, though in an interview by Joseph Romanos for The Dominion Post, Healy said, to increase her earnings for the purpose of travelling, she then worked in a massage parlor. In the 1980s, Healy worked in brothels and massage parlors. Healey and her fellow members of the NZPC initiated a campaign for decriminalisation of prostitution. Prostitution was finally decriminalised in New Zealand in 2003 after the implementation of the Prostitution Reform Act 2003. On 24 February 2010, Healy was invited by the Oxford Union at the University of Oxford to debate whether prostitution should be decriminalised. She became the second New Zealander after David Lange to be invited to debate at the university. At the university, she argued for decriminalisation of prostitution and won the debate. Healy has membership of various boards and committees. She has been invited as a speaker at the House of Commons of the United Kingdom and acts as an advisory on issues and policy formulations related to prostitution. The Prostitution Law Review Committee, a committee established by the New Zealand government, had Healy as one of its members. She has worked as a field researcher and has been involved with multiple research undertakings. She also works as a consultant for prostitutes of all gender, brothel owners and other persons involved in prostitution. With Gillian Abel and Lisa Fitzgerald, Healy has co-edited the book Taking the Crime Out of Sex Work: New Zealand Sex Workers' Fight for Decriminalisation. The book argues decriminalisation has resulted in better working condition for prostitutes. Healey lives in Eastbourne, New Zealand."

  "text" : "Chris Mosier is an American transgender advocate, triathlete, and speaker. He started his athletic career as a female, started his transition in 2010, and in 2015 earned a spot on the Team USA sprint duathlon men's team for the 2016 World Championship, making him the first known out trans athlete to join a U.S. national team different from his gender assigned at birth. While he qualified, Mosier was uncertain about his eligibility to compete in the Duathlon Age Group World Championship Race in Spain in June 2016 due to the International Olympic Committee policy around participation of transgender athletes, with specific provisions from the Stockholm Consensus in 2004. In 2015, Mosier challenged the policy, resulting in the creation and adoption of new IOC guidelines for participation of transgender athletes. As of January 2016, Mosier has not yet received clearance from the International Triathlon Union to compete in the World Championship race. Mosier began competing in triathlon in 2009 as female. In 2010, Mosier publicly self-identified as a transgender man in a leading American gay magazine, The Advocate, after competing in his first race as male. In 2011, Mosier was featured in The New York Times prior to competing in the Nautica New York City Triathlon, a race he competed in two years prior as female. In 2016, Mosier was chosen as the first openly transgender athlete to be featured in the \"Body Issue\" of ESPN The Magazine. He was also the first transgender athlete to feature on Nike's Advertisement."

Thomson is the elder daughter of Labour peer George Thomson, Baron Thomson of Monifieth. She was educated at Mary Datchelor Girls' School in Camberwell, a grammar school, and graduated from York University, where she read history and economics. She first joined the BBC as a journalist trainee in 1975, ultimately becoming a producer on Analysis (Radio 4) and later Panorama (BBC1) before becoming personal assistant to SDP leader Roy Jenkins in 1982. She spent over a decade at Channel 4 from 1984, initially as a commissioning editor, later as Head of Corporate Affairs from 1990, before rejoining the BBC in 1996 as Deputy Director of the World Service. She became the Corporation's Director of Policy and Legal Affairs in July 2000, a job description later expanded to include Strategy, before being promoted to chief operating officer in 2006. In 2011 she was paid £385,000 by the organisation. The Commons Public Accounts Committee suggested that her £670,000 redundancy pay-off was effectively paid to \"compensate\" her for missing out on the job of director-general. In October 2013 she became Executive Director of the English National Ballet Since November 2012, she has been Chair of Digital UK. She is also chair of Tomorrow's People Trust's Ambassadors group and Trustee to a number of charities including the National Gallery. Caroline Thomson is married to the Labour peer Roger Liddle, an advisor to Tony Blair while Blair was Prime Minister."

  "text" : "Charles Moore, 2nd Marquess of Drogheda (23 August 1770 – 6 February 1837), styled Viscount Moore until 1822, was an Irish peer. He went insane when he was about twenty, and spent much of his life at the private asylum at Greatford, Lincolnshire founded by the renowned physician Francis Willis. He was the eldest son of Charles Moore, 1st Marquess of Drogheda, and Lady Anne Seymour Conway, daughter of Francis Seymour, 1st Marquess of Hertford. Some sources give his first name as Edward. About the age of twenty he began to show signs of mental illness, which may have been hereditary. He was elected to the Irish House of Commons as member for Queen's County in 1790, but unseated the following year on foot of a petition that he was disqualified by reason of insanity. Despite this, he was given the rank of captain-lieutenant in the Royal Irish Artillery in 1793; Lord Moore's father was colonel of the regiment. He was placed in the care of Dr Francis Willis at Greatford Hall; Willis had won renown in 1788-9 for curing King George III of what was thought then to be insanity but is now thought to have been porphyria. His treatment involved a regimen of fresh air and manual labour. Whether the treatment had any success in Lord Drogheda's case is unclear, but certainly there was no full recovery as there had been in the case of the King; Drogheda remained at Greatford until his death in 1837. He was unmarried and his titles passed to his nephew Henry Moore, 3rd Marquess of Drogheda. The cause of his mental illness is unclear, but it may be significant that his mother's family had a history of eccentricity and mental instability. Lord Castlereagh, who committed suicide in 1822 was Lord Drogheda's first cousin and the increasingly strange behaviour which culminated in his death was thought by some to be due to a hereditary mental illness inherited from the Seymour Conway family, to which his mother, as well as Drogheda's, belonged."

In 1585-86, Domenico was nominated to be governor of the territory of Campagna, which now is mostly the province of Frosinone. Domenico was elected bishop of Manfredonia (1587-1600) in the consistery of 14 June 1587 held by Pope Sixtus V. In Manfredonia, he founded in 1592 the Monastery of St Clair and institutes a Seminary. He next served as Apostolic Nuncio to Spain. Pope Clement elevated him to Cardinal in 9 June 1604. It is said that Domenico ministered the viaticum to a dying Camillus de Lellis on 2 July 1614. Camillus was beatified in 1742. In 1630, Domenico reconstructed the medieval church of Santa Lucia alle Botteghe Oscure that stood nearby his family Palace in Central Rome. The church was decorated with canvases by his niece, Caterina Ginnasi. He died from an attack of gout, and was buried in this church."

  "text" : "James and John Chambers were early settlers in South Australia who left England in 1836, became wealthy pastoralists and were closely connected with John McDouall Stuart's expeditions across the continent of Australia. James and John, sons of William and Elizabeth (née Wilson) Chambers, their wives Catherine and Mary (who were sisters) and their young families were among the first colonists, James arriving on the Coromandel at Holdfast Bay on 17 January 1837. The plan had been that by leaving on an earlier ship James would arrive in plenty of time to organise accommodation for the rest of the family, but unfavourable winds forced the Coromandel to delay its departure until 9 September. The ship was further delayed at Cape Town, partly because insufficient and inferior food supplies had brought about so much illness that Captain William Chesser (died 14 February 1840) feared many passengers would die on the voyage. They arrived 17 January 1837, around two weeks late. The rest of the family, which included sister Priscilla Chambers had a trouble-free voyage in the James Renwick, arriving off Largs Bay on 10 February 1837. Catherine and Mary's brother James Redin also emigrated, arriving with his wife on the Navarino on 21 February 1856. Margaret Goyder Kerr, in her book Colonial Dynasty – the Chambers family of South Australia, makes the point that the two men were physically quite different, both in build and temperament, and John wore a green satin patch over his blind right eye, so would never be confused by contemporaries. The historian however has great difficulty: they both signed their names \"J. Chambers\" and were involved in similar (and often the same) activities so that it is difficult if not impossible at many points to determine which brother is involved."
