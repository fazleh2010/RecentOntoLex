  "text" : "Ali Abdulhadi Saleh Jafar Mushaima (Arabic: علي عبدالهادي صالح جعفر مشيمع‎‎) (26 August 1989 – 14 February 2011) was a 21-year-old Bahraini who on Monday 14 February 2011, the \"Bahraini Day of Rage\", became the first fatality of the Bahraini Uprising. He died on his way to hospital from injuries he received when he was hit in the back by birdshot pellets fired from close range (two to five meters) by security forces (riot police) during the Bahraini uprising (2011–present). According to Nabeel Rajab, head of Bahrain Centre for Human Rights, Mushaima was participating in a protest in Al Daih, in Manama's outskirt, when he was shot. In a rare televised speech the King of Bahrain, Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa, announced that the deaths of Ali Abdulhadi Mushaima and Fadhel Al-Matrook would be investigated. Bahrain's Interior Minister said that legal steps would be taken if the use of the weapon had been unwarranted. Details of the investigation were disclosed in the report of the Bahrain Independent Commission of Inquiry, established by King Hamad to look into events in the Bahraini uprising. The investigation failed to identify any culprits in the killing of Mushaima. The Commission concluded that Mushaima's death resulted from the \"use of excessive force by police officers,\" and \"that there was no justification for the use of lethal force.\""

  "text" : "David Burton-Richardson (born 1961) is a Welsh artist and poet. He has works in many public and private collections worldwide. The David Burton-Richardson Collection and Archive is housed at Scolton Manor museum near Haverfordwest, Pembrokeshire. The publication 'From Now to Zero' is housed within the library collections of the Tate Gallery, National Library of Wales and the Kohler Art Library, Wisconsin, USA. In more recent years he has been inspired by the Welsh Valleys, which inspire his abstract works. Upon the death of his grandfather,who left him his art materials, when the artist was 11 years old, Burton-Richardson started to paint in oils on a serious basis. To see that box of oil paints and brushes was like a child opening a box of sweets, he said. Having suffered anxiety, self-doubt and depression since childhood, Burton-Richardson has periods where he is unable to work. A culmination of illness led him to create what he called 'The Psychiatric Works', when a Psychologist urged him to paint the Demons within his mind. This collection of work was donated to Pembrokeshire MIND for permanent display within their building. The artist desired them to be displayed within an environment conducive to his state of mind when creating them. Early works were often urban landscapes and were signed 'D.B', 'David Burton' or just 'Burton', often followed by the year they were painted. Later works are signed 'dB.R and 'David Burton.R' on verso. Recent works have been more sombre and melancholic in colour and mood, with the emphasis being on the darker side of life. As in the words of the artist -- I am into infinity. Time and Space being infinite, endless. When you are dead time is infinite. Everything is black. Death is black. Black is the colour of death. \n* Elected full member of the National Acrylic Painters Association (NAPA), 2004. \n* Numerous one-man exhibitions, press, magazine and TV coverage. \n* Several one-man exhibitions held at Pontypool Museum and Art Gallery. \n* A retrospective exhibition was held at Scolton Manor museum in 2005. \n* David Burton-Richardson is listed in the publication 'Who's Who in Art', 'The Dictionary of International Biography', '2000 Outstanding Intellectuals of the 21st Century' and the 'Dictionary of International Biographies', Printed in the USA."

Bouncing Bomb released their album, Everything, on 28 November 2011. Recorded at Gravity Shack in London and engineered by Jessica Corcoran, Everything was mixed by Tim Palmer. The album was released on SEVAN SEVAN Music owned and run by longtime friend Stu Evans. In 2000, Worton took part in the Ned's Atomic Dustbin reunion, and continues to play with the band. In June 2006 they released their first single in eleven years, entitled \"Hibernation.\" On 12 May 2008, the band announced that the original lineup of Jonn, Rat, Matt, Alex, and Dan would be performing live together for the first time since 1995 on 6 December 2008 at the Astoria London. 2009 saw Ned's Atomic Dustbin playing two shows with the original line-up.

  "text" : "Daniel David Palmer or D.D. Palmer (March 7, 1845 – October 20, 1913) was the founder of chiropractic. Palmer was born in Pickering, Canada West (now Ontario) and was raised in the southern Ontario area, where he received his education. In 1865 Palmer moved to the United States, and around 1880 took up magnetic healing in Davenport, Iowa. After returning to Davenport, in 1895 Palmer met Harvey Lillard, a janitor whose hearing was impaired. Palmer claimed the man's hearing was restored after adjusting his spine. Palmer developed the theory that misalignment of the bones in the body was the basic underlying cause of all \"dis-ease\" and the majority of these mis-alignments were in the spinal column. In 1897 he opened the Palmer School of Chiropractic in Davenport and started teaching his techniques. Lawsuits followed, and after brief incarceration, Palmer sold the school to his son, B. J. Palmer. B. J. greatly expanded the school and the general knowledge of chiropractic. Palmer moved west, opening several new schools in Oklahoma, California, and Oregon. His relationship with his son was strained after this point. Palmer died in Los Angeles in 1913 of typhoid fever. His death has remained controversial due to the relationship with his son and the school he founded."

  "text" : "David M. Kennedy (born 1958) is a criminologist, professor, action researcher, and author specializing in crime prevention among inner city gangs, especially in the prevention of violent acts among street gangs. Kennedy developed the Operation Ceasefire group violence intervention in Boston, MA, in the 1990s and the High Point Model drug market intervention in High Point, NC, in 2003, which have proven to reduce violence and eliminate overt drug markets in jurisdictions around the United States. He founded the National Network for Safe Communities in 2009 to support cities using these and related strategies. He is the author of two books, Don't Shoot: One Man, A Street Fellowship, and the End of Violence in Inner-City America (2011), a popular treatment of his violence reduction work with street gangs, and Deterrence and Crime Prevention: Reconsidering the Prospect of Sanction (2008), a theoretical publication.

The 1974 European Athletics Championships saw him finish as runner-up in the individual event, but he was European champion in the relay with Great Britain. He also won a relay gold medal for Scotland at the 1978 Commonwealth Games, sharing in the 4×100 metres relay medals. He was later convicted for distribution of anabolic steroids. Following his release from jail he grew a legal fitness products enterprise in the form of NEXT Proteins. He also registered several patents around his invention of carbonated protein drinks.

  "text" : "Denis Julien (b. circa 1772) was an American fur trapper of French Huguenot origin who was active in the southwestern United States in the 1830s and 1840s, one of the few Europeans in the area at the time. He is principally known for his habit of leaving carved inscriptions in rock faces in Utah and Colorado on his travels, with at least eight such locations attributed to him, four of which are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Julien apparently lived in St. Louis in the 1790s. A child was born in 1793 to Julien and his native American wife Catherine in 1793, and three children were christened and one was buried between 1798 and 1809. Julien was mentioned in an 1808 letter by then-governor Meriwether Lewis to Secretary of War Henry Dearborn as an \"old and rispected [sic] trader among the Ioways.\" Julien and his brother were in the military in northern Louisiana in 1809. Denis witnessed the 1815 Iowa Treaty and traded on the upper Missouri River in 1816 and 1817. In this time he was connected to the Chouteau and Robidoux families of St. Louis. In 1827 Julien made his first trip to the far West with Francisco Robidoux. They passed through Taos and went to \"the land of the Utes,\" in the general area of Southern Utah and Colorado. From that time Julien is known only by his series of rock inscriptions. He was the first to leave a dateable mark in the land in the area. He left marks in 1831, 1836 and 1844, apparently traveling up and down the Colorado and Green rivers in a boat, apparently assisted by sail, since one of his inscriptions depicts a boat with a mast. A Denis Julien inscription from 1836 was found in lower Cataract Canyon by Otis R. Marston in 1964. This inscription is now buried under the reservoir behind Glen Canyon Dam. There is also a DJ inscription at the mouth of Chandler Canyon on the Green RIver. It is located on a large boulder to the left of the road as the road comes out onto the bottom land of the canyon."

During World War I, she was legal adviser to a Dutch government rationing bureau. She married Rufus Palmer Steeves, an officer in the Canadian Army, and came to Vancouver, British Columbia in January 1919. Steeves was a founding member of the CCF. She ran unsuccessfully as a CCF candidate in the provincial riding of Vancouver-Point Grey in the 1933 general election. Steeves was first elected to the provincial assembly in a 1934 by-election held following the death of Harley Christian Erskine Anderson. She was reelected twice and then defeated when she ran for reelection in 1945. Steeves went on to serve in CCF executives at the provincial and federal levels. She ran unsuccessfully as a CCF candidate in the federal riding of Burnaby—Richmond in 1949 and as an NDP candidate in the federal riding of Vancouver Quadra in 1963. Her interests included civil liberties, international affairs, nuclear disarmament, protection of animals, women's issues and abolition of capital punishment. Steeves wrote The Compassionate Rebel : Ernest E. Winch and his times, published in 1960, and Builders and Rebels : A short History of the CCF from 1932 to 1961."

  "text" : "David Edwin (1776–1841), an American engraver, was born at Bath, England. He was the son of John Edwin, a celebrated comic actor, and was apprenticed to an engraver, but he ran away to sea, and reached America in 1797. There he was employed by Edward Savage, the portrait painter, and soon gained much reputation by his portraits. After twenty years' work his sight failed, and he was compelled to resort to various means in order to obtain a livelihood. He died at Philadelphia in 1841."

  "text" : "Herbert Desmond Carter (15 June 1895 – 3 February 1939) was a British lyricist who worked with George and Ira Gershwin, Ivor Novello, and others, and also wrote one of the first English language versions of the notorious \"suicide song\", \"Gloomy Sunday\". He was born in Bristol. In 1924 he wrote most of the lyrics for the London musical Primrose, for which Gershwin wrote the music, his first commission outside the US. The musical was revived in 2003, when one reviewer wrote: \"...by far the most outstanding contribution to Primrose is the comedy lyrics of Desmond Carter, who penned the words to seventeen of the score's twenty-two songs and collaborated with Ira Gershwin on four of the remaining five. Two among them, \"Isn't It Horrible What They Did to Mary, Queen of Scots\" and \"That New Fangled Mother of Mine,\" shine with humor and wordplay worthy of Noel Coward.\" In 1936, Carter wrote English lyrics for the song \"Gloomy Sunday\" (\"Szomorú vasárnap\"), which had been written by Hungarian composer Rezső Seress with lyrics by László Jávor. Carter's lyrics were performed and recorded by Paul Robeson, whose recording was successful although most later versions of the song used alternative lyrics by American writer Sam M. Lewis. Carter also collaborated with leading English popular composers of the period, including Ivor Novello and Noel Gay. He died in London at the age of 43."

  "text" : "Daniel Thomas Egerton (1797–1842), was a British landscape painter, Egerton was one of the original members of the Society of British Artists, where he exhibited in the years 1824 to 1829, and in 1838 to 1840. He spent much of the later part of his life in Mexico, and in 1840 published Egerton's Views in Mexico, a portfolio of lithographs described in the subtitle as \"being a Series of Twelve Coloured Plates, executed by himself from his Original Drawings, accompanied with a short Description\". Having abandoned his family in England, Egerton returned to Mexico in 1841 with Alice Edwards, the teenaged daughter of another British painter. He and the eight-month pregnant Alice were murdered in the village of Tacubaya (present day Mexico City), Mexico, where they had rented a house, on 27 April 1842. Egerton was carrying large amounts of money, and both he and Alice were wearing jewelry which was untouched, although the murder was attributed to a robbery. British diplomatic pressure to solve the crime led to the arrest of three local petty thieves, two of whom were hanged, and one of whom was allowed to escape from prison. There has been speculation that Egerton's alleged involvement in fraudulent land sales in Texas, his ties to a Masonic order, or an unknown jealous lover of Alice was behind the killing. A painting of The Ravine of the Desert (The Valley of Mexico) was sold at Christie's New York in 2007 for $384,000. His painting The Valley of Mexico  (1837) is in the British Government Art Collection."

  "text" : "Dana Childs (December 15, 1922 – April 23, 1999) was a Maine politician, lawyer and jurist. Childs, who served as both a Democrat and Republican, represented Portland in the Maine House of Representatives. He served a two-year stint as Speaker of the Maine House of Representatives as a Democrat from 1965 to 1966. In 1966, Childs ran for the Democratic nomination for Governor of Maine, but lost to eventual Governor Kenneth M. Curtis. In 1973, Childs was nominated and later confirmed for the position of probate judge for Cumberland County largely because of his friendship with Republican leader David J. Kennedy. Childs also served as a lobbyist for the Maine Central Railroad alongside Kennedy after their political careers ended. He continued that position until the 1990s. Besides his political and law careers, Child was an avid horse enthusiast, serving as President of the Maine Harness Horsemen's Association. He died at his home in Westbrook on April 23, 1999 from a heart attack."

They also initiated the school band movement and designed the band curriculum for MOE. In 1969, Lim was promoted to head the Music Department in MOE. The number of school bands grew from 4 to 150 within a short period. He pioneered the instrumental teaching programme in primary schools which encouraged the use of instruments in the teaching and learning of music. Lim was responsible for the formation and training of many junior college choirs. Many are led by former members of the SYC. David Lim was the first recipient of the Cultural Medallion (Music) in 1979 for his contributions to music to Singapore. He retired from MOE in 1996."

Carpenter (1877–1951) was the Commissioner of Interstate Streams for the State of Colorado at a time when Western States' water rights were becoming a legal battleground, and became the primary driver behind the Colorado River Compact of 1922. Carpenter was raised on an irrigated farm in northern Colorado, where water was a precious resource. In 1899 after graduation from the University of Denver Law School, he went into practice in his hometown, serving community water-related legal needs. From 1909-1913, Carpenter served as a state senator representing his home district. When the Greeley-Poudre Irrigation District constructed a tunnel to divert water from Wyoming's Laramie River, Carpenter became lead counsel in the Wyoming vs. Colorado lawsuit that resulted, twice arguing the case before the U.S. Supreme Court. As the issue of water as a state resource grew, Carpenter conceived the idea of the legal compact as an out-of-court solution to the West's water conflicts, invoking the Compact Clause of the U.S. Constitution. The interstate water compacts Carpenter helped develop, particularly the 1922 Colorado River Compact, without which Hoover Dam would not have been built, form an enduring legacy. A book about Carpenter's life and career was published in 2003. His papers have been preserved at Colorado State University's Morgan Library in Fort Collins, Colorado."

An All-American, he was drafted in the first round by the Chicago Bears, even though he was injured. Canada was Clark's preferred destination, and he signed with the Ottawa Rough Riders in 1959. After rushing for 343 yards, he couldn't agree on contract terms with Ottawa, and was traded to the Winnipeg Blue Bombers, who promptly dealt him to the Montreal Alouettes. Clark was part of dynamic backfield with the Larks, sharing the ball with CFL great George Dixon. He rushed for 902 yards in 1960 (Dixon had 976) and 1143 yards in 1961, when he selected as an Eastern All Star. Injuries took their toll during his last two years, as played only 12 games and rushed for 435 and 447 yards (while Dixon won the MVP award rushing for 1520 yards.) Clark retired in 1964, only 27 years old, due to knee, rib and kidney injuries."

The third place Alouettes, coached by Lark great Sam Etcheverry, made cinderella drive for the Grey Cup. But it was without Duncan and Canadian slotback Bob McCarthy, who made headline news when they were suspended after the regular season for breaking the team drinking prohibition (regarding certain establishments.) The Als won the Grey Cup without Duncan. Duncan played a final year in the CFL with the Ottawa Rough Riders, where he rushed for 760 yards and was once again an All-Star. In all, he rushed for 3049 yards in his 4 year, 52 game career. He died in 2014 from Parkinson's disease."

  "text" : "Delma Dorothie Kollar (née Lowman; October 31, 1897 – January 24, 2012) was an American supercentenarian. At the time of her death, she was the fourth oldest living person in the world, behind Besse Cooper, Dina Manfredini and Jiroemon Kimura. On her last birthday, she became one of only 88 people to have attained the age of 114. Before recent research, she was thought to have been born in 1898. This was proved to have been wrong, based on the data in the census closest to her date of birth and proof that her younger sister was born in February 1899."

She was introduced on 26 December 2008 as the daughter of established character Nick Cotton (John Altman). Dotty was used as Nick's partner in crime, as the duo planned to kill her grandmother Dot (June Brown) and inherit the money from her will. She and Dot subsequently became friends after Nick's failed murder attempt, due to Dotty sabotaging their murder plan at the last minute. In her final storyline, airing on 23 February 2010, she left with her mother Sandy (Caroline Pegg), whom she believed dead. Critics disliked Dotty, with her accent being criticised by Jane Simon from The Daily Mirror. Critics from The Daily Mirror and The Guardian were glad to see her leave. However, executive producer Diederick Santer praised Conlin for her portrayal of Dotty, whilst both Brown and Altman opined that the storyline was one of their highlights. The Sun described her as \"one of the youngest, most wicked female soap villains\"."

  "text" : "Deborah Brin is the first openly gay rabbi in Judaism. She was ordained by the Reconstructionist Rabbinical College in 1985. She is now the rabbi of Congregation Nahalat Shalom in Albuquerque, New Mexico. In addition to her education from the Reconstructionist Rabbinical College, Rabbi Brin earned a B.A.in Religious Studies from Macalester College in St. Paul, Minnesota, and a master's degree in Pastoral Counseling from La Salle University in Philadelphia. She co-edited the poetry section for the Reconstructionist prayer book KOL HANESHAMAH: Shabbat Vehagim, and has written an article chronicling her experience leading the first women’s prayer service and Torah reading at the Western Wall for the book Women of the Wall, as well as \"The Use of Rituals in Grieving for a Miscarriage or Stillbirth\", for the book From Menarche to Menopause: The Female Body in Feminist Therapy. On December 1, 1988, during the first International Jewish Feminist Conference in Jerusalem, 70 women carried a Torah scroll to the Western Wall, and Brin led a prayer service for them. When the conference ended, a group of Jerusalem women continued to meet at the Kotel and formed Women of the Wall to assert their right to pray there without hindrance. A 2013 dissertation from the University of New Mexico's department of anthropology, “Storied Lives in a Living Tradition: Women Rabbis and Jewish Community in 21st Century New Mexico,” by Dr. Miria Kano, discusses Brin and four other female rabbis of New Mexico. In 2014 Brin was named one of PinkNews’s top 11 Jewish gay and lesbian icons."

One writer stated, \"It’s a Canadian version of Dee Brown’s best seller Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee and, as such, served a valuable purpose in raising public consciousness about Mi’kmaq history, identity, and culture.\" Among his many awards, Paul has been conferred with the Order of Canada and the Order of Nova Scotia. He received from Université Sainte-Anne an honorary Doctor of Letters Degree. His brother Lawrence Paul is the former long-serving chief of Millbrook First Nation (1984-2012)."

  "text" : "Didrik Slagheck (died 24 January 1522) was a Danish archbishop, military commander during the Swedish War of Liberation, and often pointed out as an active participant in the Stockholm Bloodbath. Slagheck was the illegitimate son of a Westphalian priest and appears to have been working in the papal office during his early life. He arrived in Norway in 1510 and soon received appreciation for his service from both Christian II of Denmark and his advisor, Sigbrit Willoms. After some time abroad he returned to Scandinavia in 1517, as assistant to the papal representative Arcimboldus. Arcimboldus is said to have received bribes from Sten Sture the Younger, regent of Sweden, something which Slagheck reported to the king. He was soon sent to Rome to report about Arcimboldus' activities. In 1520 Slagheck followed Christian II to Stockholm and is said to have helped inspire the Stockholm Bloodbath. He was soon appointed to the position as bishop of Skara, as the previous bishop Vincent Henningsson had been executed. He became one of the three Danish leaders left behind to govern Sweden when Christian II returned to Denmark, soon making himself unpopular among the population. Slagheck participated as a military commander during the early stages of the rebellion led by Gustav Vasa, leading the Danish forces during the Battle of Västerås. He was recalled to Denmark later in 1521, where he was given the position of archbishop of Lund. He would not keep this position for long, as Pope Leo X had been greatly discontented when he received word of the execution of two bishops in the Stockholm Bloodbath, prompting Christian II to put the entire blame on Slagheck. He was sentenced to death by hanging, which was changed in the last minute to death by burning, which took place in Copenhagen on 24 January 1522."

He was also yachting editor of The Field. Kemp was an authority on the design of yachts and yacht racing. Of his famous yachts, Firecrest (1892) was used by Alain Gerbault in his solo circumnavigation of the globe, and was the vessel he sailed to win the Blue Water Medal in 1923. His Amazon is still afloat and made a Trans-Atlantic crossing in 2011. The British Admiralty ordered copies of his Yacht and Boat Sailing supplied to the Navy. As an architect, he was regarded as an expert on stability of vessels, and his work was supplied to officers of the Royal Navy. As recently as a 1950 analysis of Joshua Slocum's vessel Spray, Kemp's formulae and analysis were still being put to use. In yacht racing, he was known for having devised a new ranking system based on the length of vessels and their area under sail. Kemp also wrote concerning the rules of yacht racing."

  "text" : "David Charles Mitchell (b.1934)   is a retired minister of the Presbyterian Church of Australia and a specialist in constitutional law. Mitchell was born on March 13, 1934 at the St. Stephen's Private Hospital in South Hobart, Tasmania and grew up in the nearby suburb of Sandy Bay, Tasmania  and was educated at the University of Tasmania  and admitted to the bar on 4 February 1958. In due course he was also admitted to the bar in Victoria, New South Wales, Australian Capital Territory, South Australia, West Australia, England and Lesotho. Mitchell worked for the British Colonial Service in the Bechuanaland Protectorate, now known as Botswana, as an Assistant District Officer on probation in the Serowe District in the year following his appointment on March 24, 1960. He subsequently joined the Commonwealth Public Service, where he was responsible for legal matters in Papua New Guinea for the then Department of External Territories. He transferred to the Attorney-General's Department, where he helped establish the Australian Legal Aid Office in 1974 before being seconded to Lesotho. Mitchell was Solicitor-General for Lesotho in October 1976, when Lesotho was in dispute with its neighbour South Africa over the closure of three border crossings into the Transkei, that was designed to pressure Lesotho into recognizing this \"homeland\" established by South Africa for its Bantu peoples. He successfully presented the case for the government of Lesotho to the Security Council of the United Nations which resulted in an aid package of $US113 million. Mitchell became a home missionary, pastoring the Presbyterian parish of Queanbeyan in New South Wales in 1979 and 1980 from the Lutheran Church of that town,    and the new Presbyterian parish of Tuggeranong in the Australian Capital Territory from 1981.  The congregation of the latter parish initially met at the Erindale Centre from September 13,  and moved to the Monash Primary School from January 24, where he provided a Sunday School and Boys Brigade.  He was subsequently ordained, and, after a time, became Moderator of the Presbyterian Church of Tasmania in 1994. In that role, he presented the cases about, and voted against, the ordination of women within the Presbyterian Church of Australia. He believed that it was \"a very complicated and divisive issue\", and thought that his \"motivation for so voting was very different from the motivation of most others\". He believed that \"it is a situation where men are forced to take a proper and full responsibility\", having \"a special accountability at the seat of judgment\", and they \"will be held more strictly to account\". This was not a \"retreat from reality\", and gave women a \"far superior position\" where they could exercise a \"softer, more compassionate touch\".  Subsequently he pastored the Presbyterian Community Church at Rokeby, Tasmania from 2000 to 2003.  He also acted as procurator for the Tasmanian Assembly of the Church, resigning in August 2000 after serving in that post for well over a decade. Subsequently he acted temporarily in the same capacity for the South Australian Assembly of the Church in 2002, and was the convener of the Tasmanian Theological Education Committee in 2003. Mitchell continued his association with Canberra, returning many times. \n*  In 1994, he gave a public lecture on the \"constitution and Australia's future\" on January 27 at the Albert Hall, where he advocated for the Australian monarchy for \"legal, pragmatic and religious reasons\", and also spoke at the summer school organized by Youth With A Mission.  \n*  He was at regular speaker until 2010 at the annual Daniel 2:44 Conference in Canberra. Mitchell was elected a delegate from Tasmania to the 1998 Australian Constitutional Convention as a member of the Australian Monarchist League,. He \"felt that he had been enormously privileged to have been a delegate at the convention, where overall there had been a good spirit of cooperation ... [but was] concerned that the push for a republic represents a tearing away from the Scriptural basis of our system of government, going back as far as Magna Carta and the Bill of Rights, which were under-girded by Scripture.\" He subsequently self-published a paperback booklet, Republic? The Hidden Agenda, and contributed to the booklet, Democracy Down Under - Understanding Our Constitution, published by the Church and Nation Committee of the Presbyterian Church of Victoria. Mitchell ran as one of two Australian Senate candidates in Tasmania for the Christian Democratic Party in the 2004 federal election. He received 2,270 primary votes and was eliminated after the 95th recount. Subsequently Mitchell campaigns against recognizing local government in the Australian Constitution,  which he regarded as a \"direct attack\" against the States which would enable the Federal Government to \"undermine or contradict state government policy\".  He continues to campaign against an Australian Republic."

In more than 20 years of professional experience he participated in several exhibitions, lectures, and juries, and five times has been awarded with “Lux” National Photography Prizes, granted by the Spanish Association of Professional Photographers. He collaborates with architects such as Alvaro Siza, Herzog & de Meuron, Rafael Moneo, EMBT, and Coop Himmelb(l)au, and his photographs are regularly featured in specialized magazines and publishing houses worldwide. After graduating in Architecture cum laude from the Genoa University, he moved to Barcelona to begin his career as an architect. He soon joined the studio MBM (Martorell-Bohigas-Mackay) Arquitectos, where, among other responsibilities, he led the winning team for the “Un Progetto per Siena” international competition.In 1989 he won a scholarship granted by the “CNR” (Italian National Research Centre) for a research on Spanish Contemporary Architecture. Carrying out the research he took up his youthful interest in photography and his images obtained general recognition. In 1991 he decided to devote himself entirely to architectural photography.Along with his work as a photographer, Duccio Malagamba is the author of various articles on photography and architecture and from 1995 to 2008 he was, first the technical editor and then, the editor of the \"Gran Formato\" section of the Spanish magazine ‘Diseño Interior’. He conceives his work as ‘architectural reportages’ -rather than a series of separate shots- that aim to transmit to the observer a complex range of emotions, experiences and thoughts, providing a full, multi-faceted view of the subject. Nevertheless, the primary purpose of his visual investigation is to inspire and stimulate the viewer more than to transmit objective information about the portrayed intervention."

He served in the Maine House of Representatives from 1998 to 2006. In October 2011, Trahan took over as the executive director of the Sportsman's Alliance of Maine, a position which involved lobbying government officials. State regulations did not force Trahan to resign from his post in the Senate upon registering as lobbyist and Trahan chose not to resign until January. This forced the 21 towns in District 20 to hold a special election in early 2012, instead of having it on Election Day in November 2011, costing each town hundreds of dollars. Upon the resumption of the Maine legislature on January 4, 2012, Trahan officially submitted his letter of resignation to Senate President Kevin Raye. In the special election to replace Trahan, Chris Johnson of Somerville defeated Republican State Representative Dana Dow to fill the remaining term."

  "text" : "Denis Jourdanet (1 May 1815 – 6 May 1892) was a French physician and physiologist born in Juillan, Hautes-Pyrénées. He is remembered for pioneer studies of altitude sickness and hypoxia. As a wealthy physician, Jourdanet traveled extensively throughout mountainous regions of Mexico during the mid 19th century. Here he studied the effects of \"mountain sickness\" that climbers experienced at higher altitudes. From these studies he was the first person to make a connection between reduced atmospheric oxygen pressure and elevated erythrocyte (red blood cell) counts in humans. At the time Jourdanet referred to the condition as \"barometric anoxemia\". He was a friend and colleague to physiologist Paul Bert (1833–1886), to whom he provided the necessary equipment such as a decompression chamber for laboratory research of medical conditions caused by lowered oxygen pressure."

  "text" : "Danny Lockwood (born 15 December 1958) is the publisher of the rugby league newspaper League Weekly, former amateur rugby league player. He is also the owner and publisher of The Press, a weekly local newspaper based in Batley, West Yorkshire. As an amateur Rugby league player Lockwood was selected to represent Yorkshire and Great Britain (BARLA). His main clubs were Dewsbury Celtic and Bradford Dudley Hill. He played several seasons of rugby union in the USA and one season of semi-professional rugby league in Australia. As a journalist Lockwood has worked on the Yorkshire Post, West Australian and Yorkshire Evening Post among other titles. In 1993 he became editor of the (now) Johnston Press weekly local Dewsbury Reporter and, later, their Lancaster Guardian title. Lockwood launched The Press in 2002 and continued as editor and columnist through several apparent ownership changes. In 2011 Lockwood claimed that he \"saved\" the publication after serious financial problems. In 2007 Lockwood was the subject of a high profile libel trial initiated by the then Dewbury MP Shahid Malik, which ended in a hung jury after a two-week trial at the Royal Courts of Justice in London. The case was subsequently dropped after the men agreed to publish a joint statement and to meet their own costs. In 2010 a large-scale protest outside Dewsbury police station was organised by left-wing activists and friends of ousted MP Shahid Malik after Lockwood wrote about Derrick Bird, the perpetrator of the Cumbria shootings, saying “If Derrick Bird had been carrying a Koran he would have been celebrated as a hero by tens of thousands, possibly more of so called “British” Muslims”. In December 2011 Lockwood self-published a book called The Islamic Republic of Dewsbury. It is descried as \"the story of a cultural revolution and social decay in the once-proud Yorkshire mill town of Dewsbury\" and \"a chronicle of more than 20 years of failed multi-culturalism.\" In 2014, Lockwood was found guilty at Kirklees Magistrates Court of common assault following an incident outside a public house in April 2013. The conviction was overturned by Judge James Spencer sitting at Leeds Crown Court on Friday June 13, 2014 after he described prosecution witnesses as \"unreliable\" and ruled that the publisher acted lawfully and in self defence."

Jack's family were loyalists who settled in New Brunswick. Jack attended the Saint John Grammar School, graduating in 1881. In 1883 he published his Centennial prize essay on the history of the city and county of St. John, which was greatly acclaimed. In 1884, following the death of his father, Jack took over the family insurance business and also inherited his father's position as Spanish vice-consul. In the decade which followed he served his city on the Common Council as well as the Board of School Trustees. Some of his political accomplishments included the introduction of electric street lighting in Saint John, preparation for Prince George's 1901 visit, and the 1910 erection of the city's Champlain Monument. From 1901 until 1908 Jack published Acadiensis, a quarterly journal of the history of the Maritime provinces. Jack also contributed to the Montreal Daily Star, the University Magazine (Montreal) and the Queen's Quarterly (Kingston). Jack accumulated an excellent collection of historical documents related to the Maritimes. Many of these were donated to the city library. Jack died in 1913 at a sanatorium in New York where he was being treated for heart disease."

Mr. Leka is the Founder, Chairman and CEO of TransMedia Corporation, the creator of the award winning cloud computing platform Glide OS and its successor, Jumptuit. Mr. Leka is also co-author of Cloud Computing: The Glide OS Story, Solving The Cross Platform Puzzle. Mr. Leka launched Glide OS in 2005, well before cloud computing became a popularized term. Jeffrey S. Young, one of the founding editors of Macworld magazine and co-author of the bestseller iCon Steve Jobs: The Greatest Second Act in the History of Business, described Glide as \"one of the first 'Internet' operating systems, a browser based working and computing environment\" that \"demonstrates the first new competition for Apple and Microsoft since Digital Research’s GEM.\" Mr. Leka has cited the importance of cross-device, cross-platform compatibility and system integration in cloud computing design. \"Walter S. Mossberg, The Wall Street Journal’s principal technology columnist said of Glide OS at the All Things Digital Conference (AllThingsD) that, Glide is like 'world peace' between devices and platforms.” Steve Wildstrom, writer and editor of BusinessWeek's personal technology column, \"Technology & You,\" described Glide as providing \"the closest thing I've seen to a set of universal applications.\" However, Glide’s cross-platform service has also put the Company and Mr. Leka in the crosshairs with proprietary technology companies, most notably Apple. An early advocate of protecting user privacy rights in cloud computing services, Mr. Leka created the Glide Society in March 2006, a rules-based networking environment in the Glide OS with parental controls, digital rights management, and user preferences. In August 2007, Mr. Leka announced the establishment of the Glide User's Bill of Rights in a \"pledge\" to protect personal data. In December 2007, Mr. Leka launched Glide Free, a feature-rich free email service designed to protect email privacy as an alternative to Google Gmail that scans personal emails \"to generate contextually relevant ads\" In April 2009, Mr. Leka announced the launch of Kids' Glide to provide children with a safe online environment and parents with the tools to monitor child email accounts and other online activity. Glide has been featured in news publications including The New York Times, USAToday, and The Wall Street Journal, and books including Cloud Computing Bible, by Barrie Sosinsky,  and Cloud Computing: Web-Based Applications That Change the Way You Work and Collaborate Online, by Michael Miller. Mr. Leka has been a featured speaker at the All Things Digital Conference, Harvard Business School Cyberposium Technology Conference, New York Tech Meetup (NYTM), and TEDx. Mr. Leka is also the founder of the award winning Glide Health Corporation launched at TechCrunch50 on September 15, 2009 and Glide Education Corporation."

  "text" : "Dionizy Feliks Czachowski (born April 6, 1810 in Niedabyl, died November 6, 1863 in Jawor Solecki) was a Polish general and commander of the Sandomierz Voivodeship during the January Uprising in Congress Poland. Dionizy, through his mother, was a cousin of the Polish composer Frédéric Chopin; the two shared a grandfather, Jakub Krzyżanowski. He played a role in the preparations for the uprising by, among other endeavors, using his personal fortune to purchase a large number of horses from the Russian army in 1862. In 1863 he joined the uprising and reported himself at an insurrectionists' concentration point at Łysa Góra. He originally was given the rank of colonel. Under General Marian Langiewicz Czachowski fought in various battles and skirmishes, including at the battles of Staszów, Małogoszcz and Grochowiska. After the latter battle, following Langiewicz's orders he crossed over into the Sandomierz Voivodeship, where on April 14, 1863, he was named the overall commander of the region and given an independent command. He was promoted to the rank of general in October 1863. In November of that year his unit, stationed in the forest near Zwoleń, was tracked down by Russian forces. While trying to retreat Czachowski was cornered near the village of Jawor Solecki and there he died."

He served 20 years in the United States Army. On November 30, 2011, the Maine Ethics Commission ruled that Burns broke campaign finance rules during his 2010 campaign. The ethics commission declared that Burns owed more than $2,000 for violating state law regarding the use of public funds, including the co-mingling of personal and campaign funds, the falsifying of documents and other chargers of malfeasance. The commission also asked Maine Attorney General William Schneider to open a criminal investigation and impose a large fine for the violations which Commission chair Walter McKee called \"mind-boggling\". On January 31, 2012, Burns resigned from the Maine House of Representatives following an investigation by the Maine Attorney General. Earlier in the same day, leading Democratic state representative Emily Cain had called for Burns' immediate resignation. After pleading guilty to misdemeanor forgery and theft charges in connection with his 2010 election campaign he was sentenced to six months in prison."

Shen Zhuliang's father, Shen Yin Shu, was a great-grandson of King Zhuang of Chu and died in the historic Battle of Boju in 506 BCE. After his father's death, King Zhao of Chu enfeoffed Shen Zhuliang with the city of Ye (in present-day Ye County, Henan) at the northern frontier of the Chu kingdom. He was known as Ye Gong (Duke of Ye), and became the founding ancestor of the Ye surname, which is today the 42nd most common surname in China. In 489 BCE, Confucius visited Shen Zhuliang in Ye, and their conversations were recorded in the Analects of Confucius. In 478 BCE, during the reign of King Hui of Chu, Shen Zhuliang put down the rebellion of Duke of Bai and restored the king's rule. Shen Zhuliang became the Prime Minister and Chief Military Commander, the top two government posts of Chu."

  "text" : "Dhiren Bhagat (1957–1988) was an Indian journalist and poet known for his provocative and distinctly unconventional conservatism. Bhagat was born in Tokyo in 1957. He returned to India to school at Mayo College, Ajmer, before joining Merton College, Oxford, from where he graduated in 1981. Besides writing regularly for the Spectator (London), the Sunday Observer, the Indian Post, and the Illustrated Weekly of India, he also contributed articles to the Telegraph and the Hindustan Times, the Indian Express, India Today, Sunday, Harpers and Queen, and the London Magazine. In 1986, he became the South-East Asia correspondent of the Observer (London). In addition to his journalism Dhiren Bhagat wrote short stories and poetry. Dhiren Bhagat's articles continue to influence contemporary Indian society & politics with his articles being used against public figures like Rajiv Gandhi, Khushwant Singh, Arun Shourie and Mani Shankar Aiyar. Bhagat's views ranged from the fourth estate (Why Shourie Can't Think Straight); politics (The New Hypocrisy); and the Punjab of the early 1980s (Bloodstained Whitewash) to Indian writing and theater (The Limited Club); conservative morality ([[Auschwitz]] for the Chickens]) and the seamier side of covert operations (How Disinformation Works). Bhagat was writing a book on the Punjab at the time of his death in a car accident in November 1988."

  "text" : "Daniel George MacMartin (9 January 1844 – 12 April 1923 (aged 79) was treaty commissioner for the Government of Ontario for Treaty 9 in 1905 and 1906, along with two Dominion commissioners, Duncan Campbell Scott, of Ottawa, Ontario, Esquire, and Samuel Stewart, of Ottawa, Ontario, Esquire. MacMartin was the sole commissioner nominated by and representing the province of Ontario under provisions which reads: \"That any future treaties with the Indians in respect of territory in Ontario to which they have not before the passing of the said Statutes surrendered their claim aforesaid shall be deemed to require the concurrence of the government of Ontario.\" Under the provisions of this clause, the terms of the treaty were fixed by the governments of the Dominion and Ontario; Daniel G. MacMartin and the two other commissioners \"were empowered to offer certain conditions, but were not allowed to alter or add to them in the event of their not being acceptable to the First Nations.\" MacMartin's role was to protect the interests of the Ontario government whose agreement to make the treaty had to be sought and in whose jurisdiction reserves will be chosen and surveyed. MacMartin was to ensure that no reserves were located in areas with water power or mineral resources with future potential. MacMartin's incomplete 1905 journal was donated to the Queen's University archives in 1968. Although the journal was accessed by other researchers its significance was not fully recognised until c. 2010. Until the contents of diaries were revealed, details about the signing of the constitutionally recognized agreement were known only through the accounts of Duncan Campbell Scott and Samuel Stewart, commissioners appointed by the Government of Canada. The journals of the other two – Samuel Stewart and Duncan Campbell Scott, both former employees of the Department of Indian Affairs, were easily accessible at the National Archives of Canada in Ottawa. MacMartin's diaries provide another perspective on the Treaty 9 tracing the treaty's origins, negotiation, explanation, interpretation, signing, implementation, and recent commemoration. He was a miner from Perth, Ontario and was considered to be an Indian Affairs outsider, albeit someone who was politically well-connected. It was suggested that he probably knew little about the process of treaty negotiations; however, from his journal entries, he seemed to realize that Treaty 9 was an anomaly. He had received the written Treaty prior to negotiations and realized that he had only fixed terms to offer and no authority to bargain. Toronto lawyer Murray Klippenstein, who earlier helped the Mushkegowuk First Nations of western James Bay to challenge the Mike Harris government’s workfare legislation and launch their Rupert’s Land Protection Pledge suit, also discovered the journal. Klippenstein claimed that in MacMartin's diaries oral promises had been made that contradicted the written Treaties and supports Elders' claims. He quoted from Commissioner MacMartin’s diary, \"it was explained to them that they could hunt and fish as of old\" and \"they were not restricted as of territory\" and \"they could hunt wherever they pleased.\" Klippenstein argued that oral promises that are part of the Treaty should override legislation like the Far North Act."

  "text" : "Daniel Lucius \"Doc\" Adams (November 1, 1814 – January 3, 1899) was an American baseball player and executive who is regarded by historians as an important figure in the sport's early years. For most of his career he was a member of the New York Knickerbockers. He first played for the New York Base Ball Club in 1840 and started his Knickerbockers career five years later, continuing to play for the club into his forties and to take part in inter-squad practice games and matches against opposing teams. Researchers have called Adams the creator of the shortstop position, which he used to field short throws from outfielders. In addition to his playing career, Adams manufactured baseballs and oversaw bat production; he also occasionally acted as an umpire. From 1847 to 1861, the Knickerbockers selected Adams as their president six times, and as a vice president, treasurer, or director in six other years. As president of the club, Adams was an advocate of rule changes in baseball that resulted in nine-man teams and nine-inning games. When the National Association of Base Ball Players (NABBP) was formed in 1858, he led the rules and regulations committee of the new organization. In his role, Adams ruled that the fields' bases should be 90 feet (27 m) apart, the modern distance, and supported the elimination of the \"bound rule\", which allowed for balls caught after one bounce to be recorded as outs. He resigned from his positions with the Knickerbockers and NABBP in 1862. Adams' contributions in creating baseball's rules went largely unrecognized for decades after his 1899 death, but in 1980 a letter about him appeared in The New York Times; by 1993, researcher John Thorn had written about Adams' role. Other historians have given him credit for helping to develop the sport, and Thorn has called Adams \"first among the Fathers of Baseball\". A graduate of Yale University and Harvard Medical School, Adams began working in the medical field in the late 1830s, and practiced in New York City during his time as a member of the Knickerbockers. In 1865, he left medicine and later became a bank president and member of the Connecticut legislature. He and his wife had five children."

  "text" : "David Sutton Phelps, Jr. was born in Fort Pierce, Florida in 1930. From 1970–1996 Phelps taught anthropology at East Carolina University, which named an archaeology lab after him. Before teaching at East Carolina University Phelps had taught at Tulane University, Florida State University, and Briefly at the University Of Georgia, respectively in that order. Phelps worked on many archaeological sites, some of his more notable sites are the Tar River site, the Neoheroka Fort Tuscarora war site (near snow hill), Lake Phelps, Fort Raleigh (near Manteo), and Hatteras Island. Tar river showed evidence of human occupation more than 11,000 years ago. At the Hatteras island near Buxton a 16th-century signet ring that may have belonged to the lost colonists. In 1992 Lake Phelps was archaeologically explored and over 30 ancient canoes were found. Out of the 30 canoes only 23 have been measured and studied. The process of making these canoes is through splitting a Cyprus log and burning/scraping the interior until the desired shape is acquired. The earliest inhabitants associated with this region are represented by small spear points of the palmer type dating back to the period of 8000BCE – 9000BCE. The late archaic period (3000BCE – 1000BCE) was represented by such items as spear points, spear thrower weight and bi-facial blades. Cooking vessels made of soap stone. The three earliest dated canoes belong to this time period. The early woodland period was between 1000BCE- 300BCE) and was found to contain fabrics and artistic designs on paddles. Two of the canoes were found to belong to this period. The middle woodland period between 300BCE and 800AD and is classified as the most active time period for the site. 8 of the canoes belong to this time period. The late woodland culture from 800AD to 1650 is attributed with being the ancestral culture of the Carolina Algonkians. Only 3 canoes were found to belong to this time period. In 1998 Phelps discovered an unusual ball of clay that was later revealed to be a 10 carat gold signet ring. The ring is engraved with a prancing lion and is believed to date back to the 16th century. David Phelps, director of the East Carolina University Archaeology laboratory at the time, retired from East Carolina University in 2000 and moved back to Florida. On February 21, 2009 Phelps died at the age of 79."

His second one-man show, $1800, premiered in New York City in November 2015 and chronicles finding $1800 on the street, his moral dilemma about what to do with it, along with life as a struggling actor in New York and chronic health issues. Crabb graduated from Texas State University–San Marcos in 1997 and then got an MFA in Photography and Performance from Cranbook Academy of Art in 1999. He is two-time winner of The Moth storytelling slam. He has appeared on stage and on screen, and has also worked as a sound engineer. He was a regular member of the off-Broadway theater company Axis Company NYC as well as a producer and performer for Ask Me Stories and RISK! Show. As of 2016, he resides in Los Angeles, CA with his husband, actor Jack Perry, and their dog."

  "text" : "Daved H. Fremont (born January 13, 1964) is an Associate Professor at the Washington University in St. Louis School of Medicine with dual appointments in the Departments of Pathology and Immunology/Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics. He is currently director of the Computational and Molecular Biophysics Program. Fremont is also a principal investigator in the Center for Structural Genomics of Infectious Disease (CSGID) and his laboratory has deposited structures of proteins from several major human pathogens to the protein data bank (PDB). In 1993, Fremont received his PhD in chemistry working in Ian Wilson’s laboratory at the The Scripps Research Institute while a student at the University of California, San Diego. Here, he determined the first x-ray crystal structures of a major histocompatibility complex (MHC) bound to specific peptides. These structures of the H-2Kb molecule, published in Science in 1992, played a pivotal role in defining the molecular details of host discrimination of “self” versus “non-self”, and had been cited 847 times according to Google Scholar. His work helped explain how a single MHC class I molecule is able to bind a vast array of different antigen peptide sequences and established that MHC class I molecules bind primarily to the backbone atoms of antigen peptides in a sequence-independent manner. Fremont continued his work in structural immunology as a post-doctoral fellow with Wayne Hendrickson at Columbia University and John Kappler at the National Jewish Center. There he solved a number of MHC structures, most notably that of murine H2-M, a chaperone involved in MHC class I loading. In 1998, he joined Washington University in St. Louis as an Assistant Professor where his research expanded to include viral immune evasion and antibody-mediated neutralization. His laboratory has since established the structural basis for interactions between host cytokines and pox- and herpesviruses decoy receptors and neutralization of West Nile Virus by therapeutic antibodies. Fremont is now best known for his research on how the immune system recognizes viruses and the subversion mechanisms they deploy to avoid detection and clearance. On the personal side, Fremont is married and has a daughter. He enjoys playing Go and Poker; in the latter, he is partial to seven card stud, especially the Chesterfield version, and does not prefer wild card games."

As violence spread through the country and civil war erupted, Kayongo and his family became refugees in Kenya. He later immigrated to America to attend university. Today, he is a successful entrepreneur and human rights innovator. Though most well known as a 2011 CNN Hero and founder of the Global Soap Project, Kayongo is a renowned expert in environmental sustainability and global health, as well as the current CEO of the National Center for Civil and Human Rights in Atlanta, Georgia. In 2016 the Georgia State Senate passed a resolution recognizing Kayongo's incredible journey from refugee to CEO."

  "text" : "Duncan Scott is a British comics artist. He has been working freelance since completing a degree in visual communication in 1999. He has drawn for numerous comics and magazines and his work has appeared in The Beano, The TV Times, Blue Peter magazine, Disney Explorer magazine, BBC's Learning Is Fun magazine, BeanoMAX, The Dandy and Comic Football. His first artwork for The Beano included illustrations for the Rhyme Time sections (Taking over from Chris McGhie) which was a regular feature in The Beano during the first half of the 2000s, which saw readers send in rhymes. From 2001 he drew \"Stripz\" for The Beano which were usually a small single panel gag which featured in the comic occasionally filling half a page or more often as a gag at the bottom of a full page strip. His first regular full strip, Colin the Vet, appeared in The Beano in 2004. It came in second place in that year's Comic Idol competition but entered the comic anyway after only losing by one percent. He also drew The Neds starting from 2005. This strip was irregular but it was also featured in BeanoMAX. He also drew Mia Starr for The Beano but this strip lost the 2006 Comic Idol competition and unlike Colin the Vet, it did not become a regular strip in the comic. In addition to illustrating, he occasionally writes comics. He wrote a number of scripts for Harry Hill's adventures in TV land which was drawn by Nigel Parkinson."

  "text" : "Sir Daniel Norton (1568 – 4 July 1636) was an English landowner and politician who sat in the House of Commons at various times between 1621 and 1629. Norton was the son of Sir Richard Norton of Rotherfield. He was knighted at Whitehall on 23 July 1603. Through his marriage in 1606 he came into possession of Southwick Park He was High Sheriff of Hampshire in 1607. He built a new house on or near the site of Southwick Priory which was demolished at the beginning of the 19th century. In 1621, he was elected Member of Parliament for Portsmouth. He was elected MP for Hampshire in 1624 and for Portsmouth again in 1625. It was while Charles I was the guest of Norton at Southwick Park, that he received the news of the assassination of the Duke of Buckingham by John Felton at Portsmouth. In 1626 he served a second term as Sheriff of Hampshire and in 1628 was elected MP for Hampshire again, sitting until 1629 when King Charles decided to rule without parliament for eleven years. Norton had joined Sir John Cooper, 1st Baronet in denouncing Arminianism in the 1628-29 parliament,and Norton was made one of the trustees for Cooper's son Anthony Ashley Cooper. He provided a home for him and his siblings at Southwick after the death of their parents and Norton chose a man with Puritan leanings named Fletcher as Cooper's tutor. Norton died at the age of about 77. Norton married Honoria White daughter of Sir John White of Southwick in about July 1606. She was a woman of some fortitude and religious conviction. Their son Richard Norton was a Parliamentarian colonel and their daughter Honoria married John Eliot."

  "text" : "Darya Lavrentyevna Mikhailova (Дарья Лаврентьевна Михайлова) (November 1836 – 1892) was a Russian nurse during the siege of Sevastopol in the Crimean War, from which she became better known by the name Dasha of Sevastopol (Даша Севастопольская). She was the Russian counterpart to Florence Nightingale. Mikhailova was born in a village near Klyuchischi in the Kazan Governorate. Her father, a sailor in the Russian navy, was killed in the Battle of Sinope in 1853. She was a 17-year-old orphan when the Crimean War broke out in 1853. Before the war, she worked as a laundress and needlewoman for the personnel of the Russian navy in the Korabelnaya district of Sevastopol, near Sevastopol Shipyard. She left her home when the war broke out to help take care of wounded Russian soldiers on the battlefield during the Battle of Alma. She set up a nursing station, using vinegar and strips of her clothing to clean and dress the soldiers' wounds. She was the first Russian army sisters of charity during the Crimean War. After the war, Tsar Nicholas I awarded her the Order of St. Vladimir with a gold medal \"For diligence\". She was the only lower-class Russian woman to receive this award. She was also given a reward of 500 silver rubles, and promised a further gift of 1,000 silver rubles on her marriage, when she married, which she received when she married Private Maksim Khvorostov in 1855. The couple ran an inn in a village, then moved to Nikolaev, but Dasha eventually returned to Sevastopol where she ran a tavern and worked in a hospital. When she retired, she was presented with an icon of Christ bought with donations from her patients. She died in Shelanga, near her home village, in 1892. Asteroid 3321 is named in her memory (3321 Dasha 1975 TZ2 Darya Lavrentyevna Mikhailova)."

  "text" : "Jeannie Saffin was a woman from London, England, whose death from fire in 1982 is cited by paranormal researchers and authors as an example of spontaneous human combustion, and is reported to be the most recent suspected case in the UK. Aspects of the reports made immediately after her injury and death apparently supported the conclusion that her death was due to spontaneous human combustion; John Heymer devoted a chapter of his 1996 book The Entrancing Flame to the case. However, later research has cast doubt on some of the evidence and refutes the claims that her injuries were caused by spontaneous human combustion."

He qualified for the ill fated United States Olympic team in 1980 by finishing second to Renaldo Nehemiah in the United States Olympic Trials, but did not get to run in the Olympics due to the 1980 Summer Olympics boycott. While running for Harry Ells High School in Richmond, California, Cooper led his team to the team title at the 1975 CIF California State Meet. In the process, Cooper tied the National High School record in the 120 yard hurdles at 13.2 in the semi-finals. That record was later surpassed by Nehemiah, which remains the record.

  "text" : "Derek Charles Eyles (1902–1974) was a British illustrator and comics artist. Born in North Finchley, London, he was the son of Charles Eyles, a painter and illustrator who had worked with the Impressionists in France, and had a brother, Geoffrey Eyles, an illustrator who appears to have died young. Eyles' colour plates and black and white illustrations began appearing in boys' annuals in the 1920s and 1930s. He painted covers and drew interior illustrations for story papers like Wild West Weekly. He also illustrated novels, including an edition of Jack London's White Fang, and children's books, including an edition of Charles and Mary Lamb's Tales from Shakespeare, and in the 1930s and 1940s, painted a series of covers for Collins' western novels. Two fictitious portraits in a fake memoir are signed \"D. C. Eyles 41\". After the Second World War he was hired by Amalgamated Press editor Leonard Matthews to draw adventure strips for the publisher's comics, beginning with \"The Phantom Sheriff\" in The Knockout in 1947, a character whose prose adventures he had previously illustrated in Wild West Weekly. Other titles he contributed to included The Comet, Thriller Picture Library, Cowboy Comics Library, Sun, Radio Fun, Adventures, and Swift. He excelled at drawing horses, which made him particularly suitable for western characters, including Wild Bill Hickok, Kit Carson and Buffalo Bill, as well other historical characters like Hereward the Wake, Robin Hood and Dick Turpin, and new artists were given samples of his work as examples of how to \"do horses properly\". In the 1960s he worked mainly in the nursery end of the comics market, on titles like Treasure and TV Toyland, and for girls' titles like Tina and Princess Tina. By the 1970s westerns and other equestrian genres had fallen out of fashion, and Eyles struggled to get work. Suffering from diabetes, he died in December 1974 after an unsuccessful operation."

As of 2010, Wathen oversaw court-ordered improvements in mental health services. Wathen testified before the Health and Human Services committee of the Maine legislature that cuts to mental health services would be \"illusory\" and the proposed cuts would be spent elsewhere, such as in prison services for mentally ill people. Attorney General Janet Mills defended Governor John Baldacci's plan to cut mental health services. As of 2011, Wathen was the Board Chairman of the Maine Turnpike Authority."

The coach of the national team, Zhou Jianan, was irritated by the number of calls he received inquiring Ding's family background. Zhou dismissed most of these calls, saying that he \"fits the requirements established by the Chinese Volleyball Association\" and that Ding's background is a \"private matter.\" He was said to be preparing for the 2012 London Olympics. In his personal life, Ding is very popular among his teammates. He is a little shy but soon would become the favorite of everyone. \"He's also a great singer and dancer and he brings more passion to the game than the other players,\" said Wang Hebing, the head coach of Zhejiang Volleyball team. In 2012, Ding left Zhejiang men's volleyball team and went to study abroad before the new season started because \"there's no future of this sport in China.\" Ding began playing volleyball for Warner University in 2014."

In 1803, he was named professor of botany at the University of Genoa, where he is credited with the founding of its botanical garden. He is known for his natural history studies (botany, mineralogy, zoology) of the Ligurian region as well as botanical investigations of flora native to other areas of the Italian mainland, Sardinia, Corsica, and Libya. In 1804, Antonio José Cavanilles named the botanical genus Viviania (family Vivianiaceae) in his honor. He bequeathed his library of 2000 volumes from the 16th to the 19th century to King Charles Albert of Sardinia, who in turn donated the books to the University of Genoa library. His herbarium in Genoa was destroyed due to the ravages of war, however, some of his specimens can be located in other herbaria."

He is also well known for Harker–Kasper inequalities (statistical relationships between the phases of structure factors), which he devised in collaboration with John S. Kasper.Harker made seminal discoveries in the field of chemical crystallography. His lab solved the structure of the pancreatic enzyme ribonuclease A, the third protein structure ever solved by protein crystallography.Harker was a member of the National Academy of Sciences,director of the protein structure program at the Polytechnic Institute of Brooklyn, director of the Center for Crystallographic Research at Roswell Park Cancer Institute (RPCI), and the head of the crystallography division of General Electric. After retirement from RPCI in 1976, he joined the Hauptman-Woodward Medical Research Institute (HWI), then known as the Medical Foundation of Buffalo. He remained there until his death in 1991. His research interests while at HWI turned towards mathematical aspects of crystallography, including color space groups and infinite polyhedra. Harker was awarded the Gregori Aminoff Prize from the Swedish Academy in 1984."

After the first bridge to cross the Chenango River was built, he became the first to organise roads and a school on the river's West Side. He worked to build a small settlement west of the Chenango, which he purchased from William Bingham's estate. LeRoy held the deed but for ten years made no payments on its interest or principal, so left New York insolvent with his wife and seven children. He came to the frontier of Michigan, and by January 20, 1818 was appointed Associate Justice for Macomb County, Michigan. LeRoy was first appointed by John Quincy Adams as Michigan's territorial attorney in 1826 and served until 1834. He was the first Michigan Attorney General from 1836 to 1837. From 1850 to 1862 what is now Webberville, Michigan was known as LeRoy in his honor. In 1850, LeRoy moved to Fenton, Michigan and opened its first hotel. He died there on February 11, 1858."

Slagger did not seek another term as Maliseet representative. Slagger was one of three non-voting representatives from Maine's Native American tribes in the House of Representatives. Representatives from each tribe are all elected by tribal members. Slagger did not seek another term as the Maliseet representative due to the limitations placed on tribal representatives, including the inability to vote and sponsor bills without co-sponsors. Slagger was humiliated when, during a tie vote in the Labor, Commerce, Research and Economic Development Committee on which he sat, Slagger's deciding vote was recorded but cast aside by the committee chair. In May 2012, Slagger announced a bid for the non-tribal seat in which he lived, District 22. Still running as a non-party (independent) candidate, he challenged incumbent Republican incumbent Stacy Guerin with no Democrat in the race. He received 1,299 votes (26%) and lost."

  "text" : "David Sacerdote (1550–1625) was a Jewish composer and banker active in Italy. He is the earliest known Jewish composer of polyphonic music of which any has survived. Details of his life are sketchy. He was born in Rovere, and is known to have lived in Casale, Acqui, and Cortemilia. He worked in banking throughout his life, holding concessions as a moneylender. He appears to have been an amateur musician in his youth, as he lived for half a century after the 1575 publication of his only known work, and no trace of musical activity appears during this time. Only one part-book of his one known collection of madrigals, Il primo libro di madrigali a sei voci (First book of madrigals for six voices), has survived. The collection is dedicated to his patron, Marquis Alfonso del Vasto, a member of the Gonzaga family, and is dated 25 January 1575. Published in Venice, the book includes a sonnet praising Sacerdote, by Cavaliere Nuvolone, member of a Mantuan academy founded by Cesare Gonzaga. As only one part (the quinto) survives, it is impossible to assess fully the stylistic nature of his work, but he appears to have been a competent composer working in the circle of the Mantuan court, where the contributions of Jewish musicians were appreciated, at least during the last third of the 16th century. Sacerdote's madrigals include settings of Petrarch and Ariosto. The surviving fragment of his work is in the British Museum."

Johnson received his PhD at Iowa State in 1945 under the supervision of Theodore Schultz. In the mid-1940s, a group of agricultural economists led by Schultz and Johnson moved to the University of Chicago. Johnson served as department chair from 1971-1975 and 1980-1984 and was presedent of the American Economics Association in 1999. Their research in farm and agricultural economics was widely influential and attracted funding from the Rockefeller Foundation to the agricultural economics program at the University. Among the graduate students and faculty affiliated with the pair in the 1940s and 1950s were Clifford Hardin, Zvi Griliches, Marc Nerlove, and George S. Tolley."

Scotus has had considerable influence on both Catholic and secular thought. The doctrines for which he is best known are the \"univocity of being,\" that existence is the most abstract concept we have, applicable to everything that exists; the formal distinction, a way of distinguishing between different aspects of the same thing; and the idea of haecceity, the property supposed to be in each individual thing that makes it an individual. Scotus also developed a complex argument for the existence of God, and argued for the Immaculate Conception of Mary. Duns Scotus was given the scholastic accolade Doctor Subtilis (Subtle Doctor) for his penetrating and subtle manner of thought. He was beatified by Pope John Paul II in 1993."

Das is known for his work on the beneficial properties of resveratrol, which is found in red wine, but at least twenty of his research papers have been retracted. On January 11, 2012 the University of Connecticut Health Center announced that a review board has found Das guilty of 145 counts of fabrication or falsification of data. The three-year investigation examined more than seven years of activity in Das’s lab, and centered on Western blot results that had been manipulated and used in published papers. The investigation into Das was sparked by an anonymous allegation of research irregularities in 2008. In May 2012, Das was fired from both positions at the University of Connecticut Health Center. He then sued for $35 million in damages, citing libel."

From there his fame as dance teacher and fiddler spread and in the 1980s he was invited to give lessons in Great Britain and the United States. In 1993, he fell ill and was hospitalized in Ennis General Hospital. There he drove doctors and nursing staff berserk, by keeping dancing, even in bed.

  "text" : "Deolinda Fonseca (born 1954 in Porto) is a well-known Portuguese painter who since 1979 has primarily worked in Denmark, \"which, from an artistic point of view, has been a somewhat peripheral region throughout most of its history – just like Portugal.\" She is highly regarded for her evocative oil paintings of mostly abstract themes, though with hints of realistic images. She also paints vivid portraits, in which she combines realistic representation with abstract expressionism. Her work is characterized by the kind of expressionism that oscillates between abstraction and figuration, an expressionism that connects the essence of the abstract pictorial depths, with a subtle disperse figuration. \"The artist makes us take part in an endless motion of entering and exiting the painting, expanding our vision beyond infinity or drowning it in an abyssal aperture of space and light; or on the contrary, retracts our vision to a position in front of the structural elements, pushing the canvas in our direction; or, even, makes us hover above the surface of the canvas, captivated by the dilution of the brush strokes and its contradictory gestures,\" observed the art critic Laura Castro. \"The paintings of Deolinda Fonseca are synthesized in these three movements that together configure three worlds: one that planes over the painting itself, another that drifts away towards it, and another that exists over here.\" Sinne Lundgaard Rasmussen, a Danish writer on art, has praised the \"strength\" of her paintings, saying that \"Painter and paint meet in the painting, and this is where we find Deolinda Fonseca.\" Fonseca graduated as a painter and sculptor at Faculdade de Belas-Artes do Porto in 1979, and she has lived in Denmark since then. In 2002, she received Portugal's medal of honor, the \"Order of Prince Henry\" (in Portuguese, \"Ordem do Infante D. Henrique\"), a type of knighthood. She has exhibited throughout Denmark and Portugal, as well as in other European countries, and her work is displayed in museums, embassies and private collections in Europe and the United States."

  "text" : "(For other people of this name, see David Hay (disambiguation).) David Hay (10 April 1859 – 30 October 1938) was a notable British civil engineer of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, particularly associated with design of bridges and tunnels. Hay was born in Casterton, Westmoreland in north-west England. He worked initially as a pupil of his father and was subsequently appointed as contractor's engineer on the construction of the Great Northern and London and North Western Railway joint line from Newark to Tilton and Leicester. During 1884 and 1885 he worked on a new dock at Silloth, near Carlisle, before spending three years on widening North Eastern Railway lines in and near Newcastle-upon-Tyne. He then became a protégé of Sir Benjamin Baker, working with him on the first Blackwall Tunnel in the 1890s, about which he wrote a paper with Maurice Fitzmaurice published by the Institution of Civil Engineers in 1897. Watt Medals and Telford Premiums were awarded to David Hay, M. Inst. C.E., and Maurice Fitzmaurice, B.E., M. Inst. C.E., for their joint Paper on \" The Blackwall Tunnel.\" With his business partner Basil Mott (in 1902, they formed a consulting engineering practice, Mott and Hay - later Mott, Hay and Anderson), he was involved with the design and construction of London's first deep level 'tube' lines - the City and South London Railway (today part of the Northern line) and the Central London Railway (today forming the Central line between Shepherd's Bush and the City of London). Mott and Hay were internationally recognised as authorities on underground railways, being invited to write a 1905 paper for the American Society of Civil Engineers. They were also involved with modernisation work on London bridges including Southwark Bridge and Blackfriars Bridge, the Tyne Bridge in Newcastle-upon-Tyne, and the first of the Mersey Tunnels, the Queensway Tunnel. In 1912, David Hay visited Australia to advise on a possible harbour crossing in Sydney. He died at Flimwell Grange, near Hawkhurst, Kent, on 30 October 1938."

  "text" : "David Ramsay (died c. 1653), was clockmaker to James I and Charles I. Born in Scotland he belonged to the Ramsays of Dalhousie. His son William (fl. 1660) says that when James I succeeded to the crown of England, \"he sent into France for my father, who was then there, and made him page of the bedchamber and groom of the privy chamber, and keeper of all his majesties' clocks and watches. This I mention that by some he hath bin termed no better than a watch maker. … It's confest his ingenuity led him to understand any piece of work in that nature … and therefore the king conferred that place upon him\" (Wm. Ramesay, Astrologia Restaurata, 1653, Preface to the Reader, p. 28). On 25 Nov. 1613 he was appointed clockmaker-extraordinary to the king with a pension of 50l. a year, and in March 1616 a warrant was issued for the payment to him of 234l. 10s. for the purchase and repair of clocks and watches for the king. On 26 Nov. 1618 he was appointed chief clockmaker, and on 27 July 1619 letters of denization were granted to him. Various other warrants were passed for payments for his services, and in one which bears date 17 March 1627 he is described as ‘David Ramsay, esq., our clockmaker and page of our bedchamber.’ His early works are marked ‘David Ramsay, Scotus.’ On the incorporation of the Clockmakers' Company in 1631 Ramsay became the first master, but he probably took very little part in the work of the society. Upon taking the oath before the lord mayor he was described as ‘of the city of London,’ but the city records do not furnish any evidence that he was a freeman. Scott introduces a David Ramsay, without any strict regard for historical accuracy, in the opening chapter of ‘The Fortunes of Nigel’ as the keeper of a shop ‘a few yards to the eastward of Temple Bar.’ Ramsay was also a student of the occult sciences. In William Lilly's ‘Life and Times,’ 1715, p. 32, an amusing account is given of an attempt made in 1634 by Ramsay and others to discover hidden treasure in Westminster Abbey by means of the divining rod, when the operations were interrupted by fierce blasts of wind, attributed by the terrified spectators to demons, who were, however, promptly exorcised. Sir Edward Coke, writing to Secretary Windebanke, on 9 May 1639, about a demand for money which it was inconvenient to meet, says: ‘If, now, David Ramsay can co-operate with his philosopher's stone, he would do a good service.’ There are also entries in the ‘Calendars of State Papers,’ dated 28 July 1628 and 13 Aug. 1635, relating to hidden treasure which Ramsay proposed to discover. A manuscript in the Sloane Collection, No. 1046, bearing the title ‘Liber Philosophicus, de divinis mysteriis, de Deo, Hominibus, anima, meteoris,’ is attributed to him on insufficient authority. He was also an inventor, and between 1618 and 1638 he obtained eight patents (Nos. 6, 21, 49, 50, 53, 68, 78, 117). Although the full ‘titles’ of these patents are given in the indexes published by the commissioners of patents, no information as to the precise nature of the inventions is extant. They relate to ploughing land, fertilising barren ground, raising water by fire, propelling ships and boats, manufacture of saltpetre, making tapestry without a loom, refining copper, bleaching wax, separating gold and silver from the base metals, dyeing fabrics, heating boilers, kilns for drying and burning bricks and tiles, and smelting and refining iron by means of coal (Cal. State Papers, 1619, 1622–3–5). In his later years he fell into poverty, and in 1641, while a prisoner for debt, he petitioned the House of Lords for payment of six years' arrears of his pension as groom of the privy chamber (Hist. MSS. Comm. 4th Rep. p. 110 a). Towards the payment of those arrears the committee for advance of money, by an order dated 13 Jan. 1645, granted him one third of the money arising from his discovery of delinquents' estates (Cal. of Committee for Advance of Money, i. 40). It would appear from this that he had joined the parliamentary party. On 11 Feb. 1651 there is a note in the proceedings of the council of state that a petition of David Ramsay was referred to the mint committee (Cal. State Papers, 1651–2, p. 140). Specimens of Ramsay's watches are to be found in the British Museum, in South Kensington Museum  and the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York. A watch belonging to Mrs. Holmes of Gawdy Hall, Norfolk, is described in ‘Norfolk Archæology’ (vi. 2). A technical description of several specimens is given in Britten's ‘Former Clock and Watch Makers,’ . His son William, in the dedication to his father of his ‘Vox Stellarum,’ 1652, refers to the latter's pecuniary difficulties, which gave ‘occasion to some inferior-spirited people not to value you according to what you both are by nature and in yourself.’ The date of Ramsay's death is unknown, but he appears to have been living in 1653, the postscript of his son's ‘Astrologia Restaurata’ being dated 17 Jan. of that year, ‘from my study in my father's house in Holborn, within two doors of the Wounded Hart, near the King's Gate.’ In the ‘Calendar of State Papers,’ under date 21 June 1661, there is a petition of Sir Theophilus Gilby and Mary, widow of David Ramsay, who states that she raised troops for the king's service ‘at Duke Hamilton's coming into England,’ since which time she has been sequestered and plundered. But she may possibly have been the widow of another David Ramsay, a courtier, from whom it is very difficult to distinguish the clockmaker in contemporary records."

  "text" : "Degener Buggenhagen, also spelled Degner Buggenhagen (died: 16 July 1420 in Garbodenhagen, near Stralsund) was a German nobleman and Hereditary Lord Marshal of the Duchy of Pomerania-Wolgast. He was a descendant of an ancient family of knights. As Hereditary Lord Marshal, he came into conflict with Cord Bonow, an influential Roman Catholic clergyman. Buggenhagen sided with the cities of Greifswald and Stralsund, which had a conflict with Bonow. During the conflict, the citizens of Stralsund burned three clergy at the stake. After the death of Duke Wartislaw VIII of Pomerania-Wolgast in 1415, his widow Agnes led the regency for her infant sons Barnim VIII and Swantibor IV as well as her nephews Wartislaw IX and Barnim VII. She was assisted by a council, led by Bonow. Buggenhagen was a member of this council. Buggenhagen, who was supported by the cities, killed Bonow in Groß Kiesow, near Greifswald, probably in 1417 or 1419. Duchess Agnes was so embittered that she ordered Henneke von Behr, one of her retainers, to kill Buggenhagen on 16 July 1420, when he met the young Duke Wartislaw IX at the mill of Garbodenhagen, near Stralsund, under protection of a safe conduct. The act was committed at the Duke's table. The cities of Greifswald and Stralsund demanded revenge and in 1421, von Behr and his helpers were executed in Stralsund. Deeply impressed by these events, Duke Wartislaw IX agreed in 1421 with the cities and the nobility to establish a court of law, where such conflicts could be resolved peacefully."

  "text" : "Donald McNaughton Stuart (1819 – 12 May 1894) was a New Zealand presbyterian minister and educationalist. Stuart was the son of Alexander Stewart* and Janet (McNaughton) his wife, was born in the hamlet of Styx Kenmore, or Stichs, Perthshire, Scotland. In 1837 he started a school at Leven, Perthshire, and two years later entered at the University of St Andrews. Having supported Dr. Thomas Chalmers for the Lord Rectorship after the disruption, he was expelled, with the majority of the students, for refusing to submit to an admonition from the senators. A Royal Commission shortly afterwards reinstated the extruded students, but Dr. Stuart removed from St. Andrews to New College, Edinburgh, where he was a theological student under Dr. Chalmers. In 1844 Stuart was appointed classical master, and subsequently principal, of a private secondary school at Upton Park, Eton, and in July 1848 was married at Slough, Windsor, to Miss Jessie Robertson. He commenced studying for the ministry in London and completed his curriculum in Edinburgh, being licensed by the Free Presbytery of Kelso to the Presbyterian church of Falstone, North Northumberland, where he remained for ten years. In January 1860 Dr. Stuart arrived in Dunedin to take up the position of first minister of Knox Church. He was also chairman of the boys and girls' high schools of Otago, and Chancellor of the University of Otago. Stuart died at Dunedin on 12 May 1894. He is uniquely commemorated by having two public statues in his honour in Dunedin, a seated figure in The Exchange and a bust outside Knox Church. Both the Rev and his sister, my gt gt grandmother were christianed Stewart after their father Alexander Stewart NOT Stuart. They seemed to have changed their surname to Stuart in Otago although there are references to him in early days in Dunedin as Stewart."

He has worked as the first permanent correspondent of Romanian Television in Moldova since July 2007 He also worked as the news department director at the first news television of Moldova, Jurnal TV (2010-July 2011). Before 2009, Dendiu worked in Chişinău for NIT and EU TV. His arrest during the 2009 Moldova civil unrest provoked a notable reaction within the media community. \"Doru Dendiu working for Romanian public television TVR was even arrested while he was about to appear on the Romanian lunchtime news and was told a few days later that his accreditation was being withdrawn\" wrote Reporters Without Borders. On April 10, 2009, Moldovan communist authorities arrested Doru Dendiu and Rodica Mahu, for their alleged involvement in organizing the riots. Dendiu was arrested at around 12:00am and taken to the Organised Crime Department within the Ministry of Internal Affairs (Moldova). Nobody had any contact with Dendiu until his release after 6 hours, at around 6 o’clock p.m. During his detention Dendiu had no access to a lawyer and his cell phone was confiscated. They also denied his right to contact the Embassy of Romania. Mahu and Dendiu were released from police questioning later that day. On April 11, 2009, Dendiu was invited to the Moldova's Foreign Ministry where his accreditation was withdrawn under the pretext of alleged violations of Regulation on accreditation of journalists, after which he was obliged to leave the country on April 14. Doru Dendiu returned to Chişinău after July 2009 election and worked as the News department director at Jurnal TV."

  "text" : "Dardan Gashi is a Kosovo Albanian politician and author who was Minister for Environment and Planning from 2011 until 2014. Born in Kosovo, Gashi moved to Austria where he studied Communication Sciences and Political Sciences in the University of Vienna. After completing his degree, he went on to begin his career as an election supervisor with the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) Mission in Bosnia and Herzegovina. In 1997, he became the Election Officer, Head of Field Office in Brcko Federation. Later that year, he moved to Croatia, in the capacity of Human Rights Monitor, and spent the next year in various posts as part of OSCE missions in the Balkans. During the Kosovo War, Gashi worked with the Kosovo Verification Mission as a Public Information Liaison Officer, OSCE Secretariat in Vienna. After the war, he resumed his work with OSCE, and contributed to plans for institution-building, media policy and elections and registration. In 2000, he contributed to the International Crisis Group, United Nations Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY), European Stability Initiative, etc. From 2005 to 2008, Gashi worked at the office of the Deputy Prime Minister/Ministry of Local Government Administration in Kosovo. Initially, he chaired the working group on decentralization, and participated as a senior adviser at all meetings during the Vienna Negotiations. Meanwhile, Gashi also chaired the WG on Return within the Direct Dialogue process with Belgrade. In June 2010, Gashi became Deputy Minister of European Integration. He held this position until January 2011, when he was proposed to become the Minister of Environment, following the national elections of 2010. During Dardan Gashi’s mandate, the Ministry of Environment and Spatial Planning has managed to approximate the legislation of the Republic of Kosovo with the European Union. Regarding the air pollution, MESP has forced large corporations, also known as the largest polluters (Kosovo Energy Corporation, Ferronikel, Sharrcem, etc.) to install filters to prevent further air pollution. In November, 2011, at the request of the Minister Gashi, the Kosovo Government stopped the illegal sand and gravel exploitation in the rivers basins of Kosovo. This decision was applauded by citizens and NGOs as one of the best decisions necessary for the protection of environment. Since then, the illegal exploitation of inert materials has stalled, resulting in investments by MESP and municipalities for the reconstruction of river banks. In the field of spatial planning, Minister Gashi, in collaboration with USAID, was committed to reforming the Law on Construction. After reforming the application process for a construction permit, Kosovo’s ranking in Doing Business Report has increased from 177 to 144, in 2012. In addition to politics, Gashi wrote/co-authored several books, including Im Dienst des Diktators, Albanien: archaisch, orientalisch, europaeisch, Durch das Land der Hirten und Helden, etc."

Next he graduated from the Iron City Commercial College in Pittsburgh in 1866. Gregg later received the degree of D.D. from the New York University in 1888. He was educated as a Scotch Covenanter (Presbyterian) and at the age of twenty-three began preaching at the Scotch church on West Twenty-Third Street in New York. He later became pastor of Park Street Church in Boston on February 1, 1887 until 1890. From 1890 to 1903, Gregg was pastor of the Lafayette Avenue Presbyterian Church in Brooklyn, New York. In 1892, to mark the 400th anniversary of the arrival of Christopher Columbus in the Americas, he preached a sermon series in Brooklyn honoring the contributions of \"our American foremothers\" and \"our African American forefathers.\" After leaving Brooklyn, he became president of Western Theological Seminary in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Gregg married Kate Etheridge in New York in 1871 and they had several children. Gregg's family traces its ancestry directly back to the Scotch Covenanters of 1638. Gregg considered himself an abolitionist and delivered his first public speech in support of the Emancipation Proclamation. During Lee's invasion into Pennsylvania, Gregg enlisted as an \"emergency man\" in Camp Howe to replace Union troops heading to Gettysburg. Gregg died in 1919."

  "text" : "Doug Yingst is an American ice hockey executive. He was the President and General Manager of the Hershey Bears of the American Hockey League, a dual-position he held from the 1998–99 AHL season to the 2015–16 AHL season. Yingst is a two time winner of the James C. Hendy Memorial Award, which is awarded annually to the executive who has made the most outstanding contribution to the American Hockey League. Hershey Bears President/GM Doug Yingst enters his 31st season with the organization in 2012-13, after overseeing the team’s 11th Calder Cup championship two seasons ago. Hershey's back-to-back titles in 2009 and 2010, as well as the club’s win in 2006 have all come under Yingst’s stewardship and the team’s affiliation with the Washington Capitals. Working in tandem with Washington VP/GM George McPhee, Yingst once again brought the front line talent and necessary roster depth to central PA as the Bears defeated the Texas Stars four games to two in the 2010 Calder Cup Finals. It marked the first time in AHL history a team rallied to win after losing the first two games of the series at home, and for Yingst, it was his fourth Calder Cup victory. The four championships tie an AHL record, jointly held by several, including Frank Mathers. The Bears have recorded the best five-year run in American Hockey League history, winning three titles and advancing to a fourth Final appearance in 2007. With no fewer than 27 teams in the league during that time, the Chocolate and White have played hockey in June four times since 2006. For his efforts, Yingst was presented with the Thomas Ebright Award, given for outstanding service to the AHL. Yingst also claimed the James Hendy Award in 2006, presented to the outstanding executive of the year in the league. He is only one of four men in league history to win the award twice. During the current affiliation agreement with the Capitals, the Bears posted an American Hockey League record 60 wins in 2009-10, and also won a then-franchise record 51 games in 2006-07 under current Washington head coach Bruce Boudreau. The agreement between the two franchises has not only produced many players for the NHL level, but also two members of the coaching staff that have worked closely with Yingst. Boudreau was promoted in November, 2007 to become Washington’s head coach, and Bob Woods was named the team’s assistant coach in the summer of 2009. Woods claimed the 2009 Calder Cup title, following in Boudreau’s footsteps soon after. Current head coach Mark French then won the 2010 title, the third straight coach under Yingst to win a title.Yingst has been Hershey's President/GM since the 1998-99 season, and represents the club on the AHL’s Board of Governors. In 2010-11, he was named the chairman of the league’s Executive Committee, and has served previously as chairman of the AHL’s Competition and Marketing Committees. Yingst was first named Hershey's general manager in 1996-97, winning the Calder Cup in his first season with new job responsibilities. From 1991-96, he was the Assistant GM/Director of Hockey Operations for the team, and from 1988-91 served as Assistant General Manager under the legendary Frank S. Mathers. Yingst began his long run in the Hershey organization as the sales and promotions director in 1982, and also won the AHL’s Ken McKenzie award in 1988, given annually by the AHL to the person judged to have done the most to promote his team. One of Yingst’s greatest accomplishments in hockey came in February of 2000, when his Hershey Jr. Bears hockey team won the 2000 Quebec Cup in Quebec City. It was a feat repeated in February of 2009 and again in February, 2010 when the Jr. Bears repeated as Quebec Cup champions, the same two years that Hershey won back-to-back Calder Cup titles. Often compared to the Little League World Series in the United States, the Quebec Pee-Wee International Cup tournament brings more than 100 youth hockey teams to Quebec City every year. Yingst has been called into service from time-to-time as Hershey's assistant coach, most recently in 2007 when Bruce Boudreau was named head coach of the Washington Capitals. In 2003, with head coach Mike Foligno hospitalized, Yingst teamed with interim head coach Paul Fixter to win Game 3 of the 2003 Western Conference Quarterfinals over the Chicago Wolves. It was also the first playoff game win for the Bears in Giant Center history.A terrific all-around athlete, Yingst is a charter member of the Palmyra High School Sports Hall-of-Fame. He was inducted into the Central Chapter of the Pennsylvania Sports Hall of Fame in November of 2000."

  "text" : "Daniel Louis Mundy was a notable New Zealand photographer. Not much is known about Mundy's early life in England apart from that he married Louisa Rust in Hackney, London in 1856. They arrived in Dunedin, New Zealand in 1864 and purchased William Meluish's photographic business. In 1865 he moved to Christchurch. It was in Christchurch where Mundy photographed Moa skeletons under the commission of Julius von Haast for the Canterbury Museum. These photographs were then reprinted for the Illustrated London News. In 1867 he was commissioned to photograph a portrait of Governor George Grey. Mundy was originally a portrait photographer but in 1869 he travelled New Zealand taking views and selling prints of the New Zealand landscape. In 1873, the New Zealand Government used some of these prints for the Vienna Exhibition and in 1875 he published a book called Rotomahana - The Boiling Spring of NZ. Also that year, Mundy's only child was born in Port Chalmers. In 1874, Mundy moved to England to further his career prospects. He gave a talk to the Photographic Society of Great Britain about his experiences of taking pictures around New Zealand. This seminar became the basis of an article which Mundy had published in the British publication Photographic News. In 1875, Mundy relocated to Australia where he died in 1881."

  "text" : "Dwight Harding (1834 – July 3, 1904) was a butcher, miner and the 5th mayor of Missoula, Montana. He was born in Tunkhancock, Pennsylvania in 1834 and left home for the first time in 1856 when he moved to Minnesota. He headed west into the Canadian territory two years later and returned to the United States in 1863 after being employed by American surveyors to help establish the US–Canada border. Harding joined the gold rush in Montana's Alder Gulch and spent the next several years in various gold camps in western Montana before finally settling in Missoula in 1866. Harding brought \"Harding and Company\" to Missoula to engage in the butchering business. He returned to mining for two years, bought and sold a ranch, and finally returned to butchering in Missoula where he became the principal member of two establishments. In 1874, Harding ran for Sheriff of Missoula County as a Republican but was defeated by John Miller when Democrats won all the seats that year except those of Daniel Woodman and Missoula co-founder Frank Worden who ran as Republicans. He lost again two years later running on the People's Party ticket when the Democratic Party had again swept the election. He was elected mayor on May 3, 1887, and would remain in the position for one year. He died July 3, 1904 and is buried in Missoula Cemetery."

  "text" : "David Millar Clark CBE FBA FMedSci (born 20 August 1954) is a British psychologist. He has been a Professor of Psychology at the University of Oxford since 2011 and is also National Clinical Adviser at the Department of Health. His clinical research and practice has mainly focused on developing cognitive models and cognitive therapy for anxiety disorders. Clark was instrumental, with the economist Richard Layard, in the development and implementation of the Improving Access to Psychological Therapies programme from 2003. Clark was born in Darlington and studied experimental psychology at Oxford University. He trained as a clinical psychologist at the Institute of Psychiatry. He then returned to teach at Oxford University where he became a professor, then returned to the IOP where in 2000 he became head of psychology and founded the centre for anxiety disorders and trauma at the IOP and associated Maudsley Hospital along with fellow Oxford psychologists trauma-specialist Anke Ehlers and OCD-specialist Paul Salkovskis. Clark has won numerous awards in the UK and the USA. His research has focused on panic disorder, hypochondriasis, social phobia and posttraumatic stress disorder. Clark was strongly influenced by the American psychiatrist Aaron T. Beck who made long visits to Oxford University in the 70s and 80s, whose head of psychiatry Michael Gelder strongly believed in cognitive therapy. Clark was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 2013 New Year Honours for services to mental health. In 2014, with Layard, he published the book Thrive: The Power of Evidence-Based Psychological Therapies, in which the authors demonstrate the potential value of the wider availability of modern talking therapies. He is married to the psychologist Anke Ehlers."

  "text" : "Valeriu Victor Boboc (May 5, 1985 - April 8, 2009) was a protester who died in police custody amid the post-election protests in Chişinău, Moldova. The initial official cause was smoke poisoning from the riot, but his family insisted that he was beaten to death by the police, his body being full of contusions. \"The General Prosecutor’s Office has reported that his death was due to poisoning with unknown substances, while his family allege that he died as a result of injuries inflicted by the police\" wrote Amnesty International in April 2009. According to 2009 Human Rights Report of the United States Department of State, a British forensics expert examined Boboc's body after it was exhumed on June 15, 2009 and concluded that Boboc was killed by severe blows to his head. Only after a new ruling coalition came to power, an investigation was opened into the case and a policeman was arrested on charges of Boboc's murder. \"Foreign and national experts determined the death was as a result of injuries caused to Valeriu Boboc and not caused by an unknown, poisoning gas, as was said immediately after the tragedy,\" said the new Prosecutor General Valeriu Zubco in January 2010. Valeriu Boboc was posthumously decorated, by a presidential decree, with Moldova's highest state decoration – the Order of the Republic. \"April 7 events opened the way of Moldova to Europe and Boboc is no longer just a name, but a symbol of struggle for democratic values and freedom of expression.\" Established in 2010, \"Valeriu Boboc\" Prize is awarded annually by the Senate of Romania for \"defending the fundamental human rights and democratic values\"."

Avison spent the bulk of his photographic career in Chicago before moving to Boston in 1997. Avison received his Ph.D. in Physics from Brown University in 1966 and an M.S. in photography from the Illinois Institute of Chicago's Institute of Design. He worked as an instructor of physics at Brown University from 1959 to 1966 and an instructor of physics at Purdue University from 1967 to 1969. Combining his love of physics and photography, Avison designed and built his own panoramic cameras which he used to take all of his photographs. Two of Avison's handmade cameras as well as models and notes were donated to the George Eastman House on his death in 2004."

  "text" : "Donald M. Eigler is an American physicist associated with the IBM Almaden Research Center, who is noted for his achievements in nanotechnology. In 1989, he was the first to use a scanning tunneling microscope tip to arrange individual atoms on a surface, famously spelling out the letters \"IBM\" with 35 xenon atoms. He later went on to create the first quantum corrals, which are well-defined quantum wave patterns of small numbers of atoms, and nanoscale logic circuits using individual molecules of carbon monoxide. He shared the 2010 Kavli Prize in Nanoscience with Nadrian Seeman for these breakthroughs. Eigler's 1989 research, along with Erhard K. Schweizer, involved a new use of the scanning tunneling microscope, which had been invented in the mid 1980s by Gerd Binnig and Heinrich Rohrer, also of IBM. The microscope had previously been used for atomic-resolution imaging, but this was the first time it had been used as an active technique, to precisely position individual atoms on a surface. The technique requires vacuum conditions and ultra-cold temperatures achieved by liquid helium cooling, and was featured on the cover of the journal Nature. At the time, it was seen as a potential first step towards applications in mechanosynthesis, where chemical reactions could be manipulated one molecule at a time. Eigler's 2002 research, along with Andreas J. Heinrich, used a cascade of collisions of carbon monoxide molecules to perform logic operations. Eigler graduated from the University of California, San Diego with a bachelor's degree in 1975 and a doctoral degree in 1984. He was postdoctoral staff at AT&T Bell Labs for two years, and then moved to IBM where he was appointed IBM Fellow in 1993. He retired from IBM in 2011."

He lived c1270 AD, but depending on which ancient manuscript is believed, he either lived “on Cheviot as a mountain bard” or in Berwick. His writings are described as being “in Latin”. The sole work which is attributed to him is The Laidly Worm of Spindleston Heugh of which he is allegedly the author. It is the tale of a loathsome (or in Geordie dialect, \"laidly\") giant monster, and was later modified by the Rev. Robert Lambe, Vicar of Norham and many other later writers. The version by Lambe appears in Rhymes of Northern Bards edited by John Bell and published in 1812. Among the other early publication relating this tale are the 1809 version in “The Northumberland Garland” and “The Local Historian's Table Book of Remarkable Occurrences, Historical Facts, Traditions, Legendary and Descriptive Ballads, &c., &c., Connected with the Counties of Newcastle-upon-Tyne, Northumberland and Durham.

Dorothea Maria zu Salm was the daughter of Prince Leopold Philipp Karl zu Salm and Countess Maria Anna von Bronckhorst-Batenburg, Heiress of Anholt. She was elected Coadjutrice as a child, with the right to succeed the existing abbess, Anne Marie Thérèse de Lorraine. She was chosen by dispensation from the Pope, despite being below the elective age of 25. The abbess at the time was also a child, and Remiremont was ruled by the Dame Doyenne, Hélène d'Anglure, and the Dame Sonière Bernarde de Cléron de Saffre (fl. 1704). When Anne Marie Thérèse de Lorraine died in 1661, Dorothea Maria succeeded her, with the same guardian government. Hélène d'Anglure died in 1666, but her successor as Dame Doyenne, Bernarde de Cléron de Saffre, refused to resign her regency to Dorothea Maria. In 1677, Dorothea Maria moved to the chateau Neuviller-sur-Moselle 3 days from Remiremont and engaged in a long lasting conflict about her rights to rule Remiremont. In 1691, both parties appeared before the French monarch as mediator. Dorothea Maria appointed her sister Christina of Salm as \"Second-in-Command\" in 1700, and Christina was therefore made regent in Remiremont during the minority of Béatrice Hiéronyme de Lorraine in 1702-1711."

  "text" : "Daniel Marc Borislow (September 21, 1961 – July 21, 2014) was an American entrepreneur, sports team owner, inventor, and thoroughbred horse breeder. Originating in the Philadelphia, Pennsylvania area, Borislow attended Widener University and worked in cable construction and landscaping before going into the telephone business. He founded Tel-Save, Inc. to resell access to AT&T long-distance lines in 1989. Borislow took the company public in 1995, and two years later brokered a $100 million deal with AOL that made it the exclusive telephone service of its users. At its peak in early 1998, Tel-Save had sales of $300 million and was valued by Wall Street investors at $2 billion. However, due to the financial strain of paying off the AOL deal, Tel-Save lost $221 million in 1999, and Borislow sold his stock for a reported $200 to $300 million and retired. In his brief retirement, he focused on his horse racing career, sending Talk is Money to the 2001 Kentucky Derby although the thoroughbred did not complete the race. Borislow's most successful horse yet has been Toccet, who won four graded stakes, among which are the Champagne and Hollywood Futurity in 2002. After selling most of his horses in 2004, Borislow set forth plans for a new voice-over-IP business which became the magicJack. Invented in 2007, the magicJack is a small product which can be plugged into a computer's USB port and allows for unlimited calling from regular telephones. In 2010, YMAX, the company behind the magicJack, merged with an Israeli company and became a publicly traded corporation. In 2011, Borislow purchased a controlling share of the Washington Freedom women's professional soccer team. He had a brief turbulent relationship with other owners and the players which ended in a battle of law suits and the termination of the soccer team and league. Borislow and his family lived in Palm Beach County, Florida, where, through D&K Charitable Foundation, Borislow issued grants to charitable causes. Borislow died from an apparent heart attack or myocardial infarction on July 21, 2014."

He was born in Auckland, New Zealand. Eminent New Zealand author Sir James McNeish researched and wrote a biography of Paddy Costello entitled  The Sixth Man: the extraordinary life of Paddy Costello (Random House, 2007). In the preface to this book, Philip Knightley writes that \"This long overdue biography sets the record straight. It convincingly shows that the slim evidence for the traitor charge was invented, exaggerated and misinterpreted.\" Paddy Costello also features in McNeish's multiple biography Dance of the Peacocks: New Zealanders in exile in the time of Hitler and Mao Tse Tung (Vintage, 2003)  about five exceptional New Zealanders, four of them Rhodes scholars, who became caught up in the turmoil of their time. Costello was the sixth man."

He has found fame for adding his tag, always simply the word Tox followed by a number indicating the year, in a very large number of locations across the London Underground network and walls around London and Glasgow.He was convicted of criminal damage in June 2011 and imprisoned after a history of ignoring ASBOs. Prosecutor Hugo Lodge told the court: \"He is no Banksy. He doesn't have the artistic skills, so he has to get his tag up as much as possible.\" After his trial Ben Eine, another graffiti artist, criticised his work, saying: \"His statement is Tox, Tox, Tox, Tox, over and over again.\" he said that the tags are \"incredibly basic\" and lacking \"skill, flair or unique style\". A sentence of 27 months was later passed, the judge commenting \"There is nothing artistic about what you do\". Banksy created a mural in Camden Town, close to Halpin's home, showing a small boy blowing bubbles that formed the Tox tag after his imprisonment. It is not clear whether the image was a sign of support or further criticism of his simplistic style. Halpin was selling canvases bearing his tag for £75 each in 2009."

In 1948 he published his first novel, The Cunninghams in the United States. He finished Freeman’s Bay, a novel about Auckland working-class life, in 1950, but it was not accepted by either his American or his New Zealand publisher. He married the painter Jean Vivienne Margaret Heise in 1950, with whom he had a son. In 1954 he moved with his family to London, where he continued working as a journalist and author. In 1966, the family returned to New Zealand. Ballantyne died at his home in Ponsonby in inner-city Auckland in 1986. He published eight novels, of which the first The Cunninghams and the fifth, Sydney Bridge Upside Down are recognised as New Zealand literary classics."

  "text" : "Dorothea Frances Bleek aka Dorothy F. Bleek (26 March 1873 Mowbray, Cape - 27 June 1948 Newlands, Cape)  was an anthropologist and philologist known for her research on the Bushmen (the San people) of southern Africa. She was born into her profession as the fifth daughter of Wilhelm Bleek, a pioneering philologist studying the languages and cultures of southern Africa in the late 1800s. Much of his work was done in partnership with his sister-in-law (Dorothy Bleek's aunt) Lucy Lloyd. The work of Dorothy Bleek was largely a continuation of her father and aunt's research, but she also made numerous notable contributions of her own to the field. Her culminating work, published after death, was the book A Bushman Dictionary, still referenced today. Laurens van der Post, who liked to think of himself as \"a white Bushman\", credited her book Mantis and His Hunter (along with Specimens of Bushman Folklore by Wilhelm H. I. Bleek and Lucy C. Lloyd, her father and aunt) as \"a sort of Stone Age Bible\". This is in the introduction to The Heart of the Hunter (1961), a follow-up to The Lost World of the Kalahari, the book based on the BBC series that brought the Bushmen to international attention. Bleek's research and findings are often overshadowed by the work of her father, and she has been criticised for lacking the empathy and intuition of him and her aunt. This has led to a perception of her as a racist. Despite this, Bleek's research on the language, customs, and especially rock art of the African native populations in present-day South Africa, Tanzania, Botswana, and Namibia stands as a vital contribution to scholarship on the region. Her photographs and audio recordings were especially important to later researchers."

  "text" : "Donald Lang (born c. 1945) was charged with having killed two prostitutes in Chicago, in 1965 and 1971. The cases achieved national attention because Lang could not be convicted as he was deaf, unable to read or write, and did not know lip-reading or sign language. Lang, an African-American, was 6 years old when his parents divorced; subsequently his mother could no longer afford tuition for his special training. Lang had worked at Chicago truck loading docks when he was charged with murder in 1965, shortly after the death of his mother. He had picked up a prostitute who was found stabbed to death the next day. Police found blood stained clothes in Lang's home. When the case could not go to trial, he was ordered confined to a mental hospital in order to learn sign language so that he could stand trial. When this failed, his lawyer pressed for a trial; a key witness had died, the case was dismissed and Lang was freed in February 1971. Five months after his release, another prostitute was killed in Chicago. Blood stains were found on Lang's clothes and he was arrested again. The case went to trial. As one piece of evidence, prosecutors introduced a drawing Lang had made during his interrogation, showing a woman with an \"X\" drawn over her. He was convicted in 1972 by a jury and sentenced to 14–25 years in prison. In both cases he was represented by the deaf attorney Lowell J. Myers. The verdict was overturned in 1975 by an appellate court, ruling that Lang had not been able to adequately defend himself. Lang was then confined to mental institutions and jails and periodically retested for his ability to stand trial. The Illinois Department of Mental Health refused to train him in sign language since he did not suffer from a mental disease. As of 2005 he remained confined in a Chicago treatment center. According to one of his lawyers, tests have shown that Lang has an IQ of 128. His former boss called him an honest young man who took pride in his work. One of his language teachers described him as \"warm and gentle\" until he becomes agitated. Lang's story was related in the 1974 book Dummy by Ernest Tidyman and in the 1979 TV movie Dummy starring LeVar Burton. Much of the investigation was conducted by Chicago Police Department homicide detective Jim Padar, who's now a writer and multi-time Moth StorySLAM champion."

Hatzis was born in Ioannina (Epirus) northwestern Greece, the son of the author and journalist, Georgios Hatzis. He graduated from the Zosimaia school in his home land. In 1930, after the death of his father, he succeeded him as director of the newspaper Epirus. In 1932-1934 he was influenced by marxist ideologies and joined the Communist Party of Greece. In 1936 he was arrested by the regime of Ioannis Metaxas for communist activity. Hatzis got involved in the Greek Civil War (1946-1949), where he joined the Democratic Army of Greece (DSE). As a result, following the Left's defeat, he went into exile and until the legalization of the Greek Communist Party in 1975, he lived in various socialist countries in Eastern Europe. Famous works of Hatzis include: \n* Το τέλος της μικρής μας πόλης (The end of our small town), 1960. \n* Ανυπεράσπιστοι (Defenceless), 1966. \n* Το Διπλό Βιβλίο (The double book), 1976, considered as one of the most important novels in post-war Greek literature. \n* Σπουδές (Studies), 1976."

  "text" : "David Krech (March 27, 1909 – July 14, 1977) was a Russian-born American experimental and social psychologist who lectured predominately at the University of California, Berkeley. Throughout his education and career endeavors, Krech was influenced by and collaborated with many psychologists including Edward Tolman, Karl Lashley, and Rensis Likert. Krech was born as Yitzhok-Eizik Krechevsky, but changed his name to Isadore Krechevsky upon emigration to the United States in 1913. His name was changed to David Krech in 1943 when he married Hilda Sidney Gruenberg. He did this because he did not want his future son(s) to be labeled with a Jewish name that had held him back in both academic and career pursuits. Krech extensively researched rats in several university laboratories and found evidence that supported the localization theory of the brain. Later in his career, Krech became interested in the topic of Social Psychology which led him to publishing Theory and Problems of Social Psychology in 1948 with Richard S. Crutchfield (revised into Individual in Society, 1962). Krech also lectured at many universities on the topic of Social Psychology, Experimental Psychology, and others. Because of his involvement in Social Psychology, Krech was appointed by Thurgood Marshall to give expert testimony in the Briggs vs. Elliot court case regarding the \"Separate but equal\" law. This was the first federal court case that allowed a social psychologist to provide expert testimony. Toward the end of his research career, Krech collaborated with Melvin Calvin, Edward L. Bennett, and Mark R. Rosenzweig to research the relationship between brain chemistry and behavior in rats."

  "text" : "Danilo Restivo (born April 1972) is an Italian man serving a life sentence with a 40-year tariff in Britain for the 12 November 2002 murder of Heather Barnett in Bournemouth, England. Investigators suspected Restivo had murdered Barnett because of his involvement in the 12 September 1993 disappearance of Elisa Claps in Potenza, but they were unable to charge him because of lack of evidence. Subsequent to the 2010 discovery of Claps's body, Restivo was tried for the murder of Barnett, with evidence of similarities in ritualistic placing of hair on the bodies of Claps and Barnett being heard by the English court. He was found guilty of murdering Barnett, and later convicted in absentia of the murder of Claps by an Italian court. Lawyers for Omar Benguit, convicted for the 12 July 2002 murder of a Korean woman, Jong Ok-Shin, in Bournemouth, suggested that Restivo may have committed the crime. Benguit was granted an appeal hearing. In April 2014 his conviction was upheld."

  "text" : "Dorothy Bailey Cline Custer (May 30, 1911 – April 22, 2015) was an American comedian, harmonicist, and centenarian most famous for her two appearances on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno. She has since become the subject of the most-viewed story of all time on the website of Boise-based television station KTVB and has been the subject of numerous interviews in Idaho and other states. Custer was born in 1911 in Hailey and grew up in Rock Creek south of present-day Hansen. She attended the College of Idaho and taught school in Murtaugh in the early 1930s. In 1937, she married Marvin Custer, who claimed descent from George Armstrong Custer. The couple moved to Twin Falls in 1939. Custer began working as an amateur entertainer in 1916, eventually creating 13 characters as part of her stand-up routine. She had been an active harmonica player since 1923 and featured music in many of her acts, including her performances on the Tonight Show. Despite her long career, by her own admission Custer didn't achieve fame until after her first appearance on the Tonight Show in 2011 at age 100. Custer was asked back later to Tonight Show where she sang \"Let Me Call You Sweetheart\" to Jay on Valentine's Day 2012. In May 2012, Custer celebrated her 101st birthday by ziplining in the Snake River Canyon. Author and physician Jacob M. Appel honored Custer by modeling a minor character after her in his novel The Man Who Wouldn't Stand Up (2012); in a 2013 interview, Custer said she was flattered by the honor but acknowledged not having read the book. In June 2013, Custer celebrated her 102nd birthday by BASE jumping off the Perrine Bridge into the Snake River Canyon. She became the oldest BASE jumper with the help of Sean Chuma a world-renowned base jumper and BASE jumping instructor. Custer died in her sleep on April 22, 2015, shortly before her 104th birthday."

  "text" : "Dina (Vera) Mironovna Pronicheva (Ukrainian: Діна Миронівна Пронічева, Dina Mironivna Pronicheva; January 7, 1911 in Chernihiv, Ukraine – 1977) was a Soviet Jewish actress at the Kiev Puppet Theatre, and a survivor of the September 29–30, 1941 Babi Yar massacre in Kiev. Initially she tore up her identity card and claimed that she was not Jewish and was only seeing someone off, but the Germans decided to kill her anyway so that she would not be a witness. She was then ordered to march to the ravine, to be forced to undress and then be shot. Jumping before being shot and falling on other bodies, she played dead in a pile of corpses. She held perfectly still while the Nazis continued to shoot the wounded or gasping victims. Although the SS had covered the mass grave with earth, she eventually managed to climb through the soil and escape. Since it was dark, she had to avoid the flashlights of the Nazis finishing off the remaining victims still alive, wounded and gasping in the grave. She was one of the very few survivors of the massacre. At least 28 other survivors are known. However, she was the only survivor to testify afterwards at the January 24, 1946 Kiev-based war-crimes trial. She later related her horrifying story to writer Anatoly Kuznetsov, who incorporated it into his novel Babi Yar, published in Yunost in 1966."

  "text" : "Damien Conrad Bona (March 18, 1955 – January 29, 2012) was an American film historian, writer, film critic and journalist. Bona co-authored the 1986 reference book, \"Inside Oscar: The Unofficial History of the Academy Awards,\" a definitive history of the Academy Awards with Mason Wiley, a former classmate at Columbia University. In 1982, Bona quit his job as a Manhattan lawyer and moved to Los Angeles, where he and Wiley embarked on extensive research to write a reference guide to Oscar history from the first ceremony in 1929. Much of the research was conducted at the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences library in Beverly Hills, California. The two missed their original publication deadline of November 1982. They submitted the final copy two years later with updates on the 1985 Academy Awards. Co-author Wiley died in 1994. Bona was the sole author of the book's sequel, \"Inside Oscar 2,\" which was released in 2002 and covered the Academy Awards from 1995 through 2000. Bona was born in Sharon, Connecticut, and raised in New Milford. He earned a bachelor's degree in English in 1977 from Columbia University, where he worked as a film critic for the university newspaper, the Columbia Daily Spectator. He earned a law degree from the New York University School of Law in 1980. He worked as a lawyer in Manhattan for two years before resigning and temporarily moving to Los Angeles where he and Mason Wiley began researching their book on the Academy Awards. After their research in Los Angeles, both Bona and Wiley moved back to New York City. Bona is the author of two other books, \"Opening Shots: The Unusual, Unexpected, Potentially Career Threatening First Roles That Launched the Careers of 70 Hollywood Stars\" (1994) and \"Starring John Wayne as Genghis Kahn: Hollywood's All-Time Worst Casting Blunders\" (1996). Bona died in Manhattan of sudden cardiac arrest on January 29, 2012, at the age of 56."
