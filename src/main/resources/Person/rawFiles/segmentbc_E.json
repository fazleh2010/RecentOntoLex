  "text" : "Empress Chen (died 1596) was a Chinese Empress consort of the Ming Dynasty, married to the Longqing Emperor. The future emperor Longqing married Lady Chen after the death of his first primary spouse and son. Upon his succession to the throne in 1567, he declared Chen to be his empress. In 1569, however, she lost favor with the emperor and was moved to a separate palace. She became ill after her move, and was not given proper care. When an official pointed this out to the emperor, he stated that empress Chen was prone to illness and did not have any son and therefore had to be removed, and that the official did not understand his domestic affairs. Another reason for her removal was reportedly that she had at one occasion made the emperor angry by criticizing his indulgence in women and music. Chen, however, were kindly treated by the crown prince, who took to habit of always visiting her on his way to his father and mother. When the crown prince became emperor in 1572, he granted her as well as his mother the title of empress dowager, and reportedly always treated her with the respect a son was due to his mother, as was customary for a son to the main spouse of his father."

  "text" : "Empress Fang (1516-1547), was a Chinese Empress consort of the Ming Dynasty, third empress to the Jiajing Emperor. Fang originated from the area of Nanjing. She was selected for palace service in 1531, and chosen as a concubine for the emperor. She was described as beautiful and talented. However, she refused to use bribes to improve her chances of being selected to share the bed of the emperor, and as the emperor did not wish to have sexual intercourse with women over the age of fifteen, her chance to experience a sexual life was therefore was soon past, which reportedly caused her great sorrow and emotional loss. In 28 January 1534, nine days after the deposition of Empress Zhang, Fang was nevertheless chosen by the emperor to succeed as empress consort of the imperial court. The choice was made upon her because she supported him in his feud with his officials concerning the rituals of the imperial ancestors. Empress Fang is described as the favorite spouse of the emperor, and is known for having saved his life during an assassination attempt. Emperor Jiajing, who was described as a strict and liable to violent outbursts, was known for his cruelty toward his female staff and palace women, reportedly having had 200 women of the palace staff beaten to death during his reign. In October 1542, sixteen palace maids formed a conspiracy to assassinate the emperor; not for political reasons, but as retaliation for his abuse. One night when the emperor was in bed with his favorite concubine, Proper Consort Cao, the sixteen maids attacked him in his bed and tried to strangle him. They stuffed his mouth, jabbed at his penis, tied a silk cord around his neck and pulled until he lost consciousness. At this moment, however, one of them, Golden Lotus Zhang, lost her nerve and left them to alert the empress, who rushed in, untied the knot and saved the life of the emperor. The emperor could not speak for long after the attack and was in a state of chock, and the empress therefore acted on his behalf and had all the sixteen women executed, including Proper Consort Cao. When he recuperated, the emperor could not believe that Cao had been involved, and as Cao had been his favorite, however, the personal relationship to empress Fang was damaged, despite the fact that she had saved his life. Although he was grateful to her for having saved his life, and granted her official honors for this, he blamed her for the loss of Cao, and their personal relationship did not improve, which is said to have caused Fang a depression. Empress Fang died in a fire in 1547. When a eunuch asked the emperor if the trapped empress should be saved, the emperor refused to answer, and she was therefore allowed to burn to death. He did nevertheless grant her all the honor after her death."

Because of the tense personal relationship between the Emperor and his aunt, however, he did not take a liking to Chen. In 1528, she became pregnant. During the pregnancy, the Emperor exposed her to a fit of rage, which caused a fatal miscarriage. The Emperor did not permit her to be buried in the imperial mausoleum: this was not done before 1567."

In 1033, her protector Empress Dowager Liu died, and Emperor Renzong was free to govern. Furious at the late Empress Dowager Liu for having passed herself of as his mother, he turned against her former allies, who now formed around Empress Guo. Empress Guo managed to have Grand Chancellor Lü Yijian exiled, but within a year, he returned and encouraged the Emperor to divorce her. The divorce cause was an argument between Empress Guo and two other women, Consort Yang and Consort Shang. The women provoked Guo until she reached out to slap them: when she did, however, they moved, which caused her slap to land upon the Emperor. He then deposed her on the grounds of violence. The deposition of Empress Guo caused a conflict between the Emperor and his ministers, who warned him that his divorce was unfilial and that it would undermine he position of an Empress and set an unacceptable precedent if in future an Emperor could depose an Empress, the mother of the people, merely for personal reasons. Empress Guo died a mysterious death in 1035. One year later, the Emperor sent Consort Yang and Consort Shang to a nunnery, and in 1037, he restored Guo to the rank of Empress."

In 1100, Huizeng succeeded his brother as emperor. The emperor was not close to his empress, but Consort Zheng competed with Consort Wang about his favor. Huizeng soon had many additional favorites, such as Wei and Quai, maids of Consort Zheng, and Consort Liu Mingda, but Zheng was not described as jealous of them. Consort Zheng was described as a beauty, a skillful dancer and singer, with an ability to amuse and flatter the emperor, and she became the mother of several of his children. In 1110, two years after the death of empress Wang, Huizong appointed Consort Zheng to the position of empress. Her elevation was somewhat controversial, as in the Song dynasty, the empresses were generally members of military and official families, and not former domestics. The influence of empress Zheng was also resented. Emperor Huizong abdicated in favor of his son Emperor Qinzong in 1126. In 1127, the capital of Kaifeng was captured by the Jurchen during the Jin–Song Wars. The Emperor Qinzong was deposed, and him, as well as his predecessor Emperor Huizong and most of the Imperial family and court, was captured and exiled to Manchuria in what was called the Jingkang Incident. The consorts, concubines and palace women of the emperors who were taken captured, were distributed among the Jurchen. Five of the consorts of Huizong were defined by the Jurchen as wives, among them empress Zheng, and allowed to remain with him and accompany him in his life in exile, partially because they were not regarded as good war prices because of their age."

  "text" : "Empress Xing (1106–1139) was a Chinese Empress consort of the Song Dynasty, married to Emperor Gaozong of Song. Xing was from Bianjing, and was selected to be the primary consort of Gaozong, then a Prince. Their marriage was conducted in 1115, when she was eight years old. In 1126, Emperor Huizong abdicated in favor of his son, Emperor Qinzong, the elder brother of Gaozong. In 1127, the capital of Kaifeng was captured by the Jurchen during the Jin–Song Wars. The Emperor Qinzong was deposed, and him, as well as his predecessor Emperor Huizong and most of the Imperial family and court, over 3000 people, was captured and exiled to Manchuria in what was called the Jingkang Incident. They were first taken to the Jurchen capital, many of them dying on the way. The Imperial consorts, concubines, palace women and eunuchs who were taken captured, were distributed among the Jurchen as slaves. Consort Xing, were among those captured and taken away. Nothing more is known of her except that she was coveted by her captors, that she attempted suicide to escape abused, but failed, and that she died in captivity in 1139. Gaozong himself, avoided capture because they were absent from the capital when it fell. Gaozong then organized the warfare against further Jurchen invasion, declaring himself Emperor in late 1127 and established the Southern Song dynasty. Knowing his primary consort Xing was still alive in captivity, he declared her to be Empress in absentia. Emperor Gaozong kept the position of Empress vacant because he did not know whether Consort Xing was still alive or not: when she died in 1139, the Jurchen kept her death a secret, and it was not until his mother, Consort Wei, was released and allowed to join him, that he learned that she was dead. Her remains was returned to be buried the same year. It was not until 1144, that he was persuaded by his mother and his ministers to appoint a new Empress, and he promoted Consort Wu to the position."

He was elected MP for Gloucestershire in 1589. He was knighted in 1595 and was High Sheriff of Gloucestershire in 1598. On 19 January 1601, he became Constable of St. Briavel's Castle and Keeper of the Forest of Dean on the death of the 2nd Earl of Pembroke. He was elected MP for Gloucestershire again in 1601. On 10 January 1609, he surrendered his posts as constable and keeper to the 3rd Earl of Pembroke. He began making iron in the Forest of Dean and purchased wood from the Crown in 1611 to do so, but this led to several disputes with the Commoners of the Forest, who were concerned that they would have no wood left for their own use. Wynter probably died before 15 March 1627, when his son, Sir John Wynter paid for 4000 cords of wood to be felled in the Forest of Dean. Wynter married Lady Anne Somerset daughter of Edward Somerset, Earl of Worcester, on 11 August 1595."

Kelley was born in Toronto, Canada, to Scottish immigrants and graduated from the University of Toronto before moving to Greenwich Village where she met Upton Sinclair, who offered her a job at Helicon Home Colony. At the colony she met Sinclair Lewis and they were engaged for two years, but she married his roommate, a poet and novelist named Allan Updegraff. She taught night school to support him and their two children. They divorced, and she took up with an artist, Fred Kelley, with whom she moved around the country and had another child. Weeds was conceived while she and Kelley lived on a tobacco farm in Scott County, Kentucky. It had some positive reviews but no commercial success; a second novel, The Devil's Hand, written while she and Kelley lived in Imperial Valley, California, was left unfinished, and wasn't printed until 1974."

  "text" : "Empress Wang (1427-1507) was a Chinese Empress consort of the Ming Dynasty, married to the Jingtai Emperor. Wang was married to Jingtai in 1449. When the elder brother of Jingtai was taken prisoner by the Mongols later that year, Jingtai became emperor, and Wang was given the position of empress by his side. Empress Wang had two daughters with the emperor, but no son. In May 1452, Jingtai declared the son of his secondary Consort Hang heir to the throne. At the same time, he promoted Hang to the position of empress, being the mother of the crown prince, and demoted Wang and stripped her of the title. After her demotion, the ex-empress Wang lived a quite life outside of the palace walls. She survived the deposition and death of Jingtai in 1457, when the rest of his concubines and spouses were ordered to commit suicide. The reason for this was possible because she had assisted the nepew of her spouse, the future Chenghua Emperor to hide from Jingtai."

  "text" : "Edward Elvines was an English politician who sat in the House of Commons in 1654. He supported the Parliamentary cause in the English Civil War. Elvines was possibly the son of William Elvines, a baker of Worcester, who left money for the poor of the town by his will of 2 April 1612. On the outbreak of the Civil War, Elvines took the parliamentary side but had to flee the county for opposing the commissioners of Array in 1642. He tried to recruit men to the parliamentary cause when the Earl of Essex went to Worcester but had to flee again when Sir William Russell took the city for the Royalists. He was away for four years while his whole estate was exposed to the enemy and he had to live on credit. When Worcester fell to Parliament in 1646 he became an Alderman of the City and a member of the Parliamentary Committee for Worcestershire. He was persuaded to become Mayor, as there was no one else they would confide in, on a faithful promise of reimbursement of all costs. However Col. Rainsborough was called away and the Committee was dissolved so he did not receive recompense. He was added to the Committee for Sequestrations in Worcestershire on 29 July 1648, and was appointed a Sub-Commissioner of Sequestrations for Worcestershire on 25 February 1650. When the Scottish army arrived at Worcester in 1651 Elvines had to flee for the third time, but returned with the parliamentary army. He was persuaded to become Mayor again which he described as \"to the hazard of his life among the sick Scots\". On 2 March 1652 the Council of State recommended the House of Commons to appoint John Coucher and Elvines, aldermen of Worcester, to be J.P.s for the City. He was appointed one of the three Sequestration Commissioners for Worcestershire on 14 December 1653, and another order of 10 January 1654 made the appointment void. In 1654, Elvines was elected Member of Parliament for Worcester in the First Protectorate Parliament. On 2 May 1654 he petitioned the Oliver Cromwell \" to consider his great expenses and sufferings for the public, and give him an estate to live upon in his old age .. as he was now unable to serve, having hardly a subsistence.\" The petition was referred to the Committee who reported that £600 should be paid him from delinquents' estates and an ordinance was made by the Protector and his Council in September 1654 \" for payment of £6oo for his fidelity when Mayor in 1646 and when Governor in 1651, for his losses by the burning of his house, the plundering of his goods, and his expense in money.\""

On account of his deafness, which was brought on by an illness at the age of seven, he was educated in the first Dutch institution for the deaf and dumb at Groningen (1799). The Flemish Gerardus de San, first director of the Academie Minerva, instructed him in the art of drawing. In 1804, he obtained the first prize of the Academy. In 1808 he went back to his home town. In 1814 he was rewarded a stipend and lived in Paris for two years. Then he travelled by foot in France, Switzerland, and Italy, making sketches. In 1820 he had an exhibition of his work in Amsterdam. Afterwards he taught at the Atheneum in Franeker, communicating on a slate. In 1823 he visited London. He worked in a flower shop in Haarlem.

Qvanten travelled both in the far east and visiting South Africa before settling in exile in Stockholm, Sweden. Here he produced anonymous political propaganda which was smuggled into Finland. He sought a form of Finnish nationalism that combined Scandinavianism with Fennomania. In 1855, Oskar Tammelander, working for the Russian secret police went to Stockholm and met Qvanten, but aroused Qvantend's suspicions. So Qvanten supplied the infiltrator with a letter full of literary parodies to excite the suspicions of his contacts in Finland. This succeeded and Tammelander was unmasked as a spy."

In 1854 the De Garises migrated to Australia, settling in Adelaide and then Naracoorte. The young Elisha attended the Collegiate School of St Peter before moving to Melbourne in 1872 to study architecture. Ordained in the Wesleyan Methodist Church in 1880, he married Elizabeth Buncle on 2 February 1881 and was formally ordained as a minister in 1882 for Durham Ox and Kerang. He became known as a supporter of Hugh McColl's irrigation schemes and was appointed irrigation correspondent for the Melbourne Daily Telegraph; he was appointed inaugural chairman of the Tragowel Plains Irrigation and Water Supply Trust and also served as chairman of the Central Irrigation League, editing the Australian Irrigationist and founding the Associated Australian Yeomanry. In 1888, De Garis was a commissioner of the Melbourne Centennial International Exhibition, having formally renounced the cloth in 1887 (although he continued as a lay preacher). He established a market garden at Werribee with George Chaffey but in 1891 moved to Mildura, where he was one of the founders of the Australian Dried Fruits Association and president of Mildura Shire Council (1907–08). He returned to Melbourne in 1908, leaving his son Jack to manage his Mildura affairs. Elected to Moorabbin Shire Council in 1909, he ran unsuccessfully for the state seat of Brighton in 1909 and the federal seat of Yarra in 1910 for the Liberal Party. He spent time in Guernsey from 1916 to 1919; his wife died in 1918 and he remarried Mary Evaleen Waugh on 23 April 1919 at Auburn. He died in 1948."

In 1907 he joined the Socialist Labor Party, a group of Australian followers of American socialist Daniel De Leon who split from the Industrial Workers of the World in 1908, although Judd remained with the IWW. He ran as an independent for the state seats of Wollongong in 1913 and King in 1917, and during World War I was the Municipal Workers' Union delegate to the Labor Council of New South Wales. He opposed conscription and was appointed by the Labor Council as investigator into the imprisonment of IWW members in 1916. In 1917 Judd stood for the Senate as an independent without success, and also published The War and the Sydney Labor Council. In 1918 he was prosecuted for \"making statements prejudicial to recruiting\" and was fined in 1919, although he attracted significant publicity, publishing Judd's Speech from the Dock and The Case for the O.B.U. He continued to campaign for socialist causes and contested Sydney at the 1920 state election, receiving only 282 votes. He distanced himself from the Communist Party, which he considered \"a front for capitalist spies\". During a clash with right-wing demonstrators in the Domain in May 1921 he drew a revolver and was convicted of carrying a firearm. He was appointed general secretary of the Socialist Labor Party in 1920 but was involved in damaging disputes with industrial organiser A. W. Wilson and De Leon's successor Arnold Petersen. Facing declining public support, he engaged in a number of legal stunts; he was convicted of failing to vote for the Senate in the 1925 federal election and supported Thomas Mutch against Bob Heffron in the state seat of Botany in 1927 and 1930. He contested North Sydney unsuccessfully in the 1929 federal election and sued the Barrier Daily Truth for remarks it made during the campaign, winning a farthing's damages. He published How to End Capitalism and Inaugurate Socialism and Why War is Near in 1931; during the 1930s he decreased in relevance and has been described by Ian Turner as \"a cantankerous stump orator, preaching the truths of De Leonism to a dwindling handful of the converted\". He died a bachelor in 1959 at the mental hospital at Rydalmere."

  "text" : "Edward Fitzgerald Russell (27 June 1867 – 14 August 1943) was an Australian trade unionist. Born at Rocky Lead near Daylesford in Victoria to Irish-born teacher Henry Russell and Maria Louisa, née Doyle. Young Edward became a compositor, and on 24 October 1890 married Catherine McCoy at Dandenong. They moved to Port Melbourne in 1894; Russell continued as a compositor until 1899. He subsequently worked intermittently as a labourer, a candlemaker and a casual dockhand. He later worked as a \"vat man\" in a soap factory; the family struggled financially at this time. Russell was appointed secretary of the Victorian Agricultural Implement Makers' Society in August 1907 despite not working in this area; his membership of the Victorian Socialist Party is believed to have helped him get the position. He represented the society in the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration against Hugh Victor McKay in September 1907; his wife Kate was used by H. B. Higgins in his landmark Harvester Judgement as an example of struggling working-class women. After the High Court struck down the decision Russell and his union were once more in financial stress. In January 1911 the union declared that all industry workers were required to join; McKay and the employers responded with a lockout and the use of free labour and Russell was forced to compromise for only small wage increases. His membership of the Labor Party was sporadic, contesting local elections in Port Melbourne as a revolutionary socialist in 1907, but he served as a Labor councillor for Port Melbourne from 1912 to 1914 (mayor in 1913). He contested East Gippsland in the 1911 state election and Echuca in the 1919 federal election and organised the anti-conscription campaign in South Australia in 1916–17. From 1918 to 1919 he was President of the Melbourne Trades Hall Council. His union bankrupt, Russell kept a lower profile during the 1910s. He and the union returned to the arbitration court in 1925 to seek further wage increases, but their case was rejected. In 1926 an attempt to reduce work hours was also unsuccessful, and unemployment in the industry forced Russell to call for increased tariffs on machinery. The financial situation did not improve during the Depression, during which Russell's salary was £1 per week, and he resigned in February 1933. He and his son Roy, who had worked as an honorary assistant, claimed £500 in back payments; Roy addressed the union in 1936 claiming his father was destitute and threatening to go to the press and the union agreed to pay the debt in £1 instalments. Russell died in 1943 at Footscray."

  "text" : "Evald Thomsen (1913–1993) was a Danish fiddler and collector and promoter of Danish traditional music. Born in Siem by Skørping in Northern Jutland, Thomsen was taught fiddle from age 7, and played to local dances already as a young boy. He began egan to collect tunes and instruments. He founded the Rebild Fiddlers, and the Rebild museum of Traditional music. In 1931 he moved to Funen where his wife was from, and he stayed there to 1942 when he went back home to Himmerland. In 1971 he was made national When the Folk revival movement came to Denmark in the 1970'es he became an icon of the living tradition of Danish fiddle music, and he gained national fame, appearing in radio and television. In the 1960es he toured Denmark with a band composed of his son Hardy Thomsen (violin), his brother Hilbert Thomsen (bass), Hans Jørgen Christensen (violin) and Niels Vilhelm Hansen, (guitar and vocals). He also traveled Europe playing in Norway, the Faroe Islands, iceland, Scotland, Finland and Greenland, and in 1976 he toured the USA for a month. Together with other players from the first half of the 20th century like Æ Tinuser and Frederik Iversen, his versions make up the main stock of Danish traditional music. He is considered by many to be the single most important fiddler and promoter of Danish traditional music in the 20th century."

  "text" : "Edward Owen (died 1741) was a Welsh artist; the son of minor nobility from Penrhos on Anglesey, who held an apprenticeship in London with the artist Thomas Gibson. Owen never became a prominent artist, but painted one of Wales' oldest professional self-portraits. His letters also provide a historical record of 1700s life in the London art scene. Although a promising artist, some time during 1732 he was mugged and badly beaten while returning late at night from Covent Garden. He survived but never fully recovered from his injuries, which left him mostly blind and deaf. He returned home, and his subsequent works are nowhere near the quality of his earlier London pieces. Owen died in 1741, apparently from consumption."

In 1647 he was elected MP for Montgomeryshire as a recruiter for the Long Parliament. He was a commissioner for North Wales in June 1648. He voted in the House on 7 December 1648 \"that the King's answer to the proposition of both Houses was a ground for peace \" and as a result was secluded under Pride's Purge and imprisoned. On 27 April 1649, the Committee for the Advance ot Money ordered Edward Vaughan to be brought up in custody before them to answer certain matters touching his estates, as he had hitherto treated their orders with contempt. However he was an active commissioner of sequestration for Montgomeryshire and was \"commended for his diligence in seizing delinquents's estates,\" by the London commissioners on 19 September 1650. He was appointed to serve as High Sheriff of Montgomeryshire for 1658 but served the office for two years 1658–1660. In 1659 Vaughan was again elected MP for Montgomeryshire. A petition by John Griffiths in November 1660 asked for \" a warrant to recover from Edward Vaughan of Llwydiarth co. Montgomery, the balance of £1,600 received by him in 1648 as a commissioner for disbanding the army. He was elected MP for Montgomeryshire in Apnl 1661 for the Cavalier Parliament and sat until his death a few months afterwards. Vaughan's brother Sir Robert Vaughan by deed dated 2 February 1623 conveyed all his lands in Montgomeryshire, Denbigh, and Merioneth to him."

Elmer began acting in touring stock companies as a teenager and achieved great success in the stock company at the Central Theater in San Francisco from 1903-1906. Between 1910 and 1915 he starred in 40 movies; one of those was D. W. Griffith's The Musketeers of Pig Alley (1912), cited by many film experts as the first gangster movie. Playing The Snapper Kid, a Manhattan street tough engaged in a turf war on the Lower East Side, Booth interpreted the gangster as a cocky, entertaining antihero, far different from the standard teeth-gnashing movie bad guys of his time. His groundbreaking performance created a new character type and paved the way \"for all the Cagneys, Bogarts, and Robinsons who later shot their way across the screen.\" Booth died at the age of 32 in a car crash in Los Angeles, caused by actor and director Tod Browning. D.W. Griffith, who had planned to give Booth an important role in Intolerance, delivered the actor's graveside eulogy."

  "text" : "Eduardo Haro Tecglen (1924–2005) was a Spanish journalist, writer and theatre critic. Born in Madrid, he studied at the Official School of Journalism where he graduated in 1943. After having been the Paris correspondent for Informaciones and El Correo Español-El Pueblo Vasco, from 1968 to 1980 he was the deputy editor Triunfo. In 1978, he became the theatre critic for El País, publishing a daily column until his death. With his editorials in Triunfo, together with other leading journalists who criticised the Franco regime in the journal, such as its founder, José Ángel Ezcurra, Enrique Miret Magdalena, José Monleón, and later Luis Carandell and Manuel Vázquez Montalbán, he helped Triunfo become one of the leading intellectual journals and one of the leading symbols of resistance to Francoist Spain. Although some critics, including the author Javier Marías (who accused him, and José Luis López Aranguren and Camilo José Cela of not accepting their responsibilities for their earlier \"pro-Fascist actions or writings\") of \"collaborating\" with the Franco regime, based on his having been associated with the Falange in his youth, the reality was that he had done so in order to commute his father's death sentence - to a 30-year prison sentence. He signed the articles he wrote in Triunfo about international politics using his own name, while those he wrote about history, he signed using the pen-name \"Juan Aldebarán\", and the articles about science and the future, he signed \"Pablo Berbén\". He also wrote a weekly column about daily life, signed \"Pozuelo\". The homage to him, held at the Teatro Español, a few days after his death, was attended by, among others, the founder of Triunfo, José Ángel Ezcurra; the journalist Fernando Delgado; the former and current editors of El País, Juan Luis Cebrián and Joaquín Estefanía, respectively; the president de PRISA, Jesús de Polanco; the actors Diego Galán and Núria Espert, and the then mayor of Madrid, Alberto Ruiz-Gallardón. The actor Francisco Rabal dedicated the copla \"Hijo del siglo\" to Haro Tecglen."

He studied under Tom Wostyn at Heaton, briefly under Sir Hubert Herkomer at Bushey, and finally under Henry Tonks at the Slade School of Art. He spent some time in Florence studying the art of fresco. He preferred painting the landscapes of the Cape and Natal, often depicting farmhouses. He was adept at producing formal portraits, working happily in oils or pastel. In his heyday Roworth greatly influenced the South African art scene, endorsing a conservative approach. Edward Roworth arrived in South Africa with British forces during the Anglo-Boer War. With the war over he decided to stay and settled in Cape Town, where he set up a teaching studio. In 1908 he was elected President of the South African Society of Artists, doing so again in 1918–20 and 1933–36. In 1909 Roworth was commissioned to produce a painting of the National Convention, a 5m x 6m work depicting the 33 men who were architects of the Union. This work was completed in 1911 whereupon it was displayed in Buckingham Palace, later being installed in the House of Assembly in Cape Town.Roworth's next task was painting, what were possibly the first frescoes in South Africa, in St Phillips Church in Cape Town."

  "text" : "Edmund Carl Kornfeld (24 February 1919 – 22 June 2012) was an American organic chemist who devoted his life to the research of new drugs. His leading discovery, with the help of a team, was a unique antibiotic later known as Vancomycin. Kornfeld received his PhD in chemistry from Harvard in 1944 and subsequently joined Eli Lilly Company, in Indianapolis, US. It was there where most of his discoveries took place. In 1953, Kornfeld and his team isolated an unknown microbe, Streptomyces orientalis, which was found in soil samples from Borneo. This microbe produced a unique compound which had the remarkable property of killing all staphylococci bacteria, including the penicillin-resistant strains. The drug’s ability to inhibit straphylococci was stable during early assays, suggesting that it might be clinically useful for a long period. One of the most difficult tasks that Kornfeld and his team faced was purifying the new compound. The purification method employed during that time utilised picric acid - a potentially explosive chemical; because of this an alternate process was developed. However, this new method yielded material with a purity of only 82% and when solubilized, produced a brown liquid aptly termed “Mississippi mud”. However, due to the need for an alternative to penicillin in resistant bacterial infections, the initial preparations were considered safe enough for use in humans. The first human trial was in 1950. The drug was given to a patient that had developed a severe infection on his foot after surgery which was unresposnsive to multiple antibiotics. The surgical staff recommended amputation or the usage of the new antibiotic. His answer was ‘ Anything that might save my foot’. Due to the spread of the bacteria, a high dosage the antibiotic of 05865 was recommended, 100 mg every eight hours, over five days. After the first day, the heat was decreasing, his white cell count was dropping and the exudate of his wound was less. During the next seven days, the staphylococci disappeared from the wound, and his foot was free from any sign of infection. Two months later he left the hospital with an intact foot. The new antibiotic was named Vancomycin, from the term \"vanquish\" and was FDA approved in 1958."

  "text" : "Elis Gruffydd (1490–1552), sometimes known as \"The soldier of Calais\", was a Welsh chronicler, transcriber, and translator. He is known foremost for his massive chronicle Cronicl o Wech Oesoedd (Chronicle of the Six Ages), which covers the history of the world from the beginning of Adam and Eve up to the year 1552 and contains the earliest text of the Tale of Taliesin. He is also well known for his eyewitness account of England's 1543 war with France in his journal transcribed in Elis Gruffydd and the 1544 'Enterprise' of Paris and Boulogue. His presence on the battlefield has given insight into the development of protests against the campaign. Thomas Jones says \"despite his long years of service in France and London, [Gruffydd] was deeply interested in the oral traditions and written literature of his native land. He quotes Welsh englynion and proverbs, records a few folk-tales, and transcribes Welsh texts from such MSS as he had at his disposal\". Gruffydd is an excellent source in uncovering lost and obscure traditions and he serves as a harmoniser for Welsh traditions appearing in different ages by the same poet, such as Merlin and Taliesin."

In 1606, he purchased Bache Hall at Upton-by-Chester. He was called to the bar in 1610 and became Recorder of Chester in 1613. In 1614, he was elected Member of Parliament for City of Chester. In 1619 the Chester corporation was riven by faction. Whitby was accused of official corruption and the committee voted to remove him from office. However the meeting was extremely unruly and a decision was deferred until his return. At the hearing he defended himself successfully and was reaffirmed in his office. He was re-elected MP for Chester in 1521, 1624, 1625, 1626 and 1628 and sat until 1629 when King Charles decided to rule without parliament for eleven years. Whitby continued as Recorder until his death in 1639. His house at Bache Hall was demolished during the siege of Chester in the English Civil War, when Parliamentary troops used it as a garrison. Whitby married Alice Gamull, widow of Thomas Gamull and daughter of Richard Bavand of Chester."

Though she was never officially on staff, her research on polychaetes brought prestige to the Station and established her as a world authority on the subject. Her husband Cyril Berkeley left his own research to help her in 1930. They wrote 34 papers together, and she published an additional 12 in her own name. Many organisms have been named after them."

In 2008, his video, SCLPTR (2005), was included in California Video at the Getty Center, curated by Glenn Phillips. Macdonald's videos, drawings and sculptures are informed by philosophical, musical, literary and popular references. They often depict everyday scenes while examining landscape, entropy, stillness, noise, and duration. In his essay Responsiveness Testing, Ralph Rugoff, director of the Hayward Gallery, London, writes: \"Macdonald quietly unsettles the viewers faith about what exactly is - or is not - happening in the picture he or she is looking at. ... These pockets of uncertainty are enhanced by Macdonald’s deliberately style-less or impersonal approach to making images.”"

Bennett's government. He also served as vice-president of the Pacific Great Eastern Railway and as a director of the British Columbia Toll Bridge and Highways Authority, of the Canadian Bank of Commerce, of Black Ball Ferries Ltd. and of Deeks-McBride Ltd., a cement and gravel supply company.

He retired in 1917, and died in 1920. His practice continued after his death, until it merged with Matthews and Goodman in 2011. Most of Kirby's works were in Northwest England, with occasional examples in North Wales, Staffordshire, Shropshire, and elsewhere. He was an architect to the Roman Catholic Church, and most of his ecclesiastical works were for this denomination. His most notable work in this genre is the Sodality Chapel for St Francis Xavier's Church, Liverpool. In 1869 he designed Sacred Heart Church in Hindsford which Pevsner described as a \"pretty church\".

  "text" : "Sir Edward Alford (ca. 1595 – 1653) was an English landowner and politician who sat in the House of Commons at various times between 1628 and 1644. He supported the Royalist cause in the English Civil War. Alford was the son of Edward Alford and his wife Judith Downing, daughter of Edmund Downing of Suffolk. He matriculated at Christ Church, Oxford on 30 October 1612, aged 17. While his father was occupied with his Parliamentary and public duties in London and Essex, Alford appears to have lived at Offington, and was active in Sussex. He was High Sheriff of Surrey and Sussex in 1624 and was concerned with local militia. In 1627 \"The King commissioned Edward Alford, with others, to use martial law to soldiers billeted in co. Sussex.\" and he made complaints against the freeman of Billinghurst, Sussex, for not duly maintaining a watch at a beacon.\"In 1628 he \"renders some accounts of prize-ships.\" and is in correspondence with Sir John Coke regarding the billeting of soldiers near Portsmouth. In 1628 Edward Alford was elected Member of Parliament for Steyning. Sources differ as to whether this is Alford or his father, who was also elected for Colchester but was unseated on petition. Alford was knighted by King Charles in 1632. His father died in the same year and the family estates of Hamsey and Offington passed to Alford's elder brother John Alford. Alford also had an interest in Somerset, being lord of the manor of Stanton Drew and his name is recorded at the Taunton Sessions in 1635 in a case of poaching on his manor. In April 1640, Alford was elected Member of Parliament for Tewkesbury in the Short Parliament. He was re-elected MP for Tewkesbury and also elected MP for Arundel in November 1640 for the Long Parliament. There was a double return at Tewkesbury but by the time it was resolved Alford had chosen to sit for Arundel. Alford was on the King's side in the Civil War, and was disabled from sitting in parliament in 1644. He was involved in the capitulation of Exeter in 1649 and was severely fined by the Commonwealth. He had only just succeeded to the Offington estates, on the death of his brother, John Alford. The fine for Offington alone was £1,503 pounds. He was also fined £1,075 on lands and messuages in Tewkesbury worth £430 p.a, .£189 on the rectory of Cheltenham and Charlton worth £75 pa, £852 on the manor of Ilmington Warwickshire worth £333 p.a., £970 on lands at Whitbury Wiltshire, worth £194, £250 on King's Langley Park, Hertford and £500 on the manor of Pindast in the parish of Waltham Cross worth £200 p.a. Alford died intestate in 1653 at the age of 61. Alford married firstly on 11 December 1632 Lady Mary Cooper, widow of Sir John Cooper, 1st Baronet, her second husband, and of Sir Charles Morrison, 1st Baronet of Cashiobury, Hertfordshire. She was the youngest daughter of Baptist Hicks, 1st Viscount Campden. She had no children by this, her third, marriage, and died seven years later, in 1639, and was buried \"in the Isle of Watford parish church\".

  "text" : "Edward Lawrence Sudol (September 13, 1920 – December 10, 2004) was a professional baseball umpire who worked in the National League from 1957 to 1977. Sudol umpired 3,247 major league games in his 21 year career, wearing uniform number 16 for most of his career. He umpired in three World Series (1965, 1971, and 1977), three League Championship Series (1969, 1973, and 1976) and three All-Star Games (1961, 1964 and 1974). Sudol was also the home plate umpire for Jim Bunning's perfect game in 1964. In 1974, he was the second base umpire when Hank Aaron broke Babe Ruth's career home run record. Among the epic games he worked in his career, Sudol also had the distinction of being the home plate umpire for the three longest games in New York Mets history. On September 11, 1974, the St. Louis Cardinals won a marathon night game against the New York Mets, after 7 hours 4 minutes, and 25 innings, also tied for the longest game to a decision in major league history. The Mets went to the plate 103 times, a record in a major league game; the Cards were not far behind with 99 plate appearances. All told, a record 175 official at-bats were recorded, with a major-league record 45 runners stranded. Only a thousand fans were still at Shea Stadium when the game ended at 3:13 a.m. ET. This was the longest game played to a decision without a suspension. On April 15, 1968, the Houston Astros defeated the Mets, 1-0, in a 24-inning game at the Houston Astrodome. The 6-hour, 6-min. contest, remains the longest shutout game in Major League history. It also had the most scoreless innings (23) in a major-league game. Sudol was the home plate umpire in game two of the longest doubleheader in Major League history came on May 31, 1964. The San Francisco Giants beat the New York Mets 5-3 in nine innings in the day's first game at Shea Stadium, and then won the nightcap 8-6 after 23 innings. The two games lasted a combined nine hours, 52 minutes. Sudol played in the minor leagues from 1940 to 1953, mainly as a first baseman. As Sudol realized his playing career was drawing to a close, he enrolled in an umpiring school in Daytona Beach, and after umpiring in the minor leagues for multiple years, was called up to the National League in 1957. Sudol died on December 10, 2004, in Daytona Beach; he had been suffering from Alzheimer's disease."

Since her ordination, Lippitz has served as cantor at Oheb Shalom in South Orange, New Jersey. She is also the director and co-founder of the Kol Dodi choir, director of Oheb Shalom's adult and children's choirs, and a member of the folk-singing group Beged Kefet, which performs nationally and has made three recordings. She is a cofounder, with Cantor Perry Fine, of the JTS Cantorial Alumni Association’s Shir Joy Choral Festival. In 2005 she sang at Carnegie Hall. Prior to becoming a cantor, Lippitz earned a B.A. from the University of Michigan, as well as a Masters in Jewish Communal Service from Brandeis University. She had also served as the director of Loyola University Chicago's Hillel. When she entered the Seminary, she did not believe graduating as a Hazzan would be possible.

  "text" : "Eleanor Ambrose (1718–1816) was a celebrated beauty and Catholic heiress. Her father, Michael, was well-educated but disbarred from several professions by his religion. He became a brewer and made his fortune. He resided at Mount Ambrose, Swords, County Dublin. Eleanor was described as \"beautiful, witty, intellectual and a fevent patriot\" who \"managed to penetrate Dublin society, despite the fact that she was a Catholic. Indeed, she became a darling of the Viceregal Court, and during the Viceroyalty of Lord Chesterfield, she and her sister Clara were the prominent socialites of the Castle set. Chesterfield was attracted to her, and she soon accompanied him to all official ceremonies. Influenced by her opinions, Chesterfield is reported to have told George II that poverty not Popery was to be feared in Ireland, he had found only one dangerous papist, the brightness of whose eyes and charms, and whose conversation were indeed dangerous, and her name was Eleanor Ambrose\". However, Eleanor ensured the relationship stayed platonic. \"At one of the Castle balls, given on the anniversary of the battle of the Boyne, she appeared with an orange lily in her breast, upon which Chesterfield improvised the following lines:\"Say, lovely tory, where's the jestOf wearing orange on thy breast,When that same breast uncovered showsThe whiteness of the rebel rose?\" In 1752 she married Roger Palmer of Castle Lackin, County Mayo (created baronet 1777) and had issue. She died at her house on Henry Street, Dublin, in 1816, \"retaining to the last a vehement hatred of the wrongs under which her Catholic fellow-countrymen laboured.\" A song written about her story by Aido Lawlor - from Rush North Co Dublin - was recorded by the singer Aoife Scott on her 2016 album Carry the Day."

Born in Christchurch in 1861 and educated at Christ's College, Millton played for the Christchurch club and made seven appearances for the Canterbury provincial team between 1883 and 1886, as well as one for Wellington as a loan player in 1884. He was a member of the first New Zealand national rugby union team, which toured New South Wales in 1884. He played in seven of the eight matches on that tour, scoring one try. He did not play in any Test matches, as New Zealand did not play its first full international until 1903. Millton and his older brother, William, who captained the New Zealand team on the 1884 tour to New South Wales, have the distinction of being the first brothers to represent New Zealand in rugby. Millton married Maud Eliza Ford at St Peter's Church, Riccarton, on 22 March 1892. He died at Loburn on 11 March 1942. He bequeathed his sheep farm, Birch Hill Station, and another property at Okuku, to the Sunlight League of New Zealand for the establishment of the \"Ford Millton Memorial Home for Children\"."

His direct ancestor that eventually settled in the subcontinent, Mirza Hadi Baig, was a descendant and member of the Mughal Barlas tribe. The Barlas tribe was of Turkic and mixed Mongolian ancestry. His birth as a twin has been seen as the fulfillment of a prophecy regarding the Mahdi by Ibn Arabi, a Muslim saint. Ahmad had four siblings, including a twin sister (Jannat, who later died). Three years before his birth, Syed Ahmad Barelvi and Shah Ismail Shaheed were killed. Ahmad was born during the era of Christian influence in India, which was supported by the British Raj."

In the Dionysia of 431 BCE, Euphorion won 1st prize, defeating both Sophocles (who took 2nd prize) and Euripides, who took 3rd prize with a tetralogy that includes the extant play Medea. He is purported by some to have been the author of Prometheus Bound—previously assumed to be the work of his father, to whom it was attributed at the Library of Alexandria,—for several reasons, chiefly that the playwright's portrayal of Zeus is far less reverent than in other works attributed to Aeschylus, and that references to the play appear in the plays of the comic Aristophanes. This has led historians to date it as late as 415 BCE, long after Aeschylus's death. If Euphorion wrote Prometheus Bound, there are as a result four (rather than three) ancient Greek tragedians with one or more fully surviving plays."

  "text" : "Ernst Knobil (September 20, 1926 - April 13, 2000) was a scientist known for his studies of endocrinology. Knobil's research into hormonal regulation in primates led to his discovery of growth hormone's species-specific effects. These discoveries led to the first treatment of Growth hormone deficiency. Knobil is also credited with discovering the key role of pulsatile Gonadotropin-releasing hormone and estrogen feedback during the menstrual cycle. This work today forms the basis of reproductive endocrinology and enabled development of the world's first hormonal contraceptives. In addition to being the author of 217 scientific papers, he was the editor of several reference books in endocrinology and reproduction, including The Handbook of Physiology (1974), The Physiology of Reproduction (1988, 1994), and The Encyclopedia of Reproduction (1998). In addition to his numerous scientific contributions, Ernst was a visionary leader in the field of endocrinology and a wonderful mentor and friend to the many people who were privileged to work closely with him.(1)"

  "text" : "Emmett Leslie Bennett, Jr. (July 12, 1918 – December 15, 2011) was an American classicist and philologist whose systematic catalog of its symbols led to the solution of the mystery of reading and interpreting Linear B, a syllabary used for writing Mycenaean Greek, a 3,300-year-old script that was used hundreds of years before the Greek alphabet was developed. Archaeologist Arthur Evans had discovered Linear B in 1900 during his excavations at Knossos on the Greek island of Crete who spent decades trying to comprehend its writings until his death in 1941. Bennett and Alice Kober cataloged the 80 symbols used in the script in his 1951 work The Pylos Tablets, which provided linguist John Chadwick and amateur scholar Michael Ventris with the vital clues needed to finally decipher Linear B in 1952. Bennett was born on July 12, 1918, in Minneapolis and attended the University of Cincinnati, where he studied the classics, earning bachelor's, master's and doctoral degrees, and was a student of the American archaeologist Carl Blegen, who had uncovered a series of tablets inscribed in Linear B during excavations he had conducted at Pylos in 1939. Bennett worked as a cryptanalyst on the American effort decoding Japanese ciphers during World War II, despite not knowing any Japanese. After beginning his academic career at Yale University and the University of Texas, Bennett spent almost three decades on the faculty of the University of Wisconsin–Madison before he retired in 1988. Bennett's papers were acquired and have been cataloged and organized by the Program in Aegean Scripts and Prehistory at the University of Texas. Bennett was awarded the Gold Medal of the Archaeological Institute of America in 2001 in recognition of \"outstanding contributions to the field of archaeology\" for his role in cataloging Linear B texts and the development of the field of Mycenaean studies. Bennett died in Madison, Wisconsin at the age of 93. He was survived by two daughters, three sons and four grandchildren."

  "text" : "Edmund Doubleday (died December 1620) was an English vintner, lawyer, office-holder and politician who sat in the House of Commons in 1614. He was jointly responsible for the capture of Guy Fawkes in the Gunpowder Plot. Doubleday was acting as a scrivener and public notary by 1587 and then studied law at Middle Temple. He was active at the parish of St Margaret's, Westminster where he signed parish accounts from 1590. He was overseer of the poor in 1590. By the 1590s he had acquired leases of several properties from Westminster Abbey and marriages to wealthy widows brought him various property in Westminster which included the Saracens Head on King Street. In 1591 he was assigned half the lease of Ebury Manor by Thomas Knyvet with whom he was subsequently involved in various activities. From 1592 to 1595 he was High Constable of Westminster. Doubleday was built for law enforcement, being described in Anglorum Speculumas as \"a man of great stature, valour, gravity and activity\". He was given a position in the mint office in 1601. In 1604 Doubleday and Andrew Bright were granted the offices of distilling herbs and sweet waters at the palace of Whitehall and keeping the library there. On 5 November 1605 Doubleday assisted Knyvet in a search of the undercroft of the Palace of Westminster where they discovered Guy Fawkes. Fawkes gripped Doubleday \"very violently\" by the fingers of the left hand. Doubleday in reaction was about to stab Fawkes but thought better of it. Instead he up-heeled Fawkes, searched him and tied him up with garters found in Fawkes pockets. In 1609 Doubleday and Knyvett were given grant of \"keeping plate and money in the tower and the coinage of money there and elsewhere for life\" and in 1611 were given the joint title of Warden of the Mint. Meanwhile, he had joined the Worshipful Company of Vintners in 1610 of which he became one of the wealthiest members. Doubleday was involved in further law enforcement on Christmas Day 1611 at the chapel in Whitehall when King James and his family were at prayer. One John Selman went into the chapel and Doubleday spotted him as suspicious and kept a watch on him. Doubleday saw Selman picking the pocket of Leonard Barry and they gave chase. Once Selman was caught, Doubleday gripped him by both hands and Barry retrieved his purse. Selman was hanged in January. In 1614, Doubleday was elected Member of Parliament for Westminster. He was master of the Vintners Company from 1616 to 1617. In December 1620 he was re-elected MP for Westminster, but died two days after the election. He asked to be buried near the vestry in St Margaret's Church."

  "text" : "Edgar Baldwin Graves (1898–1983) was an American medievalist and professor of history at Hamilton College in Clinton, NY. His primary area of expertise was medieval English law and the relationship between royal and ecclesiastical jurisdictions. Graves was born in Philadelphia, where he attended the Penn Charter School and Haverford College. At Haverford, he studied with the eminent medievalist W. E. Lunt, who taught courses on English constitutional history and did pioneering research on papal financial records. Graves would maintain a close working relationship with Lunt for many years until the latter's death in 1956. Following graduation from Haverford, Graves continued on to Harvard where he completed a Ph.D under the supervision of Charles Homer Haskins. From 1927 until his retirement in 1969, Graves taught history at Hamilton College in central New York state. His scholarship focused on a few select issues in English legal history, particularly the relationship between the Crown and ecclesiastical courts, including the papal rota. Later, he would see to completion the massive two-volume work begun by his mentor Lunt on papal finances in England. In 1975, Graves completed his magnum opus, a revised and updated edition of Charles Gross's Bibliography of English History to 1485 (Oxford). Graves died in 1983 and his papers were deposited at the Pontifical Institute of Mediaeval Studies in Toronto. Friends and former students later established an endowed professorship in his memory in the Hamilton College history department."

(Indeed, it is not completely clear that she was given an empress title when he declared himself emperor in 911, although the modern Chinese historian Bo Yang asserted that she was, as was Liu's other wife Empress Zhu.) When Yan's capital You Prefecture (幽州, in modern Beijing) fell in late 913 under siege by Li Cunxu the Prince of Jin, she, Liu Shouguang, Empress Zhu, and Liu Shouguang's three sons Liu Jixun (劉繼珣), Liu Jifang (劉繼方), and Liu Jizuo (劉繼祚) fled You Prefecture, but were eventually captured at Yanle (燕樂, in modern Beijing) and delivered to Li Cunxu. Li Cunxu took them on a victory tour through the lands of his allies Wang Chuzhi the military governor of Yiwu Circuit (義武, headquartered in modern Baoding, Hebei) and Wang Rong the Prince of Zhao, but eventually took them back to his capital Taiyuan and executed them there. As they were to be executed, Liu Shouguang was begging for his life, and Empresses Li and Zhu rebuked him for not acting bravely like an emperor should, while they accepted their own executions."

Her early research focused on language, identity and politics in Cape Breton, Nova Scotia, and her dissertation dealt with language shift in Cape Breton Scottish Gaelic, drawing on semiotic anthropology. Her later research examines the language of U.S. legal education in detail using linguistic anthropological approaches (see her book The Language of Law School). She writes on semiotics, anthropology, and law, among other topics. She has been editor of Law & Social Inquiry  and of PoLAR: Political and Legal Anthropology Review."

  "text" : "Lady Elizabeth Symonds Gwillim (21 April 1763 – 21 December 1807) was an artist married to Sir Henry Gwillim, Puisne Judge at the Madras high court until 1808. Lady Gwillim painted a series of about 200 watercolours of Indian birds. Produced about 20 years before John James Audubon, her work has been acclaimed for its accuracy and natural postures as they were drawn from observations of the birds in life. She also painted fishes and flowers. About 121 paintings from were obtained from a private dealer by Casey A. Wood and these are held in the Blacker-Wood Library of McGill University. Lady Gwillim died on 21 December 1807 of unknown causes and was buried at St. Mary's Church in Madras. Her husband resigned the next year and returned to England with the paintings."

No person here can remember how the Archdeacon came or departed, and I have found no trace or remembrance of him in any other settlement on the coast. It would, I think, be a gratification to that indefatigable pioneer of the Church, to know that I read a chapter to the poor man and his family from the Testament presented seventeen years ago.

I had the pleasure of reading a chapter in a poor fisherman's hut, from a Testament given so long ago by Mr. Wix, and bearing his name. It was well preserved, but, it is too probable, had never been used, for none of the family could read. They were indeed deplorably ignorant. I could not discover that Mr. Wix had called at any other place, or any other traces of his visitation." ]

Born in Glasgow, Scotland, she married Francis Sinclair, a ship's captain. With six children in tow, the family moved to New Zealand. Her husband and eldest son (and much of the family's property) were later lost at sea. After years of farming, mainly at Pigeon Bay on the Banks Peninsula in the Canterbury Region of the South Island, she decided to relocate to Canada. Unhappy with the conditions she found on Vancouver Island, she considered California but instead went to Hawaii where she bought the Hawaiian island of Niʻihau for $10,000. She later bought additional lands at Hanapepe and Makaweli on the island of Kauaʻi. Her descendants, the Robinson family, continue to own and maintain the island of Ni'ihau."

  "text" : "Ed Dailey was born in Modesto, California in 1956. His dad \"Cuz\" Ralph Dailey worked at KJOY in Stockton and KRAK in Sacramento. \"Cuz\" was a singer who started out with a traveling medicine show. He ended up on the Grand Ole Opry filling in as a singer for the Sunshine Boys, and other groups. \"Cuz\" came out west to work in Hollywood, and did backup vocal work on the Town Hall Party show. Ralph was a member of the famous Rangers Quartet for a couple of years. In Central California \"Cuz\" worked with other singers who presented dances, shows, and concerts in that area, plus he had his radio shows. Ed started in radio when he was just 12 years old. For a time he was on the running for the world record holder of the youngest radio DJ ever. He had a regular radio show on KSMK 1340 in Kennewick. That's the environment that Ed was born into. Growing up around people like Chester Smith, Tommy Collins, Ernie Ford, and others, plus shows or dances every weekend, meant that as a small child, this world of entertainment seemed very normal to him. In many ways Ed has continued to live this type of life, promoting shows, singing and working in radio since childhood. Working with stars and even TV work. Today, Ed works full-time as instructor of Radio Broadcasting at the Tri-Tech Skills Center in Kennewick, Washington. Ed sings and does ministry work with Waymaker Ministries, as well as presents concerts all over the Northwest. Ed works on charity events, works on a TV show, does public speaking, and is host of \"Legends of Country\" a classic country radio show which airs on several radio stations."

  "text" : "Jean Octave Edmond Perrier (9 May 1844 – 31 July 1921) was a French zoologist born in Tulle. He is known for his studies of invertebrates (annelids and echinoderms). He was the brother of zoologist Rémy Perrier (1861-1936). On advice from Louis Pasteur, he studied sciences at the École Normale Supérieure, where he took classes in zoology from Henri de Lacaze-Duthiers (1821-1901). Afterwards he was a schoolteacher for three years at the college in Agen. In 1869 he obtained his doctorate in natural sciences, later replacing Lacaze-Duthiers at the École normale supérieure (1872). In 1876 he attained the chair of Natural History (mollusks, worms and zoophytes) at the Muséum national d'histoire naturelle, and in 1879 became chairman of the Société zoologique de France. In the early 1880s he participated in a series of sea expeditions, during which, he performed investigations of marine life located within the benthic zone, subsequently gaining international recognition as a specialist of marine fauna. In 1892 he became a member of the Académie des sciences, and even though he wasn't a doctor of medicine, he became a member of the Académie nationale de médecine (1898). From 1900 to 1919 he was director of the museum of natural history, where during the same time period (1903), he succeeded Henri Filhol (1843-1902) as chair of comparative anatomy. Perrier was deeply interested in the evolutionary theories of Charles Darwin and Jean-Baptiste Lamarck. In 1909 he was speaker at the inauguration of Lamarck's monument at the Muséum national d'histoire naturelle. He believed Lamarck to be the true founder in regards to the theory of evolution."

  "text" : "Edward Fitzgerald (1820 – 19 March 1896) was an Australian brewer and founder of the Castlemaine Brewery. Edward was born in 1820 in Galway to parents Francis Fitzgerald and Eleanor Joyes. His family owned and operated a distillery establishment at Nun's Island, Galway. In 1854 Edward Fitzgerald migrated to Australia during the Victorian gold rush and established a brewery in the gold field town of Castlemaine. In 1859 his brother Nicholas Fitzgerald emigrated to Australia and joined him in the brewery business. By 1871 the name Castlemaine Brewery had been adopted, in 1875 the brothers opened a brewery in South Melbourne, and in 1885 the enterprise was turned in to a public company. Breweries were opened right across the country and the brothers were involved in the establishment of the Castlemaine Perkins brewery in Brisbane which is home of the XXXX brand and is still brewing to this day."

  "text" : "Evan Rosenfeld is a film producer born in Miami, Florida. Evan got his start at Miami based documentary studio Rakontur and is now producing projects for Mandalay Sports Media, a sports entertainment company owned by filmmaker Mike Tollin and Peter Guber. He started his work in film on the 2006 cult-classic documentary Cocaine Cowboys (Magnolia Pictures) and was an associate producer on the sequel, Cocaine Cowboys 2 (Magnolia Pictures / 2008). Evan was nominated for a Sports Emmy Award for his work on The U, a 2009 ESPN Films \"30 for 30\" project that premiered to record breaking ratings. In October 2012, Broke, a documentary Evan produced, premiered on ESPN to kickoff their second \"30 for 30\" season. Broke looks at the intersection of money and sports in the last 20 years, and the recent epidemic of big stars losing it all. Broke premiered to 2.53 million viewers, becoming the highest rated film in the \"30 for 30\" series, besting a previous record set by The U. Also in 2012, Evan was the Executive Producer of the Sundance Film Festival selected short film Life and Freaky Times of Uncle Luke starring Luther \"Uncle Luke\" Campbell. The film received 5 (of 5) stars from Film Threat and was one of Indiewire's 10 must see short films from this year's festival. In 2014 it was named one of the \"Twenty-five must-see short films from over a century of cinema.\" In 2013, Evan was the senior producer of an NBA and CBS documentary Summer Dreams, a two-hour special that follows the players, personalities and behind-the-scenes drama at the NBA Summer League. The special premiered on March 15 on CBS in prime time. In 2014, Evan is producing an HBO documentary about basketball great Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. Evan is currently producing and directing a feature length documentary that chronicles the introduction of American football to South Asia and the start of the first professional league, the EFLI. The Elite Football League of India (EFLI) is the first professional American football league in India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka. Founded in late 2011, the EFLI was started to create new opportunities for athletes in the region. The league consists of eight teams, five located in various cities across India, two in Sri Lanka, and one from Pakistan. His other projects include Dawg Fight, a brutal exposé on underground backyard MMA fighting in one of Miami's toughest neighborhoods. Maxim Magazine profiled Dawg Fight in a 6 page feature."

  "text" : "Emma Louisa Turner FLS (1866 – 13 August 1940) was an ornithologist and pioneering bird photographer whose 1911 picture of a nestling bittern in Norfolk was the first evidence of their return to the United Kingdom as a breeding bird after local extinction since the late 1800s. She was described as being \" …small in stature but very wiry, quite capable with a punt or rowing boat\". She took up photography after meeting Richard Kearton in 1900. For 20 years, she lived and worked for part of each year (including some winters) at Hickling Broad in Norfolk, chiefly on a houseboat of her own design, which she named Water Rail after the first photograph she took in the Broads, of a water rail. She also had a hut on a small island in the south-east of Hickling Broad, which became known as Turner's Island (52°44′07″N 1°35′10″E﻿ / ﻿52.735206°N 1.586171°E). She became the first \"watcher\" (warden) on the National Trust's Scolt Head. Her bittern picture resulted in her being awarded the Gold Medal of the Royal Photographic Society. She was one of the first ten women fellows of the Linnaean Society and the first female honorary member of the British Ornithologists' Union. Though not a graduate, she was also an honorary member of the British Federation of University Women. Her book, Broadland Birds, was published in 1924 and formed the basis of a radio programme about her life, Emma Turner; a life in the reeds, broadcast by the BBC in 2012, produced by Sarah Blunt and with sound recordings by Chris Watson. She was also a keen gardener, at her homes in Girton, Cambridgeshire and Cambridge, and kept Terriers, which she trained to flush birds so that she could count them.

  "text" : "Edward Gryffydh Peacock (30 July 1825 – 4 January 1867) was an English official of the East India Company, publisher, writer and rower who won the Wingfield Sculls and Diamond Challenge Sculls at Henley Royal Regatta. Peacock was the son of the poet Thomas Love Peacock and his wife Jane Gryffydh. In 1841 he was appointed midshipman in the Indian Navy. He arrived in India in October 1841 but returned to England for medical reasons in April 1842. In 1844 he became a clerk in the examiners office at East India House. He collaborated with George Meredith in publishing a privately circulated literary magazine, the Monthly Observer. Peacock was a member of Thames Club and in 1845 was runner up in the Silver Wherries at Henley Royal Regatta partnering Henry Chapman. In 1849 he won the Silver Wherries partnering Francis Playford. He won the Diamond Challenge Sculls at Henley in 1851 defeating Edward Macnaghten in the final. In 1852 positions were reversed and Peacock came second to MacNaughton. Peacock won the Wingfield Sculls in 1852. Meredith is said to have based his character Edward Blancove in Rhoda Fleming on Peacock. Like Blancove, Peacock studied as a barrister and was a keen boxer. In 1865 Peacock qualified as a solicitor . However he died two years later at the age of 42. His poem The Vicar of Southbury's story: a Christmas poem was published posthumously in 1867. Peacock married Mary Hall in 1849, apparently to the disapproval of his father. They had a son Thomas Love Peacock. She remarried in 1869. Peacock's widowed sister Mary Ellen Nicolls married George Meredith."

He took up successive positions in Bristol, Edinburgh and Oxford, intermitting with internment on the Isle of Man as an enemy alien, before becoming Reader at the Institute of Psychiatry, London, in 1943, where he conducted pioneering work on attempted suicide. He moved to be Professor of Psychiatry at Sheffield University in 1957. Concurrent with his work on suicide, he had a sustained interest in the dementias, pioneering advances in understanding of Alzheimer's Disease. Trained as a psychoanalyst, he became an Associate Member of the Vienna Psycho-Analytic Society in 1931 and a Member of the British Psycho-Analytic Society in 1938. He translated Sigmund Freud's Zur Auffassung der Aphasien (1891) into English as On Aphasia. A Critical Study (1953)."

  "text" : "Emory Canda Ferguson (March 5, 1833 – October 7, 1911) was an early pioneer of Washington State who helped create Snohomish County from Island County in 1861. Along with Edson F. Cady, he was a founder of Snohomish, which would become the county seat from 1862 until 1896. Over his life, Ferguson served as county commissioner, postmaster, a Washington state legislator, Speaker of the State House of Representatives, Snohomish City Council President, justice of the peace, and mayor of Snohomish, as well as realtor, saloon keeper, and store owner. He was involved in many early plans to make Snohomish prominent, including a ferry for military use across the Snohomish River and a trail through the Cascade Mountains to reach a gold rush, few of which were successful. Upon his death, Ferguson was eulogized as the \"Father of Snohomish.\""

  "text" : "Eugene B. Power (1905-1993) was a pioneering entrepreneur in the use of microfilm for the reproduction of scholarly publications. During World War II, Power directed the microfilming of thousands of rare books and other printed materials in British libraries. Power paid the library a minimal fee per exposure and then took the film to the United States where he sold copies to American libraries. The idea was both a clever business arrangement and a benefit to American scholars, who lacked access to European library collections. It was also an inventive form of preservation in light of wartime threats to libraries. Queen Elizabeth knighted Power in the 1970s for this preservation work. In 1938, Power founded University Microfilms International, in Ann Arbor, Michigan, which is widely credited with having invented \"micropublishing.\" Later, the company would merge microfilm with xerography, helping to make out-of-print books available for circulation again. The company also pioneered a business model for publishing limited-interest doctoral dissertations, becoming the publisher of record for all U.S. dissertations in 1951. University Microfilms was acquired by the Xerox Corporation in 1962 for $8 million. Power continued to work for Xerox until his mandatory retirement in 1970 at the age of 65. In 1967 Mr. Power created the Power Foundation for philanthropy. He gave the Power Center for the Performing Arts to his alma mater, the University of Michigan, endowed a scholarship program at the university (affiliated for many years with Magdalene College at Cambridge University) and helped to buy the site of the Battle of Hastings in England to preserve it from real estate speculation. He died of Parkinson's disease in 1993."

  "text" : "Edward Thomas Gillon (21 January 1842 – 19 April 1896) was a New Zealand journalist and newspaper editor. Gillon was born on 21 January 1842 in Douglas, Isle of Man. He arrived in New Zealand with his parents in 1851 aboard the ship Maori and settled in Otago, where for several years he endured the rough experiences of settlement in a new country. While quite a youth he became a contributor to the Otago Witness, and was engaged reporting the Otago Provincial Council proceedings for that paper, when, in 1861, the Otago goldfields were discovered. Gillon was at once sent to Gabriel's Gully as special correspondent for the Otago Witness, and was the first press representative on the diggings. He remained there until recalled to Dunedin to again report in the Provincial Council, and he was so engaged when Julius Vogel arrived from Australia and, entering into partnership with William Cutten, the proprietor of the Otago Witness, established the Otago Daily Times, the first daily paper published in New Zealand. Gillon joined the Otago Daily Times staff as chief reporter, and remained on it until early the following year, when severe illness compelled him to relinquish newspaper work for a time. He accepted a Government appointment which, after two or three years, he resigned to resume journalistic work. In 1867 he went to Wellington as a member of the first Hansard staff, and was subsequently appointed Clerk of Private Bills to the New Zealand Parliament. He resigned this office after a brief tenure in order to devote himself exclusively to literary work, and became connected with the The Evening Post as well as acting as special correspondent for the Otago Daily Times, Lyttelton Times, and other leading journals. He contested the 1871 election, standing in the Wellington Country electorate against Alfred Brandon, who had been representing the area since 1858 (from 1860 to 1870, the area was covered by the Porirua electorate). Whilst there was criticism of Brandon not having had a good connection to his electorate, Brandon won with a solid majority. On 3 June 1875, Gillon was elected to the Wellington Provincial Council in the City of Wellington electorate. He served until provincial government was abolished in October 1876. Gillon stood in the 1875 election in the Wellington Country against the incumbent, Brandon, and J. H. Wallace. Brandon was again successful and received 208 votes versus 141 for Gillon, with Wallace a distant last. In 1872, when cable communication between Europe and Australia was first established, Sir Julius Vogel brought about a combination of New Zealand papers for obtaining supplies of telegraphic news, and Gillon was selected as manager. After a time this association handed its business over to a private firm, and Gillon rejoined The Evening Post as editor. In 1878 another press association was formed, and Gillon was again appointed manager. In less than two years this association absorbed all opposition, and developed into the United Press Association, which Gillon continued to manage with great success until 1884, when he resigned in order to resume his former position of editor of The Evening Post. Gillon was recognised as the doyen of New Zealand journalists, and when the Institute of Journalists was formed he was unanimously chosen as Chairman of the Council. At one time one of the prizes offered by the New Zealand Parliament for the best essays on the settlement of the people on the land was awarded to Gillon. He was a Justice of the Peace, and occupied a prominent position in the Freemasonry. As chairman of the central executive committee, he was the leading spirit in the movement which recently resulted successfully in the establishment of an independent Grand Lodge of New Zealand. As he declined to accept active office, the rank of Past Deputy Grand Master was conferred upon him, in recognition of his services to the craft. Gillon died in Wellington on 19 April 1896."

Her subject matter was mainly concerned with landscapes and Māori studies, in particular portraits of Maori women. Garlick was known for her pictorialism style. Garlick was born to a wealthy merchant family and was the seventh of ten children. As a result of her family's social position she was never required to work for a living. She became the first female member of the Auckland Photographic Society in July 1921.

  "text" : "Ernst Schlange (September 1, 1888 – † 1947) was a Nazi German politician, Gauleiter of Berlin-Brandenburg and a member of the Prussian Landtag. Severely wounded in World War I, he became active in various anti-Semitic far right political groups and eventually joined the National Socialist German Worker's Party in 1925. He was opposed to the party's more extreme tactics for gaining power and eventually ran afoul of Reich Minister of Propaganda and Gauleiter of Berlin, Joseph Goebbels. This caused Schlange to lose his leadership posts by the mid-1930s. He died under obscure circumstances at the end of World War II."

  "text" : "Esmond Samuel de Beer (15 September 1895–3 October 1990) was a New Zealand scholar, editor, collector, bibliophile and philanthropist. He was born in Dunedin, Otago on 15 September 1895. De Beer was the grandson of Dunedin businessman Bendix Hallenstein, founder of Hallenstein Bros., a major New Zealand retailers, and nephew of avid collector Willi Fels, from whom he developed a love of books. The De Beers moved to London in 1910 when Esmond's father Isidore was made manager of Hallensteins' London office. He was educated at Mill Hill School and in 1914 Esmond enrolled in New College, Oxford to read History. After serving on India's Northwest Frontier during World War I, Esmond returned to gain an MA at the University of London in 1923. De Beer worked as an editor for Clarendon Press, working on two massive and time-consuming projects, first the diary of John Evelyn (six volumes, published in 1955) and then the correspondence of John Locke. The latter work, published in eight volumes between 1976 and 1989, was left uncompleted at the time of De Beer's death. Though spending much of their life in England, De Beer and his sisters Mary and Dora always regarded New Zealand as their home, and were major benefactors of Dunedin's museums and libraries, most notably to the University of Otago Library, which was the recipient of Esmond's collection of rare books. The De Beers and cousin Charles Brasch were also driving forces behind the inauguration of the university's three arts fellowships: The Robert Burns Fellowship (writing), the Frances Hodgkins Fellowship (art), and the Mozart Fellowship (music). De Beer was also instrumental in helping the Otago Museum's quest to acquire much of his aunt, Agnes Barden's, art collection. Numerous other gifts were given to both of these institutions and to the Dunedin Public Art Gallery.Dunedin Public Library was also gifted with over 100 rare books, including many first editions of the works of Sir Walter Scott. De Beer also contributed to the library of the University of Essex and the Bodleian Library, among others. De Beer was a major figure in several notable institutions, including London's Historical Association (of which he was vice-president) and the Institute of Historical Research. He served as president of the Hakluyt Society, and was a trustee of the National Portrait Gallery. De Beer was named a fellow of the British Academy in 1965, was bestowed a similar honour by University College, London two years later, and was awarded honorary doctorates by the Otago, Oxford and Durham Universities. De Beer died in a nursing home in Stoke Hammond, Buckinghamshire on 3 October 1990, aged 95. Much of De Beer's correspondence, and that of his sisters (who predeceased him during the 1980s) is held by the Hocken Collections."

  "text" : "Ellen Crowe (c.1847 – 24 January 1930) was a New Zealand homemaker and community leader. She was born in Ballindooley, County Galway, Ireland on c.1847. She was the daughter of Bridget Cody and John Silke of Ballindooley, parish of Castlegar, County Galway, about 1847. When about 12 or 13, she was promised in marriage to John Crowe but by the time Ellen was 18 or 19, he had emigrated to New Zealand. Ned Crowe, John's brother, visited the family to tell them that John would send for Ellen. Silke was one of several hundred single women who received free passages from Ireland to New Zealand in the late 1860s under a Canterbury provincial government immigration scheme. Ellen travelled with Catherine Francis and Mary Broderick, also from Galway. The three sailed from London on the Bombay, arriving at Lyttelton on 18 August 1866. It is unknown how she spent her first eighteen months, but it was probably in service. She married John Crowe at Christchurch's Catholic church on 24 February 1868. Following their marriage, the couple lived near Temuka, near Milford, where many of their nine children were born. Ellen nominated her sister, Mary, widowed mother, Bridget, and brothers John, Martin, William, and Patrick, for passage to New Zealand between 1871 and 1876. Mary Silke married James Kean and settled in Southland, where the Crowe family moved in 1882, and bought a farm, which however only became arable after much clearance work. The Silke brothers also became farmers in the area. Crowe became \"a central figure in her small community ... part of the Irish Catholic enclave within Southland's predominantly Scots Presbyterian population.\" Her husband died in 1914, and she died at the home of her daughter in Otautau on 24 January 1930."

  "text" : "Elizabeth Caradus (26 April 1832 – 5 November 1912) was a New Zealand suffragist, temperance and welfare worker. She was born in Falkirk, Stirlingshire, Scotland on 26 April 1832 to Elizabeth Adam and David Russell, a carpenter. The family emigrated to Auckland, New Zealand in 1842 on the Jane Gifford. She married James Caradus (born 1823 in Ayrshire, Scotland) James arrived at the same time on the  Duchess of Argyle. James and Elizabeth were married on 10 October 1848 (the sixth anniversary of their arrival in Auckland), when he was 25 and she only 16 and they established a home in Robinson St in the Village of Parnell. James worked as a rope-maker in Mechanics Bay. They had 15 children, of whom seven died in infancy, as was not uncommon in those days. James became an expert rope-maker and in 1850 started his own ropewalk in Hobson St, making a wide variety of twines and ropes from dressed New Zealand flax. He exhibited several specimens of his work at the Great Exhibition in London in 1851. Eventually, it became so difficult to obtain supplies of dressed flax from the Maori that he gave up the ropemaking trade. James then went to the goldfields in Otago, Ballarat in Australia, and Thames, without luck. While he was away, Elizabeth ran a small shop he had built on the front of their house in Napier St, Freemans Bay. The shop was owned by the family until 1910. The family later found security by renting out cottages built by James around the Freemans Bay area of Auckland. During this period Freemans Bay was an industrial slum with coal and lime traders, glass and asphalt works and the town morgue. Elizabeth become involved in the Ladies' Christian Association, which became the third constituent member of the YWCA. She attended the first meetings of the Women's Christian Temperance Union and the Women's Franchise League and the National Council of Women of New Zealand where she was a leading figure. Unusually for sufferance leaders, she came from a working-class background; she did not write many letters but she spoke frequently and commonly moved motions. As well as campaigning for temperance and suffrage, she also campaigned against the Contagious Diseases Act 1869, which gave police considerable powers against women suspected of being 'common prostitutes' to combat venereal disease, but took no action against men. The New Zealand Contagious Diseases Acts were a reflection of those in the UK which had initially been restricted to naval and army barracks, but soon spread country-wide. Caradus' signature appears on sheet 406 of the 1893 Women's Suffrage Petition, collected in Auckland. She died in Auckland on 5 November 1912, survived by seven children."

During the 1980s, Kross was a leading figure in the anti-Soviet resistance movement in Soviet Estonia. After reindependence, in 1991, he joined Estonia's Foreign Ministry. He served as the head of intelligence from 1995 to 2000; and as national security advisor to former President Lennart Meri in 2000-2001. Kross represented Estonia as a diplomat in the UK, from 1990–92; then in the USA, from 1992-95.

He was an advisor to the Government of Georgia during and after its war with Russia in 2008. He coordinated the Georgian information campaign. As an astute observer of foreign affairs, he has published more than a 100 articles on Russian foreign policy, NATO and Estonian-Russian relations. Kross is a well known critic of the Russian foreign policy and Vladimir Putin. In 2011, Russian authorities accused him of masterminding the 2009 hijacking of the MV Arctic Sea off the coast of Sweden. The Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee in Estonia, rejected this accusation as a fabrication by Russia's FSB; although Estonia's Government has conceded that Russia has many reasons for hating Kross. Kross joined the moderate-conservative IRL in November, 2011, and was elected to the Party Executive. He served on the Advisory Board to the Ministry of Defense. Kross has published several books and written scripts for documentary films. He wrote the script for the 2006 documentary, The Blue Hills (Sinimäed), which received the Estonian Cultural Foundation's Film of the Year Award; also, special mention at the Tallinn Black Nights Film Festival."

  "text" : "Eliza Barchus (December 4, 1857 – December 31, 1959) was a prolific, prize-winning landscape painter who lived in Portland in the U.S. state of Oregon for most of her life. Born in Salt Lake City, Utah, Barchus moved to Portland in 1880. After taking art lessons from another landscape painter, Will S. Parrott, Barchus sold her first painting in 1885. Between then and 1935, she produced thousands of oil paintings and reproductions of subjects such as Mount Hood, Yellowstone Falls, Muir Glacier, and San Francisco Bay. Barchus, who had won medals at Mechanics Fairs in Portland in the late 1880s, drew national attention in 1890, when one of her large canvases of Mount Hood was displayed at the National Academy of Design exhibition in New York City. In 1901, several of her works were shown at the Pan-American Exposition in Buffalo, New York, and in 1905 she won a gold medal at the Lewis and Clark Centennial Exposition in Portland for oil paintings of Pacific coast scenery. Widowed in 1899, Barchus supported herself and her family for decades largely by selling or trading her art. Several years after her death at age 102, the Oregon Legislative Assembly named her \"The Oregon Artist\". Many art collections in Portland and elsewhere include examples of her work."

  "text" : "Eugene J. \"Gene\" Gerberg (1919–2011) was an American entomologist and entomological entrepreneur. Born June 1, 1919 in Brooklyn, New York, Gerberg completed a Bachelor of Science degree in Entomology in 1939, and then a Master of Science degree in 1941, both at Cornell University, Ithaca, New York. In 1941, Gerberg accepted a commission as First Lieutenant in the U.S. Public Health Service. His first assignment was with the Malaria Control in War Areas (MCWA) unit at New Smyrna Beach, Florida, established to control malaria around military training bases in areas where mosquitoes were abundant, to prevent reintroduction of malaria into the civilian population by mosquitoes feeding on malaria-infected soldiers. MCWA, the forerunner of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, also trained state and local health department officials in malaria control strategies and techniques. In 1943, Gerberg was commissioned a Second Lieutenant in the U.S. Army Sanitary Corps and assigned as Assistant Camp Medical Inspector for Camp Lee, Virginia, charged with ridding the barracks of an infestation of bed bugs so severe it had received Congressional attention. After the war, he transferred to the U.S. Army Reserves to continue his military service. In 1946, Gerberg co-founded Insect Control & Research in Baltimore, Maryland, a business venture that became highly successful for him and his partners. In 1954, he completed his Doctor of Philosophy degree in entomology and plant pathology at the University of Maryland, College Park, Maryland. Dr. Gerberg's notable achievements include several seminal publications. He authored the first U.S. Public Health Service pictorial key for the identification of anopheline mosquito larvae for the national malaria control program (1943), a revision of the New World species of powder post beetles of the family Lyctidae (1957), a manual for mosquito rearing and experimental techniques (1970), a manual of Florida butterflies (1989), and a bibliography of publications dealing with repellents effective against blood-feeding arthropods and leeches (2001). For many years, he single-handedly updated and published the World Directory of Arthropod Vector Research & Control Specialists on an annual basis. In the 1990s, Dr. Gerberg retired as a Colonel from the U.S. Army Medical Service Corps and an Adjunct Professor of Entomology at the University of Florida, but remained active in the entomology community. He died in Gainesville, Florida, on December 19, 2011, at the age of 92."

  "text" : "Edwin James Greenfield Ward (26 October 1919 – 22 November 2005) was the longest-serving Chaplain to the Sovereign, from 1955 until his death. He was also Archdeacon of Sherborne from 1967 to 1984. Ward was born in Australia on 26 October 1919, but his family soon returned to England and he was educated at St John's School, Leatherhead and Christ's College, Cambridge. Taking a commission with the King's Dragoon Guards at the outbreak of World War II, he was captured in 1940 and spent the rest of the war as a prisoner of war, mainly in northern Italy. After his release he returned to study at the theological college of Ridley Hall in Cambridge, and was ordained in 1948, becoming first a curate in East Dereham, Norfolk, then vicar of North Elmham, also in Norfolk, from 1950 to 1955. In 1955, the Clerk of the Closet recommended Ward for appointment as one of the Chaplains to the Sovereign, part of the Ecclesiastical Household. He was Chaplain of the Royal Chapel in Windsor Great Park and was responsible for the Sunday services attended by the Queen, the Duke of Edinburgh and other members of the Royal Household. He also had pastoral responsibility for the 1,800 employees of the Windsor estate. According to Ward's obituary, his youth and his tact and diplomacy served him well at this post and he made many friends in royal circles. Since he continued to be a Royal Chaplain for the rest of his long life, he became the longest-serving holder of this position. In 1963 he was admitted as a Lieutenant of the Royal Victorian Order, and in 1967 was appointed as Archdeacon of Sherborne and Rector of West Stafford in Dorset, holding both positions until his retirement at the end of 1984. Ward was also a canon and prebendary of Salisbury Cathedral, working there on several committees, notably one that dealt with the care of church buildings. After his retirement he lived at Alresford in Hampshire until his death on 22 November 2005. His wife, Grizell, had died in 1985 and he was survived by three children; one of his daughters married John Wakeham, Baron Wakeham."

  "text" : "Sir Edward Coey (March 1805- 26 June 1887) was a 19th Century entrepreneur and philanthropist from Larne in County Antrim. He helped fund the establishment of Larne Grammar School in his town of birth, and was mayor of Belfast. Coey was born in Larne, and commenced work as an apprentice butcher. He started to build his own business, and became the proprietor of the 'Northern Shoe & Boot House' in Belfast, with his brother James. After a short period working in the USA, Coey established a provisions and curing business in the dockland district of Belfast in 1841, called Coey & Co. This business was very successful, and led to Coey developing his business interests including property in Belfast, London, Liverpool and in the United States. Coey represented the St George's Ward in Belfast as a councillor, and in 1861 became the first and only Liberal to serve as Mayor of Belfast. He was knighted in the same year in recognition of his public works, and in 1867 was appointed Deputy Lieutenant and High Sheriff of County Antrim. He was also a Borough Magistrate in Belfast, member of the Grand Jury and Belfast Harbour Commissioners, and in July 1869, was one of the eight founding subscribers of the Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry. He is remembered for his philanthropic work, the most notable of which was his donation to establish, together with John Crawford, a grammar school in his home town of Larne, which was opened as Larne Grammar School in 1886. However, Coey's philanthropic work was much more widespread than this. He was a donor to causes as varied as the Belfast Charitable Society, the Presbyterian Orphan Society, and the Presbyterian Sabbath School. He was Patron of the Belfast Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, the Belfast Sailors Home, and the Malone Protestant Reformatory, a life Governor of the Belfast Royal Hospital, a Governor of the Belfast District Hospital for the Insane Poor, and Belfast Ophthalmic Hospital. On 18 November 2006, the Ulster History Circle unveiled a blue plaque in his honour at his former home, Merville House, in Merville Garden Village, where he died on 27 June 1887."

  "text" : "Eugene F. Stoermer (March 7, 1934 – February 17, 2012) was a leading researcher in diatoms, with a special emphasis on freshwater species of the North American Great Lakes. He was a professor of biology at the University of Michigan School of Natural Resources and Environment. His Bachelor of Science degree was obtained in 1958 and his Doctor of Science in 1963, both from Iowa State University. His doctoral thesis was \"Post-pleistocene diatoms from Lake West Okoboji, Iowa\" Stoermer originally coined and used the term Anthropocene from the early 1980s to refer to the impact and evidence for the impact of human activities on the planet earth. The word was not used in general culture until it was popularized in 2000 by Nobel Prize-winning atmospheric chemist Paul Crutzen and others who regard the influence of human behavior on Earth's atmosphere in recent centuries as so significant as to constitute a new geological epoch. He is the co-author with J. P. Smol of The Diatoms Applications for the Environmental and Earth Sciences. Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press, 1999. ISBN 0511155069; According to WorldCat, the book is held in 1262 libraries In 2009, he received the honor of a festschrift, Diatom taxonomy, ultrastructure, and ecology : modern methods and timeless questions : a tribute to Eugene F.

  "text" : "Empress Liu (1079–1113) was a Chinese Empress consort of the Song Dynasty, married to Emperor Zhezong of Song. Liu's background is not known. She was selected as one of the consorts of Emperor Zhezong, while Empress Meng became his empress. However, Consort Liu was to become his personal favorite. They had one son and four daughters together. The relationship between Meng and Zhezong was not a good one, and Zhezong resented her, possible because she had been chosen for him by the Empress Dowager Regent Gao. Reportedly, he tolerated, and maybe even encouraged, Consort Liu, to be rude to empress Meng. Her mother-in-law, Dowager Empress Xiang, however, favored empress Meng against her, though she later admitted, that both Meng and Liu had a temper and were both to blame for their infected rivalry, which caused several scenes at court. In 1096, a scandal occurred when empress Meng was accused of witchcraft. When her infant daughter became ill, the empress had asked her sister for advice. Her sister had brought her \"talisman-water\", which was used by daoist-priest to cure illness. Meng had protested because such practices were banned in the palace, but the emperor commented that it was harmless. Nonetheless, rumors of witchcraft started to surround the empress. When the baby's illness grew worse, the empress noticed \"token paper money\" beside the child and suspected Consort Liu of using witchcraft against her. Soon after, a nun, a eunuch, and the adoptive mother of Meng was accused of having used witchcraft to help the empress, thereby implicating her. Thirty palace women and eunuchs were tortured during the investigation. The nun and the eunuch was executed, accused of having used black magic toward Consort Liu, and the adoptive mother of Meng was executed accused of having used magic to make the emperor fall in love with the empress. Empress Meng herself was stripped from her title and sent to a Daoist nunnery. In 1099, Liu had a son with the emperor, which gave him the wish to make her empress. In 27 December 1100, Consort Liu was elevated to the position of empress, which was not approved by Empress Dowager Xiang and met with protests from several officials, as many blamed Liu for the witch trial and demotion of empress Meng. In 1100, Emperor Zhezong was succeed by his brother, Emperor Huizong of Song. He had his legal mother, the Dowager Empress Xiang, appointed his co-regent. Empress Xiang also used her power as co-regent to push her view, that Emperor Zhezong had done wrong by demoting Empress Meng in favor of Empress Liu. She declared, that the demotion had been forged, and that Meng should be given back the states of Empress, while Liu should bee stripped from hers. This led to a conflict with the council, who argued that an emperor could not change the status of his late brother's widow. The affairs ended with a compromise: on 23 June 1100, Xiang succeeded with having the status of empress returned to Meng, but was prevented from stripping Liu of her title, resulting in Emperor Zhezong having two Empress Dowagers. Not much more is known of Empress Dowager Liu. In 1113, it was reported that she had been forced to commit suicide by \"those close to her\", after they had reported her to the ministers for meddling i state affairs, which caused the ministers to contemplate demoting her."

[He] did not issue press releases for clients or deal with the press in a public relations capacity.\" Newsom believed that the American social model of self-governance put corporate virtue at a premium. He refuted Gustav Le Bon (1898) The Crowd – A Study of Public Mind, where the capacity of man to think collectively is denigrated. Newsom also maintained that \"an enlightened and socially responsible performance is the only sound base for a favourable public relationship.\" Newsom has been recognized by the New York Times as being one of the most influential public relations counselors in the history of private industry."

Lehman College of the City University of New York (CUNY) and a member of the doctoral faculty at the CUNY Graduate School. Chudnovsky is a Fellow of the American Physical Society (APS), elected 1993 for \"seminal contributions to random ferromagnetism, macroscopic quantum tunneling, and hexatic order in high Tc materials\". He is mostly known for his work on quantum tunneling of magnetization. Chudnovsky explained magnetic avalanches experimentally observed in molecular magnets as deflagration. Chudnovsky received his undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral education at Kharkov University in Ukraine, in a school of theoretical physics built by Lev Landau and his students. The denial by USSR of exit visa to Chudnovsky in 1979 led to his unemployment for eight years during which he continued independent research in theoretical physics and participated in the unofficial Refusenik Science Seminar in Moscow. He was frequently harassed and interrogated by the KGB. In 1987 Chudnovsky was allowed to emigrate and joined the faculty of the Physics Department of Tufts University in Boston. The following year he moved to the City University of New York (CUNY). He has held visiting positions at research centers in the USA, Asia, and Europe—most notably at the University of Barcelona - Spain, where he co-organizes Annual International Workshop on Magnetism and Superconductivity. Chudnovsky has been active in the field of human rights. He has served as Chair of the APS Committee on International Freedom of Scientists, Member-at-Large of the Forum on International Physics, Chair of the Committee on Human Rights of Scientists of the New York Academy of Sciences, and Co-Chair of the Committee of Concerned Scientists. In 1990s he directed Program for Refugee Scientists that resettled over one hundred refugee scientists in the United States."

  "text" : "Eliza Carpenter (1851-December 16, 1924) was a race horse owner and jockey who was born an enslaved person and achieved success as the only African-American horse racer in early Oklahoma. For more than thirty years she owned and raced a number of Thoroughbred horses in country circuits, winning many races and considerable money. Born in Virginia some 10 years prior to the outbreak of the American Civil War, at 6 years of age Carpenter was sold to a slave owner in Madison County, Kentucky. Two years later, at age 8, she was sold to a planter in Missouri. Gaining her freedom at the end of the Civil War, she returned to Madisonville, Kentucky, where she learned the business of buying, training, and riding race horses. She then moved to Kansas where she purchased several horses. When the Cherokee Outlet was opened for settlement in 1893, she joined in the race for new land. A $1,000 prize was offered to the first person to reach the site of Ponca City, generating a heated race with Carpenter as one of the competitors. She rode her horse like a man and covered twelve miles in forty-five minutes. Some sources say that she was the first to stake a claim, while other sources say that she did not win the race. She reportedly staked out a good farm, but lost it due to describing its metes and bounds inaccurately at the land office. By 1900 she was living at 491 Grand Avenue in Ponca City, Oklahoma where her occupation was given in that year's United States census as a \"trader [of] live stock.\" The same record shows her to be a single woman, born in December 1851. In Ponca City, she trained Thoroughbreds, quarter horses, and other horses for racing, becoming one of the few African-American stable owners in the West. When dissatisfied with the way a race was going, she sometimes would ride her own horses as a jockey, winning some races. Recorded names of her horses include \"Irish Maid\", \"Blue Bird\", \"Jimmy Rain\", \"Sam Carpenter\", and \"Little Brown Jug\", the last of which she reportedly raced at Tijuana, Baja California. In a September 1920 recreation of the 1893 Cherokee Outlet land rush, she won the race, driving two fast ponies hitched to a buggy while standing erect like a Roman charioteer. On a visit to family in Kentucky in 1924, she was thrown from a buggy when her Thoroughbred horse spooked, suffering a fractured skull. She returned to Ponca City in August 1924 where she suffered a stroke resulting in paralysis, and died on Tuesday, December 16, 1924."

  "text" : "General Edward Buckley Wynyard CB (1788 – 24 November 1864) was a British Army officer. He was born in Kensington Palace, London, the son of Lieutenant-General William Wynyard, Colonel of the 20th Foot. He joined the Army himself as an ensign in 1803 and first served in Sicily. In 1809 he took part in the capture of the islands of Ischia and Procida and served under Lieutenant-General Sir John Oswald in the Ionian Islands but was severely wounded at Santa Maura and returned to London. In 1811 he was appointed aide-de-camp to Sir Harry Burrard and then brigade-major under Sir Moore Disney although his wound prevented him from serving with the brigade at Bergen op Zoom. In 1814 he was promoted lieutenant-colonel of the 58th Foot. In 1816-20 he served on St Helena as military secretary to the Governor, Sir Hudson Lowe and in July 1830 was appointed aide-de-camp to William IV and promoted to colonel in the Grenadier Guards. In 1837 he was placed on half-pay and in the 1838 Coronation Honours made a Companion of the Order of the Bath. In November 1841 he was promoted major-general and in September 1847 put in command of the troops in New South Wales, Van Diemen's Land and New Zealand. During his time in Australia he was a member of the Legislative Council in 1848-51 and of the Executive Council in 1848-53. He was made lieutenant-general in 1851 and given the colonelcy of the 58th (Rutlandshire) Regiment of Foot for life. In 1853 he returned home to England where in January 1860 he was promoted full general. He died of bronchitis in London on 24 November 1864 and was laid to rest in Catacomb B, Kensal Green Cemetery. He had married Louisa Warner and had several children. He left his name to Wynyard Square, Sydney, and probably the town Wynyard in northern Tasmania which he visited in 1850-51."

Once Eric had furthered his education he returned to Papua and New Guinea where he then established a private practice. He would eventually marry his receptionist named Shirley May Chan Wong, née Hee. After accomplishing many other things in Papua and New Guinea Eric's health began to deteriorate so he returned to Sydney to be with his family.

  "text" : "Edgar Lissel, born 1965 in Northeim, Germany is a visual artist. He studied photography at the University of Applied Sciences Darmstadt. Since 1993 he has been working as a visual artist. In his interdisciplinary projects he searches for traces of the tension between natural science, archeology, arthistory and artistic work while examining pictorial processes and the ephemeral state of images. In his early works Edgar Lissel has been using the camera obscura and converted a transporter into a mobile pinhole camera. With his works about the italian fascism and the German national socialism he has been invited to the Venice Architecture Biennale in 1996. His works \"Räume“ are based around living quarters and museum displays which he converted into walk-in pinhole cameras. Simple optical principles combine the upside down scene outside the pinhole camera with the silhouettes of the objects inside the camera. Since 1999, Edgar Lissel has been working with bacteria, using their phototropic properties to produce his images. The bacteria move out of the shadowed areas into the light. At the Domus Aurea (Rome) he collaborated with microbiologists from the University of Rome and archeologists of the Soprintendenza Roma in examining the decay of frescoes caused by contamination from a culture of bacteria. In his artistic realisation he used the same bacteria, which are destroying the “original” site, as active participants in a constructive image process. Since 2004 Edgar Lissel is using his skin flora for his artistic image production. By physical contact with a nutrient agar his body leaves traces in the form of bacterial colonies, which mirror the contours of his body."

  "text" : "Ernest Mosny (4 January 1861 – 25 April 1918) was a French physician and hygienist born in La Fère, Aisne. Mosny served as médecin des hopitaux in Paris, and was a member of the Académie de Médecine and the Conseil supérieur d'hygiène. He is remembered for his work in the field of microbiology. With Joaquín Albarrán (1860-1912) he performed a series of tests in an attempt to find an antidote to the colon bacillus. Eventually the two scientists developed a vaccine that achieved a high degree of immunity in dogs and rabbits. In 1912 with biologist Edouard Dujardin-Beaumetz (1868-1947), he studied the effects of bubonic plague in two Alpine marmots during hibernation. Reportedly, the marmots were able to survive 61 & 115 days after being injected with the disease. In 1911 Mosny reported the first successful embolectomy, a direct arterial surgical procedure that was performed on the femoral artery."

He joined as chief telegrapher in Western Union telegraph company's New York office at Manhattan. While working with Western Union, he encounter a group of rushing messenger boys which inspired him to improve exchange communications. These young men called runners had to dash from the Stock Exchange to their offices to report the changes in share values. Calahan realized that the prices could be sent directly via telegraph to each broker's office much more quickly and efficiently in a permanent stream of information.With the idea, he invented ticker tape in 1867. He was inducted to the National Inventors Hall of Fame in 2006 for this invention."

  "text" : "Ernest Nordli (June 15, 1912 - April 22, 1968) was an American animation designer and layout artist, most notably for Walt Disney Studios. He was born in Salt Lake City, Utah to Norwegian immigrant Hans Magnus Nordli (1884-1975) and Hedvig Charlotte Esterblom (1888-1976) who was of Swedish heritage. He studied art at the Santa Barbara School of the Arts. Nordli, nicknamed \"Ernie\", was a talented artist whose work had an appealing modern sensibility. He started at Disney in 1936 and served as an art director/layout artist on Dumbo and Fantasia, and worked on many of the studio's shorts through the mid-1940s, including such Donald Duck shorts as The Plastics Inventor and Donald's Double Trouble. He left Disney and in the 1950s became the layout artist for Chuck Jones, in the absence of Maurice Noble. He was the layout man on eight Jones shorts, including some memorable films like Broom-Stick Bunny and Rocket-bye Baby (both 1956). After his short stint with Jones, Nordli returned to Disney where he worked on Sleeping Beauty and One Hundred and One Dalmatians, on which he was a layout stylist. He played an important role in designing the background drawing style on Dalmatians. Nordli continued working until his death. His later credits include The Alvin Show, Gay Purr-ee (1962), Hey There, It's Yogi Bear! (1964), The Man from Button Willow (1965) and the show Johnny Cypher in Dimension Zero. In the early-1950s, Nordli also designed many covers for Dell Comics including for issues featuring Lone Ranger, Cisco Kid and Red Ryder. He died in 1968 at age 55 in San Francisco, California. Fellow layout artist Walt Peregoy stated the opinion said that he may have committed suicide."
