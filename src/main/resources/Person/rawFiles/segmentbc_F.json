He was an extensive land owner in a number of English counties, and was a justice of the peace for Buckinghamshire and the County of London, and a Deputy Lieutenant of Middlesex. In June 1886 he was unanimously selected by the Conservative Party to contest the seat of Finsbury Central. Penton won the seat, unseating the sitting Liberal Party member of parliament, Howard Spensley, by the narrow margin of 5 votes. At the next general election in 1892 he was defeated by Dadabhai Naoroji, who won the seat by 3 votes following a recount. In April 1893 he indicated that he would not stand for parliament again. He was High Sheriff of Buckinghamshire for the year 1896. He died at his home in South Kensington in June 1929, and was buried at St Peter's Church, Old Steine, Brighton."

  "text" : "Flora Adams Darling (July 25, 1840 – January 6, 1910) was an American author. She is primarily noted for playing a role in founding the Daughters of the American Revolution in 1890. She was born Sophronia A. Adams in Lancaster, New Hampshire, the fifth of eleven children of Harvey Adams, a member of the Adams political family, and his second wife Nancy Dustin Adams, née Rowell. She is still listed as \"Fronia Adams\" on the 1860 census, and is living in Lancaster with her family at age nineteen. At some point after this, she changed her name to Flora. She was educated at Lancaster and Sanbornton. In later life, she claimed to have been married in New York City on March 12, 1860, to Edward Irving Darling on March 12, 1860, a man 22 years her senior. The couple had an only son, Edward Irving Darling, Jr., born October 9, 1862. She maintained that her husband died December 2, 1863 from wounds received on November 29 at the first Battle of Franklin, Tennessee; where she claims that Edward was serving as a brigadier-general in the Confederate Army. Flora then attempted to travel north to her home and son under a flag of truce, but was taken by the Federals as a prisoner of war. Later, following an appeal lasting 30 years, she won a case against the Federal government for false imprisonment and theft of her possessions, and was awarded $5,683. Despite growing increasingly deaf following the war, Flora became a prolific writer who was published in magazines and journals, and wrote a number of novels and short stories. In 1886, based on the merits of her writing, she was granted an honorary A.M. from Western Maryland College. She was also awarded an honorary degree from the Kentucky Military Institute. She lived in Washington, D. C. for forty years, where she was socially active and developed an interest in founding patriotic societies. Flora played a role in founding the Daughters of the American Revolution on October 11, 1890, although the society does not recognize her as one of its founders. She then founded the General Society of Daughters of the Revolution on June 18, 1891, and the National Society, United States Daughters of 1812 on January 8, 1892. Each society was founded in turn because of disagreements she held with members of the previous organization. In 1910, while visiting her brother in New York, she died of apoplexy. Female members of the National Society, United States Daughters of 1812 between the age of 18 to 35 are termed \"Flora Adams Darling Daughters\" in her memory."

He married Gertrud Sabersky, a student of the artist Walter Leistikow, and his own portrait was painted by Lovis Corinth in 1899. After a hand injury meant that he could no longer perform surgery, he turned to writing about antiquity. He was interested in numismatics, and a friend of the numismatist Edward Gans. His biography of Julius Caesar was translated into French and English, and widely reviewed. The book inspired Thornton Wilder to write his own novel about Caesar, The Ides of March. Mainzer was a close friend of the Catholic priest Friedrich von Erxleben, who was a member of the Solf Circle of intellectuals involved in the resistance against Nazism. Mainzer and his family were helped to escape to England by the daughter of Wilhelm and Hanna Solf, the Countess So'oa'emalelagi \"Lagi\" von Ballestrem-Solf, who escorted them with their jewellery hidden in the lining of her clothes. Mainzer died 3 January 1943. His daughter Luci Manén married Otto John in 1949."

From 1918 to 1920 he taught a specialized course in educational psychology for school doctors at the normal school at Sucre in Bolivia.

  "text" : "Ferdinand Bernhard Vietz (18 November 1772 Vienna – 15 December 1815 Vienna), was an Austrian pharmacologist, a Doctor of the Healing Arts and Professor of Forensic Medicine at the University of Vienna, and is best known for Icones Plantarum Medico-Oeconomico-Technologicarum cum Earum Fructus ususque Descriptione (1800–1822), an 11-volume compilation of medicinal, culinary and decorative plant species consulted by pharmacologists during the early 1800s. The noted cartographic engraver, Ignaz Alberti, worked on the 1100 hand-coloured copperplate engravings on laid-watermarked paper and completed the work after the early death of Vietz. Volumes 1 and 2 were printed in Latin and German in adjacent columns. Volumes 3-10 have the title in German only. Volume 11 is a supplementary volume by Joseph Lorenz Kendl. In the introduction to Volume 1, Vietz lists a lengthy bibliography of consulted works, an enormous number of sponsors and a dedication to Maria Theresa, Empress of Austria. Vietz's monumental work is extremely rare, and the British Natural History Museum writes:The work is “not being held in any other of the United Kingdom's national or public library collections. Only three copies have been found in North American libraries, of which two are certainly fragile and in need of conservation. One copy is in the Austrian National Library.” On his death, Vietz was succeeded by Joseph Bernt (1770–1842), as professor of state medicine. The standard author abbreviation Vietz is used to indicate this individual as the author when citing a botanical name."

  "text" : "Francis W. Wilson (1870 - 1947) was an American architect. His practice in Santa Barbara, California included work for the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway and its associated Fred Harvey Company hotels, as well as many residences. Wilson was born in Massachusetts and arrived in California at the age of 17 to visit his sister, a schoolteacher in Placerville. There, he worked as a log-driver on the American River and then as a surveyor for the Southern Pacific Railroad. He moved to San Francisco in the early 1890s, becoming a draftsman for the firm of Pissis and Moore, where he was instructed by architect Albert Pissis. Wilson studied at the San Francisco chapter of the American Institute of Architects and took a grand tour of Europe before establishing his own firm in Santa Barbara in 1895. Shortly after arriving in Santa Barbara, Wilson designed homes for Dr. C.C. Park and General Henry J. Strong. He built up a practice designing homes for the wealthy, as well as designing, building and selling speculative houses. His connections with the wealthy led to an interest in polo and amateur horse racing, and to commissions for the Santa Barbara Club, the Central Savings Bank, the Santa Barbara library, post office, and railroad station. A friendship with Edward Payson Ripley, president of the Santa Fe Railway, led to commissions for the railway and for the Fred Harvey Company, as well as a commission to design Ripley's winter home. His most extravagant residential commission, Las Tejas in the suburb of Montecito, was built in 1917 for Oakleigh Thorne. Wilson married Julia Redington, sister of Wilson's friend and fellow Santa Barbara Polo Club member Lawrence Redington, in 1905."

  "text" : "Francis Walter \"Frank\" Lundie (1 March 1866 – 13 July 1933) was an Australian trade unionist. Lundie was born at Port Adelaide to railway labourer John Lundie and Maryann Josephine, née Moran. He was educated at local public schools but at the age of eleven began working as a station-hand in western New South Wales. He joined the Amalgamated Shearers' Union (which became the Australian Workers' Union in 1894) in 1887 and was president of the Adelaide branch from 1889. He served as an organiser from 1892 until his appointment as secretary from 1900, a position he would hold until his death in 1933. He was a leader of the 1894 shearers' strike and was president of the United Labourers' Union's South Australian branch from 1907 to 1912. He married Elizabeth Margaret Battens Armstrong on 20 January 1891; she died in 1907, and he remarried on 20 January 1909 to Edith Mary Armstrong. A moderate supporter of direct action, Lundie was also a member of the United Labor Party and strongly believed it should remain under the control of the working class rather than politicians and union leaders. He engaged in bitter disputes with the Verran Labor government in 1910, and continued low-level opposition to the party leadership until 1917, when he was able to harness the resentment over the conscription split to take over the party. Lundie was elected president of the party executive and later that year defeated William Spence to become the AWU's national president, a position he held until his own defeat by Arthur Blakeley in 1919. His attempts at direct political involvement had been less successful: he was defeated for the Senate in 1917 and 1919 and for the South Australian House of Assembly in 1905 and 1924. He was, however, a member of Port Adelaide City Council from 1900 to 1909 and Adelaide City Council from 1909 to 1931. A teetotaller, Lundie died in 1933; his funeral was attended by around a thousand people. An ex-prisoners' hostel in Whitmore Square was named after him in 1963."

  "text" : "Frederick John Riley (18 May 1886 – 2 April 1970) was an Australian political activist and trade unionist. Riley was born at Stirling in South Australia to blacksmith Frederick Riley, an early Labor Party activist and local councillor, and Susannah, née Williams. He left school at twelve and worked as a labourer. During a period in Sydney he was involved in socialist circles with Harry Holland. He was imprisoned for a week at Wollongong in 1914 after ignoring a policeman's demand to stop addressing a free speech public meeting. He became secretary of the Australian Peace Alliance's Victorian council in 1916, and was often fined over involvement in brawls at anti-conscription demonstrations; on one occasion he received a fine after protecting female speakers, including Vida Goldstein, from off-duty soldiers. A founding member and later secretary of the Y Club socialist discussion group, he participated in the 1919 Melbourne waterfront strike and helped negotiate a settlement. He married Alice Ann Warburton, née Large, on 27 April 1920 in a civil ceremony. In 1922 he was appointed secretary of the Manufacturing Grocers' Employees' Federation of Australia and became a highly successful union leader. From 1931 to 1932 he was President of the Trades Hall Council, and he served as president of the Victorian branch of the Australian Labor Party from 1941 to 1942. In 1942 he became an adviser to the Commonwealth prices commissioner. His wife had died in 1940, and on 17 July 1943 he married Annie Elliott Warn. Riley was a member of the ALP's anti-communist right wing and was refused admission to the 1955 federal conference; despite his non-Catholicism he joined the Democratic Labor Party, of which he was Victorian president from 1960 to 1961, when he retired from public life. He died in 1970 at Reservoir."

Crone served on Vancouver City council from 1920 to 1923 and from 1936 to 1939 and on the city's Park Board from 1929 to 1936. He placed second in the 1929 Vancouver mayoralty race.

  "text" : "Fares Mohammed Mana'a (born February 8, 1965) is a top Yemeni arms-dealer, businessman, rebel commander and politician. He is said to be Yemen's most famous arms-dealer. Mana'a was born on February 8, 1965 in the northern city of Sa'dah and was an ally of Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh and member of his ruling GPC party and served as head of his presidential committee and as head of a local council tasked with mediating a peace-deal between the Yemeni government and Houthis during the Shia insurgency in Yemen. His brother was the governor of Saada Governorate at the time. His name was put on a UN Security Council list of people accused of trafficking arms to Somali Islamist insurgent group Al-Shabaab, which is considered as a terrorist organisation by the United States and is accused of with al-Qaeda. This led to his assets being frozen by the U.S. Department of the Treasury. He was also accused of receiving millions in funds from the then Libyan ruler Muammar Gaddafi, spying for Libya and supplying arms to the Houthis. Mana'a denied these charges claiming that arms had been stolen by Houthis from an arms deposit he owned. In October 2009 was put at the top of a blacklist of Yemeni arms-dealers, after which he was put under surveillance. In late January 2010, Mana'a was arrested by Yemeni authorities leading to protests in Sa'dah by tribal chiefs and the resignation of his brother, Hassan Mana'a, as governor. In May, a mini-bus driver was killed and a policeman and a civilian woman were injured as a group of Manaa's men attacked the car in which he was being transported to a penal court. This resulted in his trial being delayed by 25 days. He was eventually released on June 4, after which his relations with President Saleh soured. On March 19, Houthis attacked the city of Sa'dah, starting a battle with pro-government al-Abdin tribesmen, led by Yemeni lawmaker Sheikh Othman Majali. During the battle, rebels joined forces with Fares Mana'a and after their victory, set up a local committee, composed of rebels, residents and defected military commanders, which appointed him as the new governor of Sa'dah on 26 March, after the pro-Saleh governor Taha Hajer fled to the capital Sana'a. He led the Houthis independent administration in Sa'dah governorate until December 2014."

An active member of the Cabinetmakers Guild from 1927, he was admired by his peers for the high quality of his craftsmanship. Many of his pieces were crafted in exotic woods such as palisander and mahogany. All his furniture is handmade in line with traditional, labour-intensive methods from the 19th century. His pieces are noted for their elegance, above all for the soft curves in the arms of his chairs and sofas, demonstrating his traditional approach aiming to combine style and comfort. In 1942, Henningsen distanced himself from the younger designers of the day who increasingly used straight lines in their work, believing furniture design needed to maintain curvature which contributed to a homely look."

He played the clarinet and fiddle and composed many of the tunes that are now the stock of Danish traditional music, such as his famous version of \"trædballehus polka\" (which he probably adapted from other local fiddlers). At Trædballehus he performed with his musical partner the fiddler Jens Andersen, and the duo achieved national fame, with the Danish National Radio even transmitting live from some of their dances."

  "text" : "Fannie Sperry Steele (1887–1983), born Fannie Sperry, was an award-winning bronc rider and rodeo performer from Montana, one of the first women inducted into the Rodeo Hall of Fame, and the first Montana native in the National Cowgirl Hall of Fame. Born Fannie Sperry to Rachel and Datus Sperry, Fannie was a first-generation Montanan. She was taught to ride by the time she could walk by her mother Rachel, since her father was prevented from riding by an old injury. The only woman rider of the time to ride her entire career without tying her stirrups under the horse’s belly (a practice rodeo judges allowed for women only), Sperry Steele inherited her love of horses, especially Pintos, from her mother Rachel. She won several awards for her riding in professional rodeos during her lifetime, including Women's Bucking Horse Champion of Montana in 1904 at the age of 17, and Lady Bucking Horse Champion of the World of the first Calgary Stampede rodeo in 1912, where hundreds of cowboys from Western Canada, the United States and Mexico competed for thousands of dollars in prizes. In the Calgary Stampede, Sperry Steele had ridden the horse Red Wing, a wild bronc who had trampled fellow rider Joe LaMar to death only days earlier. She married Bill Steele, a fellow rodeo rider and arena clown, on April 30, 1913, and together they began operating their own Wild West show. Besides her horsemanship, Sperry Steele was also skilled with a rifle. During their shows, she would often shoot cigars out of her husband's mouth. Sperry Steele competed for the last time in 1925 at Bozeman, and continued riding exhibition into her 50s. She did not completely retire from riding until 1974, at the age of 87, when she entered a rest home in Helena, Montana."

His elder brother was Melchior von Hatzfeldt, Imperial field marshal. His father had been raised a Protestant, but converted to Roman Catholicism. In 1615, he became a canon of Würzburg Cathedral and, two years later, of Bamberg Cathedral. At age thirty, he became head cantor of Bamberg Cathedral, and the next year, became diocesan administrator of Würzburg. He then served as provost of the Gangolfskirche in Bamberg. The cathedral chapter of Würzburg Cathedral elected him Prince-Bishop of Würzburg on 7 August 1631, with Pope Urban VIII confirming his appointment on 3 January 1632. With the Thirty Years' War raging, Swedish troops occupied the Prince-Bishopric of Bamberg and Franz von Hatzfeld fled to Cologne as a protective measure. On 20 June 1633 Lord High Chancellor of Sweden Axel Oxenstierna declared that the Prince-Bishopric of Bamberg and the Prince-Bishopric of Würzburg would henceforth be combined as the \"Duchy of Franconia\" and enfeoffed to Bernard of Saxe-Weimar. On 4 August 1633 the cathedral chapter of Bamberg Cathedral (which had escaped to the Duchy of Carinthia) elected Franz von Hatzfeld Prince-Bishop of Bamberg, with Pope Urban VIII confirming this appointment on 31 October 1633. This created a personal union between the Prince-Bishopric of Würzburg and the Prince-Bishopric of Bamberg. Following the Battle of Nördlingen of 5–6 September 1634, Franz von Hatzfeld ended his Cologne exile, returning to Würzburg in November 1634, accompanied by the troops of Philipp von Mansfeld. He died of a stroke in Würzburg on 30 July 1642."

  "text" : "Friedrich I, Count of Zollern (nicknamed Maute; died: before 1125), was often cited as a powerful Swabian Count and supporter of the imperial party of Henry V, Holy Roman Emperor. He most likely was the son of Burkhard I, and was married to Udilhild (or Udahild) of the House of Urach (died: 11. April, 1134), which house later became the Fürstenberg family. They had nine children; his eldest son was Friedrich II. A younger son was Burkhard, who founded the Zollern-Hohenberg line (which became extinct in 1486). Friedrich I was the first reeve of the Swabian Alpirsbach Abbey, which had been founded by Adalbert of Zollern (from the short-lived Zollern-Haigerloch line) and other lords. The Zollern (later: Hohenzollern) dynasty based their rise to power on their loyalty to the ruling royal or imperial family. Friedrich I served the Holy Roman Emperor Henry V, and was sent on a diplomatic mission to France. He also accompanied Henry V on his Italian expedition in 1110 and again in 1111, where Henry V intended to claim the imperial crown in Rome. He is also mentioned as an advisor to Henry V in both 1111 and 1114, both times while the imperial party was in Strasbourg."

In October 1864, at the behest of Carl Reinecke, he became First Horn in the Gewandhausorchester Leipzig, a position he held until 1899. He was a founder member of the Gewandhaus-Bläserquintett, formed in 1896. Gumpert was Professor of Horn at the Leipzig Conservatory from 1882 until his death. As well as Heinrich Lorbeer, his pupils included Anton Horner, Max Hess and Max Pottag, all three highly influential in the development of horn playing in the United States. His publications (all of which appear, erroneously, under the name \"Gumbert\") include twelve volumes of orchestral excerpt books (Orchesterstudien) arranged for horn and other wind instruments, a horn method, and many arrangements for horn and piano."

  "text" : "Nicolay Fritz Reichwein Huitfeldt (19 May 1851 – 24 April 1938) was a Norwegian sports official, writer and producer of skis and ski bindings. He was born in Borgund as a son of stipendiary magistrate Hans Jørgen Hansen Huitfeldt (1806–1857) and Fredrikke Ambjørnsen (1815–1897). The family also lived in Fredrikstad during Fritz' childhood, but when he was 13 years old the family moved to Christiania. He was a distant descendant of Tønne Huitfeldt. He was married twice; first between 1894 and 1900 to singer Marie Gløersen, then from September 1906 to Asta Marie Andersen (1877–1966). Through his sister, Fritz Huitfeldt was a brother-in-law of his own cousin Henrik Jørgen Huitfeldt-Kaas. He took the examen artium in 1870 and the \"second examen\" in 1872. Until 1880 he ran two sports stores, first in Drammen and later in Skien. He was then hired in a weapons store in Kristiania. He started his own sports store in the city in 1891, but was employed in another store between 1896 and 1915. He also ran a ski factory named Ull. He became famous all over the skiing world for his \"Huitfeldt ski bindings\", pioneered in 1894 with significant improvements in 1897 and 1904. His bindings and skis were used by ski jumpers, cross-country skiers and alpine skiers alike. Huitfeldt released several books about skiing, hunting and angling, and was an avid skier. He was a member of SK Ull from its founding year, served as its first deputy chairman (from 1883 to 1885) and its third chairman (from 1887 to 1891). He especially promoted the Telemark style of skiing, but was also involved in ski jumping. From 1886 to 1893 he was employed as a secretary in the Association for the Promotion of Skiing. Together with Hans Krag he was responsible for discontinuing the Husebyrennet and creating the hill Holmenkollbakken which arranged the Holmenkollen Ski Festival from 1892. He died in April 1938 in Oslo. A monument to him was unveiled near Tryvannstårnet in 1946."

  "text" : "Frederick Timpson I'Ons (15 November 1802 Islington - 18 December 1887 Grahamstown) was an English-born South African painter, one of the eight children of John I'Ons, who was master of a riding school in Islington. I'Ons showed an early aptitude for drawing, was influenced by, and became a friend of the sculptor John Francis and his daughter Mary, who married another sculptor, Thomas Thornycroft. He later ran an art school in Marylebone where he taught drawing, painting, and commercial subjects. On 31 May 1827 Frederick I'Ons married Ann Frazer, whose ill-health led in 1834 to the young couple's emigrating to the Albany district of Grahamstown. They arrived at the start of the Sixth Frontier War, prompting Frederick to volunteer his services. This date marks the first of his 'Aquila Caricatures', a series of informative though jocularly offensive barbs directed at Andries Stockenström, the lieutenant governor of British Kaffraria at the time. The patrons of I'Ons were largely military types who commissioned portraits of the local Xhosa chiefs, such as Sandile and Khama. I'Ons was outstanding in depicting the Bantu and Hottentot passers-by. The images of these 'native characters' are regarded as his most important works, reflecting a great deal of sensitivity and skill in their portrayal, and likened to those of Adriaen van Ostade. As is often the case with artists who have to produce potboilers to survive, their best work is neglected in the interests of financial exigencies. Except for his short association with John Francis, I'Ons had no formal training in art. Still, his landscapes of the Eastern Cape have the charm usually encountered in naïve art with woodland scenes reminiscent of Watteau. Even so, his landscapes are sometimes criticised as being gloomy and uninspired. He eked out his income by painting stage decor, portraits of notable Grahamstown residents and giving art classes. A trip to the diamond diggings at Kimberley did not improve his fortunes. His works provide an important insight into frontier life in the 1800s, and have been exhibited by the Tate Gallery in London (1948), the South African National Gallery in Cape Town (1976), and King George VI Gallery in Port Elizabeth (1990). His paintings may be found in private and corporate ownership, and at museums and galleries like the Africana Museum, Albany Museum, Fort Beaufort Historical Museum, King George VI Art Gallery, South African National Gallery, the University of Stellenbosch, the William Fehr Collection, William Humphreys Art Gallery and the 1820 Settlers Memorial Museum."

He worked for the French royal court amongst a group of artists now called the first school of Fontainebleau. Francesco arrived at the building of Fontainebleau for Francis I of France at the same time as his compatriot, Rosso Fiorentino in 1530. There he completed the panelling of the Gallerie François Ier. One of his contracts for the renewed furnishing in oak and walnut of the great gallery and pavilion near the lake at Fontainebleau was made according to the king's personal instructions in February 1541. He also worked at the Château d'Anet for Diane de Poitiers. In 1549 he was contracted to decorate boats for a pageant on the Seine for the entry of Henry II of France to Paris. Francesco also made furniture and panelling for private and ecclesiastical clients. In July 1552 he accepted as apprentice Bartholomew, the son of another Italian painter colleague at Fontainebleau, Francesco Pellegrini. In the two years from 1557 to 1559 he made furniture for the Louvre, for the Château and the Chapel in the woods of Vincennes, and for the Château of Saint Germain-en-Laye. For Fontainebleau, he made a special picture frame for a map of Italy and other carved frames for the portraits of two ladies. In March 1537, he married Marguerite Samson, daughter of a French painter, Pierre Samson."

He had planned to establish himself as a researcher when Prime Minister Adolfo Suárez asked him to convert an old Francoist organization (the Instituto de Estudios Políticos) into a modern think-tank that would help Spain achieve its transition to Democracy. The organization was renamed and Prieto became its first director. Upon leaving the directorship, Prieto returned to the academic world. He became especially well known for his studies of Seneca and Hegel. He was the president of the \"Coordinadora Estatal para la Reforma de la Ley Electoral\" (CERLE), an organization devoted to promoting participatory democracy and increasing citizen involvement in the legislative process."

  "text" : "Francesco Flarer (27 November 1791 – 22 December 1859) was an Italian ophthalmologist born near Merano, South Tyrol. He initially planned to study theology at Innsbruck, but instead enrolled to take classes in medicine, later relocating to the University of Landshut. Political turmoil made his stays at both institutions brief, and in 1809 transferred to the University of Pavia. In 1815 he received his degree in medicine, followed by a doctorate in surgery shortly afterwards. On advice from Antonio Scarpa (1752–1832), he studied ophthalmology in the clinic of Georg Joseph Beer (1763–1821) at the University of Vienna, where he obtained a degree in 1817. Following his return to Pavia, he worked as an assistant in the anatomy laboratory of Bartolomeo Panizza (1785–1867). In 1819 Flarer was appointed professor of theoretical and practical ophthalmology at Pavia. In 1832–33 he was named university rector, and in 1854 was appointed dean of the medical faculty. Among his written works was a treatise on iritis (De iritide eiusque speciebus earumque curatione) that won an award from the Académie Royale de Médecine of Paris in 1836. Another noted work of his was a study of eyelid/eyelash maladies titled Riflessioni sulla Trichiasi, sulla Distichiasi e sull'Entropio, avuto particolare riguardo ai metodi di Jaeger e di Vaccà (Reflections on trichiasis, distichiasis and entropion, with particular regard to the methods of Friedrich Jäger von Jaxtthal (1784–1871) and Andrea Vaccá Berlinghieri (1772–1826). Flarer was editor of the medical journal Gazzetta medica di Lombardia."

  "text" : "Frederick of Nassau-Weilburg (born 26 April 1640 in Metz; died: 8 September 1675) was the ruling Count of Nassau-Weilburg from 1655 to 1675. He was the son of Ernest Casimir (1607–1655) and his wife Anna Maria of Sayn-Wittgenstein-Hachenburg (1610–1656). His parents fled to Metz during the Thirty Years' War. Frederick was born in Metz and spent his early years there. After the end of the war, the family returned to a devastated country. Frederick inherited Nassau-Weilburg in 1655. As he was still a minor at the time, his uncle John acted as regent. When he married in 1663, he was declared an adult and took up government himself. In 1672, the Franco-Dutch war broke out. Nassau-Weilburg remained neutral, but suffered nevertheless from troops passing through. Frederick died in 1675 of a riding accident. Count John Louis acted as regent for Frederick's children, who were still minors."

  "text" : "Sir Francis Ashley (24 November 1569 – 1635) was an English lawyer and politician who sat in the House of Commons at various times between 1614 and 1625. Ashley was born at Damerham, the son of Sir Anthony Ashley of Damerham in Wiltshire and his wife Dorothy Lyte, daughter of John Lyte of Lytes Cary, Somerset. At the age of 16 he entered Magdalen College, Oxford, and graduated with BA on 5 June 1589. He went on to study law at the Middle Temple where he was called to the bar in 1596. In 1610 he was appointed recorder of Dorchester. He purchased the Old Friary on the north side of the town by the river Frome where he made extensive alterations and lived there with his family. In 1614, Ashley was elected Member of Parliament for Dorchester. He became reader at the Middle Temple in 1616. In 1617 he became Serjeant-at-law and in the same year granted to Rev. Robert Cheeke, the master of the Free School and Rector of All Saints Church, all his \"tithes of corne, grayne, hay, woole, lambes, oak etc belonging to the free chapel of Pudle Waterston\". Ashley was knighted on 5 July 1618. In 1621 he was re-elected MP for Dorchester but on 13 February 1621 resigned his place in favour of Sir Thomas Edmondes. However Edmondes chose to sit elsewhere and Ashley was chosen again as MP for Dorchester on 9 Mar 1621. He was greatly influenced by the Rev. John White rector of Holy Trinity and St Peters, and with him and others invested in 1624 in the Dorchester Company. Ashley was elected MP for Dorchester again in 1625. In Parliament he strongly supported the royal prerogative and was an active member and chairman of committees However, in his religious views he was sympathetic to the Puritan cause. He became King's Serjeant in 1625 and was very active at Dorchester sitting regularly at the Quarter Sessions from 1625 until his death. He was chosen as the judge for an extraordinary commission set up on 17 January 1627 when he condemned seven soldiers and a tapster to death for burglary although six soldiers were later pardoned. On 22 April 1628, he was imprisoned by the House of Lords for speaking against liberty of the subject, but was released when he recanted and craved pardon. As King's Serjeant, he represented the Crown in various cases including the trial of John Felton, the assassin of the Duke of Buckingham. He suffered an attack of Palsy in London on 7 January 1629 but recovered. In the new charter granted to Dorchester on 22 September 1629, his appointment as recorder was confirmed. On 19 June 1630 he had to defend himself before the star chamber against accusations of a conspiracy against Sir Thomas Coventry Lord Keeper who \"scandalized him by saying he had taken a bribe of six hundred pounds\". Ashley's nephew Anthony Ashley Cooper had been left very extensive estates through the death of his father and grandfather and these were under the control of the Court of Wards. Ashley was among the administrators of the estates and Cooper later accused these administrators of attempting to wrest some of his lands from him while he was still a minor and a Ward of Court. Ashley he singled out as the worst and most avaricious offender who used his legal abilities and influences to obtain his ends through the Ward of Courts. In one of these proceedings on 16 November 1635, Ashley was making a speech before the Court when his nephew uttered a prayer to be delivered from the lawyer's arguments and purposes. At this point Ashley collapsed with a paralytic seizure with \"his mouth drawn to his ear\" and was carried out of the Court and never spoke again. He died 12 days later on 28 November 1635 at the Serjeant's Inn in Fleet Street at the age of 66. His body was brought back to Dorchester and buried in St Peter's church. Ashley married Anne Samways the eldest daughter of Bernard (or Robert) Samways of Toller Fratrum and through her he acquired lands and property at Winterborne St Martin. Their only surviving child was Dorothy who married Denzil Holles on 4 June 1626."

  "text" : "Frank Gibbs Rye (12 August 1874 – 18 October 1948) was a British solicitor and Conservative politician. The third son of Walter Rye, the athlete and antiquary, and Georgina Eliza Rye of Norwich, he was educated at Fauconberg Grammar School, Beccles and St Paul's School, London. He was admitted as a solicitor in 1901, and joined his father's legal firm.

He entered local politics as an alderman on Westminster City Council, and was mayor of the city in 1922–1923. He was appointed by the city council to the Metropolitan Water Board and the Thames Conservancy. At the 1923 general election he was the Conservative Party candidate for the constituency of Loughborough in Leicestershire, but failed to be elected. When another election was held in 1924 he was elected to the House of Commons as Loughborough's member of parliament, with the stting Liberal Party MP, Edward Spears being beaten into third place behind George Winterton of the Labour Party. Rye served only one term in parliament, and was defeated in 1929 when Winterton, his Labour opponent of five years before, won the seat. In 1931 he was chosen by the Conservatives to contest Walsall. In the event the party did not contest the seat, instead supporting the Liberal candidate as the representative of the National Government. In 1937 he was elected to the London County Council as a Municipal Reform Party councillor representing Westminster, Abbey. He remained a member of the county council until his death, and served as deputy chairman in 1946–1947. He was created an OBE in 1937 and CBE in 1945.

He moved to Warsaw in 1905 and began studying at the Society for Educational Courses in 1914. He served as a member of the Polish Land Forces during World War I and through 1920, at which point he began working in a laboratory at the State Epidemic Center in Warsaw. He entered the Academy of Fine Arts in Warsaw in 1923, taking night classes so as not to lose his job. During the period from 1927 until the onset of World War II he exhibited his sculptures across Europe, but he spent the conflict itself as a civilian prisoner of war in work camps. Following the war, in 1946, Strynkiewicz was appointed a professor at the Academy. He died in November 1996, in Warsaw, at the age of 103."

  "text" : "Frane Adam (born 23 November 1948) is a Slovenian sociologist, editor and former dissident political activist. During the early 1970s, he was one of the leaders of the student protest movement in the Socialist Republic of Slovenia. Adam was born in Pivka, Slovenia, then part of Yugoslavia. He studied at the University of Ljubljana, where he became one of the most prominent activists in the Slovenian student movement, which arose as part of the all-European protests of 1968. In 1972, he was arrested by the Communist authorities together with poet Milan Jesih. Their arrest triggered the occupation of the Faculty of Arts in Ljubljana by the students. Adam achieved his PhD in 1981 at the University of Zagreb. He continued his academic career as a fellow researcher at the universities of Konstanz and Bielefeld. In the 1980s, he became, together with Gregor Tomc, one of the first Slovenian and Yugoslav sociologist to study the phenomena of contemporary social movements, with an emphasis of youth subcultures. In the 1980s, he was active in the civil society movement in Slovenia, and became one of the members of the Committee for the Defence of Human Rights. Between 1989-1992, he was the chairman of the Slovenian Sociological Association. He was also a fellow at the Scientific Centre for Social Research in Berlin. He is currently teaching as professor at the School of Advanced Social Studies in Nova Gorica. He also teaches at the Faculty for Social Sciences at the University of Ljubljana. He is also fellow researcher at the Institute for Developmental and Strategic Analysis in Ljubljana. His research interest is focused on comparative studies of elites and democracy, on theories and indicators of developmental performance as well as on the impact of social capital on knowledge transfer and regional innovation systems."

  "text" : "Francis \"Frank\" Joseph Zakem OPEI (August 30, 1931 – January 23, 2013) was a Canadian businessman, politician, educator and author. He was born in Saint-Paul, Quebec in 1931 and moved to Prince Edward Island in 1936 with his family. Zakem received his early education at Queens Square School, Prince of Wales College and Saint Dunstan's University, earning the degrees of Bachelor of Commerce, Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Education. He spent two years at the Grand Seminary of Montreal Theology and completed the Management Development Program for College Administrators at Trent University. As a young man his leadership qualities presented themselves naturally as a young entrepreneur who participated actively in his family business. He has shared his early experiences in several successful books including The Corner Store Experience for which he received a heritage award from the City of Charlottetown, The Zakem Marji Story and The Basilica Recreation Center Before and After. Zakem played an integral part in Island education through his work with Saint Dunstan's University, Prince of Wales College, the University of Prince Edward Island and Holland College, where he served in a variety of capacities, including President at Holland College for 26 years. Zakem served as city councillor for Charlottetown from 1964 to 1974 and 1995 to 1998 and served as mayor from 1975 to 1977. During his tenure as mayor he oversaw the creation of the Charlottetown Area Development Corporation and was instrumental in establishing a series of guidelines for the preservation of heritage in Charlottetown. A notable result of these guidelines is the restoration of Victoria Row, a block of Richmond Street between Queen Street and Great George Street, as well as its development into a seasonal pedestrian mall. For 6 years he was seconded to work in various capacities in the office of Premier Joe Ghiz. In the 1990s, Zakem's expertise was utilized to assist on the issue of municipal reform and, later that decade, he served as Director of the Federation of Prince Edward Island Municipalities. These achievements are paralleled by Zakem’s lengthy community involvement in organizations dealing with mental and physical health, sports, multicultural matters and race relations, the Boy Scouts, and in helping create the Rotary Youth Parliament, an invaluable training ground and venue for many current and future Island leaders. His writings on the political machinations of Prince Edward Island, including his work on municipal representation remain important reference material to current political researchers. In 2009, Zakem was admitted into the Order of Prince Edward Island in recognition of his many contributions to public life in the fields of politics, heritage, writing, education, business and community activity. In 2011, Zakem was recognized and honoured as one of the Founders of the University of Prince Edward Island. In 2012, Zakem was presented with an honorary Doctorate from the University of Prince Edward Island. Zakem died in Charlottetown on January 23, 2013."

Hutchinson graduated from the California Institute of Technology in 1931, and received an M.S. and M.E. from the University of California, Berkeley in 1937. He was a professor of engineering at Berkeley and at Purdue University. At Purdue, he established a solar energy research program in which two experimental solar houses (one with large double glazed windows) were built on the Purdue campus in the summer of 1945. By analyzing this experiment, Hutchinson concluded that the solar gain through the double glazed house was greater than the excess heat loss. This study led to the manufacture of Thermopane  glass in 1946, which is widely used in modern architecture. Hutchinson was the author or co-author of 178 papers & articles and 14 books on industrial topics.He was a member of ASHRAE Hall of Fame."

After a financial disaster during World War I when the brothers were left out of pocket after shipping a quantity of fruit to Germany, they dissolved the partnership and Frederick established new orchards at Berri, successfully dealing in dried fruit from 1920. He stayed out of the Australian Dried Fruits Association in protest at the restrictive sale rules. During this period he also gained extensive familiarity with Australia's Constitution. In 1925 James successfully sold large quantities of his export quota to New Zealand, but his contracts were annulled when he tried to repeat his feat the following year. He successfully had his quota raised, but on the advice of a solicitor sold more than double his quota to brokers in New South Wales and Victoria, resulting in the South Australian Dried Fruits Control Board initiating legal proceedings against him. The High Court ruled in favour of James, as it was often to do, in James v. South Australia (1927). He was also successful in James v. The Commonwealth (1928), but the court ruled against him in James v. Cowan (1930), upholding the state's right to invoke compulsory acquisition; this was reversed by the Privy Council in 1932. James was involved in many significant legal cases in the 1930s and won most of them. Originally a Country Party member, he left when it embraced organized marketing and, after an unsuccessful attempt to gain United Australia Party preselection, ran for the Senate in 1937 on an independent ticket, winning 7.9% of the vote. In 1936 his wife initiated divorce proceedings but James persuaded her to settle out of court. She died in 1949 and he remarried Constance Winifred Timothy-Keighley on 19 April 1950. He died at Toorak Gardens in 1957."

He was admitted to the bar in 1880 and joined his father's firm, Bangs and Stetson. Bangs remained at the firm for fourteen years, when he resigned to become president of the State Trust Company in 1894. He resigned that position four years later and, after a vacation in Europe, joined the investment bank of Kingsley, Mabon & Co. In 1907, he returned to the practice of law at the firm of Gunthrie, Bangs & Van Sinderen. Outside of his professional career, Bangs was a trustee of Columbia College and a member of the vestry of Trinity Church. He was also a member of the Saint Nicholas Society in the City of New York.

Born in Bedfordshire, England, she was the daughter of Lewis Latham, a falconer for King Charles I. She was first married to William Dungan, with whom she had four children. Dungan died at an early age, and she soon married Jeremy Clarke who brought her and her Dungan children to New England where they settled in Portsmouth, Rhode Island. Clarke was a prominent merchant who became the President of the colony for a year. With Clarke, Frances had seven children, the oldest of whom, Walter, later became a governor of the colony. Jeremy Clarke died when all of his children were still minors, after which Frances married her third husband, the Reverend William Vaughan of Newport. Frances and her last husband both died at about the same time in 1677 in Newport, and Frances was buried in the Common Burying Ground there. She leaves a legacy of thousands of descendants, many of whom reached great prominence during their lives."

After the early death of his father Otto (1496–1522), Frederick Magnus I took up the government in his father's part of the County of Solms. He chose Laubach Castle as his permanent residence and gradually converted the castle into a palace. After the third division of Solms in 1548, Solms-Laubach became a separate principality, with Frederick Magnus I as its first ruler. He married Agnes of Wied and had issue: \n*  John George (1547–1600) \n*  Elisabeth of Solms-Laubach (6 March 1549 – 1599), married Louis I, Count of Sayn-Wittgenstein \n*  Anna (11 April 1557 – 8 December 1586), married George III, Count of Erbach-Breuberg In 1540, Laubach became a fortress and a militia was established. This militia has been preserved to this day as the Laubach festival committee. Frederick Magnus I was a friend of the Reformer Philipp Melanchthon. He introduced the Reformation in Solms-Laubach in 1544. He abolished the inheritance tax and issued a simplified court order, which developed into the Civil Code of Solms. In 1555, he founded a Latin School, with teachers from Wittenberg. He also founded the library of Laubach, which now contains over 90000titles from the 16th century to the present. It is a listed monument and was registered under Heritage Protection Act in 1955. Frederick Magnus I died in 1561 and was succeeded by his son John George (1547–1600)."

  "text" : "Frank S. Petersen (June 20, 1922 – May 23, 2011) was a northern California jurist and politician who represented California's 4th State Senate district from 1963 to 1966 and served as a California Superior Court Judge for Del Norte County from 1966 to 1988. Petersen was born June 20, 1922, in a logging camp near Elk, Mendocino County, California, and grew up in nearby Fort Bragg, California. He enlisted in the United States Navy during World War II, after which he received an associate degree from Santa Rosa Junior College in 1948 and a J.D. from the University of San Francisco in 1951. After working in a private practice and the county district attorney's office, he became the district attorney for Mendocino County in 1960. During his term as D.A., he became embroiled in a controversy called the \"War of the Warrants\" that began with a domestic abuse case, led to the issuance of 57 arrest warrants, and ended with the conviction of four people, two of them sitting judges, for obstruction of justice. In 1962, Petersen ran for office as a California State Senator for California's 4th State Senate district, which at that time covered both Mendocino and Lake Counties. Despite the attempts of the judges in the War of the Warrants to embarrass him during his campaign, he won election and served until 1966. He succeeded Waverly Jack Slattery as state senator, and in turn was succeeded by John F. McCarthy. His actions as state senator included the opening of Hendy Woods State Park, an old-growth coast redwood forest in Mendocino County. Petersen's chances of remaining in the senate were damaged in the 1965 redistricting process, and in June 1966, governor Pat Brown appointed Petersen as judge for the Superior Court for Del Norte County, succeeding Michael H. Messner in that position. Among the cases he heard was one in which the Pacific Lumber Company was sued for its clear cutting of old-growth redwoods.In 1988, Petersen retired as a judge and soon after returned to private practice. However, he was recalled to the bench in 1993. He returned to Fort Bragg in his retirement, and died there on May 23, 2011."

  "text" : "Ferdinand Gagnon (8 June 1849 – 15 April 1886) was a Canadian born American journalist. Gagnon was born and educated in Saint-Hyacinthe, Canada East. At age 19, he joined a substantial group of French Canadians who were leaving the now province of Quebec for the newly forming New England states to escape the British rule. He began his American residency at Manchester, N.H. Gagnon envisaged a national union of the French Canadians in Canada and those in the United States.He saw this union as something that would happen sooner or later and worked toward that goal. He put forth a concerted effort for a period of time toward repatriation of Franco-Americans to Quebec. This effort was largely unsuccessful. His vocation was publishing and journalism and he was involved in a number of publications starting with La Voix du peuple. This publication ceased and was replaced by L’Idée nouvelle. In 1869 Gagnon married and settled in Worcester, Mass. where he started the L’Étendard national. Gagnon continued to support his view of the French Canadian émigrés which was not always popular with the émigrés themselves. His early death at age 36 ended his involvement of this diverse cause. There is a statue of Gagnon in Lafayette Park in the city of Manchester, New Hampshire."

  "text" : "Dr. Frederick Winsor (October 2, 1829 – February 25, 1889) was a Civil War surgeon, head of the Massachusetts State Hospital and longtime physician in Salem, Massachusetts. Born in Boston, Massachusetts on October 2, 1829, Winsor was the youngest of 12 children of Thomas Winsor (who died when Frederick was two) and Welthea Sprague, one of 15 children of Seth Sprague of Duxbury, Massachusetts, a famous Methodist anti-slavery leader. Winsor attended Boston Latin School, and graduated Harvard University in 1851. He was known as a great athlete at Harvard, despite serious eye problems that forced him to leave school in his senior year and have his lessons read to him in order to graduate. He then attended Harvard Medical School, graduating in 1855. That same year he began his long practice as a physician in Salem, Massachusetts. Winsor married Ann Bent Ware, daughter of Unitarian minister, professor, and abolitionist Henry Ware, Jr. and Mary Lovell Pickard, on August 10, 1857 in Milton, Massachusetts. In 1861, Massachusetts Governor John Albion Andrew appointed Winsor head of the State Hospital at Rainsford Island. A year later he left his post to enlist as a surgeon in the 49th Massachusetts regiment, serving from 1862 to 1863 through the disastrous Louisiana Campaign under the command of Colonel (later General) William Francis Bartlett. During a disastrous frontal assault on Port Hudson, Louisiana on May 27, 1863, Bartlett was shot twice—once in his remaining unamputated leg and once in his wrist, shattering it. Dr. Winsor worked through the night to remove the bullet from Col. Bartlett's wrist, saving his hand. He would write a gripping account of that night years later for Atlantic Monthly: His clear blue eye met mine steadily, his strong right hand grasped mine firmly, and the voice that could ring along the line like a trumpet had no waver in it as it said, “How are you, doctor? We’ve had a tough time of it. Now you must do your best for me. I can’t lose another limb, you know.” I saw that the hurt in the head could be nothing serious; a buckshot had scored the scalp to the bone, and another had done the same for the heel of his one foot. I undid the bandage that bound his left wrist, and examined it. A ball had entered on one side, and lay near the surface on the other. His eyes questioned me, and I replied, “I can soon take that ball out, when you are under ether. That’s a very tender place.” “But you won’t take off the hand?” “I will do nothing without letting you know and having your consent, Colonel.” So he drank of oblivion and ceased to suffer, but his dream was not of home. “Doctor,” he muttered (talking in the ether sleep), “that’s my bridle hand, you know. Never can ride at the head of my regiment again if you take that off.” In a moment I held the bullet in my hand, and saw with joy that it was round and rather small, giving reason to hope that it had not shattered the bones badly in coming through, which could hardly have been the case had it been conical. No loose bone was to be felt, and I had the great pleasure of telling him, as he returned to consciousness, that there was good reason to hope that his “bridle hand” would by and by hold the rein again. A smile of satisfaction and relief lit up the face which had till then been set in the resolve to bear the worst, and with the simple, hearty thanks which we surgeons had from the hundreds of men that night he was borne off to his blanket side by side with his officers. Although Winsor returned to private practice in Winchester, Massachusetts after his service, he continued to contribute to the State Board of Health, writing important state health reports such as \"The Hygiene of School Houses\" (1874), and \"Water Supply, Drainage, and Sewerage from the Sanitary Point of View\" (1876). He also founded the Unitarian Church of Winchester in 1865. Winsor died in Hamilton, Bermuda on February 25, 1889. Frederick and Ann Winsor's children were: Robert Winsor, born 1858, leadining partner of Kidder, Peabody & Co. from 1919 until his death in 1930; Mary P. Winsor, born 1860, founder and longtime director of the Winsor School for Girls; Paul Winsor, born 1863, engineer, inventor, and vice president of the Boston Elevated Railway, Annie W. (Winsor) Allen, born 1865, founder and director of Roger Ascham School in Scarsdale, New York, Jane L. (Winsor) Gale, born 1868, founder and manager of Boston's Toy Theater; Elizabeth W. (Winsor) Pearson, co-founder of the Nursery Training School (now the Eliot-Pearson School at Tufts University); and Frederick Winsor, Jr., founder and longtime director of Middlesex School."

He was educated at Aquinas College in Salter Point, where he was mentored in football by Jerry Dolan. He was also playing club football for South Perth under East Perth great Mick Cronin. Walker trained with East Perth in 1951, even attending a trip to Collie with them and playing a scratch match against South Fremantle. He was living with his grandparents in South Perth, whilst his father was living in Cannington. South Perth was within the recruiting boundary of Perth, whilst Cannington was unallocated, East Perth tried to sign him up as living with his father, they sent the request off amongst other paperwork, hoping the address anomaly would go unnoticed. Mistakenly sent early, Perth officials obtained it. Jack O'Dea of Perth signed Walker just before the start of the 1952 season. He played two games in the seconds before making his debut against West Perth. He won the best and fairest for Perth in 1955 and 1956, runner-up in his last full season in 1963. He topped the clubs goal kicking in 1953, his record of 410 goals one of the highest on Perth's all-time goalkickers list. He made his debut for Western Australia against Victoria at the MCG in 1955, kicking two of their three goals for the game. He represented Western Australia ten times. In 1961, he was assistant coach to Bob Miller. Miller was sacked early in the season, Walker was elevated to the coaching position, but on the insistence of the club, he was a non-playing coach, meaning Walker did not play until 1962, when he was made assistant to Ern Henfry. In 1964, Walker retired after 226 games. He was nicknamed \"Dickie\" because his father and grandfather were also named Frank."

  "text" : "Friedrich Ludwig of Hohenzollern-Hechingen (1 September 1688 in Strasbourg – 4 June 1750 at Lindich Castle in Hechingen) was prince of Hohenzollern-Hechingen. Friedrich Ludwig was a son of Prince Friedrich Wilhelm of Hohenzollern-Hechingen (1663–1735), and his wife Countess Maria Ludovica Leopoldine of Sinzendorf (1666–1709). His childhood and youth were spent in his parents' Renaissance castle in Hechingen. After his military training, Friedrich Ludwig became a passionate hunter and soldier. He was an imperial Field Marshal and Commander-in-Chief of the Austrian army on the Upper Rhine. He fought under Prince Eugene of Savoy in the Austro-Turkish War of 1716–1718 and against Hungarian rebels. In 1730, his father abdicated as Prince of Hohenzollern-Hechingen and Friedrich Ludwig took over. His passion for hunting led him to construct a Jagdschloss and summer residence, despite the principality's awkward financial situation. The architecturally outstanding Lindich Castle was constructed between 1739 and 1741, three kilometers west of Hechingen. He also built Jagdschloss Friedrichstal, southeast of Boll (now a suburb of Hechingen). These construction projects worsened the principality's financial problems and led to confrontations with his subjects. Friedrich Ludwig died at Lindich Castle on 4 June 1750. He was unmarried and childless. His successor was his cousin Josef Friedrich Wilhelm."

  "text" : "Frank Alvord Perret (1867 in Philadelphia – January 12, 1943 in New York) was an American entrepreneur, inventor, and volcanologist, which drew attention particularly with his research on the Vesuvius, the Kilauea and the Mount Pelée to itself. He studied physics at Polytechnic Institute of New York University and then received an appointment in the laboratories of Thomas Edison in the Lower East Side, where he worked on the development of engines and participated in the development of dynamos. In 1886 he founded the Elektron Manufacturing Company, together with John A. Barrett, a small company that designed and produced electronic devices. His partner left the project but again very quickly in order to pursue the development of its patented battery. Frank A. Perret became involved in the development of the theory of EMF (s:.Counter-electromotive force, CEMF). He drew the necessary energy from motors DC and invented the electric motor-Perret. In 1889, Perret committed Elihu H. Cutler who should care for the expansion of the company and soon exceeded the demand, production capacity, leading to a new factory in Springfield in Massachusetts. By 1900, Perret went to Italy to improve his health where he met the director of government laboratories in the volcanological observatory on Mount Vesuvius, RV Matteucci. It is going assume that this man introduced him in the volcanology and he began to be interested in this. The elevator production system was acquired in 1906 by the Otis Elevator Company. Due to ongoing health problems, he left his company in 1904. In 1906, he also observed together with Matteucci an eruption of the Vesuvius, to whose study he devoted himself until 1921. In a 1950 obituary published Mildred Giblin attested Perret that his monograph on the Vesuvius was \"the clearest and most comprehensive report ever on a volcanic eruption and its aftermath published\". By the end of the first decade of the 20th century Perret also toured the Kilauea, the Stromboli, the Etna, the Mount Teide and the Sakurajima. In 1909 he decided that the geophysicists Thomas A. Jagar from Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Reginald A. Daly of the Harvard University established a permanent monitoring station at Kilauea. This plan was implemented in 1911 on the edge of the crater Halemaumau. The station was the forerunner of the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory built in the following year January 1912 and Perret began his research at Kilauea. When Mount Pelée on the French Caribbean island of Martinique became active again, years after the devastating outbreak 1929-27 with an estimated 40,000 dead, Perret was one of the first scientists on site. In the three years of volcanic activity until 1932 he conducted numerous investigations and in 1931 he built on the Morne Lenard above the valley of the Riviere Blanche a small observation hut as the first permanent station on the mountain. Perret stayed more or less continuously a total of about ten years on the island. Today, the Musée Frank A. Perret volcanological museum bears his name to honor him. 1940 Frank A. Perret went back to the United States and wrote several books which he mostly could not publish, but write for the most part. He died at the age of 76. The scientific contributions of Mr. Perret there are unique in that no other volcanologist the time and it was possible for such a large and varied observations on so many types of active volcanoes perform. He was a daring and astute researcher, tireless in their quest for information. He was a skilled and demanding photographer and his publications are generously illustrated with excellent, scenic shots.— Frank A. Perret"

In 2005 and 2010 she was a candidate for Afghanistan's Wolesi Jirga, the lower house of its national legislature.Ten seats were set aside for the nomadic Kuchis. Three of those seats were set aside for women. Six other Kuchi women competed for those seats. In September 2005, The Telegraph described how Parween Durani, another candidate, complained to voters that Fareeda had an offensive body odour.The Telegraph described Fareeda turning this insult into an advantage, reminding them that, like all traditional Kuchis, her family's sole heating and cooking fuel was animal dung In 2010 she stood sixth among the female candidates, winning 147 votes.Hamida Ahmadzai won 4078 votes,Helay Irshad won 1774 votes,Parween Duran won 1201 votes.

Soon afterwards his wife, Kate, and their two daughters, Harriette and Olive, joined him at his farm 'Utopia' near Paparoa, on an inlet of the Kaipara Harbour. Radcliffe's interest in photography grew and he quickly acquired a reputation as an exceptional scenic photographer. For twenty years he traveled the country taking photographs of small rural towns, large cities, rivers, gardens, buildings, beaches, wharves, forests, lakes and streets. From 1909, with the help of Kate and Olive, he operated a successful postcard business from his home in Whangarei. Radcliffe played the oboe, conducted local orchestras and was an active member of various music-related clubs in his community. He died at Onerahi, Whangarei, in 1923.

Because his father’s marriage to his mother was morganatic, Frederick was not counted as a member of the House of Hohenzollern. After the death of his mother, Frederick was, together with his older brother William, heir to the Schloss Albrechtsberg in Dresden, which he occupied until his death. In 1901, together with Friedrich Botho, a brother of Philip, Prince of Eulenburg, he had to leave the Prussian military service because of his homosexual inclinations. Frederick was also involved in the two biggest scandals of the German Empire under Kaiser Wilhelm II. He belonged to the Liebenberg Round Table and played a role alongside his wife in the so-called Kotze Affair."

  "text" : "Frederick Knab was an artist and entomologist active from the 1880s through the 1918, most noted for his oil paintings and illustrations and his work with coleopterous and dipterous insects. Knab was born September 22, 1865, in Würzburg, Bavaria and came to the United States as a boy of eight with his parents, Oscar and Josephine Knab, who settled in Chicopee, Massachusetts in 1873. His father was an engraver and painter and an uncle was court painter to the King of Bavaria. In his youth, Knab showed artistic talent and a strong interest in the natural sciences, especially entomology. He studied the classic works of Charles Darwin, Alfred Russel Wallace, and Henry Walter Bates and accumulated a large collection of insects, particularly beetles (Order Coleoptera), and became an active member of the Springfield (Massachusetts) Zoological Club and an active correspondent with other coleopterists. In 1885, Knab undertook a sixteen month collecting trip up the Amazon River, traveling from its mouth to Peru. He kept a journal of his expedition, which formed an important source of experience for his later scientific career. In 1889, he went to Europe and studied art for two years at the Munich Academy, and then established a studio in Chicopee with the intention of making landscape painting his profession. In 1903 the Carnegie Institution of Washington provided a grant to United States Department of Agriculture entomologist Leland Ossian Howard to develop a monograph of the mosquitoes of North and Central America and the West Indies. In organizing the work Howard sought the advice of entomologist George Dimmock of Springfield as to the best observer known to him who could undertake the study of the biology of the mosquitoes of the New England region, and Dimmock nominated Knab. Knab's work produced important notes and a report illustrated by drawings which were so excellent that State Entomologist of Illinois W. T. M. Forbes subsequently hired Knab as a scientific illustrator, giving his abilities wider exposure. In 1906 Knab accepted a position with the Bureau of Entomology of the United States Department of Agriculture in Washington, D.C., and became co-author of the Carnegie Institution-sponsored monograph on mosquitoes in collaboration with Leland Ossian Howard and Harrison Gray Dyar, Jr. He became an active member of the Biological Society of Washington, served as Vice-President of the Entomological Society of Washington, and was a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science and the Entomological Society of America. He began working on a Doctor of Philosophy degree at George Washington University, but the final stages of his illness prevented him from completing the requirements before his death. Knab died in Washington, D.C. on November 2, 1918, after a long and painful battle with Chagas' disease contracted during his expedition to Brazil in 1885–1886, which he himself diagnosed through study of the South American medical literature. A bibliography of his published works was provided as an addendum to a memorial authored by three of his closest colleagues, Andrew Nelson Caudell, August Busck, and Leland Ossian Howard published in 1919."

After teaching for several years he began moving westward in 1852 before eventually settling in what was then called Flathead county (today's Ravalli and Missoula Counties in Washington Territory where he was paid to drive supplies for trade with the native populations. Woody accompanied Christopher P. Higgins and Frank Worden in the establishment of Hellgate Village and later Missoula, Montana. In 1866 Woody was appointed to serve as Clerk and Recorder of Missoula County and also acted as Probate Judge as well as post master and finally Deputy Clerk of the Second Judicial District Court of Missoula. He became Missoula's first attorney in 1877 after passing the Montana Bar and on April 19, 1883 he became Missoula's first mayor. He would serve in this capacity until May 22, 1884. Woody was elected to the office of District Judge after receiving the Democratic Nomination in 1892. He would be re-elected in 1896. Woody was also the chairman of the University Committee in charge of lobbying the Montana State Legislature for allowing Missoula to be the location of the University of Montana. It is said that a considerable amount of money was spent on whiskey and three different types of cigars by the 25 lobbyists in their efforts."

  "text" : "Fadhila Mubarak (Arabic: فضيلة مبارك‎‎) is a Bahraini democracy activist. On 18 May 2011, she became the first female activist to be convicted for a role in the Bahraini uprising, and was named a prisoner of conscience by Amnesty International. On 27 March 2011, Mubarak was driving with her 8-year-old son and her 14- and 15-year-old nieces in the car when she was stopped near Riffa (southwest of Manama) by a police checkpoint. A police officer told her that she was \"playing music calling for the overthrow of the regime\", and asked her to turn down the volume. Mubarak refused, instead asking the officer for his identification. According to the police officers at the scene, Mubarak then stepped from her vehicle, grabbed the shirt of an officer, and shoved him. Mubarak, in contrast, alleges that after being insulted and cursed by security officers, a man in civilian clothing tried to force her into a car; not knowing that he was a security officer, she resisted and was struck in the head by the officer. Mubarak was then taken to a police station in Rifaa. She later stated that she was beaten by policewomen while in custody there, before being transferred to a police station in Isa Town, where she was beaten again. After authorities discovered that she had participated in the March protests at Pearl Roundabout, as well as a poem she had written about revolution and freedom for her son, she was charged with \"assault on a public officer\", \"incitement for hatred of the regime\", \"participation in a rally with the intent to commit crimes\", and \"undermining public order\" by Bahrain's National Safety Court of First Instance, a military court. On 18 May 2011, she was sentenced to four years' imprisonment. Amnesty International reported that she was denied a lawyer both before and during her trial, meeting her lawyer for the first time one week after receiving her sentence. On 8 June 2011, her sentence was reduced by an appeals court to eighteen months' imprisonment. This sentence was upheld by a court of cassation on 30 January 2012. Mubarak's family expressed concern for her health, as she was receiving treatment for ovarian cysts shortly before her imprisonment. The Bahrain Centre for Human Rights described Mubarak's imprisonment as \"illegal detention for merely exercising [her] rights to freedom of expression in accordance to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Article 19\", and called for her immediate release. On 30 January 2012, Amnesty International named her a prisoner of conscience, \"sentenced in an unfair trial before a military court on spurious charges for standing up for her rights\"; the organization also called for her release. Although her sentence was upheld by a Bahraini court in late January 2012, Mubarak was released on 6 February 2012. At a rally in al-Muqsha organized by the Bahraini opposition, she was welcomed by thousands of supporters waving national flags while revolutionary music played in the background. Mubarak reported difficulties following her release, including 800 dinars in unpaid car loans and a lawsuit from her employer for \"unauthorized absence\". Unable to find work, she currently lives partly on donations from sympathizers."

He had previously competed in grasstrack racing, and his early speedway experience was gained with the Amateur Riders' Club in Dagenham in 1936, where he also worked in the Ford factory. He signed for Nottingham in 1937, returning to Hackney Wick as a rider later that year. He was captain of Hackney's team in the second division in 1938 and 1939, before his career was interrupted by World War II, in which he served in the Royal Air Force. In 1946 he rode for Middlesbrough Bears, whom he also captained, his brother Jack also a member of the team. A fractured spine at the start of the season kept him out of speedway for two months, but he returned later in the season, winning a round of the British Riders' Championship, and leading his team to the Northern League title. He later moved on to Newcastle Diamonds and then in 1950 to Glasgow Tigers, missing the start of the 1952 season after falling from a ladder and breaking a rib. Hodgson's son Russ and grandson Russell \"Rusty\" Hodgson both followed him into careers in speedway."

Hofmann was deeply involved in Auckland’s cultural scene: friends with artist Dennis Knight Turner, writer Frank Sargeson, violinist Maurice Clare, and architect Vernon Brown. Hofmann’s first solo show didn’t come until 1959, an exhibition at the Photographic Society of New Zealand’s Tauranga convention. There was a revival of interest in Hofmann and his work in the late 1980s as a retro icon of New Zealand modernist taste, and a 1987 retrospective was mounted at Auckland’s Aberhart North Gallery. In 1989 his work featured in a nationally touring show mounted by what was then the National Art Gallery, Object & Style: Photographs from Four Decades 1930s–1960s, and again in 1992 in the Auckland Art Gallery’sThe 1950s Show."

  "text" : "Francis Dart Fenton (c.1825 – 23 April 1898) was a New Zealand magistrate, judge, public administrator and musician. Fenton was born in Huddersfield, Yorkshire, England ca 1825. He went to Auckland, New Zealand, in 1850, and cultivated land on the Waikato River. In 1851 he was appointed by Sir George Grey (then Governor) to a position in the Deeds Office at Auckland, and subsequently became Resident Magistrate and Collector of Customs at Kaipara. In March 1856 he was made Native Secretary by Governor Browne; but his policy clashing with that of (afterwards Sir) Donald McLean, Chief Native Land Commissioner, he was compelled to resign, and was appointed Resident Magistrate at Whaingaroa (now Raglan). On 9 May 1857, as the result of a paper of suggestions which he had addressed to the Governor, he was summoned to act as magistrate at Waikato at a critical time in the difficulties preceding the Waikato war. His appointment, \"at the earnest request of the natives,\" was the promise of a new departure on the part of the Government, who had resolved that the Maori should be governed by laws \"enacted with their own consent,\" and instructed Fenton to prepare a code upon this understanding. Fenton proceeded to Waikato, but on 14 July 1857, Potatau accepted the kingship offered him by the malcontent tribes, and he was shortly afterwards withdrawn. From 1858 to 1864 Fenton acted as assistant law officer of the Crown. In 1861 he prepared the Domain Act, and in 1863 was charged with the working of the New Zealand Settlement Act. Fenton was admitted as a barrister and solicitor in New Zealand in January 1857. In 1865 Fenton was employed to draw up the Native Lands Act, and became Chief Judge of the Native Land Court, a post which he held for seventeen years. He was appointed to the New Zealand Legislative Council on 2 June 1869 and was disqualified (as chief judge of the Native Land Court) on 30 December 1870, and introduced a bill to amend the Native Lands Act, which was passed, but he failed to pass the Native Reserves Bill. He assisted in the successful opposition to the importation of Ghoorka regiments for the purposes of the war, but was ultimately disqualified as an official from sitting in the Council. He was for two years district judge of Auckland, in addition to his other appointments, and retired from public service in 1882. Fenton was singularly well acquainted with the Māori language, and the history and customs of the people. In addition to various pamphlets, he is the author of \"Observations on the State of the Aboriginal Inhabitants of New Zealand\" (Auckland, 1859), and \"Suggestions for a History of the Origin and Migrations of the Maori People\" (1885)."

When the founder of the firm died, Henley became the president of the firm and ran the organization for 30 years. She was the first female architect in Rhode Island to practice under her own name. Henley designed mainly private residences along the Atlantic coast. She also designed the Wheeler School in Providence. She died in 1955 at her home in Pawtuxet, Rhode Island."

  "text" : "Frans Balthazar Solvyns (also Baltazar Solvijns, Frans Balthazar Solvijns, Balthazar Solvijns) (6 July 1760 – 10 October 1824) was a Flemish marine painter and journeyman artist, who lived in Calcutta (present-day Kolkata) between 1791 and 1803. He is considered one of the early pioneers in the field of print-making in India, along with Thomas Daniell. His collection of etchings provide a portrait of Calcutta's 18th century history, and the people and customs of Bengal. His encyclopedic and systematic approach made him a pioneer of the systematic ethnography of the Indian population. His work had an important influence on 19th century Indian painting."

  "text" : "Francis Nigel Lee (5 December 1934 – 23 December 2011) was a Christian theologian.

He obtained BA, LL.B. and MA degrees from the University of Cape Town, L.Th., BD, M.Th. and Th.D degrees from the University of Stellenbosch, and PhD from Orange Free State University, and several other doctorates from unaccredited institutions, including D.Min., S.T.D. and D.Hum. degrees from Whitefield Theological Seminary. Lee was born in Kendal in the UK, but emigrated as a child to South Africa, where he became a minister. Lee moved to the USA, where he served as a minister in the Presbyterian Church in America, as Professor of Philosophy at Shelton College, New Jersey and as Academic Dean of Graham Bible College in Bristol, Tennessee. Lee then moved to Australia, where he served as Professor at the Presbyterian Church of Queensland Theological Hall.

In the words of Peter Lyle of The Sunday Telegraph of London: \"...his pencil and his pad have been witness to many of the most significant events in postwar American and world history.\" His artistic output also included  and . His widespread recognition, as evidenced by his , his , and the broad array of  who hold his work, demonstrates that Lyle's title \"The Man Who Drew History\" is well-earned. Other than in his very early years when he did illustrations \"on spec\", he was not an \"after-the-fact\" illustrator. In his own words, drawing from life made him an \"artist-reporter\" or a \"reportorial artist.\" \"That way,\" he said, \"you can see around the corner.\""

  "text" : "Frederick Watkins (14 October 1770 – 10 November 1856) was an officer of the British Royal Navy. By 1793 he was first lieutenant on the 32-gun frigate HMS Blanche, serving in the Leeward Islands. On 5 January 1795 the captain, Robert Faulknor, was killed during a sea-fight with the French frigate Pique off Pointe-à-Pitre, and command devolved on Watkins, who continued the action. Pique was boarded by Lieutenant David Milne and captured. For his part in the action Watkins was promoted to post captain on 26 April 1795, commanding the 28-gun HMS Resource. For the next two years Watkins cruised in Resource on the Leeward Islands and Jamaica stations. On 10 December 1796 Resource, with HMS Mermaid, captured the French corvette Général Leveau off San Domingo. In the spring of 1799 he became captain of the 36-gun HMS Nereide. In the Bay of Biscay on 2 March 1800 Nereide captured the French privateer Vengeance, and on 3 March recaptured an American ship with cargo valued at £30,000. Watkins returned to the West Indies in Nereide the same year, and prevented the French capture of the Dutch colony of Curaçao, accepting the island's capitulation to the British. He returned to England in February 1801. In early 1808 Watkins was appointed to the 74-gun HMS Majestic, but was subsequently court-martialled and dismissed from his command for \"a breach of naval discipline\" towards Admiral Wells. In 1809 he published The Young Naval Hero; or Hints to Parents and Guardians on the Subject of Educating and Preparing Young Gentlemen for His Majesty's Navy. Watkins was superannuated as a Rear-Admiral on 11 June 1814. Frederick Watkins came out of retirement on 12 November 1840, when he was transferred to the active list as an Admiral of the Blue. He was further promoted to Admiral of the White on 23 November 1841 and Admiral of the Red on 20 November 1846. On 1 July 1851 Admiral Watkins was transferred to the Reserve Half-Pay List, with a pension of £150 a year."

After that, he served as ambassador of Colombia in Dominican Republic from 2002 to 2004 and subsequently served as Deputy Minister of Defense for its social and business group for two years from 2009 to 2010 during the presidential term of president Alvaro Uribe. He was in the Colombian Armed Forces for 41 years, achieving all the military ranks all the way up to his appointment as General Commander for the Colombian Armed Forces. According to magazine Semana, Tapias is remembered as the man who conceived and initiated the military modernization and reorganization program for the Colombian Armed Forces, covering each of the forces: army, aviation and navy. In a period of four years, these organizations had a profound transformation as a result of a carefully planned process of reengineering, which was fundamental for Colombia to be able to overcome a serious security crisis that had lasted for over forty years. This was a fundamental key that helped increase the necessary trust between the governments of Colombia and the United States, which benefitted the subsequent implementation of Plan Colombia. General Tapias was a fundamental element in the search of international support that generated the feasibility of Plan Colombia which later became a vital back-up for the international fight against trafficking of illegal drugs. General Tapias is currently CEO for Zehirut Group, an organization that specializes in security services and consulting for governments, companies and institutions in Latin America and the Caribbean."

  "text" : "Frank E. \"Pappy\" Noel (February 12, 1905 – November 29, 1966) was an Associated Press photographer and the winner of the 1943 Pulitzer Prize for Photography, the second winner of that prize. Born in Dalhart, Texas, Noel began his career in photography at the Chicago Daily News in 1925. He served in the United States Army Air Corps as an Aerial Photography Instructor and worked as a photographer for the Washington Post, Wichita Eagle, Kansas City Star, and the Oklahoma City News. Noel joined the Associated Press in 1937 and would spend the rest of his career with that agency. During World War II, Noel worked for the AP in the Pacific Theater. To escape the Japanese invasion of Singapore, a malaria-stricken Noel paid for passage on a British freighter bound for Rangoon, but the freighter was sunk by a Japanese torpedo. Noel was adrift in the Indian Ocean for three days when his lifeboat encountered another one. An Indian sailor in the other lifeboat asked them for water, but they had none as Noel's lifeboat was out of water as well. Noel took a picture of the sailor and it was published after his lifeboat was rescued two days later. The photograph, titled \"Water!\", won Noel the Pulitzer Prize. Later in the war, Noel covered the Malayan Campaign, Burma, and India for the AP. After the war, Noel was assigned to cover the Mediterranean. The 1948 King David Hotel bombing destroyed his photography equipment and personal effects, but he was not in the hotel at the time. Noel volunteered to cover the Korean War and accompanied the 7th Regiment of the 1st Marine Division. On his way to Chosin Reservoir, he was trapped with a marine unit by enemy forces, but they fought their way free. Two months later, on November 29, 1950, after a convoy was trapped near the reservoir, he went for help in a jeep but was intercepted and captured by enemy forces. He spent the next 32 months in communist prison camps. He unsuccessfully attempted to escape three times, once only failing because he wouldn't leave behind an ill fellow prisoner. He was even able to take exclusive pictures for the AP from inside the camps. Noel was freed in 1953 as a result of Operation Big Switch. Noel was assigned to Florida in 1958 and retired there in 1966. He died at age 61 at the J. Hillis Miller Health Science Center in Gainesville, Florida following brain surgery, where he had been hospitalized two months earlier due to a stroke."

He would later go on to found and lead Harkat-ul-Mujahedeen. Khalil was a signatory of Osama bin Laden's 1998 fatwa called the International Front Against Jews and Crusaders. He stepped down as emir of HuM in February 2000 and his second-in-command, Farooq Kashmiri, assumed leadership of the group. In May 2004, Pakistani authorities arrested Khalil for helping transport Pakistani militants into Afghanistan. After six months he was released due to lack of evidence. After Hamid and Umer Hayat reported to the Federal Bureau of Investigation in June 2005 that they had received training at an Al Qaeda camp run by Khalil, he went into hiding. In March 2006, eight assailants dragged Khalil and his driver from a mosque in Tarnol, about three miles northwest of Islamabad. He was held for five hours, beaten and left in front of a mosque on the outskirts of Islamabad. At the behest of the Musharraf government in 2007, Khalil was among a group of clerics who attempted to negotiate an end to the Red Mosque standoff. The New York Times reported in June 2011 that Khalil lived freely on the outskirts of Islamabad and continues to maintain links with the Pakistani Army."

  "text" : "Fabricio Ojeda (6 February 1929 - 21 June 1966) was a Venezuelan journalist, politician, and guerrilla leader. He was the President of the Patriotic Junta that organised the movement to end Marcos Pérez Jiménez' dictatorship (1952-1958), and was then elected to the Venezuelan Chamber of Deputies for the Democratic Republican Union (URD), before becoming a leader of the Armed Forces of National Liberation (FALN). He died in custody in 1966. As a student Ojeda became a member of the Democratic Republican Union (URD). In 1955 he began studying journalism at the Central University of Venezuela. In 1956 he became a reporter for El Nacional, based in the Miraflores Palace, and used this position to help organise the end of Jiménez' rule. On 11 June 1957 Ojeda invited two other URD members and a Communist, Guillermo García Ponce, to his home, and they agreed that the time was ripe to form a multi-partisan organisation aiming to overthrow Jiménez. The Patriotic Junta was soon joined by Democratic Action and COPEI, and used the only clandestine press left in Venezuela, that of the Communist Party of Venezuela, to publish a manifesto. The Junta ultimately played a leading role in coordinating the 1958 Venezuelan coup d'état the following January, including organising a general strike on 21 January. As the head of the Patriotic Junta, Ojeda emerged from the Jiménez dictatorship as the most important URD member after its leader, Jóvito Villalba. Ojeda was elected to the Venezuelan Chamber of Deputies for the URD in the 1958 general election, but despite the Pact of Punto Fijo power-sharing agreement the URD was edged out of power, and it left the government in 1960. Shortly after the failed military rebellions of El Carupanazo (May) and El Porteñazo (June), Ojeda resigned as Deputy on 30 June 1962, announcing that he was joining the armed guerrilla movement. He was captured in October 1962, and was later involved in the launch of the Armed Forces of National Liberation (FALN) and its political wing, the National Liberation Front (FLN), in February 1963. Ojeda escaped from prison on 15 September 1963 (with the support of the FALN and supporters in the regular army), and became Commander of the Frente Guerrillero 'José Antonio Páez', one of the FALN's cells. On 21 June 1966 Ojeda was captured in Caracas, and was found in his cell four days later, dead from apparent suicide."

  "text" : "Frank Adamo (1893 – 1988) was an American doctor honored for his medical service during World War II. He rose to the rank of Lieutenant Colonel and was awarded a Legion of Merit medal for his service. Adamo was born and raised in Tampa, Florida. As a pre-teen he went to work rolling cigars. After the cigar strike of 1910, he moved to Chicago and resumed his schooling, eventually enrolling at the Chicago College of Medicine and Surgery. He returned to Tampa in 1919 for his internship and joined the Army Reserve in 1923. Adamo went on active duty in 1940 and served in the Philippines as a surgeon. After the Japanese attack on Bataan, Adamo went to Corregidor, where he treated many casualties. Many patients suffered from gangrene. Amputation was the accepted treatment, but Adamo knew that the gangrene bacillus could not survive if exposed to oxygen, so he tried opening the wounds and applying sulfa drugs, irrigating hourly with hydrogen peroxide. The innovative treatment was effective, and Adamo was credited with saving many lives and limbs. Life Magazine called him \"Bataan's medical hero.\" Adamo was taken prisoner after the fall of Corregidor and participated in the infamous Bataan Death March. As a prison camp physician, he treated diseases and conditions such as beriberi, dengue fever, dysentery, malaria, and malnutrition. In his book P.O.W. in the Pacific: Memoirs of an American Doctor in World War II, Dr. William N. Donovan credits Adamo for saving his life. Adamo was liberated in 1945, and returned home later that year. Tampa celebrated \"Frank Adamo Day\" on April 27 with a parade. He has a street named after him, Adamo Drive, a 7-mile section of State Road 60 connecting the Channelside District of downtown Tampa and South Falkenburg Road on the western edge of Brandon. He returned to private practice as a surgeon, and was for a time the president of the county medical association. He was honored in 1960 with a trophy as the \"Most Popular Doctor\" at a local hospital. Adamo retired in 1973, at the age of 80."

Sir Francis Verney (1584 – 6 September 1615) was an English adventurer, soldier of fortune, and pirate. A nobleman by birth, he left England after the House of Commons sided with his stepmother in a legal dispute over his inheritance, and became a mercenary in Morocco and later a Barbary corsair. Verney was among the most successful captains to operate on the Barbary coast during the early 17th century and, despite having no seafaring experience, was one of four leaders of the Tunisian pirate fleet commanded by John Ward. His supposed conversion to Islam with Ward in 1610 was the cause of considerable controversy in his native country. Verney was later captured and spent two years in the Sicily slave galleys. He was rescued by an English Jesuit in 1614 and converted to Catholicism shortly before his death."
