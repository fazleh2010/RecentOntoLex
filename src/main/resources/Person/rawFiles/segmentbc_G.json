  "text" : "Gabdulkhay Khuramovich Akhatov (Russian: Габдулха́й Хура́мович Аха́тов; Volga Tatar: Габделхәй Хурам улы Əхәтов; Ğabdelxəy Huram ulı Əxətov; September 8, 1927 - November 25, 1986) was a Soviet Volga Tatar Linguist, Turkologist and an organizer of science (earning his first Ph.D in 1954) and then a second doctorate of Philology in 1965. Professor (1970). Akhatov graduated with honors from Kazan State Pedagogical Institute in 1951 and later from graduate school in 1954. He became a member of the Higher Attestation Commission of the Council of Ministers of the USSR and was also chairman of the specialized boards for doctoral and master's theses in a number of universities across the now-defunct USSR. Akhatov was the founder of a number of research institutions, including the modern scientific school of Tatar dialectological and the phraseological Kazan school. Although Gabdulkhay Akhatov was a Volga Tatar, he immersed into studying of the phonetic peculiarities of Siberian Tatar language of the indigenous population of Siberia, the Siberian Tatars. In his classic fundamental research work \"The Dialect of the West Siberian Tatars\" (1963) Akhatov wrote about Tobol-Irtysh Siberian Tatars, a western group of Siberian Tatars, who are indigenous to the Omsk and Tyumen Oblasts. After a comprehensive integrated analysis of the phonetic system, the lexical composition and the grammatical structure, the scientist concluded that the language of the Siberian Tatars was a separate language from the beginning, and it is one of the most ancient Turkic languages. He put the dialects of the Siberian Tatar language into two categories; one of Baraba and Tom Tatars which he named dialects of Eastern Siberian Tatars, while dialects of Tyumen and Omsk Oblasts he named dialects of Western Siberian Tatars. By studying the phonetic peculiarities of the dialect of the local population of Siberia, Professor G.Akhatov first among the scientists discovered in the Speech of Siberian Tatars is such a thing as 'clip-clop', which in his opinion, was obtained for the Siberian Tatars of Kipchaks. Akhatov, for the first time in Turkic studies, gave a theoretically consistent and systematic description of the idiomatic expressions of the Volga Tatar language. He is the author of the widely known book - \"Phraseological Dictionary of the Tatar Language\" (1982). For more than 30 years, Professor Akhatov headed the department of Tatar philology at various universities and institutes in Russia. Akhatov also did research on the general theory of language. He published a fundamental work on the main sign of paired words, explored and thoroughly investigated the nature of the double negative in the Turkic languages, and also discovered and formulated the law of pairing in Turkic languages. Akhatov trained over 40 doctors and candidates of sciences, and published about 200 scientific papers. He was a true polyglot. He knew more than two dozen languages. A number of his scientific works were highly praised at the XIII International Congress of Linguists (ICL) (Tokyo, 1982).Akhatov organized and led several dialectological expeditions and was the author of fundamental scientific works, dictionaries, textbooks, manuals and programs for dialectology, phraseology, and lexicology. He was a recipient of the Medal \"For Labour Valour\" and the Medal \"Veteran of Labour\". His son Aydar Akhatov (born 20 June 1957) is a Russian state, political and public figure, Economist, a second doctorate in Economics, Ecologist and Lawyer"

He is one of the most popular political leaders in Nepal and has a large following in various social networking sites. He emerged as potential future leader of the country during the agitation against King Gyanendra's direct rule during the months leading to the 2006 democracy movement in Nepal. Since then, he has been seen as a fresh and young face in contrast to the usual political landscape dominated by septuagenarian and octogenarian politicians who have been in the political center-stage for decades. The young generation often portrays him to be their leader as a future Prime Minister of Nepal. He was also a member of 1st Nepalese Constituent Assembly (2008–12). Widely recognized for his oratory, many Nepali people believe that he can lead the nation in an executive role if presented with an opportunity."

  "text" : "Giustina Mistrello Destro (Padua, 9 June 1945) is an Italian politician and entrepreneur. An entrepreneur by profession, Destro joined politics relatively late in her life. In 1999 she formed a list for Padua municipal election and ran as an independent candidate for mayor, with the support of centre-right parties, notably including Forza Italia (FI). Her bid was successful as she defeated outgoing mayor Flavio Zanonato in a run-off. Having joined FI in 2001, she ran as the official FI candidate four years later. Most Paduans were unimpressed by her record as mayor and she was consequently trounced in the election: she obtained just 33.6% of the vote and her long-time opponent Zanonato went on to win in the first round with 51.9% of the vote. Despite her unpopularity among voters in Padua, she continued her political career through the ranks of FI and, later, The People of Freedom (PdL). She was elected to the Italian Chamber of Deputies at the 2006 general election and re-elected in 2008. An enthusiastic supporter of fellow entrepreneur Silvio Berlusconi, during her second term as deputy, she grew critical of him. In November 2010 she joined former minister Claudio Scajola and the Christopher Columbus Foundation, whose members were known as Scajoliani and tended to be critical of Berlusconi. In August 2011 she expressed her support for Luca Cordero di Montezemolo's Future Italy. On 14 October 2011 Destro voted against Berlusconi's government during a vote of confidence. Following this, she abruptly left the PdL and confirmed her support to Montezemolo instead, saying that he would soon launch his political bid."

  "text" : "Gilbert M. Gaul (born May 18, 1951) is an American journalist. He has won two Pulitzer Prizes and been a finalist for three others. Gaul was born in Jersey City and grew up in Kearny, New Jersey. He attended St. Benedict's Prep in Newark, NJ, where he was a state champion in the javelin throw. He graduated from Fairleigh Dickinson University in 1973 and shortly thereafter started his career as a journalist. Gaul worked at the Times-News in Lehighton, Pennsylvania, before moving to The Pottsville Republican in the anthracite coal region. There, he teamed with Elliot Jaspin on a five-part series on the collapse of the huge Blue Coal Corporation, once one of the largest producers of soft coal. For their efforts, they shared the 1979 Pulitzer Prize for Investigative Reporting, citing \"stories on the destruction of the Blue Coal Company by men with ties to organized crime\", among other national reporting awards. In 1980, Gaul worked for the Philadelphia Bulletin covering Atlantic City, which recently had added casino gaming. He returned to Pottsville a year later and worked on a series detailing millions in waste in the county government, which won a National Headliners Award for investigative reporting. In 1982-1983, Gaul was a Nieman Fellow at Harvard University, where he studied business, law and public health. He briefly returned to Pottsville and then moved to The Philadelphia Inquirer, covering medical economics on the business staff. In 1989, Gaul wrote a five-part series on the business of buying and selling human blood, as well as safety flaws in the nation's blood system. The Inquirer won next year's Pulitzer Prize for Public Service citing \"reporting by Gilbert M. Gaul that disclosed how the American blood industry operates with little government regulation or supervision.\" Meanwhile, Gaul was personally a finalist for the National Reporting Pulitzer. In all, Gaul worked at The Inquirer for 18 years. In 1994, he was again finalist for the National Reporting Pulitzer, for a series disclosing the explosive growth of non-profit organizations and their impact on the economy and tax laws. The series won numerous awards, including the Havard Goldsmith Prize for Investigative Reporting. In 2001, Gaul was finalist for the National Reporting Pulitzer for a five-part series on the business and commercialization of college sports. (On all three occasions there were three Pulitzer Prize for National Reporting finalists, the winner and two runners-up.) In 2000, Gaul briefly worked at The New York Times and in 2001 joined the national investigative staff at The Washington Post, where he remained through 2009. While there, Gaul authored a number of series, including a 2006 detailing $15 billion in waste in federal agricultural subsidies that was a Pulitzer finalist in National Reporting. Dan Morgan and Sara Cohen worked with Gaul on the series. In 2010, Gaul became a contributing writer to the non-profit Kaiser Health News, specializing in enterprise and long-form stories. He is also the author of three books, including Giant Steps, a chronicle of his son, Cary, who was born with spina bifida. Gaul is married to Cathryn Candy, an art teacher. His older son, Gregory, a Princeton graduate, lives and works in Tennessee."

  "text" : "Guy Louis Busson du Maurier DSO (18 May 1865, London, England – 9 Mar 1915, Kemmel, Flanders, Belgium) was an English army officer and playwright. He was the son of the writer George du Maurier and brother of Sylvia Llewelyn Davies and the actor Gerald du Maurier. He was educated at Marlborough and the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, and in 1885 became an officer in the Royal Fusiliers. He served in the Second Boer War, where he commanded a mounted infantry regiment, earning the Distinguished Service Order in 1902. He achieved notoriety in 1909 as the author of the play An Englishman's Home. which tells the story of the Brown family under invasion by an unnamed foreign power, widely assumed to represent Germany. When the play was staged in Germany, it caused an outrage, as the German press saw clear references to their Homeland. In 1940 it was made into a propaganda film, more pointedly titled \"Mad Men of Europe\". At the death of his sister Sylvia, and as requested in her will, he became co-guardian to the Llewelyn Davies boys who inspired Peter Pan. He served for the last time in World War I, being killed in action in Flanders in 1915. J. M. Barrie wrote to Guy's nephew George Llewelyn Davies to inform him of the death; by the time Barrie received his response, George himself had been killed."

In 2008 he authored Digitize This Book!: The Politics of New Media, or Why We Need Open Access Now. Published by the University of Minnesota Press, it was the first book on open access publishing and archiving written specifically from a critical theory perspective. Together with Clare Birchall, Joanna Zylinska and Open Humanities Press, Hall created the Jisc-funded project LivBL: Living Books about Life, a sustainable series of electronic open access books about life - with life understood both philosophically and biologically - providing a bridge between the humanities and the sciences. In 1999, along with Dave Boothroyd, Hall founded the online, open access, peer-reviewed journal of cultural studies and cultural theory, Culture Machine. In 2006, together with Steve Green, he established the first open access archive for cultural and media studies research, CSeARCH (Cultural Studies e-Archive), and in 2006, working with Sigi Jottkandt, David Ottina, and Paul Ashton, he founded Open Humanities Press in response to the perceived crisis in academic publishing."

He studied at the University of Jena from 1654-1658. Eimmart the Younger resided at Nuremberg, where he died in 1705. He engraved some plates for Sandrart's Academia, and some small etchings of ruins, buildings, and vases, ornamented with figures, which have considerable merit. He was also a mathematician and astronomer, and published in 1701 Iconographia nova contemplationum de Sole. His mother was Christine Banns (?-1654), daughter of an Austrian toll manager, Damian Banns. On 20 April 1668 he married Maria Walther, daughter of the weighmaster, Christian Walther. His daughter Maria Clara Eimmart (1676–1707) was a designer and engraver as well. She usually worked with her father. She married the astronomer, J. H. Müller, and died at Altdorf in 1707. He established the first astronomical observatory in Nürnberg. The lunar crater Eimmart is named after Georg Christoph Eimmart the Younger."

  "text" : "Green Buren Adair (October 1840 Talladega County, Alabama - April 20, 1914, Atlanta) was a prominent Atlanta cotton merchant who conducted business in Atlanta from the Civil War until the turn of the 20th century. Green B. was a cousin of George Washington Adair, another prominent real estate mogul in Atlanta. Adair served in the Confederate Army including the Battle of Appomattox Courthouse. Adair settled in Atlanta in 1866 and entered the wholesale commission and fertilizer business together with his brother Augustus D. Adair (1835–1922), and in a few years became one of Atlanta’s most successful merchants. 1890 property tax records indicate that he owned $26,500 worth of property. He retired from active business in 1891, when his eldest son, Green B. Adair Jr. (b. 1887 d. 1968), was still a toddler, but remained active in Atlanta charities and business affairs. In the 1880s and 1890s he served on the Atlanta City Council. He was instrumental in building the Second Baptist Church, which was located at Washington and Mitchell streets, and later joined the Highland Park Baptist Church, which opened in 1908 on Highland Avenue at the northwest corner of Highland and Greenwood avenues. The Adairs lived on fashionable Washington Street as of 1891, but in 1892 Adair acquired 16 acres (6.5 ha) of land for $17,000 at the southwest corner of Highland and Virginia avenues in what is today Virginia-Highland neighborhood of Atlanta. The land was in the country at the time, but easily accessed by the new Nine-Mile Circle streetcar line. Adair had a summer house built on the site, which was completed in 1895. In 1911 the family moved in permanently. The Adair Mansion remains a landmark and is divided into apartments. (It is now located on Rupley Avenue as bungalows were built on the land between the mansion and the Virginia-Highland intersection.) He died on April 20, 1914, of a paralytic stroke. His obituary described him as \"one of Atlanta’s most beloved citizens,\" known for his acts of charity and in the business world as a man of sterling character, energetic and progressive.\" He was buried in Oakland Cemetery. Green B. Adair was also the name of a comedy act from the 1920s."

  "text" : "Giovanni \"Gino\" Berretta is a former award winning kicker in the Canadian Football League. A native of Pisa, Italy, Berretta went from Marymount High School in Notre-Dame-de-Grâce to the ranks of local professional soccer, where he was scouted by the Montreal Alouettes. At only 19 years old he suited up for his rookie season in 1961. In 8 games he managed a respectable 40.3 yards per punt average, yet he was cut by the Als, even though he would go on to win the Gruen Trophy as the best rookie in the east (at a time when only Canadians could win the award.) He spent 1962 in the junior ranks with the top local team, the NDG Maple Leafs, and was back in an Als uniform for 1963. He had a good season as a punter, kicker and handling kickoffs. Even though he also caught 4 passes for 61 yards and a touchdown, Berretta represented a new type of player: the kicking specialist. In 1964 he made only one of nine field goal attempts, and became the punter for 1964 thru to 1966. His average dropped to 38.1 yards in 1966 and as a result he ended playing all of 1967 with the Montreal Beavers of the Continental Football League. 1968 saw him play 3 games as a back up punter for the Grey Cup champion Ottawa Rough Riders. Finally, his career ended in 1969 with 7 final games with the Alouettes. After his football days Berretta completed his education in orthosis and prosthesis and became owner of J.E. Hanger, a Quebec company that is a leader in the sales of orthopedic, prosthetic and surgical appliances."

Bush administration officials for their roles in war crimes committed against citizens or residents of Spain while the US held them in extrajudicial detention. Boye was born in Chile. Many nations allow war crime charges to be laid against non-citizens, and non-residents, when the countries where they lived when the war crimes were committed has failed to initiate an effective inquiry.Spain has a tradition of being more aggressive than other nations, famously trying to extradite Chilean leader Augusto Pinochet from Britain. In 2009 Boye tried to initiate extradition of six former officials from the Presidency of George W. Bush. Andrew C. McCarthy, writing in the National Review asserted that Boye earned his law degree when he was in prison for playing a role in the political kidnapping of Emiliano Revilla. Boye was one of four individuals profiled in the award winning documentary The Guantanamo trap.The movie challenges whether Boye was fairly convicted for the kidnapping. According to Deutsche Welle Boye was \"a victim of police torture himself\"."

He participated in the Hambacher Fest and later in the campaigns of the Revolutions of 1848 in the German states. In 1850 he immigrated to the United States as part of a larger wave of politically active Forty-Eighters, following the defeat of that movement in continental Europe, and remained politically active in his new, democratic homeland. Because of this background, he was particularly concerned with the struggle for of human rights and became involved with both the socialist and the abolitionist movements. At the beginning of the American Civil War he joined the Union Army. He was killed in 1862 by a drunken fellow soldier."

  "text" : "Gibor Basri is an American astrophysicist, born in New York on May 3, 1951. The son of Phyllis Basri, a professor of dance and ballet, and Saul Basri, professor of physics at the University of Colorado, Basri grew up in Fort Collins, Colorado, together with his younger brother David. The family lived for brief periods in Burma (1957) and Sri Lanka (1965). Basri graduated in physics at Stanford University in 1973, and received his Ph.D. in astrophysics at the University of Colorado in 1979. His thesis, under the supervision of Jeffrey Linsky, was on stellar activity, based on observations by the International Ultraviolet Explorer (IUE) satellite, of which he was one of the first users. A postdoctoral award took him to the U.C. Berkeley astronomy department where he has been a professor since 1994. His work there originally focused on high-energy observations of stars (with Stuart Bowyer). In the last decade he turned to studies of star formation (with Len Kuhi). Basri's most noteworthy work includes a 1980 study of T Tauri-type stars, and he is recognized as a world expert on brown dwarf stars. In 2011, as vice chancellor for equity and inclusion for the U.C. Berkeley campus, he served as a communicator between the university administration and students supporting the Occupy movement."

  "text" : "Gese Wechel (born in Hamburg, died in Lübeck 1645), was the managing director of the Swedish Post Office, Postverket from 1637 until 1642. She was the second director of the Swedish Post Office, and the first female postmaster in Sweden, entitled Sveriges rikes postmästarinna (Postmistress of the Swedish Realm). Gese Wechel was originally a domestic servant in the household of the Swedish envoy in Hamburg in Germany. In the 1630s, she married Anders Wechel, a German in Swedish service who managed the Swedish postoffice in Hamburg. In 1636, the Swedish Post Office was founded, and she followed her husband to Sweden, where he received the position as its first managing director. Anders Wechel was in bad health, and she was in reality forced to manage his work as director. In 1637, she became a widow and continued to manage the post office, and 25 October 1638 she was officially confirmed in her position as director with the acknowledgement that she had already functioned as such for two years. She worked alongside Steen von Steenhausen, who tended to the juridical matters of the office, and all orders were to be signed by them jointly. In 1642, Wechel was fired from her post with reference to her gender. She moved to Lübeck, where she died. Gese Wechel was the first example of the female postmasters in Sweden who took over their profession from their late spouses: from 1637 until 1722, eight percent (or 40) of the postmasters in Sweden were female, and Margareta Beijer had the same position as Wechel in 1669-1673. Women were excluded from service in the new regulation of 1722, and allowed again in 1863."

  "text" : "George Bickford Moysey (14 May 1874 – 18 May 1932) was an Australian sportsman who played Australian rules football and cricket at a high level. He played for Melbourne in the Victorian Football League (VFL) and also competed in the West Australian Football Association/League. As a cricketer he played one first-class match for Western Australia. Moysey was from Tasmania but was already playing for Melbourne by the time the VFL was formed. He was one of six Melbourne players to appear in all 17 possible games of the inaugural league season in 1897, which included three finals. His 12 goals that year were bettered by only two teammates. He spent two more seasons at the club and in 1899 represented Victoria in an interstate fixture against South Australia. Having found employment at the Mount Morgans Gold Mine, Moysey moved to Western Australia at the turn of the 20th century. He worked there for six years, then moved to Perth, where he began playing for the Perth Football Club, which he would captain. Later, he also played for Subiaco. When the Marylebone Cricket Club toured Australia in 1907/08, Moysey was picked in the Western Australian team to play them at the WACA Ground. Facing an attack that consisted of English Test players, the left handed batsman was bowled by Jack Crawford for eight in the first innings and dismissed by Wilfred Rhodes in his second innings. In 1910 he almost drowned in The Basin at Rottnest Island when the current swept him out to sea. He was said to have been sinking by the time his companion, Percy Bailey, rescued him. Bailey received a Royal Humane Society award for his act of saving Moysey's life. He would eventually return to the city of Melbourne and died there in 1932."

He attended Harvard Law School for a year before joining the publishing firm of Ginn, Heath & Co., a publisher of educational textbooks later known as Ginn & Co., which he would eventually head. Plimpton was an avid collector of historical books and manuscripts, focusing on the history of education. Shortly before his death in 1936, Plimpton donated numerous items to Columbia University's Butler Library, including 317 medieval and Renaissance manuscripts that made Columbia's collection in that area one of the most significant in the country. One of his donations, Plimpton 322, is a Babylonian clay tablet from around 1800 BCE purchased from antiquarian Edgar James Banks. It consists of a table of cuneiform numbers, specifically Pythagorean triples. Described as \"one of the world's most famous mathematical artifacts\", it may have been a set of solutions for mathematics students. Other donated items included: \n*  The first printed edition of Euclid's Elements of Geometry from 1482. \n*  The only known copy of the Treviso Arithmetic, a Venetian math textbook. \n*  An annotated copy of the works of Homer owned by Philip Melanchthon and inscribed by Martin Luther. \n*  A copy of Herodotus' Histories owned by Desiderius Erasmus. Active in educational philanthropy, Plimpton was a trustee of Amherst College, Barnard College, and Constantinople College in Istanbul. Plimpton was the author of The Education of Shakespeare and The Education of Chaucer. Plimpton was married to Francis Taylor Pearsons from 1892 until her death in 1900. Their son was Francis Taylor Pearsons Plimpton, father of author George Plimpton. In 1917 he married Fanny Hastings, a descendant of Thomas Hastings. Their children were Calvin Hastings Plimpton and Emily Plimpton."

  "text" : "George Grantham (born January 20, 1947 in Cordell, Oklahoma) is an American drummer and vocalist best known for his work with pioneering country rock band Poco. Grantham and pedal steel guitarist Rusty Young were members of the Denver-based psychedelic rock act Boenzee Cryque when Young left the band in mid-1968 for Los Angeles. There Young fell in with Buffalo Springfield members Richie Furay and Jim Messina as they wrapped up that band's final album. With Buffalo Springfield disintegrated, Furay, Messina, and Young joined together to create a new band, originally named \"Pogo\" but then shortly rechristened \"Poco\" after copyright concerns forced a change. The band needed a drummer, and Young recruited Grantham, who became part of Poco's founding line-up. Grantham's backup vocals were an important element of the band's distinctive harmony sound. Grantham remained a member of various Poco line-ups through 1977, a span of ten studio albums and two live releases. He returned in 1985, and was part of four of five band incarnations before departing again 1990. Reunited once more in 2000, he suffered a debilitating stroke in 2004 and was unable to rejoin the band again until some vocals-only appearances in 2009."

  "text" : "George Horace Gallup, Jr. (April 9, 1930 – November 21, 2011) was an American pollster, writer and executive at The Gallup Organization, which had been founded by his father, George Gallup. Gallup expanded the scope of the Gallup Poll to encompass a wider variety of topics, ranging from the outlook of American young people to religious beliefs. Much of Gallup's writings and research focused on religion and spirituality in the United States. His works included The Saints Among Us, published in 1992, and The Next American Spirituality, published in 2002. Born in Evanston, Illinois, Gallup graduated from the Lawrenceville School in 1948 and received a bachelor's degree in religion from Princeton University in 1953. In 1954, Gallup joined his father's polling company, The Gallup Organization, where he worked until his retirement in 2004. He and his brother, Alec Gallup, became co-chairmen of the company upon their father's death. George Gallup was diagnosed with liver cancer in 2010. He died in Princeton, New Jersey, on November 21, 2011, at the age of 81. He was married to Kingsley Hubby, with whom he had three children. He was a devout Episcopalian, who once considered the ministry but instead served as an active layman."

She was not recognized as the WOP back then because her age was only posthumously verified by the Gerontology Research Group (GRG) and because Kamato Hongo's age claim was accepted until 2012, when the GRG withdrew its acceptance of it. She was born in London, England, but her family moved to Montreal, Quebec, Canada with her only sister. After her parents divorced when she was a teenager, she lived with foster parents until she married Ray Clawson in 1917. She had two daughters, Viola and Gladys, and became a widow in 1950. Before retiring, she worked as an embroiderer and as an office worker. At age 95, in 1982, Mrs. Clawson moved to the U.S. state of Florida, in order to live with her younger daughter Gladys, doing so for many years before going to live to an assisted living facility. She remained mentally sharp until her very last day of life, enjoying talks with her family and friends. Mrs. Clawson died on 28 May 2002, aged 114 years, 194 days. She was survived by her 2 daughters, Viola and Gladys (aged 83 and 79 at the time), 5 grandchildren, 14 great- grandchildren and 11 great-great-grandchildren. She long believed that she was born in 1889 until her family ordered her birth certificate from the United Kingdom and discovered that Clawson was actually two years older than she thought she was. Before finding out this fact, Grace Clawson humorously celebrated her 100th birthday in 1989, when it was actually her 102nd birthday."

From 1921 through 1934, Bokii was the head of the so-called \"special department\" of the Soviet secret police apparatus, believed to have been in charge of the Soviet Union's concentration camp system. He remained a top level functionary in the secret police apparatus until his sudden arrest in May 1937 as part of the Great Terror. Following an extended investigation, Bokii was given a summary trial and executed in November of that same year. In 1956, Bokii was posthumously rehabilitated by Soviet authorities."

  "text" : "Giuseppe Errante (1760 – February 16, 1821) was an Italian painter. He was born in Trapani, Sicily. A local priest obtained for him an apprenticeship in the studio of a local sculptor, Domenico Nolfo. In 1760, Errante studied in Palermo under Gioacchino Martorana. By 1784, he had moved to Rome with the support of Antonio Canova. By 1791, he was employed in the Caserta Palace, Naples. In Naples, he met Jacob Philipp Hackert. On account of his political intrigues, he was obliged to flee Naples. After a number of travails, he arrived in Milan in 1795, and afterwards established himself at Rome in 1810. Besides historical subjects, he painted portraits, in which he was especially successful. He died in Rome in 1821. Francesco Cancellieri wrote a posthumous biography of the painter in 1824. Among his pupils in Rome was Giuseppe Gandolfo and in Sicily Giuseppe Mazzarese."

  "text" : "Greg Adams (born 1970 in Muncie, Indiana) ran the independent reissue record label Beehive Rebellion Records before writing for the All-Music Guide, penning liner notes for numerous reissue record labels and compiling greatest hits anthologies as an A&R coordinator. Beehive Rebellion issued two releases in the 1990s: a reissue of the New Zealand band Electric Blood's previously cassette-only album Electric Easter (featuring Robert Scott of The Bats)  and a reissue of Sex Clark Five's Strum & Drum! that contained the band's complete self-released Records to Russia recordings. The latter was ranked by Goldmine magazine as one of the 50 best U.S. power pop albums of all time. An intended third release, a reissue of the Electric Blood cassettes Acoustic Splendour and Actual Stuff, to be titled The Man Who Tasted Shapes, never materialized. The label was reactivated in 2013 to release the album An Instructive Amusement by Cozy Catastrophes. Adams wrote over 1,000 album reviews and artist biographies for AMG and contributed to 10 books in the All-Music Guide series in addition to writing liner notes for and/or producing over 60 releases on record labels such as Bear Family, Collectors' Choice Music, ERIC Records, Omni Recording Company, Bloodshot Revival, Soundies, Hit Parade, and Complete 60s. From 2000-2008 he hosted Rhythm Ranch, a thematic oldies radio program on WFHB. Adams conducted pop singer Georgia Gibbs' last interview, which was published on the Eric Records website."

He came from a landed family who had lived at Spains Hall, Finchingfield, Essex, since the 18th century. The original house can be traced to the Domesday survey. He was schooled at Eton College like his elder brother John Ruggles-Brise and joined the 104th (Essex Yeomanry) Field Brigade RA. In 1940 he was sent for Commando training to Scotland, where he met his future wife Elizabeth Knox, and they married soon after. As a Captain he departed with No 7 Commando for North Africa, where he was captured during the raid on Bardia in 1941, handed over to the Italians and transferred to Naples by ship. As a prisoner of war he was held at camp PG35 at Padula near Salerno from May 1942 until June 1943. After the Allies invaded Italy he was sent to PG19 camp further north at Bologna before being transferred to Castello di Vincigliata PG12 in the latter days before the Italian armistice. The castle held some the highest ranking British and Commonwealth officers captured in WWII many during the campaigns in North Africa. They included Lieutenant General Sir Philip Neame VC, Air Marshal Owen Tudor Boyd, General Sir Richard Nugent O'Connor as well as an old school-friend Daniel Knox, 6th Earl of Ranfurly. He was amongst the small party including some NCO’s released by General Chiapati in September 1943. They were driven to Firenze Campo di Marte railway station from where a special train took them to Arezzo. The party eventually dispersed and spent many months with the partisans in the Apennines. He together with Rudolph Vaughan, John Combe (John Frederick Boyce Combe),Ted Todhunter Edward Joseph Todhunter, and Dan Ranfurly from Vincigliata and two others  they had picked up along the way managed to reach the coast and put out to sea in a boat, which began to leak badly. After rowing and bailing for 24 hours they were at last picked up by an Italian vessel which landed them at Ancona, from where they were shipped to brigade HQ on May 30, 1944. Lady Ranfurly featured this incident in her book of memoirs, To War with Whittaker. After the war he became a member of the London Stock Exchange, a senior partner with Wontner, Dolphin & Francis, and a consultant with Brewin Dolphin & Co. He was High Sheriff of Essex 1967-68 and Vice-Chairman of Riding for Disabled Trust. He later bought an estate in Achnasheen, Scotland where he enjoyed the country life and deer stalking. His wife Elizabeth died in 1988 and he remarried Christine Margaret Fothergill-Spencer in 1994. He died at the age of 86."

  "text" : "George Ali (born George Bolingbroke; 1866-1947) was an actor who specialized in the \"skin game\", playing animals in stage and cinema productions, known as an Animal Impersonator . He performed in a number of stage plays, working as lions, tigers, and bears, but it was as the canine nursemaid Nana and the Crocodile in the 1924 film adaptation of Peter Pan for which he seems best remembered. Barrie had written the part expecting it to be played by a boy, but adults were cast for the technically demanding role. Ali played the character at the age of 58. George Ali's performance as Nana was highly acclaimed. Of particular note is the puppeteering of Nana’s mouth and eyes. Ali manipulates the head features from within, picking up towels and carrying spoons, whilst walking on all fours. He was a very skilled puppeteer and gymnast. It’s unknown if Ali also had a hand in creating his special costumes. In the early days of film and television, it was not uncommon for makeup artists and stuntmen to create and perform their own special effects characters. It is said that he also played the part of the Crocodile as well. Ali died April 26, 1947, in Freeport, Long Island, NY."

  "text" : "Gerry Livingston was born in Smith Falls, Ontario in 1914. He was a graduate of Assumption College in Windsor, Ontario and was an accomplished athlete throughout his youth and years at college. After graduating, he played on championship teams in the Detroit Baseball federation and was also courted by the Detroit Tigers. In 1941 he founded Livingston Wood Products in London, Ontario to manufacture wooden shipping crates and wooden parts for automobiles and farm implements. To accommodate the expanding business, he relocated it to Tillsonburg in 1943. In 1945 he incorporated this company as Livingston Lumber and Manufacturing Limited. Gerry Livingston's business interests grew to include Canadian and international packaging and distribution services and also a florist shop, transportation services, a garage and a restaurant. In 1967 the company's corporate name was changed to Livingston Industries Limited and, in 1968, Gerry Livingston sold most of his shares to Allpak Products Limited (now called Ivest). Gerry Livingston remained involved with the company and was Chairman of the Board until 1978, when Allpak bought the company outright and took it private. Gerry Livingston continued as the honorary chairman until his death in 1988. The company has undergone further changes, including being bought and sold by others, plus buying and selling business themselves. It exists today as Livingston International. Sports, particularly basketball remained a passion throughout Gerry Livingston's life. During the 1940s, he helped build a new arena, co-sponsored a hockey team, and became the main supporter of basketball, softball and baseball teams in Tillsonburg. His method of recruiting for the Tillsonburg Livingston basketball team, the \"Livvies,\" was direct; any high school athlete with a talent for the game was assured of a job at the Livingston plant. In 1952 the senior Livvies, with players such as Bill Coulthard, defeated Winnipeg in the national championships to advance to the Olympic trials where they defeated the university champions, the Western Mustangs. The Livvies, therefore, represented Canada at the 1952 Olympic Games in Helsinki, Finland. In 1960 the Livvies won the national title and represented Canada for the second time at the pre-Olympic qualifiers for Rome. A devout Catholic, Gerry Livingston was active at St. Mary's parish in Tillsonburg. In recognition of his charitable work, he was knighted by Pope John XXIII in 1962, received the Order of St. Gregory and was later named a Knight of Malta. A plaque honouring Gerry Livingston is on the \"Wall of Fame\" in Tillsonburg Town Centre to recognise his contributions to the town, including donation of a building and continued financing that supports the Tillsonburg & District Multi-Service Centre. It was dedicated in 1985 during \"Gerry Livingston Weekend\" festivities. Gerry Livingston had another consuming interest that he pursued in his retirement—real estate. He planned and built a luxury subdivision near Naples, Florida, a favourite winter retreat for Canadians Mr. Livingston died in October 1988, at the age of 73. He was inducted into the Canadian Basketball Hall of Fame in 2001."

He observed the differences in bird development, by both observing egg hatching and manipulating variables important to bird development, including calls. Gottlieb's major contribution to the field of psychology was his theory of Probabilistic Epigenesis, which explains that there is no predetermined path to trait development.

  "text" : "Gurak or Ghurak was a medieval Sogdian ruler in Central Asia during the period of the Muslim conquest of Transoxiana. In 710, he was installed as king (Sogdian: ikhshid) of Samarkand after the populace overthrew his predecessor, Tarkhun, due to his pro-Muslim stance. The Umayyad governor, Qutayba ibn Muslim, campaigned against Samarkand but in the end confirmed Gurak as its ruler. Gurak was a cautious and intelligent ruler, and managed, through shifting alliance between the Muslims and the Turgesh, to remain on his throne. Some time after the Muslim defeat at the Battle of the Defile in 731, he managed to recover his capital, Samarkand, and achieve a quasi-independence which he maintained until his death in 737 or 738. His realm was then divided among his relatives (known from Chinese sources): Tu-ho, formerly prince of Kabudhan, received Samarkand, Me-chu'o was king of Mayamurgh, while a certain Ko-lopu-lo who was king of Ishtikhan in 742 may perhaps be identified with Gurak's brother Afarun."

  "text" : "Graeme Thomas Wood AM (born 1947; Rockhampton, Queensland) is an Australian internet entrepreneur, philanthropist and environmentalist. He is the founder of online travel site Wotif.com and The Global Mail, a not-for-profit multimedia site for journalism in the public interest. In January 2013, Wood was named as a prominent backer of a new digital edition of The Guardian in Australia. He said it would add quality and diversity to Australian media as well as fostering a closer interaction with the rest of the world. In July 2013 The Global Mail became the first institutional member of the Washington-based International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ), as part of Wood’s three-year, US$1.5 million grant to bolster cross-border investigative reporting. The deal includes a new Global Investigative Journalism Fellowship for an Australian journalist and full-time research desk for the consortium. In June 2013, Wood also was elected a member of the board of directors of the US-based Center for Public Integrity, the nonprofit, nonpartisan news organisation that supports the ICIJ. Other businesses Wood has founded, co-founded, or acquired interests in include Wotnews, which closed down in 2012 after spawning We Are Hunted, a music recommendation website sold to Twitter in 2013. Wood also founded Wild Mob in 2008, a not-for-profit organisation that aims to protect Australia’s most threatened species and ecosystems, and Artology in 2011, an organization that unlocks the creative potential of young people through experiential learning in the performing arts, through programs such as WotOpera. Wood was made a Member of the Order of Australia (AM) in the 2012 Australia Day Honours. He has been awarded Suncorp Queenslander of the Year, received an Honorary Doctorate of Economics from the University of Queensland and has been a large donor to the University. An environmentalist and advocate of government transparency, Wood gave the largest political donation in Australian history in 2010, to the federal Greens party. In 2011, Wood partnered with Jan Cameron through Triabunna Investments to purchase the Triabunna Woodchip Mill in Tasmania. Although the mill was supposed to keep operating for five years it remains mothballed."

  "text" : "Gautier d'Espinal (also d'Epinal, d’Épinal or d'Espinau) (died before July 1272) was a French composer and trouvère poet of the 13th century. Grove states that while details of his life are lacking, some documents of the time mention a Gautier d'Espinal active between 1232 and 1272, but it is uncertain if this is the trouvère, as some of the songs attributed to him suggest an earlier date. Most likely Gautier was one of the seigneurs of the city of Epinal. However, Robert Lug's more recent (2007) study of the Saint-Germain-des-Prés chansonnier (Trouvère MS U) shows that Gautier is not the person in the mentions cited by Grove, but was in fact a cleric, a nephew of the bishop of Metz. As Gautier's songs are contained in the oldest part of Trouvère MS U, they must have been composed before 1231–32. His work was popular and widely distributed, with some of his compositions appearing in over a dozen separate source documents. Grove lists fourteen songs with reliable attribution to Gautier, eleven of them with extant melodies. The list below relies instead on Spanke's revision of Raynaud's catalogue, and gives greater detail than Grove. The total listing below gives 21 songs, 13 with surviving melodies, plus a further four songs, all with surviving melodies, of which three are probably by other trouvères."

  "text" : "Gustav Walter was a 19th-century German impresario who managed vaudeville theatres in San Francisco and founded the Orpheum Circuit — a chain of vaudeville theatres from the Pacific Coast to the Mid-West. Walter emigrated to the USA in 1865. He moved to San Francisco in 1874 where he opened a concert saloon called The Fountain on Kearny Street. He managed the Vienna Gardens on Stockton Street and then opened the Wigwam Variety Hall on the same street. In 1886, he then built a grand theatre on O'Farrell Street which would seat 3500. This was the Orpheum Opera House which staged performances of opera, plays and vaudeville. The prices started at 10 cents for the balcony or children up to 50 cents for a box. This was low for the time and the theatre soon became the most popular in San Francisco. Following this success he opened another Orpheum in Los Angeles and then another in Sacramento. This was the start of the successful Orpheum Circuit which became a major chain of theatres. Walter overspent on expensive acts from Europe such as Parisian ballet or a Hungarian boys military band. His chronic shortage of money led him the lease the Orpheum to John Cort in 1891. The financial panic of 1893 forced Cort out and Walter returned to manage the Orpheum with Morris Meyerfeld, Jr. providing the finance and business acumen. Meyerfield organised a chain of theatres from the Pacific coast to the Mid-West. The Kansas City Orpheum opened in 1898 but then Gustav Walter died of appendicitits on 9 May. Meyerfield immediately announced that the show would go on and the Orpheum circuit continued to expand with Martin Beck as its general manager."

  "text" : "Gregory Randolph Kasten is an American attorney and author. Born April 11, 1955 in Oakland, California, Kasten received a bachelor's degree in American Studies from Reed College in Portland, Oregon in 1978 and a J.D. from Golden Gate University School of Law in 1982. He was admitted to the California bar in 1984. Now working in San Francisco, California, Kasten's first book was Just Trust Me: Finding the Truth in a World of Spin (Quest Books, 2011) a nonfiction work on critical thinking. The book presents methods for discovering truths behind advertising, politics, media, family and social relationships. Kasten has described the genesis of the book as his experiences in a rural community \"It was 1970, and my family had recently moved from the San Francisco Bay Area to a town in the San Joaquin Valley…One evening I found myself sitting on a couch at my friend Earl's house…Walter Cronkite was finishing up a newscast with a bit of commentary. He spoke about the dangers of making up one's mind too quickly and labeling events before fully understanding them…His concluding phrase was something like, \"Let's not be too quick to use the label-making device.\" Earl looked over at me. \"Do you know what the crap he was talking about?\" Kasten has said the book is an attempt to answer that question. The trade publication Publishers Weekly observed \"G. Randy Kasten explains how to discern fact from fiction in all your personal and professional dealings with others so as not to be taken for a ride.\" The Magical Buffet stated \"…your mind will probably be blown on more than one occasion as you realize, I do that, or I’ve experienced that. Humans are a strange animal indeed, and these are truly some of our strangest times.\" Kasten's play, The Perfect Step, had a five-performance run at the Fringe of Marin in November 2011. The play featured songs by the musical group Random Love. In 2012, two of his songs were featured in Not Quite Opera, a production at the Alcove Theatre in San Francisco. His play Supplementing had a five-performance run at the Fringe of Marin festival in November 2012. Kasten is at work on The Selling of the Next War, a book setting forth logical arguments for optimism about world peace."

  "text" : "Gage Daye (born June 11, 1989) is an American basketball guard who last played for the Fort Wayne Mad Ants of the NBA Development League. Daye played college basketball at Bloomfield College. As a senior in the 2010 season he averaged 24.1 ppg. and led the Deacons to their first ever Elite Eight appearance. Daye did not make the NBA and signed with the Fort Wayne Mad Ants of the NBA Development League. In the 2011-2012 NBA Development League season he averages 9.3 ppg and 2.7 rpg. Daye was waived by the Mad Ants on December 20, 2011. On August 23, 2012 the Sheffield Sharks, of the British Basketball League (BBL), confirmed they had signed Daye ahead of the 2012/2013 season. Gage Daye averaged 17 points, 7 rebounds, and 5 assist in England's BBL for the Sheffield Sharks. On January 17, 2014, former Bloomfield College men's basketball guard Gage Daye '12 signed a contract to play for the Wagga Heat Basketball Association of Australia's Waratah State League for the upcoming 2014 season, Deacons head coach Gerald Holmes announced. \"Gage is without question one of the best players we have had during my time here, and he continues to be one of our hardest workers long after his playing days at Bloomfield concluded,\" Holmes said. \"The example he continues to set for the players in our program, especially as an assistant coach, speaks volumes about the type of person he has become. I have no doubt he will continue to be successful whenever he gets the opportunity to play at the professional level.\" One of the premier players in program history, Daye became the school's all-time leading scorer during his senior season, surpassing Andre Dabney's career mark and amassing 2,518 career points. A first team All-America selection by Daktronics, Basketball Times Magazine and the Division II Bulletin as a senior, the two-time CACC Player of the Year led Bloomfield to its first CACC Tournament championship since 2006 during his senior campaign in 2010-2011, and to the first NCAA Tournament Elite Eight in program history. His incredible play in the postseason saw the 6'2 sharpshooter earn CACC Tournament and East Regional Tournament MVP honors. During his brilliant career, Daye also earned Daktronics East Region Player of the Year honors, and well as an All-Met Player of the year selection. The season will mark Daye's third campaign in the professional ranks, after stints with the NBA Developmental League's Fort Wayne Mad Ants in 2011 and the British Basketball League's Sheffield Sharks in 2012. After averaging just over nine points per game during his stint with the Mad Ants, he posted averages 17.2 points, 6.7 rebounds and four assists per contest during his lone season in Sheffield. The Newark, New Jersey native continues to make an impact at his alma mater, as well as within his community. An assistant coach at Bloomfield for two seasons and a donor to the school's athletic department, Daye also organizes youth basketball skills camps in the surrounding area while pursuing his master's degree in Athletic Administration. \"I am truly blessed to be receiving this opportunity, and for everything that I have been able to do during my time at Bloomfield College,\" he said. \"This is truly a special place, which is why I felt it was so important for me to start giving back with more than just my involvement in the basketball program. Bloomfield has helped me to reach my potential, and continue to strive for more.\""

  "text" : "Gottlieb (Théophile) Gluge (June 18, 1812, Brakel, Germany – December 22, 1898, Nice, France) pioneer medical researcher and personal physician to the King of the Belgians. He studied medicine at the Berlin University, receiving his M.D. in 1835. Two years before his graduation he wrote Die Influenza oder Grippe, nach den Quellen Historisch-Pathologisch Dargestellt (Minden, 1837), receiving for this essay a prize from the faculty of his alma mater. He had the distinction of being the first physician to describe influenza. After finishing his studies, Gluge went to Paris in 1836 to take a postgraduate course. In 1838, upon the recommendation of Alexander von Humboldt and of Arago, he was appointed professor of physiology at the Free University of Brussels, and he held this position until 1873, being also for many years physician to the King of Belgium. In 1846 he became a naturalized Belgian citizen, and after resigning his professorship in 1873 he resided at Brussels, though he spent much time in traveling. He was a member of the Royal Academies for Science and the Arts of Belgium, which till this day give a biannual prize in his honor, in the field of physiology. Gluge was one of the first physicians who examined microscopically the diseased tissues of the body, in this way seeking to gain knowledge of the primary causes of maladies, and thus to ascertain the correct course of treatment. He discovered a curious parasite in the stickleback, to which the name Glugea microspora has been given. He contributed to the leading medical journals of Germany, France, and Belgium. Among notable works are the following: Anatomisch-Mikroskopische Untersuchungen zur Allgemeinen und Speziellen. Pathologle, vol. i., Minden and Leipsic, 1839; vol. ii., Jena, 1841; Abhandlungen zur Physiologie und Pathologie, Jena, 1841; Atlas der Pathologischen Anatomie, Jena, 1843 to 1850; La Nutrition, ou la Vie Considérée dans Ses Rapports avec les Aliments, Brussels, 1856; Abcès de la Rate et Sa Guérison, ib. 1870. Gluge also authored the volumes dealing with physiology in the Encyclopédie populaire which aired in Belgium in the 1850s."

This drew a harsh rebuke from G. K. Chesterton, who criticized Lee for imagining that the war then underway could be ended by mere discussion and for treating the warring forces as if they were on equal moral footing. Lee and his wife Jennette and daughter Geraldine summered on Monhegan Island, Maine, for over 30 years. He published a ten-cent magazine, Mount Tom, in Northampton, Massachusetts. A collection of his writings from this period is in the book Thoughts from a Driftwood Desk by P. Kent Royka."

Lowrey (September 25, 1831 - April 21, 1893) was a 19th-century American corporate attorney who served as consul to numerous powerful interests such as Thomas Edison, Western Union, Wells Fargo and The New York Metropolitan Railway Company. After graduating from Lafayette College in 1854 Lowrey was admitted to the bar he became the personal secretary to his former teacher Andrew Horatio Reeder, the first Governor of the Kansas Territory. Lowery aligned himself with the abolitionist Free-Stater wing of the Kansas Territory government, but was forced to return east when the Border Ruffian elements gained control of the legislature. Lowrey later worked for the Fremont Campaign of 1856 and during the Civil War wrote pamphlets defending President Abraham Lincoln’s expanded war powers while doing legal work for the Treasury Department. After the war he worked for various clients, being employed as general counsel for Western Union for 15 years, while being hired on the side for numerous merges and consolations in the period. However his most famous work was defending Edison’s quadruplex telegraph and incandescent light bulb patents. Lowrey was also instrumental in the formation of the Edison Electric Light Company, and convinced J.P. Morgan to back it. He died on April 21, 1893 in New York at his Madison Avenue home from complications of gout."

Of these, he is best known for his portraits. He was born in Stuttgart. He studied from 1795 to 1797 at the Hohe Karlsschule under Philipp Friedrich von Hetsch, a follower of Jacques-Louis David. In 1797–98 he studied under Johann Heinrich von Dannecker, then relocated to Paris where he spent 1799 to 1802 in the studio of David. Between 1802 and 1811 he stayed in Rome, and became an important figure in that city's artistic life. In Schick's last years, his style of Raphaelesque classicism gradually acquired a romantic orientation. \n* Frau von Cotta, 1802 \n* Frederik IV van Saksen-Gotha-Altenburg, 1806"

  "text" : "George Clifton \"Clif\" Thompson (August 8, 1913 – June 3, 2008) was a president of the International Curling Federation. Born in Brandon, Manitoba, he started curling when he was fifteen. Thompson was President of the Kapuskasing Curling Club, a member of the Northern Ontario School committee and chairman of School Boys Curling Committee (now Junior curling). As a vice-president of the Canadian Curling Association he was involved in finding a new sponsor for the Brier and new formats for television coverage of curling events. As president of the Canadian Curling Association, Thompson took part in relocating its headquarters from Winnipeg to Ottawa and helped to establish scholarships for young curlers. Thompson was a life member of the Canadian Curling Association, a member of the Governor General’s Curling Club, a recipient of the Canadian Curling Hall of Fame’s Builder’s Award and recipient of a 1982 Ontario Special Achievement Award for “Major Contribution to Amateur Sport”. As President of the International Curling Federation for three years, he was instrumental in increasing ladies’ involvement, and in changing fee structure for television rights and future hosts of upcoming events. He presented to the World’s Olympic Organization and the 1988 Olympic committee to admit curling as a demonstration sport in the Calgary Olympics. Thompson moved to Stroud in 1979 and in 1980 along with Floyd Bean made a presentation to the Stroud Curling Club Board to request ice time for fourteen interested senior curlers. This number was not considered sufficient to warrant ice time but in April 1981, permission was given to create a league for senior curlers using the sheets of ice not needed by the Thursday Morning Ladies’ League. In 1986 there were enough curlers, fifty-five years and older to fill three sheets of ice. Ten years later the draws were full and the committee was forced to adopt a two-draw format. The league used and continues to use the jitney format for forming teams. The league’s philosophy encouraged the recreational value of the sport of curling, and the development of curling skills while helping one another enjoy the game itself. The mini-spiel format was introduced, allowing players from both draws to compete in two four end games. Thompson promoted all aspect of curling; the skills, the rules, and the etiquette as well as the camaraderie. Thompson and his wife, Helen, operated a curling clinic to assist curlers of all levels become more confident in their abilities. Thompson was a club director for three years and acted as Honorary Chairman of the Masters and Colts Provincial Competition hosted by the Stroud Curling Club in 1995. In 1997 the Senior League at the Stroud Curling club officially became the ‘Clif Thompson Senior Curlers’ League. Thompson died in 2008; a permanent tribute to him is located on the Stroud Curling Club wall."

After completing his studies, he became and advisor and treasurer to Emperor Charles V and fought in the Battle of Pavia. His post required that he provide horses and knights to Duke Louis X of Bavaria and to the Emperor to fight the war against the Ottoman Empire. He borrowed the knights and horses, as well as 14000guilders from Elector Palatine Otto Henry. In 1546, George III and Elector Palatine Frederick III signed the Treaty of Heidelberg, which defined the boundary between Leuchtenberg and the Palatinate and the privileges of Leuchtenberg. George's brother, Christopher of Leuchtenberg (d. 1554) commanded the cavalry in the army of Albert II Alcibiades. Christopher and Albert took several loans from George and the latter was cited before the Reichskammergericht for breach of the peace. He had to temporarily hand over the Lordship of Grünsfeld and compensate the victims of the looting and pillaging. His brother Christopher died impoverished in a guest house in Regensburg. His second brother Hans was mentally ill and lived most of his life with their sister in Wallerstein."

  "text" : "Sir George Kettilby Rickards (24 January 1812 – 23 September 1889), was a political economist in England. Rickards was born in London in 1812, and was the eldest son of George Rickards of Ripley, Surrey, by Frances, daughter of the Rev. Samuel Kettilby, D.D. On 10 July 1823 he was admitted at Westminster School, but left in 1824 for Eton. He matriculated from Balliol College, Oxford, on 6 April 1829, but was elected scholar of Trinity in the same year. He obtained the Newdigate Prize in 1830 with a poem on the ‘African Desert,’ graduated B.A. in 1833, taking a second-class in classics, and proceeded M.A. in 1836. From 1836 to 1843 he was a fellow of Queen's College. In 1837 he was called to the bar of the Inner Temple, and in 1873 was elected a bencher. In 1851 he was appointed counsel to the speaker of the House of Commons, and was made K.C.B. on resigning that post in 1882. Rickards was a member of the Canterbury Association from 11 April 1848, and he joined the management committee in 1851. In 1849, the chief surveyor of the Canterbury Association, Joseph Thomas, named Mount Richards in New Zealand after him. He was elected Drummond Professor of Political Economy at Oxford in 1851, and he held the chair until 1857. He made little mark in a professorial capacity, but published three general lectures on his subject in a volume in 1852, and a course on population and labour in 1854. For the last seven years of his life he resided at Fyfield House, Oxford. He died suddenly at Hawkley Hurst, Hampshire, on 23 September 1889. He was twice married: first, in 1842, to Frances Phoebe, daughter of the Rev. John Henry George Lefroy of Ewshott House, Hampshire, who died in 1859; and, secondly, in 1861, to Julia Cassandra (d. 1884), daughter of the Rev. Benjamin Lefroy, rector of Ashe, Hampshire. Rickards was the author of: 1.  \n* ‘Remarks on the Laws relating to Attempts against the Person of the Sovereign,’ London, 1842, 8vo. 2.  \n* ‘The Financial Policy of War,’ London, 1855, 8vo. 3.  \n* ‘The House of Commons, its Struggles and Triumphs: a Lecture,’ London, 1856, 8vo. He translated into blank verse Virgil's ‘Æneid,’ bks. i.–vi. (1871), and bk. xi. (1872); contributed an essay on ‘Church Finance’ to Halcombe's ‘The Church and her Curates,’ London, 1874, 8vo; and assisted to edit the ‘Statutes at Large’ in 1857 and following years."

  "text" : "George Edwards Brown (1780–1848) was an English-born Chilean businessman. George Edwards was the son of a carpenter John Edwards and his wife Elizabeth Brown, as stated in his baptism certificate in the parish of Saint Leonard's of London. George “Jorge” Edwards Brown was an English sailor who later lived and served in Chile. He was the founder and patriarch of the Edwards family in Chile. He sailed from a young age in British ships engaged in trade and privateering or looting. He travelled across Spanish South America visiting Chile for the first time in 1797. It was not until 1804 that his name could be inscribed in the history of Chile. The previous year he had enlisted as a surgeon in the British raider “Blackhouse” or “Bacar” who were dedicated to looting and plundering ships and ports in the Spanish colonies in South America. During this trip, Bacar anchored in the bay of Coquimbo and then taken by assault the city which was unguarded. During the sack of the city Jorge Edwards entered the house of Diego de Ossandón to steal, but he found his daughter, Isabel de Ossandón, who he fell in love with immediately. He decided to desert the ship and asking for shelter in the house of Diego Ossandón. Family tradition says that when Edwards did not return to the British ship, they spent three days looking for him through all the houses in the city. Edwards hid for three days, hiding in a barrel of wine from his former shipmates. On the third day Spanish reinforcements arrived, forcing the British to retreat from the city, to continue their raids to the north. Once the Spanish authorities were aware of the presence of Edwards in La Serena, he was arrested and sent to Callao, where he was detained. Once released he returned to La Serena in 1805 he was baptized into the Catholic faith. The baptism certificate recognizes that parents are Juan Eduardos (John Edwards) and Isabel Pardo (Elizabeth Brown), Spanish forms of their Welsh and English names respectively. After that he went to work as a doctor and surgeon for some years, but quickly became the enabler or lender of small miners in the area of Coquimbo, which allowed him to build a small fortune after 10 years. His distinctly anti-Spanish feelings made him a supporter of the patriot cause during the Chilean Wars of Independence, making donations to build the fleet for the liberation of Peru, commanded by a fellow Brit, Lord Thomas Cochrane. The Supreme Director of Chile, Bernardo O'Higgins granted Edwards Chilean citizenship papers in 1818 as a reward for his services to the Independence cause. He was appointed Deputy for Huasco in 1822. He was President of the Provincial Assembly of Coquimbo in 1825, Deputy for Andacollo in 1826 and Deputy of Vallenar in 1834. Jorge Edwards married his first wife Isabel Ossandón Iribarren in 1807, with which he had 8 children, including Agustín Edwards Ossandón. Widowed in 1834, he married his second wife Ventura Argandoña Subercaseaux, with whom he had children."

The Picture Puffin book won the Children's Book of the Year Award: Eve Pownall Award for Information Books in Australia in 1997. Gordon worked for Penguin Books and Random House and was the publishing director of children's and adult illustrated books, publishing Australia Through Time, Botanica, and many others. In August 1999, Gordon Cheers and Margaret Olds set up Global Book Publishing. Their first two titles, Anatomica and The Global Encyclopedia of Wine, appeared in 2000. Anatomica, with 912 pages, is likely the most comprehensive, illustrated body atlas since Gray’s Anatomy. Wine gives extensive coverage of the world’s wine regions. In 2003, Gordon published, amongst others, Flora (1584 pages), which covers 20,000 plants and includes 12,000 color images. It is the largest illustrated single volume plant encyclopedia ever published. In 2005, with Margaret Olds, he established Millennium House to publish illustrated non-fiction books for both the Australian and the international market. Their titles include Astronomica, Historica, Geologica, Natural Health, Earth Concise, Earth Blue and the Earth Platinum. Millennium House was awarded Best Overall Atlas Award in June 2010, by the International Map Trade Association, giving Millennium House this award for the third year in row."

  "text" : "Giuseppe Ferrandino (born 24 January 1958 on the island of Ischia, Italy) is an Italian comic book author and novelist. Ferrandino studied Medicine at the University of Naples without completing his degree, but following instead his passion of working as a comic strip scriptwriter.At the end of the seventies, he produced a series of renowned scripts, for publications such as Nero, Lanciostory, Dylan Dog, and Mickey Mouse, reaching the peak of his scriptwriting popularity in the 1980s. In 1993, his novel Pericle il nero (Pericles the Black Man) was published by Granata Press, hardly noticed by the Italian readership. However, after being translated into French by Gallimard, the novel was republished in 1998 in Italy by Adelphi Edizioni, with great success. The story is constructed as an American noir, with a realistic Neapolitan dialect and strong characters, often verging on the grotesque as represented by the pulp literary genre. In 1999, his second novel, Il rispetto, ovvero Pino Pentecoste contro i guappi (Respect, or Pino Pentecoste against the Blabbermouths), was published by Adelphi, followed by the fairy tale Lidia e i turchi (Lydia and the Turks) published by Mondadori. Other successful novels have been published by Ferrandino, among which Spada (Sword) (2007), a reprise of Dumas' Three Musketeers. In 2007 American director Abel Ferrara produced the film version of Ferrandino's 1st novel, with Italian actor Riccardo Scamarcio in the starring role. Ferrandino lives in Rome, although he often spends lengthy periods in Chicago."

  "text" : "Violinist Gerard Jirayr Svazlian was born in Alexandria, Egypt to Armenian parents. After the Second World War, his family moved to the Soviet Republic of Armenia, where his father died at age 44. Since his father was an artistic personality, it was his dream to see three of his five children become musicians. Svazlian’s mother chose the violin for Gerard, the cello for his brother, and the piano for his sister; his two oldest sisters became scholars. Gerard started violin at the age of seven and continued his studies at the prestigious Romanos Melikian Music Institute and Komitas Conservatory. During his school years he taught violin and played in the Yerevan State Opera Orchestra. With his brother and sister, he formed a trio and concertized in the former Soviet Republics, Eastern Europe, and the United States. Mr. Svazlian arrived in New York in 1975, where he played in various orchestras, including the Metropolitan Opera Orchestra. In 1978 he moved to San Francisco where he began a very intense and fruitful career. The same year he married Anahit; he and his wife have two children: Monique and Rosy Svazlian. Gerard joined the San Francisco Opera, Ballet, Symphony and Chamber Orchestras while teaching at the San Francisco Conservatory of Music. He has been a tenured member of the San Francisco Opera Orchestra since 1981. Svazlian served as President of the San Francisco Music Teachers’ Association from 1992 - 2002. He was granted the Certificate of Honor by Mayor Willie Brown and an award for Dedicated Leadership from the Music Teachers Association of California, San Francisco. Gerard led the effort to stage the world premiere of the first Armenian classical opera Arsaces II (Arshak II), raising one million dollars from the Armenian community for the 2001 performances."

  "text" : "Giuseppe Anatrelli (January 3, 1925 - November 29, 1981), also known as Geppino Anatrelli, was an Italian film, stage and television actor. Born in Naples, he was part of the Eduardo De Filippo theatrical company between 1953 and 1959. Later he starred again with De Filippo in the 1963 television series Peppino Girella, and rejoined his company in the early 1970s. His film works span different genres, but he's probably best known for his portrait of \"Geometra Luciano Calboni\" in the first three chapters of the Fantozzi film series."

During the early years, the unions were able to control wages and working hours.

These studies led to the publication of a monograph on the subject of the financial relations between State and religious groups in Netherlands.In those years he also carried out intensive didactic activities and a great trade union commitment which led him at the end of the eighties to fill for 8 years the post of SNUR-CGIL's General Secretary for the district of Florence.In 1989 Giovanni Cimbalo applied for the competitive examination for the post of associate professor that took place in 1993. After one year from his passing the examination he was called in the Faculty of Law of Bologna University. From this moment on he took up again with great energy the didactic and the research activities witnessed by a number of publications.Once confirmed as Associate Professor he applied for the competitive examination (on the basis of comparative merits) for the post of Full Professor and emerged fit.

His father was the music director of the local Methodist church, and George sang with the choir and learned to play the organ there. His first compositions included organ music and hymns. He also played the baritone horn in the town band, and eventually became the conductor. He composed his first march at age 17, and was soon turning out as many as 8 new marches each year. As interest in his music declined, he would sell new arrangements for as little as 50 cents, or give compositions away outright. In later life, he composed many works for the Grampian Band in nearby Grampian, Pennsylvania, his favorite group, including the \"Grampian March\". He missed a 1948 tribute by the Navy Band because he didn't believe he had any suitable clothes. He died in poverty in Penfield on August 18, 1955. Nevertheless, his music was well-thought-of. His march \"Triumphant Battalions\" was played at the liberation of Paris and his dirge \"Immortal Heroes\" was played at the funerals of Franklin Roosevelt and Winston Churchill."

  "text" : "Ginetta Sagan (June 1, 1925 – August 25, 2000) was an Italian-born American human rights activist best known for her work with Amnesty International on behalf of prisoners of conscience. Born in Milan, Italy, Sagan lost her parents in her teenage years to the Black Brigades of Benito Mussolini. Like her parents, she was active in the Italian resistance movement, gathering intelligence and supplying Jews in hiding. She was captured and tortured in 1945, but escaped on the eve of her execution with the help of Nazi defectors. After studying in Paris, she attended graduate school in child development in the US and married Leonard Sagan, a physician. The couple then resettled in Atherton, California, where Sagan founded the first chapter of Amnesty International in the western US. She later toured the region, helping to establish more than 75 chapters, and organized events to raise money for political prisoners. In 1984, Sagan was elected the honorary chair of Amnesty International USA. US President Bill Clinton awarded her the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1996, and Italy later awarded her the rank of Grand Ufficiale Ordine al Merito della Repubblica Italiana (Grand Official Order of Merit of the Italian Republic). Amnesty International founded an annual Ginetta Sagan Award for activists in her honor."

She worked with, among others, Pasquale Festa Campanile, Massimo Franciosa, Mario Camerini, Luigi Comencini and especially Alessandro Blasetti, who provided her some important roles, including the leading role in the 1967 commedia all'italiana La ragazza del bersagliere, for which she shared a David di Donatello for Best Actress with Silvana Mangano. To horror movie fans, she will always be remembered as the beautiful victim of a vampire in the 1962 film Slaughter of the Vampires. Despite this, however, she failed to launch her career, and after some western-spaghetti and poliziotteschi Granata, at the beginning of the seventies, dedicated herself to the theater and shortly after retired from showbiz."

  "text" : "George McCullagh Reed (1831 – 13 November 1898) was a New Zealand presbyterian minister, journalist and newspaper proprietor. Reed was born in County Monaghan, Ireland in about 1831. He received his education from Queen's College, Belfast, from where he graduated in 1856. He was ordained as a Presbyterian minister and went to France, Switzerland, and in 1857 to Victoria in Australia. From 1861, he was minister in Ipswich, Queensland, and it was there that he married Jessie Chalmers Ranken on 6 July 1863. He resigned from the ministry in 1866. Reed was elected to the second Legislative Assembly of Queensland for the district of Ipswich in a ministerial by-election on 4 August 1866 and held this seat until the end of the parliamentary term on 19 June 1867. He set up, bought, or edited many newspapers. He set up the Evening Star in Auckland in 1870. While living in Auckland, he was elected to the Auckland Provincial Council for the Takapuna electorate, and he served from 21 November 1873 until the abolition of provincial government on 31 October 1876. He served on the executive council (10 December 1873 – 13 November 1874) and was provincial treasurer until his resignation from that post. In 1876, he established the Evening News in Dunedin. Some months later, he purchased a morning newspaper in Dunedin, the Otago Guardian, together with George Fenwick. The city could not sustain two morning papers and Fenwick and Reed bought their rival, the Otago Daily Times and its weekly, the Otago Guardian. After time in Ireland as New Zealand's immigration agent, he was leader writer for The Argus in Melbourne before joining The New Zealand Herald in 1883. He moved to the United Kingdom as the Herald's correspondent, and there he set up the Australian Times and Anglo-New-Zealander together with Robert Reid. Reed returned to Auckland and became editor of the Auckland Evening Bell. In 1889, he was editor of the Evening Standard in Melbourne. In the following year, he was editor for The Sydney Morning Herald. By 1895, he had returned to Auckland and rejoined The New Zealand Herald. Reed died in Auckland of a heart attack on 13 November 1898. He was survived by three sons, including Vernon Reed and John Reed, and two daughters. He was buried in the Presbyterian section of the Symonds Street Cemetery."

He served for several years as assistant brigade commander in the navy based in Huangyan. In 1839, he was appointed as garrison commander of Zhenhai of Zhejiang. In September 1841, the British army attacked Zhenhai. Ge participated in the defense of Xiaofeng Mountain (晓峰) and Zhushan Gate (竹山门). He led the troop to fight in the rain for several days but the British army eventually seized the Zhushan Gate. Ge and over 200 soldiers continued fighting with swords. After being wounded over 40 times, he died of a major wound through the chest. His corpse was carried to Zhenhai by a villager named Xu Bao in the night. The Daoguang Emperor wept after he learned Ge’s death and gave him the pension as the level for a provincial commander-in-chief. Ge was buried north to Huangwan Temple, in the Sanquanwang Village of Xiaoshan County."

  "text" : "Gaganchandra Dam (Bengali: গগনচন্দ্র দাম; 1845? – 1910? ), mostly known as Gagan Harkara (Bengali: গগন হরকরা) was a Bengali Baul poet after the tune of whose \"famous\" song \"Ami Kothay Pabo Tare\"(কোথায় পাবো তারে) Rabindranath Tagore composed Amar Shonar Bangla, the national anthem of Bangladesh. He resided at Kasba village in Kumarkhali Upazilla in Kushtia. As he was a Postman at Shelaidaha Post office in Kumarkhali, people used to address him as \"Harkara\"; in Bengali, \"Harkara\" stands for \"postman\". He was used to delivering and collecting letters from Rabindranath Tagore during his (Tagore's) days in Shelaidaha. Tagore wrote over him many times in his letters, accumulated in Chinnapatra to Indira Devi. Where shall I meet him, the Man of my Heart?He is lost to me and I seek him wandering from land to land.I am listless for that moonrise of beauty,which is to light my life,which I long to see in the fullness of visionin gladness of heart. “”— \"Ami Kothay Pabo Tare\", Gagan Harkara It was Tagore who first published Harkara's song in his Prabashi Patra (a magazine) in 1322 BS. Tagore's niece Sarala Devi published also an essay entitled Lalon Fakir and Gagan in Bharati, a mouthpiece of Tagore Family. This essay included two songs of Gagan – Ami Kothai Pabo Tare and (O Mon) Asar Mayai Vule Robe. Balendranath Tagore collected the songs of Gagan in 1889. Rabindranath Tagore referred to Gagan and his songs in his article: An Indian Folk Religion, songs and speeches. Rabindranath Tagore wrote a short story too (The Postmaster) partly after his life. Based upon the story, Satyajit Ray made his film: The Postmaster. Tagore mentioned the following about Gagan. In the same village I came into touch with some Baul singers. I had known them by their names, occasionally seen them singing and begging in the street, and so passed them by, vaguely classifying them in my mind under the general name of Vairagis, or ascetics. The time came when I had occasion to meet with some members of the same body and talk to them about spiritual matters. The first Baul song, which I chanced to hear with any attention, profoundly stirred my mind. Its words are so simple that it makes me hesitate to render them in a foreign tongue, and set them forward for critical observation. Besides, the best part of a song is missed when the tune is absent; for thereby its movement and its colour are lost, and it becomes like a butterfly whose wings have been plucked. The first line may be translated thus: 'Where shall I meet him, the Man of my Heart?' This phrase, 'the Man of my Heart,' is not peculiar to this song, but is usual with the Baul sect. It means that, for me, the supreme truth of all existence is in the revelation of the Infinite in my own humanity. 'The Man of my Heart,' to the Baul, is like a divine instrument perfectly tuned. He gives expression to infinite truth in the music of life. And the longing for the truth which is in us, which we have not yet realised, breaks out in the following Baul song: Where shall I meet him, the Man of my Heart?He is lost to me and I seek him wandering from land to land.I am listless for that moonrise of beauty,which is to light my life,which I long to see in the fulness of vision, in gladness of heart. The name of the poet who wrote this song was Gagan. He was almost illiterate; and the ideas he received from his Baul teacher found no distraction from the self-consciousness of the modern age. He was a village postman, earning about ten shillings a month, and he died before he had completed his teens. The sentiment, to which he gave such intensity of expression, is common to most of the songs of his sect. And it is a sect, almost exclusively confined to that lower floor of society, where the light of modern education hardly finds an entrance, while wealth and respectability shun its utter indigence. In the song I have translated above, the longing of the singer to realize the infinite in his own personality is expressed. This has to be done daily by its perfect expression in life, in love. For the personal expression of life, in its perfection, is love; just as the personal expression of truth in its perfection is beauty."

He initially taught history at Loyola University Maryland until he joined Georgetown University as vice president in 1963. Father Campbell held the post of executive vice president at Georgetown at the time of his appointment as President in 1964. Campbell, who was 45 years old when he became president, was one of the youngest presidents in Georgetown's history. He was also the first President of Georgetown University to hold a doctorate from a non-Catholic university, as he had received a PhD from Princeton in 1957. Campbell's Princeton degree led the Washington Post to conclude at the time that he was a \"new breed of Jesuit priest whose style might be described as Ivy League Catholic.\" During his tenure, Campbell created the university’s first Senate and reconstituted the Board of Directors, including lay as well as ecclesiastical members. He also presided over the establishment of Georgetown’s first endowed chair in Pharmacology. He has been credited with spearheading new student community service initiatives by Georgetown students throughout the District of Columbia. On Jan. 31, 1965, Father Campbell served as the homilist for the Red Mass attended by President Lyndon Baines Johnson, Lady Bird Johnson, presidential aid Jack J. Valenti, as well as Associate Supreme Court Justice William J. Brennan and Speaker of the House John W. McCormack. Campbell began a fundraising drive to raise $26 million beginning in 1966. The campaign money was needed to fund fellowships, scholarships, pay salaries, and build the new Georgetown University Law Center. However, the drive raised just $15 million by 1968. Campbell resigned in 1968 as heightened protests during the Vietnam War and a $1.5 million deficit in the university budget challenged Georgetown’s management team. He intended to spend more time on his research and teaching schedule. After stepping down from Georgetown, Campbell worked for the Maryland Province of the Society of Jesus and then became the rector of the Jesuit novitiate in Wernersville, Pennsylvania. He returned to Washington D.C. in 1979, where he served as the director of the Woodstock Theological Center for four years. He then became the founding director of the Holy Trinity Catholic Church's new Jesuit spirituality center, a post he held until his retirement in 2004. Father Gerald Campbell died from congestive heart failure at the Jesuit residence on the campus of Georgetown University on August 9, 2012, at the age of 92."

  "text" : "George Francis Lundy, S.J., (January 26, 1947 – December 20, 2011) was an American Jesuit, academic, and university administrator. He served as the President of Wheeling Jesuit University in West Virginia from 2000 to 2003. Much of Lundy's work in activism and academia centered on issues concerning social justice. Lundy was originally from Chicago, Illinois. He first joined the Society of Jesus, also known as the Jesuits, when at the age of 19. He received his bachelor's degree in sociology from Loyola University New Orleans and his master's degree from the Jesuit School of Theology. He also obtained a doctorate from the University of Chicago. Lundy joined the faculty of Loyola University New Orleans. He served as the director of the university's Institute for Human Understanding, which is now called the Twomey Center for Peace Through Justice, during the early 1980s. The center studies and works with social issues, notably justice, racism, workers' rights, and poverty. Lundy also joined Loyola's faculty, teaching courses in labor studies through the institute. Additionally, Lundy established his own school through Loyola, which taught labor leaders how to effectively organize and maintain a labor union. As part of the school, Lundy created and implemented a labor plan for a company, based in Germany, written in both German and English. During his tenure at Loyola, Lundy co-created a religious coalition in opposition to the death penalty with Sister Helen Prejean and Rev. Joe Morris Doss, the then Episcopal pastor of the Grace Episcopal Church in New Orleans and future Bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of New Jersey. In 1986, Loyola New Orleans President James C. Carter, S.J. appointed Lundy as the university's provost and vice president for academic affairs. Lundy had been serving as the director of the Institute for Human Relations at the time of his appointment. He worked as provost from 1986 to 1992. Lundy became the Vice President of University of Detroit Mercy, a Jesuit institution in Michigan, in 2000. Lundy was appointed the President of Wheeling Jesuit University in 2000, where he served for three years. Following his departure from Wheeling Jesuit, Lundy was sent to Southern University in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, where he served as the pastor for the university's Catholic Student Center. In 2011, Lundy returned to Loyola New Orleans, where he directed a Twomey Center for Peace Through Justice campaign to end the death penalty by gaining the support of medical professionals. Father George Lundy died of complications of a stroke at Tulane Medical Center in New Orleans on December 20, 2011, at the age of 64. He was survived by his mother, Mary Lundy, and three sisters - Noreen Osterlein, Barbara Lundy, and Mary Semela. He was buried at St. Charles College in Grand Coteau, Louisiana."

  "text" : "George Gatonby Stead (1841–1908) was a notable New Zealand grain merchant, racehorse owner and breeder, businessman. He was born in London, England in 1841. His main interest were race horses, and he was honorary secretary of the Canterbury Jockey Club from 1873 for over 30 years. In 1877, he promoted the idea of having the Riccarton Racecourse Siding built to make the horse racing ground more accessible, and to increase turnover. The line opened in November 1877. He stood for Parliament in the Avon electorate in the 1890 election and was defeated by the incumbent, Edwin Blake. It was the only time that Stead stood for Parliament. The ornithologist Edgar Stead was his son. Alfred Lee Smith was a business partner in Dunedin and had a stake in the grain merchant firm Royse, Stead and Co."

In 1984, on the advice of his attorney Robert Simone, Martorano pleaded guilty to 19 counts of drug possession and distribution. Martorano was subsequently advised by both the prosecution and the judge, John Berne Hannum, that this plea could result in a sentence of life without the possibility of parole. The prosecution, however, had only recommended a sentence of from 40 to 54 months. On September 20, 1984, Martorano was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole, the longest prison term ever imposed on a first-time non-violent offender in American history."

  "text" : "Georges Ville (23 March 1824 – 22 February 1897) was a French agronomist and plant physiologist born in Pont-Saint-Esprit. In 1843 he started his career as an interne in pharmacy. From 1857 to 1897 he held the chair of Physique végétale at the Muséum national d'histoire naturelle in Paris. He is known for his research involving the absorption of nitrogen by plants. In 1849-1852 he carried out experiments on nitrogen absorption from the air by plants that reasserted 18th century theories espoused by Joseph Priestley and Jan Ingenhousz, stating that plants were capable of absorbing free nitrogen, a claim that was later opposed by Nicolas-Théodore de Saussure in 1804 and backed up by the experiments of Jean Senebier (1742-1809). The subject garnered enough interest in the scientific community that the French Academy of Sciences formed a committee to investigate Ville's work, resulting in a confirmation of his experiments on the matter. He performed extensive pioneer studies on chemical fertilizers, largely carried out on his \"experimental farm\" (Ferme Georges-Ville) that was founded in 1860 at Vincennes."

The 1881 election in the newly formed Tauranga electorate was hotly contested. Four candidates were nominated: George Morris, who had previously represented the East Coast electorate; Stewart, then the owner of the Bay of Plenty Times; William Kelly, who had also previously represented the East Coast electorate; and Henry Thomas Rowe, a surveyor and commission agent. Rowe announced his retirement from the contest on 6 December three days out from election day, urging his supporters to vote for Stewart instead. The unofficial results were released the day after the election (on Saturday, 10 December) and Morris had a majority of 13 votes over Stewart, with the official declaration to be made on 12 December. This was deferred until 14 December, with Morris ahead by 10 votes. Stewart stood for the Tauranga mayoralty a few months later and was elected the town's first mayor. Stewart stood in the 1893 election in the Bay of Plenty electorate and came a distant fourth. His brother's wife was Adela Blanche Stewart, who wrote the book My Simple Life in New Zealand."

  "text" : "Geoffrey Talbot (sometimes Geoffrey II Talbot, died around 1140) was a medieval Anglo-Norman nobleman during the civil war of King Stephen of England's reign. Talbot was the son of Geoffrey Talbot, who owned lands at Swanscombe in Kent. The younger Talbot's mother was Agnes, wife of the elder Talbot. Her ancestry is unclear, with David Crouch stating she was a member of the de Lacy family, and the Complete Peerage states she was probably the daughter of Walter de Lacy and Emma, and sister of Roger and Hugh de Lacy. Katharine Keats-Rohan, however, states that Agnes was probably the daughter of Helto Dapifer. The family was connected in some way with the de Lacy family, as the younger Geoffrey named Gilbert de Lacy as his relative. According to some historians, Agnes was Gilbert de Lacy's aunt, which if true would make de Lacy and Talbot first cousins. He was also a relative of Sybil, the wife of Pain fitzJohn, who was his heiress. He probably served as a household knight for Robert, the Earl of Gloucester. Talbot was present at the Easter court held by King Stephen at Westminster, along with a number of other nobles, magnates, and ecclesiastics. In April 1138, his force took the town of Hereford from the supporters of King Stephen, and held it for Stephen's rival and cousin, the Empress Matilda. This was part of a concerted rebellion by Matilda's supporters, many of whom were connected with Matilda's half-brother Robert. Talbot may have been the chief instigator of the rebellion. By mid-May, Stephen was besieging Talbot in Hereford Castle, a siege that lasted until mid-June, when the castle surrendered. Talbot escaped, and fled to the de Lacy castle at Weobley Castle, which also was besieged and surrendered. Again, Talbot escaped capture and fled to Bristol, where Matilda's supporters were gathering. Talbot and de Lacy then launched an attack on the town of Bath. While scouting, the two men were attacked by forces from the city, and Talbot was captured by forces under the control of the bishop of Bath, Robert of Lewes. The Empress' forces then arranged a parley with the bishop and offered him a safe conduct, but when the bishop showed up at the meeting, he was threatened with hanging unless Talbot was released. Talbot was released, but this event led to difficulties between the bishop and King Stephen, who accused the bishop of supporting Matilda, and was only with difficulty persuaded to accept the bishop's explanation. In October 1139, Talbot was once more in charge of Hereford and withstood an attack by Miles of Gloucester, a supporter of King Stephen. By 1140, he had lost control of the castle and was attempting to regain control of it. Part of his efforts included fortifying Hereford Cathedral. He was joined in his siege efforts by Miles of Gloucester. Talbot died in about 1140, and his lands passed to Sybil and her husband. He was buried in Gloucester Abbey. The lands at Swanscombe were divided between Talbot's two nieces, Cecily and Agnes, the daughters of Sybil and Pain fitzJohn. Cecily married first Roger of Hereford, son of Miles of Gloucester, and second William of Poitou and third Walter de Mayenne, but she had no children by any of her marriages and on her death in 1207, her lands passed to the heirs of her sister Agnes. Agnes married first Warin de Mountchesney and second Haldenald de Bidun, and her descendants held the barony of Swanscombe until 1324, when the line died out."

  "text" : "Sir George Stoddart Whitmore KCMG (30 May 1829 – 16 March 1903) was a notable New Zealand soldier, military leader, runholder and politician. Whitmore was born in Malta in 1829, the son of the late Major George St. V. Whitmore, R.E., and Isabella his wife, daughter of Sir J. Stoddart, Chief Justice of Malta. His grandfather, the late General Sir George Whitmore, K.C.H., was colonel-commandant Royal Engineers. G. S. Whitmore was educated at Edinburgh Academy and at the Staff College. Whitmore entered the army in 1847 as ensign in the Cape Mounted Rifles, and became lieutenant in May 1850, captain in July 1854, and brevet-major in June 1856. He served with distinction in the Kaffir wars of 1847 and 1851-3, in the Boer insurrection of 1848, and in the East with the Turkish contingent in 1855-6. He has the fourth class of the Medjidie and three medals. After exceptional services in the Crimea he went to New Zealand as military secretary to Sir Duncan Cameron in 1861. Resigning his position in the army in December 1862, Whitmore became a settler in the Hawke's Bay region. He was appointed to command the Hawke's Bay Militia in 1866, when he successfully led two hundred militia and volunteers at Omaranui, surrounded the gathering Hau Haus, who threatened destruction to the. settlement of Napier, and cut off or captured them almost to a man. In 1868 he conducted a campaign against the celebrated Te Kooti, who had just escaped from the Chatham Islands, and drove him and his followers into hiding. A month later he was placed in command of the West Coast force, which had met with some reverses, and had to be recruited and reorganised. For some considerable time Te Kooti kept the country in a state of alarm. His successes brought many wild spirits to his standard, and he placed his fortress at Ngatapa, a wooded mountain whose summit is about two thousand five hundred feet above the level of the sea. It was said to be the strongest fortified post in the North Island. The massacre at Poverty Bay compelled the Government to send Colonel Whitmore to reduce this stronghold. After a siege of five days the place was taken on 3 January 1869, and the enemy escaped with very severe loss. Returning to the West Coast, he led the colonial troops successfully from Kai Iwi to the Waitara, recovering all the country that had been abandoned and defeating Titokowaru's band in several engagements. Having completely pacified the West Coast, he was sent to put down the insurrection in the Urewera mountains, where Te Kooti had once more raised a body of followers. This duty had been scarcely accomplished when a change in the Ministry occurred. Mr. Fox defeated Mr. Stafford, and at once removed Colonel Whitmore from the command of the troops in the field, just at the moment when complete success appeared close at hand. Te Kooti, being unpursued, was able to recover from the effects of defeat; and it was consequently eighteen months afterwards before he was again reduced to the same straits. In October 1877 Colonel Whitmore joined Sir George Grey's Ministry as Colonial Secretary and Defence Minister, retiring in October 1879, with the rest of his colleagues. In 1870 he was created C.M.G., and in 1882 K.C.M.G. Whitmore was appointed to the New Zealand Legislative Council on 31 August 1863 and served until his death almost 40 years later. Sir George was a member of the short-lived Stout-Vogel Cabinet in August 1884, as a Minister without portfolio. The same combination coming back to power in September of the same year, he was appointed commandant of the colonial forces and commissioner of the armed constabulary, with the rank of major-general, conferred for the first time in New Zealand on an officer of the colonial forces. Sir George married in 1865 Isabella, daughter of the late William Smith, of Roxeth, near Rugby, England. On 16 March 1903 Whitmore died in Napier, New Zealand."

He was born on October 14, 1872 in Trieste to a Jewish family, Michele Levi and Emma Perugia. He was married to Lidia Tanzi and had five children: Gino, Mario, Alberto, Paola (who became the wife of Adriano Olivetti), and writer Natalia Ginzburg (wife of Leone Ginzburg and mother of Carlo Ginzburg), who described her father's personality in the successful Italian book Lessico famigliare (1963). Levi was a pioneer of in vitro studies of cultured cells. He contributed to the study of the nervous system, especially on the plasticity of sensory ganglion cells. While in Turin, he tutored three students who later won the Nobel prize: Salvador Luria, Renato Dulbecco and Rita Levi-Montalcini. He was admitted as a national member of the Accademia Nazionale dei Lincei in 1926."

He succeeded his father in the earldom in 1772 and was appointed Recorder of Ludlow and Lord Lieutenant of Montgomeryshire in 1776. Powis was commissioned a colonel to embody the Montgomeryshire Militia in 1778. In 1798 he was also made Lord Lieutenant of Shropshire; he was also appointed colonel of the Shropshire Militia in place of the Montgomeryshire. He retained both Lord-Lieutenancies until his death in 1801. Lord Powis made a Grand Tour in Italy in 1775-76, when he probably acquired a collection of marble sculpture preserved at his family seat, Powis Castle. He added a ballroom but did little to maintain the house, visitor John Byng in 1784 ascribing its neglected state to his time spent \"in the prodigalities of London and in driving high phaetons up St James's Street.\" At a later visit (1793) he wrote: \"The present (grandly-descended peer) is a mean silly man, the bubble of his mistress (and of his steward consequently) who rarely comes here, to sneak for about a day or two.\" Lord Powis died at the York House Hotel, Albemarle Street, London in January 1801, aged 45, and was buried at St Mary's Church, Welshpool. He was unmarried and the titles died with him. His sister and heiress, Lady Henrietta, married Edward Clive, 2nd Baron Clive, who was created Earl of Powis in 1804."

Lady Powis died in April 1929, aged 63, and was succeeded in the barony by her younger and only surviving son, Mervyn Herbert, Viscount Clive, who was killed while on active service in World War II in 1943 (his daughter and only child Davina inherited the barony). Lord Powis died in November 1952, aged 90, and was buried in the churchyard at Christ Church, Welshpool. He bequeathed his family seat, Powis Castle near Welshpool,to the National Trust.

Despite his initial plans to study history, a work-study job with the audiovisual equipment in the library made him interested in film production. Butler graduated in 1993 with a major in film, television and theater design. Afterwards he moved to California to work for Industrial Light and Magic for 9 months, where after intern work he managed to become an assistant in the effects department, starting with assistant credits in The Mask and Forrest Gump. Following a job at Rocket Science Games until the company's bankruptcy in 1996, Butler went to Tippett Studio and did effects work in Starship Troopers and My Favorite Martian, rising up to a technical director job, and Cinesite for Practical Magic. While reluctant at the requirement of moving to New Zealand, Butler was convinced by his writer-actor brother Jared to jump at the opportunity of working for Weta Digital in The Lord of the Rings. His biggest achievement was working in the creation of Gollum. Butler also worked as a computer graphics supervisor on I, Robot before an invitation to work as an effects supervisor for the Moving Picture Company, in London. He continues on MPC, but is now on the Vancouver office. On January 24, 2012, he was nominated for an Academy Award for Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2."

  "text" : "Eugene Hilburn \"Gene\" Methvin (September 19, 1934 – January 19, 2012) was an American pilot, journalist, and senior editor for the Reader's Digest Washington, D.C., bureau. A self-described \"shoe leather reporter,\" Methvin contributed more than 100 articles to Reader's Digest and its 48 editions, reaching more than 100 million readers worldwide. His articles covered topics ranging from the U.S. Supreme Court, civil liberties and constitutional law, to U.S. defense posture, Kremlin politics, U.S.-Soviet relations, organized crime and international terrorist groups. An article by Methvin in the January 1965 Reader's Digest, \"How the Reds Make a Riot,\" won the magazine the coveted award for public service in magazine journalism given annually by the Society for Professional Journalists. Methvin's work on communism, crime and corruption earned him not only the respect of his peers, but influence in government. His articles in Reader's Digest helped rally necessary support for legislation that would go on to become law and, in 1983, he was appointed by President Ronald Reagan to the President's Commission on Organized Crime. Methvin supervised the commission's investigation and hearing on labor-management racketeering. Marvin Wolfgang, past president and fellow of the American Society of Criminology, wrote of Methvin, \"No journalist or reporter knows more about criminology.\" Along with his work with Reader's Digest, Methvin also authored two books: The Riot Makers: The Technology of Social Demolition, 1970, and The Rise of Radicalism: The Social Psychology of Messianic Extremism, 1973. In 1995, the Washington, D.C. chapter of the Society of Professional Journalists named Methvin to its \"Hall of Fame\" for \"exemplary professional achievements, outstanding service to other members of the profession and lifelong dedication to the highest standards of journalism.\""

After the war, Dyrberg became a public administrator, holding several appointed positions in government, and later a public relations executive in banking. For more than 40 years, he also owned and operated a horse farm, breeding and training Icelandic horses in Høsterkøb, North Zealand. From 1994 to 2000, Dyrberg published his own writing: his novels and memoirs were based on his experiences in the Resistance. He was featured in the 2003 Danish documentary film, With a Right to Kill (Med ret til at dræbe), based on the 2001 history by Peter Øvig Knudsen. The book and film were part of some of the first efforts by Danes to seriously study issues raised by the liquidation of 400 persons by the Danish Resistance during the war. The film featured news footage, interviews with surviving agents and leaders of the Resistance movement, and reconstruction of known events. Dyrberg's Holger Danske group was also the subject of Flame and Citron (Flammen og Citronen, 2008), a Danish fictionalized dramatic film based on actions of its two most noted members, who were both killed by the Germans before the end of the war."

  "text" : "George Henry Moore (12 October 1812 – 7 July 1905), derogatorily known as Scabbie Moore, was a New Zealand runholder. He was born in Billown, Isle of Man on 12 October 1812. As a young man, he worked on Mona Vale Station in Tasmania, where he married the owner's daughter. He was later the owner of Glenmark Station north of Waipara, which for a time was New Zealand's largest sheep run. The New Zealand Historic Places Trust has four separate listings on Glenmark Station. Moore had a mansion constructed for him, which took seven years to build. It was finished in 1888, but burned out on 23 January 1891. The two-storey house had cost around ₤15,000 to build and the furniture was valued at around ₤10,000; there was no insurance. The ruins have a Category II classification. The horse stables, built of concrete in ca. 1881 for up to 50 horses, gave expression to his wealth. The stables are of considerable technological importance (due to the early use of concrete) and have a Category I listing. The Glenmark Station Lodge is listed as a Category II building and still in use. The Station Manager's House is disused these days and registered as Category II. Moore died at Christchurch in 1905, having been blind for several years. With her inheritance, his daughter purchased a property in Christchurch, which she renamed Mona Vale after her mother's property. \n* Photo gallery  \n* Ruins of the mansion \n* Station Manager's House \n* Glenmark Station Stables \n* Station Lodge"

William \"Bill\" Oakley, Jr. (March 19, 1937 – October 30, 2010) was a theatrical producer-director-actor and seminal figure in the revival of early American theater, melodrama and vaudeville with theaters in Colorado and Missouri. Dubbed \"Barnum of the Buttes\" by The Denver Post, Oakley is best known for G. William Oakley's Heritage Square Opera House \"Nostalgic Theater\" adaptations of such classic melodrama as The Drunkard, The Streets of New York, and Sweeney Todd, literary works such as Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, Frankenstein, and Sherlock Holmes, and original works including Call of the Yukon. In his productions, Oakley was a champion of improvisation and audience participation. His productions also featured \"vaudeville olio\" variety numbers showcasing the musical and comedic talents of his repertory company interspersing jokes with modern-day spoofs ranging from Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet as houseflies to Michael Jackson's \"Thriller\". Oakley's Heritage Square Opera House in Golden, Colorado (1971–1988) and the historic Goldenrod Showboat at Laclede's Landing on the St. Louis Mississippi waterfront (1975–1985) became popular icons for his brand of theater."

His second expedition, captaining Eliza, lasted from 1819 until 1821, during which time he visited the Falkland Islands and the South Shetland Islands. In 1821 and 1822 he took both Dove, which he captained, and Eliza, captained by John Wright, on another sealing expedition to the South Shetland Islands, for which he produced a very fine chart based on his own observations of the north coast of the group and the observations of others for the southern coast. On 6 December 1821, he co-discovered the South Orkney Islands along with American Nathaniel Palmer, claiming them in the name of King George IV."

  "text" : "Gert van Groningen (died ca. 1577) was a sculptor active in Denmark in the 1570s, who probably came from Groningen in the Netherlands. Gert is known to have been a citizen of Aarhus in 1573 when he was commissioned by King Frederik II to build a stone gate and a well at Skanderborg Castle. In 1574, the king transferred him to Krongborg Castle near Helsingør where he was responsible for coordinating all the sculptural additions. In particular, he designed two entrances, including the grand Royal Entrance complete with a bay, as well as fireplaces for the chambers of the king and his wife, Queen Sophie. It was also decided that the Skanderborg gate should be brought to Kronborg. Van Groningen's work for the king appears to have terminated in 1576 (the work was continued by his son, Herman Gertsen). He also completed two sandstone reliefs (1574) with the coats of arms of the king and queen for the entrance to Helsingør's town hall where they still stand today. By contrast, the coat of arms, crucifix and tombstone he designed for the chapel at Frederiksborg have now been lost. The epitaph to Holger Rosenkrantz with two wives in Uth Church near Horsens has also been attributed to Van Groningen."

  "text" : "Gilbert Mair NZC (10 January 1843–29 November 1923) was a New Zealand surveyor, interpreter, soldier and public servant. He was born in Whangarei, Northland, New Zealand on 10 January 1843, the son of an early trader, also named Gilbert Mair. Raised amongst Maori, he was a fluent Maori speaker. During the attack on Auckland by Maniapoto and Ngati Haua in 1863, Gilbert joined the Forest Rangers under Jackson, as an ensign or trainee officer. He took part in the Invasion of Waikato against the Kingitanga forces, and became famous in late 1863 for entering into discussions with the rebels during the Battle of Orakau under a flag of truce. The government forces were aware that a number of women and children were in the stronghold and Mair pleaded with the rebels to let them out but they refused and one shot Mair in the shoulder. Mair later became an officer and lead the hunt for Te Kooti between 1868 and 1872 which led to the defeat of Te Kooti's guerillas. Mair was able to convince Tuhoe ringatu, who had been part of Te Kooti's band, to lead the government forces to Te Kooti's secret camp in the Ureweras. In the 1880s Mair was the government officer trusted with establishing friendly relationships with Rewi Maniapoto in the 1880s to facilitate the main trunk railway to enter the King Country"

Esper was a noted foreign correspondent for the Associated Press during the Vietnam war, working at the AP's Saigon Bureau under bureau chief Edwin Q. White.

He spent forty-two years reporting for the Associated Press. He worked as a journalism professor at West Virginia University following his retirement from the AP in 2000. Esper was born in Uniontown, Pennsylvania, in 1932, the son of Lebanese immigrants. He graduated from West Virginia University, becoming the first member of his family to attend college. Esper worked as a sports writer for the Uniontown Morning Herald and the Pittsburgh Press before being hired by the Associated Press in 1958. Esper died in his sleep on February 2, 2012, at the age of 79. He was buried at St. George Maronite Catholic Church in Uniontown, Pennsylvania, on February 9."

  "text" : "George Gould (6 April 1865 – 26 May 1941) was a New Zealand farmer, businessman, stock breeder, racehorse owner and breeder, and racing administrator. He was born in Christchurch, New Zealand on 6 April 1865. His father (1823–1889), a prominent businessman, had the same name. He was the uncle of George Macdonald. He was the grandfather of British politician, Bryan Gould. He was chairman of the New Zealand Shipping Company for some time. In 1929, he proposed a variety of measures to relieve traffic congestion in Colombo Street and Cathedral Square, including a new bridge over the Avon River connecting Oxford Terrace with Durham Street south, and a new diagonal street from the Armagh Street / Manchester Street intersection to Gloucester Street near its intersection with Colombo Street. The latter proposal would have required the demolition of the Colosseum. Gould suggested this diagonal street be called Little High Street, in reference to the diagonal High Street further south in the central city. Only two weeks after Gould's proposal, a group of businessman led by Arthur Francis Stacey put a proposal for a new street with a Spanish theme to Christchurch City Council's town planning committee. The group had secured options on the Colosseum and on those two properties that separated the Colosseum from access onto Armagh Street. New Regent Street is what came from Stacey's proposal. He died on 26 May 1941 in Christchurch. His sister Mabel, the widow of the Hon. Henry A. Hannen (himself the son of James Hannen, Baron Hannen), died in the same week."

  "text" : "Georg Friedrich Zundel (13 October 1875 in Iptingen, Wiernsheim – 7 June 1948 in Stuttgart) was a German painter, farmer and art patron. At the age of fourteen, he went to Pforzheim, where he successfully finished an apprenticeship as a painter in 1891. He then worked as a scene painter at a Frankfurt theatre for six years, before deciding to study art in Karlsruhe, later in Stuttgart, in 1897/98. He was, however, expelled from the Stuttgart Academy of Arts, after organizing a student protest (strike). His rebellious behaviour was mainly sparked by socialist ideas, that he had taken up in the previous years; in this context, he wanted to fight exploitation and repression of workers. Around the same time, he began a relationship with the much older socialist and feminist editor, politician and translator Clara Zetkin. They married in 1899. From 1903 until their separation in 1928, they lived at a house in Sillenbuch, outside of Stuttgart, where many socialist leaders visited them (most famously Vladimir Lenin in 1907). In his early years, Zundel painted in the style of realism, mostly choosing socialist motives, often very detailed portrayals of working-class people. He also designed posters and interiors of homes for workers. Later, in the 1910s, he began to focus more on religious and mythological motives. This led to increasing estrangement between Clara Zetkin and him; they split and divorced in 1927. The following year, Zundel married Paula Bosch, daughter of the famous industrialist Robert Bosch, whom he had known (and once portrayed) since she had been a child. The couple moved into a farmhouse on a hill, the so-called \"Berghof\", near Tübingen, which Zundel himself had designed in 1921, and which had been financed by Robert Bosch for his daughters. He started to work as a farmer, painting occasionally, with the focus on idealistic and Christian motives. Paula's and his son Georg (later a famous physical chemist and philanthropist) was born in 1931. Zundel died in Stuttgart in 1948 and was buried at Tübingen's Stadtfriedhof (site of the graves of Friedrich Hölderlin and Ludwig Uhland). His widow Paula and her sister Margarete Fischer-Bosch founded Tübingen's now most famous museum, the Kunsthalle Tübingen, in honour of Zundel, in 1971."

  "text" : "Gerald Arthur Friend (born 1938) is a serial rapist and kidnapper from Lakewood, Washington, currently serving two consecutive 75-year terms at Airway Heights Corrections Center. Friend was originally jailed for abducting a 12-year-old girl from Sumner, Washington in July 1960, when he was 22. He picked up the hitchhiking girl and her brother, but forced the boy from the car at gunpoint. He then drove the girl to Mount Rainier National Park where he beat her, raped her, and cut her hair. The victim eventually escaped by jumping into a river, where she was discovered by a passing motorist. Several days later, Friend's father found him hiding in a field near their home; Friend drew a .22 pistol and was wounded in the ensuing struggle. His father took him to the hospital and turned him in to police. Friend was convicted of rape and torture, and was sentenced to a minimum of 75 years. However, after serving 20 years at Walla Walla, and escaping twice, he was paroled in 1980. In June 1987, he abducted a 14-year-old girl at knifepoint when she accepted a ride after a rock concert. He repeatedly raped and tortured her while she was tied to a pulley suspended from the ceiling of his mobile home. The girl escaped by jumping from his truck at a gas station. Friend was stopped a day later for a traffic violation and arrested when the deputies recognized him. He was convicted of first-degree kidnapping and rape that August. He was ordered to serve the remainder of his 1960 sentence, in addition to a second 75-year sentence. The following year, his second victim sued the state and the Department of Corrections for prematurely paroling Friend in 1980. Police in King County suspected Friend in the Green River Killer case, and considered him a suspect in the murder of two girls in Tacoma in 1987. However, police were unable to uncover a connection to those crimes. The 1987 kidnapping of the 14-year-old victim was the inspiration for the Nirvana song \"Polly,\" released in 1991. Songwriter Kurt Cobain had read about the incident in a newspaper."

After serving in the Gordon Highlanders during the first world war, Currie studied at the University of Aberdeen, graduating in 1923 with BSc and BAgSc, including First Class Honours in zoology and geology. After graduation, Currie and his wife emigrated to Australia where he managed a sugar-cane plantation in Queensland. In 1926 he joined the Queensland Department of Agriculture and Stock as an assistant entomologist. In 1929 he moved to Canberra to take up a position with the Council for Scientific and Industry Research. He worked in the division of economic entomology and specialized in the biological control of noxious weeds. In 1937 he was promoted to principal research scientist. In 1939 Currie was appointed to the University of Western Australia as the Hackett professor of agriculture. In the following year he acquired extra duties as part-time Vice Chancellor of the University and served in this role until 1945. Currie served as full-time Vice Chancellor of the University of Western Australia from 1945 to 1952, and Vice Chancellor of the University of New Zealand from 1952 until his retirement in 1962. Currie was knighted in 1960. Since 1960, the University of Western Australia's residential college has been named Currie Hall in honour of the University's second Vice Chancellor. When Currie retired in 1962 he and his wife returned to Canberra. He chaired a working party on education that recommended in 1967 that the ACT should have its own system of education. Curried died in Royal Canberra Hospital on 4 May 1984, aged 87."

To this alleged crime his accusers in the senate added the charges of treason (majestas) and sacrilege to the divinity of Augustus. Tacitus suggests that the charge of treason was added to his charges in order to intimidate Silanus' friends from defending him. Silanus, deserted by his friends and without experience in pleading, abandoned his defence. It was proposed to outlaw and banish him to the island of Gyarus; but Tiberius changed the place of his exile to the less inhospitable island of Cynthus which his sister Torquata had begged might be his place of punishment. He had at least three sons: Appius Junius Silanus, consul in 28, Decimus Junius Silanus who was in an affair with Julia the Younger and Marcus Junius Silanus, consul suffectus in 15."

Then he worked at the Waimate mission, teaching the Māori students. From 1831 to 1839 Clarke and Richard Davis managed the farm at Waimate North at which Maori students learnt farming skills. He was appointed as secretary of the CMS in New Zealand. In 1840 Clarke was made protector of aborigines by the recently appointed lieutenant-governor, Captain Hobson. The seat of government was transferred to Auckland, and there Clarke bought a large block of land from the Māori for the government. Governor George Grey abolished the protectorate in 1846. He returned to Waimate North and became a farmer and resumed his work as secretary of the CMS in New Zealand. However controversy in relation to land purchases by CMS missionaries resulted in Clarke being dismissed from the CMS in 1849. Clarke was elected to the Auckland Provincial Council and served from 1853 to 1855. He was appointed a judge of the Native Land Court in 1865. He died at Waimate North on 29 July 1875."

  "text" : "Georgios Hatzis (Greek: Γεώργιος Χατζής, 1881–1930), also known under the pen name Pelleren, was a Greek author and journalist. Hatzis was born in Ioannina, northwestern Greece, when the city was still part of the Janina Vilayet of the Ottoman Empire. He graduated from the Zosimaia School of Ioannina and then went to the University of Athens, where he studied Medicine. However, he could not finish his studies due to financial difficulties. Hatzis then went back to Ioannina and became a teacher in Vourbiani, Konitsa. In 1909 Hatzis was appointed editor of the newspaper Epirus (Ήπειρος), by the Hellenic Political Association of Ioannina. In the columns of Epirus he supported the rights of the Greek population of the region against the mismanagement and the defective administration of the Ottoman authorities of that time. Because of this activity he was sentenced to death by the Ottomans, but meanwhile, the Balkan Wars and the retreat of the Ottoman troops, saved his live. During 1914-1915 he participated in the events that occurred in Northern Epirus by the local Greeks against annexation to newly established Albania and supported the activities of the provisional government. After the Balkan Wars and the subsequent incorporation of his home land to Greece, Hatzis supported the initiative for an organized literary club in Ioannina with its own library, in order to promote literature and arts in the city. Finally in 1924 the Educational Club (Εκπαιδευτικός Όμιλος) of Ioannina was founded and Hatzis together with other prominent figures of Epirus, such as Christos Christovasilis, became members of the administrative committee. He continued to his work in newspaper Epirus until his death in 1930. His statue is erected at the Άλσος Ποιητών (poet's grove) in Ioannina.

He also was assistant coach two years at Princeton. In 1992, Hamilton was hired as pitching coach for the Team Canada. He got a job as pitching coach and GM of the Barracudas de Montpellier of Division Élite in France in 1993 and helped the team to three titles in a row, their most successful run to date (as of 2007). Part of his success came from his recruitment of Jeff Zimmerman, who became the most notable player to emerge from the French league in the 20th Century. He was pitching coach for the French national team in 1994, making him pitching coach for two senior national teams on different continents. Hamilton left Team Canada in 1996 to become head coach of the Canadian junior national team, leading them to a Bronze Medal in the 1997 World Junior Championship. He was named Baseball Canada Coach of the Year that season. It was also his last year as Montpellier's coach and GM. Hamilton was an assistant coach at the University of Maine in 1998, taking a break from coaching the junior Canadian national team. He returned to his role as junior national team coach in 1999. Hamilton also coached for Team Canada's senior team in the 2004 Olympics, 2007 Baseball World Cup, 2008 Final Olympic Qualification Tournament, 2008 Olympics and 2010 Pan American Games Qualification Tournament.

  "text" : "George Wilks (born 1908) was a British motorcycle speedway rider who rode for Harringay and Wembley, and also rode in test matches for England. Born in East End of London Wilks was riding motorbikes before he was a teenager, racing in grasstrack and also travelled to the Isle of Man to compete in the TT in 1929, only to suffer injuries in practice which led to five months in hospital, and a break of three years from motorcycle racing. In the early 1930s he won the South Midlands grasstrack title several times, and was encouraged to move to speedway by Australian international Frank Arthur. He first rode for Harringay, transferring to Hackney Wick at the end of 1935 for a transfer fee of GB£25. In early 1938 he was transferred to Wembley for GB£350, finishing as third-highest points scorer in his first season with the Lions. He worked in a factory during World War II, returning to Wembley when speedway resumed, and was part of the team that won the National League Championship and the London Cup in 1946. Wilks was first called up by England in 1939, as a reserve in the final test against Australia at Wembley, but did not ride. In 1947 he rode at reserve for England in the second test match against Australia at West Ham, scoring ten points from four rides. He also rode in the final test at Wembley, scoring nine points. He rode in the first test at Wimbledon in 1948, scoring eleven points in England's 61-45 win. His career was interrupted by a fractured thigh in 1948, and in 1949 was loaned to West Ham as a temporary replacement for Eric Chitty who had broken a leg. He retired in 1952."

  "text" : "George Gunton (1845–1919) was an influential figure in the labor movement of the United States around the turn of the 20th century and was an avid supporter of industrial combinations, or 'trusts'. He was a close colleague of Ira Steward, and upon Steward's death in 1883 he agreed to complete and prepare for publication a book that Steward had been writing. Gunton found only notes, not a nearly complete book. Deciding the notes were not suffiecient for editing, Gunton discarded them, instead building on the ideas of his colleague to formulate his own book on the labor movement, \"Wealth and Progress\", which was published in 1887, followed by \"Principles of Social Economics\" in 1891. He founded a school, the Institute of Social Economics, in 1891, with the aim of educating the masses in the path of responsible citizenship. Gunton was the editor of Gunton's Magazine, a goal-oriented publication, which drew many prominent thinkers of his time. An early supporter and adviser to Theodore Roosevelt, Gunton later became a vocal critic of the president, when the administration began attacking trusts, forming a Bureau of Corporations with full investigative powers in 1903. Though Gunton was accused in his life of being 'bought' by big business, he genuinely believed, and made good argument to the fact, that well organized capital was vital to the protection of the rights of a well-organized labor force."

  "text" : "Kwasimukamba or Graman Quassi (also spelled Quacy, Kwasi and Quasi) (1692 – 12 March 1787 in Paramaribo) was a Surinamese healer, botanist, slave and later freedman of the 18th century, who is today best known for having given his name to the plant species quassia. Kwasi's roots were among the Kwa speaking Akan people of present day Ghana, but as a child he was enslaved and brought to the New World. As a slave in Suriname, a Dutch colony in South America, he participated in the wars against the Saramaka maroons as a scout and negotiator for the Dutch, and he lost his right ear during the fighting. For this reason the Surinamese maroons remember him as a traitor. Kwasi worked as a healer of some renown, and fared so well that he was able to get his freedom and travel to the Netherlands. One of his remedies was a bitter tea that he used to treat infections by intestinal parasites, this concoction was based on the plant Quassia amara which Carolus Linnaeus named after him, as the discoverer of its medicinal properties. Quassia continues to be used in industrially produced medicines against intestinal parasites today. In contemporary accounts he was described as \"one of the most extraordinary black men in Suriname, and perhaps the world\""

  "text" : "Girijabai Madhav Kelkar (Marathi: गिरिजाबाई माधव केळकर) (1886–1980) was a feminist and writer from India. The performance of her play led to many debates about women's rights and the concept of gender roles. She was president of 23rd Akhil Bharatiya Marathi Natya Sammelan (All-India Marathi Theatre Meet) of Akhil Bharatiya Marathi Natya Parishad held in 1928 at Pune. She was daughter of Narasimha Chintaman Kelkar. She married into a family of illustrious Marathi literary figures. She was encouraged by her husband to pursue Marathi literature as a profession, and thus fulfill her aspirations. She was a prolific writer who promoted Marathi language and literature. She started Bhagini Mandal, a women's organisation in Jalgaon. She was the president of the All India Hindu Mahila Parishad in 1935. Her works include Purushanche Band [Men's Rebellion] and Striyanche Swarga [Women's Paradise]. Padma Anagol describes her views on women's oppression as complex, which found themselves expressed in her works. According to her, the play Purushanche Banda was written to \"counteract the effects of vilification of Indian women\" by Khadilkar's play Striyancha Band [Women's Rebellion]. The Encyclopaedia Of Indian Literature describes her work as inspired by Apte. Her work describes \"women's suffering in the frame work of family life, moderately protesting against social injustice\". She strongly identified herself with the traditional Hindu notions of femininity, with a mystified role as spouse and mother, asking for trivial concessions."

  "text" : "Giovanni Andrea Bontempi (ca. 1624 – 1 July 1705) was an Italian castrato singer, later composer, historian, music theorist, and assistant kapellmeister to Heinrich Schütz at Dresden from 1657. He was born Giovanni Andrea Angelini, in Perugia but later took the surname of his patron Cesare Bontempi. His Il Paride was the first Italian-language opera to be given in Dresden. It was first performed in November 1662 at the Dresden Castle to celebrate the marriage of Erdmude Sophia, the daughter of the Elector of Saxony, and Christian Ernst, Count of Brandenburg. He composed two other operas, both of which also premiered in Dresden: Dafne performed in 1671 to open the Opernhaus am Taschenberg, and Jupiter und Jo first performed in 1673. Bontempi spent the last years of his life in Brufa (near Perugia) and is buried in the chapel of SS. Cosma e Damiano there."
