Henry became a merchant and consul, based for many years in Turkey. During the Interregnum, he was selected by Charles II (who would flee into exile in 1651), to act as an envoy to the Turkish empire and solicit their support for his cause. The official Parliamentarian (Roundhead) ambassador, Sir Thomas Bendish, strongly objected and prevailed upon the Turks to arrest him and ship him back to England. The Third English Civil War was raging at this time, as well. Sir Henry Hyde was imprisoned in the Tower, charged with treason, and tried by a court made up from the House of Commons. The court found him guilty and sentenced him to death. He was beheaded, after kissing the executioner's axe, outside the Old Exchange in Cornhill, London, on 4 March 1650. His remains were interred in Salisbury Cathedral where his epitaph is inscribed on a marble tablet."

Hubertus or Huib van Hove was taught painting not only by his father, but also by Hendrik van de Sande Bakhuyzen. In his father's studio, he worked with Johannes Bosboom and together they worked on the pieces of scenery that Bartholomeus van Hove created for the Royal Theatre in The Hague. Hubertus started as a landscape painter, but his best work was not in that style. His love of color and bright light was best displayed in his doorkijkjes, or domestic vistas, in the style of Pieter de Hooch. These were views of outdoor light seen through an interior, a room or kitchen situated between the street door and an inner yard. Teyler's Museum possesses an excellent specimen in The Knitter, a picture which is of a lively composition and shows an inclination for a stronger and fresher coloring than prevailed in Van Hove's day. Among his pupils were Jacob Maris, Christoffel Bisschop, Stroebel, Maurits Leon (1838–1865) and Hendricus Johannes Scheeres (1823–1864), who continued his master's teaching in his Armourer and Linen-shop and who enjoyed the appreciation of his brother artists."

He was sent by the domain to Edo for studies, where he became involved in the sonnō jōi movement, and after returning to Tosa, he joined Takechi Hanpeita’s Tosa Kin-nō-tō (土佐勤王党) movement. He travelled with Takechi to Kyoto in 1863, where he joined forces with the anti-Tokugawa shogunate forces of Chōshū Domain and made contact with the kuge aristocracy, most notably Sanjō Sanetomi. After the abortive coup against the Shogunate later that year, he was forced into exile with Sanjō to Chōshū. Following the First Chōshū expedition, he fled to Fukuoka Domain together with Sanjō, where he later met with fellow Tosa countrymen Nakaoka Shintarō, and Sakamoto Ryōma whom he assisted in securing Sanjō’s support for the Satchō Alliance. Following the Meiji restoration, Hijikata joined the Meiji government and was appointed a public prosecutor in Tokyo. He subsequently served in the Imperial Household Ministry and Home Ministry and as Cabinet Secretary to the Daijō-kan cabinet. He was subsequently made a tutor, then an Imperial Councilor to Emperor Meiji, who placed a great deal of confidence in him, and who made him a viscount (shishaku) in the kazoku peerage in 1884. In 1885, with the establishment of the cabinet system, Hijikata was appointed Minister of Agriculture and Commerce under the 1st Itō Hirobumi administration in 1887, and Imperial Household Ministry from 1887-1898. He was also made a member of the Privy Council from 1888. Hijikata was awarded the title of count (hakushaku) in 1895. After his retirement from the Imperial Household Ministry, he served as president of Kokugakuin University. He died in 1918 at the age of 86, and his grave is at the Somei Cemetery in Tokyo."

  "text" : "Henry Chowne (c 1613 – 1668) was an English politician who sat in the House of Commons at various times between 1659 and 1668. Chowne was the son of Thomas Chowne of Place House, Alfriston and his wife Rachel Campion, daughter of William Campion of Combwell, Goudhurst, Kent. He was apprenticed to the father of Sir Robert Cordell, and by 1639 was acting as his factor at Smyrna. In 1651, he succeeded his nephew William to the family estate, including property in Horsham. He held stock in the East India Company, and later arranged for his son to take a post at Surat. In 1659, he was elected Member of Parliament for Horsham in the Third Protectorate Parliament, but was involved in a double return and his election was declared void. He was commissioner for assessment for Sussex from August 1660 until his death. In 1661 he was elected MP for Horsham in the Cavalier Parliament. He was a J.P. from 1662 until his death. Chowne died at the age of about 54 and was buried at Horsham on 22 October 1668. Chowne married Barbara Middleton daughter of Thomas Middleton of Horsham on 26 April 1642 and had seven sons and a daughter. His grandson Thomas Chowne was elected MP for Seaford in 1702 and 1710."

FitzGerold was probably the son of Robert fitzGerald, an Essex landowner. Henry definitely had a brother named Warin. The brothers' first appearance in the documentary record was as witnesses to the foundation document of Walden Abbey, some time between 1138 and 1144. Henry subsequently witnessed a number of the future King Henry II's charters before the latter's accession to the throne of England. Soon after 1154, he was appointed constable of Wallingford Castle. Henry II sent him to Sens on a diplomatic mission to the pope in 1163. FitzGerold was the steward to Geoffrey de Mandeville, the Earl of Essex, from around 1154 as well as holding land worth 4 knight's fees from Mandeville. From 1158–1170 he was chamberlain to Henry II, succeeding his brother Warin. Besides the lands held of Mandeville, Henry and Warin acquired the majority of the lands of Eudo Dapifer; Henry's share amounted to more than 50 knight's fees in Essex in 1166. FitzGerold also had the farm of the royal manor of Sutton Courtenay in Berkshire, which was worth ₤50 per annum. From 1166 until 1168 he was responsible for royal payments to knights in Kent. He also served as a royal justice in Kent during 1168–1169. FitzGerold married Matilda de Chesney, the heiress of William de Chesney, whose parentage remains unknown. They had two sons, Warin and Henry. The elder fitzGerold died in 1174–1175, and was survived by Matilda and his sons. He was buried at Reading Abbey. Besides grants to Reading, he had also given gifts to Southwark Priory and to the cathedral chapter of Rochester Cathedral. Henry's eldest son Warin inherited the majority of his father's estates. Warin married Alice de Courcy. Warin's daughter Margaret married Baldwin de Redvers and their son was Baldwin de Redvers, the 6th Earl of Devon. The younger Henry married Ermentrude Talbot and became prominent in the service of William Marshall, the 1st Earl of Pembroke."

  "text" : "Hellmuth Simons (1893–1969), who predominantly published under the name H. C. R. Simons, was a German-Jewish bacteriologist and authority on tropical diseases, who encouraged the belief that Germany was developing biological weapons before and during World War II. Simons worked at I. G. Farben before escaping Germany as a refugee. He provided scientific help to Heinz Liepman for his 1937 book Death from the skies: a study of gas and microbial warfare. When World War II broke out he was working at the Pasteur Institute in Paris, but was offered a chair at a university in Pennsylvania. In autumn 1939 he and his son were interned at Marseilles en route to the United States. At some point he visited England, where he reportedly worked at the British Library and in Cambridge, and came to know Wickham Steed. In 1943, when Simons was working at the Zurich Polytechnic Institute, Allen Dulles passed on Simons' fear that Germany would use bacillus botulinus for bacteriological warfare. According to Donald Avery, Simons claimed that I. G. Farben was producing botulin at its plant at Hoechst, at a Berlin laboratory, and elsewhere. In 1947 Simons started teaching biology at the Philadelphia College of Pharmacy and Science. The bacterial genus Simonsiella is named after him."

In the heyday of cassette radio dramas until the 1980s, he wrote hundreds of adaptations or original plays for youth series such as Three Investigators, The Famous Five, TKKG and Masters of the Universe. In total, more than 120 million of his plays were sold. They reached gold status 120 times and platinum status six times."

  "text" : "Hugh George Egioke Savage (1883 – February 7, 1957) was an English-born journalist and political figure in British Columbia. He represented Cowichan-Newcastle in the Legislative Assembly of British Columbia from 1933 to 1937 as a member of the Oxford Group Movement. He was born in Stratford-on-Avon and served in South Africa during the Second Boer War. Savage came to Canada in 1909 and was employed by the Vancouver Daily Province from 1910 to 1911. In January 1914, he was telegrammed by his former roommate and Province coworker Lukin Johnston asking him to take over Johnston's role as editor of the weekly Cowichan Leader, based in Duncan on Vancouver Island. He represented Cowichan-Newcastle in the Legislative Assembly of British Columbia from 1933 to 1937 as a member of the Oxford Group Movement. Savage was defeated when he ran for reelection to the provincial assembly in 1937 as an Independent. He died in Cobble Hill at the age of 74. An award for small circulation weekly newspapers, the Hugh Savage Shield, was named in his honour."

His book Taking Appearance Seriously: The Dynamic Way of Seeing in Goethe and European Thought was published in 2012. Bortoft completed his studies at the University of Hull, and then performed postgraduate research on the foundations of quantum physics at Birkbeck College, where theoretical physicist David Bohm introduced him to the problem of wholeness in quantum theory. Subsequently, Bortoft worked with John G. Bennett on Bennett's Systematics (also known as Multi-Term Systems, which was Bennett's methodology for assisting the systematic and progressive understanding of systems, complexity, and wholeness, and on efforts with Bennett and with Kenneth W. Pledge to develop a formal language that was rigorouly descriptive of scientific activity. Those efforts were published in Systematics: The Journal of the Institute for the Comparative Study of History, Philosophy and the Sciences, listed below. Bortoft taught physics and philosophy of science at Schumacher College in the framework of the program in Holistic Science. He held numerous lectures and seminars in Great Britain and the United States on the scientific work of Johann Wolfgang von Goethe and on the development of modern science. Bortoft died on 29 December 2012 at his home in Matlaske, Norfolk."

  "text" : "Henry W. Miller (1807–1885) was the first member of the Iowa legislature from the area of Council Bluffs, Iowa. Miller was born in Lexington, Greene County, New York. He was trained as a carpenter as a youth and In about 1828 he moved to Illinois and settled in Quincy, Illinois. In September 1839 Miller converted to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). He was made president of the Freedom Stake of the church, heading the Church's operations in Adams County, Illinois. The stake lasted from October 1840 until May 1841. He relocated to Nauvoo, Illinois in about 1841. Miller was made a member of the Nauvoo Temple building committee and then sent to the lumber-mills in Wisconsin to work on providing wood for the temple. Miller later returned to Nauvoo and was one of the executors charged with selling Mormon land after most Mormons had left. After the Mormons were forced out of Nauvoo, Miller settled on the east side of the Missouri River at a place called Miller's Hollow. This was later renamed Kanesville, and is the current Council Bluffs, Iowa. Miller was elected to the legislature from Potawatomie County, Iowa in 1851. In 1852 Miller went to Utah Territory, serving as a captain of a pioneer company. Miller served as a member of the Utah Territorial Legislature from 1852 until 1854. Miller served a mission for the LDS Church to the Cherokee in 1855 to 1857. Besides preaching to and baptizing many Cherokee, Miller also baptized many of those who had followed Lyman Wight who he found in this same general vicinity. On his return he went through Missouri, and aided Erastus Snow in getting cattle to help with the trip west. From 1864 Miller led a group of Mormons in founding a settlement they called Millersburg at what is now Beaver Dam, Arizona. After Millerburg was flooded out in 1866 Miller lived in St. George, Utah for most of the remained of his life, although he died while visiting his brother in Farmington, Utah."

  "text" : "Halsey Chase Herreshoff (born 1933) is a Naval Architect of production- and custom yachts, sailor and former president of Herreshoff Marine Museum. At the museum he and Edward duMoulin founded the America's Cup Hall of Fame in 1992. Halsey is son of Sidney DeWolf Herreshoff and Rebecca Chase Herreshoff and the grandson of the famous Nathanael Greene Herreshoff. As several before him in the Herreshoff family he studied Naval Architecture. At Webb Institute of Naval Architecture he finished a bachelor's degree and later a master's at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. In the US navy he achieved rank of Lieutenant before he started as a Naval Architect at the Bethlehem Steel Company and as a teacher at MIT. Halsey was involved in politics and was the elected chief executive officer (Town Administrator) in Bristol Town Council, Rhode Island from 1986 to 1994. As a yacht designer his Herreshoff Freedom 40 design led to a line of Herreshoff ketches from 27 to 45 feet and changed the way the world felt about un-stayed masts. Halsey might be best known for his career as an America's Cup sailor, having served on many cup defenders of the 12-metre class Era, first as bowman on Columbia in 1958 and concluding as navigator on Liberty in 1983. But perhaps his greatest contribution to sailing has been his development of the America's Cup Hall of Fame at the Herreshoff Marine Museum."

His father was put on his trial in 1589 on the charge of having contrived the death of the Earl of Leicester by witchcraft and went into exile. In 1589 Croft was elected Member of Parliament for Carmarthenshire. He was a J.P. for Carmarthenshire and for Herefordshire from 1591 and for Oxfordshire from about 1592. In about 1592 he became steward of the lordships of Kerry, Kedewen and Montgomery, Montontgomeryshire and was steward of crown lands in Herefordshire from October 1592. In 1593 Croft was elected MP for Herefordshire. He succeeded his grandfather James Croft to the family estates in 1594. In 1597 he was elected MP for Launceston and became Deputy Lieutenant. He was receiver-general for South Wales from April 1599 to 1604. In 1601 he was elected MP for Herefordshire again. He became a member of the council in the marches of Wales from 1601. He was knighted in 1603. In 1604 he was re-elected MP for Herefordshire. In 1607 he protested about the jusrisdiction of the council in the marches over the border shires and this cost him his seat on the council and his positions as JP and Deputy Lieutenant. He was re-elected MP for Herefordshire in 1614. In about 1617, he became a Catholic and a monk at the English Benedictine priory of St Gregory the Great at Douai, where he wrote pamphlets in defence of his new faith. Croft died at the age of about 63. Croft married Mary Bourne, daughter of Anthony Bourne of Holt Castle, Worcestershire and had four sons and five daughters. His son Herbert later became Bishop of Hereford."

  "text" : "Hilde von Stolz (July 8, 1903 in Segesvár, Nagy-Küküllő County, Austria-Hungary, now Romania — December 16, 1973 in Berlin) was an Austrian-German actress. Von Stolz attended the Max Reinhardt Seminar in Vienna and made her debut at the local Kammerspielen. She subsequently performed at various theaters in Vienna and in the Theater am Schiffbauerdamm in Berlin. She made her debut in film in 1928 under the pseudonym \"Helen Steels\". That same year, she moved to Berlin. In her second film role, she played the lead role opposite Reinhold Schünzel in Don Juan in the girls' school. Von Stolz began performing under her real name starting in 1933. She established herself as a major film actress although she had to be satisfied with major supporting roles that usually portrayed elegant ladies and femmes fatales such as the actress Lydia Link in Traumulus. Von Stolz had planned to emigrate from Germany but the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939 frustrated those plans. During the war she worked in a number of Nazi propaganda films, the most widely known of these was her role as the wife of Duke Karl Alexander in Veit Harlan's Jud Süß (1940). After the war, she acted only rarely in films. After her death in 1973, she was buried in the family vault."

  "text" : "Havzi Nela (20 February 1934 – 10 August 1988) was an Albanian dissident poet, born in the village of Kollovoz in the district of Kukës. He managed to finish both elementary and high school while living in extreme poverty. In high school he began to express objections against what he perceived as \"injustices\" that, according to him, were created by the communist regime. After this he began studies at the Higher Pedagogical Institute of Shkodra (Luigj Gurakuqi University today), but was expelled due to seemilngy rebellious and controversial beliefs. After much difficulty, he found a job as an elementary school teacher at Plani i Bardhe, a small village in the district of Mat, but was forced to leave the village due to suspicious activity. Suspicion arose after students began reading his poetry. He then went on to study at the Higher Pedagogical Institute of Shkodra by correspondence. He worked as a teacher in different villages such as Kruma, Lojme and Shishtavec until 1967, when he moved to Topojan. Topojan was where the most dramatic events of the poet and his family began. Havzi Nela was constantly under surveillance and was often taken into custody. He was restricted and censored heavily in what he wrote, but also where and how he could live. After his students read the poem \"Shko dallandyshe\" (Go Swallow) written by Filip Shiroka, Havzi Nela and his wife, Lavdie, were under threat of prosecution from the government due to its controversial content. They risked their lives by taking the journey over the border into Kosovo, Yugoslavia on April 26, 1967. While crossing the frontier he wrote on a piece of paper; \"Goodbye, homeland, I am leaving, but with a broken heart\", (Lamtumire atdhe i dashur, se po iki zemërplasur). He placed the piece of paper in the branch of a hazel tree. It is widely believed that the purpose of this was to declare an undying love for the country and its people however expressing disdain towards its dictatorship.A tragic fate would soon follow in Kosovo. He was captured just beyond the border together with his wife. They were arrested and imprisoned in Prizren, Kosovo.On May 6, 1967, the Yugoslavian government agreed on an exchange turning Havzi Nela and Lavdie Nela in for several Yugoslavian prisoners held in Albania. The exchange took place at the Morina border crossing point. On May 22, 1967, the poet was tried and sentenced by the courts of Kukes county to fifteen years in prison, on charges of betrayal and desertion of his country, serious offences under the regime of communist leader Enver Hoxha. His wife Lavdie Nela was sentenced to ten years in prison. She was offered the possibility of a shorter sentence if she would forsake and divorce her husband, but did not agree to this and accepted her punishment. Havzi Nela was imprisoned in the prison of Burrel initially then transferred to Spaç-Rrëshen prison. On August 8, 1975, eight years were added to Nela's sentence due to his involvement in organizing and leading an uprising which took place within the prison, directed against the government regime and the appalling conditions at the prison. On December 19, 1986, he was finally released from prison, but was strictly confined to the village of Arren. When news came of his dying mother less than a year later, on October 12, 1987 he left Arren to go and see her one last time. This was discovered by the government immediately and Havzi Nela was once again arrested and soon after sentenced to death by hanging. On June 24, 1988, the Supreme Court of Albania's communist judges consisting of Fehmi Abdiu, Vili and Fatmira Laskaj Robo rejected Lavdie Nela's appeal against her husband's death sentence. Those behind this felt it was a good opportunity to make an example of Havzi Nela and spread terror throughout the nation. They built a contraption in the middle of the town of Kukes where he would be hanged publicly. The death penalty was signed by Ramiz Alia and Kristaq Rama, the father of Albania's current Prime Minister, Edi Rama On August 10, 1988, at 02:00 am, he was executed.After being exposed all day on August 10, 1988, at midnight communist officials took his body and threw it vertically in a hole created by removal of a wooden pole at an undisclosed location. He was deprived of the opportunity to reach out to all the dead and to be laid to rest. His body remained buried at an undisclosed location for five years and ten days, until August 20, 1993. After numerous attempts by the democratic government of Albania, this was the day that it finally became possible to search the land which was covered with rocks and bushes near Kolsh village, two kilometers away from Kukës. With the presidential decree of the President of the Republic of Albania, Sali Berisha, Havzi Nela was given the title \"Martyr of Democracy\".In 2009, in marking the 75th anniversary of the birth of Havzi Nela, prominent writer Ismail Kadare wrote: \"The poet Havzi Nela is a bell that still rings for Albanian society. Not to listen to it is to continue to be trampled on by the foot of the oppressor.\""

Dr. Wilson was born in Danville, Virginia in 1839 and came to Atlanta in 1853. He graduated from Emory College at the original Oxford campus in 1858. He then became a doctor at Atlanta Medical College and was appointed as city physician. He served in the Confederate army and was made chief sureon of the conscript department of Georgia. In 1872 he was elected to Atlanta City Council. He was chairman of the street committee and helped improved Whitehall, Marietta and Peachtree Streets. He was elected to the Fulton County commissioner in 1886 and was chairman of the committee of public works. Soon after 1885 he opened a drug store at the corner of Broad and Marietta Streets. After selling his drug business he entered the real estate business to become \"one of the largest and boldest real estate men of the South\", long in partnership with Frank P. Rice. in 1883 he was an incorporator of the Fulton County Street Railroad which brought horsecar service to Ponce de Leon Springs. Wilson is credited with giving the Springs their name. The line would later become the Nine-Mile Circle electric streetcar which would make accessible and thus enable the development of what is today Virginia-Highland and adjacent neighborhoods. Indeed, in 1914, Wilson sold 65 acres which would be subdivided into Boulevard Park, one of the original subdivisions of today's Virginia Highland. He was also a director of the Cotton States and International Exposition Company. Wilson was described as a \"stubby blond man of medium height with a brusque manner and a quick keen glance\". At one point Wilson resided in a grand house on Peachtree Street in today's Midtown Atlanta near the intersection of 5th Street. He died in 1917 and was buried in Oakland Cemetery (Atlanta, Georgia)."

One of his brothers, Hjalmar Pettersen, was a noted a librarian and bibliographer. Three other brothers, Gunerius, Axel and Carl, were Harald's business partners. He took his commercial education in England and Germany. In 1895 he inherited the company founded by and named after his father, Gunerius Pettersen. The company was passed down from his mother, and shared between the brothers Harald, Gunerius, Axel and Carl. They soon made important investments and expansions. The building at Storgaten 32 was bought in 1897, followed by Brogaten 2 and 4 in 1912. The company was expanded from a store to also encompass retailing and wholesaling. Harald Pettersen chaired the professional association Oslo Kjøbmandsforening from 1902 to 1905 and 1910 to 1911. He served as consul for the Netherlands from 1910 to 1921, and was elected as a deputy representative to the Parliament of Norway from Hammersborg in 1906. He was a deputy during the term 1907–1909 for Ole Olsen Malm, but met in Parliament in 1908 and 1909. Harald Pettersen was decorated as an Officer of the Order of Orange-Nassau. He died in October 1937 and was buried at Vår Frelsers gravlund. The company Gunerius Pettersen was eventually taken over by Harald's nephew Christian Børs Pettersen, who was joined by a grandnephew Gunerius. The family company still exists in the same location, but the store is now named Gunerius Shoppingsenter."

  "text" : "H. Beaumont Small (1831-1919) was a Canadian civil servant and an early naturalist who authored a number of books on forestry, minerals, animals, botany, and tourism. Born in Market Bosworth, Leicestershire, England on October 31, 1831, he was the son of the Rev. Nathaniel Pomfret Small and Catherine Lee. He was born after his mother was gored by a bull. She died one hour after delivering her son. Receiving his first degree from King's College London in 1850, he went on to attend Lincoln College, Oxford, graduating in 1853. Seeing the opportunities Canada offered in the field of Natural History, he emigrated there shortly after obtaining his degrees. He later relocated to the United States to become a Classical Professor at a military college in what today is Ossining, New York. After spending two years in this capacity, he continued on in the U.S. being a private tutor for a time in New York, and then serving in the United States Sanitary Commission in Virginia during the American Civil War. About the time his first book was published in 1865, he returned to Canada and entered into civil service. In 1868, he joined the Marine and Fisheries Department shortly after its formation. In 1870 he was appointed private secretary to the Hon. Christopher Dunkin, Minister of Agriculture. After Dunkin resigned as Minister in 1871, H. Beaumont Small went on to hold various appointments within the Department of Agriculture, eventually being appointed Secretary of Agriculture in 1889. Personally, H. Beaumont Small married Henrietta Falle on June 20, 1853, and the couple had five children, including their eldest son, Dr. Henry Beaumont Small. H. Beaumont Small died on February 6, 1919 in Bermuda and is buried there."

  "text" : "Hereward Leighton Kesteven (16 January 1881 – 18 May 1964) was an Australian medical scientist. Born at Levuka, Fiji, to medical officer Leighton Kesteven and Caroline Elizabeth, née Eames, he and his family moved to Brisbane in the 1880s and to Sydney in 1891, where Hereward attended Sydney Church of England Grammar School until his father's bankruptcy forced him to leave. He became technical assistant to the Australian Museum's curator in 1903 and on 18 October 1905 married professional musician Irene \"Ivy\" Valentine Smith. He attended the University of Sydney and received a Bachelor of Science in 1909, a Doctorate of Science in 1911, a Bachelor of Medicine in 1914 and a Master of Surgery in 1916. He lectured at the physiology department of Sydney Technical College from 1908 to 1913 and published A Manual of Practical Bio-Chemistry in 1912. In 1915 Kesteven entered general practice at Belmore, later practicing at Gin Gin and Gladstone in Queensland before returning to Sydney in 1919, where he received his Doctorate of Medicine. He set up practice at Maroubra but in 1920 relocated to Bulahdelah. He was appointed honorary zoologist to the Australian Museum in 1926 and wrote articles for the publications of the Museum, the Linnean Society of New South Wales and the Royal Society of New South Wales. He was integral in the building of Bulahdelah's hospital and later acquired a local farm. In 1934 he ran for the federal election, contesting Earle Page's seat of Cowper for the Douglas Credit Party. In 1936 he returned to Sydney and became medical director for Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company; during the war he worked in armament factories in Lithgow. From 1942 to 1946 Kesteven was director of medical services to the Allied Works Council, publishing a series of articles that were later collected as An Industrial Medical-Efficiency Service. His work on \"the evolution of the skull and the cephalic muscles\" won him the Warren Burfitt prize in 1944 and the David Syme Research Prize in 1946. His first wife, who had a cerebral haemorrhage in 1936, died after a long illness in 1943 and Kesteven remarried nurse Louise Ray Smith on 24 June 1944 at Darling Point. He moved to Queensland for his health in 1948, practicing at Cooktown, Palmwoods, Maroochydore and Brighton. He died suddenly in 1964 and was cremated."

  "text" : "Helen A. Berger is an American sociologist known for her studies of the Pagan community in the United States. Helen Berger, then an assistant professor at Boston University, first became involved in the study of the Pagan movement in October 1986, when she gave a series of public lectures on the subject of the historical witch trials of New England at the Boston Public Library. She devoted the final lecture to the subject of contemporary Pagan Witches, or Wiccans, who were living in the area, taking her information both from the information published in the works of Margot Adler, Starhawk and Marcello Truzzi, and also from a singular interview that she had carried out with a woman who was \"peripherally associated\" with Paganism. After the lecture, several audience members approached Berger to identify themselves as practicing Wiccans, and it was through them that she came into contact with the New England Pagan community. Three of the Wiccans at the lecture invited Berger to \"participate as a researcher\" as they founded their own coven, the Circle of Light, and she would go on to attend their weekly meetings and festival celebrations for the next two years. At the first open Pagan ritual that she attended, Berger met Andras Corban Arthen, the founder of the EarthSpirit Community (ESC), a Pagan organization open to non-Wiccans which she joined after paying the annual membership fee of $30. Attending many of the ESC's open rituals and festivals, she was introduced to a \"diverse group\" of Wiccans and other Pagans, developing up a contact base in the community. Berger and Arthen subsequently embarked on a project entitled \"The Pagan Census\" in an attempt to gain sociological data from the Pagan community across the U.S. Receiving funding from the Faculty Development Fund at West Chester University, Berger was aided in this project by over 15 students who helped her to code and enter data for the survey. Together, Berger and Arthen wrote and distributed their survey through Wiccan and Pagan organizations across the country, as well as in journals, on the internet and at festivals, with the duo receiving over 2000 responses, providing Berger with one of her main sources of information."

Alyea served as inspiration for the title character in the 1961 film The Absent-Minded Professor. In 1984 he received the Joseph Priestley award."

In 1939 he was forced to leave this position after Ludwig Bieberbach accused him of employing Jewish referees in a notorious letter. He joined the Nazi Party on 1940 April 1, though he seems to have had little sympathy with its philosophy. He published in the journal Deutsche Mathematik.

Born in Sheffield, the son of a journalist who eventually became editor of the Methodist Recorder, Burnett studied at the London School of Economics. After finishing his National Service serving in India with the Intelligence Corps, Burnett joined the BBC's Far Eastern Service at Bush House in 1949. Personal Call, a radio series in which Burnett visited public figures of the day, was later developed into the series he produced for television, Face to Face, which consisted of interviews by John Freeman with prominent people from around the world. Later, he became a documentary maker and made a sequence of films, often shot secretly, about apartheid: South Africa Loves Jesus (1971), outling the attitudes of Christian denominations to the South African government's race policies, and The Colour Line (1971), in which a blood bank labels its stock according to the race of the donor. During the 1970s he made three programmes about the supernatural and ghostly occurrences. These were The Ghost Hunters (1975), The Mystery of Loch Ness (1976) and Out of This World (1977), about UFOs. His cartoons appeared in magazines such as the New Statesman, Private Eye, and The Oldie. The depiction of monks was a speciality; anthologies of his cartoons were published in the 1960s and 1970s in paperback under titles such as \"Top Sacred\" (1960), \"Sacred and Confidential\", and \"Beware of the Abbott\". Hugh Burnett died on 25 November 2011 in Richmond, London, England. He was 87, and was predeceased by his wife, Simone Le Court de Billot (married in 1951) and their three sons."

  "text" : "Hans Motz (1 October 1909 – 6 August 1987) is known for his pioneering work at Stanford University on undulators which led to the development of the wiggler and the free-electron laser. Hans Motz was born in Vienna, and died in Oxford, England. He was survived by his widow Lotte Motz, his daughter Anna Motz, and his protégé of many years, George Purdy. On Oct. 19, 1942, he spoke on the topic “Is a ‘Mechanistic’ View of the Universe Scientifically Tenable?” at the Socratic Club in Oxford. In 1958 he was the Donald Pollock Reader in the Department of Engineering at Oxford University and also a member of St Catherine's Society, Oxford, which became St Catherine's College, Oxford in 1962, at which time he became a Fellow. In 1977 he became the only Full Professor (at that time) in the Department of Engineering. He has written a number of books, including The Physics of Laser Fusion, and a book on microwave theory. He is also a coauthor with Paolo Luchini of the book Undulators and Free-electron Lasers. In the early 1960s he had a grant from Rand corporation to see how much classified nuclear physics he could rediscover using an electronic computer. There was a feeling that freer access would allow the US nuclear power industry to develop more quickly. Using Oxford University's Feranti Mercury computer he was able to rediscover essentially all of the basics, and these were subsequently declassified and taught in university nuclear engineering programs."

In 1895 this group exhibited in the Kunsthalle Bremen and at the Glaspalast in Munich, which brought them national recognition. In 1900 the poet Rainer Maria Rilke travelled to Worpswede and befriended the artist's colony, eventually writing essays about each of its members. He volunteered for the army at the outbreak of the First World War, serving in an infantry regiment. On 10 April 1918 he was severely wounded near Mesen and taken to the hospital in Stettin, where he died. His grave is preserved in the Worpswede Cemetery."

In 1895, as one of the völkisch leaders, Ahlwardt, in a speech before the Reichstag, called Jews \"predators\" and \"cholera bacilli\" who should be \"exterminated\" for the good of the German people. He was a co-founder of the Antisemitic People's Party (Antisemitische Volkspartei); his three-volume work Verzweiflungskampf der arischen Völker mit dem Judentum (The Desperate Struggle of the Aryan Peoples with Judaism; 1890–1892) later influenced Nazi antisemitism. Ahlwardt was member of the German Reichstag during 1892–1902. He died in Leipzig in 1914."

  "text" : "Hartt Partridge Wixom (born 26 April 1933) is a retired American writer who specialized in the topics of hunting, fishing, wildlife and environmental protection, and Latter-Day Saints (LDS) history. His most recent works focus on early LDS history: Jacob Hamblin (2008), Profiles in Mormon Courage (2007), and Critiquing the Critics of Joseph Smith (2005). Another book on early LDS history, Edward Partridge (1998), is a biography of Wixom's great-great-grandfather, the first presiding bishop of the LDS church. In 1998 Wixom gave the annual Juanita Brooks Lecture at Dixie State College in St. George, Utah on the subject of Jacob Hamblin. In 2009 Wixom was the featured speaker at the annual Jacob Hamblin Days celebration in Kanab, Utah. Hunting and fishing books by Wixom include Fishing: The Extra Edge (2006), Personalized Fishing Guide to Utah (2001), Improve the World, Go Fishing (1999), Fishing and Hunting Guide to Utah (1990), Elk and Elk Hunting (1986), and Penny Pinching Guide to Bigger Fish and Better Hunting (1980). Wixom helped organize the first chapter of Trout Unlimited in 1965, serving as its first president. Wixom co-authored the book When Angels Intervene to Save the Children (originally entitled Trial by Terror and first published in 1987; revised and updated 1994) with his wife, Judene Wixom, on the Cokeville Elementary School hostage crisis of 1986 in which their 12-year-old son Kamron was taken hostage; CBS made the television movie To Save the Children in 1994, based on that book. Wixom also published a work of fiction in 1998, Benjamin Lowery and authored the written portion of the graphic arts book Utah, published in 1974. Wixom graduated in 1951 from South High School (Salt Lake City), has bachelor's and master's degrees in communications from Brigham Young University (BYU) in Provo, Utah, and completed some post graduate work in history at the University of Utah. Starting his career in journalism prior to 1960, Wixom served as editor-in-chief of BYU's The Daily Universe. By 1961, the The Deseret News, a daily newspaper in Salt Lake City, Utah, had hired Wixom as an outdoor sports writer. In 1970, Field & Stream magazine named Wixom their Rocky Mountain field editor, a position he held for 5 years. Wixom was the founding editor of his own Utah Outdoors magazine and served as Wyoming editor for Western Outdoors magazine from 1981-86 after moving to that state in 1981. He was also a frequent contributor to the monthly periodicals Outdoor Life and Sports Afield and served as chairman of the Fish Committee, Utah Wildlife Federation. During the 1960s and 70s, Wixom's interests in hunting and fishing brought him into contact with wildlife conservationists and environmentalists working to preserve or restore clean air and water in the American West. As he became increasingly outspoken in favor of federal regulations for clean air and water, The Deseret News named him their environmental editor, the first of its kind in the Mountain States. Wixom collaborated with actor Robert Redford in 1972 to preserve the free flow of the Provo River through central Utah."

  "text" : "Henry Gillard Glindoni (1852 Kennington Lane—20 November 1913 Romford, Essex) was an English painter noted for his depiction of period costumery in historical and genre scenes. He was one of a family of five orphans, his original surname being 'Glindon' and later changed. Glindoni was obliged to take care of himself from the age of 14, which he did by taking various acting and painting jobs. He was drawn into the world of theatre and became a scenery painter, further augmenting his finances by sketching the actors with whom he came in contact. He also tried his hand at porcelain painting. Encouraged to study art, he attended Maurice's Working Men's College and the Castle Street School of Art. Glindoni's speciality was that of 17th and 18th century costume and he was noted for his paintings of Cardinals. He settled in Chadwell Heath some time after 1891, living in a new cottage which still exists at the corner of Mill Lane and Whalebone Lane North. Glindoni frequently exhibited between 1872 and 1904, at the Royal Academy, Royal Institute of Oil Painters, Royal Society of Painter-Etchers and Engravers, Old Water Colour Society, the Society of British Artists in London, and the Royal Society of Artists in Birmingham. He was accepted as a full member of the Royal Society of British Artists in 1879 and an associate of the Royal Society of Painters in Water Colours in 1883. He is buried in Crow Lane cemetery in Romford along with his wife Ruth. His work may be seen at Valence House Museum."

It has been said that the painting Lady Lilith in the Metropolitan Museum of Art was actually painted by Dunn and only \"touched up\" by Rossetti. He left Rossetti's house because he was owed his salary. After Rossetti died, Dunn received the money that was owing to him and he eventually died whilst living with the poets Swinburne and Theodore Watts-Dunton."

  "text" : "Herodias Gardiner (c. 1623 - after 1674), born Herodias Long, was the wife of three early settlers of the Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations, and was also a zealous Quaker evangelist who was whipped in Massachusetts for sharing her religious testimony with others in her former home town of Weymouth. Possibly from Somersetshire in England, and married at the age of 13 or 14 in London, she was unhappily brought to the American colonies by her first husband, John Hicks, where they settled in Weymouth. The couple had two known children, and moved to the Rhode Island Colony, but she soon separated from her husband, and looking for maintenance, settled in Newport with George Gardiner, with whom she lived for about 20 years as his common-law wife. In 1658 she and a friend made a difficult journey to Massachusetts to present their Quaker message, and they were brought before the Governor, then whipped and imprisoned. A few years later, in 1665, Herodias left Gardiner, and went to live with prominent and wealthy John Porter in the Narragansett country west of the Narragansett Bay. She left behind many court records documenting her marital turmoils. She had nine known children with her first two husbands, and has many descendants."

  "text" : "Henri L'Estrange, known as the Australian Blondin, was an Australian successful funambulist and accident prone aeronautical balloonist. Modelling himself on the famous French wire-walker Charles Blondin, L'Estrange performed a number of tightrope walks in the 1870s, culminating in three walks across Sydney's Middle Harbour in 1877. He remains the only tightrope performer ever to have walked across a part of Sydney Harbour. L'Estrange was an early balloonist, and attempted a series of flights in the early 1880s – one being successful, one ending in Australia's first emergency parachute descent, and the last culminating in a massive fireball causing property damage, personal injury and a human stampede. He tried to return to his original career of tightrope walking but, with new forms of entertainment, humiliating falls and other Blondin imitators, he found success elusive. Public benefits were held in his honour to recoup financial losses and he dabbled in setting up amusement rides but ultimately he faded from public attention and was last recorded to be living in Fitzroy, Victoria in 1894."

He was co-author of the protest \"Word and Affirmation of Altona Pastors amid the Misery and Confusion of Public Life\" (11 January 1933), which rejected a pact with National Socialism and thus became a preliminary step toward the theological declaration of the Barmen Confessional Synod. From 1945 to 1948, Asmussen presided over the Evangelical Church Chancellery, and from 1949 to 1955, he was dean (German: Propst) in Kiel; he was a promoter of ecumenical dialogue.

He served in France under the earl of Arundel in March 1344 and in August 1346 was at the Battle of Crécy. He then transferred to service in Gascony under the earl of Lancaster. In July 1352 he was made joint warden of the marches towards Scotland, and in September 1355 keeper of Roxburgh Castle and sheriff of Northumberland for two years. In 1356 he took part in the invasion of Scotland that followed Edward Balliol's surrender of the kingdom and crown of Scotland to Edward III. In July 1356 he was once again joint warden of the marches and then took part in the negotiations that led to the treaty of Berwick of October 1357.

Born in Dülken, Germany, he attended the University of Bonn and the University of Munich, finally graduating from Williams College in 1938. After serving in the United States Army during World War II as a second lieutenant, he received his M.A. (1939) and PhD. (1947) from Harvard University. He taught at Johns Hopkins University from 1947 to 1964, during which time he was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1956. He joined the department of history at Yale University in 1965 and remained there until his retirement in 1986. Gatzke anonymously funded a prize, awarded biennially by the American Historical Association, in honor of Paul M. Birdsall (who was Dean of Students at Williams when Gatzke arrived there in the late 1930s) for the best work in the field of European military or strategic history since 1870. His involvement was revealed upon his death in 1987. He is remembered by a named professorship in his honor (the Hans W. Gatzke '38 Professor of Modern European History) at Williams College."

He studied medicine at the University of Vienna, where he later served as an assistant to ophthalmologist Carl Ferdinand von Arlt (1812–1887). In 1877 he attained the chair of ophthalmology at the University of Giessen, two years later relocating to the University of Erlangen. In 1886 he was named director of the eye clinic at Prague, and in 1891 succeeded Ernst Adolf Coccius (1825–1890) at the University of Leipzig, where he served as director of the ophthalmological clinic for the remainder of his life. Sattler distinguished himself in his histological and histopathological research of the eye, in particular his work involving the choroid and conjunctiva. He published works on trachoma, operative treatment of myopia, pulsating exophthalmos, Basedow's disease, tuberculosis and inflammatory conditions involving the optic nerve. His treatise on Basedow's disease was included in the Graefe/Saemisch Handbuch der gesamten Augenheilkunde."

  "text" : "Henry Edward Murray-Anderdon (8 December 1848 – 11 December 1922) was a cricket administrator who served as the secretary and guiding spirit in the early days of Somerset County Cricket Club and later as the club president. Murray-Anderdon became honorary secretary of Somerset after the club had fallen out of first-class cricket in 1885; in five years, he had established it on a sounder financial footing, recruited illustrious players such as Sammy Woods, overseen the leasing of (and later the acquisition of) the current County Ground at Taunton, and, in 1891, seen the team restored to first-class status in the newly organised County Championship. He remained as honorary secretary until 1910 and then became Life President from 1915 until his death. Murray-Anderdon was the son of the rector of Chislehurst, Kent, the Rev Francis Murray, and his wife Fanny, who was a Miss Anderdon. He was educated at Marlborough College where he did not make the cricket team. He inherited a large house at Henlade, near Taunton, from an uncle in 1873 and, changing his surname to Murray-Anderdon, thereafter lived the life of a country gentleman and man of activities. \"He had a commanding, aristocratic manner,\" says one history of Somerset cricket. From 1882 to 1885, Somerset played sufficient fixtures against other county sides for its matches to be regarded as first-class, but in the last of these seasons it was beset by a poor playing record and amateurish organisation: only nine players turned out in the match against Hampshire, and first-class status was withdrawn after 1885. Murray-Anderdon became secretary of the club at this point: he proved to be \"a fine administrator and his job was to shake the place up\". Somerset took a 19-year lease on the County Ground at Taunton and bought it outright in 1896, and Murray-Anderdon instituted the policy, pursued well into the second half of the 20th century, of trawling the universities and further afield for potential playing recruits who, as amateurs, would not normally need payment; among his early successes was the Australian, Sammy Woods. In 1890, as a second-class county, Somerset won 12 out of 13 fixtures with the bigger teams and were re-admitted to first-class status in 1891, including, by that time, a properly constituted County Championship. Murray-Anderdon remained as unpaid honorary secretary into the early years of the 20th century, working for most of that period alongside Woods, who was described as \"captain and secretary\", a frequent fiction in amateur times that enabled Woods to be paid (for the secretarial duties) while retaining amateur status as a player; Murray-Anderdon was also a member of various MCC committees. Although \"cricket, along with fishing, was his passion\", Murray-Anderdon also involved himself in other worthy activities. He was president of the Somerset Football Association. In 1896, he was elected as one of two representatives for the Diocese of Bath and Wells on a trust fund for distressed clergy."

He was born in Michel, British Columbia, the son of Walter McKay and Ann Cartmell, and was educated there. In 1947, he married Jean Cameron Hooker. McKay ran unsuccessfully for a seat in the provincial assembly in 1953. He was defeated when he ran for reelection in the newly created riding of Kootenay East in 1966. After leaving politics, McKay was named a county court judge for Nanaimo. In 1971, he was named to the Supreme Court of British Columbia. In passing sentence on convicted child killer Clifford Olson, McKay said \"There is no punishment in a civilized society that is adequate ... it is my considered opinion that you should never be granted parole ...

His governorship began in 1644, when he succeeded his father 'Arab Hasan Pasha, until his imprisonment in 1662. He served intermittent terms as governor of Nablus and Jerusalem and as amir al-hajj. Husayn Pasha's rule was marked by a period of prosperity that temporarily established Gaza as the virtual capital of Palestine. He maintained amiable relations with the Bedouin tribes of the Negev, the local Christian communities and the French consul in Jerusalem. In 1662, Husayn Pasha was imprisoned by the Ottoman imperial authorities and was executed in his Istanbul prison cell later that year, or in 1663."

He fought in the Four Days Battle in June 1666 where he was assigned to Sir William Berkeley [one of two Vice-Admirals killed in the battle]’s division. He was dismissed from the service after the battle. According to the genealogical data of the records of the Borough of Weymouth and Melcombe Regis, Henry Cuttance was admitted a freeman of the town by birth on 2 December 1659.

  "text" : "Henry Jean-Marie Levet (1874–1906) was a French diplomat. Levet was a poet who worked in the French consular service in his late twenties but in his early twenties he was only a couple of years older than the more famous poet Leon-Paul Fargue, and they knew each other as young men in the café scene in Paris. Fargue related that Levet loved maps, compasses, and wore beautifully cut English-style suits. He was always willing to help out those with less money. In order to indulge his eagerness to travel, Levet joined the consular service and served in India, Vietnam, the Philippines and finally in Argentina. He sent his charming verses home to be published in popular journals. In the introduction to the French edition of Levet’s Poèmes (Maison des Amis des Livres, Paris, 1921; Gallimard 2000), the great French poet Valery Larbaud relates that he read and memorized Levet’s verses, and hoped to meet him when he came back to France on leave. Levet came home sooner than expected with a disease that left him unable to speak. He tried to recuperate on the Riviera, but his strength left him and he died soon after. Fargue and Larbaud made a literary pilgrimage to Levet’s parents’ home in Montbrison (a small city between Italy and Nice), some five years after Levet’s demise. Larbaud commented that if one is too late to meet someone, one can be met instead by a pale featureless head on blind white stone. Nevertheless, he felt that something of Levet remained in his parents’ house, especially in the room set aside for memorabilia. There were photographs from Maharajas with dedications in English, and a flag from a nearly unknown country. Fargue and Larbaud considered Levet to be the next important link in the chain of modernism that runs from Whitman to Rimbaud to Laforgue. Larbaud wrote, ‘I dreamed of a poet, a fantasist, sensitive to the diversity of race, peoples, countries, for whom everything or nothing would be exotic (it amounts to the same thing), very ‘international,’ a humorist, capable of doing Whitman tongue-in-cheek, giving a comic note of joyous irresponsibility, which was lacking in Whitman. At bottom, I was looking for a successor to Laforgue, Rimbaud, and Whitman. And here I seem to have found him ... Henry J.-M. Levet.’ Globe-trotting cosmopolitan poets such as Blaise Cendrars and Paul Morand, or so says the Larousse Dictionary of Contemporary Poetry, ‘cannot hide what they owe him.’ Even the surrealists, particularly Philippe Soupault and Paul Eluard, seem to have taken a cue from Levet. Levet wrote a novel called The Benares Express, but it was withheld from publication by his parents, and is now presumably lost, aside from a few mentions in the letters and writings of the period. Other than that novel, what is all the more astonishing about Levet’s influence is that, aside from a few garbled pages of juvenilia along symbolist lines, Levet’s mature work amounts to 11 pages. Those 11 pages, known as ‘Cartes Postales’, or ‘Postcards’, were all published here in Jacket 18 magazine for the first time in English in their entirety by Kirby Olson. They are in the same order that they were originally published by Maison des Amis des Livres in 1921."

Helena and William had one son, the future Duke, Otto I, The Child of Brunswick-Lüneburg (1204–1252). After the early death of her husband, Duke William, in 1213, her brother Emperor Otto IV took over the reign of Lüneburg, as regent for William's son Otto the Child. Otto was appointed heir of the allodial property of the Guelphs by his uncle Henry the Elder. Duchess Helene died in 1233 and was buried in the Benedictine monastery of St. Michael in Lüneburg."

  "text" : "Herbert Spencer Clarke (July 10, 1927 – January 8, 2012) was an American weatherman and television journalist. Clarke spent thirty-nine years, from 1958 to 1997, as a reporter for WCAU-TV in Philadelphia. Under Clarke, WCAU became the first local television station in the Philadelphia media market to use radar in its weather coverage, beginning in 1982. Clarke was born in 1927 and was a native of Eden, North Carolina. He received a bachelor's degree in journalism from Bowling Green State University. Clarke also served in the United States Navy. He began working in broadcasting in 1948 in Eden, North Carolina. Clarke then worked as a radio and television reporter at WRVA-TV in Richmond, Virginia (now WWBT) before joining WCAU-TV in 1958. Clarke joined the staff of WCAU on November 24, 1958, as an on-air weatherman and reporter, using the nickname \"Atlantic Weatherman.\" Though most known for weather reports, Clarke also co-hosted Philadelphia regional coverage of events, such as the Mummers Parade, and previously anchored WCAU's Sunday night news. He was also assigned the station's science and health stories as well. WCAU remained a CBS affiliate until 1995, when it switched affiliations to NBC. Clarke retired from WCAU in 1997. He served as the President of the Broadcast Pioneers of Philadelphia from 1988 and 1989. Clarke was named the Broadcast Pioneers of Philadelphia's Person of the Year in 1991 and was inducted into their Hall of Fame in 1994. In 2007, Clarke was a recipient of the National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences (NATAS) Governor's Award. Herb Clarke died on January 8, 2012 at the Beaumont assisted living facility in Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania of complications from Alzheimer's disease at the age of 84. Clarke was survived by his wife, Barbara Cawthorne Clarke, whom he had been married to for 56 years;daughter, Ann Million; two sons, John and Robert; and three grandchildren. Clarke and his wife had been long term residents of Haverford, Pennsylvania, before moving to the Beaumont retirement community in 2004. His funeral was held at the Bryn Mawr Presbyterian Church."

  "text" : "Hortense Hogan Child Smith (May 6, 1919 – May 17, 2012) was the First Counselor to Ruth H. Funk in the General Presidency of the Young Women organization of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) from 1972 to 1978. Hortense Hogan was born in Thatcher, Idaho. She attended Utah State University and earned a degree from LDS Business College. In 1939, she married Robert Rumel Child, the only son of Thomas B. Child. As such she was connected with Child's creation of Gilgal Sculpture Garden. She was the head of the Friends of Gilgal Garden that worked to preserve the unique art project from destruction by a housing development. Through her efforts the garden was purchased by the Friends of Gilgal organization and turned over to the care of Salt Lake City for preservation. Hortense and Robert had two children. After Robert Child died, Hortense married Eldred G. Smith in 1977. Smith died on May 17, 2012, shortly after her 93rd birthday."

  "text" : "Harvie Maitland Conn (April 7, 1933 – August 28, 1999) was professor of missions at Westminster Theological Seminary, Philadelphia. He was a missionary in Korea prior to his appointment at WTS and also served as editor of Urban Mission. Conn was born in Regina, Saskatchewan and studied at Calvin College and Westminster Theological Seminary. A Festschrift was published in his honor: The Urban Face of Mission: Ministering the Gospel in a Diverse and Changing World (ISBN 087552401X). It included contributions from William Dyrness and Charles H. Kraft. D. G. Hart argues that Tim Keller's views about \"word and deed ministries\" are influenced by Conn's \"theory and practice of urban missions and ministry.\"Tim Keller also cites Conn as saying that Jonah 2:9 is the central verse in the whole Bible: 'Salvation is of the LORD'."

  "text" : "Father Henry Gravrand (France, 1921 - Abbey of Latrun, Palestine, 11 July 2003) was a French Catholic missionary to Africa and an anthropologist who has written extensively on Serer religion and culture. He was one of the leading pioneers of interfaith dialog and believed that African religion was the \"'first covenant between God and man\". His works about the Serer people are cited by other historians and scholars writing on Serer history, religion and culture, for instance Martin A. Klein, Charles Becker, Alioune Sarr, Marguerite Dupire, Issa Laye Thiaw, etc. Papa Massène Sene argues that his approach lacks scientific rigor and include fundamental linguistic and historical errors. Alioune Sarr noted that Gravrand reported an oral tradition describing what he called the \"Battle of Troubang\", a dynastic war between the two maternal royal houses of Ñaanco and the Guelowar,an off-shot and relatives of the Ñaanco (Nyanthio or Nyanco) maternal dynasty of Kaabu, in modern-day Guinea Bissau. According to Charles Becker, Gravrand is confusing a description of the 1867 (or 1865) Battle of Kansala."

His wife, Hariataa Pomare, was a Ngāpuhi woman from Te Ahuahu, near Ohaeawai, who was the daughter of Pikimana Tutapuiti. Hare and Hariata Pomare were members of a party of Māori people who travelled to England in a tour organised by William Jenkins, a Wesleyan lay preacher. The members of the tour party quarrelled with Jenkins, as the Māori members of the tour travelled steerage class of the ship in unpleasant conditions and without fresh food, while Jenkins travelled first class. The Māori members continued to argue with Jenkins in England over his management of the tour and he eventually abandoned them. The Māori members of the tour performed songs and dances at receptions. They were presented to the Prince and Princess of Wales and meet Queen Victoria in July 1863 at a reception at Osborne House, on the Isle of Wight. Hare Pomare and his wife Hariata stayed with Elizabeth Fairburn Colenso in Tottenham, London. On 26 October 1863 Hariata gave birth to Albert Victor, who was named after the Queen's deceased husband. On 4 December 1863 Elizabeth accompanied Hariata and Hare Pomare as interpreter on a visit to Queen Victoria at Windsor Castle to present Albert Victor. Queen Victoria was made the god-mother of Albert Victor Pomare. The family returned to New Zealand travelling first class with the Queen paying their fares, and they arrived in Auckland on 7 May 1864. Hare Pomare is believed to have died in Wellington later that year. Hariata remarried. Albert Victor Pomare was educated at St Stephen's school in Auckland."

  "text" : "Hosea T. Lockard (June 24, 1920 - December 12, 2011) was an African-American Criminal Court Judge in the U.S. State of Tennessee for Shelby County. He was born in Ripley, Tennessee, and was raised on a farm in the nearby town of Henning to Albert and Lucille Lockard, also of Ripley. He had three brothers, Emmitt, Albert, Jr., and Lorenza, and a sister, Lydia. He grew up during segregation and attended public schools in Memphis, Tennessee, 50 miles southwest of Ripley because African-Americans were not allowed to attend the all-white public schools in Ripley. After serving in the U.S. Army in the early 1940s, Lockard returned to school and completed college at LeMoyne-Owen College in Memphis. He then applied to law school at Memphis State University (now the University of Memphis) but was denied admission because of his race. Lockard attended Lincoln University School of Law in St. Louis, Missouri, which had been established by the Missouri General Assembly as a law school for African-Americans. After graduating in 1950, he returned to Tennessee and was admitted to practice law in 1951. In 1955, Lockard became president of the Memphis Branch of the NAACP and served in that position until 1958. He headed up their legal committee, and during this time, he was joined by Russell Sugarmon, Vasco and Maxine Smith, Jesse Turner, Billy Kyles, the late Benjamin Hooks and A.W. Willis in fighting for and achieving success in the desegregation of Memphis Street Railway Co., public buildings, restaurants and the University of Memphis. He built a successful law practice and became the first African-American member of a Tennessee governor’s cabinet, serving as administrative assistant to Gov. Buford Ellington from 1967 to 1971. He advised President Lyndon B. Johnson on civil rights issues and matters pertaining to race relations. As a judge, he served on the Shelby County Criminal Court from 1975 to 1994 and remained active in the legal community until physical ailments and a stroke slowed him down. Judge Lockard expressed the desire for young African Americans to “not take their rights and privileges for granted” and to view what others went through with a sense of reflection and appreciation. Judge Lockard was married to Ida Walker Lockard for 49 years. He died in his sleep of natural causes."

  "text" : "Haruhiko Kuroda (黒田 東彦 Kuroda Haruhiko, born 25 October 1944), is the 31st and current Governor of the Bank of Japan (BOJ). He was formerly the President of the Asian Development Bank from 1 February 2005 to 18 March 2013. Kuroda has been an advocate of looser monetary policy in Japan. His February 2013 nomination by the incoming government of the Prime Minister Shinzō Abe had been expected. Also nominated at the same time were Kikuo Iwata — \"a harsh critic of past BOJ policies\" — and Hiroshi Nakaso, a senior BOJ official in charge of international affairs, as Kuroda's two deputies. The former governor, Masaaki Shirakawa, left in March 2013. \"There is plenty of room for monetary easing\" in Japan, Kuroda said in a February 2013 interview, adding that the BOJ could go beyond purchasing government bonds to include corporate bonds \"or even stocks\". The yen, which \"has fallen 10% against the dollar since Abe began his campaign in November\", also fell on the news of Kuroda's nomination. However, the new governor is \"expected to use his experience as Japan’s top currency official until 2003 to rebut overseas criticism that Tokyo is using easy monetary policy to drive the yen lower, triggering a war of competitive currency devaluation\". Bloomberg quoted Stephen Roach, a senior fellow at Yale University, as saying about Kuroda's goals: “It’s a strong pledge from a well-intended man, but I’m not convinced it’s going to work.\" When Kuroda was asked the same question in his assumption of office's press conference on March 21, Kuroda said the BOJ's role is to stabilize prices, and stabilizing exchange rates is the role of the Ministry of Finance. He also said that BOJ's \"Quantitative and Qualitative Monetary Easing\" policy does not intend to devalue, aiming to grow out of deflation by targeting inflation. Although there was opposition from developing countries, the policy was accepted by the other developed countries in the G20 summit. However, G20 members emphasized to Japanese policymakers that it must be used domestically while highlighting the importance of a Japanese effort to reduce government debt. In early 2016 after a stretch of global market weakness, Kuroda led Japan's move into negative interest rates. The BOJ had already pushed its balance sheet from 35% to 70+% of GDP since 2013 and was continuing to buy ¥80 trillion (over $600 billion) of securities each month. “Risks were growing that the slowdown in the Chinese, emerging and resource-producing countries, which has caused volatility and instability in financial markets since the beginning of the year, may hurt confidence among domestic [Japanese] companies,” Kuroda was quoted as saying at the time of the interest-rate cut."

As director of the Emerald Hill Theatre Company and the Victorian Travelling Theatre, he was an influential figure in the Victorian theatrical scene, and played a significant role in promoting the arts in regional Victoria and South Australia. As an actor, Baigent was known for many parts on Australian film and television, including roles in the film Gallipoli and the television series The Flying Doctors, and a memorable introductory monologue at the beginning of the film Mad Max 2. He was director of the Council of Adult Education in Adelaide, South Australia for many years, and founded the Arts Train, an innovative travelling arts project that toured small towns throughout South Australia and Victoria.

After graduating, Dessauer worked in the paint factory of his uncle Leo Vossen in Aachen and took over the management of the Paris branch of this company for two years. In 1896 he spent a year at a pulp mill in Wisconsin, USA, and from 1897 he worked in the Aschaffenburg Buntpapierfabrik with his father. After his father's death in 1900 he joined the management of that company. Dessauer was a member of several associations and industrialists of the Economic Committee of the BVP (Bayerische Volkspartei), and he was also a member of the Aschaffenburg City Council for the Party. For his services he was awarded the title Kommerzienrat (commercial councillor). His oldest son Hans Dessauer Jr., born in 1905, emigrated from Germany to the United States in 1929 and became known as John H. Dessauer. His son Guido Dessauer, born 1915, joined the management of the family company in 1945."

Breijer was educated at Amsterdam University being awarded a doctorate in mathematics and physics in 1893. The same year he was appointed as lecturer at the Staatsgymnasium in Pretoria. He supported the idea of establishing a Staatsmuseum (later the Transvaal Museum) and was a trustee on its first board in 1893. He also functioned as honorary curator until 1897 when a suitable director was found. Breijer taught natural science and mathematics at the Pretoria Normal College (later the University of Pretoria) and in 1905 was appointed to the chair of mathematics at the Johannesburg School of Mines and Technology, which later became the Witwatersrand University. He remained there until 1913 when he succeeded Dr. J. W. B. Gunning as director of the Transvaal Museum. Breijer was often associated with the Dutch-born entomologist Cornelis Jacobus Swierstra (1874-1952) in his collecting done in South Africa and Mozambique, and was succeeded as director by him in 1921. He is commemorated in Thesium breyeri, Pavetta breyeri, Blepharis breyeri and former species in Warburgia, Disa, Barleria and Cleome. Breijer's son, J.W.F. Breijer, served with the SAP at Namutoni in South West Africa, and maintained a unique flora collection from that country."

  "text" : "Henry Piet Drury van Asch CBE (4 May 1911 – 27 October 1996 Hastings, New Zealand) was a New Zealand aviator, aerial photographer and surveyor. He was born in Waitotara, Wanganui, New Zealand in 1911. The first aircraft van Asch bought, in 1936, was a Monospar ST-25 Universal which he named Manu Rere (registered as ZK-AFF). The Monospar was retired in 1943 and Aerial Mapping took delivery of a Beechcraft AT-11 Kansan, which had been imported by the RNZAF.In 1967 the old Monospar was restored and put back into flying condition, it was the last remaining plane of its sort. After having logged about 6700 commercial flying hours van Asch retired in 1980. Van Asch was one of the prime figures responsible for the transformation of New Zealand's cadastral maps into accurate topographical maps. He was an honorary member of the New Zealand Institute of Surveyors and a Fellow of the Royal Aeronautical Society. In the 1953 Coronation Honours van Asch was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire for services to civil aviation, especially in connection with aerial survey. He was promoted to Commander of the Order of the British Empire for services to aerial mapping in the 1979 Queen's Birthday Honours. Van Asch died on 27 October 1996 in Hastings. He was survived by his wife, two daughters and a son."

Of Māori descent, he identified with the Ngāti Kahungunu and Rangitāne iwi. He was born in Whakatomotomo, Wairarapa, New Zealand in about 1843. From 1892, he was a member of Te Kotahitanga, the autonomous Māori Parliament. One of six candidates in the 1893 election for the Eastern Maori electorate, he came second to the incumbent, Wi Pere. He was one of the owners of Lake Wairarapa and took a stance supportive of the government's view of land ownership. His support was acknowledged by him being appointed captain of a volunteer force, and he was to train 18 Māori as a guard of honour for Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee. Richard Seddon, Tunuiarangi, and his guard of honour travelled to London on the Ruahine. In conjunction with Wi Pere and James Carroll, he had secretly prepared a petition concerning the remaining land held by Māori to remain in their ownership in perpetuity. Scottish MP John McAusland Denny presented the petition on Tunuiarangi's behalf to Joseph Chamberlain, and Tunuiarangi received an invitation from the Parliament of the United Kingdom to explain his concerns. The petition caused great embarrassment to the Liberal Government of New Zealand, and is regarded as one of the reasons of the government passing the Native Lands Settlement and Administration Bill 1898, the precursor to the Maori Lands Administration Act 1900. From 1912, he lived in Carterton. After a long illness, he died on 29 March 1933, and was survived by a daughter and son from the first of his three wives."

Although information about Hatami's arrest and trial was never released, the U.N. report noted that political prisoners of all types were included in the executions: \"Most of the alleged victims were members of the Mojahedin. However, members of the Tudeh Party, People's Fedaiyan Organization, Rahe Kargar, and Komala Organization and 11 mollahs were also said to be among the alleged victims.\" Hatami had been an active member of the Tudeh Party."

She represented Ethiopia in the event at the 2012 Summer Olympics, coming fifth. Born in Gojjam, she is the younger sister of Wude Ayalew, a medallist at the 2009 World Championships in Athletics. Hiwot made her first impact in athletics in 2010. She came third over 5000 metres at the Ethiopian Championships then won the Addis Ababa Cross Country race in December. She opened 2011 with a win at the Cross Ouest-France in Le Mans, France. Running for the Commercial Bank of Ethiopia, she took second place at the Jan Meda Cross Country in 2011 which gained her a place on the national team. In her first international appearance she finished eleventh in the women's senior race at the 2011 IAAF World Cross Country Championships. She competed on the 2011 IAAF Diamond League track circuit and established herself further. She ran a 5000 m best of 14:49.36 minutes for eighth at the Bislett Games then came seventh at the Meeting Areva. Visa issues meant she arrived hours before the start of the London Grand Prix, but she proved herself in the steeplechase with a personal best of 9:23.88 minutes to take second place behind Milcah Chemos Cheywa. Although she missed a place at the World Championships, she was present for the 2011 All-Africa Games and won the silver medal in the steeplechase behind Kenya's Hyvin Jepkemoi, being edged out at the line by a fraction of a second. Following her track season, she had fourth-place finishes at the Great Ethiopian Run 10K road race and the Cross de Atapuerca. At the start of 2012, she finished as the runner-up behind her sister at the Elgoibar Cross Country. A win at the national championships earned her a spot on the Ethiopian team for the 2012 London Olympics and she managed to finish fifth in the Olympic steeplechase final. She also performed well on the 2012 IAAF Diamond League circuit, having top three placings at the Bislett Games, Prefontaine Classic and Weltklasse Zurich meets. At the end of the year she won the Cross de Atapuerca. She won at the 2013 Jan Meda International to gain selection for Ethiopia at the 2013 IAAF World Cross Country Championships."

  "text" : "Sir Hepi Hoani Te Heuheu Tukino VII, KBE (26 January 1919 – 31 July 1997) was the seventh paramount chief of the Ngāti Tūwharetoa iwi, a Māori tribe of the central North Island, and an influential figure among Māori people throughout New Zealand. Hepi Te Heuheu was born in Wellington, New Zealand, on 26 January 1919. He was the son of Hoani Te Heuheu and his wife Raukawa Tawhirau Maniapoto, the daughter of Te Maniapoto and Wakahuia of Taupo. He married Pauline Hinepoto (Tuutu) Te Moanapapaku, of Ngāti Tūwharetoa and Ngāti Maru descent, and had six children. After his father died on 27 April 1944, Hepi succeeded him as paramount chief of Ngāti Tūwharetoa at the age of 25, in a ceremony conducted by the Māori King, Korokī. In his early years as chief, he concentrated on promoting the tribe's economic foundation through the development of farms and forests. From 1956 until his death he was chair of the Tūwharetoa Trust Board. His leadership led to the tribe becoming one of the strongest and most independent Māori tribes. He was also a member of the board of the Tongariro National Park. He was a key figure in forming the Federation of Maori Authorities in 1985–86 and was its first chair. He led representations to the government in 1985 which resulted in the principles of the Treaty of Waitangi being protected in the State Owned Enterprises Act 1986. He was instrumental in the formation of the National Maori Congress in 1990. He led the congress in a successful effort to retain and increase the number of Māori electorates, and in opposition to the Runanga Iwi Act 1990 which was repealed in 1991. Then in 1995 he played a leading role in opposing the government's proposal to set a capped budget (\"fiscal envelope\") for the settlement of historic Treaty of Waitangi claims. Georgina te Heuheu, wife of his younger son Timoti (\"Timi\"), entered Parliament for the National Party in 1996. Te Heuheu died at Taupo Hospital on 31 July 1997 and was buried at Waihi. His eldest son Tumu succeeded him as paramount chief of Ngāti Tūwharetoa. Te Heuheu's wife Pauline died in August 1998. In the New Year Honours 1979 Te Heuheu was appointed as a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire."

  "text" : "Henry Hugh Proctor (b. December 8, 1868 near Fayetteville, Tenn., d. 1933) was a minister of the First Congregational Church in Atlanta, the second-oldest African American Congregational church in the United States. He was also a noted author and lecturer. Proctor was born to parents who were former slaves, and he dug ditches and preached sermons to pay for his degree from Fisk University, graduating in 1891. In 1894, he received a Bachelor of Divinity degree from Yale University and was ordained into the Congregational ministry. Proctor became pastor of the First Congregational Church in Atlanta. In 1903, Proctor joined George Washington Henderson, president of Straight University, a black college in New Orleans, to found the National Convention of Congregational Workers Among Colored People, and Proctor became its first president. In 1904, Clark University awarded Proctor a Doctor of Divinity degree. After the Atlanta Race Riot in 1906, Proctor and a white attorney worked together to quell remaining tensions and formed the Interracial Committee of Atlanta. In the church, Proctor provided amenities lacking in the black community such as a library, a kindergarten, an employment bureau, a gymnasium, a ladies’ reading parlor, a music room, counseling services, and a model kitchen and sewing room for girls. He also helped open the first housing facility for young employed black women. Proctor was a strong believer in self-improvement. Proctor also founded the Atlanta Colored Music Festival Association, with concerts attended by both races, segregated but under one roof, believing that music could quell racial animosity. This festival continues to the present day as the Atlanta Music Festival. In 1919 after World War I, Proctor ministered to black American troops in Europe. Afterwards he led the Nazarene Congregational Church in Brooklyn, the place where Proctor lived the rest of his life. He died in 1933 of blood poisoning."

Stawell was the only son of the statesman Henry Bilson-Legge, Chancellor of the Exchequer (himself a son of William Legge, 1st Earl of Dartmouth) by his marriage on 11 September 1750 to Mary Stawell (died 29 July 1780), the daughter of Edward Stawell, 4th Baron Stawell, who on her father's death succeeded to her father's estates but not his title. In 1760 she was created Baroness Stawell, of Somerton in the County of Somerset, in her own right, and this was the peerage later held by her son. After his father's death in 1764 Stawell's mother married the Earl of Hillsborough (created Marquess of Downshire after her death), thus providing Stawell with a step-father. Stawell came into a large fortune and was a patron of the Turf. He bred an Epsom Derby winner, Blucher. In 1779, Stawell married Mary Curzon, daughter of Assheton Curzon, 1st Viscount Penn, and they had one daughter, Mary (1780–1864), who married John Dutton, 2nd Baron Sherborne, and went on to have six children, including James Dutton, 3rd Baron Sherborne (1804–1883) and Ralph Heneage Dutton (1821–1892). They had no sons, so that the barony became extinct on Stawell's death in 1820."

  "text" : "Hacker T. Dog, otherwise known as Hacker (age 6) is one of the presenters of British children's television service CBBC. He is a puppet dog from Wigan. and is the half brother of Dodge T. Dog. Alongside fellow presenter Cel Spellman and Australian TV presenter Amberley Lobo, he commentated on the Russia v Belgium match at the 2014 FIFA World Cup for the BBC. Hacker and his brother Dodge started on weekends in May 2009, and did weekdays from July 2009. Both puppets are modelled on the Border Terrier breed of dogs. Hacker is normally portrayed as being in the CBBC Office with his best friend Iain Stirling. When Stirling left in 2013 he presented with Chris Johnson. His fame and popularity resulted in him getting a television show on CBBC called Hacker Time. Hacker also stars in Scoop alongside Shaun Williamson with Iain Stirling as Digby Digworth and newspaper boy respectively. More recently, Hacker appeared as the title character in Tracy Barker Returns, a special series broadcast before Tracy Beaker shows. It starred Hacker as Tracy Barker, a checkout girl. It parodies the Tracy Beaker series, and has a theme tune similar to that of Eastenders. Hacker has made a few guest appearances on CBeebies mainly during the Christmas period. He usually presents in the CBBC office on weekday afternoons. Hacker left the CBBC Office on 19 April 2014 (it is unknown whether he left to film Hacker Time series 4 or not). During this time, numerous guest presenters filled in for him during his usual weekday afternoon slot. These presenters included Shannon Flynn and Dodge T. Dog. Hacker returned on 24 May 2014 (temporarily) and 18 June 2014 (permanently)."

  "text" : "Hori Kingi Tupaea (died 26 January 1881) was a Māori leader of the Te Whānau-a-Tauwhao hapu of Ngāi Te Rangi iwi of the western Bay of Plenty in New Zealand. Tupaea was born probably at Tauranga. He succeeded his father as the main leader of Ngāi Te Rangi in the 1830s. In 1831 he and Te Waharoa of Ngāti Hauā defeated and destroyed a 150-strong war party of Ngāpuhi and Ngāti Kurī led by Te Haramiti at Motiti Island. Tupaea sold land at Maketu to Pākehā trader Phillip Tapsell in the early 1830s and the two were on good terms. In 1836 Tupaea supported Te Waharoa in an attack at Maketu that destroyed a Te Arawa pā and Tapsell's trading station. Tupaea saved Tapsell and his Te Arawa wife. Tupaea did not sign the Treaty of Waitangi when it was twice presented to him in 1840. He was baptised by Anglican missionary Alfred Brown on 30 April 1848, taking the baptismal name of Hori Kingi (George King), and became a mission teacher. In the 1860s he got involved in the Pai Mārire religious movement, which resulted in him spending some time in prison. He became an assessor to the Native Land Court. He died on 26 January 1881 at Rangiwaea Island in Tauranga Harbour and was buried on Matakana Island. One of his sons, Hamiora Tupaea, had an arranged marriage to Arihi Te Nahu of Ngāti Kahungunu, as part of peace-making between Ngāi Te Rangi and Ngāti Kahungunu. One of their sons was Hori Tupaea."

  "text" : "Herbert of Winchester (sometimes Herbert fitzAlberic) was an Anglo-Norman nobleman during the period following the Norman conquest of England. Herbert held land as an under-tenant of the Archbishop of York in the Domesday Survey of 1089. He held the office of chamberlain of the Winchester treasury during the reign of King William II of England, and the office of chancellor and treasurer under King Henry I. During William II's reign, Herbert became a tenant-in-chief, holding lands directly from the king. Herbert may have been a member of the clergy, although it is known that he was married. Most sources state that Herbert married Emma, half-sister of King Stephen and Henry of Blois, Bishop of Winchester, and that she was an illegitimate daughter of Stephen II, Count of Blois, Stephen's father. New research, however, suggests that Emma might have been a daughter of Hunger fitz Odin, who held lands in Dorset in the Domesday survey. Herbert was the father of Herbert and William. William later became Archbishop of York. The younger Herbert became chamberlain to King David I of Scotland around 1156. Herbert was probably dead by 1129–1130, when the Pipe Roll of 1130 records his son as owing a fine for the inheritance of his father's lands, a fine totalling over 353 marks, perhaps as much as 500. However, there is no certain record of Herbert after 1111, and it is possible that he should be considered the same person as \"H. the Chamberlain\", who Abbot Suger of St Denis named as an attempted assassin of Henry I in 1118, and who was punished by the king for the attempt. Suger stated that the would-be-assassin was a chamberlain whose name began with \"H\", and who had been close to the king and received great rewards from the king. Suger added that the king only blinded and castrated the man, which the abbot considered to be mild compared with the hanging that the man deserved. William of Malmesbury does not name the assassin either, but relates that he had custody of the royal treasury. The historian C. Warren Hollister first made the identification between \"H.\" and Herbert, noting that there was only one chamberlain in King Henry I's reign who had a name beginning with \"H\". The main argument against the identification is the fact that most records considered that Herbert remained in office until close to 1129 or 1130. However, charter evidence supports the inheritance of Herbert's lands by his son before 1121."

  "text" : "Horder or Horderus, also known as the Djursland Master, was a Danish stonemason who was active around the end of the 12th century. The name Horderus was found on a tombstone bearing twisted rope in Løvenholm in Norddjurs Municipality and was ascribed, perhaps wrongly, to the artist who decorated churches in the Djursland area of eastern Jutland and on the island of Funen. He is remembered above all for his finely executed baptismal fonts and portals with their shallow reliefs, frequently framed with twisted rope. Given their shallow dimensions, the reliefs may originally have been painted. They depict either Biblical scenes or animals. Horder's main works are the church portals of Rimsø, Vejlby and Ørsted and the font in Holbæk Church. The fonts are typically decorated with ropes along all the edges and foliage in one or two bands on the sides. Their bases also have ropes along the edges enclosing foliage or animal figures. A considerable number of baptismal fonts were once attributed to Horder but it is now thought that his rope-framed designs were copied by one or more other workshops."

  "text" : "Hendrik Claudius aka Heinrich Claudius (c1655 Breslau - after 1697 Holland) was a German painter and apothecary or physician, noted for his 17th-century watercolours of South African plants and animals. Claudius arrived in the Cape Colony from Batavia in 1682 to paint plants of medicinal interest. He joined Ensign Olof Bergh's second expedition in 1683 to Namaqualand in a quest to locate the source of rich copper ore. It is thought that two years later he also joined Governor Simon van der Stel who had the same goal, and that he was responsible for the illustrations in an account of the expedition. He is also regarded as one of the artists contributing to Jacob Breyne's Exoticarum aliarumque minus cognitarum plantarum centuria prima. In all, the Africana Museum in Johannesburg acquired some 433 original watercolours ascribed to him. His work is also held by the South African Library in Cape Town, the British Museum, the library of Trinity College in Dublin and the University library of Marburg in Hesse. Many of the Claudius paintings were copied at the Cape in 1692 for Nicolaes Witsen, Mayor of Amsterdam, who included the copies in his Codex Witsenii. Most of what is known about Claudius stems from his 1685 meeting with the visiting French Jesuit missionary, Father Guy Tachard. After seeing two large volumes of his works, Tachard ventured that Claudius was a competent painter of plants and animals, and that if the books had been for sale he would have purchased them for Louis XIV of France. Some of his further and rather indiscreet revelations in Voyage de Siam led to Claudius' deportation to Mauritius and Batavia by Simon van der Stel - Tachard wrote \"It is from him that we obtained all our knowledge of the country. He gave us a little map made by his own hand.\" This, during a period when the Dutch occupiers of the Cape were extremely suspicious of the French and their designs on the southern tip of Africa."

  "text" : "Helmut Heinrich Schaefer (born February 14, 1925 in Grossenhain, Germany, died December 16, 2005 in Tübingen, Germany) was a German mathematician at home on both sides of the Atlantic. His work centered on functional analysis. His two best known scientific monographs are titled Topological Vector Spaces (1966) and Banach Lattices and Positive Operators (1974). The first of these was subsequently translated into Spanish and Russian. The second made him an internationally recognized and leading scholar in this particular field of mathematics. (Roquette & Wolff, 2006) As teenager Helmut Schaefer attended the Sankt Afra boarding school in Meissen, Germany on a merit based scholarship. In 1943, then 18, he was recruited to serve as interpreter of Anglo-American intelligence. After the war he studied mathematics in Dresden and Leipzig, where he earned his doctorate in 1951 and his habilitation in 1954. Prof. Ernst Hölder served as his academic advisor. In 1956 he accepted an offer from the University of Halle (Saale) as professor of mathematics. Helmut Schaefer, his wife and two children escaped from East Germany to the Federal Republic in 1957, where for one year he worked under Prof. Gottfried Köthe at the University of Mainz. In 1958 he became Associate Professor at Washington State University at Pullman and a few years later he, his wife and now three children moved on to the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor. Then in 1963 he accepted an offer from the University of Tübingen in Germany where he remained until his retirement in 1990. Interrupting this period on several occasions and following retirement in Tübingen he spent a number of one-year terms or semesters as visiting or full professor at various American universities, including the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, the University of Maryland at College Park, the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, Texas A&M University at College Station, and Florida Atlantic University at Boca Raton. In Tübingen he served two terms as department head. He remained active in mathematical research until the year 1999, at which point he completely dedicated himself to his lifelong hobby of astronomy, especially astrophotography. In 1978, Helmut Schaefer was accepted as full member of the Mathematics and Natural Sciences Class of the Heidelberg Academy of Sciences. Earlier, he was admitted to the Academy of Sciences in Zaragoza (Spain). Over the years, he was able to attract many students to functional analysis, combining an expectation of high achievement with a tolerant, humorous, and factual attitude. Ten of his doctoral students went on to become professors at various universities in Germany and the U.S. (Roquette & Wolff, 2006)"

He soon became a professional artist and worked in both New Zealand and Australia. On the outbreak of the First World War, he volunteered for service in the New Zealand Expeditionary Force (NZEF). He participated in the Gallipoli Campaign initially as an sapper but later as a war artist. During his war service and for a time afterwards following his discharge from the NZEF in 1916 he produced a number of sketches and watercolour paintings of Gallipoli. After leaving the NZEF, he worked as an art teacher and conducted a number of exhibitions and lectures around New Zealand. He died in 1922 as a result of extensive burns while rescuing people from a fire which destroyed the Hamilton Hotel, in the city of Hamilton."

His untimely death in London at the age of 49, from influenza, ended an outstanding career. At a time when surgery was limited by the twin fears of shock and infection, Maunsell was among the first to use the antiseptic technique newly introduced by Joseph Lister, and to operate for internal disorders of the pelvis, abdomen, skull and brain. Among his original contributions was a technique for excising bowel tumours and joining the cut ends to restore continuity. He also originated a flap method of amputating the tongue and a new technique for cleft palate operation in which he used woodcarver’s tools when reconstructing the bony defect in the hard palate. He also undertook a world-first operation on the hind brain (cerebellum) to relieve pressure from a life-threatening expanding cyst."

  "text" : "Charles Henry Philippe Lévêque de Vilmorin (26 February 1843 - 23 August 1899) was a French botanist, the son of Pierre François \"Louis\" Lévêque de Vilmorin (1816-1860) and Elisa Bailly (1826-1868), and grandfather of the novelist, poet and journalist, Louise de Vilmorin. Seven generations of the family of Vilmorin contributed greatly to French agriculture for over two hundred and thirty years by their improvements of sugar-beet and wheat - they published more than three hundred and sixty articles on plants in agriculture, horticulture, floriculture and botany. Henry's great-grandfather Philippe Victoire de Vilmorin 1746-1804 and his wife's father, Pierre Andrieux, chief seed supplier and botanist to King Louis XV, revived an old seed-growing firm and named it Vilmorin-Andrieux in 1774. Henry headed the firm from 1873 and was the first to hybridise wheat. As a result, he introduced 18 strains of high-yield wheat while continuing his father’s work on the breeding of sugar beets, and publishing Les meilleurs blés ('The Best Wheat') in 1880 with descriptions of the best winter and spring wheat varieties and their cultivation. This was followed by a supplement published by Vilmorin-Andrieux et Cie in 1909. He also produced a small book Flowers of the French Riviera in 1893. Hooker dedicated the 125th volume of Curtis's Botanical Magazine to him. The standard author abbreviation H.Vilm. is used to indicate this individual as the author when citing a botanical name."

Returned from Africa he lived in Rostock and worked at the Botanical Garden of the University of Rostock where, in spite of difficulties, he played a decisive role in the development of this institution. At the age of 58 he once more went on a journey and travelled to Mexico where once again many new discoveries were due to his efforts. In his honor 70 plants, where of two types, namely Baumiella (mushroom) and Baumia (family of the Scrophulariaceae), a butterfly's species and two species of ants, were named after him.

Reynolds was born in Laxton, Nottinghamshire, the son of John Reynolds, one month after the death of his father, and was brought up by his maternal great-uncle, Henry Revell of Gainsborough, Lincolnshire. He was sent to Beverley Grammar School, and went thence on 17 March 1763 to Lincoln College, Oxford. He migrated to Trinity College, Cambridge, and, after further study at Edinburgh, graduated M.B. at Cambridge in 1768 and M.D. in 1773. He first practised at Guildford, Surrey, and there married Miss Wilson in April 1770. Dr. Huck Saunders advised him to settle in London, and in the summer of 1772 he took a house in Lamb's Conduit Street. On 30 September 1773 he was admitted a candidate of the College of Physicians, and was elected a fellow on 30 September 1774. He was one of the censors of the college in 1774, 1778, 1782, 1784, 1787, and 1792; was its registrar from 1781 to 1783, Gulstonian lecturer in 1775, and Harveian orator in 1776. He did not print his oration. He was elected physician to the Middlesex Hospital on 13 July 1773, and resigned in 1777, when he was elected physician to St. Thomas's Hospital, and so continued till 1783, when his extensive private practice caused him to resign. In 1788 he was asked to attend George III, and in 1797 was appointed physician-extraordinary, and in 1806 physician-in-ordinary. He was challenged by a turbulent licentiate, Dr. Richard Kentish, in November 1787, but the friends of Reynolds properly applied to a magistrate, and the court of king's bench intervened to restrain the violence of Kentish. The fatigues of attending upon the king at Windsor, added to an exhausting examination on the king's illness, during which he had to stand for two hours before the House of Lords, broke down his strength; but it was with great difficulty that Dr. John Latham and Dr. Henry Ainslie persuaded him in May to keep his room. He died at his house in Bedford Square, London, on 22 October 1811 and was buried at St. James's cemetery, Hampstead Road. He was much attached to the College of Physicians, and in his own large practice was known for his great care and lucidity, and for his skill in prescribing."

  "text" : "Hans Kammerlander (born 6 December 1956, Bolzano South Tyrol, Italy) is an Italian mountaineer. He has climbed 13 of the 14 8000m peaks. In 1984, together with Reinhold Messner he was the first climber to traverse two 8000m peaks before descending to base camp. He accompanied Messner, the first man to climb all fourteen 8000m peaks, on successful climbs of Cho Oyu, Gasherbrum I and II, Dhaulagiri, Annapurna, Makalu, and Lhotse, and is a UIAGM mountain guide (English, International Federation of Mountain Guide Associations). Chris Bonington described Messner's relationship with Kammerlander as the most \"amicable\" of Messner's climbing partnerships. In 1990 he made the first ski descent of Nanga Parbat. In 1996 he failed in an attempt to be the first to ski down Mount Everest, after removing his skis and climbing down from 300 metres below the summit, skiing down from 7700m, although he set a then speed record during that attempt of 17 hours to climb from base camp to the summit of Everest via the North Col. Kammerlander also abandoned an attempt to be the first to ski from the summit of K2 when he saw a Korean climber fall to his death. In 2001 Kammerlander announced that he would not attempt to climb Manaslu, necessary to complete all 8000m peaks, due to losing several friends on an attempt on the mountain. In 2012, Kammerlander claimed to be the first man to have climbed the Seven Second Summits, the second highest summits on all seven continents. However, there are claims that Kammerlander may have only climbed the lower West Summit of Mount Logan. It is also claimed that Puncak Trikora, climbed by Kammerlander as part of the challenge, is not the second highest summit in Oceania. In which case Kammerlander will have to climb the main summit of Mount Logan, and climb Puncak Mandala in New Guinea to complete the Seven Second Summits."

Born in Lambeth, Campbell started his performing career appearing in the amateur nigger band and quickly toured London's music hall's during the early 1860s. He decided to leave after a few years and adopted the stage name Herbert Campbell. He joined the minstrel performers Harman and Elston and the trio became known as Harmon, Campbell and Elston. In 1868, Campbell decided to pursue a solo career as a comic vocalist and quickly established himself as a popular music hall comedian. In 1871 he made his first pantomime appearance in King Winter at the Theatre Royal, Liverpool and became a leading pantomime dame over the next decade. In 1882 he formed a successful association with the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, where he appeared alongside Dan Leno in the annual Christmas pantomime, every year until his death in 1904 at age 59."

  "text" : "James Herries Beattie MBE (6 June 1881 – 11 May 1972) was a New Zealand bookkeeper, journalist, historian, ethnologist and bookseller. He was born in Gore, Southland, New Zealand on 6 June 1881. James Herries Beattie (known as Herries) was the son of Scots immigrants James Beattie and Mary Roden (Rodden) Thomson, who arrived in Otago in 1862 and were married in 1874. After some years of farming, James Beattie opened a drapery business in Gore, where he became a well-known figure and was mayor for four terms. Herries was born in Gore on 6 June 1881. He was one of nine children, four of whom died young. The family was deeply religious, Presbyterian at first and Congregational from 1892. Herries, who served 40 years as a Sunday school teacher, later joined the Open Brethren. Alongside strong Protestant convictions, Herries Beattie had a high regard for learning. He had wide interests in literature and natural history but was not gifted academically. After two years at Southland Boys' High School, Invercargill, he left in 1896 to work in the family business as a bookkeeper. This was less from choice than from filial duty, and the tedium of the job served only to further stimulate a powerful desire – present since childhood – to write. His earliest interests had been in local wildlife, especially birds, but as a youth he tried his hand at poetry, short stories and historical novels. The latter reflected an intense curiosity about the history of Otago and Southland. From an early age Beattie had sought out surviving pioneers of European settlement. By the age of 11 he 'was well and truly smitten with the history microbe' and had begun to keep notebooks recording the recollections of pioneer families around Gore and those of the surviving whalers and other old identities at Bluff and Riverton, many of them descendants of marriages into the Maori community. The content and style of Beattie's work can be traced to a number of early influences. His first attempt at a historical work was a biography of his uncle, William Adam of the Taieri Plain. As a young man, Adam had formed a strong acquaintance with Maori of the Henley area, from whom he gained a detailed knowledge of traditions and ways of life. Beattie had spent holidays at Otokia with his uncle, through whom he made his first contacts in the southern Otago Maori community, and began to develop a wide-ranging and lasting interest in the traditional lifestyle and history of Ngai Tahu in southern New Zealand. Another important influence on his nascent career was the Southland pioneer W. H. S. Roberts. He assisted Beattie's 'chronicling apprenticeship' and provided a nucleus of information about the early southern runs and runholders around which Beattie constructed later publications. His interests in placenames, and his style of writing about them, can also be traced to Roberts's Maori nomenclature. Beattie was familiar with the archive-based regional histories of his time, such as T. M. Hocken's Contributions to the early history of New Zealand (Otago), and Robert McNab's Murihiku; but lacking academic training, and with opportunities for collecting first-hand accounts all about him, his writings were based upon interviews, buttressed with information from family notes, genealogies, and newspaper articles amongst more orthodox sources. From such material Beattie developed his own eclectic, anecdotal style. His first publication, in 1898, was a short history of Gore for the Southern Standard, but his earliest major work was a two-part history of early settlers, Pioneer recollections (1909, 1911). Next came his detailed account of southern Maori traditions, history and placenames, based in part on Maori interviews, which was published in the Journal of the Polynesian Society between 1915 and 1922. As this work began to bring him to the notice of professional ethnologists, Beattie sought ways of developing a career closer to his intellectual interests. He first attempted to become a schoolteacher, but failed the examination, then in 1916 he accepted a substantial drop in salary to become a journalist with the Mataura Ensign. By 1919 his publishing success, and the acceptance of papers for the Transactions and Proceedings of the New Zealand Institute, persuaded H. D. Skinner at the Otago University Museum to fund a year-long ethnological survey of southern Maori communities. This was carried out in 1920, and it set the pattern for most of Beattie's subsequent work. On a salary of £5 per week, Beattie travelled by train and bicycle to isolated Maori communities. He gave small presents out of courtesy but did not pay for interviews. As a young man he had relied on his memory to write up conversations, but now he prepared written questions in advance, beginning with 65 and ending up with about a thousand. These were worked through patiently with his informants, who were often 70 to 80 years old; the interviews sometimes took many days to complete. Beattie had a working knowledge of Maori, but no facility in speaking it, so his interviews were conducted in English, though usually with a younger member of the informant's family to translate as needed. His most important contacts were Hone (Teone) Taare Tikao at Rapaki and Eruete Kingi Kurupohatu at Kaka Point, but others who provided much of his information during more than 60 years of periodic fieldwork were Tiemi Haereroa Kupa, Erute Poko Cameron, Taare Reweti Te Maiharoa and Tuhituhi Te Marama. Beattie held the Maori elders in high regard (less so the younger generation), and he seems to have been received well on most occasions. Some clearly regarded him as offering the last chance to preserve substantial areas of traditional knowledge that they thought were not properly appreciated by their descendants. His survey in 1920 was incomplete, however, because he gained little from people who had lived at Otakou and Kaiapoi and he lacked the time and resources to go far beyond Christchurch from his base at Weston, near Oamaru. He also obtained only limited material on Westland and districts to the north. Nevertheless, the 1920 ethnological project was the major achievement of his career. It produced more than 1,000 closely written pages of information; failing to get this published at the time, Beattie mined it extensively for his subsequent books. It was published in 1994 as Traditional lifeways of the southern Maori. In 1921 Beattie was employed as librarian and ethnologist at the New Plymouth Public Library. He had married Mary McKenzie at Gore on 25 May 1910, and concerns about his wife's health brought him south again, to purchase a bookshop in Waimate. He ran that business until 1939, the earliest he could get an acceptable price for it after the depression, but remained in Waimate and, at the age of 59, was finally able to devote himself fully to writing and publication. Besides smaller works and pamphlets aimed at the tourist market, Beattie produced many works of lasting importance. By the end of his career his prolific writing had produced 27 books, of which 12 were on the Pakeha pioneers and 10 on Maori. These included Tikao talks (1939), Maori lore of lake, alp and fiord (1945), and Our southernmost Maoris (1954). The remaining five were on scenic and tourist attractions. These works reveal the strengths and weaknesses of Beattie's approach. He systematically interviewed Maori elders and Pakeha pioneers, and constructed from their recollections detailed accounts of history and ways of life that greatly amplify, and occasionally challenge, other accounts. Yet, in the case of Maori especially, it is not always obvious to which informant material should be attributed, and his original notebooks were not preserved. Beattie used the widest range of material and showed explicitly how his arguments and conclusions were revised as new evidence came to hand, but he did not discriminate between sources of varying quality. His major works retain the scrapbook nature of their origins and are written in a colloquial style. In their time, they were regarded with suspicion by academic historians and anthropologists who preferred the more conventional publications on Maori by Elsdon Best, and this served to reinforce a perception of northern Maori traditions and customs as the New Zealand standard. With the recent acceptance attained by oral history and a resurgence of interest in the distinctiveness of southern Maori, Beattie's research has achieved a more general esteem. In his collection of original material from oral sources in the South Island, he can be compared with Edward Shortland and Walter Mantell, but otherwise has no peer. In 1941 Beattie was awarded the Percy Smith Prize for achievements in anthropology, and in 1967 was made an MBE in recognition of his historical research and writing. Herries Beattie died at Timaru on 11 May 1972. Mary Beattie had died in 1944, and a son also predeceased him. He was survived by three daughters."

He moved to Auckland in 1923 on his father's request, but soon returned to Gisborne, this time for the rest of his life. He stood in the 1943 and 1946 elections in the Gisborne electorate for the National Party, but could not unseat the incumbent, David William Coleman. From 1950, he was Mayor of Gisborne for nine consecutive three-year terms. When he retired in 1977, he was awarded a KBE. He died on 18 May 1994."

Kashgari became the subject of a controversy after he was accused of insulting the Islamic prophet Muhammad in three short messages published through the Twitter social networking service. King Abdullah ordered that Kashgari be arrested \"for crossing red lines and denigrating religious beliefs in God and His Prophet\". Kashgari left Saudi Arabia, trying to seek political asylum in New Zealand. On February 12, 2012, he was extradited from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, back to Saudi Arabia and a Malaysian High Court injunction against his extradition was issued. Whether Kashgari was deported before or after the issuing of the injunction is disputed between Malaysian authorities and Lawyers for Liberty. Saudi authorities jailed him for nearly two years without trial for his Twitter messages."

  "text" : "Henry Hawkey was a lieutenant in the Royal Marines who took part in the last fatal duel between Englishmen on English soil in 1845. Hawkey was born in India in 1820 but came from an old Cornish family. He joined the Royal Marines in 1836 and served in the Mediterranean. In 1840 he was promoted to first lieutenant. In August of the same year he married Isabella Colley, the very attractive daughter of a senior Marines officer. In 1843 Hawkey was posted to the Marines base at Portsmouth, and in May 1845 he and his wife made the acquaintance of James Alexander Seton, a wealthy former cavalry officer. Seton proceeded to try to seduce Isabella. When Hawkey heard about it he confronted Seton in private at a ball and heated words were exchanged - however Seton refused to meet Hawkey in a duel. Hawkey therefore publicly insulted Seton, leaving him little option, by the standards of the day, but to issue his own challenge. His second, Lieutenant Byrom Rowles, RN, brought the challenge to Hawkey early the following morning. Hawkey and his second, fellow Marine Lieutenant Edward Lawes Pym, arrived at the appointed place late in the afternoon: a remote spot on the beach near Gosport, Hampshire. At the first exchange of fire Seton missed but Hawkey's pistol failed to fire. Second pistols were issued and Seton missed again but was hit by Hawkey's shot. The ball entered his hip and travelled through his lower abdomen. He was removed for medical aid, but late died from an infected wound. Hawkey and Pym fled and were not seen again till the following year, when both handed themselves over to the authorities for trial. Despite overwhelming evidence, both were acquitted. Pym went on to have a successful career in the Marines, but for Hawkey things went downhill. Some years after the duel he attacked a fellow officer who was having an affair with his wife, and this time she was a willing participant. Hawkey was court martialled, and although partially cleared was soon afterwards removed from his post. His marriage was destroyed, he fell into debt, and died of TB in London seven years after his court martial, aged 39."

  "text" : "Horst Joachim Arthur Caspar (20 January 1913 – 27 December 1952) was a German actor, prominent in German theatre and film in the 1930s and 1940s. His postwar career was cut short by his sudden death at 39. Caspar was born in Radegast, the son of Max Caspar, an army officer. He had one Jewish grandparent. His mother Emmy died when he was 18 months old, and he was raised by his aunt in Berlin. He attended the Treitschke-Reform-Realgymnasium in Berlin-Wilmersdorf. In 1932 he took his abitur (school leaving exam), but did not go to university, since he had already decided to be an actor. He took acting lessons at the school of Ilka Grüning and Lucie Höflich, along with future stars of German cinema such as Lilli Palmer, Inge Meysel and Brigitte Horney. In the late 1930s Caspar, a handsome young man, appeared regularly in German films and on the stage. He was taken up by the director Saladin Schmitt and became a leading man at his theatre in Bochum, where he performed in plays by Shakespeare and Friedrich Schiller. When he gave his final performance in Richard II in 1939, he received 108 curtain calls. Under the Nazi regime's anti-Jewish Nuremberg Laws, Caspar was classed as a Mischling (mixed race) of the second degree. Despite his part-Jewish ancestry, he continued to work as an actor. This was partly because he enjoyed the protection of Schmitt, who as a homosexual was no friend of the Nazi regime. But he also enjoyed the patronage of Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels. Goebbels personally vetted cases of part-Jewish performers and allowed a number of popular part-Jewish actors to continue working. Caspar's first leading film role was as the young Schiller in Friedrich Schiller – The Triumph of a Genius. In 1940 Caspar joined one of the most important German theatres of the time, the Schiller Theatre in Berlin. In 1942 he performed at the prestigious Burgtheater in Vienna. This was regarded as a \"rare and special privilege\" for a part-Jewish actor in a city where all Jews had been purged from cultural life. In 1943 Caspar was engaged by the director Veit Harlan to play the young August Neidhardt von Gneisenau, who in 1807 defended the Prussian fortress town of Kolberg against the French during the Napoleonic Wars, in Kolberg, an epic film produced on the orders of Goebbels. This was only Caspar's second leading film role, but it is the one for which he is now best remembered, despite the fact that film was finished only shortly before the end of World War II and was seen by few people at the time. On 20 January 1944 Caspar married a 22-year-old actress Antje Weisgerber (1922–2004). She gave birth to a son and a daughter. After the end of the war Caspar moved to Düsseldorf where he again worked in the theatre and in films. His last role was as a reporter named Peter Zabel in crime film called The Orplid Mystery, produced in 1950. In 1952 he recorded an LP of poetry readings, including works by Schiller and Goethe. Caspar died suddenly in Berlin in December 1952 of a stroke at the age of 39. His son Frank died on the day of his father's funeral, aged eight. His widow had a successful film career extending into the 1970s. All three are buried at St Anne's churchyard in Berlin-Dahlem."

  "text" : "Henrik Bernard Oldenland aka Heinrich Bernhard Oldenland (c.1663–c.1697) was a German-born South African physician, botanist, painter and land surveyor, and is denoted by the author abbreviation Oldenl. when citing a botanical name. Henrik was born in Lübeck, a son of Hans Oldenland and Anna Margaretha Nagel. He enrolled at Leiden University in May 1686, and studied medicine and botany for three years, coming under the influence of Paul Hermann who inspired an interest in botany. He arrived in the Cape Colony in 1688 in the service of the Dutch East India Company, and joined Isaq Schrijver's expedition from 4 January to 10 April of 1689. Their route was from Cape Town through the present day towns of Caledon, Swellendam, Riversdale, over Attaquasberg eastwards to the vicinity of Uniondale, on to Willowmore, and finally to about 30 km north-west of Aberdeen. This was the first Cape expedition to penetrate so far into the interior, revealing large numbers of new and interesting plants. Some of these, like Aloe humilis, found their way back to the Company Garden in Cape Town. In 1690 the Heeren XVII recommended that Simon van der Stel employ Oldenland to collect and grow medicinal herbs as he was a very good botanist who had studied medicine with great success. In the same letter they suggested that Jan Hartog be appointed in a similar capacity. As a result Oldenland was given the positions of master-gardener and land-surveyor for the Government in 1693, and Hartog was to be his assistant. Since he now had an assured income, Oldenland could marry Margaretha Hendrina van Otteren, widow of the former garrison bookkeeper, Johann Heinrich Blum. Backed by Simon van der Stel, Oldenland and Hartog invested an enormous amount of work in the Company Garden, turning it into an interesting attraction for foreign visitors. Oldenland also worked on a collection of pressed and mounted specimens, including a catalogue of Latin descriptions. His untimely death at Cape Town in 1697 halted all his botanical work. His widow was married once more, to Hendrik Donker in 1700. After his death, Oldenland's collection was seen and admired by many visitors to the Cape, the first to mention it being Peter Kolbe who stayed at the Cape between 1705 to 1713 and published an account of this period in 1719 in Nuremberg entitled Caput Bonae Spei Hodiernum. In the book he lists indigenous and exotic plants growing there, acknowledging his sources as Hartog and the Herbarium vivum of the late Oldenland. A Herbarium vivum was a compilation of pressed useful plants, such as those having, for example, good timber, edible fruits, tubers and corms, often embellished by paintings and sketches, or inked impressions of leaves or flowers. François Valentijn, a Dutch minister and historian, visited the Cape on four occasions between 1685 and 1714, and wrote of seeing 13 or 14 volumes with copious notes in Latin on each plant. He also recorded that the specimens were unusually attractive, exceptionally well dried and expertly mounted. Donker eventually disposed of the volumes in Holland as they next came into the possession of Johannes Burman, then professor of botany at the University of Amsterdam who drew upon the collection for his Thesaurus zeylanicus. Upon his death they passed to his son, Nicolaas Laurens Burman, who also succeeded him as professor of botany. Nicolaas visited Linnaeus, taking along a large collection of Cape plants, including Oldenland's volumes. Linnaeus refers to Oldenland's work in his writings, pointing out that Oldenland was the second trained botanist to collect at the Cape, the first having been Paul Hermann, Oldenland's mentor. The genus Oldenlandia L. in the Rubiaceae was named in his honour."

  "text" : "Hazem Daouk is an American Lebanese financial economist, known for his work on securities regulation, especially insider trading, earnings management and short selling. He is the Peter J. & Stephanie J. Nolan Associate Professor in the Charles H. Dyson School of Applied Economics and Management at Cornell University. His articles have been cited over 2000 times (Google Scholar). In 1998, his research uncovered the rampant insider trading on the Mexican Stock Exchange. This led to many questions about the value and the enforceability of insider trading laws. The study won the Best Academic Paper Award offered by the International Investment Forum at the University of Chicago. In later research, Daouk conducted a comprehensive survey of insider trading laws and prosecution in about a hundred countries that have a stock market. He then showed that countries that enforce insider trading laws reduce the cost of financing of companies by many percentage points. This is because outside investors no longer require to be compensated for the money they lose from trading with better-informed insiders. On the other hand, having the law without enforcing it, does not do anything. This research was nominated for the Smith Breeden Prize for Best Paper in the Journal of Finance for the year 2002. A little before the Enron scandal, Daouk was investigating whether informational risk associated with accounting earnings quality impacts stock markets around the world (he analyzed financial statements from 34 countries for the period 1985-1998). He found that accounting manipulation in a country, increases significantly the cost of financing of companies and reduces liquidity. Daouk is also known for his research that documents short selling laws and practice in about a hundred stock markets in the world. He shows that when short selling is possible, stock prices are less volatile and there is greater liquidity. However, he does not oppose the temporary restrictions on short selling that were enacted in different countries in reaction to the financial crisis."

Along with Leopold Auer, Johann Wilhelm Zacharias Pickel and Karl Davydov, and later Aleksandr Verzhbilovich, he was a member of the quartet of the Russian Musical Society in Saint Petersburg from 1859–1889. He often appeared as viola soloist performing, in particular, the solo part in Hector Berlioz' Harold en Italie conducted by the composer during his tour of Russia in 1867–1868. Weickmann taught viola at the Saint Petersburg Conservatory from 1863, and was appointed the first Professor of Viola in 1870. Among his students was Vasily Bessel, later a well-known music publisher. Anton Rubinstein wrote his Viola Sonata for Weickmann who premiered the work in 1855 with the composer at the piano. Henryk Wieniawski also composed his Rêverie in F♯ minor in 1855 for Weickmann."

  "text" : "Hieronymus Harder (1523 – April 1607) was a German botanist and teacher of Latin. Harder was born in Meersburg in the Lake Constance region of Germany, but part of his youth was spent in Bregenz, where his father taught from 1535 onwards. In 1560 Harder was examined in Ulm for the post of Latin Master and from 1561 taught at Geislingen an der Steige, and in 1571-72 in Bad Überkingen. From 1578 to shortly before his death he was Preceptor at the Latin school in Ulm, where he died. When not involved in his teaching activities, Harder collected plants in the Swabian Alps and around Lake Constance. From 1562 he put together some twelve volumes of plant collections - these being some of the earliest of the type known as Herbarium vivum in which missing parts of the specimens are represented by coloured drawings. These he passed on to prominent officials, including Duke Albrecht of Bavaria, who gave him financial support and tenure of his post. Names were given in Latin and German, with detailed information added. In addition to wild flowering plants, Harder included mosses, ferns and horsetails, as well as crop plants, such as tomato and tobacco, which only a few decades earlier had been introduced to Germany from America. Eleven of the twelve volumes are known and are kept in Heidelberg (the oldest from 1562 and in private hands), München (1574, 1576), the Vatican (1574), Salzburg (1592), Ulm (1594), Vienna (1599), Linz (1599), Überlingen, Zürich (1592, 1594) and Lindau (1607)."

From 1859 he was an associate of Alexander Herzen and publisher of Kolokol. In 1862 he came to Warsaw as an emissary of the Gromady Rewolucyjnej Londyn of London which he had led along with Świętosławski, Jan Krynski and Ludwik Oborski. It caused an outrage that he had been able to reenter Poland under a British passport using the alias of John Bret. He tried to persuade the peasants to start a national uprising. A participant of the January Uprising, he fell into an ambush during the attack on the van with the money. On November 20, 1862 he was captured by the Russians and was killed shortly afterwards in Warsaw."

Edmund Spevack, a Harvard lecturer on history and literature noted in East European Quarterly that Neumayer represents at best a trend of amateurish German nationalistic writing, and at worst fits in tradition of biased, emotion-driven Nazi-era historiography, and does not deserve to be seen as a reliable scholar. Similarly, Karin Friedrich in The Slavonic and East European Review said that Neumeyer's writing is too emotional for a scholar, uses \"the language of national prejudice and anachronistic references\", and contains numerous factual errors."

  "text" : "Herbert James Paton FBA FSA Scot (30 March 1887 – 2 August 1969) was a Scottish philosopher. He was the son of the Reverend William Macalister Paton, B.D., Abernethy, Perthshire, Scotland, and Jean Robertson Millar. He was educated at the High School of Glasgow, the University of Glasgow, and Balliol College, Oxford. At Oxford he gained a First in Classical Moderations, 1909, and a First in Literae Humaniores ('Greats', a combination of philosophy and ancient history) in 1911. He served in the Admiralty's Intelligence Division, 1914-1919, and became an expert on Polish affairs in which capacity he attended the Versailles conference in 1919. He did governmental work also in the Second World War in the Foreign Research and Press Service (after 1943 the Foreign Office Research Department), 1939-44. He was a member of the Executive Committee of the League of Nations Union, 1939-48. From 1911 to 1927 he was Fellow and Praelector in Classics and Philosophy at [[The Queen's College, Oxford|Queen's College], and Dean of the College, 1917-22. In 1920 he served as Junior Proctor at Oxford. He spent a sabbtical year in the United States of America, 1926-26, where he was Laura Spelman Rockefeller Research Fellow, University of California. There he wrote his first philosophy book, The Good Will. The year after his return to Oxford he resigned his Queen's Fellowship to take up the post of Professor of Logic and Rhetoric at the University of Glasgow, 1927-37. He returned to Oxford as White's Professor of Moral Philosophy (1937–52), a post which carried with it a Fellowship at Corpus Christi College. In 1936 he married Mary Sheila (d.1959), daughter of Henry Paul Todd-Naylor, I.C.S. His second marriage was with Sarah Irene (d. 1964), daughter of Professor W. Macneile Dixon. Paton was a notable Kantian scholar; in this he abandoned his earlier attraction to the philosophy of Benedetto Croce (1866-1952). His works of Kantian commentary included Kant's Metaphysics of Experience (1936), The Categorical Imperative (1947), and The Moral Law (a translation of Kant's Grundlegung zur Metaphysik der Sitten [Foundations of the Metaphysics of Morals], 1785] (1947). Paton delivered the Gifford Lectures at St Andrews, 1949–50; the lectures were published as The Modern Predicament (1955). A short philosophical autobiography appears in 'Fifty Years of Philosophy',Contemporary British Philosophy, Third Series, ed. H.D. Lewis, London : George Allen & Unwin, 1st ed., 1956, 2nd ed., 1961, pp. 337–354. Paton died on August 2, 1969, Perth and Kinross, Scotland."

  "text" : "Heinrich Laehr (10 March 1820 – 18 August 1905) was a German psychiatrist born in Sagan, Silesia. In 1843 he obtained his medical doctorate from the University of Halle, where he was a student of Peter Krukenberg (1787–1865). In 1848 he became an assistant to Heinrich Philipp August Damerow (1798–1866) at the Provinzial-Irrenanstalt outside of Halle. In 1853 he founded Schweizerhof, a mental asylum for women at Zehlenderf-Berlin. Despite numerous obstacles, the institution experienced expansion throughout his lifetime. In 1889 his son Hans (1856–1929) became medical director of the clinic. In 1898 at Zehlendorf he established Haus Schönow, a sanatorium for individuals with nervous disorders. His son Max (1865–1936) served as its director. Laehr was a pioneer of the psychiatric asylum system, known for his talents in organization. He was instrumental in the planning and development of institutions at Lengerich (1864), Eberswalde (1865), Andernach (1867), Schwerin (1874), Merzig (1876), Düren and Owinsk (1880), Berlin-Dalldorf, Grafenberg (1882) and Potsdam (1886). From 1885 he was editor-in-chief of the Allgemeine Zeitschrift für Psychiatrie und psychisch-gerichtliche Medicin. In addition, he was co-founder and chairman of the Deutsche Gesellschaft für Psychiatrie (1867–1898). His name is associated with \"Laehr-Henneberg hard palate\", a reflex associated with pseudobulbar palsy. It occurs when the hard palate is tickled, resulting in contraction of the orbicularis oris muscle and lowering of the upper lip. The reflex is named in conjunction with neurologist Richard Henneberg (1868–1962)."

The company released primarily spoken-word recordings. Due to cash problems, the company was taken over by British Decca in 1957, though with Usill remaining as Managing Director, and being given pretty much full autonomy to run the record label as he wished. After Argo's parent company was absorbed by Polygram in 1979, Usill ended his connection with Argo and established ASV the following year."

He studied medicine at the Universities of Würzburg, Vienna and Berlin, earning his doctorate in 1867. Following graduation he worked under Gudden at the \"Kreis-Irrenanstalt\" (district mental asylum) in Werneck. Later he was appointed director of the Kreis-Irrenanstalt-Deggendorf, and in 1884 succeeded Franz von Rinecker (1811–1883) as director of the mental hospital at Würzburg. After the death of his father-in-law in 1886, he relocated to Munich, becoming head of the Upper Bavarian Kreis-Irrenanstalt. In 1896 he replaced Joseph von Kerschensteiner (1831–1896) in the Ministry, subsequently becoming chief medical officer and chair of the Bavarian Obermedizinalausschuss. Grashey died in Munich."

  "text" : "Schmidt was born in Altenburg, Germany. In 1937, while studying at the University of Leipzig to become a medical doctor, he joined the Nazi party (Member No. 555,294) and the SS (Member No. 23,069). At the outbreak of World War II, Schmidt was first assigned to a Waffen-SS military hospital. In 1941, Schmidt became a camp physician at the Buchenwald concentration camp and then transferred from there to Majdanek concentration camp in June 1942. In October 1943, Schmidt was First Camp Physician at the Gross-Rosen concentration camp and then at Dachau concentration camp in September 1944. Between March 1945 and early April 1945, Schmidt served as camp physician in the Boelke Kaserne subcamp of Mittelbau-Dora in Nordhausen. Near the end of World War II, in the course of the evacuation of staff and prisoners from the Mittelbau, Schmidt wound up at Bergen-Belsen concentration camp on 8 or 9 April 1945. On April 15, 1945, Belsen was liberated by members of the British Army. Schmidt and Alfred Kurzke testified as witness in the Belsen Trial on 25 October 1945. At this time, he was serving as senior doctor in the Bergen-Belsen displaced persons camp set up by the Allies at Bergen-Belsen. He was later arrested and indicted for war crimes in the Dora Trial, which took place in the context of the Dachau Trials between 7 August 1947 and 30 December 1947. Schmidt was accused of allowing inmates to die by withholding medical care. He was acquitted for lack of evidence. Schmidt was again indicted and stood trial at the District Court of Düsseldorf for war crimes committed at Majdanek concentration camp. The third Majdanek Trial (Majdanek-Prozess in German) began on November 26, 1975, and lasted 474 sessions, Germany's longest and most expensive trial. All the defendants had been SS staff at Majdanek. Schmidt was accused of at least eight murders through his participation in the selections for the gas chambers. Due to a lack of evidence, Schmidt was acquitted on March 20, 1979, and released on 19 April 1979. Since 1985, Schmidt lived in Uetze, Germany. He died in Celle in 2000."

  "text" : "Hypolite Dupuis (October 16, 1804 – July, 1879) was a fur trader with the American Fur Company. He was born in LaPrairie de la Madeleine, near present-day Montreal in lower Canada. By 1831 he had moved to what would become the Minnesota Territory to work at Joseph Renville’s Lac qui Parle trading post. He moved to Mendota, Minnesota around 1840 and built a house on the property of Henry Hastings Sibley. Dupuis worked as a clerk for Sibley and managed the company store. He married Angelique Renville, daughter of Joseph Renville, and they had eight children. The fur trade had largely died out by the 1850s, and Sibley and Dupuis liquidated their fur trade interests in 1853. In 1854, DuPuis built a home for his family and operated a general store until it closed during the financial panic of 1857. The house is part of the Sibley House Historic Site. DuPuis was active in the Mendota community, serving as county treasurer in 1854, the justice of the peace in 1855, and as the Mendota postmaster from 1854 to 1863. In 1871 DuPuis sold his brick home to Timothy Fee, and moved to the Devil’s Lake Reservation in North Dakota to work as storekeeper for the Fort Totten Indian Agency. The Indian Agent for the reservation was William H. Forbes, a former employee for Henry Sibley. By 1879 DuPuis had moved back to Minnesota, where he died at the age of 74."

He was the grandson of the Han general He Jin and, after his mother was taken as a concubine by Cao Cao, was raised with the Wei royal family. He gained a reputation for intelligence and scholarship at an early age, but he was unpopular and criticized for being arrogant and dissolute. He was rejected for government positions by both Emperors Cao Pi and Cao Rui, but became a powerful minister during the rule of Cao Shuang. When the Sima family took control of the government in a coup d'etat in 249, he was executed along with all the other officials loyal to Cao. He was, along with Wang Bi, one of the founders of the Daoist school of Xuanxue. He synthesized the philosophical schools of Daoism and Confucianism, believing that the two schools complimented each other. He wrote a famous commentary on the Daode Jing that was influential in his time, but no copies have survived. His commentary on the Analects was considered standard and authoritative for nearly 1000 years, until his interpretation was displaced by the commentary of Zhu Xi in the fourteenth century."

He officiated at the coronations of George IV (in place of his father who was then still alive) and William IV. However, at the coronation of Queen Victoria this function was dispensed with. Probably as a way of compensation, Dymoke was created a baronet, of Scrivelsby in the County of Lincoln, in 1841 (the normal honour for a King's Champion was a knighthood). Dymoke died in April 1865 when the baronetcy became extinct."
