  "text" : "Ian Hayden (born 14 April 1941) is a former Australian rules footballer who played with Richmond in the Victorian Football League (VFL). Hayden was one of the leading players in the Victorian Amateur Football Association before he came to Richmond, winning the Woodrow Medal in 1960, while playing for the University Blues. A follower and key position player, he kicked 17 goals from 13 appearances for Richmond in 1962, his debut season. He bettered that tally in 1963, with 25 goals from 15 games, enough to top Richmond's goal-kicking. This included a personal best six goal haul, against South Melbourne at Lake Oval, one of just seven wins that he participated in over the course of his career. He badly injured himself in the second round of the 1964 VFL season, against Essendon, when he tore ligaments in his knee. After having a cartilage operation, Hayden returned to training in 1965 but broke down during a practise match in April. He was advised to stay off the football field for the rest of the year, in order to resume his career in 1966, fully recovered. It however didn't work out and he was forced to retire."

  "text" : "Ignaz Samuel Pallme (Steinschönau 1 February 1807 - Hainburg near Vienna 11 June 1877), a Bohemian by birth, undertook a journey to Kordofan in 1837, on commission, for a mercantile establishment at Cairo, in the hope of discovering new channels of traffic with central Africa. In the pursuit of his object, he sojourned (1837–1839) longer in the country than any European before him; the information he furnished respecting the state of this province of Egypt in particular, and of the Belled Soudan in general, may, therefore, be considered the most authentic in existence at that time. That few travellers have visited these countries before Pallme, and subjected the information they were enabled to collect to print, may be deduced from the facts, that scarcely one-half of the places mentioned in Pallme's book are to be found on the maps of that time. The book Kordofan, written by Ignaz Pallme, is at the Austrian National Library in Vienna. Based on notes collected during Pallme's residence in Kordofan (Kurdufan), the book is embracing a description of that province of Egypt and of some of the bordering countries, with a review of the state of the commerce in those countries, of the habits and customs of the inhabitants, as also an account of the slave-hunts taking place under the government of Mehemet Ali."

The first record of Fawkes was an appearance by his son at Southwark Fair in 1722, but an advertisement of April of the same year boasted that he had performed for George II, so it is likely that he was well known in London before this time. He was one of the earliest magicians to present conjuring as an entertainment outside of the traditional fairground setting and by skilful promotion and management of his act he was able to amass both fame and a considerable fortune. His simple entertainment was satirised alongside other popularist amusements by William Hogarth in 1723, but he continued to be patronised by fashionable society until his death in 1732. He formed a close professional relationship with the clock and automata maker Christopher Pinchbeck and from the mid-1720s began to demonstrate Pinchbeck's designs in shows both in their own right and for magical effects in his conjuring act."

  "text" : "Ivan Yegorovich Zabelin (Иван Егорович Забелин; 29 September 1820, Tver – 13 January 1908, Moscow) was a Russian historian and archaeologist with a Slavophile bent who helped establish the National History Museum on Red Square and presided over this institution until 1906. He was the foremost authority on the history of the city of Moscow and a key figure in the 19th-century Russian Romantic Nationalism. Zabelin joined the Moscow Kremlin staff in 1837. Influenced by the early Muscovite \"antiquaries\" such as Ivan Snegirev and Pavel Stroyev, Zabelin was one of the first to investigate the history of Moscow's suburbs and monasteries. While working in the Armoury, Zabelin studied the history of metalworking and enamel work in medieval Russia. He was also considered an expert on icon-painting and Muscovite architecture. In 1859 Count Sergei Stroganov invited Zabelin to excavate the Scythian tumulus graves in South Russia and the Crimea. He is credited with introducing stratigraphic methods in Russian field archaeology. It was he who excavated the Chertomlyk grave, one of the largest Scythian kurgans. His findings are now part of the Hermitage Museum collection. Zabelin joined forces with Count Aleksey Uvarov in establishing the Russian Archaeological Society (in 1864). He summed up his findings in The Antiquities of Herodotus's Scythia (1866, 1873). In 1873 Zabelin quit archaeological pursuites and devoted himself to the study of Pre-Petrine, late medieval Muscovy. He headed the Moscow Society of History and Archaeology between 1872 and 1888 and was revered by the Romantic Nationalist artists such as Andrei Ryabushkin, Sergei Milyutin, and Viktor Vasnetsov. In 1894 Zabelin was elected into the Petersburg Academy of Sciences (honoris causa). Zabelin believed that the \"soul of the people\" manifests itself not so much in the state institutions and political history (as his German colleagues held) but in the quotidian particulars of domestic life and family relations. He elaborated his views in the series of monographs detailing the \"private life of Russian people\" in the 16th and 17th centuries. Zabelin's great trilogy \"The Domestic Life of the Russian Tsars\" (1862), \"The Domestic Life of Russian Tsarinas\" (1872) and \"Great Boyars in Their Votchinas\" (1871) is still consulted and quoted by modern historians. His magnum opus The History of the Russian Mode of Life from the Earliest Times was left unfinished."

  "text" : "Ilias Miniatis (Greek: Ηλίας Μηνιάτης) (1669 at Lixouri – 1714 at Patras) was a Greek clergyman, writer and preacher. At the Flanginian School he learned Ancient Greek and Latin and became interested in mathematics and philology. He was ordained very early. He preached God's word at his home island, Cephalonia, at Zakynthos, at Corfu and at Constantinople. His preachings are considered exemplars for modern ecclesiastical rhetoric. As of his language, it is simple Modern Greek and his style has something dramatical and hymnographic. His eloquent preachings are collected into the book \"Διδαχαί\" (Teachings), first published at Venice on 1725. An older book is \"Η Πέτρα του Σκανδάλου\" (The Start of the Scandal) about the Photian schism. Many historians consider him a student of Frangiscos Scoufos and others an imitator of Paolo Segneri. With his speeches he helped the development of ecclesiastical rhetoric and the configuration of Modern Greek language."

  "text" : "Ismael Moreno Pino (February 15, 1927 – August 15, 2013) was a Mexican jurist, senior diplomat and author. During a distinguished career spanning forty years, he held several important diplomatic positions. In the Foreign Office, where he began his career in 1952, amongst other positions, he served as Undersecretary for Multilateral Affairs (1964-1965), Assistant Secretary of State for International Organization Affairs (1960-1964), and Chief of Western Hemisphere Affairs (1952-1958). A member of the Diplomatic Service since 1958, he was appointed to the rank of Ambassador in 1965, representing his country in Chile, West Germany, the Organization of American States (OAS) in Washington D.C., the International Organizations of the United Nations in Geneva, Switzerland, Venezuela, Peru, the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the Dominican Republic. Prior to retiring in 1992, he served as Head of the Diplomatic Service. During his career, he played an important role in the disarmament conference which culminated in the signing of the Treaty of Tlatelolco (1969) which prohibited nuclear weapons in Latin America and the Caribbean, serving as a delegate in the OPANAL conferences and collaborating closely with Alfonso Garcia Robles, who in 1982 won the Nobel Peace Prize for their efforts. In 1982, President José Lopez Portillo named him an Eminent Ambassador (Embajador Eminente), a special honor reserved by law to only ten ambassadors who have made a distinguished contribution to Mexican Foreign Policy. He was also a Professor of International Organizations at the Mexico City College. The author of several treatises on International Relations and International Law, he is nowadays particularly remembered for his authorship of Diplomacy (1998) which has educated generations of diplomats in Latin America. Born in Mérida, Yucatán in 1927 to financier Ramón Moreno Sánchez and Aida Pino Camára, he obtained a Bachelor of Law Degree (LL.B.) from the Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México in 1950, with the thesis \"El cuerpo consular mexicano al servicio del plan nacional de recuperación económica\" (The Role of the Consular Corps in the National Economic Recovery Plan). He continued his studies at the Edmund A. Walsh School of Foreign Service at Georgetown University, where he studied for a Bachelor (B.S.) and Master’s (M.S.) degree in Foreign Service. He is the grandson of José María Pino Suárez, a former vicepresident of Mexico, and a direct descendant of Pedro Sainz de Baranda y Borreiro (1787-1845), the father of the Mexican Navy and a founding father."

Today it is assumed that she came from a powerful Austrasian noble family, strongly connected to the Carolingian dynasty. Irmina and Hugobert had several children, including: \n*  Plectrude (fl. 691, d. 717), the wife of Pippin of Herstal and founder of the Abbey St. Maria im Kapitol in Cologne \n*  possibly Adela of Pfalzel (b. c. 660, d. c. 735) founder of the convent Pfalzel (some have said she is the sister or Irmina of Oeren) \n*  possibly Reginlind, (b. 660-665, d. 730-740) whose second marriage after the death of her husband was to the duke Theudebert of Bavaria \n*  Chrodelind \n*  possibly Bertrada of Prüm (b. c. 670, d. after 721), the founder of the Prüm Abbey and mother of count Heribert of Laon, who was father of Bertrada of Laon, who in turn was mother of Charlemagne. After Hugobert's dead the now widowed Irmina founded with support from the bishop of Trier the Abbey of Echternach by donating (c. 697/698) lands to Willibrord. She also committed herself to a religious life for the remaining years and became second abbess of St. Mary's convent in Oeren (today a part of Trier) which was later renamed after her: St. Irmina (or St. Irminen). Irmina died at an uncertain date between 704 and 710."

The project supposed that other neighbouring states with significant non-Portuguese population may secede from Brazil also for forming the Federal Pepublic of Pampas. Due to his ideas of having a country where German and Italian would be official laguanges along with Portuguese, in 1993, after an interview on the most popular Brazilian TV channel, Rede Globo, he was accused of racism, fascism and nazism. Irton was considered innocent in all these accusations from Brazilian Officials, and the accusers had to pay a value in money for causing him all the hassle. In 1997, he decided himself to drop the \"Pampas Independence Movement\" for good."

His views are again the Protestant exile in Geneva in 1585. He wrote in 1576 of the Sermon on the means of governing (Anti-Machiavelli), in which he condemned the ideas of Nicolas Machiavelli, suspected of trying to introduce impiety and immorality in government. He accused the Italians of the entourage of Catherine de' Medici to make the propagators. The book, published first in Latin, then in French and English, has considerable diffusion throughout Europe until the mid-seventeenth century. Gentillet argues that the source of wealth of a state is its large population. He believes that the infighting and bad laws are contrary to the development of population and condemned luxury as detrimental to national welfare. Anti-Machiavelli helped to establish lasting misunderstandings about the work of Machiavelli, he is the first rebuttal. He also announced political science as defined by Jean Bodin."

  "text" : "Ippolito Baccusi (also Baccusii, Hippolyti) (c.1550 – 2 September 1609) was an Italian composer of the late Renaissance, active in northern Italy, including Venice, Mantua, and Verona. A member of the Venetian School of composers, he had a strong reputation as a master of counterpoint, and wrote both sacred and secular vocal music. Little is known of his life other than the details of a few appointments, and what can be inferred from the dedications he wrote for his publications. He was born in Mantua. Sometime in the late 1560s he was appointed assistant director of the choir at San Marco in Venice, but he did not hold the position for long, going to Ravenna to study. In 1572 he was maestro di cappella at the church of Sant'Eufemia in Verona, where he may have been associated with the Veronese Accademia Filarmonica. By 1583 he held the maestro di cappella position at Mantua Cathedral, where among other things he taught counterpoint to Lodovico Zacconi, who mentioned him glowingly in his Prattica de musica seconda parte of 1622, particularly for his contrapuntal skill. In 1592 Baccusi accepted the position of maestro di cappella at Verona Cathedral, where he remained for the rest of his life. Baccusi's music is in the Venetian style, influenced by Adrian Willaert, Giaches de Wert, Cipriano de Rore and Andrea Gabrieli. He was a prolific composer, but to date no significant study has been undertaken of his music. His works, mostly published in Venice, include six books of masses, six books of motets and psalm settings, and seven books of madrigals, including a complete setting as a madrigal cycle of Petrarch's 11-stanza Vergine. He also composed five- and six-voice settings of poems celebrating the Venetian victory over the Turks at Lepanto (1571). In the introductions to his 1596 and 1597 publications of masses and motets he mentioned the practice of instrumental doubling of vocal parts, something associated with the Venetian School; this is one of the first explicit references to a practice which had been going on for some time."

  "text" : "Immanuel ben Jacob Bonfils (c. 1300 – 1377) was a French-Jewish mathematician and astronomer in medieval times who flourished from 1340 to 1377, a rabbi who was a pioneer of exponential calculus and is credited with inventing the system of decimal fractions. He taught astronomy and mathematics in Orange and later lived in Tarascon, both towns in the Holy Roman Empire that are now part of modern-day France. Bonfils studied the works of Gersonides (Levi ben Gershom), the father of modern trigonometry, and Al-Battani and even taught at the academy founded by Gersonides in Orange. Bonfils preceded any attempt at a European decimal system by 150 years, publishing the treatise Method of Division by Rabbi Immanuel and Other Topics (Hebrew: דרך חילוק‎‎) on the general theory of decimal fractions around 1350. This was a forerunner to Simon Stevin, the first to widely distribute publications on this topic, and employed decimal notation for integers, fractions, and both positive and negative exponents. While living in Tarascon in 1365, Bonfils published the work for which he would become best known, Sepher Shesh Kenaphayim (Book of Six Wings) (Hebrew: שש כנפים‎‎), a manuscript on eclipses that featured astronomical tables predicting future solar and lunar positions (divided into six parts). The book included data for every important date on the Jewish calendar and even correction factors necessary for those who lived as far away as Constantinople. Breaking the tables into six parts was an allusion to the six wings of the seraphim as mentioned in the Bible in Isaiah 6:2, earning Bonfils the nickname master of the wings. For 300 years, Bonfils' calculations which were extensively used by sailors and explorers well into the 17th century. The book was translated from Hebrew into Latin in 1406 by Johannes Lucae e Camerino and into Greek in 1435 by Michael Chrysokokkes. The book inspired Chemist George Sarton to publish his own version of Six Wings nearly 600 years later. Bonfils translated a number of books from Latin to Hebrew. He also wrote a treatise on the relationship between the diameter and circumference of a circle and methods of calculating square roots."

  "text" : "Inge Valdemar Heiberg (11 October 1861 – 1 July 1920) was a Norwegian physician who served as director of medicine in Belgian Congo from 1911 to 1920. He was born in Christiania as a son of judge Edvard Omsen Heiberg (1829–1884) and Minna Rode (1836–1917). He was a brother of Gunnar and Jakob Vilhelm Rode Heiberg, as well as a first cousin of Eivind and Gustav Adolf Lammers Heiberg and a first cousin once removed of Bernt, Axel and Edvard Heiberg, and uncle of Hans Heiberg. He took the examen artium in 1879 and enrolled in medicine studies. After leading a social life among the \"Kristiania bohême\", being engaged to Bokken Lasson for some years, he graduated with the cand.med. degree in 1893. He tried his luck as a general practitioner in Aalesund, but quit after three years. He was hired as a physician in Congo Free State (from 1908: Belgian Congo) in 1897, and remained here until 1920, except for a study leave at the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine (LSTM) in 1902–03. He assisted an LSTM team that arrived in the Congo Free State on 23 September 1903 to assess public health, and sleeping sickness (African trypanosomiasis) in particular.The members were Cuthbert Christy, Joseph Everett Dutton and John Lancelot Todd. The team spent nine months in the Lower Congo, then on 30 June 1904 began investigating upstream as far as Kasongo. In Congo, he lived in Lado and Ibembo before moving to Boma when promoted to Médicin en chef (director of medicine) in 1911. Among his professional endeavors was to fight the \"sleeping sickness\", but he also believed a certain degree of corporal punishment of the natives to be necessary as a part of disciplining and civilizing. He was also a benefactor and item collector for the Ethnopgraphic Museum in Norway's capital. He also contributed to a lesser degree to the Zoological Museum. For his contributions, he was decorated as a Knight, First Class of the Order of St. Olav in 1908. He was unmarried. In 1920 he retired, and moved home to Norway where he died the same year."

Between 5 May and 9 June 1840, William Williams, presented the Tūranga Treaty copy to rangatira at Tūranga, Uawa, Wakawitirā, Rangitukia and Tokomaru so that those East Coast chiefs could sign; 41 signatures appear on the Tūranga Treaty copy, a number of important rangatira refused to sign, including Te Kani a Takirau of Uawa and Te Houkamau. Te Houkamau opposed the appointment of Revd Rota Waitoa to Te Kawakawa (Te Araroa) in 1848, because he considered it an insult to his dignity to have a Māori deacon whose people he looked upon as bitter enemies. However Te Houkamau eventually accepted Waitoa and Te Houkamau offered himself as a candidate for baptism. To show his penitence, Te Houkamau begged Waitoa to appoint him “church sweeper and bellringer to the House of the Lord.”"

  "text" : "Ivy Tresmand (15 December 1898 – 2 November 1980) was an English soubrette who appeared mostly in musical theatre. Tresmand was born in London. Her earliest appearances were in the chorus of the revue Shell Out (1915), in the musicals Houp La! (1916–1917) and Betty, and in the revue Bubbly. In 1922 Tresmand won the leading role of Tina in a West End revival of the Broadway show The Red Mill. She was in the revue Just Fancy and followed May Beatty as Margot in Sybil. In 1923 she was in The Merry Widow at Daly's Theatre. She continued to play in musicals through the 1920s and early 1930s. In 1936 she took the leading role of Penelope Lee in Ivor Novello's Careless Rapture (1936), remaining with the show while it was on tour and at the Prince's Theatre, Bristol, in 1937–38. She had a part on screen in the film The Dark Stairway (1938). After appearing with Leslie Henson in Going Greek and Swing Along in South Africa, she settled there, continuing to take part in concerts and plays. She died in South Africa in 1980. Tresmand's portrait was painted in oils by the Australian artist William Longstaff (1879–1953). She eventually presented the picture to the City of Johannesburg Africana Museum."

Ehrlich has served as the Chair of the Department of Economics at the State University of New York at Buffalo since 2000. His papers on participation in illegitimate activities, corruption and economic growth, insurance and self-protection, the economics of health and longevity, and the death penalty are widely cited. He is widely regarded as an authority on the economics of crime and the death penalty, although his claims regarding the latter have been both vigorously challenged but also corroborated by many researchers. He is also one of the leading authorities on the economics of human capital and serves as the founding Editor-in-Chief of the Journal of Human Capital, published by the University of Chicago Press. He is a SUNY and UB Distinguished Professor and holds the Melvin H. Baker Chair of American Enterprise at the University of Buffalo, SUNY. He holds a PhD from Columbia University and an Honorary Doctorate from the University of Orleans, France, which was awarded to him for his contributions to economic sciences. Ehrlich also served as a member of the US Presidential Health Policy Advisory group and the Transition Team on Health Policy for President Ronald Reagan, the Hong Kong Government's Health Services Research Committee headed by Secretary Elizabeth Wong, and the Council of Economic Advisors of New York State Governor David A.

  "text" : "Ina Benita (1 February 1912 - August 1944) was a popular Jewish-Polish actress of the interwar period. She was born Janina Ferow-Bułhak in Kiev, Ukraine, then part of the Russian Empire. In 1920 the future actress and her family moved to the Second Polish Republic. Some time in the late 1920's, Benita left for Paris and graduated from the Sacré Cœur School. After returning to Poland, she continued her education in Warsaw. Ina debuted on stage on 29 August 1931, with the Warsaw Theatre group “Nowy Ananas” (\"New Pineapple\"), in the show Paradise for Men (“Raj dla mężczyzn”). One year later she debuted in Ryszard Briske’s film Puszcza. From then on she performed mainly in movies. Benita, however, also appeared on stage, mostly in Warsaw’s revues, such as Cyrulik Warszawski (1937), Wielka Rewia (1938–39), and Ali Baba (since spring 1939). During World War II, in German-occupied Poland, Benita played in German-sponsored theaters, which resulted in allegations of collaboration with the Nazis. Sometime in 1943 she began a relationship with an Austrian Wehrmacht officer (his name remains unknown), with whom she left for Vienna. In early 1944 the officer was called to Warsaw and their affair came to light. Both he and Benita were accused of \"Rassenschande\" - crimes against racial purity - for which he was sent to the Eastern Front. The pregnant Benita returned to Warsaw and was sent to the Pawiak Prison. There she gave birth to a son, Tadeusz Michał, on 8 April 1944. Released on 31 July 1944 with her newborn baby, Benita was last seen during the Warsaw Uprising in August 1944. She and Tadeusz allegedly went down a sewage canal and drowned. However, the exact date and place of her death remain undetermined."

She was a member of the Landsting (the upper chamber of Parliament) from 1936. When K.K. Steincke was appointed minister of justice in 1950, she was elected speaker of the Landsting. In 1951 Steincke returned as speaker, but when he exited the Landsting again in 1952, she was again elected speaker. As such she was the last speaker of the Landsting until its abolition with the constitution of 1953. Ingeborg Hansen, as the only member in both chambers of Parliament, voted against the reinstitution of the death penalty with retroactive force in the Danish purge after World War II.

After graduating high school (German Abitur) in Schwäbisch Gmünd, she studied German studies and Scandinavian studies at the University of Göttingen. After graduating with an M.A., she worked at her university as the equal opportunity commissioner. In the early and mid-1980s, as a school girl and a young student, she was actively involved in the German peace movement, specifically in the protest against the stationing of MGM-31 Pershing missiles at a United States Armed Forces Missile Storage Area at Mutlanger Heide (\"Mutlangen heathland\") near her hometown (as part of the NATO Double-Track Decision). In the 1990s, she worked as a freelance journalist at a local radio station as well as for several regional newspapers; she did her traineeship at Hessische/Niedersächsische Allgemeine newspaper. There, she was gradually promoted up the ranks, being leading editor for politics within ten years. In 2004/2005, she spent a year at Harvard University on a scholarship of the Nieman Foundation for Journalism. In 2008, she went to Berlin to work as a correspondent for the Ippen publishing house.
