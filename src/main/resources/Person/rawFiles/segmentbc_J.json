Arnesby Brown first studied at the Nottingham School of Art in the late 1880s. He has been called \"the artist Nottingham forgot\", with little remaining reference to him in Nottingham. He later studied at the Bushey School of Art in Hertfordshire for four years from 1889. After exhibiting at the Royal Academy for the first time in 1890, he became an elected Associate there in 1903. In 1896 he married Mia Edwards (1870–1931), a painter who studied at Bushey under Sir Hubert von Herkomer. They lived in Norfolk and St Ives, Cornwall. Arnesby Brown was knighted in 1938. He died in 1955, having not painted since 1942 due to blindness. He is buried in the cemetery of the Parish Church of St Mary in his hometown of Haddiscoe, Norfolk. His brother Eric (1877–1939) was the first director of the National Gallery of Canada, from 1912 till 1939."

Macduff was educated at the High School of Edinburgh and the University of Edinburgh, and was ordained as minister of Kettins, a parish in Forfarshire close to his maternal grandfather's estate, in 1843. He was transmitted to St Madoes, a parish in Perthshire centred around the Pitfour estate owned by his mother's cousin, Sir John Stewart-Richardson, in 1849. He left St Madoes to take charge of Sandyford, a new church in the affluent west end of Glasgow in 1855. He was married in 1844 to Anne Joan Seton, who died in 1846, and in 1849 to Louisa Stephen, who died in 1888. By Anne Seton, he had a son, Alexander Ross Macduff (1845-1857) and by Louisa Stephen he had a daughter, Anne Seton Macduff (1850-1929), who edited his later works, including his autobiography, \"The Author of Morning and Night Watches\". He preached at Sandyford for fifteen years (until 1870), and then went to live in Chislehurst, Kent, in order to focus entirely on writing. His best known books were: \"The Prophet of Fire\"; \"Memories of Bethany\": \"Memories of Gennesaret\"; \"The Shepherd and His Flock \": \"Sunset on the Hebrew Mountains \"; \"Comfort Ye\"; \"The Golden Gospel\"; \"Morning and Night Watches\"; \"The Bow in the Cloud\"; \"The Story of a Dewdrop\"; and \"The Story of a Shell.\" In 1857, whilst in Glasgow, he was appointed by the General Assembly a member of their Hymnal Committee. His 31 hymns appeared in his Altar Stones, 1853, and were also included with his later poems in his The Gates of Praise, 1876. His hymn, \"Christ is Coming, let Creation\" is still included in the Church of Scotland's Church Hymnary 4. Macduff died at his home, Ravensbrook, Chislehurst in 1895."

  "text" : "Jerzy Pietrkiewicz or Peterkiewicz (29 September 1916 – 26 October 2007) was a Polish poet, novelist, translator, and literary critic who spent much of his life in British exile. He was born in Fabianki, Poland, the son of a well-read peasant, Jan Pietrkiewicz, and a woman of aristocratic descent, Antonina Politowska, who was about fifty years old at his birth. Both his parents died while he was still a child, his mother of cancer when he was twelve, and his father two years later. He attended the Jan Długosz Catholic School in Włocławek, and then went to Warsaw to study journalism. His first published writing was poetry in Okolica Poetów in 1934. He also contributed articles to ultra-nationalist newspapers. Pietrkiewicz was the author of antisemitic and homophobic pasquinades published in the periodical Myśl Narodowa and subsequently reprinted in some other Polish periodicals in 1937 against Franciszka Arnsztajnowa and other distinguished Polish writers, critics and poets of Jewish descent. Many of the writers attacked in Pietrkiewicz's racist and homophobic lampoons were associated with the literary magazine Pion: Stanisław Piasecki (1900–1941), the publisher and editor of Prosto z mostu, a periodical that supported, reprinted, and attempted to justify Pietrkiewicz's attacks on Arnsztajnowa and others, explained that Pietrkiewicz was originally motivated by the severe criticism that his own poetry had met with in Pion. The left-wing poet and literary critic Ignacy Fik (1904–1942), in his magisterial history of Polish literature during the Interbellum, will reserve a special mention for the \"horrific poems of Pietrkiewicz\", published in the \"Prosto z mostu\" magazine, in which the \"national myth\" receives its \"racist\" incarnation. His Wiersze o dzieciństwie (\"Poems about Childhood\"; 1935) did not receive any accolades from the critics in general; Kazimierz Andrzej Jaworski writing in the literary journal Kamena observed that the compositions included in the collection \"bore the reader with their monotony\", and if they have any value \"it is only apparent to the author himself, for they ring hollow to others\". During World War II he fled first to France and then to Britain. On his arrival he knew no English. He attended the University of St Andrews, earning by 1944 a master's degree in English literature, and in 1948 he completed a doctorate at King's College London, where he would go on to teach Polish language and literature. He began writing novels in English in 1953, reserving Polish for his poetical works. His novels were successful, and led to a friendship with Muriel Spark. On the accession of Pope John Paul II, Pietrkiewicz translated his poems into English, and as a result his own work became known in Poland. He was awarded the Prize of the Ministry of Culture and Art in 1987. He was married twice, first to Danuta Karel, a Polish actress, and then to Christine Brooke-Rose. Both marriages ended in divorce. He died in London."

  "text" : "Westerson, born and raised in Los Angeles, California, originally had designs on a career as an actress but changed her major in college to graphic design. After graduating, she continued as a successful commercial artist in the Los Angeles area for fifteen years before semi-retiring to start a family. She began writing seriously for publication two years after that. She became a newspaper reporter for the next eight years, writing as a stringer for several local papers to hone her skills. After that, she had several part-time jobs while continuing to write historical novels, including tasting host and tour guide for a local winery, choir director and soloist for a church, theology teacher, and secretary. She sold her first medieval mystery novel, Veil of Lies, in 2007 to St. Martin’s Minotaur. Her series is styled a “Medieval Noir” with a hardboiled protagonist set in the Middle Ages. Her debut medieval mystery with protagonists Crispin Guest, a disgraced knight turned detective, along with his cutpurse servant Jack Tucker, received a nomination for the Macavity Award (Sue Feder Historical Mystery Award) and the Shamus Award for Best First Mystery, the first medieval mystery to be nominated for this PI award given by the Private Eye Writers of America. The second Crispin Guest novel, Serpent In The Thorns, was released in 2009, and received nominations for the Bruce Alexander Historical Mystery Award and the Macavity Award (Sue Feder Historical Mystery Award). The third Crispin Guest novel, The Demon’s Parchment, was released in 2010 and also finaled for the Macavity Award and the Romantic Times Reviewers’ Choice Award. In October 2011, Minotaur Books published her fourth medieval mystery entitled Troubled Bones. It received nominations for the Macavity, RT Reviewer's Choice, the Bruce Alexander Award, and the Agatha. In October 2012, her fifth, Blood Lance was released. Her sixth and last from Minotaur Shadow of the Alchemist, was released October 15, 2013. It was nominated for the RT Reviewers' Choice Award and was named by Suspense Magazine as one of the Best of 2013. Jeri decided to release a prequel to the series, Cup of Blood, on her own under the label Old London Press. The book was released July 25, 2014. Severn House, a UK based publisher, picked up the series with the next two entries, The Silence of Stones—released first in the UK in November 2015 and in the US in February 2016. Her follow-up A Maiden Weeping releases in the UK in April 2016 with a US release in August 2016. The prequel to the series Cup of Blood was also nominated for the Bruce Alexander Award. All told, the series has garnered twelve national mystery nominations so far. Jeri ventured into the world of the paranormal with an urban fantasy entry, Booke of the Hidden, currently being shopped by her agent. She is also writing a steampunk paranormal called Daemon Device, book one in the Conjurer Chronicles series. In 2010, writing as Haley Walsh, Jeri published the first in a series of LGBT romantic comedy mysteries with high school English teacher and amateur sleuth Skyler Foxe, with the book Foxe Tail, published by MLR Press. The second in the series, Foxe Hunt, was released in September 2011, and the third, Out-Foxed was released November 2012. A follow-up novella, Foxe Den was self-published in December 2012. The next full-length Skyler Foxe mystery, Foxe Fire, was released in January 2014, and the fifth, Desert Foxe was released November 2014. Two novellas, Foxe Den 2: Summer Vacation and A Very Merry Foxemas were published in 2015. Crazy Like A Foxe, the next full-length mystery, is in progress. In 2011, author Tim Hallinan asked Jeri to participate in a short story e-book anthology whose entire proceeds would raise money for Japan earthquake relief. The book, called Shaken: Stories for Japan, includes nineteen other authors, such as Brett Battles and Ken Kuhlken. Jeri offered her historical short story “The Noodle Girl” for inclusion in this Japanese-themed book. In 2012, she was asked by two other editors to contribute to anthologies, the November released Murder and Mayhem in Muskego and 2015's serial anthology, Day of the Destroyers. Her gay erotic short story under the name Haley Walsh, \"Marked,\" was included in the anthology Anything for a Dollar, edited by Todd Gregory, released October 15, 2013. Jeri writes on a series of blogs. Her own is what she calls a magazine of history and mystery called Getting-Medieval. She also wrote on a group blog with five other mystery authors, called Poe’s Deadly Daughters, but it has, since January 2014, closed its doors. Her medieval detective, Crispin Guest, also has his own blog on Jeri's website. Jeri served two terms as president of the Southern California chapter of Mystery Writers of America from Jan 2013 to Dec 2014, is former Vice President of the Sisters in Crime Los Angeles chapter (Jan 2012 to Dec 2013), and has served two terms as past president of the Orange County California chapter of Sisters in Crime. She is also a member of the Historical Novel Society and other professional writing organizations."

He matriculated at University College, Oxford on 9 December 1586, aged 14. He was of Lypiatt, Gloucestershire. In 1601, he was elected Member of Parliament for Gloucestershire. He was re-elected MP for Gloucestershire at a by-election in 1604, caused by the death of Sir Richard Berkeley, whom he replaced as MP. It is not known what relationship, if any, he may have had to Sir Richard Berkeley; perhaps he was a member of the family of Throckmorton of Coughton Court, who were distant cousins of the Throckmortons of Tortworth.

Blakeway is known chiefly for his unconventional approaches to taking photographs, which have included suspending himself upside down from a helicopter 800 ft in the air. He has no formal education in photography. A chance meeting with two photographers while travelling in Australia led to Blakeway going into business creating panoramic photographs until his visa expired in 1989, at which point he sold his stake to his partners for some copies of their photos and moved back home to set up his own business, Blakeway Worldwide Panoramas. Blakeway has since become known for city skyline photography as well as sports event panoramas."

In 1773, Xerri was appointed to the Chair of Philosophy at the University of Malta, the second since its establishment two years earlier, in 1771, by the Grand Master of the Knights Hospitaller, Manuel Pinto da Fonseca. However, Xerri was unfortunate enough to be in office when in that same year the Grand Master of the Knights Hospitaller, Francisco Ximenes de Texada, brought the activities of the university to a complete stop due to presumed overspending and restrictions in budgetary resources. Xerri was thus made redundant. Five years later, in 1778, when the activities of the university were resumed, and the Chair of Philosophy restored, Xerri was not appointed again. No writings of his, philosophical or otherwise, are known to exist. The same goes for any portrait of him."

Elizabeth Noel, daughter of Edward Noel, 2nd Viscount Campden and Hon. Juliana Hicks, before 1632. The children from this marriage were \n* Mary Chaworth (died 1667) \n* Hon. Elizabeth Chaworth (19 December 1632 – December 1683) married William Byron, 3rd Baron Byron \n* Patrick Chaworth, 3rd Viscount Chaworth (20 June 1635 – June 1693) After the death of his first wife, he married Anne Hickman, daughter of Dixie Hickman and Elizabeth Windsor, on 13 December 1643 at Gainsborough, Lincolnshire. He died in June 1644. He succeeded to the titles of 2nd Viscount Chaworth of Armagh and 2nd Baron Chaworth of Tryme on 3 July 1639. Lord Chaworth supported Charles I of England and in December 1642 fortified Wiverton Hall to make it a garrison for the King. In June 1643, Queen Henrietta, on her way from Newark, wrote to the King: ‘I shall sleep at Werton [Wiverton], and thence to Ashby, where we will resolve what way to take.’ Among other royal visitors were Prince Rupert of the Rhine and his brother Prince Maurice, who after visiting the King in Newark rode to Wiverton with about 400 troops and stayed there until they could settle their future plans. From Wiverton it was that Prince Rupert addressed a letter to the Parliament, asking for a pass for himself, his brother, and other noblemen and gentlemen to leave England."

  "text" : "James O'Toole is a pioneer of the internet and internet marketing in Australia, and began commentating on the web and its impact on business in 1995. O’Toole foresaw the rise of social media and social commerce and how the internet would transform the way businesses and consumers interact. He argued that the internet was not simply an ‘information revolution’ but a “communications revolution”: “The key to understanding the Net and its importance is that this is a communications revolution, not an information revolution. Distributing masses of information is one aspect of the Net. On-line commerce in the future will be more about building relationships than selling ... Businesses will be communicating with people, and they will be communicating with businesses and with each other” O’Toole was a founding producer of ninemsn - Microsoft’s first-ever joint venture – and Australia’s largest online publisher, in 1997. He has held senior executive positions with Fortune 500 and major Australian companies such as Microsoft, McGraw-Hill, 24/7 Real Media, Westpac and Optus. O'Toole is a prominent industry speaker and has spoken at international conferences including eMetrics SMX and SearchEngineRoom. He is currently CEO of James O’Toole Network, an internet marketing, innovation and business strategy organization. O’Toole is a recipient of the PriceWaterhouseCoopers Australian Technology Award for eCommerce and has been an Official Judge for the Adnews National Advertising Awards. His online marketing expertise was also officially recognized with the European Platinum Seal of Excellence for marketing innovation, in 2005."

  "text" : "John Whitson (c. 1558 – 1629) was an English merchant and politician who sat in the House of Commons at various times between 1605 and 1626. He also founded The Red Maid's School. He grew up in Clearwell in the Forest of Dean, and came to Bristol to start his career. Apprenticed to Nicholas Cutt, a member of the Society of Merchant Venturers in 1570, he lived in a house on Corn Street. Cutt died in 1582, and it is presumed Whitson continued working for his widow, Bridget, whom he married in 1585. They had their first child 8 months later. Following the wedding, John Whitson became a wealthy merchant in his own right. Whitson was a merchant and alderman of Bristol. He was Sheriff in 1589 and became Lord Mayor of Bristol for the first time in 1603. Whitson had shares in two ships, the Maryflower and the Seabrake (which would later give their names to houses at the The Red Maids' School), that brought home enemy prizes in the 1590s. Whitson decided that the prize cargo had belonged to poor sailors attempting to supplement their income with extra trade, so rather than stealing from the poor, he sold his share of the prize and gave the money to the almshouses of Bristol. In 1605, he was elected Member of Parliament for Bristol in a by-election to replace Sir George Snigge who was raised to the Bench. During this time, Whitson also helped to re-establish and govern the Society of Merchant Venturers which had become moribund in the later sixteenth century. Whitson’s first wife died in 1608 and he remarried within the year to Magdalen Hynde, the widow of a London merchant, William Hynde. He was re-elected MP for Bristol in 1614 and he was Mayor of Bristol in 1616. Whitson married his third wife (and third widow), Rachel Aubrey, in 1617, she outlived him. In 1621 he was re-elected MP for Bristol. He was elected MP for Bristol again in 1625 and 1626. In 1627 he gave a charity of £500 to be divided between five young men being \"meer merchants\", and an unspecified number of handicraft tradesmen and freemen of Bristol. Whitson was hurt by a fall from his horse, his head hitting an upturned nail by a Blacksmiths, which was the supposed cause of his death at the age of 71. He was buried at St Nicholas' Church on 9 March 1629 and, as he was Captain of the trained bands of the city, they attended his body to the church and the musketeers fired three volleys over his grave. His monument in St Nicholas described him as \"a worthy pattern to all who came after him\". Whitson’s will gave specific instructions for provision for \"one woman … and forty poor women children\" who were to be taught English and sew, to attend church, and were bound to their teacher for eight years. Each child was to “go appareled in red cloth”, as per the boys educated at the Queen Elizabeth's Hospital school, thus founding the The Red Maids' School as the oldest girls’ school in the country."

As part of the deal for George Gund III to sell the North Stars to a group led by Norman Green, the NHL awarded Gund a franchise in Northern California, to which he brought Ferreira along to become the GM. Thus Ferreira was the first general manager of the San Jose Sharks during their inaugural season in 1991-92. He afterwards became the first GM of another California franchise, the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim, from 1993 to 1998. After a counterproductive season in which the Mighty Ducks failed to return to the playoffs, in 1998 Ferreira was demoted to vice president of hockey operations as Pierre Gauthier took over as GM. He left the organization in 2000 to become director of player personnel with the Atlanta Thrashers."

  "text" : "John James (c 1610 – May 1681) was an English politician who sat in the House of Commons in 1653. He served in the Parliamentary army in the English Civil War. James was the son of John James of Astley, Worcestershire and his wife Mary Winford, daughter of Walter Winford. He became a supporter of the Parliamentary cause and served in the army. On 19 April 1647, the Committee of both Kingdoms ordered that '\"Capt. James shall have power to seize upon and recruit his troop out of such horses as are the State's, marked with the State's mark, and have been embezled and sold away to any persons in cos. Bucks, Berks, and Oxon.\" He was added to the Committee for Sequestrations in Worcestershire on 29 July 1648, and was appointed a sequestration commissioner for the county on 4 September 1649 and on 7 February 1650. In December 1650 he was High Sheriff of Herefordshire. The Committee for Compounding wrote to him on 26 December 1650, \" Knowing how much you may contribute to carry on sequestration work, we have joined Mr. Herring (MP for Herefordshire) with you therein, and beg you both to use the utmost care to manage it to the best advantage. We have heard so much of your prudence and readiness that we believe you will omit nothing, and therefore will not trouble you further.\" He replied on 10 January 1651 \"Thanks for your remembrance of me and my cousin Salway (his colleague). I am sorry I cannot answer your expectations in regard of other public business, but I shall spare as much time as I can for your business\" and he was eventually discharged from the committee for sequestration for unsatisfactory accounts in or about March 1652 He was appointed captain of a Troop of Horse Militia in Herefordshire on 21 August 1650. As Colonel James, he was appointed commander of the Horse and Dragoons in Worcestershire, under a commission from the Council of State on 31 March 1651 to \" raise and command the forces in co. Worcester, under the Militia Act,\" and he received a further order on 30 June for \"listing volunteers in co. Worcs.\" On 7 October 1651 the Council wrote to him at Worcester \"The Council have ordered Col. Cooper to search for some gold said to be hid in Worcester, belonging to the enemy; the money is found, and 150 pieces of old gold are now in your hands; send it up to us to be disposed of as the Council shall direct.\" The Council wrote him on 31 March 1651 \"Being informed of your fitness to command the horse and dragoons raised in co. Worcs, we have issued a commission for that purpose, which we enclose, and desire you to give your best furtherance and assistance in raising of them that they may be ready on all occasions for preservation of the peace.\" He received a commission as captain in the 1st Horse Regiment for the safety of the Eastern Association and Inland parts on 21 April 1651, and as these measures were taken to repel the Scots army under Charles II, he probably took part in the Battle of Worcester. He was added by order of Parliament to the High Court of Justice on 25 June 1651. In 1653, James was nominated as Member of Parliament for Worcestershire for the Barebones Parliament. The Council of State ordered on 15 June 1653, that Col. John James and other MPs \"should have the lodgings late in possession of Sir Henry Vane, Sir H. Mildmay, and Col. Thomson, and any others they think fit, so that they may be lodged together,\" and further ordered on 8 July, \"that the Whitehall Committee should put them in possession of the house late Dennis Bond's.\" On 1 November 1653, he was appointed a member of the seventh Council of State, which lasted till December 1653, and took the oath of secrecy on 5 November. He was appointed one of the Ordnance Committee and also of the Committee for Lunatics on 8 November, and was added to the Irish and Scotch Committee on 28 November 1653. In 1654, James got into a dispute with Charles Rich which appeared to be leading to a duel. On 25 April 1654, the Lord Protector's Council reported. \"The Lord President having last Saturday issued a warrant to take into custody Charles Rich and John James on information of a quarrel between them, both parties appeared before the Council where both were bound in £1,000 and two sureties in £1,000 not to fight each other, nor break the public peace\". On 8 May \"a warrant to be prepared for commitment of both to the Tower, they not having attended to give security.\" On 10 May, \"two warrants signed but suspended till Jessop (Assistant Clerk of the Council) give notice to Rich in the country\". On 19 May, \"Order that they both give security in £1,000 each with two sufficient sureties to keep the peace towards each other for all times to come and neither of them to break it, and on so doing that their warrant for commitment to the Tower be suspended.\" James was a commissioner for ejecting scandalous and insufficient ministers and schoolmasters in August 1654, and a commissioner to raise £1,000 Assessment upon the county in 1656. James appear to have been brought to trial at the Restoration and was probably pardoned. On 1 September 1670 he was given licence as John James, of Tripleton, \"to remain in and about London and Westminster, although an officer in the army of the late usurped powers. James married Jane Higgins, daughter of William Higgins, of Tripleton, Herefordshire. James died at Tripleton at the age 71."

  "text" : "John Strachan (1846 – 30 August 1922) was a Scottish-born Australian shipmaster and explorer. Born in Montrose, Scotland, to engineer John Strachan and Sarah, née Delarne, Strachan's family moved to England in 1853 where he studied engineering before running away to sea, fighting for the Union in the American Civil War, sailing on the trade routes from India to Japan, whaling in the Arctic, advising the Prince of Higo in Japan, and managing guano workings on Baker Island. He arrived in Tasmania on 25 April 1872 as mate of the Rita, and on 3 March 1875 married Alice Sarah Henrietta Plummer at Launceston. He worked at Bird Island in the Coral Sea managing more guano workings and visited Torres Strait in September 1875. Subsequently Strachan established himself in Sydney before becoming New Guinea correspondent for the Age, embarking on an exploratory trip down the Mai Kassa River on 6 May 1884 which resulted in considerable fighting with the indigenous people and the death of one of Strachan's companions; his use of an improvised torpedo provoked widespread condemnation in Sydney. He went on another expedition to the Mai Kassa and the Gulf of Papua in September but in January 1886 his claim of discovery was disallowed for 500,000 acres of the area he explored. In 1887 he appealed to the Colonial Office, which dismissed his claim as \"excitable and rather ignorant\". After exploring McClure's Gulf in 1887 from a base in Cape York he published Explorations and Adventures in New Guinea in 1888, which was poorly received by geographers. He based himself in Sydney again in 1889 and establishged trading operations in Borneo and the Dutch East Indies. He successfully sued the Launceston Daily Telegraph in 1896 for £2000 after it published a story about his early life. Strachan ran unsuccessfully for the New South Wales Parliament against Billy Hughes in 1898 (he appears as \"Captain Alistair\" in Hughes' 1947 book Crusts and Crusades), but in November 1902 was imprisoned for debt in North Borneo. In 1903 he again tried to enter politics, this time running against Joseph Cook for the federal seat of Parramatta without success. He unsuccessfully sued the Commonwealth in 1906 for detention of his ship at Daru in Papua, and was charged with illegal recruiting by the Germans in New Guinea in 1909. He subsequently retired, although he was active in anti-German organisations during World War I and ran for the state seat of Parramatta in 1917, garnering only 26 votes. He died in Sydney of chronic cystitis in 1922."

  "text" : "Jacobus Josephus Eeckhout (2 June 1793 – 25 December 1861) was a Flemish painter. Eeckhout was born at Antwerp, and studied first at the Academy of that city. He painted historical and genre subjects, and portraits, and in 1829 he was elected a member of the Academies of Amsterdam, Antwerp, Brussels, and Rotterdam. He settled at the Hague in 1831, and in 1839 became director of the Academy in that city, and after staying at Mechlin and Brussels he went to live in Paris in 1859. He imitated Rembrandt with some skill, and may be considered one of the most distinguished painters of the modern Dutch school. His compositions are expressive and lively, and the colouring vigorous. Eeckhout died in Paris in 1861. His best works are: \n* The Death of William the Silent.  \n* Peter the Great at Zaandam.  \n* The Departure of the Kecruits of Scheveningen'.  \n* Collection de Portraits d'Artistes modernes, nés dans le royaume des Pays-Bas. 1822."

  "text" : "James Claude Robinson is a professor of health economics in the School of Public Health at the University of California, Berkeley, where he has the title of the Leonard D. Schaeffer Endowed Chair in Health Economics and Policy. Robinson is also the Chair of the Berkeley Center for Health Technology, which supports research and professional education projects related to coverage, management, and payment methods for innovative technologies including biopharmaceuticals, medical devices, and diagnostics. James Robinson's professional activities include his roles as Senior Director for Medical Technology at the Integrated Healthcare Association, Contributing Editor for Health Affairs journal, and as keynote speaker for conferences, policy roundtables, and board meetings. At Berkeley, Professor Robinson teaches health policy and economics, focusing on the biotechnology, medical device, insurance, physician, and hospital sectors. He has published three books and over 120 papers in scientific and policy journals such as the New England Journal of Medicine, JAMA, and Health Affairs. Work regarding the Future of Commercial Insurance Profitability Robinson’s 2006 article, “The Commercial Health Insurance Industry In An Era Of Eroding Employer Coverage”, discussed employment based coverage, once a mainstay of attracting employees, has declined. From a peak of covering approximately 164 million people in 2000, employers by 2004 covered approximately 159 million people. The insurance companies that employers utilized for health coverage felt the impact of the changing employer environment. Insurance companies, to maintain their profitability, turned to diversification of coverage, servicing private and public programs. Can insurance companies maintain profitability in the years to come? Insurance companies still rely on the employer based book of business which is in constant flux with the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, some insurance companies need to reduce premiums due to regulatory pressures on excess revenue, the market place itself is changing from insured to self-insured, from comprehensive to high-deductible plan design. Insurance Industry profits have increased due to the result of increasing privatization of Medicaid and Medicare programs. A 2012 Bloomberg Government Study examined the financial performance of the five largest publicly traded health insurers by market capitalization. Quarterly revenue for Medicare business, of the insurers who reported, increased by almost one-third, from $12.55 billion to $16.39 billion with Medicaid revenue doubling from $2 billion to $4.11 billion in a period from fourth quarter 2008 through third quarter 2011. Government business now accounts for more than 40 percent with commercial business accounting for less than half of the total revenue. Drivers of change continue to include the changing role of employers and health coverage, where defined contribution is replacing traditional insurance benefits; increase enrollment in government sponsored health plans, where increases in Medicare Advantage plans and Part D Drug Discount Program enrollments are growing; implementation of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), where 27 million additional people will be insured, and consolidation. In 2011, there were 20 mergers and acquisitions within the managed care, totaling almost $8 billion, and after enactment of the ACA more consolidation took place than in each of the three previous years. Ultimately it will depend on whether the insurance industry can fulfill its value proposition of managing health costs without compromising safety and outcomes. Has privatization of the public health plans ensured success from a cost standpoint? A study conducted in 2013 examined payments to private plans from the time of 1985 to 2013 and found that Medicare had overpaid private insurers by $282.6 billion, with an overpayment of $34.1 billion in 2012 alone. Private insurers utilize four strategies in dealing with Medicare beneficiaries: 1) cherry-picking healthier beneficiaries, through advertising, office location as examples, who cost less. Although all seniors who choose to enroll are accepted private plans induce sicker beneficiaries to disenroll by making expensive care inconvenient; 2) recruiting mild to sometimes serious beneficiaries which trigger higher premiums but don’t have expensive care; 3) enroll patients who receive majority of their care free through the Veterans Administration; and 4) lobby Congress to raise reimbursement. Work Regarding the Evolution of the Insurance Industry from Private to Public Coverage In his 2006 article, “The Commercial Health Insurance Industry In An Era Of Eroding Employer Coverage”, Robinson discussed the dynamics of the insurance industry transforming from a largely private only venture to one that has a great deal of Publicly funded health care. Robinson argues that the majority of health insurance in the U.S. is now provided by large firms that cover individuals with private and publicly funded plans. Traditionally, health insurance was provided by an employer as a benefit to their employees. This system provided the majority of health insurance for the majority of the 20th century and peaked in the year 2000 with 164.4 million being covered by employer based plans. However, this figure then dropped by nearly 5 million in the next four years. The reduction in employer based coverage caused the insurance industry to adjust in order to stay profitable. Many smaller or less profitable firms merged with larger, more profitable firms to be able to offset some of the losses from employer based plans. The other major change has been the commercial sector embracing and moving into Medicaid and Medicare coverage to stay viable. This expansion into public programs has allowed the private insurance industry to grow despite the erosion of employment based coverage. Part of this success is due to state level budgetary constraints that have made them willing to transfer Financial risk and outsource the management requirements to a commercial carrier. This relationship will ensure that the profitability of the commercial health insurance industry will be linked to the budgetary cycles and political fluctuations of state and federal governments. However, these budgetary pressures are not expected to affect Medicare for another half decade. Work Regarding the Recent Trends in Commercial Health Insurance One of Robinson’s research areas is related to the economics of health insurance. In the United States, the term health insurance is used to describe any program that helps patients pay for medical expenses. However, in contrast to other countries around the world, health insurance in the United States is available through multiple different programs including but not limited to privately purchased insurance, social insurance (Medicare) or a social welfare program (Medicaid) funded in joint by the state and federal government. The majority of Americans have private health insurance with a very large proportion of the private health insurance offered as part of an employee compensation packaged administered through the workplace. For example, in 2009, 169.7 million (87%) of the 194.5 million people with private coverage were getting their coverage from their employers. In a 2006 article published in Health Affairs , Robinson describes the landscape of the commercial insurance market and some of its potential barriers to growth and sustainability due to increasing external pressure. Some of these barriers to growth include its high dependency on employer-based insurance, inability to use pricing power due to cash rich non-profit Blues plans and the market trend towards consumer driven health benefit designs (also known as high deductible health plans) which transfer risk and reward between the consumer and the plan. What is equally concerning is that during the years 2001 through 2010, the rate of employment-based insurance coverage decreased due to rising health care costs placed on plans and employers. With an inability to strengthen their foothold in the now-decreasing employer based market, Robinson suggests that the commercial insurances’ will use historical trends, perspective and economic principles of healthcare finance to overcome these challenges and sustain their growth in earnings. He also predicts the future earnings and profitability of the commercial health insurance industry to be dependent on their ability to anticipate and work through the political agenda and fiscal policies at both the state and federal levels. Under the provisions of the Affordable Care Act(ACA) the commercial health insurance industry has been granted important opportunities through the privately managed healthcare insurance exchanges and the expansion of the Medicaid program in many states. There is also a growing desire of the public purchaser of health to outsource the difficult task of managing increasingly complicated patient care to the private sector which may be more efficient due to greater competitive pressures. However, the fate of the employer-based coverage market due to provisions in the ACA remains unclear. Recent evidence suggests that the erosion of the employer-based health insurance may not continue as employers may be more incentivized to continue healthcare; the cost of coverage was $8,483 versus the actual cost of dropping active employee health benefits at $17,269. While additional year-end evidence is needed, the ACA does appear to increase the opportunities of expanded growth for the private sector in the individual, Medicaid, and Medicare markets."

  "text" : "Joan Stiebel MBE (23 April 1911 – 25 January 2007) was a Jewish relief worker in London, England, after World War II. Joan Valentine Stiebel was born on 23 April 1911 in Walton-on-Thames, Surrey, England. The daughter of Christian parents, she became increasingly active in Jewish affairs after becoming a secretary to Otto M. Schiff, CBE, in 1933. In 1939, after Schiff and others had formed what today is called the World Jewish Relief organization, Stiebel was appointed to that organization full-time. After the end of World War II, Stiebel was responsible for making travel arrangements to bring 1,000 underaged Jewish Nazi concentration camp orphans to the United Kingdom. The children came to be known in the press as the Boys, and her involvement with them continued throughout her lifetime. She was also instrumental in the formation of Jewish Child's Day in 1947. In 1958 she was appointed as the United Kingdom-based Joint Secretary of the World Jewish Relief organization. She was awarded the Member of the Order of the British Empire in 1978 for her lifetime of service to Jewish refugees. Shortly after retiring from the World Jewish Relief organization in 1979, she was recruited by The Wiener Library to assist in establishing their Endowment Fund. She continued this pro bono work until her permanent retirement in 1989. Stiebel died in London, England on 25 January 2007."

He attended Brisbane Grammar School and the University of Sydney, graduating with a Bachelor of Engineering specialising in mining and metallurgy in 1901. From 1902 he worked as a trucker, timberman, miner and assistant surveyor at Broken Hill; he moved to Western Australia in 1904 to work as a surveyor with Peak Hill Goldfield Ltd, of which he was general manager in 1907. He married Elizabeth Maud in Perth on 3 October 1908, although they were later divorced. Newman returned to Queensland in 1908 to become a consultant to Mount Morgan Gold Mining Co. Ltd, subsequently joining the engineering staff until he returned to consultancy in 1912, after which he worked in Papua and Malaya. He served with the Malay States Guides in World War I and then formed Alluvial Tin (Malaya) Ltd in 1923 with Graham Pratten. The pair extended their business to Siam, Borneo and Burma before selling the company in 1927. Newman returned to Caboolture, and on 16 February 1927 married Gwendoline Nita Stephenson; they settled in a thirty-eight room mansion. Newman bought extensive property in rural Queensland and the Northern Territory, acquiring dairy farms, pineapple plantations, and cattle studs like Anthony Lagoon Station. In 1942 he was appointed controller of minerals production and given the task of increasing production of strategic minerals like tungsten and tin. He moved briefly to Melbourne, during which time the Royal Australian Navy used his home; he later donated the property as a war veterans' home and lived in Beachmere. Appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1957, he was awarded the medal of the Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy in 1960. He died at St Lucia in 1973."

He represented Vancouver-Point Grey in the Legislative Assembly of British Columbia from 1937 to 1946 as a Conservative. He was born in Beamsville, Ontario and, in 1903, travelled west to Alberta, where he worked on a cattle ranch and as a night clerk in the Calgary post office. He later worked at placer mining, at railroad construction and as an employment agent. In 1906, he came to Vancouver, where he worked in a stationery store. Paton also spent some time in Prince Rupert where he worked at carpentry and surveying and helped set up the post office; he also was involved in surveying and mining in Whitehorse. From Vancouver, he moved to Eburne, where he became involved in newspaper publishing. In 1908, he purchased the Point Grey Gazette, later the Vancouver Courier. Paton also operated a store where he sold books and stationery and other assorted goods and offered printing, publishing and bookbinding services. He sold the newspaper at the beginning of World War I and enlisted in the 72nd Battalion of the Canadian Infantry, serving in Belgium and France. On his return to Canada in 1918, Paton re-purchased the Gazette. He was elected to the Point Grey municipal council in 1924 and served as reeve from 1925 to 1927. In 1925, Paton and others were charged with involvement in the kidnapping of Wong Foon Sing, accused by some of having murdered Janet Smith, but Paton was acquitted. In 1926, he married Cora May Fraser. Paton sold the Gazette later that year. In 1929, he became an alderman for the city of Vancouver. During World War II, Paton supported the movement of Japanese-Canadians into the province's interior; he also opposed giving them the right to vote. He died in office at the age of 61."

  "text" : "John Bridges (born 1610) was an English politician who sat in the House of Commons in 1654 and 1656. He fought in the Parliamentarian army in the English Civil War. Bridges was the eldest son of John Bridges of Alcester, Warwickshire and Hackney, barrister at law, and his wife Elizabeth Holyoake. His great grandfather John Bridges was of an Irish family and settled at South Littleton, Worcestershire in 1558, and later acquired the Alcester estate. Bridges was an active soldier in the Parliamentary army in the Civil War. In April 1644, he conveyed ammunition into Gloucester while it was under siege from the Royalists. On 11 May 1644 the House of Commons ordered John Bridges, major of foot, to be added to the Committee of Worcestershire on 30 March 1645. They gave him a vote of thanks \" for his great services,\" and appointed him Governor of Warwick Castle and Town on 12 May 1645. He was made Colonel of Boseville's regiment of foot on 24 June 1645. He took part in the siege of Worcester under Colonel Edward Whalley, and was a parliamentary commissioner to receive its surrender in July 1646. He was ordered to return his forces into winter quarters on 25 November 1646, and was \"continued'* as Governor of Warwick Castle on 25 March 1647, and still held the role in 1649. In about 1648 he bought the estate of Hurcott near Kidderminster, from John Evelyn for £3,400. Information was laid against him on 22 August 1649 that he had captured and concealed 25 waggons, many laden with plate and other treasure, belonging to the late King. He was added to the Committee for dealing with Scandalous and Malignant Ministers in Worcestershire on 24 September 1652. In 1654, Bridges was elected Member of Parliament for Worcestershire in the First Protectorate Parliament. He was in service in Ireland in 1655 and represented Sligo and Roscommon in the Second Protectorate Parliament in 1656. He raised a petition on 7 April 1657 when he was Governor of Kilmalloch, for payment for arrears for personal service, which was referred to the Irish Committee, On 21 March 1660 a warrant was issued to pay him £100 \"for his expenses in Ireland where he is going on special service\". The allegations that he had carried off 25 waggons of the King's goods returned following the Restoration. In June 1660 Sir Joseph Wagstaffe petitioned the King \" that Colonel John Bridges late Governor of Warwick Castle, who detains £50,000 worth of the late King's money and goods, may be excepted out of the Act of Oblivion\" and in the same month Charles Talbot laid information against him and others \" for seizing the late King's carriages about the time of the Battles of Naseby and Edgehill.\" On 17 August 1663 Lord Ashley reported that Bridges was \"acquitted on a suit brought against him for detaining plate and household goods of the late King\". John Strode (Governor of Dover Castle) who had a warrant of 21 August 1663 for a grant of a  moiety of what is taken and unaccounted for, and not pardoned by the Act of Indemnity\"' persisted in the belief that Bridges should be convicted although Lord Ashley pointed out that Strode \"may be encouraged by the grant\". Bridges married Mary Beale daughter of Bartholomew Beale, of Walton, Shropshire in 1635. His grandson Sir Brook Bridges, 1st Baronet was created a baronet."

  "text" : "Jeremy Round (1957-1989) was a cookery writer and journalist for The Independent newspaper, feted by food lovers from Elizabeth David to Marco Pierre White.The only book he published before his untimely death in 1989 was The Independent Cook. It was re-issued in 2001 and chosen as 38th in the 50 best cookbooks of all time as selected by The Observer Food Monthly team (Jay Rayner, Bill Buford, Rachel Cooke and Allan Jenkins) in 2010 In August 1999, The Independent celebrated Round's work by publishing many admiring comments from the world of cooking. Amongst these were Raymond Blanc: \"he was an extremely serious food writer. He was not only interested in restaurants, but also supermarkets, the food chain, all food issues. He was very interested in bringing the consumer to be far more critical and demanding. He criticised in a very honest way, but was never blunt. He had such a passion for food that he could easily deconstruct the food itself. Few critics can do that.\" Clarissa Dickson Wright: \"He was the bearer of the food torch which passed from Elizabeth David to Jane Grigson to him. Usually there's one person who's head and shoulders above his contemporaries, and he was that one. And I'm not saying that just because he's dead. No one matched his eclecticism and wit, his wicked humour. I still use his book Independent Cook and I will not lend it to anyone - I'm paranoid someone will nick it\"; Marco Pierre White: \"He was a rare man - he hasn't been replaced. His knowledge was first rate and he was a great all-rounder. He was very unusual in that he would be writing an article, for example about endive, and he'd ring me up and say \"tell me three or four things that you'd do with endive\" -a perfect example of his professionalism and humility. He was a critic and food journalist with a tremendous amount of integrity\". The Guild of Food Writers Awards (established in 1996) continues to present in his memory the Jeremy Round Award for Best First Book in recognition of outstanding achievements in food writing and broadcasting. Before his meteoric rise as a cookery writer, Round also wrote poetry. He was a member of the group of writers meeting at The Old Fire Station in Oxford in the mid-1980s. Alan Davidson remembered \"his wit, often self-deprecatory. And what I chose to represent him, with his warm approval, in an anthology of writing about food was a poem [\"Utopia\"] he wrote on realising, from something Paul Levy had written, that he had hitherto been part of the vulgar herd who did not know that tea is seldom drunk with food in China. The poet Martyn Crucefix celebrates Round as friend, poet and cook in 'In Memory of Jeremy Round' from the collection Beneath Tremendous Rain (Enitharmon Press, 1990). Jeremy Round was an old boy of Palmer's College in Thurrock, Essex, England"

Bernstein is an expert in Continental philosophy and a leading interpreter of the philosophy of Adorno. According to Espen Hammer, Bernstein situates Adorno \"in the middle of contemporary philosophical debate in ethics,\" by arguing that \"genuine ethical responsiveness must be sought for in the repressed margins of society\" Bernstein has published two books on art, The Fate of Art and Against Voluptuous Bodies: Late Modernism and the Meaning of Painting. In an interview with the Brooklyn Rail following these publications, Bernstein stated that \"the modern rationality that creates modern science, that creates the capitalist economy, that creates bureaucratic rationality, needs to get rid of sensuous materiality, concreteness, and the experience of those things.\" Jay Bernstein was a 2013 Berlin Prize Fellow at the American Academy in Berlin. Bernstein is known for his lectures on Kant and Hegel, some of which have been recorded as part of the Bernsteintapes project."

  "text" : "James Marcus Bach is a software tester, author, trainer and consultant. He is a proponent of exploratory testing and the context-driven school of software testing and is credited with developing session-based testing. He was a member of the Board of Directors of the Association for Software Testing. Lessons Learned in Software Testing, a book he co-authored, has been cited over 130 times according to Google Scholar, and several of his articles have been cited dozens of times including his work on heuristics for testing and on the Capability Maturity Model. He has written numerous articles for IEEE Computer. In his autobiography, he reports that he worked as a software testing manager for Apple and Borland after dropping out of high school. He also programmed Apple II and Commodore 64 ports of various titles for Spinnaker Software. He is the son of the author Richard Bach, and is the brother of Jonathan Bach who is also renowned software tester. Since 1999, he has worked as independent consultant out of Eastsound, Washington. On this basis, he was one of the expert witnesses in the Microsoft antitrust case: he determined that Microsoft could indeed unbundle Internet Explorer from the Windows operating system. He is an advisor to the Lifeboat Foundation as a computing expert. They credit him with developing the General Functionality and Stability Test Procedure for Microsoft, part of the Designed for Windows program."

  "text" : "Jody Freeman (born 1964) is the Archibald Cox Professor at Harvard Law School and a leading expert on administrative law and environmental law. She served as Counselor for Energy and Climate Change in the Obama White House in 2009-2010. Freeman is a prominent scholar of regulation and institutional design, and a leading thinker on collaborative and contractual approaches to governance. After leaving the White House, she advised the National Commission on the Deepwater Horizon oil spill on topics of structural reform at the Department of the Interior. She has been appointed to the Administrative Conference of the United States, the government think tank for improving the effectiveness and efficiency of federal agencies, and is a member of the American College of Environmental Lawyers. Freeman grew up in Vancouver, British Columbia, and graduated from Stanford University (B.A., 1985), the University of Toronto (LL.B. 1989), and Harvard Law School (LL.M. 1991; SJD 1995). In 1990-91, she clerked at the Ontario Court of Appeal for a panel of judges including future Canadian Supreme Court Justice and UN High Commissioner Louise Arbour. From 1995-2005, Freeman was a Professor of Law at UCLA, where she co-founded the Environmental Law Program and was an award-winning teacher. From 2001-2004, Freeman also taught environmental law and served as Associate Dean for Law and Policy at the Bren School of Environmental Science & Management at UCSB. In 2005, Freeman joined the Harvard Law School faculty. She was one of a number of prominent hires made during Dean Elena Kagan's tenure. In 2006, she founded Harvard’s Environmental Law and Policy program, which houses one of the nation’s leading environmental law clinics. Freeman has written extensively on climate change law and policy. She is the co-author of a leading casebook in environmental law, and has produced two other significant books: Moving to Markets in Environmental Regulation, Lessons after Twenty Years of Experience (2006, with economist Charles Kolstad) and Government by Contract: Outsourcing and American Democracy (2009, with Harvard Law School Dean Martha Minow). In 2006, Freeman authored an amicus brief on behalf of former United States Secretary of State Madeleine Albright in Massachusetts v. Environmental Protection Agency, the global warming case decided by the Supreme Court in 2007. She wrote an influential article about the implications of the case in the 2007 Supreme Court Review. Freeman’s scholarship in administrative law has focused on public-private collaboration, negotiated rulemaking, inter-agency coordination, and the dynamic between Congress and the President in overseeing agency decision making. As a Deputy and Counselor to Carol Browner, Director of the new White House Office of Energy and Climate Change, Freeman contributed to a variety of policy initiatives on American energy and climate change issues, including greenhouse gas regulation, energy efficiency, renewable energy, oil and gas drilling, and the design of comprehensive legislation to place a market-based cap on carbon. Freeman led the White House effort on the Obama administration’s historic national auto agreement, which set the first greenhouse gas standards in the U.S., and led to an agreement that will double the fuel efficiency of cars and trucks by 2025. In 2012, Freeman was elected as an outside director of ConocoPhillips, one of the largest independent energy companies in the world. She serves on the Board's Public Policy Committee."

Johann Gottfried von Aschhausen was born in Oberlauda, today a district of Lauda-Königshofen, on August 12, 1575. He became a canon of Bamberg Cathedral in 1593, upon the resignation of an older brother. He was ordained as a priest on December 22, 1601. He became the dean of Comburg in 1604. He played a role in the formation of the Catholic League, under the leadership of Maximilian I, Elector of Bavaria, on July 10, 1609. He was elected Prince-Bishop of Bamberg on July 21, 1609, with Pope Paul V confirming the appointment on November 4, 1609. He was consecrated as a bishop by Wolfgang von Hausen, Prince-Bishop of Regensburg, on February 2, 1610. As Prince-Bishop of Bamberg, he sought to curb the growth of Protestantism in the Prince-Bishopric of Bamberg, inviting the Jesuits to assume an important role in education in Bamberg. He also conducted a witch-hunt in the Prince-Bishopric of Bamberg in 1612–13 and in 1617–18, which saw approximately 300 witches burned at the stake in this period. He was elected Prince-Bishop of Würzburg on October 5, 1617, with Pope Paul V confirming the appointment on February 10, 1618. This created a personal union between the Prince-Bishopric of Bamberg and the Prince-Bishopric of Würzburg. During the Thirty Years' War, Bamberg and Würzburg deployed large numbers of infantry and cavalry in 1620 and 1622. He died in Regensburg on December 29, 1622 and is buried in Bamberg Cathedral."

He is the holder of the Hwei-chih and Julia Hsiu Chair in Chinese Studies. Esherick is a graduate of Harvard College (1964, summa cum laude). He received his Ph.D. from University of California, Berkeley (1971), under the supervision of Joseph R. Levenson and Frederic Wakeman. In addition to publishing research monographs, Esherick published a series of essays on historiography and reviews of the large questions in modern Chinese history. As a member of the Committee of Concerned Asian Scholars, for instance, Esherick in 1972 published a critique of the field and of his undergraduate professor, John K. Fairbank, \"Harvard on Imperialism.\"  Later such essays dealt with the Revolution of 1911, Chiang Kai-shek, and the Revolution of 1949. Esherick taught at the University of Oregon before coming to UCSD in 1990. At UCSD he taught modern Chinese history, specializing in the intersection of social developments and political movements in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Esherick has chaired the program in Chinese Studies, served as chair of the Advisory Committee of the Institute for International, Comparative and Area Studies (IICAS) and received (together with Paul Pickowicz) the 2003 Chancellor's Associates Award for Excellence in Graduate Teaching. Beyond UCSD, he serves on the editorial boards of the China Quarterly, Modern China, Asia Major, and China Review International."

  "text" : "Bror Johan (Jean) Teodor Jahnsson (7 September 1854 in Stockholm – 5 March 1944) was a Swedish jeweller, art collector and Consul General. Jahnsson joined the goldsmith C.G. Hallberg's factory and shop in Stockholm in 1875, becoming a manager in 1879 and then president in 1896 of the goldsmith firm. In 1927 he was commissioned to evaluate Turkey's treasury. Jahnsson acquired the old aristocratic Van der Nootska Palace in Stockholm in 1902, which had long been standing and fallen, and saved it from demolition by ensuring it undergo a complete restoration in consultation with a commission of architects which included Isak Gustaf Clason, Kasper Salin and Agi Lindegren and painter Vicke Andrén; it was the latter two who carried out the restoration. Jahnsson gathered a rich collection at the palace, including mainly Swedish silverware, a collection of hundreds of spoons from the 15th century onwards, porcelain, an unmatched collection of precious bejeweled gold boxes, Swedish miniatures, art furniture, Swedish engraving portraits and a library of much more than 100,000 volumes, including nearly complete collections of Swedish dramatic literature and Reformation writings, Swedish history books and documents etc. Jahnson also had an extensive weapons collection, stored in Stensund Castle. Jahnsson was hit hard by the Kreuger crash in the early 1930s, in which he was stripped of his wealth and forced to leave the Van der Nootska Palace and auction off most of the collections. Stensund Castle was sold to Carl Matthiessen, 1933, and the weapons collection auctioned off . The remainder of Jahnsson's collections from Van der Nootska, which mainly consisted of the Stockholmiana Collection, were donated in 1942 to the Stockholm City Museum of Axel Wenner-Gren, who in February 1938, had bought the Van der Nootska Palace. The Stockholmiana Collection consisted of about 5000 images and about 3000 books and pamphlets."

He was born in Dublin, son of John Craig of Dulsholm, Scotland, and Horsehead, County Cork, and Agnes Maria Taylor, of Edendale, County Dublin. He spent part of his youth in counties Sligo and Cork, where his father worked as a bank manager. He was educated at Trinity College, Dublin where he graduated B.A. in 1851, M.A in 1857 and B.D. and D.D. in 1869. He was ordained Deacon in Dublin in 1853 and became a chaplain in the Irish prison system. As Vicar of Temple Breda, County Cork, he was chaplain to the garrison of Camden, and held also an appointment as chaplain to the Church of Ireland convicts stationed there. In the 1850s and 1860s he held a number of posts as curate in St. John's, Dublin, Carrigaline, Killanully, Passage West, Youghal and afterwards became the last Vicar of Kinsale (1865-1872). While still young he had to travel to the south of France for health reasons and while there became well acquainted with the language and literature of the region. He enlisted as a chaplain in the Prussian army during the Franco-Prussian War where he was shot and seriously wounded; he later wrote of his experiences. From 1873 to 1884 he was chaplain to the Molyneux Asylum, and from then until his retirement in 1901 he was incumbent of Holy Trinity Church, Lower Gardiner Street in Dublin. He had to return to the south for the good of his health and died at the Villa Miramare, in San Remo, Italy, on 10 October 1909. He married, on 19 April 1860, Dorothea Bird of Kinsale, and had a son and a daughter. He later married Adelaide Allen, to whom he dedicated his 1877 book, Miejour."

  "text" : "Jean McSorley is long-standing anti-nuclear campaigner, who formed the group \"Cumbrians Against a Radioactive Environment\" (Core) from her home town of Barrow-in-Furness, England in protest at the local Sellafield plant. As well as fighting compensation cases for Sellafield workers, Core took part in direct action campaigns. It has been incorrectly reported that they earned a string of injunctions.[1] Neither CORE as a group, nor the individuals involved, have received injunctions; but Greenpeace – who Jean McSorley subsequently worked for - has been served with a number due to its actions against nuclear operations. Ms McSorley worked as the anti-nuclear coordinator for Greenpeace throughout the 1990s and travelled to Australia and the Far East. She was the senior anti-nuclear campaigner for Greenpeace in the 2000s, and became the victim of an espionage scandal when nuclear power giant EDF committed industrial espionage against Greenpeace. In November 2011, EDF was fined £1.3m and ordered to pay £428,000 in damages to Greenpeace after being found guilty of spying on the environmental group. EDF executive Pierre-Paul François was sentenced to three years’ imprisonment. His deputy, Pascal Durieux, was sentenced to three years’ imprisonment, with two of them suspended. McSorley has contributed to several academic works on nuclear energy and wrote her own book, Living in the Shadow, in 1990. As of 2011, she still acts as a consultant to Greenpeace. Jean McSorley lived in Australia from 1990 until 2003, whilst there she was first head of Greenpeace Australia's nuclear campaign before moving to become the Campaign Coordinator for the Nuclear & Energy Campaign in Asia for Greenpeace International. She has also worked as a policy analyst for The Cabinet Office of New South Wales (Health and Aboriginal Affairs). She was a member of the Australian Federal Nuclear Committee 2000-2003. Since 2011 she has worked as an independent consultant to Greenpeace and other NGOs."

In 1950 he was under contract to Winnipeg Blue Bombers but ended up returning to the newly renamed Hamilton Tiger-Cats for his final season. He was enshrined in the Oshawa Sports Hall of Fame in 1994, with the following testimonial: Jimmy was born in Oshawa on February 15, 1928, and began his outstanding athletic career in 1942. Jimmy played softball for the Oshawa Commercials who became 1942 Eastern Ontario Juvenile Champions. Between 1943 and 1946 Jimmy displayed his athletic versatility at the local level by participating in football and boxing, in addition to softball. The Oshawa Red Raiders Football Club (1947-1948) had Jimmy as a member and during this time they won the Junior B Championship and Jimmy was voted the Most Valuable Player. From 1949 - 1951 Jimmy played for the Hamilton Tiger Cats of the Canadian Football League and in 1949 was honoured by his selection as C.F.L. Rookie of the Year, as well as being the recipient of the Tiger Cats' Green Award. In 1952 he returned to the Oshawa Red Raiders Football Club and was again voted Most Valuable Player. From 1954 to 1962 Jimmy was a member of the Oshawa Tony's Softball Team. During this time the team won four Senior B Ontario Championships and competed in the World Softball Championships in 1956. James Roy Loreno is truly a talented athlete deserving of our recognition."

In 2010, Speziale's decision to move from Passaic County to the Port Authority mid-election was the focus of considerable controversy, and prompted allegations that the appointment was politically motivated. He later sued the Port Authority, alleging that port authority officials had retaliated against him for exposing corrupt practices and wasteful spending. Speziale has been described as a \"flamboyant, controversial figure\" and as having a \"flair for publicity.\" He has published a ghostwrittenbook about his experiences working undercover, and has been featured on the reality TV series Cops. He had a small role and acted as \"police consultant\" for the 2010 film Brooklyn's Finest."

  "text" : "Francisco Javier Pradera Gortázar (April 28, 1934 – November 20, 2011) was a Spanish anti-Franco activist, journalist, political analyst and publisher. Pradera was a journalist and columnist for El País, based in Madrid. Pradera worked as an editorial writer at El País from 1976 to 1986. His first piece for El País was published on May 16, 1976. He remained an El País columnist and editorial board member from 1986 until his death in 2011. Outside of El País, Pradera worked as the director of the publishing firm, Alianza Editorial, and founded the publishing house, Siglo XXI. Pradera was born on April 28, 1934, in San Sebastián, Gipuzkoa. His grandfather, Víctor Pradera Larumbe, a politician who founded the Bloque Nacional, now a defunct conservative party, was killed by anarchists in 1936. His father, Javier Pradera, was also assassinated just one day after his grandfather. Pradera completed his law degree as a cum laude from Complutense University. He found work within the legal department of the Franco's era Spanish Air Force. However, Pradera was arrested in February 1956 for taking part in anti-Franco university protests, which cost him his job. Pradera turned from his family's politically conservative traditions and joined the Communist Party of Spain, which was banned during the Franco era. However, he left the part in 1964 following the expulsions of Jorge Semprún and Fernando Claudín in a party purge. Pradera and Fernando Savater, a Basque philosopher, co-founded the Claves de Razón Práctica magazine in 1990. Javier Pradera died on November 20, 2011, at the age of 77. His last column for El País was published on the same day as his death. The piece, which he titled Al borde del abismo (On the brink of the abyss), warned against a potential interim government for Spain if the European sovereign debt crisis worsened."

In 1643 he made a land purchase in New Netherland and settled there with several dozen others, but an attack by the natives during Kieft's War caused many, including Throckmorton, to return to Rhode Island. He became active in Providence civil affairs, serving as moderator, deputy, and treasurer. He died in 1684 in Middletown, New Jersey, where he went to visit his children, and was buried there.

Guy returned to Beijing during the winter break 1997-98 to visit his fiancée and married under Chinese law on January 9, 1998, then returning to the university to continue his studies that spring, but the long distance relationship played an impact on his studies and dropped out that summer, returning to his wife start their life together. Guy was asked by a close friend to join him as an extra in film the film The 38th Parallel. Upon meeting the assistant casting director, he was placed in a helicopter flying over Changping District, and during that scene the casting director, Max Wang, allowed for Helen to fly in the back of the helicopter out of the camera view. Guy was living a dream, but only for a day. Guy went back to his day job selling concrete blocks. Years passed and Guy got a call from his now close friend Max, to star in a TV series. He took off that weekend and excitedly traveled to Dalian to shoot “The Korean War.” There he had the honor to work with Hollywood actors Robert Sutton and Frank Novak. He appreciated the opportunity of learning from them however he found it quite depressing because later that Sunday he and his wife would return to Beijing, this time, back to his real estate job. Two years later, in 2002, Guy left his job to study Mandarin Chinese at the Beijing Language and Culture University and immediately afterwards came the arrival his first son, Alexander born on his Chinese wedding anniversary. Guy. At that time, he tried to start a pizza shop and a year later failed, losing face to his wife. He then went back to the real estate industry and in late April 2005, his second son, Augustus, was born. Now, a father of two sons, Guy still had emptiness in his heart with regards to work and was going through depression. With his marriage on the rocks, his close friend Max called to cast him again for yet a larger role given his natural skill and interest for acting. Guy put his heart and passion into it, realizing he was far happier as an actor. Then in 2007, he left a rewarding real estate job behind to focus on his new career as a hungry actor. Guy realizing his happiness and passion for acting honed his talent with the knowledge of veteran Chinese actors Masser and Li Wen Bo and made a smooth transition from a working character actor to a foreign lead actor in China. Living in Beijing with his wife and two sons, Guy teaches his sons acting. In 2010 Guy had a cameo role as a priest in the movie Li Jia Da Yuan in which his eldest son, Alexander, won a lead role as Jerry Li."

  "text" : "Jesse Edwards (born 1977) is a professional American fine art oil painter, graffiti artist, and ceramicist born in Hayden Lake, Idaho. He works and lives in Seattle and New York City. Edwards is a distinguished member of the Mystic Sons of Morris Graves. Jesse's beginnings in art started with graffiti, which he began practicing as a youth growing up in Snohomish, WA. He has since traveled from Seattle to the East Coast and Spain, leaving his mark along the way. Edwards, who likes to refer to his graffiti as installation art, tends toward figurative representations of celebrities, friends, and self-portraits. “I like pictures,” says Edwards, “you don't have to be graffiti-literate to read pictures. In separate works, dead celebrities Anna Nicole Smith and rapper Tupac Shakur are depicted with children in tender embraces, evoking something like a streetwise Mary Cassatt. When asked how his work is perceived by other graffiti artists, Edwards boasts, “They love it. They flip.” Jesse graduated from Snohomish High School, after which he spent one year studying the art of the Old Masters in Seattle's public libraries. In 1999, he was accepted into Cornish College of the Arts on a Nellie Scholarship. Cornish later threw him out of school for verbally abusing a professor. About being kicked out of Cornish, Edwards said, “I knew they wouldn't like what I had to say, but I figured I would go out with a bang.” Edwards went on to study at the Gage Academy (then called the Seattle Academy of Realist Art), where he was offered a second chance in the form of another scholarship. Edwards stayed for four years. Edwards' outwardly thuggish persona and high-profile antics are well-known attributes of his public image. In 2009, Edwards was considered for the BRAVO reality art TV show, Work of Art: The Next Great Artist. A prolific painter, Edwards uniformly composes his works using oils on stretched linen and employs techniques such as underpainting and extensive glazing to emulate the style of the old masters. His stylistic landscapes show influence from the Impressionist painters, especially Claude Monet. Edwards' figurative work typically uses juxtaposition between style and subject matter and has been criticized for featuring pornography, illicit paraphernalia, and other controversial subjects. He has cited contemporary painter John Currin as a major influence, whose work features similarly inflammatory themes. Edwards is a close associate of master ceramicist Charles Wing Krafft. Krafft has been recognized internationally for his series of \"Disasterware\" which manipulates aesthetic qualities of 16th century Dutch Delftware (or Delft pottery) while using themes that reflect modern realities. It was Krafft who introduced Edwards to ceramics, instructing him through months of private study. Jesse’s ceramic art has since earned him gallery representation, critical acclaim, and attention from the New York Times, among others. Jesse Edwards moved to New York City in 2011 and is represented by Vito Schnabel."

Since 1970 he has been a professor in the sociology department at the University of California, Davis, where he is now Professor of Sociology Emeritus. In the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s Lofland did field work among peace demonstrators in the United States and in Europe. He has undertaken administrative roles in several social science associations and contributed as an editor or associate editor to sociological publications.

  "text" : "Jens Scheer (30 May 1935 – 18 July 1994), was a physicist, professor of nuclear physics at the University of Bremen and one of Germany's best-known anti-nuclear activists. Scheer was member of the Communist Party of Germany party (KPD). For reason of his KPD-membership and his political activities, Scheer was threatened in 1975 with the loss of his academic position at the University of Bremen and an interdiction of enacting his profession, as membership in the KPD and his position as university professor were considered incompatible. The legal proceedings lasted for about five years, after which the final verdict was the payment of a fine. One of Scheer's main research interests was low-level radiation and its effects on human beings. He claimed that radiation exposure at critical moments in life weakens the immune system, thus leading to a higher susceptibility to infectious diseases. After the Chernobyl disaster of 1986, he invested considerable efforts in attempting to determine the extent of damage caused in the longer term by this disaster. In an article, Scheer claimed that low-level radiation had caused the death of millions, when all direct and indirect effects of radiation are taken together. His view was criticized as unfounded. Scheer also published on several stochastic models proposed in the context of quantum theory, in particular those advanced by Jean-Pierre Vigier and by J.C. Aron, and he criticized a prevalence of positivism in quantum physics. In 1994, Scheer died of heart failure."

He was the son and pupil of Gregorio Espinal, who was also a painter, but he afterwards entered the school of Domingo Martinez, whose daughter he married. He was chosen director of the School of Design which Cean Bermudez and other lovers of art established at Seville. Cean Bermudez says that he possessed more genius than any of his contemporaries, and but for his bad training and indolence would have been the best painter whom Seville had produced since the time of Murillo. A visit to Madrid late in life made apparent his misspent time, and he returned saddened and abashed to Seville, where he died in 1783. His chief works were scenes from the life of St. Jerome, painted for the monastery of San Geronimo de Buenavista, and now in the Seville Museum, and some frescoes in the collegiate church of San Salvador."

In 1862 he rebuilt the medieval timber-framed God's Providence House in Chester, which has been described as \"the first conservation case in the modern sense\". He designed new churches in Gothic Revival style, some of which have been designated as listed buildings, including Holy Ascension Church, Upton by Chester, Holy Trinity Church, Capenhurst, St Luke's Church, Dunham on the Hill, and Holy Trinity Church, Chester. Harrison also made alterations to other churches, including the virtual rebuilding of St Michael's Church, Chester, rebuilding the nave of All Saints Church, Handley, and working on the tower of the Church of St Mary-on-the Hill, Chester. He designed the Trustee Savings Bank in Chester, and converted the medieval St Nicholas' Chapel in Chester into a concert hall. Harrison worked for Robert Balfour, building farms on his Bolesworth estate, and at Tattenhall Hall."

His brother, Tom Keegan, was an organiser for William Holman and would later become a member of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly. John was elected to the New South Wales Legislative Council in 1925 as a Labor Party councillor; he was also a longtime member and official of the Amalgamated Society of Carpenters and Joiners. He moved to Sydney due to his third wife's illness in 1925 and worked for Sydney Municipal Council until he fractured his elbow. He supported the Legislative Council's abolition in accordance with party policy and focused on child endowment and workers' compensation in the Council. He found work with the Department of Public Works and became a gardener in the Botanic Gardens, but in 1927 he was dismissed by Agriculture Minister Harold Thorby, who allegedly found workers engaged in political business during their shifts. He gradually came to oppose Jack Lang's leadership and did not renominate for the newly reconstituted Council in 1934. He ran for the 1934 federal election as the Federal Labor candidate for Parramatta and for the state seat of Annandale in 1935. He died in 1941."

In 1812 he moved to Berlin, where he met Christian Friedrich von Petersdorff and Ludwig Adolf Wilhelm von Lützow. In the summer of 1812 he went to London together with several Tyroleans in order to appeal for support in the fight against Napoleon. From 1813 he was in the Lützow Free Corps as an active leader of a group of Tyrolean marksmen which gained fame at Lauenburg and Jülich. In September 1813 he was promoted to second lieutenant. After the First Treaty of Paris in 1814, he completed his studies in Berlin and became a supporter of Franz Anton Mesmer and his theory of animal magnetism. In 1819 he became professor of medicine in Bonn, leaving in 1837 for Innsbruck and then in 1841 settling in Munich, where he earned a great reputation as a \"magnetic physician.\" He died in Egern (now Rottach-Egern) by Lake Tegernsee in southern Germany. A Viennese street, the Ennemosergasse, was named after him in 1955."

At the suggestion of Henry Barnard he was recruited in 1853 to become Barnard's successor as principal of the Connecticut State Normal School. This was followed by a term as Connecticut superintendent of common schools from 1855 to late 1856. In December 1856 he was elected superintendent of public schools in Boston, serving with one short interruption until March 1878. The Quincy School in Boston, which he co-founded, was the first school in the United States with grades, as opposed to one room with all students. He was a frequent writer on educational topics and contributor to educational journals. He served as president of the National Educational Association and both the Connecticut and Massachusetts Teachers Associations, and was for ten years a member of the Massachusetts State Board of Education. His publications include City School Systems in the United States (Washington: Govt. Printing Office, 1885). A public elementary school in Boston's Roslindale neighborhood is named in his honor."

He moved to Airdrie in 1926 and won most of his international honours with them. Motherwell signed Crapnell from Airdrie in 1932 for a fee of £2,000. He helped Motherwell reach the 1933 Scottish Cup Final, but they lost 1–0 to Celtic. He retired in 1934 to try a career in insurance. After a brief comeback in the Motherwell reserve team, he retired again. Crapnell was 5 feet 5 inches tall, which was small for a defender. He had a \"reputation for tenacity\", however, and won nine Scotland caps between 1929 and 1933. Crapnell captained the team in four of those appearances. He is the most capped player in Airdrie history. Crapnell also represented the Scottish League XI five times, between 1929 and 1932. Crapnell then became a manager after the Second World War, working for Alloa and then St Johnstone. He died in December 1991, aged 88."

In 2010, Campbell won the Grant Hattam Quill Award for Investigative Journalism in any Medium from the Melbourne Press Club for a story about the conduct of the Victorian Director of Public Prosecutions Jeremy Rapke that led to his resignation. In 2013, he became the Herald Sun and Sunday Herald Sun's political editor and broke a story based on secret tapes discussing highly sensitive political matters that he says led to the sudden resignation of Victorian Premier Ted Baillieu. Campbell subsequently won the 2013 Monash University Gold Quill and the Walkley Foundation's 2013 \"Scoop of the Year\" for the story. Prior to becoming a journalist, Campbell worked as a Liberal staffer, advising Helen Shardey, the Victorian Shadow Minister for Health at the time."

Singer's mother was a Polish immigrant who had begun buying and operating rooming houses in the early 1900s. By the age of 11, Jack was helping with the books and, at the age of 17, he bought his first building in Calgary. In 1981, Singer took a friend up on an offer to visit Francis Ford Coppola's studio where One from the Heart was being filmed. When the movie flopped, Coppola's studio went into receivership; Singer subsequently purchased the studio during a bank auction in which he placed the only bid. In October 2011, the Los Angeles city council created a special resolution honouring Singer for his \"vital role in the revitalization of the District of Hollywood\" and for his work in establishing the Hollywood Center Studio as a \"world-class resource for feature film and commercial production.\" Singer died on February 2, 2013."

He was born in New York State, and excelled at sports winning championships in boxing and swimming. He later attended New York University where he received a law degree. He had an interest in flying and during World War II Colonel Reiter served as a B-24 Liberator Consolidated B-24 Liberator pilot in the Army Air Forces, flying over North Africa and Italy. He was shot down over Foggia in Italy in 1943  and taken prisoner by the Germans. He was sent to an Italian prison hospital as he had dislocated both his thighs on landing. He later escaped from the hospital before his legs were properly mended when he learned he was being moved to Germany. He had managed to get fairly fit but his thighs were still partly dislocated. He lived with the partisans (Garibaldi Brigade Romagna under Riccardo Fedel) in the Apennines for some months. He joined up with a group of British officers who had escaped from Castello di Vincigliata prison PG 12 camp during the Italian Armistice in September 1943. They included Brigadier ‘Rudolf’ Vaughan, Lieutenant-Colonel John Combe (John Frederick Boyce Combe), Brigadier ‘Ted’ Todhunter, (Edward Joseph Todhunter), Captain Guy Ruggles-Brise (Guy E Ruggles-Brise) and Lieutenant, ‘Dan’ Ranfurly, (Thomas Daniel Knox, 6th Earl of Ranfurly). In March 1944 with the help of Italian guides they made an astonishing 250 mile walk across the mountains to keep a rendezvous with agents on the coast. The travelling was difficult through snow, and the efforts of ‘Rudolph’ Vaughan with his game leg and Jack Reiter with his dislocated thighs became an inspiration to them all. The eventually reached the coast and after unexpected delays found a fishing boat laid up on the sands. Jack and Dan Ranfurly found a mast  whilst others secured a rudder and oars. In May they sailed the leaking boat about seventy miles along the coast just past the front line and were taken in tow by a passing Italian fishing boat into Ortona Harbour. After he returned to the United States, he put his experience to use by training military personnel in escape and survival techniques behind enemy lines. Colonel Reiter was later posted by the Air Force to Italy and as a senior briefing officer to General Curtis LeMay at Strategic Air Command headquarters. After leaving the Air Force, Reiter became a member of the Air Force Association and Army Navy Country Club in Arlington, Virginia. He was vice president for government affairs for World Airways and the Washington representative for Flying Tigers International and Japan Airlines. He served  as president of the Aero Club of Washington in 1976. He died at the age of 78 and was survived by his wife, Helen N. Reiter and two children, Allan James Reiter and Kathleen N. Ausley."

Hill was the son of Roger Hill of Poundisford and his wife Mary Hassard of Lyme Regis. He became an ironmonger. With Dennis Bond he was made a constable of Dorchester in 1618. On 11 September 1621 he was appointed the first Governor of the Company of Freemen. Later he replaced John Yeate as an Alderman of Dorchester and a week later was appointed a Capital Burgesse. He was an enthusiastic supporter of John White's schemes to create a godly community. In 1624 he invested in the Dorchester Company and was a member of a circle known as the New England Parliament which met in the'Free School in Dorchester. In October 1624 he was elected as Bailiff. In 1628, Hill was elected Member of Parliament for Dorchester and sat until 1629 when King Charles decided to rule without parliament for eleven years. In 1631 he was elected steward of the Seaton Parsonage where he was responsible for holding funds and for collecting tithes. He was elected treasurer of the county at the Quarter Sessions in Sherborne on 30 April 1633. In 1636 he was elected Mayor of Dorchester. During this time he owned several privateers. He held the Seaton Stewardship until 1642 at the start of the Civil War. In 1643 when Dorchester was threatened by the Royalists, Hill and other merchants in the town tried to send their goods to safety by ship from Weymouth, but it was captured. Nevertheless, the war presented opportunities to make money and among other things sold provisions to the besiegers of Sherborne. He appears to have left Dorchester during the war and moved to London. Hill died before 4 January 1658 when his will was proved in London. He left £100 for an endowment known as the Hill Exhibition to support a poor scholar from Dorchester at one of the universities. Hill married Sarah Davidge, widow of Thomas Davidge merchant of Dorchester and daughter of John Green merchant of Dorchester in about 1617. They had at least a son and two daughters. His wife died in 1631."

He was a notable figure of Polish independence efforts in the nineteenth century. He studied medicine in Berlin, and following graduation remained in the city as a military doctor (1826–1831). After a stint as a garrison doctor at Strzalkow, near Wreschen, he was transferred to Lissa, where he served as a military physician. At Lissa he distinguished himself in his skillful work dealing with the severely wounded. In 1848 Metzig began openly working for greater autonomy for the Polish people, proposing the creation of an independent state with its own parliament, constitution and university. His efforts in this cause did not sit well with German authorities. When the military decided to transfer him to Glogau, Metzig refused the move, choosing to stay in Lissa, where he opened a private medical practice. Here he worked tirelessly for the cause of Polish independence until his death in 1868."

The spies were sent to Britain in preparation for the planned German invasion, which never arrived. When questioned by the Intelligence Services Waldberg told them that he would soon be in charge. At his trial Waldberg finally realised the seriousness of his situation and told the court that he'd only taken the mission because his father was in trouble with the Gestapo. Waldberg also admitted that he wasn't a fully trained spy, but that he was studying it. During the entire Second World War, Waldberg was the only ethnic German who actually volunteered to go to Britain to spy. In total 116 spies were sent. The three caught with him were Dutch, which caused the British authorities to detain all asylum seekers from Europe and screen them, or in some cases detain them on the Isle of Man. These were the first executions under the Treason Act. They both spoke good English, and carried papers showing them to be Dutch refugees from the Nazis."

  "text" : "John Van Mons Lindley (5 November 1838 – 18 September 1918), Pomologist and early Nurseryman, was born in Monrovia, Indiana. He was also known as John Van Lindley, but as an adult preferred the name J. Van Lindley. He was the second son of Joshua Lindley, one of the earliest Pomologists in both Indiana and North Carolina and a prominent Quaker. He was the great-great-grandson of Thomas Lindley, Sr., on whose land the Battle of Lindley's Mill was fought. J. Van Lindley’s family moved to North Carolina when he was three years old. J. Van grew up first in Chatham County (now Alamance County) and then Guilford County. In Guilford County he was part of the Quaker New Garden Monthly Meeting. His strong Quaker upbringing led him to take up the Union cause and he served three years during the civil war with the 4th Regiment of the Missouri State Militia (Union) Cavalry. Following the war, he returned to Greensboro, NC where he restarted his father’s nursery business, paid off the $5000 of debt accumulated during the war, and then started Pomona Hills Nursery about 1877. J. Van built his nursery business deliberately until he owned over 900 acres in the town of Pomona, on the west side of Greensboro. Not satisfied with the 22,000 customers he had by the early 1900s when he re-incorporated as J. Van Lindley Nurseries, he also branched out into other businesses. He started Pomona Terra Cotta with Angus Smith in 1886. In 1892 he started the J. Van Lindley Orchard Company, bought 1000 acres of land west of Southern Pines and planted 60,000 peach trees; starting the large-scale peach industry in Moore County. He donated 60 acres for a recreation complex including a man-made lake, named Lindley Park, in Greensboro, NC in 1902. He started several insurance and banking companies in Guilford County and Forsyth County, including the Security Life and Annuity Company of Greensboro, which merged in 1912 with Jefferson Standard Life Insurance Company, later becoming Jefferson-Pilot Life Insurance Company. He also owned 1000 acres in Harnett County which were sold in the 1930s to Isabel Rockefeller and are now part of Fort Bragg."

  "text" : "Joseph Oklahombi (May 1, 1895, Bokchito, Bryan County, Oklahoma - April 13, 1960) was an American soldier of the Choctaw nation. He was the most-decorated World War I soldier from Oklahoma. He served in Company D, First Battalion, 141st Regiment, Seventy-first Brigade of the Thirty-sixth Infantry Division during World War I, where he was one of the Choctaw code talkers. On October 8, 1918, Private Oklahombi was at St. Etienne, France. He and 23 other soldiers attacked an enemy position and captured 171 Germans while killing some 79 more. They held their position for four days while under attack.  Oklahombi was awarded the Silver Star with Victory Ribbon, and the Croix de Guerre from France's Marshal Henri-Philippe Petain. At the time the members of the Choctaw nation were not formally U.S. citizens. Oklahombi was married and had a son. He was killed on 13 April 1960 when hit by a truck while walking along a road. He was buried with military honors at Yashau Cemetery in Broken Bow, Oklahoma. From Chief Gary Batton of the Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma: \"Many of you know the story of the Choctaw Code Talkers of WWI and WWII and also the story of Code Talker Joseph Oklahombi, who single-handedly captured 171 Germans after moving 200 yards over open ground against artillery and machine gun fire, rushing a machine gun nest and capturing one of the guns. He not only turned the gun on the enemy for four days, keeping them under fire, he was without food and water those four days, killing numerous enemy soldiers until the rest surrendered. Although General Pershing awarded Oklahombi the Silver Star and Marshal Pétain, former Commander-in-Chief of the French Armies of the East, awarded him the Croix de Guerre, the Congressional Medal of Honor was never presented. It is a long-overdue recognition and I am working to see the Medal of Honor presented to Oklahombi.\""

  "text" : "John Chillag (April 20, 1927 – March 21, 2009) was an Austrian Holocaust survivor and author. Born in Vienna, he fled with his family to Hungary in 1934 to avoid Nazi Germany's expanding sphere of influence, however during the German occupation of Hungary in 1944 he and his family were placed in a 5,000 strong Jewish ghetto in Győr, then taken to Auschwitz. Between 30 and 60 relatives died there, including his Czechoslovakian-born mother, however he and his father were selected for manual labour and taken to Bochum to work for Bouchumer Verein, a steel plant. His father died there in 1945, and Chillag was force-marched to Buchenwald concentration camp where he was liberated by the Allies two weeks later and given medical treatment. Chillag emigrated to Australia after the war, having found no surviving family back in Hungary and being unable to remake the family business following the arrival of communism. Marrying a British-born expatriate in 1950, he worked for the Australian Atomic Energy Commission between 1957 and 1963, living in Sydney. He moved to Leeds, England in 1962, to work in Boston Spa until retirement, whereupon he became a European Information Officer for Leeds Metropolitan University. His daughter, diagnosed with Down's syndrome, prompted him to work voluntarily with Mencap, and he continued to give lectures on his experiences at the Imperial War Museum. In 2004, he published his memoirs, The Odyssey of John Chillag, a Hungarian Jew Born in Vienna 2006: From Győr in Hungary to Australia and England Via Auschwitz and Buchenwald."

Banderas was able to convince the Mayos, Opatas and Pimas to join in the war against the Mexicans. In 1827 Banderas' forces suffered defeat due to using primarily bows and arrows against the Mexicans guns. Banderas then negotiated a peace in which he was pardoned and made the captain-general of the Yaqui towns. In 1829 Occidente instituted a new plan to tax the Yaqui and also to allot their lands. They also ended the office of captain-general. Banderas decided to wait until he had better weapons to act. By 1832 he had enough guns and gunpowder to feel confident of some success in war with the Mexicans. His force of 1,000 including Opatas under the command of Delores Guittierez was defeated near Buenavista in 1833. He was then captured and executed."

  "text" : "Justin Matthews (1876–1955) was an Arkansas road and bridge builder as well as real estate developer. He helped to design and expand many areas in central Arkansas. The Arkansas Gazette's 1955 obituary said the businessman was credited for living, \"on the high ground overlooking North Little Rock;\" For having \"transformed a wilderness into a great community with homes, stores, schools,churches and service establishments.\" The obit went on to laude \"his imagination and vision, his boldness, his dynamic energy and his driving force that prevailed against formidable obstacles.\" He developed a pair of neighborhoods dotted with houses he had built. He then sold either the structures or the house lots in between or even offered up his company's services to build a similarly sized and valued house on the newly purchased site. Not all of his elaborate residences are listed with the National Register of Historic Places, however several are recognized. The majority of his more grand houses are located in the Edgemont area of Park Hill while the lesser homes are in the Crestwood neighborhood. These two residential sections are divided by the Sylvian Hills Highway, which was renamed and is today John F. Kennedy Blvd. in North Little Rock, Arkansas He is also credited with the design and development of the Lakewood residential area of North Little Rock, multiple lakes in the community and his greatest claim to fame was thebuilding of The T.R. Pugh Memorial Park, also known as The Old Mill. He gave several properties to the city of North Little Rock to be developed into vest-pocket sized parks. Altheimer Park on Plainview Circle, the W. C. Faucette Memorial Plot Park at the corner of Cherry Hill and JFK, the Boy Scout Park located at D. Street /Cedar and Goshen along with other sites... He was born in 1876 near Monticello, Arkansas. He was formally trained as a pharmacist but developed his fortune in cotton seed oil. In 1911 he moved to Little Rock, Arkansas. He built roads, bridges and invested in and developed real estate on the north side of the Arkansas River. He was wed twice. His first wife was Mary Agnes Somers Matthews, who died Nov. 22nd, 1933. The couple are buried side-by-side on the front row of Mount Holly Cemetery in downtown Little Rock, Arkansas. The gravesites are marked by a pair of distinctively carved religious figures - Joseph holding the Christ child; along with the Virgin Mary, both monuments were fashioned from white marble. He was survived by his second wife, Robin. His last residence was a new brick home situated on a block-sized lawn on Cherry Hill in North Little Rock, Arkansas. Non-licensed architect Frank Carmean, a gifted and well respected talent, was employed by the Justin Matthews Company. He copied famed structures in California and created new designs for Matthews' Arkansas clients."

Chick started working fiddle contests, square dances and random radio shows in the early part of his career. Gene Stripling (no relation) hired Chick on the spot in 1939 to work at Atlanta’s radio station WSB for the “Barn Dance Show.” Chick worked there for the better part of 8 years and was one of the most popular fiddler/comedians to be heard in Atlanta. Stripling would periodically leave the “Barn Dance Show” to tour with Bill Monroe, and by 1958 he asked Jim and Jesse McRynolds if he could start working on the WVOP Valdosta radio show. He was also known to work with Flatt and Scruggs, toured with Ernest Tubb and played the fiddle for Johnny Carson at political rallies in the 1946 race for governor in Georgia. Chick also played the bass fiddle for Jimmy Martin and the Stanley Brothers in 1962. One of his last jobs was in 1966, playing with the New River Boys as a comedian. Stripling died November 19, 1970, in Virginia."

His family moved to Edwardsburgh, Upper Canada, shortly after the War of 1812. Jackson was given his deacon's orders in 1818, at the Genesee conference. He was reassigned to the Long Point circuit in 1819, where he rode alongside William Rundle. Membership in the Episcopal church increased by 7, to 511, on that circuit that year. In 1820, he was reassigned to the Long Point circuit, where he road alongside William Williams. Although competition in Upper Canada between the Methodist Episcopal Church, of which Jackson was a member, and the Methodist Church of Great Britain led to an overall decrease in membership in the Episcopal church, Long Point saw an increase in membership of one hundred and two people. Egerton Ryerson lived in the Long Point area, and Jackson and Williams cajoled him into giving an exhortation, which went disastrously. In 1821, he was assigned to the Westminister circuit, where he rode alongside George Ferguson. The pair oversaw an increase in church membership of twenty-six. In 1822, he was assigned to the Thames circuit, where he rode alongside William Griffis. The pair oversaw an increase in church membership of thirty four people. At the 1822 Genesee conference, a motion was presented to expel Jackson from the Methodist church. Although it failed to carry, a motion suspending his ordination. Jackson was one of the chief organizers of the Canadian Wesleyan Methodist Church. At its peak the church had 7000 members. The church eventually merged into the Methodist Church of Canada in 1874."

Clements became the first president of Davis College, which was then called \"Practical Bible College,\" a training school for Baptist evangelists. He led the school from the time of the its conception, in a simple classroom on 47 Harrison Street, until 1914, when the Bible-training school and evangelistic academy had found permanent residence in Johnson City, NY. Clements has written supposedly over 5,000 hymns, most of which were founded on soul redemption inside the love of God. As an example of this, the refrain from one of his hymns:\"Weary soul, cease thy repining. Burdened one, God's ways are right. Every cloud has silver lining. God can give you songs by night.\""

In 1878, he came to Birmingham and after leaving school entered the Broad Street offices of Messrs. Nettlefold and Co. (later GKN). Subsequently he resigned his post and became managing director of Kynoch Ltd, a position he retained for many years. He was also chairman of Thomas Smith's Stampings Ltd, and a director of Henry Hope and Sons Ltd for a considerable period. In 1898 he entered the City Council as a representative of Edgbaston and Harborne Ward, and remained a Councillor until 1911. In addition to his work for social reform Nettlefold was interested in charitable and philanthropic movements. For several years he was honorary secretary, and afterwards chairman of the Women’s Hospital, and a liberal subscriber to its funds. He was also at one time honorary treasurer of the Graham Street Charity School, and took a keen interest in the work of the Fazeley Street Mission. Nettlefold was a Justice of the Peace for Worcestershire, and also a magistrate for the city of Birmingham. Whilst living in Birmingham Nettlefold commissioned a home for his family from the architect Joseph Lancaster Ball. The resulting Arts and Crafts style house was called Winterbourne and it and its grounds are open to the public, the latter forming the University of Birminghams' Winterbourne Botanic Garden. Nettlefold's most notable contribution was to the improvement of public housing in Birmingham for the working classes. In 1901, as the chairman of Birmingham's new Housing Committee he extended the city's slum clearance works. His publications on urban planning included \"Slum Reform and Town Planning\", and \"Practical Housing\"."

  "text" : "As a journalist, Hamilton reported in the United States and abroad for the Milwaukee Journal, the Christian Science Monitor, and ABC radio. He was a longtime commentator for MarketPlace, broadcast nationally by Public Radio International. His work has appeared in the New York Times, The Washington Post Foreign Affairs, and The Nation, among other publications. In the 1980s, the National Journal said Hamilton has shaped public opinion about the complexity of the U.S.-Third World relations \"more than any other single journalist.\" In government, Hamilton oversaw nuclear non-proliferation issues for the House Foreign Affairs Committee, served in the State Department during the Carter administration as an advisor to the head of the U.S. foreign aid program in Asia, and managed a World Bank program to educate Americans about economic development. He served in Vietnam as a Marine Corps platoon commander and in Okinawa as a reconnaissance company commander. In his twenty years as an LSU administrator, Hamilton was founding dean of the Manship School and executive vice-chancellor and provost. While he was dean, the Manship School created a one-of-a-kind doctoral degree devoted to media and public affairs, and launched the Reilly Center for Media & Public Affairs and a related opinion research facility. The number of majors more than doubled as did the size of the faculty and staff; the school's endowment more than sextupled. Hamilton serves on the boards of the International Center for Journalists, of which he is treasurer., and the Lamar Corporation. With Tom Rosenstiel, he co-chairs the American Press Institute Research Advisory Group, organized to develop academic research useful to journalists. In the 1980s he established a foreign news project for the Society of Professional Journalists and for the American Society of Newspaper editors. Hamilton is author or co-author of six books and editor of many more. Slate interviewed Hamilton to discuss his latest book on American newsgathering abroad. The book won the Goldsmith Prize, among other awards. In 2002 he was a Shorenstein Fellow at Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government. He is a member of the Council on Foreign Relations and the Metropolitan Club of Washington. Hamilton earned his bachelor's and master's degrees in journalism from Marquette and Boston University respectively, and a doctorate in American Civilization from George Washington University."

  "text" : "John Nicholson (born 1864 died 1932) was club secretary for Sheffield United for over 30 years. During this period the club did not employ a 'manager' but Nicholson undertook many of the duties currently associated with a modern-day football manager. Born in Attercliffe in Sheffield Nicholson was originally a lawyer's clerk who was active with the Sheffield and Hallamshire FA as well as secretary of Attercliffe F.C. In 1899 he was offered the post of club secretary at Sheffield United when the club became a Limited Company and remained in the role until his death. Although the team was coached by a trainer and selected by a committee, Nicholson ran the club on a day-to-day basis, dealing with transfers and other finances, liaising with the Football Association and looking after the players general affairs. Regarded as one of the most respected men in football at the time he had a vast number of contacts throughout the game and was an expert in the rules, laws and regulations of the sport. Nicholson presided over the most successful period in The Blades history, winning four FA Cups in 1899, 1902, 1915 and 1925 (also reaching the final in 1901) and maintaining United as a dominant league force, although winning the Championship eluded him. Despite never holding the post of manager at The Blades he was offered just such a position at Manchester City in 1926 but turned it down, preferring to remain in his home town. Nicholson died in 1932 after being knocked down by a lorry whilst crossing the road outside Sheffield Midland Station whilst on his way to join the team who were heading off to Birmingham to play a match against Aston Villa. Local newspaper reports estimated that over 6,000 people attended his funeral."

  "text" : "John E. Nail, also known as Jack Nail, (August 22, 1883 - March 6, 1947) was an African-American real estate agent in New York City. He founded a business called The Nail-Parker Company in partnership with Henry G. Parker. His sister was Grace Nail Johnson, wife of James Weldon Johnson. Nail got his start in the real estate business working for Philip A. Payton, Jr.'s Afro-American Realty Company, another real estate firm catering to African-American customers in New York City. In 1905, he founded the Nail-Parker Company with Henry G. Parker. In 1911, Nail, together with his pastor, Rev. Hutchens C. Bishop of St. Philip's Episcopal Church, bought over a million dollars worth of real estate in the Harlem area of New York City. Starting in the late nineteenth century, African Americans began moving from the southern United States into the New York City area. Nail realized that most of these new arrivals were not financially able to purchase homes, and began converting or constructing apartments on his land purchases. By 1925, Nail's business owned around fifty apartment buildings in the Harlem area. Nail became the most important Black real estate agent in New York City, and sat on the Real Estate Board of New York and the Housing Committee of New York; in each case he was the only African-American member. After the Great Depression struck, Nail's business went bankrupt in 1933. Nail attempted to restart successor businesses but was unable to get them off the ground. Nail died in 1947. His work left Harlem a community of renters rather than owners, and led ultimately to the area being populated by working-class tenements."

  "text" : "James Joseph Callanan, Irish poet, was born in Cork city in 1795, died 19 September 1829 at the Hospital of San Jose, Lisbon, Portugal. He studied at Maynooth for the priesthood but left in 1816 after determining he had no vocation. He returned to Cork to become a tutor, though he subsequently entered Trinity College, Dublin, on an aborted idea of legal studies. His financial recources now exhausted he enlisted in the 18th Royal Irish but was bought out by some friends. In 1823 he was for a few months an assistant as the school of a Doctor Maginn in the city. Maginn introduced him to Blackwood's Magazine to which Callanan became a contributor, as well as to other magazines. According to the 1878 Compendium of Irish Biography. \"During six years, and up to 1829, he spent most of his time in rambling through the country, collecting old ballads and legends, and giving them a new dress in a new tongue. His health began to fail, however, a warmer climate appeared desirable, and early in 1829 he became tutor in the family of an Irish gentleman at Lisbon. In a few months it is stated that he acquired sufficient of the language to make translations from Portuguese poetry. He also set about preparing his writings for publication in a collected form. His health, however, daily declined, and after a fruitless effort to gather strength for the voyage home, he died 19th September 1829, aged 33. Mr. Waller writes of him in these words: \"Thoroughly acquainted with the romantic legends of his country, he was singularly happy in the graces and power of language, and the feeling and beauty of his sentiments. There is in his compositions little of that high classicality which marks the scholar; but they are full of exquisite simplicity and tenderness, and in his description of natural scenery he is unrivalled. His lines on Gougane Barra are known to every tourist that visits the romantic regions of the south of Ireland, and his longer poems possess great merit.\" Allibone styles this poem \"the most perfect perhaps of all Irish minor poems in the melody of its rhythm, the flow of its language, and the weird force of its expressions.\" No trace of his grave in Lisbon now remains."

  "text" : "John Penikett (25 December 1819 – date of death unknown) was an English cricketer. Skinner's batting and bowling styles are unknown. John Penikett was born in Henfield, Sussex. A round-arm bowler, Penikett played for the Henfield Cricket Club from 1842 to 1868. In the middle of the 19th century, the Village of Henfield provided seven players for the Sussex County team, among them John Penikett. On 30 August 1867, in a match against Broadwater, Penikett scored 121 runs, the first century ever recorded by a Henfield-born player at Henfield. Penikett made his first-class debut for Sussex against the Marylebone Cricket Club in 1850. He made three further first-class appearances, the last of which came against the Marylebone Cricket Club in 1851. In his four first-class matches, he scored 16 runs at an average of 2.66, with a high score of 6. With the ball, he took a single wicket, though his bowling average and best figures are unknown due to incomplete records. John Penikett was the great-grandfather of Eric John Penikett, the last survivor of RAF Squadron 87, which fought the Luftwaffe over northern France in the early days of the second world war and the great-great-great-grandfather of actor John Tahmoh Penikett."

  "text" : "John Janvrin (29 August 1762 – 22 December 1835) was a businessman, politician, militia officer, and justice of the peace in Canada. Born in Jersey, Janvrin sailed to Isle Madame, Nova Scotia, in order there to manage Philip and Francis Janvrin and Company, his brothers' business. He then established his own business, John Janvrin and Company, in fishing and retail on Cape Breton Island. Janvrin held a number of offices during his time in Cape Breton. He was a member of the Executive Council, a Lieutenant-Colonel in the militia, and a justice of the peace. Janvrin Island belonged to John Janvrin at one point and is now named after him. While carrying on his various commercial activities after his 1815 return to Jersey, Janvrin became increasingly interested in banking and brokerage. This led to interests in London, and there is reference in correspondence to “John Janvrin & Co. of the city of London.” He was also a partner in the London brokers DeLisle, Janvrin, and DeLisle. As time went on, the Janvrin family began moving out of mercantile trade into banking and brokerage in London and on Jersey. Around the middle of the 19th century it concentrated its energies and capital in that sector of the economy."

John III. took control over the part Werle-Goldberg and his uncle John II took over Werle-Güstrow. John III built himself a castle in Goldberg. King Christopher II of Denmark promised John and Lord Henry II of Mecklenburg on 4 May 1326 that he would invest them with Rügen. However, he had earlier promised the principality to Pomerania. This led to a war, the Rügen War of Succession. Under the Peace of Brudersdorf, Pomerania was allowed to keep Rügen, but had to pay Mecklenburg 31000silver marks in compensation. From 1350, he left the business of government to his son and co-ruler Nicholas IV. On 1 April 1352, he was already terminally ill. He died later that year. He was probably buried in Malchow Abbey."

Aagaard had travelled to Asia and was concerned about Buddhism and other Eastern religions, which he felt were gaining influence in Europe. In 1973 Aagaard founded the Dialog Center which was later greatly influential in promoting a negative public opinion of cults in Denmark and other European nations. He regarded Scientology as being especially dangerous, but later in his life stated that Islam was an even greater threat. Other concerns included Satanism and New Age groups. Aagaard cooperated with both religious and secular anti-cultists, but opposed deprogramming of cult members since he felt that it was ineffective and often counterproductive. He retired from the Dialog Center in 2002."

  "text" : "John Fisher (7 June 1910 – 25 August 1960) was an Australian journalist and son of Prime Minister Andrew Fisher. Fisher was born in South Melbourne to serving Prime Minister Andrew Fisher and Margaret Jane, née Irvine. The Fishers moved to London in 1915 when Andrew became Australian High Commissioner to the United Kingdom. John was educated at Merchant Taylors' School and returned to Melbourne in 1930 as a cadet for Keith Murdoch's Herald. In 1934 Fisher was appointed publicity manager for the visit of Czechoslovakian communist Egon Erwin Kisch, who was prohibited from entering Australia by the federal government (Kisch was to speak at a congress of the Movement Against War and Fascism). Fisher was involved in having the ban overturned and returned with Kisch to Europe in March 1935, helping to translate Kisch's Australian Landfall into English. In 1935 Fisher settled in Moscow, where he worked on The Moscow News and wrote for International Literature. He travelled frequently to Brussels, London and Berlin and supported the Republicans in Spain, helping organise Australian support for the Spanish Republicans. He was assistant foreign editor for the Labor Daily and the communist Tribune until it was banned in May 1940. He unsuccessfully ran for Labor Party preselection for his father's old seat of Wide Bay, and at the 1940 federal election ran as a State Labor Party candidate for Hume, winning 4.9% of the vote. On 19 August 1941 he married Hansard stenographer Elizabeth Skelton in Sydney. On 6 June 1942 Fisher left for Vladivostok to become the ABC's war correspondent in Moscow, broadcasting until 1943. After the war he moved to Prague, where he was a freelance journalist; he was expelled from Czechoslovakia in 1949 and moved to London.

  "text" : "Joan Ruth Campbell MBE (1925–1997) was a Victorian born potter/ceramic artist. Joan Campbell was born in Geelong, Victoria in 1925. At the age of fifteen, in 1940, her family relocated to Western Australia. She took up pottery later in life, at first as just a hobby before pursuing it as a craft. She constructed a wood-fire kiln at her Scarborough home, teaching herself firing techniques. In 1959, Campbell worked with Johannes de Blanken, a Dutch potter who had moved to Western Australia. She then partnered with Eileen Keys and they resolved to use only locally available materials in their work. In 1966, the two experimented with the Raku firing techniques, which then became her preferred method of firing. Campbell held her first solo exhibition in 1969 at the Old Fire Station Gallery in Fremantle. In 1970 she travelled to the United States and worked with Paul Soldner. Campbell found herself being recognised as an exponent of Raku, and was invited in 1972 to exhibit at the International Academy of Ceramics Exhibition, with a selected group of Australian potters, at the Victoria and Albert Museum, London. In 1968 Campbell helped establish the Western Australian Branch of the Crafts Association of Australia (later Craft Association of Western Australia) as the Association's secretary. She was a foundation member of the Crafts Board of the Australia Council (which was established in 1973), and was a member of the Australia Council from 1974 to 1977. Campbell established a studio at the Old Kerosene Store building on the shore of Bathers Beach, adjacent to the ruins of the original Fremantle Jetty (south of the South Mole of Fremantle Harbour) in 1975. In 1977 she was awarded an MBE for her work in the Arts and in the same year was WA Citizen of the Year (Arts, Culture and Entertainment). Late in 1996 she was diagnosed with cancer and died on 5 March 1997."

  "text" : "Sir John Alfred Smith QPM (born 21 September 1938) is a retired British police officer with the London Metropolitan Police. Smith was educated at St Olave's and St Saviour's Grammar School in Orpington, Kent. He served with the Irish Guards from 1959 to 1962 and then joined the Metropolitan Police as a constable. In 1973 he was in charge of the Obscene Publications Squad and by 1979 he was a Detective Chief Superintendent and head of the Drugs Squad at Scotland Yard. In 1980 he was promoted to Commander and took over \"P\" District in Bromley and Lewisham. In 1981 he transferred to Surrey Constabulary as Deputy Chief Constable, but in 1984 returned to the Metropolitan Police as Deputy Assistant Commissioner in charge of the Complaints Investigation Bureau and in 1985 joined the Force Inspectorate and Force Reorganisation Team. In August 1987 he was appointed Assistant Commissioner Management Support (ACMS). In 1989 he was shortlisted for the post of Chief Constable of the Royal Ulster Constabulary, but lost out to his colleague Hugh Annesley, and in March 1990 he was shortlisted for the post of Chief Constable of West Midlands Police, but again lost out to Ronald Hadfield. In 1989 he did succeed Annesley as Assistant Commissioner Specialist Operations (ACSO). In August 1990 he became HM Inspector of Constabulary for South East England, but in April 1991 returned to the Metropolitan Police once more as Deputy Commissioner, a post he held until his retirement in 1995. As Deputy Commissioner, he introduced a number of reforms, attempting to change police culture by making officers look on themselves as a \"service\" rather than a \"force\". He was widely expected to succeed Sir Peter Imbert as Commissioner on his retirement in 1993, but the job went instead to Paul Condon. Smith also served as president of the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) in 1993–1994. He was awarded the Queen's Police Medal (QPM) in the 1986 New Year Honours and was knighted in the 1994 New Year Honours, unusually while his superior, Commissioner Paul Condon, was not a knight (Condon was knighted in the 1994 Birthday Honours). The only other time this has happened was when Deputy Commissioner Colin Woods was knighted in the 1977 Birthday Honours and Commissioner David McNee in the 1978 New Year Honours."

Jon was described as the 'Chief architect of North Korea's nuclear programme'. Jon was a general of the Korean People's Army(KPA) and a close adviser to late Kim Jong-il. Jon played a key role in the production and development of North Korean arms for more than four decades before retiring in 2011. Jon supervised the development of the country's long-range ballistic missile programmes and was involved with its first test of a nuclear device in 2006 directly. Jon was reported to help broker a deal with Pakistan during the 1990s that gave North Korea critical technology for its uranium enrichment programme in exchange for North Korea's missile technology. Jon was sanctioned by the United Nations as a result of his involvement in the country's nuclear and missile weapons programmes. He was born in Musan County, in North Hamgyong Province, and was educated at the Ural Engineering College in the Soviet Union, where he graduated in 1950. He has since held a number of positions within the North Korean military and government, and was appointed member of the National Defense Commission in February 2009. In December 2011, he was named as one of the members of the funeral committee for the late supreme leader Kim Jong-il. He has been described as \"a talented writer with an excellent knowledge of policy and process.\" On 7 July 2014 Jon Pyong-ho died of acute myocardial infarction at the age of 88.

A grand-nephew of Irish Patriot politician and member of Dublin Corporation John Binns, he and his brother Benjamin moved to London and became involved with the politically radical London Corresponding Society, closely aligned with the Society of United Irishmen. As a result of his activities he was imprisoned several times for treason but was released after a two-year term as part of a general amnesty. According to A Compendium of Irish Biography (1878), \"Soon after his release, in 1801, he emigrated, with his brother Benjamin, to Baltimore. In March 1802, he commenced at Northumberland, Pennsylvania, the Republican Argus, which gave him great influence with the Democratic party. From 1807 to 1829 he conducted, at Philadelphia, the Democratic Press — the leading paper in the state, until 1824, when it opposed the election of Jackson. Besides other works, he published in 1854 an autobiography. He died at Philadelphia, 16th June 1860, aged 87.\""

However, a dispute arose between Albert II and John's mother, and she then chose Lord Nicholas III of Werle-Güstrow as his guardian. After Nicholas's death, John IV ruled for himself. On 31 October 1366, he closed a marriage contract with Duke Albert II and his sons, in which he was promised he could marru Euphemia, the forur-year-old daughter of Albert's son Henry III. The marriage was planned for 1379, when she would be 17 years old. However, John IV died in 1374, so the marriage never took place. He died in 1374, unmarried and childless. With his death, the Werle-Goldberg line died out and Werle-Goldberg fell to Bernard II of Werle-Güstrow. He was probably buried in the Doberan Minster."

He is a graduate of Columbia University (BA) and the University of Wisconsin-Madison, MS & PhD (Geography). He was elected to the National Academy of Sciences and AAAS. He has been a fellow at the Russell Sage Foundation, the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral and Social Sciences, and the Woodrow Wilson Center and has been a Guggenheim fellow. Wolpert is a nationally cited scholar in the fields of location theory, urban development, migration, public and social services, and the nonprofit sector.and charity and philanthropy in the United States, and has testified before Congress. He has challenged conservatives who believe that charity is the best way to care for the needy and poor. Wolpert served as Vice President, then President of the Association of American Geographers and Vice President of the Regional Science Association and was elected to the American Institute of Certified Planners. Wolpert's earliest research focused on testing social theory based upon spatial data, losses in productivity related to environmental risk and imperfect information, the migration decision, the relation between commuting and migration, locating amenity and \"nimby\" facilities, disaster evacuation, and the closing of mental health facilities. More recently, his studies concerned the nonprofit marketplace in cities, nonprofit service representation and saturation of neighborhoods, locational variations in generosity, distributional effects of foundations, the fiscal viability of nonprofits, and methods for planning for evaluating nonprofit organizations and foundations."

  "text" : "Jules-Auguste Gosselet (19 April 1832 – 20 March 1916) was a French geologist born in Cambrai. Following unsuccessful studies of pharmacy, and a stint as a mathematics teacher at the Lycée du Quesnoy, he pursued a career in natural history. In 1853 he became a preparateur of geology at the Sorbonne, later obtaining his doctorate with a thesis titled Mémoire sur les terrains primaires de la Belgique, des environs d'Avesnes et du Boulonnais (1860). He later taught high school physics and chemistry in Bordeaux, afterwards serving as an instructor of natural history at the Faculty of Poitiers. In 1864 he was appointed to the chair of geology at the recently established Faculty of Lille. In 1913 he became a non-resident member of the Academy of Sciences. Gosselet is remembered for his geological studies of northern France, as demonstrated by the title of one of his better known works:  Esquisse géologique du Nord de la France et des contrées voisines (Geological sketches of Nord and neighboring regions), (1880). Other significant writings include a geological treatise on the Ardennes, L'Ardenne (1888), and hydrogeological research on the aquifers of Nord, Leçons sur les nappes aquifères du Nord (1887). Also, he is credited with providing a thorough description of the geological beds in the limestone at Étrœungt (schistes et calcaire d’Etroeungt). In the field of paleontology, he performed pioneer \"zoometric\" research of a species of brachiopod known as Spirifer verneuilli (Etudes sur les variations du Spirifer Verneuilli). Since 1910, the Prix Gosselet is awarded every four years for accomplishments made in the field of applied geology. The mineral gosseletite, a phase of manganian andalusite, is named after him."

  "text" : "Sir Joseph Grant Pilling, KCB (born 8 July 1945) is a retired British civil servant, currently serving on the boards of the Koestler Trust and Macmillan Cancer Support. He was educated at Rochdale Grammar School, King's College London and Harvard University. Pilling served as the Director-General of the Prison Service from 1991 to 1993, and then Director of Resources and Services in the Department of Health, before being appointed as Permanent Secretary of the Northern Ireland Office in 1997, where he served until 2005 when he retired. But not for too long: in 2009 he accepted appointment by the Home Secretary as the UK's first and only Identity Commissioner, a role having independent oversight of the National Identity Service government database (previously known as National Identity Scheme) and its controversial mission of recording, cataloguing and processing the personal details of everyone in the UK. He took office on 1 October 2009. In 2012 and 2013, Pilling chaired the House of Bishops of the Church of England Working Group on Human Sexuality. The group was commissioned by the House of Bishops in January 2012. It was composed of four bishops and was chaired by Pilling. In November 2013, the group submitted its report to the archbishops of Canterbury and York who published it. The archbishops recognised Pilling's comment that \"disagreements have been explored in the warmth of a shared faith\". He is married to Ann, Lady Pilling, an author, and was appointed Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath (KCB) in the 2001 Birthday Honours, having previously been a Companion of the Order of the Bath (CB). He is a member of the Athenaeum Club."

  "text" : "John Dakyn DCL (1497 – November 9, 1558) was an English cleric and historian. He was archdeacon of the East Riding of Yorkshire and a noted chronicler of the Pilgrimage of Grace. In his early life Dakyn was chancellor to the Bishop of Bath and Wells, William Knight, and in his will Knight appointed Dakyn his executor. Much of the money that established the Dakyn Trust in the parish of Kirkby Ravensworth was left by Knight. Dakyn was also vicar general to Knight whilst Knight was the absentee holder of the archdeaconry of Richmond. Dakyn played a leading part in the Pilgrimage of Grace. He rose to vicar general of the diocese of York and archdeacon of the East Riding of Yorkshire in 1551. In 1554 he was appointed rector of Kirkby Ravensworth. In 1556 he established a school and an almshouse for the people of the parish of Kirkby Ravensworth where he had been rector. Initially the endowment of the school and almshouse was in lands, situated principally in the parish of East Coulton. The school and the almshouse have since been closed down, but the John Dakyn Trust continues to benefit local young people and the elderly. Dakyn was responsible for the North of England's first, and possibly only, burning for heresy in the last three years of Mary's reign. According to John Foxe: \"Immediately after D. Dakins geuing sentence that þe other should be burnt, came home to hys house and neuer ioyed after, but dyed.\""

  "text" : "Jean-Claude Roger Mbede was a Cameroonian man who was sentenced to three years' imprisonment on charges of homosexuality and attempted homosexuality. His sentence was protested by international human rights organizations including Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International, the latter of which named him a prisoner of conscience. On 2 March 2011, agents of Cameroon's Secretary of State for Defense (SED) security service arrested Mbede after he sent SMS messages arranging to meet a male acquaintance. According to the UK newspaper The Guardian, the SED \"regularly target and prosecute gay men\" under penal code Section 347a: \"Whoever has sexual relations with a person of the same sex shall be punished with imprisonment from six months to five years and with a fine ranging from 20,000 Francs CFA to 200,000 Francs CFA.\" Mbede was detained for one week on \"suspicion of homosexuality\" in Yaoundé before being formally charged with \"homosexuality and attempted homosexuality\" on 9 March. Mbede was represented by Alice Nkom, a noted LGBT rights attorney and head of Cameroon's Association to Defend Homosexuals. On 28 April 2011, he was found guilty on both charges and sentenced to three years' imprisonment in Kondengui Central Prison. His sentence was protested by Human Rights Watch, who described it as \"a gross violation of Mbede's rights to freedom of expression and equality\" and called on Cameroon's government to abolish the relevant law. Amnesty International also issued an alert on Mbede's behalf, with a spokesperson stating: \"Locking someone up for their real or perceived sexual orientation is a flagrant breach of basic rights and should not be allowed under any country's penal code\". Amnesty International's Africa Director Erwin var der Borght stated, \"Jean-Claude Mbede is a prisoner of conscience held solely because of his perceived sexual orientation. All charges against him should be dropped and he should be released immediately.\" Several local branches of Amnesty International are collecting signatures demanding his release. In November 2011, Nkom stated that Mbede had suffered malnutrition and sexual assault while in prison. His appeal was scheduled for a hearing on 5 March 2012, but was delayed. He was provisionally released on 16 July 2012. 34 years old Mbede died on 10 January 2014 in his hometown Ngoumou after he left a hospital because he lacked money for continued medical care."

The family later moved to Liverpool, where James Roland MacLaren first took to the stage, appearing second to Barry Sullivan, the well known Victorian actor. He subsequently went to Sunderland with Alfred Davis where he took over the New Royal Lyceum Theatre (now demolished). It was here with MacLaren that the actor Sir Henry Irving made his first stage appearances before moving to London where he later became famous as the inspiration for Bram Stoker's Count Dracula. For some thirty years MacLaren was renowned in the north east of England as an actor in stock companies, a noted recitalist and a playwright. He usually played heavy villain roles and was popular amongst the audience as the 'traitor'. His most noted work is arguably the play Jack Crawford the Hero of Camperdown, a dramatisation of the story depicting the heroic actions of Jack Crawford during the Battle of Camperdown in 1797. He also wrote the play, The Cauld Lad O'Hylton, a story of the ghost of Hilton Castle."

He later worked as a counter of cargoes of slate as they were loaded on to ships in Bangor, in modern Gwynedd. Unusually for someone of his background, he was not only a musician and a poet but proficient in several languages.

He was a pioneer in bacteriology and studied the etiology of infectious diseases and oncology. In 1887, Hlava authored a widely cited article entitled About Dysentery. Due to a translation error, the article was attributed to O. Uplavici in English publications until 1938. The name of author was written in small characters, and the translator mistook O ÚPLAVICI (About dysentery in Czech) for the name of the author and PŘEDBĚŽNÁ ZPRÁVA (preliminary report) for About Dysentery. The mistake was corrected in 1939 by American physician Clifford Dobell, writing about the history of this mistake in the article \"Dr. O. Uplavici (1887–1938)\"."

Appointed as assistant priest to La Chapelle-sur-Loire in 1885, he served for two years before becoming a student of Thomas Joseph Lamy (1827–1907) at Louvain Catholic University in Belgium. His thesis published in Latin in 1892 was devoted to Isaac of Nineveh and included three unpublished homilies from British Museum manuscripts which Chabot translated. Returning to Paris Chabot studied under Rubens Duval whose collaborator he became. In 1893 Chabot published catalogues of Syriac manuscripts preserved at the Greek Orthodox Patriarchate of Jerusalem and of Syriac manuscripts acquired by the French Bibliothèque Nationale since 1874 (i.e. subsequent to the Zotenberg catalogue).Other catalogues of Oriental manuscripts in the possession of the Eastern Churches were to follow. An early student of the École pratique des hautes études (founded partly to fill the gap caused by the suppression of the Sorbonne Theology faculty) Chabot worked on the fourth part of the Chronicle of Pseudo-Dionysius of Tell-Mahre, which he published in 1895. Four years later he obtained a copy of the original Syriac version of Michael the Syrian's Universal Chronicle, which had been rediscovered in a church at Edessa in 1887 by Ephrem Rahmani, subsequently patriarch of the Syriac Catholic Church. This led to the publication of four volumes of text with Latin translation in 1899, 1901, 1905, 1910 with a follow-up consisting of introduction, corrections and indices in 1924. In 1903 Chabot founded the Corpus Scriptorum Christianorum Orientalium, which he directed single-handed for ten years, supervising the publication of 70 original texts in the four languages initially planned, i.e.; Syriac, Coptic, Arabic and Ethiopian, and personally editing a series of further Syriac chronicles (including the invaluable Doocumenta ad Illustrandas Monophysitarum Origines 1908) together with the first part of the surviving Syriac version of Cyril of Alexandria's Commentary on St. Luke's Gospel 1912 and (with A. Vaschalde) James of Edessa's Hexaemeron 1928. Chabot remained Secretary general of the C.S.C.O., though responsibility passed in 1913 to the Universities of Washington and Louvain, throughout his lifetime. In 1917 Chabot was elected a member of the French Académie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres. In 1922 he published Choix d' inscriptions de Palmyre, a major work on Palmyrene Aramaic texts, and in 1935 a general introduction, Littérature Syriaque. He died in Paris, aged 87."

  "text" : "Joe Bodolai (May 11, 1948 – December 26, 2011) was an American film and television producer and writer. Born and raised in the United States, Bodolai was opposed to the Vietnam War and moved to Canada in order to avoid being drafted. He moved back to the United States in 1981 to write for twenty episodes of Saturday Night Live before returning to Canada. He is best known for producing such television shows as It's Only Rock & Roll, Comics!, and The Kids in the Hall and helping to launch the careers of the young talent featured on those shows. He also co-wrote the first draft of the film Wayne's World with Mike Myers. Bodolai was a founder of The Comedy Network, helping the new channel secure its licence from the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission in 1996, and expected to be named the new channel's head by its owners. He was disappointed when he was not hired and decided to return permanently to the United States. Bodolai was found dead on December 26, 2011 in a Hollywood hotel room of an apparent suicide; he was 63. No suicide note was found, though on December 23 a long post was added to his blog, entitled \"If this were your last day alive what would you do?\""

Before his career with the¯American government, Corona earned degrees in accounting and advertising and studied art in Mexico City and New York City. He then worked for the Foreign Service at the Mexican Consulate in Montreal, Canada for several years. After his career as the cultural attaché in Mexico City, Corona retired from the American Embassy and moved with his family to Austin, Texas where he and his wife Amelia Corona opened a Mexican food restaurant, which aimed to bring authentic Mexican interior food dishes and cuisine from all the regions of Mexico. Corona incorporated his wife’s recipes into the restaurant’s menu. At the time, the majority of the local Mexican restaurants were offering Tex-Mex food. His restaurant (Las Palomas) opened its doors in 1983. Javier G. Corona was a prolific artist as well, and had several exhibitions of his work both in Mexico and in the U.S. Some of his paintings can be seen at his restaurant. After his death, the Texas Senate and the Texas House of Representatives passed a proclamation and a resolution (S.P. No.116 & H.R No.110 respectively) to honor Mr. Corona’s memory."

  "text" : "Princess Louise Juliane of East Frisia (16 November 1657 in Aurich – 30 October 1715 in Hamburg) was the eldest daughter of Prince Enno Louis of East Frisia and his second wife Justine Sophie of Barby. After her father's death in 1660, she lived with her mother and her sister Sophia Wilhelmina at Berum Castle near Aurich. There were persistent inheritance disputes with their uncle George Christian and, after his death, with his widow, Christine Charlotte of Württemberg, who ruled East Frisia as regent for her underage son. The dispute was settled with a compromise in 1695. According to tradition, Louise Juliane received a sum of 59000thaler, which was paid two years later. After Juliana Louise's mother died in 1677, she was penniless and moved in with her guardian Rudolph Augustus in Wolfenbüttel. After Rudolph Augustus died in 1686, she moved in with her relative John Adolphus in Plön. When she had received the 59000thaler in 1697, she became financially independent. In 1698, she moved to Hamburg, where she lived in a house at the Jungfernstieg. She also owned a country house at Ottensen. In 1700, she married the Reverend Joachim Morgenweck, a preacher at the orphanage of the Church of Mary Magdalene. The marriage took place secretly, because a relationship between a noblewoman and a pastor was generally regarded as scandalous in 1700. They lived apart and did not cause a stir. Juliana Louise died in October 1715 probably of the plague (disease). She bequeathed a sum of 3000 marks to Mary Magdalene Church, which should be used for the maintenance of her grave. She bequeathed to Morgenweck the right to live in the house at Ottensen for the rest of his life. A cousin challenged the will, holding up the payment of the 3000 marks. The graveyard did not release the grave until it had been paid for. Her tombstone stood for 18 months in the hallway of the apartment on Jungfernstieg, until she could finally be buried in March 1717. The Church of Mary Magdalene was demolished in 1807. Juliana Louise's tomb was moved to one the cemeteries outside Dammtor and she was reburied there. When this cemetery was closed, she was reburied at the Ohlsdorf Cemetery and her tomb was again moved. It is one of the oldest tombstones on the new cemetery. It was renovated in 2010. Originally, her grave had an inscription This grave is not to be opened as long as the wind blows and the cokc crows. Today, the inscription reads This grave is never to be opened."

  "text" : "John Lawrence McKenzie (October 9, 1910 – March 2, 1991) was born on October 9, 1910, in Brazil, Indiana, the first of the six children of Myra (Daly) and Harry McKenzie. John McKenzie became the premier Catholic Biblical scholar of the mid-twentieth century; indeed, John Courtney Murray, SJ, wrote that John McKenzie was “the best Catholic theologian he knew of in the United States.” John McKenzie was interested in the Jesuits from an early age. At some significant sacrifice to his family, he was enrolled in a Jesuit boarding high school in St. Mary’s, Kansas, where he came first in his class three out of his four years there. After graduating in 1928, he entered the Chicago Province of the Society of Jesus and was ordained a priest in 1939. He was supposed to study theology in Rome, but the onset of World War II made that impossible. Consequently, he and others were required to study instead at the Weston School of Theology in Massachusetts (now the Boston College School of Theology and Ministry). He received his Doctorate in Sacred Theology from Weston. John McKenzie taught for nineteen years at the Jesuit Theologate in West Baden, Indiana, before transferring to Loyola University Chicago. He left Loyola to become the first CatholicFaculty member at the University of Chicago Divinity School. Following this, he taught at the University of Notre Dame, at Seton Hall University, and at DePaul University. He was self-taught in ten languages. His scholarly and popular writings were voluminous. He was much sought after as a lecturer as well. In the English-speaking world, his 900,000-word Dictionary of the Bible remains the most frequently used single-volume biblical dictionary available. At the time of its publication in 1956, a review in the periodical, The Thomist, called his book, The Two-Edged Sword, “the most significant Catholic interpretation of the Old Testament ever written in English.” It remains in print to this day and continues to be considered, by scholars and non-scholars alike, a masterful reflection on the Old Testament. The New York Times obituary announcing his death said, “Rev. John L. McKenzie was a pioneering and outspoken Roman Catholic biblical scholar, (who) through scholarly and popular writings, helped bring about the general acceptance by Catholic scholars and Church authorities of the scientific techniques of investigating Scripture, which had been highly suspect in Catholic circles when he began his career.” In 1965 and 1966 alone, besides the above-noted Dictionary of the Bible, he published The Power and the Wisdom, an interpretation of the New Testament; Authority in the Church, a book arguing that service—diakonia—rather than secular models of government—domination—should define the Church's understanding and use of authority; a seminal essay on natural law in the New Testament, as well as eleven other articles and nineteen book reviews of scholarly works. He is the author of a number of articles in the Encyclopedia Britannica (14th edition): Adam and Eve, Hexateuch, Israel, Mizpah, Pentateuch, Zephania, and Zion. From approximately 1954 to 1974 he was considered the dean of Catholic Biblical scholars. During this period, he was elected President of the Catholic Biblical Association and became the first Catholic ever elected President of the Society of Biblical Literature. It should also be noted that during this period he was also President of probably the largest Anti-Vietnam War organization, Clergy and Laity Concerned, whose founding members also included the Reverend Martin Luther King, Jr., Rabbi Abraham Heschel, and Reverend William Sloane Coffin. This involvement was the direct result of his being an outspoken and supremely articulate Christian pacifist. In 1971, he transferred as a priest from the Society of Jesus to the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Milwaukee, Wisconsin. John L. McKenzie’s correspondence was as extensive as his scholarly writings. Although it may be something of an exaggeration, it was said that he never left unanswered a letter written to him, whether complimentary or critical. The exaggeration is probably rooted in two facts: He did give yeoman’s service in trying to respond to those who wrote to him, and he firmly believed that the academic owed a debt—-in justice and in love—-a debt that required the scholar to share the fruits of his or her work with the everyday person whose work afforded the scholar the leisure, as well as the food, electricity, books, etc. needed to pursue a cognitive discipline in depth. He once wrote: ”I think my colleagues in theology and exegesis are open to the charge that they have become mandarins, who speak only to other mandarins about topics which are of interest only to mandarins in a style of discourse which is gibberish to any except mandarins, and one sometimes wonders about them too. Scholarship is and ought to be a form of public service and not an expensive enterprise dedicated to the production of a few more mandarins who can spend a leisurely life in the production of other mandarins”. The pointedness of this statement and the self-discipline with which John L. McKenzie responded to those who corresponded with him, as well as his commitment to write not only scholarly theological books and essays, but also to publish the results of his intellectual labors in popular, non-academic prose, all arose directly from an empathic mission that lay deep within him as a human being, a Christian, and a scholar. The mission: to spread the truth of the Good News of Jesus Christ to help free people intellectually, morally, spiritually, and socially to search for truth and to adhere to it once found. For, as he saw it, the task of Christianity, of scholarship, of humanity in general, and of the individual human being is de-conditioning—freeing one’s mind and oneself, and freeing others, from nurtured untruth in which a personal investment has been made. His was a life of compassion, sharing with others the bread of truth which he had purchased at great price; sharing, because he had taken to heart so deeply the idea that as human beings we are made with the desire to know, that the object of that desire is truth, and that the truth shall set us free to be what we should be. Testimonials to the exceptional quality of Rev. John L. McKenzie’s intellect and the superlative character of his scholarship abound. But one in particular deserves to be singled out perhaps, because of who gave it and the place she hold in the history of twentieth-century Catholicism, indeed, the place she holds in twentieth-century Christianity and humanity—Dorothy Day. On the morning of April 14, 1968, she writes in her diary: “Up at 5:00 and reading The Power and The Wisdom. I thank God for sending me men with such insight as Fr. McKenzie.” John L. McKenzie concluded his human, priestly, and scholarly life on earth in Claremont, California, assisting as a priest at Our Lady of Assumption Parish, and serving as counselor and friend to scholars and non-scholars—from every point on the compass—who thought that hecould be of help to them. He was born to Eternal Life on March 2, 1991."

  "text" : "Juan Clemente Zenea was a Cuban writer born in Bayamo, Granma, on February 24, 1832. He is recognised as having been a great influence on Cuban literature for reintroducing Romanticism, marking a new age in Hispano-American poetry. In 1845 he enrolled in José de la Luz y Caballero's college, where his inclinations towards literature first appeared. In 1846 he published his first poems in \"La Prensa\", a newspaper based in Havana for which he became a writer in 1849. From this point on the number of his works grew considerably. For example, he published “La mujer ¿Es un ángel? ¡No es un ángel! ¿Si será o no será?” in collaboration with José Fornaris and Rafael Otero. He wrote \"Almendares\" together with Idelfonso Estrada Zenea and collaborated on \"La voz del pueblo\". In 1852 he had to emigrate to New Orleans, USA. While there he collaborated on \"El correo de Louisiana\", \"El Independiente\" and \"Faro de Cuba\", carrying out a strong campaign against the Spanish government. Later he moved to New York, where he worked for \"El Filibustero\", \"La Verdad\" and \"El Cubano\". He was condemned to death in Havana in 1853 because of his activities against the Spanish government, but was pardoned due to the general amnesty and was able to return to Cuba the following year. From then on he worked in José de la Luz y Caballero's college as an English teacher. In general he has produced a wide range of works and has received various awards. Some of his poems are included in \"El laúd del desterrado\" and an uncountable number of his articles appeared in contemporary Cuban and Spanish publications, such as \"La Chamarreta\", \"El Siglo\", \"Revista del pueblo de Cuba\", \"Ofrenda al Bazar\", \"Álbum cubano de lo bueno y lo bello\", \"La Piragua\", \"Brisas de Cuba\", \"Floresta Cubana\" and \"Guirnalda Cubana\", as well as the Spanish magazines \"La América\" and \"La Ilustración Republicana Federal\". He founded and directed the \"Revista Habanera\". In 1865 he returned to New York to collaborate on the \"Revista del Nuevo Mundo\". He then moved to Mexico to work on the publication \"Diario Oficial\". At the beginning of the 1868 war in Cuba he returned to the United States to support the cause, but every expedition in which he took part ended in failure. He managed to reach Cuba secretly in 1870, and after a meeting with Carlos Manuel de Céspedes, leader of the rebellion, he was imprisoned by Spanish troops while trying to return to the United States and shot to death in 1871."

Mirande exerted a great literary influence in the 1970s and 1980s, writing in Basque literary and cultural magazines as well as Breton ones. His contribution was an obvious thematic renewal. He wrote poetry and short stories in his youth, and essays and novels in his later years. Mirande is a nationalist and believes in the value of ethnicity, especially in the Basque language, but he is also pagan and lays claim to the values of paganism and of the ancient Basques. Mirande managed to incorporate Basque poetry into the modern European poetry landscape through an aestheticism of symbolist characteristics indebted to Charles Baudelaire and Edgar Allan Poe. In his poetic works, Mirande covered topics never before dealt with by Basque poetry: prostitution, alcohol, pedophilic sex and so on."

He was consecrated as a bishop by Stephan Weinberger, auxiliary bishop of Würzburg on January 6, 1675. During his time as Prince-Bishop, the Franco-Dutch War spilled into the Prince-Bishopric of Würzburg, with forces under Henri de la Tour d'Auvergne, Vicomte de Turenne invading the bishopric. These forces were eventually beaten back by troops under the command of Raimondo Montecuccoli. He died on April 19, 1675."

  "text" : "John Raithby (1766–1826), lawyer, born in 1766, was eldest son of Edmund Raithby of Edenham, Lincolnshire. On 26 January 1795 he was admitted a member of Lincoln's Inn, and was subsequently called to the bar. He practised in the Court of Chancery. His legal writings obtained for him a commissionership of bankruptcy; he was also nominated a sub-commissioner on the public records. Raithby died at the Grove, Highgate, on 31 August 1826, leaving a widow. Raithby published anonymously, in 1798, ‘The Study and Practice of the Law considered,’ 8vo, an ably written treatise, for some time attributed to Sir James Mackintosh. An American edition appeared at Portland, Maine, in 1806, and the second English edition was issued at London in 1816, with the author's name. With Sir Thomas Edlyne Tomlins, Raithby issued a new edition of the ‘Statutes at Large,’ from Magna Charta to the Union, 41 Geo. III, 10 vols. 4to, 1811 (also in 20 vols. 8vo, 1811). Tomlins co-operated in the edition down to 49 Geo. III, when he relinquished the task to Raithby and Nicholas Simons. Raithby compiled a useful ‘Index’ to the work, ‘from Magna Charta to 49 Geo. III,’ which appeared in 1814, in 1 vol. 4to and in 3 vols. 8vo. He likewise compiled alphabetical and chronological indexes to the ‘Statutes of the Realm,’ which were published by the record commissioners in 1824 and 1828, folio. Raithby wrote also: 1. ‘The Law and Principle of Money considered,’ 8vo, London, 1811. 2. ‘Henry Bennet: a Novel,’ 3 vols. 12mo, London."

  "text" : "John Bowman Chapple (November 20, 1899 – April 16, 1989) was a political candidate in Wisconsin. In 1932, Chapple defeated incumbent John J. Blaine in the Republican primary for the United States Senate. His campaign included the claim that the University of Wisconsin was rife with atheism, communism, and immorality. Chapple lost in the general election to F. Ryan Duffy. He ran for the Senate twice more. In 1934, he finished third behind incumbent Robert M. La Follette, Jr. and John M. Callahan. Chapple ran as a \"Townsend Republican\" in 1938 but lost to Republican Alexander Wiley in the general election. In 1936, Chapple was a candidate for the Republican primary for Governor of Wisconsin. He lost to Julius P. Heil, who went on to defeat incumbent Philip La Follette in the general election. Chapple's name was put into play for the Republican nominee for President of the United States in 1956, but ultimately, incumbent Dwight D. Eisenhower retained the nomination and won re-election. In 1960, Chapple was a write-in candidate for the United States House of Representatives from Wisconsin's 10th congressional district, garnering 4.7% of the vote. He lost to Republican incumbent Alvin E. O'Konski."

  "text" : "Joe Bowker was an English boxer who was Bantamweight champion of the world in 1904 and 1905. His defeat of Frankie Neil on 17 October in London for the world bantamweight title was considered the most remarkable event in the sport in 1904. Bowker captured four boxing titles in the first decade of the 20th century: world bantamweight championship, European bantamweight championship, British bantamweight championship, and British featherweight championship. He held the world bantamweight and British featherweight titles at the same time. In 51 professional fights, he compiled a career record of 40 wins, 8 losses and one draw with two no-decisions. Fourteen wins came by knockout. He was known as a \"wonderfully clever\" fighter. More than 40 years after Bowker retired from the ring, British boxing historian Maurice Golesworthy wrote of him: \"Indeed, there are many authorities who rate Joe Bowker as the most skillful boxer ever produced in this country. That may be an exaggeration, but it is safe to say that there have been few better.\""

Asher wrote and produced his first television film for the American Broadcasting Company, Peace on Borrowed Time, when he was 21 years old, during 1982; it aired the following year. The 1985 HBO documentary Soldiers in Hiding, of which Asher was a producer and writer, was nominated for an Academy Award. As a partner in the San Francisco-based studio (Colossal) Pictures during the late 1980s and 1990s he was the creator of the MTV animated showcase Liquid Television and a key figure in its execution, serving as executive producer and creative director. He was also an executive producer and writer for Æon Flux, a segment of the programme which later became its own show. Between 1995 and 1997 he was the executive vice-president of programming at Tele-TV, an ultimately abortive joint venture by three American telephone companies to provide interactive television, video on demand and internet through customers' phone lines."

  "text" : "Reginald George James Berry OBE (20 June 1906 – 6 November 1979) was a New Zealand artist, noted for creating a large number of postage stamp and coin designs. He was born in London in 1906, and emigrated to New Zealand in 1925. He went on to become a commercial artist at a Wellington advertising agency, and in 1932 became a freelance artist. His work included book covers and illustrations, but is most famous for more than 1,000 stamp, coin and medal designs. Berry's first successful stamp design was for New Zealand's 1933 health stamp. For the next 20 years he designed a vast majority of the stamps issued by New Zealand. Increasing numbers of stamp issues meant that more artists were subsequently employed, but Berry continued designing stamps into the 1970s. Berry also designed stamps for Western Samoa, the Cook Islands, Niue, Tonga, and Bermuda. After a lengthy process, Berry was the artist for the final designs selected for New Zealand's decimal coins, introduced in 1967 in denominations of 1, 2, 5, 10, 20 and 50 cents. The 1, 2 and 5-cent coins have been withdrawn from circulation, and the 20-cent redesigned. Berry's 10-cent and 50-cent designs remain in use today, although current coins are smaller than the originals. Berry died on 6 November 1979 in Auckland."

  "text" : "Jacques Bretel or Jacques Bretex (dates of birth and death unknown) was a French language trouvère, best known for having written Le Tournoi de Chauvency. His only known work, signed and dated, le Tournoi de Chauvency, is a long poem of about 4,500 verses recounting the events of a tournament held during six days of feasting given by Louis V, Count of Chiny in October 1285 at Chauvency-le-Château. It is without doubt a masterpiece of French Middle Ages literature and, in any case, one of the best digests of courtly art of the period. His origin is unknown, but his Tournoi de Chauvency, signed and dated in 1285, is written in Old French combined with words in the westernl Lorraine dialect. Le Tournoi de Chauvency is kept in a manuscript (reference: Douce 308) at the Bodleian Library at the University of Oxford."

After his university studies in natural science at the University of Rennes, where he was the friend and partner of Yves Coppens, Jacques Briard entered the National Center of Scientific Research in 1955 as an archaeologist, where he eventually became research director. The numerous excavations in which he participated in and directed, and he directed, in Brittany and elsewhere, made him one of the great Bronze Age specialists in Europe, known for several scientific publications but also for his public outreach. Attached to the Breton culture, he notably collaborated with the publications of Ar Falz and Skol Vreizh (The Sickle/Breton School). In particular, he is credited for the discovery of the princely tomb of tumulus de Kernonen (Plouvorn, Finistère), which contained exceptional wealth. He was decorated with the Ordre de l'Hermine in 1995."

  "text" : "Julien Reverchon (1837–1905) was a French botanist, born August 3, 1837 in Diémoz and died on December 30, 1905. He was the son of Maximilian and Florine Jacques Reverchon. His father was a follower of the ideas of Charles Fourier (1772–1837), and he decided to join Victor Prosper Considerant (1808–1893) in La Réunion, near Dallas, Texas. Julien, who displayed an interest in the natural world at a young age, had already amassed a collection of nearly 2,000 species of plants with his brother. The family arrived at La Réunion in December 1856 and learned of the failure of the Fourier colony. Jacques Reverchon then bought a small farm in the vicinity. Julien began to study the local flora. He married Marie Henri July 24, 1864; they had two sons who died of typhoid fever in 1884. After abandoning botany for a few years, he started collecting plants in 1869, when he made an expedition to collect fossils with Jacob Boll (1828-1880) in West Texas. With subsequent collections, he contributed to the production of noted floras by Asa Gray (1810–1888) and Charles Sprague Sargent (1841–1927) and the enrichment of many American collections. He taught botany at the end of his life in Dallas. At the time of his death, more than 2,600 species were cultured in his farm, and he possessed a rich herbarium of 20,000 specimens. Today, it is kept at the Missouri Botanical Garden in St. Louis . The city of Dallas named Reverchon Park in his honor."

In 1840 he published his Ornithologie du Gard et des pays circonvoisins (Ornithology of Gard and Environs), a book that covered 321 species of birds. The book earned the praise of naturalists that included Isidore Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire (1805-1861). In 1844 Crespon published the two-volume La Faune méridionale (Mediterranean Wildlife), in which he described 27 new species. Crespon's natural history collections passed to the Muséum d'histoire naturelle in Nîmes on his death."

During the same year, he was appointed chief pharmacist of the French army. From 1758, he served as apothecary to the army headquarters of Bas-Rhin, during which time he studied plants found in the vicinity of Cologne and Braunschweig. In 1770 he was appointed professor of botany by the magistrate of Lille, and from 1796 served as a professor of natural history at the École centrale du département du Nord à Lille. With Pierre Riquet, he was editor of Pharmacopoeia, jussu Senatus insulensis tertiary edita.

  "text" : "John Prophet (1356 –1416) was an English medieval Secretary to King Henry IV, Keeper of the Privy Seal and, Dean of Hereford and York. A distinguished and capable administrator he remained loyal to all kings through a mix of shrewdness, and cunning. Although guilty of simony and pluralism, Prophet was no lollard, but successfully made the transition from Richard II's extravangant court at Westminster to an indispensable servant of the Lancastrians. Prophet was university educated and entered Holy Orders. Ordained a priest he served from 1380 onwards as a clerk in the Privy Seal office and clerk of the council under Richard II. Prophet was appointed Chaplain to Archbishop of Canterbury, William Courtenay in 1382, during which time he was made a prebendary of Wingham church. He was then converted into the diocese at Lincoln, where he became a prebendary of the cathedral in 1384. A habit he continued as he was strictly guilty of pluralism. Among the curios of anomalous gifts was St Tyriocs chapelry in another diocese on Beachley Point. Nonetheless Prophet was a talented administrator and continued to rise; clever servants of the Crown were hard to find, and so were commonly rewarded thus. In 1389 Prophet was promoted a clerk of the royal household. The energetic pursuit of agenda and minute-taking was his hallmark, introducing this system into a Register of proceedings; the Register, the first of its kind in England, ran until November 1393 on his collation to Dean of Hereford, but was thence discontinued. By 1390 Prophet was already well-acquainted with Ledbury where he was presented with a portion of All Saints Parish Church appertaining to Upper Hall in Ledbury Park. He was also preferred as Rector of Orpington in Kent by 1392, and the following year elevated to the Deanery at the time that Richard was on expedition to quell a rebellion in Ireland. Hereford was a lawless city on the Marches, where dean Prophet was responsible for the Coningsby Hospital. The Bishop Trefnant probably knew Prophet because he had already served with him on the royal council. Master John Prophet was assaulted in its precincts by William Buryton as part of an ongoing feud between the Bishop and Dean and Chapter that spilled over into street violence. There was an inquiry, and later visitation by the Privy Council (which Prophet later chaired as Secretary) to investigate the possible defrocking of the Bishop. Bishop Trefnant's instructions included a visitation to St Katherine's Hospital and Ledbury parish in 1397, which had not been administered since the days of Bishop Foliot. Conditions were poor, and the master William Pykersley was dismissed, to be replaced by an experienced administrator, John Malvern. A new jury was selected and sealed as ordinances on 2 November, submitted to the bishop at his palace of Whitbourne Hall for the confirmation on 16 December 1398. Prophet was determined to provide proper care for the poor, infirm and cure of the souls. Prophet laid down minimum standards by the Ordinances (1398) of food by weight, diet to guarantee wellbeing. Also at St Katherine's a board of discipline was established for the chaplains to ensure pay and conditions for 'life's necessities'. As well as a stipend they were to wear a uniform with a white cross. The chaplains were chosen mainly from local men who retained a vested interest, yet could not now be removed by the Master, but only on order of the Dean and Chapter. But masters of St Katherine's in late 14th and early 15th centuries had a national profile, and Prophet intended a new Mansion House: an H-Plan layout was sustained for the next 400 years providing, buttery, pantry, solar, and central hall with extensive accommodation. Prophet's essay on administrative reform was an unusual and unique legal instrument. Prophet's ambitious plan with fellow portionist of Lower Hall estate Robert Prees, was in April 1401 to build a newly founded college with eight chantry priests to celebrate mass in union with the premiere parish church in the land, was even for Bishop Trefnant too risky. Prophet accepted the weighty responsibility of royal and episcopal patronage in perpetuity could not be allowed to lead to unjust enrichment. The reduction of the size of the project to just a small chapel for St Katherine's underscored Prophet's shrewd capabilities. Prophet also received the rents of 70 acres at Little Marcle and 27 acres of coppice woodland at Dunbridge, while the tithe at the Hazle that came to the Master by rents allocated to his personal use during this period. In 1414 he proposed a chantry chapel for Hereford Cathedral to be built by Henry V's royal stonemason 'Thomas the mason and other stone cutters, fellows and servants of his...' for he had great 'affection' for the church. Despite his rise in the Ricardian church, he continued to enjoy royal patronage under the Lancastrians. The new King Henry IV recalled him to the royal council in 1400, with a retainer salary of £100. He was made a prebendary of the York Minster (1404), and the King had promoted Prophet to secretary from 1402 to 1406. In late 1402 Prophet was sent with Lord Say as the King's representatives to inform Parliament that they could not expect to be called as a matter of right, nor without Henry's consent. But in November 1403 a papal release licence came from the Pope to allow Prophet to relinquish his deanery duties in Hereford. By 1404 Prophet held several prebendaries at Lincoln, Salisbury, York, and St Asaph's cathedrals, as well as Abergwili, Tamworth, and Crediton. Yet another prebendary, followed this time at Leighton Buzzard in the diocese of Lincoln in 1405. Nevertheless, he had to resign his portion of Upper Hall Ledbury when in 1407 he was collated Dean of York (until his death in 1416). He never fulfilled the ambition of building a chantry chapel there, but converted the old Dean's residence at Pocklington into a Tythe Barn and farmyard Ad fut rei mem eaque pro commodo, whilst simultaneously in December 1409 refurbished a house at Thornton for his own dwelling. \"John Prophete of Pocklington\" as he was known in the charters, was unusual not being an absentee. The Bishop's Peculiar Court had always been at Pocklington manor, when judging matters ecclesiastical in the 14th century, including blasphemy and breaches of the sabbath. From 1406 he was the Keeper of the Privy Seal, retaining the confidence of Prince Hal when his father fell ill from 1411. One his last meetings as Secretary was early in February 1415 when the Council met at the Blackfriars house in London. They discussed the certainty of war and the failure of negotiations to come. They would safeguard the seas and borders during the King's absence, and would repair the King's castle at Berwick. The Council wanted a full report into the state of the King's finances and expenditures since his coronation, only then could he make his voyage to France. Prophet attended Henry V's disciplined court at Westminster with other officers of the royal household, particularly at key feast days in the Christian calendar, like Christmas. On 21 February 1415, the King's Council met to discuss the grave state of the nation's safety abroad: ambassadors had returned from Paris having failed to find a peace settlement with Charles VI, and there would be war. The Council's advice had not altered since October 1414. But on Monday 3 June 1415, the last of Henry IV's courtiers was removed from office, and the sixty-year-old stepped aside. Yet when the fleet invaded in August, the complete victory was within the administration's grasp. Elusive for 200 years – it was achieved through naval control of the Channel, and a strong chain of military command and control. One of Prophet's last duties was to travel north for Henry V in 1416 to report on conditions in St Leonard's Hospital, a royal hospital outside Walmgate Bar, York. On his death in 1416 he was buried in the parish church at Ringwood, Hampshire, in a church of which he had been rector. In 1410 he had built a chantry chapel there with Sir John Berkeley; a monumental brass marked his grave. His will was proven in 1418, where his executors included his nephew Master Thomas Felde, and Richard Rede, chaplain from Ringwood."

  "text" : "Joseph Oakland Hirschfelder (May 27, 1911 – March 30, 1990) was an American physicist who participated in the Manhattan Project and in the creation of the nuclear bomb. Robert Oppenheimer assembled a team at the Los Alamos Laboratory to work on plutonium gun design Thin Man, that included senior engineer Edwin McMillan and senior physicists Charles Critchfield and Joseph Hirschfelder. Hirschfelder had been working on internal ballistics. Oppenheimer led the design effort himself until June 1943, when Navy Captain William Sterling Parsons arrived took over the Ordnance and Engineering Division and direct management of the \"Thin Man\" project.Hirschfelder was a member of the National Academy of Sciences, a group leader in theoretical physics and ordnance at the Los Alamos Atomic Bomb Laboratory, chief phenomenologist at the nuclear bomb tests at Bikini, the founder of the Theoretical Chemistry Institute and the Homer Adkins professor emeritus of chemistry at the University of Wisconsin.Hirschfelder was also a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. He was awarded the National Medal of Science from President Gerald Ford “for his fundamental contributions to atomic and molecular quantum mechanics, the theory of the rates of chemical reactions, and the structure and properties of gases and liquids.” The National Academies Press called him \"one of the leading figures in theoretical chemistry during the period 1935-90\".\" In 1991 an award was established in his name by the University of Wisconsin's Theoretical Chemistry Institute - the annual Joseph O. Hirschfelder Prize in Theoretical Chemistry. He was an elected member of the International Academy of Quantum Molecular Science"

Lewis was also an Anthem Fellow for Objectivist Scholarship. Lewis received his PhD in classical studies at Cambridge University in 2001, with the dissertation, Solon’s Polis as Kosmos: Intellectual, Moral and Political Integration in Archaic Athens. He taught at the University of London from 2000-2001. From 2001 to 2008, he was a professor in the History and Political Science Department at Ashland University, where contention surrounding his promotion to tenured professor drew national attention. Lewis was a member of the American Political Science Association, the Association of Ancient Historians, the Society for Military History, the American Philological Association, and the Cambridge Philological Society. Lewis published three books, was a contributing editor to The Objective Standard and contributed to Capitalism Magazine and contributed to multiple publications including Journal of Business Ethics, Social Philosophy and Policy, Polis, Dike, and Bryn Mawr Classical Review. Lewis frequently spoke at Objectivist conferences and Tea Party events. He also spoke on the morality of free markets in medicine, arguing that innovators ought to be freed from unnecessary regulation. Lewis died on January 3, 2012 after a long battle with cancer. He was 56."

Set in a Yorkshire pit village around the turn of the 20th century, and based in part on Sanderson's own family history, it has been widely acclaimed and is the first in a series. The sequel, Ravenscliffe, was published in September 2012, and the third book in the series, Eden Falls, in September 2013. Sanderson's next book, with a working title of The Dog Days of Annie Doyle, and which is not part of the Netherwood series, will be published in spring 2017 by Orion.

  "text" : "Jacques Bobet OC (1919–1996) was a French filmmaker who played a key role in the National Film Board of Canada's move into French language filmmaking. Bobet joined the National Film Board (NFB) in 1947, at a time when 90% of the NFB staff was English-speaking, and its French Unit found it hard to retain French Canadian filmmakers. Bobet worked to strengthen the French Unit and retain French talent, and was appointed producer of French versions in 1951. By 1956, when he was named executive producer of the newly created Versions Unit, he had been involved in versioning approximately 500 films. That same year, the NFB's headquarters was relocated from Ottawa to Montreal, improving the NFB's reputation in French Canada and making the NFB more attractive to French-speaking filmmakers. In 1959, Bobet assumed responsibility for producing more original French-language films. In 1964, a separate French production branch was finally established, with Bobet as one of the four executive producers."

Since 1957, the association gave great musical success like, for example, Zon zon zon interpreted by Colette Renard and Michèle Arnaud (1957), Julie by Marcel Amont (1957), Les boutons dorés by Jean-Jacques Debout, and Repris by Barbara in 1959. Their greatest success will arrive in 1961 when they won Eurovision Song Contest along Jean-Claude Pascal, who competed for Luxembourg with the song Nous les amoureux. The following year, they got 3th place with Petit bonhomme, sung by Camillo Felgen. Many performers of his songs are, in particular, France Gall (Christiansen , Mes premières vraies vacances), Juliette Greco (Jusqu'à où, jusqu'à quand and Les Mariés), Françoise Hardy (Va pas prendre un tambour, Le Temps des souvenirs) Serge Lama (Les P'tites Femmes de Pigalle),Claude Nougaro (Une petite fille , Le Jazz et la Java , Je suis sous…), Serge Reggiani (Le Petit Garçon) and Edith Piaf, for which he wrote Dans ma rue (1946). In 1964 he composed the music for the French version of The Taming of the Shrew, telefilm that Pierre Badel adapted from the Shakespeare's book."

Abod was a co-founder and the singer of the New Haven Women's Liberation Rock Band from 1970 until 1976. The highly political band played, once, in front of the White House during a women's liberation march, and at Niantic State Prison, where Erica Huggins was imprisoned. The group also recorded with the Chicago Women's Liberation Rock Band. Her voice was described as \"a deep blue voice she could have taken to Hollywood,\" by Naomi Weisstein. In 1972, Ms. published \"Feminist Rock: No More Balls and Chains,\" which Abod contributed too, along with Virginia Blaisdell and Naomi Weisstein. She also co-wrote \"The Liberation of Lydia,\" the first feminist radio soap opera in 1970 and was the first woman in Connecticut to host a nightly AM talk radio program, \"The Jennifer Abod Show,\" which ran from 1977 until 1980. She would go on to co-found Women's Health Advocates, and along with Esta Soler and Laura Ponsor Sporazzi, she interviewed women in drug treatment programs in the Northeast. This program evaluated the treatment of women in these facilities, and were published in a report, \"The ABC's of Drug Treatment for Women,\" in 1976. In 1988 she formed her own production company, Profile Productions, which produced and distributed media relating to feminist activists and cultural workers. Her first documentary was released in 2002, titled \"The Edge of Each Other's Battles: The Vision of Audre Lorde.\" Abod's personal archive is in the collection of the Sophia Smith Collection at Smith College."

  "text" : "Jean-Jacques Paulet (26 April 1740 – 4 August 1826) was a French mycologist. Paulet was born in Anduze, France and studied medicine in Montpellier, where he received his PhD in March 1764. He published in Paris in 1765 a book titled d’Histoire de la petite vérole, avec les moyens d’en préserver les enfants... (History of smallpox, with the means to protect children ...), which was followed by a French translation of the book on smallpox by Abu Bakr Mohammad Ibn Zakariya al-Razi (ninth or tenth century). He completed this series of works by three more books, published in Paris between 1768 and 1776, in which he outlined wide-scale measures of smallpox protection. Paulet was interested in ergotism and published several studies in Mémoires de l’Académie de médecine alongside such scientist as Henri Alexandre Tessier (1741–1837) and Charles Jacques Saillant (1747–1814). He was also known for his opposition to the animal magnetism. In 1805 he published a treatise on the bite of asp viper and in 1815 a review of the history of medicine by Sprengel. His expertise in mycology was summarized in Traité complet sur les champignons (1775) which was considered a seminal work on fungi. It will be followed in 1791 by Traité complet sur les champignons and two other books on botany: Examen de l’ouvrage de M. Stackhouse sur les genres de plantes de Théophraste (1816) and La Botanique ou Flore et Faune de Virgile (1824). Paulet was elected to the French Academy of Sciences in the section of medicine and surgery on 22 October 1821. The standard author abbreviation Paulet is used to indicate this individual as the author when citing a botanical name."

  "text" : "Jacques Molinos (4 June 1743 – 19 February 1831) was a French architect. Molinos was born in Lyon and studied in Paris at the Royal Academy of Architecture under Jacques-François Blondel. The Halle aux blés (Corn Exchange), on the site of the present Bourse de commerce was designed by Nicolas Le Camus de Mézières with a circular central courtyard and a double staircase. In 1782 François-Joseph Bélanger proposed to add an iron cupola to cover to courtyard, but his plan was rejected. Instead, from 1782 to 1783 a wooden dome was built to a design by Jacques-Guillaume Legrand and Jacques Molinos based on the principles defined by Philibert de l'Orme.On 16 October 1802 the cupola was destroyed by fire.Molinos and Jacques-Guillaume Legrand collaborated on the design of the Théâtre Feydeau (1789–1790, destroyed 1829)."

He was a landholder in the Welsh Marches when he was married by Stephen to the widow of Pain fitzJohn, a union that gave Josce control of Ludlow Castle. Control of the castle was contested by other noblemen, and the resulting warfare between the nobles forms the background to a late medieval romance known as Fouke le Fitz Waryn, which is mainly concerned with the actions of Josce's grandson, but also includes some material on Josce's lifetime. Josce eventually lost control of Ludlow and was granted lands in compensation by Matilda and her son, King Henry II of England, who succeeded Stephen in 1154."

  "text" : "Jacobo de la Serna (born 1965 in Espanola, New Mexico, USA) is a ceramic artist, Spanish Colonial scholar and painter. His work is exhibited in permanent collections around the United States. In 2009 de la Serna was selected for a \"one man\" exhibit at the Grounds For Sculpture Museum in Hamilton, NJ. He has given talks about his work and ceramic traditions at museums and galleries including the Denver Art Museum. de la Serna is a direct descendent of some of the earliest Spanish families to settle in New Mexico in 1598; he cites these deep cultural roots as both an influence and a guiding light for his artwork. He has been a consistent award winning artist at the annual Spanish Market in Santa Fe, NM numerous times since 1994. de la Serna is seen as a mentor by many young artists. de la Serna has been collected by museums such as the Santa Fe Museum of International Folk Art, The Denver Art Museum, Grounds For Sculpture and the Albuquerque Museum. His work is in both private and corporate collections throughout the United and abroad, and he is represented by numerous galleries. Andrew Connors, Curator of the Albuquerque Museum has said of de la Serna's work: vessels are astoundingly sensuous and exist as pure contemporary sculpture, however his knowledge of past production, technique, and aesthetics means that they are not simply disassociated objects within the art-for-art's-sake idiom. Supreme craftsmanship combined with refined and elegant aesthetics gives rise to great art. Adding knowledge of age-old technologies to that mix gives rise to deeply rooted, profound objects with cultural and contemporary relevance. The work Jacobo creates represents the future of the art form. de la Serna is keeping tradition alive by preventing it from stagnating."

After marrying his second wife Betsy Rose in 1836, they moved to France where their first two children were born. They emigrated to New Zealand in 1839, with their daughter dying en route. They lived in Wellington, where two more children were born before his wife died in 1845. Becoming chief constable at Akaroa, he put his eldest son out to work and the younger two children into care, but struggled to pay for this from his reduced wages. Zillwood also worked as Akaroa's postmaster. He married again in 1850, and was reunited with his younger children, one of whom died in 1853. Later that year the local police force was halved and Zillwood lost his job. He turned to drink as his financial situation worsened, and his wife left him mid-1854. After arranging his affairs, he shot himself in the mouth on Friday 13 October 1854 while on suicide watch and died of his wounds after several days of suffering. His body was buried at night without funeral rites after an inquest found him guilty of felo de se. This appears to be the earliest reported felo de se in New Zealand."

A native of London, Ontario, Hedger grew up in Lambeth and Westminster, Ontario and later graduated from the University of Western Ontario.

In 1427 he was found a place in the royal household as physician and tutor to the young Henry VI. In 1442 he became the first medical man to sit in parliament, as a knight of the shire for Middlesex. In 1439 he was appointed Chancellor of the Exchequer and Warden of the Royal Mint. After 1450 he was out of favour, with Parliament demanding his removal from court as an undesirable influence.

  "text" : "Jacob Yost Shantz (2 May 1822 – 28 October 1909) was a businessman from Ontario who helped Mennonites migrate from Russia to southern Manitoba. Shantz was born and raised in Ebytown, Upper Canada. (The community subsequently became Berlin and, lastly, Kitchener, Ontario.) He was part of that community, and its success, in a large way. He was involved in a variety of successful business ventures during his lifetime. His further notability in Canadian history comes from his involvement with settling Mennonites from Russia in Canada. In 1872, Shantz accompanied Bernhard Warkentin, a southern Russian Mennonite, on an exploratory trip to western Canada. He had been asked by the Canadian government to oversee this exploration. After his visit to Manitoba, Shantz sent a report of his findings to the government. Immigration officials liked the report and requested a more detailed account. The results of this request was a report called Narrative of a journey to Manitoba. When published and translated into various languages, this narrative became promotional literature for European immigration to Canada. A community in Manitoba, Schanzenfeld, was named in his honour."

His 2005 book On American Soil investigated the August 1944 killing of Italian prisoner of war Guglielmo Olivotto at Fort Lawton in Seattle, Washington, and concludes that the resulting military trial—in which Leon Jaworski was the lead prosecutor—was a miscarriage of justice. Whereas Hamann's own 1987 documentary on the subject largely accepted the then-conventional view that Olivotto had been lynched by African-American soldiers, the book went back to primary sources and heavily revised this view. The book led to a congressional review and ultimately the voiding of the court-martial of those soldiers. Hamann reported for KING-TV from 1983 to 1990. He also worked for CNN and PBS, and won ten regional Emmy Awards."

  "text" : "John Frederick \"Jack\" Fulbeck (December 19, 1916 – December 25, 2011) was an American poet and professor of comparative literature at the California State Polytechnic University, Pomona. He served two terms as president of the California State Poetry Society. His poems have won numerous awards, such as \"Apostrophe to Amour\" and \"Introspection in the Cold\" which won first prizes in California state level poetry contests, and \"In Fuente Vaqueros\" which won an international grand prize. His poem \"Challengers\" was read by Taylor Wang from the orbiting Space Shuttle Challenger in 1985 and is on record at the National Archives Building. He authored three books of poetry: I Sleep With Strangers, Gilgamesh, and Sifted Ashes. Fulbeck was born in New York City and raised in Bloomfield, New Jersey. He attended Tusculum College in Tennessee on a New Jersey State Scholarship. Following the bombing of Pearl Harbor, he enlisted in the United States Navy and was stationed as a fighter pilot in the South Pacific. After the end of World War II, he worked as a newspaper and magazine editor and a freelance writer. In 1960, Fulbeck received his Ph.D. in Comparative Literature from the University of Southern California and married Seckyue Mary Chan and adopted her two children, Josephine and David. His third child, Kip Fulbeck, was born in 1965."

Because he was still a minor, his mother and his uncle Albert II of Gorizia acted as regent. Since he died young, he never actually reigned himself. He married Anna of Habsburg, the daughter of the anti-king Frederick the Fair, who was a second cousin in his mother. The marriage remained childless. Since he died childless, he was succeeded by the sons of his uncle Albert II. They were Meinhard VI (until 1374), Albert III (until 1365) and Henry V (until 1362).

  "text" : "James Basil Wilkie Roberton (1896–1996) was a New Zealand soldier, doctor, historian and writer. He was born in Auckland, Auckland, New Zealand in 1896. James Basil Wilkie Roberton was born in Auckland on 30 January 1896, the second of four children of Eliza Ann Wilkie and her husband, Ernest Roberton, a prominent medical practitioner. Educated at King’s College, Auckland, Jim excelled not only academically, but also in rugby and athletics. After leaving school he went on to the University of Cambridge in England in 1913 to study medicine. On the outbreak of the First World War, however, Roberton joined the King Edward’s Horse and, once commissioned, the 11th Battalion, Northumberland Fusiliers, serving as a signal officer in France from August 1915, and in Italy. In 1918, as a lieutenant, he was made a DSO for leading his men through barbed wire to secure Treviso bridge north of Venice. During his service overseas he was twice wounded by shrapnel and had a brush with death when a bullet sliced through his pack, plate and mug. After the war Jim Roberton returned to his studies, graduating MB, ChB from Cambridge University in 1925. He later gained his FRCS and FRCP. On 27 April 1928 he married Gladys Muriel Christmas at Worthing, Sussex. They emigrated to New Zealand, where Jim gained a position at King George V Hospital in Rotorua. In 1929 he took up private practice in Te Awamutu. Gladys died on 29 August that year. On 9 February 1932 he married Marion Valetta Allwood in Morrinsville. They had five children: three girls and two boys. During the 1930s Roberton became well known within the Te Awamutu community. He served on the executive of the RSA, was involved in the town’s athletic and cycling clubs, was president of the Te Awamutu Golf Club and the beautifying society, and was a member of the town library committee. During the Second World War he served with the New Zealand Medical Corps at Guadalcanal and New Caledonia. In January 1941 he was appointed to the temporary rank of captain, and in October 1943 to the temporary rank of major. After his discharge the following year he returned to his practice in Te Awamutu. In 1949 Jim Roberton shifted with his family to the coastal settlement of Kawhia. He saw this move as an essential step in furthering his study into Tainui history – an interest ignited through his involvement with the Te Awamutu Historical Society since 1936. From the mid-1940s he had researched Maori whakapapa, obtaining information from fellow society member Raureti Te Huia, and in 1949 he produced The tribes of Te Awamutu district. However, he did most of his work at Kawhia, and after years of meticulous research published a booklet in 1965 entitled Maori settlement of the Waikato district. This was revised in 1982 and was widely used by students. He wrote numerous articles on such topics as genealogies as a basis for Maori chronology, and the evaluation of Maori tradition as history, and argued that tribal traditions should be compared and analysed for their validity as historical evidence. He was the editor of the Journal of the Te Awamutu Historical Society from 1966 to 1975. As the doctor for the Kawhia district, Roberton often visited patients in remote areas. After practising medicine there for 20 years he retired and moved back to Te Awamutu. Retirement did not slow him down, though, and he continued with his research, which he typed up himself. In 1973 he completed a family history that traced his roots back to the twelfth century. After the death of his wife on 12 August 1974 Roberton lived alone, cooking and caring for himself and mowing his own lawns. A resourceful man, he designed and made his own hearing aid when his hearing began to fail. His final book, Kakepuku, was published in 1987. A foundation member of the Rotary Club of Te Awamutu, he was made a Paul Harris fellow in 1988 and the club’s first life member in 1993. He enjoyed the Anzac Day parades and would not miss one, even marching at the age of 99. He saw them as a way to catch up with his comrades and to be ‘just one of the boys’. Jim Roberton died 26 days short of his 100th birthday on 4 January 1996 in Te Awamutu. A slightly built man with a no-nonsense look, he was respected by Maori and Pakeha alike for his encyclopaedic knowledge of the pre-European history of the Tainui people and his wide community involvement. Although firm in his opinions, he was modest about his accomplishments and once said of his life, ‘I enjoyed it, but who is interested, I did not do much’."

He emigrated to Lake Park, Minnesota at age eight. He graduated from Detroit Lakes, Minnesota High School in 1897 and from the University of Minnesota Law School in 1900. He practiced law in Warren, Minnesota with Andrew Grindeland, who was appointed a district court judge in 1903. In 1916, he served as a delegate from Minnesota to Democratic National Convention. In 1927, Olson took on as an associate Oscar Knutson, who eventually succeeded him both as a district court judge and on the Minnesota Supreme Court. Upon Grindeland's retirement in 1930, Governor Theodore Christianson appointed Olson to replace him. Olson was elected to the post in 1930. On March 5, 1934, Governor Floyd B. Olson appointed Olson to the Minnesota Supreme Court. He was elected to the position later that year and re-elected in 1940 and 1946. In 1948, Olson retired from the court and was replaced by Knutson. Olson was the founder and first secretary of the Marshall County Agricultural Association. He was married on July 14, 1909 in Becker County, Minnesota to the former Caroline L. Sletten. Two of their adult children both became lawyers. A third child, Julius Johan Olson, died at age four. Both Julius J. and Caroline Sletten Olson died in Marshall County, Minnesota and were buried in the Greenwood Cemetery in Warren, Minnesota."

John Huntbach was the son of Thomas Huntbach, whose sister Margery had married Sir William Dugdale. Dugdale was thus John Huntbach's uncle. Huntbach was most notable as a collector of rare and important historical manuscripts, consisting mostly of copies of parish registers, family records and documents and histories of the titled families of Staffordshire. These proved extremely useful to later historians. For example, Shaw's \"History of Staffordshire,\" relied heavily on Huntbach's manuscripts for much of its information content. The Huntbach surname is reputed to come from a small place near Eccleshall in the time of King Edward III."

His contributions to debates such as the amendments to the National Monuments Bill highlighted a well informed approach to heritage that was both practical and principled. In that debate, he also referred to preservation of thatched cottages which was later to be the subject a detailed book. He lost his seat at the 1989 election. He resigned from Fianna Fáil in 1989, within hours of that election and his letter to the then Fianna Fáil general secretary, Frank Wall highlighted his criticism of Charles Haughey on the grounds that there was “no ideology, no consistency, no positive approach’’ within Fianna Fáil, and that debate was stifled, as a key driver in his decision. He subsequently ran as an independent candidate for the 1994 European Parliament elections for the Leinster constituency, getting 6,752 votes (2.6%) based on a manifesto which included a strong anti-hunting and anti-hare coursing policy. He continued as activist against aspects of planning including the approach of Meath County Council to regulation of septic tanks."

  "text" : "John Horsefield (18 July 1792 – 6 March 1854) was an English handloom weaver and amateur botanist after whom the daffodil Narcissus 'Horsfieldii' is named. Horsefield had little formal schooling, and acquired most of his botanical knowledge through self-study and involvement in local botanical groups, which provided a venue for working class people to share knowledge, in part by pooling money to purchase books. Horsefield founded one such society, the Prestwich Botanical Society, and was later president of a larger botanical society covering a wide area around north Manchester. He made several botanical discoveries and cultivated two new plants. A number of his writings about the working class and also some poetry were published, but nothing concerning botany other than in connection with the subject of the working class. He lived most of his life near Whitefield in Lancashire, in dire poverty. At the time of his death he had been married for 42 years and had fathered eleven children."

  "text" : "Julie Bradshaw is a teacher, business motivator, sports coach, swimmer, counsellor (therapist) and a coach of NLP (Neuro Linguistic Programming), Time Line Therapy and has achieved considerable personal success especially in long distance, English Channel and Marathon swimming, where she currently holds several world records. She first swam the English Channel at the age of 15 and in 2002 did it again using the swimming stroke butterfly, which she completed in 14 hours, 18 minutes. This broke the previous record by over nine hours. Bradshaw has raised thousands for charities such as Breakthrough Breast Cancer, Child Line and several Children’s Hospices. Bradshaw has earned her several honours. In 2004, she was nominated for the Sunday Times Inspirational Award. In 2006, she was awarded an MBE for 'Services to Swimming and Charity' which was the same year Loughborough University in recognition of her achievements conferred upon her an honorary doctorate. In 2007 Bradshaw was recognized with a place in the International Swimming Hall of Fame, Fort Lauderdale, USA. Bradshaw completed a further achievement in the history of long distance butterfly swimming in July 2011. She circumnavigated the 28.5 miles course around Manhattan Island in New York in the fastest documented (stroke based records are not certified) butterfly time of 9 hours and 28 minutes. There is an acknowledged title in the swimming world that of the Triple Crown. A Triple Crown is an elite group who have swum the English Channel (22 miles), Catalina Channel (22 miles) and Manhattan Island (28.5 miles). Swimmers do this on freestyle, yet only two swimmers in the world have achieved two of the three on the proper traditional butterfly, Bradshaw being one and Vicki Keith (Canada) another. Bradshaw assists and enables others interested in long distance swimming to achieve their goals, in particular those wishing to swim the English Channel through her voluntary work with The Channel Swimming association."

  "text" : "Jenelle Hutcherson (born November 15, 1985) is an American hair artist, activist, public figure, designer, youth mentor and visionary. She is best known for being the first openly lesbian contestant and the first contestant to wear a tuxedo in the Miss Long Beach 2011 pageant in Long Beach, CA, and the Miss California USA pageant in Palm Desert, CA 2012. Her participation in the pageants shattered stereotypes in many angles; feminist groups, women who have never fit in society’s ideal of what beauty is, butch women embracing themselves (tuxedo and swimsuit/ she tailored and sewn her own for both pageants), the standard that only feminine women enter pageants, and that women from minority descent don't win pageants. Hutcherson became a name in the LGBT community, the pageant community, and made headline news in media such as NBC, CBS, KCAL9, Huffington Post, After Ellen, The Advocate, NOH8 Campaign, Courage Campaign, GLAAD, SDGLN (San Diego Gay and Lesbian News), Curve Magazine, GreaterLongBeach.com, Press-Telegram, and Los Angeles Times. The campaign of “Vote for Jenelle” went international after AfterEllen.com published an article about Hutcherson in September 2011."

  "text" : "Jacob von Sandrart (3 May 1630, Frankfurt am Main — 15 August 1708, Nuremberg) was a German engraver primarily active in Nuremberg. At age ten Sandrart obtained his artistic training from his better-known uncle Joachim von Sandrart in Amsterdam. After spending time in Danzig and Regensburg, he married Regina Christina Eimart, daughter of the engraver Georg Christoph Eimart the elder, on 10 June 1654. The couple settled in Nuremberg in 1656 and remained there for the rest of their lives. His daughter Susanne Maria von Sandrart was also an artist and engraver. Sandrart was a very prolific artist; over 400 engravings from his hand are extant. He was best known as a portraitist of prominent contemporary citizens of Nuremberg, as an engraver of maps, and as an illustrator of the literary works of Nuremberg writers, especially Sigmund von Birken. Today Sandrart is best remembered as the founder and first director of the Nuremberg Academy of Fine Arts (est. 1662)."

  "text" : "Juan Ecomo Ndong is an Equatoguinean political activist currently imprisoned on weapons possession charges. His imprisonment has drawn protest from the US State Department and Amnesty International, the latter of which considers him to be a prisoner of conscience. Ndong was active with the Progress Party of Equatorial Guinea (PPGE), a banned political party opposing the long-dominant Democratic Party of Equatorial Guinea. In mid-April 2008, he was arrested without a warrant. Within a week, fellow PPGE activists Cruz Obiang Ebele, Emiliano Esono Michá, Gumersindo Ramírez Faustino, Gerardo Angüe Mangue, and Bonifacio Nguema Ndong were also arrested. Ndong was held for one months at the police station, turning which time he was allegedly beaten with cables to extract a confession. In May 2008, the six men were charged with knowledge of a weapons cache in the home of another PPGE activist, Saturnino Ncogo. Ncogo had died in prison on early March in suspicious circumstances. Authorities alleged he had thrown himself from the top bunk of his cell to commit suicide, but relatives received his body in an advanced state of decomposition, and no investigation was ever conducted. According to Amnesty International, the six men were given an unfair trial at which no evidence was presented save the weapons from Ncogo's home and the statements the six had made under duress; in addition, the six defendants alleged that police had altered their statements after the defendants had signed them. Despite being charged with unrelated crimes, the six were tried alongside Simon Mann, a UK national who had helped to organize a 2004 coup attempt. The six PPGE members were given sentences of one to five years apiece. The US State Department considers Ndong a political prisoner, and has objected to his continued imprisonment. Amnesty International named him a prisoner of conscience, and has called for his immediate release."

  "text" : "Jay Traver, an entomologist, published a paper in Proceedings of the Entomological Society of Washington called \"Unusual Scalp Dermatitis in Humans Caused by the Mite, Dermatophagoides (Acarina, epidermoptidae).\" in 1951. This paper was a comprehensive study of a mite infestation of her scalp. Travers was the only one who could detect the mites, and they resisted all forms of treatment. This was a hallucination. Travers was diagnosed with Delusory Parasitosis, or Ekbom syndrome. This is an illness in which the victim believes that there are bugs living underneath their skin that will not go away, and that nobody else can detect. Therefore, to Traver, all of the results in the published paper are completely true. However, the issue is then raised on if the paper should be retracted for scientific misconduct being as the results are false. When this question is raised, some then argue that retracting the paper will be discrimination against the mentally ill. Another side argues that even though the results were hallucinated, that this paper could instead be a study on the disease itself coming first hand."

He was one of eight children. Carr worked for a number of animation studios, and was a credited animator since at least the early 1930s. When, in 1930, Charles Mintz found a cartoon distributor in Columbia Pictures and moved his operations to California, Mr. Carr was amongst his staff; whilst working at the Warner Bros. studio of Leon Schlesinger, he provided the voice of Buddy from 1933 to 1935: he is also a credited animator on one Buddy short, Buddy in Africa. Carr is also credited with naming the cartoon characters Tom and Jerry when Hanna-Barbera had a naming contest amongst the staff; Carr won the $25 prize The Art of Hanna-Barbera: Fifty Years of Creativity, Ted Sennett. Hanna and Barbera were said to be unhappy to have their characters named after a popular drink of the time, but history later proved that names having dual associations are the most popular as they are easier for the public to remember Carr family lore."

He is best known as a co-founder (along with Stewart Winter) of VideoHelper Music, a co-writer of theme songs for shows such as ABC News Nightline, The Soup, The Suze Orman Show, and as a founding member of the Production Music Association. After graduating from Columbia University in 1993, Saba briefly played keyboards for the band Fabulon (EMI/Chrysalis) and appeared on MTV's 120 Minutes. He later composed the original score for Two Ninas, starring Amanda Peet and Ron Livingston. In 1995, he and Stewart Winter co-founded VideoHelper and launched it from a bootlegger's warehouse in NYC. Today, VideoHelper's music is used daily in over 60 countries by major international broadcasters (TV, cable and radio) and in films, movie trailers, websites, and almost anywhere audio-including media is created. The company currently operates out of a 6,600sf facility just off Union Square in Manhattan. Some other notable credits include music for the NFL, the Today Show, the Olympics, and several Super Bowl commercials. In 1997, Joe was part of a group of eight composers and publishers who joined together to advocate on behalf of the production music community and subsequently founded the Production Music Association (PMA). From approximately ten members in 1997 the PMA's membership has grown to over 445 production music libraries and has now become the industry's leading voice. Joe plays several instruments, is married with two children and currently lives in Brooklyn, NY."

  "text" : "Julius Ludwig August Koch (/ˈkɔːx/; German: [ˈkɔχ]; 4 December 1841, Laichingen, Württemberg – 25 June 1908, Zwiefalten) was a German psychiatrist whose work influenced later concepts of personality disorders. Koch was born in the town of Laichingen in the state of Württemberg. His father was a general practitioner physician who headed his own private insane asylum. Koch worked as a chemist for several years and then studied medicine in Tubingen from 1863 to 1867. He subsequently worked as a physician, later joining a psychiatric hospital. In 1874 he became director of the state mental hospital in Zwiefalten (Württemberg). Described as deeply rooted in a Christian faith, Koch's first works were philosophically-minded. In 1882 he published \"Epistomological Investigations\" (Erkenntnistheoretische Untersuchungen), and in 1885 \"Outline of Philosophy\" (Grundriss der Philosophie). In 1886 his \"Reality and its Knowledge\" (Die Wirklichkeit und ihre Erkenntnis) was an attempt to join the philosophy of Immanuel Kant with Christian theories. Koch argued that the body and soul are part of the natural material world, while the mind (Geist) is the way through which freedom, but also a moral claim by God, are exercised. He felt that philosophical trends against the Christianity of a nation would lead to afflictions and dangers. Overall his philosophy has been described as homespun and quite dogmatic, especially with regard to the religious elements."

In 1915, while based for a summer holiday at the Hermitage, Mount Cook Village, she began a two-year climbing partnership with the Austrian guide Conrad Kain. They ascended many peaks, including Maunga Ma, Mt Jeannette,  Malte Brun, and two unnamed peaks. In 1916, aged 57, with Conrad Kain she became the second woman, after Freda Du Faur, to traverse Mount Cook. Aged 68, she made her first ascent of the low peak of Mount Rolleston in Arthur's Pass National Park. Aged 80, she travelled to Kashmir to visit Nanga Parbat."

His final day in the legislature was in December 2001, when he voted to confirm Leigh Saufley as the new Chief Justice of the Maine Supreme Judicial Court. At the time of Abromson's death, the Maine Senate was evenly split between Republicans and Democrats, with one unenrolled senator as well. His death gave the Democrats a 17-16 advantage, though Republican Rick Bennett maintained his position as President of the Maine Senate due to a power-sharing agreement. State Representative Michael F. Brennan narrowly won a special election to replace Abromson."

In 1900, his family shifted to Dublin due to appointment of his father as medical inspector under the Local Government Board of Ireland. He attended Presbyterian College in North Carolina and later, Trinity College, Dublin. Soon after his graduation from the Trinity College, he was appointed as a demonstrator in pathology and bacteriology at Sheffield University in South Yorkshire, England. However, in 1919 he returned to Dublin and became pathologist and medical inspector under the Local Government Board and the professor of forensic and preventive medicine at the Royal College of Surgeons in 1920. He served as the professor of preventive medicine and bacteriology at Trinity College from 1924 to 1950. In 1936, Bigger was appointed dean of the medical school at Trinity College where he served until 1939. He was first elected to the Seanad at a by-election on 22 November 1947 by the University of Dublin constituency. The vacancy was caused by the appointment of T. C. Kingsmill Moore as a judge of the High Court. He was re-elected at the 1948 election. He did not contest the 1951 election. He married Patricia Mai Curtin in 1916 and they had one son and one daughter. Bigger died on 17 August 1951."

  "text" : "Joerg Steineck is a German filmmaker, editor and graphic designer/artist who is based in Berlin. During his study of film and design, he produced a few short documentaries and fictional films. In his films he often explores subcultures such as underground music genres, and people who exist parallel to or on the edge of society. He seeks to tell common but nevertheless extraordinary stories, and generate unique audiovisual atmospheres. Steineck also works as a graphic artist and illustrator. In his 84-minute feature documentary Truckfighters, he combines creative elements to tell the story about a common Swedish rock band in a most unconventional way. \"Truckfighters Fuzzomentary\" attracted media attention due to guest appearances of well known musicians and bands including Josh Homme and Fu Manchu. The release of his music documentary Lo Sound Desert is set for 2012. Trailers for this film are available on the internet since 2006 and have attracted attention of fans of the musical genre 'Desert or Stoner Rock', which is also a main topic in Truckfighters. Steineck started his creative development with drawing, painting and photographing during his childhood. He shot his first film in the age of thirteen with a friend's VHS camera. Steineck also contributes musical content from time to time to his electronic music project The Gap Influence."

At that time, Christianity was already sweeping through the entire Western Region of now Nigeria and the Niger Delta, through the evangelistic activities of the Church Missionary Society with Bishop Ajayi Crowther as the pioneer Missionary. So, trained in Lagos, John Ikuru embraced Christianity and became exposed to Christian ethics and philosophy. In 1900 his father, King Ikuru Efuya, died, and it became obvious that John Ikuru would be the next Okama (Ruler) of Ikuru Town, Andoni. That came true in 1904 when he was invited to return and rule his people. Also in 1904, the British conducted a Punitive Expedition against the still-heathern Obolo people and Yok- Obolo at Alabie (Agwut-Obolo) because of their aggression against other groups in the area heathenism. The British destroyed their House of Skulls and the Shrine of Yok-Obolo in 1904, and split Andoni into six parts, each attached to one of the six Native Courts in the Niger Delta. Ikuru Town was attached to Opobo Town Native Court and Alabie (Agwut Obolo) to Bonny Native Court. M. D. W. Jeffrey said that the purpose of doing this was to destroy Andoni as a political entity. When John Ikuru returned from Lagos to Ikuru Town in 1904. Evidently, he had a herculean task in his hands. He came back with a ‘Bible’ in one hand, and “chalk” in the other. His father was a rich trader and had laid a solid foundation for him. Soon, he was able to build a palace in Ikuru Town from where he started his evangelistic work. He produced a small group of followers whom he sent out to the other villages to Christianize them and initiate some rudimentary education in such places:To Okoroete, he sent Ralph O. IkuruTo Ngo, he sent Sylvanus IkuruTo Ebukuma, he sent James AccraTo Oronija, he sent Samuel IkuruTo Akaradi, he sent George Ekpirikpo; andTo Ataba, he sent Julius Urombo5These young men revolutionized not only ecclesiasticism in these places, but also education. John Ikuru was made a Warrant Chief by the Colonial Administration and attached to the Opobo Native Court. In 1913 he was able to prevail on the Colonial Administration to open a Court in Obolo (Andoni) as the people were now Christians. Existing Records claimed that at that point it was the only such Native Court in the Federation. Very soon he and Chief Ereforokuma were able to take legal action against the Opobo for violating the Obolo-Opobo Treaty of 1869, when they started migrating to other Obolo land not given to them in 1869.Unfortunately, because of leadership problems between him and Chief Ereforokima, the Colonial Administration closed down the Court in 1922 and transferred the case to the 6 Calabar branch of the Supreme Court. In 1925–26, the Supreme Court passed judgment, granting the Obolo (Andoni) their requests. First, the “Andoni Mainland” remained exclusive to the Obolo (Andoni) people. Also the tribute payable to Yok-Obolo by King Jaja had its name changed to “Customary gifts,” and Opobo Town was given three islands instead of one which was given to Jaja in 1869, and Nkoro was given one island exclusive to them. The Colonial Administration, particularly M. D. W. Jeffrey’s, had observed that through the Oru, they the Obolo (Andoni) could administer themselves and therefore approved the granting of a Native Court. It was established in 1930, at Agafor, with Ralph O. Ikuru as the Scribe. From then, the Obolo (Andoni), not only unified their segments, scattered all over the Niger Delta, but started ruling themselves. In all these, John Ikuru was instrumental and pushed Obolo (Andoni) forward as a member of the Oru. By 1930, John Ikuru had opened the main Church building, St. Simon’s Anglican Church, in Ikuru Town, whose foundation stone was laid by Bishop A. M. Gelsthorpe on February 22, 1937; it became the ecclesiastical headquarters of Obolo (Andoni). Ikuru was a Knight of the Order of St. Christopher (KSC) awarded posthumously. Economically, King (Sir) John Ikuru was a wealthy palm oil merchant, with trading posts in Ekpirikpe, Azumini, Uruafoug, Ndiya and Ekpenukpa in Ibibio land in present day Akwa-Ibom State of Nigeria. He came to be regarded as the symbol of light and enlightenment in Obolo (Andoni) history. This is not only in terms of the spread of the gospel in the area, but also in terms of the spread of education in the area.As the only person in the area with secondary school education at that time – he was very close to the British Colonial Administrators in Opobo Division of Calabar Province, where Andoni was. Apart from M. D. W. Jeffrey, John Ikuru was virtually the “Voice of Obolo” and the source of the coming to Obolo (Andoni) of the Native Court in 1930. John Ikuru died in 1947, after having trained a large number of clerics and secondary school leavers. Also, he was married with many children."

  "text" : "Johann Elias Ridinger (16 February 1698, Ulm – 10 April 1767, Augsburg) was a German painter, engraver, draughtsman and publisher. He is considered one of the most famous German engravers of animals, particularly horses, hounds and hunting scenes. He began his training in Ulm with the painter Christoph Resch (1701–16), and later studied under Johann Falch (1687–1727) in Augsburg. He learned the art of engraving from Georg Philipp Rugendas. On the invitation of Wolf, Freiherr von Metternich (1706–31), he spent three years in Regensburg: his coursing and visits to the riding school there proved decisive for his development. His engraved, etched and scratched sheets show the animals in characteristic movements and positions in a landscape environment. The ornamental movements in his works show visibly Rococo stylistic tendencies. He later founded his own art publishing house in Augsburg, where most of his works appeared. In 1759 he became the director of the Augsburg Stadtakademie. His drawings were often executed with precision and taste and hence his work was held in high esteem and was also transferred to decoration, porcelain and ceramics."

  "text" : "Jeong Ki-ryong (1562–1622) was a prominent Korean Army general during the Joseon Dynasty. He fought against the Japanese invasions of Korea (1592–1598) (Seven Years' War), and won the battles of Geochang and Geumsan. He was one of those who recaptured the Sangju castle, captured the Japancese general in Goryeong, and recaptured Seongju, Hapcheon, Uiryeong, Kyungju and Ulsan. Jeong Ki-ryong was born in Jinju, South Gyeongsang Province in 1562. His original name was Jeong Mu-su (정무수; 鄭茂壽). He was the son of Jeong Ho, Fourth State Councillor (Jwachanseong 좌찬성). In 1586, He passed the military examination (무과; 武科) and renamed Ki-ryong by the King's command. In 1590, he got to serve as a drill instructor under the Shin Rip, Commander of the Right Gyeongsangdo. When the war broke in 1592, he got promoted to manager, starting to serve under the Cho Gyeong, Marshal of the Right Gyeongsangdo. At that time, he has recommended to General Cho Gyeong a scheme to check an advance of Japanese army, as a consequence of complying his artifice, they have destroyed 500 of Japanese army in a Battle of Geochang. He has jumped in the Battle of Geumsan and saved Cho Gyeong who was captured by Japanese army as a prisoner of war, so he has got a nickname of a \"Zhao Yun of Joseon\" since his shape was very similar to the Zhao Yun who had rushed in the site of the combat in order to save a Liu Shan at the Battle of Changban. After then He defended against the Japanese armies' attack at Jeolla province as appointed as the Lord of Gonyang. In succession, after he was appointed the lord of Sangju which was lost by the Japanese army, he reseized that castle of Sangju by fighting with that Japanese army. As soon as the second war broke out against the Japan in 1597, his Joseon army broke the Japanese army Goryeong and captured the chief of the Japanese army alive. In succession, he reseized many castles such as Seongju, Hapcheon, Chogye, Uiryeong, Kyungju and Ulsan and then was promoted to Commander of the Right Gyeongsangdo. After he had led the Joseon-Ming combined forces in the year 1598, he swept the remnants of the defeated Japanese army in the areas of Gyeongsang provinces. General Jeong kept staying in Gyeongsang provinces and prepared to prevent the reinvasion of the Japan, though the war against the Japan ended in the year 1601. He was promoted as a field marshal (Sanghogun 상호군) in 1610, and after that as an admiral of the fleet he undertook the naval commander of the Three Provinces (Samdo Sugun Tongjesa 삼도수군통제사) and died in camp of Tongyeong in 1622."

Bland began her activism in 1961, attending a freedom and voters' rights meeting presided over by Martin Luther King Jr. The Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) members active in Selma organized local teenagers to participate in the movement, including marching on \"Bloody Sunday\" and \"Turn Around Tuesday\". On \"Bloody Sunday\", March 7, 1965, Bland witnessed fellow activists being beaten by the police and Alabama State Troopers. Bland remains active in several local and regional organizations, including the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, the NAACP, the Sunflower Project, Ladies With A Mission, and her church, Ward Chapel in Prattville, Alabama. She has spoken at conferences and workshops for the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, DC, and in the states of Maine, Wisconsin, Vermont, Minnesota, Georgia, Pennsylvania, Texas, South Carolina, and throughout Alabama.

  "text" : "Joachim Wendler (born June 6, 1939, Erfurt, Germany – died September 25, 1975, Rockport, Massachusetts) was a West German aquanaut who died of an air embolism while returning to the surface of the Gulf of Maine from the Helgoland underwater habitat. He was participating in a checkout mission for the First International Saturation Study of Herring and Hydroacoustics (FISSHH) project. Wendler, a 36-year-old experienced diver, and two other German aquanauts began the two-day/two-night checkout mission on September 21, 1975. All three divers were employees of the German firm Gesellschaft fur Kernenergieverwertung in Schiffbau und Schiffahrt mbH (GKSS), which operated the Helgoland habitat. On September 23 the three Germans were joined by two American divers: Lieutenant Commander Laurence Bussey of the United States Navy, the head of the project for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), and Roger Clifford, a fisheries scientist from NOAA's laboratory at Woods Hole. Wendler, Bussey, and another of the German aquanauts, Joachim Rediske, proceeded to undergo a 49-hour decompression inside Helgoland, which was completed at 6:30 p.m. on September 24. Their return to the surface was then delayed by 15 hours due to bad weather and in order to enable them to surface in daylight. At 11:30 a.m. on September 25 the three aquanauts surfaced; Wendler was hampered by gear he was carrying. It was later theorized by Captain George F. Bond, the \"Father of Saturation Diving\", who was participating in the project, that Wendler may have been lifted ten feet or more by a passing swell just after taking a deep breath. The change in pressure would have allowed bubbles from his lungs to enter his circulatory system. In the final 15 feet before reaching the surface, Wendler suffered a massive gas embolism. Having reached the surface, Wendler clung to a buoy and waved for help. He was brought by the diving tender boat to Rockport, Massachusetts, and received oxygen, mouth-to-mouth resuscitation and external heart massage aboard the boat. Upon arrival in Rockport, Wendler was placed in a portable recompression chamber at the project's headquarters at the Ralph Waldo Emerson Inn, where he was recompressed to 165 feet. Wendler spent two hours in the chamber, attended by GKSS medical supervisor Anthony Low, M.D., before being pronounced dead. NOAA convened a board of investigation, headed by Dr. J. Morgan Wells of NOAA's Manned Undersea Science and Technology (MUST) office. The board concluded that Wendler's death \"was in no way connected with the systems in the habitat or the decompression procedures\". NOAA Associate Administrator David Wallace ordered that, in order for FISSHH to continue, a recompression chamber must be made available on the dive boat. On November 21, 1975, an American aquanaut experienced either central nervous system bends or an embolism on surfacing from Helgoland; he was successfully treated but experienced some residual disability. Captain Bond later said that the FISSHH project had as many serious safety incidents as he could remember in a project of similar length. Joachim Wendler was the world's second aquanaut to die as a result of participating in an underwater habitat project, the first having been SEALAB III aquanaut Berry L. Cannon."

His concept detailed a system that would record a sequence of keyboard strokes onto paper tape. Although no model or workable device was ever made, it is often seen as a link to the concept of punched paper for player piano rolls (1880s), as well as Herman Hollerith's punch card tabulator (used in the 1890 census), a distant precursor to the modern computer. Fenby was well known in his home community because he was both the fire chief and mayor. Fenby is also known for other inventions, notably the \"Fenby folding chair\", patented in the United States in 1881 (US patent number 244,216) and an associated camp stool. The chair became known as the Tripolina and inspired many similar designs. He died in June 1903, in King's Norton, England, UK, aged 60."

Huber was Public Relations Director for the Atlanta Flames from 1972 until 1975. Huber had a long history with the Turner Broadcasting Corporation. Huber in 1984 first joined CNN, where he hosted a sports show called The Sporting Life With Jim Huber. He also contributed to CNN Sports Illustrated, a sister network of CNN, as an anchor and sports announcer. In 2000, Huber became a full-time on-air announcer and commentator for Turner Sports, which allowed him to cover both golf and the National Basketball Association (NBA) in greater depth. During the 1990s, Huber was awarded an Emmy for an essay, \"Olympic Park Bombing\", which he wrote and delivered in response to the 1996 Centennial Olympic Park bombing during the Atlanta Olympics.

He was born in Bergen as a son of jurist and economist Einar Einarsen (1868-1913) and Emilie Wiborg (1868-1953). He finished his secondary degree in 1924, obtained the cand.oecon. degree in 1927 and the cand.jur. degree in 1930, both at the Royal Frederick University's Faculty of Law. He was hired at the Royal Frederick University in 1932, and worked there until 1936 while also being a teacher at Oslo Commerce School from 1934 to 1938. In 1936–37 he had a hiatus to study in the United States. He took the dr.philos. degree in 1939 with a doctoral dissertation titled Reinvestment cycles and their manifestation in the Norwegian shipping industry. It was inspired by econometry. He was a docent in economics and agricultural law at the Norwegian College of Agriculture from 1938 to 1947. During the occupation of Norway by Nazi Germany he was imprisoned in Grini concentration camp on 29 July 1942, and held there until the war's end. In 1947 he married Thyra Marie Pedersen, a shipmaster's daughter from Tromøya. In 1947, he was appointed Professor of Economics at the Faculty of Law, University of Oslo, where he also served as dean until 1963. When the field of economics was moved from the Faculty of Law to the new Faculty of Social Sciences, he became a professor at the new Department of Economics there. He retired in 1972.

  "text" : "Christopher John Hanna (c. 1947 – 27 December 1992), was a prison officer who held a senior position inside the Maze Prison, Northern Ireland. In June 1990 he was sentenced to life imprisonment at Maghaberry for helping the Provisional IRA kill colleague Brian Armour two years previously. He was also accused by former Ulster Defence Association (UDA) leader Andy Tyrie of complicity in UDA South Belfast brigadier John McMichael's death in 1987. McMichael was blown up by a booby-trap bomb placed underneath his car. According to Tyrie, Hanna gathered information about McMichael when the latter visited loyalist inmates. Hanna in his turn passed on the information to local Belfast actress, Rosena Brown with whom Hanna was infatuated. Brown, dubbed the \"IRA Mata Hari\", served as an Intelligence Officer of the IRA. Hanna also passed on information about Armour to Brown, who was named at Hanna's trial. Hanna was part of an IRA plan to stage a massive prison escape using weapons and explosives smuggled in by prison officers. The plan did not come to fruition. Alleged former IRA member Sean O'Callaghan, who became an informer for the Garda Síochána, was a fellow inmate of Hanna whilst both were serving their respective sentences at Maghaberry. He described him as an \"extremely dangerous and irrational man\". Hanna died of cancer at the age of 45."

  "text" : "Jonathan Lewis (born 1970) lives and works in London, UK. He makes photo-based art that explores themes of production and consumption via the elemental properties of the pixel. His subjects, ranging from candy wrappers and cigarettes to haute couture and famous works of art reflect an uncritical fascination for the artificial and the man-made. His process, often pixelating images beyond recognition, criss crosses the border between figuration and abstraction, and his work takes the form of digital prints, sculpture, video and books. He is a founding member of the ABC Artists' Books Cooperative. His work has been exhibited internationally and he is represented by Bonni Benrubi Gallery in New York, USA. His work was included in 'Signs of a Struggle: Photography in the Wake of Postmodernism' at the Victoria & Albert Museum, London, UK in 2011, and was featured in a two-person show, 'Mosaico', with the American photographer John Pfahl at Nina Freudenheim Gallery, Buffalo, USA in 2012. Lewis's work is held in a number of public collections including the Victoria and Albert Museum, London, UK; Société Française de Photographie, Paris, France; BESart Foundation, Lisbon, Portugal; George Eastman House International Museum of Photography and Film, Rochester, New York, USA."

Oliver replaced the man who had previously been his boss, Ron Kass, as the president of Apple Records after Kass, who headed the label set up by The Beatles in 1968 and 1969, and was effectively forced from his position by the Beatles' new manager Allen Klein subsequent to being reputedly falsely accused of \"financial impropriety\". Oliver has said in print of the time \"When Klein came in he canned Ron Kass. He canned a lot of people. The Beatles put out a list and said 'These people cannot be fired'.. It was Derek [Taylor], Peter Brown, myself, Neil Aspinall, and a few more....We had built up this company where you could be very artistic and free, a lot of good ideas floated and exchanged. People had fun working there.. They didn't just put in their eight hours. They were there all the time. Klein brought his people in and turned it into an accounting office\". Indeed according to late Apple Corps chief Aspinall, who was also George Harrison's childhood friend, during the Klein reign eventually Oliver departed Apple as well, stating in a book interview, \"Peter Asher went, Tony Bramwell went, Jack Oliver went. It wasn't just slimming down- it was end of story.\" Later, among other acts, Oliver independently managed the songwriter Tom Snow."

On the evidence brought by a private detective who received a sizeable reward and despite a character reference by former prime minister, Sir Robert Stout, Meikle was convicted of sheep steeling and served five years in prison. After some years of collecting evidence, Meikle laid a charge of perjury against the private detective, who was sent to prison for four years. Meikle petitioned parliament for ₤10,000 compensation and after a lengthy debate, he was awarded ₤500 in 1897, which covered about 10% of his costs. Meikle continued his campaign to fully clear his name, but two Supreme Court judges assigned to the case took a dim view. Meikle died in 1937 a \"bitter and broken\" man. His case was \"one of the most remarkable cases\" in New Zealand's legal history. He was buried at Dunedin Southern Cemetery. Meikle contested the 1901 Caversham by-election. Of six candidates, he came last with just 0.59% of the vote."

  "text" : "Johannes Handschin a.k.a. Hans Handschin (1899–1948) was a noted Swiss artist and one of the leaders of the Basel graphic art movement known for their art deco posters. Emil Cardinaux was one of the first Swiss artists to produce posters. His minimalist style and use of bold colours was used to promote Swiss skiing resorts. Artists that followed his lead and laid the groundwork for this new art form were Augusto Giacometti, Otto Morach, Carl Moos, Burkhard Mangold, Walther Koch and Otto Baumberger. In 1925 Handschin was inspired by the transmission wheel poster of Niklaus Stoecklin (1896-1982), who had a passion for airbrushing objects, free of ornamentation, to express the perfection of the 'Machine Age' and using the technique as a substitute for photography in advertising consumer goods. This marked the start of the SachPlakat Basel school centered on the printer \"Wassermann\". During the 1930s to 1950s, hyperrealist poster artists such as Hans Handschin, Herbert Leupin, Peter Birkhäuser, Fritz Bühler, Max Dalang and Donald Brun produced a great number of lithographic posters depicting products created by Basel manufacturers, and whose works were characterised by a rich palette of colours and flawless printing."

In 1875, Martin helped to set up the Auckland Model Training School, which was the first of its kind in Auckland. He was also instrumental in founding the Auckland School Teachers Association in 1873 which aimed to create a national education program and fought for educational reform. After some health concerns, Martin turned his attentions to photography. In 1879, he traveled to London and was introduced to rapid 'instantaneous' photography at the Royal College of Chemistry. Once he returned to New Zealand, he opened a studio in Auckland. Martin became well known for his topographical and ethnological photographs. He often presented these at the Auckland Photographic Club. In 1886, Martin was able to capture the eruption of Mt Tarawera on camera. These photographs were published in the Auckland Evening Star. Martin has also been published in the Auckland Weekly News, New Zealand Illustrated and exhibited photographs at the Pitt Rivers Museum at the University of Oxford. In 1886, he was part of the Colonial and Indian Exhibition and was awarded a gold medal in 1889 for his work in the Exposition Coloniale in Paris. Martin's photographs appeared in the French illustrated press through the photo-agency Chusseau-Flaviens. Martin was an active lecturer, not only on photography matters but he also had an interest in geological and physiological subjects. He was editor of Sharlands New Zealand Photographer and a founding member of the Auckland Society of Arts. Martin served on the Auckland Institute Council from 1881-1892 and was the President of the Council in 1889. After his death in 1916, many of Martin's photographic collections were donated to the Auckland War Memorial Museum."

  "text" : "Jean-Hippolyte Michon (21 November 1806 – 8 May 1881) was a French priest and archaeologist and the founder of graphology. Born in Laroche-près-Feyt, department of Corrèze, he studied in Angoulême and at the seminary in Église Saint-Sulpice, Paris, where in 1830 he was ordained into the priesthood. In the 1830s, he first was introduced to the idea that a person's character could be ascertained via their handwriting from Abbé Flandrin (1804–1864), a priest who taught classes in philosophy. In 1842, he resigned his position as a priest, though still remaining a preacher. He focused his energy towards scientific pursuits, in particular historical and archaeological research, publishing a number of works on the religious history of Charente. In 1844, he published a treatise on Gallo-Roman monuments of Charente titled Statistique Monumentale de la Charente. In 1850 he participated in an archaeological mission to the Middle East as an archaeologist and botanist. In 1860 he published La Rénovation de l'Eglise (On the Renewal of the Church), in which he espoused his progressive thoughts on religion. This work was denounced by the Catholic Church and added to the Index Librorum Prohibitorum. Afterwards (1862–69) he published, under a pseudonym, a series of anti-clerical novels. In 1868 he made the acquaintanceship of chirologist Adolphe Desbarrolles (1801–1886), who along with Michon, had an interest in handwriting analysis. The two men decided to combine efforts towards writing a book on the subject, and despite Michon's opposition to Desbarrolles' occultistic view of handwriting analysis, the work was finally released in 1872 as Les mystères de l'écriture. On 18 November 1871, Michon published the first issue of Le Journal de l'Autographe, a journal in which the term \"graphology\" is first used to describe handwriting analysis. Subsequently he traveled throughout France and to other European cities, giving lectures and promoting his theories of scientific graphology. In the 1870s, he published Système de graphologie (1875), a book introducing Michon's system of handwriting signs, and  Méthode pratique de graphologie (1878), in which he explains the principles of graphological analysis. The standard author abbreviation Michon is used to indicate this individual as the author when citing a botanical name."

Mudholkar was educated at Elphinstone High School, Bombay; Elphinstone College, Bombay; Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge, Lincoln’s Inn, London. He practised at the Bar at Amravati during 1925–1929 and at Nagpur during 1930-1941. He was the son of Rao Bahadur Raghunath Narasinha Mudholkar, a distinguished lawyer and President of the Indian National Congress at the 1912 session in Bankipur. He became District & Sessions Judge during September 1941 – June 1948. He became High Court Judge at Nagpur High Court during June 1948 – October, 1956. He went to the Bombay High Court as Judge during November 1956 – September 1960 and was acting Chief Justice of the Bombay High Court during August – September 1960. He was amongst the first Indian Supreme Court justices to proclaim the notion that later became known as the Basic Structure of the Indian Constitution. In his separate concurring judgment agreeing with the majority to dismiss the petition of Sajjan Singh v. State of Rajasthan, Mudholkar averred, somewhat hesitatingly, that constitution had certain \"basic features\" that cannot be amended by Parliament through its amending powers under Article 368: Before I part with this case I wish to make it clear that what I have said in this judgment is not an expression of my final opinion but only an expression of certain doubts which have assailed me regarding a question of paramount importance to the citizens of our country: to know whether the basic features of the Constitution under which we live and to which we owe allegiance are to endure for all time -or at least for the foreseeable future - or whether the yard no more enduring than the implemental and subordinate provisions of the Constitution. After his retirement, Mudholkar served as a Special Judge inquiring into allegations of corruption against several Orissan politicians, including then Chief Minister R. N. Singhdeo and former Chief Minister Hare Krushna Mahatab. Dr. Mahtab, represented by Siddhartha Shankar Ray, sued to quash Mudholkar's recommendations in the Orissa High Court. In Dr. Harekrushna Mahtab vs The Chief Minister Of Orissa and Others Chief Justice G Mishra ruled against Mahatab, stating in his order, \"...The criticism that the conclusions of Sri Mudholkar were such as could not be reached by any reasonable man is unfounded. ...The State Government fully acted within jurisdiction in getting the alienations verified by Sri Mudholkar, even though earlier it had the satisfaction that there was no prima facie case.\""

  "text" : "John II of Baden (1434 at Hohenbaden Castle in Baden-Baden – 9 February 1503 in Ehrenbreitstein) was a titilar Margrave of Baden and was Archbishop and Elector of Trier as John II of Baden from 1456 until his death in 1503. John II of Baden was the third son of Margrave Jacob I of Baden-Baden and his wife Catherine de Lorraine. John was given a strict religious upbringing, as he was destined from an early age for an ecclesiastical career. At the urging of his father, most of his siblings also followed a religious career, the exceptions being his two oldest brothers Charles I and Bernard II and his sister Margaret. He studied in Erfurt, Pavia and Cologne from 1452 to 1456, together with his younger brothers George and Mark. On 21 June 1456, at the age of 22, he was elected Archbishop of Trier as John II of Baden. His mother was from Lorraine and had connections with Trier. Pope Calixtus III confirmed him as administrator of Trier, because he had not yet reached the minimum age of 35 for consecration as bishop. When he reached that age in 1465, he was consecrated by his suffragan bishop Hubertis Agrippina and the bishops of Metz and Worms. In 1459, Diether von Isenburg was elected Archbishop of Mainz, ahead of Adolph II of Nassau by a narrow margin. However, the Pope did not confirm Dieter's election. This led to the Baden-Palatinate War, in which John II and his brothers participated on the side of Adolph II of Nassau. John II of Baden supported reform in the Benedictine monasteries and encouraged them to join the Bursfelde Congregation. In 1469, he sent Johann Fart, the prior of the St. Mary monastery in Trier to the Maria Laach Abbey, where Johann acted as a reformer abbot. Johann was the 21st abbott, his tenure lasted from 1470 to 1491. By appointing Johann, John II thwarted the intentions of Archbishop Rupert of Cologne, who had a different reform candidate in mind. During John II's reign, the long-anticipated University of Trier was founded on 16 March 1473. The University provided coursed in theology, philosophy, medicine and law. In 1477, he officiated in the wedding of Maximilian of Habsburg and Mary of Burgundy. On 16 January 1500, he appointed his great-nephew Jakob as co-adjutor with the right to succeed (Latin: coadiutor cum iure successionis) and from 1501, Jakob led the government of the Electorate. John II died in 1503 in Ehrenbreitstein (now part of Koblenz), after a tenure of 46 years, 7 months and 18 days, the longest of any bishop of Trier. He was buried in the Cathedral of Trier in a magnificent grave that he had built during his lifetime."

  "text" : "Jimmie Hugh Rogers, Sr. (March 25, 1935 – November 11, 2014) was an American perennial political candidate. He ran for various offices and in 2010 was the Democratic Party nominee for the United States Senate in Oklahoma in a race against incumbent Senator Tom Coburn. Rogers was noted for being highly protective of his privacy. He rarely spoke to the media and repeatedly declined to participate in debates. While revealing that his top priorities as a candidate were to stop the outsourcing of jobs overseas and rein in the national debt, he did not generally make his political positions known. While citing his experience as a professor at several different universities, Rogers often refused to publicly disclose which ones he taught at. He would later disclose that Rogers said he taught at several colleges, including Seminole State College, Connors State College and Langston University. Spokeswomen at all three schools confirmed he had taught there."

Appointed Lecturer in 1924. The greater part of his research was done before he took up academic work. Distinguished for his original work on 'Lycopodium, Tmesipteris, Phylloglossum' and the Hymenphyllaceae (Trans NZ Institute: Annals of Botany); the first to give a complete account of the prothallus and embryogeny of 'Tmesipteris'. The quality of his work, which has made material contributions to morphological botany, is excellent and in the view of the fact that his researches were carried on in very difficult circumstances the quantity is remarkable. \" He died in Timaru, New Zealand on 6 September 1945.

He was born in Lawrence, South Otago, New Zealand on 17 May 1888. He received his education at Lawrence District High School, until age 13 when he left school to support his family. He was first elected onto Christchurch City Council in 1944. He served until 1953, when he unsuccessfully challenged the incumbent mayor, Robert Macfarlane, for the mayoralty. When an incorporated society, Town Hall Promotion Inc., was formed for the promotion of a Christchurch Town Hall, he became its first president. Hay died on 26 March 1971 at his home in Christchurch, and was buried in Waimairi Cemetery. The town hall was opened some 18 months after his death, and the second largest performance space was named the James Hay Theatre in his honour. His son, Hamish Hay, was later the Christchurch mayor for 15 years."

The suit, Ahlquist v. Cranston, was filed with the assistance of the American Civil Liberties Union, and was ultimately decided in Ahlquist's favor. During the lawsuit, Ahlquist received hate mail and was verbally attacked by her peers, media outlets, and online. She received death threats, and required police escorts to and from classes. On the day following the ruling, Rhode Island State Representative Peter G. Palumbo spoke on a local radio show and referred to Ahlquist as \"an evil little thing\". Since the lawsuit, Ahlquist has received a variety of media attention, and she has been an invited speaker at a number of events, including the Reason Rally, the Texas Freethought Convention and Skepticon 5. Two high school students from other states have described their objections to school prayer as inspired by her activism. She has received a number of awards, including the 2011 Thomas Jefferson Youth Activist and the American Humanist Association's 2012 Humanist Pioneer Award."

  "text" : "Jan V. White was a designer, communication design consultant, and graphic design educator and writer. Czech by birth, he was educated in England at Leighton Park School and holds degrees in architecture from Cornell University and Columbia University School of Architecture, Planning and Preservation. From 1951 to 1964 he worked on two of TIME's architectural magazines: Architectural Forum (1951–56) as associate art director, and House & Home (1956-1964) as art director. Since 1964 he has worked as a consultant, writer and teacher. He redesigned more than 200 periodical publications on four continents, and influenced many more with his books and articles about design for print. Initially focused on periodical design, in the mid-1980s White brought his analysis of the visual rhetoric of structure, white space and typographic hierarchy to bear on corporate publishing in a way that shared common ground with information design. As an educator 'his most valued contribution for people trying to learn how to design has been his articulation, in very clear and easy-to-follow language, what publication design is about; and his insistence that it is not a mystery, but a rational activity of manipulating the elements of a publication in order to achieve certain defined communication outcomes.' 'White was an early proponent of the idea of design as being more than \"good looks\".' In 2012, he dedicated several of his design books to the public domain. He was the son of the illustrator and architect Emil Weiss, and the father of the designer, writer and educator Alex W White. He is survived by his four sons and seven grandchildren."

He was born in Randalstown, County Antrim, Ireland on 28 May 1880. He was educated at Wellington College and spent a year at the University of Otago Medical School. His father sent him to the University of Edinburgh to complete his medical course. As a senior student he served with the medical corps in the South African War from 1899–1902. Graduating MB, ChB in 1902, Elliott returned to New Zealand the following year and was the first house surgeon at Wellington District Hospital. He then began a surgical and general practice at the hospital, serving also as honorary surgeon. On 12 December 1905, at Wellington, he was married by his father to Annie Allan Forbes from Edinburgh; they were going to have five children. In 1912 Elliott took the Edinburgh MD degree.

Christie amassed a fortune through the indigo trade with India and invested it in the purchase of much of Fforest Fawr in what is now the Brecon Beacons National Park in southern Powys. He constructed a network of tramroads between Sennybridge and the upper Swansea Valley, initially with a view to supplying the model farms which he had established with agricultural lime. Connections to coal mines further south were established and to sources of rottenstone and silica sand but these ventures bankrupted him by 1827-28."

  "text" : "Joseph Maina Mungai (born in Kenya, 1932; died August 2003) was the first African to become Dean of the School of Medicine at the University of Nairobi. Besides a medical journal editor position from which he resigned in 1974, and a long-term stint as a newspaper correspondent, he was also Head and faculty member of the Department of Anatomy, a writer, and to an extent limited by other career demands, engaged in medical practice. Additionally, from the late 1960s until his retirement, he remained active in the Kenyan civil service. Having been one of the earliest Africans to engage in scientific research work, activity begun with neurologic research while studying for his doctorate in London, UK, and continued along with production of scientific research papers well into the 1980s, he has also been described as a pioneer medical researcher in East Africa. That his interest in scientific research extended beyond laboratory walls has been exhibited. An example is when he was acknowledged for having suggested to Derek J. Chadwick of CIBA Foundation that the foundation's Symposium on the Molecular Biology and Pathology of Elastic Tissues be held in Nairobi. Mungai, with colleagues J. K. Kimani and A. H. Walji had, about seven years earlier completed a research paper on subject matter which tied in with the symposium's main themes: elastin fibre content in a primate species. His idea for Nairobi as a venue was backed by Bob Mecham of Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri, and by Leslie Robert of France. Further co-ordination of the event was provided by Davy Koech and Ms. Shah of KEMRI (Kenya Medical Research Institute); and Mungai's colleague James K. Kimani of the University of Nairobi's Department of Anatomy who was, until his death on 14 September 2006, a researcher in anatomy, neurology, pathology, histology, elastins and bioelasticity of biological tissues and structures (1977–1997); lecturer and professor, as well as Secretary-General of SONA (Society of Neuroscientists in Africa), an organisation associated with PAAN (Pan African Association of Neurological Sciences). The event, CIBA's 192nd symposium, was held 1–3 November 1994, at the Windsor Golf and Country Club in Nairobi."

  "text" : "Jacobus Barnaart (6 October 1726 in Haarlem - 2 November 1780 in Haarlem) was a Dutch merchant and one of the five first directors of the Teylers Stichting. Barnaart, son of Jacobus Barnaart and Margaretha van Elten, was born in a relatively rich Baptist family. His father was a merchant, silk cloth manufacturer, and regent of the local orphanage. He could afford to send his son to the Latin school (1738) and the Academy (1744). Following in the footsteps of his father, the younger Barnaart became a merchant, but also showed an interest in astronomical measurements. In 1756 he was appointed as future director of the Teylers Stichting, which was finally founded at the death of Pieter Teyler van der Hulst in 1778. After founding the Stichting (Foundation) he became one of the five directors responsible for the Teylers Museum and the Teylers societies. Barnaart's interest in astronomy led to his setting up an astronomical observatory on top of the Oval Room, although he was advised by Martinus van Marum that this would not be a practical place due to vibrations, which could lead to inexact measurements. The Teylers astronomical observatory was constructed on top of the Oval Room, but in a smaller version than initially planned. Diaries of Barnaart have been preserved, describing his experiences from age 11 onward, which includes some of his astronomical observations."

  "text" : "James Elliot Cabot (June 18, 1821 – January 16, 1903) was an American philosopher and author, born in Boston to Samuel Cabot, Jr., and Eliza Cabot. James (known by his family and friends as \"Elliot\") had six brothers: Thomas Handasyd Cabot (b. 1814), Samuel Cabot III (b. 1815), Edward Clarke Cabot (b. 1818), Stephen Cabot (b. 1826), Walter Channing Cabot (b. 1829), and Louis Cabot (b. 1837). Having received his bachelor's degree from Harvard Law School in 1845, Elliot started a law firm. He taught philosophy at Harvard and was a transcendentalist and edited the Massachusetts Quarterly Review, beginning in 1848. Cabot argued that we do not experience space directly, that space is \"a system of relations, it cannot be given in any one sensation. [...] Space is a symbol of the general relatedness of objects constructed by thought from data which lie below consciousness.\" Cabot was of the opinion that the position of something in space was not felt at all, but deduced from perceived relations. Cabot was a correspondent of Henry David Thoreau. His biography of Ralph Waldo Emerson was criticized for its lack of colour. Cabot and his wife Elizabeth had five sons, the most notable of them being Richard Clarke Cabot (1868–1939), a physician who advanced clinical hematology, was an innovator in teaching methods, and a pioneer in social work."

He is remembered because of his extensive diary. Cox was the son of a prosperous small farmer. He became a clerical assistant for the Great Western Railway Company. When in 1880 his mother sold the family farm (Cox was then 34, single, and living with his mother), he emigrated from England to New Zealand, living in Christchurch, New Zealand until 1888 and thereafter in the North Island, where he worked in a flax mill. The mill closed in 1890 and thereafter Cox lived a hand-to-mouth existence, a hard life of vagrancy, intermittent and arduous labour, and poverty. He was buried in an unmarked grave, but a headstone was placed for him at Greytown Cemetery in 2013. After 1888, he kept a very detailed diary, the surviving portion being about 800,000 words. The diary offers a unique and valuable account of New Zealand working class life of the period. Miles Fairburn wrote a 1995 book, Nearly Out of Heart and Hope, based on Cox's diaries. Cox's dairies were featured in the 2013 exhibition \"Logs to blogs\" at the Alexander Turnbull Library in Wellington. Cox was the cousin of nature writer Richard Jefferies; as teens, Cox and Jefferies set off on an unsuccessful adventure, first planning to walk to Moscow and, this having failed, to sail to America, which also proved impossible."

Although an American, Ackermann is considered a major voice in the Australian suffrage movement. As well as being the author of three books, Ackermann gave talks on travel and temperance around the world and became a skilled and popular speaker with a wide following.She was described as a \"speaker of no mean order\". In her talks, she advocated equal political, legal and property rights for women. Ackermann was actively involved in campaigns for women's rights as well as the ongoing international struggle against opium and also tobacco. She became World's superintendent of the WCTU's anti-opium department in 1893-95 and in 1891 established an Anti Narcotics Department of the WCTU in Australia. In 1906 she was made a fellow of the Royal Scottish Geographical Society, one of the few women to be able to put these letters after her name."

  "text" : "James Thomas Burrows CBE  (13 July 1904 – 10 June 1991) was a New Zealand teacher, sportsman, administrator, and military leader. He was born in Prebbleton, New Zealand, on 13 July 1904. Following his education at Christchurch Boys' High School, he became a teacher. As a rugby union player, Burrows was a hooker. He represented Canterbury in 1923 and from 1925 to 1930. He was a member of the New Zealand national side, the All Blacks, on their first ever tour of South Africa in 1928. On that tour he played in nine matches and scored two tries, but he did not appear in any of the Tests. He was sole selector and coach of the Canterbury team from 1932 to 1933, and manager–coach for the All Blacks in their 1937 test series against South Africa. He also played nine first-class matches for the Canterbury cricket team in the Plunket Shield. A Territorial Force officer, Burrows volunteered for overseas service during the Second World War. Serving in Greece, Crete, North Africa and Italy, he rose to the rank of brigadier. Leaving the army in 1944, he became rector of Waitaki Boys' High School. He resigned this position in 1949 and rejoined the Army, serving as commander of the New Zealand force in Korea in 1953."

In 1851 he emigrated to New Zealand and in 1859 was appointed provincial engineer at Nelson, New Zealand. In 1870 he was advanced to the position of Acting Engineer-in-chief for New Zealand, becoming also Marine Engineer in the following year. In 1878 he was made Engineer-in-charge of the North Island, and in 1884 Engineer-in-chief of the colony. Blackett then became Consulting Engineer of the Government of New Zealand in London. He was responsible for the location, design and construction of 14 lighthouses around the New Zealand coastline. From April to June 1867, Blackett was appointed onto the Executive of the Nelson Provincial Council. There were attempts to persuade Blackett to stand for election as Superintendent, but he did not consent. Blackett died in Wellington in 1893, and was buried at Karori Cemetery. The John Blackett Prize was established under the will of his daughter, Isobel Mary Houston, and is awarded to outstanding engineering students at the University of Canterbury."

  "text" : "John Holland Baker (4 December 1841 – 5 February 1930) was a New Zealand surveyor and public servant. He was born in Chilcomb, Hampshire, England on 4 December 1841. A son of the Rev. Thomas Feilding Baker, Rector of Cressingham Parish, Norfolk, he was educated at Yarmouth Grammar School, and in Germany, where he lived with his parents in Königswinter. He left school at 15 after he punched a master. He was sent to New Zealand when his uncle, Octavius Mathias, offered to take one of the Baker sons. He arrived in Lyttelton on the Maori during 1857. In the following year, he started an apprenticeship as a surveyor, with another uncle, John Baker, paying the £200 for the three-year education. He bought land in December 1858, and a house during 1860. On one of his trips to the back-country, he found 15,000 acres (6,100 ha) of unclaimed land suitable for sheep farming. He was granted a lease in 1860, which he could sell for £300. He became a land speculator but, unlike others, he never got rich from it. Baker explored the Southern Alps with Samuel Butler for further sheep country; they found what was later known as Whitcombe Pass but no suitable land. In 1861, Baker was the first European to cross the Haast Pass. The Otago Gold Rush attracted Baker south, and he spent six months prospecting at the Tuapeka River. This was unsuccessful, and he went to Invercargill in May 1862. There, Theophilus Heale engaged him as a sub-assistant surveyor. In 1863 he was appointed assistant surveyor to carry out the Southland triangulation. In 1864 he was promoted to the post of Deputy Chief Surveyor, and later on in the same year when Heale resigned he became Chief Surveyor, and a member of the Southland Waste Lands Board. Baker then became Inspector of Surveys for Southland, and in the following year he assisted James McKerrow in connecting Stewart Island with the geodesical survey of Otago. While in Southland, Baker arranged the exhibits for the Otago and Melbourne exhibitions. On 10 December 1875, he married Isabel Strachey (20 February 1845 – 1920), a daughter of Richard Strachey of Ashwick Grove, Somerset, the third son of Sir Henry Strachey, 1st Baronet. Her mother, Anne Marie (or Anna Maria), was a daughter of Alexander Powell MP, a Tory member of parliament for Downton, Wiltshire. Baker's daughter was Noeline Baker, suffrage campaigner."

  "text" : "Jackie Ferrara (born November 17, 1929, in Detroit, Michigan) is an American sculptor and draughtswoman best known for her pyramidal stacked structures. Her work is in the collection of the MOMA, the LACMA, the Louisiana Museum of Modern Art, and the Phillips Collection, among others. Ferrara studied at Michigan State University for 6 months in 1950, but had little formal arts education. She moved to New York in 1952 and became involved in the city's burgeoning art scene, as well as theatre and dance through a stint working for the Henry Street Playhouse. In the sixties she was involved with performances and happenings at the Judson Church, performing in two of Claes Oldenburg's happenings, which she was particularly influenced by. During this time she began sculpting, developing a unique style by the seventies. Characteristics of her work include wooden pyramid or ziggurat structures with accompanying horizontally stacked steps, \"meticulous craftmanship, [...] reference to generic types of non-Western building, such as those of Mesoamerica and Egypt, and to geometric form.\" One of her earliest mature works was 1974's Hollow Core Pyramid. Other well-known works of the period include Curved Pyramid and Stacked Pyramid (both 1973). In the 1980s, Ferarra began working on a smaller scale, producing plywood works she called \"wallyards\" or \"courtyards\" that looked like models rather than finished sculptures. She ultimately added complexity to these works by combining multiple kinds of wood in a single work and experimenting with different stains. Another series of small works, which Ferrara referred to as \"places,\" grew out of these works. Many look like small-scale models of temples."

Dale umpired 1,987 major league games in his 16 year career. He umpired in one World Series (1977), two All-Star Games (1972 and 1980, three National League Championship Series (1973, 1976 and 1979), and the 1981 National League Division Series. On April 25, 1985, Dale was released from the National League due to a knee injury. In May of that year, Dale filed a federal suit against the Major League Umpires Association, targeting Richie Phillips, the union's legal counsel and negotiator. Dale alleged that Phillips failed to respond to numerous attempts to acquire the union's legal and financial data. The suit also challenged the legality of a $120,000 assessment taken from the umpires after the 1984 World Series, with Dale claiming that the umpires had not given consent. Dale also appealed his dismissal from the NL in 1986, and won a disability settlement. After his umpiring career ended, Dale became an adjunct professor of business and social science at Maryville College, Tennessee, as well as an African safari tour guide"

Works from this period retain minimalism's geometry but eschew its use of industrial materials and methods in favor of materials such as wood and hemp. Winsor has been in several exhibitions. In 1979, a mid-career retrospective of her work opened at the MoMA; this was the first time the MoMA had presented a retrospective of work by a woman artist since 1946. Other exhibitions include \"American Woman Artist Show\" April 14 – May 14, 1974 at the Kunsthaus Hamburg (Germany), curated by Sybille Niester and Lil Picard, and \"26 Contemporary Women Artists\" April 18 – June 13, 1971 at the Aldrich Museum of Contemporary Art, curated by Lucy Lippard"

  "text" : "Jenny Diver, née Mary Young (1700 – 18 March 1741) was a notorious British pickpocket, one of the most famous of her day. Born around 1700 in Ireland, Diver was the illegitimate daughter of an unknown father and the lady's maid Harriet Jones, who deserted her, and grew up in various foster homes. She was a skilled seamstress, and eventually emigrated to London, where she became an apprentice of Anne Murphy, who was the leader of a gang of pickpockets. She soon became so skilled as a thief that she became the leader of Murphy's gang and nicknamed Jenny Diver. Jenny Diver was described as attractive, educated and well dressed, and was able to mix among wealthy people without attracting suspicion. The perhaps most known of her methods was to feign illness, during which she robbed people and handed over the objects to her accomplices, and the use of false arms, which made it possible for her rob people with her arms seemingly visible in her lap. On two occasions, in 1733 and 1738, Diver was arrested, gave the court a false name with no criminal record, and was convicted to deportation as a first-time criminal. On both occasions, she bribed the captain on the prison ship to allow her a comfortable travel with her property, bribed the governor in Virginia to relieve her of her sentence, and bribed the captain to take her back to London again. On 10 January 1741, she was arrested for the third time, but this time she was correctly identified and could not give a false name to appear a first-time criminal. She was apprehended with one accomplice, Elizabeth Davies, while trying to steal the purse from the pocket of a woman whom a male accomplice offered to help over a pool of water (the man managed to escape). Jenny Diver defended both herself and Davies by character witnesses. She was accused not only of theft but also of having returned after deportation, which was a capital crime. Both were sentenced to death, claimed without success to be pregnant, but while Davies was deported, Diver's sentence was not commuted. Due to her notoriety as a famous criminal, she was taken to her execution in a mourning carriage. She was executed with 19 other condemned, but she was the only one taken there separately. She was dressed in a black dress and hat with veil, and reportedly behaved with composure."

His film restoration company, headquartered in Burbank, California, had been credited with restoring, preserving, and, in many cases, saving early Hollywood films which may have otherwise deteriorated beyond retrieval. Lowry developed his own techniques and technology, called the Lowry Process, which, as defined by the Los Angeles Times reduces \"visual \"noise\" in motion pictures\" which then makes it possible to undertake other forms of restoration, such as removing dirt and scratches, reducing flicker. and sharpening the quality of existing images. Lowry used his process to restore and preserve more than five hundred classic films, including Singin' in the Rain, Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope, Casablanca, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, Raiders of the Lost Ark, Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, Bambi, Sunset Boulevard, and the James Bond film franchise."

In 1847, he obtained his medical doctorate from the University of Vienna, later practicing medicine in Wien-Leopoldstadt. Along with his brother Josef Natterer (1819-1862), he is remembered for pioneer experiments in the field of photography. In 1841, using a Voigtländer camera on daguerreotype plates that were prepared according to a chemical process developed by Franz Kratochwila, they were able to increase the sensitivity five-fold, and reportedly achieved exposure times as low as 5 to 6 seconds in clear weather. In the mid-1840s, using a compressed air chamber pump invented by J. Schembor (1777-1851), he was the first scientist to produce liquid carbonic acid in significant quantities. His name is associated with a sealed and constant volume vessel known as a \"Natterer's tube\"."

In his infancy, John, his older sister Ingeborg and his mother fled Austria for the United States to join Gustaf who had preceded them and established a medical practice in Oklahoma, where they settled for several years. The family then moved to Stamford, Connecticut. Both parents practiced psychiatry, Gustaf in a private sanitarium in Stamford and Jolan as a child psychiatrist in New York City and Connecticut. Blass' most prominent professional achievements are in the area of aging and Alzheimer's disease, in particular relating to brain metabolism. He holds patents based on decades of scientific research, including a neutraceutical \"metabolic enhancer\" which has been under study in a large-scale, controlled, \"multicenter\" clinical trial. Preliminary results have led to its being made available commercially. He has written and contributed to a number of books, both professionally (assorted volumes on Alzheimer's disease and a textbook on pharmacology) and for pleasure. Currently he is developing a work on the historical statements of Jesus from a Jewish perspective. His personal interests include cooking, gardening and soil composition, history, news and politics, and ancient texts, particularly Roman and Jewish. His immediate family are his wife Birgit (Gitte) Blass, son Charles Blass and daughter Louise Blass. Charles and his wife Agnes Blass have two daughters, Isabel Blass and Claire Blass."

  "text" : "Joe Crowther (born 1913) was an English motorcycle speedway rider who had his greatest success in the period immediately after World War II. Crowther was born in Stanley, County Durham and after early ambitions of becoming a jockey, initially pursued a career as a footballer with Crook Town. His jobs before taking up speedway included a comedian in a travelling opera company and working for his father's butchery business. After first seeing speedway at Middlesbrough in 1937, where he was inspired by Frank Hodgson, he rode in grasstrack and junior speedway events at Newcastle, going on to ride for West Ham, Newcastle and Glasgow before the outbreak of war in 1939. He returned to Glasgow after the war, progressing to become the team's second highest points scorer in the 1947 season. He continued his good form in 1948, scoring 440 points. He stayed with Glasgow until 1951, at which point he was the team captain, when he requested a transfer to Motherwell Eagles, going on to ride for Motherwell for a few seasons before retiring. After retiring from racing he became team manager of the Leicester Hunters, also looking after the track at Leicester Stadium."

The fifth son of dissenting minister John Blackadder, he was a devout Calvinist, and joined the Cameronians – a predominantly religious regiment – as a volunteer cadet when they were raised in 1689 to fight for King William III. He soldiered with the regiment through the campaign in Flanders, where he was court-martialled and later pardoned for killing an officer in a duel, and then during the War of the Spanish Succession. He was wounded at the Battle of Blenheim, and twice wounded at the siege of Lille; after the Battle of Malplaquet he was promoted to lieutenant-colonel, and took command of the regiment. He resigned his commission two years later, and retired to Edinburgh. In later life he focused his work on ecclesiastical matters, becoming a member of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland. During the First Jacobite Rising in 1715 he was appointed colonel of a regiment raised in Glasgow to guard the city, and after the war made deputy-governor of Stirling Castle."

  "text" : "Sir John Russell Reynolds, 1st Baronet (22 May 1828 – 29 May 1896) was a British neurologist and physician. Reynolds was born in Romsey, Hampshire, as son of John Reynolds, an independent minister, and grandson of Dr. Henry Revell Reynolds. He received general education from his father, and was educated in his profession at University College, London, where he obtained three gold medals in the medical school. In 1851 he graduated M.B. in the university of London, and obtained a scholarship and gold medal in medicine. In 1852 he took the degree of M.D., and began practice in Leeds. He soon after moved to London, and took a house, 38 Grosvenor Street, in which Dr. Marshall Hall had lived. Hall announced to his patients in a printed circular that Reynolds had succeeded him in practice. Such procedure was contrary to a recognised understanding among physicians, and Hall incurred the censure of the College of Physicians. Reynolds, who was ignorant of Hall's intention, was in no way responsible for the circular, and was in no way involved in the censure. He was duly elected a fellow of the college in 1859. In the same year he was appointed assistant physician to University College Hospital, to which he continued attached throughout life. He had before been, in 1855, assistant physician to the Hospital for Sick Children, and in 1857 assistant physician to the Westminster Hospital. In 1865 he became professor of the principles and practice of medicine at University College, and in 1878 he was appointed physician-in-ordinary to the queen's household. He gained a considerable practice as a physician, and was often consulted in difficult cases of nervous disease. In 1869 he was elected a fellow of the Royal Society, and in 1883 vice-president of the Royal Medical and Chirurgical Society. He delivered the Lumleian lecture at the College of Physicians in 1867, the Harveian oration in 1884, and was elected president in 1893, on the death of Sir Andrew Clark. He was re-elected in 1894 and 1895, and on 1 January in the latter year was created a baronet. In the winter of 1895–6 he became too ill to offer himself for re-election as president of the College of Physicians. He died at his house in Grosvenor Street, London, after several weeks of illness of a pulmonary congestion, on 29 May 1896. He was married, first, to Miss Ainslie, and, secondly, to Frances, widow of C. J. C. Crespigny, but left no children. The Reynolds Baronetcy, of Grosvenor Street, was created in the Baronetage of the United Kingdom on 28 February 1895 for John Russell Reynolds. The title became extinct on his death. Reynolds devoted himself from an early period to the study of nervous diseases, and in 1854 published an Essay on Vertigo; in 1855 Diagnosis of Diseases of the Brain, Spinal Cord, and Nerves, as well as Tables for the Diagnosis of Diseases of the Brain; in 1861 a treatise on epilepsy; in 1871 Lectures on the Clinical Uses of Electricity; in 1872 The Scientific Value of the Legal Tests of Insanity; besides many papers in medical periodicals and the transactions of medical societies, and several addresses to medical associations. His writings on nervous diseases were useful contributions to a department of medicine in which much work remained undone, but in the flood of modern observations they have been submerged. He will chiefly be remembered among physicians as the editor of the System of Medicine, in five volumes, published from 1866 to 1879, a collection of essays on diseases, written by the most competent men who could be induced to write—compositions of varying merit, but generally of high value. He himself wrote the parts on erysipelas, on inflammation of the lymphatics, and on several forms of nervous disease. He published in 1893 a Life of Dr. Walter Hayle Walshe. Reynolds was a tall man, with dark hair, with a dignified delivery and some oratorical power. Reynolds died in London."

  "text" : "Janice Elva MacDonald (born 1959 in Banff, Alberta) is a Canadian writer of literary and mystery novels, textbooks, non-fiction, and stories for both adults and children. She is best known as the creator of a series of comic academic mystery novels featuring reluctant amateur sleuth Miranda \"Randy\" Craig, all of which are set in Edmonton, Alberta. The latest of these, Another Margaret: A Randy Craig Mystery, released in September 2015, takes Miranda to a reunion of her fellow graduate school students and resurrects a mystery involving a Canadian literary figure who has been long-believed dead. The Roar of the Crowd: A Randy Craig Mystery was released on July 10, 2014, with a plot involving the Edmonton theatre scene, including the Freewill Shakespeare Festival and the Edmonton International Fringe Theatre Festival. The Roar of the Crowd quickly became the #1 fiction book in Edmonton, making it the third consecutive bestseller for the author, and it went on to be nominated for the David Award for Best Mystery Novel at the 2015 Deadly Ink Conference and featured as a recommended read in both the 2015 Edmonton Travel Guide and the 2015 Avenue Magazine Summer Reading Guide. Condemned to Repeat: A Randy Craig Mystery, was published on June 15, 2013, and involves a series of deadly events connected to Alberta historic sites, including Rutherford House, Fort Edmonton Park, and the Ukrainian Cultural Heritage Village; it debuted in the top spot on the Edmonton Journal's bestseller list on June 21, 2013 and went on to be shortlisted for the Mary Scorer Award for Best Book by a Manitoba Publisher at the 2013 Manitoba Book Awards as well as the David Award for Best Mystery Novel at the 2014 Deadly Ink Conference. Hang Down Your Head: A Randy Craig Mystery, was published in November 2011 and features \"cameo\" appearances by several real-life folk musicians, as well as a corpse discovered at the Edmonton Folk Music Festival. The book was a hit in MacDonald's home city and spent more than six months on the Edmonton Journal's Top 10 list. The book and its author were profiled on CBC Radio, CityTV's Breakfast Television show, in the Edmonton Journal, and in the Edmonton Examiner. A January 2012 cover story in Edmonton Woman Magazine and a half-hour interview on the CKUA Radio Network's ArtBeat program, looked more extensively at the entire mystery series. While pursuing her own writing career, MacDonald has also served in a variety of leadership and mentorship roles for other writers from Alberta and across Canada. She was a member of the executive board for the Writers’ Guild of Alberta (WGA) from 1989-1990 and President of the WordWorks Society of Alberta from 1996-1997. MacDonald’s longtime service with the Canadian Authors Association (CAA) at the provincial and national levels included a stint as President of the Alberta Branch from 1993-1996, during which time she co-chaired two national conferences and created/developed the Exporting Alberta Award, which is still awarded annually. At the national level, MacDonald served as the CAA’s National Vice President for Awards from 1995-1997 and as the CAA Fiction Award Manager from 1995-2005. She continues to mentor writers by teaching at workshops, conferences, Blue Pencil events with the WGA, and writing camps such as YouthWrite and its spin-off for adults, JustWrite."

In 1892 he became a hospital interne, and during the following year began taking courses in microbiology at the Pasteur Institute in Paris. From 1896 to 1900 he served as préparateur in Amédée Borrel's microbiology laboratory. In 1899 he obtained his medical doctorate with a thesis titled Étude expérimentale sur le tétanos (Experimental study on tetanus). From 1900 to 1909 he was laboratory chief at the Pasteur Institute. Beginning in 1898 Binot took over 15,000 photographs of places he visited during his scientific journeys in Europe and Africa. In 1901 he traveled to Réunion and Madagascar. In Réunion he photographed a total eclipse of the Sun, and experienced a plague epidemic affecting the islands' cattle. In 1900 he undertook research of microflora of the Mont Blanc massif, staying at the laboratory of astronomer Jules Janssen (1824-1907), who had an observatory on Mont Blanc. During his career, he amassed a large and varied collection of microorganisms for research purposes."

  "text" : "Jane Brotherton Walker (31 January 1925 – 3 April 2009) was a leading 20th century expert in the field of tick taxonomy, particularly in Africa. Born on January 31, 1925 in Nairobi, Kenya, Walker grew up on a farm and was home-schooled by her mother during her primary school years. She completed her secondary education in England where she graduated from the Retford High School for Girls in 1944. During her time in England, she contracted poliomyelitis, the sequelae of which would progressively affect her ability to walk, particularly during her senior years. She earned her Bachelor of Science (with Honours) degree in 1948 and her Master of Science degrees in 1959, both at Liverpool University. In 1983, she was awarded a Doctor of Science (Hon.) degree by the University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, South Africa. Dr. Walker was first employed in 1949 in the Research Branch of Her Majesty’s Overseas Civil Service as a Research Officer in the East African Veterinary Research Organization in Muguga, Kenya, where she rose to Principal Scientific Officer before taking up a post as Senior Professional Officer at the Veterinary Research Institute, Onderstepoort, in 1966 upon the retirement of Dr. Gertrud Theiler. She spent the remainder of her working life at the Institute, rising through the ranks to Chief Veterinary Researcher, and serving as Specialist Scientist until failing health forced her retirement in 1990. After her formal retirement, she continued to work when able at Onderstepoort in an emeritus capacity until 1998.

A right-handed middle-order batsman, John Siedle's first-class career began with an innings of 127 for Western Province against Eastern Province on New Year's Day 1956. Though he had limited success after that, he retained his place in the Western Province side for the rest of the 1955–56 season. But there was only a single game in 1956–57 and the following year he turned out for Natal in two first-class matches. In the second of these, his final game, he opened the innings and scored 81 against Orange Free State."

  "text" : "Josh Linkner (born Joshua M. Linkner, July 28, 1970) is an entrepreneur, keynote speaker, and author. He founded several companies including ePrize, an interactive promotion agency, where he served as CEO and Executive Chairman. Writing for The Wall Street Journal, Gwendolyn Bounds noted that ePrize is targeted at small businesses that don't have the resources to do this type of marketing themselves but cautioned that the service is not of the pay-per-sale type. Since 2010 Linkner has served as CEO and Managing Partner of Detroit Venture Partners, a venture capital firm helping to rebuild urban areas through technology and entrepreneurship. Detroit Venture Partners' portfolio includes DJ app Rockbot, mobile app developer Detroit Labs, and CAPTCHA replacement company Are You a Human. General partners of Detroit Venture Partners include Earvin \"Magic\" Johnson Jr. On November 4, 2014 Linkner announced he will step down as CEO to focus on a speaker and author career. Linkner has published three books, the first Leaning Forward: Surviving/Winning in the Future of Interactive Marketing in 2007, a New York Times best-seller Disciplined Dreaming: A Proven System to Drive Breakthrough Creativity in 2011 and in 2014 \"The Road to Reinvention\" . In the latter book he states that the original thought and imagination of jazz performance (in his particular case, playing guitar with his jazz ensemble Guymon Ensley Quintet) are transferable skills for creating value in the business world.  GetAbstract said the book provides \"a clear, methodical guide to developing creativity\". His third book, The Road to Reinvention: How to Drive Disruption and Accelerate Transformation, was published May 7, 2014. He is a regular writer for Fast Company, Inc. Magazine, and Forbes. Linkner was one of the speakers at TEDx Detroit in September 2011. On August 18, 2011, U.S. President Barack Obama gave Linkner a Champion of Change award in the youth entrepreneur category. He won an Ernst & Young Entrepreneur Of The Year award in the Realizing Business Potential category for Central Great Lakes Region in 2004. Linkner studied jazz guitar at Berklee College of Music, was an Advertising major as an undergraduate at University of Florida, and holds honorary doctorate degrees from Lawrence Technological University and Walsh College.He is also Entrepreneur-In-Residence and Adjunct Professor of Applied Creativity at the University of Michigan-Dearborn. On August 30, 2013, Linkner wrote a column for the Detroit Free Press suggesting that Labor Day be retired, repurposed, and renamed Appreciation Day, Passion Day, Kindness Day, or Give Back Day. In an interview with Vanna Le of Forbes magazine, he stated he was optimistic about growth in high technology and innovation in general, with the exception of social media. In a 2014 article in the New Yorker magazine, Harvard historian Jill Lepore criticized the theory of disruptive innovation as \"a theory of change founded on panic, anxiety, and shaky evidence\". Lepore postulates that Linkner advises the aspiring disruptive innovators (in which he invests) that \"the world is a terrifying place, moving at a devastating pace\". She suggests that Linkner's \"job appears to be to convince a generation of people who want to do good and do well to learn, instead, remorselessness. Forget rules, obligations, your conscience, loyalty, a sense of the commonweal.\""

  "text" : "James \"Jim\" Dickson (January 17, 1931 - April 19, 2011) was born in Los Angeles, California, son of a diesel engineer in the United States Navy. He was an avid sailor as a teenager, and enlisted in the United States Army in 1946 before he embarked on a career in the recording industry as a self-taught record producer and band manager.Before producing the first Elektra Records Bluegrass records he produced his first record, an LP on his own label, Vaya. He eventually sold the rights of Lord Buckley's 1955 album Hipsters, Flipsters and Finger Poppin' Daddies, Knock Me Your Lobes to Elektra and it was in print for another 25 years. Jim Dickson was the lone individual behind Elektra Records Los Angeles Bluegrass albums. In 1962 he produced his first bluegrass record for Elektra called Dian and the Greenbriar Boys by the Greenbriar Boys and a Hollywood country singer, Dian James.While working on the collaboration between Greenbriar Boys and Dian James, Dickson discovered the Dillards and with the help of Ralph Rinzler convinced Elektra Records that they were a good Bluegrass group. He went on to produce three of their records, 1963's Back Porch Bluegrass, 1964's Live!!!! Almost!!! and 1965's Pickin' and Fiddlin' which featured fiddler, Byron Berline. Rosenberg notes that Pickin' and Fiddlin' \"was unlike any previous bluegrass album; it was an LP of old-time fiddle music played to bluegrass backing.\" Dickson was behind was the first ever recording of a Bob Dylan song by a bluegrass band, The Dillards recording of Bob Dylan's \"Walkin' Down the Line\" on their 1964 album Live!!!! Almost!!! In addition to these three records he produced for the Dillards, Dickson, now working as an independent producer, produced two best-selling instrumental albums: 12 String Guitar! and 12 String Guitar! Vol. 2. These records featured Glen Campbell on the twelve string guitar along with the Dillards as the backing band to make up the Folkswingers. These records included traditionals as well as songs written by Woody Guthrie, Pete Seeger, Ma Rainey, Lead Belly, Merle Travis, A.P. Carter, and Bob Dylan. Dickson was very adamant about the recording of Dylan tunes. According to Neil Rosenberg Dickson was instrumental in bridging the gaps between folk, country, and bluegrass music. Rosenberg also notes that Dickson played an important role in the synthesis of folk and rock music. This began with his discovery of the Hillmen. He recorded and produced their only album, The Hillmen, in a three-month period at the end of 1963 and beginning of 1964. It was not officially released by Elektra Records until 1969. Chris Hillman would later go on to help form The Byrds, with whom Dickson worked closely as a manager. Dickson persuaded them to record Bob Dylan's \"Mr. Tambourine Man\" which reached number 1 on both the Billboard Hot 100 chart and the UK Singles Chart, as well as becoming the title track of their first album, Mr. Tambourine Man. Jim Dickson would also go on to co-produce two albums by The Flying Burrito Brothers, 1970's Burrito Deluxe and 1971's The Flying Burrito Bros; both records feature Bob Dylan songs."

  "text" : "Jeroen Robert Kramer (born 1967 in Amsterdam) is a Dutch contemporary photographer.He started his career as a free lance photographer for the Dutch quality daily De Volkskrant which sent him to Iraq to cover the invasion in 2003. Since then he has worked extensively in the Middle east. He is most famous for his work for magazines and newspapers such as the New York Times, Vanity Fair and Der Spiegel that has taken him to many conflict zones in the past decade, including Afghanistan, Kenya, Lebanon, Iraq, the Philippines and Pakistan. In 2008 Kramer decided he no longer wanted to work as a documentary photographer. This led to the publication of his book Room 103 in which he mixes ordinary life in the Middle east with images of violence. In his opinion his earlier work focused too much on violence and thereby created a distorted view of the world. With Room 103, he gives an intimate view of life in the Middle east. The book was awarded the top Dutch documentary award, The Dutch Doc award and the New York Photo festival book award."

Guibord was acknowledged as one of the best typographers in Canada; he is thought to have introduced stereotype printing to Canada; and he printed a catechism in an Indian language at the request of André-Marie Garin, a missionary in the northwest. However, Guibord's notability is based on events after his death: as a member of the Institut Canadien de Montréal, he was denied ecclessiastical burial by the Roman Catholic Church in the Montréal cemetery of Notre-Dame-des-Neiges. His widow, Henriette Brown, challenged the refusal in the courts, and for five years his body lay in temporary accommodation in a Protestant cemetery as the court action worked its way through the Quebec courts. Finally, five years after his death, the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, at that time the court of last resort for the British Empire, allowed his widow's appeal in the Guibord Case and ordered the Church to provide a burial in the portion of the burial ground reserved for Roman Catholics. Religious and political passions were highly aroused by the Judicial Committee's decision and a military escort was needed to carry out the order for burial."

  "text" : "James Lonsdale (16 May 1777 Lancaster – 17 January 1839 London) was a fashionable and prolific English portrait painter who exhibited some 138 works at the Royal Academy between 1802 and 1838, and was one of the founders of the Society of British Artists. His work was influenced and overshadowed by his more successful contemporary Sir Thomas Lawrence (1769–1830). Lonsdale was a pupil of George Romney (1734–1802). Lonsdale, who started off as a pattern designer at Margerison and Glover's print-works in Catterall, was encouraged as an artist by the Lancaster architect Richard Threlfall, of whom he exhibited a portrait in 1809. Lord Archibald, impressed by the quality of his painting and drawing, invited him to Ashton Hall. Here he met two of Lord Archibald's daughters, Lady Anne Hamilton and Lady Susan, the Countess of Dunmore. Feeling that his future would hold more promise in the city, he moved to London, becoming a favourite pupil of Romney's, accompanying him abroad on several occasions. He enrolled in the Royal Academy Schools on 23 October 1801. Lonsdale married a Lancastrian, Miss Thornton, and set up a residence in Southgate. The marriage produced three sons who became portrait painter, the second was James John Lonsdale, recorder of Folkestone, and the last a surgeon. Highly respected, his growing list of clients enabled him to purchase John Opie's studio at 8 Berners Street in the City of Westminster, where he remained until his death. After settling into his new studio he made the acquaintance of the Duke of Norfolk, who commissioned him to do a large historical painting of King John and the Magna Carta, which later was rendered in stained glass in Arundel Castle. Besides the Duke of Norfolk, his sitters included the Duke of Sussex, the Grand Duke Nicholas, the Archibald Douglas-Hamilton, 9th Duke of Hamilton and the Marquess of Downshire. In 1820 the Lord Mayor of London commissioned him to do a portrait of Queen Caroline, after which he was appointed her official portrait painter. Through the Duke of Norfolk he was introduced to the Beefsteak Club, where he met with the most distinguished persons of the time.His portraits reflected accurate details of his sitters that may have been regarded as unflattering."

He started professionally while a teenager in the late 1930s, and eventually joined the prestigious Spade Cooley western swing orchestra. This commitment also brought him film appearances, in many \"singin' cowboy\"'s features. He had a long-lasting friendship with inventor and guitar hardware manufacturer Paul Bigsby, who custom-builtat least three lap-steel for him (a standard, a double neck and even a three neck model). Murphey worked extensively for various western swing and honky-tonk acts (Jimmie Widener, Andy Parker and the Plainsmen, Johnny Bond, Smokey Rogers and many more) but seldom recorded on his behalf. In 1980, he was inducted into the Steel Guitar Hall of Fame His contemporaries included Herb Remington, Leon McAuliffe, Noel Boggs and Speedy West. Many illustrious steel guitarists such as West and Buddy Emmons claimed Murphey as their main influence and mentor. \n*  1947 steel guitar custom-built by Paul Bigsby"

After a few years in the U.K. he moved back to Malta and immediately became a business partner in the management of Penta Hotel in Paceville. This experience further ingrained in him an entrepreneurial spirit that he soon used in the setting up of companies that are not only household names in Malta in their respective industry but are synonymous with Gauci-Maistre. Gauci-Maistre is a frequent contributor to various publications such as Lloyd's and Fairplay and recently he has also taken on blogging in particular the Malta Business Blog."

  "text" : "Jonathan Chapman (born 1974) is Professor of Sustainable Design at the University of Brighton (UK). His research tackles our throwaway society by developing design strategies for longer-lasting products, materials and user experiences — an approach he calls, emotionally durable design. Chapman's work on the behavioural dimension of product longevity was first established in his book, Emotionally Durable Design: Objects, Experiences & Empathy. The theory proposes the creation of products that endure in terms of their technological, physical and emotional durability – a call to arms for professionals, students and academic creatives to think about designing things we would cherish and keep, rather than throw away. He argues that designing products should incorporate a lasting emotional as well as physical perspective. Through this design approach, we increase value, conserve resources and prevent materials from becoming waste. On describing Chapman's research, New Scientist defined him as 'a new breed of sustainable design thinker'. Chapman feels that emotionally durable design represents a core sustainable design strategy. According to the United Nations Industrial Development Organisation Chapman's work has advanced product design and business thinking in a range of settings. He advises a number of global businesses on how they can design their products and services in a more sustainable way — environmentally, socially and financially, including Puma, Philips, Sony and The Body Shop. Through publications, training, exhibitions, master-classes and films, this research has transformed understanding of sustainable design in professional, policy and cultural settings, propelling the field beyond its focus on energy and materials, towards deeper engagements that link psychosocial phenomena with ideas about consumption and waste; helping them to cut waste and to enhance product, material and brand value. Chapman's work is cited in books, journals and a range of popular international publications and broadcast media including, New Scientist CNN International, New Statesman, New York Times, The Telegraph, The Independent and several features and interviews on BBC Radio 4, including: You & Yours, Click-On and The Today Programme.

  "text" : "Josiah White (1781–1850) was an key industrialist along with his partner Erskine Hazard in making the American Industrial Revolution maintain its building momentum after 1814 by supplying an increasing part of the energy needs of other industrialists at a time when there occurred the first energy crisis in the brief history of the country—where forests had grown remote from population centers through over logging, charcoal and imported coal were increasing in price rapidly, and fire wood was growing dearly expensive. He was a mill owner, and early pioneer in the advancement of civil engineering, mining, iron production, water transport and railroad development, boat and barge shipping & construction. Most of all in response to the energy crises in the early 19th century, his focus from 1815 on was all about the mining, and delivery of anthracite coal to others for their manufacturing and domestic heating needs in everyday life. During the War of 1812 he directed the effort to find a way to ignite and burn effectively Anthracite coal, and succeeded. This alone would give him a place in history, but that was but a start. Along with his partner, Erskine Hazard, he also helped found numerous companies, most either mining operations or transportation enterprises opened to establish a better transportation infrastructure for transport of this coal, people, and other industrial materials needs such as ores, timber, and finished goods in the Greater Delaware Valley, the Lehigh Valley and Wyoming Valley regions. Their Lehigh Coal and Navigation Companies are credited with being the earliest known example of vertical integration, the companies each sourcing at least part of the needs of the next domino in the chain. His innovations reached into finished goods as well. White's wire works built the first wire suspension bridge over the Schuylkill, he invested heavily in the Crane Iron Company backing the importing of professional talent from Wales to establish the first blast furnaces of the region in Catasauqua, and established the first wire rope (steel cable) factory in the United States in Mauch Chunk which enabled the Ashley Planes and up cable railway conversion & expansion of the Summit Hill & Mauch Chunk Railroad."

  "text" : "John Onoje (born 15 April 1959 in Sierra Leone) is an activist from Chişinău, the Republic of Moldova. He is a notable activist and member of the National Liberal Party. Onoje is also a member of the Hyde Park public activism group presided by Oleg Brega In 2011, he signed up to run for President in Moldovan presidential election. Onoje's activity has been so well publicised that a party leader, Victor Şelin, proposed the withdrawal of his Moldovan citizenship on this basis. In a public speech, the PCRM's leader Vladimir Voronin called Onoje \"a black, who'd just climbed down from a tree\" (Rom \"... au adus un negru din Africa ... din copac a coborat de acolo...). According to Amnesty International, Onoje is a victim of racism. Onoje is a naturalised Moldovan citizen with a Sierra-Leonean background; he came to Moldova from Sierra Leone in 1999, to escape the civil war in his home country. Just in 2001, the UN Refugee Agency granted him the statute of refugee. While fighting to become a fully-fledged Moldovan, Onoje learnt the language and became a well-known face at the Chişinău open market, where he sells newspapers. After living as a refugee for over a decade, he was granted Moldovan citizenship on 17 January 2011. On 9 December 2011, Onoje passed the medical examination to run in the Moldovan presidential election, 2011–2012. On 10 December 2011, he came at the Stephen the Great Monument to announce that he needs 15 signatures to run the 16 December elections. In December 2011, Victor Şelin proposed the withdrawal of his Moldovan citizenship. He is the owner of a company registered in Moldova, which sells newspapers. Onoje has been a member of the National Liberal Party since 20 December 2011. On 21 November 2011, he protested in front of the Ministry of the Foreign Affairs and European Integration of Moldova in the eve of the visit of Sergey Lavrov to Chişinău. On 2 January 2012, Onoje protested in front of the Russian Embassy in Chişinău against the death of Vadim Pisari, denouncing the lack of an official statement from the Moldovan government on Vadim Pisari's case. One day later, he joined another demonstration. On 20 January 2012, Amnesty International stated that Vladimir Voronin, the head of the Party of Communists made racist statements addressed to Onoje. Two days earlier, he had participated in the meeting of a group near the Triumphal arch, Chişinău, while Voronin was addressing his supporters in the National Assembly Square. Voronin, the former President of the country said: “They [the ruling parties] brought here a Negro, who'd just climbed down from a tree, and now he's doing politics for them.\" According to Amnesty International, on 19 January 2012, Onoje was beaten up in a toilet in an underpass in Chişinău, near a shopping centre in broad daylight."

  "text" : "John Lorenzo Young (30 May 1826, London - 26 July 1881, at sea) was an English-Australian educationalist and founder of the Adelaide Educational Institution. Young was born in London, the son of John Tonkin Young (1802?–10 April 1882), a builder from Veryan, Cornwall. He was educated at the Communal College of Boulogne, under Professor Opel at Wiesbaden, in 1842 at the College for Civil Engineers in Putney, and at King's College London from 1843 to 1845, where John Howard Clark (later Sir John Howard Clark, editor of The Register and who conducted its Geoffry Crabthorn column) was a fellow student. Another reference says this fellow-student was Howard Clark's brother A. Sidney Clark. He worked in Cornwall on railway and mining construction then left for Adelaide in 1850. on the ship Panama, arriving on 31 October 1850. A fellow passenger was W. W. R. Whitridge, with whom he was to strike a lasting friendship. He joined the rush to the Victorian goldfields but soon returned. In 1851 he became second master at the newly established South Australian High School, but the venture failed by the end of the year. Headmaster Charles Gregory Feinaigle (1817? – 10 March 1880), before 1860 spelled \"Feinagle\", opened a private academy at his residence Brandon on Unley Road, but was soon in Victoria, in a wide variety of vocations. He remained friends with J. L. Young: together they founded the Philosophical Society in January 1853, along with Whitridge, who by this time was editor of The Register), and he maintained active membership after he left Adelaide. In December 1851 Young departed Adelaide via the overland route and the Victorian Goldfields at Mt Alexander. On 23 February 1852  Young Returned to Adelaide on board the Elizabeth. Young returned to the goldfields aboard the brig Louisa on 8 March  and on 30 July arrived back in Adelaide aboard the Reliance. A letter later appears in the Register signed by Young and some passengers referring to 'mutinous conduct' by the crew and commending the efforts of the captain of the ship. After the South Australian High School folded, he was persuaded in 1852 to open his own school at the rear of the old chapel in Ebenezer Street off Rundle Street East, and soon moved to larger premises in Stephens Place. His brother, Oliver Young, held classes for some time, (and acted headmaster in 1860 while J. L. Young was away on recuperation leave) but returned to Cornwall in 1866. Oliver never married. On 29 October 1855, John married first cousin Martha Paynter Young (c. 1829 – 6 April 1887). Their children included: \n* first son Arago was born early in 1857 but died at Glenelg on 7 March 1859. \n* Algernon Sidney Young (28 February 1858 – ) was born at their home in North Terrace. He was a noted player with the Norwood Football Club. \n* John Hampden Young (26 August 1859 – 18 August 1861) was born at North Terrace \n* Bertha Young (29 April 1861 – 15 August 1915) was born at Parkside, as were all succeeding children. She died in England. \n* Edith Young (8 February 1863 – 11 July 1937) \n* Ellen Young (30 December 1864 – 5 December 1923) died in England. \n* Abraham Lincoln Young (8 June 1866 – 21 August 1917) \n* John Howard Young (8 February 1868 – 23 October 1936) died in Otago, New Zealand. His will, dated 1924, by its omissions, indicates an antipathy to his father and siblings. \n* Emily Young (26 March 1870 – 25 September 1875) \n* Roland Hill Young (17 March 1873 – 17 June 1925) died in Perth, Western Australia. None of J. L. Young's children had an academic career. In 1861 he built the large two-storey Young House in Parkside, which was used both as his private residence and as a student boarding house. He then commissioned architects Wright and Hamilton to design and oversee building of a schoolhouse next door. (Edmund Wright had designed many prominent Adelaide buildings including the Town Hall). In 1871 he was able to relinquish the Freeman Street premises. John retired in 1880 and closed the school, with the intention of joining his wife and large family who were visiting brother Oliver and his father in Veryan, in Cornwall. On his retirement, a testimonial was held 17 December 1880 by his old scholars, and he was presented with a purse of sovereigns. His 16-room residence, with schoolhouse and various other houses on Young Street, after several auction attempts in February 1881, was eventually purchased by Alfred Allen Simpson (who coincidentally had also purchased the Gawler Place school property). The two Parkside buildings at 61-71 Young Street were sold by Alfred A., Fred N. and Violet Laura Simpson to Mr. C. O. A. Lapidge in 1922. \"Young House\" has since been demolished but the heritage-listed schoolhouse still stands. He embarked on the steamer John Elder in 1881 to visit England (where his father was still living), his family having preceded him, but died on 26 July 1881 while crossing the Red Sea. He was buried at sea. Martha returned to Adelaide, at first living in Kent Town then settled in Glenelg. She died 6 April 1887 aged 57. Fred W. Sims, formerly Deputy Registrar of Companies in the Supreme Court, wrote in The Advertiser: I could tell you quite a lot about John L. Young's school— 'dear old Johnny', as we used to call him ... Mr. Young possessed, among his other fine qualities, the saving grace of humor. It is recorded that his first two pupils were Caleb Peacock and John Partridge. He remarked at the time that, whether be met with success or not as a schoolmaster, he would anyway die \"game\"."

He started the Milner Coal and Railroad Mines. He was a native of Pike County, Georgia. He spent his early youth in the Dahlonega, Georgia gold fields. He received a classical training at Athens, Georgia. In 1848 he went to California to follow the San Francisco gold rush and eventually became the City Surveyor of San Jose, California. He moved to Alabama in 1852 and built a number of railroads. He laid out some of the first railroad lines that ran across Alabama. The primary one was the \"North and South\" which traversed from Birmingham to Montgomery. As a railroad engineer, he was the principal player in choosing site of the City of Birmingham, based on his assessment of the strategic resources and transportation advantages of Jones Valley in Alabama. It is due to his rail line that brought Birmingham into existence. In many respects, he was the father of Southern industrialization, particularly in the deep, deep South. Milner's vision triggered decades of rapid industrial growth. He represented Jefferson County in the Alabama Senate for eight years. He was the most conspicuous figure in the creation of Birmingham and one of the most distinguished citizens of Alabama. He died in New Castle, Alabama of paralysis and was interred at Oak Hills Cemetery in Birmingham, Alabama."

In 1837 he was attacked and stabbed by a disgruntled former employee of the Company, who subsequently committed suicide whilst in custody. In 1830 he was returned as Member of Parliament for Hythe along with Stewart Marjoribanks (brother of East India Company Chairman Campbell Marjoribanks), serving until the constituency's representation was reduced to one member in the Great Reform Act of 1832. He died at Bushey Grove, Hertfordshire in February 1868 aged 86. He had married Rabina Marion, the daughter of Archibald Cullen of Middlesex, with whom he had a son and a daughter.

Irving had started the Workshop with fellow New Yorker Herbert Blau, whom he knew from undergraduate days at New York University and then during graduate study at Stanford University. The men were both professors at San Francisco State, Irving in the Drama department and Blau in English. Known to friends as \"Buddy,\" Irving was from childhood deeply involved in theater, supported in this by his family along with his older brother Richard, despite a degree of religious reservation inculcated by bizarre bearded Russian/Yiddish-speaking rabbinical teachers that dis-inspired what Irving called a \"lost generation\" of the children of Jewish immigrants. He was active in school shows and made his Broadway debut at the age of thirteen in George S. Kaufman's The American Way. He joined the army in 1943, serving in the infantry during the Battle of the Bulge and as a Russian translator when his unit met Soviet forces. After V-E Day, he transferred to Special Services and had the opportunity to hone his theater managerial skills as he organized camp shows under Joshua Logan."

  "text" : "Count Johann Philipp of Hanau-Lichtenberg (13 January [O.S. 23 January] 1626 in Bouxwiller – 18 December 1669 in Babenhausen) was a son of Count Philipp Wolfgang (1595–1641) and his wife, Countess Johanna of Oettingen-Oettingen (1602–1639). During his childhood, his parents had to flee several times from their county seat in Bouxwiller to nearby Strasbourg, where the family possessed a mansion, to avoid the fighting of the Thirty Years' War. As the second son, he was assigend the castle and district of Babenhausen in his father's testament. He could only take possession of Babenhausen in 1647, as it had been occupied by Mainz during the war. After the war ended, Johann Philipp and his younger brother Johann Reinhard (1628–1666) went on a Grand Tour to Germany, the Netherlands, England, France and Switzerland. In 1664 Johann Philipp visited the Diet of Regensburg, where he got into a duel against a prince of House of Reuss. In 1669 he tried to stage a coup against his brother Friedrich Casimir who had burdened the county of Hanau with heavy debts and was trying to improve his financial situation by selling a part of his territory. Friedrich Casimir's relatives disagreed and in November 1669, they seized power during his absence. Their emergency government collapsed after three days and Friedrich Casimir was restored to power. Friedrich Casimir then exiled Johann Philipp from the city of Hanau. Johann Philipp died the next month, on 18 December 1669 and was buried in the St. Nikolaus church in Babenhausen, where his wife had been buried earlier."

  "text" : "Joachim Fischer (born 1951 in Hanover) is a German sociologist and social theorist. His reference book on Philosophical anthropology has become the standard reference for the field. As of 2011, he is president of the Helmuth Plessner Society. The focus of his work lies in the areas of philosophical anthropology, sociological theory, culture sociology and sociology of architecture. In 2010, he became an honorary professor at the Philosophical Faculty of the Dresden University of Technology. In the summer semester of 2012 he was a visiting professor at the University Viadrina of Frankfurt (Oder) (Sociology / Sociological Theory). Fischer´s work has focused on reconstructing the paradigm of modern European Philosophical anthropology (Max Scheler, Helmuth Plessner, Erich Rothacker, Arnold Gehlen, Adolf Portmann) in the 20th century, explicating its significance for biological, sociological and philosophical debates in the 21st century. In a series of essays he too developed - with reference to Simmel and Freud - a systematic consideration on the figure of the Third: Triads (sociology) seem for intersubjective relationships and institutions to be just as well constitutive than the Dyad (sociology) or the Other (Alterity)."

  "text" : "Joseph R. Berger is an American internist and neurologist who is known for his research interests in progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), the neurological complications of HIV/AIDS, multiple sclerosis, and other inflammatory disorders of the brain. Particularly, he contributed research on why PML occurs more frequently in AIDS than in other immunosuppressive conditions. He has also made substantial contributions to the understanding of the spectrum of neurological complications that accompany HIV infection occurring as a consequence of the direct effects of the HIV on the central and peripheral nervous system and those that result from the accompanying immunosuppression of AIDS. Berger is the discoverer of the value of the anabolic steroid oxandrolone in the treatment of AIDS wasting and AIDS myopathy. He is the recipient of the 2015 Pioneer in NeuroVirology award of the International Society for NeuroVirology."

  "text" : "(For other people named James Metcalfe, see James Metcalfe (disambiguation).) James \"Jimmy\" Metcalf (March 11, 1925 – January 27, 2012) was an American sculptor, artist and educator. Metcalf established and led a community for copper artisans in Santa Clara del Cobre, Michoacán, Mexico, from the 1970s until his death in 2012. Metcalf was born in New York City. His parents were both stained glass artists, most notably contributing to the windows for the Cathedral of Saint John the Divine. Metcalf took up art and sculpture as a teenager. He enlisted in the 88th Infantry Division of the United States Army, nicknamed the Blue Devils, when he was 18 years old. Metcalf fought in northern Italy during World War II, and lost three of his fingers during combat at Furlo Pass. Metcalf attended the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts in Philadelphia and then enrolled at the Central School of Arts and Crafts in London. He was awarded a fellowship to study ancient metallurgy and essentially moved to Deya, Majorca, in 1953. There he befriended and collaborated with writer Robert Graves on his work, Adam's Rib, published in 1955. Metcalf lived in Paris from 1956 to 1965, where he located his studio at the Impasse Ronsin. By 1965, Metcalf was an accomplished sculptor, with a studio on Spring Street in SoHo. However, he was tired of contemporary art and moved to Mexico, including Mexico City. He became friends with prominent writers and artists, including Carlos Fuentes and Carlos Pellicer, and was the first to introduce Octavio Paz to Marcel Duchamp. Metcalf won the commission to forge the Olympic torch for the 1968 Summer Olympics in Mexico City. He was married to Mexican actress Pilar Pellicer, his third wife, with whom he had two sons and one daughter. Metcalf later married Pilar Pellicar's younger sister, sculptor Ana Pellicer, his fourth wife. Metcalf opened a studio and forge in 1967, where he taught artists how to create vases with a thick edge called El Borde Greuso. In 1973, Melcalf and Anna Pellicer founded Casa de Artesana and a school. which would become known as the Adolfo Best Maugard School of Arts and Crafts in Santa Clara del Cobre, to promote indigenous artists and pre-Columbian coppersmithing and forging techniques. Their work has been credited with preserving the metalworking of the region. Metcalf died in Santa Clara del Cobre, Michoacan, on January 27, 2012, at the age of 86. He was survived by his wife, Ana Pellicer. He was buried in Santa Clara del Cobre, near several of his sculptures."
