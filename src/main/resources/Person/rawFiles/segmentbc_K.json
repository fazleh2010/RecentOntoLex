As a relatively young man in 1880, Kim Hong-jip had undertaken an official mission to Japan, where he learned first-hand of the modernizing reforms taking place in that country. This inspired in him a profound desire to effect such changes in Korea. After Gapsin Coup, he became the first vice-premier 'Jwauijeong' and he entered into a 'Korea-Japan Treaty of 1885'. Then, in 1896, Hong-jip was appointed a Prime minister to suppress Donghak Peasant Revolution. During this period, he abolished caste system in Joseon Dynasty, and he carried out the ordinance prohibiting topknots. After the assassination of Queen Min, \"pro-Japan cabinet members like Kim Hong-jip and O Yun-jung were killed.\""

He painted his first handball court in 1973 and by 1976 he had painted over fifty major pieces on subway trains in New York City. In the 1980s he popularized his \"computer rock\" style, a form of wildstyle where letters are broken into boxes and scrambled. He was featured in the original hip-hop documentary Style Wars, which won the Grand Prize for Documentaries at the 1983 Sundance Film Festival. Kase was a member of TFP Crew (The Fantastic Partners). The self-proclaimed King of Style, Kase was admired by other graffiti writers as having a natural flair for his art, his train pieces being creative and stylish. Kase lost his right arm in a subway accident when he was just ten years old. Kase explained what happened to himself in 'Style Wars': \"It wasn't no severely bad accident, just that I got burnt by wires, that's all... electrical wires, and then they rushed me to the hospital and they just had to amputate... 'Cause my tissues and muscles was burnt bad.\" Kase died on August 14, 2011, at Lincoln Medical and Mental Health Center in South Bronx from lung adenocarcinoma."

Konstantin's family belonged to the aristocratic and sophisticated circles in Russia before the Russian revolution in 1917.Prince (knyaz) Simone Mikeladze, Konstantin's father, had six children – three girls and three boys as follows: \n*  Konstantin Mikeladze (1895–1927) \n*  Grigor Mikeladze (1898–1955) \n*  Evgeni Mikeladze (1903–1937) \n*  Ketto Mikeladze \n*  Tamara Mikeladze \n*  Anastasia Mikeladze Konstantin attended the Imperial Russian Cavalry School in Tbilisi and afterwards joined the Army. Kostia Mikeladze came to Iran after General Anton Denikin's defeat in the Russian Civil War against the Red Army, around 1919. He joined the Swedish trained Iranian Gendarmerie with his Russian rank. At that time the Iranian Gendarmerie and Army were fighting the separatist movements around the country and strengthening the powers of the Iranian Central Government in the different regions. One of these campaigns was against the Kurds and the Simko fighters. In December 1920, the Gendarmerie expeditionary corps, reinforced by about 100 horsemen from Maku, started an offensive towards Simko who had openly rebelled and occupied the towns of Urmia, Dilman and other regions. This detachment was attacked by about 2,000 Kurds led by Simko. Konstantin Mikeladze was the commander of one squadron, while Captain Hasan Arfa commanded the other. After three hours of heavy fighting the Gendarmes lost about sixty soldiers amongst them Prince Konstantin Mikeladze who had displayed great bravery under fire. For his utmost bravery in the service of the Iranian Army, Prince Konstantin Mikeladze was awarded one of the highest military honors, \"Neshane Eftekhar\" or \"Medal of Honor\"."

She was born in 1972 in Alexandria, Scotland, and went to the Glasgow School of Art, where she graduated from the sculpture department in 1999 and received her M.F.A. in 2004. She lives and works in Glasgow. She uses mostly traditional art-making materials such as plaster, paint, paper and chalk in her work, along with a small amount of substances such as cosmetics and toiletries. Her sculptures are either 'almost' or 'only just' objects and skirt amongst the mediums of painting, performance art and installation, often contrasting large scale with a fragility of form. Artists who have influenced her work include Helen Frankenthaler, Karen Kilimnick, Lynda Benglis, Robert Smithson and Richard Tuttle. Karla Black is represented by Stuart Shave/Modern Art in London and David Zwirner, New York."

In 1949 he was an integral part of the Larks first Grey Cup championship as a replacement for all-star Eagle Keys at centre and a back up at every other line position. He played 3 seasons with Montreal, for a total of 30 games. Returning to Winnipeg, he played for 5 more seasons, including the 1953 Grey Cup. He studied at University of Manitoba. Vidruk became deeply involved in the Winnipeg amateur sports community: Pan Am Games Society and Faculties Board (1966-69), Manitoba Football Official Association, Canadian Football League Official, Manitoba Amateur Football Association, founding member of the Manitoba High School Athletic Association, Chairman of the Manitoba Sports Federation Boards of Directors (1978-81), Sports Federation of Canada Board Member (1982-85), Vice Chairman of the Manitoba Sports Hall of Fame (1979-85), active member of the Manitoba Waterski Association.

Lady appeared in a number of TV and films during the 16 years she was with the Durdens. Most notably Disney's Grand Canyon, The Legend of the Boy and the Eagle and a number of Lassie episodes. Kent began his own nature film making business in the 60's and 70's. Some of his experiences photographing animals for various TV shows and films was documented in the book A Fine and Peaceful Kingdom. He also showed his film on lecture tours for the National Audubon Society for many years. In 1971 Kent wrote the book Gifts of an Eagle. The book tells the story of all that he and his father learned about golden eagles. It also documents the strong relationship between Ed and Lady. This book and the documentary film that followed had a major impact on eagle studies. The footage of Lady's eggs hatching was the first time an eagle was filmed nesting in captivity."

He was the son of King Xi of Han. During his reign, Han Fei submitted numerous proposals to enact Legalism. In 246 BC, King Huanhui sent Zheng Guo west to Qin to construct a canal with the intention of wasting Qin's resources. The canal came to be known as Zhengguo Canal. In the 55th year of King Nan of Zhou (262 BC), Qin sent Bai Qi to invade Han and took Yewang. To broker peace, King Huanhui ceded Shangdang Commandery to Qin. The people of Shangdang refused to be ruled by Qin but also lacked the military strength for defense. Shangdang's governor-general Feng Ting (冯亭) surrendered instead to Zhao. Zhao accepted the surrender and sent Lian Po to defend Changping; the Battle of Changping ensued. King Huanhui died in 239 BC and was succeeded by his son King An of Han."

  "text" : "Krishna Varma Raja was Eralpad or eldest prince of Calicut. He was known as Kishen Varma, Kishen Raja and Prince of Karimpuzha in British records. Varma rose to power after Hyder Ali's second conquest of Malabar in 1774. Manavikraman Raja of Calicut fled to Travancore and thus his second-in-command Krishna Varma became de facto head of state. The oppressive Mysore rule pushed Malabar into a state of revolt that lasted throughout the Mysore period (1774 to 1791). The Kingdom of Calicut covered much of South Malabar. Varma and his nephews led resistance. Ravi Varma the Elder and Ravi Varma the Younger were most prominent. Krishna Varma operated from the traditional seat of Eralpad in Karimpuzha, present Palghat district, commanding a large resistance movement which took the form of guerrilla warfare. His nephew Ravi Varma the Elder acted as Commander In Chief of rebel military force. The rebels foiled all effort of Mysore government to set up a working administration in South Malabar. In 1788, Varma went in person to Calicut to negotiate peace with Tipu Sultan but eventually decided not to cooperate with Sultan. To escape from Tipu's camp, he agreed to all proposals of Sultan and took a large sum from Tipu as reward, but once he fled to safety of Karimpuzha, he broke his promise and renewed his revolt on a greater scale. He died in 1793."

A scandal ensued when the allegations were discovered to be false, which generated intensive media coverage and political debate in Ireland, resulting in a government inquiry into the broadcaster. The allegations were made in a report by journalist Aoife Kavanagh titled \"Mission to Prey\", which aired in May 2011 on the Prime Time programme. Kavanagh alleged that during his time as a missionary in Kenya, Reynolds had raped and impregnated a minor named Veneraanda, fathering a child called Sheila. Kavanagh also alleged that Reynolds had secretly provided financial support to Sheila over a number of years. Both Veneranda and Sheila were interviewed on the programme to corroborate the allegations. The events were purported to have taken place in the Diocese of Kakamega in Kenya. Prior to the broadcasting of the show, Reynolds volunteered to have DNA testing undertaken to prove his innocence but this offer was refused by RTÉ. Later, two separate and independent DNA tests established that Reynolds was not the father of the child. With this it emerged that the allegations were entirely baseless. However, as a result of the broadcast, Reynolds was removed from his home and his parish ministry. When it became public knowledge that Reynolds had been falsely accused, RTÉ broadcast an apology to him. Prime Time Investigates, the series on which the allegations were broadcast, was immediately suspended. The Director-General of RTÉ, Noel Curran, admitted the broadcasting of \"Mission to Prey\" was \"one of the gravest editorial mistakes ever made\" at RTÉ. RTÉ staff, including Mike Murphy, John Bowman and Sean O'Rourke, publicly criticised the libel. The head of the Irish Missionary Union said that Aoife Kavanagh's continuing presence on Morning Ireland after being found guilty of defaming Reynolds was \"unfair and unjust\" and a demonstration of \"double standards\" in the media. In November 2011, Reynolds agreed to an out-of-court libel settlement with RTÉ. The amount of the settlement was not disclosed. His solicitor also requested that the Irish justice minister, Alan Shatter, \"clarify that he accepts that Fr Reynolds was guilty of no wrongdoing\", in response to Shatter's previous public support of \"Mission to Prey\" when it was broadcast in May 2011."

  "text" : "Karl von Enhuber (1811–1867), a genre painter, was born at Hof, in Voigtland. He was the son of a civil officer who, when his son was eighteen months old, moved to Nördlingen. After studying at the Munich Academy he was at first an animal painter. He then worked at representations of the Thirty Years' War and only through the study of the works of Metsu and Terborch did he discover his true talent. He was admitted a member of the Munich Academy in 1858, and died at Munich in 1867. He excelled in characterizing middle-class home life, with its pleasures and troubles, and had a natural sense of humour, which was the foundation of his delicate delineation of character. To be mentioned amongst his works are: \n* Berlin. Gallery. Return of the Munich Guardsman. 1844.  \n* Darmstadt. Gallery. Sessions Day in Bavaria.  \n* Munich. Gallery. A Grandfather watching his Grandson at play with toy Soldiers and A Carver in his Workshop."

  "text" : "Kang Shin-Jae (hangul: 강신재, hanja: 康信哉; 8 May 1924 – 12 May 2001) was a female novelist, essayist and playwright of Korea. She graduated from Kyunggi Girls' High School. She entered Ewha Womans University, but dropped out of college after her second year. She started her career as a writer in 1949 on the recommendation of Kim Dong-ni, publishing short stories \"Face\" (얼굴) and \"Jeong Suni\" (정순이). Her major works included the novels Dandellions of Imjin River (임진강의 민들레), Waves (파도), Today and Tomorrow (오늘과 내일), short story collections Young Zelkova Tree (젊은 느티나무), Journey (여정), and essay collection Sandcastle (모래성). She published romantic stories like \"The Tribulation of Mr. Pyo\" (표 선생 수난기) and \"Young Zelkova Tree\" (젊은 느티나무), which depict illicit love stories that were very extreme at that time. Most of her novels discuss breaking social morals and conventions and the principle subject matter was the eternal triangle and adultery. She was awarded the Korean Writers' Association Award (한국문인협회상) in 1959 and the Female Writers' Award (여성문학상) in 1967. \"Young Zelkova Tree\" is a love story between step-siblings (Hyunkyu and Sookhee). A love letter causes them to start to have a secret love affair. They feel happy and also fearful about the relationship. Sookhee leaves Hyunkyu because she cannot bear the situation anymore. However they meet again under the zelkova tree and promise to love despite all their obstacles. \"Young Zelkova Tree\" was made into a movie directed by Lee Sunggu in 1968. The leading actors were Shin Seong-il and Moon Hee."

At Munich he was also director of the municipal district maternity hospital and school for midwives. In 1874/75 he served as university rector. From 1877 he worked with Carl Siegmund Franz Credé (1819–1892) and Alfred Hegar (1830–1914) for the creation of an independent gynecological society, but it wasn't until 1885, three years after his death, when the Deutsche Gesellschaft für Gynäkologie was established.

  "text" : "K. RadhaKrishna Menon (18 January 1924 – 4 October 2007) also known as Radhettan or Baba, is viewed as an ideal Gandhian who, through his life, showed the world how the teachings of the Mahatma could be implemented in a modern world. Local people saw Gandhiji in Menon, learned about Gandhiji through Menon, and named him after Gandhiji. Radhakrishna Menon was born on 18 January 1924, to Karumathil Pokkavil Kurungottu Lakshmikutty Amma and Vappala Kunhunni Menon, who was a circle inspector under the British rule. Sardar Vallabhai Patel’s close aide V.P. Menon was his uncle. Radhakrishna Menon did his M.A. (Hons) in economics from Madras Christian College, where he had friends like P.P. Ummer Koya and K.N. Raj. After his degree, he reached Kolkata and edited a paper called Sathi. From Kolkata, he reached Mahatma Gandhi's Sewagram Ashram in Wardha, where he learned the crux Gandhian education ‘Nayee Taalim’. Nayee Taalim is a \"Life centered education\" system conceived by Gandhi who sincerely believed that freedom without wisdom would lead to anarchy. Gandhi wanted India to be well prepared to handle the freedom and he had a vision to create a new education system to educate the students not for exams but for life and prepare them as responsible and wise citizens. Radhakrishna Menon got deeply inspired by this and realized that the real freedom of humanity could be achieved only through the Nayee Taalim basic education. It was here that he met his future wife Nirmala Manjarekar who was the daughter of noted Gandhian Dadabhai Naik's younger sister. Radhakrishna Menon spent several days with Gandhiji at Wardha Ashram and had close association with Jayaprakash Narayan, Acharya Kripalani, Kelappaji, Acharya Vinoba Bhave. After Indian independence in 1947, there were also Gandhians who felt that their work was not yet completed. An \"army\" of constructive workers who believed in Gandhi's Philosophy went to the villages to restructure the society. RadhaKrishna Menon was one such unsung hero who devoted his energy, time and effort for promoting human welfare and restructuring the society. Radhakrishna Menon came back to Ramanattukara, a small village then in the Kozhikode district of northern Kerala in South India and founded the first basic school of Kerala, \"Sevamandiram\"(the temple of service). The initial capital for the establishment of the school, Rs.5000 was donated by Jawaharlal Nehru, then Prime Minister of India. Radhakrishna Menon later was also given the responsibility of being the guardian of a village named 'Navodaya Danagram' (New Dawn Gift Village). Navodaya Danagram was given as 'bhoodan' under the 'bhoodan movement' by [Vinobha Bhave]. This was a complete new concept introduced by Mahatma Gandhi and Vinoba Bhave and supported nationwide by Gandhian Sarvodaya activists including Jayaprakash Narayan, where the rich and landlords donated lands for the landless people. This was ideologically very different from Communism where though the ends were probably similar, the means were different. Unlike communism where the driving force was a dictate from the state, the driving force in the Bhoodaan movement (literal meaning: Land donation) was a change in mindset from \"Ownership\" to love, compassion for and urge to help the landless fellow human being. Radhakrishna Menon and his wife Nirmala Manjarekar motivated many landlords to donate a small piece of their lands and created a whole village from this donated land for landless poor people. This village was named Navodaya Danagram (Sanskrit, literally meaning Newly risen / borne / awakened village of donation) The highly educated couple actually settled there to practice what they preached- a wholesome village development. Apart from building this new village, the couple carried out a lot of community works in the society around them. Some of the institutions founded by RadhaKrishna Menon and his wife Nirmala Manjarekar includes Navodaya Danagram Bala Vikas Mandal, Seva Mandir Post Basic School and Seva Mandir Teacher Training Institute When people described his friend Kelappan as Kerala Gandhi, RadhaKrishna Menon was called Ramanattukara Gandhi.Radhakrishna Menon died of age related complications on 4 October 2007 in a private nursing home in Kozhikode."

  "text" : "Kasra Nikzad (born August 19, 1921, in Tehran, Iran) was the inspiration for Touka Neyestani's cartoon character Bisho'ur who figured prominently in his cartoon series \"پرماجرا و تأ\". Bisho'ur, meaning idiot, was created to emphasize the contradictory nature of the religious government regime in Tehran. Kasra Nikzad, who represented and worked with the regime at the time was said to have confounded the citizens with speeches full of Islamic dogma, but when pressed on matters resorted to explaining government decisions based on self-interested egoism. This dialectic between rational egoism, and religious doctrine is the butt of many cartoon strips by Touka Neyestani."

In 1828 he traveled to the Black Sea and ended up in Crimea. He was a traveling companion of the Spanish Count Orlando de la Blanca. Between about 1830 to 1860 he worked as court architect of the Russian royal family on the south coast of Crimea, especially in the district of Greater Yalta. For this area, he created a general plan and designed a number of private and public buildings, including the first hotel of Yalta. Aeshlimann was involved in construction of the castle in Alupka for the Vorontsov family.

Korean based sources indicate that in the summer of 1947 or 1948, Shura and his brother were playing in a pond in the city of Pyongyang, when Shura mysteriously drowned. Russian sources indicate that he drowned in a well in Vyatskoye, prior to the family moving back to Korea. Official records state that Kim Jong-il was devastated and could never get over the trauma of losing his younger brother. In 1949, his mother, Kim Jong-suk died while giving birth to a stillborn girl."

She was a Korean independence activist and communist politician. April 21 is a day of memorial for her in North Korea, when a wreath-laying ceremony is held at Chilgol Revolutionary Site, in what was Chilgol-ri, a town once in Pyongan Province and today part of Pyongyang. In North Korea, Kang Pan-sŏk is referred to as the \"Mother of Korea\" or \"Great Mother of Korea\". Both titles are shared with Kim Jong-il's mother Kim Jong-suk. However, it was Kang Pan-sŏk who was the first family member of Kim Il-sung to have a cult of personality of her own to supplement that of his son, from the late 1960s onwards. In 1967 Rodong Sinmun praised her as the \"mother of all\". The same year, the Democratic Women's League initiated a campaign called \"Learning from Madame Kang Pan-sŏk\". There is a song by the name of \"Mother of Korea\" in her honor, as well as a hagiographic biography, also called The Mother of Korea (1968). The Protestant Chilgol Church in Pyongyang is dedicated to the memory of Kang Pan-sok, who was a Presbyterian. Her name meant \"rock\", having been named for Saint Peter."

  "text" : "Kishor Parekh (1930-1982) was an Indian photojournalist. He was born in Bhavnagar, Gujarat, and studied filmmaking and documentary photography at the University of Southern California. His work as a student won him numerous awards. He returned to India from 1960 to 1961 and became the chief photographer of the Hindustan Times. In this capacity, he covered the Sino-Indian war of 1962 and the 1965 conflict between India and Pakistan. He was awarded a gold medal by Soviet Land for his coverage of the Tashkent summit that marked the conclusion of the war. He covered the 1966-1967 famine in Bihar and his photographs on this subject were exhibited in the United States. He also shot Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru until the latter's death in 1964. After six years at the Hindustan Times, Parekh joined the Asia Magazine in Hong Kong in 1967. He travelled throughout the Asia Pacific region on assignment. Later on, he became photo editor of Pacific Magazines Ltd, a position he held till about 1972. Afterwards, he returned to Bombay. Parekh is best known for his work on the Bangladesh Liberation War of 1971. His book on the subject, Bangladesh: A Brutal Birth, was a covered the atrocities committed by the Pakistani forces and the suffering of the native Bengali population. According to photographer Pablo Bartholomew: '\"Bangladesh was Kishor’s highest point. Self-assigned, self-funded, driven by his own instincts, emotions and guts, in a two week period he produced a startling set of images that became a powerful book and statement.\". The Indian government commissioned 20,000 copies of the book to raise awareness of the war. Parekh's work appeared in numerous national and international publications including National Geographic, Paris Match, Sunday Times, Time magazine, Stern, Popular Photography and Asahi Graphic. He died of a heart attack in 1982 while on assignment in the Himalayas. Upon his death, his 16-year-old son Swapan Parekh became a photographer. Kishor was married to Saroj Parekh."

He graduated from Mangyongdae Revolutionary School and the \"Soviet Union Naval Academy\". Although the North Korean army mainly depends on ground troops, Admiral Kim who was commander of the Korean People's Navy since 1982 was installed in the highest military position of the head of the Minister of the People's Armed Forces in 1998, filling a vacancy left by Choe Kwang, who died in February 1997, something that indicated that he was fully trusted by Kim Jong-il. Kim Il-chol participated as a senior delegate in the inter-Korean Defense Minister’s meeting held for the first time since the division of the Korean peninsula in September 2000. Kim was appointed to the National Defence Commission in 1988. He was removed from all his positions in 2010, reportedly due to his advanced age."

  "text" : "Kartar Singh Jhabbar (1874-20 November 1962) was a Sikh leader known for his role in the Gurdwara Reform Movement of the 1920s. Kartar Singh was born to Teja Singh in the Jhabbar village of Sheikhupura District in Punjab (British India). His grandfather Mangal Singh was in the service of Maharaja Ranjit Singh. He received religious education (1906–09) at the Khalsa Updeshak Mahavidyala, a training institution for Sikh preachers at Garjakh. In 1909, Kartar Singh became a preacher and later joined the Singh Sabha Movement. In 1919, he was arrested for anti-Government protests following the Jallianwala Bagh massacre. He was awarded a sentence in the Andaman jail, but was later released after the announcement of the royal clemency. In the 1920s, Kartar Singh led the Gurdwara Reform Movement, which aimed at transferring the control of Sikh gurdwaras from traditional clergy (Udasi mahants) and Government-appointed managers to the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC). In 1920, a jatha (volunteer group) led by him seized the control of the Babe di Ber gurdwara in Sialkot. He also played an important role in the SGPC's takeover of the Harmandir Sahib (Golden Temple), the holiest shrine of the Sikhs. He further helped the Akalis seize the control of Gurdwara Panja Sahib (Hasan Abdal, November 1920), Gurdwara Sacha Sauda (Chuhar Kana, December 1920), Gurdwara Sri Tarn Taran Sahib (January 1921) and Gurdwara Guru ka Bagh (near Amritsar, January 1921). In 1921, Kartar Singh was arrested for protesting against the Nankana massacre, and again in 1924 for taking part in various Akali movement demonstrations. He was released in December 1928, because of poor health. He and his associates were involved in securing for SGPC the possession of properties attached to various gurdwaras, in accordance with the Sikh Gurdwaras Act, 1925. After the partition of India in 1947, Kartar Singh migrated to Habri village of Karnal district (in present day Kaithal district of Haryana). He was engaged in resettlement of refugees, and died in Habri, in 1962."

He also held a Clinical Assistant Professorship in Family Medicine at the University of Southern California, until his retirement. He is most notable for the national attention created by the publication of his article on end-of-life issues, titled \"How Doctors Die\", which went viral on the internet. It generated a national conversation on issues related to patient wishes at their end of life, and quality issues related to that. He has also been a long-time commentator on health care systems, particularly managed care. Dr. Murray has been interviewed widely, such as NPR, the New York Times, and physician education sites. Dr. Murray was also a reviewer for \"How To Report Statistics in Medicine:Annotated Guidelines for Authors, Editors, and Reviewers\", by Lang and Secic, an important reference in preparing and writing scientific literature articles. Dr. Murray was previously a physician advisor/editor for the now defunct \"Weekly Briefings From the New England Journal of Medicine\" He was a founder of Lakeside Medical Group in Burbank, California, served on its board for 25 years, and on the boards of several of its derivative organizations, was an corporate officer, and was a medical director for many years. He was the Commodore of Fairwind Yacht Club in Marina del Rey. He is a frequent speaker in Southern California on medical topics, backpacking and outdoor topics, sailing topics, and topics on the business of medicine, and spends several months each summer doing trail maintenance in the High Sierra of California for the High Sierra Volunteer Trail Crew, for whom he is a crew leader. He writes for Zocalo Public Square, an online magazine of ideas. Dr. Murray's lifelong interest in clean water has led him to work as a wilderness ranger in the High Sierra (California's ultimate water source), and he has served in a volunteer advisory capacity to the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power's Recycled Water Advisory Board. He also serves on the Integrated Resources Plan for the City of Los Angeles, integrating water management for the city. As part of that committee, he was jointly awarded the 2011 United States Water Prize."

  "text" : "Kan Ek' (sometimes spelt Canek) was the name or title used by the Itza Maya kings at their island capital Nojpetén upon Lake Petén Itzá in the Petén Department of Guatemala. The full title was Aj Kan Ek'  or Ajaw Kan Ek' , and in some studies Kan Ek' is used as the name of the Late Postclassic (c. 1200 to 1697) Petén Itza polity. The earliest known use of the title comes from a Maya stela at the archaeological site of Yaxchilan and dates to the mid 8th century AD. The name is recorded in inscriptions at widely spaced Maya cities including Seibal, Motul de San José and Chichen Itza. When Spanish conquistador Hernán Cortés crossed Petén in the early 16th century, he met with an Itza king identified by the name Kan Ek'. The Itza were not contacted again until the early 17th century when Franciscan friars were initially welcomed by the current Aj Kan Ek' before being expelled. This was followed by several incidents in which attempts to interact with the Itza resulted in the slaughter of the Spanish and their Maya converts, resulting in a long lull before attempts were resumed with a new Kan Ek' in the closing years of the 17th century. These culminated in a bloody battle, after which the last Kan Ek' was captured; he spent the rest of his life under arrest in the colonial capital of the Captaincy General of Guatemala."

  "text" : "Karl Binz (1 July 1832 - 11 January 1913) was a German physician and pharmacologist born in Bernkastel. He is known for his investigations on the pharmacological properties and effects of quinine. He studied at the Universities of Würzburg and Bonn, later working at the University of Berlin in the pathological institute of Rudolf Virchow (1821-1902) and at the clinic of Friedrich Theodor von Frerichs (1819-1885). In 1868 he became an associate professor at Bonn, and several years later founded its pharmacological institute (1873). In 1885/86 he was university rector. During the Austro-Prussian War (1866) and Franco-Prussian War (1870-71) he served as a staff physician. In 1867 he discovered that quinine was highly toxic to micro-organisms in impure water, and demonstrated that quinine hydrochlorate with neutral or slightly basic reaction was an effective poison for the protoplasms of decomposing plants and impeded many fermenting and putrid processes. In addition to his research of quinine, he performed extensive pharmacological tests on arsenic, halogens and associated compounds, sleep-inducing substances, et al. The eponymous \"Binz' test\" is a qualitative test for the presence of quinine in urine."

  "text" : "Kim Seung-jun (Hangul: 김승준; born October 17, 1967) is a South Korean voice actor. Kim was born and raised in Seoul, South Korea. In 1990, he debuted as a voice actor by joining Korean Broadcasting System's voice acting division. After four years of exclusive work at KBS, he became a freelancer. In the late 1990s, Kim shot to stardom with voicing Zelgadis Greywords on Slayers, and Kaede Rukawa on Slam Dunk. Since then, he has voiced leading roles in a variety of animated works including Pet Shop of Horrors, His and Her Circumstances, Saiyuki, Fruits Basket, The Prince of Tennis, Detective School Q, and Demon King from Today!. For movie fans, he is well recognized for covering film stars such as Brad Pitt, Christian Bale, Cillian Murphy, Johnny Depp, Leslie Cheung, Matt Damon, and Stephen Chow. Kim also dubbed Saladin on a 1999 South Korean role-playing video game The War of Genesis III. Many fans of Kim often refer to him as 왕자님 (Wang-ja-nim) meaning \"The Prince\". The nickname seems to have been derived from his tender voice, and the characters who the voice actor mainly dubs. Kim is best known for his voicing SpongeBob SquarePants on the Korean dub of SpongeBob SquarePants, Sesshomaru on the Korean dub of InuYasha, Roronoa Zoro on the Korean dub of a Japanese television animation series One Piece, the Tenth Doctor on the Korean dub of a British science fiction television series Doctor Who, and more recently, Captain Marvelous on the Korean dub of Kaizoku Sentai Gokaiger."

Lui performed an experiment in pair programming which confirmed that \"novice–novice pairs against novice solos\" show greater productivity gains than \"expert–expert pairs against expert solos\" (i.e., novices have more to learn that experts). He subsequently worked in technical analysis, where he showed the price behaviour of many index composite stocks is easier to understand than that of the index.

In 1959 he was disqualified to play at Ranking tournament C2 class and played for free at Shoreikai until his retirement. He retired as 4dan in 1972.

A career engineers officer, Maniadakis resigned from the army in 1929. In 1936, dictator Ioannis Metaxas appointed him to head the Under-Ministry of Public Security. During his tenure, he managed to almost completely suppress and disorganize the Communist Party of Greece, imprisoning hundreds of its members and even publishing a government-controlled rival version of the party's newspaper, Rizospastis. Maniadakis as a Security Minister was regarded to be highly efficient against Communist policies in Greece. Following the German invasion of Greece, he continued in office in the early months of the Greek government in exile as Interior Minister, but was soon forced to resign. After World War II, he was elected several times to the Hellenic Parliament."

Hobbs was ordained in 1958 and was an assistant curate of Clewer, Berkshire and, in 1960, moved to St Anne’s Soho. He and his wife, Mary, were both appointed lecturers at the Borough Teacher Training College, where they remained until both were made redundant in 1978. During that time he also assisted at St Stephen’s Church in Gloucester Road, Kensington, where T. S. Eliot worshipped. He then joined the staff of the Bishop of Chichester as a domestic chaplain and, in 1981, was appointed the Archdeacon of Chichester, serving in the post for 10 years until his retirement. Hobbs married the historian Mary Ruderman in Wolverhampton in 1950. They had three children, one of whom died young."

Capitalism requires failure and bankruptcy as a consequence in order to guide behavior. As the old adage does: ‘Capitalism without bankruptcy is like Christianity without hell.’ If we cannot allow a firm to go bankrupt, then we should regulate its activities so that it cannot engage in the sort of risky transactions that put it as risk of bankruptcy. To be clear, we should not prevent all firms from taking on leverage or engaging in risky behavior; we must ensure that they are not allowed to become Too Big To Fail.", "A small number of people—more than ten, fewer than twenty—made a straightforward bet against the entire multi-trillion-dollar subprime mortgage market, and, by extension, the global financial system.

Karetai died in 1860 and was buried at Otakou marae. Several of Karetai's whanau also became prominent figures, notably son Timoti Karetai (d. 1893), a notable tribal leader, and Timoti's daughter-in-law Maaki Karetai (1868-1945), a tireless worker for the people — both Māori and non-Māori — of Otago Peninsula."

  "text" : "Khader Adnan Mohammad Musa (Arabic: خضر عدنان محمد موسى; born on 24 March 1978) is a senior member of the Palestinian Islamist organization Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) and a prisoner in Israel. He has been held in prison 10 times under administrative detention, a procedure which allows Israel to detain people for periods of 6 months, each renewable, without the filing of charges or a trial. As of June 15, 2015, Israeli authorities had not laid any formal charges against him, but have repeatedly held him for reasons such as \"activities that threaten regional security.\"A visit by an International Committee of the Red Cross delegation was cancelled after Israel insisted their visit be conducted in their presence, with Khader remaining tied to his bed. He was released on 18 April 2012 after being on hunger strike for 66 days, and rearrested under the same procedure on July 8, 2014. Khader was released in July, 2015. Adnan is widely reported as being a spokesman and leader in the Palestinian Islamic Jihad in the West Bank. His wife says he is not involved in militant activities and is a member of the Palestinian reconciliation committee. The PIJ is designated a terrorist group by a number of Western countries and Israel, and Adnan has been convicted in the past by Israel for being a spokesperson for the group. Though he has been detained several times since 1999 on the basis of alleged activities in a terrorist organization, Israel has never charged him with involvement in attacks on Israelis. He was arrested on 17 December 2011 after midnight. The following day, to protest the conditions of his arrest, Israel's policy of administrative detention and its treatment of Palestinians under Israeli occupation, particularly prisoners, Adnan went on a hunger strike. On 21 Feb 2012 a deal was announced between Adnan and the Israeli authorities whereby they confirmed he would be released on April 17, 2012 and he would immediately end his hunger strike, the longest in Palestinian history. He was arrested most recently on July 8, 2014 and given a 6-month detention order. His detention was extended in January and May of 2015, and on May 5, 2015 he began a second hunger strike. The government of Israel is determined to force feed him, and has drafted a law for that purpose, but the Israeli Medical Association has issued instructions to doctors to not cooperate with any force feeding. Adnan owns a bakery and a produce store in his home town of Arraba, near Jenin in the West Bank. He has an undergraduate degree in mathematics, and is pursuing a master's degree in economics. He is married to Randa Adnan, with whom he had two daughters, Maali and Bissan, prior to his 2011 detention, and Randa gave birth to their third child, Abdel Rahman, and in roughly late 2013, gave birth to triplets."

Born into a family of landowners, his parents were Franciszka and Salomei Przysieckich. Abgarowicz attended schools in Stanislawow and Lviv. He made his debut in the press as a novelist in 1889. He was co-founder in 1901 of the Lviv newspaper Przedświt, and also ran the literary section. He collaborated with other magazines of Lviv, Krakow and Warsaw, such as Słowo Polskie, Gazeta Lwowska (1894), Czas, Nowa Reforma and Tygodnik Ilustrowany. A popular humorist, Abgarowicz wrote in the mainstream genres of Polish popular fiction, romance, and adventure. Many of his short stories and novels were published, most of which centred on the nobility, especially from the Podolia region, featuring young squires leading an active social life. Abgarowicz was also interested in the life of Rusyns and contributed to the popularity of Hutsuls culture in Poland. While his novels, such as Klub nietoperzy (two volumes, the first of which was published in 1892), Polubowna ugoda (1894), and Z wiejskiego dworu (1895), were characterized as being weak, his collections of short stories and sketches, such as Z carskiej imperii (1892), Rusini (1893) and Widziane i odczute (1904), did not receive the same criticism."

  "text" : "Krishna Desai (d. 5 June 1970) was a member of the Communist Party of India (CPI). He was a Member of Legislative Assembly of Maharashtra who represented the working-class Mumbai constituency of Parel, then a communist stronghold. Desai was murdered in 1970, and this was preceded by the burning of the office of the CPI-led Girni Kamgar Union. Hansen considers his murder to be the culmination of the Shiv Sena campaign against the communists. His murder was a sign of a Sena victory in its struggle for the domination of unions and politics in Mumbai's working class district. Desai was stabbed to death on 5 June 1970. He was a sitting MLA when he was murdered. Seven suspects were arrested on 8 June 1970. Nineteen young persons were charged and sixteen were convicted for the murder. The accused were defended by Ram Jethmalani. Bal Thackeray's complicity in the murder was never proven. Prakash writes that those convicted were members of the Shiv Sena According to Dipankar Gupta, the Shiv Sena chief Bal Thackeray congratulated those who killed Desai, declaring, \"we must not miss a single opportunity to massacre communists wherever we find them.\" According to the communists, the then Indian National Congress government had an interest in weakening and driving out the communists, and so it \"supported the incident\"."
