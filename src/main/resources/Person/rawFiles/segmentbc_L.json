  "text" : "Dr. Leonard Jan Le Vann (1 August 1915 – 29 September 1987) was the medical superintendent at the Alberta Provincial Training School for Mental Defectives (also known as the Michener Center) from the years 1949–1974. Although he was born and raised in the United States, Le Vann trained as a physician in Scotland. Throughout his career Le Vann wrote many articles, the majority of which were published during his 25-year career at the Provincial Training School. These articles covered a broad range of topics that include alcoholism, schizophrenia and experimental treatments of antipsychotic drugs. In 1974 Le Vann resigned from the training center, which was due to the Conservative Party of Alberta’s repeal against the Sexual Sterilization Act of Alberta. Furthermore, there has been plenty of controversy about how he ran the school. This controversy has been brought to attention mainly because of the Leilani Muir trial that took place in 1995. Although Le Vann was already deceased at the time of the trial, his name was brought to the court’s attention on many separate occasions."

  "text" : "Lisa Simeone (born July 11, 1957) is an American freelance radio host and writer. She was born and raised in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. She attended St. John's College in Annapolis, Maryland, the so-called \"Great Books school,\" from where she graduated in 1980 with a Bachelor's in Liberal Arts. She began her radio career as a classical music host at WBJC in Baltimore, moving on to WETA in Washington, DC, then to WJHU in Baltimore. In 1996, after ten years at WJHU, she left to pursue full-time studies in The Writing Seminars at The Johns Hopkins University, graduating with a Master's Degree in 1997. Throughout her radio career, she has hosted hundreds of live and taped broadcasts, encompassing classical music, jazz, folk, opera, news, interviews, and call-in shows. She also has extensive TV experience, as a host, interviewer, and guest on news and cultural affairs programs. From 1998 to 2000, she was a regular host of NPR's Performance Today and 'Weekend Edition Sunday. She then became full-time host of NPR's Weekend All Things Considered, a job she held from 2000 to 2002. She left in March 2002 to return to freelancing. Shortly after, she began hosting NPR World of Opera. She also returned to hosting and writing for the independent (non-NPR) radio documentary series Soundprint, which she had done earlier in her career before she was hired at Weekend All Things Considered. In 2007, Simeone began hosting the weekly Chicago Symphony Orchestra Broadcast Series, produced and syndicated by the Chicago radio service WFMT. NPR ceased production of World of Opera in 2010, whereupon classical music station WDAV in Davidson, North Carolina took up production of the series. In October 2011, Simeone became involved in the Occupy movement. Because of this activity, she was fired from Soundprint, on October 19, 2011. The firing was for alleged NPR ethics code violations, which prohibit political activism by journalists, though she was not working for NPR at the time, in any capacity, nor receiving any salary or payment from the network; neither was Soundprint an NPR program. She was also not a news reporter. According to The Huffington Post: Simeone, who lives in Baltimore, said she has been serving with about 50 people on a steering committee for an occupation protest on Pennsylvania Avenue [in Washington, D.C.] that's known as the October 2011 Movement. She said it is not connected to the Occupy Wall Street movement, but that they share similar philosophies. Following Simeone's firing from Soundprint, NPR also stopped distributing World of Opera. WDAV, which produces the show, immediately began distributing the program itself. Simeone remained as host. In addition to her radio work with World of Opera and the CSO, Simeone also does narrations and commercial voice-overs. She has written for Baltimore City Paper, The Urbanite, and The Baltimore Sun and is Beauty Editor at Style Magazine. She also writes Style's blog Glamour Girl. Simeone is a lifelong political activist. One of her current volunteer activities is running the civil liberties watchdog site TSA News, which tracks the abuses committed by the Transportation Security Administration. She lives in Baltimore."

Although she was well known for her very passionate and public relationship with Xu Zhimo, she was a celebrated painter, writer, singer, and actor. She studied under painters such as Liu Haisu, Chen Banding (陈半丁), and He Tianjian. As an artist, she specialized in flowers, birds, and light ink landscapes (danmo shanshui) on long Chinese scrolls. She was also known to write poetry, prose, and fiction, but her writings were never published. Nevertheless, her appreciation for poetry inspired her to create a series of ink paintings in honor of the Tang poet Du Fu, which are displayed at his commemorative historical site. Lu Xiaoman was also a singer, and she debuted on stage after receiving training in the renowned Peking Opera (Jingju). She quickly gained attention from bachelors of wealthy, famous families after her first performance, which led to her rise in fame. In the 1950's and 60's, she worked as a paid artist at the Shanghai Academy of Chinese Painting, but only to produce works for the academy. Even so, she was able to create and successfully sell paintings at Duoyun Zhai apart from her obligations to the academy."

  "text" : "Leandro Prates de Oliveira (born 2 February 1982 in Vitória da Conquista, Bahia) is a Brazilian track and field athlete who specialises in the 1500 metres. He won gold medals in the event at the 2011 South American Championships in Athletics and the 2011 Pan American Games. He started competing at national level in 2006 and that year he came third over 1500 m at the Brazilian championships and set a personal best of 3:42.62 minutes. The following year he won his first international medal at the 2007 South American Championships in Athletics, where he was the 1500 m silver medallist behind Byron Piedra. He ran in both the 800 metres and 1500 m events at the 2007 Summer Universiade, but did not progress beyond the preliminary races. He did not compete internationally in 2008 and 2009, but improved his 1500 m best to 3:40.07 minutes in this period. At the 2010 Ibero-American Championships he won the 1500 m bronze medal before taking the 3000 metres title. He represented Brazil at the 2011 IAAF World Cross Country Championships and placed 73rd in the longer 12 km race. He established himself as one of South America's best middle-distance runners on the track later that year. First he won the South American Road Championship over the mile and then he beat his compatriot Hudson de Souza to the 1500 m title at the 2011 South American Championships in Athletics. After winning the Brazilian title in the event, he was selected for the 2011 Pan American Games. In a highly tactical final, he edged Ecuador's Byron Piedra at the line to claim the gold medal."

He served District 38 in Fulton County and Atlanta, a predominantly black senate district created after the elimination of the county-unit system that same year. Before his term as senator, Johnson was an attorney where he played a role in Atlanta's civil rights movement of the 1960s. He was later a candidate in the 1973 Atlanta mayoral election but received few votes, despite being familiar to voters and having endorsement from The Atlanta Constitution. The position went instead to Maynard Jackson who in turn became Atlanta's first African American mayor."

Along with the merchants, there were colonies of artisans in various parts of Tibet who were engaged in creating Buddhist art. They were major players in the exchange of art styles across the Himalaya. The thousand-year-old Lhasa Newar tradition came to an end after the caravan route linking India and Tibet through Sikkim was shut down by the Sino-Indian War in 1962. Subsequently, the merchants and craftsmen based in Tibet closed up shop and returned home to Nepal for the last time."

  "text" : "Lex and Terry is a syndicated morning radio program hosted by Lex Staley and Terry Jaymes. Based in Dallas, Texas, the show is distributed by United Stations Radio Networks. It is heard during weekdays on 17 radio stations in the U.S. In 2008, Scott Maxwell of the Orlando Sentinel described Lex and Terry as \"testosterone-ladened humor that's often sexual in nature, often crude and sometimes demeaning to women. But, unlike many hosts, they don't seem to take themselves too seriously. They're pretty laid back. Their advice to callers is sometimes amusing (if occasionally cringe-worthy). And I like the fact that they seem to actually pay attention to what’s going on in the real world, even if they downplay that aspect.\" Peter Welpton, syndication director of the show from 1997 to 2010, as well as a news personality, said after leaving the show to work for the Dallas Morning News that it was \"one of the first to stream, podcast, develop its own iPhone app and broadcast via USTREAM.\""

His father was chieftain Drekale and his mother, the daughter of a local chieftain. Raised Catholic, he converted to Serbian Orthodoxy following an agreement with Ruvim III, Metropolitan of Cetinje. Soon afterward, the majority of his clansmen in Kuči followed suit. He participated in the two councils of Serbian Patriarch Jovan II Kantul, in which the Serbian clan chiefs met and planned war on the Ottoman Empire; in the Morača monastery (1608), and in Kuči (1613). According to Mariano Bolizza (1614), he and Niko Raičkov held 490 houses of the Chuzzi Albanesi (\"Albanian Kuči\", a village of predominantly Roman Catholic religion), with 1,500 soldiers, described as \"very war-like and courageous\". They were among the 11 highland villages that actively fought against the Ottoman Empire; others included Vasojevići, Bjelopavlići, Kelmendi and Hoti. He was first married to unnamed wife from Kastrati with whom he had a son Vuko. He then married a daughter or sister of a Bratonožići voivode, Pejo Stanojev Balević, with whom he had four sons: Vujoš, Iliko, Čejo and Mijo, progenitors of dominant Kuči brotherhoods Vujoševići, Čejovići and Mijovići. Brotherhood of Ilikovići was further diversified thus the surname disappeared, whilst Vuko because of the dispute with his half-brothers left for Podgorica and converted to Islam, his descendants being known as Turkovići. He was first succeeded by his oldest son Vujoš as Voivode, but the title was later transferred to Iliko His father Drekale is the eponymous founder of the Drekalovići, a brotherhood of the Kuči clan."

  "text" : "Luis Zambrano (Bailadores, May 1, 1901 - Tovar, August 15, 1990) was an self-taught inventor and mechanic from Mérida, Venezuela. He left formal education after the fourth year of primary school, but soon began to develop an interest in mechanics, enjoying discovering for himself the speed ratios produced by connecting oranges of different diameters and rotating them by means of jets of water. These toys lead him to consider new challenges and discover of physical principles in practical ways. In his Valle Nuevo workshop in the village of Mariño de Bailadores, he empirically and intuitively learned enough about electricity and mechanics to allow him to create about 50 inventions, some of which were commissions, such as a strawberry-peeling machine and a sieve for categorising garlic, and numerous improvements to various different machines, despite having lost his right hand to a saw in an accident in 1977. He developed water turbines used to generate electricity and to move a carpenter's mechanical instruments such as a lathe or plane. His home was the first house in the area to have electric light, which was generated by a turbine of his own design before the national electric company CADAFE reached his village. For that reason, his hydraulic electricity generator plans were widely used in the villages and houses of the Andes. In 1933, when electricity was installed in Bailadores, Zambrano had already built three electric sugar mills. In 1950 he installed a hydraulic turbine in Canaguá, which provided that community with electric light until 1.978. He also provided generators to other villages in Mérida, such as Mucuchachí, San José de Acequias, Río Negro and San Antonio de Estanques, among others. From 1975 Zambrano became known throughout the country due to the efforts of Fruto Vivas and Raúl Esteves Laprea, who created the Luis Zambrano Foundation in 1977 in order to spread the creativity and utility of this inventor's work. The Foundation aimed to stimulate local technology development, founding a school and workshop in Bailadores with everything that Zambrano needed to create and to teach young people in the zone, and creating the Luis Zambrano prize for technological inventiveness, awarded annually by the Ministry for People's Power in Science and Technology (MPPCT), previously known as the National Council for Scientific and Technological Research (CONICIT) In 1983 he was named patron of the 8th Graduating Class of Industrial Engineers of the National Experimental University of Táchira. In November 1984, the University of Los Andes awarded him the title of Doctor Honoris Causa \"for his useful creative work\", the first time that this award had been given to a country man. He was declared an illustrious son of Bailadores, and a street in this Méridan village is now named after him."

  "text" : "Lawrence Brockett (13 August 1724 – 12 July 1768) was an English academic. The youngest of five sons born to Lawrence Brockett and Anne Clarke, Lawrence inherited from his parents Headlam Hall, a country house near Gainford, County Durham. The house was originally built by Henry Birkbeck, Lawrence’s maternal great great grandfather. Brockett matriculated at Trinity College, Cambridge in 1743 from Scorton Grammar School, graduating BA in 1747 and becoming a fellow of Trinity in 1749. Brockett was tutor to James Lowther (1736–1802), 1st Earl of Lonsdale. Lowther later married the daughter of John Stuart, 3rd Earl of Bute. Stuart had been tutor to King George III, and was from May 1762 to April 1763 his first appointment as prime minister. On the death of Shallet Turner in 1762, the King preferred Brockett over Thomas Gray for the post of Regius Professor of Modern History at Cambridge University, a sinecure. Gray succeeded Brockett in this position after the latter's death. Brockett died on 12 July 1768 after a riding accident while returning from Hinchingbrooke, near Huntingdon, to Cambridge. He was buried according to tradition at Gainford by torchlight, probably the church's last nocturnal burial. An ancient foliated cross in the porch of Gainford church, Co. Durham, is superinscribed as memorial to Lawrence Brockett, MA, BD of Trinity College, Cambridge. \"Professor Brockett was the last person who was buried, according to the custom of the family, by night and with torchlight. There are several persons now living who retain a vivid recollection of the awful solemnity of the scene as the procession moved slowly on with its line of torches down the long and shady lane from Headlam to the last resting-place of the dead.\""

  "text" : "Lodovico Pizzati (born 3 September 1973) is a Venetian separatist, economist and Venetist politician. Pizzati was born in Valdagno, the son of Giulio, one of the earliest members of Liga Veneta (and later of Liga Federativa Veneta), Lodovico Pizzati has been a Venetist throughout all his life. In 1990 he was an activist of Veneto Autonomous Region Movement, his father's party at the time. Shortly after, he went to California, United States to study at a local high school and, then, decided to study economics near San Francisco. Having moved to Washington, D.C., he earned a Ph.D. in economics at Georgetown University and worked for eight years at the World Bank. In 2006 Pizzati, whose wife is an American, returned in Veneto because he wanted his children to learn the Venetian language and to live the Venetian way. From 2006 to 2013 he was a contract professor of economics at Ca' Foscari University of Venice. Since 2013 he returned to the United States as a professor of economic statistics at California State University in Los Angeles, California. A lapsed voter (living abroad for years), Pizzati had voted just twice during his life (Liga Veneta Repubblica in 1999 and North-East Project in 2006) before entering politics. In 2008 he joined the Venetian National Party (PNV) and was the party's president from 2009. In September 2010 Pizzati was elected secretary of Veneto State (VS), the result of the merger of the PNV with other separatist groups. As VS leader he conceived some provoking initiatives, such as the \"Monument of the Entrepreneur\" (exposed in Arzignano in protest to Italian high taxation on business) and the so-called \"fiscal trips\" (bus trips to neighbouring Austria and Slovenia, during which participants had the chance to open bank accounts). In October 2011, after an internal struggle, Pizzati was replaced as secretary by Antonio Guadagnini. In May 2012 Pizzati switched to Venetian Independence (IV) and was elected secretary of the new party. In July 2013 Pizzati, who had lost a key vote during an IV's congress in June, launched Plebiscite 2013 (P2013), a cross-party nonpartisan committee for a referendum on independence, of which he became spokesperson; subsequently, in late August, he was dismissed as secretary of IV. Among other things, Pizzati has been one of the six experts appointed by Veneto Region to fix the rules of standard Venetian language and the official Venetian names of all 581 municipalities of Veneto, the producer of the Venetian version of Clifford the Big Red Dog, and an editor of vec.Wikipedia."

  "text" : "Leopold Thomas Broinowski (28 June 1871 – 26 September 1937) was an Australian political journalist. Broinowski was born in Carlton to ornithologist and artist Gracius Joseph Broinowski and Jane, née Smith. The family moved to Sydney in 1880 where Leopold attended St Ignatius' College, Riverview. He studied at the University of Sydney and graduated with an Bachelor of Arts in 1897 after spending time as a teacher and helping on his father's Campbelltown farm. A strong proponent of Federation, he abandoned his law degree in 1898 to become Edmund Barton's secretary during the Federation referenda. He subsequently became a journalist, writing for the Goulburn Evening Penny Post before moving to Hobart to work for the Mercury, of which he became associate editor in 1904. In 1908 he married Annie Coverdale Sorell, with whom he had two children. Broinowski contested the Australian House of Representatives at the 1922 federal election, running unsuccessfully as one of three endorsed Nationalists in Denison. His early support for federation was tempered by a strong states' rights campaign; his slogan was \"Tasmania First\". Following his defeat he became a returned servicemen's advocate; given the Certificate of Merit by the Returned Sailors' and Soldiers' Imperial League of Australia, he edited Tasmania's War Record 1914–18. As a political reporter he had a sizeable impact on Tasmanian politics and was generally respected across the political spectrum despite his clear conservative leanings. He died from cerebrovascular disease in Hobart in 1937."

DeGive helped organize the Gate City Street Railroad Company in 1881 together with L. B. Wilson, A. M. Reinhardt and John Stephens. In 1884 they built a line which started at the Kimball House and went via Pryor, Wheat and Jackson Streets to Ponce de Leon Springs. The line operated until January 1887, when it was sold. DeGive is buried at Westview Cemetery in Atlanta, GA."

She was the first woman admitted in the University of Basel, where she studied German philology. She met Carl Jung in 1920, becoming one of his first pupils and closest friends. She collected rare books and studied psychology, anthropology, mythology and literature. In 2007, a critic writing for the Spanish newspaper El Pais described Fierz-David as “one of the most notable investigators of analytical psychiatry, one of the group of notable women who worked with Carl Gustav Jung in Zurich and were his disciples, and, according to the professor's wife (in a letter to Freud), “all, naturally, fell in love with him.” Susan Rowland, an authority on Jung and his female acolytes, writes that “the Fierz family and the Jungs became friends” in the 1920s, and that “Jung travelled with the husband while analysing Linda on her unorthodox romantic situation: she was in love with both her husband and an Italian cousin.” Rowland notes that Fierz-David was nicknamed “Sieglinde” by Jung and that she “sought to remedy Jung’s inattention to the feminine perspective.”"

  "text" : "Laurence Bassini is a Stanmore-based English businessman, and former chairman of Watford Football Club who earned notoriety for his red builders helmet. Bassini took over Watford Football Club in a £440,000 takeover on 31 May 2011 when the club's previous parent company Watford Leisure PLC was de-listed from the London Stock Exchange and became Watford Leisure Limited. Prior to taking over at Watford Bassini had been made bankrupt in 2007 following the failure of his business The Fox at Ibstone near High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire, which he blamed on his father. Bassini was bankrupt for about a year and it was during this time that he changed his name to Bassini to have a \"fresh start\". Whilst chairman of Watford, Bassini had been due to meet with fans at the annual Fans Forum on 8 November 2011 but cancelled at the last minute citing ill health. He then cancelled a subsequent local radio phone-in on 22 November 2011, again at the last minute and again due to 'ill health'. Bassini's tenure at Watford will forever be remembered by Watford fans as a period of clown-like incompetence and financial impropriety  culminating in the comical 'Safegate' scandal when just prior to the sale of the club in June 2012 Bassini called the police after an employee refused to hand him the keys to the club safe. He'll also be remembered for always wearing a ridiculous red builders helmet whenever he gave an interview to the local paper. In June 2012, 13 months after he bought the club, Bassini sold Watford Football Club to Gino Pozzo, son of Giampaolo Pozzo and owner of Udinese and Granada. In November 2012 it was announced the $1.5 million Bassini owed to Watford Football Club for 'cash advances' was unlikely to be repaid. In March 2013 an independent disciplinary commission found Bassini guilty of misconduct and dishonesty over financial dealings on behalf of Watford and banned him from being involved in a position of authority with any Football League club for three years. The commission found he had been \"dishonest in his dealings with the league and with his fellow directors\" and \"practised secrecy and deception\" when he told neither the league nor the other members of the Watford board about his secret forward financing arrangements. Following Watford's defeat to Crystal Palace in the 2013 Championship play-off final, Bassini sent a series of gloating texts to local newspaper Watford Observer, reveling in his joy at their loss. He has been described as an 'ugly, arrogant, and pathetic individual' by all that have come into contact with him. After the paper published details of his texts, Bassini made a number of legal threats via his Twitter account, none of which ever materialised. In July 2013 Bassini added to his list of business failures when the High Court ordered his company Watford Leisure Limited be placed in liquidation. In March 2014, Bassini lost a High Court battle against the Russo brothers. The former Watford FC directors claimed that they were owed more than £3.5 million by Bassini. He was ordered to pay the sums of £3.5 million and £135,000 (plus an additional £568,000 in interest and £150k in costs); a total of £4,353,000. He has been told that he cannot appeal. During the trial, in which he was described as 'evasive' and a maker of 'empty threats', the court heard Bassini had made numerous accusations of conspiracies against him without providing any evidence. Among these were that the Russos still secretly owned half Watford FC with the Pozzo family and were orchestrating a campaign against him. Bassini, who had been in court for the whole trial, left before the end after complaining of 'feeling dizzy' following 'a slip' on the High Court steps. In June 2014 Bassini was made bankrupt for the second time. The bankruptcy order was made after Bassini failed to pay the sum of £37,500. During the hearing Bassini claimed not to own any property despite receiving over £1.5 million in cash advances from Watford during his tenure."

  "text" : "Lee Jung Seob (10 April 1916 in Pyeongannamdo – 6 September 1956 in Seoul) was a Korean oil painter. He entered into Osan School and met an art teacher named Lim Yongryeon who had studied art at Yale University and worked as an artist in Paris. He was affected by Lim Yongryeon who emphasized drawing. Born on 1916, He entered Teikoku Art School for Occidental Painting in Japan in 1932 and studied Art in earnest. But he abruptly quit that school and entered Bunka Gakuen (Japanese: 文化學園), which was more fascinated with the avant-garde than Teikoku Art School. He showed Fauvist tendencies and a strong and free drawing style at Bunka Gakuen. Also he met a woman named Yamamoto Masako (Japanese: 山本方子, Korean name (in hangul): 이남덕) who would later be his wife. He graduated from Bunka Gakuen in 1944 during the last stage of World War II, and married Masako the following year. In 1946, his first child was born but the baby died suddenly from diphtheria. At that time, he was preparing an exhibition and making artwork as an unknown artist and the death of his child shocked him. Taking this event, he sent his painting \"A Child Flies with a White Star\", which was inspired by his loss, to the exhibition commemorating the independence of Korea in 1947. Following the outbreak of the Korean War, he didn’t settle one place and instead wandered the country. He took refuge in Busan with his first son, Taehyun, who was born in 1947, and his second son, Taeseong who was born in 1949. But with a fear of the progress of war, he fled to Jeju. However, due to the hardships of life there, Masako left for Japan with his two sons. After that, he never met his family except for a short meeting for 5 days in Tokyo in 1953. He came to Seoul with returning to the capital. He held only one private exhibition at the Midopa gallery in 1955. After that, he suffered from a type of schizophrenia credited to longings for his family and the hardships of his life. In his loneliness, he turned to alcohol and died of hepatitis in 1956 in Seoul. His style was influenced by Fauvism and his themes were very characteristic and indigenous. He made great contributions to the introduction of western styles in Korea. Also he made line drawings with an awl on packs of cigarettes. His works include \"Ox\" (in The Museum of Modern Art, New York), \"White Ox\" (at Hongik University) and so on. To honor his great artworks, in 1995, Lee Jung Seob Art Gallery was built at the center of the so-called \"Lee Jung-Seob's Art Street\" (a part of Olle Route 6) in Seogwipo, Jeju, which holds a geographically significant meaning for many of his artworks in that he left some of the greatest paintings in the history of Korean modern art during his stay at Seogwipo."

Her best known stage parts were Sylvia in For the Term of His Natural Life and Kate in Robbery Under Arms. She also performed many roles from Shakespeare and worked in England. A contemporary described her as a better actress than her sister Rose: Certainly she was the more forceful, physically, and vocally, but she was disqualified for high tragic roles by the fact that she had ridiculously small feet for a well developed woman, and used to walk in mincing and tottering steps in moments when rhythmic striding was needed. An earlier secret marriage in 1889 had ended in divorce and her sister also died young. She married Rolfe in 1893."

He went briefly to China, then to California in 1850, but ended up taking up an offer from some Singapore merchants to trade on their behalf in Sarawak, after a mission to Siam and Cambodia. In 1851 he took up residence in Sarawak and commenced trading mainly in antimony. In 1856, the Borneo Company was formed and Helms was engaged as its manager in Sarawak. During the Chinese Insurrection against Rajah Brooke in 1857, the insurgents proposed making Helms Rajah, but he was instrumental in their defeat. In 1858, he left for the UK, via Bali, to recover his health and negotiate better terms with the Borneo Company's directors in the UK.In London, in 1859, he married, and engaged to return to Sarawak for the Borneo Company in 1860. He and a growing family stayed until 1872, when they returned to Europe via China, Japan, and California. A lawsuit terminated his relationship with the Borneo Company. In 1878, he had a trip to Lapland to investigate mines from the White Sea. By 1881, the family was settled in London, where he stayed until he died in Hampstead in 1918."

He was inducted into the Art Directors Hall of Fame in 1984. Silverstein was born in Brooklyn, New York. He attended Boys High School and graduated from the Pratt Institute with a degree in fine arts. During World War II, Silverstein served in the Army Air Forces, doing graphic design. After the war, he attended the Chicago Institute of Design, where he was exposed to avant-garde design. Silverstein worked for a variety of employers, including labor unions and an advertising agency. He was art director for Amerika, a Russian magazine prepared by the U.S. State Department for distribution in the Soviet Union. In 1952, Silverstein joined the promotions department at The New York Times. He helped make the newspaper more readable in 1967, when he enlarged the typeface. In 1976, he changed the format of the front page from eight columns to six. Also that year, he helped introduce the new weekday sections of the newspaper (\"SportsMonday\", \"Science Times\", \"Living\", \"Home\", and \"Weekend\"). Silverstein was inducted into the Art Directors Hall of Fame in 1984. At the time, Massimo Vignelli said, \"We are affected by all the factors in the environment around us, and nothing is more ubiquitous than the newspaper. By changing the Times and influencing so many newspapers in other cities, we are indebted to him for improving the quality of our lives.\" After his 1985 retirement, Silverstein continued to consult to The New York Times and other newspapers. He was responsible for the new look of 35 regional newspapers as well as papers in Brazil, Kenya, and Spain."

Lovati's scholarship marked characteristics which would later define the development of humanism: an appetite for classical texts; a philological concern to correct them, and ascertain their meaning; and a desire to imitate them. Scholars such as Petrarch commented on his works favorably. Lovati's achievements which survive today are his Latin verse epistles, and his short commentary of Seneca's tragedies."

  "text" : "Louis Volders (fl. 1689–1714) was a Flemish or Dutch painter, who worked from about 1690 to 1713 at Henry Casimir II and John William Friso's Stadhouderlijk Hof in Leeuwarden. There is uncertainty if Louis Volders and Lancelot Volders (March 1636, Brussels - March 1723, Brussels) are distinct individuals. Most paintings attributed to Louis are signed \"L Volders\" on the back, though in one case he used his full name, \"Louis Volders\". Incorrect reading of his signature attributed some of the paintings even to Jan Volders in older literature. Lancelot's activities as a painter were mainly between 1657 and 1675 in Brussels, though a group portrait of city judges preserved in Leuven City Hall that is traditionally attributed to him was painted in 1703. It has been suggested that Lancelot and Louis were father and son, while others argue that Lancelot and Louis were the same person. At any rate, an origin is Brussels is likely, and Princess Henriëtte Amalia of Anhalt-Dessau may have discovered Louis Volders during her visit to Brussels in 1689. Portraits by Volders remain in the collections of his German and Dutch descendants of the Dutch kings and of the Friesian Stadhouders. The Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam own examples of his miniature portraits. His works are in the collections of Eysinga (now in the Frisian Museum) and Sminia (now H. W. Herwarth von Bittenfeld)."

Lelia Tuckett was born in Salt Lake City, Utah Territory to Mormon parents. She attended Morgan Commercial College, a business school in Salt Lake City established by John Hamilton Morgan. In 1875 she married James Perry Freeze. Freeze was a leader in a Salt Lake City ward's branch of the Young Ladies Mutual Improvement Association (YLMIA). In this capacity, she was invited to speak at the Salt Lake Tabernacle on April 6, 1880, at a celebration of the 50th anniversary of the LDS Church's founding. In 1880, Lillie Freeze was one of the founding members of the LDS Church's Primary Association. Freeze was appointed as the first secretary of the general presidency, which was composed of Louie B. Felt, Matilda M. Barratt, and Clara C. M. Cannon. Freeze was secretary until 1888, when she replaced Barratt as first counselor in the general presidency of the Primary. Freeze was Felt's first counselor until 1905, when she was released and succeeded by May Anderson. From 1889 to 1906, Freeze was also a member of the general board of the YLMIA. Freeze wrote extensively for LDS Church publications and published works in the Deseret News, the Children's Friend, the Women's Exponent, the Improvement Era, and the Young Women's Journal. At a conference of the YLMIA in Box Elder County, Utah Territory, Freeze stated that Joseph Smith had prophesied that \"the time would come that none but the women of the Latter-day Saints would be willing to bear children.\" Freeze was the mother of two sons and two daughters. She died at Salt Lake City and was buried at the Salt Lake City Cemetery."

  "text" : "Luo Shaowei (Chinese: 羅紹威; 877-July 4, 910), courtesy name Duanji (端己), formally Prince Zhenzhuang of Ye (鄴貞莊王), was a warlord who ruled Weibo Circuit (魏博, headquartered in modern Handan, Hebei), also known as Tianxiong Circuit (天雄), as its military governor (Jiedushi), late in the Chinese Tang dynasty and early in Tang's successor state Later Liang. His rule over Weibo was originally largely independent, but toward the end of his life increasingly integrated with the Later Liang state, in large part due to his massacre of his unruly headquarters guard corps, which lessened the danger of an overthrow but also decreased the strength of the Weibo army and forced its reliance on the Later Liang state."

In 1916 and 1917, Boyd did not make any appearances, as his club was in recess due to World War I. When he returned in 1918 he kicked 17 goals, to top St Kilda's goal-kicking. He spent one more season at St Kilda before moving to the Melbourne Football Club. He transferred to Victorian Football Association side Brighton in 1922, where he played until 1927, when he accepted an offer to coach Port Fairy. In 1929 he signed with Sandringham, for which he would play 47 games for and kick 101 goals. Boyd was their leading goal-kicker in each of his three seasons at the club. He was also their coach for the second half of the 1930 season."

  "text" : "Hugh Leslie \"Les\" Simpson CBE (3 October 1894 – 7 June 1968) was an Australian farmer and soldier-settlement administrator. Simpson was born at Birchip in Victoria to bookseller Albert Edward Simpson and Ellen, née Campbell. He attended local state schools and received his secondary education at Ballarat and Stawell before working on the family farm. During World War I he enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force (30 June 1915), serving on the Western Front in the 5th Battalion from March 1916. A lieutenant, he was badly wounded in August 1918. After the war he returned to farming and on 1 March 1924 married nurse Barbara Catherine Jane Catto at St Kilda. In 1934 Simpson was elected chief president of the Victorian Wheatgrowers' Association and the following year won the equivalent position in the federal body, serving until 1936. He was a Wycheproof Shire councillor from 1932 to 1946 and was chief president of the United Country Party from 1938 to 1940 and in 1944. He unsuccessfully contested the federal seat of Wimmera in 1934 and the state seat of Walhalla in 1943. From 1935 to 1946 he sat on the Victorian Farmers' Debts Adjustment Board, serving as chairman from 1941 to 1946; he advised the federal prices commissioner during World War II and received appointments from state and federal Labor governments. In 1946 he was appointed inaugural chairman of the Soldier Settlement Commission (SSC). Under Simpson's leadership, the SSC had considerable independence from government and successfully coordinated the organisation of returned servicemen's grants; 6000 soldiers were placed on farms. He retired in 1963 and was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire. In 1968 he died at Hampton in Melbourne; the township of Simpson, near Cobden, is named for him."

She is a 1978 graduate of Lincoln-Sudbury Regional High School and studied at the University of Miami. Her album, Emotional Jukebox, is one of five nominated for the 2012 Grammy Award in the category of Best Americana Album. Her nomination, gained through a voting process on the website Grammy365.com, was discussed on blogs and social networks by members of the Americana music community and unfoundedly considered \"gaming the system\" by some, due to her relatively unknown status. Linda Chorney is a TEDx Speaker.In 2013 Chorney released her first book, \"Who the F**K Is Linda Chorney.\" sharing the crazy experience of her nomination, and plans on making a feature film on the content.Chorney recently became a filmmaker, completing her first documentary, THE OPENING ACT, to be released in 2016. It has won for Best Documentary in IFA, and APMF Festival so far. Chorney, also to her credit has been active in humanitarian efforts, helping erect a bronze statue of Martin Richard, (the 8 year old victim of the 2013 Boston Marathon Tragedy) at Bridgewater State University, through the efforts of her song, Martin."

  "text" : "Linda Rich is a hazzan (also called cantor) who, while only in her teens, became the first female cantor to daven (chant) in a Conservative synagogue (specifically Temple Beth Zion in Los Angeles), although she was not ordained until 1996 when she finally received her ordination of \"Hazzan Minister\" from the \"Jewish Theological Seminary\" in New York. That same year she became a member of the \"Cantors Assembly of America\". The 1984 Olympics were held in Los Angeles, and Rich was chosen as their official cantor; she also sang at the \"1984 World Chassidic Festival\" in Haifa, Jerusalem, and Tel Aviv. An album entitled \"World Chassidic Festival\" was later released, containing among other songs her recording of \"Barcheynu Avinu.\"  In January 2008, Cantor Linda received a Commendation from the \"City of Los Angeles\" for her \"extraordinary talent and accomplishments\". Rich is a fifth-generation cantor from an Orthodox Jewish family. Her father was well-known Cantor Israel Reich (Z'L) of New York and Los Angeles, and both of her brothers, Barry and Brian, are cantors as well in the Bay Area. Together, the 4 cantors concertized throughout the country during the 80's and 90's and eventually recorded their own album entitled \"The Reich Family, Cantors Four\". Linda's daughter, Rachel Reich Freed, plans on one day becoming the sixth generation of cantors in the \"Reich Family\", as they are known. After the passing of her grandfather in March 1999, Rachel was included in the family concerts as the fourth cantor. The concerts were renamed \"The Reich Family, Cantors Three plus One\". Linda is married to Philip Freed of London, England. She majored in Theatre Arts and Music at San Francisco State University, and received scholarships to study acting at the American Conservatory Theatre (ACT), musical theatre at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion, and is also an accomplished classical pianist. In addition to her membership in the Cantors Assembly of America (CA), Linda is also a member of the Screen Actors Guild (SAG) and appeared in minor television roles prior to becoming a full-time cantor."

He was the father of pediatrician Meinhard von Pfaundler (1872-1947), and the father-in-law of pediatrician Theodor Escherich (1857-1911). He studied under chemist Heinrich Hlasiwetz (1825-1875) at Innsbruck, with Justus von Liebig (1803-1873) at the University of Munich, and with Henri Victor Regnault (1810-1878) and Charles Adolphe Wurtz (1817-1884) in Paris. In 1861 he received his doctorate, and in 1867 was appointed professor of physics at the University of Innsbruck. In 1891 he succeeded Ludwig Boltzmann (1844-1906) as professor of physics at the University of Graz. In 1887 he became a full member of the Vienna Academy of Sciences. Pfaundler is remembered today for his kinetic-molecular explanation of gas reactions under the condition of equlibrium. He was the inventor of a number of scientific apparatuses — devices he often utilized in classroom demonstrations. These included a temperature regulator (1863), a Stromkalorimeter (1869), a differential air thermometer (1875), a seismograph (1897) and a distance meter (1915), to name a few. He is also credited with creating a device for optical demonstration of Lissajous figures (1873). In 1863-64 he performed a survey of the Stubaier Alps with Ludwig Barth zu Barthenau (1839-1890), and in 1864 he was the first person to ascend to the summit of the Hofmannspitze (3112m)."

  "text" : "Lydia Mordkovitch (née Shtimerman; 30 April 1944 – 9 December 2014) was a Russian violinist. Lydia was born in Saratov, Russia, on 30 April 1944. She returned with her parents to Kishinev after the war. In 1960, she moved to Odessa, where she studied at the Stolyarsky School of Music until 1962. She then moved to Moscow where she studied at the Tchaikovsky Conservatory under David Oistrakh, later serving as his assistant from 1968 to 1970. During this period, she married and had a daughter, and won the National Young Musicians Competition in Kiev in 1967 and the Marguerite Long-Jacques Thibaud Competition in Paris in 1969. Between 1970-73, she studied at the Institute of Arts. She taught at the Israeli Academy of Music in Jerusalem from 1974–79, when she made her first appearance in the UK with the Hallé Orchestra. She settled permanently in the UK in 1980. Her marriage ended during this period. Her United States debut was in 1982 with Georg Solti and the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. Mordkovitch signed a recording contract with Chandos in 1980, after the company RCA, with which she had previously had a contract, went bankrupt. Her Chandos debut recording contained sonatas by composers such as Prokofiev, Schumann, and Richard Strauss. She was featured in over 60 recordings for Chandos, including works of J.S. Bach, Ami Maayani, Shostakovich and English composers such as Bax, Alwyn, Bliss, Howells, and John Veale. Her Chandos recording of the violin concertos of Shostakovich won a Gramophone Award in 1990. She made numerous recordings with the conductor Neeme Järvi but plans to record the long-awaited Tchaicovsky Concerto were not realised. Mordkovitch became a professor at the Royal Academy of Music in London in 1995 as a specialist in Russian music."

  "text" : "Li Sizhong (Chinese: 李思忠; Wade–Giles: Li Sze-Chung; 2/19 1921 – 1/11, 2009) was an ichthyologist with the Institute of Zoology (中国科学院动物研究所) at the Chinese Academy of Sciences. Throughout his research career, he made numerous discoveries of new fish species (or subspecies), and published many books and research papers describing the fauna and geographical distribution of fishes in China and beyond. He translated and helped publication of the Chinese editions of Fishes of the World (2nd edition, by Joseph S. Nelson) and Fish Migration (a popular science book by Russian zoologist Peter Y. Schmidt). Li was the major author of two published volumes in the Fauna Sinica monograph series, systematically reviewing and describing orders of bony fishes that include flat fish, cod, silverside, pearlfish, killifish, flying fish, etc. in or near China. He had written over 40 popular science articles about fish on Chinese newspapers and magazines, and been responsible for compiling and editing fish-related entries in several standard reference books (including Encyclopedia of China). Starting from the early 1950s, Li helped to initiate and participated in China's systematic surveys of marine fishes in Bohai Sea, Yellow Sea and South China Sea, along China's coast. His scientific career, however, was interrupted in 1957 when he was labelled a \"rightist\" during the Anti-Rightist Movement. From then until the mid-1970s, while his research and publication capacity had been severely impacted by whims of political campaigns and turmoils, he managed to conduct surveys of freshwater fishes in the Yellow River, Ou River and Ling River, as well as in interior regions such as Xinjiang and Gansu provinces. Only until after the Cultural Revolution, he was able to resume normal research activities. In his book Studies on zoogeographical divisions for fresh water fishes of China, Li divided the fauna of freshwater fishes in China into five major regions based on characteristics of fish species distributions, geographic environments and geological histories of these regions. According to his method, the demarcation line between Holarctic and Indomalaya regions in China, as far as freshwater fishes are concerned, lies largely along the Himalayas and Nanling Mountains ranges. This contrasts with the prevalent view of demarcation line between Holarctic and Indomalaya regions along the Qinling Mountains, even though the latter does not extend into Eastern part of China. Freshwater Ecoregions of the World (FEOW), a collaborative global biodiversity project partly sponsored by World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF), cites this book as a source of references in delineation of freshwater ecoregions of China. Two of his books are published posthumously. In Fishes of the Yellow River and Beyond, he described over 170 native fish species and the characteristics of fish distribution in the Yellow River and its tributaries; a collection of his papers and popular science articles, as well as a personal memoir, are also included in the posthumously-published book. Another volume of the Fauna Sinica series which he worked on during his last years, regarding fish species in China within the orders of Beryciformes, Zeiformes, Lampridiformes, Gasterosteiformes, Mugiliformes and Synbranchiformes, is yet to be published."

  "text" : "Ludwig Friedrich Barthel (12 June 1898, in Marktbreit – 14 February 1962, in Munich) was a German writer. Barthel served in the First World War and was a student in Munich. He was later an archivist (German: Archivrat) there. His poems, for example \"Tannenburg: Ruf und Requiem\" (Tannenberg: A Call and a Requiem; 1934), and such stories as \"Das Leben ruft\" (Life Calls; 1935), are influenced by the experience of war, which he made into a cult. Because of such tendencies, he venerated Nazism, which he celebrated in such extravagant hymns as \"Dom aller Deutschen\" (The Cathedral of All Germans; 1938). Barthel also edited the letters of his friend Rudolf Binding (1957)."

His career brought him in Central Africa where he practised tropical medicine but there also discovered the daily problems of the patients. He later lived in the south part of China for two years.Luc Perino has known the difficulties and joys of a practitioner and those of a physician working in a team in various hospitals in the world. In 1990, he resumed his practice in France and then started to teach clinical medicine and Human and Social Sciences at the University of Lyon, highlighting his classes with his broad experience. He plays the medical doctor in the movie \"The Consultation\" shot in 2007 by Hélène de Crecy, a one hour and half documentary taking place behind closed doors in the office of a general practitioner."

  "text" : "Lou Clayton (also Lew Clayton, born Louis Finkelstein; 1890-1950) was an American song-and-dance vaudeville performer, best known for his teaming with Jimmy Durante and Eddie Jackson, as Clayton, Jackson, and Durante, or \"The Three Sawdust Bums\". Before meeting Durante, by January 1921 Clayton and Cliff Edwards, working as a duo, had already achieved the most coveted booking in all of vaudeville, appearing as the headliners at the Palace Theater in Times Square. He'd also appeared in Broadway shows as early as 1916, billed as a single and as \"Clayton & White\". Clayton met Durante and Jackson at their speakeasy, the Club Durant, in early 1923. Clayton became their business partners, writing and performing songs while running the club. After the very popular Club Durant was padlocked by the police for liquor violations and closed, they opened the similar Club Dover and took their show to other nightclubs such as the Rendezvous Club, owned by Gandolfo \"Frankie Marlow\" Curto. There Clayton was the first to hire a young singer, Ethel Zimmermann, later known as Ethel Merman. The trio made their vaudeville debut at Loew's State on Broadway in March 1927, with an act that literally included breaking up furniture. By April 1928 they were headlining at the Palace, breaking the house record for receipts, and making $5500 a week. This led to a tour and bookings in Broadway shows; i.e., Ziegfeld's Show Girl in 1929, and Cole Porter's The New Yorkers the following year. Clayton's only known film appearance is the 1930 Roadhouse Nights. The focus gradually shifted to Durante as a single act, and Clayton became his partner and longtime manager. He is interred at the Home of Peace Cemetery in East Los Angeles."

In 2002 he was convicted of the murders after a six-week trial and was sentenced to life imprisonment with a minimum non-parole period of 17 years. He appealed the conviction to the Court of Appeal; the appeal was rejected and the court increased his non-parole period to 20 years. In June 2013 the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council heard a further appeal, with the decision reserved after the three day hearing. In October 2013 the Privy Council unanimously allowed his appeal, quashed the convictions and ordered a re-trial. In April 2015 a second jury re-convicted him."

From 1899 to 1903 he studied at the Ecole Normale Supérieure in Paris, where for several years he worked as an associate researcher in geology (1903–04) and botany (1904–07). During this time period he served as an assistant in the laboratory of agriculture at the Museum d'Histoire Naturelle under Julien Noël Costantin. He also conducted research at marine biological station in Wimereux with Alfred Giard, as well as at the marine laboratory in Tatihou with Edmond Perrier and at laboratory for plant biology in Fontainebleau under Gaston Bonnier. He performed studies of corn and barley varieties, did analysis of wheat varieties that were most suitable for the pasta industry, and conducted research of tobacco in an attempt to find the best way of producing nicotine. During the summer months of 1905–09 he studied under Hugo de Vries at the Amsterdam Botanical Garden, where he conducted research on mutations and hybrids of Oenothera. In 1909 he was appointed chef de service at the Institut Pasteur by Emile Roux. From 1912 to 1922 he served as a professor of agriculture at the Conservatoire national des arts et métiers, then from 1922 to 1929 was a lecturer in botany at the Sorbonne, where in 1930 he received the title of professor. In 1928 he became a member of the French Academy of Sciences (botany section), and in 1928/29 served as director of the Maison Franco-Japonaise in Tokyo — in this position he met with Emperor Hirohito on several occasions."

As chief test pilot for the Lockheed Corporation's Skunk Works, he was first to fly the Lockheed A-12. A native of Alden, Iowa, Schalk graduated from West Point in 1948, training and receiving his pilot's wings at Nellis Air Force Base, then serving with the 86th Fighter-Bomber Wing in Germany, then completing flight instructor school at Craig AFB and teaching at Laredo Air Force Base in Texas. Schalk graduated first in his class at the Experimental Test Pilot School at Edwards Air Force Base in 1954, becoming an Air Force test pilot assigned to Fighter Operations, testing such aircraft as the F-100, F-101, and F-104, under the command of Pete Everest and Chuck Yeager. He joined Lockheed in 1957, and in 1959 was chosen by Kelly Johnson as chief test pilot for the Skunk Works. As such, he assisted in the design of the cockpit of the A-12 as well as conducting the unofficial and official first flights of the aircraft and contributing to the resolution of initial instability issues. In his role as chief test pilot Schalk interfaced extensively and significantly with systems engineers for the A-12, YF-12, and SR-71, conducting the first thirteen flights of the A-12, the first four flights in excess of Mach 3.0, reaching a top speed of Mach 3.287, and conducting subsequent engineering test flights above Mach 3.0 as engine, inlet, afterburner and other critical systems were evaluated and fine-tuned, with altitudes in excess of 90,000 feet."

  "text" : "Louis Jean-Charles-Marie-Tanquerel des Planches (11 August 1810, Ambrières-les-Vallées – 27 May 1862) was a French physician. He is known for his research of lead poisoning, about which, he is credited with conducting one of the first comprehensive studies of occupational illness. By way of analysis of 1200 cases of lead poisoning at the Hôpital de la Charité in Paris, he reported that the disease was more frequently found in workers who were exposed to lead fumes than those who worked with the solid metal. In his studies he used the term encéphalopathie saturnine to point out neuropsychiatric indications of lead poisoning."

In 1889 he took part in the creation of the modern Mercure de France. He participated in the Le Chat Noir, a nineteenth-century entertainment establishment, and was a good friend of the poets Albert Samain and Louis Le Cardonnel and of the novelist Léon Bloy."

In 1947, he set out for Paris to pursue his dream of becoming an actor, where he found a love for writing instead. Over the span of his career, he published a variety of works, including “a fantastic profusion of novels, short stories, essays, plays, poems and erotica of a particularly distinguished vulgarity that created genuine excitement in the most blase connoisseur”. This writing style resulted in a variety of literary prizes, including the Prix de l’Academie Française for Ebauche d’un autoportrait in 1983; for a collection of poems, Londoniennes in 1985; and for a collection of short stories, Promenades dans un parc in 1987. Calaferte died in Dijon, France on 2 May 1994."

  "text" : "Lloyd August Wilhelm Kasten (April 14, 1905 – December 13, 1999) was an American Hispanist, medievalist, lexicographer, and Lusophile. Lloyd Kasten joined the faculty of Spanish and Portuguese at the University of Wisconsin in 1931 and spent the next 68 years pursuing and promoting research on the language and literature of medieval Spain. He produced, usually in collaboration with other scholars, editions of several works of medieval Spanish literature, and he led the teams of scholars who compiled the most thoroughly documented dictionary of the Old Spanish language in existence today. In addition, he played a key role in promoting and expanding the study of Portuguese in the United States."

  "text" : "Lette Valeska (August 20, 1885 – January 8, 1985) was a photographer, painter and sculptor in the Hollywood community. When her husband's chemical plant was confiscated by the Nazi regime, she left her homeland of Germany and traveled with her husband and daughter before moving to New York City in 1937. In 1938 she left her husband and moved to Los Angeles, where she spent the rest of her life. She began a photographic career of children's portraits and quickly gained notoriety among Hollywood stars. She worked as an archivist for the Pasadena Art Museum's Blue Four Collection. At the end of World War II, she organized a friendship correspondence between children in California and Ryswyck, Holland out of gratitude for Ryswyck citizens' assistance to holocaust refugees. At age 50, Valeska began painting and at age 70 began sculpting. She was featured in the Emmy award winning NBC documentary \"The Heart Is Not Wrinkled\" in 1969. Valeska's photographs were always taken at her subjects' homes rather than a studio, a method she used to capture real people alive in their own environments. Never having been formally trained as an artist, her artwork expresses her soul rather than technical proficiency. Valeska and Galka Scheyer are credited with introducing German Expressionism to the Southern California art scene through her work with the Blue Four."

  "text" : "Lawrence J. Darmour (1895–1942) was an American film producer, operator of Larry Darmour Productions from 1927, and a significant figure in Hollywood's Poverty Row. Darmour was born in Flushing, Queens. In September 1927 he released the first entry in the Mickey McGuire series of short subjects, starring a young Mickey Rooney. This series would run for seven years, through about 23 silent shorts and another 40 sound shorts. They were released through Joseph P. Kennedy's FBO, then RKO Radio Pictures. From 1927 to 1929, Darmour also produced the Toots and Casper series, co-starring Thelma Hill and Bud Duncan. Rooney's popularity provided a base for Darmour to expand into short subjects featuring Karl Dane, Alberta Vaughn, Louise Fazenda, and others, and eventually into low-budget features, using owned studio space at 5821 Santa Monica Boulevard.  The company's first feature was Sea Devils (1931), starring Molly O'Day. Into the 1930s the company began producing a stream of formulaic westerns, serials, and film series like The Whistler, the ten Crime Doctor films, and Ellery Queen. Simultaneously Darmour also began producing for the higher-budget Majestic Pictures, until 1935, when Majestic was absorbed into Republic Pictures. Darmour then arranged a releasing deal with Columbia Pictures, and completely took over its serial unit in 1938. Darmour died unexpectedly in 1942. He is buried alongside his wife Alice at Holy Cross Cemetery, Culver City. The production company continued operations until 1949."

In 1872 he was an assistant at the zoological institute in Strasbourg, where he worked closely with Eduard Oscar Schmidt (1823–1886). In 1873 he relocated to Munich as an assistant to Karl Theodor Ernst von Siebold (1804–1885), gaining his habilitation during the following year. In 1876 he became a professor at the Academy of Forestry in Aschaffenburg, and from 1884 was a professor of zoology at the University of Graz. Here he expanded the institute of zoology and its library. In 1896-97 he was rector of the university. Graff was a leading expert on Turbellaria (flatworms), especially remembered for research of its morphology and biological systematics. He gathered material for his studies on numerous expeditions, which included journeys to Ceylon and Java (1893–94), the Arctic Ocean (1902) and North America (1907). With Victor von Ebner (1842–1925) and others, he founded the Gesellschaft für Morphologie und Physiologie (1907). He was also a co-founder of the Deutschen Zoologischen Gesellschaft. The 1910 International Congress of Zoologists at Graz elected him an honorary president"

  "text" : "Lambert Courtois (also Courtoys, Curtois) (c.1520 – after 1583) was a French composer, trombonist, and singer of the late Renaissance, active in Italy and Ragusa. Details of his early life are sparse. Originally from France, he came to Italy most likely during the 1540s, as several music prints there refer someone of his name. By 1550 he was in Rome, where he performed at the church of San Marcello during Easter Week. He briefly directed the Accademia Filarmonica di Verona after their previous maestro di musica, Vincenzo Ruffo, was discharged for being negligent in his duties. Courtois only served for several months in early 1553. In May he went to Ragusa, modern-day Dubrovnik, as a trombonist in the court wind band. He remained there until 1570. Three further posts are known: a three-year stint in Udine lasting until 1573, and similar posts in Treviso (1578–79) and Vicenza (1582-83). Nothing further is known of his life after his employment in Vicenza. Of Courtois's works, one book of madrigals for five voices and a handful of works printed in other anthologies survive. Two of the separate works are motets, written in the early 1540s, and attributed to \"Lamberto\", who was most likely the composer. The book of madrigals is dedicated to three aristocrats of Ragusa, who were likely students of the composer during his time in that city. Courtois left family behind in Ragusa, including a son and grandson who were also musicians."

  "text" : "Anna-Lisa Öst (1889-1974) was a Swedish gospel singer and recording artist, who was popular with both Swedish and Swedish-American audiences in the 1940s and 1950s. She performed in folk costume and was better known as Lapp-Lisa, a name reflecting her Sami heritage. Anna-Lisa Vikström was born October 8, 1889 in the village of Mark, about 20 miles northwest of Vilhelmina, Västerbotten. In 1924 she married postal worker Johan “Jonte” Öst of Hedemora, with whom she had two daughters: Gun, whom they adopted in 1927, and Siw, who was born in 1935. Anna-Lisa Öst died April 27, 1974 and is buried at Hedemora Church. In 1904 Vikström nearly drowned in a boating accident and vowed to dedicate her life to God. At the age of nineteen she was saved, and in 1911 she became an officer in the Salvation Army. She continued in this post until marrying Johan Öst in 1924. After her marriage Anna-Lisa Öst continued her spiritual work and toured Sweden and the other Nordic countries as a singing evangelist. She was not the first gospel singer known as “Lapp-Lisa”, but she was the most famous one. Lisa Thomasson (1878-1932) had previously gone by that name. Lapp-Lisa had a repertoire of hundreds of songs, many of which she had learned from her mother. She made her first recordings in 1929 and over the years released more than 400 songs in both Sweden and America. Her signature tune “Barnatro” (Childhood Faith) was a hit on both sides of the Atlantic and sold over 100,000 copies. Her autobiography was titled With childhood faith in the world: Lapp-Lisa tells about her life. In 1949, 1954 and 1959 Lapp-Lisa visited the United States, where she traveled widely and recorded numerous songs. On her final trip she appeared in seventeen States and shared her Christian faith with tens of thousands of Swedish-Americans. In 2001 a Lapp-Lisa museum opened in her hometown of Mark. Nearly forty years after her death Lapp-Lisa’s music lives on through the sales of records, CDs and digital downloads on the Internet. Several of her songs also appear on video-sharing websites."

She was born in Dunedin, Otago, New Zealand in 1855 to Mary Lister and Archdeacon John Albert Fenton, but her family returned to Europe for the children's education. After their return to New Zealand Lissie married William Rattray a prosperous Auckland draper. After initial interest in charity work for the St John Ambulance, Lizzie moved on to suffrage and other feminist causes, using her position as a journalist to get her message heard. Writing for the Gentlewoman and the New Zealand Graphic she wrote about employment, education and the franchise. She was elected to the Women's Franchise League and instrumental in opening membership to men. Rattray appears in a 1993 suffrage mural created to celebrate 100 years of women having the vote in New Zealand."

De Luca's breakout role, however, came a year later following her performance in Dino Risi's comedy Poor, But Beautiful (1956) and continued on in the genre, with appearances in Mario Monicelli films A Tailor's Maid (1957) and Doctor and the Healer (1957), as well as in Duccio Tessari's Spaghetti Westerns A Pistol for Ringo (1965) and its sequel The Return of Ringo (1965) with Giuliano Gemma."

  "text" : "Louis Alexandre Mangin (8 September 1852 in Paris – 27 January 1937) was a French botanist and mycologist. In 1873 he became an associate professor at the Lycée de Nancy, followed by a professorship at the Lycée Louis-le-Grand in Paris (1881-1904). During this time frame, he was also a lecturer on natural sciences at the Sorbonne (from 1890). From 1904 to 1931 he was a professor (Chaire de cryptogamie) at the Muséum national d'histoire naturelle, and was director of the museum from 1919 until his retirement in 1931. For several years he was director of the menagerie at the Jardin des Plantes (1920 to 1926). Mangin was a member of the Académie des sciences, the Académie d'agriculture de France, the Académie des sciences coloniales and the Société mycologique de France. His early research dealt largely with plant anatomy and physiology; his doctoral thesis involving the adventitious roots of monocotyledons. With Gaston Bonnier (1853-1922), he performed extensive research of plant respiration, transpiration and carbon assimilation. In the early 1890s he is credited with the discovery of callose, a fundamental substance found in the cell membrane of plants."

However, in the field of poetry, the great Emperor Wudi is more remembered for his great personal grief in his domestic life at the loss of his beloved \"Lady Li\", Li Furen, as recorded in a well-known poem, written from the viewpoint of the persona of Wudi. This is a famous and frequently translated poem into English. One version goes: The sound of her silk skirt has stopped.On the marble pavement dust grows.Her empty room is cold and still.Fallen leaves are piled against the doors.How can I bring my aching heart to rest?"

In 1975, Bloom was cast in the lead role of an American International Pictures drive-in theatre fare, Sixpack Annie, about a \"beer-guzzling, truck-driving Southern belle,\" in a scanty wardrobe. \"Some of the language I use is pretty salty,\" she said. \"That and the nude scene is why they gave it an 'R' rating.\" She also had roles in Cover Girl Models (1975), Hughes and Harlow: Angels in Hell (playing Jean Harlow) (1978), The Main Event (1979), H.O.T.S. (1979) and The Happy Hooker Goes Hollywood (1980). Bloom was cast as detective Mike Hammer's secretary Velda in Mickey Spillane's Mike Hammer and The New Mike Hammer.

Beginning in 1881, Thollon joined the staff of the new Nice Observatory where he undertook a long-term observation program of the Sun using a spectroscope of his own design. In the process, he recorded a solar spectrum consisting of 3,000 absorption lines in the optical band. In 1882, he joined André Puiseux on an expedition to Egypt to observe the solar eclipse on May 17. The same year he traveled to Portugal to watch the Venus transit, but met with disappointment. During the 1886 Mars opposition, he assisted the observatory director, Henri Perrotin, in observing the planet with a 15 in (38 cm) reflecting telescope. Both men reported that they spotted canali on the surface of the planet, apparently confirming the 1877 discovery of these features by Italian astronomer Giovanni Schiaparelli. Thollon died in Lyon, France."

Rustine’s solution was a small disc of thin rubber to stick to the inner tube over the hole. He patented his invention in 1921 and presented it at a meeting of the Touring Club de France in 1922.

  "text" : "Leonard James Matthews (1914–1997) was a British editor, publisher, writer and illustrator of comics and children's magazines, best known as the founder of the educational magazine Look and Learn. Born in Islington, London, on 10 October 1914, he joined the Amalgamated Press as an editorial assistant in 1939, starting as a sub-editor on the weekly comic Knockout under editor Percy Clarke. Matthews persuaded cartoonist Hugh McNeill, then working for rival DC Thomson's comics The Beano and The Dandy, to go freelance and work for AP. McNeill contributed \"Deed-a-Day Danny\" and \"Simon the Simple Sleuth\" to Knockout's initial lineup, and remained a mainstay of AP's comics for the rest of his life; he and Matthews remained friends until McNeill died in 1969. Matthews served in the RAF during the Second World War, and also compiled training manuals for the Air Ministry in London. He volunteered as a fire lookout, and saved AP's offices at Fleetway House from burning down during an air raid. After the war he returned to Knockout, becoming editor in 1948. He featured more adventure strips, including adaptations of classic adventure novels, scripting some of them, including The Three Musketeers, drawn by Eric Parker. He wrote pirate strip \"Captain Flame\" for artist Sep E. Scott, and Dick Turpin serials for H. M. Brock and D. C. Eyles. He was also an artist, drawing strips like \"Daffy the Cowboy Tec\" for Knockout. In 1949 he became editor of a second comic, Sun, acquired by AP from rival publisher J. B. Allen. Again, he increased the adventure content, hiring Geoff Campion to draw \"Billy the Kid\", and introducing new characters like Max Bravo and Battler Britton. In 1950 he launched Cowboy Comics, a digest-sized series repackaging western comics originated for the Australian market, and later became editor of Thriller Comics, which published historical adventure stories in the same format. He scripted several of them, including adaptations of Lorna Doone and Quentin Durward. In the 1950s he became Managing Editor of AP's comics, including the girls' and nursery titles as well as the boys' titles. In 1958 AP was bought by the Mirror Group and renamed Fleetway Publications, and in 1961 Matthews was named Director of Juvenile Publications, and launched several new titles, including Princess, Buster and War Picture Library. In 1962 he launched Look and Learn, a lavishly illustrated weekly magazine inspired by the Italian magazines Conoscere and La Vita Meravigliosa, and in 1965 launched Ranger, which combined educational features with comic strips. He left Fleetway at the end of 1968 to set up his own company, Martspress, packaging comics and juvenile publications like Once Upon a Time for City Magazines. A small man, Matthews liked to have tall men working for him. No male employee(or femalesupposedly)was allowed to have a beard or they'd be sacked. He died in Esher, Surrey, on 9 November 1997."

He donated substantial assets to the Ospedale Maggiore (Main Hospital of Bologna) to build today’s Bellaria hospital. He died in Bologna, aged 55. In 1920, his heirs donated to the Risorgimento Museum and the Gallery of Modern Art (Bologna) a few great nineteenth- century paintings that had adorned the famous Salone del Risorgimento which Pizzardi wanted in his palace.

She was also the first woman to hold a seat as a National Governor of the BBC from Northern Ireland from 1978 to 1985. As a BBC Governor, Faulkner oversaw the formation of the Northern Ireland Broadcasting Council and the launch of Radio Foyle. She further became the chairwoman of the BBC in 1981. She attended Bangor Collegiate School before enrolling in Trinity College, Dublin, where she studied history. Forsythe worked as a journalist, joining the staff of for The Belfast Telegraph in 1947. In 1949, she left the newspaper and became the personal secretary to then Northern Irish Prime Minister, Sir Basil Brooke, at Stormont House. Forsythe married her husband, Brian Faulkner, in 1951 (Faulkner was serving as the youngest MP in the history of the Parliament of Northern Ireland at the time). The couple had first met due to their shared interests in both hunting and politics. After their marriage, the Faulkners resided in Highlands, which is located near the village of Seaforde, County Down. The couple had three children: David, Claire and Michael. Brian Faulkner, was created Lord Faulkner of Downpatrick and introduced to the House of Lords on 22 February 1977. However, he was killed in a hunting accident just days later on 3 March 1977, following a stag hunt. The horse slipped and he was thrown onto the road and died instantly. Lady Faulkner was at his side in minutes having been following the hunt by car. In 1985, Lady Faulkner was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE). Two years later, in the aftermath of the Remembrance Day bombing by the IRA, Faulkner implored the Protestant Unionists to consider a power sharing agreement and \"put the clock back\" and further appealed to the Catholic Nationalists to cooperate with Northern Irish security forces. Additionally, Lady Faulkner worked as a researcher and trustee for the Ulster Historical Foundation. Lady Faulkner died at her home on 20 January 2012 at the age of 86."

  "text" : "Lloyd Mandeno OBE (3 October 1888 – 30 December 1973) was a New Zealand electrical engineer, inventor and local politician. He was born in Rangiaowhia, Waikato, New Zealand, on 3 October 1888. One of his notable accomplishments was the invention and widespread use of \"single wire earth-return\" (SWER) grids for rural electrification in New Zealand. This form of grid uses only a single wire, and made rural electrification dramatically more affordable and commonplace. It improves the standard of living of rural families. SWER is now used in many countries, including Australia, Canada, Brazil and some parts of the United States. In New Zealand, SWER is sometimes called \"Mandeno's clothesline.\" In a history of WEL Networks, Mandeno, who was Chief Electrical Engineer at Frankton Power Station from 1913 to 1916, was described as having a distinguished career designing and building hydro power stations. In the 1965 Queen's Birthday Honours, Mandeno was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire for services to engineering."

Viervant stemmed from a family of architects, cabinet builders and stonemasons. His father, Hendrik Viervant, was the son of cabinet builder and stonemason Leendert Viervant the Elder and married Catharina Maria Otten, the sister of the neoclassical architect Jacob Otten Husly. Also Hendrik's brother, Anthonie Viervant, was a cabinet maker and Anthonie's son Roelof Viervant designed garden pavillons and facades. All these family members have designed some buildings in 18th century Netherlands. Thanks to his family background, Viervant had a good basis to work from. Born and raised in the provincial city of Arnhem, he studied to become an architect with his uncle Husly. In 1768 he was entered into the stonemason guild of Amsterdam, where he lived and worked. He lived at the Amstel and later near Hoge Sluis (1784–1790). In 1791 he was forced to let his inventory be liquidated, because he couldn't fulfill his financial obligations any longer – finally he was able to come to arrangements with his creditors. According to his uncle Husly, Viervant couldn't handle money, and he lived a wild life. In 1798 he became one of the three directors at the City and Public Works Department of the City Amsterdam, after his predecessor had to leave because of his support of the Orange family (this was between the revolution and the inclusion in the French Empire)."

  "text" : "Lilian Bridgman (1866-1948) was an American architect and scientist. Bridgman was originally from Kansas, where she obtained her science degree in 1888 from Kansas State Agricultural College. She then went on to study science at the University of California, Berkeley where she earned a master's degree in 1893. After graduation, she taught physics and chemistry at several schools in California, including the California School of Mechanical Arts, between 1893 and 1912. She was also a writer, authoring short stories and poems which were published in popular journals. In 1899 Bridgman designed her own home near Blackberry Canyon in Berkeley. While building the home, she received advice from architect and friend Bernard Maybeck. The house focused on natural light and a lack of symmetry. The home's exterior features include barn shingles and clapboards. The interior featured local redwood paneling and built-in window seats that were able to be transformed into beds for visitors. After her first architectural experience, Bridgman went to the University of California to study architecture in 1912. Three years later she became a certified architect in California. After World War I, she received her first major commission, the Bioletti House, an Italianate villa overlooking the San Francisco Bay. The project also included furniture design for the home. The 1923 Berkeley Fire created new opportunities for work as well. Bridgman used the Hotel Whitecotton as a meeting place for clients. Bridgman also had clients in Kansas. Some of her buildings include: \n*  Lilian Bridgman House, 1715 La Loma Avenue., Berkeley, California (with Bernard Maybeck, 1899-1900)  \n*  Lilian Bridgeman Studio, A La Loma Ave., Berkeley, CA (1908) \n*  Professor and Mrs. F. T. Bioletti House, 2440 Martinez Ave., Berkeley, CA (1920) \n*  Cannon House, 2629 La Vareda Ave., at Hilgard, Berkeley (ca. 1920) Some of her writings include: \n*  \"Lost Prairie.\" Harper's Magazine, ca. 1910.  \n*  \"Spirit and Flesh.\" Century Magazine, ca. 1899. \n*  \"To A Wayfarer.\" Harper's Magazine, February 1906."

He studied medicine at the University of Turin, obtaining his doctorate in 1828. In 1831 he relocated to Paris, where he subsequently drew a large clientele, both rich and poor. His early written articles appeared in the magazine L'Européen, and due to their social and philosophical content, gained the attention of the learned society in Paris. In 1836 he published \"Le Médecin des salles d'asile\", a treatise in which he maintains that underprivileged children should have the same access to a physician as do children of the wealthy. The same year he released \"L'Exposé et examen critique du système phrénologique de Gall\" (Presentation and review of Franz Joseph Gall's phrenological system), where he disparages the limitations of purely \"materialistic medicine\". Another noted work of his was \"Des fonctions et des maladies nerveuses dans leurs rapports avec l'e´ducation sociale et privee, morale et physique\" (Functions and nervous diseases in their dealings with private and social education, moral and physical, 1840). In 1843 with Jacques-Joseph Moreau (1804-1884), Jules Baillarger (1809-1890) and François Achille Longet (1811-1871), he founded the psychiatric journal \"Annales médico-psychologiques\". During his career he maintained close ties with principal figures of the Italian Risorgimento. In 1853 he became a member of the Accademia delle Scienze de Turin, and in 1864 became a member of the Académie de Médecine in Paris."

  "text" : "Lola Greene Baldwin (1860–June 22, 1957) of Portland, Oregon, was one of the first policewomen in the United States. In 1908, she was sworn in by the City of Portland as Superintendent of the Women's Auxiliary to the Police Department for the Protection of Girls (later renamed the Women's Protective Division), with the rank of detective. Baldwin grew up in Rochester, New York, and taught near there in the public schools. She relocated to Lincoln, Nebraska, where she taught, then married. She, her husband, and their two sons later lived in several U.S. cities, where Baldwin engaged in volunteer social work related to unwed mothers and other young women in trouble. In 1904, when Baldwin was 44, the family moved to Portland, where Baldwin's husband continued his dry goods career. Women's groups such as the Travelers Aid Society, concerned that the Lewis and Clark Centennial Exposition, scheduled for 1905 in Portland, posed a danger to single women working at the fair, hired Baldwin to supervise a project to protect girls and women. Success at the fair led to similar work thereafter and eventually to her hiring in 1908 as a police officer. Throughout her policing career, Baldwin stressed crime prevention and favored reform over incarceration. She promoted laws to protect women, advised other jurisdictions about women's law-enforcement issues, and demonstrated by example that women could be effective police officers. After her retirement from the police in 1922, she gave public lectures for the Oregon Social Hygiene Society and served on the board of the Hillcrest School of Oregon, the Oregon Parole Board, and the National Committee on Prisons and Prison Labor. Baldwin, sometimes referred to as a \"municipal mother\", died in Portland on June 22, 1957 at the age of 97."

  "text" : "Luis Alberto Machado (21 January 1932 – 23 February 2016) was a Venezuelan lawyer, author, Secretary of the Presidency and Minister of Intellectual Development of Venezuela. He was best known for his ideas about the malleability of intelligence. Machado served as Secretary of the Presidency during Rafael Caldera's first Presidency (1969-1974). He asserted, in his books and writings on the subject, that perceived limits on intelligence are false and are primarily tied to upbringing and social conditioning. He argued that through careful environmental stimulation, especially in the early stages of child development, intelligence can be developed indefinitely and exponentially throughout life. As a politician, he stated that a nation's collective intellectual power was its greatest asset. He was appointed Minister of Intellectual Development, a cabinet post created specifically for advancing and applying his ideas with government backing, during the presidency of Luis Herrera Campins (1979–1984). This program was known as the Intelligence Project, and, although given a small budget, resulted in a number of government initiatives aimed at improving educational opportunities in Venezuela. The project was ended in 1984 by the government of president Jaime Lusinchi, but left behind a legacy in authors related to intelligence as Edward De Bono and his experience is cited by others as Martin Seligman and Robert Sternberg."

While at Wesleyan he was chair of the philosophy department from 1967 to 1976, the Kenan Professor of Humanities and director of the Center for Humanities. He had a wife named Helen Patterson, two sons and a daughter. Mink's largest contribution to history and philosophy of history was to emphasize the need for history to think of its published narratives as very similar to other narrative forms, such as fiction. Mink's also asserts that thinking about history as \"a true representation of the past\" gives rise to a great deal of assumptions amongst historians that pose serious problems for history by misrepresenting it and its subject matter. Mink was also important in studying James Joyce's fiction; most notably, his \"A Finnegans Wake Gazeteer\" (1978) documents all the place names in Joyce's Finnegans Wake."

In 1650, he obtained permission from the Emperor to change his family name into of Thurn, Valsassina and Taxis, but then opted for the shorter of Thurn and Taxis or, in French, de la Tour et Tassis. He and his mother were instrumental in the organization of the Imperial postal system. After the end of the Thirty Years' War, he successfully competed against the many postal systems of the German states. He was, however, unable to regain a legal monopoly.

Born in Povegliano Veronese, Del Santo started her career as \"valletta\" in the 1975 edition of Festivalbar. In the late-1970s she obtained her first film roles, mainly in sexy comedy films, and in 1980 she entered the Miss Universe competition. In the early-1980s Del Santo became popular thanks to her participation in successful TV shows such as Antonio Ricci's Drive In and Renzo Arbore's Tagli, ritagli e frattaglie. Del Santo was a focus of gossip columns, mainly for her relationship with Eric Clapton (who dedicated the song \"Lady of Verona\" to her) and for the death of their son, Conor. While he was still married to Patti Boyd, Clapton fathered Conor who was born on 21 August 1986. Conor died in 1991, at the age of four and a half, when he fell out of an open bedroom window on the 53rd floor of a Manhattan apartment building.  The death of their son was the inspiration for Clapton's song, \"Tears in Heaven\". In recent years she has taken part in several Italian reality shows, winning the third season of L'isola dei famosi. In 2006 she wrote an autobiography, Piacere è una sfida."

  "text" : "Levi Leslie Lamborn (October 10, 1829 – June 14, 1910) was an Ohio doctor, horticulturalist, and politician. Born in 1829 in Chester County, Pennsylvania, Lamborn was the son of Townsend Lamborn and Anna (Clayton) Lamborn. Townsend Lamborn was involved in local politics and once ran for governor as the nominee of the Anti-Masonic party. The Lamborns were a Quaker family, and Levi was educated in schools of that sect. The family moved to Ohio when Lamborn was a boy and settled in Salem, Ohio. Lamborn decided at the age of fifteen to pursue a career in medicine. After studying under a local doctor, he moved to Philadelphia for additional training, then returned to Ohio to attend lectures at Western Reserve College (now Case Western Reserve University) in Cleveland. After graduating in 1849, Lamborn moved to Alliance, Ohio, and set up a medical practice. That same year, he married Maria Grant. They would have six children, all of whom were given the initials L.L.L. In 1854, he founded the Alliance Ledger, the town's first newspaper, but sold it a few months later. Lamborn became involved in local politics, running for a seat in the Ohio House of Representatives as a Free Soil candidate in 1858. He was unsuccessful, but was appointed the clerk of the house from 1859 to 1861. In 1866, he retired from the practice of medicine, but remained active in politics. In 1874, Lamborn ran for a state senate seat, this time as a Democrat. He was not elected, but ran again in 1876, this time for the United States House seat for Ohio's 17th congressional district. Lamborn's opponent in 1876 was his friend William McKinley, the future president, who defeated Lamborn by some 3300 votes. In 1874, Lamborn founded a bank with several associates. He also became a trustee of the State Asylum for the Deaf and Dumb. Although he no longer ran for office after 1876, Lamborn remained a popular speaker on behalf of Democratic candidates in the area. Lamborn was a serious student of horticulture, specifically dealing with breeding carnations. He grew some of the first carnations in the United States in 1866. Before a debate in his 1876 race against McKinley, he gave his opponent a red carnation; after McKinley won, he adopted the flower as a good-luck token for the rest of his career in politics, keeping a vase of them in the White House. In 1892, Lamborn published a book on the subject, \"American Carnation Culture\"."

He was awarded the Chevalier of the Star of Africa by Liberian President William Tubman in 1948. In 1951, Jordan became a life member of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. He returned to Kansas City in February, 1952, and was promoted to police lieutenant.

  "text" : "Leonard Haas (February 17, 1915 – March 14, 1998) was an American educator and president and chancellor of the University of Wisconsin-Eau Claire. He served as the university's president from 1959 to 1971 and as the chancellor from 1973 to 1980. Haas served several years on the Eau Claire City Council. Interim chancellor Marjorie Smelstor said: Leonard Haas' stature in the higher education community cannot be overstated. On the national level he played a significant role in the development of the American Association of State Colleges, both as a founder and as a member of several key committees. On the state level his vision and leadership helped shape the UW System, as we know it today. And of course at UW-Eau Claire his legacy is enormous. In particular we remember his commitment to internationalizing the campus, which began when he was chancellor and continued throughout his years as emeritus chancellor. Haas came from the small railroad town of Altoona, Wisconsin, and he graduated from Altoona High School in 1932. He received his undergraduate degree from UW-Eau Claire in 1935, his master's degree from University of Wisconsin–Madison, and his Ph.D. from the University of Minnesota. He did additional graduate work at Columbia University and the University of Southern California. In 1968, Haas was awarded the LL.D. from St. Olaf College."

  "text" : "Louise Plessner Pollock, born in 1833 in Germany, died July 24, 1901 at Skyland, Virginia, was an influential early advocate of the Kindergarten Movement in 19th century America. Born Louise Caroline Frederica Augusta Victoria Wilhelmina von Pless (Anglicized as Plessner), she married in 1850 in Dresden to George Henry Pollock, who was born in Massachusetts in 1829. She is often stated to have opened the first kindergarten in America, but that seminal event actually took place in the home of Margarethe Meyer-Schurz in Watertown, Wisconsin, in 1854. Pollock did open the first kindergarten in West Newton, Massachusetts, in 1863 or 1864, other schools were modeled after her later National Kindergarten and Normal School in Washington, D.C., and she wrote and translated articles, song books, and education manuals about kindergartens which were important to the advancement of the kindergarten movement. Her daughters Susan Plessner Pollock and Wellesca Pollock Allen (an early adherent of the Baha'i Faith in America, who met the son of the Founder of the faith, 'Abdu'l-Baha, during his travels in North America) were also active in the kindergarten movement, and influenced the popularity of kindergartens in Washington, D.C. and abroad. Pollock's husband George Henry Pollock was a prosperous Washington D.C. importer who formed the Miners’ Lode Copper Company in 1845 and with partner Stephen M. Allen, president of the Massachusetts Historical Society in Boston, purchased 5,371 acres of land on Virginia’s Stony Man Mountain part of which was developed by the Pollocks' son George Freeman Pollock and later became the Skyland Resort."

Bluford Branch of the Kansas City Public Library is named. She was the second editor and publisher of the Kansas City \"Call\" newspaper. Bluford applied to the Master of Journalism program at the renowned Missouri School of Journalism in Columbia, Missouri and was accepted. However, during the ensuing enrollment process, she was dismissed because of her race. She was a very close friend of Lloyd Gaines, who similarly attempted to enroll at the University of Missouri. At the time Bluford attempted to enroll Missouri expected African-American students to attend Lincoln University in Jefferson City, Missouri, 30 miles away from the Columbia, Missouri university campus. Lincoln University did not have a journalism program. On October 13, 1939, after trying to enter the University of Missouri's program 11 times, Bluford filed the first of several lawsuits. By 1941 her case had made it to the U.S. Supreme Court which ruled in her favor. After the court ruling in her favor, the University of Missouri responded by closing their Journalism Graduate program, stating there were too few staff members because of World War II. In 1989 the University of Missouri awarded her an honorary degree which she accepted, “not only for myself, but for the thousands of black students” who had faced discrimination."

A skilled climber, he pioneered the use of stretch rail and the use of steel rope to lower one of the rescuers to the base of the wall. He also pioneered the so-called Gramminger seat named after him. One of the better-publicised uses of his technique was during the 1957 rescue of an Italian climber Claudio Corti from the North Wall of the Eiger. Gramminger died in Munich, aged 91."

It is doubtful that Lecho ruled the whole territory now known as Bohemia. It probably consisted of more or less independent tribes, perhaps with some vassalage relationships with the emerging Great Moravia. The creation of early medieval Bohemian state probably occurred no sooner than at the end of the 9th century under Bořivoj, Spytihněv or perhaps even later dukes of the Přemyslid dynasty. The name Lech is also attributed in some early Slavic foundation myths to the legendary founder of Poland."

He entered temple life at the age of thirteen. Due to the Mongol Conquest of the Song Dynasty in China in 1246, also driven by the new trend that Zen monks of the Southern Song Dynasty increasingly tended to voluntarily go to Japan to preach Zen Buddhism, plus the influences of his teachers and friends, he sailed to Japan to preach Zen Buddhism, and later moved to Kamakura, where he took charge of Kenchō-ji (建長寺). after having accepted the invitation of Hōjō Tokiyori (北条時頼) in 1253. His calligraphy was famous in Japan, especially Rule of Zen (法语规则). Daolong died in Kenchō-ji, and was given the Posthumous Name as Dajue Zen Master (大覚禅師, Daikaku Zenji in Japanese) by Emperor Go-Uda (後宇多天皇).

He was on friendly terms with Grand Duke Alexander Alexandrovich and held the post of Stallmeister (stable master) at his court. His son Leonid (1881-1968) was a noted composer and music critic. Leonid P. Sabaneyev set up Hunter's Gazette (Охотничья газета) in 1888 and was the author of the enormously popular Hunter's Calendar featuring valuable practical information. His work Freshwater Fishes and Fishing in Russia (1875) is considered a minor classic. His correspondence with Charles Darwin, Ivan Turgenev, and Albert I of Monaco has been published. It was Sabaneyev who set up an exclusive hunting club in Moscow and conducted the first national survey of hunting.

Kasatkina's breakthrough film role was a tiger tamer in Tiger Girl (1954) where she was doubled by Margarita Nazarova, a professionally trained tiger handler. She also appeared in such film adaptations as The Taming of the Shrew (1961) and The Darling (1966, after Chekhov). Kasatkina was named a People's Artist of the USSR in 1975 and was awarded the Order For Merit to the Fatherland 2 class in 2010. She outlived her husband Kolosov by only 11 days. The couple were buried in the Novodevichy Cemetery."
