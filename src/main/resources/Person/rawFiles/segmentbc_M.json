  "text" : "Michael Schmidt is a Canadian dairy farmer and advocate for raw milk. His story is documented in the film Milk War. Milk War is a story about Michael Schmidt’s battle to legalize the sale of unpasteurized milk. In defiance of the law Schmidt has supplied his neighbours with raw milk for over 20 years. On November 21, 2006 Schmidt’s farm was raided by armed officers, his equipment was seized, all dairy products were destroyed and Michael was charged with 20 criminal offences for distributing unpasteurized milk. On October 18, 2011, he delivered a letter to Ontario Premier Dalton McGuinty requesting a dialog to discuss the right of people to buy food directly from farmers. Raised in Germany with a Masters in Agriculture, he practices biodynamic principles of farming on his farm, Glencolton, in Durham, Ontario, which he and his wife purchased in 1983. The Schmidt's farm was raided when the government heard about Schmidt's cowsharing program in 1994 and again in 2006. Court proceedings in Newmarket, Ontario on March 16, 2016 took place. Tentative schedule that was agreed in court on March 16th, could happen as early as Sept. 27th, 2016 in Newmarket again. In 2008, he was found guilty of contempt of court for ignoring a court order. He appealed the charges. In 2010, he represented himself in court and the judge, Paul Kowarsky, agreed with Schmidt and dropped all of the charges. The Ontario government appealed. In September 2011, the acquittal was overturned. His farming operations have continued following the latest judgement. Schmidt plans to appeal. In the meantime, his latest fight involves him undergoing a hunger strike, which began on September 29, 2011 and ended on November 4, 2011. He plans to continue his hunger strike until Ontario's Premier, Dalton McGuinty, agrees to meet with him."

  "text" : "Maurice Greiffenhagen RA (London 15 December 1862 – 26 December 1931) was a British painter and Royal Academician. He illustrated books and designed posters as well as painting idyllic landscapes. Exhibiting at the Royal Academy of Arts from 1884, he was made an Associate Member in 1916 and a Royal Academician in 1922. From 1906 until 1926, he taught at the Glasgow School of Art. His friendship with H Rider Haggard led to him illustrating the author's popular adventure books, starting with an edition of She: A History of Adventure in 1889 - though Greiffenhagen apparently \"disliked doing black-and-white work\". Greiffenhagen's 1891 painting, An Idyll, inspired D H Lawrence's novel The White Peacock. The painting had \"a profound effect\" on the author, who wrote: As for Greiffenhagen's 'Idyll', it moves me almost as if I were in love myself. Under its intoxication, I have flirted madly this Christmas. In 1910, Greiffenhagen illustrated a book of poems by Charles F. Parsons entitled Some Thoughts at Eventide. Greiffenhagen also created distinctive commercial posters, including a colourful 1894 advertisement for Pall Mall Budget magazine which \"created a distinct sensation among the younger men\" according to one contemporary periodical. In 1924, he created 'The Gateway of the North', one of the most popular travel posters in a series commissioned by London, Midland and Scottish Railway."

  "text" : "Mian Muhammad Azhar (Urdu: میاں محمد اظہر‎) is a senior Pakistani politician representing Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf. He Is from a noble Arain family of Lahore Pakistan. He remains a major political player in Lahore . He is a former governor of Punjab (1990-1992) and the founder of PML-Q, of which he was also president until retiring from politics. Azhar was mayor of Lahore between 1987-1991. Being a close aide of Nawaz Sharif in past, he was also awarded the NA ticket from NA-95, the seat vacated by Nawaz Sharif after the 1988 polls. Azhar also remained victorious in those elections as the candidate of Islami Jamhoori Ittehad. In 1990, after the dismissal of Benazir Bhutto s first government, he replaced Gen (Rtd) Tikka Khan and became the governor of Punjab and held the office till 1992.He, however, left the office, which Muslim League insiders, said was due to the differences with Sharifs. In 1997 once again, he got elected as MNA on PML-N ticket from NA-92. His relations with Sharifs got bitter gradually and finally with the dismissal of Nawaz Sharif s government, he became the head of a new Muslim League called PML-Q. In the 2002 polls, while he was dubbed as the strongest candidate for the slot of prime minister, he, in a dramatic way, lost NA elections from both seats of Lahore and Sheikhupura whereas his party managed to form government in the Centre and two provinces amid charges of massive rigging.His defeat in elections eventually resulted in slipping of the Party chair slot from his hands. He once again tried to make a comeback in the 2008 polls but could not win the polls."

Her third short story collection, Desire Lines: Stories of Love and Geography, was published by Oberon Press in November 2013. It received a starred review in the January–February 2014 Quill and Quire: This collection is not to be missed,\" writes reviewer Joy Parks. Her most recent non-fiction book is Making Waves: The Continuing Portuguese Adventure (Véhicule Press, Fall 2010). Her novel, The Violets of Usambara (Cormorant Books, March 2008), was supported by a grant from the Conseil des arts et des lettres du Québec which allowed her to do research in East Africa. That experience also shows up in her book Green City: People, Nature and Urban Places (Véhicule Press). Tanga, Tanzania, the gateway to the East Usambara Mountains, is one of the 11 cities she uses in Green City as points of departure for discussing the way people have brought nature into cities over history . This travel, as well as what she did for her non-fiction book The Walkable City: From Haussmann's Boulevards to Jane Jacobs' Streets and Beyond (Véhicule Press, 2008) prompted her to consider the role of the Portuguese over the last 700 years in the European exploration of the world. Their story lies at the heart of Making Waves."

  "text" : "Margo Lomax Davidson (born September 27, 1962) is a Democratic member of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives, representing the 164th Legislative District since 2011. The district includes parts of Upper Darby Township, and the boroughs of East Lansdowne and Millbourne. The oldest of three children, Davidson was born in West Philadelphia, where she and her siblings were raised by their single mother. She graduated from the Philadelphia High School for the Creative and Performing Arts in 1980. The first in her family to graduate college, she earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in Communications from Temple University in 1988. She began her career as a broadcast journalist, hosting a show on WDAS and often covering politics. She also started two non-profit organizations: the Anti-drug and Alcohol Crusaders, which offers programs for children whose parents are struggling with addiction, and the African American Female Entrepreneurs Alliance, which focuses on small business development. She worked on Barack Obama's presidential campaign during the 2008 election, traveling as far as Montana to work for the campaign. Davidson announced her candidacy for the Pennsylvania House of Representatives after longtime Republican incumbent Mario Civera was elected to the Delaware County Council. Civera eventually resigned his state House seat, and Davidson defeated Republican school board member Maureen Carey in the general election. She is the first Democrat, first woman, and first African American to represent the 164th district. Representative Margo Davidson assumed office on January 4, 2011."

In 2014, Ankerich appeared on Lifetime Movie Network's The Ghost Inside My Child to discuss his research into the life and death of actress Lucille Ricksen. He was guest speaker at the 86th annual Valentino Memorial Service in 2013, which included videos acknowledging the 100th anniversary of Rudolph Valentino’s arrival in America and Valentino's friendship with Mae Murray.

Hishikushitja was born and grew up in Onamunama, close to the Angolan border in the Ohangwena Region of Namibia. In the 1970s he attended school at St Mary Mission School in Odibo, where he later also worked as teacher until it was closed in 1979. He spied for the People's Liberation Army of Namibia, the armed wing of SWAPO, and assisted people wanting to cross the border to Angola. In 1979 he took up a position as an English teacher in Engela for the Council of Churches in Namibia. When his political involvement became known to the South African administration, he was forced to move to Windhoek. The Anglican Church sent him into British exile where he completed a Master's degree in education. After Namibian independence Michael Hishikushitja was elected Regional Councillor of the Oshikango Constituency, a position he held until he died. When the National Council of Namibia was formed in 1993, he was one of the Regional Councillors to be elected to serve. He was vice chairperson of the first National Council, and SWAPO Chief Whip of the second. He also was a member of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association, and the chairperson of the Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs. Hishikushitja was married with two daughters. He died from a heart attack shortly before his 48th birthday. Sam Nujoma, then President of the Republic of Namibia, spoke at his funeral, calling him \"one of [Namibia's] most active and effective young Parliamentarians.\""

He remains a presence somehow transcendent and other-wordly, bringing us songs that seem to have always existed, holding up the mirror to connect us to something we can truly love.'"

  "text" : "Dr. Mark S. Gold was the University of Florida Distinguished Alumni Professor for 2011-2014. He was the Donald Dizney Eminent Scholar and was a distinguished professor of psychiatry, neuroscience, community health and family medicine. He is the former chairman of the Department of Psychiatry at the University of Florida College of Medicine. Dr. Gold is a researcher and inventor who has worked for over 40 years to develop models for understanding the effects of tobacco, cocaine, other drugs, and food on the brain and behavior. He created the Division of Addiction Medicine at UF and its treatment program, the Florida Recovery Center. With Drs. Bob DuPont and Tom McLellan, he has studied physician and health professionals who have become addicted and their outcomes after treatment. He has reported on physician treatment since reporting on the sequential use of clonidine and naltrexone in addicted physicians. Dr. Gold has been working on new, addiction-based models for understanding hedonic overeating, food addiction and the development of new therapies. He has done similar work for opiate addiction which led to the discovery of clonidine’s efficacy in opiate withdrawal and cocaine addiction which led to the dopamine depletion hypothesis (Patent #4/312,878). Dr. Gold was Chief Scientist for the Afghanistan National Urban Drug Use Survey which gathered information on second and third hand opium exposure in Kabul and other urban Afghan areas for the US State Department and the Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs. Dr Gold was the Chief Scientist for the State Department's funded study which identified second and third hand exposure to opiates in the body, fluids and hair of children of Kabul and subsequent epidemiological studies of the mothers He has worked on smoking, second and third hand tobacco smoke previously with support from the National Institute on Drug Abuse and FAMRI. He has worked with a variety of government agencies concerned with drug use and youth. Among those organizations are the White House's Office of National Drug Control Policy, Media Partnership for a Drug Free America, the Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse, and the Betty Ford Center Foundation. He has served as a consultant on website design for NIDA: The Science of Drug Abuse and Addiction in 2013 and also is a member of the ASAM Drug Testing White Paper Committee (2013). Dr. Gold is the 2015 John P. McGovern Award Recipient, this prestigious award is given in recognition and honor to the individual who has made highly meritorious contributions to public policy, treatment, research, or prevention which has increased our understanding of the relationship of addiction and society. Along with tobacco, alcohol and other neurobiology of drug addiction studies, Dr. Gold has worked for over 30 years to evaluate the hypothesis that hedonic overeating is a pathological attachment to food like any other addiction. Dr. Gold is a co-editor of the 2012 textbook, Food and Addiction, published by Oxford Press. He is also the author of general audience books and has written over 1,000 scientific articles, chapters, and abstracts published in journals for neuroscientists and health professionals. In a recent interview for the Congressional Quarterly (CQ Researcher) Dr. Gold stated that there is universal agreement that genes can be changed by exposure to drugs. He used the example of a person whose mother smoked when she was pregnant. This person has genetic receptors that were changed because of the exposure, making that person more likely to become addicted to nicotine. Friedman J. Treating Addiction. CQ Researcher. 2014 May 2; 24(17). Intrauterine and early childhood exposure may also change risk trajectories for other drugs and food and become an acquired risk for obesity."

  "text" : "Duchess Maria of Saxe-Weimar (7 October 1571 - 7 March 1610) was Princess-Abbess of Quedlinburg from 1601 until her death. Born in Weimar, Maria was the daughter of John William, Duke of Saxe-Weimar, and Dorothea Susanne of Simmern. Princess-Abbess Anna III of Quedlinburg died on 12 May 1601. The provost of the congregation had died of plague and had not been replaced. Dorothea was suggested as Anna III's successor by the guardian of the abbey, her brother, Frederick William I, Duke of Saxe-Weimar. Holy Roman Emperor Rudolf II confirmed her election on 2 July. Her reign was calm. She proved to be unwilling to confront the abbey's protectors, the Dukes of Saxony, which led to the decrease in her own temporal authority. She died suddenly in Halle, Saxony-Anhalt, on her way to Dresden, and was buried in Quedlinburg. She was succeeded by Princess Dorothea of Saxony."

Prawdin made himself an international reputation with two books on Genghis Khan. The Nazi bureaucrat Heinrich Himmler sufficiently admired the books that he ordered the publication of a one-volume edition in 1938, a copy of which was given to every SS leader; the book appears to have encouraged Adolf Hitler to claim inspiration from Genghis Khan."

  "text" : "Duchess Marie Elisabeth of Schleswig-Holstein-Gottorp (21 March 1678 – 17 July 1755) was Princess-Abbess of Quedlinburg from 1718 until her death. Duchess Marie Elisabeth was born in Hamburg as the youngest child of Christian Albert, Duke of Holstein-Gottorp, and his wife, Princess Frederica Amalia of Denmark. In 1718, she was elected Princess-Abbess of Quedlinburg. However, the Kings in Prussia, who obtained the guardianship of the abbey-principality as electors of Brandenburg in 1698, tried to impose their authority over this small state of the Holy Roman Empire by attempting to influence the election of new princess-abbess in favour of their own relatives. Marie Elisabeth was elected several times during the interregnum, while the abbey-principality was ruled by the provost Maria Aurora von Königsmarck, but King Frederick William I of Prussia refused to consent to each election and Holy Roman Emperor Charles VI consequently refused to confirm the elections. The election, however, eventually went ahead but the selection of a duchess of Schleswig-Holstein-Gottorp instead than a princess of Prussia caused quite a stir. Due to her territorial disputes with the King in Prussia, Marie Elisabeth turned to the Holy Roman Emperor, but without success. As the ruler, Princess-Abbess Marie Elisabeth restored the castle, the abbey and the Abbey Church of St. Servatius, where she was buried upon her death in Quedlinburg. After her death, a princess of Prussia was finally elected and Marie Elisabeth was succeeded by Princess Anna Amalia of Prussia."

  "text" : "Marcel Jovine (1921 - January 20, 2003), was an Italian-born American sculptor who was best known as the creator of the toys \"The Visible Man\" and \"The Visible Woman\". He also created the municipal seal for the Borough of Closter, New Jersey, where he resided. Jovine was born in Castellammare di Stabia, Italy and grew up in Naples, Italy and took courses in drawing while attending the Italian military academy. He was captured in North Africa while serving with the Italian Army. As a prisoner of war in a camp in Pennsylvania, he used his drawing skills to create designs and sculptures. He met his future wife, Angela D'Oro, after having seen her perform on piano for POWs. He returned to the United States to marry D'Oro after he was released following the conclusion of World War II. He and his wife bought a large Victorian-style home in Closter using the royalties he earned from a doll called \"Blessed Event\" that was acquired from him by the Ideal Toy Company. At a workshop in his Closter home, he developed toys that included pirate ships and military vehicles. His anatomically accurate models, \"The Visible Man\" and \"The Visible Woman\", created in the early 1960s, were his best-known creations. Switching over to designing coins and medals in the 1970s, Jovine designed pieces for the 1980 Winter Olympics and for a $5 gold coin issued in 1987 to commemorate the 200th anniversary of the United States Constitution. He also created bronze sculptures of notable horses that were distinguished by their lifelike appearance. Jovine died in Greenwich, Connecticut at the age of 81 on January 20, 2003, while visiting his daughter."

  "text" : "Michel Soto Chalhoub is a civil engineer who pioneered modern practice in shock, vibration, and seismic design using energy dissipating devices [ref]. He developed his methodologies while at the University of California, Berkeley, where he earned his Ph.D. in dynamics and seismic design. He focused his research and his product development projects on critical facilities that are needed to remain functional during and in the aftermath of a major tremor such as fire command centers, hospitals, and transportation facilities. Chalhoub applied advanced structural dynamics to projects such as TITAN IV Solid Motor, Disney theme parks, and offshore docking cells. Chalhoub became well known for his work on fluid-structure interaction as researchers, to-date, use his work as a historic reference on structures and fluids in some of the most seismically active countries such as Japan, Turkey, and Iran. He was awarded the Graduate Student Instructor Award at the University of California in 1988, and the Engineer of the Year Award at the Parsons Corporation in Pasadena in 1990 for pioneering work in applied dynamics to solve environmental problems. His works in 1991 on wave motion and the effect of currents on ocean floor structures was adopted for the design of the Point Loma Outfall extension project in 1992 and 1993, a facility which became known as one of the longest and deepest in the world. A few years earlier, he had completed the design of docking cells subjected to wave and ice loading in Prudhoe Bay Alaska. His projects include The Typhoon Lagoon in Disney World, Florida. He performed the study of this theme park featuring a wave generator made of a twelve-cell prestressed concrete structure discharging in an artificial lagoon. The water is released through steel gates, one at the bottom of each funnel-shaped cell, forming gravity waves that propagate across the lagoon and break on its shore. A few years later, the idea was applied in Japan. While at Parsons, Chalhoub chaired the committee on base isolation at the Structural Engineers Association of California (SEAOC) and developed the simplified design code on seismic design using shock absorbers which was introduced for the first time in the Uniform Building Code in 1990. Simplified code formulas help engineers worldwide adopt and apply engineering concepts in their daily practice, providing effective design, yet without having to burden themselves with complex research derivations. As a member of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, and as a registered Civil Engineer (P.E.) and Structural Engineer (S.E.) in the State of California, he worked as a chief engineer in disaster relief missions in the Loma Prieta earthquake, the Landers earthquake, and the Northridge earthquake, three major natural disasters that claimed lives and billions of dollars in property and public facility damage. Following disaster relief missions in the USA and in other countries in Latin America, in Europe and the Middle East, Chalhoub became interested in issues of public concern especially as they relate to public health and safety. He formalized his public service experience by earning a Master in Public Policy at the Kennedy School of Government, Harvard University, where he concentrated on Business-Government and International Development. His research then culminated in a policy analysis project for the Office of Technology Assessment on Public-Private Partnerships in the Commercialization of Environmental Technologies in which he addressed defense conversion at the tail of the Cold War. His research studied how to transform military research results to find use in civilian applications to better serve society. It was nominated for the Best Policy Analysis Exercise at Harvard in 1995."

Peck was awarded $75,000 in 2007 by NASA's Institute for Advanced Concepts (NIAC) to study how a large fleet of microchip-size space probes in Earth orbit might propel themselves into the Interplanetary Transport Network; and thence as far as Jupiter's moon Europa. This was to be achieved by exploiting the Lorentz Force, enabled by using photovoltaics to maintain an electrostatic charge while orbiting in Earth's magnetic field. Peck has served on the advisory board of Mars One since February 2014."

His new translation of Rilke's Sonnets to Orpheus was published by Enitharmon in the autumn of 2012. Most recent publication is The Time We Turned published by Shearsman Books in 2014."

  "text" : "Miriam E. Benjamin (September 16, 1861 – 1947) was an African-American school teacher and inventor from Washington, D.C. On July 17, 1888 she obtained a patent for her invention, the Gong and Signal Chair for Hotels. The chair would \"reduce the expenses of hotels by decreasing the number of waiters and attendants, to add to the convenience and comfort of guests and to obviate the necessity of hand clapping or calling aloud to obtain the services of pages.\" The chair worked when the person sitting would press a small button on the back of the chair which would then send a signal to a waiting attendant. A light would illuminate as well, allowing the attendant to see which guest needed help. The system was eventually adopted by the United States House of Representatives and was a precursor to the signaling system used on airplanes for passengers to seek assistance from flight attendants."

In October 2002 the United Nations published the Final report of the Panel of Experts on the Illegal Exploitation of Natural Resources and Other Forms of Wealth of the Democratic Republic of the Congo.The report said Karakadzai had the position of Deputy Secretary of COSLEG, which the United Nations described as \"a Congo-Zimbabwe joint stock company ... a key vehicle for military-backed commerce involving mostly diamonds, banking and timber in the Government-held areas\". It named Karakadzai as a key player in arranging a January 2001 deal with John Bredenkamp's Tremalt whereby Tremalt obtained copper mining resources in the DRC at a nominal price in exchange for paying a share of proceeds to the governments of the DRC and Zimbabwe. Some of the payments were to be made in the form of military equipment. Karakadzai was named in February 2004 by the European Union as being among Zimbabwe government members whose assets must be frozen by members and who would be barred from entry or transit by members of the union.In December 2008 Australia added him to its list of targeted sanctions against those responsible for the human rights abuses in Zimbabwe. On 1 November 2005 Karakadzai was appointed General Manager of the National Railways of Zimbabwe.In February 2011 President Robert Mugabe said that Karakadzai would be in charge of his reelection campaign in Harare, at a date to be announced. Sources said this was likely to be a very violent campaign.In May 2011 Karakadzai said that lack of credit from foreign lenders was preventing the National Railways of Zimbabwe from replacing aging equipment. He blamed this on illegal sanctions imposed on the country by the west. He died in a car accident on 19 August 2013 in Matebeleland after his vehicle hit a cow and overturned."

  "text" : "Michael Christopher Woodford, MBE (born 12 June 1960) is a British businessman who was formerly president and COO (April 2011) and CEO (October 2011) of Olympus Corporation, a Japan-based manufacturer of optics and reprography products. Joining Olympus in 1981 and rising to manage its European operations, Woodford was the first non-Japanese person to be appointed as the company's CEO in October 2011, having \"exceeded expectations\" as president and chief operating officer for the previous six months. Within two months, he became a central figure in exposing the Olympus scandal, having been removed from his position after serving two weeks, when he persisted in questioning fees in excess of $1 billion that Olympus had paid to obscure companies (which appear to have been used to hide old losses and appeared to have organised crime connections). The scandal rocked Japanese corporate governance, led to the resignation of the entire Olympus board and several arrests of senior executives, including the previous CEO and chairman, and the company's former auditor and bankers among others, and made Woodford one of the most highly placed executives to turn whistleblower. By 2012 the scandal he exposed had developed into one of the biggest and longest-lived loss-concealing financial scandals in the history of corporate Japan. His bravery and stance in the scandal, in which he understood his life was at risk due to the criminal organisation connections of some of the suspect monies he had questioned, earned him several prestigious awards for \"Businessperson of the Year\" and the like. Following a successful settlement for defamation and wrongful dismissal by Olympus, Woodford now consults on corporate governance worldwide, speaks on human rights, whistleblower laws, and road safety, and undertakes philanthropy; he states he has given several millions of pounds to charities. In November 2012 Woodford published a book about the Olympus scandal, and a film was also underway."

He was also an important 14th century political figure. His political treatise Defensor pacis, an attempt to refute papalist claims to a \"plentitude of power\" in affairs of both church and state, is seen by some authorities as the most revolutionary political treatise written in the later Middle Ages.

He created the roles of David in Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg (1868), Mime in Das Rheingold (1869), and The Messenger in the posthumous premiere of Wagner's early opera Die Feen (1888). Schlosser also sang Mime at Bayreuth in the first complete performance of The Ring Cycle (1876) and in the cycle's first complete performance in London (1882). Schlosser was born in Amberg, Bavaria. He initially sang in operettas in Zürich, St Gallen and Augsburg to little success, and retired briefly to become a baker. However, in 1868 he took up his singing career again and was engaged by the Munich Hofoper. He remained with the company until 1904 when he gave his farewell performance singing the Nightwatchman in Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg. Other roles in his repertory included Count Almaviva in Rossini's The Barber of Seville, Max in Weber's Der Freischütz, Lionel in Flotow's Martha, and the baritone role of Beckmesser in Die Meistersinger.

  "text" : "Mark Rippetoe (born February 12, 1956) is an American strength training coach and author. He has published a number of books and peer-reviewed articles. He has a BSc in geology with a minor in anthropology, but no degree in exercise science. He has several decades of experience as a strength coach, is a former powerlifter, and is currently a gym owner. He was a part of the charter group of individuals to receive the Certified Strength and Conditioning Specialist certification when it was first offered by the National Strength and Conditioning Association, in 1985. He formally relinquished the credential in 2009. He was formerly associated with the CrossFit community as a subject-matter expert in barbell training. He authored many training articles for the CrossFit Journal and created, with Lon Kilgore, the Basic Barbell Certification course, which they conducted from 2006 to 2009. After purchasing rights from Kilgore, he expanded this course into a three-day Starting Strength Seminar produced through the Aasgaard Company in 2010. Rippetoe ended his formal association with CrossFit in 2009 due to personal and ideological differences. He is also known for his particularly brash teaching style and humor, prompting several online compilations of his attributed quotations."

  "text" : "Michelle Bates is an American photographer, teacher and author who specializes in images taken with toy cameras. She has been exhibiting her work, teaching classes and workshops, and writing about photography since 1991 . Bates learned about Holga cameras at the Maine Photographic Workshops in 1991, and she has used them for almost all of her fine art photographs since that time. Because of her extensive use of toy cameras and her knowledge of other photographers who also use them, Bates has been called a \"well-respected evangelist\" for Holgas … the \"Holga Queen\", “The High Priestess of Holganess” and “The Fairy Godmother of the Holga.” One of the hallmarks of her work is her use of the inherent qualities of cameras with inexpensive plastic lens while conveying a clear artistic style. She says she prefers \"quirky subjects, like carnivals and animals\" but also likes \"to push the boundaries and try new subjects\". Bates prints all of her own work in a darkroom using a hand-cut negative carrier that she made nearly 20 years ago. Bates has given lectures on plastic and toy cameras to groups all over the world, including the Society for Photographic Education, San Francisco Camerawork, the Center for Creative Photography, the Photographic Center Northwest and at TEDxRainier in 2011. She has also taught classes at the International Center of Photography, the Newspace Center for Photography and the Maine Media Workshops. Her book Plastic Cameras: Toying with Creativity (ISBN 0240814215) is now in its second edition."

  "text" : "Aurelius/Iulius Marcellinus (Consul 275 AD) (his nomen is uncertain) was a Roman soldier and Imperial functionary who had a brilliant equestrian career (see Roman equestrian order) and was elevated to the Senate when he was chosen by the Emperor Aurelian as his consular colleague. His appointment as Consul is thought to have been a reward for his loyalty and steadfastness in 273 when, as Aurelian's deputy in charge of the eastern provinces of the Empire where the authority of the Imperial Government had only recently been restored, he resisted attempts to suborn him by a rebellious faction in the city of Palmyra. His promotion was unusual in that he had not achieved the rank of Praetorian Prefect, the level of seniority in the Imperial Service at which equestrian officials might hope to be elevated to the Senate. However, this practice, which was to become a regular feature during the reign of Diocletian, was still inchoate in 275 AD. Obviously a man of considerable capabilities who had attracted the Imperial patronage of the Emperor Gallienus and whose services continued to be much valued by Aurelian, the paucity of the surviving records means that even the identity Marcellinus is uncertain while nothing else is known of his life beyond the bare outlines recounted here."

The artist, struck with the singularity of the circumstance and the evident disposition of the boy, prevailed on his mother to entrust him to his care. After instructing him for some time he sent him to Paris for improvement, where he met with employment, and resided several years. On the death of De Corbehem, he settled at Dunkirk, and painted some altar-pieces for the churches in that town and its neighbourhood. He died at Dunkirk in 1741."

His statue of John Betjeman at St Pancras railway station was unveiled in 2007 and the statue of Philip Larkin at Hull Paragon Interchange station was presented in 2010. A bronze monument in honour of Archibald McIndoe by Jennings, whose father was one of McIndoe's patients, has been installed on the High Street at East Grinstead. It depicts a seated airman, his burned hands clawed together, his scarred face turned to one side. Standing behind him, resting a reassuring hand on each shoulder, is the figure of McIndoe. They are framed by a stone bench. In 2014 Jennings completed a bronze statue of Charles Dickens, which was unveiled in Guildhall Square in Portsmouth, the city of the author's birth. In June 2016 two statues by Jennings were installed. The first paid tribute to the women who worked in the armaments industry during the Second World War and was sited in front of Sheffield's City Hall. The second commemorated Crimean War nurse Mary Seacole and was sited in front of St Thomas' Hospital in London. Both of these were unveiled at a time when the paucity of monuments to women across the country was being publicly discussed. Jennings lives and works in Oxford and is a Fellow of the Royal British Society of Sculptors."

She was a long-time vegan in diet, lifestyle, and philosophical commitments, working out her understanding of its implications in every area of our human relationships with nature and its constituents, and she found a wide audience for those deep reflections. Reportedly, she had pursued a raw vegan diet later in her life. Her pioneering scholarship in ecofeminist ethics is foundational for continuing work in these fields."

During her time as a member of the Primary general presidency, Barratt also served as the treasurer of the Deseret Hospital. Barratt was the mother of three children. Her two daughters died in infancy and her son Samuel Barratt died in 1900 after serving as a LDS Church missionary in England.

Qandil went to medical school and worked as a country doctor before turning to writing as a full-time profession. He lived in Kuwait for several years, where he was an editor at the monthly magazine Al-Arabi. He now lives in Canada. Qandil's first novel was called Breaking of the Spirit and dealt with the subject of workers' unrest in the delta region. Another novel Moon Over Samarqand was inspired by a conversation with a taxi driver he had met in Uzbekistan. This novel won the Sawiris Foundation Award in 2006. An English translation of Moon over Samarqand by Jennifer Peterson has been published by AUC Press. His 2010 novel A Cloudy Day on the West Side was shortlisted for the Arabic Booker Prize. Apart from novels, Qandil has also published short story collections and children’s books. Qandil won the Egyptian State Incentive Award in 1988."

While speaking as a Chief Guest this fact was disclosed by his son Damodar Swarup 'Vidrohi' - a revolutionary poet of Shahjahanpur district in the \"Ram Prasad Bismil Jayanti Sangoshthi\" organised by Hindi Academy Delhi on 19 June 1997 at Rajendra Bhawan New Delhi. He was born on 1 January 1901 to Chhote Lal Gupta a khandsari (en. sugar producing business man) of village Mudia Panwar in Shahjahanpur district of Uttar Pradesh. For some times he lived underground in Delhi and later on returned to his native village. He died natural death on 2 April 1982 in his house of Shahjahanpur at the age of 81. He never sat on a Rikshaw throughout his life, for the reason that it was pulled in the city by a man, and being a man himself he considered it unethical to be pulled by a man."

  "text" : "Mathew Charles \"Matt\" Lamb (5 January 1948 – 7 November 1976) was a Canadian spree killer who, in 1967, avoided Canada's then-mandatory death penalty for capital murder by being found not guilty by reason of insanity. Abandoned by his teenage mother soon after his birth in Windsor, Ontario, Lamb suffered an abusive upbringing at the hands of his step-grandfather, leading him to become emotionally detached from his relatives and peers. He developed violent tendencies that manifested themselves in his physical assault of a police officer at the age of 16 in February 1964, and his engaging in a brief shoot-out with law enforcement ten months later. After this latter incident he spent 14 months, starting in April 1965, at Kingston Penitentiary, a maximum security prison in eastern Ontario. Seventeen days after his release from jail in June 1966, Lamb took a shotgun from his uncle's house and went on a shooting spree around his East Windsor neighbourhood, killing two strangers and wounding two others. He was charged with capital murder, which under the era's Criminal Code called for a mandatory death penalty, but he avoided this fate when the court found, in January 1967, that he had not been sane at the time of the incident. He was committed for an indefinite time in a psychiatric unit. Over the course of six years in care at Penetanguishene Mental Health Centre's Oak Ridge facility he displayed a profound recovery, prompting an independent five-man committee to recommend to the Executive Council of Ontario that he be released, saying that he was no longer a danger to society. The Council approved Lamb's release in early 1973 on the condition that he spend a year living and working under the supervision of one of Oak Ridge's top psychiatrists, Elliot Barker. Lamb continued to show improvement, becoming a productive labourer on Barker's farm and earning the trust of the doctor's family. With Barker's encouragement, Lamb joined the Rhodesian Army in late 1973 and fought for the unrecognised government of Rhodesia (modern-day Zimbabwe) for the rest of his life. He started his service in the Rhodesian Light Infantry, and won a place in the crack Special Air Service unit in 1975, but was granted a transfer back to his former regiment a year later. Soon after he was promoted to lance-corporal, Lamb was killed in action on 7 November 1976 by an errant shot from one of his own men. He received what Newsweek called \"a hero's funeral\" in the Rhodesian capital, Salisbury, before his ashes were returned to Windsor and buried by his relatives."

She ran in the 1981 French presidential election and sat at the European parliament from 1999 to 2004, elected on the list of Charles Pasqua and Philippe de Villiers. A Gaullist, she has a very critical eye on the driftage of the Fifth Republic, losing its regal substance as a strong state or a centralized power because of decentralization and the Maastricht Treaty which monopolizes the sovereignty and so makes France an area of the European continent instead of a free nation. She defines a free nation in the capacities to coin (France can't any more because of the Eurozone), to make the law (the European law is integrated in the French constitution and is above the French code), to do peace and war (France returned to NATO's military command under the presidency of Nicolas Sarkozy) and to provide Justice (European Court of Justice).

  "text" : "Marcel Nicolet (1912–1996) was a Belgian physicist and meteorologist. Nicolet was born in Basse-Bodeux, Belgium on February 26, 1912. He received a degree in physics in 1934 after writing a dissertation on the spectrum of O and B stars. and his Ph.D. in astrophysics from University of Liège in 1937. After a few years as forecasting meteorologist he turned to the theory of ionized layers in the terrestrial atmosphere (fundamental book 1945). After World War II he met the most known colleagues at the meeting of the International Union of Radio Science (URSI) at Paris 1946. He came to the United States first in 1950 where amongst other colleagues he met David Bates a scholar of Sir Harrie Massey the well-known physico-chemist. At that time Sir Harrie directed his interest towards the atmosphere. With Bates Nicolet published four fundamental papers. In the following decades Nicolet was often invited to the US but the Institut royal meteorologique de Belgique remained his lifelong scientific home. He became one of the main promoters and finally secretary general of the International Geophysical Year, that due to the participation of all important nations (except China) became a most important scientific exercise worldwide. Nicolet was elected as its secretary general. King Baudouin of Belgium granted him the title of Baron in 1987 for his important contribution to the success of the International Geophysical Year. He received several highly estimated prizes e.g. the William Bowie Medal in 1984."

  "text" : "Malala Yousafzai S.St (Malālah Yūsafzay: Urdu: ملالہ یوسفزئی‎; Pashto: ملاله یوسفزۍ‎ [məˈlaːlə jusəf ˈzəj]; born 12 July 1997) is a Pakistani activist for female education and the youngest-ever Nobel Prize laureate. She is known mainly for human rights advocacy for education and for women in her native Swat Valley in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province of northwest Pakistan, where the local Taliban had at times banned girls from attending school. Yousafzai's advocacy has since grown into an international movement. Her family runs a chain of schools in the region. In early 2009, when she was 11–12, Yousafzai wrote a blog under a pseudonym for the BBC Urdu detailing her life under Taliban occupation, their attempts to take control of the valley, and her views on promoting education for girls in the Swat Valley. The following summer, journalist Adam B. Ellick made a New York Times documentary about her life as the Pakistani military intervened in the region. Yousafzai rose in prominence, giving interviews in print and on television, and she was nominated for the International Children's Peace Prize by South African activist Desmond Tutu. On the afternoon of 9 October 2012, Yousafzai boarded her school bus in the northwest Pakistani district of Swat. A gunman asked for her by name, then pointed a pistol at her and fired three shots. One bullet hit the left side of Yousafzai's forehead, travelled under her skin through the length of her face, and went into her shoulder. In the days immediately following the attack, she remained unconscious and in critical condition, but later her condition improved enough for her to be sent to the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham, England, for intensive rehabilitation. On 12 October, a group of 50 Muslim clerics in Pakistan issued a fatwā against those who tried to kill her, but the Taliban reiterated their intent to kill Yousafzai and her father, Ziauddin Yousafzai. The assassination attempt sparked a national and international outpouring of support for Yousafzai. Deutsche Welle wrote in January 2013 that Yousafzai may have become \"the most famous teenager in the world.\" United Nations Special Envoy for Global Education Gordon Brown launched a UN petition in Yousafzai's name, demanding that all children worldwide be in school by the end of 2015; it helped lead to the ratification of Pakistan's first Right to Education Bill. The 2013, 2014 and 2015 issues of Time magazine featured Yousafzai as one of \"The 100 Most Influential People in the World\". She was the winner of Pakistan's first National Youth Peace Prize, and the recipient of the 2013 Sakharov Prize. In July that year, she spoke at the headquarters of the United Nations to call for worldwide access to education, and in October the Government of Canada announced its intention that its parliament confer Honorary Canadian citizenship upon Yousafzai. In February 2014, she was nominated for the World Children's Prize in Sweden. Even though she was fighting for women's rights as well as children's rights, she did not describe herself as feminist when asked on Forbes Under 30 Summit in 2014. In 2015, however, Yousafzai told Emma Watson she decided to call herself a feminist after hearing Watson's speech at the UN launching the HeForShe campaign. In May 2014, Yousafzai was granted an honorary doctorate by the University of King's College in Halifax, Nova Scotia. Later in 2014, Yousafzai was announced as the co-recipient of the 2014 Nobel Peace Prize, along with Kailash Satyarthi, for her struggle against the suppression of children and young people and for the right of all children to education. Aged 17 at the time, Yousafzai became the youngest-ever Nobel Prize laureate. She was the subject of Oscar-shortlisted 2015 documentary He Named Me Malala. Since March 2013, she has been a pupil at the all-girls' Edgbaston High School in Birmingham. On 20 August 2015, she achieved a string of A's and A*s in her GCSE exams."

Shiell was a member of the Franciscan order, and became the guardian of the Franciscan friary at Killeigh, County Offaly, in 1693. In 1698, eight individuals signed a document acknowledging that they had received chalices, pyxes, cups, an oil box, ciborium, a bell and vestments of the friary for safekeeping. Michael Shiell was one of the eight signatories, as was one William Shiell, who received at least three of the items. Krasnodebska-D'Aughton states that \"both were probably members of the Ó Siadhail family, who had long associations with the Franciscans in the midlands.\""

  "text" : "May El Khalil is the Founder and President of the Beirut Marathon Association. Beirut Marathon Association oversees the annual Beirut International Association, which has been held every autumn since 2003 and was accredited by the International Association of Athletic Federations (IAAF) in 2009. In 2014, the race and social movement attracted over 38,000 runners from 104 countries. Born in Aley, Lebanon, Mrs. El Khalil spent much of her adult life in Nigeria after her marriage to business man Faysal El Khalil. In Nigeria, Mrs. El Khalil became part of an international community and established the Lebanese Ladies in Nigeria, a non-governmental organization dedicated to providing assistance to the underprivileged members of Nigerian society and to promoting educational development by way of grants and scholarships. When Mrs. El Khalil returned to her mother country of Lebanon, she encountered inflamed religious divisions, political impasses and military checkpoints on roads that were once open to all. In 2001 she suffered a near-fatal accident that placed her in a coma. Mrs. El Khalil spent two years undergoing dozens of surgeries that enabled her to walk again. Determined to celebrate the gift of life and mobility, she founded the marathon to help mend divisions in Lebanon. She wanted to shift the focus from that which divides the Lebanese people, and bring them together to celebrate that which they have in common—their love for exercise and their relationships with friends and family. This mission became ever more important in the aftermath of Lebanese Prime Minister Rafic Hariri’s assassination in February 2005, when the bustle of downtown Beirut came to a standstill, the Beirut Marathon Association organize the “United We Run” race that attracted 60,000 runners. Every year since each race that the Beirut Marathon Association organizes unites thousands of people, including national political leaders and royalty, all this in the world’s most turbulent region. Mrs. El Khalil has been recognized for her work nationally and internationally; she has received the AIPS Power of Sport Award in Lausanne, and the Laureus World #Laureus Sport Sports Academy Lifetime achievement award in Abu Dhabi. She has been decorated by Lebanese President Michel Suleiman with the National Order of the Cedar, and has been granted appreciation awards from the Lebanese Ministry of Tourism, The Brazil-Lebanon Chamber of Commerce, and the Lebanese Ministry of Youth and Sport. Mrs. El Khalil was also a Paul Harris Fellow of the Rotary Foundation of Rotary International for 2010 and 2011. In 2013 she was presented with an honorary Ph.D. from LAU (the Lebanese American University), in 2014 She was honoring by YWCA Lebanon on March 8 ( international Women’s day ), Mrs. El Khalil spoke at the TED global conference in Edinburgh Scotland in 2013. There she shared the Beirut Marathon Association’s story with an international audience, and she explained that she founded the largest running event in the Middle East as an instrument of peace through sports. The assertion she made in her talk was that “peacemaking was not a sprint, but a marathon”, meaning that this kind of endeavor was a long race that requires commitment, endurance, and optimal belief in the ultimate goal. For May this optimum goal is peace and prosperity for her country, as she still runs her figurative Marathon towards that goal. To date May El Khalil’s TED talked has been viewed almost four million times on the official TED Youtube channel. In 2014, May El Khalil was invited as a speaker at the European Innovation Convention on March 10. She was also invited by SEAL foundation as guest of Honor for their annual gala Dinner in New York. The Lebanese Franchise Association has chosen Mrs. El Khalil to be one of the four recipients of the “ Appreciation Award”. On July 22, 2014 she received the Fair Play and peace award by the Premio Fair Play Mecenate committee in Arezzo, Italy. In addition to her work at the Beirut Marathon Association, Mrs. El Khalil is a mother of four children and grandmother to four grandchildren. She speaks at different Universities and organizations about the power of sport, perseverance, unity, and making the impossible dream of peace happen through running. She is married to Faysal M. El-Khalil, who is presently the Chairman of the Seven-Up Bottling Company in Nigeria, Tanzania, Ghana and Kenya. Her brother in law is H.E. Mr. Anwar M. El-Khalil, member of the Lebanese Parliament since 1992 and several times Minister between 1992 and 2000."

  "text" : "Michael Prysner (born June 15th, 1983) is an American political activist. He is the co-founder of March Forward!, an organization of active-duty members of the US military and veterans of the Iraq and Afghanistan conflict that encourages current active duty service personnel to resist deployment. He is a US Army veteran who served in Iraq. His rank was corporal. According to him, his duties in Iraq included ground surveillance, home raids and the interrogation of prisoners, and these experiences led him to take a radical anti-war stand. In 2008, Prysner ran a write-in campaign for the US House of Representatives for Florida's 22nd congressional district (Boca Raton). He is a member of Party for Socialism and Liberation. He is also a member of A.N.S.W.E.R.. He performed the rap \"Skit 6\" on the album Soundtrack to the Struggle. Michael was arrested in Occupy Los Angeles in November 2011. He was released after posting bail."

  "text" : "Martina Davis-Correia (May 13, 1967 – December 1, 2011) was an American civil rights activist. She was the older sister of Troy Anthony Davis, a cause célèbre in the campaign to abolish capital punishment. Davis-Correia was a steadfast supporter and public organizer on his behalf. The week before her brother's execution, Correia made an emotional, symbolic gesture in support of him when she got up from her wheelchair. \"I'm here to tell you that I'm going to stand here for my brother today,\" she said. Correia then stood up on stage with the help of others around her. The COO of Amnesty International called Davis-Correia \"a powerful example of how one person can make a difference ... she remained brave and defiant to the core of her being, stating her conviction that one day [her brother's] death would be the catalyst for ending the death penalty.\" the full statement is here. Davis-Correia was a trained nurse and served in the 1991 Gulf War. To obtain a voice in civic society, she turned to organizations within civic society. These included Georgians for an Alternative to the Death Penalty, The Campaign to End the Death Penalty, on whose national board she served, and Amnesty International, where she chaired the Steering Committee for Amnesty International/USA's Program to Abolish the Death Penalty and where, for 11 years, she served as Amnesty International’s coordinator in Georgia for local death penalty programs."

  "text" : "Margaret M. Poloma (born August 27, 1943) is an American sociologist, professor, and author who is known for her research on the Pentecostal movement in American Christianity. Poloma began her career as a sociologist with her research on two-career and child-free couples. Early in her career she wrote a widely used text on contemporary sociological theory before shifting her research focus to the sociology of religion. As a sociologist of religion Poloma has used her personal experiences as a charismatic Roman Catholic to launch various research projects. For over three decades Poloma has written extensively about religious experience in contemporary American society, including studies of prayer, Pentecostalism, contemporary revivals and divine healing. Much of this work has focused on diverse Pentecostal spiritualities (i.e., denominational Pentecostal, charismatic, Third Wave, neo-Pentecostal, etc.), as reported in Charismatic Movement; The Assemblies of God at the Crossroad; Main Street Mystics; Blood and Fire (with psychologist Ralph W. Hood); and The Assemblies of God (with political scientist John C. Green) Poloma's research on prayer (c.f., Varieties of Prayer with the renowned pollster George H. Gallup Jr.) has served as a bridge between Pentecostal spirituality and common spiritual experiences of American Christians through data collected in two national surveys. Through the use of both qualitative and quantitative measures to explore the experiential dimension of religion, Poloma was able to mine research nuggets that suggested religious experience does indeed impact human behavior. For the past five years she has collaborated with some twenty other colleagues in the John Templeton Foundation-sponsored Flame of Love Project (www.godlyloveproject.org) to develop a model of “Godly Love” that demonstrates the dynamic process in which experiences of the divine contribute to a better understanding human benevolence. Major findings from this research are found in Matthew T. Lee, Margaret M. Poloma, and Stephen G. Post, The Heart of Religion (Oxford University Press, 2013)."

Tawara was born in what is now part of the city of Hamada in Shimane Prefecture Japan. The Tawara family had been making soy sauce and candles in Hamada for generations. He graduated from the law department of Tokyo Imperial University in 1895, and became an official in the Home Ministry. He worked as an official in four different prefectural governments over the next eleven years. His first was Okinawa, where he was instrumental in writing laws on land reform and establishing a tax system, bringing the former Kingdom of the Ryukyus closer to legal assimilation with mainland Japan.

After his term expired in April 1931, he continued to play an important role in the Diet and in the general administration of the Rikken Minseitō.

He served as acting president of the University for nine months during 1981 upon the resignation of the university's second president, L. Donald Shields. McCarthy received his B.S. degree from West Chester State College (now West Chester University of Pennsylvania). In 1943 he was awarded a Ph.D. in zoology from the University of Pennsylvania. McCarthy's research in the area of hematological studies of burns and autoimmunity resulted in 35 peer-reviewed publications. McCarthy was throughout his career at Cal State Fullerton a Professor of Biology, who also held several administrative posts at the university including Chair of the Biology Department, Dean of the School of Letters, Arts, and Sciences, and Vice President for Academic Affairs. In his role as a founding faculty member, McCarthy was responsible for hiring the new faculty needed to staff a number of academic departments in the sciences. It was McCarthy who hired L. Donald Shields as a faculty member in the Chemistry Department. Shields became the second president of the university in 1971. McCarthy also established the Health Professions Advising Office at Cal State Fullerton. This office advises students who are seeking careers in medicine, dentistry, veterinary medicine, and the allied health professions. Since its creation, the office has had an 85% success record in placing students who have completed the program in professional schools in the health sciences. Except for the nine months he spent as Acting President, McCarthy continued to teach two classes each semester while holding his administrative positions. In 1984 the Letters, Arts, and Sciences Building on the Cal State Fullerton campus, the first permanent building on the campus, was named in Dr. McCarthy's honor."

Petersen-Perez provoked the Police Chief of Palo Alto into appearing to admit to a policy of racial profiling, resulting in both widespread media coverage as well as activism in cities outside of Palo Alto, then he led a successful campaign leading to her resignation and change in police policy. Petersen-Perez is an outspoken opponent of police misconduct, the police use of tasers, of racial discrimination, and is a local political advocate for the homeless. He has been described as \"one of the most outspoken anti-taser activists\". One story reported that just the mention of his name in a government meeting resulted in a shouting match and subsequent press coverage. When Petersen-Perez used the internet at his employers during his breaks to petition the government, the government repeatedly petitioned his private sector employers to terminate him, resulting in loss of employment in a chain of jobs. Front page image captions and news stories about Petersen-Perez have unusual characterizations of him ranging from \"outspoken\" and \"fervent\" to \"maniacal\". He is frequent speaker at Palo Alto City Council meetings. He is a financial analyst professionally, and analyses taser company finances as an activist."

  "text" : "Mario Bonnard (24 December 1889 – 22 March 1965) was an Italian actor and film director. Bonnard was born and died in Rome. He began his cinematic career as an actor becoming a popular romantic lead in numerous silent films made before World War I. In 1917 he ventured into film directing for the first time. Before the arrival of sound films he worked for a period in Germany in films directed by Luis Trenker. Back in Italy in 1932, he became a prolific director working with the major stars of the time as: Assia Noris, Elsa Merlini, Amedeo Nazzari Luisa Ferida, Henry Viarisio. Il feroce saladino (1937), was the most popular of his films of the 1930s. During the war he continued to work. In the post World War II period his films, ranging from comedies to period dramas enjoyed much success. However, today he's no longer well known. One of his last film was The Last Days of Pompeii (1959). He had to leave production early due to an illness, so the film had to be completed by Sergio Leone."

He studied medicine in Zagreb (Croatia), in Great Britain and in the United States. He also studied languages (Italian, French, German, English and Latin). Later he specialised for hand surgery and held lectures all over the world. In the Medical Centre Ljubljana (Slovenia), he formed and trained a team of surgeons that has become world-wide known after the surgery of amputated extremities. In 1984, he was the first ever to perform temporary ectopic banking of the amputated hand to the axilla to salvage the mutilated upper extremity, which he re-transplanted back to the receiving stump two months later. He was among the founding members of the European Hand Surgery Course. He and his wife Vesna died in a car crash on the road from Zagreb to Ljubljana. The Marko Godina Travelling Fellowship to provide a scholarship for a visiting plastic surgery scholar to visit the centers of their choice including Department of Plastic Surgery and Burns in Ljubljana has been named after him."

  "text" : "Maxwell Dlamini is the Secretary General of SWAOCO and the former President of the University of Swaziland Students Representative Council. During the so-called \"April 12 Swazi Uprising\" in April 2011, he and fellow activist Musa Ngubeni were arrested on charges of possession of explosives under Sections 8 and 9 of Swaziland’s Explosives Act 4 of 1961. They were both allegedly tortured and were subsequently refused bail. They were imprisoned at the Manzini Remand Centre. An international campaign for their release was initiated by Danish NGO Africa Contact, British NGO ACTSA, and the British National Union of Students. Maxwell Dlamini was nominated for the 2013 Student Peace Prize in November 2011, and the 2012 Frontline Defenders Award for Human Rights Defenders at Risk in January 2012. In 2013, he received the All-Africa Students' Union's 2013 Student Activist Award, for ”the role he has played in Swazi and African students' movements.” Maxwell Dlamini and Musa Ngubeni were granted bail on 20 December 2011. Bail was set at 50 000 Rand, by far the highest bail ever in the history of Swazi law. Maxwell Dlamini was released on bail on 3 February 2011. The bail money was collected by his father, Nimrod Dlamini, and local and international solidarity movements. Maxwell Dlamini was arrested on 23 April 2013 in connection with a SWAYOCO rally which was held on the 19th of April in Mbabane. Maxwell was charged with two counts of sedition.

Shortly afterwards he transferred to the University of Graz, where he was influenced by neurologist Gabriel Anton (1858-1933), gynecologist Alfons von Rosthorn (1857-1909), histologist Alexander Rollett (1834-1903), internist Friedrich Kraus (1858-1936) and pediatrician Theodor Escherich (1857-1911), who was also his brother-in-law. After receiving his doctorate he became an assistant to Franz Hofmeister (1850-1922 at Strassburg. He was habilitated for pediatrics in 1900 at Graz, becoming an associate professor and director of its children’s clinic two years later. In 1906 he was appointed director of the university children's hospital in Munich. He would remain in Munich for the remainder of his career. Pfaundler made contributions in all facets of pediatric medicine. He was particularly interested in the diathetic (hereditary and/or biological predisposition to a disorder) aspects of disease. Another focus involved \"social pediatrics\", stressing the importance of nursing, education, hygiene and psychological concerns when dealing with children. In his later research he was concerned with issues such as genetics and natural selection."

  "text" : "Maurice Henry Lecorney Pryce (24 January 1913 – 24 July 2003) was a British physicist. Pryce was born in Croydon to an Anglo-Welsh father and French mother, and in his teens attended the Royal Grammar School, Guildford. After a few months in Heidelberg to add German to the French that had been his first language at home, he went up to Trinity College, Cambridge. In 1935 he went to Princeton University, supported by a Commonwealth Fund Fellowship (now Harkness Fellowship) where he worked with Wolfgang Pauli and John von Neumann, obtaining his Ph.D. with a thesis on The wave mechanics of the photon under the supervision of Max Born and Ralph Fowler. In 1937 he returned to England as a Fellow of Trinity, until in 1939 he was appointed Reader in Theoretical Physics at Liverpool University under James Chadwick. In 1941 he joined the Admiralty Signals Establishment (now part of the Admiralty Research Establishment) to work on radar. In 1944 he joined the British atomic energy team in Montreal designing nuclear reactors, but in 1945 returned to England, first to Cambridge and then in 1946 to Oxford, where he was appointed Wykeham Professor of Physics. Among of his doctoral students were Anatole Abragam and John Clive Ward. In 1947, in collaboration with John Ward, he co-authored a paper that originated on the probability amplitude of two entangled quanta propagating in opposite directions. In 1950, when Klaus Fuchs, head of the theoretical physics group at AERE, Harwell, was arrested for supplying atomic secrets to the USSR, Maurice also served part-time as his replacement. In 1954 he moved to the University of Bristol as Head of the Physics Department. In 1964 he went back to North America, first to the University of Southern California and then in 1968 to the University of British Columbia. From 1968 to 1978 he served on the Technical Advisory Committee (for nuclear waste management) of Atomic Energy of Canada Limited."

In addition to news editorials, he also wrote books, including translations of Greek mythologies. He delved into Science Fiction too, in Sindhi, writing Flaying carpet (Sindhi: اڏام کٽولو‎),and Army of ants (Sindhi: ماڪوڙن جي فوج‎).

  "text" : "Brodkorb served as deputy chair of the Minnesota Republican Party from 2009 to 2011, when he resigned to work for the congressional campaign of Minnesota state senator Mike Parry. Brodkorb abruptly resigned both from his position in the Senate and his position with the Parry campaign in December 2011. Weeks later, Koch resigned her post as Majority Leader after admitting an \"inappropriate relationship\" with a male staffer. Brodkorb was fired the next day. Brodkorb has announced his intention to file litigation again the State of Minnesota, the Minnesota Senate and Secretary of the Senate Cal Ludeman over his termination from the Minnesota Senate. Lawyers representing Brodkorb have announced additional claims against the State of Minnesota, the Minnesota Senate and Ludeman over allegations that Ludeman disclosed private unemployment data about Brodkorb in an interview with Minnesota Public Radio. Brodkorb's attorneys also announced plans to sue for defamation per se over statements Ludeman made in a press release where he accused Brodkorb of attempting to \"extort payment from the Senate.\" On May 25, 2012, the Minnesota Senate released legal bills showing they had spent $46,150 to the first 3 months of 2012 to prepare a defense to Brodkorb's suit. An analysis of the bill by the Associated Press showed the bulk of the $46,150 owed was due to attorneys retained by the Minnesota Senate repeatedly meeting with Ludeman. On June 19, 2012, the Minnesota Senate announced additional legal bills in the amount of $38,533, bringing the total legal costs incurred by the Minnesota Senate due to the termination of Brodkorb to almost $85,000 since the end of the May 2012. A court dismissed a libel suit against Brodkorb and his blog in 2007 in a case that was described as \"breaking new legal ground in the world of blogging\". He graduated from high school in Forest Lake, Minnesota in 1992. He attended both the University of Minnesota Duluth and the University of Minnesota - Twin Cities. On January 23, 2013, Brodkorb was injured in a single-car crash on Interstate 35E when his vehicle hit a concrete wall. He pleaded guilty to driving while intoxicated and was ordered to pay a $500 fine."

For his work he has been cited as Quant Enforcerand Quant Regulatorby Risk magazine. Minenna is one of the European economists that propose a radical change of ECB policy, from an inflation target to an interest rate target, in order to achieve a substantial levelling of the real interest rates among the Eurozone countries (the zero spread strategy). This would imply also the use of unconventional monetary measures, up to a partial debt monetization by the ECB. This idea had some resonance in the national press and abroad. He has been selected as assessor in the council of Virginia Raggi in Rome."

He was co-founder of the Youth International in the Soviet Union in 1920, and was acquainted there with Vladimir Lenin. In 1923 Barthel moved from the KPD (Communist Party of Germany) to the Social Democratic Party of Germany. He drew closer to Nazism after the Seizure of Power; he was a reporter on Strength Through Joy trips, and a press correspondent during the war. In 1922 he had worked Communist ideas into the poem \"Arbeiterseele\" (The Worker's Soul), but in 1934 his novel Das unsterbliche Volk (The Immortal Volk) described \"the transformation of a German worker [himself] from a Communist to a follower of the Führer\". In a tone of resignation, Barthel titled his postwar autobiography Kein Bedarf an Weltgeschichte (No Need for World History; 1950)."

He is noted for his research into childhood leukaemia and the roles of evolution in cancer, including important discoveries in the genetics and molecular biology underpinning leukaemia. Greaves initially trained in zoology and immunology, earning a PhD in 1968 from University College London. In the mid-1970s his research turned to leukaemia, an interest he attributes to a tour of Great Ormond Street Hospital. He worked at the Imperial Cancer Research Fund laboratories at Lincoln's Inn Fields (now part of the Francis Crick Institute) before moving to the ICR in 1984. At the ICR he served as Director of the Leukaemia Research Fund's Centre for Cell and Molecular Biology of Leukaemia from 1984-2003, and launched the Centre for Cancer Evolution in 2013."

Other women had translated religious literature, as this conformed with the notion that female education should promote piety. Treaties and handbooks on education stressed the danger in allowing eager female students to read foreign tales of love. Tyler protested in her letter “to the reader” against restrictions imposed on the literary efforts of women."

Levy wrote \"A Plan for the Abolition of Slavery\" in London in 1828, achieving celebrity at the height of the antislavery campaign. In the United States, Levy eventually purchased 100,000 acres in north-central Florida where he established Pilgrimage Plantation, a refuge for persecuted European Jews, and was also one of the founders of the town of Micanopy. Levy is frequently noted as the father of U.S. Senator David Levy Yulee. Pilgrimage Plantation, the first communitarian refuge for displaced European Jews in America was destroyed by Seminole forces in 1835 during the onset of the Second Seminole War."

  "text" : "Stewart Montagu Cleeve (20 October 1894 – 5 January 1993) was a professional soldier who later in life was an enthusiastic music teacher who assisted in the revival of the viola d'amore. Born in Southsea in Hampshire, he went to the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich and commissioned into the Royal Artillery. During the First World War, he became involved in super heavy artillery (see BL 14 inch Railway Gun) and was reputedly recalled to Dover in the Second World War on Churchill's instructions to help reassemble the same guns when they were deployed for coastal defence. After 1946, when he had retired from the army, he dedicated himself to music; especially the violin which he taught enthusiastically to many generations of London schoolboys. In later life, Cleeve helped with the revival of the viola d'amore and he formed, with others, the Viola d'Amore Society with the composer Frank Merrick as their first president (Ian White took over the Society in 1991). In 1967, Cleeve attended a class run by Maurice Bouette and made his first reproduction. He made several improvements to increase the volume and assist tuning to meet the demands of modern music, increasing the strings to 18. Through the Viola d'Amore Society he gave concerts, commissioned works from contemporary composers and edited some 400 himself."

Sibrand had travelled to Outremer in 1188, in the Third Crusade of Frederick Barbarossa, as a follower of Adolf III of Holstein.Sibrand is mentioned as the founder of that hospital in a document by king Guy of Lusignan dated to September 1190.The field hospital was operated for German troops during the siege of Akkon. Such a hospital had been set up and operated by merchants of Bremen and Lübeck, near the cemetery of St. Nicholas, using a sail for shelter. After the conquest of Akkon, Guy gave to Sibrand a house in the city, the Armenian hospital, where the German hospital found more permanent quarters."

Michiel II became a successful painter and earned a comfortable living. In 1641 he was admitted, as a master's son, to the Guild of St Luke. He married Maria Salet, with whom he had at least six children: Michiel III, Maria, Cornelis and three children whose names are not known. A number of signed and ascribed paintings of Michiel Coignet have been sold and a series of four is part of the collection of Lamport Hall. He seems to have had a workshop in which rather small and stereotype paintings could be ordered. He was also very active making paintings for cabinets and received many orders from the cabinet maker Forchondt. Subjects of these plates usually were the lives of saints. He also restored damaged paintings and despite the fact that we know that he had many of these commissions few of these small paintings have been signed and only a few paintings in cabinets are ascribed to him."

  "text" : "Maniben Patel (3 April 1903, Karamsad-1990) was an Indian independence movement activist and a Member of the Indian parliament. She was the daughter of freedom fighter and post-Independence Indian leader Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel. Educated in Mumbai, Manibehn adopted the teachings of Mahatma Gandhi in 1918, and started working regularly at his ashram in Ahmedabad. She participated in the Non-Cooperation Movement as well as the Salt Satyagraha and was imprisoned for long periods of time. In the 1930s she became her father's aide, also caring for his personal needs. However, because Manibehn Patel was committed to the liberation of India, and thus the Quit India movement, she was again imprisoned from 1942 to 1945 in Yerwada Central Jail. Manibehn Patel served her father closely until his death in 1950. After moving to Mumbai, she worked for the rest of her life with numerous charitable organizations and for the Sardar Patel Memorial Trust. She went on to author an account of the freedom struggle as a book on her father's life in the years following Indian Independence. Maniben Vallabhai Patel was once Vice-President of the Gujarat Provincial Congress Committee. Later, she was elected as a member of Indian National congress led by Nehru in first lok sabha(1952–57) from South Kaira constituency, in the second Lok Sabha (1957–62) from Anand. She was also Secretary (1953–56) and Vice President (1957–64) of Gujarat state Congress. She was elected to Rajya Sabha in 1964 and continued till 1970. Information is lacking over whether it was as a Congress Party member, a Swatantra Party member or an NCO (Congress-O) member; both Swatantra Party and NCO (Prime Minister Morarji Desai's Congress group) were powerful in Gujarat during the years 1967-1971. She left Indira led Congress(I) to join Congress(O), opposed emergency and was elected to Lok Sabha from Mehsana on Janata party ticket in 1977. She was connected with several educational institutions including the Gujarat Vidyapith, Vallabh Vidyanagar, Bardoli Swaraj Ashram and Navjivan Trust prior to her death in 1990. In 2011, the Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel Memorial Trust undertook a project to publish her Gujarati diary, in collaboration with Navjivan Publications."

Her father, an assistant surgeon with the East India Company's Bengal Light Infantry, died unexpectedly in 1831. Caroline's mother later married James Frushard on 1 March 1834. With the exception of two years spent studying in Paris, Caroline spent most of her youth in India. On 11 March 1847 in India she married Alexander Fraser, at the time a Lieutenant in the Bengal Engineer Group. Fraser went on to have a long career as a civil engineer building numerous railroads and lighthouses throughout India. The couple had two sons, Alexander Bruce Siddons Fraser (1847–1933) and Campbell Edward Fraser (1850–1926), both born in India. Caroline's writing career appears to have coincided with the breakdown of her marriage. By the 1871 British Census, Caroline was living alone with her widowed mother and sons in England. English civil records indicate that Caroline applied unsuccessfully for a legal separation in 1867 and again in 1885. General Fraser returned to England, living independently with a second family, including son Bruce Austin Fraser, 1st Baron Fraser of North Cape (1888–1981). Caroline died in Steyning, Sussex, England in 1908."

Cooper has published many books and articles on energy, telecommunications and high technology industries. Cooper's 2011 report, Nuclear Safety and Nuclear Economics, says that past nuclear disasters, such as the 1979 Three Mile Island accident, have tended to \"greatly raise regulatory barriers and have also severely multiplied the cost of reactor construction\". After Three Mile Island, the report said, the cost of nuclear power plant construction doubled in most cases and trebled or quadrupled in some rare circumstances.

He served as the senior vice president, baseball operations, of the New York Yankees for 13 seasons, 2002–14, and first joined the Yankees in 1989 after 18 years as a college baseball pitching and head coach. According to numerous reports, Newman retired from the Yankees at the conclusion of the 2014 season after 26 seasons with the organization. After graduating from high school in Wheeling, Illinois, Newman attended Southern Illinois University, where he played varsity baseball as a pitcher and second baseman. He then embarked on his coaching career, first as pitching coach at Southern Illinois from 1972–80, then as head baseball coach at Old Dominion University from 1981–89. In nine seasons at ODU, Newman's teams compiled a record of 321–167 (with three ties), won one league championship, and advanced to four conference finals and two NCAA baseball regionals. He was named Coach of the Year in the Sun Belt Conference and in the Commonwealth of Virginia in 1985 and 1987. After the 1989 college season, Newman was appointed the Yankees' coordinator of minor league instruction, serving in that role through 1996 before his promotion to vice president, player development and scouting. During Newman's first decade with the Yankees, the team's farm system produced the core of its Joe Torre-era dynasty that won four world championships in five seasons: Mariano Rivera, Derek Jeter, Jorge Posada, Bernie Williams, Andy Pettitte and others. In 2000, Newman was promoted to vice president, baseball operations, of the Yankees and then was named a senior vice president in 2002. Newman holds a law degree from Southern Illinois University."

  "text" : "Mary Bruins Allison (March 19, 1903 - September 15, 1994) was one of the first American women to be trained in medicine in the United States who chose to use her skills as a missionary doctor in Arabia. As the daughter of a minister, her understanding of religion, passion for medicine and desire to be a medical missionary in Arabia grew with her from early childhood. She went to college in the small town of Pella and then attended medical college in Philadelphia whilst learning Arabic during her free time. In 1934, after a few internships at various American hospitals after graduating from medical school, she went to the Middle East to use her medical skills as a missionary doctor. In her forty-year career, she worked primarily in Kuwait, as well as India, Qatar, Bahrain and Oman. In her capacity in Kuwait, she treated different types of women, from the poor marginalized Iranian women to the wives of the various royal families in the region. Despite limited trained medical staff, medical resources and cultural, lingual and religious barriers, Dr. Mary attended to over two hundred patients a day. Her commitment was unwavering, to the extent that she sought additional training during her brief leaves. During her time in the Arab world, she contributed greatly to establishing modern medical care in the countries she worked in; she was asked several times by the rulers of Bahrain and Oman to help set up hospitals in their countries. She eventually returned to the United States in 1975."

  "text" : "Marie Bosse, also known as La Bosse (died 8 May 1679), was a French poisoner, fortune teller and alleged witch. She was one of the accused in the famous Poison affair. It was Marie Bosse who pointed out the central figure La Voisin. Bosse, the widow of a horse trader, was one of the most successful fortune tellers in Paris. Unofficially, she was also a poisoner, who provided poison to people who wished to commit murder. By the end of 1678, Bosse attended a party held by her friend Marie Vigoreaux, the wife of a dressmaker, in the Rue Courtauvilain. During the party, she became drunk and boasted freely that she had become so wealthy by selling deadly poisons to members of the aristocracy that she would soon be able to retire. At the time, the Paris police was investigating poison sales in Paris. A guest at the party, the lawyer Maitre Perrin, reported the conversation to the police. The police sent the wife of a police officer to Bosse to ask for poison to murder her husband, and Bosse provided her with what proved to be deadly poison. On the morning 4 January 1679, Marie Bosse was arrested with her daughter Manon and her sons, Francois and Guillame. Her older son was a soldier in the royal guard, the younger one was recently released from a working house. According to the report, when the family was arrested they were found in the only bed in the house and had committed incest. Marie Vigoreaux was arrested the same day, and was found to have close ties to the family, as she had sexual relations with all of the members of the family. Their confessions revealed that the illegal sale of poison in the capital was handled by a network of fortune tellers. This led to the arrest of the central figure La Voisin and the opening of the Poison affair. Marie Bosse confessed of having provided the poison used by Marguerite de Poulaillon in her murder attempt on her husband. Marie Vigoreux died during interrogation under torture 9 May 1679. Marie Bosse was condemned to death by burning and executed in Paris on 8 May 1679. Her children and associates were also sentenced to death."

  "text" : "Marguerite de Poulaillon née de Jehan (fl. 1697), was a French noble, one of the accused in the famous Poison Affair. She belonged to a noble family in Bordeaux and was described as a charming beauty. She was arranged to marry the much older Alexander de Poulaillon, with whom she became much unhappy. Desperately in love with the adventurer Riviére, who demanded money from her, she made several attempts to murder her husband, once by the use of poison acquired from Marie Bosse. Her husband was warned of her attempts, had her imprisoned in a convent in 1678 and reported her. Marguerite de Poulaillon was the first person from the upper classes to be implicated in the Poison Affair, and the case against her was regarded to form a precedence against other accused of the same status, and was therefore carefully treated. She confessed to her guilt before trial and explained herself willing to submit to the death penalty. She was initially sentenced to banishment 5 June 1679. However, according to Gabriel Nicolas de la Reynie, she was unsatisfied with the sentence, perhaps because she feared being put under the guardianship of her husband, and asked to be imprisoned, as she would otherwise be inclined to repeat her crimes. Her sentence was therefore changed to confinement in a work house for former prostitutes in Angers. In 1697, Marguerite de Poulaillon appealed to be transferred from the work house to a convent, but her appeal was denied by Gabriel Nicolas de la Reynie, and she remained in the prison work house until her death. The court was reportedly influenced by her beauty and by the fact that she was related to and acquainted with several members of the court. The verdict made the court lose face in the eyes of the public. It also became a precedent, and affected the verdicts of other accused based on rank: Francoise de Dreux and Marguerite Leferon, the former guilty of several murders and the latter to the murder of her husband to marry her lover, were both Parisian socialites and were both merely sentenced to exile from Paris, while the wife of the musician Philippe Rebille Philbert, who poisoned her husband to marry him, was hanged for the same crime."

She was the prime disciple of 'Veenai Visalakshi'(regarded as the 'Taanam' expert), who was the disciple of 'shatkala chakravarti' Veena Venkatramana Das of Vijayanagaram & also Veenai Dhanammal. Mangalam had the rare distinction of playing the Indian national anthem on the veena in the presence of R. Venkatraman, the former President of India. Association with Radio and TV Networks Mangalam gave her maiden performance on the All India Radio at the age of 11. This was the year 1948.

  "text" : "Manahi (Doc) Nitama Paewai OBE (8 June 1920 – 10 October 1990) was a New Zealand doctor, rugby player, local politician and community leader. A Māori from the Ngāti Kahungunu and Rangitāne iwi, he was born near Makirikiri Marae in Hawke's Bay. A Mormon, his second name Nitama was the Māori translation of Needham, as in Needham Lambert, who was the president of the New Zealand Mission of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). When he was four years old, Paewai's father Niki Paiwai was admitted to Utah State University, and so Paewai started school at the Woodruff School in Logan, Utah, and was baptized in Logan at age eight. They returned to New Zealand in 1929. Paewai attended Dannevirke High School before being admitted to the University of Otago. However, at that time there was extreme prejudice against Māori at Otago and he gave up his studies shortly after starting there to return to Tahoraiti, near Dannevirke. Shortly after, the LDS Church mission president at the time, Matthew Cowley, visited that location. On learning that Paewai had quit school, Cowley called him as a missionary, and then gave him his missionary assignment of returning to Otago University and completing his training as a doctor. Paewai graduated from Otago with a degree in medicine in 1945. In 1957, Paewai did advanced medical studies at the University of Utah. In New Zealand he is recognised as an important practitioner of public health policies by a doctor within the Māori community. In 1949, Paewai married Hineapa Meha. They became the parents of eight children. Paewai spent most of his adult life in Kaikohe. He was a community leader there and also served on the board of governors of Northland College. He also served on the advisory board of the Church College of New Zealand. Paewai also held many positions in the LDS Church. From 1984 to 1986, Nitami and Hineapa Paewai served as missionaries for the LDS Church in India, Malaysia and Singapore. In the 1967 New Year Honours, Paewai was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire for services to the Māori people in the Kaikohe district. Paewai's nephew, Albert Kewene, was the first Māori registered dentist."

  "text" : "Maurice Huggett (7 July 1945 – 17 December 2011) was the proprietor of a private members club known as the Phoenix Artist Club in Soho, London. The son of a builder, Huggett worked as a bank clerk before joining American Express in London's Haymarket, working for the Keith Prowse ticket agency in 1969 at The Dorchester hotel. After a period working for Pan Am, Huggett lived in pre-revolution Tehran to handle incoming tours for Air Express. According to The Daily Telegraph \"one night he looked out from his room to see the streets running red. He called the BBC and gave a dramatic account. Only later did he discover the truth. The first targets of the Islamic fundamentalists were wine cellars, and the streets had been running not with blood but with red wine.\" He returned to London on the last flight out of Tehran, and obtained a publican’s licence. He then managed the Players' Theatre beneath the arches at Charing Cross station. Huggett acquired the Phoenix Artist Club in the mid 1990s, located in a basement beneath the Phoenix Theatre on the Charing Cross Road. The basement was originally used as a rehearsal room and dressing room for the theatre, but had been converted into a bar and restaurant during the 1970s. Under his ownership, it acquired extensive refurbishment. The Phoenix became a hub of late night drinking and debauchery for artists, actors, comedians, producers, writers and journalists. Karaoke was banned, the jukebox abolished, and Huggett became a centrepiece of flamboyance, renowned for giving impromptu performances of showtunes. Among the Phoenix clientele were the crime novelist Martina Cole, singer Lady Gaga, comedian Noel Fielding and the actors Jude Law, Keira Knightley and John Hurt. Huggett flatly refused entry to the Arctic Monkeys because they looked \"too scruffy\" - despite their latest single being at the top of the British charts at the time. The writer Bryony Gordon remembers Huggett \"barred an acquaintance of mine for six months due to drunken misbehaviour. When my friend ventured back at the end of his ban, he was warmly embraced by Maurice who asked where on earth he had been, and by the way, would he like free membership.\" Another regular recalls \"amid the swirl of tottering A-listers and communal singing, Huggett framed strict house rules. Anyone moving furniture, for example, would prompt him to grab his microphone and to command: \"Don’t touch the props! Leave the props alone!”\" Huggett died after a short illness in London in December 2011. Those at his bedside reported his death was accompanied to the soundtrack of Man of La Mancha, one of his favourite musicals."

From 1890 til 1901 she was one of the dominating female racing cyclists in the States. In 1900 she established four endurance records, about 500, 1000, 2000 and 2500 miles. She also rode motor-paced cycling races. Later on, \"Little Duchy\" as she was called, rode races on motorcycles herself and made stunts. After her retreat from sport at the beginning of the 1920s Gast learned the profession of physiotherapist, at which she worked until she was very old. In 1931 her studio was destroyed by a fire. She also ran a pub called \"The Little Dutchess Inn\". In 1993 Margaret Gast was inducted to the United States Bicycling Hall of Fame."

Because his father wrote an autobiography in which he tried to clear his friends who had become victims of the Great Purge and was removed from office because of that, Sturua could not enter a diplomatic career and so he eventually became a journalist, with the aid of Deputy Prime Minister Anastas Mikoyan. Sturua became the Deputy Foreign Editor for Izvestia and was Bureau Chief for the newspaper in New York between 1968 and 1972 and was acting Foreign editor between 1972 and 1976. From 1976 till 1982, he was Washington Bureau Chief and from 1982 till 1984 he was Foreign Editor. Sturua has been a political columnist since 1982."

At the invitation of the Anglican bishop of Auckland, Moore Richard Neligan, she came to New Zealand in 1904 to establish a church school for girls. By the time of her retirement in 1926 Mary Pulling had firmly established Diocesan High School for Girls on a firm footing with a growing roll, sound finances, and a high academic reputation. From 1930 she lived a reclusive life as Anchoress Mary Etheldred in the Waikato town of Cambridge, devoting her time to intercessional prayer and spiritual counselling for those who requested it. Towards the end of her life she suffered from cerebral arteriosclerosis, and died at Tokanui Hospital, Te Awamutu, on 24 March 1951. She never married and apparently had no close relatives in New Zealand. Interestingly she designed a gothic styled entrance arch for the Anglican portion of the Symonds Street Cemetery in Auckland. This may have been the first work of architecture by a woman in New Zealand - it was constructed in 1910 and demolished in 1968 when the cemetery was altered during the construction of the motorway system - no other architectural work by her is known at present."

Manuel Cruz Herrera (c. 1924–1998) was a lawyer, an instructor in the University of the Philippines and Manuel Luis Quezon University, and a deputy tanod bayan (Ombudsman at present) during the Marcos regime and later, head of the prosecution panel in the Benigno Aquino, Jr. murder case that led to the EDSA Revolution of 1986. And then became one of the justices of the Court of Appeals from 1987 to 1997, and chair of the National Unification Commission. Born in Wawa, Pilar, Bataan, Manuel Herrera was the second of nine children of Jose S. Herrera Sr., third municipal Mayor of Pilar (sheriff at that time) and Brigida Cruz, both natives of Wawa, Pilar, Bataan. He studied law at Manuel L. Quezon University while working as a janitor. Herrera was known for his generosity towards his fellow kababayans, his bravery, kindness, nationalism, and integrity, especially as a justice of the Court of Appeals. Despite their courageous efforts in presenting new evidences and eyewitnesses, he felt that there was really a conspiracy to assassinate not only former senator Ninoy Aquino but also the fall guy Rolando Galman. On January 10, 1985, he and his prosecution team together by presiding Justice Manuel Pamaram were called by President Marcos to a meeting in Malacañan Palace, insinuating that Galman was really the communist who shot Aquino and defended the accused. Herrera tried to voice out his opinion by telling that Galman was a fall guy and there was an ongoing conspiracy but Pamaran told him not to contradict Marcos because he was sick at that time and the President might collapse. But it only swelled the flood of dissatisfaction of his regime, less than a year the EDSA People Power Revolution occurred and Marcos found himself out in power. In March 1986 he revealed that Marcos did in fact try to influence, if not direct, the outcome of the first Sandiganbayan. Herrera then became one of the Associate justices of the Court of Appeals until his retirement. Herrera died of a heart attack at the age of 74. A road (Justice Manuel C. Herrera Road) was named after him in honor of his great contributions to the people and love of his fellows kabarangays."

He claims that he was incarcerated for 42 days in Mangalore before being released on conditional bail by Karnataka High Court Justice Ashok B. Hinchigeri on 25 October 2008, and was used as a scapegoat by the Bharatiya Janata Party regime to \"save the government from further embarrassment after the church attacks and on instructions from the Sangh Parivar leaders.\" He denied that any Catholic churches were attacked by his group during the attacks but reportedly accepted responsibility for the attacks on prayer halls belonging to the New Life Fellowship Trust. The Bajrang Dal were reported to have stated that they were not against Christianity in the region but were offended by the alleged forcible conversions. Kumar had initially denied any involvement in the attacks before being arrested. When asked again at a later date though if he had accepted responsibility for the attacks he denied it. Kumar resigned from Bajrang Dal on 1 October 2008 after witnessing a Hindu woman who had decided to commit suicide with her three children but was saved by Christian missionaries. He stated \"That was the time I realised that life is more important than dharma (religion). A lot needs to be done for the betterment of life. My dream is to build a society that values life more than religion. In jail I read several literary works. I joined Bajrang Dal so that we could mobilise the youth for a good cause, but at the end of the day all our concepts were politically motivated.\" In February 2011, after the commission reports into the attacks were published, Kumar formally apologised to the public for the attacks and accused the BJP Government of corruption. On 21 February 2011 he joined the Janata Dal Party (JDS), declaring, \"I am today shedding the shackles of communalism to strive for communal harmony, for which the JDS is working.\" He was succeeded as state convener of the Bajrang Dal by Suryanarayana."

  "text" : "Manfredo Manfredi (Italian: [maɱˈfreːdo maɱˈfreːdi]; 16 April 1859, Piacenza – 13 October 1927, Piacenza) was an Italian architect. In 1880, Manfredi began his studies at the Accademia di belle arti di Roma (Academy of Fine Arts in Rome). In 1884 he came in second in the architectural competition for the monument now known as the Altare della Patria to honour Victor Emmanuel. When the winning architect Giuseppe Sacconi died in 1905, Manfredi, Gaetano Koch and Pio Piacentini were appointed to oversee the completion of the monument. Manfredi helped found the Scuola Superiore di Architettura in Rome and was its director from 1908 to 1920. He was also involved in politics and was an elected member of the Parliament of Italy between 1909 and 1919."

  "text" : "Mikalay Autukhovich is a Belarusian businessman and political dissident who has twice been imprisoned by the government of Belarus. Belarusian courts have found him guilty of tax evasion and terrorism, but international human rights organization Amnesty International has stated that he is a prisoner of conscience imprisoned solely for peaceful protest. Prior to his arrest, Autukhovich worked at the Vaukavysk-based taxi company Nika-taxi 22222. He also ran as an opposition candidate in the 2004 Belarusian parliamentary elections. On 7 July 2006, he was arrested and charged with \"large scale tax evasion and running business without a registration and a license\". He was found guilty on both counts and sentenced to three-and-a-half years' home arrest. He was released in early 2009 following \"pressure from the European Union and the United States\". Shortly after his release, he was charged with involvement in a 2005 arson case, along with two other activists. Authorities later added additional charges of illegal weapons possession and \"preparing a terrorist act\". Autukhovich responded to the charges with a three-month hunger strike that lasted from February to April of that year, demanding that he be allowed to face to trial. In May, Autukhovich was tried, and while the terrorism charge against him was dropped, he was convicted of illegal possession of weapons and ammunition and given a five-year, two-month prison sentence. Autukhovich is currently serving his sentence in a labor camp in Ivatsevichy. He reportedly lacks legal representation after his lawyer, Paval Sapelka, was disbarred for representing opposition presidential candidate Andrei Sannikov in court. In December 2011, prison officials reported that Autukhovich had attempted suicide by slashing his wrists, but had survived and was in stable condition. According to the Viasna Human Rights Centre, following the incident, he was moved into a \"closed regime\", largely isolating him from contact with other prisoners. Radio Free Europe has described Autukhovich as being regarded as a political prisoner by \"activists at home and abroad\". Amnesty International has named him a prisoner of conscience and called for his immediate release."

  "text" : "Margia Dean is the stage name of Marguerite Louise Skliris-Alvarez (born April 7, 1922), a former American beauty queen and actress of Greek descent. She was born in Chicago, Illinois but moved to San Francisco, California with her parents at a young age. She began acting at the age of 7, appearing on stage in many child roles and later won the Women's National Shakespeare Contest for her role as Juliet in a production of Romeo and Juliet. She also took up modeling and was named \"Miss San Francisco\" and \"Miss California\" in 1939. She was a top-five runner-up to Patricia Donnelly in the \"Miss America 1939\" competition. She made her feature film debut in Casanova in Burlesque (1944) and adopted her stage name, Margia Dean. Although never under contract to a studio, most of the films, some 16 in all, she made were for the producer Robert L. Lippert. Her first leading role was in Shep Come Home (1948) and roles followed in Red Desert (1949), FBI Girl (1951), The Lonesome Trail (1955), Villa!! (1958) and Seven Women from Hell (1961). Dean starred in a 1958 western, Ambush at Cimarron Pass, that featured Clint Eastwood in one of his earliest film roles. She also portrayed a trapeze artist in the 1961 circus tale The Big Show, which starred Esther Williams and Robert Vaughn. Her association with Lippert had led to her being cast in The Quatermass Xperiment (1955), the first Hammer horror film. Frustrated that her roles were predominantly in B movies, she eventually retired from acting following her marriage in 1965 to her second husband, Brazilian architect Felipe Alvarez. Her final film was Moro Witch Doctor (1964). She briefly became involved in movie production, producing The Long Rope (1961) with Hugh Marlowe as well as a number of television pilots. She has since been vice-president of a real estate firm and has worked in costume design and interior decoration."

  "text" : "M. Christina White is a professor of chemistry at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Her research program centers around the use of organometallic catalysis to develop highly selective C—H functionalization methods for streamlining the process of complex molecule synthesis. White received her B.A. in biochemistry from Smith College in 1992, where she worked with Stuart Rosenfeld in the area of host-guest chemistry. After a brief stint in the biology graduate program at Johns Hopkins University working with Christian Anfinsen, she began her doctoral studies in chemistry under the direction of Gary H. Posner. During that time, her research involved synthesis of hybrid vitamin D3 analogs. In 1999, she joined Eric Jacobsen's labs at Harvard University as an NIH postdoctoral fellow. During this time, she developed the first synthetically useful methane monooxygenase (MMO) mimic system for catalytic epoxidations with hydrogen peroxide. White began her independent career as a member of the chemistry faculty at Harvard University in July 2002. She joined the department of chemistry at the University of Illinois in the summer of 2005, where she is currently a Professor of Chemistry. White's current research focuses on catalytic C-H activation through palladium (most notably via the eponymous White catalyst) and iron (most notably Fe(PDP)(MeCN)2(SbF6)2, more commonly referred to as the White–Chen catalyst). White has applied these catalysts and their derivatives to new applications, with the most recent being the White catalyst's dehydrogenative Diels-Alder reaction and the iron-mediated intramolecular C-H amination reaction."

  "text" : "Mohammed Issa al-Tajer (Arabic: محمد عيسى التاجر‎‎) is a Bahraini human rights lawyer detained in April 2011, apparently for his role in defending Arab Spring protesters. In early 2011, following the self-immolation of young Tunisian merchant Mohamed Bouazizi, a series of pro-democratic uprisings swept the Middle East, later to be known as the \"Arab Spring\". Bahraini activists joined the movement with a series of protests beginning on 14 February, which escalated into the Bahraini uprising. In March, King Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa declared martial law and a three-month state of emergency. Following the arrests of some protesters, al-Tajer coordinated a team of 25 defense lawyers to help those activists in incommunicado detention. Al-Tajer's wife Huda al-Juffairi, a medical doctor, was also active in providing medical aid to injured protesters. Al-Tajer was arrested without a warrant on 16 April 2011 at his home in Manama by more than 20 masked security officers, in front of his wife and children. The officers also confiscated laptops, mobile phones, and documents, and demanded the keys to al-Tajer's law office, forcing him to turn them over. His bank account was also frozen. On June 12, 2011, he was brought before a military tribunal; his attorneys were given no notice and were therefore not present. He was charged with inciting hatred for the regime, engaging in illegal protests, and inciting people to harm police, and pleaded not guilty. On 7 August 2011, al-Tajer was released from prison, though the charges against him appeared not to have been dropped. As one of the conditions of his release, he signed papers agreeing that he would not participate in \"any activity against the country\". He stated that he had been abused while in captivity by being beaten and deprived of sleep. Al-Tajer's arrest led to international outcry, with statements of protest from Human Rights Watch, the International Federation for Human Rights, Front Line Defenders, the Bahrain Centre for Human Rights, and the New York City Bar Association. Amnesty International also called for the dismissal of charges against him, designating him a prisoner of conscience during his detention."

  "text" : "Malcolm Sutherland-Foggio (born April 4, 1998 in Morristown, New Jersey) is the Founder and Ex Officio Chairman of Make Some Noise: Cure Kids Cancer Foundation, Inc., a 501(c)(3) established to raise funds exclusively for childhood cancer research and increase awareness for these diseases. Malcolm had led a normal childhood as the youngest of three boys until he began to experience pain in his hip at age ten. Thus began his journey into childhood cancer. Diagnosed in early December 2008 with a pediatric bone cancer called Pelvic Ewing's Sarcoma, he immediately began raising funds for research and speaking out about pediatric cancer. As he got further into his treatments, he learned about the heavy disproportion of research funding that goes towards adult cancer research over childhood cancer research. Eight rounds of chemotherapy into his 14-round treatment protocol, he experienced the loss of a young cancer patient just two doors down from his own hospital room. Malcolm was deeply moved by this child's passing, and ten-year-old Malcolm noted that someone needed to \"make some noise\" about childhood cancer, and announced that he needed to start a foundation. He spent the remainder of his bone cancer treatments finishing chemotherapy, learning to walk without a hip, and getting the foundation ready to launch. The month following the end of Malcolm's treatment, Make Some Noise: Cure Kids Cancer was officially incorporated on September 24, 2009, and in just over two years the young entrepreneur has made significant progress. He has released two awareness videos, \"1 in 320\" and  both of which can be found on the foundation's YouTube Channel. His foundation was selected as a Top 3 finalist for \"Best New Charity\" in the 2011 Classy Awards, he was honored by NJ's First Lady, Mary Pat Christie, as a \"NJ Hero\" in January 2012. Malcolm has toured the country meeting with researchers and learning about the issues they face in securing funding. He has established corporate headquarters in Parsippany NJ, and has chapters forming around the country, with Denver, CO being the first to incorporate in December 2011."

  "text" : "Mitsuo Aoki, nicknamed Mits (December 4, 1914 - August 19, 2010) was an American theologian. He was born on a sugar-cane plantation near Hawi on the Island of Hawaii, and lived there until graduating high school. He then relocated to Honolulu for University training, and converted to Christianity from Buddhism. At the beginning of World War II, he was on the mainland US, and subsequently escorted by FBI agents to Hawaii, rather than placed into Japanese American internment camps as were mainland persons of Japanese Ancestry. He never showed any degree of bitterness, and was a constant spirit of joy. Mitsuo was the founder of the Department of Religion at the University of Hawaii, Manoa campus, and regularly taught courses such as Religions of Mankind, Death and Dying and The Meaning of Existence for forty years thereafter. These were some of the most popular courses on the campus. He frequently recounted an Out of Body Experience he'd had following an automobile accident in 1957 as a driving force in his life. In 1968 he met and soon married Margaret Evelyn Reeves Wagner, a divorcee recently relocated to Hawaii from California. Together, Mits and Lynne set out on a new adventure that touched numerous lives for the better. They were frequent travelers, both on around the world sojourns, and to distant destinations, often as the guru for Young Presidents' Organization, for which organization he was a frequent invited speaker and counselor. In his later years, he often gave seminars on Death and Dying, relaying his many experiences in counseling families of those losing a loved one, whom he considered his teachers. He is acknowledged as a world leader on the subject of Death and Dying. He leaves behind three children, Galen, Sophie Ann and April; and three step-children, Richard, Walter and Christina. Step-sons John and Wiley preceded him in death. He constantly preached that we should not be afraid of death, and instead should embrace it. He was against dying in the hospital, and he died in his own house surrounded by family and friends at the age of 95 in August 2010. In 2004 Mitsuo was named as a Living Treasures of Hawai'i. By his own admission, he's taught over 40,000 students during the 40 years of teaching at the University of Hawaii, an extremely notable achievement not shared by many other professors at any university anywhere. Among those crediting him with their success is the 2011-2015 Governor of Hawaii, Neil Abercrombie, who in his election victory speech of November 3, 2010 made specific mention of Mits' positive influence on his life's work, thanking him for his service to Hawaii and stating inter alia: \"He blessed us with his presence.\" His best legacy, perhaps, is the Department of Religion that he founded at the Manoa campus, and which he led for forty years, Many articles by others about Mitsuo's work span several decades."

  "text" : "Manfred Roeder (August 20, 1900 – October 18, 1971) was a military judge in Nazi Germany. Serving on the highest wartime court, he led the investigation and examinations and later the prosecution of the German Resistance group, the Red Orchestra. He shared responsibility for the dozens of death sentences handed down by the Reich court martial to Red Orchestra members. After Germany's defeat in World War II, there were attempts by survivors, family and the U.S. Army to investigate the prosecutions of Red Orchestra members and others, but Roeder was never convicted of any malfeasance or crime because the Allies thought it more expedient to use his 'expertise' to hunt down the Red Orchestra members a second time than to mete out justice for victims of the Nazis; this time to aid the Western Allies with information about the Russians in the nascent cold war."

In 1935 he joined an expedition to the Himalayas and mapped 26 peaks over 26,000 feet. In 1933 he married Erika Haarmann, and their son John-Christopher was born in 1936. In the late 1930s the artist Nancy Sharp, the wife of William Coldstream and the lover of Louis MacNeice, fell in love with Spender. Michael and Nancy divorced their respective spouses, and in 1943 they married. Their son Philip was born the same year. Spender was regarded as arrogant and tactless, and he had a difficult relationship with his brother, Stephen. On 3 May 1945 Michael was a passenger in an Avro Anson, and he was seriously injured when it crashed near Süchteln in Germany; he died on 5 May. Stephen was deeply affected, and he wrote the elegy Seascape for his brother. He was buried at Eindhoven General Cemetery at Woensel in the Netherlands."

He was a painter in oil paint and water-colour, focusing mainly on landscapes and architecture. Alongside his painting practice Sharp was also a keen etcher, engraver and lithograph artist. Sharp exhibited widely including exhibiting works at the Royal Academy, London, England. Royal West of England Academy and Birmingham Society of Artists. From 14 May – 12 June 1937, Sharp had a large scale exhibition at The Foyles Gallery Charing Cross Road, London, titled English Landscapes, an exhibiiton of oil paintings and engravings of English landscapes, including forty seven oil paintings, and ten etchings and line engravings. The works often depicted his surroundings in Nuneaton with this exhibition containing works depicting George Eliot's birthplace, and hospitals and rural settings in and around Warwickshire. These local scenes where painted later in his career when he took up a position as Principal of the Nuneaton Art School between 1925–1952. Some of the water colours made during this period where exhibited in Nuneaton Museum & Art Gallery in the exhibition Moments in time. More recently, Sharp's work was included in the BBC project Your Paintings, later renamed Art UK, which aims to allow easy access to painting in public collections online."

  "text" : "Margaret Lawrie was famous for capturing and retelling many of the myths and Legends of the Torres Strait Islander people. She was born in Victoria in 1917 and died in 2003. She studied English and music and later became a music teacher. Margaret married Alexander Lawrie who was a senator for Queensland. Margaret Lawrie became interested in a range of social issues in the course of assisting her husband. She was invited by the Queensland Government to travel with Oodgeroo Noonuccal and a Queensland Health worker to Cape York and Torres Strait Island communities to report on children’s health and other issues in these communities. As a result of her work, Margaret developed an interest and association with the Torres Strait Islands and its people. She first visited the area in the early 1960s and spent significant periods of time with each of the different island communities, gathering information and material about the myths, legends, languages, history, art and culture of the regions up until 1973. During her various visits to the area she formed many friendships with the Torres Strait community. Because of her connections to the people she was approached to record some of the local myths and legends before they became lost. At this time she had a close relationship with the Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies and she undertook extensive recording of various oral histories under the sponsorship of the Institute. She also undertook detailed research into the history and culture of the Torres Strait Islands and people. The State Library of Queensland now holds this collection of information. Contained within the collection are the manuscripts of the two works she published, Myths and legends of the Torres Strait  and Tales from Torres Strait. The former work was published in both Australia and the United States and although out of print, is still widely considered an iconic work. The Margaret Lawrie Collection complements the earlier work done by Alfred Haddon. His expedition team from Cambridge University visited the Torres Strait in 1898 publishing the results of their regional ethnography in six volumes between 1901 and 1935. The Margaret Lawrie Collection has been included on UNESCO's Australian Memory of the World Register."

  "text" : "Martial Caillebotte (1853–1910) was a French photographer and composer who was also one of the \"Fathers of Philately\" entered on the Roll of Distinguished Philatelists in 1921. He was the younger brother of the noted artist Gustave Caillebotte (1848-1894) and they both inherited a fortune from their father, enabling them to pursue their respective passions throughout life. He married Marie Minoret, June 7, 1887. In 1888 his wife gave birth to a son Jean, and then in 1889 a daughter Geneviève. Geneviève inherited the majority of unsold paintings by Gustave Caillebotte. Along with his brother, he formed a joint stamp collection around 1878 that grew to be one of the most important of its time but disposed of it in 1887, after about ten years following his marriage. The purchaser, with whom they worked on the plating, or reconstruction of the original sheet, of important issues including the Sydney View two-pence stamp of Australia, was Thomas Tapling, whose collection, including the Caillebotte collection, is part of the philatelic collection of the British Library. \n* A photograph of the Caillebotte family taken by Martial Caillebotte \n* Pierre-Auguste Renoir at Montmartre in a photograph by Martial Caillebotte. \n* Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Portrait of Jean and Geneviève Caillebotte, 1895"

  "text" : "David Michael \"Mickey\" Hawks (July 17, 1940 – August 31, 1989) was an American rockabilly singer and pianist, whose best remembered record, \"Bip Bop Boom\", has been included on many compilations of the genre after years as a collectible record. He was born in Thomasville, North Carolina, moving with his family as a child to High Point. He learned piano as a child and listened to Ernest Tubb and Louis Armstrong records, before discovering the music of Little Richard in 1956. With his school friends, he formed a band, the Rhythm Rockers, and came to the attention of local disc jockey Moon Mullins, who had his own band, the Night Raiders. Hawks joined the Night Raiders as vocalist and pianist in 1958; the other members were Mullins (guitar, saxophone, vocals), Bill Ballard (guitar, vocals), John Owens (bass, vocals), and Bob Matthews (drums). Influenced by Gene Vincent's \"Be-Bop-A-Lula\", Hawks wrote \"Bip Bop Boom\", which they recorded in a Greensboro studio owned by Eddie Robbins. It became the B-side of their first single, \"Rock and Roll Rhythm\", a song Hawks co-wrote with Matthews, and was released on two local labels, Robbins Red (owned by Robbins) and Mart, before being picked up by the Profile label in Chicago. The label remixed the record, and moved \"Bip Bop Boom\" to the A-side. The single was credited to Mickey Hawks with Moon Mullins and his Night Raiders. It reportedly sold 50,000 copies in the Chicago area, but failed to reach the national charts; however, it did become a hit in South Africa. The follow-up, \"Cottonpickin'\", was an instrumental, with \"Hidi Hidi Hidi\" featuring Hawks on the B-side. However, the record was not a hit. Hawks continued to record with Mullins and the Night Riders through to 1960, without repeating their early success, and the group stayed together playing in local clubs until splitting up in 1968. Hawks then recorded a duet with Gwynn Kellum. After \"Bip Bop Boom\" became popular among rock and roll audiences in Europe, Hawks performed several times there at festivals, and recorded an album, Invites You to Go Back in Time with Mickey Hawks & the Sounds of the 50s. He continued to perform occasionally until his death in 1989 at the age of 49."

He was elected an Ordinary Member of The Philatelic Society, London, now the Royal Philatelic Society London, in 1870 and an Honorary Member of that Society in 1875, and as such he was one of the first members of the Society. Election as an honorary member probably related to the rule that once existed that full members should be resident in London. According to Gibbons Stamp Weekly, de Figueroa was given the title of \"Honorary Postman of Spain and her Possessions\" for postal reforms in that country and the privilege of free postage for his services to science. The pen name \"Thebussem\" was created from an anagram of \"embustes\" (Spanish for \"lies\" or \"tall tales\"), with an H and an S added to Germanize it. The well-known Spanish writer Dionisio Pérez Gutiérrez chose to go by the pseudonym \"Post-Thebussem\" as a show of support for de Figueroa."

Baistrocchi was born on August 17, 1942, in Karuizawa, Japan. He worked as journalist, and wrote articles for Italian and overseas magazines and other publications. His books and articles focused on numerous subjects, such as travel, culture and socio-economic issues. His books were often influenced by his diplomatic postings, including \"Namibian Elegy,\" which included poems focusing on key Namibian geographical features, including the Spitzkoppe, the Orange River, the Fish River Canyon and Sossusvlei. He held art exhibitions around the world including Spain, Japan, South Korea, Ghana, Portugal, Egypt, and Hong Kong. He joined the Ministry of Foreign Affairs as a press officer in 1970. He was appointed as Italian ambassador to Ghana and Togo in May 1996, holding that diplomatic post until 2001. Massimo Baistrocchi was appointed Ambassador from Namibia from 2001 to 2004. He was reportedly so fond of the country that he purchased a Namibian home. Baistrochhi returned to Italy following the end of his posting in Namibia, where he served as President of the Interministerial Commission for the Recovering of Works of Art. During the late 2000s, Baistrocchi was once again sent to Africa, serving first as Italy's ambassador to Nigeria and then as ambassador to Benin. He then retired from the diplomatic corp, but returned to their home in Windhoek, Namibia, once a year. Baistrocchi died from a heart attack in Windhoek, Namibia, on January 22, 2012, at the age of 69. He was survived by his wife, Adriana, and his daughter Allegra. An exhibition of his art was held at the National Art Gallery of Namibia on January 27, 2012, as a tribute."

  "text" : "Martin J. Levitt (14 October 1944 – 21 November 2004) was a supervisory trainer, union buster and a union organizer on and off over a 20-year period before 1987 when he reportedly changed direction. He went from anti union to anti managemant and founded Justice for Labor Foundation and later wrote about his career in his autobiography released in 1993 entitled Confessions of a Union Buster which he authored with Terry Conrow Toczynski. The book found success among labor unions due to the lurid details he outlined about union busting tactics he claims to have used. Levitt says he entered the field in 1969 \"as a young man with no particular feelings about unions but with a desire to use his considerable wits and smooth tongue to get ahead.\"  Levitt claims to have been \"one of the multimillion-dollar industry's best talents...caught up in the money and intellectual pleasure of the pursuit.\" During his so-called reformed career he was known for holding seminars, newspaper articles and some national television interviews such as 60 minutes and the TODAY show. In the book Levitt details his work history from an inexperienced consultant first hired by a former IBEW union organizer named John Sheridan who had earned his stripes as a disciple of Nathan Shefferman who wrote a guide to union busting. Levitt recalled during his interview that Sheridan's 2nd in command Nick Sangalis did a background check and found \"one\" criminal skeleton in his closet: a conviction for receiving stolen property which, as detailed in his book, would become one of a long list of criminal convictions along with chronic alcoholism and mental illness for which the latter was diagnosed in 1977. Levitt's book details his addictions to money and alcohol and parallels he drew to his serial criminal history including forgeries, check fraud, insurance fraud, arson, abusive outbursts, rehab centers and prison with what he ofttimes claimed to be what caused his illegal union busting activities at some 200 organizations. His consulting career was atypical and went through upheavels until it culminated in what he terms was his \"awakening\" in 1987 when out of desperation he called the AFL-CIO offices in Washington DC  and spoke to the publisher of the RUB sheet (Report on Union Busters) saying \"they had one less union buster to worry about\". and soon thereafter he became a self-proclaimed authority on union busting. His critics believe he was a clever opportunist who found one more way to exploit labor unions as an end to his means."

  "text" : "William More Adey, known universally as More Adey (1858–29 January 1942), was an English art critic, editor and aesthete. He was a co-editor of the Burlington Magazine, but is perhaps best known for having been a friend and member of the inner circle of Oscar Wilde from the early 1890s until Wilde's death in 1900. As a defender of Wilde during his trial and imprisonment, Adey visited the fallen author in Reading Gaol, attempted to negotiate on behalf of the gaoled writer's interests as his de facto guardian, and oversaw a collection that was used to purchase necessities of life, including clothes, for him upon his release. Adey was also a partner of Lord Alfred Douglas in 1895, and a close friend of the poet from the 1890s until 1913. Douglas's biographer, Rupert Croft-Cooke, refers to Adey as \"a homosexual of what, among his fellows, was and is, called the 'discreet' kind.\" Adey also developed a professional relationship and 15-year life partnership with Wilde's other good friend, Robbie Ross. When Douglas and Ross faced each other in court in 1913 in the Arthur Ransome libel case, Adey testified in Ross's favor, which caused Douglas to sever his ties with his former friend. Adey became assistant editor of the Burlington Magazine in November 1910, and served as co-editor, in partnership with Roger Fry, from January 1914 until May 1919. Adey can thus be seen as a point of connection between the aesthetes of the London 1890s and the Bloomsbury circle that came to prominence a generation later. He is credited with over thirty bylined articles in the magazine, as well as numerous unsigned notes and reviews, and is credited with bringing a strong iconographic appreciation to the magazine. Ross's death in October 1918 was a blow to Adey, who wrote in a letter to a mutual friend five days after the bereavement that \"no one can ever be to me what he has been\". Ross made his former partner the principal beneficiary of his will, but at an unknown point in the 1920s Adey was overcome by mental challenges and had to be confined in a place of long-term care. Adey died under care in 1942; in a brief tribute to \"Burlington Magazine's\" early co-editor, Barbara Pezzini described him in May 2010 as follows: \"More Adey has often been described as a shy and diffident man and his tragic death in a mental health institution in 1942, after having lost contact with even his closest friends, seemed to taint retrospectively his whole life.\""

After practising at the Dagenham track he was spotted by his childhood hero, the former Wembley Lions rider Colin Watson, who took him to Wembley for a trial, after which he was signed by Alec Jackson. He was loaned to the Birmingham Bulldogs for whom he finished the season as top scorer, returning to Wembley in 1938 where he initially rode at reserve, establishing himself in the top five by the following year. The war interrupted his speedway career and he joined the Merchant Navy. When league racing resumed in 1946 he signed for West Ham Hammers, staying with the club into the 1950s. In 1947 he rode in Australia with the England Test team. He was part of the England teams that toured Australia in the 1951-1952 Test series. In 1952 he captained the England team against Scotland. Craven was a qualified pilot, flying to speedway matches on occasion. Two of Craven's brothers were also speedway riders; Gil Craven rode for Cradley Heath, and his youngest brother was killed in a speedway crash."

He is a two-time Da Capo Best Music Writing \"notable\" mention. Slate cited his reviews in a 2006 piece titled \"Die, Pitchfork, Die!: The indie music site that everyone loves to hate.\" Based in Des Moines, Iowa, Hogan has lived in California, Tennessee, Arizona, Massachusetts, Illinois, and New York.

At first one of Griffith Jones's travelling schoolmasters, he afterwards kept school on his own account at Capel Isaac, near Llandeilo, living in a cottage on Cwm Gwenywdy farm, in the parish of Llan Fynydd. He early joined the Calvinistic Methodists, and was a member and preacher of the Cilycwm Society. He first appeared as a hymn-writer in 1760, when twenty-two hymns from his pen were published at Carmarthen. In 1764 a second edition of this collection appeared, under the title Golwg o ben Nebo (A Prospect from the Summit of Nebo); in 1773 a third followed, and in 1775 a fourth, all at Carmarthen. Further editions were published in 1808 (Carmarthen), 1831 (Merthyr), and 1841 (Aberystwyth). In 1767 another collection, entitled Golwg ar ddull y byd hwn yn myned heibio (A Prospect of how the fashion of this world passeth away), was printed at Carmarthen, while a third, issued in 1770 or 1771 from the same press, bore the title Golwg ar y ddinas noddfa (A Prospect of the city of refuge). In 1770 Rhys published an elegy on several prominent Methodist divines (Carmarthen); Rowlands also mentions three collections of religious verse by him, which he assigns to 1774.

  "text" : "Maree Therese Luckins Davenport (born 14 March 1968) is a former Australian politician. She was a Liberal member of the Victorian Legislative Council from 1996 to 2002, representing Waverley Province. Davenport was born in Melbourne. She attended Catholic schools, graduating with HSC in 1985. She then became a Property Manager with Bruce Grant Real Estate 1987-1992 and was a licensed real estate sub-agent 1986-92. Maree had joined the Liberal Party in 1986, and was active in the Young Liberals. Maree was endorsed as the Liberal candidate for the seat of Dandenong North in 1991 and gained a swing of over 8 per cent to be unsuccessful by 19 votes. She was Ministerial Advisor to Minister for Industry and Employment and Deputy Leader of the Liberal party Hon. Phil Gude MLA from 1992 until 1996 when (as Luckins) she was elected to the Victorian Legislative Council for Waverley Province at the age of 28. She was the youngest woman elected in Victoria and the first to have a baby while serving. From 1996-2002, she chaired the Liberal Party health policy committee and was later appointed Shadow Parliamentary Secretary for Human Services with responsibility for health, housing, community services and aged care. In addition, she was appointed to serve on the Consumer Affairs, Industry and Employment, Industrial Relations, Small Business, Multicultural Affairs and Women’s Affairs Policy Committees. A Member and Deputy Chair of the Parliament’s joint all-party Scrutiny of Acts and Regulations Committee (SARC), which examines, reviews and reports on all Victorian legislation, Luckins gained invaluable insight into issues across every State Government portfolio. She also served as Chair of the Redundant Legislation Committee and Deputy Chair of the Regulation Review Committee, which examines the impact of proposed regulatory regimes and makes recommendations to Parliament to allow or disallow their implementation. She held the seat until 2002, when she attempted to transfer to the Legislative Assembly following a redistribution of Waverley Province, contesting the seat of Narre Warren North. She was defeated. Since leaving Parliament she continues to serve the community, involved in many charitable and service organisations. Davenport is a registered lobbyist and Principal of lobbying and advocacy company Phoenix Public Affairs which she founded in 2004. She was appointed as a Member of the Building Appeals Board at the Victorian Building Authority from August 2012 until December 2013. The BAB hears appeals and disputes in relation to building control matters and can waive, modify or vary the provisions of particular regulations based upon the particular case and can determine that a particular design or element of a building complies with the Act and the Regulations. In 2013 then Minister for Planning Hon Matthew Guy appointed her Chair of the Building Advisory Council (BAC) and she was reappointed by current Minister Hon Richard Wynne until 2019. The BAC is a senior industry-based group established under the Building Act 1993 to oversee the administration of the legislation and Building Regulations 2006. The Council provides advice to the Minister on issues relating to the building permit levy, qualifications and competencies required for registration of builders, assessment of applicants, consumer protection, defect rectification and insurance issues, non-conforming products, emerging technologies, training and skill needs, safety in the built environment and any other matter referred by the Minister. A current review of sunsetting regulations is underway. The BAC comprises the Victorian heads of the Property Council of Australia, Master Builders Association, Housing Industry Association, Australian Institute of Building Surveyors, Building Design Association, Australian Institute of Architects, Engineers Australia, Consumer Affairs Victoria and the Victorian Building Authority. Maree served on the Monash Children's Hospital Capital Fundraising Committee and has been appointed to the Inaugural Monash Children's Hospital Foundation by Monash Health. The new hospital is due for completion in 2017. She also serves on the Children's Hospital Dandelion Wishes Gala Ball committee. She is an Ambassador for Carlton Football Club, a Member of Australian Institute of Company Directors and Women on Boards.She has 3 children born 1994, 1997 and 2004. She is married to Marcus Davenport, Partner at Clayton Utz Lawyers."

  "text" : "Mary Ann Colclough (20 February 1836–7 March 1885) was a New Zealand feminist and social reformer. She was born in London, England on 20 February 1836. She contributed to various colonial newspapers under the pseudonym Polly Plum. Mary Ann Colclough was born in London in 1836, daughter of Susan and John Thomas Barnes, builder. She was trained as a teacher and came to New Zealand in 1859, settling in Auckland. On 9 May 1861, at Onehunga, she married Thomas Caesar Colclough, (died July 1867) formerly of Galleenstown Castle, County Dublin. There were two children, a son and a daughter. She died at Picton on 7 March 1885 from injuries received from an accident and was buried in Picton cemetery. Although her work has been overlooked and forgotten, Mary Ann Colclough was one of the earliest, and certainly among the most talented, of feminist leaders in this country. During the late sixties and early seventies and under the pseudonym of “Polly Plum”, she came to the fore as a contributor to various colonial newspapers. Her articles, which were most competently written, ranged over a variety of topics from matters of domestic interest, good housekeeping, and the like, to a forthright advocacy of “women's rights”. Her early journalistic sallies were sententious in tone, very much in accord with the literary conventions of the day, but her mature writing was concerned mainly with those issues which affected women's status in the home and community. In this phase of her career Mary Colclough showed herself to be a woman with a practical cast of mind and of high ideals and principles, who was deeply conscious of the many social problems that called for urgent redress. She kept the campaign alive by occasional letters to the press, sometimes published as far afield as the Melbourne Argus and London Times. These were invariably well expressed and to the point. It was as a lecturer, however, that “Polly Plum”, reformer and feminist, became widely known. Almost before political meetings had become the vogue, she was able to attract large audiences and, on one occasion, spoke before Governor Sir G. F. Bowen. As the outstanding champion of women's rights, she hotly attacked the “legal subjection” of her sex. She ridiculed the idea that women should be educated only for the home; all employment, including such professions as that of medicine, should be open to them. She challenged the right of the father to have sole control over his children and pointed out the injustice of the law as regards the property rights of married women. At the same time she pressed for an improvement in the working conditions of seamstresses, shop assistants, and domestics, with adequate safeguards against poverty and the problems of old age. She must have been a compelling advocate; according to contemporary evidence, “… one of the most fluent and accurate speakers we have listened to in the colonies”. In 1875 Mary Colclough began a campaign in Melbourne. She seems to have met with little success, for, like many feminist reformers of the time, she was well in advance of public opinion. The Argus commented acidly on her efforts to ameliorate the condition of her sex throughout the world and saw no ground “for weeping over the melodramatic misery” of her protéges. It is possible – though unlikely – that such rebuffs cooled her reforming ardour; nevertheless, by the late seventies she seems to have withdrawn from the public scene. She was certainly engaged in teaching at this time, first at Auckland and, later, in Canterbury. From about 1876 to 1878 she was mistress in charge of the girls' school at Rangiora, and in 1881 was infant mistress at Papanui. It is evident that her associations with the north must have weakened, for when news of her unexpected death reached Auckland in March 1885, it aroused little comment beyond the bald statement that her passing would be regretted by many who knew her in the olden times. It is not surprising that her name and work soon faded from the New Zealand scene. (reference: Alexander Hare McLintock, C.B.E., M.A., DIP.ED.

  "text" : "Maeve Murphy is an award winning screen writer and film director. She was born in Belfast in Northern Ireland. Educated at Cambridge University, while there, she was the secretary of the Cambridge Footlights. After graduating Maeve worked in theatre where she was a co-founding member of \"Trouble and Strife\" theatre company. She then worked at Parallax Pictures and moved into film. Maeve’s first short Amazing Grace starring Aiden Gillen and Clare Cathcart and was screened at the London Film Festival and the Edinburgh Film Festival before being screened on Channel Four and bought by Film Four. Her second short Salvage, starring Orla Brady, was shown on UTV (Northern Ireland) and RTÉ in Éire and was released by the BFI. Her first feature film Silent Grace, a prison drama, starring Orla Brady, Cathleen Bradley, Cara Seymour, Patrick Bergin and Conor Mullen, premiered at a market screening at Cannes and screened at the Galway, Taormina and the Hamptons Film Festival, USA, where it was nominated for the Conflict and Resolution Award in association with Nobel Peace Laureates Foundation. The film was positively reviewed by Ronnie Scheib in Variety and by Michael Dwyer in the Irish Times. Silent Grace was based on a play/screenplay that Maeve co-wrote with other members of Trouble and Strife called Now and at the Hour of our Death and inspired by Nell McCafferty's The Armagh Women. Silent Grace is a fictional drama based on real events, covering the largely untold story of Republican women prisoners’ involvement in the Dirty Protests and first Hunger Strikes of 1980/1981. Guerilla Films released it via UGC cinemas in London, Belfast and Dublin in 2004, and it was supported by the Irish Film Board. Maeve went on to win the Soka Art Award for the film for her work for lasting peace. For her second feature film Beyond The Fire a love story, starring Cara Seymour and Scot Williams she won Best UK Feature at the London Independent Film Festival 2009 and Best International Feature at the Garden State Film Festival USA 2010. It was selected for the Belfast Film Festival and the ICA New British Cinema season. It was released in the cinema by Met Film Distribution and had a London, Belfast, Dublin cinema release, supported by UKFC in 2009 and 2010. Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian said \"its heartfelt, unironic belief in the power of love is attractive.\"  There was press controversy about the film in the Irish Independent regarding RTÉ’s decision not to acquire it due to the feeling there was \"no appetite for the subject matter\". Victims of religious sexual abuse expressed their concern. TV3 then stepped in and it was instantly broadcast across Ireland in April 2010 and May 2010. In 2011 Beyond The Fire was sold to the BBC for UK TV transmission by Frank Mannion of Swipe Films. Beyond the Fire was subsequently broadcast on BBC2 on 22 March 2013 and also made available on BBC iPlayer. It was the Daily Mail \"Pick of The Day\", one of \"Best 8 TV Movies of the Week\" in The Sabotage Times and awarded 5 stars on the MyTVGuide listings. Maeve won the Sub-ti International short film Award 2011 for her comedy drama short Sushi, starring Luanna Priestman and Junichi Kajioka. Venice Days were co judges of that short film award and the win was announced at the Venice Film Festival and in Variety Magazine on 4 September 2011. Sushi is an extract from her new austerity comedy caper feature film Taking Stock, starring Kelly Brook and Scot Williams. During the shoot and release it garnered notable coverage in the UK press. Taking Stock was selected for its UK premiere by the 2015 Raindance Film Festival. Taking Stock was selected for the 2015 Monaco International Film Festival where it won 4 awards: Independent Spirit Award: Taking Stock directed by Maeve Murphy; Best Supporting Actor; Best Producer; Best Cinematography. Taking Stock showed at the 2016 Garden State Film Festival where the film and director Maeve Murphy and producer Geoff Austin won the Bud Abbott Award for feature length comedy. The film also showed at the WIND International Film Festival in LA where Maeve won the award for best female director in the comedy section. Also, Junichi Kajioka won the award for best supporting actor.  Indiewire said \"Maeve Murphy is a name to look out for\".  Mark Kermode of the Observer said of Maeve that she was a \"Talented writer/director\" and the Huffington Post reviewed the film very positively. Taking Stock was released by Independent Distributor Swipe Films in cinemas across the UK on 5 Feb 2016 and bought by Netflix in August 2016."

He joined Canterbury Agricultural College in 1937 as a lecturer and after the war led the revival of Association of University Staff of New Zealand (later Association of Staff in Tertiary Education, now the Tertiary Education Union). In 1952 he became director of Lincoln. In 1962, the organisation was renamed Lincoln College, and Burns' title changed to principal. In the 1959 New Year Honours Burns was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire, and was promoted to Knight Commander of the same order in the 1972 Queen's Birthday Honours. He retired from Lincoln in 1974, and his legacy is that he gave it its strong research focus, which has gained international recognition. In the same year, he was awarded an honorary doctorate of science (DSc) from the University of Canterbury. Burns retired to Christchurch, where he died on 17 October 1986. Lincoln became an independent university in 1990, The Burns Wing on Lincoln's campus commemorates him."

  "text" : "Michael Lynch, FRHistS, FRSE, FSA Scot (born 15 June 1946) is a retired Scottish historian and a leading expert in the history of the Scottish Reformation and pre-modern urbanisation in the Scottish kingdom. In 2010, five years after his retirement, he was described by one reviewer as 'one of the most influential historians in Scotland of the last thirty years', whose work has been characterised by an 'ability to bring ecclesiastical, cultural and urban perspectives to traditional Scottish political and governmental histories', as well as the ability 'to clarify a difficult theory within a deceptively simple phrase'. Lynch was born in Aberdeen. He was educated at Aberdeen Grammar School before taking degrees at the University of Aberdeen and the University of London. His first academic post was a lectureship in the history department at University College, Bangor (now Bangor University) from 1971-1979. From there he took up a lectureship in the Scottish history department at the University of Edinburgh, where, in 1993, he was appointed Sir William Fraser Professor of Scottish History and Palaeography, holding this Chair—the oldest and most distinguished Scottish history professorship in the world—until his retirement in 2005. As Professor he served as chairman of the Ancient Monuments Board for Scotland (1996-2002), president of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland (1996-1999), and a trustee of the National Museum of Scotland (2002-2005). Upon his retirement, Lynch was named an honorary research professor at Edinburgh, and latterly an honorary professorial fellow at the same university. Lynch's monographs to date include: \n*  Edinburgh and the Reformation (1981), winner of the Scottish Arts Council Literary Award \n*  Scotland: A New History (1991), winner of the Scottish Arts Council Literary Award Lynch's editorial publications include: \n*  The Early Modern Town in Scotland (1986) \n*  The Scottish Medieval Town (1987) (co-editor with M.

  "text" : "Dame Margery Freda Perham DCMG CBE FBA (6 September 1895 – 19 February 1982) was a British historian of, and writer on, African affairs. She was born in Bury, Lancashire, and educated at the School of S. Anne, Abbots Bromley and St Hugh's College, Oxford. After completing her Oxford degree she became an Assistant Lecturer in History at the University of Sheffield in 1917. In 1922, as a result of illness, she took a year’s leave which she spent in Somaliland with her sister’s family, beginning her lifelong interest in the British African colonies. In 1924 she became a Tutor and subsequently Fellow in Modern History and Modern Greats (philosophy, politics and economics) at St Hugh’s College. In 1929 she was awarded a Rhodes Scholarship, and from July 1929 until early 1932 visited the United States, the Pacific islands, Australia, New Zealand, and much of Africa south of the Sahara. In 1932 she was awarded a Rockefeller Travelling Fellowship for travel and study in East Africa and the Sudan. During the 1930s she wrote the first of many books on Africa, including Native Administration in Nigeria (1937) and African Discovery (1942; jointly with Jack Simmons), and from 1935 to 1939 was Research Lecturer in Colonial Administration at Oxford. In 1939 she was appointed the first official and only woman fellow of the newly founded Nuffield College, Oxford, and was also elected Reader in Colonial Administration, a post she held until 1948. Her teaching at this time was almost entirely devoted to the first and second Devonshire courses for colonial servants, though later she played a part in the development of universities for the new African leaders and experts, and helped in the initiation of the Oxford Colonial Records Project. Her books, reports and papers provided the basis for the Oxford Institute of Colonial Studies, to which she was appointed Director, 1945-1948. Her official biography of Lord Lugard appeared in two volumes in 1956 and 1960, and she published four volumes of Lugard’s diaries (1959–63). In 1961 she became the first woman to deliver the Reith Lectures, her lectures being published as The Colonial Reckoning. She was appointed CBE in 1948 and DCMG in 1965. She received honorary degrees from several universities, and was made an Honorary Fellow of St Hugh’s College, Oxford, in 1962. She was the first President of the African Studies Association of the UK (ASAUK), 1963-64. In 1968 she was criticised strongly when she espoused the cause of Biafra in the Nigerian Civil War. After a visit to Nigeria she recanted her earlier views publicly on radio and television. She was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1969."

Moll worked with many German artists throughout her life and was a sculptor. She stated once that she would rather do sculptures because she tried to avoid competition between her and her husband, a painter. Moll was highly inspired by Henri Matisse as a young artist and spent her life contributing to his form of art, although at times her art was destroyed and criticized by Nazis because it was modern art. Moll was known for being very high spirited when it came to Matisse, was known as the “Director’s Wife” during some time of her later life and known for making an “ultra-modern house” in Berlin designed by Hans Scharoun, German architect best known for his design on the Berlin Philharmonic concert hall in Berlin, Germany."

Freedman was born in Philadelphia, and became a radio announcer, writer and entertainer, before joining the staff of a music publishing company. He joined ASCAP in 1942. One of his first successes as a writer, credited as Ray Freedman, was \"Sioux City Sue\", a hit record for the song's co-writer Dick Thomas in 1945, and later recorded by many others including Gene Autry, Bing Crosby, Bob Wills and Willie Nelson. His other successful songs, several of which were written with Morty Berk and Frank Capano, included \"Dreamy Old New England Moon\", \"Heartbreaker\" (1947), and \"Tea Leaves\" (1948). Freedman wrote the words to the famous song, \"Rock Around the Clock\", the tune for which was credited to \"Jimmy DeKnight\", a pseudonym used by music publisher and promoter James E. Myers. The song was published in early 1953, though there is evidence that it was written in 1952, and there are claims that Freedman wrote the song in its entirety. Although Bill Haley & His Comets were supposed to be the first to record it, a dispute between Myers and Dave Miller, the owner of Essex Records, prevented Haley from doing so. The first recording of the song was made by an Italian-American novelty group, Sonny Dae & His Knights. Haley finally recorded it in 1954 for Decca Records and in 1955, the song became a no. 1 record, one of the first of the rock and roll era. Freedman died in 1962 at the age of 69."

  "text" : "Maurice Nicolle (1 March 1862 – 20 August 1932) was a French physician and microbiologist born in Rouen. He was the brother of biologist Charles Nicolle (1866–1936). He studied medicine in Rouen and Paris, becoming an interne to the hospitals of Paris in 1885. In 1887 he continued his internship under histologist Albert von Kölliker (1817–1905) at the University of Würzburg. In 1890 he supported his doctorate with a thesis on a study of diseases of the myocardium, titled Contribution à l'étude des affections du myocarde: les grandes scléroses cardiaques. Afterwards he took courses in microbiology at the Pasteur Institute. From 1893 he studied biological staining techniques with Victor Morax (1866–1935), publishing two papers on the staining properties of ammoniated ruthenium oxychloride with Jean Cantacuzène (1863–1934). In 1893 he succeeded Waldemar Haffkine (1860–1930) as an instructor of microbiology at the Pasteur Institute, shortly afterwards being called to the Imperial Institute of Bacteriology of Constantinople, where he conducted research on pasteurellosis, rinderpest, bovine piroplasmosis and Aleppo button, et al. In Constantinople he also worked on improving methods for preparation of diphtheria toxin. In 1901, following disagreements with Turkish authorities and French representatives, he resigned his post at the bacteriological institute of Constantinople and returned to the Pasteur Institute. At the Pasteur Institute he performed investigations on hypersensitivity and immunity (action of antibodies, antigens and antitoxins) following inoculations of glanders bacilli into guinea pigs. From 1906 with zoologist Felix Mesnil (1868–1938), he tested benzopurpurine dyes supplied by Bayer Pharmaceutical as trypanocidal agents for destruction of the parasite associated with trypanosomiasis. In 1910 he succeeded Jean Binot (1867–1909) as laboratory head of microbiology courses at the Pasteur Institute. In 1920 he experienced an attack of paralysis on the right side of his body, followed by a second attack in 1926 that forced him into retirement. In 1918 Nicolle became a member of the Société de biologie."

Described as an iconoclast, he is known for his versatile, adventurous and eclectic approach to repertoire, including the incorporation of electric guitar into his concert programs and recordings. Nicolella's repertoire ranges from the Baroque to the present. His most recent recording is his own arrangement of the complete cello suites of Johann Sebastian Bach; while his past four recordings focused on contemporary music, including his own compositions, alongside those of Toru Takemitsu, Elliott Carter, Luciano Berio, Hans Werner Henze and Steve Reich. He has championed music by such emerging composers as Laurence Crane and Jacob ter Veldhuis and has premiered many works written for him by other composers, including: Joshua Kohl, (of the Degenerate Art Ensemble), David Mesler, Christopher DeLaurenti and John Fitz Rogers, who in 2001 wrote the forty-five-minute piece Transit for Nicolella, scored for electric guitar and computer generated sound. His own compositions include works for solo guitar, chamber music with guitar, a classical guitar concerto (Guitar Concerto), and an electric guitar concerto (Ten Years Passed). His most recent major composition for soprano, guitar (electric and classical) and orchestra, The Flame of the Blue Star of Twilight, was premiered by the Northwest Symphony Orchestra and soprano Alexandra Picard in April 2012. He has performed and collaborated with a wide range of groups and artists including: violinist Gil Shaham, rock singer Jon Anderson, best known for his work as lead vocalist in the progressive rock band Yes, broadway legends Bernadette Peters and Brian Stokes Mitchell, the Seattle Guitar Trio, jazz singer Johnaye Kendrick, classical music comedians Igudesman and Joo and is a frequent guest with the Seattle Symphony.

Her body was discovered a week later close to her home, and the murder sparked a manhunt involving several hundred police officers. A suspect was identified at the time, but there was insufficient evidence to charge him, and the crime remained unsolved for over four decades until a cold case review in the 2000s. In 2007, 70-year-old Anthony Hall – already serving a life sentence for the murder of another teenager – was charged with Thomas's murder. However, a judge subsequently ruled the charge should be stayed owing to the length of time that had passed since the incident. Hall subsequently died in prison."

  "text" : "(This is a Chinese name; the family name is Mei.) Mei Baojiu (Chinese: 梅葆玖; pinyin: Méi Bǎojiǔ) (29 March 1934 – 25 April 2016) was a contemporary Peking opera artist, also a performer of the Dan role type in Peking Opera and Kunqu opera, the leader of Mei Lanfang Peking Opera troupe in Beijing Peking Opera Theatre. Mei’s father Mei Lanfang was one of the most famous Peking opera performers. Mei Baojiu was the ninth and youngest child of Mei Lanfang. For this reason, he was called Baojiu, since in Chinese, jiu means nine. Mei Baojiu was the master of the second generation of Méi School descendant, he was also Mei Lanfang’s only child who is now a performer of the Dan role of the Peking Opera. From childhood, Mei had learned Peking Opera from many artists. Mei Baojiu’s first opera teacher was Wang Youqing (王幼卿), the nephew of Wang Yaoqing (王瑶卿), who had been the teacher of Mei Lanfang. Tao Yuzhi (陶玉芝) was his teacher of martial arts, while Zhu Chuanming (朱传茗), the famous performer of the Dan role type in Kunqu opera, taught him Kunqu. After that Mei learned the Dan role from Zhu Qinxin (朱琴心). Mei’s regular performances of traditional opera include Farewell My Concubine, Guifei Intoxicated (貴妃醉酒), Lady General Mu Takes Command (穆桂英挂帅), The story of Yang Guifei (太真外传), Luo Shen (洛神), Xi Shi (西施), etc. Mei has made significant contributions to cultural exchanges and promoting Peking Opera culture. Meanwhile, he also trains more than twenty students, such as Li Shengsu (李胜素), Dong Yuanyuan (董圆圆), Zhang Jing (张晶), Zhang Xinyue (张馨月), Hu Wenge (胡文阁) (the only male student), Tian Hui (田慧), Wei Haimin (魏海敏)."

Bridel is credited with the isolation of a number of new glucosides, and with Émile Bourquelot, he isolated verbascose, a new sugar extracted from the roots of Verbascum thapsus. In addition he performed research of enzymes (invertin, rhamnodiastase) and enzyme mixtures (emulsin); did a study of sirop de gomme (gum syrup) and conducted investigations on the activity of certain glucosides in plant color changes during desiccation. He was the author of 175 scientific articles, of which 55 were co-written with Émile Bourquelot. From 1920 to 1927 he was editor of the Bulletin de la Société de Chimie Biologique."

  "text" : "Michael O'Sullivan (1934–1971) was an American actor, \"larger than life,\"  who appeared on Broadway, at Lincoln Center, on the London stage, at San Francisco's Actor's Workshop and in many regional theaters and festivals of America throughout his brief career in the late 1950s and '60s. Clive Barnes of the New York Times designated O'Sullivan as \"one of America's best young actors.\"  Raised in Phoenix, AZ, O'Sullivan studied and acted at the University of Denver and the Goodman Memorial Theater in Chicago, then played major roles (including a remarkable \"prancing\" Pandarus in Troilus and Cressida) at the Oregon Shakespeare Festival in 1957 and 1958. He was one of a ten actor corps hired by the San Francisco Actor's Workshop under a 1960 Ford Foundation grant to the company, and he came to national prominence with his portrayal of the title role in the Workshop's 1961 King Lear as a \"preening, deranged, screeching Lear, imbued with primordial divinity,\" under Herbert Blau's direction. In 1963 he won the Obie and the Laura D'Annunzio Awards for his portrayal of the Director in Pirandello's Six Characters in Search of an Author, directed by William Ball, a role he also performed in London, and in 1965 he performed the title role in Ball's staging of Molière's Tartuffe for the new Repertory Company of Lincoln Center, prompting critic Howard Taubman to praise O'Sullivan for showing \"how a Molière performance can be larger than life, and not out of focus... [moving] between cringing, shuffling humility and outrageous arrogance.\" O'Sullivan was a nominee for the Tony award in 1966 for his role as the villain Sedgwick in the Broadway musical, It's a Bird, It's a Plane, It's Superman. His last New York appearance was in 1969 in Georges Feydeau's  A Flea in Her Ear with the American Conservatory Theater at the ANTA Theater, and Clive Barnes said of that performance, \"zany... galvanic lunacy... this is great farce acting.\" In July 1971, Michael O'Sullivan was found dead in his San Francisco apartment at the age of 37, a bottle of sleeping pills by his side. It is not known whether his death was accidental or a suicide."
