  "text" : "Neville Meade (12 September 1948 – 13 March 2010) was a British boxer from Swansea in south Wales. Born in Montserrat, he moved to Wales at the age of nine. He rose to prominence when he won the gold medal in the heavyweight division at the 1974 Commonwealth Games in New Zealand. He turned professional in 1974 and won the Welsh Heavyweight title in 1976 and then followed this with the British title in 1981. He retired in 1983 after a failed defence of his British title. Meade was known for his big-hitting style of fighting with very few of his bouts going the distance. Of his 20 professional wins, 18 came via knockout. Despite this ability, Meade lacked motivation in training and during the middle of his career, with his weight reaching above 17 stone, he suffered a lack of form that saw him lose seven out of nine fights. He took on a new trainer, Jimmy Bromfield, in 1979 and this saw a change in his fortune which led to Meade taking the British Heavyweight title."

His cartoons were followed by generations of Bengali middle-class people without ever knowing his true identity. He was a regular contributor to Shankar's weekly, published by political cartoonist K. Shankar Pillai. Even though his works appeared exclusively in Bengali-language print media, his work had uniquely close ties to the leftist movement, rendering his drawings and ideas peerless."

  "text" : "Nina Menkes is a film director who has completed seven features and a number of shorts in which she controlled all aspects of production, including directing, writing, camera operating, and editing picture and sound on her own productions. She has worked in various media including Super-8, 16mm, 35mm and lately HD. Her unusual films express time, space, memory and history, through a lens of the present in works that are \"an object lesson in the cinematic possibilities standard narrative misses\". (Godfrey Cheshire, Variety). Menkes's films have often met with hostility, as she confronts and expresses violence in a radical way. She has referred to herself as a witch, and Dennis Lim, writing in the New York Times, called her a \"cinematic sorceress of the self.\" According to film critic and historian Berenice Reynaud: \"[Menkes] does not inscribe herself in a recognizable avant-garde tradition, she has no master and no disciples, which forces her to reinvent the history of cinema in her own terms, to struggle alone with formal and conceptual issues. This loneliness – both æsthetic and economic – is also embedded in the texture of the work. Yet, it is not the cliché loneliness of the romantic victim – it is more akin to the \"night of the soul\" evoked by the mystics, Dante's travel though a dark wood – or the heroic solitude of the knight-errant.\" For many years, Nina Menkes collaborated with Tinka Menkes, her sister, who was both her actress and creative partner. Their films have been shown in major international film festivals including Sundance, Rotterdam, Locarno, London, Viennale, San Francisco, Edinburgh, Cairo and Toronto as well as at La Cinematheque Francaise, The British Film Institute, the ICA in London, the Beijing Film Academy in China, the Whitney Museum of American Art, the Museum of Modern Art in New York, LACMA and MOCA in Los Angeles. Menkes was one of the first women to present a feature film at the Sundance Film Festival (Queen of Diamonds 1990 in dramatic competition). She has received a Los Angeles Film Critics Association Award for her first feature Magdalena Viraga, a Guggenheim Fellowship, a Creative Capital Award in the discipline of Moving Image  two Fellowships from the National Endowment for the Arts, an Annenberg Foundation Independent Media Grant, an American Film Institute Independent Filmmaker Award, three Western States Regional Media Arts Fellowships and two Fulbright Fellowships—one to the Middle East/North Africa, and one to India. Menkes was also a recipient of a DAAD Artist in Residence in Berlin Award, during her residency she tried to face the brutal truth of her family history. Her mother's family were German Jews who fled Hitler's genocide, settling in Jerusalem in 1933; her father's Austrian Jewish family were gassed to death: trauma, alienation and murderous violence are central to her work. In 2002 Menkes served as DoP and co-creator of the feature documentary Massaker, shot in Beirut, about the Sabra and Shatila massacre, It premiered at the Berlinale in 2005 and received a FIPRESCI Award.In 2011, the Menkes's film The Bloody Child was chosen as one of the five most important films of the past fifty years by the Jeonju International FIlm Festival in collaboration with the celebration of five decades of the Viennale International Film Festival, in Vienna, Austria. \"The Bloody Child\" was selected to represent the 1990s. Menkes's first fiction film without Tinka's participation, Phantom Love (2007) premiered at Sundance to rave reviews. The film features Marina Shoif and Juliette Marquis in an unsettling examination of an enmeshed family in crisis. Shot on 35mm black and white film, DP Christopher Soos controlled the lighting with Menkes on camera. Produced by Kevin Ragsdale at KNR Productions. Her most recent feature Dissolution (2010), shot in Tel Aviv in Hebrew (with some Arabic) marked her first collaboration with the Israeli David Fire, a musician and philosopher, who played the lead role as well as collaborated with Menkes on writing and editing. The trademark stunning cinematography was a collaboration between Itay Marom's lighting design and Nina Menkes on camera. The film received the \"Anat Pirchi Award for Best Drama\" at the Jerusalem International Film festival in 2010, and was hailed by The New York Times as \"exquisite and remarkable\". Nina Menkes holds citizenship in Germany, the USA and Israel. She has an MFA with high honors from the UCLA Film School and has taught film directing at the USC School of Cinematic Arts, at the Film and Television Institute of India (FTII), Tel Aviv University's Department of Cinema, Israel, and California Institute of the Arts. The moving image collection of Nina Menkes is held at the Academy Film Archive."

  "text" : "Nicolae Fleva (Romanian pronunciation: [nikoˈla.e ˈfleva]; also known as Nicu Fleva, Francized Nicolas Fléva; 1840 – August 4, 1920) was a Wallachian, later Romanian politician, political journalist and lawyer. Known especially for his involvement in political incidents, and for a stated patriotism bordering on demagogy, he tested all political formulas that Romania's two-party system would allow. His activity in the public sphere brought a decades-long presence in the Assembly of Deputies and a mandate as Mayor of Bucharest between 1884 and 1886. After beginnings with the National Liberal Party, which he helped establish and represented in court, Fleva came to oppose its monopoly on power. He experimented with creating a third party, negotiated common platforms for the various opposition forces, including the Conservatives and the Junimea society, during contiguous National Liberal administrations. Fleva was notoriously involved in the major scandals of the 1880s, when his ridicule of National Liberal power generated street battles and sparked two separate shooting incidents. At the time, \"Flevist\" groups were seen as the leading voice of middle class discontentment, and formed one of several currents pushing for the adoption of universal male suffrage. Fleva returned into the National Liberal camp when he was refused a leading role in Conservative cabinets, and, in 1895–1896, was the Internal Affairs Minister. He clashed with the party over a number of issues, returned into opposition, and was later (1899–1900) the Conservative Minister of Agriculture. Involved as both accused and whistleblower in some corruption scandals of the early 20th century, he was sent Ambassador to Italy, and ended his career with a stint in the Conservative-Democratic Party. During World War I, Fleva brought suspicion on himself as a supporter, and possible agent of influence, of the Central Powers."

However, Osman III was a weak sultan and was under the influence of Nişancı Ali Pasha, Naili Abdullah's rival. Naili Abdullah Pasha was dismissed by the sultan after only three months in the office on August 24, 1755. He was then appointed as the governor of Crete. Three years later, he was appointed the governor of Jeddah (in modern Saudi Arabia) upon his request. However, he died in Medina on his way to Jeddah in August 1758."

  "text" : "Neville Blyth (March 1825 – 15 February 1890) was a South Australian colonial politician. Blyth was some two years younger than his brother Arthur Blyth, was also born in a suburb of Manchester, educated at King Edward's Grammar School under the Rev. Dr. Lee (later the first Bishop of Manchester), and with his family sailed to South Australia in 1839.Early in the forties Neville joined his brother Arthur at their father's ironmonger business, and the two were actively engaged in the trade up to 1865. At his father's death Neville Blyth was sole executor of his estate and, characteristically, first repaid debts his father had incurred in England but legally wiped out by his insolvency. Blyth was elected a member of the South Australian House of Assembly for East Torrens at the general election in March 1860, as colleague of Henry Mildred, represented that district during three Parliaments (in 1865 with Charles Henry Goode as colleague) until July 1867, when he resigned rather than be forced to break a promise, and was succeeded by Daniel Fisher. In April, 1868, he was elected to the fifth Parliament as member of the Assembly for the Encounter Bay, with William Everard as his colleague. He was Treasurer of South Australia from 21 September to 13 October 1868 in the Hart cabinet and the crisis that preceded the formation of Strangways' Government. Having represented Encounter Bay until the end of the fifth Parliament he was chosen by the District of Victoria in August 1871 to succeed William Paltridge as the colleague of James Park Dawson Laurie. In 1871 he stood for the District of Encounter Bay, but was defeated and decided to quit politics, but in March, 1877, he was elected member for North Adelaide to fill the vacancy left by his brother, by then Sir Arthur Blyth, when he was appointed Agent General. In the last Boucaut Ministry, which lasted from 26 October 1877 until 27 September 1878, Neville Blyth was Minister of Education, and had as his colleagues J. P. Boucaut, Sir William Morgan, Charles Mann, G. C. Hawker and T. Playford. Forced by ill-health to return to England, he resigned from politics in November 1878 and settled in Sutton in Surrey, living off the rents from his substantial South Australian properties. He died eleven years later. Blyth was a communicant of the Church of England, but of liberal persuasion. He strongly opposed State aid to churches and fought for the rights of the working classes. Blyth supported C. Emily Clark (sister of John Howard Clark) and Catherine Helen Spence in the formation of the \"Boarding-out Society\" for orphans."

  "text" : "Ng Chiau-tong (Chinese: 黃昭堂; pinyin: Huáng Zhāotáng; Pe̍h-ōe-jī: N̂g Chiau-tông) (1932 – November 17, 2011) was a Taiwanese pro-independence activist who served as the Chairman of the World United Formosans for Independence (WUFI) until his death in 2011. Ng was born in Tainan Prefecture, Japanese Taiwan (modern-day Tainan, Taiwan) in 1932. He graduated from National Taiwan University in 1958 before moving to Japan, where he obtained a master's degree from Tokyo Imperial University, now the University of Tokyo. He participated in his first pro-Taiwanese independence demonstration while in Tokyo while studying for his master's degree. In 1960, Ng established the Taiwan Youth Society in Tokyo, which later became a branch of the World United Formosans for Independence in Japan. His pro-independence activism in Japan lead to a blacklist by the Kuomintang, which governed the Republic of China (Taiwan) at the time. The Kuomintang banned Ng from returning to Taiwan. Ng was finally permitted to return to Taiwan from exile in 1992 by the Lee Teng-hui administration. He became Chairman of the World United Formosans for Independence in 1995 and held the position until his death in 2011. He served as a presidential adviser to former DPP President Chen Shui-bian. Ng helped organize the February 28, 2004 hand-in-hand rally, in which one million Taiwanese joined in a human chain along the west coast of Taiwan from Keelung to Eluanbi, which was seen as a key event in President Chen Shui-bian's 2004 re-election campaign. Ng's support for Taiwanese independence remained steadfast throughout his life, though his political positions did evolve as he aged. He originally advocated for what he called \"swift independence\" and the completed removal of the Republic of China government placed on the island by Chiang Kai-shek following end of World War II and the 1949 Chinese Revolution. Later, Ng promoted a more gradual dissolution of the Republic of China's political infrastructure through consensus, \"The ROC is like a cap on the top of our head. If it’s rainy, we’ll have to wear it for now, but we are waiting for a sunny day to take it off...I am very optimistic. The Taiwan independence movement will succeed someday.\" Ng Chiau-tong suffered a heart attack while undergoing routine sinus surgery at Koo Foundation Sun Yat-Sen Cancer Center in Taipei. He was taken to National Taiwan University Hospital (NTU), where he died at approximately 11:00 a.m. on November 17, 2011, at the age of 79. The Chairman of the opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), Tsai Ing-wen told reporters, \"The Democratic Progressive Party was grief-stricken to learn about Ng’s passing. He has devoted his whole life to Taiwan’s democracy and freedom and his spirit will live with us forever and call on us to fight for the well-being of the next generation. May he rest in peace.\" Historian Lee Yeng-chyh also called Ng's unexpected death, \"great loss for the Taiwan independence movement.\""

  "text" : "Nonhelema (ca. 1720 – 1786) was a Shawnee chieftess during the 18th century and the sister of Cornstalk, with whom she migrated to Ohio and founded neighboring villages. Nonhelema, known as a warrior, stood nearly six feet, six inches. Some called her \"The Grenadier\" or \"The Grenadier Squaw\", due to the large height of 18th-century grenadiers. Nonhelema had three husbands. The first was a Shawnee man. The third was Shawnee Chief Moluntha. She also had a son, Thomas McKee through her relationship with Indian Agent Colonel Alexander McKee. She also had a son Captain Butler/Tamanatha through her relationship with Colonel Richard Butler (general) Nonhelema was present at the Battle of Bushy Run in 1764. She and her brother, Cornstalk, supported peace with the infant United States. In Summer 1777, Nonhelema warned Americans that parts of the Shawnee nation had traveled to Fort Detroit to join the British. Following Cornstalk's 1777 murder at Fort Randolph, Nonhelema continued to support the Americans, warning both Fort Randolph and Fort Donnally of impending attacks. She dressed Philip Hammond and John Pryor as Indians so they could go the 160 miles to Fort Donnally to give warning. In retribution, her herds of cattle were destroyed. Nonhelema led her followers to the Coshocton area, near Lenape Chief White Eyes. In 1780, Nonhelema served as a guide and translator for Augustin de La Balme in his campaign to the Illinois country. In 1785, Nonhelema petitioned Congress for a 1,000-acre grant in Ohio, as compensation for her services during the American Revolutionary War. Congress instead granted her a pension of daily rations, and an annual allotment of blankets and clothing. Nonhelema and Moluntha were captured by General Benjamin Logan in 1786. Moluntha was killed by an American soldier, and Nonhelema was detained at Fort Pitt. While there, she helped compile a dictionary of Shawnee words. She was later released, but died in December 1786. Nonhelema is the subject of Warrior Woman, a novel authored by James Alexander Thom and Dark Rain Thom."

Elmaliah was known to have particularly strong kick, which helped him to score many goals. Among his achievements, he won the award of the top scorer in the 1954–55 season after scoring 30 goals in 26 games for Beitar Tel Aviv, a record that held until April 11, 2016 when Eran Zahavi broke it. Elmaliah is remembered by a beret that he put on his head at the beginning of his professional career, a relic of his religious and observant. There is also known case in which during a league game he dropped his beret on the opponent's goal. Elmaliah dribbled back, put again the beret and continued to attack his opponents without disturbing the game. Elmaliah ability as an outstanding offensive footballer brought teams from all over Israel to pursue him and try to convince him to play their dimensions. For example, he was invited to strengthen Maccabi Tel Aviv squad during a long journey of games in Yugoslavia. Maccabi Petah Tikva also offered him a share of Egged if he would play in its ranks but Elmaliah remained loyal to Beitar Tel Aviv. Elmaliah also had two appearances for Israel's national team. He died at the age of 61."

Nurullah's impressive physique (standing 2.18 m (7'2) tall and weighing 175 kg (387 lb), although exaggerated figures have also existed) was then noted as a tackle for finding eager opponents. Nevertheless, Nurullah trained in Greco-Roman wrestling and started competing at Folies Bergère by 1895. Nurullah is renowned for his long rivalries with two formidable exponents of Greco-Roman wrestling; Paul Pons and Kara Ahmet. Nurullah quit wrestling in 1911 and died a year later in İstanbul."

Her elder brother was Borut Žerjav, journalist in Paris, and her twin sister was Tatjana, who died young from tuberculosis (1943). Nada Abarth Zerjav spent her early childhood in Graz and Ljubljana. As her father and politician Žerjav was preventively arrested and imprisoned during WWI in the Ljubljana Castle and in Graz by the Austro-Hungarian authorities for his \"notorious pro-Serbian attitudes\", she lived some time at her grandparents. After the early death of both her parents from tuberculosis she was educated at Munich and Paris. Later she lived in Ljubljana. One of her close friends was painter Zoran Mušič. She was wounded during the war (attack on A. Praprotnik in Ljubljana, February 20, 1942). On November 28, 1949, she was married to Carlo Abarth, the well known Turin–Automobile-Industrialist. Nada Abarth-Žerjav and Carlo Abarth met in 1944 at Lake Garda (Italy). Nada Abarth supported her husband during the founding period of the Abarth-works as later on in every possible way. She initiated the contact to Tazio Nuvolari which became important during the first years of the existence of the Squadra Abarth. She spoke seven languages which enabled her to engage in public-relations in foreign countries as well. Even after the divorce in 1979 she remained on friendly terms with Carlo Abarth and after his death she continued to admire him greatly. The couple had no children. After the breakup of Yugoslavia 1991 Nadina Abarth-Zerjav, who had had the Italian citizenship since 1949, applied for the Slovenian citizenship also and finally received it in 1997 in honour of her families history. Nada Abarth lived in Turin for over 50 years and was well known there. She left Turin in November 1999 for reasons of ill health and moved to nephew’s family in Ljubljana where she died on September 17, 2000. She was buried four days later in her families gravesite, a protected monument in the Žale cemetery in Ljubljana."

  "text" : "Newton Chandler (19 September 1893 – 24 March 1997) was an Australian rules footballer who played with Carlton in the Victorian Football League (VFL) from 1919 through 1924. He was a member of the Brunswick Football Club prior to being recruited to Carlton at the age of 19, but his debut for the team was delayed by the onset of World War I. He played a total of 69 games, including the 1921 VFL Grand Final, where his team lost to Richmond. After retiring from active competition in 1924, he served as the club's Secretary (1934–1939, 1956), Vice-President (1940–1943), and Treasurer (1944–1958). His long life — he lived to the age of 103 — and dedication to the club earned him the nickname \"The Grand Old Man of Carlton\"."

  "text" : "Natasha Staniszewski (born May 24, 1979) is a sports reporter and host for SportsCentre, TSN's flagship news and information show. Natasha was taken to her brother's hockey games as a child and, like many Edmontonians, was a fan of the Edmonton Oilers. She was an athlete herself, excelling in basketball and volleyball, winning a provincial title in the latter in high school. She then earned a business degree from the University of Alberta but decided at the age of 26 that she did not want to pursue a career in business, but rather a career as a sports broadcaster. She went on to complete her broadcasting degree at NAIT in Edmonton. After that, she moved to five different cities in two years. Natasha began her career in 2006 at CTV Yorkton, initially working as a news reporter before moving to sports reporting at CTV Prince Albert. In 2007, Natasha relocated to CTV Saskatoon as the station's sports anchor and reporter covering the WHL and university athletics. Two years later, Natasha returned home to CTV Edmonton in 2009, where she has covered the Edmonton Oilers and Eskimos and the 2010 Grey Cup, and anchored the station’s top-rated nightly and weekend sportscasts. After covering the 2010 Grey Cup, TSN vice-president Mark Melliere was looking for someone to cover TSN's Jennifer Hedger's anchor position while she left for maternity leave. Staniszewski has co-hosted the weekend Sportscentre alongside Bryan Mudryk briefly following Holly Horton's departure in 2011, but has remained there since July 6, 2013. Soon after, Staniszewski moved over to the morning Sportscentre co-hosting with Kate Beirness, becoming the first regular female duo to anchor on the show."

He was initially considered an outsider, however, he managed to prove himself capable of the job. He was elected captain of Osnabrück, to establish law and order, despite weak rule by the bishop. In 1350, he lost some territory to the bishop of Osnabrück, including Fuurstenau, Schwagsdorf and Berge. However, he acquired Altbruchhausen from his father-in-law, although he later had to abdicate there, due to his high debts. Nicholas inherited the County of Schwerin from his brother Otto I in 1357.

Early in life he served in the French army, and it was not until he was thirty-four years of age that he commenced the study of art in the Academy at Antwerp. He afterwards visited Italy and Switzerland, and resided for some time at Geneva. He painted a landscape for Catherine the Great, for which he was handsomely rewarded, and many others are to be found at Liège, and in Germany and England. He died in his native city in 1811. His biography, with a list of his pictures, was published by Félix Alexandre Joseph Van Hulst in 1837. \n* A shepherd and his herd near the water \n* Italianate landscape with peasants resting \n* The morning \n* Woman drinking coffee"

A Greek, Niphon was born in the village of Lukovë, Himarë municipality, that time part of the Despotate of Epirus (modern south Albania). From an early age he went to the monastery of Geromerion (near Filiates) where he became a hesychast. Soon after he moved to the nearby monastery of Mesopotamon, where he became a monk. Niphon went to the monastic state of Mount Athos sometime after 1335, where he dedicated himself to ascetism, under the guidance of the monastic Elders, Neilos Erichiotes, Theognostos and Maximos Kausokalybites. In 1345, Niphon was the protos of Mount Athos. At that time Athos came under the protection of the Serbian Tsar Stefan Dusan, who accused him for heresy and Bogomilism, but he was successfully defended by Gregory Palamas. In 1347-8 Niphon was tried and deposed from his position as protos after being accused by fellow monks of heresy. He was succeeded by the Serbian monk Antonios. His deposition is regarded as either part of the struggles between rival religious factions that predated the Serbian control of the Athonite community or attempts of Stefan Dusan to gain control of Athos by appointing a Serbian official as its head. This intervention resulted in seriouscontradictions between the Greek dignitaries and the Serbs of Hilandar monastery of Athos. During 1355-63 he was again accused of heresy when his servant Bardarius revealed before dying that he had joined the Euchite movement, but was defended by Patriarch Callistus. It is considered unclear from contemporary accounts whether Niphon was a Euchite or Hesychast at that time. Niphon lived the rest of his life as a hesychast, until his death in 1411. Niphon was also the author of the first biography of Maximos Kausokalybites, his spiritual tutor."

He authored several songs of great significance within the Cuban music. The first contact Noel Nincola had with music was in bosom of his family, because his father Isaac Nicola Romero was a guitar player and teacher, while his mother Eva Reyes was a violinist in the Orquesta Sinfónica Nacional (Cuba’s National Symphonic Orchestra) and a singer. Between the years 1954 and 1956, he studied under the guidance of Douane Voth (piccolo), and Martín Quiñones (singing lessons). In the late 1960s and early 1970s, he was a student of Leo Brouwer, Juan Elósegui, Federico Smith and Sergio Vitier, not in the traditional academic way but as part of a workshop that was known as the Grupo de Experimentación Sonora del ICAIC (a Group of Sound Experimentation that worked for the Cuban Institute of Cinematographic Art and Industry). Nicola died of cancer on August 7th, 2005, at the age of 58."

  "text" : "Nay Win Maung (Burmese: နေဝင်းမောင်; June 30, 1962 – January 1, 2012) was a Burmese physician, businessman and pro-democracy activist. Maung advocated a conciliatory approach toward Myanmar's ruling military junta, which seized power in 1988. Maung argued that Burma could be moved towards democratization by working directly with the country's generals, rather than confronting them. Maung sometimes took political positions which proved controversial among Burma's opposition leaders, who often viewed his ties to the military government with suspicion. He stated that Aung San Suu Kyi should accept a new constitution written by the military as a token of goodwill. He believed that Aung San Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy (NLD) should only contest half the parliamentary seats in the 2010 general election, arguing that a landslide win for the NLD would scare the Burmese rulers into holding onto power. However, Maung heavily criticized the generals for rigging the 2010 general election when the extent of voter fraud became known. (The NLD ultimately boycotted the election). Maung grew up in Maymyo (also called Pyin U Lwin), where his parents were history department faculty members at the Defence Services Academy. From the 7th to 10th standards, he was selected as a Luyaygyun (လူရည်ချွန်), a nationally recognized well-rounded student. Maung attended a regional college, where he majored in Biology, before he was admitted into medical school. He graduated from the Institute of Medicine 1 in Rangoon (now Yangon) with a medical degree in 1987, after repeating his 2nd year. Maung did not ally himself with the National League for Democracy or its leader, Aung San Suu Kyi. He died form alliances with other opposition figures, such as Zarganar. Maung met with Aung San Suu Kyi in January 2011, shortly after her release from house arrest. Maung left Burma for four months in 2004 to attend the Yale World Fellows Program at Yale University in the United States, focusing on public policy. In 2006, Nay founded Myanmar Egress, a civil society organizations with other intellectuals, which he hoped would thaw relations between the government and other pro-democracy activists. Nay hoped Myanmar Egress, which was headquartered in a hotel in Yangon, to evolve into a Western-style economic and political think tank. Under Nay, Myanmar Egress gave classes and seminars in business skills, economics, democracy, and entrepreneurship. In 2008, Egress the relief effort in the aftermath of Cyclone Nargis, earning accolades from international and foreign relief organizations. In March 2011, Burmese President Thein Sein called for reforms and good governance in his inauguration speech, leading to a series of reforms throughout 2011 and 2012. Maung, who had long advocated a conciliatory tone towards the generals, saw his ideas gain new prominence during the reform period and opposition leaders gradually warmed to his ideas. The vice president of the Union of Myanmar Federation of Chambers of Commerce and Industry, Maung Maung Lay, who represents business interests, told the Wall Street Journal, \"We thought that he was pro-government...{but} he seems to [have been] impartial\" as reforms accelerated and progressed in Burma. Maung died from heart attack on January 1, 2012, at the age of 49. He was survived by his wife Win Kalyar Swe, and four daughters. At his funeral, wreaths from both the ruling government's Minister of Industry and NLD leader Aung San Suu Kyi were placed next to each other. Tributes from fellow pro-democracy activists, who had previously criticized his relations with the government, appeared in Twitter and Facebook. Likewise, the government also praised his efforts. Ye Htut, a spokesperson for the Burmese Ministry of Information stated, \"Now we are at the beginning of the democratization process and losing him at this stage is a great loss...He foresaw that the new constitution would bring political space for democratization and urged all stakeholders to participate in the 2010 elections, but few people believed him and attacked him.\""

  "text" : "Neville Dilkes (born 28 August 1930) is an English conductor and organist. He was born in Derby, England to a musical family. He became a Fellow of Trinity College of Music, London, and later did his National Service in the Royal Army Medical Corps. He taught at Repton, and then in 1955 was named Director of Music at Corby Grammar School, where he mounted a school production of Gluck's opera Orfeo ed Euridice. This brought together a number of musicians from the Midlands, who formed the Kettering Symphony Orchestra under Dilkes' leadership. In 1961 he formed the Midland Sinfonia and also a chamber music performance group, Opera Da Camera. The Midland Sinfonia was administered from Dilkes' home for its first five years; it acquired a permanent office in Nottingham in 1966, and gave its first London concert in 1968. It was later renamed the English Sinfonia. In 1963 he joined the Netherlands Radio Union International Conductors' Course, where his principal tutor was Dean Dixon. He was the inaugural winner of the Watney-Sargent Award, chosen by Sir Malcolm Sargent himself. He is an associate conductor of the Philomusica of London.

Intelligence analysts estimated he was born in 1967 in Shajoie, Afghanistan. Norullah Noori was the Taliban's Governor of Balkh Province.2001 press reports describe General Rashid Dostum bringing Noori with him, when he toured the ruins the Qala-i-Jangi fortress, after over 400 captives died there in what is usually described as a failed prison uprising. Noori was reported to have ordered the Taliban fighters in his jurisdiction to peacefully surrender to Dostum's Northern Alliance forces. Norullah has been listed by the United Nations 1267 Committee since January 25, 2001. Norullah Noori arrived at Guantanamo on January 11, 2002, and has been held there for 15 years and 30 days.The allegations used to justify his detention in Guantanamo asserted he was an interim Provincial Governor—of Jalalabad [sic], temporary governor of Mazari Sharif [sic] and Governor of Balkh Province. Throughout the fall of 2011 and the winter of 2012 the United States conducted peace negotiations with the Taliban, and widely leaked was that a key sticking point was the ongoing detention of Norullah and four other senior Taliban.Negotiations hinged on a proposal to send the five men directly to Doha, Qatar, where they would be allowed to set up an official office for the Taliban."

Following his arrest, Abul stated that the most inflammatory tweets on his account had been posted by hackers, and that when he became aware of the tweets, he had deleted them with his iPhone. Abul has alleged that he was beaten and subjected to sleep deprivation in the first two days of his detention; according to his lawyer, Abul was also denied counsel for several hearings. One week after his arrest, Amnesty International named him a prisoner of conscience and called for his immediate release. Human Rights Watch also demanded that the charges against him be dropped, with a representative stating that \"Kuwait has sunk to a new low by arresting people just for posting criticism of governments on the internet.\" On 19 September, Kuwaiti MP Faisal Al-Duwaisan, Chairman of the Human Rights Committee, requested Abul's release, calling it \"a shame to taint Kuwait’s human rights history\". On 27 September 2011, Abul was released from Kuwait Central Prison."

  "text" : "Neil 'Smutty' Robinson. Born 29 July 1962 Cullybackey, Ballymena, County Antrim, Northern Ireland. Died 13 September 1986 (aged only 24 years) at Hull Royal Infirmary Hospital. An exceptionally talented (and fearless) motorcycle track, circuit and road racer from Ballymena, County Antrim, Northern Ireland, Robinson was killed during a practice session at Oliver's Mount racing circuit, Scarborough, West Yorkshire. Robinson and his family were of Scottish descent like most of Cullybackey's (protestant) residents. In 1983, Robinson won the British 250cc Championship. In 1986, only 4 weeks prior to his untimely death, he made his indelible mark at the Ulster Grand Prix Formula 1 Race, by achieving an outstanding win, with him placed first, well ahead of the rest of the field. His major achievement on that day was his emphatic victory over his friend Joey Dunlop, who at that time was the newly crowned World Formula 1 Champion. 1986 – Neil ‘Smutty’ Robinson caused a sensation with a commanding victory in the TT Formula 1 race, toppling the mighty Joey Dunlop to win by over one minute. Dunlop retained his world crown nonetheless and later added made amends with a record-breaking win in the TT Classic race, upping the outright lap record to 120.83 mph. Robinson retired with a blown engine. Neil \"Smutty\" Robinson was a close personal friend of Joey / Robert Dunlop of the Northern Ireland Dunlop road-racing dynasty of the late 1970s early 1980s. Neil \"Smutty\" Robinson was on the threshold of what promised to be a brilliant international career when he became the 13th rider to die on the Oliver's Mount circuit at Scarborough. The twenty-three-year-old was racing at the circuit for the first time and crashed in dense undergrowth and trees on the uphill Quarry Hills section on his sixth lap of practice. He suffered head injuries and a broken leg, and died in the evening in Hull Royal Infirmary in Scarborough after being conveyed there by the racing circuit ambulance escorted by two police motorcycle outriders. Speaking in an interview, prior to his own death in a helicopter accident in 2003, 11 time Isle of Man TT Winner and two time winner of the British Superbike Championship, Steve 'Hizzy' Hislop, said of Neil Robinson, \"Smutty, Neil Robinson...if he had not been killed at Scarborough, \"Smutty\" would have lifted the roads title away from Joey (Dunlop). Maybe not at the TT, but at the Ulster and the North West 200 for sure. He was mega\". Neil \"Smutty\" Robinson's name remains a very popular one among the Northern Ireland road racing / Isle of Man TT fraternity. His racing circuit exploits in such a short period remain unsurpassed. Tragically, Neil's older brother Donny Robinson was killed in a racing accident at the 1999 North West 200 at Coleraine. He crashed heavily at the Ballysally Roundabout during 125cc (wet) practice and died the next morning at Coleraine Hospital from multiple injuries. Forty-five-year-old Donny had retired from a glittering Grand Prix career in 1985 to concentrate on road racing. Like his younger brother Neil, he was a fearless road racer."

His Church of St Nicholas, Burnage has been called \"a milestone in the history of church architecture in England.\" After training at the Architectural Association, Cachemaille-Day set up practice with Felix Lander and Herbert Welch as \"Welch, Cachemaille-Day, and Lander\" in 1929. In 1935 Cachemaille-Day began an independent practice. Shortly afterwards he designed the Church of St Michael and All Angels, Northenden (1936–37), which well illustrates his absorption of \"Continental experiments.\" Pevsner described it as \"a sensational church for its country and its day.\" From the 1930s he became known for his churches, some of which are the most innovative ecclesiastical buildings of their time. He was one of the leading English architects to embrace the Liturgical Movement. Between 1931 and 1963 he designed at least 61 churches, many of which are now listed buildings. His churches include St Alban's Church, Southampton and the Church of St Nicholas, Burnage. The interior of St Barnabas, in Stroud Road, Gloucester, built at the foot of the Cotswolds in an estate south of the city, distills Gothic architecture into pure, simple gestures of interchanging arches within a huge hall church: the energy and dance of the Gothic is at the heart of this design, setting up a majestic yet lively space, its scale suggesting the ambition of a cathedral builder. St Edmund, Chingford, built in 1938, is Grade II listed."

  "text" : "Natalya Radina is a Belarusian journalist and the editor-in-chief of the independent news site Charter 97, which publishes many articles critical of President Aleksandr Lukashenko's rule. Following the disputed December 2010 presidential election—in which pro-democracy candidate Andrei Sannikov lost to Lukashenko, often called \"Europe's last dictator\"—a number of opposition protesters took to the streets, alleging fraud. Radina and the Charter 97 staff posted numerous articles documenting arrests and injuries to the protesters by state security forces. On 21 December 2010, the Charter 97 office was raided by agents of the State Security Committee of the Republic of Belarus (known in Russian as the \"KGB\"). Radina only had time to post \"We're all at the KGB\" on the site before being arrested and taken away. She was then indicted on charges of \"organizing mass disorder\", an offense carrying a possible fifteen-year jail sentence. Amnesty International named her a prisoner of conscience and demanded her release, as did the Committee to Protect Journalists. Radina was released on 31 January 2011 on the condition that she relocate from the capital of Minsk to her hometown of Kobrin. She was told not to leave Kobrin and to check in daily with police; in addition, her passport was confiscated, and she was forbidden to speak about her case. Unable to work, Radina fled from Belarus to Russia in March 2011. She spent four months in hiding in Moscow before receiving asylum from Lithuania, where she now lives. She continues to act as editor-in-chief of Charter 97. In November 2011, The Committee to Protect Journalists presented Radina its International Press Freedom Award, \"an annual recognition of courageous journalism\". In her acceptance speech, Radina blamed \"foreign indifference\" for the continued dictatorship of Lukashenko and called on foreign governments to remember that \"all of Belarus today is a big prison\"."

  "text" : "Nittert Fox, also known as Neithart Fuchs (killed at Foxhol 22 July 1499) was a Saxon knight and military commander. According to his hatchment, Fox came from an influential family from Franconia (Germany).As a military commander he became involved in the war between the Vetkopers and Schieringers in Friesland and Groningen.In 1495 he occupied Bolsward and the town of Workum had to pay money to stay safe. Later on Fox and his army sought shelter in Sneek. The Schieringers Bokke Harinxma and grietman Louw Donia tried to flee the city, but were imprisoned by Fox. Fox demanded ransom for these two men. The people of Sneek asked the city of Groningen to help out. Fox left the country in May 1496, after the ransom was paid. In 1498 Fox and his army raided the Westerkwartier in the province of Groningen.He was employed by the duke of Saxony, Albert III, who together with Edzard I struggled for power in the northern parts of the present Netherlands. This led to a battle at Noordhorn between Fox's army and the army of the city of Groningen. This battle was won by Fox's army, but Fox's army officer Jurjen van Reijnsberg was killed. To get revenge, Noordhorn and Zuidhorn were burnt. The Saxon army also occupied the monastery of Aduard.The chieftains of the Ommelanden negotiated with Fox to avoid further destruction and paid ransom. In July 1499 Fox clashed with the Groningers again. This time at the Vrouwenlaan (Women's Avenue) close to the village of Foxhol.According to tradition he got wounded, but continued to fight. He was eventually killed. In recognition of his qualities as a warrior, Fox's body was buried in the church of the Franciscan monastery in the city of Groningen by his opponents. His gravestone contained the following text: Hier leit den held - Wiens herte noyt besweek - Nog in het veld - Oyt voor zijn vijand week: - Die, als hij zag - Zijn Volk verslagen wert, - Vogt, daar hij lag, - Nog met een manlijk hert The hatchment that was hung at his grave disappeared during or before 1743, but the Latin text has been preserved.

  "text" : "Niketas Triphyllios (Greek: Νικήτας Τριφύλλιος, died 30 April 803) was one of the highest officials of the Byzantine Empire during the reign of Byzantine empress Irene of Athens (797–802), holding the position of Domestic of the Schools. Niketas first appears in Irene's unique triumphal procession on Easter Monday, 1 April 799. At the time, he was already Domestic of the Schools (commander of the elite Scholai regiment) and holder of the supreme dignity of patrikios. Niketas was one of the four patrikioi (along with Bardanes Tourkos, Constantine Boilas, and Niketas' brother Sisinnios) leading the four white horses which drew the imperial carriage, a role that marks him out as one of the most prominent of Irene's supporters among the high dignitaries of the state. A few weeks later, in May, Irene's health worsened considerably and the issue of her succession became opened. At this point Niketas (and possibly his brother too) allied himself with the eunuch Aetios to curb the influence of Irene's powerful eunuch chief minister, Staurakios. The two went before the empress and accused him of conspiring to seize the throne. Staurakios managed to escape with a rebuke from the empress, but took steps to gather armed support to counter Aetios' and Niketas' control of the army's senior officers. The two camps remained at a stalemate thereafter until February 800, when Staurakios was forbidden to have contacts with the military and Aetios was promoted to the powerful post of strategos of the Anatolic Theme. Despite the fact that Staurakios fell ill soon after, his supporters launched a rebellion on his behalf in Cappadocia. Staurakios however died on 3 June 800, before news of this reached the capital; the revolt was swiftly suppressed. Despite his earlier support of Irene, Triphyllios opposed the fiscal policies adopted by the empress over the next year, as well as the rising influence of Aetios, who replaced Niketas' brother Sisinnios as strategos of Thrace with his own brother Leo. He was thus among the leaders of her overthrow by the General Logothete, Nikephoros I, on 31 October 802. He remained in his post as Domestic of the Schools until his sudden death on 30 April 803. The Byzantine chroniclers reporting the rumour that he was poisoned on the orders of Nikephoros, but given Nikephoros' continued close relation with Sisinnios, this is unlikely."

  "text" : "Nikos Psacharopoulos (born Athens, January 18, 1928, died St. John, U.S. Virgin Islands, on January 12, 1989 ) was an American theater producer, director, and educator. Born Nickolas Konstantin Athanasios Psacharopoulos VII, he claimed to have organized his first theatrical troupe at age 15 under the Nazi occupation of his homeland. He moved to the United States in 1947 and attended Oberlin College where he directed productions for the Oberlin Mummers. He graduated in 1951 with a degree in art history. Three years later he received a Master of Fine Arts Degree in theater direction from the Yale Drama School. In 1955, he joined the faculty of Yale's undergraduate theater studies department and also taught in the graduate Drama School, where he remained until his death of colon cancer at age 60. Psacharopoulos was a co-founder of the Williamstown Theater Festival (WTF) in 1955, based in the Adams Memorial Theater on the campus of Williams College. Psacharopoulos went on to serve as WTF's sole artistic executive director for 33 years, creating a professional summer theater that was more than a typical summer stock escapist operation. He was aided for many years by Tom Brennan, who served as the WTF associate director. Under Psacharopoulos' leadership, WTF specialized in the plays of Anton Chekhov and Bertolt Brecht, as well as the work of many classic American playwrights such as Tennessee Williams, Thornton Wilder, Arthur Miller, and Archibald MacLeish. Psacharopoulos traveled often between his Greek homeland and New York City, his main residence, where he staged theater productions with the Circle-in-the-Square, the New York Pro Musica, and City Opera. Psacharopoulos' international reputation and demanding artistry drew many famous actors to perform with the WTF, names such as Frank Langella, Kate Burton, Rosemary Harris, Blythe Danner, and Colleen Dewhurst. To all—his \"stars\" and apprentices—he was a man of great style, a gourmet who would excuse himself from a table of friends  to confer with a restaurant's chef; he was something of a dandy  who, nevertheless, was always addressed simply as \"Nikos.\" Many directors and leaders of American theater were inspired by Nikos' guidance. Each year he would choose an assistant from his students at Yale to accompany him to WTF to experience their first seasons as professional directors. Peter H. Hunt, Austin Pendleton, Keith Fowler, and Arvin Brown are among those who first served with Nikos."

From 1971-1980, he was Dean of Medicine, and then Deputy Vice-Chancellor at the University of London. However his greatest contribution was to question current standards of prenatal care. He was critical of the way that midwives and obstetricians treated women and his work was summarized in a paper in the Lancet in 1960. This paper was based on interviews with 500 women, included no references and at the time was extremely controversial. In 2007, the Lancet included this paper in the '200 most important publications in the Lancet'."

He is currently a professor in the Department of Archaeology and Ancient History at Uppsala University, Sweden. Born in south-west London, Price went on to gain a BA in Archaeology at the University of London, before writing his first book, The Vikings in Brittany, which was published in 1989. He undertook his doctoral research from 1988 through to 1992 at the University of York, before moving to Sweden, where he completed his PhD at the University of Uppsala in 2002. In 2001, he edited an anthology entitled The Archaeology of Shamanism for Routledge, and the following year published and defended his doctoral thesis, The Viking Way. The Viking Way would be critically appraised as one of the most important studies of the Viking Age and pre-Christian religion by other archaeologists like Matthew Townend and Martin Carver."

He was the son of Christian Andresen and Cecilie Cathrine Asmussen. Andresen had studied under a merchant in Flensburg, before immigrated to Christiania (now Oslo) in 1801. He first entered as a partner with merchant G. F. Hagemann until 1809 when he established his own trading and shipping business. Subsequently Andresen also operated a factory which manufactured glazed tiles and cornice stones of baked clay. His interest in banking grew out of his trading company. Andresen also actively participated in public life. In 1818 he met in the Norwegian Parliament as an alternate. In 1821, he was selected as an alternate and in 1824 he met as permanent representative of Christiania. He was again an alternate to Parliament in 1833, 1836 and 1839. He was a member of the city council in Christiania 1837-43. For its public efforts he was named Knight of the Swedish Order of Vasa. Andresen and his wife Engel Johanne Christiane Reichborn (1790-1826) had eleven children. They were the parents of Nicolay August Andresen (1812-1894) who took over Andresens Bank and Johan Henrik Andresen (1815-1874) who took over the mercantile business."

He gave private piano lessons during this time and worked on research on folk music. Beginning in 1969 he taught at the University of Maine. Cazden composed an operetta, music for the stage, two symphonies, two chamber music concerts, a brass suite, a suite for oboe and strings, a reverb, a string quartet, other chamber works, sonatas and pieces for the piano.

  "text" : "Nils Henric Aschan Liljensparre, born Sivers (22 July 1738, Norrköping - 5 January 1814, Stockholm), was a Swedish police officer. He is most known for conducting the investigation of the regicide of king Gustav III of Sweden in 1792. Liljensparre studied law at Uppsala University and served in Svea hovrätt from 1762. He became an official at the royal council in 1765, secretary in 1772, and the head of the Stockholm police in 1776. Liljensparre is regarded as a devoted and effective police. He did, however, adjust himself to the demands of the crown even in cases when they bent the laws. This made him unpopular, but a favorite of the monarch, who ennobled him under the name Liljensparre in 1786. He organised a network of police agents in Stockholm. In 1792, he was in charge of the investigation of the regicide of King Gustav III of Sweden. He succeeded in identifying the culprit, but his investigation about the plots against the late monarch was not popular with the new regent, Duke Charles. In an attempt to ingratiate himself with the new regent, he is believed to have had rumors spread which contributed to the fall of Gustaf Mauritz Armfelt. In 1793, he was deposed from his position, due to his handling of the Ebel Riot, and send to Swedish Pomerania to organize the police force there. In 1799, he was given the responsibility of the Stockholm customs, where he was described as effective but despotic. He retired in 1811."

His uncle Henry I of Werle was killed in 1291 by his sons Henry II and Nicholas, because he had remarried and they felt this threatened their inheritance. After a prolonged war, Nicholas II defeated his cousins, who had formed an alliance with Lord Henry II of Mecklenburg and Elector Albert III of Brandenburg. This allowed him to reunite Werle-Parchim and Werle-Güstrow. In 1311, he travelled to Montpellier in southern France, where he hoped to be cured of leprosy at the famous school of medicine. He was not cured, but the progress of the disease was slowed down. He retired from government and lived the rest of his life at Pustow, near Güstrow. Nicholas II died in 1316. After his death, Werle was split again, with Nicholas' son John III taking Werle-Goldberg and Nicholas' younger brother John II taking Werle-Güstrow."

  "text" : "C. Ravichandran is the 4th (regular) director of The Indian Institute of Management Indore. He is an MSc in Maths from Annamalai University and holds a PhD from Indian Institute of Technology, Madras. He was earlier a professor at IIM Ahmedabad in the area of Operations Management and Quantitative Techniques. He started the five-year Integrated Management Programme at IIM Indore and increased the batch size of the flagship PGP programme from 240 to 450. He is also credited with rapid creation of world-class infrastructure at IIM Indore. In his tenure, infrastructure was not only envisioned but also implemented in record time. He has also introduced the PGP at RAK in UAE and PGP at Mumbai programmes. The idea behind the PGP at RAK is to meet the demand for skilled managers in the Gulf region. The motive to start PGP at Mumbai is to help IIM Indore connect with the Finance and the Consulting industries. On the burning issue of high EMIs and the restriction on graduates to be able to take risks, he believes that it was a real problem and that steps need to be taken to simplify this situation. He shares his point of view on placements and career opportunities and believes that IIM Indore will be at its peak by 2015. He also says that while he hopes that students at IIM Indore get the best possible career opportunities, the institution is in the business of imparting education and not in the business of being a placement agency. According to him, the best schools in the world do not have a placement process and Indian schools need to rethink the concept of a formal placement process. He has been a visiting faculty to many academic institutions in Europe and India. He was a public representative on the governing board of Bombay Stock Exchange up to April 2006. He is also a Director at Madhya Pradesh Power Transmission Company Limited and Madhya Pradesh Stock Exchange. He is a non executive director of Madhya Pradesh Paschim Kshetra Vidyut Vitaran Company Limited and independent director of Pithampur Auto Cluster Limited. He is also an Independent non-executive director at Gujarat State Petroleum Corp. Ltd. since 21 December 2009 His area of research includes: Information Technology Strategy, Competitiveness, Operations Management, Quantitative Methods, Applied Simulation and Stochastic Processes and their applications. His current research interests include stochastic models in management science and management information systems. He has authored more than 50 research papers in his area of research."

  "text" : "Professor Nelson Morgan is the former director of the International Computer Science Institute (ICSI), where he was also the Speech Group leader. He is also a professor in residence (emeritus) of electrical engineering and computer science at the University of California, Berkeley. Morgan was born in 1949 and received his PhD as an NSF fellow from UC Berkeley in 1980. He founded ICSI's Realization Group, which later become known as the Speech Group, in 1988. He served as director of ICSI from 1999 through 2011. He is the co-inventor of the Relative Spectral (RASTA) approach to speech signal processing, first described in a technical report published in 1991. In 1993, Morgan and Herve Bourlard published their work on the hybrid system approach to speech recognition, which uses neural networks probabilistically with Hidden Markov Models (HMMS). The system improved automatic speech recognition techniques based on HMMs by providing discriminative training, incorporating multiple input sources, and using a flexible architecture able to accommodate contextual inputs and feedbacks. The work has been described as \"seminal.\". Morgan won the 1996 IEEE Signal Processing Magazine Best Paper Award for a paper with Bourlard. Morgan was the principal investigator of the IARPA-funded project Outing Unfortunate Characteristics of HMMs, which sought to identify problems in automatic speech recognition technology. He has more than 200 publications, including three books., He is a fellow of the IEEE and the International Speech Communication Association. He is on the editorial board of Speech Communication Magazine, of which he is a former co-editor-in-chief."
