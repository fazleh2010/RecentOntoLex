Originally studying to be a graphic designer, Olaf switched to illustration and taught alongside the likes of Punk fashion legend, Vivienne Westwood. He quickly gained a following for his bold combinations of color, texture, and strong themes, and his success led to illustrating numerous advertising campaigns, art shows, clients, and awards.

Under the patronage of Ralph the Timid, Earl of Hereford, Osbern built the castle at Ewyas in Herefordshire, one of the first Motte and Bailey types to be constructed in England. On the return from exile in 1052 of Godwin, Earl of Wessex, the Normans were banished from England. Osbern obtained a safe passage from Leofric of Mercia and ventured north to join the court of Mac Bethad mac Findlaích, King of Scots. During Earl Siward's invasion of Scotland in 1054, Osbern Pentecost was one of the Normans killed at the Battle of Dunsinane, Siward's great defeat of the Scots."

His mother, Madam Felicia Esan Oyeleye, was a \"petty trader\" who hawked beans and pap. His early childhood was the foundation of his religious life and core values, where his parents through example developed his faith in God, \"respect for others, desire for service, and passion for excellence\".Teju Oyeleye attended Peter's Angliochan Primary School, the equivalent to Elementary School in North America. He later attended Ilesha Grammar School, where he graduated in 1942.He had several important role models growing up. His older brother, Daniel Babalola Oyeleye, got him his first job after high school at the Nigerian Post and Telegram, or P&T, organisation, where he worked for about 10 years. His older brother also encouraged him to follow his passion for science. While working at P&T, he developed a fascination for morse code and the science around how the telegraph key worked. Another mentor was the cousin of a good friend who was a teacher at Yaba Technical College. The cousin's explanation of how a telegraph key functioned and the relationship between electricity and magnetism was crucial in his selecting Electrical Engineering in college. A final role model for Teju was Mr. Joseph Onawumi, who encouraged him with his GCE Advanced level classes (the equivalent to AP classes) in Physics, Chemistry, and Mathematics and assisted him with his application to the University of London."

Flores was succeeded by Governor Francisco José Madero González following his August 1981 resignation. Flores founded the Association of Writers and Journalists Saltillo in 1950. Oscar Flores Tapia wrote a memoir about his childhood entitled \"La Casa de Mi Abuela\" (\"The House of My Grandmother\"). It is not clear if it was first published in 1959 or in 1978--perhaps it was first published in 1959 and then re-issued three decades later. In any event, it was treated in Saltillo as if were newly published in 1978. Probably the fact that Flores was the governor of the Mexican state of Coahuila in the late 1970s caused there to be a renewed interest in his memoir at that time."

Branstetter was killed in an airplane accident on November 17, 2011, when the Piper PA-28 Cherokee he and others were traveling in for a recruiting trip crashed in Perry County, Arkansas, about four miles south of Perryville.The Piper was extensively fragmented by impact forces and the passengers' bodies also badly mutilated. Although Branstetter's age was cited as a potential factor in the crash, his son Paul stated that he had recently passed an FAA-mandated physical exam and he did not notice any obvious sign of physical or mental impairment in Branstetter during the weeks prior to the accident. The mangled condition of Branstetter's remains made it difficult for medical examiners to determine if he had any preexisting conditions, although they found no trace of drugs or alcohol in his system. In the end, the exact reason for the crash could not be determined."

  "text" : "Opsites (Georgian: ოფსიტე) is the name twice mentioned by the 6th-century East Roman (Byzantine) historian Procopius in his De Bellis, while recounting the events related to the Lazic War (541–562) fought between the Eastern Roman and Sassanid Persian empires over the Caucasian state of Lazica. In one passage, Procopius remarks parenthetically that Opsites was an uncle of Gubazes II of Lazica and at one time king of the Lazi: \"[This Persian general]...captured Theodora, the consort of Opsites (he was uncle of Gobazes and king of the Lazi), finding her among the Apsilii, and carried her off to the land of the Persians. Now this woman happened to be a Roman by birth, for the kings of the Lazi from ancient times had been sending to Byzantium, and, with the consent of the emperor, arranging marriages with some of the senators and taking home their wives from there\" He was married to Theodora, of Roman senatorial descent. At the time of the Lazic revolt against Rome, Theodora, while living among the Apsilii, was captured, by chance, by the Persian commander Nabedes and carried off to Persia. Later in Procopius's work, Opsites appears as ruler of the eastern part of Abasgia, a land north of Lazica (the west was under Sceparnas). He was installed after the Abasgians rejected East Roman rule circa 550. Opsites led the Abasgians against the Romans under John Guzes and Uligagus, who defeated the rebels and captured their fort of Trachea. Opsites fled to the Sabir Huns of the Caucasus but his family members were all captured. Scholarly opinion is divided as to whether the Opsites of these two passages are the same person and whether Procopius's report of him being king of Lazica is true. If Opsites indeed ruled as king, this might have occurred before 541, when Gubazes II was king. Professor Cyril Toumanoff assumes that, in both cases, Procopius refers to the same person, a member of the Lazic royal family, who became an Abasgian leader. In the view of Toumanoff, this is highly probable given the fact that Lazica and Abasgia revolted together against the Roman hegemony and Abasgia had long been under Lazic suzerainty."

After being instructed in the first elements of the art by his father, he was sent to Amsterdam, where he became a scholar of Michiel van Musscher, a painter of small portraits and conversations, under whom he studied a short time, but being ambitious of distinguishing himself in a higher walk of art, and the works of Gerard de Lairesse being then in high reputation, he entered the school of that eminent master, whose instruction enabled him in a few years to dispense with further assistance. Elliger painted historical subjects in the style of De Lairesse, which were judiciously composed and correctly drawn. Like his instructor, he was particularly attentive to propriety of costume, and style of architecture. He was employed by the Elector of Mayence, for whom he painted the Death of Alexander, and the Marriage of Peleus and Thetis. His principal works are at Amsterdam, where he died in 1735. In the Vienna Gallery is a Woman with Fruit; in the Cassel Gallery are The Feast of Cleopatra, and The Daughter of Herodias dancing; and in the Bordeaux Museum is an Allegory, all of which are by him. His sons Anthony Elliger and Ottomar Elliger (III) also became painters."

He received his first violin, piano and guitar lessons and became a member of the Regensburg Cathedral Boys Choir, where he received vocal training, and completed his vocal studies at the Hochschule für Musik und Theater Hamburg. In 1967, he competed at the Ralf Arnie Musikverlag as a junior and came into a career as a singer under the name \"George\" in 1967 and 1968 with four single records. At the same time he sang with the German production of the musical Hair. Later, he renamed himself Oliver Bendt and had more success with cover versions of English hits, including What I did, I did for Maria, I'll come back to Amarillo, My Song for Mary and Oh, Marie. Towards the end of the 1970s, he lived for some time on the Caribbean island of Saint Lucia. Here he had the idea for the Goombay Dance Band, which brought him his greatest successes in 1979/1980. The greatest success in Germany was the song Sun of Jamaica. Internationally it was Seven Tears. This single sold 11 million copies, and was in the chart for 12 weeks in the UK and three weeks at number one. Bendt lives with his family in Norderstedt near Hamburg; he met his wife family in St. Lucia."

  "text" : "Olga Yakovlevna Virezoub (Russian: Ольга Яковлевна Вирезуб) (born 18 March 1975 in Grozny, Chechnya, USSR) is a Russian-German composer, music producer, pianist and musicologist. Olga Virezoub was born into a family of musicians. She grew up in the artistic and theatric atmosphere of theater musicians, and, yet being a child, she often traveled with her parents across the whole Soviet Union, several times acting in the guest performances of their theater in the children's roles. She then began to learn piano in the Samarian music college and, in parallel to this, took composition lessons in Samara. Starting from 1994, she travelled to St. Petersburg, where upon a recommendation of her aunt she then began to study piano and composition with the famous Russian composer and virtuoso pianist Georgy Firtich at the Herzen University of St. Petersburg from 1995 to 1997, who introduced her to his colleagues and friends, became her most important mentor, and influenced her to that time strongly as a composer. Equally, following her aunt´s advice, she then studied at the St. Petersburg Conservatory, where she obtained her basic education in composition and instrumentation with Vladimir Tsytovich from 1996 to 2000. The last years of studies at the conservatory finished she externally, as her family moved to Germany in 2000, but still with an excellent diploma in composition. She also attended numerous master classes in composition and piano during her studies, among others, with Nikolai Petrov and Paul-Heinz Dittrich. In parallel to her music studies, she took courses in French law and history at the \"Collège Universitaire Française\" of the University St. Petersburg. In 2001 - 2003 she completed the graduate program in composition and piano at the Hochschule für Musik und Theater Hannover. Also in 2003, she received a scholarship from OCNM to participate in the master classes and festival for contemporary and jazz music with Alvin Lucier, Tristan Murail, Christian Wolff, Frederic Rzewski, Roscoe Mitchell and others. A Wes residence in the world music program in Middletown, USA followed this experience, where she was an Alvin Lucier´s advisee in composition, and also worked with the American composer and pianist Neely Bruce, among others. Olga Virezoub is a winner of several prizes and scholarships, including the Künstlerhaus Cismar fellowship from the Ministry of Education and Culture Schleswig-Holstein in Grömitz, Germany in 2004, and was distinguished for her work in Europe, Asia and the USA, for instance, as the \"IMRadio featured artist\" in Chicago in 2010 and several times the NUMBER ONE music featured and top 1 artist in the genres of experimental and jazz music in New York in 2012. Her music has been performed and herself performed as a pianist in such events of contemporary and jazz music as the \"Musical Spring\" and \"Sound Ways\" (1999) in St. Petersburg, \"Cage Days\" (2001) in Hannover, \"Ostrava Days\" (2003) in Ostrava, \"Kieler Woche\" (2005) in Kiel, \"Donne Musica \"(2004) and \" Natale in Musica \"(2007) in Rome by musicians from such ensembles as the \"Sound Ways\", \"Das Neue Ensemble\", \"S.E.M. Ensemble\", \"OCNM Ensemble\", \"Anthony Braxton Ensemble\" as well as with such legendary composers and musicians as, for instance, Roscoe Mitchell and Thomas Buckner. Furthermore, as a composer and pianist, Olga Virezoub presented many new contemporary works by West European and American composers in Europe, and was the initiator of several projects of contemporary works in Germany. So, for instance, she was invited by the 'Verein Concertant e. V.' to give a piano recital with her own and works by European and American composers in 2008 in Hannover, after what she repeated and supplemented this project in 2009 in Göttingen. As a piano performer, she was engaged in over 30 first performances of her own as well as contemporary chamber music works by European and American composers as, for instance, \"Senzapatria Sempiterno\" by the German composer Anton Plate for the concert and award of the honorary doctor title onto Helmut Lachenmann in 2001 in Hannover.Beyond that, she also performed as a drummer of some regular and Gamelan instruments as well as a dancer of both the classical ballet and West African dance in Russia and the USA. In addition to it, Olga Virezoub is also author of several essays and works in the fields of music theory and history. Since 2012 Olga Virezoub´s music is available worldwide in the online music stores and obtained several chart positions. In 2000 her family immigrated to Germany, where she has been resided since that time in Hannover."

He gained his habilitation in 1867, and in 1871 became a professor of clinical medicine at the University of Dorpat. He died four years later at the age of 38. With Marceli Nencki (1847–1901) he performed physiological studies of urea, discovering that amino acids (glycine and leucine) are intermediate links between protein and urea., With Bernhard Naunyn (1839–1925) he conducted important research involving the behavior of benzene-derived hydrocarbons in the body."

  "text" : "Otto Mainzer (26 November 1903 in Frankfurt am Main – 28 June 1995 in New York City) was a German-American writer. He was unconventional, and wrote about issues such as free love. Mainzer was the son of Bertha Loeb. He graduated in Law in 1928 and received his doctorate in law. He then worked as a lawyer at the Berlin Court of Appeal. When he removed in 1933 because of his Jewish origin, he emigrated to Paris. There he made the acquaintance of André Gide, Heinrich Mann, Arnold Zweig and Erwin Piscator, who supported him financially. At the time of his Paris exile, Mainzer became acquainted with the writings of psychoanalyst Wilhelm Reich. Under the influence of Reich's ideas about sex-economy, Mainzer produced some major works on sexual coercion. In 1941 Mainz continued his emigration, and went to the USA. There he met his girlfriend Ilse Wunsch and lived for 25 years, \"unmarried, in two different apartments, but in an intimate love relationship\" until they married. After his death in 1995 his wife established the Otto-Mainzer-Preis in New York for the science of love, worth 5,000 U.S. dollars. The last prize was awarded in 2015."

Between 1967 and 1972 he won ten silver medals at major international competitions, including the 1968 and 1972 Summer Olympics. In eight of them he lost the final to Aleksandr Medved. He came close to winning at the 1971 World Championships in Sofia, where he led the match 4:3 with 43 seconds left. Yet Medved equalized the score and won the title because of his lower body weight. In 1989 Duraliev immigrated to Turkey, where he died aged 72."

His father was a supervisor for the Northern Norwegian routes of Bergenske Dampskibselskab and Nordenfjeldske Dampskibselskab, whereas his mother was the daughter of a merchant in Gibostad. Odd's father took over this business, and the family moved to Tromsø in 1914. Odd Berg finished his secondary education in 1926, took Kristiania Commerce School in 1927, the average adjuster exam in 1928 and the cand.oecon. degree at the Royal Frederick University in 1930. He then studied three years abroad. From 1933 to 1942 he worked as the manager of Tromsø Bunkerdepot. In 1937 he married Trinelise Hansen. In 1945 he registered his own company, eponymously named. Tromsø Bunkerdepot became a daughter company. Other daughter companies included Bergskip, Bulkskip, Berg Betong, Tromsø Fiskeindustri, Finnmark Bunkerdepot and Nordkapp Fiskeindustri. The first major vessel was contracted in 1954. The acquisition in 1965 of the tanker Arctic Propane built by Moss Verft was a turning point, as the company started concentrating on ships with diving gear. The vessel \"Arctic Surveyor\" (the first DP DSV with her first contract on the Ekofisk to Emden pipeline using hydro-coupling tie-ins progressing to Hyperbaric welding of piplenes ) and later the Arctic Seal was used for this purpose after the 1979–1980 Ixtoc I oil spill. Arctic Seal was also the first vessel to, in 1978, perform hyperbaric welding with dynamic positioning. Odd Berg also had consular missions for Spain, the Netherlands and Italy. He was an important person in Norwegian employers' associations; as a central board member of the Norwegian Employers' Confederation, board member of the Federation of Norwegian Industries and the Norwegian Shipbrokers' Association. He was also a board member of Tromsø Port Authority and chaired the supervisory council of Tromsø Forretningsbank. He was decorated as a Commander of the Order of Merit of the Italian Republic, a Knight of the Order of Orange-Nassau and of the Order of St. Olav. He died in 2005, aged 98."

In July 2007, Art Business News profiled and named him as one of “Today’s Top Artist\". Ibe was born not long after the end of the Nigerian civil war and grew up in a developing democracy that was abruptly terminated. Violence became the order of the day. As a youth, Ibe realized that his artists’ sensibilities could move him in either of two directions—either to fight back at such dehumanizing situations, or to escape inward by searching for elements that reflect humanity. He chose the latter."

Otto V spent many years in Prague, at the court of his maternal uncle King Ottokar II of Bohemia. When Ottokar died in battle in 1278, Otto V became the regent for Ottokar's son and heir Wenceslaus II, who was only seven years old when his father died. As regent, Otto V had to deal with the machinations of Ottokar's widow Kunigunda of Slavonia and with factions of powerful noblemen. Bohemian chroniclers describe Otto's persistent rigour and that Wenceslaus was forced to give up his claims on Upper Lusatia before he could start reigning himself. When Wenceslaus had taken over, he and Otto V were still on good terms, and Wenceslaus took measures against the strong influence of the group around his mother. Otto V also persistently defended his claims on Pomerania against Polish counter-claims."

He was a professor of conducting at the Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia, as well as at the Juilliard School in New York City. Mueller was born in Bensheim, Germany. At the age of 13, he was selected to attend the Musisches Gymnasium Frankfurt am Main, where he was a student throughout the war. Following the war, he became director of the chamber music department at Radio Stuttgart at age 19, and was on the staff of the Heidelberg Theatre. He also founded and conducted an orchestra for families of US military personnel stationed in Germany. He emigrated to Canada in 1951 and worked as pianist, composer, arranger, and conductor for the Canadian Broadcasting Corp., and soon began teaching at the Montreal Conservatory. His first professional work in Canada was as a composer for the Canadian Broadcasting Company, writing music for daytime soap operas. Among his appointments were at the Juilliard School of Music in New York, the Yale School of Music in New Haven, Connecticut, the University of Wisconsin-Madison and the Victoria School of Music in British Columbia. At Yale, he was director of the Yale Philharmonia from 1973 to 1987. He began teaching on the faculty of the Curtis Institute in the fall of 1986, and made his public conducting debut in Philadelphia in April 1987. He served on the Curtis faculty until his retirement in 2013. Some of his notable students include conductors Alan Gilbert, Alasdair Neale, Robert Hart Baker, Gary Fagin, David Hayes, Sarah Ioannides, Paavo Järvi, Jere Lance, Jahja Ling, André Raphel, Kaye George Roberts, Richard Rosenberg, Ignat Solzhenitsyn and Ransom Wilson. He was also an opera repertory coach for mezzo-soprano Huguette Tourangeau and soprano Colette Boky. Mueller died in Charlotte, North Carolina, on 25 February 2016 at the age of 89. His 56-year marriage to his wife Marga (Margarethe Burchart Mueller) produced three sons, Bernie, Michael, and Peter. His sons survive him, as do his second wife, Virginia Allen, his grandchildren Christina, Peter, and Sophie, and his brother, nephew, and niece."

She moved with her parents to Mobile, Alabama in 1835, where she married Dr. Henry Strachey Le Vert in 1836. She became one of the first female southern writers to achieve national recognition. Although largely faded from history today, she was a well-known figure during her own time. From the 1830s through the 1850s she was noted for hosting gatherings of prominent politicians, noted literary figures, and professionals of all types. She was friends with a variety of prominent 19th century figures. During her travels to Europe she was presented at the courts of several countries. She also received an audience with the Pope during her time there. Following her last European tour and return to the United States, she took on a role in the successful national campaign to purchase and restore Mount Vernon, the home of George Washington. Following the American Civil War, with her husband dead and much of her fortune gone, she returned to her birthplace of Georgia and embarked on an ultimately unsuccessful lecture tour. She was posthumously inducted into the Alabama Women's Hall of Fame in 1990."

  "text" : "Oswald Rothaug (17 May 1897, in Mittelsinn – 4 December 1967, in Köln) was a Nazi jurist. In June 1933 Rothaug was named a prosecutor in Nuremberg, and in April 1937 he became the regional court director in Schweinfurt and director of Nazi \"special courts\" or \"Sondergerichts\" at Nuremberg. In 1938 he became a member of the German Nazi Party, though he had applied the year previously. He worked closely with the Sicherheitsdienst or intelligence apparatus of the Nazi SS. In 1942 he sentenced a 25-year-old Polish slave-laborer to death, explaining that \"the inferiority of the defendant is clear as he is a part of Polish subhumanity.\" Rothaug sought after and presided over the trial of Leo Katzenberger in March 1942, ordering his execution for \"racial defilement\" in May 1943. Rothaug accused the elderly Jewish man of having sexual relations with a younger German woman, Irene Seiler, which was a crime in Nazi Germany according to the Rassenschande or \"racial purity\" laws, a part of the Nuremberg Laws. Both Katzenberger and Seiler denied the accusations. Following the trial, Rothaug was brought to Berlin as a member of the Nazi People's Court. During the Nuremberg Trials Rothaug was sentenced to life imprisonment on 14 December 1947 for crimes against humanity. He was the only defendant not to be convicted of all charges, being found guilty only of \"crimes against humanity,\" and not guilty of \"war crimes through the abuse of the judicial and penal process\" and \"membership in a criminal organization.\" Nonetheless, the court commented in its judgment that: \"By his manner and methods he made his court an instrumentality of terror and won the fear and hatred of the population. From the evidence of his closest associates as well as his victims, we find that Oswald Rothaug represented in Germany the personification of the secret Nazi intrigue and cruelty. He was and is a sadistic and evil man. Under any civilized judicial system he could have been impeached and removed from office or convicted of malfeasance in office on account of the scheming malevolence with which he administered injustice.\" His sentence was later reduced to 20 years, and he was released on parole on 22 December 1956. Rothaug's role in the Katzenburger trial was inspiration for the plot surrounding fictional character Ernst Janning in the 1961 film Judgment at Nuremberg."

  "text" : "Oleg Brega (born October 26, 1973) is a journalist, activist and filmmaker from Chişinău, the Republic of Moldova. He has been the president of the Moldovan public activism group Hyde Park since 2003. Oleg Brega hosts the show \"Inamicul Public\" (The public enemy), on Jurnal TV. Oleg Brega worked for TeleRadio-Moldova (September 1, 1992 – September 15, 1995). He graduated from the Music, Theater and Fine Arts Academy, Chişinău (1996) and the Academy for Theater and Film in Bucharest (1999). In 2001, Brega began to host a nightly radio show called Hyde Park on Antena C; the Moldovan Ministry of the Interior soon intervened, and the program was shut down. On March 10, 2008, Oleg Brega was assaulted by the Prime Minister's bodyguards in the hallway of the Moldova National Opera Ballet which hosted a meeting of Prime Minister Zinaida Greceanîi. In May 2008, Oleg Brega was arrested for peacefully protesting in front of the National Palace where a celebration was held to mark the 50th anniversary of the foundation of Moldova 1. The Buiucani District Court ruled that his placard, which bore the inscription \"50 Years of Lies\", constituted \"injury\" and sentenced him to three days' detention. His group Hyde Park, founded in 2003 after his radio show of the same name was shut down, helped organise 2009 Moldova civil unrest. On April 9, 2009, Amnesty International wrote that \"Oleg Brega, Ghenadie Brega and Natalia Morari are currently in hiding for fear of being arrested.\""

Following Christian Wulff's election as Prime Minister of Lower Saxony, he was appointed government spokesman in 2003, and was raised to become State Secretary in 2008. Glaeseker was credited with a successful public relations campaign for Wulff. Following Wulff's election as President of Germany in 2010, Glaeseker became the presidential press secretary. In December 2011, Wulff came under criticism, and so did Glaeseker. He was criticized by David McAllister, Wulff's successor as Prime Minister of Lower Saxony. On 22 December, he tendered his resignation."

  "text" : "Olly Blackburn (also credited as Oliver Blackburn and Ollie Blackburn) is a film director and screenwriter. Born in London, England, Blackburn had an acting role in the 1982 short comedy film A Shocking Accident; the film won an Academy Award in 1983 for Best Short Subject. He graduated from Oxford University in 1993 where he studied history. Blackburn won a Fulbright Scholarship and pursued graduate studies in film and television at the Tisch School of the Arts. While there, his film Swallowed received New York University's Martin Scorsese Post-Production Award. Blackburn began his professional film career directing commercials and music videos, and became associated with the film production company Warp X. He served as Second Unit Director on the film Reverb. Blackburn co-wrote and directed Donkey Punch, which was his first film to be shown at the Sundance Film Festival. He shot the film on a £1 million budget over 24 days in South Africa. Movie critics likened his work on the film to filmmaker Peter Berg's Very Bad Things, director Phillip Noyce's Dead Calm, and Roman Polanski's Knife in the Water. He went on to serve as writer for the film Vinyan, which critics compared to two films by director Nicolas Roeg, Don't Look Now and Heart of Darkness."
