  "text" : "Paulita Sedgwick (7 December 1943 – 18 December 2009) was an artist, actress, and independent filmmaker best known for her performances on stage and roles in several films by Ismail Merchant and James Ivory. Paulita Sedgwick was born on 7 December 1943 in Washington, DC, the third of five children of Samuel Cabot Sedgwick and Paula Knipe Sedgwick. The Sedgwick family were well established in Massachusetts, and she was descended from Robert Sedgwick, the first Major General of the Massachusetts Bay Colony under Oliver Cromwell, William Ellery, who was a signatory of the United States Declaration of Independence, Judge Theodore Sedgwick, famously the first person to successfully plead for the freedom of a female slave (Elizabeth Freeman, also known as Mum Bett), and was related to Catharine Sedgwick, the novelist. She was also a cousin of the actresses Edie Sedgwick and Kyra Sedgwick, and her uncle Ellery Sedgwick was the editor and then owner of The Atlantic magazine. Sedgwick's father served as a diplomat with the US State Department, and her early years were spent in Haiti, Spain, France, Colombia, Costa Rica, Japan, and the United States. During this time she learned to speak fluent Spanish and began a lifelong interest in travel and foreign cultures. In her teenage years she studied Islamic Art at the University of Madrid in Spain, where she lived with the family of the anti-Francist Dionisio Ridruejo, reportedly drawing the attention of the authorities (although this is not substantiated). Later she attended the Webber Douglas School of Singing and Dramatic Art in London, England, lodging with the family of Colonel Sir Piers Bengough. Her interest in Islamic and other ancient arts was part of a greater fascination with antiquity and mythology, which Sedgwick used as inspiration for her own art. She wrote and illustrated two books which saw commercial success in the US during the 1970s, Circus ABC and Mythological Creatures, and also illustrated two more: the A to Z of Egyptian Mythology by Barbara Pradel Price and The Pluperfect of Love by Dorothy Crayder. In the early 1970s Sedgwick moved to New York City, where she became a member of a fringe theatre group called the Hot Peaches and performed in numerous stage productions. During this time she became a lifelong friend of Isabelle Collin Dufresne (better known as Ultra Violet), and through Dufresne and her cousin Edie Sedgwick got to know Andy Warhol, although she never became a follower of The Factory. While in New York she dated Jimmy Hall, another stage actor, and in 1974 they had a son, Angel Sedgwick, who was to be her only child. During the mid 70s, Sedgwick and her son moved to Europe, where she spent a year travelling and performing street theatre. In 1977, they moved to Paris, where she learned French and began acting in films as well as stage productions, including supporting roles in Savages (1971), Quartet (1981), Les Uns et Les Autres (1981) and The Bunker (1981). Throughout most of her adult life Sedgwick lived on the family's Santa Fe Ranch near Nogales, Arizona, but travelled extensively throughout South and Central America, Europe, the former Soviet Union, North Africa and South-East Asia. From the early 80s onwards she was an increasingly regular visitor to London, England, and became a doyenne of London's alternative scene whilst also becoming a member of such diverse institutions as the Royal Geographical Society, the Royal Horticultural Society, The Chelsea Arts Club, the National Liberal Club, the Soho social club Black's, and gay nightclubs such as Heaven and Madame Jojo's. She founded and edited a short-lived underground culture magazine called U-Topic, and her friends and acquaintances during this period included the fashion designers Vivienne Westwood, Pam Hogg and Alexander McQueen. Inspired by the places she visited during her travels, the people she met there and local folklore, Sedgwick wrote, produced and directed a number of her own films under the company name Poker Productions, sometimes using the nom-de-plume Damian Wong. These included the short films Le Gymnase De La Rue D'Enfer (1984, in French), The Cowboy and the Chinagirl (1987), Valentin (1989, in Spanish), and The Yellow Motel (1991). In 1992 she wrote, produced and directed the feature film Blackout, which featured a soundtrack by the then unknown British dance music artist Jake Williams. Several of these films featured luminaries from the 1970s New York theatre and art scene such as Ultra Violet, and proponents of the London alternative scene including Eddie Tudor-Pole, the artist Duggie Fields and the jewellery designer Andrew Logan. Despite obtaining varying degrees of underground popularity none of these films met with any commercial success. In 1995 she made a set of four three-minute films for the British TV company Channel 4 called On The Loose, Fit To Be Tied (starring fashion designer Alexander McQueen), Double Take and The Assistant (starring the TV presenter Graham Norton), however these films were never shown on British television. From the early 1990s she began to spend more and more time on her family's ranch in Arizona, where she became a member of the board on the Santa Fe Ranch Foundation, the Sedgwick family's non-profit trust, assisting with the delivery of educational programmes for local school children. After a protracted battle with several cancers she died on the Santa Fe Ranch on 18 December 2009."

While owner of Portsmouth, Dawson was involved in a dispute with the Boston Red Sox over future Hall of Fame third baseman Pie Traynor. Red Sox owner Ed Barrow convinced Traynor to join Portsmouth, saying that if the third baseman performed well there, he would join the Red Sox, as the Boston team and Portsmouth had a gentleman's agreement, wherein Portsmouth served as something of a farm team for the Red Sox. However, the Truckers were still an independent team and, despite the informal agreement, were able to do anything they wished with Traynor, including selling him to another team. In September 1920, they sold him to the Pittsburgh Pirates, infuriating Burrow. \"I hit the ceiling. I grabbed the phone and called Dawson and called him everything I could think of\", Burrow said. Washington Senators owner Clark Griffith, too, was unhappy, claiming he thought his team would gain access to Traynor."

  "text" : "Pauline Byrns (1917 – September 18, 1990) was an American singer who recorded successfully in the swing era of the late 1930s and 1940s, notably with Artie Shaw and the vocal groups Six Hits and a Miss and The Starlighters. She was often credited as Pauline Byrne or Pauline Byrnes. Singer Mel Tormé said of her: \"Oh, what a singer.... I admired her so much\". She was born in Missouri. At the age of 17 she won a talent contest in Washington, and began singing and touring with big bands. In 1937 she moved to California and joined the singing group Three Hits and a Miss to replace Martha Tilton. As the group changed personnel, so its name changed, later recording as Six Hits and a Miss; the group's other members included Vince Degen, her husband Jerry Preshaw, Howard Hudson - later her second husband - and Tony Paris. In 1938, Byrne was described by the magazine Records and Recording as \"one of the finest vocalists to grace a bit of waxed jazz in some years. Her voice is a rich contralto, best in the lower register...\" The group recorded with Bing Crosby, appeared in several movies in the early 1940s, including the Marx Brothers film The Big Store, and performed regularly on the Bob Hope Show on radio. The version of Cole Porter's \"You'd Be So Nice to Come Home To\" by Six Hits and a Miss made no. 11 on the US charts in 1943. She also recorded \"Lullaby of Broadway\" as a featured vocalist with the David Rose Orchestra, and in 1940 recorded \"Gloomy Sunday\" and \"Don't Fall Asleep\" with the Artie Shaw Orchestra. She formed another vocal group, The Starlighters, with Hudson, Degen and Paris, in 1946; an early member of the group was Andy Williams. The Starlighters (unconnected to other groups of that name) recorded successfully for several labels in the late 1940s and early 1950s, including some records with Jo Stafford. However, Byrns left the group in 1947, after giving birth to her first child. Thereafter she retired from the music business. In later years she lived in Encino and then Tarzana with her husband, Howard G. Hudson. She died of cancer in Sherman Oaks, Los Angeles at the age of 73."

Born in Goincourt (Meurthe et Moselle) in 1842, he apprenticed locally, and was influenced by the late Dominique Peccatte school (in his early period).Prosper Colas's work is similar to that of François Bazin, Charles Claude Husson, and Pierre Cuniot.Around 1871, he came to Paris where he likely met Jean-Baptiste Vuillaume and worked for him. The first bows bearing his brand can be dated to this period and reflect Vuillaume's influence (with the \"Vuillaume style frogs\").Prosper Colas worked for a varied number of makers and produced a huge quantity of bows. His best production was from the turn of the century (early 20th century).His lower tier production is stamped “P.C.”.One can also find instruments bearing Prosper Colas's label as he sold mail order instruments made by the primary Mirecourt workshops of his time: Jérôme Thibouville-Lamy and Marc Laberte. \"Prosper Colas died in 1919, at which point his business was taken over by Ferret-Marcotte\"."

On March 30, 2011, he received a letter from the President of the Nigeria Football Federation commending his efforts to combat violence in football through his 1 GAME initiative.It is believed that the 1 GAME initiative which he founded has recorded more than 100,000 sign ups on its website including endorsements from celebrities such as Jamaica’s reggae musician Shaggy, Hip-hop duo P-Square, former Nigeria senior national football team coach Samson Siasia, Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) President Aminu Maigari and some members of NFF Executive Committee. In April 2011, Obaji denied a report by an online portal that he was involved in a major disagreement with NFF President Aminu Maigari over media publications made by 1 GAME by saying: “There has never been a time I have had to disagree with him or anyone from the NFF.”Obaji told the Nigerian media in August 2011 that he would quit the board of the Cross River State Football Association if it continues to fail in its promises to the people that elected it."

He married Lady Grace Manners, daughter of John Manners, 8th Earl of Rutland and Hon. Frances Montagu, before 1666. They had a daughter: \n* Hon. Juliana Chaworth (1655–1692) married Chambre Brabazon, 5th Earl of Meath. During the English Civil War, the family home Wiverton Hall was made uninhabitable by Parliamentary forces. Annesley Park became the new family seat. The marriage was not a happy one and eventually Grace left her husband to live in London. Patrick rebuilt parts of Annesley Hall, constructed the terrace and the flight of steps to the church. His Achievement of Arms was placed on one of the tower walls in the church. This was moved in 1874 to the new church, All Saints' Church, Annesley although it had been badly damaged by vandals. He succeeded to the titles of 3rd Viscount Chaworth of Armagh and 3rd Baron Chaworth of Tryme on the death of his father in June 1644. He died in June 1693. He was buried at Annesley, Nottinghamshire. His will dated 30 April 1693 received probate on 24 April 1694 at York. Without male issue, on his death his titles became extinct."

In 1939 she toured with the Abbey Theatre and appeared in a production by Irish playwright Teresa Deevy called The King of Spain's Daughter, there were 16 performances in all from September to November. Wanting to get into theatre management, she launched Orion Productions in 1956. In 1958 came Gemini Productions, based for many years in Dublin's Eblana Theatre in the Busarus. A tiny theatre, famously without wings, it was open from 17 September 1959 until 1995. Ryan was in the 1960s and 1970s the major producer of new plays in Ireland outside of the Abbey Theatre. Phyllis Ryan and her Gemini Productions kept independent theatre alive in Dublin and premièred most of the work of playwright John B. Keane. The playwrights – Brian Friel, Joe O'Donnell, Tom Murphy and others – that Gemini nurtured were later adopted by the Abbey and other theatres. She wrote and published her memoirs, The Company I Kept, in 1996."

He was the youngest son of Prince Henry Borwin II, Lord of Mecklenburg of Mecklenburg. When his father died, Pribislaw and his three brothers divided Mecklenburg; Pribislaw received the Lordship of Parchim-Richberg. As he was still a minor, his brother John I acted as his guardian and regent until 1238, and he was raised at John I's court. He came of age in 1238 and moved into Parchim Castle. His Lordship included the dominions of Parchim (including Brenz and Rosengarten) and Ture, the bailiwicks of Plau, Goldberg, Sternberg and Richenberg (near Langen Brütz on the river Warnow). He soon came into a border dispute with the Count of Schwerin, who forced him to hand over Brenz and Neustadt-Glewe. After this feud, he managed to stabilize the economy of his territory by founding the cities of Goldberg and Sternberg and stimulating Jews to settle in Parchim. In 1248, he granted city rights to Goldberg and Sternberg. In 1240, he founded Parchimer Neustadt on the west bank of the Elde. In 1246, he brought members of the Franciscan Order into Parchim. In 1248, he moved his residence to the newly constructed Richenberg Castle, on the Warnow near the village of Kritzow. Probislaw twice came into a dispute with Bishop Rudolph I of Schwerin, once about the payment of tithes and once when Rudolph constructed a castle too close to the border, in Bützow. Pribislaw felt threatened by the caste. He burned it down and took Rudolph prisoner and locked him up in the dungeon of Richenberg Castle. He demanded a modest ransom, which the bishopric soon paid. Rudolph was released and then tried every means to overthrow Pribislaw. Pribislaw was outlawed and excommunicated. In 1255, Pribislaw was taken prisoner and handed over to Rudolph. His was removed from power and his territory was divided among his brothers and his brother-in-law, the Count of Schwerin. Pribislaw went into exile in Pomerania, where he received the Lordship of Białogard as compensation. When Rudolph died in 1262, Pribislaw hoped that he would be reinstated, but his brothers refused this. In 1270, Pribislaw renounced his claims to Parchim-Richenberg and returned to Białogard, where he died after 12 February 1275"

  "text" : "Peter Del Tredici is an American botanist and author. He is a senior research scientist at Arnold Arboretum and a lecturer at the Harvard Graduate School of Design. He was appointed curator of the Larz Anderson Bonsai Collection in 1982 and was editor of the journal Arnoldia from 1989 to 1992. Del Tredici, a native Californian, earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in Zoology from University of California, Berkeley in 1968 and a Master of Arts in Biology from the University of Oregon in 1969, after which he moved to Boston where he established his career and earned his doctorate in Biology from Boston University in 1991. His thesis adviser was Richard Primack and his thesis topic was \"The Evolution and Natural History of Ginkgo biloba L.\". Research on this project extended over a three year period and involved travel to eastern China (fall of 1989) and to South Carolina. I consider 'weed' to be a politically incorrect term. There is no biological definition of the term weed. It’s really a value judgment. Peter Del Tredici Del Tredici is an advocate of a \"radically practical\" approach to urban plant life, holding that what some people see as a collection of undesirable plants should be viewed as a valuable ecosystem unique to the hostile habitat of the city, and he prefers the term \"spontaneous\" over \"invasive\" in describing these flora. Del Tredici is the author of Wild Urban Plants of the Northeast: A Field Guide, which catalogs and describes the many species of urban wildflowers, weeds, and other plants that flourish without human support, and in which he makes the case that they can be beneficial to the quality of urban life. Del Tredici also studied the ginkgo (Ginkgo biloba) for decades. He was part of an 1989 expedition that found wild ginkgos in Tian Mu Shan Reserve, a notable find since this species had been long believed extinct in the wild. He demonstrated that gingkgo basal lignotubers develop from suppressed cotyledonary (embryonic leaf) buds – a resprouting mechanism activated under stress that, according to Del Tredici, helps explain the gingkgo's long survival as a species. He helped develop supporting evidence for the theory that the ginkgo's characteristic vile–smelling fruits are a mechanism to attract ingestion by carnivores, aiding the tree's propagation via scat, and developed experiments confirming that all aspects of the ginkgo’s sexual reproductive cycle are strongly influenced by temperature. Del Tredici also consulted for a French subsidiary of Schwabe Pharmaceutical which markets gingko–leaf extract as a memory aid. While Del Tredici applied his expertise on the botanical side of the operation, he's skeptical that the products are effective, and notes that rather than deriving from ancient Chinese medical wisdom, the idea of gingko as an effective health agent \"began in a board room in Germany in the mid–1960s\" and has resulted in \"a big cash cow\". In 2013, Del Tredici was awarded a Veitch Memorial Medal, given by the Royal Horticultural Society for outstanding contribution to the advancement of the science, art, or practice of horticulture."

  "text" : "Pamulaparti Venkata Narasimha Rao (popularly known as P.V.) (28 June 1921 – 23 December 2004) was an Indian lawyer and politician who served as the Prime Minister of India (1991–1996). His ascendancy to the prime ministership was politically significant in that he was the first holder of this office from non-Hindi-speaking south India. He led an important administration, overseeing a major economic transformation and several home incidents affecting national security of India. Rao, who held the Industries portfolio, was personally responsible for the dismantling of the Licence Raj, as this came under the purview of the Ministry of Commerce and Industry. He is often referred to as the \"Father of Indian Economic Reforms\". Future prime ministers Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Manmohan Singh continued the economic reform policies pioneered by Rao's government. Rao accelerated the dismantling of the License Raj, reversing the socialist policies of Rajiv Gandhi's government. He employed Dr. Manmohan Singh as his Finance Minister to embark on historic economic transition. With Rao's mandate, Dr. Manmohan Singh launched India's globalisation angle of the reforms that implemented the International Monetary Fund (IMF) policies to rescue the almost bankrupt nation from economic collapse. Rao was also referred to as Chanakya for his ability to steer tough economic and political legislation through the parliament at a time when he headed a minority government. According to Natwar Singh, \"Unlike Nehru, his knowledge of Sanskrit was profound. Nehru had a temper, PV a temperament. His roots were deep in the spiritual and religious soil of India. He did not need to \"Discover India\". 11th President of India APJ Abdul Kalam described Rao as a \"patriotic statesman who believed that the nation is bigger than the political system\". Kalam acknowledged that Rao in fact asked him to get ready for nuclear tests in 1996 but they were not carried out as government at center got changed due to 1996 general election. The tests were later conducted by Vajpayee-led NDA government. In fact Rao briefed Vajpayee on nuclear plans. Rao's term as Prime Minister was an eventful one in India's history. Besides marking a paradigm shift from the industrialising, mixed economic model of Jawaharlal Nehru to a market driven one, his years as Prime Minister also saw the emergence of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), a major right-wing party, as an alternative to the Indian National Congress which had been governing India for most of its post-independence history. Rao's term also saw the destruction of the Babri Mosque in Ayodhya in Uttar Pradesh when BJP's Kalyan Singh was CM which triggered one of the worst Hindu-Muslim riots in the country since its independence. Rao died in 2004 of a heart attack in New Delhi. He was cremated in Hyderabad. He was a versatile personality with interests in a variety of subjects (other than politics) such as literature and computer software (including computer programming). He spoke 17 languages."

  "text" : "Pedro Goyena (July 24, 1843, Buenos Aires – May 17, 1892) was an Argentine jurist, politician and writer. Pedro Goyena, along with other thinkers and politicians, followers of the Catholic Thinking, as José Manuel Estrada and Emilio Lamarca. He completed his studies at the Colegio Nacional Central, then to the University to get a Law Degree. He made a mark in Argentine politics with his strong opposition to Laïcité, which characterized the Generation of '80 that governed the country in the second half of the 19th century and the beginnings of the 20th. He served a term as a Provincial Representative for Buenos Aires. He had a strong impact in the Pedagogical Congress of 1882 where he maintained the position that public education had to be Catholic having a strong argument with Leandro Alem. He opposed Public Education Law #1420 of 1884, that established schooling for children being free, secular, and mandatory. He also opposed and represented the position of the Catholic thinkers against the Law of Civil matrimony of 1888, maintaining that the only type of marriage allowed should be the one performed and recognized by the Catholic Church. He was noted as a good orator. Goyena taught Roman law at the Universidad de Buenos Aires and also worked as a journalist, writing among others for Revista Argentina and La Unión, which he also edited with Estrada and Tristán Achával Rodríguez, where he defended his opposition to the liberal reforms of the government of the time, whose principal exponent was President Julio A. Roca. In 1885 he was appointed First Vice president of the Catholic Union, presided by José Manuel Estrada. Shortly before his death, and carried by his opposition to secular liberalism, he joined the heterogeneous opposition represented by the Unión Cívica. A street in the barrio of Caballito in Buenos Aires is named after him."

  "text" : "Peter Paul Brauer (born May 16, 1899 in Elberfeld, died April 28, 1959 in Berlin) was a German film producer and film director. In 1928, he became involved in film production in the Netherlands. That same year he returned to Germany and, over several years, produced several short films. After the takeover of the Nazis in March 1933, Brauer was production manager at the UFA. After 1938, he directed a number of feature films, mostly comedies. Between April 1939 and November 1940 Brauer was production chief of Terra Film. At the beginning of 1940, Brauer was assigned by Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels to produce the anti-Semitic film Jud Süß (1940). Brauer assigned himself the task of directing the film; however, he ran into difficulties in casting. Frustrated at the delay, Goebbels removed him in favor of Veit Harlan. In the 1940s, Brauer concentrated on directing and collaborated on some screenplays. Brauer was a member of the Nazi Party."

  "text" : "Peter Bowling (1864 – 22 February 1942) was an Australian coal miner and trade unionist. Bowling was born in Dunfermline, Fife, Scotland to miner Patrick Bowling and Marguerite MacGuire. He started working in the mines at the age of twelve and migrated to New South Wales when he was 20, working around Newcastle. He married Mary Ann Madden at Branxton on 5 September 1889. He worked in Gippsland in the 1890s, where he was involved in founding a miners' union, but returned to New South Wales and in 1893 was elected as an official of the Back Creek miners' lodge. He joined the Australian Socialist League in 1897 and was influenced by the Industrial Workers of the World, supporting direct action and strong unions. Appointed treasurer of the Colliery Employees' Federation, a northern union, in 1904 and president in 1906–10, he was influential in uniting the northern, western and southern unions as the Coal and Shale Employees' Federation in 1908. Bowling was a militant socialist and supported confrontation against the mine owners, calling for a general strike which eventuated in November 1909. Supporting radical action against the calls for moderation from his fellow mining representative Billy Hughes, Bowling was arrested for conspiracy in Newcastle on 4 December and later physically attacked Hughes while out on bail. He was sentenced to two and a half years' imprisonment in Goulburn Gaol; the strike ended in defeat in March 1910. Despite this apparent failure, Bowling was used in the Labor campaign for the 1910 state election, appearing on posters in leg-irons; Labor won government for the first time in New South Wales in that election. After his release Bowling visited New Zealand, during which time he lost his union presidency; he subsequently worked in a colliery in Balmain and the abattoir at Homebush. Initially an anti-conscriptionist, he switched to the conscriptionist camp in 1917 after four of his sons enlisted. Robert served in France in the Medical Corp. After the War, one of his sons jointed the NSW Police Force. Realising through his son that the Police had no formed union structure, Bowling was instrumental in the establishment and development of the NSW Police Union. In later years, he and Billy Hughes became close friends, particularly after Hughes' daughter committed suicide by jumping off a ship having steamed out of Perth on the way to the UK. As a single young woman, she was depressed by her pregnancy and feared family shame. During the 1920s Bowling worked on the Sydney wharves before retiring. He died of cerebral arteriosclerosis in 1942 at Sacred Heart Hospice in Darlinghurst."

  "text" : "Peder Moos (27 January 1906, Sønderborg – 1 April 1991, Tønder) was a Danish furniture designer and cabinetmaker who crafted nearly all his pieces himself. The son of a farmer, he attended Askov Højskole, a folk High School, before training as a cabinetmaker in Jutland and later in Copenhagen. From 1926 to 1929, he worked in Paris, Geneva and Lausanne. In 1935, he moved into Bredgade in Copenhagen where he started his own workshop which he maintained for 20 years. He attended evening classes at the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts where he studied under Einar Utzon-Franck and Kaare Klint. Moos designed a bed that could slide in and out of his window so that he could sleep in the fresh air. He worked in a special way, finding the wood he needed himself and making his furniture before drafting the plans. His pieces, which were made to order, were unique in their elegance. His style is reminiscent of art nouveau but more delicate and refined. Working mainly with wood, he would sand his pieces several times with very fine sandpaper, washing them off each time. This resulted in an especially fine finish. In place of nails and screws, he used dowels and wedges in another kind of wood, creating special effects almost like marquetry. He only created some 30 to 40 pieces, but each one is quite distinctive. Apart from a trolley and a triangular coffee table manufactured by Fritz Hansen, Moos produced all his furniture himself. If customers asked what a piece would cost, he would reply: \"If we have to think in terms of price, the result will not be as good as it could be. We'll see how it works out. If you think it is too expensive, I'll hold on to the furniture and sell it to someone else.\" More often than not, customers who left their furniture behind because they thought it was too expensive would change their minds and pick it up a few weeks later. In 1956, Moos moved to Funen where he taught at the School of Crafts (Den danske Husflidshøjskole) in Kerteminde. He opened a workshop in Bredebro in the south of Jutland in 1962. His furniture has been exhibited in Stockholm, the Hague and New York's MoMA. It brings in high prices at auctions, a table with silver rivets selling for a record DKK 445,000 in 2005. In 2015, one of his dining tables were sold for 6 million DKK and in 2016 a stool were sold for DKK 860.000."

  "text" : "Pyotr Mikhailovich Yeropkin (ca. 1698-1740) was a Russian architect credited with replanning Saint Petersburg after Peter the Great's death. It was Yeropkin who designed the famous Trident of the Nevsky, Voznesensky, and Gorokhovaya thoroughfares as the city's structural center. He demanded that \"no obstacle to the view of the Admiralty spire should be permitted\" and insisted on the primacy of the embankments. The scion of a noble family, Yeropkin was one of the first professionally trained Russian architects. After 8-years study in Italy he worked in St. Petersburg under Domenico Trezzini and Niccolo Michetti. He was a relative of Artemy Volynsky, one of Empress Anne's closest advisors, and built the notorious ice palace on her request. Among his major commissions were the palaces for Chancellor Osterman, Prince Tcherkassky, and Volynsky. After Volynsky's fall from grace he was tried and executed with him. Empress Elizabeth had a monument erected to Yeropkin's memory near his tomb in St. Sampson's Cathedral. The current memorial by Alexander Opekushin was raised in the late 19th century at the behest of historian Mikhail Semevsky. No buildings by Yeropkin survive, but he is still remembered as the first ethnically Russian town-planner and the first translator of Palladio's books into Russian."

  "text" : "Petrona Viera (24 March 1895 – 4 October 1960) was an Uruguayan painter. She was born in Montevideo in 1895 as the daughter of Carmen Garino and President Feliciano Viera. She is considered the first female professional painter in Uruguay. She was part of the Planismo movement of austere lines and bright colors. Viera was deaf since the age of two due to meningitis, and used art as a way to express herself. As a child she was taught by a French teacher specializing in the teaching of deaf children, Madame Madeleine Larnaudie. She began to paint at age 18, with private lessons from the Catalan master Vincent Puig, but later he left the country and in 1922 Viera began to take lessons from Guillermo Laborde. She began to exhibit her paintings in 1923, and had her first solo exhibition in 1926 at Gallery Maveroff. Viera was the first female painter in Uruguay to win prizes and also the first to be a full-time professional painter. Viera had to strive to overcome prejudice against her as the daughter of the President. When Guillermo Laborde died in 1940, Viera suffered an acute crisis, which led her to change the direction of her work. She then learned the art of engraving with Guillermo Rodríguez. She also continued to paint, but changed her themes, including scenes of nature such as flowers, animals, etc. Her painting 'Calle de Malvin' sold at Castells 'National Pictures' in 2013 for $16,500."

Partha Ghose is one of India’s best known popularizers of modern science.He has written influential papers and books on physics as well as popular books on science. He was an anchorperson in the popular Indian TV shows Quest and Eureka. He has directed plays and appeared in media programmes and films including the National Award-winning film ‘The Quantum Indians', which is about great Indian scientists Satyendranath Bose, C. V. Raman and Meghnad Saha. Partha Ghose received the National Award for the Best Science and Technology coverage in the Mass Media of the National Council for Science and Technology Communication (NCSTC) for the period 1986–1990. He was also awarded the Indira Gandhi Prize for the popularization of science by the Indian National Science Academy. He is best known in the physics world for his significant contributions to theoretical physics, particularly the foundations of quantum mechanics. (i) His paper in collaboration with D. Home and G. S. Agarwal (the GHA experiment) in unraveling the nature of wave–particle duality in single-photon experiments led to its experimental verification by Y. Mizobuchi and Y. Ohtake in Japan and later by M. Genovese and collaborators in Italy. This work has been widely referred to and has found place even in popular texts., (ii) His work on Bohmian trajectories of photons formed the basis for a comparison of these trajectories from those that were later observed experimentally with weak measurements. (iii) He has also made a pioneering contribution by showing that ‘entanglement’ can occur in classical polarization optics resulting in violations of Bell-like inequalities hitherto believed to be exclusive to quantum systems. This has led to many investigations and experiments confirming such violations and consequently to a shifting of the boundary between quantum and classical physics. Ghose’s exposition of Rabindranath Tagore’s philosophy and music has found expression in several scholarly papers and CDs, He served as the Hon. Secretary of the Visva-Bharati Music Board for a few years. He received training in Rabindra Sangeet under veterans like Debabrata Biswas and Santidev Ghosh (a direct disciple of Tagore). He also served as a member of the Working Group on National Language Policy, Knowledge Commission, Govt of India."

  "text" : "Peter Deriabin (1921-1992) (Петр Дерябин) was a Russian Communist Party member, World War II veteran, SMERSH agent, and KGB agent who later defected to the United States. He started working for the Central Intelligence Agency, went to graduate school, and wrote several books on the KGB. He died in 1992 at age 71. He was a member of the Communist Party. He went to Biysk Teachers College as well as the Institute for Marxism-Leninism. In World War II he was wounded four times and reassigned to the Soviet Navy's SMERSH (military counterintelligence group). He was later an investigator in State Security. He eventually moved up to the KGB headquarters. In 1953 he was stationed in Vienna, Austria as Chief of Soviet Counterintelligence as well as Communist Party boss for the entire Austro-German section. In 1954 he defected to the United States. In retaliation, the Military Collegium of the Supreme Court of the USSR gave him a death sentence. He testified before the Senate and the HUAC in 1959, and cowrote a book about his time in the KGB. He also went to graduate school at the University of Michigan and the University of Virginia. He also joined the CIA. A few days after the assassination of President Kennedy, Deriabin wrote a lengthy memorandum for the CIA. In it he theorized that Oswald was a Russian KGB agent who either was dispatched to kill Kennedy or was sent to the United States on a different mission and then committed the assassination on his own. Deriabin contended that the Russians would have accomplished several objectives by eliminating Kennedy. Among them was removing the West's preeminent cold warrior from the scene; constraining US covert actions against Cuba, which would be stigmatized as acts of vengeance; and divert the Russian people's attentions from their many domestic problems. He was also involved in the Yuri Nosenko case, a controversial Russian defector who was treated harshly by the CIA (including solitary confinement) and presumed to be a KGB plant for at least a year before he was released. Deriabin was one of the CIA officials who believed he was a plant. He claimed that the details of Nosenko's stories about his experiences in SMERSH and the KGB didn't match up with Deriabin's own experience in those agencies. Deriabin retired from the CIA in 1981. At the time of his death he was survived by family members whose names were kept secret by the CIA."

  "text" : "Sir Peter Fretchville (c. 1571 – 9 April 1634) was an English politician who sat in the House of Commons in 1601 and from 1621 to 1622. Fretchville was the son of Peter Fretchvile of Staveley and his second wife Margaret, daughter of Arthur Kaye of Woodsome, Yorkshire. He matriculated at St John's College, Cambridge in 1587. He entered Middle Temple in 1591 but in 1596 petitioned his Inn to be allowed to keep his chamber since the business of managing his several estates in Derbyshire prevented him from occupying it for the statutory eight weeks. In 1601, Fretchville was elected Member of Parliament for Derbyshire. While serving he was appointed Sheriff of Derbyshire for c.1601. Although it was illegal to stand for parliament while serving as Sheriff, it was legal to become Sheriff while serving as an MP, as the discussions of the time concluded. He was knighted at Sir Edward Stanhope’s house at Grimston on 19 April 1603 while King James was on his journey from Scotland. He was a J.P. by 1604. In 1604 he was a collector of the loan. He was awarded MA at Cambridge University in 1613, probably on the visit of Prince Charles. He was commissioner for musters by 1618. In 1621 he was elected MP for Derbyshire again. He was Deputy Lieutenant by 1624 and was collector of the loan in 1625. Fretchville died at the age of about 62 and asked in his will to be buried in the church at Staveley. He had married firstly Joyce Osborne, widow of Sir Hewett Osborne and daughter of Thomas Fleetwood of The Vache, Buckinghamshire and had at least one son and one daughter. He married secondly Isabel Hastner, widow of Sir Richard Hastner and daughter of Percy Neville of Grove, Nottinghamshire."

He descended from the family of Bickerstaffes, of Bickerstaffe, Lancashire. Although he opposed the transfer of the Crown to the Prince of Orange in 1668-9, he was re-elected for the next parliament of 1669-90. He was known to be \"a courtier of the Widdrington group but an unimpeachable Anglican\" and a Clerk of His Majesty's Woodyard from about January 1669. Bickerstaffe was a free burgess of Newcastle, a member of one of the twelve mysteries of the same town, and was admitted to his personal freedom of the fellowship of Hostmen on 11 September 1684. On 15 November 1692, Bickerstaffe was said to have \"claimed that the actions of three men in suing Sir Francis Bland in the court of Exchequer constituted a breach of privilege\". His parents were Howard Bickerstaffe of Chelsham and Elizabeth, while his brother was Sir Charles Bickerstaffe, Kt, Cup-bearer to Charles II. He married Jane (d. 1694), the widow of John Clarke II, M.P. of Cockermouth. Through marriage, Bickerstaffe's seat became the newly built Chirton Hall in the 1670s. Unable to meet various bonds, he lived in Fleet Prison, as reported in 1713."

He belongs to a flamenco dynasty of gypsies started by his grandfather, known as \"Habichuela el Viejo\" (Old Bean), who took the nickname, and continued by his father José Carmona and his brothers Juan Habichuela (1933), Carlos and Luis. In 1964 he moved to Madrid where he performed in several flamenco shows and shared the stage with artists such as Juanito Valderrama, Camarón de la Isla and Enrique Morente. He recorded an album in tribute to singer Antonio Chacón which won the National Prize of discography in 1975. He is the father of José Miguel Carmona Niño and uncle of Juan José Carmona Amaya El Camborio and Antonio Carmona Amaya (sons of his brother Juan Habichuela). The three formed the New Flamenco band Ketama. In 2001, Habichuela released the album Yerbagüena as part of Pepe Habichuela & The Bollywood Strings, a unique mix of flamenco guitar and Indian string music. He has also experimented with Arabic-flamenco fusion music. Habichuela was a mentor to Adam del Monte.He has been described as \"highly emotional\" like Tomatito, with one author saying \"If flamenco has earned its rep as an overly emotional music, it isn't going to be Habichuela who turns it around.\""

  "text" : "Pierre Ayotte was a French-Canadian soldier and fur trader who served with the Americans during the American Revolutionary War. Ayotte, a habitant from Kamouraska, was equally devoted to the revolutionary cause as Clément Gosselin. Ayotte and Gosselin were Canadian volunteers who first served with General Richard Montgomery, then went on to become recruiters and agitators on the lower south shore of the Saint Lawrence. Following Montgomery's death at the Battle of Quebec, the two became captains in Colonel Jeremiah Duggan's Canadian regiment. Congress subsequently transferred command of the regiment to Moses Hazen. Ayotte helped to raise troops for the American cause and fought at the Battle of Saint-Pierre. He was captured near Quebec City in May 1776. In 1783, Congress granted Ayotte land in the Lake Champlain area in recognition of his service."

He was a professor to the Faculté de Médecine de Paris, and in 1789 elected surgeon of the Garde Nationale. On 13 July 1793, moments after the assassination of Jean-Paul Marat by Charlotte Corday, Pelletan was present at the crime scene. The minutes on the death certificate bear his signature. In 1795 he succeeded Pierre-Joseph Desault (1738–1795) as chief surgeon at the Hôtel-Dieu. Following the death of 10-year-old Louis XVII on 8 June 1795, he was responsible for performing the autopsy. In 1804 Jean-Nicolas Corvisart (1755–1821) had Pelletan appointed consultant-surgeon to the Emperor. While chief surgeon at the Hôtel-Dieu, Pelletan was involved in a case of misdiagnosis that led to the death of a patient. An opportunistic Guillaume Dupuytren (1777–1835) informed the personal physician of Tsar Alexander of the situation, which triggered an investigation into the matter. Because of the mistake, on 6 September 1815, Dupuytren was named as Pelletan's replacement as chief-surgeon at the Hôtel-Dieu."

He worked under the auspices of Count Nikolai Rumyantsev hand in hand with Konstantin Kalaidovich until the latter went insane in 1825. In 1817 and 1818 Stroev and Kalaidovich wandered from monastery to monastery around Moscow in search of ancient manuscripts. They published several texts of international treaties and other historical documents from the Moscow archive in 1819-21. Seven years later Stroyev launched the first of his \"archaeographic expeditions\" that led him through no less than 14 provinces in 1829-34 and resulted in the publication of more than 3000 historical documents. He was named a corresponding member of the Petersburg Academy of Sciences in 1826 and a full member in 1849. After the Tsar bought the immense manuscript collection of Count Fyodor Andreyevich Tolstoy in 1830, it was Stroyev who prepared it for publication."

In 1908, he went into exile in Geneva where he stayed until returning to Russia in 1917. In 1914, he reconstituted Vpered arguing that the reason so many European socialists supported the First World War indicated that socialist ideology was weak - something which could be addressed by scientific and socialist education. He also used the pseudonym Valerian Polianskii. He joined the Bolsheviks in August 1917. From 1917 - 1919, he was commissar of the literature and publishing department of the People's Commissariat for Education, where he organised new editions of works of classic Russian literature. From 1918 to 1920, he was chairman of the All-Russian Council of Proletkult during which time he edited Proletarskaya Kul'tura with Fedor Kalinin. In 1921, he became director of Glavlit, a post he held until 1930. From 1928–1930, he edited Literatura i marksizm (Literature and Marxism). He was also a member of the editorial board of the first edition of the Great Soviet Encyclopedia. From 1934–1939, he edited Literaturnaia entsiklopediia (Literary Encyclopedia). He published a number of books: \n*  Lenin and Literature, (1924) \n*  Three Great Russian Democrats, (1938) He was awarded the Order of Lenin."

His son John Caldwell Calhoun (born in South Carolina in 1782, died in Washington in 1850) was Vice-President of the United States from 1825 to 1832, and held other important offices, and was undoubtedly the ablest and most uncompromising champion of slavery and the slave power in his day. His great-grandson and namesake was the entrepreneur Patrick Calhoun."

In this capacity he was stationed in Aix-la-Chapelle, Elberfeld and lastly Düsseldorf. During his lifetime he amassed a large collection of Lepidoptera specimens from European and exotic locales. His personal entomological excursions largely took place in Germany, Switzerland and Italy. His principal work was titled Beitrage zur Schmetterlingskunde, a five-part series on Saturniidae that was first published in 1869. Later parts of the work were co-authored with Gustav Weymer (1833–1914). Also with Weymer, he wrote (1890) Lepidopteren gesammelt auf einer Reise durch Colombia, Ecuador, Perú, Brasilien, Argentinien und Bolivien in den Jahren 1868-1877 von Alphons Stübel, published in Berlin by A. Asher & Co. Other literary efforts by Maassen were for the most part confined to articles printed in the Stettiner entomologische Zeitung. He died in Falkensteig on August 2, 1890, during an exploratory trip to the Black Forest. His collection is conserved in Museum für Naturkunde in Berlin."

  "text" : "Philip Ernest, Count of Hohenlohe-Langenburg (11 August 1584 in Langenburg – 29 January 1628 in Weikersheim), was Count of Hohenlohe-Langenburg and was the fourth son of Wolfgang, Count of Hohenlohe-Weikersheim (1546-1610), who later became regent of the county of Weikersheim and his wife Magdalena of Nassau-Dillenburg (1547-1643). He served in the Dutch army until he inherited the Dutch Lordship of Liesvelt from his uncle, Philip of Hohenlohe-Neuenstein. When his father died in 1610, he and his brothers George Frederick (1569-1647) and Kraft (1582-1641) divided the inheritance. George Frederick received Weikersheim; Kraft received Neuenstein and Philip Ernest received the Lordship of Langenburg. He immediately began the construction of Langenburg Castle. He spent much of his time in the Netherlands, until he was relieved of his duties as a colonel by the States-General. He died in 1628, at the age of 44, in Weikersheim, of a \"stone disease\". He was buried, together with his wife, in the crypt of the church in Langenburg. A stone monument commemorating the couple can be found behind the altar."

  "text" : "Patrick Russell (1629-14 July 1692) was Archbishop of Dublin from August 1683 till his death. He was a native of Rush, County Dublin. A Compendium of Irish Biography (1878) says of him: \"He could with difficulty exercise his functions in public, and was frequently obliged to conceal himself amongst his relatives at Rush. After James II.'s accession he held several synods for arranging the shattered affairs of the Church, and through his influence the King was induced to settle £200 per annum out of the Irish revenues upon the Catholic bishops. During James's residence in Dublin the Archbishop took a prominent part in public affairs. After the battle of the Boyne he was tracked to his concealment in the country, and cast into prison, and lingered in a filthy underground cell until 14 July 1692, when death put an end to his sufferings.\""

He also competed in the Olympic Trials in 1952, 1956 and 1960.

  "text" : "Peter Grudzien is an American country/psychedelic singer-songwriter, photographer, commercial artist, musician and recording engineer. Grudzien's music has been well known in the outsider music community since its inclusion in Irwin Chusid's book Songs in the Key of Z: The Curious Universe of Outsider Music (2000). \"There's a Star Spangled Banner Waving Somewhere\" is included on the companion CD for the book. Grudzien grew up listening to classical music and later discovered country. In the fifties, he started listening to such artists as Hank Williams, Lefty Frizzell, and Johnny Horton. (see Esoteric Culture, Issue 2, Robert Koenig) Peter had a recording contract at the age of sixteen with the Pell Brothers whom he refers to as \"Brooklyn hillbillies\". They wrote the music; he wrote the lyrics. He was tremendously influenced by Dylan, whom he met briefly. Grudzien was part of the group of luminaries such as John Herald, Peter Stampfel, Phil White, and others who played around Greenwich Village. Although he had his picture taken with Cash they did not otherwise meet and certainly never played together. Grudzien's LP, The Unicorn, was released in 1974. Grudzien had 500 copies pressed and tried, unsuccessfully, to sell them in bookstores. The album was almost entirely written, played, and produced by Grudzien except for the piano intro in \"The Innocents\", transcribed by a friend whose name he has forgotten (see Koenig). The Unicorn was re-released on CD by Parallel World in 1995. The CD release of The Unicorn also included several new songs by Grudzien, including his take on the American standard, \"There's a Star Spangled Banner Waving Somewhere\", updated with many openly gay sentiments. According to Grudzien's associate Barbara Zigman, Grudzien did not receive any royalties from Parallel World for the CD reissue. According to the label owners, the CD never sold enough to recoup the reproduction costs (which were very high because of the poor condition of the master tapes), and as per the lease agreement, was not required to dispense any royalties until such costs were recouped. An advance had been offered, which Grudzien turned down. Grudzien still occasionally performs in the New York area. He no longer records. Several post-Unicorn tapes and CDs were produced but are not generally available. However, he recently recorded \"Little Boxes\", a folk song remake for Bob Koenig's \"Abbey Lane\" CD."

  "text" : "Piotr Choynowski (Warsaw, 27 August 1885 – 25 November 1935, Otwock) was a Polish writer, novelist and translator; an elected member of the prestigious Polish Academy of Literature from 1933. Choynowski studied chemistry originally, in Warsaw and in Lwów (now Lviv), then from 1908, history and philosophy in Zurich and at the Jagiellonian University in Kraków. In 1914 during World War I he joined the Polish Legions (Legiony Polskie) to fight for Poland's independence, but his poor health forced him to quit. Since 1916 Choynowski lived in Warsaw. He became the editor-in-chief of Tygodnik Ilustrowany with which he worked until 1930. From 1933 he served as member of the Academy (Polska Akademia Literatury). Choynowski was an accomplished novelist writing in the realist style based on authenticism and truthfulness of observation. In his prose, he focused on the life of Polish upper classes, inspired by writings of Henryk Sienkiewicz. One of his most notable novels, devoted to Warsaw in the year 1920, was Dom w śródmieściu (A House Downtown, 1924). He also translated into Polish The Sorrows of Young Werther by Johann Wolfgang Goethe among other works. Choynowski was nearly forgotten in communist Poland under the Soviet domination. In 1953, during Polish Stalinism one of his stage plays was revived temporarily called Ruchome piaski (Shifting Sands, from 1913). In 1988 his novel W młodych oczach (In the Young Eyes, 1933) was reprinted, and in 1991 another one, called Młodość, miłość, awantura (Youth, Love and Disturbance, from 1926)."

With an educational background and degrees in both Psychology and Art, he investigates and deconstructs complex sociopolitical issues from the interstices in personally expressive ways that humanize his subjects by incorporating a variety of photographic, video, drawing, and installation techniques into his artwork.

Dudo of Saint-Quentin, in his panegyric of the Norman dukes, describes her as the daughter of a \"Count Berengar\", the dominant prince of that region, who was captured at Bayeux by Rollo in 885 or 889. This has led to speculation that she was the daughter of Berengar II of Neustria. Despite the uncertainty of her parentage, she undoubtedly was a member of the Frankish aristocracy.

Adderley was originally a member of the Progressive Liberal Party (PLP) under Lynden Oscar Pindling. However, Adderley left the PLP in 1965 and established the National Development Party (NDP) political party. He returned to the PLP shortly before the Bahamas achieved independence from the United Kingdom in 1973. On 1 March 1973, he was appointed Minister of External Affairs and on 10 July 1973 became the country's first – and ultimately longest serving – Attorney General. Adderley retired from politics, remaining an active attorney as of 2010. In September 2010, he appeared in the documentary film On the Wings of Men, about Lynden Oscar Pindling by Bahamian filmmaker Calvin Harris. Adderley died on 19 September 2012, aged 84, and was given a state funeral on 28 September."

The cathedral chapter of Würzburg Cathedral elected him to be Prince-Bishop of Würzburg on February 6, 1623, with Pope Urban VIII confirming his appointment on March 19, 1624. As bishop, von Ehrenberg was a fierce supporter of the Counter-Reformation and supported re-Catholicization throughout his territories.

  "text" : "Publius Petronius was appointed by the Roman Emperor Gaius Julius Caesar Augustus Germanicus, better known to posterity as Caligula, as Governor (Legate) of Syria in AD 39, probably arriving in the country late in the year. Little seems to be known about him before or after this governorship, but A.A.Barrett  lists him as an example of the \"excellent appointments\" made by an emperor often dismissed as mentally unbalanced if not insane. As Governor of all Syria Petronius was assisted by lesser officials in charge of various areas. The Prefect of Judea at this time was Marcellus who had arrived only a year earlier, and at about the same time as Petronius' appointment (Herod) Agrippa I (grandson of Herod the Great) had Galilee and Peraea added to his domains, but he was not then in the country. Sometime in the winter of AD 39/40 the Greek population of Jamnia in Judea erected an altar to the imperial cult (worship of the emperor) and the resident Jews promptly tore it down, resulting in serious communal rioting. The destruction of an altar for his own worship was apparently taken as a personal insult by Caligula who was already beset by strife between Jews and Greeks in Alexandria, both of whom had delegations in Rome seeking his adjudication. The emperor struck a counter-blow by instructing Petronius that the temple at Jerusalem should be converted into an imperial shrine with an enormous statue of the emperor in the guise of the Romans' supreme god Jupiter. The Governor was to use two of his available four legions to enforce this decree. This proposal struck at the very heart of the religion of the Jews who were an important element of the population and business sector of most cities throughout the empire (as shown in The Acts of the Apostles and attested by Roman historians). Petronius had already made a preliminary study of Jewish philosophy and so was aware of the troubles that were brewing. He ordered the construction of the statue in Sidon but told the sculptors to be in no hurry while he sought to negotiate with the Jews. He marched his two legions to Ptolomais on the border of Galilee where he was met with a massive demonstration. Leaving his army, he went on to Tiberias, capital of Galilee, where he met a high profile delegation which made it clear that they were being asked to accept the impossible. It appears that there were no overt threats of violence, though it was clearly in the wind, and the harvest (AD 40) was being neglected already, which could bring famine to Tyre and Sidon and other neighbouring areas. (See Acts. 12. 20 - 24 just four years later) Petronius withdrew his forces and bought more time while he wrote to Caligula with an appeal to change his mind in view of the dangerous course that events were taking. There are various versions of what happened next. One has it that the emperor responded with fury and told Petronius to get on as ordered and followed that up with an order for him to commit suicide. All agree that the one man from whom Caligula would take advice, Agrippa, arrived back in Rome previously unaware of what was brewing and persuaded him to offer to rescind the temple order in exchange for Jewish promises not to interfere with the imperial cult outside of Jerusalem. In any event, the news of Caligula's assassination in January AD 41 arrived in Syria and Judea before either the suicide order or the new offer. Claudius became the new emperor immediately, aided by Agrippa (the Herodian family were always able to play both sides against the middle) who was rewarded with sovereignty over Judea and Samaria in addition to his existing rule and Petronius was recalled to Rome. It is believed that he was the husband of Plauta, sister of Aulus Plautius (conqueror and first governor of Britain) and the father or adoptive father of Publius Petronius Turpilianus, governor of Britain AD 61-63. Tacitus refers to the latter merely as Turpilianus."

Educated at St. Paul's School, he earned his doctorate at Harvard University in 1928, where he studied under the influence of Charles Howard McIlwain. He taught European history at Williams College as assistant and then associate professor. In 1936 he became Dean of Students at Williams College. He was also a trustee of Vassar College. He then entered a career in government service. During World War Two, he served in the Office of Strategic Services. In 1947, he was assistant military attaché at the U.S. Embassy in Paris. In 1948-1949 he worked for the Brookings Institution. He later served as a reserve foreign service officer in Paris and at the U.S. Embassy in Stockholm. According to obituaries, however, he actually worked for the Central Intelligence Agency from 1949 to 1962. Birdsall died at the age of seventy in Christiansted, United States Virgin Islands, where he had been in retirement for eight years. He was the author of several works on diplomatic history. He is chiefly remembered for Versailles, 20 Years After, as well as a number of articles on the diplomacy of Woodrow Wilson. His sister Jean Birdsall was also a historian, having received her doctorate and serving as associate professor at Vasser until her death in 1935. The American Historical Association awards a biennial prize in his honor to the author of the most important work on European military or strategic history since 1870 by a citizen of the United States or Canada. The prize was created through the gift of historian Hans W. Gatzke, who remained anonymous until his own death."

In September 2011, it was announced that \"Paul\" was invited to give his presentation in the “New Frontier” program at the 2012 Sundance Film Festival in Park City, Utah  to be followed by a series of lectures at REDCAT in Los Angeles in February 2012. In 2014 the Brooklyn Academy of Music (BAM) invited Abacus to share his presentation for the first time on the East Coast of the United States as part of the fall Next Wave Festival. The show draws inspiration from the work of polymath R. Buckminster Fuller. An updated version of Fuller's visionary data-visualization device, the Geoscope is utilized to make the argument that we are living near the end of the Screen Age, a historical moment when \"the era of nations\" will wane."

  "text" : "Pierre Henri Cami (1884–1958) was a French humorist. \"Though blissfully ignored for most of his life by theEnglish-speaking public, Cami (Pierre Henri) remainedfor four full decades one of France’s most prolific,and acclaimed, comic authors. Hailed by his idol andadmirer Charlie Chaplin as “the greatest humorist in theworld,” Cami was somewhat willfully omitted by AndréBreton from his Anthologie de l’Humour Noir—no doubton account of his huge popular success—but admiredby other Surrealists. Between 1910, when he foundedLe Petit Corbillard Illustrè, the “humorous organ of thecorporation of undertakers,” and his death in 1958,Cami published well over forty volumes of minidramasand comic novels—notably The Memoirs of God-the-Father, The Adventures of Loufock-Holmes, The Son ofthe Three Musketeers, and the travels of his perhaps mostfamous creation, Monsieur Rikiki and the Rikiki family—as well as countless songs, strip cartoons, screenplaysand even operettas. Many of these he also illustrated.But Cami was best known for his “dramatic fantasies,”written mostly for La Vie Drôle, the humorous columnpublished weekly by Le Journal, where he had stepped,somewhat belatedly, into the shoes of that column’simmortal co-founder, Alphonse Allais. Self-styledmicrodramas of everyday life, of legend, of history(and even of geography), of true (and false) romance,and more often than not of volupté, these screwballcan sneze a whole universe out sideways to the Marx Brothers and forward to, inEngland, the Goons and, in France, to the Theatreof the Absurd.\" —John Crombie (Introduction to A Cami Sampler) See A CAMI SAMPLER. Translated from the French by John Crombie.Publisher: Black Scat Books. A collection of Cami's comic microdramas, plus a selection of his drawings.[REF: publication date: Jan., 2013; www.blackscatbooks.com] Read Doug Skinner's translation of Cami's The Man in the Iron Mask."

By 1347 he was the Prince's receiver-general, responsible for collecting the income from the Duchy of Cornwall and other estates, much of which was spent on the prince's military campaigns in France. In 1363 Lacy was the priest of Northfleet, Kent and prebendary of Wolverhampton and Bisley, the latter of which he exchanged for the prebendary of Swords, in Ireland. When William Wyckham became Chancellor in 1367, Lacy was appointed Keeper of the Privy Seal in his stead. When Wyckham resigned his post in 1371, under pressure from anti-clerical pressures in Parliament, Lacy was obliged to follow suit. They were succeeded by laymen. He died in 1375 in his Northfleet parish and was buried in St Botolph's Church, Nortfleet."

Alletz spent some years living in a catholic community belonging to the Oratory of Saint Philip Neri before working as a lawyer in Montpellier. He quickly abandoned law, however, and moved to Paris to devote himself entirely to writing. His numerous works are nearly all useful reference texts. Alletz's most famous work, L'Agronome, ou Dictionnaire portatif du cultivateur (\"The Agronomist, or Portable Dictionary of the Farmer\"), was first published in 1760 in a two-volume format and was frequently republished until the 19th century; it was considered one of the best manuals of country living during its time. Besides advice on gardening, raising livestock, veterinary medicine, and hunting, the manual contains a large number of practical recipes fit to satisfy a sophisticated country epicure. The section devoted to wine and wine-making is significant and covers such topics as pairing wines, anecdotes concerning wine, authors who wrote about wine, types of wine, and vinegar recipes. Alletz is the grandfather of the author Édouard Alletz."

Somehow branded as a \"livre-culte\", La Défaite has had four editions, the latest one by Allia (2010). Also a playwright, radio producer and journalist, Minet has left a dense diary En mal d’Aurore, Journal 1932-1975.

  "text" : "Paul Robin (1837–1912) was a French educator and scientist. Paul Robin, a college professor, was the most significant figure of the French Neo-Malthusianism movement. Early in his life Robin was a socialist & supporter of Marx & Engels in the First International before they excluded him, along with Michael Bakunin. Expelled from Belgium in 1869, Robin moved to Switzerland, where he was helped & influenced by Bakunin, then moved to London. Robin lived in London for 10 years, then went to France in 1880 where he became head of the Prévost Orphanage in Cempuis (Oise). Here he threw in all his energies & put into practice a completely original libertarian pedagogy. Functioning like a boarding school, more than 600 children were there between 1880 & 1894. Robin's teaching was based upon observation, development of the artistic direction of the child & taking into account the children's desires. Co-education was the rule, & the children were taken along for two months to the sea each summer, etc. Physical, manual & intellectual education were complemented with 19 different workshops which provided them at least one complete formation of a trade occupation (a bakery, printing works, photography, masonry, etc). These workshops also provided the school a certain financial autonomy. Unfortunately this libertarian school was subjected to numerous rightwing attacks, & on August 31, 1894, Paul Robin's license was revoked. Robin then turned his energies to the néo-Malthusian cause, influencing & working for a time with Eugene Humbert, with whom he eventually had a falling out. Tired & worn down by the struggles, Paul Robin committed suicide on September 1, 1912. But Robin's legacy at Cempuis was not lost, & he had a tremendous influence on two other great libertarian pedagogues: Francisco Ferrer & Sébastien Faure."

Phillip was born in Enfield, United Kingdom, but he grew up in Cheshunt, Hertfordshire, where he was a pupil at Cheshunt School. From 1986 to 1989, Phillip studied for a Bachelor of Arts Degree in Media Studies, at what was the Polytechnic of Central London, currently the University of Westminster. Phillip worked as a broadcast radio journalist for BBC Scotland based in Glasgow, having previously worked in London. In 2006, Phillip left the United Kingdom, and immigrated to New Zealand, where he took a position at Radio New Zealand. In 2011, he was a news bulletin editor. He was one of the founding members of a gay immigrant group, \"Queers Gone Kiwi.\". Phillip was assaulted in a street attack on Boulcott Street in central Wellington, New Zealand, on 10 December 2011, less than 15 minutes after leaving the Radio New Zealand studios, where he had finished an overnight shift. He died from his injuries at Wellington Hospital on 11 December 2011, at the age of 43 without regaining consciousness. Although Phillip suffered from a degenerative bone disorder, this did not contribute to his death. Two teenagers were charged in connection with his murder. Phillip's funeral took place on 16 December 2011, in Wellington, New Zealand. On 21 January 2012, a memorial service was held for Phillip in Long Sutton, Lincolnshire, United Kingdom. The two men charged with his murder went on trial in December 2012, and both pleaded not guilty. A number of Radio New Zealand staff were due to give evidence.In December 2012 Nicho Allan Waipuka was found guilty of manslaughter while Manuel Renera Robinson was acquitted  Only at sentencing did Waipuka's violent history and the fact that he had almost sentenced to an intensive supervision sentence for charges including assault and threatening to kill just 17 days prior to his assault on Phillip Cottrell come out. Sue Hollow's (Phillip Cottrell's sister) made a victim impact statement Phillip Cottrell's family, Wellington Central Baptist Church, other local residents, churches & businesses, the Gay & Lesbian community and representatives of Wellington Maori Iwi joined to dedicate a memorial bench & garden in Boulcott Street near where Phillip was assaulted as a tribute and to clearly say that the entire community abhors what happened"

Paula Kann was born in Vienna in 1922 and started skiing with the help of her father, Dr. Leo Kann, when she was only six years old. She moved from Austria to New York City in 1940 but soon moved to North Conway, New Hampshire with her father. There she skied with Hannes Schneider, a great ski teacher and developer of the Arlberg technique. She started skiing competitively in 1941-42, and won the Eastern Slope Ski Club Giant Slalom that year, then in 1943 she set the girl's record for the Downhill Run at Lake Placid, with a time of only 1:37:2. In March 1945 she won the Slalom Race in Sainte-Marguerite-du-Lac-Masson, Quebec on Mt. Baldy. She won the American downhill championship in 1946 and joined the United States Ski Team in 1947.In 1948 she took part in the Winter Olympics and placed 28th in the Women's downhill and 11th in the Women's slalom.

  "text" : "Arnold Paul Pascoe (26 September 1908 – 11 September 1976) was a New Zealand architect. He was born in Christchurch, New Zealand in 1908. He designed airport terminal buildings for Christchurch International Airport (late 1950s), Wellington International Airport (late 1960s), and Rarotonga International Airport (early 1970s). During his secondary school time, Peter Beaven had a conversation with Pascoe that led him to choose architecture as a career. He commenced architectural training and worked under Cecil Wood. In England, he worked for New Zealand-born architect Brian O'Rorke. After returning to Christchurch, he went into partnership with Wood for just over a year but worked on his own from 1938. In 1945, he was joined by Humphrey Hall, and over the next ten years, they designed many domestic buildings. Shortly after dissolving the partnership in 1955, Pascoe won the commission to design the new terminal building for Christchurch Airport. By August 1955, Pascoe had developed sketch plans for a 3,720 square metres (40,000 sq ft) terminal building. By October, the design work was \"well advanced\". From December 1955 to March 1956, Pascoe went on a study tour and amongst other things, he studied airport buildings in Singapore (Paya Lebar Air Base), Zürich (Zürich Airport), Amsterdam (Amsterdam Airport Schiphol), Copenhagen (Copenhagen Airport), three terminals in the UK, and sixteen terminals in the USA. Upon his return, he reported on the need to significantly increase the size of the terminal based on what he had learned, but there were also some additional requests by the airport administration. The airport terminal was built by Fletcher Construction from late 1957, and it was opened on 10 June 1959. Two of Pascoe's designs are listed with the New Zealand Historic Places Trust. One is the 1948 Pascoe House in 58 Colenso Street, Sumner, Christchurch, which was listed as Category II on 31 March 2000. The other is the design of the 1955 extension to the Christ's College Chapel. While the size of the chapel doubled, the Gothic Revival appearance of the school's quadrangle did not change. Pascoe could be eccentric, and he would leave during important meetings because he always went to by at 9pm. He died at his holiday home in Springfield on 11 September 1976."

In the following months, Crampel mapped over 2000 km of routes and signed a number of treaties with local African chieftains. In 1890 the Comité de l'Afrique française tasked him with an expedition to Lake Chad. In September he disembarked at Bangui on the Ubangi River, the last outpost of French occupation, and trekked upcountry northward. Several months later he reached the remote village of El Kouti, roughly 500 km from the Ubangi (between 9 and 10 degrees North latitude). On 9 April 1891, Crampel and a number of men in his caravan were murdered at El Kouti."

His writings were published mostly posthumously based on lecture notes. They include the Commentatorium de iure novissimo libro sex (1620), which presented the content of the Novellae together with the corresponding Dutch and French customary law, and two writings on international law, De jure feudorum commentarii (1624) and De jure pacis (1620). Gudelinus was among the first jurists who complemented the study of Roman law with that of contemporary national law, and who addressed international law as a distinct field of study."

  "text" : "Philip Barlow Oakes (31 January 1928 – 18 December 2005) was a British journalist, poet and novelist. Oakes was born in Burslem, his father was a travelling salesman and his mother was a teacher. At the age of four Oakes' father died and at the age of eight his mother developed a brain tumour. She was unable to look after him and so placed him into the care of the Royal Orphanage in Wolverhampton. Oakes was later expelled from there and finished his education at a grammar school in rural Lancashire. Oakes was conscripted towards the end of the Second World War and eventually found himself working on a troop newspaper. He continued his journalistic career on demobilization. As a journalist he worked for Truth and was a film critic for The Sunday Telegraph from 1964. As a screenwriter he worked with Tony Hancock on the script for The Punch and Judy Man (1962). Oakes also made regular appearances on the radio programme Stop the Week. Oakes retired to Lincolnshire in later life. He died there of a heart attack at the age of 77."

On November 30, 2011, when the resignation of Herman Cain, a Republican Presidential contender, seemed imminent, the Boston Globe sought Sullivan's opinion as to who would replace him as a lead contender.She didn't state who she would support as an alternative to Cain, but she offered criticism of Mitt Romney. Six days later, following the Cain's resignation, Marc Caputo, of the Miami Herald sought Sullivan's opinion as a key member of Cain's support team.At that time she ruled out Mitt Romney, Ron Paul, Jon Huntsman and Michele Bachmann.Sullivan came second to Blaise Ingoglia in the Florida Republican Party's choice of chairman."

  "text" : "Peter O'Shaughnessy OAM (5 October 1923 – 17 July 2013) was an Australian actor, theatre director, producer and writer who presented the work of playwrights ranging from Shakespeare, Shaw, Ibsen, Strindberg, Chekhov to modern dramatists, such as Ionesco, Pinter and Beckett. He is best known as mentor to and collaborator with comedian Barry Humphries in his early career. O'Shaughnessy was a major exponent of Samuel Beckett, both in Australia and in Ireland. He produced the first Waiting for Godot in Australia in 1957. He played Krapp in the Australian premier of Krapp's Last Tape at the Arts Theatre in Melbourne in 1959. He also toured a second production of Godot in Sydney and Canberra in 1969, and later directed the Irish premières of Not I (1978), Footfalls (1978), and Rockaby (1984), and the unofficial world premiers of Theatre I and Theatre II (later published in modified form as Rough for Theatre I and II) in Cambridge in 1977. O'Shaughnessy was also noted for his one-act performances of Diary of a Madman, adapted from Gogol. In 1968 he co-created an illustrated anthology, The Restless Years, based on his award-winning television program of the same name (not to be confused with the 1977–81 soap opera The Restless Years). After making significant inroads to bring Shakespeare to Australian audiences in the 1960s, his Australian career was cut short after a libelous review published in the The Australian by Katharine Brisbane. After a trial and an unsuccessful appeal, the case was ultimately determined in the High Court of Australia, where he was vindicated. However, he could no longer work in Australia. In 1970 he left for London and continued to act in and direct Shakespeare in the UK and Ireland. For The British Council he has lectured on the plays of Shakespeare to universities in many countries of Europe, and in West Africa and South America. As a historian, his two books on General Joseph Holt and his book on John Mitchel are significant contributions to Australian/Irish history."

From 1908 to 1919 he was head of the Géologie au Laboratoire Colonial in Paris. During this time period he also taught classes in geology at the Ecole spéciale d'Architecture (1909-1920). Following the retirement of Stanislas-Étienne Meunier (1843-1925), he was appointed chair of geology at the Muséum national d'histoire naturelle (1920). From 1932 to 1936 he was director of the museum. In 1916 in collaboration with other scientists, he created the Société de Documentation Paléontologique, which later became known as the Syndicat de Documentation Géologique et Paléontologique.

On 1 July the same year he became an assistant at the Astrophysical Institute Potsdam. Early in his career as an astronomer he aided German solar astronomer Gustav Spörer in his work to observe sun spot activity. Kempf joined an 1882 German expedition to Chile to observe the transit of Venus across the Sun. He was then part of solar eclipse missions to Russia in 1887 and 1914. In 1886, he was promoted to full astronomer and began a collaboration with his friend, German astronomer Gustav Müller to perform a massive survey of northern stars with magnitudes brighter than 8.5 found in the Bonner Durchmusterung. This work was published between 1894 and 1906, with the completed Potsdamer Photometrische Durchmusterung appearing in 1907. In 1894 he was named as the principal observer at Potsdam. Kempf became secretary to the Astronomische Gesellschaft in 1914, then added the job of treasurer, holding both posts until his death. He was survived by his wife, Helene Marie Emilie Kempf, who became one of the first two female members of the Astronomische Gesellschaft in 1921."

Originally a supporting craft and handyman on Style at Home, he subsequently became a cohost of This Small Space, as well as a set decorator for U8TV: The Lofters, and was first given his own show, Home to Go, in 2002. He has since hosted a number of other HGTV series, each based on the Home to... brand. In the original Home to Go, he presents small-scale home improvement and design ideas for renters and other people who do not want to overinvest in improving homes they're not planning to live in permanently. In Home to Stay, he designs spaces for people who have purchased their first permanent home. In Home to Flip, he purchases an outdated and undervalued home, and presents the process of upgrading the home for eventual resale. In his most recent series, Home to Keep, he redesigns living spaces for established homeowners who have been considering moving because one or more spaces in their current home are no longer meeting their needs. Fallico's design and hosting style incorporates do-it-yourself tips to reduce design and renovation costs. For example, he may demonstrate how to perform a simple upholstery project; how to create a custom piece of simple furniture, such as a coffee table or a storage nook, out of MDF or other casual building materials; or how to create unique and customized artwork out of craft pieces or found objects. Fallico, who is gay, was also one of the participants in \"It Gets Better Canada\", a documentary video which interviewed numerous Canadian LGBT celebrities as part of the online It Gets Better Project."

  "text" : "Howard \"Pepper\" Martin (born September 20, 1936) is a retired Canadian-American actor and professional wrestler. Born in Hamilton, Ontario on September 20, 1936, Howard Martin lied about his age and joined the Navy at only 16. \"I was a big kid for my age\", Martin explained in an interview. Playing football for the Navy, he tore his knee out in his second year and had to have cartilage removed. \"Then they found out how old I really was and kicked me out\", Pepper stated. Pepper had been dating his future wife already and they were married July 21, 1956, eventually producing two daughters and four grandchildren. He took a job at Westinghouse in Hamilton, and a chance to play with the Hamilton Tigers football club came up. Needing to get in better shape, and rehab his knee, a friend directed Martin to a gym run by Al Spittles. The gym happened to be where local wrestlers trained and Pepper soon fell in with them, learning the sport and debuting some time in 1957. In his first match, he teamed with Bolus against Johnny Evans (later Reggie Love) and Bull Johnson (father of \"Bullwhip\" Danny Johnson). Martin would live out of Windsor as he traveled the Detroit territory. He would leave for the Tennessee are and quickly return to Detroit, before going to work for Jim Barnett's Indianapolis territory, which had just opened in 1959. Even though he was still a preliminary wrestler, Pepper began making real money at this point, sometimes over $1,000 a night in the big arenas. Martin moved his family to the States to work for Leroy McGuirk's Tulsa, Oklahoma office in the 1960s and soon made good friends with his future tag partner and ring general, Al Lovelock. They worked out of New Orleans for a year; Pepper described the travel as \"horrendous\". They eventually made their way to Texas, where Pepper was stabbed by a fan. Returning home to Ontario to recoup, he later returned to Texas, but this time as a babyface (wrestling jargon for \"good guy\"). Over the next couple of years he would work in Minneapolis, Vancouver, and St. Louis before getting a phone call from Roy Shire, the promoter out of San Francisco. It was the call that would change his life by bringing him to the West Coast and his future on the silver screen. One weekend while wrestling in between San Francisco and Los Angeles, wrestler-turned-actor Woody Strode to Pepper to Hollywood for a late night romp. They ended up waking director John Ford up at three in the morning, being ejected from his lawn and then drinking until eight o'clock with Hollywood tough guy Lee Marvin. Pepper would later befriend John Ford and even spend Sundays swimming at his house. It was also while working in Los Angeles that wrestling legend Freddie Blassie would give Martin the chance to commentate the matches with Dick Lane, something that he attributes to helping him in his future acting career. Then disaster struck Martin's life. During a 1962 match in Long Beach, Martin broke his back. The doctor discovered a small vertical crack in his spine, but denying surgery, Martin had a palette made up that he would lie on for the next six weeks to keep his back straight and allow it to heal. Come June 1962, he was better and intending to return to Canada when Dick Beyer, who had worked as The Destroyer, suggested he go to the Pacific Northwest territory where a babyface was needed. Talking on the phone to promoter Don Owen (who was the first to ever put professional wrestling on television), Pepper decided to get outrageous with his pay, saying he'd do it for 10% of the gate. \"I'll stay six weeks. If I get over, I'll stay. If I don't get over, that's my notice, and I want ten percent\". Owen agreed, and what followed was the most successful run of Pepper Martin's wrestling career. In the NWA Pacific Northwest territory, Pepper would not only become a multiple time champion, but would also continue in his role as commentator, calling matches in Portland, Seattle, Tacoma and Eugene. Pepper would have an incredible year and a half long feud with Hall of Fame inductee Pat Patterson, exchanging the NWA Pacific Northwest Heavyweight Title back and forth dozens of times. \"Pat and I laughed about this the last time we were together - something like 28 times,\" Martin laughs, referencing many undocumented title switches. Officially, Martin was an NWA Pacific Northwest Heavyweight Champion five times, exchanging the title with other wrestling legends Stan Stasiak, Mad Dog Vachon, Paul Jones, Tony Borne and the aforementioned Patterson. Martin also became an eight time NWA Pacific Northwest Tag Team Champion with Shag Thomas (4x), Luther Lindsay (2x), Paul Jones and Billy White Wolf. Martin's first feature film was the 1968 film Angels from Hell. He also appeared in Walking Tall (1973), The Longest Yard (1974), Live A Little, Steal A Lot (1975), the slasher Scream (1981) and the horror comedy Return to Horror High (1987). However Martin is probably best known for his role as the truck driver, Rocky, in the 1981 sequel Superman II. Martin's TV appearances include Police Woman, The Mod Squad, I Dream of Jeannie, The Incredible Hulk and The Rockford Files. The play The Time of Your Life was revived in March 17, 1972 at the Huntington Hartford Theater in Los Angeles with Martin, Henry Fonda, Richard Dreyfuss, Ron Thompson, Gloria Grahame, Lewis J. Stadlen, Strother Martin, Richard X. Slattery and Jane Alexander among the cast with Edwin Sherin directing."

A founding member, and the first secretary, of both the Wernerian Natural History Society (1808–49) and the Caledonian Horticultural Society (1809–49), he is mainly remembered today for having endowed the Neill Medal of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. Neill' works include A Tour Through Some of the Islands of Orkney and Shetland (1806), which caused much public debate at the time, due to its descriptions of the economic misery of the islanders. He also authored the Gardening article in the seventh edition of the Encyclopædia Britannica. This article was subsequently expanded and published as a separate book under the title of The Fruit, Flower, and Kitchen Garden, which was very popular and ran through several editions. When the Nor Loch was drained in 1820, Neill was commissioned to plan the scheme of planting of 5 acres of land, which is now West Princes Street Gardens. This included the planting of 77,000 trees and shrubs. The rosaceous genus Neillia is named after Neill."

He was awarded the Committee to Protect Journalists' International Press Freedom Award in 1999 and the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe's Prize for Journalism and Democracy in 2002. Pavel Sheremet died in Kyiv on 20 July 2016 in a car explosion. The Ukraine Prosecutor's Office have said the explosion was caused by a bomb and labelled the death of Sheremet a murder."

  "text" : "Pandurang Vasudeo Sukhatme (1911–1997) was an Indian statistician who did pioneering work in the 1940s by applying random sampling methods in agricultural statistics and in biometry. He was influential in the establishment of the Indian Agricultural Statistics Research Institute. Later, while working at FAO in Rome, he developed statistical models for assessing the dimensions of hunger and future food supplies for the world. He also developed methods for measuring the size and nature of the protein gap. Another of his major contributions was the application of statistical techniques for studying human nutrition. One of his ideas, the Sukhatme–Margen hypothesis, suggested that at low calorie intake levels, stored energy in the body is used with greater metabolic efficiency and that the metabolic efficiency decreases as the intake increases above the homeostatic range. This involved paying attention to intra-individual variability that was found to be more than the inter-individual variability in protein or calorie intake. He gave a genetic interpretation of the intra-individual variation jointly with P. Narain. He was conferred the Padma Bhushan by the President of India in 1971."

  "text" : "Pei Te Hurinui Jones OBE (9 September 1898 – 7 May 1976) was a New Zealand tribal leader, interpreter, land officer, writer, translator and genealogist. Of Māori descent, he identified with the Ngati Maniapoto iwi. He was born in Harataunga, Thames/Coromandel, New Zealand, on 9 September 1898. Jones had very limited formal education and was largely self-taught. The famous Waikato Kingitanga leader, Te Puea, referred to Jones and his brother Mick as \"those bloody Hurai\" (Jews), as their father, Daniel Lewis, was Jewish. Both Jones and his older brother, Mick, and friend Leslie Kelly were at one time close associates of Te Puea of Turangawaewae. He considered himself senior in his genealogical ties to Te Puea with whom he worked. He wrote the first history of the Tainui people, having gathered the information for many years with the help of Kelly. In 1940, when Jones was suffering from cancer and expected to die, Kelly took the material to a publisher and had it printed under his own name as \"Tainui\" but Jones had an operation and lived to an old age. Jones was a strong National Party advocate. He stood for Parliament several times between 1930 and 1963. In the 1938 election, when he stood as an Independent in the Western Maori electorate (with National Party support), he came second after Labour's Toko Ratana. He stood as the National Party candidate for Western Maori in 1943, 1957, 1960 and 1963, although a newspaper report said he was \"Unofficial Labour\" in 1943. Jones was one of the Kingitanga actively involved in getting compensation for the confiscation of land in 1863 after the defeat of the Kingite rebellion. He was involved with the Maori Land Court, and with the consolidation of Māori land, and with the development of Māori land in the King Country. He was awarded an honorary degree by Waikato University in 1968 to recognise his major contribution to Waikato Tainui literature and development. In the 1961 Queen's Birthday Honours, Jones was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire for services to the Māori people."

He married Mary Clarke on 22 April 1879 and was survived by her, four sons and a daughter. Peter Seton Hay helped build parts of the Main South Line, Central Otago, Midland and Catlins River railways, before moving to the Wellington head office in 1884. His works then included Timaru Harbour, the NIMT (with the Makohine, Mangaweka, Hapuawhenua, Taonui, Manganui-a-te-ao and Makatote viaducts), Awatere bridge; Farewell Spit Lighthouse, Rakaia Gorge Bridge, Christchurch Exhibition towers, Motueka Harbour and reports on the hydroelectric potential of the Waikato, Waikaremoana, Mangawhero–Wanganui and Lakes Coleridge, Hawea, Te Anau and Manapouri.

As a younger son, Philip was originally destinened for a career in the church, but after his elder brother Philip I died, he left the clergy for dynastic reasons and ruled the County of Waldeck as regent for his underage nephew Henry VIII. In 1486, Philip and his nephew divided the county, with Philip II receiving Waldeck-Eisenberg and Henry VIII receiving Waldeck-Widlungen. In 1499, a very rich gold vein was discovered in Eisenberg, and after three years there was a long dispute between the Counts of Waldeck and the Lord of Viermund about the mining rights on Mount Eisenberg. In 1505, Duke William IV of Jülich-Berg allowed Philip II as his governor to operate mines in the districts of Ravensberg and Sparrenberg. Apart from Philip, the board of the mining company included two baliffs for William IV, representatives of the City of Bielefeld, including both mayors, and a mining expert from Thuringia. In 1507, he acquired Steffenburg Castle, which had been constructed in Adorf by Curd von Ense in the early 16th Century. He was an ally of Archbishop Albert of Mainz, which was why his was taken prisoner in March 1516 in Padberg by Götz von Berlichingen, who was fighting a feud against Albert at the time. After a long stay in captivity, Philip was released, in exchange for a ransom of 8900 ducats."

He had contacts with the Kommune 1 and with several people who would go on to form the German terrorist organization, Rote Armee Fraktion. He supplied the scene with weapons, Molotov cocktails and bombs. In 2005 it was revealed that Urbach had supplied the bomb for the November 9, 1969 attempted attack on the Jewish Community Center in Berlin by the Tupamaros West-Berlin. The bomb failed to explode, but a police report concluded that it contained enough explosives to have killed the 250 people present in the center at the time. The people behind the attack were known by the prosecutor's office, but they were not charged, presumably to avoid uncovering the government's involvement. In 1970 information by Urbach led to the first arrest of Andreas Baader who would go on to lead the Rote Armee Fraktion. His cover having been blown, Urbach testified at a terrorism trial in 1971 and was then given a new identity by the security agencies; he lived in California until his death in 2011. German historian Gerd Koenen called the planned disappearance of Urbach by the Verfassungsschutz, and the lack of official inquiries of Urbachs possible actions in fostering leftist terrorism, ″one of the greatest scandals of its kind in the history of the Federal Republic of Germany″, and added that the ongoing lack of clarification would result in a ″disturbing silence″."

The 1981 by-election in the constituency of Anson was called when Devan Nair stepped down from Parliament in order to become President of Singapore. Pang, who had never stood in a Parliamentary election before, was selected as the PAP's candidate. He faced Jeyaretnam, who had previously stood in three general elections and two by-elections in Singapore (though he had never been a candidate in Anson before), and Harbans Singh of the United People's Front. In the election, on 21 October 1981, Pang took 6,359 votes (47.1%) to Jeyaretnam's 7,012 (51.9%). Harbans Singh took 131 votes (1.0%). A number of factors are thought to have contributed to Pang's defeat. One of them was the fact that he was a new face to the public in Singapore whereas Jeyaretnam was a veteran of several elections. Another factor may have been that Pang did not make use of Anson's grassroots leaders during his campaign, upsetting some of them, and that he did not connect effectively with working-class people in the constituency. Another issue surrounding the campaign was that residents in the Blair Plain area of the constituency were unhappy that they were not being given priority for HDB flats when their homes were being demolished to make way for a new Port of Singapore Authority container complex, and some voters may have used the by-election as an opportunity to express discontent regarding this. After the by-election, Pang did not contest a Parliamentary election again. Jeyaretnam retained the Anson seat at the 1984 general election in which he defeated the PAP's Ng Pock Too."

  "text" : "Pepene Eketone (ca. 1856 – 9 November 1933) was a New Zealand interpreter, native agent, assessor and politician. Of Māori descent, he identified with the Ngāti Maniapoto iwi. He was born in Taranaki, New Zealand in circa 1856. He sometimes used an English name, which was based on missionaries, and was thus known as Fairburn Eggleston or Fairburn Eccleston. The official return for the 1931 election lists him as Pepene Tango Eketone; the middle name is not mentioned in his Dictionary of New Zealand Biography. Eketone was politically active and contested his first general election in 1887, when he stood in the Western Maori electorate; he came third out of five candidates. In the 1890 election, he came second after the incumbent, Hoani Taipua. In the 1896 election, he was one of 13 candidates in the Western Maori electorate and came seventh. He had one last (unsuccessful) attempt of getting elected in the Western Maori electorate in the 1931 general election; of the six candidates, he came fourth."

In 1896 he became head of the bacteriology laboratory in Tunis, followed by an assignment to the Constantinople Imperial Bacteriology Institute (1900). Soon afterwards he succeeded Maurice Nicolle (1862-1932) as director of the institute. In 1914 he relocated to Tangier, where he served at the newly founded Pasteur Institute. He would be associated with the Tangier institute until his retirement in 1957. During World War I he worked as a doctor at Argonne, where he performed research of bacillary dysentery with Julien Dumas (1884-1965). Remlinger was a leading authority on rabies and rabies vaccination. In 1903 he demonstrated that the causative agent of rabies was a filterable virus. He was a corresponding member of the Société de biologie (1903), the Académie de Médecine (1919) and the Académie des Sciences (1944).

  "text" : "Peter Filkins is an American poet and literary translator. Filkins graduated from Williams College with a Bachelor of Arts and from Columbia University with a Master of Fine Arts degree. Filkins is best known for his translations of post-war German literature into English. Filkins was the first to translate H. G. Adler's novels into English. Adler, a Jewish Czech intellectual, survived several Nazi concentration camps and wrote both novels and non-fiction about the Holocaust. The Journey and Panorama, the two novels Filkins translated, were written soon after the war – The Journey in 1950–1951 and Panorama in 1948, but publishers disliked Adler's literary take on the Holocaust and they were not published until the 1960s, and then largely ignored during Adler's lifetime. Writing in The New Yorker, Ruth Franklin described Adler's books as \"modernist masterpieces worthy of comparison to those of Kafka or Musil\". Before Filkins' project, only one of Adler's books, a work of history, had been translated into English, a situation that one scholar of German literature described as “one of the great intellectual scandals of our time.” Filkins decided to translate Adler's work after discovering The Journey at Schoenhof's Foreign Books, a used book store in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Filkins' translation of Panorama was listed as one of the best books of 2011 by The New Republic's editorial staff. Filkins previously translated the complete poems of Austrian writer Ingeborg Bachmann and two of her novel fragments, as well as a novel by Alois Hotschnig. In addition, he has published four collections of his own poetry. Filkins has taught literature and writing at Bard College at Simon's Rock since 1988."

  "text" : "Pieter Datheen, Latin Petrus Dathenus, English, Peter Datheen, (Cassel, Nord, c.1531 - Elbing, 17 March 1588) was a Dutch Calvinist theologian who accomplished many things for the advancement the Reformed Church liturgy. First, he translated the Heidelberg Catechism into Dutch. Second, using the singing work of John Calvin,Theodore Beza, Peter Marot, and Louis Bourgeois, Datheen set the Psalms and psalter to verse and tune in Dutch (1566), though his settings were overshadowed by those of Philips Marnix van St Aldegonde. Third, he wrote the famous \"Form for the Administration of Holy Baptism\" with its very orthodox emphasis on the Covenant of Grace containing two parts. Fourth, he wrote the equally famous \"Form for the Administration of the Lord's Supper\" still used by orthodox Reformed churches today. Fifth, he was President of the Convent of Wesel in 1568, which expressed hope for the Reformed Churches to be free from the awful persecution of Spanish Roman Catholics, and more significantly President of the 1578 Synod of Dordt. Sixth, at this latter Synod he helped write, edit, and approve the long-revered Church Order (more famously known as the 1618-1619 Church Order of Dordt) with its 84 articles. Seventh, he developed the liturgy (order of worship) used by orthodox Dutch and American Reformed Churches with the singing, alms, prayer, and preaching at the required places. Eighth and finally, during Roman Catholic Spain's very intense persecution of the Lowlands region, resulting in the deaths of 100,000 - 200,000 Reformed Christians, Datheen was a field preacher carrying his pulpit on his back and then orating to crowds of 15,000 in a blunt eloquence that was intense and captivating. In his theological-political writings Datheen displays the typically optimistic view of early Calvinist writers in the Netherlands regarding the state, although his very strong views on making sure to avoid all compromise with Roman Catholic guided countries, like Spain, put him at great odds with Prince William the Silent (of Orange) and led to Datheen's multiple political ostracizations from his fatherland. Peter Datheen married a former Roman Catholic nun, Benedicta. Together they had one daughter, Christiana. Recent research based on stylometry mentioned him as a possible author of the text of the Dutch national anthem Wilhelmus. Dutch and Flemish researchers (Meertens_Institute, Utrecht_University and University_of_Antwerp) discovered by chance a striking number of similarities between his style and the style of the national anthem."

  "text" : "Philipp Stolle (1614 – 4 October 1675) was a German composer, tenor and theorbo player of the Baroque era. Stolle was born in 1614 at Radeburg. He was a pupil of Caspar Kittel. He worked for many years at the Dresden court of Johann Georg I, Elector of Saxony, while Heinrich Schütz was Kapellmeister there. On 16 January 1649 Stolle married Anna Maria Krätzschmar. At the request of the Dresden court poet David Schirmer, Stolle produced musical settings for 68 of Schirmer's poems, published in 1654 as the songbook Singende Rosen Oder Liebes-und Tugend-Lieder. The settings were for soprano, theorbo or viola da gamba, and basso continuo. Schirmer also included 51 of the songs from Singende Rosen in his famous 1657 collection Poetische Rosen-Gepüsche. Eventually Stolle was transferred into a new ensemble at court, under the musical direction of Giovanni Andrea Bontempi. This was set up by the Elector's son, the future Johann Georg II, in response to the chronic decline of his father's Kapelle. However, in 1653, Stolle wrote to Johann Georg II asking to be released, pointing out that after 21 years of service at Dresden, his annual salary of 300 thaler was still not enough for him to provide for his family. By then he and his wife had three children. In 1654, Stolle finally left Dresden, for the court of Augustus, Duke of Saxe-Weissenfels at Halle, where he succeeded Samuel Scheidt as Kapellmeister. There he seems to have composed a number of Singspiel operas, although only one survives, Charimunda (1658, Halle). In 1660 he yielded the position of Kapellmeister at Halle to David Pohle, but apparently continued composing operas there, and subsequently went on to work at the secundogeniture court at Saxe-Weissenfels. He died at Halle on 4 October 1675."
