Qamar Jalalvi is regarded as one of the best classical Urdu Ghazal poets. His ghazal poetry has unique simplicity of expression. A poet from the age of eight, Qamar Jalalvi's writing had become quite popular by his 20s. He lived a life of financial hardship working for many years at bicycle repair shops. In India and Pakistan, a teacher of arts is known as Ustad (master), and the term is also loosely used to refer to any kind of skilled worker. Qamar Jalalvi was initially called Ustad because of his bicycle work. Popular with critics, for his mastery of poetry, they dubbed him Ustad Qamar Jalalvi once his poetry made him famous. Ustad Qamar Jalalvi died in Karachi, Pakistan on 4 October 1968."

  "text" : "Quazi Golam Dastgir (23 September 1932 – 17 October 2008) was a Bangladesh army officer and diplomat who belonged to a coterie of immigrant elites from the Indian state of West Bengal. Following a distinguished career in the Pakistan Army, he opted to join the defense services of Bangladesh after the country's independence in 1971. Quickly rising to the then top rank of Major General in the Bangladesh Army, ahead of all his military academy course mates, from 1975 to 1977, he served as the \"Zonal Martial Law Administrator\" (the equivalent of a State Governor in the military-backed government headed by President Abu Sadat Mohammed Sayem) for Dhaka Division. This included the nation's capital and was unequivocally the most important of the four provinces in Bangladesh. He commanded two of the five independent brigades that comprised the Bangladesh Army up to the mid-1970s, and served as chief of the border forces, holding the office of Director General of Bangladesh Rifles. He was one of the three Major Generals in the Bangladesh Army following the promulgation of martial law in 1975. In 1977, the service of Dastgir was transferred to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and he went on to serve four terms as Ambassador of Bangladesh until his retirement in 1991."

  "text" : "Queenie Leighton (18 July 1874 – 19 November 1943) was a British music hall star of the Edwardian era. Leighton was born in Islington in London as Lilian Caroline Augusta Rickard, the youngest of three children of William Henry Rickard, a parliamentary agent, and Fanny Harriett Rickard. In 1881 her mother and sister were recorded as actresses living in London's theatre district off The Strand, and Leighton started to become known as a child star. Her tall stately appearance, hourglass figure and auburn hair gained her starring roles. In 1898 Leighton married a surgeon, William Hotten George; he was ten years older than her and was dead by 1908. By this time Leighton had a successful stage career in London. She was a much loved principal boy in a number of Drury Lane theatre pantomimes. Women dressed in drag were becoming fashionable in the Edwardian theatre and Leighton was a popular artist in this genre. She appeared as Prince Charming, Dick Whittington, Sinbad, Aladdin and in other musical plays. In 1901 she appeared as Doña Teresa in The Toreador. Leighton went on tour but whilst appearing as Sinbad in Bradford she had an accident, falling off a stage whale during the performance. She recovered but did not continue to play the leads at Drury Lane afterwards. In 1911 Leighton met young music hall manager Frederick Charles Cockerill (1882–1953); at the start of the 1914-18 War Cockerill received a commission in the Artists' Rifles and in 1915 he and Leighton married. Leighton was one of the many stage artists who came under pressure to recruit soldiers through their performances with much emphasis on the patriotic aspect of their songs such as I'll Make a Man Out of You. Leighton was reported to have followed up her act at the Royal Hippodrome, Dover, with a tour of the town depositing 'half a dozen young recruits at Dover town hall'. Cockerill was injured and returned to his home town of Northampton where Leighton continued her recruiting work from The New Theatre, Northampton in 1918. During World War I Leighton appeared in the silent film Screen Struck (1916), but she was not a success and her career began to fail from this time. Her second and final film was Under the Greenwood Tree (1929). Leighton died in Farnworth in Lancashire in 1943. She did not have any children from either of her marriages."

  "text" : "Quintin John Goosen (4 November 1946 - 3 September 2014) was a Zimbabwean cricketer and umpire. He umpired one Test match and 12 One Day Internationals, all played in Zimbabwe. Goosen was born in Lonely Mine, Matabeleland. He played cricket for Mashonaland Country Districts before becoming an umpire. He was an umpire in the Logan Cup, Zimbabwe's domestic first-class cricket competition, from 1994 to 2002. Goosen was an umpire in one Test match, the 2nd Test between Zimbabwe and Pakistan at the Queens Sports Club in Bulawayo in February 1995, paired with Sri Lankan umpire B.C. Cooray. Pakistan won easily by 8 wickets within three days of the five-day match, but Pakistan bowler Wasim Akram was reprimanded after the Test for angrily snatching his cap from Goosen when an lbw appeal was rejected. The standard of umpiring in the Test was publicly criticised by Zimbabwean batsman David Houghton, who was also fined. He also umpired 12 One Day International matches, all played in Zimbabwe between 1994 and 2001, six at Harare Sports Club and six at Queens Sports Club, Bulawayo. He first stood in the 1st ODI between Zimbabwe and Sri Lanka at Harare on 3 November 1994, and his last ODI as umpire was the match between Zimbabwe and England at Bulawayo on 10 October 2001. He died on 3 September 2014."
