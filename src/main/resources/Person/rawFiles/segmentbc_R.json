  "text" : "Randi Malkin Steinberger (born 1960) is an American photographer, documentary filmmaker, and a published author. Steinberger collaborated with renowned artist Alighiero Boetti on two books: Accanto al Pantheon, published by Prearo Editions in Milan, and Boetti by Afghan People: Peshawar, Pakistan, 1990, published by RAM Publications & Distribution. A Chicago native, Steinberger studied art history and photography in Florence, where she worked as a fine art photographer and later produced artists’ books that are now part of the permanent collections of New York’s Museum of Modern Art and The Whitney Museum, The Art Institute of Chicago and Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago. Steinberger became acquainted with Boetti in Italy and commuted between Rome and Florence to collaborate with him. Together they produced the book, Accanto al Pantheon, published by Prearo Editions in Milan. Their second collaboration brought Steinberger to the Afghan refugee camps outside Peshawar, Pakistan, where she documented the production of Boetti’s embroidered work. In September 2011 RAM Publications & Distribution released a book of photographs taken there with essays in English and Italian entitled, Boetti by Afghan People: Peshawar, Pakistan, 1990. \"Through Steinberger's perceptive eye and illuminating words we see and feel the poignancy of the artist and the artisans who together created one of contemporary art's most exquisite and powerful bodies of work,\" according to Elsa Longhauser, Executive Director of the Santa Monica Museum of Art. A suite of these photographs were shown at the Gladstone Gallery in New York in 2010 as part of the exhibition Alighiero e Boetti: Mappe. Boetti by Afghan People: Peshawar, Pakistan, 1990, served as the companion to an Boetti exhibition organized by the Fowler Museum at UCLA, in association with Fondazione Azzurra, and complements an exhibition at the Los Angeles Museum of Contemporary Art that featured an iconic Boetti Mappa. Also a major Boetti retrospective by New York's The Museum of Modern Art, the Tate Modern in London, and Museo Reina Sofia in Madrid, opened in October 2011 and traveled throughout 2013. Steinberger’s documentary films include the insightful portrait of the modern traveler, Holi-days, which was shot in Jerusalem, Florence and Las Vegas, and aired on the Sundance Channel. In No Circus, her book of photographs, tented houses became sculptural abstractions and enigmatic monuments inserted into suburban Los Angeles. Steinberger’s photographs in No Circus are accompanied by an essay by D. J. Waldie. It ranges from the mating habits of termites to the chemistry of fumigation to the phenomenology of a shrouded house. “Everyone has looked twice at these big top monoliths,” artist Miranda July points out, “but only Steinberger has looked again and again, transforming termite tents in to public art with her gorgeous and obsessive eye.” Randi Malkin Steinberger is represented by the Sears-Peyton Gallery in New York and Los Angeles.

  "text" : "Robert Julius Betge (1824 – September 9, 1877) was a German-American politician and United States Army officer during the American Civil War. Betge was born in Prussia and emigrated to New Jersey, where he operated a stationery store. In 1857, Betge joined the board of directors of the Hoboken Bank for Savings. In 1861, at the outbreak of the Civil War, Betge received permission to organize the 68th New York Volunteer Infantry Regiment and was commissioned as its colonel. After entering service, he led the unit to Virginia where he was court-martialed. Found not guilty, Betge continued as colonel of the 68th New York until March 1862. That month, after protesting to his commanding general what he perceived to be mistreatment of his unit, Betge was placed under arrest. After his unit fought in the Battle of Cross Keys, he resigned his commission on August 6, 1862. In 1866, Betge moved to San Francisco, where he continued to work as a stationer and authored a book of verse. In 1868, he was elected to the California State Senate as a Democrat. He was re-elected in 1870 and served as the Chairman of the Committee on Commerce and Navigation. He died in 1877."

  "text" : "Richard K. Morris, OBE (born 8 October 1947) is an English archaeologist and historian who specializes in the study of churchyard and battlefield archaeology. Having been involved in the discipline since the early 1970s, he has worked at a number of British universities, including the University of York, the University of Leeds and the University of Huddersfield, as well as publishing a series of books on the subject of archaeology. He has also held a number of significant positions within the British archaeological community. He was director of the Council for British Archaeology from 1991-1999, and was Commissioner of English Heritage. Morris studied English at Oxford University before proceeding to study music at the University of York, until he finally decided to go into archaeology as an academic vocation. His first book, Cathedrals and Abbeys of England and Wales, was published in 1979, and would be followed by two others on the same subject over the following decade, The Church in British Archaeology (1983) and Churches in the Landscape (1989). Morris then published three books on the role of the Royal Air Force in the Second World War, Guy Gibson (1994), Cheshire: The Biography of Leonard Cheshire VC OM (2000) and Breaching the German Dams (co-authored with Robert Owen, 2008), before returning to the topic of landscape archaeology with Time's Anvil: England, Archaeology and the Imagination (2012) and The Archaeology of English Battlefields: Conflict in the Pre-industrial Landscape (co-authored with Glenn Foard, 2012). Time's Anvil was longlisted for the Samuel Johnson Prize in 2013. He is currently chair of The Blackden Trust, a charitable organisation involved in historical and archaeological investigation of Blackden, the late-medieval home of novelist Alan Garner, in Cheshire."

With co-researcher Arthur Squires, Farquharson was responsible for the discovery of the Farquharson phenomenon, an important principle of endocrinology, which is that administering external hormones suppresses the natural production of that hormone. He served in the First and Second World Wars, earning appointment as a Member of the Order of the British Empire for his medical work during the latter. He chaired the Penicillin Committee of Canada and served as a medical consultant for the Royal Canadian Air Force. He was awarded the Queen's Coronation Medal in 1953 for his work for the Defence Review Board. Farquharson was also a charter member of the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada. Farquharson was heavily involved in Canadian medical research and education. As a member of the National Research Council of Canada, his \"Farquharson Report\" led to the establishment of the Medical Research Council of Canada, of which he was the first president. He received numerous honorary degrees from Canadian universities, and served on the first Board of Governors of York University. He died in 1965, leaving a wife and two daughters. Farquharson was posthumously inducted into the Canadian Medical Hall of Fame in 1998."

  "text" : "Richard Fisch (1926–2011) was an American psychiatrist best known for his pioneering work in brief therapy. Dick Fisch graduated from Colby College, studied for a year at Columbia University School of Anthropology, and then entered the New York Medical College where he graduated in 1954. Dr. Fisch completed a Psychiatric Residency at the Sheppard Pratt Health System, Brookdale University Hospital Medical Center in 1958. While at Sheppard Pratt, he was heavily influenced by Harry Stack Sullivan's Interpersonal Theory of Behavior and had his first indirect contact with Don D. Jackson who would later bring him to the Mental Research Institute (MRI) in Palo Alto, CA. MRI \"became the go-to place for any therapist who wanted to be on the cutting edge of psychotherapy research and practice. Fostering a climate of almost untrammeled experimentalism, MRI started the first formal training program in family therapy, produced some of the seminal early papers and books in the field, and became a place where some of the field's leading figures - Paul Watzlawick, Richard Fisch, Jules Riskin, Virginia Satir, Salvador Minuchin, R.D. Laing, Irvin D. Yalom, Cloe Madanes - came to work or just hang out\". While at MRI, he additionally worked with John Weakland, Jay Haley, Paul Watzlawick, Virginia Satir, and many other prominent figures in the development of family therapy, brief therapy, systems theory and communication theory. In 1965, in a memo to Don Jackson, dated September 15, 1965, Fisch proposed creation of a research project that would \"provide imaginative, well planned, brief therapy and at the same time permit a more thorough study if the effectiveness of this approach. With the backing of Don Jackson, MRI's Brief Therapy Center as founded by Fisch, John Weakland, Paul Watzlawick, and Art Bodin. The Brief Therapy Center was central to the emergence of Brief Therapy approaches that have radically changed the practice of psychotherapy."

  "text" : "Sir Richard Gargrave (1575–1638) was an English landowner and politician who sat in the House of Commons at various times between 1597 and 1609. Gargrave was the son of Sir Cotton Gargrave and his second wife Agnes Waterton, daughter of Thomas Waterton of Walton. He was at Peterhouse, Cambridge in about 1591 and at Inner Temple in 1591. He succeeded to the family estates worth £3,500 p.a when his elder half-brother Thomas Gargrave was executed for the murder of a servant boy. The estates consisted of eleven manors and other property. In 1597, he was elected Member of Parliament for Aldborough. He was a J.P. for the West Riding of Yorkshire and was knighted in 1603. From 1604 to 1605 he was High Sheriff of Yorkshire. He was elected MP for Yorkshire in 1606 when Francis Clifford was ennobled. Gargrave was given to drinking and gambling. To fund his extravagance he gradually disposed of all his lands. \"He who could once ride on his own land from Wakefield to Doncaster, was reduced at last to travel to London with the packhorses, and was found dead in an old hostelry, with his head upon a pack-saddle,\" wrote Richard Vickerman Taylor in his Yorkshire Anecdotes. Echoed the genealogical publisher John Burke: \"The memory of his extravagance and his vices yet lingers about Kingsley.\" Gargrave married Catherine Danvers, daughter of Sir John Danvers of Danby Castle and had two daughters."

Stevens. Jenkins appeared on the cover of Time at the height of the hearings on May 17, 1954. In a career that spanned nearly six decades, Jenkins defended over 600 accused murderers, and never lost a client to the death penalty. At the time of the Army-McCarthy Hearings, he was described as \"the best trial lawyer in East Tennessee.\" Jenkins' courtroom style, which often involved ruthlessly assailing the character of his clients' accusers, earned him the nickname, \"The Terror of Tellico Plains.\""

He is most known for his interpretations of contemporary music. During the 1970s, he directed contemporary music series at both Juilliard and the Aspen Music Festival, where he succeeded Darius Milhaud as artistic director of the Conference on Contemporary Music. He was influential at getting American works accepted in Europe, and gave the first European performances of works by Charles Ives, Carl Ruggles, Jacob Druckman, and Elliott Carter as well as younger composers like Robert Beaser. Dufallo, as conductor, also premiered numerous works by European composers, including Karlheinz Stockhausen, Sir Peter Maxwell Davies, and Krzystof Penderecki. He was a former assistant conductor of the New York Philharmonic, and worked closely with Leonard Bernstein from 1965 to 1975. He also served as associate conductor of the Buffalo Philharmonic."

Her most influential work has been her ground breaking essay on Black women’s sexuality and identity, “The Afro-American Female: The Historical Context of the Construction of Sexual Identity,\" that deals with the invisibility of black women in history and has influenced the works of writers that deal with feminism and identities like Michael Hames-Garcia, and Darlene Clark Hine. Her work claimed that victimized black women often avoided intimacy altogether which affected their sexual identity causing them to become self-reliant. She worked as the English department at SUNY Morrisville for several years. Simson has published more than 30 articles and chapters and presented at over 50 conferences throughout in the United States and Austria. She also pioneered a study abroad program focusing on the Austrian African Diaspora in Austria with the University of Graz. She currently works as the department chair at the Department of African American Studies at Syracuse University."

Curran immigrated with his parents to the United States in 1850, and attended Harvard Medical School, graduating in 1859. At the start of the Civil War, he helped raise two volunteer companies (designated A company & K company) from Seneca Falls, New York, and joined the 33rd New York Infantry in May 1861, becoming an assistant surgeon in August 1862. He would receive the Medal of Honor for the Battle of Antietam, where he was the regiment's only medical officer present in the field. When the 33rd New York was mustered out in June 1863, he joined the 6th New York Cavalry, and subsequently became the 9th New York Cavalry, serving as the latter's regimental surgeon until the surrender of Robert E. Lee at Appomattox Court House. Following the war, Curran opened a pharmacy in Rochester, New York, where he also participated in local politics. He was elected to the New York State Legislature in 1891, and subsequently became Mayor of Rochester, New York in 1892, serving a two-year term. He was buried in Holy Sepulchre Cemetery."

  "text" : "Rex Robinson (born March 17, 1959) is a place kicker that played for the Marietta Blue Devils, University of Georgia Bulldogs of the Southeastern Conference and the New England Patriots of the National Football League. Originally from Marietta, Georgia, Rex Robinson grew up watching the NFL’s latest curiosities, soccer style kickers, such as Jan Stenerud, Garo Yepremian, and Pete and Charlie Gogalak on television each Sunday and then tried to imitate what he saw them doing. By the time he reached high school, he was receiving a great deal of attention. As a 15-year-old on Marietta’s JV team, Rex kicked a 51-yard FG in a game. A local news station sent a crew out to verify the feat. It took a few tries, but Rex duplicated the kick for the camera and was on the 6 o’clock news that night. As a senior, Rex received several scholarship offers but chose the University of Georgia. He would have the chance to play as a freshman, and UGA seemed the perfect distance from home. Rex was the team’s leading scorer and made the All-SEC Freshman Team in 1977. He would make 1st team All-SEC in 1978, 1979 & 1980 and Playboy All-American in 1979 & 1980. Rex also made the Walter Camp, Football News, Football Writer’s, and UPI All-American teams in 1980. He was invited to play in the 1981 Senior Bowl. The highlight of his senior year was beating Notre Dame in the 1981 Sugar Bowl and the Bulldogs being named the 1980 National Champion  football team. Rex finished with several SEC records including the single season FG% at 88.2%, career points (269), career field goals (56) and consecutive extra points (101). The last two categories were second in NCAA history at the time. He also had six FG’s over 50 yards, with two 57 yarders in 1980. He was drafted by the Cincinnati Bengals in the 6th round in 1981. He played for the New England Patriots in the strike shortened season of 1982. Rex was honored in 2007 as The University of Georgia’s representative at the SEC Legends Dinner as a part of the SEC Championship weekend. Rex sells sporting goods, athletic and corporate apparel for Pro Sports Team Outfitters in Atlanta. He has also worked with hundreds of young kickers since 1996 and several have gone on to play on the collegiate level. He now has a kicking instruction service called Total Kicker."

  "text" : "Robert Danvers also Wright, Howard and Villiers (19 October 1624 – 1674) was an English politician who sat in the House of Commons in 1659 and 1660. The illegitimate child of a notorious liaison, Danvers had four different names, changed religion four times and sided according to circumstances with Royalists, Parliamentarians, the restored monarchy and its opponents. Danvers was the illegitimate son of Frances Villiers, Lady Purbeck, the estranged wife of John Villiers, 1st Viscount Purbeck probably by Sir Robert Howard of Clun Castle, Shropshire and was baptised as Robert Wright. His mother was the daughter of Sir Edward Coke of Stoke Poges, Buckinghamshire. After they were convicted of adultery, his parents went to France where he was educated between 1633 and 1641 under the name Howard and brought up as a Catholic. His mother brought him back to England at the start of the English Civil War and Lord Purbeck was persuaded to recognise him as his son and let him assume the name Villiers. As Villiers, he fought for the king at the Battle of Edgehill and in 1643 became a colonel of foot in the Royalist army and governor of Oswestry. In 1644 he was dismissed by Prince Rupert, became a Presbyterian and submitted to Parliament. He inherited the estates of his mother on her death in 1645. He paid fines of £2,650 for his delinquency with borrowed money, but the estates were not freed of sequestration until 1653. After he married the daughter of the regicide Sir John Danvers he stated that he would have been willing to act as the King’s executioner. When his father-in-law died, Oliver Cromwell allowed him to assume the name and arms of Danvers \"because those of the name of Villiers had sided\" with the King. On Lord Purbeck’s death in 1658 he renounced the peerage. In 1659, Danvers was elected Member of Parliament for Westbury, Wiltshire in the Third Protectorate Parliament until he was expelled as a Cavalier. He was elected MP for Malmesbury in April 1660 for the Convention Parliament but after the Restoration, he was challenged over the treasonable remarks he made at the time of the King's execution. There followed a dispute over parliamentary privilege when he was summoned to the House of Lords as Viscount Purbeck on 15 June 1660 to answer charges. He argued that he was not a peer and on 27 July was discharged on bail for £10,000. On 27 December 1660, he swore allegiance to the restored monarchy and entered into a bond of £5,000 to do nothing to oppose it. Before Venner's rising in January 1661, Danvers spoke for the Anabaptists and against the monarchy. He was imprisoned in the Tower of London where he was still incarcerated on 2 July 1662 when his wife visited him there, and they were given licence to take the name and arms of Danvers. He was transferred to York gaol whence he escaped in 1664. In the course of the Second Anglo-Dutch War he was imprisoned on the Isle of Wight. In 1668 he was given the freedom of Wycombe. He was forced to leave England to escape his creditors, and died at Calais in 1674 where he was buried a Roman Catholic in the church of Nôtre Dame. Danvers married Elizabeth Danvers daughter of Sir John Danvers of Dauntsey, Wiltshire on 23 November 1648 and had two sons and three daughters."

  "text" : "Recy Taylor (born December 31, 1919) is an African American woman from Abbeville in Henry County, Alabama. On September 3, 1944, she was kidnapped while leaving church and brutally gang raped by six white men. Even though the men admitted the rape to authorities, two grand juries subsequently declined to indict the men, meaning no charges were ever brought against Taylor's six assailants. In 2011, the Alabama House of Representatives apologized on behalf of the state \"for its failure to prosecute her attackers.\" Taylor's rape and the subsequent court cases were among the first instances of nationwide protest and activism among the African American community, and ended up providing an early organizational spark for the Civil Rights movement."

Historian Paul Harris Nicolas (1790–1860), himself a former Royal Marine officer and the author of the two volume Historical Record of the Marine Forces (1845), paid tribute to Colonel William's firm hand in controlling the conduct of his troops on foreign soil.

He was one of the senators taken hostage by Witigis in November/December 536, but managed to escape along with his fellow senator Vergentius (also known as Bergantinus) before the Ostrogoths ordered their slaughter in Spring 537, only to be trapped in Milan during the siege of that city in Summer 538 to March 539. While Reparatus was killed when the city fell, Vergentius managed to escape with his life and left Italy for Constantinople. Responsibility for Reparatus' fatherless children fell to their uncle the Pope. Pope Vigilius married his niece, Vigilia, to Flavius Turcius Rufius Apronianus Asterius, the consul of 494, and provided for his nephew Rusticus by ordaining him as a deacon in the Roman church."

  "text" : "Rihab Rashid Taha al-Azawi (born November 12, 1957) is an Iraqi microbiologist, dubbed Dr. Germ by United Nations weapons inspectors, who worked in Saddam Hussein's biological weapons program. A 1999 report commissioned by the United States Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) named her as one of the world's most dangerous women. Dr Taha admitted producing germ warfare agents but said they had been destroyed. Dr. Rihab Rashida Taha ranks among the most important of a new breed of Third World weapons designers who were highly nationalistic, western-educated and willing to violate any international norms or scientific ethics. Taha worked hard to contribute to Iraqi weapons program although she was not a gifted student as Dr. John Turner, the head of the university’s biology department in England, recalls. As a result of Taha’s hard work she became known as the mother of all third world biological weapons programs. It was Taha who sold the idea of an Iraqi biological weapons program to Saddam Hussein and was given an award for her work in biological weapons, specifically the development of anthrax and botulinum weapons by Saddam Hussein. Moreover, she has been held up as an example to Iraqi women interested in science. Taha first rose to prominence in the Western media after being named in a 2003 British intelligence dossier, released to the public by Prime Minister Tony Blair, on Iraq's biological, chemical and nuclear capability. The dossier alleged that Taha had played a leading role in the manufacture of anthrax and other biological agents. It was this dossier that triggered the chain of events that led to the death of British UN weapons inspector David Kelly, who was accused of telling a BBC reporter that some of the intelligence had been manipulated. Dr. Kelly, as an UNSCOM weapons inspector visiting Iraq on the occasions described below, had interrogated Dr. Taha so pitilessly that she was \"reduced to tears\" (ref. Norman Baker \"The Strange Death of David Kelly\", 2007)."

  "text" : "Roger A. Stritmatter (born 21 October 1958) is a professor of Humanities at Coppin State University and the general editor of Brief Chronicles, a delayed open access journal covering the Shakespeare authorship question. He was a founder of the modern Shakespeare Fellowship, an organization that promotes Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford, as the true author of the works of William Shakespeare. He is one of the leading modern-day advocates of the Oxfordian theory of Shakespeare authorship, and has been called the “first professional Oxfordian scholar”. He was educated at Evergreen State College (B.A. 1981) and the New School for Social Research (M.A., 1988). In 2001 he was awarded a PhD in comparative literature from the University of Massachusetts at Amherst on the basis of a dissertation that assumed the authorship of Edward de Vere and accepted the work of Oxfordians J. Thomas Looney, B. M. Ward, and Charlton Ogburn, Jr., as sources on a par with peer-reviewed academic scholarship. It comprised a study of 1,043 marked passages found in de Vere's Geneva Bible, which is now owned by the Folger Shakespeare Library. Stritmatter found that 246 of those (23.6 percent) appear in Shakespeare's works as a theme, an allusion, or a quotation, which is presented as evidence for the Oxfordian theory. In 2007, Stritmatter and writer Lynne Kositsky published a treatise in the Review of English Studies proposing that William Strachey’s eyewitness account of the 1609 Sea Venture shipwreck on the island of Bermuda, A True Reportory of the Wracke and Redemption of Sir Thomas Gates, Knight, was misdated and largely plagiarized, and arguing that sources earlier than Strachey's letter account for Shakespeare's imagery and wording. The narrative, dated 1610 but not published until 1625, is generally accepted as a source for Shakespeare’s The Tempest, and a composition date later than the first recorded performance of the play would disqualify it as a possible source for the play."

  "text" : "R. M. Ryan (born 1945 in Wisconsin) is the author of Vaudeville in the Dark, (2010) which was lauded by the New York Times as having been \"written at the juncture of rapture and rupture.\" He is also the author of an earlier volume of poetry called Goldilocks in Later Life (1980) and a novel called The Golden Rules (2002). R. M. Ryan’s latest book is an autobiographical novel called There’s A Man With a Gun Over There. It is based on his experiences in the US Army as a detective and translator investigating black marketing in Germany during the Vietnam era. Trained as poet and drafted into the military, Ryan is a kind of innocent abroad as he learns the very high price of essentially becoming a fascist for the American Empire and the remnants of Nazi Germany. Nominated by its publisher for both the Pulitzer Prize and the National Book Award, There’s a Man With a Gun Over There is about what could happen to anyone in the US Army, and a cautionary tale about America’s War Machine. Publisher Martin Shepard describes the author as \"the Norman Mailer of this generation.\" Poet, screenwriter, playwright, and winner of a “Genuis” Award from the MacArthur Foundation, Naomi Wallace comments that in reading the novel she is astonished by \"the battle of consciousness Ryan has with himself concerning right, wrong, war, lies: all are in continuous flux and deeply alive.\" In an interview with Ryan, Carol Polsgrove, author of Divided Minds: Intellectuals and the Civil Rights Movement and Professor Emerita at The Indiana University School of Journalism, comments: \"R.M. Ryan’s poems are not for the faint of heart. They saunter, they soar, they dive down to despair. Vaudeville in the Dark brings together poems written over the last thirty years – since his publisher, Louisiana State University Press, brought out his first volume in 1980. That was right after he abandoned graduate school for stockbroking, which he has now abandoned for a writer’s life.\" For six years, Ryan was the lyricist for the northern California rock-and-roll band The Thugz and wrote many of the songs on their two CD’s released by Puffin records—Goin’ To Town (2009) and Peace of Mind (2011). Ryan also founded firestarter press, which publishes eccentric artifacts by writers such as Mark Strand, Tobias Wolff, Fred Chappell, John Koethe, and Abby Frucht. Ryan is married to the biographer Carol Sklenicka, author of Raymond Carver: A Writer’s Life. He divides his time between Wisconsin, San Francisco, and the Sonoma Coast of California"

Johnson was born in New York state on July 19, 1882, the son of Joseph Horsfall Johnson, who would become the first Episcopal bishop of Los Angeles from 1896 to 1928. Johnson studied architecture in Paris and then attended the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, graduating in 1910 and returned to Pasadena. His father would consecrate St. Paul's Cathedral in Los Angeles in 1924, designed by Reginald. Johnson made a good living in the 1920s designing houses in Montecito and Pasadena. Johnson made his name by designing houses for the rich, but also designed more affordable housing, a cause that assumed greater importance to him as the Great Depression wore on. In 1931 Johnson won an award for best design for a small house, receiving the award from Herbert Hoover. Johnson designed Rancho San Pedro for Los Angeles as a public housing project in 1939. Through the 1930s Johnson worked on the design of Baldwin Hills Village in Los Angeles, which was designed as an up-to-date community of inexpensive housing. Johnson collaborated with Clarence Stein, the planner of Radburn, New Jersey."

  "text" : "Along with three other members of the Mekons (Kevin Lycett, Jon Langford and Tom Greenhalgh), Bell has created and exhibited art in the U.K. and U.S. as the collective Mekons for such projects as Mekons United (1996), OOOH! (2001), Art-Tube 01 (2001), and Hello Cruel World (2002). In addition, he performed with the rest of the band in Vito Acconci’s Theater Project for a Rock Band as part of the Brooklyn Academy of Music’s Next Wave Festival in 1995 and collaborated with Kathy Acker on her lesbian pirate operetta Pussy, King of the Pirates at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Chicago, a production for which he also created and constructed the stage design. A graduate of the Wallasey School of Arts and Crafts near Liverpool, Bell’s own art has evolved stylistically over the years but remains primarily focused upon figurative painting. Much of his work has been influenced by British and American folk art of the 18th and 19th Centuries and he has developed a variety of techniques to \"age\" the paintings, making the portraits appear old like the original naive paintings appear today. His themes are often rooted in nature, work and community and have featured the rural milieus of his native England, while much of his recent work features imagery from his adopted home of California and the American West and portray subjects such as farm workers, cattle herders and farm animals. His work has been exhibited in galleries and museums in the U.S. and U.K. including the Royal Academy in London and he has contributed illustrations to a number of publications including The New Yorker magazine. While working on his painting and music after art school, Bell lived an itinerant life working on farms and riding, raising, and selling horses and, later, enjoyed a successful career as a museum and gallery exhibition designer in England. In the 1970s he was a regular performer at The Lamp Light in Wallasey, a club catering to the contemporary folk scene. Another regular performer there was a young musician from nearby Birkenhead named Declan MacManus who later found fame as Elvis Costello. Like Costello and many other British musicians at the time, Bell’s music changed as the 1970s progressed and the punk revolution exploded. After moving to Bristol and forming a punk/new wave band, recording vocals for a solo album by Martin Barre of Jethro Tull and doing some session singing in London, Bell toured with the Leeds-based Goth band, The March Violets, in the early 1980s. In 1983, Bell began singing and playing accordion with the Mekons and was on the band’s first U.S. tour in 1986 but stopped touring regularly with the band soon afterward. In 1995 he was back on the road and his contributions are found on every Mekons release since 1984 except Retreat from Memphis (1994). In addition, his music and vocals can be found on a number of compilation releases from Bloodshot Records."

Robert himself studied law as a student at Lincoln's Inn in 1617. He married by 1641 Anne West, by whom he had one daughter. In 1625, Jones was elected Member of Parliament for Carnarvon in place of Edward Littleton, his brother-in-law, who preferred to sit for Leominster. He again replaced Littleton after the 1626 election. In 1628 he was elected MP for Flintshire and sat until 1629 when King Charles decided to rule without parliament for eleven years. He held the estate of Castell-March. A Royalist on the outbreak of the first Civil War, in 1643 he was High Sheriff of Caernarvonshire and magistrate for the county, and governor of Caernarvon Castle from 1643 to 1646. He sought immunity from delinquency proceedings by Parliament by claiming to have been party to the surrender of Beaumaris Castle to Roundhead forces. During the Second Civil War, he was detained by Parliament while he was sued by four merchants for goods seized for the Royalist war effort to damages of £1,730. He was last recorded an apparent debt prisoner at the Marshalsea in 1653, when he petitioned for relief but he apparently died without the case being resolved."

In 1601 he was elected MP for Merioneth again. During this time he was unpopular with people of influence, in particular the Earl of Pembroke, and was subject to various allegations about his conduct. He was High Sheriff of Merionethshire in 1602. In 1610 he rebuilt his house at Rhiwgoch. He was High Sheriff of Merioneth again in 1615 and in 1625. Lloyd took out a pardon at the coronation of Charles I, but was written off as ‘very old’ when being considered for another term as Sheriff in the 1630s. Lloyd married Margaret Nanney, daughter of Hugh Nanney of Nannau, Dolgelly and had four sons and five daughters. His son Ellis was also MP for Merioneth."

Isaacs previously earned her B.A. from Wellesley College in 2005, where she was the Hillel Co-President. She is now the rabbi of Congregation Beth Israel in Waterville, Maine, which is a Conservative synagogue, as well as the Dorothy \"Bibby\" Levine Alfond Assistant Professor of Jewish Studies at Colby College. She's also the director of the Center for Small Town Jewish Life, also at Colby. Isaacs was born in 1983 in New Jersey. Isaacs was mentored at JTS by Rabbi Carie Carter, who placed the tallit across Isaacs' shoulders at her ordination. Rabbi Carter was a closeted lesbian during her time at JTS, and wrote the originally-anonymous chapter \"In Hiding\" about lesbian Conservative rabbis in the 2001 book Lesbian Rabbis: The First Generation. Rabbi Carter is now openly lesbian, and works at Brooklyn's Park Slope Jewish Center, which Rachel Isaacs interned at. In 2014 Isaacs was named one of \"America's Most Inspiring Rabbis\" by the Jewish Daily Forward."

  "text" : "Reginaldo Giuliani (Turin, 28 August 1887 – Warieu Pass, Ethiopia, 21 January 1936), better known as Father Giuliani, was a Dominican friar, a soldier and Italian writer. When World War I broke out Father Giuliani enlisted in the Italian Army as Chaplain and fought in the trenches with the Third Army Corps Arditi, the special Unit of the World War I Italian Army; for gallantry in action, he was awarded two bronze medals and a silver medal. After the war, he took part with the “Catholic Legionnaires”, in the seizure of Fiume under Gabriele d'Annunzio, the city on the Dalmatian coast, formerly part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire that Italy felt as “Denied” after the victory. After a turbulent period of four years Fiume was eventually annexed to Italy in 1924. He also took part in the Fascist March on Rome. In 1926 Father Giuliani wrote a book about his experience in World War I entitled “The Arditi”. The book was published in Milan by Fratelli Treves Editori and included a brief History of the Third Army Corps Arditi. In 1936 during the Italian invasion of Ethiopia he enthusiastically enlisted in the Army again, seeing this war against Ethiopia as an opportunity for a new religious crusade against heretics and infidels, and as a tool to export European civilization. Father Giuliani was assigned to the troops under the command of General Diamanti. He fell during the battle of the Warieu Pass (see First Battle of Tembien), while attempting to rescue wounded soldiers. In 1936, as a tribute to his sacrifice he was posthumously awarded the Gold Medal of Military Valor. The citation concludes: ‘A blow of a scimitar, brandished by a barbarian hand, cut short his terrestrial existence: ending the life of an apostle and beginning that of a martyr.’ In 1937 the book, “the Cross and Sword” with his letters and articles written during the Ethiopian campaign was published in Turin. In 1939 the Italian Royal Navy commissioned a submarine of the Liuzzi class with its name. After the Italian armistice on September 1943 the submarine was seized by the Japanese and given to the Germans, and commissioned into the German Navy as UIT.23. The newly UIT 23 was later sunk by the HMS Tally-ho. Roberto Rossellini's movie, The Man with a Cross, released in 1943, was loosely based on Reginaldo Giuliani's life. Several Italian towns have streets or squares named after Father Reginaldo Giuliani: \n*  Chieri (Turin) \n*  Aramengo (Asti) \n*  Cameri (Novara) \n*  La Spezia \n*  Milan \n*  Cernusco sul Naviglio (Milan) \n*  Inzago (Milan) \n*  Monza \n*  Lissone (Monza and Brianza) \n*  Busto Arsizio (Varese) \n*  Saronno (Varese) \n*  Cavaria con Premezzo (Varese) \n*  Bolzano \n*  Mestre (Venice)  \n*  Padua \n*  Montagnana (Padua) \n*  Florence \n*  Latina \n*  Rome \n*  Capri (Naples) \n*  Sorrento (Naples) \n*  Canosa di Puglia (Barletta-Andria-Trani) \n*  Molochio (Reggio Calabria)"

He then went to the United States to take up a post graduate course at George Washington University, Washington D.C. in 1905. He represented the province of Zambales as an Assemblyman in the Third Philippine Legislature in 1912. He was appointed Solicitor General in 1914, a position he held until 1916. He became Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources in 1922. During the so-called Cabinet Crisis of 1923, he, together with other Cabinet Secretaries, resigned en masse over a dispute with Governor General Leonard Wood. He was the Chairman of the Philippine National Bank from 1923 to 1931 before becoming its President from 1932-1935. He was a member of the first Monetary Board of the Central Bank of the Philippines (Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas) in 1949. He devoted more than thirty years to public service occupying various other important government positions. A nephew of the philanthropist Teodoro R. Yangco, he successfully managed the latter’s various business enterprises and became Administrator of his Estate. He was married to Eluteria Pablo with whom he had six children."

  "text" : "Rick Houenipwela, more commonly known as Rick Hou, (born 8 August 1958) is a Solomon Islands politician. He has a Bachelor's decree in Accounting, and served as governor of his country's Central Bank \"for more than 15 years\" before becoming Senior Advisor to the Executive Director of the World Bank, and then going into politics. The Solomon Times described him as \"one of the key public figures in the Solomon Islands whose credibility is intact, if not enhanced, after resisting corruption and several attempts by fraudsters to bankrupt the nation during the ethnic conflict\" of the early 2000s. The magazine Islands Business named him \"Man of the Year\" for the Pacific region in 2003, at a time when he was Governor of the Central Bank. ABC Radio's Sean Dorney described him in 2011 as a critic of excessive exploitation of the country's forests, a modest man who had shown \"strength [...] over the years in standing up to those who have exploited the country. He took a courageous stand in defending the Central Bank from extortion in the face of considerable intimidation from those with the guns during the worst of the ethnic tensions\". His career in national politics began when he was elected to Parliament as the member for Small Malaita in the August 2010 general election, standing as a member of the Democratic Party. Party leader Steve Abana became Leader of the Opposition, and appointed Houenipwela Shadow Minister for Finance and the Treasury. In early April 2011, having been ousted from the leadership of the Opposition, Abana defected to Prime Minister Danny Philip's government, bringing with him several members of the Opposition, including Houenipwela. The latter was appointed Minister for Public Service. In early November 2011, several ministers joined or rejoined the Opposition, ultimately bringing down the government. On November 9, three ministers returned to the Opposition. The following day, Rick Hou joined them, and the day after that Philip sacked Finance Minister Gordon Darcy Lilo, reportedly for conspiring with the Opposition. Hours later, Philip announced his own resignation, as he clearly no longer had the numbers with which to govern. On November 16, Parliament chose Lilo to replace him. Lilo appointed Hou as his Minister for Finance. Upon his appointment, Houenipwela told the Solomon Star he would seek to exempt \"low paid workers\" from paying tax, while also \"lower[ing] the tax rates to enable companies to be profitable\". There would be increased government support and investment in \"productive sectors\", including agriculture, tourism and fisheries. In April 2015, he took a stand in Parliament against members of Parliament being exempted from paying income tax. He stated that he would refuse his own tax exemption."

He served as a garrison instructor for the South Eastern District until 1881 when he was appointed aide de camp to General Edward Newdegate in the Colony of Natal in 1881. He retired on half pay in the same year. However, he returned to the army shortly afterwards, rising to the rank of major and serving with distinction in the Suakin Expedition of 1885. In that year he retired from the army with the rank of honorary lieutenant-colonel in the Suffolk Rifle Volunteer Corps. At the 1886 general election, Lloyd-Anstruther was chosen by the Conservative Party to contest the South Eastern or Woodbridge Division of Suffolk, a constituency held by the Liberal Party member of parliament, Robert Lacey Everett. He won the seat for the Conservatives, but only served a single term in parliament, with Everett regaining the seat in 1892 general election. On his father's death in 1882, Lloyd-Anstruther had inherited Hintlesham Hall near Ipswich in Suffolk. He later entered local government as an alderman on East Suffolk County Council, and was appointed a justice of the peace and a deputy lieutenant of Suffolk. He died in 1914, survived by his wife and one son, Fitzroy Anstruther-Gough-Calthorpe, who was later created a baronet."

  "text" : "(For other people named Rhys Morgan, see Rhys Morgan (disambiguation).) Rhys Morgan (born 1994) is a consumer watchdog, science activist, and health blogger from Wales who first received acclaim in 2010 when, at the age of 15, he played a key role in raising awareness of the health risks of Miracle Mineral Supplement. Morgan brought attention to the fact that the product contained bleach and was being illegally marketed as a \"miracle\" cure, which prompted a consumer warning across the European Union and earned Morgan a James Randi Award for Grassroots Activism. In 2011, Morgan again received media attention and acclaim, this time for his commentary on treatments offered by Stanislaw Burzynski, a controversial Texas-based physician who uses substances he calls \"antineoplastons\" as part of a non-approved alternative cancer therapy regimen. Morgan's critique provoked legal and personal threats from a public relations representative of the Burzynski Clinic, which in turn precipitated a hailstorm of criticism from the media, who defended Morgan, and prompted a public apology from the Clinic.In January 2012 Morgan was censored by his school for posting a Jesus and Mo cartoon as his Facebook profile for a week, in solidarity with University College London's Atheist, Secular, and Humanist Society. The school told him to remove the cartoon from his Facebook archive, and when he refused, threatened him with expulsion. Morgan spoke at the Rally for Free Expression in London on 11 February."

  "text" : "Robert A. J. Gagnon (born July 31, 1958) is an American associate professor of the New Testament at the Pittsburgh Theological Seminary, and an elder in the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.). He holds a BA from Dartmouth and an MTS from Harvard Divinity School, as well as a PhD from the Princeton Theological Seminary. Gagnon's primary fields are Pauline theology and sexuality. In particular, Gagnon has focused on the issue of homosexuality in relation to Christianity and the Bible. Gagnon has been described as \"the foremost traditionalist interpreter\" on this topic, and has published several books and articles about the subject, such as The Bible and Homosexual Practice, which has been called \"one of the most cited works\" on the subject. Gagnon's work on homosexuality relies on both analysis of the biblical text and on arguments based on biology and gender complementarity, in which Gagnon \"comes down firmly on the conservative side of the debate.\" Gagnon's use of arguments based on \"natural law\" has been criticized by Jack Bartlett Rogers as applying a \"nonbiblical standard\" and as incorrectly claiming \"that all people who are homosexual have willfully chosen that behavior and therefore can successfully change their sexual identity,\" although Gagnon responds that this is an \"outrageous misrepresentation\" of his views. In the coauthored book Homosexuality and the Bible, Gagnon presents the conservative side of the debate on homosexuality and the church, while Dan O. Via, Professor Emeritus of New Testament at Duke Divinity School, presents the opposing view. In his paper Why the 'Weak' at Rome Cannot Be Non-Christian Jews, Gagnon disputes work by Mark D. Nanos, who argues that Paul the Apostle was a Torah-observant follower of Judaism."

He became involved in the grocery business and, with his brother Alexander, developed Jardine and Company into a significant import business. At the same time he was involved in a number of high-profile businesses and organizations in Saint John. In 1854 there was a cholera epidemic and he was president of the Saint John Water Company at the time. He established a pure water system that earned him a civic commendation. The system proved its worth for decades. Jardine was the chief commissioner of railways in New Brunswick from 1857 until 1865."

In the 1940s, he traveled through Nicaragua and the rest of Central America with his orchestra - El Champu de Carino. Audiences were delighted with his singing and the music of his orchestra. In order to defray traveling expenses, he started to advertise various products and services of different businesses during the intermissions of Champu de Carino shows. In 1950, he founded one of the first advertising agencies in the country - Publicidad Cuadra Chamberlain. It was the right idea at the right time. Nicaragua was experiencing a post World War II economic boom. In 1956, his elder brother Vicente joined the agency as general manager and the two brothers paved the way for advertising success in the country. In 1961, due to health problems, Raul stepped down to concentrate on his music. He still worked as a consultant on special projects for the agency until his death in 1974."

  "text" : "Reginald Edward Enthoven CIE (1869–1952) was an administrator in the Indian Civil Service of the British Raj and an author of publications related to India, including the three volumes entitled The Tribes and Castes of Bombay that formed a part of the Ethnographic Survey of India. Reginald Enthoven was born in Hastings, Sussex, England, on 23 November 1869, the fifth son of James and Miriam Enthoven. He attended Wellington College and then, using his family connections as a great-nephew of James Joseph Sylvester, he was able to secure a place at New College, Oxford reserved for students intending to pursue a career in the Indian Civil Service. In 1887, the same year that he matriculated at New College, he was appointed to the Indian Civil Service (ICS) upon passing the competitive examination. He arrived in India on 1 December 1889. Initially appointed in Bombay as an Assistant District collector and Assistant Magistrate, as well as an Inspector of Factories, by June 1896 Enthoven was promoted to Second Assistant. From 1900 until 1902 he served as First Assistant and Under-Secretary, being a Provincial Superintendent in Bombay for the 1901 census of India. Thereafter he was appointed to superintend the revision of the Imperial Gazetteer and was Director-General of Statistics. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Statistical Society in 1904. Enthoven was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Indian Empire on 1 January 1910, at which time he was Secretary to the Government of Bombay, General, Educational, Marine and Ecclesiastical Departments. Enthoven had contributed the General Index to the 34 volumes of the Gazetteer of the Bombay Presidency that had been compiled by Sir James M. Campbell. In his later Tribes and Castes of Bombay, Enthoven placed much reliance on the work of Campbell, which Crispin Bates has described as being \"compendious but unsystematic ethnographic researches\". Kumar Suresh Singh has noted that the survey, conducted between 1901 and 1909, suffered from a shortage of funding, relied on amateur data collectors and used content from Campbell's Gazetteer without acknowledgement, thus leading to claims of plagiarism. In retirement and living at Vale House, Wootton, Berkshire by 1935, Enthoven was an Ordinary Member of the Council of the Royal Asiatic Society and also one of its Honorary Auditors. He had been a member of the Society since 1907."

  "text" : "Rupert Theodore \"Rufus\" Naylor (14 August 1882 – 25 September 1939) was an Australian sporting entrepreneur and gambler. Naylor was born at Chippendale in Sydney to labourer Henry John Naylor and Susannah, née Phillips. He was educated at West Wyalong and left school at the age of twelve to work as a miner. By the time he was seventeen he was a licensed bookmaker, moving to the Western Australian goldfields in 1906. He travelled to South Africa in 1908 with a number of athletes and in 1909 organised a Johannesburg event between Jack Donaldson, Arthur Postle and Charles Holway; his business expanded to include a stadium and a cinema chain. From 1913 to 1917 he was in London managing African Theatres Trust Ltd. He subsequently returned to South Africa to run a weekly newspaper, Life, Sports and Drama (LSD) and expanded his business to Portuguese East Africa. He was elected to Johannesburg Municipal Council in 1919 and was acquitted of bribery accusations later that year. Naylor sojourned in India before returning to Sydney in 1925. He continued his sporting and gambling interests until 1930, when he ran a scam to sell \"shares\" in lottery tickets. Having left the industry he began publishing Racing Reflections and broadcast \"Racing Revelations\" on the radio station 2KY. He ran unsuccessfully as an independent candidate for the seat of Lang in the 1934 federal election and was banned from registered racecourses later that year having allegedly given false information to the Australian Jockey Club's committee. He successfully challenged the ruling in the Supreme Court but the Jockey Club appealed to the Privy Council to have their ban upheld. Naylor's battle against the establishment made him a minor hero among the working classes. He died at his home on Centennial Park in 1939, and left his body for research to Sydney Hospital."

Despite the possible uncomfortable reading of his poems, caused by continuous verbal Ronald Augusto experimentalism, the poet has achieved Brazilian national and global expression. Some critics, such as Régis Bonvicino, author of \"The Poetry of the Improbable Americas\", are considered Ronald one of the best Brazilian poets of later generations. His poems have been published in international literary journals such as Callaloo magazine: Brazilian African Literature: The U.S. special issue (1995), translated into English and into the German in the journal Zeitschrift für Dichtungsring Literature, among others.. Translations of his poems into Spanish can also be found on the Internet."

  "text" : "Rufus Cole (April 30, 1872 – April 20, 1966) was an American medical doctor and the first director of the Rockefeller University Hospital. Under his leadership significant advances in treatment of bacterial pneumonia and later against tuberculosis were made. In 1912 Cole and Alphonse Dochez developed a serum against Type 1 pneumococcus and also developed a method for testing whether an infection is caused by this or some other type of the bacterium. The New York Times in its obituary for Cole called him \"a pioneer in clinical medicine\" and \"an authority on lobar pneumonia\". The New York Times also wrote in the same obituary that Cole was President of Association of American Physicians in 1931, had honorary degrees from the University of Chicago and the National University of Ireland.Cole received Kober prize in 1938 for advances against tuberculosis. He is also credited by Franklin C. McLean for creating a blueprint for clinical studies."

Jenet was only about seven when her future husband held the office of Mayor, so their marriage probably did not take place until the mid 1540s. The couple had one daughter, Katherine, who was to be Jenet's only surviving child. Robert died before 1556 when Jenet married James Luttrell. She had six husbands in all, including Robert Plunkett, 5th Baron of Dunsany and the eminent judges Sir Thomas Cusack and Sir John Plunket. Although Shilyngford was the father of her only known surviving child, Jenet does not seem to have attached much importance to his memory, preferring always to be known as Lady Dunsany, under which title she was buried."

  "text" : "Robert Plunkett, 5th Baron Dunsany (died 1559) was an Anglo-Irish nobleman of the Tudor period He was the only surviving son of Edward Plunkett, 4th Baron of Dunsany and his wife Amy de Bermingham. He succeeded to the title in 1521, when his father was killed while assisting the Earl of Surrey, the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, in putting down a rebellion by the O'Connor and O'Carroll families. Robert married firstly Eleanor Darcy, daughter of Sir William Darcy of Platten. They had thirteen children, many of whom survived infancy, including: \n* John, who died before his father leaving an only daughter; \n* Christopher, 6th Baron of Dunsany; \n* Gerald, who married Catherine Eustace, daughter of Thomas Eustace, 1st Viscount Baltinglass; \n* Margaret, who married Walter Marward, Baron Skryne; \n* Elizabeth, who married Walter FitzGerald, a younger son of Gerald FitzGerald, 8th Earl of Kildare. Dunsany married secondly Jenet Sarsfield who had already buried two husbands and was to have six in all. They do not seem to have been married for more than two years when Dunsany died in March 1559; their two sons apparently died in infancy. Despite the brevity of the marriage Jenet took great pride in her rank as a baroness: she preferred in later life to be called Lady Dunsany and was buried under that title in a tomb of her own design. During the rebellion of Silken Thomas, Dunsany, whose daughter Elizabeth was married to Thomas's uncle Walter FitzGerald, (who was later executed for his part in the Rebellion) fell under suspicion of treason, and in the autumn of 1535 he was denounced to the Crown as a ringleader of the rebellion. His enemies urged that he should be attainted; but in the event Henry VIII, having virtually destroyed the FitzGerald family, including Dunsany's son-in-law Walter, was prepared to be merciful to the other nobles of the Pale, and Dunsany escaped unscathed. His later career suggests that he had regained the Crown's trust. He took his seat in the Irish House of Lords in the Parliament of 1541; he was one of the nobles who confirmed the election of Sir Francis Bryan as Governor of Ireland in 1549; and in 1557 he accompanied the Lord Deputy, Sussex, on an expedition against the McDonnells of Ulster."

His parents made guest appearances in local variety shows. At age 4, he made his first public appearance. He studied with Kurt Weill. His younger brother, Ferry Gebhardt, a student of Edwin Fischer, was a concert pianist and later professor of piano at the Hochschule für Musik und Theater Hamburg. Gebhardt wrote jazz pieces, pop songs, and a jazz piano concerto. By 1928, he was a member of the EKLA (First Piano Quartet) with Adam Gelbtrunk, Leopold Mittmann, and Alexander Zakin. In 1937, he became the music supervisor for the first German language television play, Kabinett Fulero. The German Broadcasting Archive has a recording of jazz-piano concert with Rudolf Ehrecke at the piano and Gebhardt conducting the orchestra. He also conducted an orchestra at the Folies Bergère in Paris, France. On June 24, 1944, Gebhardt died on the eastern front during World War II. An exhibition marking the 50th anniversary of his death (with catalog) documents his career."

  "text" : "Richard Morrison (born September 1953) is an English designer of film title sequences. He has created over 150 feature film title sequences in a career of more than thirty years. Having studied graphics, photography and film, Morrison’s initial career began on the James Bond film series collaborating with an American graphic designer Maurice Binder. He has worked on film openers ever since for film directors including Franc Roddam, Ridley Scott and Jean-Jacques Annaud. His title sequences include films such as Batman, Enemy at the Gates, Gandhi, Brazil and The Killing Fields. Describing his work in an interview with Empire (August 2008) Morrison explained: \"I look for a nuance, a subliminal energy in a film that I can then work into an idea. A lot of my title sequences don’t give much away, but they give you a flavour. So the viewer thinks - Oh, this is intriguing, show me more…\" Morrison has been chairman of Europe’s film and animation conference “Pencil to Pixel” since 2002, and in 2009 he was appointed Honorary Professor of Digital Film School of Media Arts and Imaging at the University of Dundee, Scotland. Morrison is currently developing a few film title sequences including Tim Burton's Frankenweenie and Dark Shadows as well as David Mamet's currently untitled biopic on Phil Spector."

He was contacted by Han Song Ryol, the North Korean deputy ambassador to the United Nations. Egan and Han established a relationship, including fishing trips and meals at Egan's barbecue restaurant \"Cubby's\" in Hackensack, New Jersey, in order to provide a diplomatic and commercial back channel in the United States where national diplomacy continuously failed. His efforts have been dubbed \"barbecue diplomacy\". He co-wrote Eating With the Enemy with Kurt Pitzer; the book was published in 2010. The Daily Beast has reported that HBO may be making a movie based on the book, possibly produced by Robert De Niro, where Egan would have been played by James Gandolfini."

  "text" : "Ralph Stein (1909–1994) was a writer, cartoonist and illustrator. Ralph Stein was born in New York City in 1909. He began his career as a photographer and illustrator at The World-Telegram. During World War II he was the staff cartoon editor for the U.S. Army magazine \"Yank\". During that time he was co-author, with Harry Brown, of \"It's a Cinch, Private Finch,\" a humorous book about Army life, and many of his cartoons from \"Yank\" were compiled into a book called \"What Am I Laughing At?\". From 1953 to 1959, he helped draw and write the \"Popeye\" comic strip and illustrated \"Here's How\" for King Features. Stein's first daily \"Popeye\" strip was published in December 1954 and his last in August 1959. Stein's stories used very little of Popeye's supporting players, and instead took the sailor all over the world. He also returned Bluto to the daily strip beginning in 1957. Later Stein created Bluto's beard-less 'twin brother\", Burlo. Stein was the author of several books about cars, including Sports Cars of the World (1952), Treasury of the Automobile (1961), The American Automobile (1978) and The Great Cars (1967). Other books by Ralph Stein include The Pinup From 1852 to Now and The Great Inventions. Stein died in 1994 at the Saybrook Convalescent Hospital in Old Saybrook, Conn at age 85 after a long illness. He had lived in Connecticut for many years."

  "text" : "Raymond O'Neil was a European trained American theater director. He was the critic of drama and music at The Cleveland Leader newspaper (now The Plain Dealer). To explore more innovative theatrical ideas than what was available in Cleveland at the time, O'Neil traveled to Europe to study newer forms of theatrical expression, including at the Moscow Art Theatre and the work of Max Reinhardt. After returning to Cleveland, O'Neil and his friend Henry Keller began experimenting with new theatrical techniques involving puppets, cardboard, shadows and light. The popularity of O'Neil and his shadow plays led him to become he first art director at the Cleveland Play House in 1915. However, he was not a theatre manager nor was he interested in the operation of a professional theatre company. A dreamer at heart, O'Neil resigned from the Play House in 1921 to pursue other opportunities in live theatre. Following his resignation at the Play House, O'Neil formed a company of professional black actors in Chicago. He was inspired from seeing, \"African American nightclub performers in Chicago.\" O'Neil persuaded several of the Lafayette Players [another little-theatre group out of New York originally called the Anita Bush Stock Company formed by Anita Bush (1883–1974)] to join him by promising them roles that were not previously available. Under O'Neil's direction the performers received, over a twelve-month period, extensive artistic training much like many European theatrical groups at the time. Raymond O'Neil was, \" interest[ed] in the work of [Edward] Gordon Craig and other modernists and in the experimental techniques and motives of the Moscow Art Theatre.\" \"He sought, not to train [the actors] in imitation of the more inhibited white actors, but to develop their particular racial characteristics-freshness and vigor of their emotional responses, their spontaneity and intense mood, their freedom from intellectual and artistic obsessions.\" He was interested in \"experimenting with the Negro art form in the commercial theatre\", and \"establishing a national black theatre company."

Examples of these schemes are Queen's Park Estate and Noel Park. Plumbe also redesigned Woodlands Park House, now Woodlands Park Hotel, in Cobham for industrialist William Bryant; and designed the entertainment hall (completed 1879) at the Normansfield home for people with a learning disability in Teddington, built at the instigation of John Langdon Down. After leaving university college he was articled to Nockalls Johnson Cottingham and Frederick Peek, then spent 2 years in America with Frederick Clarke Withers. Plumbe returned to London in 1860 to start his own practice. His churches include the red-brick Perpendicular Gothic Revival St John the Baptist's Church at Loxwood, West Sussex. His students include Charles Worley, who was articled to him in 1870."

  "text" : "Randell Ernest \"Randy\" Phillips (born August 30, 1950) is a retired politician from the U.S. state of Alaska. Phillips served for twenty-six years as a Republican member of the Alaska House of Representatives and the Alaska Senate, from 1977 to 2003. Randy Phillips was born in Seattle, Washington, on August 30, 1950. He came to Alaska with his family in 1956. He received a B.A. from Alaska Methodist University in 1973. He established residency in Eagle River, along the Glenn Highway north of Anchorage. Phillips worked as a legislative aide in the 9th Alaska State Legislature before running for the House himself in 1976. He was elected to the four-member 8th District, which stretched from the Anchorage neighborhoods Mountain View and Muldoon, out the Glenn Highway to Eagle River, Chugiak and Eklutna. In his first term in the 10th Alaska State Legislature, Phillips was named Outstanding Freshman Legislator. In his second term, he was the second-youngest member of the House by only one day, being born the day after Ray Metcalfe. He served in the House until 1993; following redistricting during the 1980s, he represented the two-member 15th District, which pared his constituency down to the Chugiak and Eagle River areas. His tenure in the Alaska Senate lasted from 1993 to 2003. He said his decision to retire from the legislature was prompted by redistricting that drastically altered his district. The redistricting in question placed Phillips in District P, which reached from the eastern and southern portions of Eagle River to northeast and south Anchorage, Whittier and the northeastern Kenai Peninsula, mostly connecting through Chugach State Park. Phillips would have had to run against south Anchorage representative Con Bunde (who did win the seat and served until his retirement in 2011) in a district largely removed from his traditional constituency. From 1987 to 1991, Phillips was tied with fellow 15th District representative Sam Cotten as the senior member of the House. Cotten was elected to the Senate in 1990, which left Phillips as the senior member in his final term. Following the 1994 reelection defeat of Jalmar M. Kerttula, Phillips was tied with Tim Kelly from 1995 to 2001 as the senior member of the legislature. Kelly was also first elected to the House from the 8th District in 1976. Kelly's retirement left Phillips as the senior member of the legislature in his final two years in office. In the overall history of the Alaska Legislature, Phillips is the third-longest-serving member; if the territorial legislature is excluded, Phillips is second behind Kerttula. At the conclusion of the 27th Alaska State Legislature, his length of service will be tied by both Johnny Ellis and Lyman Hoffman; the former was the same age as Phillips when he was first elected to the legislature. His papers are held at the Consortium Library of the University of Alaska Anchorage and Alaska Pacific University, the latter the lineal descendant of his alma mater AMU."

His paternal grandfather was Opisso and Josep Roig, a journalist and director of Diari de Tarragona, father of Antonia writers also Opisso and Vine and Antoni Opisso and Vina. His maternal great-grandfather was the painter Pere Pau Mountain, his maternal grandfather Felipe Jacinto Room fabulist and his maternal uncle, the painter Emilio Sala and French. His nephew was Arturo Llorens and Opisso, a writer better known under his pseudonym Arturo Llopis. Although born in Tarragona, his family moved to Barcelona when Opisso had only two years old. In the modernist Barcelona of late nineteenth century, Opisso worked as an assistant Antonio Gaudíen the works of the Holy Family of Barcelonadesde 1892. was linked to the group Els Quatre Gats, along with Ramon Casas, Manuel Hugué, Isidre Nonell and Pablo Picasso, among others. Later he worked as an illustrator for publications such as ¡Cu-Cut! since 1903) and L'Esquella of Torratxa (from 1912), signing oriented political satire, which are graphically related art nouveau drawings. Because of the dictatorship of Miguel Primo de Rivera, Opisso leaves the political satire and drawings approach the custom themes, specializing in popular scenes. His drawings from this period are characterized by motley crowds in Barcelona's popular scenarios. From this period dates his best known works for the magazine TBO dehistorieta (which had begun working in 1919), where he specialized in performing covers. He collaborated with many other publications, as in Patufet, Pocholo, etc. After the war, the paintings of Opisso triumphed in the galleries of Barcelona. In 1953 he received recognition from their hometown in the Fourth Art Fair Tarragona. Legacy Recently there have been several exhibitions of his drawings. Opisso Museum Astoria Hotel in Barcelona is shown continuously since late 2007 on the ground floor (lobby and cafeteria) a collection of more than 200 illustrations Opisso. The drawings and posters come from the private collection of Jordi Clos, president of the hotel chain owner (Derby Hotels Collection)."

  "text" : "Robert F. Murphy is the Ray and Stephanie Lane Professor of Computational Biology and head of the Computational Biology Department at Carnegie Mellon University, as well as Professor of Biological Sciences, Biomedical Engineering, and Machine Learning. He as founding Director (with Jelena Kovacevic) of the Center for Bioimage Informatics at Carnegie Mellon. He also founded (with Ivet Bahar) the Joint CMU-Pitt Ph.D. Program in Computational Biology. Prior to arriving at Carnegie Mellon, Dr. Murphy was a Damon Runyon Cancer Research Foundation postdoctoral fellow with Dr. Charles R. Cantor at Columbia University from 1979 through 1983. Dr. Murphy earned an A. B. in Biochemistry from Columbia College in 1974 and a Ph.D. in Biochemistry from the California Institute of Technology in 1980. He received a Presidential Young Investigator Award from the National Science Foundation shortly after joining the faculty at Carnegie Mellon in 1983. In 2005, NIH selected him as the first full-term chair of its new Biodata Management and Analysis Study Section. In 2006, he was named a Fellow of the American Institute for Medical and Biological Engineering. Dr. Murphy has received research grants from the National Institutes of Health, the National Science Foundation, the American Cancer Society, the American Heart Association, the Arthritis Foundation, and the Rockefeller Brothers Fund. He has co-edited two books and two special journal issues on “Cell and Molecular Imaging,” and published over 200 research papers. He served as President-elect of the International Society for the Advancement of Cytometry, was named as the first External Senior Fellow of the School of Life Sciences in the Freiburg (Germany) Institute for Advanced Studies, and has been named as an Honorary Professor at the University of Freiburg. He was a member of the National Advisory General Medical Sciences Council and the National Institutes of Health Council of Councils. Dr. Murphy’s career has centered on combining fluorescence-based cell measurement methods with quantitative and computational methods. He and his collaborators did extensive work on the application of flow cytometry to analyze endocytic membrane traffic beginning in the early 1980s and pioneered the application of machine learning methods to high-resolution fluorescence microscope images depicting subcellular location patterns in the mid-1990s. This work led to the development of the first systems for automatically recognizing all major organelle patterns in 2D and 3D images. He founded and coleads the CellOrganizer project for learning generative models of cell organization directly from microscope images. He also leads the image analysis and modeling efforts for the National Center for Multiscale Modeling of Biological Systems. Dr. Murphy’s leadership experience includes developing the first formal undergraduate program in computational biology in 1987 and founding the Merck Computational Biology and Chemistry program at Carnegie Mellon in 1999. These programs were important forerunners to the 2005 establishment of the Ph.D. program in computational biology in partnership with the University of Pittsburgh. Under his leadership, this program was chosen as one of only ten awardees by the new HHMI-NIBIB Interfaces Initiative."

  "text" : "Ric Sayre (b. Akron, Ohio, August 9, 1953 – d. Ashland, Oregon, June 21, 2011) was a nationally renowned American runner, best known for his ability to compete at the elite level in numerous marathons each year. Sayre’s most noted achievement was winning the inaugural Los Angeles Marathon in 1986 with a career-best time of 2 hours, 12 minutes, and 59 seconds. The next year, in 1987, Sayre won the United States national marathon championship. He was also one of only four American men who have qualified in the marathon for the U.S. Olympic Trials five times. Sayre also excelled as a trail runner. Sayre routinely competed in seven to eight marathons a year; of the fifty he competed in during his career, he won a dozen. Sayre, who was a lean 135 pounds, at five feet, ten and a half inches, credited his vegetarian diet with helping him recover quickly from races. \"Most (marathoners) run in one or two marathons a year,\" Sayre said. \"They'll run once in the spring and once in the fall. They say that it takes you a day for each mile you run to recover. \"But it takes me four days to a week to recover. I think part of it has to do with my diet and part has to do with psychology.\" He finished seventh overall in the 1987 Houston Marathon, which served as the U.S. marathon Championship. As the first American finisher in Houston, he qualified for that year's Pan American Games in Indianapolis, Indiana. Sayre developed as an athlete as a member of the Summit Athletic Club in Akron, Ohio."

  "text" : "Robert Le Vigan (7 January 1900 – 12 October 1972) was a French actor. Born Robert-Charles-Alexandre Coquillaud in Paris, he appeared in more than 60 films between 1931 and 1943 almost exclusively in small or supporting roles. He was, according to film academic Ginette Vincendeau, a \"brilliant, extravagant actor\" who \"specialised in louche, menacing or diabolical characters\". A collaborator with the Nazis during the occupation, who openly expressed fascist attitudes, he vanished while playing Jéricho in Children of Paradise (Les Enfants du Paradis), a film deliberately released in May 1945 shortly after the liberation of Europe; Le Vigan was replaced by Pierre Renoir. He was sentenced to forced labour for ten years in 1946. Released on parole after three years working in a camp, Le Vigan absconded to Spain, and then Argentina, dying there October 12, 1972, in the city of Tandil. He died in poverty."

  "text" : "Ray Price (June 25, 1937 – December 16, 2015) was an American motorcycle drag racer and is credited as the “Father of the Funnybike\". He was also a renowned designer, engineer and the first drag racer to be sponsored by Harley-Davidson. He also developed the first wheelie bar, and the two-speed automatic racing transmission for drag racing motorcycles. This was the first transmission that enabled the first motorcycle to ever achieve 200 miles per hour (320 km/h) and has now become standard in the sport. Price also created the Pro Fuel drag racing class. Price is an inducted member of five halls of fame including the American Motorcycle Association Hall of Fame, Sturgis Motorcycle Hall of Fame, the North Carolina Sport Hall of Fame, and the North Carolina Drag Racing Hall of Fame. Price was born on a tobacco farm in Johnston County, North Carolina. He served four years as a radar specialist in aircraft armament control in the United States Air Force. At age 30 he purchased his first motorcycle and began his drag racing career three years later. Price continued his drag racing career through the 2003 All Harley Drag Racing Association season. Through the years Price and his race team amassed numerous wins, records, and championships in AMA ProStar/AMA Dragbike, All Harley Drag Racing Association, and the International Hot Rod Association. Price opened Precision Cycle in Raleigh, North Carolina in 1973, and in 1981 he acquired the Harley-Davidson franchise and his store became Ray Price Harley-Davidson. Price's dealership is one of the largest in the southeastern United States and is home to the Legends of Harley Drag Racing Museum on the 2nd floor of the dealership overlooking the showroom, the only museum of its kind. He died on December 16, 2015, aged 78."

He was the author of over 28 papers, and received 45 patents. He designed radio devices for controlling aircraft, which were used in the development of the first drones. He was one of the first to appreciate the possibility of using nuclear power for submarine propulsion. During World War II he was involved in the development of thermal diffusion technology for isotope separation. After the war Gunn became director of the Weather Bureau's Physical Research Division, where he carried out a series of studies into atmospheric phenomena. In 1958 he became a professor of physics at American University, a position he held until his death in 1966."

  "text" : "Roger de Valognes was an Anglo-Norman nobleman who held lands around Benington in Hertfordshire. Roger was the son of Peter de Valognes. Peter was a tenant-in-chief in Domesday Book with lands in East Anglia. Roger married Agnes, a sister of Pain fitzJohn and daughter of John fitzRichard. Agnes and Roger had five sons – Peter, Robert, Geoffrey, Roger and Philip. Besides his children, Roger had a brother William, and two sisters. Roger succeeded to his father's estates near Bennington after 1109, the lands which is generally considered to be a barony. He appears on documents connected with Stephen's first Easter court held in 1136, where Roger is listed along with the other barons supporting Stephen's succession to the throne. Roger issued a confirmation charter to Binham Priory, founded by his father, that is slightly unusual in that it mentions a \"decree that where there is no son the daughters divide their father's land by the spindles, nor can the elder take from the younger half of the inheritance by violence or injury\". This charter was discussed by William Stubbs, who dated the charter to shortly before 1141. Later historians have attempted to discover which king issued the decree, with general consensus deciding on King Henry I of England. The historian Pauline Stafford has related this decree to Henry's attempts to have his daughter Matilda succeed him on the throne of England, and sees this charter as recording this important step taken by the king towards that goal. A further unusual feature of this charter is that it mentions the negotiations that took place prior to the issuing of the charter, in this case, where Theobald of Bec persuaded Roger to be more generous than he had originally intended with the grant. Roger died around 1141 or 1142. His heir to his lands was first his eldest son Robert, who died without children in 1158. The lands then passed to Roger's second son Robert. The third son, Philip de Valognes, became the first hereditary chamberlain of Scotland, an office that remained in his family."

  "text" : "Raoul Paoli (24 November 1887 – 23 March 1960) was a French athlete, boxer, rower and actor. Aged 12, he served as a coxswain in the French coxed pair and won a bronze medal at the 1900 Summer Olympics. He competed in the shot put, his favourite event, at the 1912, 1920, 1924 and 1928 Summer Olympics with the best result of ninth place in 1924. In 1912 he also took part in the Greco-Roman wrestling contest and served as the Olympic flag bearer for France, and in 1928 he finished 29th in the discus throw. Paoli was a French champion in boxing and rugby, with Stade Français. He played three international rugby games for the French national team in 1911–12 and scored one try. In the 1920s he was romantically involved with the fellow athlete Violette Morris. In 1933 he co-founded the French Professional Wrestling Association."

In 1653, he commanded the 4th Rate Sussex (46 guns) and fought at the Battle of Portland. At the Battle of the Gabbard, he was in Samuel Howett’s division. He was also likely at the Battle of Scheveningen. Cuttance sailed on the Tunis expedition in 1655, then commanded the 3rd Rate Langport. From 1656 to 1657 and again from 1659 to 1660, he commanded the 1st Rate Naseby, upon which Samuel Pepys sailed. He was flag captain for Edward Montagu, Earl of Sandwich, from 1660-5 on the Naseby (later Royal Charles), then Royal James. At the Battle of Lowestoft, 13 June 1665 (the worst naval defeat in Dutch history), he commanded the 1st Rate Royal Prince (86 guns). When he was knighted on 1 July, according to Samuel Pepys it was on \"board of the Prince, a vessel of 90 brasse ordnance (most whole canon) & happly the best ship in the world both for building & sailing: she had 700 men... after dinner came his Majestie (King Charles II) & the Duke & Prince Rupert: & here I saw him knight Capt Cuttance, for behaving himselfe so bravely in the late fight.\" However, because Sir Roger Cuttance had been implicated, along with William Penn and the Earl of Sandwich, in the looting of the Indian prize (the Prize Goods Scandal), he was excluded from further command at sea shortly thereafter. Sir Roger Cuttance died in 1669. His son, Henry Cuttance, was also by then a prominent naval officer."

  "text" : "Raffaello Magiotti (1597 – 1656) was an Italian astronomer, mathematician and physicist. Born at Montevarchi, he studied at Florence, and, having taken his vows, moved to Rome, following Cardinal Sacchetti. In 1636, he began to work at the Vatican Library.A pupil of Castelli in Rome, in 1638 he was Castelli's tip to Galileo as the candidate for the chair of Mathematics at Pisa. Well at home in the scientific community in the Papal city, Magiotti actively participated in Roman scientific debates, on which he provided detailed information to Galileo, with whom he was often in touch. During his life, Magiotti published only one work, entitled Renitenza dell’acqua alla compressione (Water's Resistance to Compression), which came out in 1648. The text was the first report of the practical resistance to compression - which Magiotti mistakenly claimed to be absolute - of water at constant temperature, as well as the expansion and contraction of fluid media (water and air) subjected to changes in temperature. In addition to descriptions of various thermometers, the work also presents an illustration of the bell-jar divers, or \"Cartesian devils\", the discovery of which would then be attributed to the Tuscan scientist. Magiotti played a role in the context of experimentation which preceded, and to a large extent, prepared the way, for the torricellian barometric experiments. He assisted - giving full descriptions in various letters - in the syphon experiments performed by Gasparo Berti around 1640. In a letter to Mersenne from 1648, he recalled that happy experimental period, and revealed that he had told Torricelli about the tests performed by Berti. He also suggested the use of sea-water, which is more dense than fresh water, thus making possible the decisive choice of mercury in barometric experiments. He died of the plague in 1656."

He became a gentleman of the bedchamber in 1626. He was re-elected MP for Northampton in 1626 and 1628 and sat until 1629 when King Charles decided to rule without parliament for eleven years. Spencer married Mary Sandys, daughter of Sir Edwin Sandys of Northbourne, Kent in 1628. They settled at Orpington, Kent, and had four sons and two daughters. He was a J.P. for Kent by 1636. Spencer stood for parliament for Kent for the Long Parliament in November 1640, but withdrew before the election took place. He was imprisoned twice by the Long Parliament for promoting the moderate Kentish petition of 1642. He was a commissioner of array for the King in 1642, stood security for loans amounting to £60,000 and helped to raise two regiments of horse, which he commanded at the Battle of Edgehill. He gave up his command in 1643 and was claimed the benefit of the Oxford Articles. He settled £40 a year on the minister of Orpington and was allowed to compound for a mere £300. However he became involved in the canal schemes of William Sandys and his financial condition became precarious. In 1651 he obtained a pass to France for himself and his family and settled in Brussels. He returned to England in about 1653 and was imprisoned and forced to pay off his debts. At the Restoration Spencer petitioned unsuccessfully for positions which had been promised to him in reversion many years earlier. These included Provost of Eton and vice-treasurer of Ireland. He became JP and Deputy Lieutenant for Kent and commissioner for oyer and terminer on Home circuit in July 1660. By August 1660 he was colonel of militia for Kent. He became commissioner for assessment in August 1660, and commissioner for sewers in North Kent in September 1660. He was nominated by the Duke of York as court candidate for Rye in 1661 and elected to the Cavalier Parliament for the constituency, taking his seat having been absent from the Commons for 32 years. Spencer died later in 1661 at the age of 68 and was buried at Orpington."

The Forensic Audit of the Nanaimo Commonwealth Holding Society revealed that Williams received $80,000, 4 years pay for an MLA at the time, from the NCHS. NDP MP and MLA David Stupich was convicted for taking that money away from Nanaimo Charities, using a small part to pay Williams, and passing some of it along to the NDP and to Unions such as the IWA.

He was cofferer and comptroller of the wardrobe (1309–1318), before being promoted a baron of the exchequer (until 1323). After another brief spell as comptroller (and Keeper of the Privy Seal) he was appointed in 1323 keeper of the wardrobe (until 1328). He was then Treasurer (1329-1330), Chancellor of the Exchequer (1330–1331) and Treasurer again in 1338. In December 1338 he was dismissed by Edward III for unsatisfactory service, bringing his government career to an end. However, during his long career he had been well rewarded with a number of church benefices and in 1328 being appointed Archdeacon of Richmond, Yorkshire.

His second book Gugu's band, which he wrote in 1986 is an autobiography which portraits himself as a child at a boarding school in France. He wrote his third book Anarki till Vardags (Everyday Anarchy), together with Thomas Hallon Hallberg in 1987. This is a political book which has been used in Swedish schools for educational purposes. Roland had a keen interest for languages which can be seen in his books, where he playfully experiments continuously with the Swedish language. Many Catalan, French and Spanish phrases can also be found in his books. He is famous for his energetic and inspiring live readings of his books and has made appearances in front of large audiences including readings of his books at the famous Swedish festival of Hultsfred 1987 and 1988.

Rallier du Baty took part in the 1904-1907 Third French Antarctic Expedition led by Jean-Baptiste Charcot. He subsequently returned to the subantarctic with his brother Henri, charting the Kerguelen islands in 1908-1909 aboard the J. B. Charcot, subsidising their work by harvesting the southern elephant seals there for their oil. They returned again in 1913-1914 in La Curieuse to carry out further surveys. These efforts led to the publication of the first full map of the archipelago in 1922. Rallier du Baty is commemorated in several geographic features, including Péninsule Rallier du Baty in the Kerguelen Archipelago, and Rallier Island and Rallier Channel in the Wilhelm Archipelago of the Antarctic Peninsula."

DADT had banned the service of openly gay members in the United States Armed Forces and Phillips used YouTube, under the alias \"AreYouSuprised\", to anonymously seek support and to document his life under the policy over several months. His videos included his coming out to his father and mother, which coincided with Phillips showing his face for the first time, and the accidental discovery of his anonymous web presence by his co-workers. There was a wave of video postings when the military anti-homosexual policy ended, with many pointing to Phillips as their model or inspiration. The timing of his revelations to his family at the end of the military's restrictions on service by homosexuals made him, in one journalist's estimation, \"the poster boy for the DADT repeal.\" Another wrote: \"Phillips has masterfully used social media and good timing to place himself at the centre of a civil rights success story.\""

  "text" : "Roger Scott Craig is an Irish musician who started his career with The Merseybeats in the early 1970s, along with members, Tony Crane, Derek Cashin, and Tony Coates.They later left \"Tony Crane and The Merseybeats\", to form a band called Liverpool Express, with musician, Billy Kinsley. Liverpool Express experienced chart success with \"You Are My Love\", mentioned by Paul McCartney as one of his favourite love songs, plus \"Everyman Must Have A Dream\", \"Dreamin\", \"Hold Tight\", and \"Smile\". They toured the UK and Europe supporting Rod Stewart, released more singles, and were successful in South America (they were the first band to play large stadiums in Brazil). They later played at the Royal Gala Performance at the request of Prince Charles, at the Empire Theatre in Liverpool. After three albums, they had no further chart success. Craig left Liverpool behind in 1981 to settle in California. He joined the band Fortune, and they recorded one album in the mid-eighties. During this period he joined Nina Hagen's band, and appeared on her album, In Ekstase. They toured Europe and South America and played to hundreds of thousands of people at the Rock in Rio concert in Brazil. He, along with Larry Greene formed the band Harlan Cage in the mid-nineties, and they recorded and released successful albums right into the 2000s until a 'Best of' album was commissioned. Roger formed the side-band, 101 South, in 2000 and they recorded three albums together. In 2002, it was Craig's idea to release a greatest hits compilation album for his old band, Liverpool Express. The album was successful and a reunion concert in Liverpool soon followed. Roger met with Billy Kinsley to write an album of brand new Liverpool Express material. The album was eventually released and named 'Once Upon A Time' in 2003. Craig is also a composer of movies and many successful TV commercials."

  "text" : "Rudolf Kaufmann (3 April 1909 – c. 1941), son of the physicist Walter Kaufmann, was a palaeontologist and geologist, and is best remembered for his work on allopatric speciation and punctuated equilibrium in the trilobite genus Olenus in the Upper Cambrian of Sweden and on the island of Bornholm.  He was a brother-in-law of Curt Teichert the well-known German-American palaeontologist and geologist. Studying the Upper Cambrian alum shales in Sweden, Kaufmann found that the trilobite genus Olenus occurred in an unbroken sequence of sediments covering a considerable period of geological time. He was thereby in a position to track the phylogenetic evolution of Olenus, that is, the rise and fall of species within the genus and the changes in their morphology. He coined the idea of Artabwandlung, which is the tendency of clade elements in the same environment to show the same morphological trends. With the 1930s onset of the Nazi regime in Germany, Kaufmann, who had Jewish roots, but had been baptised an evangelical Christian, was dismissed from his position at Greifswald University. He had studied at Königsberg and at Greifswald University under Serge von Bubnoff (1888–1957). His 1933 dissertation dealt with speciation and punctuated equilibrium in Cambrian trilobites in Skåne. He left Germany for Copenhagen in 1933. Here he was denied employment as a geologist, and worked as a photographer and gave instruction in athletics. He found himself ill at ease in Denmark, and after a spell in Italy, returned to Germany where in October 1935 he started teaching at a Jewish school in Coburg, and was arrested on a charge of 'miscegenation' (he was being treated for a sexually transmitted disease acquired from a prostitute) and in 1936 sentenced to 3 years of hard labour. On his release in 1939 Kaufmann fled to Lithuania, where he was allowed to settle and resume geological work. When Lithuania became part of the U.S.S.R. in 1940 he joined the staff of the Geological Survey at Kaunas, immersing himself in the problems of Pleistocene drift, and marrying a fellow refugee. After the German occupation of Lithuania in 1941, and now an undesirable Jew, he was identified while cycling on a country road and executed by two German soldiers. Earlier, in his search for work, he had moved to Italy and found work in a photographic shop in Bologna. There, in the summer of 1935 he met Ingeborg Magnusson, a 28-year-old Swedish woman on holiday. This relationship was to last five years, during which period they spent 13 days together - he visited her once in Stockholm, and she saw him once in Germany. These details came to light in 1991 when a German stamp collector bought a package of 30 letters, written by Kaufmann to Ingeborg, at a Frankfurt stamp auction."

  "text" : "Richard Bingham Sheridan (1 August 1822 – 8 June 1897), was a Queensland public servant, liberal-oriented Member of the Legislative Assembly of Queensland and government minister (minister without portfolio 1883-85 and later Post Master General in 1885). Sheridan was born at Castlebar, County Mayo Ireland, the son of Henry S. Sheridan and his wife Margaret, née Martin. He arrived in New South Wales in 1842 and was initially employed near Twofold Bay, where he had the experience of being, on his own account, 'one of the first white men ever seen among the wild tribes'. Subsequently, he was until 1844 employed as a property manager for Captain William Oldrey of Broulee. He married on 18 November 1845, in Sydney, to Adele Eulalie Masse, a native of Mauritius. Sheridan retired to Brisbane but moved to Sydney in 1897, where he died at Manly on 8 June and was buried in Waverley cemetery in accordance with his Catholic faith. Sheridan subsequently joined the Customs Department in Sydney in February 1846 but his illness made him be eventually transferred to Moreton Bay (Brisbane) in February 1853, where on 31 May, he became a member of the Steam Navigation Board. He later moved north to take op position as a sub-collector of customs at Maryborough on 10 December 1859 and subsequently as a Water Police Magistrate and Immigration Agent. He thus held several key positions in the Wide Bay and Maryborough area in the period from 1859 to his retirement in about 1890. Sheridan was also a trustee and a member of the board of management of the Brisbane Botanic Gardens. Sheridan was respected for his integrity and deep sense of fairness and humanity, and as such, he remained throughout his life a true pioneer of compassion in regards to the rights of Aboriginal people and always keenly alert to the shady sides of the infamous Melanesian labour trade. He thus protested in public against the Native Police system he would later raise his voice in defence of the rights of Melanesian labourers. In November 1873, he strongly criticised Maryborough hospital for refusing the treatment to a dying Aboriginal."

  "text" : "Robert G. Gillespie (1903 – January 31, 1983) was an FBI agent who participated in the capture of bank robber John Dillinger, and who later became a justice of the Mississippi Supreme Court. Born in Madison, Alabama, Gillespie was raised in Mississippi. He briefly attended the University of Alabama Law School, but was unable to afford the program, instead dropping out and reading law to be admitted to practice in Mississippi, in 1927. He spent less than a year in the FBI, from 1934–1935, but during that time he participated in the ambush leading to the death of infamous bank robber John Dillinger. He left the FBI after contracting tuberculosis, from which he recuperated in Mississippi. Gillespie practised law in Meridian, Mississippi with Thomas L. Bailey, and was appointed to the Mississippi Supreme Court in 1954, by Governor Hugh L. White. He became Chief Justice in 1971, holding that office until his retirement from the court on August 1, 1977. After his retirement from the court, he taught at the Mississippi College School of Law until 1981."

This paper was read at the Newcastle upon Tyne meeting of the British Association (Sub-section D), and printed in the Transactions of the Tyneside Naturalists Club, 1863-4, vol. VI, p. 200. It was also read at the British Association for the Advancement of Science, Annual Meeting held at Newcastle upon Tyne, August 1863, and reviewed at length in the British Medical Journal for 19 September 1863. It was an important paper, historically. It describes working and living conditions and practices and gives a brief insight into the structures of the mining industry at the time. It has been cited as evidence for the incidence of barrel chest. It has also been cited as evidence of a change in attitudes to the amelioration of the conditions in the mining community, after about 1850."

  "text" : "Reverter I de La Guardia (?-1142 or 1144), viscount of Barcelona, was a Catalan adventurer and military leader who defended the Almoravid caliphate in North Africa against the Almohad onslaught. He was the son of Guislabert II, viscount of Barcelona, a title, which at that time, had lost much of its prestige. He married a woman known as Ermesindis and had several sons with her. During his long absence from the county, his nephew, Guillem, appear to have ruled in his name over his estates. As a feudatory of the count of Barcelona, he is believed to have been captured by the Almoravids during a battle along the Ebro river in the 1120s, probably 1126. He remained a prisoner of war in North Africa for about a decade until the emergence of the Almohad threat in the Maghrib al-Aqsa induced the emir, Ali ibn Yusuf, to levy a troop of mercenaries among the captive Spanish soldiers (c.1132). Reverter accepted to lead this force, with the express permission of the count of Barcelona. Reveter and his Christian mercenaries appear to have been very successful at stemming the advance of the Almohads for several years. The Catalan knight may even have been entrusted with the command of the entire Almoravid army but he was killed in battle in 1142 or 1144, possibly near Tlemcen, and his corpse was crucified by the Zenatas. After his death, the Almoravid emirate crumbled rapidly. Two of his sons seem to have fought alongside Reverter in the armies of the caliph. Berenguer became the new viscount at the death of his father and returned in Spain and Abu-l-Hasan who took the command of the Christian contingent before converting to Islam. The life of Reverter illustrates two important trends of the period: the expansionist policies of the counts of Barcelona over the Western Mediterranean and the tendency of medieval warriors to easily cross religious lines to find employment."

Iharaira Te Houkamau opposed his appointment because he considered it an insult to his dignity to have a Māori deacon whose people he looked upon as bitter enemies. However Te Houkamau eventually accepted Waitoa and Te Houkamau offered himself as a candidate for baptism. Waitoa was at Te Kawakawa in 1860. Waitoa died in 1866 and was buried at St. Stephen's cemetery, Judges Bay, Auckland."

  "text" : "Rutherford Waddell (1850–1932) was a notable New Zealand presbyterian minister, social reformer and writer. He was born in Ballyroney, County Down, Ireland in about 1850. Waddell migrated to New Zealand in 1877, settling in Dunedin where he led St. Andrew's Church from 1879. An active believer in the value of the ministry to promote social justice, he was a founder in 1888 of the Dunedin and Suburban Reserves Conservation Society, and aided the setting up a mission hall, savings bank, free library and free kindergarten within his parish, as well as promoting the founding of a variety of cultural and sporting groups. Waddell's most notable accomplishment in early New Zealand, however, was his crusade against sweat shops. In October 1888, his sermon \"On the sin of cheapness\", stirred many of the local community into action, and the cause was taken up by Sir George Fenwick, editor of the Otago Daily Times, and the paper's chief reporter Silas Spragg. In 1890 a royal commission on sweating was established, and formed the basis of many of the country's social reforms of the following decade. Waddell was a believer in the value of trade unions, and became the first president of the Tailoresses' Union of New Zealand in July 1889."

  "text" : "Ralph Waldo Tyler (1860–1921) was an African-American journalist, war correspondent, government official, and race man. He strove for racial justice in the United States and served as the only accredited Black foreign correspondent specifically reporting on African-American servicemen stationed in France during World War I. His career began in his hometown of Columbus, Ohio, in the late 1880s, where he held several journalistic positions including editor of the Afro-American; co-founding the short-lived African-American newspaper, The Free American; contributing a Black news column and serving as society editor at the white-owned Columbus Evening Dispatch, and writing for The Ohio State Journal. Early on, his journalistic skills placed him in constant dialog with Black political and business leaders in the Midwest who were engaged in improving the social standing of African Americans at the height of the Jim Crow laws. In 1906, Tyler actively campaigned for an appointment as United States consul to Brazil. His political activities drew the attention of prominent national Black figures. In 1907, upon the advice of Booker T. Washington, Tyler was appointed by President Theodore Roosevelt to fill the post of Auditor of the Department of the Navy. He held this post until 1913, when during the first year of Woodrow Wilson's presidency—overlooking the advice of his colleagues—Tyler published an article in the Washington Evening Star criticizing the President's segregationist policies, such as the segregation of government offices. Soon afterward, Tyler's governmental post under Wilson ended. Booker T. Washington and his Secretary, Emmett J. Scott, next recommended Tyler to be the National Organizer of the National Negro Business League (NNBL), an organization founded by Washington to engage in documenting the state of Black businesses to promote an organized and active League membership. Tyler learned about the social conditions and concerns of Blacks throughout the country. His role at the NNBL entailed visiting and addressing local branches of the NNBL. His findings were reported in a 1914 syndicated column of the American Press Association, and his travels through the Southern U.S. enabled him to undertake a personal study of the Great Migration then in progress by blacks out of the rural South for the North and Midwest. These reports were eventually published in various U.S. magazines, journals, and newspapers. In 1917, Tyler left this post to serve as secretary in another organization founded by Washington, the National Colored Soldiers' Comfort Committee, which provided financial support for Black soldiers and their families. Following this position, Tyler was selected as the only African-American journalist to be stationed overseas and reporting on Black soldiers at the European front. In 1918, a committee overseen by Emmett J. Scott, (aka, Emmett Jay Scott) who was serving as the Special Assistant to the U.S. Secretary of War, selected Tyler to be stationed in the northeast Metz region of France with General John J. Pershing's brigade. Tyler's reports were sent back to the U.S., and edited and distributed by Scott to newspapers and journals nationally. Tyler reported from the trenches at the front in Northeastern Metz, France. Later Scott published several of Tyler's reports in Scott's Official History of the American Negro in The World War (1919). Back in the States, Tyler's reports provided first-hand accounts of the heroic deeds of Black soldiers and boosted the morale of the troops overseas. He also documented discrimination that the Black troops faced at the hands of white American organizations and service personnel, and contrasted it with the relatively unbiased treatment they received from the French. Following the war, Tyler returned to Ohio where he worked in journalism, becoming editor of the Cleveland Advocate in 1919, associate editor of the Columbus Ohio State Monitor, and contributing articles to newspapers in New York and Chicago. Numerous letters of Tyler's personal correspondence can be found at the Ohio Historical Society. The Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture holds Tyler's business letters and reports from his post as National Director of the National Negro Business League."

Newbegin served as U.S. Ambassador to Honduras from 1958 to 1960, when he became Ambassador to Haiti. He retired from the Foreign Service in 1962, but was a State Department negotiator on the Panama Canal treaty the next year. While Ambassador to Haiti in 1961, Newbegin was recalled to Washington prior to the inauguration of dictator François Duvalier, in protest of his fraudulent election. A Marine colonel stationed in Haiti once referred to Newbegin as an \"extremely decisive and strong-willed Ambassador\", a judgement echoed in other sources. In a state department briefing during the recall, however, Newbegin expressed the opinion that there was no credible opposition in Haiti to Duvalier, and thus that the recall would have little positive effect. Newbegin was right, in that the US cut off economic assistance in 1962 and Duvalier appointed himself President for Life in 1964. While ambassador, Newbegin instituted a French-language training programme among US government personnel there, and urged Americans to step up their contributions to Haitian charities."

Born in Steinbach, Manitoba, the son of Abraham Loewen, a funeral parlour operator, Loewen completed a degree in theology at Briercrest Bible College in Saskatchewan. When his father became ill, he took over the family business. He married Anne Heinrichs in 1962. In 1969, Loewen and his family moved to British Columbia. At that time, he also became involved in real estate and transportation. After leaving politics, Loewen was involved in real estate for a time. During the mid-1980s, he began acquiring Canadian funeral homes. In 1987, the Loewen Group expanded into the United States. By 1997, the company had 15,000 employees and operated 1,115 funeral homes. In 1995, a funeral home operator in Mississippi won $500 million in damages in a breach of contract suit. The large amount of punitive damages awarded relative to business assets not worth more than $4 million was criticized, but this setback led to a downturn in the company's fortunes. In 1998, Loewen stepped down as CEO and sold his shares in the company. The Loewen Group filed for bankruptcy protection in 1999; in 2002, it was restructured as the Alderwoods Group. In 2008, Loewen's Twin Cedars estate in Burnaby was listed for sale at $25 million (Canadian), and was sold June 2012 for $9.948 million."

  "text" : "Rosena Brown (Irish: Róisín De Brún; born c.1945) is an Irish actress of television, cinema, and stage from Belfast, Northern Ireland who also served as an intelligence officer for the Provisional IRA. Dubbed the \"IRA Mata Hari\", she was named in the murder trial of prison officer John Hanna, who was charged and convicted of helping the IRA kill colleague Brian Armour. She allegedly persuaded Hanna into providing information on Armour which she then passed on to the IRA; however, she was not charged with complicity in Armour's murder. In 1992, she and two men were arrested when a booby-trap bomb was found in their car. In 1993, she was sentenced to 20 years imprisonment, but was released in December 1998 under the terms of the Good Friday Agreement. A grandmother of nine, Brown continued to work in local community theatre following her release. She was portrayed by actress Rose McGowan in the 2008 crime thriller film, Fifty Dead Men Walking."

Also involved in the militia, he became a professional soldier in 1912 when he joined the New Zealand Military Forces. He was commanding the Auckland Military District at the time of the outbreak of the First World War and was appointed the commander of the Samoa Expeditionary Force, dispatched from New Zealand to occupy the island of Samoa, a territory of Imperial Germany at the time. Samoa was easily occupied on 29 August 1914 and Logan became its Military Administrator; he remained in this capacity for the duration of the war. Although he was decorated for his services, his administration of Samoa was later criticised, particularly in relation to the handling of the influenza outbreak of November 1918, which led to 7,500 deaths. Logan retired from military service in 1919 and settled in Devon, England, where he died in 1935."

He was awarded the Kaiser-i-Hind medal in 1900. He was the only member of the India Police Commission who dissented with a report on requirements for police service, and suggested that the recruitment to the Indian Police Services should be through a single exam only to be conducted in India and Britain simultaneously. He also suggested the recruitment should not be based on colour or nationality. This suggestion was rejected by the India Police Commission. Maharaja Rameshwar Singh was a Tantric and was known as Buddhist Siddha. He was considered a Rajarsi (sage king) by his people. He was knighted a Knight Commander of the Order of the Indian Empire (KCIE) on 26 June 1902, was promoted to a Knight Grand Commander (GCIE) in the 1915 Birthday Honours List and was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire, Civil Division (KBE) in the 1918 Birthday Honours List.

  "text" : "Ruth Maxon Adams (1883–1970) was an American architect. Adams grew up in New Haven, Connecticut, the only child of Yale professor George Burton Adams. As a child, she visited England with her father, where she was first exposed to William Morris and the Arts and Crafts movement. She graduated from Vassar College in 1904, with no intention of practicing architecture. Six years later, she enrolled in the New York School of Applied Design for Women to study interior design. Adams received commissions from Vassar to remodel several campus buildings in 1914. The following year she decided to open her own interior design firm in New York City. During that first year, she received a commission to design a house for two Vassar professors, Edith Fahnestock and Rose Peebles. Adams would go on to design at least six Vassar residences over the course of forty years. Their architectural styles varied, including medieval, Tudor, and neoclassical architecture. She also served as a design consultant for Vassar until 1942. In this position she compiled annual inventories of all of the buildings owned by the college. In 1921 Adams became the architect for Yelping Hill in Connecticut. The neighborhood, a part of West Cornwall, was a summer getaway in the Berkshires. Adams designed all the residences, co-planned the community, and served as a construction foreman. The houses had no kitchens, as all dining took place in a communal dining room. Childcare was also a community task. These concepts and executions by Adams are considered by architecture historians to be an expression of Adams' feminist ideals. Despite focusing on architecture, Adams described herself as a \"designer,\" rather than an architect."

  "text" : "Robert Conroy Goldston (9 July 1927 in New York – ?) was an American history writer and the son of Philip Henry Goldston and Josephine Conroy. He lived in Los Angeles for some time and then settled on Ibiza in the Balearic Islands, having married Marguerite Garvey, a classical pianist, on 3 January 1956, the union producing five daughters and a son. Goldston was educated in Los Angeles, the Midwest and attended Columbia University between 1946 and 1953. He served in the U.S. Army, did some sailing on the Great Lakes and at one time was a science-fiction cover artist under the pseudonym James Stark for Nebula Science Fiction. (example: December 1956 and May 1957 Nebula Science Fiction) He was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship in fiction in 1957-8. A derisive description of Franco in The Civil War in Spain, “the fat fratricide sitting on a gilt throne in Madrid, staring past his stuffed Jefes into the black regions promised him by the half men bishops ... those puffed and fearful eyes that gazed paternally from the faces of newspapers and posters and postage stamps and coins” led to his being expelled and later permitted to return after the intervention of a de Vilmorin family member and Franco's own brother. Goldston's prolific output of non-fiction histories lasted from 1947 to 1985."

  "text" : "Roy Burns (b. November 30, 1935) is an American drummer, educator and percussion manufacturer.Burns was one of the first to give drum clinics, and is credited with pioneering the concept. Burns was born and grew up in Emporia, Kansas. Louie Bellson heard him play in Kansas City and advised him to study in New York. In August 1955, at the age of 20, Burns left Kansas with $300 and a drum set to study drumming in New York City. Within a year, he was Woody Herman's drummer (at 21). Shortly thereafter, he left to join Benny Goodman's band which was having a resurgence due to the firm, The Benny Goodman Story. In 1958, Burns was with Goodman's band as they toured Europe and recorded several albums at the Brussels World's Fair. In 1960, he was based in New York City, teaching and doing studio drumming on the NBC Staff Orchestra, the Merv Griffin Show, the Tonight Show, and others. From 1968-1980, he was a staff artist with the Rogers Drum Company as a staff artist and traveled the world as a clinician, one of the first American drummers to perform clinics. He is noted for his live and studio work, teaching, and his method books, as well as for pioneering the concept of a drum clinic. In 1980, he began writing a column in Modern Drummer Magazine which ran until 1992. In 1980, he partnered Ron Marquez to form Aquarian Accessories to manufacture percussion equipment. Aquarian subsequently achieved enormous success with their drum heads, which it began producing in 1987."

Based on seeing research speculation that a chimpanzee might be able to be raised like a human child, he conceived of the Bedtime for Bonzo story. He shared a script with his brother-in-law, Ted Berkman, and becoming partners on this and other projects, both received a story credit for the film. Fear Strikes Out (1957) brought Blau and Berkman their greatest acclaim. In 1962, Blau and his wife Helen moved to Nova Scotia.

They are full of trope and figure, frequently with much force of application, quaint and sententious. The precise title of his work is as follows: Love's Missives to Virtue; with Essaies, London printed by William Godbid, and are to be sold at the signe of the Star, in Little Britain, 1660. Small octavo, pages 120."

She stayed in the United Kingdom until the death of her father in 1899. In 1903, Rachel married George Whitefield Armitage, an accountant from South Otago. The couple moved to south Canterbury where they settled at Temuka and had two sons. Rachel continued her community work, founding a local branch of the New Zealand Federation of Women's Institutes. She also became a leading campaigner for the Plunket Society in rural Canterbury, an organisation which had been founded by family friend Sir Truby King, and was Temuka branch president from 1914 to 1928, as well as being a national committee member in 1928. After the death of George Armitage in 1943, she helped her sister Mary take care of her ailing brother, William Downie Stewart, Jr., who suffered from crippling rheumatoid arthritis.

Earle was selected to take over after Crozier's 68-year run due to his stewardship of a blog, written under the nom de plume William Ernest Butler, dedicated to Crosaire solutions. He published the rationale behind each clue to the Crosaire Blog, which has been integrated into the larger Irish Times website and is continued by his successor, \"Crossheir.\" His final Crosaire was published on the 9th of June 2012 after just over seven months on the job. Earle cited a change in personal circumstances as the reason for his retirement. He was educated at Sandymount High School, University College Dublin and Sheffield University. He lives in the San Francisco Bay Area with his wife Paula and his two sons, David and Brian."

  "text" : "Roger de Bussy was a medieval Anglo-Norman nobleman during the reigns of King Stephen of England and King Henry II of England. Roger was the son of William de Bussy, who held lands at Old Wardon in Bedfordshire and William's wife Hawise, the sister of Walter Espec. He had brothers Jordan and William, with William likely the eldest as he was his father's heir, as well as heir to part of the lands of his uncle Walter Espec. Roger held some lands in Oxfordshire near Steeple Barton, perhaps as a vassal of John de St John. Roger was with King Stephen at Woodstock in 1149, where he was noted as an adherent of the royal party in the civil war between Stephen and his cousin Matilda. He gave lands at Barton in Oxfordshire to Colchester Abbey, the grant of which was confirmed by Stephen. The Treaty of Wallingford in 1153 noted that Roger had custody of Oxford Castle, and that he had sworn fealty to Duke Henry, who became King Henry II in 1154. Roger's brother Jordan was noted as holding Lincoln Castle and was likewise a vassal of Henry's. In the treaty, both brothers swore to hand over their castles to Henry when Stephen died and Henry inherited the kingdom of England. Both men also handed over hostages, to ensure their fulfillment of the treaty terms. The treaty does not make clear whether or not Roger actually controlled Oxford Castle at the time. After the accession of King Henry, both Roger and his brother Jordan appear in the royal records as receiving money in 1156 and 1157 from the Sheriff of Yorkshire."

  "text" : "Ronald Angus Fraser (9 December 1930 – 10 February 2012) was a British historian noted for his oral histories and in particular for Blood of Spain, his oral history of the Spanish Civil War. Born in Hamburg to an upper-middle class British father and wealthy American mother, Fraser was educated at boarding school in England and the USA and undertook further studies in Switzerland and France. He chronicled his upbringing in his oral history In Search of a Past: The Rearing of an English Gentleman, 1933-1945 (1984), in which interviews with the servants at his family's Berkshire country house served as a counterpoint to his own memories. Fraser spent five years as a correspondent with Reuters in Brussels, The Hague and London before moving to Spain in 1957 to become a full-time writer. Fraser was one of the pioneers of oral history in the 1960s and '70s most notably with In Hiding: The Life of Manuel Cortes (1972) and Blood of Spain: An Oral History of the Spanish Civil War (1979). His book Napoleon’s Cursed War: Spanish Popular Resistance in the Peninsular War, 1808-1814 (2008) applied his experience of oral history to traditional archival sources. Fraser's friendship with André Gorz led to his involvement with the New Left Review from the early 1960s. He was a lifelong socialist and at his death a senior member of the New Left Trust. He was a founder of New Left Books, the parent company of publisher Verso Books."

  "text" : "Richard Tomlins or Tomlyns (1563–1650) was an English lawyer and politician who sat in the House of Commons between 1621 and 1629. He invested in the Virginia Company, founded a lectureship in anatomy at Oxford University and served as Baron of the Exchequer during the Interregnum. Tomlins was the son of Edward Tomlins, of Tiddenham, Gloucestershire. He was admitted at Inner Temple in November 1605 and was called to bar in 1614. He was resident of Westminster and became an investor in the Virginia Company in 1620. In 1621, he was elected Member of Parliament for Ludlow and was re-elected MP for Ludlow in 1624. On 1 October 1624 he founded the Tomlins Readership in Anatomy which was attached to the Regius Chair at Oxford University and nominated \"his worthy friend Thomas Clayton\" to be first reader. He was elected MP for Ludlow again in 1625, 1626 and 1628 and sat until 1629 when King Charles dispensed with parliament for eleven years. Tomlins was assigned to assist John Bastwick and Henry Burton in their complaint against their cruel punishment by the star chamber and in 1641 they were compensated by the Long Parliament. In 1645 all the cursitor barons had gone to join the king at Oxford except for Thomas Trevor who was in poor health. Tomlins was therefore recommended as cursitor baron and became a bencher of his inn in that year. Following the death of the King in 1649 he was sworn as Baron of the Exchequer and held the position until the Restoration in 1660. He was described as a garrulous humourist on the basis of a transcript of a speech he gave to the Sheriffs of London in 1659."

  "text" : "Richard Youl (December 3, 1821 – August 6, 1897) was an Australian coroner, surgeon, public servant and general practitioner. He was younger brother of James Arndell Youl. He grew up and was educated in England, graduating from the University of St Andrews, moving to Victoria when he returned to Australia. He was a noted medical practitioner, becoming in 1852 a founding member and secretary of the Victoria Medical Association. In 1853 he was appointed assistant surgeon to the Melbourne Gaols and a magistrate and district coroner for Bourke, New South Wales. During 1854 he was acting coroner for Melbourne, and from 1854 to 1867 he was visiting justice to penal establishments in Victoria. He became Melbourne Coroner permanently in 1857 and lost office in 1878 due to Premier Graham Berry's purge of civil servants claiming being unable to pay them. He regained office after the controversy calmed down. During his career he was reputed to have conducted over 12,000 inquests. He was a member of the Central Board of Health from 1855 until 1884 and its president during 1879–84. He was a member of the Medical Board of Victoria from 1858 and president from 1885 to 1897, Chairman of the Police Medical Board in 1892 and founded the Victorian Infant Asylum in 1877. He was said to have been quite liberal for his time, being opposed to the death penalty and the internment of juvenile offenders and the insane with normal criminals. He argued that prostitution should be legalised so it could be controlled safety. He died in 1897."

  "text" : "Robert Seymour (c. 1955 – 15 June 1988) was a Northern Irish loyalist and a leading member of the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF). He served as the paramilitary organisation's East Belfast commander before being shot dead by the Provisional IRA in an alley behind his video shop in Woodstock Road, east Belfast. His killing was in retaliation for the UVF bombing of a nationalist pub in which three Catholics died. In 1983, Seymour was convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment for the 1981 murder of leading IRA member James \"Skipper\" Burns. Seymour cycled to Burns' home in Rodney Parade, off the Donegall Road, and shot him to death as he lay sleeping beside his girlfriend. Seymour's conviction was overturned in the Appeal Court after the judge found the testimony of supergrass Joe Bennett \"unbelievable\". Until 2011, Seymour's image featured on a large mural painted on a gable in Ballymacarrett Road, east Belfast. He had become a local legend after the killing of Burns."
