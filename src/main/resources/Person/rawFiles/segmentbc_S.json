  "text" : "Sidney Scholey (c. 1880–1960) was an English football manager who managed Walsall in the 1929–30 season. Scholey was born in Walsall and became trainer of his local club in 1908, remaining at Hilary Street until 1911. He then became a masseur at the Marine Hydro in Rhyl, where he treated many famous footballers. He had a spell as trainer at Stockport County before the First World War. After spending the war in the Royal Army Medical Corps he joined Birmingham City as a trainer in 1920. At the end of his first season with the St. Andrew's club they won the Football League Second Division championship. During the 1927–28 season, he had a brief period as caretaker-manager but left the club shortly afterwards. He then returned to Hilary Street as trainer before taking over from Jimmy Kerr, who had left to join Norwich City, as manager in April 1929. His first season as manager ended with the club 17th in the Third Division (South) before Scholey resigned in October 1930. His most notable game in charge was an FA Cup tie at Villa Park in January 1930 in front of a crowd in excess of 74,600; Villa won the match 3–1, with the winning goal coming ten minutes from the end of the match. Scholey died in 1960. His obituary in a local newspaper claimed that in his youth he was known as a gymnast and wrestler."

After several promotions, he was appointed as the ağa of the Jannisaries, the highest rank in the army, in 1739. The same year he took part in the Battle of Grocka, where he distinguished himself as a capable leader and fighter. Three years later, on October 4, 1742, he was appointed as the grand vizier. Although he spent almost four years in the office, he wasn’t successful in civil administration and he was dismissed by the sultan on August 10, 1746. However, as was the case for many former grand viziers, he continued as a governor in several different parts of the Ottoman Empire. He became the governor of the island of Rhodes (now in Greece), İçel (modern Mersin Province, Turkey), and Diyarbakır. He died in December 1748. His son, Seyyid Abdullah Pasha, also served as grand vizier one term after him."

Torre has developed a career that combined “theoretical concerns with the actual practice of building”  and architectural and urban design with teaching and writing. Torre was the first woman invited to design a building in Columbus, IN, “a town internationally known for its collection of buildings designed by prominent architects.” In 1977 Torre organized and curated the first major exhibition of American women architects, and edited the book Women in American Architecture: A Historic and Contemporary Perspective. The exhibition opened at the Brooklyn Museum in 1977 and traveled across the United States and to the Netherlands. The exhibition and book of the same title, which she edited and to which she contributed three essays, pioneered work in this field. Torre was also a co-founder of Heresies, A Feminist Journal on Art and Politics; was a member of the editorial collectives of Heresies 2: Patterns of Communication and Space; and Heresies 11: Making Room: Women in Architecture; and served on the editorial board of Chrysalis between 1976-1978."

He worked in New York City for CBS radio in the 1940s, then as a disc jockey in Chicago, where he acquired his nickname after replacing a DJ whose nickname was \"Wide-Awake\", and in Phoenix, Arizona, where he was station manager and program manager at KARV. Moving to Southern California, Stein became a disc jockey at KFOX, often broadcasting from the Lighthouse Café in Hermosa Beach. In 1957, he bought KNOB, where he instituted an all-jazz programming policy. The station became known as \"The Jazz Knob\". His staff included such announcers as Chuck Niles and Jim Gosa. In the early '60s, Stein hosted a radio show on KNOB from Strollers, a nightclub in Long Beach, with live performances by such players as Chico Hamilton. After selling KNOB in 1966, Stein worked as a stockbroker. The Los Angeles Jazz Institute has a collection which \"features large scrapbooks that document his career including detailed coverage of the birth and growth of KNOB.

He provided the voice of the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle for the Mayavision - BBC television series King Alfred and the Anglo Saxons in which the Chronicle entries were read in Old English. Pollington co-authored a report on the making of a replica of the Sutton Hoo stone with Paul Mortimer and its wider implications, from which he was invited to present a paper at the Wystawa podczas konferencji archeologicznej w Bytowie in September 2014 (proceedings forthcoming). Pollington was formerly a trustee of the Steadfast Trust, an English nationalist charity founded in 2004 by Tony Linsell which is based in Macclesfield, Cheshire."

  "text" : "Sir John Cecil Power, 1st Baronet, (21 December 1870 – 5 June 1950) was a British businessman and Conservative Party politician. Born at Eldon, County Down, he was the son of William Taylor Power by his wife, Cecilia née Burgoyne. The family moved to London when he was aged 10. With his brother, Frederick, he entered the family business of Power, Power and Company export merchants. As a young man he travelled extensively in Europe and North America. In 1902 he married Mabel Perks, with whom he had five children. Power subsequently started his own real estate business, becoming a wealthy developer owning much property in central London including Adastral House in the redeveloped Kingsway. Power became known for his generous financial gifts to various institutions. Of £24,000 collected to allow the construction of the Institute of Historical Research in 1921, Power gave £20,000. In 1923 he gave a large donation that allowed for the purchase of the site of Chatham House as the headquarters of the Institute of International Affairs; Power was Honorary Treasurer of the Institute from 1921 to 1943. He was also an active member of the League of Nations Union, sitting on its executive for seven years and also on various committees. He was a committee member of the Royal Humane Society and donated a site for the first headquarters of the British Council. In 1924, Power was created a baronet, of Newlands Manor, in the Parish of Milford, in the County of Southampton. In the general election in same year he was elected as Member of Parliament for Wimbledon, holding the seat until his retirement due to ill health at the 1945 general election. Lady Power died suddenly in the same year, a loss that affected him deeply. His retirement years were spent at his Hampshire home and a villa at Grasse on the French Riviera. He died in France in 1950, aged 79. Sir John was succeeded in the baronetcy by his elder son, Ivan McLannahan Cecil Power, a London County Councillor and director of various companies who had, by his first wife Nancy, daughter of Rev John Griffiths: John Power (3rd baronet) and Hilary, Lady Cardoss."

His Tamil entry as Sanjay in Odangal also met lukewarm response. He later did low-budget films like Kalpana House. In 90's, he rechristened himself as Varun Raj, grew a moustache and tried working again in Tamil films like Thoothu Po Chellakiliye, Padhukappu, Athipathi and Manivannan' s Gangai Karai Paattu, with little success.

He has a personal best of 2:11:32 hours and won the gold medal in the marathon at the 2011 Pan American Games. Da Silva worked as a waste collector in Penápolis during his twenties and it was not until 2009, at the age of 27, that he became interested in athletics. Upon the suggestion of his wife, he entered a local race held in honor of Saint Francis of Assisi. Although it was his first attempt at competing over long distances, he surprised himself by finishing in third place. The following year he entered a 10,000 metres track race in Rio de Janeiro and won in a time of 29:39.72 minutes. At the São Paulo Half Marathon Corpore in April 2010 he came third, then he stepped up in distance to make his debut in the full marathon a month later. He surprised the field at the Porto Alegre Marathon by winning on his first attempt in a time of 2:15:45 hours. Under the guidance of two-time Olympian Clodoaldo do Carmo, da Silva represented Esporte Clube Pinheiros in the 10,000 m at the Troféu Brasil de Atletismo (the Brazilian championships) and came fourth at his first national level event. He began his 2011 season by winning his first South American title as he defeated fellow Brazilian Gládson Barbosa with a sprint finish in the men's 12 km race at the South American Cross Country Championships in Asunción, Paraguay. In March he ran in his first race in Europe: he was the first non-African finisher at the Lisbon Half Marathon, where he came tenth in a time of 1:04:10 hours. He then travelled to Italy to compete at the Padua Marathon and he ran a personal best of 2:11:32 hours to finish fourth behind Kenya's Peter Kimeli Some. Da Silva returned to Brazil and later that year placed fourth nationally in both the 5000 metres and 10,000 m (including a personal best of 14:12.81 minutes in the former event). His performances in the marathon gained him selection for the Brazilian team at the 2011 Pan American Games. He entered the competition with the fastest time and delivered on this by winning the gold medal in a time of 2:16:37 hours, having over half a minute to spare over runner-up Diego Colorado of Colombia. This made it a fourth consecutive win for Brazil in the men's Pan American marathon, following on from victories by Vanderlei de Lima and Franck de Almeida. He was invited to the 2012 London Marathon and came eighteenth. A better performance followed in June's São Paulo, which he won in a time of 2:12:25."

Songs of the People was a series which ran from 17 November 1923 to 1939 in the Coleraine newspaper The Northern Constitution. For twelve of those years the editor was Sam Henry who contributed upwards of 500 songs of high quality. The first song printed was \"The Flower of Sweet Dunmull\", collected from Nancy Harbison, Ballywillan, Portrush.

  "text" : "Stella Browne (9 May 1880 – 8 May 1955) was a Canadian-born British feminist, socialist, sex radical, and birth control campaigner. She was one of the primary women in the fight for women’s right to control and make decisions regarding their sexual choices. Active mainly in Britain, her principal focus was on sexual law reform, including the right for women to both access knowledge on and use birth control, as well as the right to abortion. She was also involved in labour parties, communist parties, as well as a number of women’s societies. Stella Browne was one of the first women to speak out in somewhat offensive ways about her beliefs with a “Forward, Charge!” approach. She did this through attacks in her articles and letters that kept her in the public’s eye and added to the debates around many controversial topics surrounding women’s rights. She is famous for her lectures and her work with the Abortion Law Reform Association. As a women’s rights activist, Browne was able to keep questions of women’s rights to their body and sexuality in the public eye long enough to get other people interested enough to keep the cause going even after her death."

He was the first person to be inducted into both the Harness Racing Hall of Fame and its Communicator's Hall of Fame. Bergstein died on November 2, 2011 after suffering from health problems for a year. He died only nine months after he retired as vice president. He is survived by his two children, Al and Lisa and four grandsons. His wife, June, died in 2010, four days after their 60th wedding anniversary. Born above a grocery store in Pottsville, Pennsylvania, to the grocer Milton and his wife Esther, on 19 June 1924 and died in his home in Tucson, Arizona on 2 November 2011 at the age of 87. The most accurate obituary this writer has seen appears to be from the Chicago Tribune. Also, Stan wrote a detailed article on his career before 1970 that was republished in the 9 November 2011 \"Horseman and Fair World\" (which is not yet available on the Internet as of this writing). Served in WWII landing on Omaha Beach a few days after DDay. Fought across Normandy with Patton's Army. Fought in the Battle of the Bulge. Was injured and received the Purple Heart. After returning from the war, graduated from Northwestern's Medill School of Journalism. Worked in public relations for a variety of harness racing tracks in the 1940s. Also spent time as announcer and car driver, PR and other activities with the Harlem Globetrotters from approximately 1948 to 1952. Married the model June Hanna in 1950. They had a son and daughter. In 1961 he helped create Harness Tracks of America, a trade group representing race track owners. He originally held the title of Executive Secretary, but also ran day to day operations for the organization. He held both that position and that of Executive Vice President until his retirement in February 2011, at which time he took the position of President Emeritus. In 1968, he additionally joined, as the vice president of publicity and public relations, the U.S. Trotting Association, the governing body of the standardbred sport. He also became editor of the USTA's award-winning monthly magazine, HoofBeats. In the 1950s, he worked as an announcer at many race tracks around America, including Sportsman's Part and Maywood Park in Chicago, Santa Anita in Los Angeles, and numerous other tracks. He also appeared on television as both color commentator and announcer for such premiere race events as The Little Brown Jug, and The Hambeltonian, later in his career. Bergstein was also a reader of horse pedigrees, which is a specialized skill requiring a knowledge of horse lineage. He was hired by major auctioneers, such as the late George Swinebroad and others, at the fall sales events in Lexington, Kentucky; Harrisburg Pennsylvania and other locations. Eventually he became a certified auctioneer, and ran his own sales for a couple of years in the 1970s. He also ran a small bookstore specializing in harness horse books and magazines, out of his home, eventually compiling one of the largest private collections of books on the subject, according to Stan's knowledge of other booksellers and private collectors. He sold the bulk of the library in the 1980s to a buyer from Sweden. In the 1970s and into the 1980s he was co-anchor on a television show on WOR-TV in New York City, broadcasting harness racing in conjunction with the State's then new Off Track Betting industry. He ended his working relationship with USTA in the mid-1970s, but remained a close business associate with the organization until his death. In the 1970s he created the \"World Driving Championship\", yearly series of races from top drivers and horses from around the world. The Driving Championship would take the drivers and horses to races in Europe, Australia, United States and Canada, among other countries. Bergstein also created a yearly convention of the harness racing industry, managing the event. He was a keynote speaker, and also was master of ceremonies at many annual events over the decades. Bergstein owned a series of harness horses during his life, and also was partner in a number of horse breeding operations. Moved with his wife June to Tucson Arizona in the 1980s, moving the offices of HTA there as well. Created a relationship between HTA and the University of Arizona's racing industry studies program,and strove to hire its graduates to his organization. Many of his hires went on to significant roles in the harness racing industry. Health problems and the natural aging process led him to retire from HTA in February 2011. He was still writing a number of weekly columns for various journals at the time of his death."

  "text" : "Scott DeLancey (born 1949) is an American linguist (University of Oregon). His work focuses on typology and historical linguistics of Tibeto-Burman and North American indigenous languages, such as the Penutian family, and in particular the Klamath language. His research is known for its diversity of its thematic and theoretical reach. He is well known for having developed the concept of mirative, for promoting the study of comparative Penutian and for being a vocal proponent of the idea that a system of agreement should be reconstructed in proto-Tibeto-Burman He is currently undertaking field research on several Tibeto-Burman languages of North-Eastern India. Sinitic he takes, like others, to be typologically a mainland south east Asian language. The Chinese mainland consensus on Sino-Tibetan theory holds that the Sino-Tibetan language family descends from a single linguistic ancestor that accounts for shared features of monosyllabism, tonal features, and isolating characteristics. Some of these may, however, have arisen from early borrowing between members now included in this language family. The history of Vietnamese, to cite one example, shows how an originally atonal, polysyllabic language can, under Chinese influence, adopt the characteristics of the latter. De Lancey has developed the hypothesis that the growth of the Shang state may have led to the adoption of its language as a lingua franca among the southern Baiyue and the Sino-Tibetan speaking Zhou to the West, creating a common lexical stock. According to this theory, the emergence of the Zhou within the Shang state strengthened a Sino-Tibetan component, which, on the accession of the Zhou to dynastic power, subjected the lingua franca to a process of creolization with a stronger Zhou Sino-Tibetan lexicon while building on a morphology inherited from Shang dynasty speakers. Sinitic in his view fits a mainland south-east Asian typology. The sum effect of this hypothetical Zhou diffusion of their version of the lingua franca was, he argues, one of Tibeto-Burmanization, with a concomitant shift from a SVO morphological substrate to a language with an increasing tendency towards SOV structure. Linguist Paul K. Benedict also proposed that the Shang may have not been Sinitic speakers and that the Zhou invaders from the west were the bearers of proto-Sinitic languages."

  "text" : "Simon Acland (born 27 March 1958) is a British venture capitalist and author. Acland was educated at Eton and Lincoln College, Oxford, from which he graduated in 1979 with an Honours Degree in Modern Languages (French and German). He spent most of his venture capital career at London-based Quester. He specialised in backing early-stage technology businesses. Two of these, Surfcontrol plc and Orchestream plc, became members of the FTSE 250. Quester was acquired in 2007 by Spark Ventures. In June 2010 Acland's first novel, The Waste Land, was published by Charlwood Books. A sequel, The Flowers of Evil, followed in July 2011. These are historical novels set in the First Crusade which draw for their material on some of the myths and legends about the Holy Grail, the Assassins, and the Templars. In October 2010 Nicholas Brealey Publishing published Acland's Angels, Dragons and Vultures : How to tame your investors...and not lose your company, a guide for entrepreneurs to raising finance and managing investors based on his experience of the venture capital world. Acland is a director of a number of companies, including AIM-listed Elektron Technology plc and two Venture Capital Trusts managed by Triple Point Investment Management, TP70 2008 (I) plc and TP70 2010 plc. He is a Trustee of the wild flora conservation charity Plantlife. Acland was elected as a member of the London Borough of Lambeth in 1982 for Princes Ward in Kennington. He became Leader of the SDP/Liberal Alliance Group on Lambeth Council in 1984 and was re-elected to the Council for a second four-year term in 1986. In 1987 he stood for Parliament in the Vauxhall Constituency. Acland's father is Sir Antony Acland KG, GCMG, GCVO, former Head of the Diplomatic Service and British Ambassador in Washington.

Munsey was born in Easton, Pennsylvania and spent a significant amount time during his early years in Sheffield, Alabama. He is noted as a musician and songwriter, with songs on major recordings that have sold more than 12 million worldwide. He has penned tunes for Alabama, Shenandoah, The Statler Brothers, Glen Campbell, Shania Twain, Tim McGraw, The Kinleys, Butch Baker, Lorrie Morgan, Suzy Bogguss, Barbara Mandrell, Lee Greenwood, Jonathan Edwards, Mel McDaniel, Charly McClain, Wayne Massey, Ty Herndon, Collin Raye, John Michael Montgomery, Marty Raybon, and Marie Osmond. As a musician, the first band Munsey recorded with was \"The Chessmen\", who released a single on the Paradox records label which got modest radio airplay in 1970. He played keys with numerous bands and artists throughout the seventies and shared his talents with the likes of Percy Sledge and Jim Stafford before making his mark in Nashville, Tennessee as a songwriter. Munsey took some time off from his songwriting to tour with Los Angeles-based Wendy Waldman on Dan Fogelberg's Exile tour. He later signed with Charley Pride's publishing company where he penned songs for Lorrie Morgan and Tim McGraw. Munsey scored big with the McGraw single and title cut of the CD, \"All I Want Is a Life\", which reached the top of the Billboard Country charts in 1995 and earned him a BMI Million-Air award.

  "text" : "Swami Shyam styled himself as a god-man (guru). Born in 1924 in Chandani, Jalaun district, Uttar Pradesh, India, he was raised in the Vedic tradition of Knowledge of the Self (Atma-gyan). Shyam has meditated, studied and been dedicated to this tradition since his early childhood, when his father invited Swami Ramanand, a guru from Uttar Pradesh, to live in their home. Swami Ramanand initiated the young Shyam in meditation, and the family home became a meeting place for satsang (the company of true knowledge) for those who lived in the region. Ramanand taught the Vedas, the Bhagavad Gita, the Srimad Bhagavatam and other scriptures, as well as meditation. In 1973 Shyam moved to Kullu, Valley of Gods, Himachal Pradesh,India. Meditation and knowledge of the self are the essence of Shyam's teachings. He has meditated, studied and taught meditation throughout his life, and established organisations for the continuation of this work, such as the International Meditation Institute (IMI), which he founded in 1976 in Kullu; Shanti-Sneh Abhiyan, which he formed in 1986 in Kullu; and the Man-Friend Association, which he founded in the early 1960s in Chandigarh, India. In 1986, at the First International Yog Conference in New Delhi, Shyam was awarded the Yog Shiromani Award by the President of India, Giani Zail Singh, for his work in the field of meditation and self-realization and the 1974 Integrity Award presented by Geoff Stirling on behalf of Apache Communications in Gander, Newfoundland. Shyam has spoken by invitation to thousands of people throughout India and in Europe, North America and South America, at international conferences, organisations, universities and schools, as well as on television and radio. The published works of Shyam include original works in English and Hindi, as well as translations with commentaries of ancient Sanskrit texts, published by the International Meditation Institute. (See below for a list of titles.) Some of these books have been translated into French, German, Hebrew, Punjabi, Norwegian and other languages. He has written hundreds of short tracts based on his own practice and research. In addition to prose, Shyam has seven published volumes of poetry; he has written over 10,000 poems. His poetry speaks of the knowledge of the universal Self, meditation and the sense of love and devotion. It is written in classical meters, which are traditionally sung. Lauded twentieth- and twenty-first-century Hindi poets Mahadevi Varma and Gopaldas Neeraj, as well as scholars of Hindi literature, Laxmi Narayan and Ganpati Chandra Gupta, have written introductions to his published volumes of poetry. Academic theses have been written on his philosophy and his creative works (see selection listed below). The basis of Shyam's teachings is meditation. The core of his teachings is the vision of oneness, the knowledge of I, you, or self, which he says is \"pure, free, forever, birthless and deathless.\" This knowledge, he says, is unfolded through the practice of meditation, study and the application of that knowledge in a person's waking state. His mantra, \"Amaram Hum Madhuram Hum\", means, \"I am eternal, I am blissful.\" It encapsulates the essence of Shyam's philosophy and teachings."

Even though he never got another author-backed role, he has done important characters including comic roles in his later releases. He is one of the most important character actors of Malayalam cinema. George has also done prominent roles in documentaries, the most notable being Messenger, a short film produced by the De Paul Public School in Kottayam which is under the ownership of Vincentian Family. Produced on a budget of ₹1 lakh (US$1,500), it made about ₹5 lakh (US$7,400) through advertisements from a single showing on Jeevan TV in December 2011. George was paid over ₹40,000 (US$590), nearly half of the budget."

Navazesh discovered his knack for bread making after dropping out of microbiology studies to travel the world before immigrating to Canada in 1987 to perfect his baking skills at Toronto's George Brown College. Graduating in 1991 with a Culinary Management diploma, he realized there were no courses to encourage entrepreneurship within the program. Navazesh would later become an advisor at George Brown. He also worked as a chef consultant, caterer, and pastry chef until he decided to devote his efforts to opening an artisan bakery. Navazesh collected a variety of bacteria cultures, as known as bread starters, from places renowned for its leavened bread including Egypt, Russia and San Francisco. Navazesh launched his bakery in June 1998 using rented bakery facilities after hours. He sold small batches of organic sourdough products and would later develop ginger snap cookies. Within eight months, he moved his operation to a 750-square-metre plant in Toronto, Ontario, manufacturing about 3,500 units of fresh bread and baked products a day. Under Navazesh's management, this location continues to service customers throughout Canada and the U.S. Navazesh is also was the founder and president of the Artisan Bakers' Quality Alliance (ABQA), responsible for stamping authentic artisanal products with a seal promising no chemical additives, preservatives, fats, oils, sugars or genetically modified ingredients. The ABQA and its 34 member companies continue to raise the profile of artisan bakers and educate consumers about natural and organic ingredients. Navazesh continues to be a student of food chemistry visiting over 40 countries during his career to discover new techniques and ingredients to incorporate into his business."

Boone's ironing board was designed to improve the quality of ironing sleeves and the bodies of women's garments. The board was very narrow, curved, and made of wood. The shape and structure allowed it to fit a sleeve and it was reversible, so one could iron both sides of the sleeve. Boone was born Sarah Marshall in Craven County, North Carolina near the town of New Bern in February 1832. On November 25, 1847, in New Bern, she married a freedman named James Boone (or Boon); they would have eight children. The Boone family left North Carolina for New Haven, Connecticut before the outbreak of the American Civil War; they settled into a house at 30 Winter Street. James Boone worked as a brick mason until his death in 1874  while his wife was listed in New Haven directories as a dressmaker. Sarah Marshall Boone died in 1904 and is buried in a family plot in Evergreen Cemetery in New Haven."

During the Seven Years' War he served on Minorca and in the 1761 Capture of Belle Île. Shirley succeeded his father as Governor of the Bahamas in 1768, and was appointed Governor of Dominica in 1774, a post he held until the island was captured in 1778 by French forces during the American War of Independence. He was thereafter (1781) named Governor of the Leeward Islands, and awarded a baronetcy in 1786. He was promoted to lieutenant-general on 18 October 1793 and general on 8 January 1798. He died in Bath, England in 1800 and was buried in Bath Abbey. Fort Shirley in Cabrits National Park, Dominica, was named for him, as were military installations in Antigua, then-capital of the Leewards. Shirley is often incorrectly described as having been born in Boston, or in 1769. He was, however, born prior to his father's departure for Massachusetts."

  "text" : "Samar Yazbek (Arabic: سمر يزبك) is a Syrian writer and journalist. She was born in Jableh in 1970, and studied Arabic literature at university. She has written in a wide variety of genres - novels, short stories, film scripts, television dramas, film and TV criticism. She has made a documentary about the Syrian scholar Anton Maqdesi. In the past, she has edited Women of Syria, a feminist e-zine. Yazbek has been a prominent voice in support of human rights and women's rights in Syria. Her debut novel, called Tiflat as-Sama (Heavenly Girl), challenged existing taboos in Syrian society. She is a member of the minority Alawi community, but is an opponent of the government of her co-religionist President Bashar al-Assad. She took part in the 2011 protests against the Assad government, and subsequently was detained by security forces and also banned from travelling outside Syria. In 2010, Yazbek was selected as one of the Beirut39, a group of 39 Arab writers under the age of 40 chosen through a contest organised by Banipal magazine and the Hay Festival. In 2012, she was chosen for the prestigious PEN/Pinter Prize \"International writer of courage\", in recognition of her book A Woman in the Crossfire. She was awarded the Swedish Tucholsky Prize in the same year. In 2013, she received the Oxfam Novib/PEN Award to recognize writers who have been persecuted for their work. She participated in the Syrian cultural caravan (2014–5)."

  "text" : "Sir Thomas Gerard, 1st Baronet (1560 – 16 February 1621) was an English politician who sat in the House of Commons at various times between 1597 and 1621. Gerard was the son of Sir Thomas Gerard, of Bryn and his wife Elizabeth Port, daughter of Sir John Port, of Etwall, Derbyshire. He matriculated at Brasenose College, Oxford on 20 July 1578, aged 18. In 1579 he was a student of the Inner Temple. His parents and brother John were Catholics and he was tutored by a Catholic. His first wife was a recusant and he employed a \"notorious recusant\" to educate his child and was described as \"of evil affection in religion\" in 1590. Nevertheless, in 1597, he was elected Member of Parliament for Liverpool. He succeeded his father to the family estates in September 1601. He was knighted on 18 April 1603. When the order of baronet was first instituted on 22 May 1611, he was created a baronet and the £1,000, that was due to the Crown for such creation, was returned in consideration of his Father's sufferings in the cause of the King's mother Mary, Queen of Scots. In 1614 he was elected MP for Lancashire. He was elected MP for Wigan in 1621. Gerard died at the age of about 60 and was buried at St Margaret's, Westminster, on 16 February 1621. Gerard married firstly Cecily Maney, daughter of Sir Walter Maney, of Staplehurst in about 1580, with whom he had a son and heir Thomas. He married secondly, after 1606, Mary Lee, widow of Sir Robert Lee, Lord Mayor of London, and formerly of William Smith, of London and daughter of Sir James Hawes who was also Lord Mayor. His third wife was Mary Uvedale, widow of Sir Edward Uvedale and formerly of the Hon. Anthony Browne and daughter of Sir William Dormer, of Wing, Buckinghamshire. He had no children by his second and third wives."

  "text" : "Sir Charles Roderick Hunter, 3rd Baronet (6 July 1858 – 24 June 1924) was a British army officer and Conservative Party politician. The second son of Sir Claudius Stephen Paul Hunter, 2nd Baronet and his wife Constance née Bosanquet, he was educated at Eton College and the Royal Military College Sandhurst. He was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the 64th (2nd Staffordshire) Regiment of Foot in January 1878. In May of the same year he transferred to the Rifle Brigade, and in 1880 he was promoted to full lieutenant. In 1884 he was appointed aide de camp to Lord Alexander Russell, commander in chief of troops in Canada, and seconded to the general staff. He returned to his regiment in September 1885, promoted to captain. In 1887 he married Agnes Lillie Kennard of Crawley, Hampshire. In 1890 he succeeded his father in the baronetcy (his older brother having died), retiring to the reserve of officers, and accepting a commission as major in the 1st London (City of London Rifle Volunteer Brigade) Volunteer Rifle Corps, a unit of the part-time Volunteer Force. After the outbreak of the Second Boer War, Hunter was seconded for service with the Imperial Yeomanry. He left Southampton on board the SS Scot in January 1900, arriving in South Africa the following month. In January 1910 he was elected as one of two members of parliament (MPs) for Bath alongside Lord Alexander Thynne. The two members were re-elected at the December 1910 election. During the First World War returned to the general staff, holding the temporary rank of major from 1914 – 1916. In September 1918 Thynne died and Charles Foxcroft was elected in his place. In December 1918 Bath was reduced to a single-member constituency, and Hunter stood down in favour of Foxcroft. Hunter died at his London home from complications after undergoing an operation in June 1924. He was buried in Stratfield Mortimer, site of the family seat, Mortimer Hill. He had no children, and the baronetcy became extinct on his death."

  "text" : "Stewart Murray Wilson (born 11 December 1946) was born and raised in Timaru, New Zealand. During his 20s he lived in Sydney before moving to Blenheim, New Zealand. He is known publicly for serious sexual offending including offences against children. He has served 18 years in prison. In September 2012 he was released on parole with the most stringent release conditions ever imposed on a person in New Zealand. These included that he would be required to live in a house on the grounds of the Wanganui prison – which led to public outrage from local citizens and the Wanganui City Council. Wilson was recalled to jail in February 2013 after he allegedly made a phone call to someone he was not allowed to contact."

On 29 March 1839, he purchased a lieutenancy in the regiment. Macgregor fought in the First Opium War, and fell ill from sunstroke at the Battle of Chinkiang. He was promoted captain shortly thereafter, on 22 July, to replace Captain Collinson, killed at the battle. He later returned to China overland before fully recovering from his sunstroke, to which cause his death was attributed. On 19 April 1844, he exchanged into the 92nd Regiment of Foot. Macgregor died at Gibraltar in 1846. He was attended by his brother-in-law, the Rev. Joseph Sortain."

In 1638, he was called to be \"an Associate of the Bench\" but was not chosen a Bencher, though he was so erroneously described in 1652. He was Prothonotary of the Upper Bench under the Commonwealth, and petitioned the Committee for the Advance of Money on 12 January 1646, as follows \" I am joint patentee with Robert Henley (who was assessed at £2000 on 18 October 1643) in the office of Prothonotary of the King's Bench, and I agreed that he should have the profits of the office except 1/12 for me, and I gave a bond for £20,000 to his executors, if he should die, and he did the same as to my 1/12. I have always been forward for Parliament in co. Berks, in the committee for the associated counties, and have had my house and goods plundered, and my eldest son carried from his house prisoner, and most cruelly used, almost to death, and I have 8 children. I beg that if Mr. Henley be adjudged incapable of the office for delinquency, the whole office then being mine by right, you will consider my interest and care, and add something to my 1/12\". He bought from the Treason Trustees some houses in Drury Lane forfeited by William Lord Craven, which were discharged from sequestration on 17 March 1646. On 29 May 1655, he appears to have been acting on some commission for the Council of State when his name is mentioned in Cal. State Papers. In 1659, he was elected Member of Parliament for Brecon. In 1662, he was Joint Chief Clerk with Robert Henley for enrolling pleas in the King's Bench. Wightwick married Abigail Wright of Brookset, Essex, and his four sons, Samuel, Peter, George and Francis, were all admitted as members of the Inner Temple."

He was awarded for his services to Mongolian literature in 1935. Ayuush, along with other writers such as Sonombaljiriin Buyannemekü and Mördendewiin Idamsürüng, was executed during a purge directed by communist leader Khorloogiin Choibalsan in the late 1930s."

Dispatches, based on testimonies and personal experience growing up in a borderless world, portrays societies and culture in transition. The writer imagines how border-less societies try to find identity in a new world through their stories. The Best Country is set in Canada, where \" capital and skilled people are mobile, and political borders are no longer clear-cut markers of identity and sovereignty.”. Here, Das views Canadian global leadership from a human -- as opposed to a military or political -- perspective. In Greenoil he contends that Alberta's oil sands can be profitable and responsibly developed. His take on this estimated $15-trillion oil sands resource is the paradox of green oil, paving a clean energy]] future for his adopted western Canadian province, in the 21st Century.

He was appointed as Vice Minister of Coordination with Social Movements in January 2010, and elevated to Minister of Government (or Interior Minister) in January 2010. Llorenti resigned from that post on 27 September 2011 in the wake a violent raid on the indigenous march in defense of the Isiboro Sécure National Park and Indigenous Territory. Llorenti condemned it, but resigned so as to not \"be converted into an instrument of the right wing and the opposition seeking to attack the process [of change] and damage the image of the President.\" But, police commanders and Human Rights president Rolando Villena have accused Llorenti of ordering the use of brutal force against the indigenous march. The District Attorney conducted a two-year investigation and concluded that Llorenti did not order the repression. Almost a year after resigning as Bolivia’s Defense Minister, Cecilia Chacón broke her silence to question President Evo Morales’ appointment of Llorenti as ambassador to the UN—an act which, she says, signifies impunity for those responsible for the police repression of lowland indigenous marchers last September 25 at Chaparina.Nevertheless, Chacon said she doesn't know who gave the order for such an action.As ambassador to the UN, Llorenti accomplished relevant participation in different areas. He chairs the Group of 77 and has had important positions on issues such us the conflict in the Gaza Strip."

  "text" : "Shazia Hidayat (born 4 April 1976) is a Pakistani former track and field athlete. She was the only female athlete on the Pakistan team competing at the 2000 Olympics in Sydney, Australia. Her personal best for the 1500 metres is 4:58.79 minutes. She participated in athletics in the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, becoming the second woman to ever represent Pakistan in an Olympic event. Born in Chichawatni, Punjab, she grew up in a village 360 kilometers south of Islamabad. She had to overcome huge obstacles to compete internationally, the main objection being raised was how a Pakistani woman could race in a competition in which other women do not wear clothes that cover their body. Her parents, especially her father, encouraged her to run, but in the predominantly Muslim country she had to train in, it had to be done at 2:30 in the morning with a brother biking to pace her, because female athletes were not allowed to run on the road. She realized that if she qualified, she would have to wear a jogging suit while others wore shorts. Girls in Pakistan, when allowed to take part in sports, must wear such suits. She describes running qualifying races in the daytime in her home country where spectators were lining the sidelines not to cheer, but to throw rocks and tomatoes at her. Eventually because of threats to her safety and the lack of security in training and racing facilities, she relocated to Canada. In 2011 Hidayat, also competed in the Knights of Columbus Indoor Games in Saskatoon, Canada. She lives in Saskatoon, having moved here from Pakistan. She currently works at the University of Saskatchewan, takes classes to further improve her English, and trains in the afternoons. She hopes to coach other female runners in the future."

  "text" : "Stan Williams was a contemporary of the Beatles who, after retiring, authored Penny Lane is in My Ears and in My Eyes which describes memories and insights into the lives of John Lennon, George Harrison and others as they grew up in Liverpool. He once appeared on the same stage as John Lennon when in 1957 he attended skiffle auditions at The Cavern, to be followed on to the stage minutes later by the Black Jacks, featuring Lennon playing the tea-chest bass in a pair of gloves. The Black Jacks were the embryonic Quarrymen who, after many changes, became the Beatles. Stan was born in Fern Grove, near Lodge Lane, the son of Nellie (née Thomas), an auxiliary nurse, and Arthur, a bus/tram driver. Two sisters had died soon after birth, so Stan was the rather spoilt \"young emperor\" in the family. After the Luftwaffe bombed their house, they moved to a much grander, double-fronted terrace on Borrowdale Road, near Sefton Park.Stan attended Dovedale County Primary School, Liverpool. Peter Sissons was a classmate, George Harrison was a year behind him, and John Lennon and Jimmy Tarbuck were a year above him. After Dovedale School, Stan attended Toxteth Technical High School, passing A levels in History, Geography and General Studies. He then completed a BA at Liverpool University followed by a Diploma of Education. Stan began his teaching career at Elgin Academy, Morayshire, Scotland until moving to Earlston on the Scottish border as the country's first Principal Teacher of Modern Studies. In 1975, Stan moved to Fraserburgh Academy as head of the Modern Studies department where he served until retiring in 2001. Prior to writing Penny Lane is in My Ears and in My Eyes, which was launched in October, 2008, Stan was a writing contributor to the Beatles fan club."

  "text" : "Sali Nivica or Sali Nivitza (May 15, 1890 – January 10, 1920) was a politician, a patriot, an Albanian journalist and a teacher. For his patriotic activity he received the highest Albanian award, 'Honour of the Nation' as well as that of 'Teacher of the People'. Nivica was born in Rexhin village in the southern Ottoman Albania, today's Tepelenë District. Nivica went to school in Monastir (1904-1907) where he was inspired by the rebel Bajo Topulli. After that he went in Yannina where he joined the Greek-language Zosimea school (1907–09). He went in Durrës to teach there for a short time (1909–10). During this time he was increasingly caught up by the Albanian nationalist movement. During 1911–12 he was involved with anti-Ottoman activities and uprisings in southern Albania. For that he would be arrested and imprisoned in Istambul. However, he was soon released with the intervention of Ismail Bey Vlora and managed to arrange himself to teach Albanian at the Robert College. Nivica returned to Albania after independence and together with Mustafa Hilmi Leskoviku (1887–1915), also known as Muço Qulli, he funded the newspaper Populli (\"The people\") in Vlorë (1914) and shortly moved to Shkodër. The end of WWI would find him there. Nivica was a member of the National Literature Organization, and the Committee for the National Defence of Kosovo (CNDS) until his death. He continued as the editor-in-chief of the Albanian patriotic newspaper Populli restarted in early 1919. It was published in Shkodër, with strong nationalistic notes supporting the Committee for the National Defence of Kosovo. The first issue came out on January 18, 1919, with the slogan \"Për lavdinë e Atdheut\" (English: \"For the glory of the nation\"). It served somehow as a de facto journal of the Committee. During all its activity the newspaper propagandized Albanian ethnic unity, the Albanian national cause, and called for the liberation of Kosovo from the Serbs. His nationalistic activity would aggravate his relationship with neighboring countries, especially with Italy which had most of Albania under protectorate. He was killed in Shkodër by a gunman named Kolë Ashiku allegedly commissioned by the Italian Consulate. A contemporary Albanian activists, Sejfi Vllamasi gives more insight on his assassination. Nivica and Ashiku got angry with each other due to a store-renting business negotiation which did not go well, following with Nivica insulting the counterpart. Ashiku declared that he would resolve things according to the Kanun. His brother Andon, a catholic priest, notified Hysni Curri (a leader of the Committee) that Ashiku was serious. Both Curri and Nivica neglected the severity of the situation. Though Curri assigned a guard to follow Nivica, Ashiku found him alone in one of the side streets of the town and shot him twice. Nivica managed to fire four shots towards Ashiku, who ran and entered the Italian consulate. Nivica died later in the hospital, to the great delight of the Italians. Although there were rumors that connected Ashiku directly to the Italians, Vllamasi calls the incident \"an ordinary murder which caused a lot of political damage\". The day of his funeral the whole town closed the store in his respect. His funeral was attended by a large amount of people."

  "text" : "Samuel Sanders (27 June 1937 – 9 July 1999) was a distinguished American classical pianist known for sensitive collaborations with noted soloists. He was born with a congenital heart condition that required him to undergo surgery at the age of nine. He studied at Hunter College and at the Juilliard School under Sergius Kagen and Irwin Freundlich. Sanders was famous for the loyalty of his collaborators. Among the artist with whom he collaborated are Hermann Baumann (horn), Jacqueline DuPre (cello), Joshua Bell (violin). Kyung Wha Chung (violin), Jaime Laredo (violin), Yo-Yo Ma (cello), Jessye Norman (soprano), Rachel Barton Pine (violin), Paula Robison (flute), Leonard Rose (cello), Mstislav Rostropovich (cello), Robert White (tenor), Eugenia Zukerman (flute), and Pinchas Zukerman (violin). In 1996 Mr Sanders and violinist Itzhak Perlman marked the thirtieth anniversary of a partnership which has taken them to many parts of the world and resulted in 12 recordings, two of which have been awarded Grammys. With Chilean cellist Andres Diaz (cello) Sanders formed Dias-Sanders Duo. Sanders was the founder and artistic director of the Cape and Islands Chamber Music Festival in Cape Cod, MA. He received honorary doctorates from Lehman College and the St. Louis Conservatory of Music (CASA), and taught for more than three decades at the Juilliard School, where he helped found a degree program for collaborative pianists. Samuel Sanders died at New York Presbyterian Hospital in 1999. He was 62 and lived in Manhattan."

  "text" : "Serge Soudoplatoff is an entrepreneur, commentator and author, noted for his ability to envision and explain technology trends, and to contextualise these for industry, government and corporations. He consults widely across English and French-speaking territories. In 2010 and 2012, technology magazine, '01net', nominated Soudoplatoff as one of France's top 100 influencers on the nation's digital economy. Born in 1954, Serge graduated from L'Ecole Polytechnique, and in his early career worked as a cartographer, specializing in satellite positioning in Parising systems (Landsat and Navstar) and with IBM where he conducted research into pattern recognition. Soudoplatoff then moved to Cap Gemini where he managed its Paris research centre and then to France Télécom, where he was the Director of Innovation, launching projects on mobility and the Internet, and IP telephony. Since then, Soudoplatoff has become a public face of the Internet revolution, in particular, promoting the Internet-enabled paradigm peer-to-peer as an innovation strategy. He is responsible for developing Government 2.0 strategies, such as open-data, within Fondapol, the French think-tank for promoting innovative thinking in the political sphere. Although an advocate for disruptive Internet-based production models such as co-creation, Soudoplatoff controversially accepted an invitation (2010) to work for Hadopi Labs, an arm of the French \"Haute autorité\", (a governmental regulatory commission) responsible for enacting the Hadopi Law, a restrictive law on downloading copyright material.Justifying his involvement, Soudoplatoff wrote, \"as I am more a man of bridge than a man of wall, I found it a challenge to change things from inside Hadopi, rather than criticize it from the outside\". Soudoplatoff's first startup, 'HighDeal', was founded in the R&D labs of France Télécom in 1996, opened for business in California in 1999, and was sold to SAP in 2009. More recent projects include an open-source Virtual Worlds platform Vastpark, and Scanderia, which develops strategic digital games for business and education. Soudoplatoff is also a strategic advisor to the virtual worlds analytics company, kzero. He teaches in Paris, at the European business school, ESCP, and the information and multi-media school HETIC, where he created the France's first course in the use and practice of virtual worlds. Soudoplatoff's books include Avec Internet, où allons-nous? (\"Where is the Internet Taking us?\") (2004) and \"Le Monde avec Internet:apprendre, travailler, partager et créer à l'ère numérique\" (\"The Internet World: learn, work, share and create in the digital age\") (2012).Soudoplatoff has also written a satirical novel set in the enterprise world, La multinationale française (The French Multinational). Soudoplatoff is a prolific blogger. He resides in Paris, France."

  "text" : "Simon Lack (19 December 1913 – 8 August 1980) was a Scottish actor, working mostly in England. He was born Alexander MacAlpine, in Cleland, Lanarkshire, Scotland. Known locally as Alec, he was the youngest child and only son of his father, Alexander McAlpine (known as Sandy) and his mother Euphemia Ritchie. His sisters were Charlotte (Lottie), Mary, Euphemia (Euphie), Agnes (Nan) and Jenny. Another sister, Jessie, died in childhood. Sandy McAlpine was a stonemason, but worked down the mines when there was no masonry work available, making Simon Lack's later role in Proud Valley particularly poignant to those who knew him from his youth. Euphemia Ritchie's family were somewhat wealthier, but she was disowned on account of her choice of husband, and the family lived for many years in a one-room flat (known in Scottish working class language as a 'single end'), although it seems eventually one of her uncles relented and came to their aid. Alec's earliest ventures into acting were in local theatres. He seems to have chosen the pseudonym Simon Lack when he embarked upon the London stage. He lost five years during the Second World War (as did so many British actors). He served in the European theatre, and was present at Monte Cassino. After the war he returned to acting, getting back into stage work. He was also a member of the BBC Radio company during the late 1950s/early 1960s, and notably guest-starred in all but two of the Paul Temple serials (mysteries) that starred Peter Coke and Marjorie Westbury. His television roles included two Doctor Who serials; The Mind of Evil (1971) and The Androids of Tara (1978). He also guest-starred in episodes of The Saint, Jason King, and Doomwatch. He had co-starring roles in Telford's Change, Enemy at the Door and The Borgias."

He became interested in fly fishing at an early age when he began receiving outdated copies of a hunting and fishing magazine from a local sports retailer. At age 13, Bogdan was tying his own flies and would then become immersed in the sport. Upon graduating high school, Bogdan began work at Rollins Engine Company, a local engines manufacturer in Nashua. Later on, while working as a machinist, he began constructing some of the first prototypes for his reels. Stanley Bogdan died on March 27, 2011 and is survived by his son Stephen, and his daughter Cheryl Doughty. His wife Phyllis died in 1995. While standing on the shore of one of his favorite rivers; The Grand Cascapedia, Mr Bogdan smiled and said: \"I'd die if I could not fish anymore\" shortly after Mr. Bogdan could no longer fish he succombed to pancreatic cancer. 2009"

  "text" : "Stanley Hart White was a professor of Landscape Architecture at the University of Illinois from 1922 until 1959 and the inventor of the green wall. White called his invention \"Botanical Bricks\" and developed prototypes in his backyard in Urbana, Illinois. Stanley's brother, E.B. White documents the invention in his 1937 letter to Katherine S. White: “I guess everyone has crazy brothers and sisters. I know I have. Stan, by the way, has taken out a patent on an invention of his called ‘Botanical Bricks,’ which are simply plant units capable of being built up to any height, for quick landscape effects, the vertical surfaces covered with flowering vines, or the like. He thinks that the idea has great possibilities for such things as world fairs, city yards, indoor gardens, and many other projects. I think perhaps he has got hold of something, and have written him for more information. He certainly deserves a break.”  Stanley refined the vertical garden typology with his patent for the \"vegetation-Bearing Architectonic Structure and System (1938)\" in which he outlines the scope for a new field of vegetation-bearing architecture. The impact of this invention has still unrealized provocations on this history of gardens and designed landscapes, establishing precedent for verdant modernism in the prewar Middle West. The wall was reconstructed in 2012-13 as part of a Graham Foundation Research Award. Stanley Hart White is also known for his innovative teaching style and his influence on the work of Richard Haag, Hideo Sasaki, Peter Walker, Stu Dawson, Philip H. Lewis Jr., and numerous others Stanley Hart White married Blanche Bigney; they had one daughter, Janice Hart White, an accomplished artist. As E. B. White's niece, Janice was an inspiration for the title character in Stuart Little, Harper and Brothers, 1945."

  "text" : "Samuel \"Sammy\" Kean (born 1917 or 1918; died 17 April 2003) was a Scottish football player and manager. Hibs signed Kean from Kirkintilloch Rob Roy as an outside left. Kean made his senior debut on 14 August 1937, in a Scottish League match against Queen's Park. Hibs manager Willie McCartney used Kean as left half and he formed a partnership with Matt Busby when Busby signed for Hibs in 1941 as a wartime guest player. Kean made one appearance for Scotland during the war. When competitive football resumed after the war, Kean was an important figure supporting the Famous Five forward line. Kean played in the 1947 Scottish Cup Final and won a league championship medal in 1948. Kean represented the Scottish League once, in April 1947. Kean ceased his playing career after the 1948–49 season and then worked for Hibs as an assistant trainer. He moved to Dundee in the late 1950s, assisting Bob Shankly with their league championship winning team in 1962. Kean was credited with the signing of Gordon Smith, as the pair had a working relationship dating back to shifts in the Leith shipyards during the war. Kean also coached Falkirk and Partick Thistle. Kean worked for the Gas Board for the rest of his working life. Besides football, he was also a keen golfer and lawn bowls player. His wife Mary died in 1993 and Kean suffered from Alzheimer's disease in his later years. When he died in April 2003, Kean was survived by two daughters and four grandchildren."

  "text" : "Sheldon Garon is a Princeton University professor who has been described as \"the world's leading historian on household saving.\"  He is a member of both the Princeton history department and East Asian studies department. His field of interest centers on modern Japan, and particularly the relationship between state and society. Born and brought up in Minnesota, he graduated from the University of Minnesota in 1973 and received a master's degree in East Asian studies from Harvard in 1975, followed by a doctorate in history from Yale in 1981. His first book, The State and Labor in Modern Japan (1987) traced the history of the Japanese labor movement. In 1997 he published Molding Japanese Minds: The State in Everyday Life, an account of the Japanese state’s success at mobilizing its people to act in the perceived interest of the nation in, for instance, saving a high proportion of their income. The book shed new light on Japan's reluctance to embrace American-style deregulation and consumerism. In Beyond Our Means: Why America Spends and the World Saves (2011), he argues that the current savings imbalances between the United States and other developed nations are not the result merely of different individual choices. Beyond Our Means tells for the first time how other nations aggressively encouraged their citizens to save by means of special savings institutions and savings campaigns. The U.S. government, meanwhile, promoted mass consumption and reliance on credit through policies such as tax breaks on borrowing, which culminated in the global credit crunch."

After eight months of employment in Naeem's home, she was found dead with marks of torture on her body. Masih's case was brought into the limelight by the cruel and unusual circumstances of her death. The case initially garnered widespread media attention in Pakistan and around the world. Allegations of rape, torture and inhuman treatment were leveled against Naeem's family based on the original autopsy report. Naeem and his family were charged with the murder. However, they were acquitted at trial because the original autopsy report was not presented. Instead a different medical report was presented that said Shazia died of a skin disease. In addition, the police presented confusing and conflicting statements from witnesses at trial. The lack of justice for Shazia Masih highlighted the plight of Pakistan's Christian minority."

His name sign is signed with \"the /S/ handshape moving from one side of the chin to the other\"  At a very young age, he began appointing name signs for others. Both of his parents were deaf and he had three brothers, two deaf and one hard of hearing. In result, Samuel grew up in a signing and culturally enriched Deaf environment. Sam Supalla is exceptionally notable for his storytelling performances in American Sign Language (ASL), particularly for his narrative in The American Literature Series: For a Decent Living. He is as well an accomplished filmmaker. Dr. Sam Supalla is a Deaf linguist “whose interest lies in the research and English development issues concerning deaf children”  and stresses the importance in acquisition of a natural sign language."

  "text" : "Yoshisaburo \"Sabu\" Toyozumi (born Tsurumi, Yokohama, 1943) is one of the small group of musical pioneers who comprised the first generation playing free improvisation music in Japan. As an improvising drummer he played and recorded with many of the key figures in Japanese free music including the two principal figures in the first generation, Masayuki Takayanagi and Kaoru Abe from the late 1960s onwards. He is one of a very few of this circle who are still alive and engaged in playing this music today. Toyozumi features on numerous commercially available recordings with many of the most notable Japanese and international improvising musicians including Derek Bailey, Mototeru Takagi, Misha Mengelberg, Peter Brötzmann, Keiji Haino, Otomo Yoshihide, Tom Cora and Fred Van Hove. In 1971 he became the only non-American member of the Association for the Advancement of Creative Musicians(AACM)). He dedicated his first record as a leader, Sabu - Message to Chicago, to compositions by AACM members, and in 1992 toured and recorded with AACM trumpeter Wadada Leo Smith. Toyozumi has been instrumental in bringing many European and American improvisers to Japan including Derek Bailey, Misha Mengelberg and Sunny Murray. In 2005 British improvising guitarist and promoter John Russell arranged a two-day event dedicated to Toyozumi in which the drummer performed in different groupings with 14 musicians from the London improvised music scene including, most notably, Evan Parker, Lol Coxhill, Phil Minton, John Edwards and Steve Beresford. The Wire described his playing at this time as follows: \"He’s busy, but there’s always space between his notes, and he avoids the flashy technical solution to musical problems. His playing is crisp and dramatic, with a very occasional use of repetition to spark a climax. If it’s possible for a drum kit to ask awkward questions, Toyozumi seems to be doing it\". In an interview with Cadence Magazine in 1988 Toyozumi makes clear the importance of his relationship with nature as an influence on his playing and Clive Bell writing in The Wire in 2005 notes \"his devotion to the way of Watazumido, the late shakuhachi player and Zen master, whose performances mixed martial arts and music in a bizarre cocktail of discipline and craziness\". In 2009 he returned to London to feature as one of the players in Russell’s improvisation festival Fete Quaqua which was recorded for broadcast by BBC Radio 3. He continues to tour widely and in the past year or so has performed in Belgium and France, Chile, Taiwan, England, Philippines  and Greece. He also performs from time to time with the legendary Japanese noise group Hijokaidan. Currently he can be found performing on the erhu - a two-stringed Chinese violin – as often as playing the drums."

  "text" : "Eugene Rogers (March 23, 1917–November 23, 1993), known professionally as Smokey Rogers, was an American Western swing musician and songwriter active during the 1940s and 50s on the West Coast. Born in McMinnville, Tennessee, Rogers joined Spade Cooley's band in the 1940s (who gave Rogers his stage name). Tex Williams, Rogers and other members of Cooley's band formed a group called The Western Caravan. Both groups featured Rogers on vocals for novelty songs. Rogers co-wrote \"Spanish Fandango\" with Bob Wills, released in 1947. In 1949, he had a modest hit with \"A Little Bird Told Me\". Rogers is best known for writing the ballad \"Gone\", first recorded by Ferlin Husky 1952. When Husky re-recorded the song in 1956, it reached No. 1 on the country chart. It remained there for ten weeks and crossed over to the pop chart. He also wrote \"My Chickashay Gal\", popularized by Roy Rogers. From 1947–50, Eugene Rogers appeared in at least 22 of Universal Studios' \"musical featurettes\" with Tex Williams. In 1950, he bought the Bostonia Ballroom in El Cajon, California near San Diego and started a daily live TV show from the facility. In 1958, he was also doing a radio show on 50,000 watt X.E.R.B. in Rosarita Beach, Mexico. He programmed both sides of a Zane Ashton (aka Bill Aken) record of 'The Wind Running Through\" with the flip side being the same song in Spanish and called \"El Viento.\" The resulting sales in Mexico gave Ashton his first gold record. Rogers and his family lived in Apple Valley, California for several years where he was a local radio personality and performed regularly at the Branding Iron Restaurant. Rogers and his wife, Madelene, had twin sons, Roy and Rex Rogers. He died in San Diego on November 23, 1993 at age 76."

Her pictures has been featured in magazines such as Vogue Italia, Uomo Vogue, Vogue Nippon, Vogue China, I-D magazine, Another Magazine and Interview in the US. Sophie Delaporte's work has been noticed for her remarkable use of colors and movement. In September 2011 Vicki Goldberg wrote about her \"Sophie Delaporte is a French fashion photographer who is on permanently good terms with fantasy and a cheerfully offbeat approach. She has a distinctive sense of color, a fabulist's imagination, an edge of surrealism, and a knack for ambiguous narrative\". Beside her work for fashion, Her art work has been shown in six solo exhibitions in London, Paris, New-York' and Tokyo. Also widely in group exhibitions and international art fairs as Art Chicago, Bâle Miami, Photo London, ”Work on Paper” NY and Art Paris. Recently, Sophie Delaporte has transposed her photographic universe into film. In 2009, she directed her first beauty film produced by Première Heure, in which the music was composed by Mirwais. In September 2011, Tim Newman asked her to create a concept and direct 50 short films for France Télévisions, about the artistic influence of France abroad."

  "text" : "Sidney Check, aka Sid Check, is an American comic book artist best known for his stories in EC Comics. Check was often compared to Wally Wood because of a stylistic resemblance. His work appeared in EC's New Trend titles: Crime SuspenStories, The Haunt of Fear, The Vault of Horror and Weird Science. He drew for Marvel, including Weird Wonder Tales, Battle Action, Journey into Unknown Worlds. For Magazine Enterprises he contributed to White Indian. He also drew for Classics Illustrated and for Harvey Comics' Tomb of Terror. Apocolytes's World of Comics commented: Little is known about artist Sid Check, aside from the fact that he was a contemporary of fellow artists Wallace Wood, Joe Orlando and Harry Harrison, among others, in the 50s. When Wood and Orlando began their early art collaborations, Sid Check as well as Harrison were also fellow members of the same art studio. It isn't surprising that all four of them would soon be working for the same publisher, EC Comics, doing work with remarkably similar styles. To the untrained eye, Check's work can often be mistaken for Wood's. Check's art is generally engaging and attractive, if not entirely as well constructed as Wood's art was. Less prolific than Wood certainly, Check's work in comic books was short-lived, from December 1951 through 1958 mostly, with a smattering of work done sporadically in the early 70s (for DC Comics' War titles)... He remains a veritable mystery to even the most hardcore comic fans to this very day, as precious little has ever been documented concerning him. He illustrated for Amazing Stories during the mid-1970s. His name is sometimes mistakenly given as \"Sydney\" though he signed \"Sidney\" on some art."

  "text" : "Sam Hanna Bell (1909 – 1990) was a novelist, short story writer, playwright, and broadcaster who lived in Northern Ireland. He was born in Glasgow to Ulster Scots parents. Following the death of his father he was brought at the age of seven to be reared in the Strangford Lough area of County Down, where his acclaimed novel of Ulster rural life, December Bride (1951), would be set. He moved to Belfast in 1921, where he worked at a variety of manual jobs before securing a post with the BBC in 1945. He was a co-founder of the left-leaning literary journal Lagan in 1943. His first collection of short stories, Summer Loanen, was published in 1943. His novels include December Bride (1951), The Hollow Ball (1961), A Man Flourishing (1973) and Across the Narrow Sea (1987). Bell was recruited to the BBC, in 1946, along with fellow writer, W.R.Rodgers, by the Irish poet and radio producer, Louis MacNeice. (Sean MacMahon, 1999, Sam Hannah Bell: a biography, Belfast: The Blackstaff Press, page 44). Some of his work as a radio producer was highly innovative. 'This is Northern Ireland, An Ulster Journey' of 1949 is a classic radio feature incorporating actuality, poetry, music and narration. in later work Hanna Bell incorporated the voices of 'ordinary people' in his attempt to paint a picture of Ulster as rooted in the lives and traditions of its people. His collaboration with W.R.Rodgers, The Return Room (1955) is one of the most important post-war Irish radio features and shows the influence of Dylan Thomas on Rodgers the poet. In 1977 he was honoured with an MBE in recognition of his contribution to the cultural life of Northern Ireland. December Bride was made into an acclaimed film in 1990. Reviewing the film, Irish Times columnist and literary critic Fintan O'Toole said it was \"not just a remarkable artistic achievement, but also a remarkable political one...restoring a richness and complexity to a history that has been deliberately narrowed\". In April 1999 December Bride was selected by award-winning novelist and critic Colm Tóibín and publisher, writer and critic Carmen Callil for inclusion in The Modern Library: The 200 Best Novels in English Since 1950 (Picador). Sam Hanna Bell died in 1990 just before the premiere of the film of December Bride. On 15 October 2009, a blue plaque was unveiled by Northern Ireland Culture Minister Nelson McCausland on the Belfast house where Sam Hanna Bell wrote December Bride. (Such plaques are erected to commemorate and honour notable people.)"

  "text" : "Sarah “Sally” Christine Wolfe (25 December 1885 – 15 July 1975) was a medical missionary who served in China from 1915-1951, despite working amidst much political turmoil. She came from a strong Methodist family and upon leaving Ireland, became part of the Methodist Missionary Society. When she arrived in China, Wolfe joined the Jubilee Women’s hospital at the Wesleyan Mission in Hankow, where she worked among other European missionaries and ran Bible classes for women and children. Wolfe’s time in China was marked by much political strife, as she arrived four years after the Chinese Revolution of 1911 and witnessed the Chinese Civil War, which began in 1927. In 1951, after serving the Chinese people for nearly forty years, Sally Wolfe left China due to strong xenophobia towards foreign missionaries and conflict between Communists and the Kuomintang (Chinese Nationalist Party)."

  "text" : "Solon Wesley Pierce (March 7, 1831 – September 23, 1903) was an American politician, author, attorney, and newspaper publisher/editor. Pierce was born in Yorkshire (Cattaraugus County), New York in 1831, studied at the Mendon Academy in Monroe County, NY and settled in Adams County, Wisconsin in 1854, taking up practice as a lawyer in the county seat of Friendship when he was admitted to the bar in 1858. He was first elected district attorney of Adams County in 1861, and the same year (with several associates) founded the Adams County Press, just a few weeks after the outbreak of the US Civil War. Pierce remained as editor and publisher of this newspaper (one of the first published in Adams County) for the majority of the next 40 years until his death in 1903. In 1864 Pierce enlisted in the Union army, was commissioned a First Lieutenant, and saw action (with the regiments that made up the 9th Army Corps, Army of the Potomac) at the Siege of Petersburg, among other battles toward the end of the Civil War. These experiences formed the basis of his 1866 book Battle Fields and Camp Fires of the 38th Regiment, published by the Daily Wisconsin Printing House of Milwaukee. After his honorable discharge in 1865, Pierce resumed his law practice and newspaper duties, serving several years as county judge, and beginning in 1870 was elected as a legislator to the Wisconsin Assembly, being re-elected to the same body in 1877, 1878, 1880, 1881, 1882, and 1897. He served as chairman of the Assembly's judiciary committee in 1880, 1881, and 1882. As Adams County district attorney in 1892, he instituted the first successful gerrymander suit in the state of Wisconsin. He is also credited with being the author of an 1882 amendment to the Wisconsin state constitution which provided for biennial elections of legislators. Pierce died at his home in Friendship, Wisconsin."

She is author of more than 20 books,including The Soul of an Octopus: A Surprising Exploration into the Wonder of Consciousness, which was a finalist for the 2015 National Book Award for Nonfiction and was a New York Times Bestseller. Her most popular book is The Good Good Pig, the bestselling memoir of life with her pig, Christopher Hogwood. Her other notable titles include Journey of the Pink Dolphins, Spell of the Tiger, and Search for the Golden Moon Bear. She has been described as \"part Indiana Jones, part Emily Dickinson\". Her book for children, Quest for the Tree Kangaroo: An Expedition to the Cloud Forest of New Guinea was the recipient of the 2007 Orbis Pictus Award and was selected as an Honor book for the ALA Sibert Award. For a half-hour National Geographic TV segment, she scripted and appeared in Spell of the Tiger, based on her book of that title. Also for National Geographic TV she developed and scripted Mother Bear Man based on the work of Ben Kilham, who raises and released orphaned black bears, which won a Chris Award. Author Vicki Croke asked Sy what she has learned, not just about an animal’s natural history, but lessons about life. Sy answered: “How to be a good creature. How do you be compassionate?… I think that animals teach compassion better than anything else and compassion doesn’t necessarily just mean a little mouse with a sore foot and you try to fix it. It means getting yourself inside the mind and heart of someone else. Seeing someone’s soul, looking for their truth. Animals teach you all of that and that’s how you get compassion and heart.”"

  "text" : "Stephen J Smith is a Senior Investigator at the Allen Institute for Brain Science. Previously, Dr. Smith was Professor of Molecular and Cellular Physiology at the Stanford University School of Medicine. In 1990, Smith published an article in the journal Science, which proposed that certain glial cells in the human brain known as astrocytes would be able to communicate through chemical signals, rather than electrical. By utilizing the neurotransmitter glutamate, he was able to show that these cells, which had once been perceived as inert tissue between neurons, in fact were actively communicating with the rest of the brain. This discovery showed that astrocytes likely play an important role in learning and memory. Since Smith's discovery, astrocytes have become an increasingly important part of neural research. Smith has also been a primary leader in the development of array tomography (AT), a proteomic imaging method of volumetric microscopy, in which ultrathin sections of a plastic-embedded tissue are sliced using an ultramicrotome, bonded in an ordered array to a glass coverslip, stained, and imaged. The public methodology for this technique was introduced in a 2007 article in the scientific journal Neuron (journal) with Kristina Micheva, and was expanded upon in a 2010 article, also in Neuron (journal), with Micheva, Brad Busse, Nicolas Weiler, and Nancy O'Rourke. In utilizing array tomography, Smith and his colleagues created three-dimensional models of brains in mice, achieving a level of detail previously unattainable. Smith received his Ph.D. from the University of Washington in 1977, after which he conducted postdoctoral research at the University of California, Berkeley from 1977 to 1980. He accepted a faculty position at Yale University in 1980 before relocating to Stanford in 1989."

  "text" : "Sorita d'Este is an author, folklorist, occult researcher and prominent teacher. She was initiated into Alexandrian Wicca in the early 1990s, but renounced her involvement with the tradition in 2016. She is also a leading authority in the Goddess spirituality and the author of 18 books. She was born in Cape Town, South Africa in the 1970s. Sorita currently resides in Glastonbury, England, from where she continues to run her independent publishing company Avalonia, named after the town's mythical origins as the isle of Avalon. In an interview with Pagan Dawn Magazine (Issue 195, May 2015) celebrating 10 years of Avalonia Sorita writes \"My primary goal has never been commercial. I am far more occupied in learning and expanding on my knowledge of the esoteric world. It is an incredible bonus that I am able to earn a living from it and spend my time working with some of the most fabulous researchers, artists and esoteric teachers!\" She is the founder of The Covenant of Hekate, an international organisation dedicated to The Goddess Hekate as The Cosmic World Soul. She lit a flame on behalf of The Covenant of Hekate at the multifaith Glastonbury 2012 Harmony and Healing event held at the Chalice Well Gardens, Glastonbury on 21 April 2012. The Covenant of Hekate organised The Hekate Triformis Symposium which took place in Glastonbury 2012 and again in June 2013 and September 2014. In an interview with the Spanish magazine Ser Pagano in 2014 Sorita speaks out about her work saying \"My work encompasses my own passions, which includes a wide range of traditions, practices and history pertaining to the Western Mystery Tradition and I am always happy to hear that others find the work I have done useful for reference and indeed practice. I first encountered Hekate as a child,through classical literature and poetry, but it was not until 2000 that I first encountered Hekate in a meaningful and magical way.\" She was a keynote speaker at CWED (10ª Conferência de Wicca & Espiritualidade da Deusa) in São Paulo, Brazil in August 2014 alongside Claudiney Prieto, Deborah Lipp and Zsuzsanna Budapest. She led the World Goddess Day celebrations in Glastonbury in September 2014. In Urthona, a journal of Buddhism and the Arts she describes Magic as \"In Western magic ‘magical powers’ – whatever they might be – can be both worldly (as in the case of witchcraft or sorcery), or transcendental (as in theurgy) and for me they simply are. In this respect I would say that magic is a harbinger of change, and the proof of it is in the effects it enacts on the practitioner and through that on the world around the practitioner. The techniques through which magic is practiced could also be considered in the same way as technology: it works, and if necessary it can be easily adapted by an experienced practitioner, with the relevant knowledge, to fit different spiritual paradigms.\" In September 2013, she was named as one of The Wisdom Keepers of The Goddess Spirituality Movement by SageWoman Magazine, recognising her work as an author, but also as a folklorist and priestess. She is described by the journalist and psychic celebrity Inbaal in an article which appeared in Alternative London Magazine (2004), saying that \"...you're struck by her dimples and long limbs, her exotic beauty. Feast them again, having heard she's a Wiccan High Priestess, a lecturer on Witchcraft and The Occult and a full-time writer and researcher, and you're struck by how very normal she is\". In 2010, she facilitated an international ceremony to The Goddess Hekate, The Rite of Her Sacred Fires, in which several thousand individuals participated. The Rite of Her Sacred Fires is now a yearly celebration which takes place annually in celebration of unity and mysticism between those who honour the liminal torchbearing Goddess, and is available in more than twenty languages. The Reverend Mark Townsend, in his book Jesus Through Pagan Eyes, includes an interview with Sorita. In it, she describes Jesus as “...a man who reached a state of enlightenment and then sought to share the vision of perfection He had experienced...”. Her work often crosses the boundaries of tradition, Pagan and Christian, Buddhist and Gnostic. In March 2013., The Somerset Gazette reported that Sorita was to lecture at the Abbey House retreat centre in Glastonbury, giving the first of a series of talks on spirituality in Glastonbury organised by the Friends of the Abbey House on her experiences as a Wiccan High Priestess and the founder of the Covenant of Hekate. In an interview with the TWPT (The Wiccan and Pagan Times), in 2012., Sorita stated that “God doesn’t belong to a religion. I have a very strong adherence to this simple truth, no church or synagogue or coven or temple can ‘own’ God! Rather, I believe that all good religious traditions are united in their search for an understanding and experience of God, or ‘The Divine’”. Sorita is a regular speaker at Witchfest International, Pagan Federation and other esoteric and religious related events in the United Kingdom, including The Glastonbury Goddess Conference. She has been featured on the BBC, The Guardian Newspaper, Sunday Times, WitchTalk. Aeon Byte (Gnostic Radio) and The Discovery Channel."

  "text" : "Stanley A. Piltz (November 24, 1887 - January 16, 1973)  was a California photographer and publisher of Mid-Century Modern graphic design and printed ephemera. Stanley A. Piltz Company, San Francisco, issued many Linen Type postcards from the 1930s to the 1950s, depicting scenes of California, especially of the San Francisco Bay Area and the 1939 Golden Gate International Exposition. They consisted primarily of scenic views, city, town, civil and military infrastructures and national monuments views. Linen Type postcards were produced on paper with a high rag content which gave the postcard a fabric type look and feel. At the time this was an inexpensive process. Along with advances in printing technique, linen type cards allowed for vibrant ink colors. Stanley Piltz pioneered the Linen Type postcards with his \"Pictorial Wonderland Art Tone Series\". Curt Teich was the most prominent and largest printer and publisher of Linen Type postcards, based in Chicago. Stanley Piltz was one of the most prominent publishers on the West Coast. Curt Teich printed most of the Linen Type postcards for Piltz utilizing Teich's \"C.T. Art-Colortone\" printing method. Other publishers in California include Burton Frasher in Pomona, Western Publishing and Novelty Company, Tichnor Art Company in Los Angeles, B. W. White in Monterey and Stephen H. Willlard in Palm Springs."

  "text" : "Stefano Lorenzini (born around 1652, Florence, Italy — date of death unknown) was an Italian physician and noted ichthyologist. He studied medicine in Pisa and surgery at the Hospital of St. Florence Maria Nuova, with teachers including Francesco Redi, Nicholas Steno, John Fynch among other prominent scholars. He fell into disgrace with the Grand Duke Cosimo III de 'Medici, who imprisoned him along with his brother Lorenzo Lorenzini, a famous mathematician. His observations on sharks, published in Florence in 1678, offers an example of the extraordinary depth study on animal anatomy and physiology, based on new mechanistic and corpuscular perspectives applied to the study of the living. He is most famous for the discovery of the so-called Ampullae of Lorenzini, special electromagnetic sense organs possessed by the Elasmobranchii (sharks and rays), which are located in front of the head and form a network of canals filled with gel."

Bosworth was born in New York City and raised in Washington Heights, the child of a shipping clerk and homemaker who had immigrated from Russia. He was drafted into the American Army during the Second World War, where he was a codebreaker stationed in Germany. Afterwards, he lived in Paris, studying poetry and philosophy at the Sorbonne, and would later go on to earn an advanced degree in philosophy at New York University, where he taught for some time. Bosworth would go on to teach French at the now-defunct Walden School on the Upper West Side. In 1965, he was selected as the first headmaster at Saint Ann's, where he was known for his eccentric, aphoristic leadership. His son, Adam, is Vice President of Product Management at Google."

  "text" : "Schoschana Rabinovici (née suzanne Weksler) is of Lithuanian-Jewish heritage. She is a Holocaust survivor and the author of “Dank meiner Mutter\", which was published in the USA in 1998 under the title Thanks to My Mother. Described as “Particularly grim, even for a Holocaust memoir”, Thanks to My Mother was described by one reviewer as “one of the most moving memoirs I have ever read of the Holocaust”. The same reviewer writes that readers whose interest include Holocaust testimonies and are “mentally prepared for the harshness of Rabinovici's experiences, will come away with renewed appreciation of the extraordinary fortitude required to survive those dire times”. The book gives a rare, detailed view of Jewish life in Vilnius, Lithuania during German occupation and contains gritty descriptions of life in the Vilnius Ghetto and the circumstances of those deported from the ghetto for slave labor in Germany. It is written from the viewpoint of a young girl from the age of about eight to twelve. Writes JWeekly.com...“It is also the story of Raja Indursky-Wexler’s profoundly transcendent love for her daughter…the daughter’s memoir is at once riveting, blood-chilling, heartbreaking and, ultimately, awe-inspiring.” The book is designated as an American Library Association notable book and is the 1999 winner of the Mildred L. Batchelder Award. The award seeks to recognize translations of children's books into the English language (in this case by James Skofield from the original German), with the intention of encouraging American publishers to translate high quality foreign language children's books."

By 1982 she had completed a solo tour of Europe, where she sang in women's crisis centers, bookstores, shelters and nightclubs focused around women. In the early 1980s she moved to Cambridge, Massachusetts. Abod would eventually be diagnosed with Chronic Fatigue Immune Dysfunction Syndrome and Multiple Chemical Sensitivity in 1986. Despite health struggles, she continued to make music. She'd go on to create an hour-long documentary about her and other women's illnesses, titled \"Funny You Don't Look Sick: Autobiography of an Illness\". The documentary was completed in three years and the premier was held at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston in 1995. In 2004, she produced and recorded a solo CD of her original music, for which was nominated for an Outmusic award for Best Female Debut CD. She lives and works in Santa Fe, New Mexico."

In 1896, she married Samuel Page, who was a science demonstrator at Canterbury Museum and like herself a Quaker. They were to have two sons. With Ada Wells, she was a dominating influence on the Canterbury Women's Institute. She was also active with the National Council of Women of New Zealand and was the organisation's secretary in 1905–06. She was an ardent critic of conscription and upset Prime Minister William Massey and the Minister of Internal Affairs, George Warren Russell, with her criticism. Her son Robin was a conscientious objector and was imprisoned in 1918. Standing for the Labour Party, she failed to get elected to the Christchurch City Council in the 1919 local elections. The three candidates elected in the St Albans ward, which included John Beanland and Ernest Andrews, were all from the right-leaning Citizens Association. Page was elected to the North Canterbury Hospital Board in 1922. When the Labour Party developed into a strong party in the 1920s, Page's extreme left views became less accepted and her influence faded. She died in 1950 and is buried at Sydenham Cemetery next to her husband, who died in 1944."

Since 2007 she has also been a research fellow at the Institute for the Study of Labor. Grossbard founded the Review of Economics of the Household in 2001 and remains its editor in chief.The main focus of her research is household economics, family economics and economics of marriage. A student of Gary Becker at the University of Chicago, she was one of the first economists to enter this research area. Also influenced by the other founder of the New Home Economics, Jacob Mincer, and by James Heckman, another of her Chicago Professors who has made major contributions to the field, she is actively promoting the establishment of household economics as a separate specialty in economics. She is one of the first social scientists to have analyzed consequences of gender imbalance in sex ratio for intra-household distribution, labor supply, fertility and cohabitation. She has shown that variation in sex ratio over time is inversely related to married women's labor supply in the U.S. She tweets as @econoflove."

She demonstrated how women's language in court was influencing social change there, because the courts allowed prototypical women's stories to be heard in a new way. She uses detailed language analysis to show this, drawing on linguistic anthropology. Her second book In Moment of Greatest Calamity, uses linguistic anthropological analysis but also first-person experience to describe her experience as the widow of a victim of the bombing of the U.S. embassy in Kenya -- and as a participant and observer of the subsequent trial of the suspected bombers. She has served as editor of the Political and Legal Anthropology Review and as President of the Association for Political and Legal Anthropology."

  "text" : "Sudhirkumar Saxena (1923 – 2007 in India) was a tabla artist and professor. He learnt the tabla performing art for years from Ustad Habeebuddin Khan, the doyen of the Ajrada gharana. Pandit Saxena was the first drummer in India to have worked as professor of tabla at a centre of higher learning. He retired from Maharaja Sayajirao University, Baroda, in 1983 as head of its music department, after serving the institution for thirty-three years. In his younger days (1945-1995), he participated in most of the major music conferences of the country as a tabla accompanist to many front-ranking musicians and dancers. Spending his formative years in Meerut, he also graduated in Political Science. He in his era, played with most of the stalwarts of Indian Classical Music at that time. The speed of his hands on the \"Baaya\" i.e. the bigger of the two drums in tabla - which is the bass drum; was incredible. When he went to Russia, people were so amazed by the sound it produced that they suspected a pigeon being hidden inside somewhere to produce that sound! He was an extremely humble person and one of the best Gurus one could ever meet. He never declined to teach anyone who came to him for help. Right from teaching seasoned musicians, he taught even naive beginners - sometimes free of cost. His book The Art of Tabla Rhythm - Essentials, Tradition & Creativity is one of the best books written on Tabla. As he used to say, one can never learn Tabla from a book and one always requires a Guru to learn, but this book serves the purpose of reaching out to the world with the lovely traditions of the Indian Classical Music. He was the first guru of tabla player Divyang Vakil."

  "text" : "Sophie Jane Gurney (née Raverat, first married name Pryor; 20 December 1919 – 10 June 2011) was an English artist, linked to many of the leading intellectual and cultural figures of the early 20th century. Gurney was born in 1919, the younger daughter of the French painter Jacques Raverat and his English wife Gwen (née Darwin). Through her mother she was a great-granddaughter of the naturalist Charles Darwin. Her father died in 1925 when she was only five years old, and she and her elder sister Elisabeth were temporarily taken into the care of her first cousin once removed Nora Barlow and her husband Alan. Sophie married the entomologist Mark Pryor in 1940; they had four children. Emily (1942–2008), William (born 1945), Lucy (born 1948) and Nelly (born 1952), who married the film director/farmer Philip Trevelyan. Mark and Sophie Pryor were involved in a road traffic accident in 1967, in which she was relatively unharmed but which left him with brain damage in a persistent vegetative state for almost three years until his death in 1970, aged 51. She also had to deal with her son William's heroin addiction. She subsequently remarried Henry Charles Horton Gurney OBE (1913–1997, known as Charles), professor of mechanical engineering at the University of Hong Kong (1966-1973), who had been Mark's boss at RAE Farnborough. On his retirement, they moved to Totnes, Devon, where Sophie became a member of the 21 Group of artists."

He has been an online and television host and male model, and is pursuing a career in acting. He registered with the Screen Actors Guild as \"Sid Mallya\", saying he chose the stage name to try to avoid being typecast in stereotypical roles. He has appeared in a film entitled Brahman Naman and is expected to appear in another entitled Homecoming. He has also worked as director of the IPL cricket team Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB), which is owned by his father, and as a marketing manager for Guinness (a product of Diageo, a large drinks company closely tied to his father's business)."

  "text" : "Stewart M. Hoover (born April 14, 1951) is a Professor of Media Studies and Professor Adjoint of Religious Studies at the University of Colorado at Boulder. He is the founder and director of the Center for Media, Religion and Culture. His research interest centers on media audience and reception studies rooted in cultural studies, anthropology and qualitative sociology. He is known for his work on media and religion, particularly in the phenomenon of televangelism, and later in religion journalism. His most recent work involves household-level studies of media audience practices of meaning-making and identity. Supported by a series of grants from the Lilly Endowment and the Ford Foundation, this work investigates the extent to which the media sphere as a whole and the various media which comprise it constitute a central site of meaning practice (including religious meaning practice) in contemporary domestic and global life. Through the center he directs, he has also become influential  in scholarly discourses about the public understanding and role of religion globally and the ways those are rooted in its mediation."

  "text" : "Sisinnios Triphyllios (Greek: Σισίννιος Τριφύλλιος, died 26 July 811) was one of the senior dignitaries of the Byzantine Empire during the reign of Empress Irene of Athens (797–802) and her successor Emperor Nikephoros I (802–811). Sisinnios first appears in Irene's unique triumphal procession on Easter Monday, 1 April 799, through the imperial capital, Constantinople. At the time, he held the post of strategos (military governor) of Thrace, the theme closest to Constantinople, and holder of the supreme dignity of patrikios. He was one of the four patrikioi (along with Bardanes Tourkos, Constantine Boilas, and Sisinnios' brother Niketas) leading the four white horses which drew the imperial carriage, a role which marked these men out as the most prominent of Irene's supporters among the high dignitaries of the state. Despite their earlier support of Irene, the Triphyllioi brothers opposed the rising influence of the eunuch Aetios (who replaced Sisinnios as strategos of Thrace with his own brother Leo sometime in 801/802) and the fiscal policies adopted by Irene over the next years. They were thus among the leaders of her overthrow by the General Logothete, Nikephoros I, on 31 October 802. As a patrikios, Sisinnios remained influential under Nikephoros, but is not recorded as having held any specific post. The death of his brother on 30 April 803 is rumoured by some Byzantine chroniclers to have been ordered by Nikephoros, but given Sisinnios' close relations with the emperor throughout the latter's reign, this is unlikely. Sisinnios was among the magnates who accompanied Nikephoros on his campaign against the Bulgars in spring-summer 811, and was among those slain in the disastrous Battle of Pliska on 26 July."

Under his leadership, the University reached a record number of applicants from outside of their primary market and enrolled the largest and most academically talented classes in its history. He is a graduate of Philadelphia University and holds a Master of Science in Instructional Technology. Prior to his arrival at the University of Dayton, he spent more than 10 years at Saint Joseph's University in Philadelphia as Assistant Provost and Assistant Vice President for Enrollment Management; Director of Enrollment Operations and Interim Director of Financial Aid. In addition to being featured in a Forbes article, Sundar, in collaboration with 160over90 agency, was also featured by Adobe, discussing the development of the first fully interactive university viewbook iPad application. The Chronicle of Higher Education has written a feature article  documenting his unique and sometimes controversial approach to higher education marketing,  including a guaranteed tuition plan that eliminates fees.

Consequently, by an extraordinary coincidence, both Newton and Caulfield Grammar School, founded on 25 April 1881, share the same birthday. Newton attended Scotch College, and was a classroom teacher prior to becoming a principal. During his term as Principal at Caulfield, the school became coeducational across all campuses, and opened a campus in Nanjing, China to host its internationalism programme. In 2010, Newton won the Sir James Darling Medal from the Australian College of Educators for his outstanding and sustained contribution to Victorian education, and the Jiangsu Friendship Award, which is the Chinese province's highest award for foreign citizens. He received one of six 2011 John Laing Professional Development Awards from Principals Victoria. He was named as an Officer of the Order of Australia in 2012, for \"distinguished service to education in the independent schools sector, through executive roles with professional organisations and advisory bodies, and to the development of educational development opportunities with China.\""

  "text" : "(This is a Chinese name; the family name is Shieh.) Shieh Chung-liang (Chinese: 謝忠良; pinyin: Xiè Zhōngliáng; Wade–Giles: Hsieh4 Chung1-liang2) is a Taiwanese journalist known for his role in a high-profile libel suit. Shieh received a master's degree in journalism from the University of Minnesota. In 1996, he was Taiwan bureau chief of the Hong Kong-based magazine Yazhou Zhoukan. Teaming with reporter Ying Chan, he co-wrote an article on 25 October reporting that Liu Tai-ying, the business manager of Taiwan's Kuomintang political party, had offered $15 million to US President Bill Clinton's re-election campaign. The article also printed a denial from Liu that he had offered the money. Liu went on to file a criminal libel suit against the pair on 7 November. Chen Chao-ping, a political consultant named as the source of the story, was added as a co-defendant. Liu also filed a civil suit for $15 million in damages. Yazhou Zhoukan defended its reporters and refused to settle the suit outside of court. Calling the trial \"a test case for press freedom in Asia\", The Committee to Protect Journalists filed an amicus brief on the pair's behalf, as did ten major US media companies. The Kuomintang called a special meeting to endorse the libel suit and condemn Shieh and Chan. However, a Taiwanese district court ruled in the pair's favor on 22 April 1997. The ruling was \"hailed as a landmark decision\" for press freedom by media watchdog groups, in part because Judge Lee Wei-shen's decision acknowledged the constitutional right to a free press for the first time in Taiwanese judicial history. In November 1997, The Committee to Protect Journalists gave Shieh and Chan its International Press Freedom Award, \"an annual recognition of courageous journalism\". The award citation stated that \"[Shieh and Chan's] courage sets an example in a region noted for both widespread self-censorship and government intervention in the functioning of the press.\""

  "text" : "Samuel Flores Borrego (a.k.a. Metro 3) (6 August 1972 – 2 September 2011) was a Mexican drug lord and high-ranking lieutenant of the Gulf Cartel. He was a former state judicial policeman who protected the ex-leader of the Gulf cartel, Osiel Cárdenas Guillén. Upon his arrest, Flores Borrego became the right-hand man of Jorge Eduardo Costilla Sánchez, the former leader of the criminal organization. Although born in Matamoros, Flores Borrego was closely linked to the city of Reynosa, Tamaulipas, where he served as the Gulf cartel's regional leader on and off for many years after serving as a policeman during the governorship of Tomás Yarrington (1998–2004) – the peak era of the Gulf cartel. The Mexican authorities believe that Flores Borrego is responsible for the split of the Gulf cartel and Los Zetas, a cartel originally formed by deserters of the Mexican Army Special Forces hired in the late 1990s as the private army of the Gulf cartel. While operating in Reynosa in early 2010, Flores Borrego ordered the abduction and execution of a leader of Los Zetas. After the slaying, Los Zetas demanded Flores Borrego's death and threatened to go to war if the Gulf cartel did not hand over the assassin. Nonetheless, Flores Borrego ignored their demands and consequently broke the organization's alliance. On 2 September 2011, Flores Borrego was found dead along with a local police officer on the outskirts of the border city of Reynosa, Tamaulipas. The Mexican authorities indicated that he had been killed by members within his own criminal group over disagreements and territorial disputes."

Aiken was born in 1799 to Phineas Aiken and Elizabeth Patterson. The Aikens had emigrated from Northern Ireland to the Colony of New Hampshire in 1729, and Phineas Aiken was a farmer, member of the Presbyterian church, and American Revolutionary War veteran. Silas Aiken graduated from Phillips Academy, Andoverin 1819, became a Christian at age nineteen and graduated from Dartmouth College in 1825 as the valedictorian of his class. He then taught and studied at the college for three more years in preparation for the ministry. After this period, Aiken was selected as a pastor of the Congregational Church in Amherst, New Hampshire, one of the largest in the state at the time, and the congregation soon underwent a revival. In 1835 Aiken became the pastor of Park Street Church in Boston. Park Street underwent several revivals during Aiken's tenure at the church. While pastoring Park Street, Aiken visited every member of the church at least once per year. In 1849 Aiken left Park Street to pastor the East Parish Congregational Church in Rutland, Vermont. He later received a D.D. from the University of Vermont. Silas Aiken died in 1869 and had selected a younger co-pastor, Norman Seaver, as a successor and Seaver was serving with Aiken at the time of his death."

  "text" : "Sayed Noorullah Murad (born March 22, 1969) is an Afghan politician, military commander and member of the Afghan cabinet during the presidency of Hamid Karzai. He was born in Kunduz city in the north of Afghanistan. His father is Mawlawi Abdul Jalil Faqiri, a famous religious and social leader of Afghanistan. At the age of 15 Murad migrated to Pakistan, after the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. He attended various educational institutions in Pakistan and graduated from the University of Peshawar with obtaining a bachelor's degree in journalism and later a master's degree in international relations. Despite this, Murad has also obtained a degree equal to a master's in Islamic studies Wifaqul Madares in Multan Pakistan. Murad has followed his father and joined the Jamiat-e-Islami Party during the jihad. During the 1990s he started work as special advisor in political and tribal affairs to Ahmad Shah Massoud, then Afghan minister of defence. He was promoted to the rank of Major General of the Afghan national army and has also worked as chief military commander in southern zone of Afghanistan fighting against the Taliban. Due to a misunderstanding Murad was kept for over a year in the Doab jail (Panjshir province) by Ahmad Shah Massoud and was released in 2001 by intervention of Yunus Qanuni and general Besmillah Muhammadi. After jail he was forced by his father followers to restart his political activities in the current political arena and announced political pluralistic system, hence adopted a new liberal Political party (DA NEJAT AFGHANI GHORZANG) Afghan Salvation Movement. Murad is also chairing an organisation called Islamic Studies Development center (ISDC) to modernise, madredize and enlighten religious sector of Afghanistan and bring it to right direction. He has worked for Afghan Ministry of Education from 2001 to 2004 as general director for international relations and NGO's, and head of the grant management unit (GMU). In 2004 he was promoted to chief secretary of the Independent civil services commission. In July 2005 he was assigned as a member of Afghan Federal Cabinet and Deputy Minister for religious affairs and Hajj. In this position he introduced several reforms to the religious sector in Afghanistan which caused appreciations and opposition from community and government. In September 2009 he resigned because of principle differences with running the administrative system."

  "text" : "Sidney Valentine Haas, M.D. (1870-1964) was a U.S. pediatrician whose research determined a dietary means of combating celiac disease. Haas was born in Chicago and moved to New York City when he was six years old. He attended New York University Medical School and Columbia University's College of Physicians and Surgeons. In 1924, Haas achieved notice when he published a medical paper detailing his use of a banana diet for the treatment of children diagnosed with celiac disease. Haas concluded that bananas enabled the breaking up of starches and the conversion of cane sugar into fruit sugar, which prevented the debilitating diarrhea of celiac disease. Haas’ research led to the development of the Specific Carbohydrate Diet, a nutritional regimen that restricted the use of complex carbohydrates (disaccharides and polysaccharides) and eliminated refined sugar, gluten and starch from the diet. During his career, Haas treated over 600 cases of celiac disease. In 1951, he joined his son, Dr. Merrill P. Haas, in publishing the medical textbook The Management of Celiac Disease."

  "text" : "Sean P. Keating (July 14, 1903 – July 2, 1976) was an Irish Republican Army member who opposed the Anglo-Irish Treaty and later became Deputy Mayor of New York City and Regional Director of the United States Post Office. Keating was born and raised in Kanturk, County Cork, Ireland. He was a volunteer in the Irish Republican Army during the Irish War of Independence and fought for the Anti-Treaty Forces against the Irish Free State during the Irish Civil War. He moved to the United States, where he advocated for Irish nationalist causes and for British withdrawal from Northern Ireland. He was involved in Democratic Party politics and a close associate of Irish activist Paul O'Dwyer and his brother, New York City Mayor William O'Dwyer. Among others, he was involved in the campaigns of President John F. Kennedy and Senator Robert F. Kennedy. Keating left school at the age of 13 to join the Irish Volunteers, which later became the I.R.A., serving in the 4th Cork Brigade. He was arrested by British troops in November 1920 and beaten severely. He was interned Ballykinlar internment camp until December 1921, where he participated in several hunger strikes. Following his release, he opposed the Anglo-Irish Treaty and served in the Fianna Cork 4th Brigade on the Republican side under Sean Moylan during the Irish Civil War. Keating emigrated to New York City in 1927 and became involved in Irish cultural organizations and Democratic party politics. He was one of the founders of American Friends of Irish Neutrality which opposed Irish involvement in World War II, fearing it would result in British re-occupation of Ireland. Following World War II, he was chairman of the executive council of the 1947 Irish Race Convention and president of the American League for an Undivided Ireland, lobbying in support of the Fogarty Amendment, which tied the release of Marshall Plan funds to British withdrawal from Northern Ireland. Between the 1940s and 1960s, he served as president of the County Corksmen Association, president of the United Irish Counties Association and president of the Irish Institute. In 1956, he was honored as Grand Marshal of the New York City St. Patrick's Day Parade. Keating served in various positions under New York City mayors William O'Dwyer, Vincent Impellitteri, and Robert F. Wagner, Jr., rising to the position of Deputy Mayor under Robert Wagner. He was the first to publicly introduce future President Kennedy as \"the next President of the United States\" at an Irish Institute event in 1957. He was appointed Regional Director of the U.S. Post Office by President Kennedy and served in that position from 1961 until his retirement in 1966. Following President Kennedy's assassination, he served as National Chairman of the President Kennedy Memorial Committee, which secured the lands and raised the funds for the John F. Kennedy Arboretum in New Ross, County Wexford, Ireland. In retirement, he returned to Kanturk and continued to advocate for the reunification of Ireland. Keating died at his retirement home in Kanturk in 1976 and is buried there."

Art does set up a particular world and the one that suits my vision of what I see, know, deals with the dark side of experience as well as its enchantment and pleasures. In art, our hopes and desires shape our visions of fulfillment for more than the actual experiences that we may have. My use of color and light that is mysterious is of an interior perception. My formal stance is very much involved with an underlying structure that is insistent to the life of the work. I remain subject ridden and how a vertical divides the space from top to bottom, from my earliest works to the present, is as much subject matter as overt reference to the known world. I prefer to make paintings that are sufficiently individual to be granted their own place.”" ]

  "text" : "Stephen Greene (September 19, 1917 – November 18, 1999) was an American artist known for his abstract paintings and in the 1940s his social realist figure paintings. Stephen Greene was born in New York City and he attended the National Academy School of Art and then the Art Students League. He earned a BFA and a MA at the University of Iowa in Iowa City. He studied with Philip Guston with whom he remained friends until Guston's death in 1980. Greene taught at Princeton University for many years where he was teacher to many well-known figures in the art world including Frank Stella and art critic and historian Michael Fried. Greene had more than 2 dozen solo exhibitions of his work in leading art galleries in New York City. He also taught at the Art Students League of New York for several decades. After the mid-1950s and until his death Greene's mature work was related to abstract expressionism, color field painting and surrealism. His work is represented in numerous public collections, including the Museum of Modern Art, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Whitney Museum of American Art, the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, the Brooklyn Museum, the Houston Museum of Fine Arts, the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, the Carnegie Museum of Art, and the Tate Gallery in London. He died in November 1999 at his home in Valley Cottage, New York, where he had lived for more than 40 years with his wife the novelist Sigrid de Lima (1921–1999) who died two months earlier in September 1999. He was 82 years old. Their daughter, Alison de Lima Greene, is a curator at the Houston Museum of Fine Arts and has published a number of works on modern art."

  "text" : "Sikiru Kayode Adetona (born 10 May 1934) is the Awujale (king) of the Ijebu Kingdom, a traditional state in Nigeria, having reigned since 1960. He is the son of Prince Rufai Adetona and Alhaja Ajibabi Adetona (née Onashile) and represents the Anikinaiya ruling family. Young Prince Adetona, variously attended Baptist School, Ereko, Ijebu Ode; Ogbere United Primary School, Oke Agbo, Ijebu Igbo; and Ansar-Ud-Deen School, Ijebu Ode between 1943 and 1950. For his secondary education, he was at Olu-Iwa (now Adeola Odutola) College, Ijebu Ode from 1951 to 1956. Between 1957 and 1958 he took up appointment with the then Audit Department of the Western Region, Ibadan. The prince resigned his appointment in 1958 to pursue further studies in accountancy in the United Kingdom, which was the colonial ruler of Nigeria at the time. By a letter dated January 4, 1960 referenced CB. 4 1/333, the Permanent Secretary in the Western Region Ministry of Local Government conveyed to the Local Government Adviser in Ijebu Ode approval of the Western Region Governor in Council, the appointment of Prince Sikiru Kayode Adetona as the Awujale of Ijebuland with effect from that date (January 4, 1960). It became the lot of Ijebu notables like the late Ogbeni-Oja, Chief (Dr.) Timothy Adeola Odutola, Bobasuwa, Chief Okunowo; and Asiwaju, Chief Samuel Olatubosun Shonibare to arrange for the home-coming of the King-elect. On January 18, 1960, the Head of the Ijebu Ode Regency Council, the Ogbeni-Oja, Chief Timothy Adeola Odutola formally presented the new traditional ruler to the whole world. This presentation, which was a novelty, signalled the commencement of the installation ceremonies of the king-elect. It was indeed, a new dawn in the annals of Ijebu people. The king-elect thereafter, proceeded to undergo the traditional seclusion at the Odo for three months. Oba Sikiru Kayode Adetona, who had earlier been nominated along with five others by the ODIS was unanimously selected by the king makers in conformity with Section 11 of the Chiefs Law of 1957 applicable in Western Region. The then Governor signed the Instrument of Office approving Prince Sikiru Kayode Adetona as Awujale of Ijebuland. The formal coronation took place on Saturday, April 2, 1960. On Tuesday, April 5, 1960 newly crowned Oba Adetona, took his seat as a member of the Western Region House of Chiefs, after a formal introduction. Oba Sikiru Kayode Adetona was a charismatic Prince, and some Obas and Chiefs nominated him for the presidency of the House of Chiefs. Albeit, an older and traditionally more senior Oba, late Sir Adesoji Aderemi, Ooni of Ife was subsequently elected the President. The thought here was that early as a monarch, the twenty-six-year-old Awujale was a fit and proper king for the exalted position. No doubt, this consideration was an admission of the uniqueness of the Awujale of Ijebuland."

  "text" : "Sigmund Feyerabend (1528– 22 April 1590) was a bookseller and publisher at Frankfort. To him are attributed the woodcuts from the designs of Virgil Solis in a German Bible printed at Frankfort in 1561, and the portraits of the Doges of Venice in Kellner's Chronica, also printed at Frankfort in 1574. He died in 1590. He signed his cuts with SF or a monogram. Several of his relations also were wood-engravers, and one of them, M. Feyerabend, who worked about 1578, executed several figures after Melchior Lorch. His business was highly successful, but his son-in-law, Kuno Wiederhold, married to Katharina Maria Feyerabend, incurred heavy debts, leaving little for the younger, minor son, Karl Sigmund Feyerabend (+ 15 Jul 1609)."

After a career in journalism and printing in Castleford, Yorkshire, Johnson emigrated to New Zealand in the company of William Rawson Brame's Albertland settlers. The Albertlanders intended to set up a model community in New Zealand; Johnson had been appointed the group's editor and printer. He left the group in 1862 after working in Auckland and Dunedin before returning to Albertown in 1863. The settlement collapsed in 1864 and by 1866 Johnson was living in Blenheim where he and brother Thomas established the Marlborough Express. Originally a weekly paper, the Express's circulation eventually increased to twice weekly. Now owned by Australaisan giant Fairfax Media, it prints daily. Johnson was elected to the Marlborough Provincial Council in 1872; he resigned in 1874. He sold his newspaper in 1879 before returning briefly to England. Back in New Zealand from 1884, he lived in Waipawa and worked for the Waipawa Mail and Hawke's Bay Herald. Until his death at age 78, Johnson was active in the Anglican church, the Freemasons, and his local community. He was survived by his wife, Thereza, and their two children."

  "text" : "Samuel Henry Drew (17 November 1844 – 18 December 1901) was a New Zealand jeweller, watchmaker, and amateur naturalist. Samuel Henry Drew was born in Maidenhead, Berkshire, England on 17 November 1844. His parents emigrated to Tasmania, Australia, where he grew up. He was sent to England to learn his father's trade of watchmaking. Shortly after his return to Tasmania, the family emigrated to Nelson, New Zealand. There, he married Catherine Alice Beatson, the daughter of the architect William Beatson, on 8 May 1872. He moved with his wife to Wanganui. He was a significant collector of molluscs, birds, and beetles, and exchanged specimens with Julius von Haast. Andreas Reischek helped him classify his collections on occasions, which were displayed at his family house in Wanganui. When the visiting public put too much pressure on the family, Drew agreed to have his collection given away, and it formed the nucleus of the Wanganui Public Museum, which opened on 24 March 1895. Drew became honorary curator of the museum, but died of a heart attack on 18 December 1901, aged 57. He had had health problems before his death. The museum, which is still in public ownership, is now known as the Whanganui Regional Museum and is located in Drews Avenue, Whanganui."

  "text" : "Sir Christopher Robinson (1766–1833), admiralty lawyer, born in 1766, was son of Dr. Christopher Robinson, rector of Albury, Oxfordshire, and Wytham, Berkshire, who died at Albury on 24 January 1802. The son matriculated from University College, Oxford, on 16 December 1782, but migrated in 1783 to Magdalen College, where he was a demy from 1783 to 1799. He graduated B.A. 14 June 1786, M.A. 6 May 1789, and D.C.L. 4 July 1796. Intended for the church, Robinson preferred the profession of the law. He was one of nine children, and all that his father could spare for his start in life was 20l. in cash and a good supply of books. Fortunately he obtained a favourable recommendation to Sir William Scott, afterwards Lord Stowell. He determined upon studying maritime law, and was admitted into the college of advocates on 3 November 1796. He gained conspicuous success in this branch of the profession, was knighted on 6 February 1809, and was appointed, on 1 March 1809, to succeed Sir John Nicholl as king's advocate. As the holder of this office and the leading counsel in the admiralty court, Robinson was engaged in nearly all the cases relating to prizes captured on the seas. In 1818 he was returned in the interest of the tory ministry, exerted through the family of Kinsman, for the Cornish borough of Callington, and on the dissolution in 1820 he and his colleague secured at the poll a majority of the votes recorded by the returning officer, but a petition against their return was presented, and ultimately the candidates supported by the family of Baring were declared elected. These proceedings resulted in his being saddled with costs amounting to 5,000l., and though the premier had promised to reimburse him the outlay, the money was not paid. He was no orator, and did not shine in the House of Commons. In 1821 Robinson followed Lord Stowell in the positions of chancellor of the diocese of London and judge of the consistory court, and on 22 February 1828 he succeeded Lord Stowell as judge of the high court of admiralty, having for several years previously transcribed and read in court the decisions of that judge. He was created a privy councillor on 5 March 1828, and presided in the admiralty court until a few days before his death. He died at Wimpole Street, Cavendish Square, London, on 21 April 1833, and was buried in the churchyard of St. Benet's Doctors' Commons. He married, at Liverpool, on 11 April 1799, Catharine, eldest daughter of the Rev. Ralph Nicholson, a man of considerable property. They had five children—three sons and two daughters. Lady Robinson died at Wimpole street on 27 August 1830, aged 53. Robinson's second son was William Robinson. Robinson was the author of: \n* \"Report of the Judgment of the High Court of Admiralty on the Swedish Convoy\", 1799. \n* \"Translation of Chapters 273 and 287 of the Consolato del Mare, relating to Prize Law\" [anon.], 1800. \n* \"Collectanea Maritima, a Collection of Public Instruments on Prize Law\", 1801. \n* \"Reports of Cases argued and determined in the High Court of Admiralty, 1799 to 1808\", 6 vols. 1799–1808; 2nd edit. 6 vols. 1801–8; they were also reprinted at New York in 1800–10, and by George Minot at Boston in 1853 in his series of English admiralty reports. Robinson's reports were not remunerative, and in some years caused him actual loss. Robinson's own judgments were contained in volumes ii. and iii. of John Haggard's \"Admiralty Reports\" (1833 and 1840), and were also published at Boston by George Minot in 1853. A digested index of the judgments of Lord Stowell, as given in the reports of Robinson, Edwards, and Dodson, was issued by Joshua Greene, barrister-at-law, of Antigua, in 1818."

Badawi was imprisoned under a warrant relating to the disobedience charge on 4 April 2010, released on 25 October 2010 after a local and international support campaign, and her guardianship was transferred to an uncle. The Saudi Arabian NGO Human Rights First Society described Badawi's imprisonment as \"outrageous illegal detention\". Badawi filed a Grievances Board lawsuit against the Ministry of Municipal and Rural affairs for the rejection of her registration for the 2011 municipal elections. She participated in the 2011–2012 women driving campaign by driving regularly since June 2011 and helping women drivers with police and court procedures. In November 2011, she and Manal al-Sharif filed charges in the Grievances Board against the Saudi Arabian General Directorate of Traffic for rejecting their applications for drivers' licences. On 8 March 2012, Badawi was given an award by the United States Department of State for her contributions to women's rights."

  "text" : "(This is an Indonesian name; it does not have a family name.) Sjumandjaja (Perfected Spelling: Syumanjaya; 5 August 1934 – 19 July 1985) was an Indonesian director, screenwriter, and actor. During his career he wrote numerous films, directed fourteen, acted in ten, and produced nine; he also won five Citra Awards from the Indonesian Film Festival. His films reflected social realism. Sjumandjaja was born in Batavia (modern day Jakarta), Dutch East Indies, and grew up there. During high school, he became interested in creative writing and acting, eventually joining the Senen Artists' Group. In 1956, when one of his short stories was adapted into a film, Sjumandjaja became active in the filmmaking industry, writing two films for the production company Persari. After receiving a government scholarship, he moved to Moscow and attended the All-Union State Institute of Cinematography. Upon returning to Indonesia in 1965, Sjumandjaja took a job at the Ministry of Information and continued writing screenplays. In 1971, after leaving the ministry, he directed his first feature film, Lewat Tengah Malam (Past Midnight). He continued to write and direct films until his death from a heart attack on 19 July 1985. Reportedly a strict director, Sjumandjaja valued creative value over receiving a director's fee. He married three times and had three children, two with his first wife and one with his second. His son, Sri Aksana, is the former drummer of Dewa 19, and his daughter Djenar Maesa Ayu is also a Citra Award-winning director."

Figures of yaks silhouetted against the skyline give an idea of the scale of the landscape, while skies in bold brushstrokes of vivid colour create a sense of natural drama. The landscape encompasses marshland, home to flocks of migrating birds, and the high grasslands where only the song of the wind can be heard. Shi Zhonggui depicts the landscape from dawn to dusk and at different seasons of the year, from icy blue winter scenes, to the melting snows and new flowers in springtime in Tibet, to the warmth of summer days on the high plateau. His paintings have a sense of both freedom and tranquillity."

  "text" : "Samuel Wilbur, Jr. (1622 - after 1678) was an early settler of Portsmouth in the Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations, and one of seven original purchasers of the Pettaquamscutt lands which would later become South Kingstown, Rhode Island. His father, Samuel Wilbore, had been an early settler in Boston who was dismissed from the Massachusetts Bay Colony for supporting the dissident ministers Anne Hutchinson and John Wheelwright, becoming one of the signers of the compact that established the town of Portsmouth. The subject Samuel was willed his father's Rhode Island lands, and appears to have lived in Portsmouth most of his life. He married Hannah Porter, the daughter of another signer of the Portsmouth Compact, John Porter. Beginning in 1656 Wilbur held a number of important positions within the colony, including Commissioner, Deputy to the General Assembly, Assistant to the Governor, and Captain in a Troop of Horse. He wrote his will in August 1678, though it was not probated until more than three decades later. Wilbur was held in high esteem within the colony and was one of a small group of men named in the Royal Charter of 1663, signed by King Charles II of England, and becoming the guiding document of Rhode Island's government for nearly two centuries."

His parents traveled away and consigned him at age three to thirteen to his aunt. He then moved to Brescia to live with his mother, who worked in wool looms. He at first practised wood-engraving, but afterwards studied painting under Antonio Dusi of Brescia and then, with Francesco Monti (Bologna). He studied in 1776 at the Accademia Clementina of Bologna. He settled at Brescia in 1773, and in 1810 became professor of drawing in the Art academy of that city. He died in Brescia. Among Cattaneo's pupils are Domenico Vantini, Luigi Basiletti, Antonio Manenti, and Carlo Frigerio. Professor Romualdo Turini of Salò was a pupil and his biographer."

In 1972 he opened his own discothèque Big Brother. He opened his fourth discothèque Confetti in 1984, a gay discothèque, and also worked as resident DJ at various other discothèques throughout the years.

  "text" : "Sergio Zanni (born in Ferrara, 1942) is an Italian painter and sculptor.After obtaining the Diploma at the Institute of Arts 'Dosso Dossi' in Ferrara, Italy, he graduated from the Academy of Arts (Accademia delle Belle Arti) in Bologna. He taught in the Institute of Arts 'Dosso Dossi' until 1995.For his research in sculpturing he utilized backed clay and, successively, lighter material for sculptures of large dimensions. Vittorio Sgarbi have defined Zanni a \"surrealism from the Po Plain\". Sergio Zanni defines his research in arts and sculpture: “My job allows me to continuously travel in order to discover unknown sites. These sites have been materialized in several characters: hermits, rain men, killers, war memorials, devils, attendants of the plains, gypsies, observers, hikers. Deep-sea divers, water, front-less characters, pilots, cloud hunters, oblomov, smokers, painters of war, mysterious angels, with no front, siren’s songs, and go on until to the last sculptures, the equilibrists, Ulysses and other hikers. Near the end of the 20s century I wonder about realizing large sized sculptures: the loved backed clay is regrettably heavy and fragile. I was forced in some way to test more handy and less noble materials than the backed clay. In this last step the experience with the polystyrene covered by kryptonite and iron balls (all very recent materials used on the stages), fibreglass, iron rods and assemblages with iron material took place. From these materials my largest sculptures aroused: kamikazes, the wagon of the winners, the six white pilots, the large traveller.\""

Mr. Lett also has participated in committees and conferences of the United Nations, the International Telecommunication Union, and the International Maritime Organization, where topics included improved access to information and communications technologies for the world’s poor, greater efficiency in the international management of radio spectrum and satellite orbits, and the use of technology to advance maritime safety and security. He has testified about satellite matters before the U.S. Senate. Prior to joining the State Department in 1989, Mr. Lett was a member of the U.S. Federal Communications Commission's International Conference Staff and Common Carrier Bureau. There he worked on rule-making proceedings related to the international telecommunications market, and headed delegations to resolve radio-interference concerns impacting satellite operations of the United States and other countries.

Kordek is credited with designing over 100 pinball machines. The last game Kordek helped design was 2003's Vacation America, based on the National Lampoon's Vacation movies. Among the companies that Kordek designed for are Genco, Williams and Bally. Kordek was credited with many innovations to pinball machines. He revised the  pin game machines of the 1930s by putting two inward-facing flippers at the bottom of the playing field that were controlled by two buttons on the side of the machine. Other innovations still used today are drop targets and multi-ball mode. Kordek died on February 19, 2012, at age 100."

  "text" : "Stephen Werlick (1932–2010) was an American sculptor from New York. He completed public and private commissions and participated in group and solo exhibitions in Rome, New York, and California. He was an instructor of sculpture at California State University, Long Beach from 1964 to 1999, greatly influencing sculpture and public art especially in the Los Angeles and Orange County areas in addition to the art students who came to study with him from throughout the U. S. and abroad. Early Years: Werlick grew up in the Bronx. He studied at Cooper Union Art School, New York, where he took courses with Milton Hebald, John Hovannes, George Kratina and Leo Amino. He earned an M.F.A. in Sculpture from Tulane University’s Newcomb Art School, studying with George Rickey. He received a Fulbright Fellowship, 1956–1958, to Munich, Germany, where he studied sculpture and bronze casting with Heinrich Kirchner. Werlick also was awarded the Rome Prize 1961–1964, to the American Academy in Rome, Italy. His earlier work celebrates societal human conditions as depicted in monument-like groupings of figures interacting with and through various angled planes. The feminine form is celebrated in his classical bronze figures, portraits and reliefs. His mid-career brought several commissions, among them the FINA Prize Sculpture for the Munich Olympics and World Swimming Competitions, a commission for a Holocaust memorial for Temple Judea in Southern California, a Processional Cross for the Loyola Marymount University Chapel, a bronze crucifix and candelabra for St. Joseph’s Cathedral in Los Angeles. The FINA sculpture is in the Fort Lauderdale Sports Hall of Fame. In his later years his work took on more whimsical, spontaneous and expressive forms. Adding to his extensive body of work are his transformations of wood into “tools”, undulating pieces that are wonderful to behold and touch."

  "text" : "Steven A. Gallacci (born 1955) is best known for creating and publishing Albedo Anthropomorphics, a black and white alternative comic containing anthropomorphic funny animal characters, which has been considered a major factor in the origins of furry fandom. Gallacci spent six years in the US Air Force as a graphics specialist, including a tour of duty in Germany. After leaving the military, Gallacci started Albedo under his own Thoughts & Images imprint. First published in 1983, Albedo's last issue was published in 2005 under the Shanda Fantasy Arts imprint. Among some of the story lines that have appeared in Albedo are Gallacci's own \"Erma Felna: EDF\", a military sci-fi epic featuring some elements of political intrigue, and Stan Sakai's Usagi Yojimbo, which first appeared in the infamously rare Albedo #2. Gallacci also worked on Fusion, a SF adventure comic from Eclipse Comics similar to the TV show Firefly, though pre-dating it by nearly twenty years. Lela Dowling co-authored the artwork and Steve Barnes drafted the first issues, though Gallacci would write most of the later ones with Lex Nakashima. He also created \"Birthright\", an indirect sequel to Erma Felna, serialized in the Fantagraphics title \"Critters\". The first three issues of Donna Barr's \"the Desert Peach\" and a single issue of his own fantasy adventure \"Zell, Sworddancer\" with art assistance by Steve Adams, was also published under his Thoughts & Images imprint. Thoughts & Images also published the first edition of Albedo RPG, written by Craig Hilton and Paul Kidd, and based on the Erma Felna storyline from Albedo. Additional editions and supplements were published by Chessex in the early 1990s. An all-new version of an Albedo RPG has been published by Sanguin. Galacci provided art for episodes of Elin Winkler's \"Tales of the Fehnnik\", published by Radio Comix, and short bits for Ken Fletcher's \"Spontoon\" fanzine. He has also done Science Fiction art and illustration since the late 1970s, as well as straight technical/commercial illustration. He occasionally produces silver bullets for his Argent Small Arms line of replica firearms. More recently, he has been creating masters for after-market scale model aircraft detail/correction/conversion sets. Gallacci lives in Seattle with his two dogs. His wife of twenty-two years, the long time SF and media fan Beverley Clark, died 16 September 2007."
