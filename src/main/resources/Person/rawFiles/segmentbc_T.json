  "text" : "Taylor Marsh (born 1954), the pseudonym for Michelle Marshall, is an author, political analyst, writer and strategist, as well as founder and publisher of the new media blog TaylorMarsh.com. Marsh lives in the Washington, D.C. area with her husband. Marsh is best known for being a \"die hard Clintonite,\" as the Washington Post described her in a 2008 profile, \"For Clinton, A Following Of 'Marshans'.\" However, Marsh started out skeptical of Hillary Clinton, as the National Journal's Hotline OnCall revealed early in 2007. \"TaylorMarsh.com\" became a central hub for Hillary supporters during the 2008 primary election cycle. It's part of the reason why The New Republic profile of her in 2008, \"The Hugh Hefner of Politics,\" chronicled Marsh's professional career. She's a contributor to The Huffington Post, as well as other new media sites, reporting from the 2008 Democratic Convention for Pajamas Media, covering SEIU events, and the AFSCME Democratic debate during 2007, and has written for many other new media sites. Taylor Marsh was born in Columbia, Missouri, but spent most of her life growing up in St. Louis, raised by her mother after her father died. She came of age during the modern feminist movement, which imprinted politics in her persona. Gloria Steinem, the woman who impressed Marsh as the spokeswoman for the women's liberation movement, represented a new breed of smart, beautiful women who wanted more than what was possible for their mothers and were determined to make it happen. Taylor competed in the beauty pageant scene to pay for college, starting with Miss Teenage St. Louis and earning the title of \"Miss Friendship\" in the Miss Teenage America Pageant. Years later, she was crowned Miss Missouri, of 1974 going to the Miss America 1975 pageant. NOW picketed the year she was in the pageant, confronting Marsh one day in front of reporters as she came out of her hotel. One angry National Organization for Women supporter got in her face and asked: \"How can you demean yourself like this?\" Marsh simply replied: \"You want to pay for my college tuition?\" Marsh went to Stephens College in Columbia, Missouri, a liberal arts school, on scholarship, where she performed in the modern dance troupe and as lead dancer in productions, as well as the drama department's \"Sweet Charity\", in the lead role of \"Charity.\" Marsh graduated with a B.F.A. in three and one-half years."

He invented a process for preparing magnesia alba in 1771 and became known as \"Magnesia\" Henry. He was a founder and afterwards president of the Manchester Literary and Philosophical Society. In 1776, Thomas Henry speculated tongue in cheek that Joseph Priestley’s newly discovered dephlogisticated air (now called oxygen) might become “as fashionable as French wine at the fashionable taverns”. He did not expect, however, that tavern goers would “relish calling for a bottle of Air, instead of Claret”. After Priestley's publication of a method to make carbonated water, Henry manufactured \"artificial Pyrmont and Seltzer waters\" for sale in the late 1770s, imitating the famous sparkling mineral waters, e.g. from Selters."

After a start as a cub reporter on the Melbourne Age, he migrated to London in 1948. He was a reporter, then a sub-editor on the Daily Express, followed by a move to Canada to work on the Toronto Globe & Mail. Returning to Britain in the late 1950s, he joined Granada TV's Searchlight programme (1959–60) in Manchester as a current affairs producer. Hewat is most celebrated for having created in 1963 Granada's revolutionary and long-running World in Action. Hewat later went back briefly to the Daily Express as a senior editorial executive. His second marriage was to Granada casting director Ann Suudi. They had two children. He returned to Australia in the late 1960s and wrote many self-help books. He died aged 76 from injuries sustained in a road accident."

  "text" : "Lieutenant-General Thomas Windsor, 1st Viscount Windsor (c. 1670 – 8 June 1738), styled The Honourable Thomas Windsor until 1699, was an English soldier, landowner and politician. Windsor was the second son of Thomas Hickman-Windsor, 1st Earl of Plymouth, by Ursula Widdrington, daughter and co-heiress of Sir Thomas Widdrington. He was made a Page of Honour to James II in 1685 (a post he held until the king was deposed in 1688) and a few months later was returned to Parliament for Droitwich, despite being only around sixteen at the time. Lord Willoughby de Eresby wanted both him and Peter Legh expelled as minors. Windsor took no part in the proceedings of Parliament and was not re-elected in 1687. During the Monmouth Rebellion of 1685 Windsor had served as a cornet in Lord Plymouth's Horse under his father. He continued to serve in the Army as a captain in Sir John Fenwick's Regiment in 1687, as a lieutenant-colonel in Viscount Colchester's Regiment between 1690 and 1694, as a colonel of horse between 1694 and 1697, 1702 and 1707 and 1711 and 1712 and of the 3rd Dragoon Guards between 1712 and 1717. He was promoted to brigadier in 1702, to major-general in 1704 and to lieutenant-general in 1710. In 1692 he was appointed Groom of the Bedchamber in King William's private household, serving until the King's death in 1702. In 1699 he was elevated to the Peerage of Ireland as Viscount Windsor, of Blackcastle. This being an Irish peerage he was still eligible for election to the English House of Commons, and in 1705 he was once again returned to Parliament for Bramber, a seat he held until 1708. Between 1708 and 1712 he represented Monmouthshire. The latter year he was created an English peer as Baron Mountjoy, in the Isle of Wight, as one of twelve peers created to secure a Tory majority in the House of Lords. Lord Windsor married Lady Charlotte Herbert, daughter of Philip Herbert, 7th Earl of Pembroke, and widow of John Jeffreys, 2nd Baron Jeffreys, in 1703. She died in November 1733. Lord Windsor died in June 1738 and was succeeded in his titles by his son, Herbert."

On 15 April, he was assessed at £3,000 and on 20 September he was assessed at £1,500 by the House of Lords. On 11 April 1645 all his goods and chattels in his house at Westminster were to be seized, inventoried and sold in order to pay off the fine of £1,500. Coventry died in London at the age of about 54. In his will, dated 31 August 1657, he left £500 in charity to the poor of Evesham. Coventry married Mary Craven, daughter of Sir William Craven, former Lord Mayor of London, on 2 April 1627.

  "text" : "Thomas Sclater (later Bacon) FRS (c 1664 – 23 August 1736) was an English lawyer and politician who sat in the House of Commons at various times between 1713 and 1736. Sclater was the son of Edward Sclater of Kingston-upon-Hull, Yorkshire and his wife Frances Thompson, daughter of Leonard Thompson, Lord Mayor of York. His father died when he was young and after 1673 he was brought up by his stepfather Edward Thompson. He was educated at St Paul's School and was admitted at Trinity College, Cambridge on 13 June 1682, aged 17. In 1684 he succeeded to the estates of his great-uncle Sir Thomas Sclater, 1st Baronet of Catley, where he amassed a valuable library. He entered Grey's Inn in 1694 and was called to the bar in 1703. In 1713, Sclater was elected Member of Parliament for Bodmin. He was made a freeman of Cambridge in 1714. In January 1715 he was elected MP for Cambridge and sat until May. On his marriage on 22 May 1716 to heiress Elizabeth Bacon, sister of Peter Standley of Paxton Place, Huntingdonshire, he assumed the name Bacon. He became a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1721. In 1722 he was elected again as MP for Cambridge and sat until his death. He became a bencher of his Inn in 1724. Sclater died of a palsy, worth £200,000 at the age of about 71. Sclater married Elizabeth Bacon who had been probably a ward \"under his charge\", on 22 May 1716. She was the heir of John Bacon, a London merchant who had purchased land at Little Paxton, Huntingdonshire. She died in 1726, which was after Sclater had made a will in 1724 leaving his estate for life to Sarah, the wife of his coachman whom he described as a ‘kinswoman’ with remainder to her two sons."

  "text" : "Timothy E. Quill is an American physician specialising in palliative care at the University of Rochester Medical Center in Rochester, New York. He is also a board member of the Death with Dignity National Center in Portland, Oregon. Quill was the lead plaintiff in a case that eventually reached the Supreme Court of the United States in 1997, Vacco v. Quill, in which the Court decided that a state law against physician-assisted suicide was constitutional. Quill earned his undergraduate degree from Amherst College in 1971, and his M.D. from the University of Rochester School of Medicine and Dentistry in 1976. In 1991, Quill published an article in The New England Journal of Medicine describing how he assisted in the suicide of Patricia Diane Trumbull, a 45-year-old leukemia patient referred to in the article as \"Diane\". The report describes how Patricia, a long-time patient of Quill's with an extensive medical history including vaginal cancer, alcoholism and other issues was diagnosed with leukemia but refused chemotherapy. She shortly thereafter decided that she wanted to kill herself rather than have a \"lingering death\" which doctors had told her may be a matter of weeks or months away. Quill describes in the article how he referred her to the Hemlock Society and a week later she requested barbiturates to help with \"insomnia\". He gave her a prescription and told her the amount required to treat both insomnia and the dose required to bring about death. Some time after getting the prescription, she said her final goodbyes to Quill and her family and took the barbiturates alone. Patricia's husband reported the death to Quill who reported the cause of death as acute leukemia but left off mention of the suicide in reporting it to the medical examiner. When interviewed by the New York Times in 1991, Quill stated that he had not helped anyone else to die before or since. No charges or indictments were brought against Quill. The publication of this story has been considered to have \"made history\" and to have \"stunned the medical community\". Quill has subsequently been active in arguing for legalization of physician-assisted suicide, including during the controversial trials of Jack Kevorkian, and regarding the case of Terri Schiavo. Quill has argued against the principle of double effect in bioethics. In 2013, the American Academy of Hospice and Palliative Medicine included Quill on a list of 'Hospice and Palliative Medicine Visionaries'."

  "text" : "Tony Washington (born February 17, 1986) is a gridiron football offensive tackle for the Edmonton Eskimos of the Canadian Football League. Washington played one year of high school football as a junior while living in New Orleans. That year he was awarded with all-league honors as a member of the Alcee Fortier High School football team. His family moved to Texas after Hurricane Katrina struck New Orleans. After graduating from high school, Washington did not plan to attend college. He decided to go to college, however, after a car salesman suggested he continue his football career. He then enrolled at Trinity Valley Community College in Athens, Texas. While at Trinity Valley Washington served on the 2007 all-Southwest Junior College Football Conference first team. Washington then attended Abilene Christian University, playing on the football team for two years. Both years he was voted the Lone Star Conference Offensive Lineman of the Year. As a teenager, Washington was convicted of \"prohibited sexual conduct\" under Texas law after a consensual sexual relationship with his sister. As a result of the conviction, he was required to register as a sex offender and his conviction was made public. (Arrest of juveniles are otherwise sealed under Texas law). This conviction greatly hindered his efforts to gain a contract to play professional football. Though Washington excelled at the NFL Draft Combine workouts he was undrafted. He was very agile and quick for a lineman, running the 40-yard dash in 5.09 seconds. After leaving school, Washington played for the Dallas Vigilantes of the Arena Football League for two years before signing with the Calgary Stampeders in 2011. He was signed by the Toronto Argonauts of the Canadian Football League on July 4, 2012."

  "text" : "Thomas Michael Burke, CMG (30 June 1870 – 16 February 1949) was an Australian businessman and philanthropist. Burke was born at Norval, near Ararat in Victoria, to Dublin-born miner William Marcus Burke and Aberdeen-born Mary Ann, née Florence. He attended Norval State School and Ararat High School before becoming a railway clerk in 1887, overseeing first Spencer Street Station and then Ararat from 1892. On 25 July 1898 he married Margaret Duggan Brady at St Mary's Catholic Church at Ararat. He was involved in the later stages of the Federation movement as president of the local branch of the Australian Natives' Association (ANA) and vice-president (1900–01) and chief president (1902–03) of the Victorian ANA. Burke was appointed secretary of the Civil Service Co-operative Society of Victoria in March 1902 and was involved in the railway workers' clash with the Irvine government; later that year he resigned from the railways and founded the Civil Service Co-operative Store in Flinders Street. An ardent protectionist, he contested the 1914 federal election as the Labor candidate for Corangamite but was defeated. He sold the Co-operative Store in 1915 and entered the real estate business, and by 1924 was also involved in finance and investment, with offices in Sydney, Newcastle, Brisbane, Adelaide and various country centres. Burke survived the Depression and during the 1930s his company, T. M. Burke Pty Ltd, had established branches in Auckland, Singapore and London. He retired from everyday management of the business in May 1936, but remained chairman of directors. He held several other positions in addition to his business interests, serving as president of the Breeders, Owners and Trainers' Association of Victoria (as an avid horse racer), member (1931–49) and chairman (1936–39, 1944–45) of the Victorian Hospitals and Charities Board, member of the Victorian Council of the Australian Red Cross, and consul for Poland (1933–49). He also gave financial support to the Melbourne University Conservatorium Symphony Orchestra, and donated both land and money to the Catholic Church; he was inaugural national chairman of the Knights of the Southern Cross, accepted a chalice from Pope Pius XI on behalf of Australian Catholic businessman, and lobbied for state aid to Catholic schools. Appointed Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George in 1942, Burke retired to Armadale. He died of cancer in 1949."

  "text" : "Tom Rawling (1916–1996) was a teacher, angler and late-developing poet who wrote what Peter Porter called some of the \"most unforced collections of nature poems for some years\". His favoured subject was the Ennerdale valley in the English Lake District where he grew up in the early twentieth century. Rawling was born in 1916 in Ennerdale, then called Cumberland, now Cumbria. Educated at the village school and then Whitehaven Grammar School, he studied History at University College, London. He spent the Second World War in the Royal Artillery and then returned to teaching. For the next thirty years, he taught in primary, secondary and special schools, returning to Cumbria every year, fly-fishing for sea-trout, often with the late Hugh Falkus. Retiring in 1976, he began to write poetry, joining the group that had formed around Anne Stevenson in Oxford during the mid-1970s. With Stevenson's encouragement, his first poems were published under the title A Sort of Killing, in the Old Fire Station Poets series, an early venture by Neil Astley who went on to found the important Bloodaxe Books poetry press, based in Newcastle. A full collection, Ghosts At My Back, was published by Oxford University Press in 1982. However, to Rawling's disappointment, OUP did not consider his work commercial enough for a second book. Later poems were published by smaller presses: The Old Showfield in 1984 and The Names of the Sea-Trout in 1993. From 1979, Rawling took over the workshop established by Stevenson at the Old Fire Station Arts Centre, George Street, Oxford. Poets associated with this group included Anne Born, Pauline Stainer, Peter Forbes, Helen Kidd, W.N. Herbert, Elizabeth Garrett, Martyn Crucefix and Keith Jebb. Rawling's poem 'Privy' was shortlisted in the Arvon/Observer International Poetry Competition in 1985. A new selection of poems and prose pieces was published under the title How Hall: Poems and Memories - a passion for Ennerdale. There was an accompanying CD of Rawling reading the poems, recorded in 1983."

His various art techniques include painting, photography, computer art, video, and electronic music. Dixon’s imagery is fueled by his love for jazz and electronic music. It explores kinetic connections with his abstract style and reflects a heavy influence of African art and abstract expressionism. Dixon began exhibiting in 1991 while living in Atlanta, Georgia, and landed on the art scene in Chicago at BAREWALLS 2000, a live art exhibition coordinated by the School of The Art Institute of Chicago. His works have been acquired by many private and public collections, such as the Sandor Collection in Chicago, The School of The Art Institute of Chicago, and the David C.

She emigrated to America in 1895 and settled first in New York but later moved to Boston. She married Richard Brayton, a French-Canadian and became well known in Irish-American circles. She published extensively in many American newspapers and magazines and was closely associated with the 1916 Rising. In 1913 she published her first book of poetry called Songs of the Dawn, The Flame of Ireland appeared in 1926 and Christmas Verses in 1934. Her main themes were the exile's nostalgic loss of homeland, nationalism and religion. She visited Ireland frequently and was acquainted with many of the Irish political leaders of the time. She returned permanently to Ireland in 1932 and died in her home in Kilbrook, County Kildare, in 1943. A memorial to her was erected by President De Valera in Kilbrook in 1959. Her best-known poem is \"The Old Bog Road\", set to music by Madeline King O'Farrelly from Rochfortbridge, County Westmeath. It has been recorded by Eileen Donaghy, Josef Locke, Johnny McEvoy, Hank Locklin, Finbar Furey, Anthony Kearns, Daniel O'Donnell, Finbar Wright and many other artists up to the present day."

Sommers was raised in Los Angeles and was originally a dancer. After she visited Nazi Germany in 1933 to study dance and saw the suffering of the Jewish people, she became an activist; in the 1950s she was a volunteer for social and civil rights causes in the South. With the help of her friend Laurie Shields, she successfully lobbied 39 states and Congress to pass displaced-homemaker laws, which offered a network of job training and counseling centers for career housewives who went through divorce or the death of a husband. Sommers coined the phrase \"displaced homemaker.\" She chaired the National Organization for Women's Task Force on older women in the 1970s (it was formed in 1973); she was also a NOW Board member and led the Jobs for Older Women Action Project. She cofounded the Older Women's League with Laurie Shields in 1980, and was its first president. She died of cancer in 1985 at age 71. Some of her papers are held as \"The Tish Sommers Papers\", at the Special Collections Library in San Diego State University. The Institute for Health and Aging established the Tish Sommers Senior Scholars program to honor her; it supports the work of older graduate and postdoctoral students working to improve the lives of older women. In 1991, a biography of her was published titled Tish Sommers, Activist: and the Founding of the Older Women's League, by Patricia Huckle, Univ. of Tennessee Press."

  "text" : "Edward Clavell \"Ted\" Tripp (25 September 1900 – 21 September 1979) was an English-born Australian political organiser and communist. Tripp was born at Acton in London to cigar merchant Clavell John Francis Tripp and Violet Mary, née Vinall. He attended boarding school and, despite taking the University of Cambridge entrance examination, became an apprentice to an engineer. He worked for the Metropolitan Railways in London during World War I and became politically radicalised by the 1917 Russian Revolution. In 1924 Tripp moved to Western Australia and then to Townsville, where he worked on the government railways and joined the Australian Workers' Union and the Communist Party of Australia. In 1929 he ran for the Legislative Assembly of Queensland as an Independent Communist candidate for Mundingburra. He visited Britain, Germany and Moscow later in 1929 and leaned towards Trotskyism, returning to Australia by mid-1930. In 1931 Tripp was a candidate for the 1931 by-election for the House of Representatives seat of Parkes, making him the first endorsed Communist to stand for federal parliament. At the federal election later that year he contested Darling and in 1932 ran for the New South Wales Legislative Assembly seat of King. Despite being president of the Friends of the Soviet Union from 1930 to 1933, he lost favour with the Communist Party and was expelled in 1934, joining the Sydney Trotskyists, a local branch of the Workers' Party of Australia. He became secretary of the Workers' Party in 1935 and edited the organisations journal, the Militant. He fell out with his new party in 1937 and led the League for Revolutionary Democracy (Independent Communist League), a rival group. Tripp moved to Melbourne in 1938 and on 30 July married Ruby May Bullock at Carlton. He worked as a fitter in a munitions factory at Footscray until 1965 but continued his involvement in the radical unionist movement, being appointed tutor at the Victorian Labor College in 1945 and becoming the college's secretary in 1956. In a largely symbolic gesture he joined the Socialist Workers' Party in 1978. He died at Footscray in 1979."

  "text" : "Thomas Mainwaring Penson (1818–64) was an English surveyor and architect. His father and grandfather, who were both named Thomas Penson, were also surveyors and architects. His grandfather Thomas Penson (c. 1760–1824) worked from an office in Wrexham, North Wales, and was responsible for the design of bridges, roads, gaols and buildings in North Wales. His son Thomas Penson (1790–1859) was county surveyor to a number of Welsh counties and also designed bridges. He later moved to Oswestry, Shropshire where he established an architectural practice. Thomas Mainwaring Penson was born in Oswestry, and was educated at Oswestry School. His elder brother was Richard Kyrke Penson who became a partner in the Oswestry practice in 1854, before developing an extensive architectural practice of his own, mainly in South Wales. Thomas Mainwaring Penson trained in his father's practice. Thomas Mainwaring initially designed buildings in the area of the practice, including stations for the Shrewsbury and Chester Railway. He was then appointed as County Surveyor of Cheshire and moved to Chester, Cheshire. Here he laid out Overleigh Cemetery in 1848–50. This has been designated by English Heritage at Grade II in the National Register of Historic Parks and Gardens. He is credited with pioneering the Black-and-white Revival (vernacular or half-timbered) style in the city during the 1850s. His first building in this style was constructed in Eastgate Street in 1852, but it has since been demolished. His other notable buildings in Chester were designed both in Black-and-white Revival and in other styles. They include Crypt Chambers (1858) in Eastgate Street, which is in Gothic Revival style, Queen Hotel (1860–61) opposite Chester railway station, which is Italianate, and Grosvenor Hotel (1863–86) in Eastgate Street, which is constructed in a mixture of timber-framing, brick and stone. These three buildings have all been designated by English Heritage as listed buildings, Crypt Chambers at Grade I, and the other two at Grade II."

  "text" : "Anthony “Tony” Shannon Harman (6 March 1912 – 8 May 1999) was an English farmer and writer who was best known for a 1986 book about his life and the history of his farm entitled Seventy Summers. It was a number one bestseller in the United Kingdom and was made into a 1986 BBC Two television series which he presented. Harman was born near Chesham in Buckinghamshire and he attended Harrow School and Trinity College, Cambridge where he studied agriculture. In 1931, he started farming Grove Farm near Whelpley Hill. He became a published author late in life with an article in The Guardian. In Seventy Summers he advocated modern farming methods and contrasted them with the methods in place when he took over the farm which had barely changed in 150 years. He followed up with The Charolais adventure 1959–1989 (1990) about the introduction of the French Charolais cattle breed and A Thousand Years on a Chiltern Farm: The Story of Grove Farm, Chesham, Buckinghamshire (1999). He also wrote a Guardian column, served as a magistrate, and was a Labour Party parliamentary candidate for Aylesbury at the 1950, 1951, 1955 general elections. He died aged 87 in 1999."

  "text" : "Thomas \"Tom\" Garland (1 June 1893 – 14 February 1952) was a Scottish-born Australian trade unionist. Garland was born in Glasgow to ironworker James Garland and Agnes, née Weldon. He attended primary school but was soon working in engineering shops on Clydeside, where he was a recognised leader among the youths. In 1910 he became an apprentice fitter for the engineering and shipbuilding firm A. & J. Inglis, and also joined the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve. After the outbreak of World War I he became an engine-room artificer and served in HMS Drake until 1915 and HMS Caroline until 1916, being involved in the Battle of Jutland. He trained young artificers at Portsmouth from November 1916 and was invalided out of the navy on 25 September 1919. In 1921 he emigrated to Victoria. In Australia Garland found work with the State Electricity Company. He married Edith Mary Downey at North Fitzroy on 9 February 1924. He was a member of the Amalgamated Engineering Union (AEU) and was later dismissed for his involvement, moving to Adelaide. In 1929 he was elected president of the AEU's Adelaide district committee and a delegate to the Trades and Labor Council. He joined the Communist Party of Australia, was involved in the 1930 waterside workers' strike, and aided those arrested after the 1931 \"beef riot\". Sacked by his employer Holden in 1932, he made several unsuccessful bids for public office, running for the South Australian House of Assembly in 1933 and 1941, the Australian House of Representatives in 1934 and the Australian Senate in 1940. In 1933 he became secretary of the Anti-War Council and his continued and strident opposition to \"capitalist wars\" led to his house being raided in August 1939 after the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact. He addressed a meeting of the League Against Conscription in 1940, for which he was fined, but by 1942, when Australia was under threat of Japanese invasion, Garland had become a supporter of conscription. Towards the end of the war Garland turned his attention to the handling of industrial disputes and reconstruction, and in 1945 resigned from the Communist Party over tactical disagreements. He had co-founded Common Cause, a workers' peace movement, in 1942 and it enjoyed early success, but was disbanded in 1949. His secretaryship of the Gasworkers' Union from 1937 to 1946 had been the first time a Communist Party member had served as a union secretary in South Australia. He was also president of the South Australian Trades and Labor Council from 1936 to 1937 and from 1943 to 1945 and became its secretary in 1946, holding the position until 1949. His past made it difficult for him to find work; he subsequently became secretary-clerk at the McKechnie Iron Foundry. A long-time sufferer from heart disease, he died of coronary thrombosis at Kilkenny in 1952."

  "text" : "Terry Willers (1935 – 9 November 2011) was a noted cartoonist and animator. Willers was born in London but settled in Ireland. He spent most of his later life in Carrigower and for over 40 years in Rathdrum, both in County Wicklow. In 1992, Willers was the co-founder and chairman of the Guinness International Cartoon Festival, which ran for three years in Rathdrum. He was a winner of the Jacobs Award for his work for television. Writing in the Irish Independent, Tom Mathews recalls, \"Nobody who encountered Terry in full flight in his persona as Rathdrum's cartoon ambassador to the world is likely to forget him... Terry must have had three hands because despite having a cigarette in one and a glass in the other, he was always drawing on any surface that held still — even the walls of his beloved Cartoon Inn at Rathdrum village where so many of his exhuberand productions are still displayed.\" Mathews describes Willers as \"a stylish and dapper dresser\" who was never seen without a shirt and tie and \"the sort of pastel blazer favoured by the gameshow host that he so resembled\". Writing in the Irish Times, fellow cartoonist Martyn Turner wrote, \"He was always very happy and full of jokes and was an incredibly talented artist. Most cartoonists become cartoonists because they have to... but Terry could draw anything and everything. In many ways he was an artist more than he was a cartoonist.\" Willers' career is said to have begun at the age of 15 when he joined what has been described as \"a Disney studio in London\" and \"a Walt Disney animation team\". At the age of 17 he was certainly contributing the four-panel cartoon 'Tich' to TV Comic (1952–53). In 1959 he also contributed to Zip and Jack & Jill comics. Around this time, Willers began working for the Martin Toonder Studio in the Netherlands, drawing 'Panda' and, from 1963, 'Tom Poes', a hugely popular newspaper strip created by Toonder in 1919. According to Lambiek, \"he added a slapstick element to the strips, and intensified the absurdism in the artwork.\" The strip ran in the Dutch newspaper De Volkskrant and various regional papers until 1965. He then went to draw 'Kappie', the adventures of Captain Anne Wobke and the crew of his tug, the Kraak for three years. In 1968, he returned to 'Tom Poes', when he did a comic strip for Donald Duck comic.Willers also contributed briefly to British comics during this period, ghosting episodes of 'General Nitt and His Barmy Army' and 'Georgie's Germs' for Wham!. Willers contributed in the 1970s and 1980s to Hall's Pictorial Weekly, hosted by Frank Hall, and The Mike Murphy Show, broadcast on Ireland's RTÉ. He was also a prolific contributor to magazines, including the Farmer's Journal, Sunday Independent, Evening Herald and Wicklow People. In the 1990s, Willers contributed to The Yellow Press, an Irish anthology comic, and The Beano, drawing 'Minder Bird' in 1995. He also illustrated several books, including Brian Power presents 'It's All Happening' (1970), The TV Generation by Desmond Forristal (1970), Gift of the Gab! The Irish Conversation Guide by Tadhg Hayes (1996, later reprinted as The Wit of Irish Conversation), Twelve Days Of Chaos by Frank Kelly (1997) and Stop Howling At The Moon by Eamon O'Donnell (2007)."

  "text" : "Trena Mary Cox (1895–1980) was an English stained glass artist. She was born Emma Trina Cox on 3 March 1895, in the Lower Bebington Urban District (i.e. not Bebbington), on the Wirral Peninsula and grew up around Birkenhead. She trained at the Laird School of Art. In 1924 she moved to Chester and set up her studio in Victoria Road Chester, Cheshire, either adjacent to, or within, the Kaleyard works of Williams, Gamon & Co., with whom she remained associated until the Second World War. In about 1945, Trena Cox moved to 96 Watergate Street, Chester, which remained her home and, at least later, her studio, until she retired in 1972 (at the age of 77) and died, on 11 February 1980 (not in 1977, as frequently quoted). Most of her works are in churches in the old counties of Cheshire and Lancashire. She was a fellow of the British Society of Master Glass Painters. The authors of the Buildings of England series comment that \"her windows are usually small, her figures modest, often with small-scale detail in the quarries\" (small pieces of square or diamond-shaped glass set diagonally). Until the publication of Jones (2012), there was very little coherent information available about the life of Trena Cox and errors in some earlier references, concerning, for example, the year of her death, have unfortunately been perpetuated by later authors."

  "text" : "Tominaga Nakamoto (富永 仲基 Tominaga Nakamoto, 1715–1746) was a Japanese philosopher. He was educated at the Kaitokudō academy founded by members of the mercantile class of Osaka, but was ostracised shortly after the age of 15. Tominaga belonged to a Japanese rationalist school of thought and advocated a Japanese variation of atheism, mukishinron (no gods or demons). He was also a merchant in Osaka. Only a few of his works survive; his Setsuhei (\"Discussions on Error\") has been lost and may have been the reason for his separation from the Kaitokudō, and around nine other works' titles are known. The surviving works are his Okina no Fumi (\"The Writings of an Old Man\"), Shutsujō Kōgo (\"Words after Enlightenment\"; on textual criticism of Buddhist sutras), and three other works on ancient musical scales, ancient measurements, and poetry. He took a deep critical stance against normative systems of thought, partially based on the Kaitokudō's emphasis on objectivity, but was clearly heterodox in eschewing the dominant philosophies of the institution. He was critical of Buddhism, Confucianism and Shintoism. Whereas each of these traditions drew on history as a source of authority, Tominaga saw appeals to history as a pseudo-justification for innovations that try to outdo other sects vying for power. For example, he cited the various Confucian Masters who saw human nature as partially good, neither good nor bad, all good, and inherently bad; analysing later interpreters who tried to incorporate and reconcile all Masters. He criticised Shintoism as obscurantist, especially in its habit of secret instruction. As he always said, \"hiding is the beginning of lying and stealing\".In his study of Buddhist scriptures, he asserted that Hinayana school of scriptures preceded Mahayana scriptures but also asserted that the vast majority of Hinayana scriptures are also composed much later than the life of Gautama Buddha, the position which was later supported by modern scriptural studies."

  "text" : "Tyrteu Rocha Vianna  (November 28, 1898 - September 21, 1963) was a Brazilian poet avant-garde and pioneer amateur radio, and large landowner of Rio Grande do Sul, southern Brazil. He was born in São Francisco de Assis, Rio Grande do Sul, a small isolated town where he lived most of his life; despite this, has been regarded by critics as one of the most gifted or the most modernist poet of the early twentieth century in Rio Grande do Sul. Had influence of Futurism mostly, but also the Manifesto Antropófago and Cubism. Has just published a book, and was author that has been little known and little appreciated by his countrymen and contemporaries. He died in Alegrete, aged 64."

Tetabiate was the son of Pablo Maldonado and Felipa Beltran, and was born in Hermosillo, Sonora, Mexico. He was baptized at the Catedral de la Asunción, in Hermosillo, on August 31, 1857 (Iglesia Católica, 1857). Following the death of Cajemé on April 23, 1887, Tetabiate led the Yaqui nation for the next 14 years in a guerrilla war against the Porfirio government of Mexico. He was killed on July 9, 1901 in the Bacatete Mountains of Sonora, while fighting against Mexican forces under the command of Loreto Villa (Chief of Yaqui Falls Fighting, 1901). It was reported that the son of Tetabiate, Guillermo, continued the fight against the Mexican forces after his father's death (Mexico's Yaqui War, 1902)."

  "text" : "Theodore N. Ely (July 23, 1846 – October 29, 1916) was an executive in charge of steam locomotive power development and purchases on the Pennsylvania Railroad, one of the largest railroad systems and business concerns in the United States. Upon his retirement in 1911 after forty-three years with the Pennsylvania, the trade periodical Railway Age Gazette recounted Ely's career, his accomplishments and accolades. Perhaps his most recognizable innovation, per Railway Age Gazette, was the relocation of the steam locomotive boiler and fire box. Prior to the 1881-3 design of the Pennsylvania's Class K 4-4-0 American Standard steam locomotives (later reclassified to the Pennsylvania's Class D6 4-4-0 American Standards), most fire boxes were located between the frames of locomotives, restricting their width, and thus, the power of the locomotive. Ely's design moved the fire box and boiler assembly above the drive wheels, creating a design which was more powerful, as well as easier to stoke. The area available to burn coal, and thus power the locomotive, was increased from eighteen to nearly thirty-five square feet. The change, considered radical at the time, created a design which observers believed would run roughly and prove top-heavy and unstable. Railway Age Gazette noted in 1911: \"It was Mr. Ely that took the first step alone, against the protests of many by whom he was surrounded, that has led to the development of the large locomotives of today. While builders and engineers considered that the end had come, that the locomotive had reached the limit of its power because of the restrictions current construction put upon the size of the firebox, Mr. Ely lifted his whole boiler into the air, set his foundation ring on top of the frames, widened his firebox and gave the machine a new lease of life. Many and dire were the predictions made as to the instability of the new design, but we all know the result. It did not upset, but ran with unexampled smoothness and with construction revolutionized the whole country followed in his wake. This is but a single example of his work.\" The design proved so revolutionary that \"Ely's No. 10,\" one of the class K American Standards, was issued as a U.S. postage stamp in 1977. The U.S. Postal Service wrote of Ely's design: \"It was among the fastest express locomotives in the United States during the 1880s. No. 10 was a prototype and considered a remarkably advanced design at the time of its introduction.\" In his retirement tribute, the Gazette included an anecdote from an unnamed co-worker off the Pennsylvania: \"As one of his associates expressed it, 'He was the balance wheel of the mechanical organization of the road,' and if these same associates are to be believed it is to his influence that the wonderful teamwork of the various departments is largely due.\" By 1911 Ely was a member of the American Society of Civil Engineers, the Institution of Civil Engineers (Great Britain), the American Society of Mechanical Engineers, the American Institute of Mining Engineers, the Franklin Institute, the American Philosophical Society, the American Association for the Advancement of Science, other technical and scientific associations, vice-president of the American Academy in Rome and an honorary member of the American Institute of Architects, president of the Eastern Railroad Association, a member of the executive committee of the American Railway Association and of the permanent commission of the International Railway Congress. Ely was also a director of the Pennsylvania Steel Company and the Cambria Steel Company and of the boards of trustees of the Drexel Institute of Art Science and Industry and of the Philadelphia Commercial Museum. Before his retirement, Ely was awarded an honorary Masters of Arts by Yale University in 1897. In 1904 he was awarded an honorary Doctor of Science by Hamilton College. He died October 28, 1916, at his home Wyndham, at Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania. For his contributions to early American railroading Ely is listed by the Smithsonian Institutions' John H. White, Jr., as one of America's most noteworthy railroaders."

  "text" : "Tāmati Ngāpora (died 5 August 1885) was a New Zealand Waikato leader, lay preacher, assessor and adviser to the Māori King. Ngāpora was born in the early 19th century to parents Hore and Kahurimu, and belonged to Ngāti Mahuta. His father Hore was a brother of Te Rauangaanga, the chief of Ngāti Mahuta, and so Ngāpora was a cousin of Pōtatau Te Wherowhero, the first Māori King. Ngāpora and his family became Christians, and he took the name Tāmati (Thomas). He married his cousin Hera. Although not initially in favour of an intertribal Māori kingship, Ngāpora acted as the King movement's representative to the Governor of New Zealand after Te Wherowhero became king in 1858. Te Wherowhero proposed that Ngāpora should succeed him, but others favoured Te Wherowhero's son Tāwhiao, who duly succeeded him. When the Government invaded the Waikato in 1863, Ngāpora took refuge in the King Country with Tāwhiao. Ngāpora changed his name to Manuhiri (meaning guest) to signify his exile. Ngāpora became Tāwhiao's closest adviser. His daughter Hera married Tāwhiao and was his principal wife and mother of the third Māori King, Mahuta. Ngāpora remained living at Whatiwhatihoe, the royal village in the King Country, and died there on 5 August 1885. He was believed to be about 80 years old."

  "text" : "Tomasz Szadek (1550 – 1612) was a Polish composer, singer, and cleric of the late Renaissance. He was a representative of the late style of the Franco-Flemish school in Poland. Gustave Reese gives a birthdate of 1550, but no location. Little is known about his activities prior to his appointment to the royal chapel in Kraków, other than that he had received a baccalaureate degree sometime before his arrival in 1569. He became a curate at the cathedral in the early 1570s, where he also heard confessions. He joined the Capella Rorantistarum, a group of male singers for the Sigismund Chapel of the Wawel Cathedral, and remained with them until 1578. Towards the end of his life, the association of cathedral vicars put him on trial, accusing him of poor performance in administrative duties and having an immoral lifestyle. Szadek's surviving music was all written for the male voices of his choir. It is in a style equivalent to the work of the late Franco-Flemish school. Of his writing Reese observes that he \"shows talent for melodic line, but his polyphonic technique is unresourceful.\" Much of his writing is homophonic. One of his two masses is based on a chanson by Thomas Crecquillon – Pis ne me peult venir, and is of the parody type. The other is also a parody mass, and based on a Christmas carol."

  "text" : "Thomas Wight, 1640–1724, was a native of Bandon, County Cork, and author of the first History of the Quakers in Ireland. His father was Rice Wight, Church of Ireland minister of Bandon and a son of Thomas Wight, A.M. (fl. 1619-49) also a minister and a native of Guildford, Surrey. While a clothier's apprentice, Wight attended Quaker meeting out of curiosity. He was impressed by a speech by Francis Howgill - \"Before the eye can see, it must be opened; before the ear can hear, it must unstopped; and before the heart can understand, it must be illuminated.\" Edward Burrough was a further influence in causing Wight to move away from the Church of Ireland to becoming a Quaker himself. He married in 1670 and had a large family. According to the History of Bandon \"His increased responsibilities induced him to attend very closely to his business-which was not confined to the clothing trade alone, he being also engaged as a commission agent-and in all likelihood Wight would have been in a short time a wealthy man, had he not been providentially stopped in his sinful career by an illumination direct from heaven, which threw a great deal of light into his dark mind, causing him to reflect much, and satisfying him \"that he could not be heir to two kingdoms at once.\" He saw his great danger, and, like a thorough Christian he flung all his worldly gains to the winds, and devoted himself entirely to the truth. Being an able scribe, he was appointed clerk to the meeting in Cork, and for the province of Munster. He was also the compiler of an historical account of The first rise and progress of the truth in this nation, which he perfected in the form of annuls, up to the year 1700.\""

On December 12, 2015, Wild was arrested on suspicion of drink driving, shortly after the Manx Government had launched its Christmas anti-drink drive campaign. A breath test recorded 108 micrograms of alcohol per 100 millilitres - the legal limit on the Isle of Man is 35. He stood trial and was subsequently convicted for being three times over the drink drive limit. Wild was sentenced on 16 February 2016, the sentence resulted in a five-year driving ban in addition to a fine of £243:80 and an order to carry out 180 hours community service. Wild subsequently resigned his position as a member of the Department of Health and Social Care, however he has steadfastly refused to resign his position on the Legislative Council. This has in turn led to widespread public outrage at his decision."

The book is foolscap folio, and like all Mr Didsbury's productions, is well and correctly printed. All our varied forest trees and shrubs are minutely described and illustrated; the native and vulgar names are given, the properties and uses are set forth in popular language as well as in the ordinary scientific style. The plates number one hundred and forty-two, and are chiefly executed by the draftsmen of the Survey Department. Most of them are signed by Mr Hugh Boscawen, and reflect great credit on his skill as a botanical artist. We notice other names of the survey staff, as well as those of Mr A. Hamilton of Napier, and Mr D. Blair. The work is written and compiled by Mr T. Kirk, f.l.s., and is highly creditable to the author. The contents might have been more systematically arranged, as we find closely allied species widely separated, altogether alien forms coming in between. The illustrations as a rule are excellent, but being by different hands exhibit a want of uniformity. Some are fully shaded; others in almost pure outline. In an appendix the plants are systematically classified, and to have followed this arrangement in the body of the work would have been an improvement. A comparative table at the end showing at one view the particulars scattered through the work as to strength, specific gravity, &c, of the various woods, would have been an acceptable addition. We would be sorry to criticise so excellent and valuable a work in any spirit of faultfinding. A limited number, we believe, were printed on large paper. It would have been well to have issued a number for sale, as the narrow margin to some of the plates will not be pleasing to book-lovers." ]

He was created Viscount Fairfax in the Peerage of Ireland in 1629. Fairfax was the son of Sir William Fairfax of Gilling Castle and Walton. He was at school at Gilling and entered Caius College, Cambridge in 1590. He succeeded his father to the estates of Gilling and Walton in 1597. He was a sheep farmer and an encloser. In 1600 he was commissioner for musters for the West Riding of Yorkshire. In 1601, he was elected Member of Parliament for Boroughbridge. He was a J.P. for the North Riding of Yorkshire by 1603. He was knighted in April 1603. From July 1603 he was a member of the council in the north, and was vice-president of the council in the north in 1608 and 1616. In 1621 he was elected MP for Hedon. He was re-elected MP for Hedon in 1624. 1625 and 1626. From 1627 to 1628 he was High Sheriff of Yorkshire. He was created Viscount Fairfax on 10 January 1629. Fairfax died at Howsham at the age of about 61 and was buried at Scrayingham. Fairfax married Catherine Constable daughter of Sir Henry Constable of Burton Constable in 1594 and had six sons and five daughters. She was an open Catholic and was convicted of recusancy at regular intervals from 1599 until her death. She does not appear to have been fined, which may be attributable to Fairfax's friendship with Sir Arthur Ingram who was secretary to the council in the north, and collector, for a time, of recusancy fines. She also employed Catholic maids and escaped penalty for this and although it was also an offence, at least two of the sons went abroad to Catholic colleges. She died in 1626) and in 1627, Fairfax remarried to Lady Mary Bamburgh, widow of Sir William Bamburgh, Bt., of Howsham.and daughter of Sir Robert Ford of Butley, Suffolk."

  "text" : "Shri Tridandi Swami (22 April 1905 – 2 December 1999) was a renowned Sri Vaishnava saint and one of the foremost preachers of the Sri Sampradaya in North India. One of the foremost disciples of Sri Prativadibhayankar Swamiji of Kanchi, he popularized Sri Vaishnavism throughout North India among the masses and brought Sri Vaishnavism beyond its traditional domain of South India. After Sri Rangadeshika Swamiji, who founded the Ranganathji temple in the mid-19th century, he can rightly be counted amongst the most noteworthy Acharyas of Sri Vaishnava sampradaya. He manifested himself on Baishakha Krishna Paksha third, Friday in Anuradha Nakshatra Vikram era 1962 (1905 A.D) in the Shishirgadh village, 12 km southward of the Buxar town in the state of Bihar. He descended in the lap of Shrimati Mahamanya Indira Devi, the virtuous wife of an immensely devout Saryuparin Brahmin named Shrinarayan Chaturvedi."

Tuot Saron served as a commune chief of Pong Ro commune, Baray District, Kampong Thom Province. In the months leading up to Cambodia's 2008 General Election, Tuot Saron and three colleagues were allegedly asked to protect an SRP candidate, Tim Norn, who had come under pressure to join the ruling Cambodian People’s Party (CPP). Following the candidate's later defection to the CPP, Tuot Saron was arrested on 18 March on charges of having abducted the candidate. On 20 March 2009, he was brought to trial, convicted, and sentenced to three years' imprisonment. Several international human rights groups protested his arrest. Human Rights Watch described the arrest as \"dubious\" and \"part of a ruling party campaign to weaken political rivals prior to national elections\". Amnesty International called the charges \"baseless and politically motivated\" and stated that they were filed \"in order to intimidate otheropposition party activists\". The organization named Tuot Saron a prisoner of conscience and called for his immediate release. Tuot Saron was released on 26 November 2010, following a Royal Pardon decree."

  "text" : "Thomas Russell \"Tommy\" Durden (December 15, 1919 – October 17, 1999) was an American steel guitarist and songwriter, who is most notable for co-writing Elvis Presley's breakthrough hit, \"Heartbreak Hotel\". He was born in Morgan County, Georgia, the son of a sharecropper and the youngest of seven children. The family later moved to Jacksonville, Florida, where he learned slide guitar and later steel guitar. He performed with the Westernaires as steel guitarist, and in the early 1950s, after moving to Gainesville, joined country band Smilin' Jack Herring and his Swingbillys. The band's other members were Herring, Pee Wee Jenkins, and Bob Chisolm. While playing with the Swingbillys, Durden began writing the lyrics for \"Heartbreak Hotel\", inspired by a Miami Herald story about a man who committed suicide, leaving a note that read \"I walk a lonely street\". He took the half-written lyrics to his friends and occasional songwriting partners Mae Boren Axton - who worked as a part-time disc jockey and publicist for Colonel Tom Parker's client Hank Snow - and Glen Reeves. While Reeves thought the idea of the \"lonely street\" leading to a \"heartbreak hotel\" was not worthy of a song and turned down the offer of a co-writing credit, Axton composed a tune, and recorded an initial version with Durden. Another account from a radio-station owner has it that Durden had written the song in its entirety months previous and had already been performing it onstage. In any case, the song was recorded as a demo by Reeves who had a better singing voice. Axton had promised to write a song for Elvis Presley and presented Presley with the demo at a 1955 disc jockey convention in Nashville. Presley liked the song, and he and Parker, his manager, agreed that he should record it so long as he was given a co-writing credit, which Axton and Durden accepted. \"Heartbreak Hotel\" eventually became Presley's first record on RCA Records and his first number one hit. Although Durden continued to write songs with Axton and Reeves, including \"Honey Bop\" which was recorded by Wanda Jackson in 1960, none had anything approaching the success of \"Heartbreak Hotel\". He later performed as steel guitarist for Tex Ritter, Johnny Cash and Johnny Tillotson. He moved to live in Houghton Lake, Michigan, and worked as a commercial dishwasher repairman until retiring in the early 1980s. In later years he recorded two albums, Moods, which included a version of \"Heartbreak Hotel,\" and I Believe. He was inducted into the Michigan Country Music Hall of Fame in 1994. He died in Houghton Lake, Michigan in 1999 at the age of 79."

  "text" : "Thomas Hopkins (1616–1684), was an early settler of Providence, Rhode Island, and the great grandfather of Stephen Hopkins who was many times colonial governor of Rhode Island and a signer of the Declaration of Independence. Thomas Hopkins was baptized in Yeovilton, county Somerset on 7 April 1616, the son of William Hopkins and Joane Arnold. His mother was the sister of early Providence settler William Arnold, and the daughter of Nicholas and Alice (Gully) Arnold of Northover and Ilchester in Somerset. Hopkins' mother died when he was five years old, after which he and his sister Frances were likely taken into the family of their Uncle William Arnold, and most writers on his early history agree that he, aged 19, sailed to New England with his uncle's family in 1635. Also on the same ship was his first cousin, Benedict Arnold, also aged 19, the future governor of the Rhode Island colony. The Arnolds first settled in Hingham in the Massachusetts Bay Colony, but in less than a year, in April 1636, they joined Roger Williams, and were among the first settlers of Providence. Soon thereafter they were the first English settlers on the Pawtuxet River, the southern edge of Williams's Providence purchase. Hopkins was not yet of age when they settled here, but soon reached his majority, and in 1640 he was one of 39 signers of an agreement to form a government in Providence, he signing his name with a mark. From 1652 to 1672 Hopkins served in a number of civic positions in Providence, including Commissioner, Deputy, and member of the Town Council. In 1676 King Philip's War raged in Rhode Island, and all of the Pawtuxet settlement, and most of Providence was destroyed. While Hopkin's two oldest sons, William and Thomas, either remained in Providence or returned there shortly after the war, Hopkins and his youngest son (whose name has not been discovered) moved to Oyster Bay, on Long Island in the Province of New York, and remained there. Hopkins' son predeceased him, and his daughter-in-law, Elizabeth, then married Richard Kirby. It was in the home of Kirby that Hopkins was living when he died in 1684."

  "text" : "The Appropriate Technology Collaborative is a U.S. Non-profit dedicated to designing everyday technologies for the global poor. ATC projects are international collaborative efforts between local grassroots organizations, local engineers and designers, university groups and individuals. Projects are inspired by local needs and interest in developing or improving technologies to make life easier for low-income communities in rural or urban areas. Some ATC Projects are open to US volunteer participation, where volunteers work as a team with local experts and community members to design and build an appropriate technology in service of Guatemala's low income communities. These projects inspire intercultural collaboration and mutual educational exchange as local and foreign participants share skills and knowledge on the work site. These volunteer trips aid in creating cross-cultural understanding while addressing issues surrounding poverty in the developing world. ATC projects empower local communities to decide what technology is needed, build it, use it and plan for maintenance. ATC also runs a women's education and business program called “Mayan Power and Light” in which young Mayan women study solar power installation, electrical circuits and carpentry to start their own solar businesses. These solar businesses can market to low-income families who can purchase small-scale systems designed to charge a LED light and a cell phone. Larger systems are also available as families scale-up their solar power systems. The availability of low-cost solar lighting will reduce weekly costs on kerosene, candles or expensive electricity bills. This allows low income families to spend extra cash on nutrition, education or health while increasing their nighttime productivity. Mayan Power and Light aims to grow a new local, green economy that empowers women in business and technical fields. ATC shares drawings and designs of their appropriate technologies, open-source on their website. These designs have been downloaded in over 40 countries by over 7,000 nonprofits, governments and individuals. Our most prominent projects were implemented in India, Papua New Guinea, Nicaragua, and Guatemala. The Appropriate Technology Collaborative's Previous Projects Include: Wind Energy, Solar Energy,Solar Vaccine Refrigerator, Solar Replacements for Kerosene Lamps, Squatter City Infrastructure, Water Pumps such as the Treadle Pump and Ram Pump, Hand Crank Water Purifier, Recycled home insulation using corn/rice sacks, Solar Hot Water Heating, Fuel Efficient “Rocket” Stoves, Natural Building with Earth and Lime for ecological and economical home construction"

  "text" : "Tito Cittadini (1886–1960) was an Argentine painter. He was born in Buenos Aires to Italian immigrants, and in 1907 he began the study of architecture in Buenos Aires. He traveled to Europe in 1910, and at that time decided to switch his study to painting. In 1911 he began tutelage under Catalan painter Hermen Anglada, in Paris. Due to Anglada's urging, Cittadini made several trips to Spain during this period, and in 1913 he made his first trip to Majorca. The island captivated him, and it gradually became the central focus of his work.When World War I broke out in 1914, Cittadini established his permanent residency in Majorca, thereby insulating himself from the complications of that conflict. However, he continued to travel often to other countries. Cittadini was a prolific artist, working in oils, watercolor, and pencil. He also published several articles discussing theory and practice in painting. A posthumous work (1965) showcased his thoughts, Vademecum del aspirante a pintor (The Student Painter's Handbook). Cittadini died in Pollença, Majorca, in 1960. Most of his exhibited works now hang in Majorcan museums."

  "text" : "Thomas Jack (5 February 1881 – 9 October 1961) was a British track and field athlete Thomas Jack's introduction to athletics came through racing his brothers on the family farm near the small village of Bellsquarry, to the west of Edinburgh. On the track, he won the Scottish 4 miles title twice (1908, 1912), the 10 miles seven times (1904, 1906-10, 1912), and in 1908 he finished third in the AAA 10 miles. He was twice Scottish cross-country champion (1907, 1912) and ran in the International Championship five times (1907-10, 1912). In the 1908 Olympic marathon his early pace was faster than his winning time in the Scottish AAA 4 miles and he dropped out after 5 miles. Rumours also suggested that he dropped out after spotting a pub, entering it, and then rejoining the race. Some surviving members of his family are adamant that Jack only entered the pub because of \"shoe trouble\". A graduate of Edinburgh University, he was later Headmaster of Castle Hill School and served as President of the Scottish AAA in 1912. Personal Bests: 4 miles – 20:45.0 (1912); 6 miles – 31:18.8 (1907); 10 miles – 53:04.0 (1907); Mar – unknown."

  "text" : "Tomás Herrera Jr. (June 9, 1933 in Laredo, Texas – September 19, 1997 in Houston, Texas) had a long career as a professional baseball player and manager, beginning his professional career in 1953. Herrera played in the minor leagues for at least six seasons, never reaching the major leagues - though he did spend parts of four seasons at the Open designation, which was created to help build the Pacific Coast League into a major league, and in the Mexican League, the highest-level professional league in Mexico. A pitcher, Herrera won as many as 10 games in a season, per the records available. From 1963 to 1969, Herrera managed the Mexico City Reds, leading them to first place finishes and de facto league championships in 1964 and 1968. He managed the Seraperos de Saltillo from 1970 to 1972, the Pericos de Puebla in 1973 and the Mineros de Coahuila in 1974 and 1975."

  "text" : "Thore Embretsen Myrvang (21 January 1858 – 9 July 1939) was a Norwegian educator and politician for the Liberal Party and the Labour Democrats. He was born in Tynset as a son of farmers Embret Thoresen Myrvang (1828–1884) and Gisken Krogseng (1829–1922). He took teacher's education at Hamar Seminary in 1877, and was a teacher in Stor-Elvdal until 1916. He also owned the farm Westgård from 1896. From 1911 to 1915 he was the acting school director of the Diocese of Hamar, being a substitute for Olav Andreas Eftestøl who was an MP. Myrvang served as mayor of Stor-Elvdal from 1901 to 1904, 1913 to 1916 and 1922 to 1925. During the last period he also chaired the county council (which was composed of mayors). He then represented the Labour Democrats, which he joined after the split from the Liberal Party. For both these parties, he served a total of six terms in the Parliament of Norway. The first five terms were continuous, with Myrvang winning elections in 1894, 1897, 1900, 1903 and 1906. On the latter occasion, the system with single-member constituencies had been implemented, and Myrvang won because he gathered the social democratic vote. In 1912 he was elected as the deputy of Olav Andreas Eftestøl in Søndre Østerdalen, whereas in 1915 he was elected to his sixth and last term, with K. K. Sanaker as his deputy. In 1918, the last election with single-member constituencies, he lost to Johan Bondesen, social democrat from Stor-Elvdal. In 1921 Myrvang headed the party ballot in the plural-member constituency Hedmark, whereas in 1924 he was the second candidate on a joint list with the Liberal Party, both times without being elected. Among his other posts, Myrvang chaired the county school board of Hedmark from 1924 to 1930, and also chaired the Norwegian Farmers and Smallholders Union."

Bamichas was born in Delvina, modern southern Albania (Northern Epirus), then Ottoman Empire. After finishing ground level studies in his home town, he went to Geneva, where he studied law. Back to Delvina, he was involved in various patriotic initiatives and in 1914 he had to move to nearby Corfu, Greece. However, at the same year he returned and participated in the struggle for the establishment of the Autonomous Republic of Northern Epirus. In the 1915 elections, while Northern Epirus was under temporary Greek control, he was elected as a member of the Greek Parliament. During this period he cooperated closely with the later anti-Venizelist Ion Dragoumis. In 1919 he went to the Paris Peace Conference as part of the Northern Epirote delegation under Alexandros Karapanos. Bamichas lived the rest of his life in Corfu. He published in Corfu the Codex of the Church of the city of Delvina (Greek: Κώδιξ του Ναού της Πόλεως του Δελβίνου) which contains significant historical information about the forced 17th century islamizations and persecutions of the Christian element in Delvina and the wider region."

  "text" : "Tom D'Angora is a three time Drama Desk nominated and Off-Broadway Alliance Award winning New York based theatrical producer whose Off-Broadway credits include NEWSical: The Musical, Naked Boys Singing!, Back In Pictures, the Backstage Bistro Award Winning Divas I've Done and A Broadway Diva Christmas. D'Angora's first foray into producing was with his one man show titled Divas I've Done  that started at Don't Tell Mama's, transferred to LA's Room 5 Lounge, played the 2004 summer season in Provincetown, MA, and eventually played Off-Broadway. It was the final show to play Upstairs at Studio 54 before the space closed and ended its run at Theater Row. The show won D'Angora the Backstage Bistro Award for Best Musical Comedy, beating out Broadway stars and Cabaret legends for the honor  During that time D'Angora established relationships with many of the \"divas\" featured in his show including Little Shop of Horrors Ellen Greene, whose album In His Eyes D'Angora he served as Executive Producer on. In 2005, D'Angora and his now husband Michael Duling, brought Greene as well as recording and Broadway artist Maya Days, Emmy nominee Kathy Brier, Tony Award nominee Marla Schaffel, and Forbidden Broadway's Christine Pedi together for the seasonal musical revue A Broadway Diva Christmas. In Provincetown D'Angora starred in the highly controversial 2001 production of Naked Boys Singing and in 2007 took over the producing responsibilities  Since then he has produced and directed the 2009, 2010, 2011, and 2012 productions with Duling  In addition to Naked Boys Singing he has also brought such acts as Golden Girls Rue McClanahan, Ellen Greene, Christine Pedi, Debbie Does Dallas: the musical, and most notably ICONS: drag extravaganza which has since transferred to an Off-Broadway run. In 2010 Tom began producing responsibilities of NEWSical: the Musical, the ever evolving Off-Broadway musical which spoofs newsmakers, celebrities, politicians, and pop culture trends. The show went on to be nominated for Drama Desk Awards for the 2010 edition, titled \"We Distort You Decide\". The 2011 edition, \"Full Spin Ahead!\", was nominated for the Drama Desk Award for Best Musical Revue  and won the Off-Broadway Alliance Award for Best New Musical. in 2012 D'Angora opened his third consecutive edition of NEWSical The Musical titled \"End of the World Edition\" which was nominated for a Drama Desk Award for Best Musical Revue. In 2012 D'Angora revolutionized Off-Broadway casting when it was announced that NEWSical would have a rotating cast of celebrity guest stars appearing. Celebrity guest stars have included Perez Hilton, Andrea McArdle, Cheri Oteri, Carson Kressley, Jackee Harry, Kandi Burruss and La Toya Jackson. As of August 2014 NEWSical has played over 1,500 performances at Theatre Rows Kirk Theater making it the longest running show in the history of the legendary theater complex. Tom has been featured as himself appearing in several reality television shows including Edens World on Logo and Life with La Toya on OWN. NEWSical and Tom were the subject of a full episode of Life with La Toya in 2014. D'Angora has also worked in film serving as a co producer on The Big Gay Musical and Executive producer on Mangus."

Nisbett In perhaps his most popular study Dr. Masuda displayed a series of images with characters of varied emotional expression. There was a distinct measurable difference in the way North Americans and Japanese perceived the emotion of the central figure of the image, such that for North Americans the perception of the emotion of the central figure was not affected by whether or not the figures in the background showed a congruent emotion. Whereas the Japanese participants were markedly influenced in their judgement of the central figures emotional state depending on the emotional states of the surrounding figure."

  "text" : "Toby Myers, born September 26. 1949 is an American bass player. best known for recording and touring with John Cougar Mellencamp as the bass guitarist. Myers was raised in the Indianapolis, Indiana area where he attended art school at the John Herron School of Art from 1968 to 1971. He developed an interest in music and began playing bass in a music shop next to the laundromat where his mother did the family's laundry. Myers began playing in bands in high school. Myers lived next door to a wizard keyboard player Michael Read, one of the founding members of Pure Funk, a popular Indianapolis college funk band. Myers joined Pure Funk as their bass player in 1971. By 1976, Pure Funk had changed its name to Roadmaster. Roadmaster was a fairly successful pomp rock band which was discovered by Todd Rundgren and ultimately recorded four albums for Village/Mercury Records. When Roadmaster's fourth album (Fortress) failed to hit the charts in the early 80's Mercury Records dropped the band. 9 months later Myers was recruited by members of John Mellencamp's band in Bloomington, Indiana to play bass for \"John Cougar,\" as Mellencamp was then known. After only a few weeks of rehearsal with the band, Myers' first gig with Mellencamp was their appearance on Saturday Night Live (SNL) April 10, 1982. In 1983 Myers, along with Larry Crane and Mike Wanchic on guitars, Kenny Aronoff on drums and percussion, and John Cascella on keyboards recorded Mellencamp's 1983 album Uh-Huh. This was the backing band Mellencamp settled on and would retain for the next several albums. In 1988, Rolling Stone magazine called this version of Mellencamp's band \"one of the most powerful and versatile live bands ever assembled.\" Myers toured and recorded with John Mellencamp from 1982 to approximately 1994. In 1992, Myers appeared as \"Luke\" in the John Mellencamp-directed movie, \"Falling from Grace.\" Myers celebrated his 60th birthday in 2009 with a large party in Nashville, Indiana, where he now lives."

  "text" : "Thomas Naogeorgus (Thomas Kirchmeyer, Kirchmair, Neubauer; 21 December 1508 – 29 December 1563) was a Latin dramatist, humanist, Protestant theologian, preacher and pamphleteer of the German Renaissance. Naogeorgus was born in Straubing. His dramatic works were very influential in the German Reformation. He was greatly influenced by Martin Luther, but his teachings stand independent of Lutheranism, and the publication of his exegesis of 1 John was opposed by Luther and Melanchthon. He died, aged 55, in Wiesloch."

  "text" : "Thomas Gaspey (31 March 1788 – 8 December 1871) was an English novelist and journalist. Gaspey was born in Hoxton as the son of William Gaspey, a lieutenant in the navy. While a youth he wrote verses for yearly pocket-books, and when about twenty contributed to Literary Recreations, a monthly publication, edited by Eugenius Roche of the Morning Post. Soon afterwards he was engaged as parliamentary reporter on the Morning Post, contributing also dramatic reviews, political parodies, and reports of trials for treason. In this paper he wrote an Elegy on the Marquis of Anglesey's Leg, a jeu d'esprit which has been persistently attributed to Canning. On the Morning Post he was employed sixteen years, then for three or four years on the Courier, a government paper, as sub-editor. In 1828 he bought a share in the Sunday Times, the tone of which paper he raised as a literary and dramatic organ, Horace Smith, the Rev. T. Dale, Alfred Crowquill, E. L. Blanchard, Gilbert à Beckett, and others contributing. His Richmond (1827) and The History of George Godfrey (1828) are considered as early examples of the Newgate novel. He was for many years the senior member of the council of the Literary Fund. He was considered an excellent mimic. The last twenty years of his life were spent quietly on his property at Shooter's Hill, Kent, where he died on 8 December 1871, aged 83, and was buried at Plumstead, Kent. He married Anne Camp in 1810 or 1811, and she died on 22 January 1883. His son, Thomas W. Gaspey, Ph.D., of Heidelberg, who died on 22 December 1871, was author of works on the Rhine and Heidelberg, and of several linguistic handbooks. Another son, William Gaspey (born at Westminster 20 June 1812, died at 17 St. Ann's Road, North Brixton, 19 July 1888), was a prolific writer in prose and verse."

  "text" : "Thomas Jervis Ryan (1834–1901) was a New Zealand policeman. He was born in Ireland in about 1834. In 1861 he joined Otago's police force. In 1862 he moved to Palmerston. He oversaw gold rushes at places such as Lake End, Tokomairiro, and the Mt. Ida district. In 1865, because of his lackadaisical work ethic and proclivity to alcohol, he was transferred from Canterbury province to Mackenzie County. Later that year he was stationed in Waitangi, but was put back in Mackenzie in 1866. In 1869, after being transferred more around New Zealand, he married Ellen Johnston in Dunedin. The next year he resigned from the police force. In 1872, and again in 1890, Ryan was arrested for assault. Later, in 1901, he was sent to jail for theft and was sent to the Sunnyside Lunatic Asylum, where he died on October 14."

  "text" : "Tracy Hogg (August, 1960 – November 25, 2004) was a British nurse and bestselling author. Her experiences as a nurse at St. Catherine's Hospital for the Mentally Handicapped and other hospitals led to a career as a child care expert. She was nicknamed \"the baby whisperer\" for her ability to placate infants. Hogg emigrated to the United States in 1992 and became famous in her last years for guiding young parents in California, among them Jodie Foster, Cindy Crawford, Jamie Lee Curtis and Calista Flockhart. Her fee for 3 weeks of babysitting was said to be over $15,000. Her first book, Secrets of the Baby Whisperer: How To Calm, Connect, and Communicate With Your Baby, co-authored by journalist Melinda Blau, was published in 2001. It became a New York Times bestseller. One year later, Secrets of the Baby Whisperer for Toddlers was published and became a national bestseller as well. In June 2002 Hogg teamed up with Discovery Health in Great Britain to produce a fifteen-part television series entitled The Baby Whisperer. In 2004, as she was battling cancer, Hogg and Blau collaborated on The Baby Whisperer Solves All Your Problems. Hogg died of melanoma on November 25, 2004."

  "text" : "Triveni Acharya is an Indian journalist and activist living in Mumbai, best known for her work with the anti-sex-trafficking group the Rescue Foundation. The group was originally founded by her husband, Balkrishna Acharya, but Triveni Acharya assumed its presidency following his death in a car accident in 2005. The organization is devoted to the \"rescue, rehabilitation and repatriation of victims for human trafficking from different parts of India, Nepal & Bangladesh and sold for forced prostitution\", and has been conducting \"brothel raids\" since 1993. The organization frees roughly 300 girls a year, and also provides counseling, job training, and HIV testing. Because these raids often result in serious financial loss or imprisonment for sex traffickers, Acharya has received several death threats as the result of her work. The Rescue Foundation has received several national and international awards for its work under Acharya's presidency. In 2008, the group received a Stree Shakti Award for Women Entrepreneurs. Taiwanese president Ma Ying-Jeou presented the Acharya the Asia Democracy and Human Rights Award of the Taiwan Foundation for Democracy, along with a cash grant of US$100,000; the organization had been nominated for the award by a former trafficking victim saved by the Foundation. In 2011, Acharya herself won the Civil Courage Prize of The Train Foundation, awarded annually to those \"who resolutely combat evil\". She shared the prize with Lydia Cacho Ribeiro, a Mexican journalist also awarded for her efforts against \"sex trafficking, domestic violence and child pornography\". In 2013, Triveni became the 2013 Humanitarian Honoree of World of Children Award in conjunction with her work with The Rescue Foundation. Along with the recognition the award came with a $75,000 cash grant."

  "text" : "Thomas Charles Hanbury-Tracy, 2nd Baron Sudeley (5 February 1801 – 19 February 1863), known as Thomas Leigh between 1806 and 1838 and styled The Honourable Thomas Leigh between 1838 and 1839 and The Honourable Thomas Hanbury-Tracy between 1839 and 1858, was a British colliery owner and politician. Hanbury-Tracy was the son of Charles Hanbury-Tracy, 1st Baron Sudeley, and the Honourable Henrietta Susanna Tracy, daughter of Henry Tracy, 8th Viscount Tracy. The Hanbury family derived its wealth from its ownership of the Pontypool Ironworks. In 1806 he assumed by Royal licence the surname of Leigh in lieu of his patronymic. However, in 1839 he discontinued the use of this surname and resumed by Royal licence his original surname of Hanbury-Tracy. He was returned to Parliament for Wallingford in 1831, a seat he held until 1832. On 10 February 1852, his father appointed him a deputy lieutenant of Montgomeryshire. He succeeded his father in the barony in 1858 and also succeeded him as Lord Lieutenant of Montgomeryshire, which he remained until his death five years later. Lord Sudeley married Emma Elizabeth Alicia Pennant, daughter of George Hay Dawkins-Pennant, in 1831. \n*  Charles George Hanbury-Tracy, 3rd Baron Tracy \n*  Charles Hanbury-Tracy, 4th Baron Tracy \n*  Frederick Stephen Archibald Hanbury-Tracy sat as Member of Parliament for Montgomery. Sudeley died in February 1863, aged 62, and was succeeded in the barony by his son, Sudeley. Lady Sudeley died in July 1888."

  "text" : "Te Waharoa  (died September 1838) was the leader of the Ngāti Hauā iwi (Māori tribe) of the eastern Waikato in New Zealand in the 1820s and 1830s. His father was Tangimoana of Ngāti Hauā and his mother was Te Kahurangi. As a small child Te Waharoa lived at Maungakawa, north-east of Cambridge. A group of Te Arawa attacked Maungakawa and Te Waharoa was taken to the Rotorua district where he spent his childhood among Te Arawa. He returned to Ngāti Hauā when he was a young man. He took part in fights during the Musket Wars, when Ngāti Hauā supported Waikato and Ngāti Maniapoto tribes against Te Rauparaha and Ngāti Toa, until Ngāti Toa were driven from Kāwhia in 1821. Te Waharoa became the leading chief of Ngāti Hauā. He led his tribe in preserving their territory from occupation by other tribes, including driving out Ngāti Maru in the 1820s, after they outstayed their welcome by weight of numbers,building 15 pa in Ngati Haua territory and the overtaxing of local food resources,when taking refuge from Ngāpuhi attacks on the Hauraki area. The final act that drove Te Waharoa to desperate measures was when Ngati Maru built Kaipaki pa very close to his own at Maungakawa. He spread the news that he was leaving the rohe for Tauranga so Ngati Maru would lower their guard. He then returned at night and launched a successful surprise attack on the much larger iwi. 200 people in Kaipaki pa were either eaten or enslaved.  After expelling Ngāti Maru from Matamata pā, near the present-day settlement of Waharoa (rather than the present-day town of Matamata), Te Waharoa made it his main pā. He also drove Ngāti Maru from the Horotiu district along the Waikato River and the Maungatautari district. Te Waharoa maintained military and trade links with the Ngāi Te Rangi and Ngāti Ranginui tribes who lived in the Tauranga district, across Ngāti Hauā's eastern boundary, the Kaimai Range. When the Tauranga tribes were threatened by a Ngāpuhi war party led by Te Haramiti in 1831, Te Waharoa and Ngāti Hauā went to the aid of Tupaea and the Tauranga people, and together they defeated the Ngāpuhi party. Also in December 1831 Te Wahoroa joined with a huge Waikato force estimated at 2,500 to 4,000 warriors under Te Whero whero who launched an assault on North Taranaki tribes Ngati Tama and Ngati Mutanga. In January 1832 the Waikato taua with Te Wahaoroa launched further assaults against Pukerangiora Pa which held 4,000 people. The besieged ran out of food and a large group of Taranaki children, women and older people fled at night. Most were caught by Waikato and killed,with only a few escaping. Two weeks later the men ran out of food and tried to escape at night in a sudden rush. In their weakened state they were easily overcome and many jumped over cliffs to avoid the Waikato slaughter. In all between 1,000 and 1500 people were killed. As was usual prisoner were killed and eaten with prisoners \" being decapitated, disembowelled ,cooked and eaten\". The battle was noted for its savagery with Waikato going down to the bottom of the cliffs and killing those who had survived the leap. When Anglican missionaries came to his region, Te Waharoa wished to have a missionary resident there and a mission station was established near Matamata pā in 1835. One of the first students at the mission school was Te Waharoa's son Tarapipipi, later known as Wiremu Tamihana. After a relative of Te Waharoa was murdered by a Te Arawa man, there were a number of skirmishes with Te Arawa in 1836. Ngāti Hauā, with support from other tribes, attacked and destroyed a Te Arawa pā and Phillip Tapsell's trading station at Maketu in March. Then in August Ngāti Hauā attacked Ngāti Whakaue at Ohinemutu in Rotorua. Te Waharoa fell ill in 1838. He probably had erysipelas, which his principal wife Rangi Te Wiwini died of at the time. Te Waharoa died at Matamata in early September 1838. Te Arahi, the eldest son of Te Waharoa and Rangi Te Wiwini, became the leader of Ngāti Hauā, before his younger brother Wiremu Tamihana Tarapipipi rose to prominence. Tamihana was a leader in the Māori King Movement, and became known as the kingmaker."

This was to be a life-changing mission for him. He accomplished his training, and also recorded Ethiopia's first music/songs on 17 double sided shellack disks. A not so wealthy young man when he departed, Eshete became one of the richest Ethiopians on his return to the country. He was paid 17,000 Gold Marks by Beka Rekords Berlin, and also earned continuous income from the sale of his disks which were reproduced by HMV Germany in 1912, Odeon Germany in 1931 and Odeon Milan during the brief Italian occupation of Ethiopia 1935-1941. Tessema was a jack of all trades. He was a poet, a wit, a painter, a sculptor, political appointee, explorer, developer and an accomplished photographer. His son Ato Yidnekachew Tessema (1921-1987) became \"the father of sport in Africa\" and wrote a biography of his father."

Rottanzi, (1867–1911) was a medical doctor who was on the San Francisco, California, Board of Supervisors in the late 19th century and was noted for introducing a law that banned the wearing of tall hats in theaters. As a short-term acting mayor he sought out ways of cutting indolence and waste in city government, and during a city crisis in which two boards of supervisors claimed to hold power, he was the only person serving on both bodies."

In 1806, during the same visit, he met New South Wales Governor Captain Philip Gidley King, who presented him with a medal which was later lost but then rediscovered and put up for auction in 2014. Te Pahi was incorrectly blamed for the burning of the Boyd in 1809 and his pā was bombarded by several whaling ships in retaliation in 1810. Te Pahi was wounded in the attack but his death several weeks later was as the result of other wounds he received in a conflict with Māori from the Whangaroa region over the Boyd affair."

Te Mahuki was a member of the warlike Ngati Maniapoto tribe who bitterly resented Pakeha settlement in New Zealand. He was fiercely opposed to all aspects of Paheka culture being adopted by Maori. He had taken part in the First Taranaki War in 1860 against the instructions of the Maori king. He led a kidnapping of a surveyor Charles Hursthouse, for whom he had a bitter hatred. Hursthouse and Wetere Te Rerenga were surveying the path of the North Island Main Trunk railway line on land that had been purchased by the government from Ngati Maniapoto when he was captured. Hurststone and the others escaped with the help of a rescue party. A few days later Te Mahuki and his followers marched on Pirongia hoping to provoke a government reaction. He was arrested and jailed. Later he and his followers took over stores in Te Kuiti and he was arrested again. He was jailed for 12 months. In 1897 he set fire to a store in Te Kuiti and was jailed again. He was certified insane and sent to Auckland Lunatic Asylum where he died."

  "text" : "Thomas Longman (1699 – 18 June 1755) was an English publisher who founded the publishing house of Longman. (Farnborough Hill) Longman was born at Bristol, the son of Ezekiel Longman and his second wife Sarah. The Longman family had been involved in the manufacture of soap for several generations and his father owned a shop and stalls in Temple Street. Longman's parents had died by the time he was nine. His father requested in his will that he be \"especially well and handsomely bred and educated\". From his mother he inherited a considerable amount of property at Winford, Winfrith, Rudghill and Stroud. When Longman was seventeen his guardians - his brother Ezekiel, Nathaniel Webb and Mrs Thomas Coules - apprenticed him for seven years to John Osbom, a bookseller in Lombard Street, London. In 1724, when his apprenticeship was ended, he purchased the business of John Taylor, a bookseller in Paternoster Row for £2,282. Taylor had been the first publisher of ' Robinson Crusoe', and traded at the sign of the Ship and Black Swan. In time, John Osborn entered into partnership with Longman, and they traded as 'J. Osbom & T. Longman' at the sign of the Ship. They were among the original shareholders of the Cyclopaedia, or an Universal Dictionary of Arts and Sciences of Ephraim Chambers which became very successful and profitable When Osborn, whose daughter became the wife of Longman, died in about 1734 Longman became sole owner of the business. He steadily increased the business by buying shares in sound literary properties. In 1740 he published the third volume of David Hume's first work,  A Treatise of Human Nature  after he had been introduced to Hume by Francis Hutcheson. In 1744 he held the largest number of shares of Chambers's ' Cyclopaedia,' owning nearly a sixth. He was one of the six booksellers who entered into an agreement with Samuel Johnson to produce an English dictionary, the ' Plan ' of which was issued in 1747. In 1753 he took into partnership his nephew Thomas who carried on the business. Longman died, apparently childless, on 18 June 1755. Longman married Mary Osborn, daughter of John Osborn in 1731. They had no children."

Maria Alekseyevna did not actively participate in the political plots of the Kremlin, but her open passive sympathy for Tsarevna Sophia Alekseyevna, Eudoxia Lopukhina and Alexei Petrovich, Tsarevich of Russia made her relationship to Tsar Peter tense. She maintained a contact with Eudoxia Lopukhina after Lopukhina had been placed in a convent, and passed messages and money between Lopukhina and her son Alexei Petrovich. When Alexei Petrovich left Russia, she met him on the way and brought a letter from him to his mother. After the arrest of Alexei, Maria was taken in custody accused of having assisted his escape. She was imprisoned, first in prison and then in house arrest in Saint Petersburg. She was released in 1721."

  "text" : "Terence Sellers (1952-2016) was a New York-based writer deeply involved in the Downtown Arts Scene. Her papers have been collected by New York University's Fales Library Downtown Collection. Terence Sellers was born in 1952 to Robert and Gloria Sellers in Washington, D.C.. From 1970-1973 she attended St. John's College in Santa Fe, New Mexico in the Classical Studies department but did not complete her degree. She earned a BA in forensic psychology at John Jay College in New York City in 1986. In 1973 Sellers moved to New York City intending to pursue a career in writing and dance. Shortly after moving to New York she formed friendships with artists and writers including Anya Phillips, Kathy Acker, Duncan Smith, Victor Bockris, Carl Apfelschnitt, Jimmy De Sana and Duncan Hannah, many of which resulted in collaborations. For example, Sellers and Hannah worked on several projects together, including Amos Poe's 1978 film The Foreigner. Around the same time Sellers worked with photographer Jimmy De Sana on a series of 32 photographs entitled \"The Dungeon Series\". The original intent of the project was to use the photographs in Sellers' then unpublished work The Correct Sadist. However, after the work was complete De Sana and William S. Burroughs used the photographs to illustrate their own book project, Submission. As a prolific writer, Sellers kept daily journals, maintained close correspondence with friends, family and colleagues, wrote a large volume of short stories and worked on several manuscripts. She was an early contributor to BOMB Magazine, X Magazine, Vacation and other publications devoted to New York's Downtown art, music, film and literary scene. Most of Sellers' writing is on the subject of sadomasochism. While her work as a professional dominatrix and her fascination with violence, self-punishment, the occult, and psychoanalysis has given shape to much of her writing, her literary influences include Baudelaire, Dostoevsky, and the French surrealists. Sellers' most famous work is a novel called the The Correct Sadist: The Memoirs of Angel Stern. It is written as a collection of short \"case studies\" relating to themes of sexual dominance and submission, bondage and discipline, and fetishism. Originally published by iKoo-Buchverlg in Berlin in 1981 as Der korrekte Sadismus, Sellers self-published the work in English under Vitriol Publications in 1983. In 1985, Grove Press contracted the novel and Barney Rosset handled its publication. It is also published in France, Italy, and the United Kingdom. Sellers' other published novels include The Obsession, and Dungeon Evidence: The Correct Sadist II. Excerpts from other manuscripts such as The Degenerate, Most Ill of All and One Decadent Life have appeared in a wide range of publications in several languages. Sellers participated in events such as The Times Square Show (1980) and has read her work throughout the US, Europe and Canada. Although Sellers did not achieve the name recognition and literary success of some of her contemporaries, she was an important and influential member of the Downtown scene."

  "text" : "Edward Thomas \"Ted\" Mason (born 30 January 1979) is a Yorkshire-born farmer best known for his accomplishments as a fell runner. He grew up in Appletreewick near Grassington. He went to Burnsall V.A. Primary School, then Upper Wharfedale School in Threshfield. Upon leaving school he pursued a career as a farmer, gaining a higher national diploma in agriculture from Newton Rigg College, part of Askham Bryan College. Mason is a member of the Wharfedale Harriers, the British Open Fell Runners Association (BOFRA) and the Fell Runners Association (FRA). His fell running career began when he was ten years old, finishing last in a local race, and his first race win was at the age of nineteen at Beamsley Beacon. Ted's first championship race win was in 1999 at the BOFRA Hawkswick Dash. Turning at the summit, he was lying in fifth, but he quickly gained places on the descent going on to win in 11 minutes 38 seconds, 31 seconds ahead of second place. Ted is most noted for his speed in descending, being cited by Alistair Dunn (BOFRA Champion 2006-11) as \"an inspiration from the start of my fell running career. I still don't know anyone who can descend faster\". Ted was crowned BOFRA Champion in 2002 and 2003, and came close to regaining the title in 2011. It was taken to the last race at Wasdale Show. Mason was leading the championship going into the race, but a result of fourth meant a finish of second overall in the series. In 2012, he was again victorious in the championship, also winning in 2014 and 2015. In 2011, Mason achieved a number of ambitions. On 20 August he won the race most local to him, the Burnsall Classic for the first time. This fell race is one of the oldest fell races, dating beyond 1870, with the first report of it appearing in the Craven Herald in 1888. Ted took a different route down the fell, going on to win by a twelve-second margin. Ten days later he would go on to win the crag race at Kilnsey Show also for the first time. It was his fifteenth attempt. Mason has made a couple of television appearances, appearing on the title screens for Look North News and more recently on The Dales hosted by Ade Edmondson on ITV, where Ted was documented training for the Burnsall Classic."

  "text" : "Thomas C. Marshall (December 14, 1851 – April 23, 1911) was a pioneer, lawyer, judge, and the 3rd Mayor of Missoula, Montana. He was born in Paducah, Kentucky, and elected county judge of Ballard County, Kentucky, when he was 28. He moved to Missoula in 1883 where he and Frank H. Woody formed the law firm \"Woody and Marshall\", which dissolved four years later. During this time on April 13, 1885, he was elected the 3rd mayor of Missoula, but he would resign four months later on August 6. He would be elected as a Democrat the following year to the Montana Territorial Legislature for two years and for a time was the Chairman of the Judiciary Committee. In 1892, Marshall switched from Democrat to Republican and ran on the Republican ticket for Congress in 1898 to replace retiring Charles S. Hartman but was defeated handily by Albert J. Campbell when Marshall split the vote with Silver Republican Thomas S. Hogan. After the dissolution of Woody and Marshall, Marshall became the lawyer of Andrew B. Hammond-controlled properties such as the Missoula Mercantile Company, First National Bank of Missoula, and the Big Blackfoot Milling Company. He would later serve as director of the bank and Vice-President of Hammond's South Missoula Land Company. He died April 23, 1911, in Fargo, North Dakota, en route to seeing a medical specialist."

He worked on several of van Meegeren's well known forgeries, including Frans Hals and Smiling Girl, a painting once thought to be a work of Dutch painter Johannes Vermeer, akin to his Girl with a Pearl Earring and donated by collector Andrew W. Mellon to the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C. in 1937. Van Wijngaarden often served as the front man, making the sales deals on van Meegeren's forgeries."

Presberg is known for his improvisation compositional technique- a method of composing music in one-take and on the spot; and which he attributes to his study of Jack Kerouac. KDHX describes Presberg's guitar technique as \"Like a storyteller, he spins effortless yarns written in jazz and punctuated with funk, calling for his listeners to follow him on his journey. Fresh and fluid yet rooted and evocative, his music simply tries to say what he feels must be said.\""

Lloyd was born in Silverdale, Auckland, New Zealand on 21 December 1863 to Henry and Hannah (née Miles) Lloyd. Lloyd’s work is evocative of the New Zealand bush and his work often contained Maori motifs. Lloyd exhibited with the Auckland Society of Arts in 1883, 1896, 1898, 1899 and 1907 and in 1927 at the New Zealand Academy of Fine Arts. Some examples of his work are available online. Lloyd was employed as an illustrator for New Zealand Illustrated Magazine from November 1901 until its last edition in 1905 (in which he was acknowledged). He also worked as an illustrator for Auckland Weekly News and as a cartoonist for The New Zealand Herald, retiring in 1936 after 34 years. Lloyd commissioned a house in Mount Eden that was built in 1925–26. Known as Whare Tane, the avant-garde residence is registered by Heritage New Zealand as a Category I building. One of his daughters, Connie (Constance Lloyd, 1895–1982) was an artist in her own right. Lloyd died on 11 September 1937, aged 73, in Auckland."

  "text" : "Tommy Allott (born 17 May 1908) was a motorcycle speedway rider who rode from the sport's earliest days in Britain until the 1950s. Allott was born in Denby Dale in 1908. He rode for Barnsley in 1928, joining Sheffield in 1931 and then the West Ham Hammers in 1932, but retired after being seriously injured in a crash while racing that year at West Ham. With a metal plate in his left arm, he made a comeback in 1935, riding as a reserve for the Belle Vue Aces, also riding that season in the Provincial League for Bristol and Nottingham. Struggling to regain his confidence, in 1938 he moved on to the Norwich Stars before joining Sheffield Tigers the following year. During World War II, Allott worked for Rolls Royce. When speedway returned after World War II, Rolls Royce gave him leave of absence to compete again in speedway and he rejoined Sheffield, his racing making him one of the top riders in the Northern League, including a run of 27 consecutive heat wins. In 1946 he reached the final of the British Riders' Championship. He stayed at Sheffield until 1949, joining Edinburgh Monarchs in 1950, but transferring back to Sheffield later that year. He moved to the Liverpool Chads for his final three seasons before retiring in 1953. Allott rode in several international matches, representing the Provincial League against Australia in 1937, England against the Dominion in 1938, and for Britain against the Overseas in 1950 and 1951. Tommy Allott died in May 1975. Allott's brother Guy Allott, nephew Nicky Allott and great nephew Adam Allott also became speedway riders."

Collins was most notable for his photography of the native New Zealand bush. Many of these images were included The Story of the Kauri , by A. H. Reed which was published in 1953. Furthermore, Collins work towards protecting the Kauri trees in Warkworth was instrumental for the local community and he was honored for this contribution by the Tudor Collins Drive which was established in his memory at Parry Kauri Park. However the subject of his photographs also extended beyond the New Zealand bush. The New Zealand Herald often recruited Collins to cover current events that were taking place around the country. For example, he was one of the first photographers in Napier after the Hawke’s Bay earthquake of 3 February 1931; he recorded the riots in Auckland’s Queen Street on 14 April 1932; and he was the only photographer to meet the passengers and crew from the mined Niagara on 19 June 1940. On a trip around the Pacific Ocean in 1953 he recorded Queen Elizabeth II’s visit to Fiji."

He was known as Duncan by his family, but friends and colleagues almost all referred to him as Torchy for his red hair, and the name stuck even after he had turned grey. New Zealand's tenth Premier, Sir Harry Atkinson, was his grandfather. Atkinson was the director of Fruit Research Station of the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research (DSIR), and later the director of the Plant Diseases Division. His research has contributed significantly to New Zealand's strong position as an exporter of fruit. After his retirement in 1974, he was commissioned to write the history of the DSIR. Atkinson died at Birkdale, Auckland, on 27 February 1990."

  "text" : "Alfred Albert Thomas William Adams (24 June 1842 – 1 June 1919), known as Thomas William Adams, was a New Zealand farmer, forester, churchman and educationalist. He was born in Graveley, Cambridgeshire, England on 24 June 1842. In 1862 he emigrated to New Zealand on the African. He bought 100 acres (40 ha) of virgin tussock land at Greendale in Canterbury in 1865 and converted them to farmland. The area prospered over the next few years as more farmers developed land. Adams married Lucy Pannett in 1867 and they had a daughter the following year. Lucy drowned in 1869. Adams married her sister Harriet in 1872, and they had five sons and three daughters together. Adams was a pioneer in planting trials, obtaining seeds from correspondents around the world, keeping records and publishing the results. He started planting trees in 1868 for shelter and fuel, and by 1908 had created an arboretum of 800 species. His recommendation of Pinus radiata and other pines influenced early New Zealand forestry. In 1913 he was a member of the Royal Commission on Forestry, and in 1918 he became a lifetime member of the New Zealand Forestry League. For 40 years, Adams taught Sunday school at Greendale, which began by teaching local children to read. He was instrumental in the formation of the Greendale day school in 1872, and served on the North Canterbury Education Board from 1892 to 1918, serving as chairman from 1897 to 1905. He was also a governor of Canterbury College (now University of Canterbury) from 1897 until his death. He was the first secretary of the Canterbury Baptist Association, and later its president. Adams died at Greendale on 1 June 1919 and was buried there. His will left £2000 and 98 acres (40 ha) of land to Canterbury College to be used for a school of forestry. Harriet died 15 January 1934 and was buried with him. The school of forestry opened in 1924, and about 1975 a T.W. Adams Scholarship was set up to support postgraduate forestry students."

Henry Baker Tristram, vicar of Eglingham; the geologist and naturalist Henry Baker Tristram was his elder brother. Tristram was educated at Durham School and matriculated at Lincoln College, Oxford on 11 November 1843. He was a Crewian Exhibitioner from 1843 to 1851 and Boden Sanskrit Scholar in 1848. He graduated as a Bachelor of Civil Law in 1850 and a Doctor of Civil Law in 1854. Tristram entered the Inner Temple and was called to the Bar of Doctors' Commons on 21 November 1855. He joined the Northern Circuit and was later appointed Judge of the Consistory Court of London. He was Chancellor of the Dioceses of London, Hereford, Ripon, Wakefield and Chichester, and Commissary-General of the Diocese of Canterbury. He was author of a Treatise on the Contentious Probate Practice in the High Court of Justice. His chambers were at 12 King's Bench Walk. On 21 March 1881 he was made a Queen's Counsel. On 26 October 1861 Tristram married Flora, younger daughter of the Very Rev. Thomas John de Burgh, Dean of Cloyne, by his wife Lady Annie-Louisa, sister of John Hely-Hutchinson, 3rd Earl of Donoughmore; they had two sons and two daughters. Tristram lived variously at Dalton Hill, Albury, Surrey, at Queen Anne's Mansions, St James's Park, London, and at The Elms, London Road, Hampton. A motion to dissolve the society of Doctors' Commons was entered on 13 January 1858 and the last meeting took place on 10 July 1865. The fellows did not formally surrender their offices, nor in the end their charter, but the society perished with the death of Tristram, its last fellow. The buildings of Doctors' Commons were sold in 1865 and demolished soon after. The site is now largely occupied by the Faraday building."

He was turned away at the border, and the poison impounded. His intentions were never clear, as he hanged himself in his jail cell four days after being arrested by the FBI on terrorism charges more than two years after the incident was first reported. Some media outlets called the incident a \"thwarted terrorist attack\" resulting in the death of the perpetrator, while others have suggested Lavy was the innocent victim of a \"tragic case\" of an overzealous FBI agent and prosecutor. One journalist opined this may well be \"another case where the government hounds some poor guy without mercy...until he kills himself\"."

  "text" : "Tom Long (born 1958) is a lawyer and political activist. He is a director of the Manning Centre for Building Democracy. He chaired former Ontario premier Mike Harris’s victorious 1995 and 1999 election campaigns and was one of the authors of Harris' Common Sense Revolution platform. Long was president of the Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario from 1986 to 1989. In 1983, Long was Brian Mulroney's youth campaign chair for the 1983 federal Progressive Conservative leadership convention and served as an executive assistant in the Prime Minister's Office from 1984 to 1986, during Mulroney's tenure as Prime Minister of Canada. Long co-chaired the founding convention of the Canadian Alliance in January 2000 and was a candidate for the party's leadership later that year placing third with 18.16% of the vote. Long was an advisor to Ontario PC leader Tim Hudak in the 2014 provincial election. He and Hudak's campaign manager, Ian Robertson, steered Hudak into promising to slash 100,000 civil service jobs. The often-repeated assertion was cited by party members and commentators as a principal reason for the Tories' disastrous rout. A lawyer by profession, Long is a former partner of Egon Zehnder and Russell Reynolds Associates, who set up his own Governance and Executive Search firm, Tom Long Consulting, in early 2014."

But succession crisis started almost immediately with Muhammad Shah ibn Feroze Shah staking his claim with the support of his brother Fateh Khan’s brother Zafar Khan's son Abu Bakr Khan. Tughluq Khan dispatched troops against his uncle towards the foot of the hills of Sirmur. Muhammad Shah ibn Feroze Shah after a brief battle took shelter in the fort of Nagarkot, and Tughluq Khan’s army returned to Delhi without pursuing him any further due to the difficulties of the venture & terrain. Eventually though some Amirs joined Abu Bakr Khan son of Zafar Khan and Fateh Khan’s brother Zafar Khan's son and grandson of Sultan Feroze Shah Tughluq and plotted to assassinate Tughluq Khan. In 1389 they surrounded the Sultan and Khan Jahan, his vizier and, put them to death and hung up their heads over the gate of the city; the duration of the reign of Tughluq Khan, was five months and eighteen days."
