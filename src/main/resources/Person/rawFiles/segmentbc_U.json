  "text" : "Uri Bar-Joseph is a professor in The Department for International Relations of The School for Political Science at Haifa University. He specializes in national security, intelligence studies and the Arab-Israeli conflict. He earned his PhD in 1990 from Stanford University, under the supervision of Alexander George. His dissertation, Intelligence intervention in the Politics of Democratic States: The US, Israel, and Britain was published by Penn State Press and won Choice’s Outstanding Academic Books Award for 1996. Bar-Joseph is best known for his studies of the intelligence failure of the Yom Kippur War. His book, The Watchman Fell Asleep (SUNY, 2005), is the first detailed academic study of the subject and is considered the most important study in this field. The Hebrew edition (2001) won the Israeli Political Science Association Best Book Award in 2002. The Israeli made docudrama, \"The Silence of the Sirens\", which is based on this book won the Israeli Academy award for the best television feature film in 2004 . In 2016, Bar-Joseph published 'The Angel:The Egyptian spy who saved Israel'(HarperCollins), which recounts the story of Ashraf Marwan (code-named by the Mossad \"The Angel\"), who was President Gamal Abdel Nasser’s son in law, and an Israeli spy. Marwan’s early warning, on the eve of the Yom Kippur War, that war will break the following day, convinced Israeli leaders to order the mobilization of the reserve army and this early mobilization prevented the complete occupation of the Golan Heights on the second day of the war. Marwan continued working for the Israeli intelligence services till 1998. His true identity as an Israeli spy was leaked to the press by the former Chief of Military Intelligence Eli Zeira, who had served in this capacity during the Yom Kippur War. The document written by Bar-Joseph about this leak served as the basis for the official charges pressed by senior Israeli intelligence officers against Zeira, charging him with leaking the identity of the most important spy in Israel’s history whose warning had effectively saved the country in 1973. A judicial inquiry proved that Zeira ineed had leaked the name. Bar-Joseph most recent book (co-authored with Rose McDermott) titled \"Intelligance Success and Failure: A comparative Study\" will be published by Oxford UP towards the end of 2016."

According to official North Korean state media, U graduated from Kim Il-sung University with a philosophy degree. He later served in a number of minor posts in the Organization and Guidance Department of the Workers' Party of Korea before being moved to a leading position in the Ministry of State Security (or State Security Department) in the 1990s. He was promoted to colonel-general, member of the National Defence Commission, and first vice-minister of State Security in 2009. This put him in charge of the ministry and gave him access to the country's top echelon, as the ministry was reportedly under Kim Jong-il directly, and he accompanied Kim Jong-il on a number of tours and official events, including a dinner with former US President Bill Clinton. On 28 September 2010, the 3rd Party Conference elevated him to member of the Politburo and the Central Military Commission; the day before he had been promoted to general of the Korean People's Army. After Kim Jong-il's death in December 2011, U was seen accompanying the late leader's hearse and was reported having a role in purging the Ministry of State Security to ensure loyalty to Kim Jong-un. He has disappeared from public since February 2012 and his posts had been taken over by Kim Won-hong by April 2012. In July 2013, U Tong-chuk showed up along with other former officials at events marking the 60th anniversary of the end of the Korean War."

  "text" : "Urbain Boiret (6 September 1731 – 5 November 1774) was a priest born in France who came to Canada and became a pivotal superior of the Séminaire de Québec. Boiret came to Canada in 1755 with another priest, Henri-François Gravé de La Rive. His intention was to be part of the mission to the Tamaroa tribe in Illinois but his services were needed at the Séminaire de Québec. There he was to fill a number of offices, including that of bursar and professor of theology. He was appointed a director of the seminary in 1759. This also marked the beginning of the Siege of Quebec. Only Urbain and one other priest, Joseph-André-Mathurin Jacrau, remained at the seminary to manage the affairs of the seminary. However, almost everything was destroyed and Boiret, as bursar of the seminary, moved to Saint-Joachim to take stock of the situation and regroup. Boiret returned to Québec in 1761, and by 1764 he had been elected superior of the Séminaire de Québec. It was during his tenure as superior that the reconstruction of the seminary took place. He served briefly as superior again before his death. A 19th-century priest, Bishop Edmond Langevin discovered documentation regarding Boiret. The Holy See had conferred on him a Protonotary apostolic which he had not revealed to his fellow priests. The honour would have entitled him to be addressed as “Monseigneur”. Various place names are part of his legacy such as Saint-Urbain."
