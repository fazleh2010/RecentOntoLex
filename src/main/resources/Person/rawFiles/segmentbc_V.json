He is an amateur astronomer and member of the Amateur Astronomy Association \"Achyrostrata\" (named for an ancient word for our galaxy used by local people), based in the Delphi Municipality. Vasilis Kanatas is the author of the book Astrology of the 13 Signs of the Zodiac published in May 2011 by Klaudios Ptolemaios Publications. In this he introduces a new, speculative astrological theory which includes Ophiuchus to employ 13 zodiac constellations and proposes the replacement of the ascendant with the place of the Moon on the ecliptic. He also argues that sunspots have an important role in astrology because of their well-documented impact on the Earth and its people.In his book, Kanatas suggested the Greek letter phi (Φ) as the symbol for the sign of Ophiuchus, from the Greek word for Ophiuchus, \"ΟΦΙΟΥΧΟΣ\""

  "text" : "Vincent Harris is an American conservative political strategist and the CEO of Harris Media, an online communications firm based in Austin, Texas. He is currently an adjunct faculty member at Baylor University. Harris joined Mike Huckabee's 2008 Presidential campaign just a few months after it was announced, working as the campaign's official blogger. The following year, Harris served as Online Director for Bob McDonnell's successful gubernatorial campaign. McDonnell's online campaign, considered highly successful, was one of the first major Republican campaigns to embrace social media. Harris' work has been featured in publications such as The Weekly Standard, and the Washington Post.His commentary on online media has appeared in CNN, Politico, the Washington Post, the Richmond Times Dispatch, the Minneapolis Star Tribune, the Washington Internet Daily, and ABC News Harris has been active in the 2012 Presidential campaign. He first served as the online strategist for Rick Perry. After Perry dropped out of the race and endorsed Newt Gingrich, Harris was hired to help the Gingrich campaign's online and social media operations. In 2012, National Journal named him one of ten Republicans to follow on Twitter. In 2012, Harris led the digital operations of Senator Ted Cruz's campaign. This digital campaign contributed in making Cruz the next U.S. Senator from Texas. The aggressive, grassroots-centric digital approach was unlike anything previously seen in Texas. Read the full 2012 case study on Ted Cruz. Working alongside Senator Mitch McConnell's 2014 campaign as lead digital director, Harris brought \"a new era of social campaigning for Republicans\" through social media integration. Straying from the typical communication plan centered on traditional media, Harris created a brand new, modernized platform skyrocketing the Senator's following. Armed with a social media strategy, McConnell won the 2014 Kentucky Primary Election and will contest the upcoming November elections utilizing the same digital expertise. Harris was featured in an article courtesy of Bloomberg Politics titled, \"The Man Who Invented The Republican Internet\". Harris was hired by Senator Rand Paul's political operation, joining Senator Paul's 2016 team as the top digital strategist. Harris will sit at the \"top of the leadership team\" providing digital strategy expertise pertaining to data collection, website design and social media tactics, to name a few. In 2015 Harris was reported to have been hired by the Likud Party campaign. His recognition as a GOP digital media guru had gone global after being appointed head of the re-election campaign for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. “I love Israel, and I am excited to be here to help the Likud and the prime minister use digital media in an effective and forward-looking manner.”— Vincent Harris, The Hill The May/June 2015 edition of Politico Magazine profiled Vincent Harris and his firm, which they dubbed \"Rand Paul's Digital Army,\" saying of Harris Media LLC: “has amassed a marquee roster of conservative clients, from Sarah Palin to Rand Paul, and established itself as the buzziest GOP firm of the cycle.”— Tom Bartlett, Politico Magazine Vincent Harris's digital work for Senator Rand Paul contributed to his selection as one of the Washington Examiner's \"New Voices for 2015,\" which they define as, \"the intellectuals, policymakers, think tank leaders, campaign operatives, candidates, pols, pundits, wonks and others who are pushing our thinking and testing the limits of political possibility.\" His work with Senator Paul was not short of criticism, though. In October of 2015, Harris was behind Paul live-streaming an entire day on the campaign trail. By the end of the day, Paul had enough and called it a \"dumbass livestream.\" The comment from Paul brought about a flurry of negative attention to an already slumped campaign. “I wish I knew [why the campaign was live-streaming an entire day]. I’ve been saying, I don’t want to do this, I don’t want to do this and now we’re doing this.”— Rand Paul, The Washington Post In June of 2016, POLITICO reported that Donald Trump's presidential campaign had hired Harris and his team to work for the campaign. Harris appeared to agree with the claim by tweeting a picture of Trump giving a thumbs up soon after the news broke. The next day, Breitbart News interviewed Harris and discovered that Harris was only used as a subcontractor through Trump's actual digital firm for a single project. Harris is currently attending the University of Texas working towards his PhD."

Alesana was elected President of the opposition Tautua Samoa Party in February 2011, a post he held until his death later in the year. He opposed Prime Minister's Tuilaepa Aiono Sailele Malielegaoi re-election bid in the March 2011 general election. However, Malielegaoi's was returned to office in the election. Va'aelua Eti Alesana died in Samoa on Friday, September 30, 2011. The leader of Tautua Samoa, Palusalue Fa’apo II, said that \"We are really saddened by this. He has done so much for the party.\" Alesana was buried in his native village of Lalomalava, Savai'i. In his eulogy, Palusalue Fa’apo II told mourners, \"Va'aelua always maintained a positive attitude and before the General Elections last March, he kept encouraging the Tautua Samoa members to stay positive, despite the odds being stacked against us.\""

  "text" : "Vasilis Zenetzis (in Greek: Βασίλης Ζενετζής) is a modern Greek painter. Born in Alikarnassos, Heraklion, Crete in 1935 and died in Athens in 2016. He painted seascapes, landscapes by a style he invented and named quadrature and presented his work in solo exhibitions: \n* Parnassus 1977 \n* Heraklion 1980, \n* Caravel 1980 His paintings were sold in major exhibitions of the world as in Sotheby's, Christie's in London. As a member of \"Greek Chamber of Fine Arts\", in 2014 were being a recognized painter by the Ministry of Culture of Greece. Zenetzis, began his artistic education at the age of fifteen at the Colourist School of Crete and by the age of seventeen he had his first solo exhibition at the Theotokopoulos Exhibition Rooms in Heraklion, Crete. His talent, was recognised at an early age, which helped his professional career in art once he arrived and settled in Athens after 1974. Zenetzis, became a respected and appreciated Athenian artist in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Such was his popularity that he could not cope with the enormous demand. However, such success brought with it problems of integrity in his art and his production and by 1985 he was neglected and shied away by investors and collectors. By early 1990 Zenetzis re-appeared as an impressionist/divisionist artist with an international appeal, with many exhibitions to his CV in London, Athens, USA plus many auction sales at the top auctions. At the age of 76, he has a great body of work behind him but gradually stopped painting. The work of 1975-2005 is serious and the best pieces in his oeuvre were created between the years 1990–2005. Vasilis Zenetzis can no longer paint because he is dead, and prior to that had an incurable disease that paralyzes the limbs."

  "text" : "Vera Manuel (1949–2010) was Secwepemc-Ktunaxa, daughter of cultural leader Marceline Paul and political leader George Manuel, Sr, born in 1949. She grew up on the Neskonlith Reservation in the interior of British Columbia, and lived for many years in Vancouver, Canada, where she died in January 2010. She worked as a playwright, poet, writer, healer and educator, in diverse communities across North America. She wrote and produced numerous plays about cultural oppression and genocide,as an independent artist and through Storytellers Theatre, including The Strength of Indian Women and Every Warrior's Song. Her poetry and short stories were published in journals and anthologies, and—like her plays—performed at a variety of venues across Canada and the US. Her play, Strength of Indian Women was staged throughout North America and published in the book, Two Plays about Residential Schools (along with Larry Loyie). Her work was honoured with inclusion at the Native American Women Playwrights Program, housed at Maima University, in Oxford, Ohio."

  "text" : "Van Nelson (born November 24, 1945) is an American former long-distance runner. An Olympian in 1968, he won long-distance track doubles at both the 1967 World Student Games and the 1967 Pan American Games. Born in Minneapolis, Nelson attended Washburn High School and began competing in middle distance events there. He broke the school record for the mile run and was ranked fifth nationally as a high school runner in 1964. He graduated that year (later being inducted into the school's hall of fame) and went on to study at St. Cloud State University. He competed collegiately for the St. Cloud State Huskies in NAIA competitions. He was the team's captain in both track and field and cross country and won seven titles and 12 All-American honours during his four years representing the institution. He was inducted into the St. Cloud Hall of Fame in 1983, featuring in the second group of athletes to be given the honour. At the Drake Relays, he won both the three-mile and six-mile races three times consecutively from 1966 to 1968. The 1967 season was the peak of Nelson's career. He won the Amateur Athletic Union six-mile title then completed a 5000 meters/10,000 meters track double at the 1967 World Student Games. He repeated this feat at the 1967 Pan American Games in Winnipeg, becoming the second man to complete the long-distance double after Argentina's Osvaldo Suárez. Nelson made his Olympic debut in the 10,000 m at the 1968 Summer Olympics in Mexico City. He was not used to the hot conditions or altitude and his performance suffered as a result. In spite of being ranked eighth in the world for that event, he finished in 29th place with a time of 31:40.2 minutes. Although, he had not performed well, he was pleased to have represented his country at the competition. Nelson returned to his studies at St. Cloud State in 1969, but the year after he suffered a serious back injury due to heavy lifting and the surgery that followed impaired his running ability. He made his last international appearance in 1971 and retired thereafter, although he continued running for pleasure. Nelson has retired from his job as a health teacher, although he still substitute teaches. He still serves as a girls track and field coach at South View Middle School in Edina, Minnesota."

Toya Montou was not the only woman to serve in the Haitian army during the revolution, but mostly, the names of the female soldiers are forgotten; other exceptions are Marie-Jeanne Lamartiniére, who served at the Battle of Crête-à-Pierrot in 1802, and Sanité Belair. Before the revolution, Montou had worked alongside Dessalines as a slave. She was described as intelligent and energetic, and shared a close relationship with Dessalines and the same hatred toward slavery. During the slave rebellion and civil war, she fought as a soldier in active service; on at least one documented occasion, she commanded soldiers in action during battle. In 1804, Dessalines became emperor. When Montou was dying, the emperor demanded the doctor to treat her as he would him, and stated that Toya was his aunt who had shared his feelings since before the revolution. She was given a state funeral with a procession of eight sergeants and Empress Marie-Claire Heureuse"

  "text" : "Victoire Jean-Baptiste (1861–1923), known as \"La Belle Victoire\", was a Haitian politician de facto, mistress to president Florvil Hyppolite and highly influential during his reign. She had previously been the mistress of Hyppolite's successor, Tirésias Simon Sam, and was granted immunity by him after the death of Florvil Hyppolite. Victoire Jean-Baptiste was a poor illiterate from the country side outside Cap-Haitien. In 1886, she was temporarily the mistress of Tirésias Simon Sam. After this, she was a servant to Geline Hyppolite, spouse of Florvil Hyppolite, and the lover of their son, Chéry Hyppolite. When Florvil Hyppolite became president in 1889, Victoire Jean-Baptiste was moved to the presidential palace in Port-au-Prince, and after the death of Chery in 1893, she functioned openly as the first lady of Haiti in official ceremonies. She had a great influence in the affairs of state. The president stated that her will in political matters should be respected : she played a great role in the appointment of offices and was regularly given large sums from the state to her private projects, such as a sugar plantation. In 1894, her support made Tirésias Simon Sam minister of war. At the death of Florvil Hyppolite in 1896, she sought refuge at the French embassy. The successor of Hippolyte, however, was Tirésias Simon Sam, who had promised Hyppolite to treat her well because of her service to the state. She settled in Cap-Haitien with Edward Jerome from Martinique and lived on her fortune. She was given a very bad name in the history of Haiti. She shared with President Hyppolite the practice of Haitian Vodou and their common origin in the North of Haiti. During Hyppolite's presidency she became the owner of two properties in the North: Bayeux and Pétro and a few houses in Cap-Haitien."

He was born in Danbury, Iowa and came to Lacombe, Alberta with his family while still young. In 1908, he was working in lumber camps on Vancouver Island and, the following year, joined the Canadian Pacific Railway, where he worked as a fireman and train engineer stationed in Revelstoke. Segur ran unsuccessfully for a seat in the provincial assembly in 1933. He was first elected to the assembly in a 1943 by-election held following the death of Harry Johnston but he was defeated when he ran for reelection in 1945 and 1949. He retired from the railway in 1952 and was again elected to the assembly later that year. Segur retired from politics in 1956 and moved to Vernon. He died in Burnaby of a heart attack at the age of 77."

Jacobus van Eynden, also known as Jacobus II, the older brother of Roeland, born at Nymegen in 1733, studied art under his father, and painted principally watercolour pictures of flowers, fruit, animals, and views of towns. He, however, devoted a large portion of his time to science. He died at Nymegen in 1824. Frans van Eynden, uncle of Roeland and Jacobus, born at Nymegen in 1694, studied under Elias van Nymegen at Rotterdam. Aided by the counsels of Chevalier Van der Werf, he painted Arcadian scenes, which he executed in the manner of Jan van Huysum, but not with equal perfection. His skies and distances are serene and delicate, and the clouds illumined by the sun are pleasingly reflected in the waters. His scenes are skilfully varied, and the different kinds of trees characterized with a neat and masterly touch; his figures also are well painted, and disposed with judgment. He seldom signed his pictures, unless required to do so by the purchaser. He died at Nymegen in 1742."

  "text" : "Vicki Lansky (née Rogosin; born January 6, 1942) is an American author and publisher. Feed Me I'm Yours began as a local fund raising cookbook for the Minneapolis Chapter of the Childbirth Education Association (CEA) in 1974. Vicki, a new mother and recent New York City transplant to suburban Minneapolis, had not been familiar with local group 'favorite-recipe' fund raising cookbooks. Vicki, then a stay-at-home mom and CEA volunteer suggested this idea at a meeting. CEA said \"Sure. Do it and we'll see.\" Vicki rounded up five friends (Jill Jacobson, Stephanie Keane, Norine Larson, Mary Popehn & Lois Parker)—some from CEA and some not. She presented an outline of a cookbook that would be of interest to new moms, beginning with making baby food. With only two group working meetings and one name ever suggested for the cookbook, the project was presented to CEA, who agreed to fund its first printing. In the Sunday food section of the Minneapolis Star and Tribune (December 1, 1974), food editor Mary Hart featured Vicki Lansky and the cookbook. This inspired Vicki and her husband, Bruce Lansky, who had worked in sales and marketing, to start a publishing company. Meadowbrook Press (as they lived on Meadowbrook Lane) was created to sell Feed Me I'm Yours nationally. When their marriage ended in the early 1980s, so did their business partnership. He got the business; she got the lake-front home."

  "text" : "Vincenzo Pesce (Rosarno, May 27, 1959), also known as Cenzo, is an Italian criminal and a member of the 'Ndrangheta, a Mafia-type organisation in Calabria. He is based in Rosarno and heads the Pesce 'ndrina. The son of Francesco Pesce, a historical boss of the clan, he heads the family with his brothers Antonio, Giuseppe, Rocco and Salvatore Pesce. When he was released from prison in 2008, he took over the command over the clan, despite opposition by his nephew Francesco Pesce, known as \"Cicciu testuni\" and the son of the boss Antonino Pesce who is in jail since 1993. He was an important power behind the decision to appoint Domenico Oppedisano as capo crimine – the ceremonial head of the 'Ndrangheta – in August 2009. The election of Oppedisano had not been easy. Giuseppe Pelle aspired to replace his ailing father Antonio Gambazza Pelle as capo crimine and keep the title in San Luca at the risk of triggering a conflict between clans. However, Vincenzo Pesce felt that the nomination of Pelle would distort the equilibrium in the 'Ndrangheta and threatened to form a separate organization taking some 30 locali – local 'Ndrangheta organisations – with him. As a result, Oppedisano became the capo crimine instead of Pelle. On April 28, 2010, the clan was hit in a police operation, known as Operation All Inside, that led to the arrest of 30 people accused of Mafia association including Vincenzo Pesce. On September 20, 2011, at the All Inside trial, he was sentenced to 20 years in prison."

She was educated at her fathers school Palmgrenska samskolan, the first co educational school in Europe, and was herself active there as a teacher in 1896-1907. She graduated as a Doctor of Philosophy in Roman philology from the University of Uppsala in 1905, and was employed as a Teaching assistant at the Kungliga biblioteket. In 1910, Palmgren was elected in to the Stockholm City Council. Valfrid Palmgren worked for reforms in the policy of the Swedish library's: she demanded the public libraries to be open for all; that the loans were to be free of charge; that there should be a public library accessible in each city; and that the libraries should be free from political, commercial and religious censorship. She managed to have all her demands met and introduced to government policy, and is mainly remembered for this. She married the Dane Jon Julius Munch-Petersen in 1911 and moved to Denmark. She became the mother of Gustaf Munch-Petersen. In Denmark, she became a member of the board of the public libraries in Copenhagen in 1918."

He earned international recognition as a polymer scientist and engineer by using high-energy radiation to synthesize and modify polymers via degradation, cross-linking, and grafting. His work in applying membrane science contributed to the development of flame-resistant textiles, plastic bottles that prevent soft drinks from going flat, and super-absorbent paper towels and diapers. In addition, he researched chemical modifications of cellulose and investigated the application of polymers to textiles, pulp, and paper."

  "text" : "Victor Schlegel (1843–1905) was a German mathematician. He is remembered for promoting the geometric algebra of Hermann Grassmann and for a method of visualizing polytopes called Schlegel diagrams. In the nineteenth century there were various expansions of the traditional field of geometry through the innovations of hyperbolic geometry, non-Euclidean geometry and algebraic geometry. Hermann Grassmann was one of the more advanced innovators with his anticipation of linear algebra and multilinear algebra that he called \"Extension theory\" (Ausdehnungslehre). As recounted by David E. Rowe in 2010: The most important new convert was Victor Schlegel, Grassmann’s colleague at Stettin Gymnasium from 1866 to 1868. Afterward Schlegel accepted a position as Oberlehrer at the Gymnasium in Waren, a small town in Mecklenburg. In 1872 Schlegel published the first part of his System der Raumlehre which used Grassmann’s methods to develop plane geometry. Schlegel used his book to put forth Grassmann’s case, arguing that\"Grassmann’s ideas had been neglected because he had not held a university chair.\"Continuing his criticism of academics, Schlegel expressed the reactionary view that Rather than developing a sound basis for their analytic methods, contemporary mathematicians tended to invent new symbolisms on an ad hoc basis, creating a Babel-like cacophony of unintelligible languages. Schlegel’s attitude was that no basis for scientific method was shown in mathematics, and \"neglect of foundations had led to the widely acknowledged lack of interest in mathematics in the schools.\" The mathematician Felix Klein addressed Schlegel’s book in a review criticizing him for neglect of cross ratio and failure to contextualize Grassmann in the flow of mathematical developments. Rowe indicates that Klein was most interested in developing his Erlangen program.In 1875 Schlegel countered with the second part of his System der Raumlehre, answering Klein in the preface. This part developed conic sections, harmonic ranges, projective geometry, and determinants. Schlegel published a biography of Hermann Grassmann in 1878. Both parts of his textbook, and the biography, are now available at the Internet Archive; see External links section below. At the Summer meeting of the American Mathematical Society on August 15, 1894, Schlegel presented an essay on the problem of finding the place which is at a minimum total distance from given points. In 1899 Schlegel became German national secretary for the international Quaternion Society and reported on it in Monatshefte für Mathematik."

  "text" : "Sir Victor Ewings Negus, MS, FRCS (6 February 1887 – 15 July 1974) was a British surgeon who specialised in laryngology and also made fundamental contributions to comparative anatomy with his work on the structure and evolution of the larynx. He was born and educated in London, studying at King's College School, then King's College London, followed by King's College Hospital. The final years of his medical training were interrupted by the First World War, during which he served with the Royal Army Medical Corps. After the war, he qualified as a surgeon and studied with laryngologists in France and the USA before resuming his career at King's College Hospital where he became a junior surgeon in 1924. In the 1920s, Negus worked on aspects of both throat surgery and the anatomy of the larynx, the latter work contributing to his degree of Master of Surgery (1924). His surgical innovations included designs for laryngoscopes, bronchoscopes, oesophagoscopes, an operating table, and tracheotomy equipment. His major publications were The Mechanism of the Larynx (1929) and his work on the clinical text Diseases of the Nose and Throat, starting with the fourth edition of 1937. Negus was also awarded several lectureships and published many medical papers and other works on comparative anatomy and laryngology. He became a senior surgeon at King's College Hospital in 1940 and a consulting surgeon in 1946. Negus was one of the founders of the British Association of Otorhinolaryngologists, helping to establish his speciality as a discipline within the newly formed National Health Service. He was a member of numerous international and national otolaryngology organisations, and presided over the Fourth International Congress of Otolaryngology in London in 1949. In this period of his career following the Second World War he also worked on the anatomy of the paranasal sinuses, and played a key role in rebuilding and establishing collections of animal dissections used by comparative anatomists. Negus, who married in 1929 and had two sons, retired in 1952, though he continued to publish on comparative anatomy and the history of medicine. His honours before and after retirement included the Fellowship of King's College, London (1945), an honorary degree (1950), the Lister Medal (1954), a knighthood (1956), honorary fellowships of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh (1949) and the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland (1958), and the Honorary Gold Medal of the Royal College of Surgeons of England (1969). He died in Hindhead, Surrey, aged 87 in 1974."

  "text" : "Vern McGrew (December 7, 1929 – January 9, 2012) was an American high jumper. He competed in the high jump event at the 1948 Summer Olympics at the age of eighteen. He used the western roll technique, which was common at the time, and in 1948 achieved a career best clearance of 2.04 meters (6 ft 8¼ in). Born in Big Spring, Texas, he went on to attend Lamar High School in Houston, graduating in 1946. That year he won the Texan state championship with a state record jump. He gained a place at Rice University and competed for the Rice Owls athletic team under their coach Emmett Brunson. McGrew became the second Rice alumnus to take part in an Olympic event, after Claude Bracey in 1928. The 1948 Olympics was his only major international appearance but he achieved some success at national level. While studying at Rice University he competed at the NCAA Championship, coming third in 1948 and finishing as runner-up in 1949. He completed this upward trend by winning the NCAA high jump title in 1950 with a jump of over two meters (6 ft 7 in). At the national-level AAU Championship meeting he was third in 1948 (where he gained Olympic selection), but managed only fifth place the year after. McGrew undertook post-graduate study at the University of Texas and later the University of Texas Law School. He signed up for military service from 1954 to 1956. He did not take part in athletics in his later life and instead used his studies to gain a placement at Humble Oil, at which he spent 30 years of his working life. He retired in the 1980s and lived until the age of 82. He died at Methodist Hospital in Houston."

  "text" : "Veronika of Desenice (died 17 October 1425) (Croatian: Veronika Desinićka; Slovene: Veronika Deseniška) was the second wife of Frederick II, Count of Celje. Little is known of her early life. It is believed the name Deseniška derives from the village of Desinić in Croatia, where Frederick also had extensive estates, and it appears in the forms Dessnitz, Dessenitz, Desnicze, Teschnitz, Teschenitz, and Dessewitz in various historical sources. Veronika was minor nobility and Frederick's father Hermann II was greatly opposed to the marriage. The chronicles of the Counts of Celje suggest he had his son arrested and, while holding him prisoner, initiated a trial against Veronika accusing her of witchcraft. She was acquitted by the court, but despite this incarcerated in Ojstrica Castle near Tabor and murdered (supposedly on the orders of Hermann II) by being drowned in 1425. She was buried in Braslovče and a few years later Frederick arranged for her remains to be reburied at the Carthusian monastery at Jurklošter and in her memory also made an endowment to the monastery at Bistra. Veronika and Frederick's tragic love story, which also marked the beginning of the end of the House of Cilli, has been an inspiration for numerous literary creations. Among others, she was the protagonist of Josipina Turnograjska's 1851 story Nedolžnost in sila (Innocence and Force), Josip Jurčič's 1880 play Veronika Deseniška, Oton Župančič's 1924 play Veronika Deseniška, Bratko Kreft's 1932 play Celjski Grofje (The Counts of Celje), Danilo Švara's 1946 opera Veronika Deseniška, Franček Rudolf's 1968 play Celjski grof na žrebcu (The Count of Celje on a Stallion) and 1974 play Veronika, and Dušan Čater's 1996 children's novel Veronika Deseniška. She has also inspired works in Croatian, German, Czech, and Italian. The Veronika Poetry Award and the Veronika Festival are named after Veronika of Desenice."
