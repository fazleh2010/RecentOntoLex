While working for the Federal Communications Commission in the administration of Franklin D. Roosevelt during the 1940s, he became the target of an early congressional crusade against alleged communist sympathizers and subversives. A 1943 amendment to an emergency war appropriations bill deprived Dodd and two other federal officials of their salary and positions. Three years later, the United States Supreme Court declared the law’s provision to be an unconstitutional bill of attainder. Dodd was the son of William E. Dodd, who served as United States Ambassador to Germany between 1933 and 1938, and the brother of Martha Dodd, who had affairs with Nazis and a Soviet NKVD agent before becoming an accused secret agent of the Soviet Union."

  "text" : "William Tyler Moore, Sr., known as W. T. \"Bill\" Moore (April 9, 1918 – May 27, 1999), was an attorney and businessman in Bryan, Texas, who was a conservative Democratic member of the Texas State Senate from District 5 from 1967 until 1981. Moore originally represented District 14 from 1949 to 1953 and then revised District 11 from 1953 to 1967. In 1957, Moore was the Senate President Pro Tempore in the 55th legislative session. After thirty-two years in the Senate, Moore was unseated in the 1980 party primary by former Bryan City Judge Kent Caperton, who was born the year that Moore entered the upper chamber of the state legislature. Caperton received 52.6 percent of the ballots cast. Though he was dubbed by the media as the \"Bull of the Brazos,\" a reference to the intrastate Brazos River to the west of Bryan, Moore is also remembered as the lawmaker who pushed most forcefully for the physical expansion of the campus and the admission of women to his alma mater, Texas A&M University in College Station."

As an ethnic Uyghur, he was born in Beijing on February 17, 1968 with ancestral roots in Ili Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture, Xinjiang. He achieved prominence while studying at Beijing Normal University as a hunger striker who rebuked Chinese Premier Li Peng on national television. He was one of the main leaders of the pro-reform Beijing Students' Autonomous Federation, and helped lead abortive negotiations with Chinese officials. He now resides in Taiwan, where he works as a political commentator. His attempts to turn himself in to Chinese authorities have made him one of the most visible dissidents in recent years. He has run for office in Taiwan's Legislative Yuan twice."

Shelly's bakery was known for its \"Four-X bread\". During the 1920s, he helped create a conglomerate known as Canadian Bakeries Ltd. to which he sold his business. Shelly became vice-president and general manager of the new company. He was also president of the Home Oil Co. Ltd., Canada Grain Export Co. Ltd., Guaranty Savings and Loan, Crescent Beach Development Co. Ltd., Grouse Mountain Highway and Scenic Resort Ltd. and the Shelly Building. Shelly served as finance minister in the provincial cabinet. In the fiscal year 1929/1930, the province suffered a fairly small deficit of $135,000. Shelly projected an increase of government revenues and a small surplus for the following fiscal year; instead, revenues decreased and expenditures were larger than projected, resulting in a then-record deficit of $4.8 million. Shelly was transferred to the position of president of the Executive Council in October 1930. He also suffered a large personal financial loss when share prices for Home Oil Co. Ltd. bottomed out in the years following the stock market crash. He retired from politics in 1933. Shelly died in Vancouver at the age of 72."

He assumed the surname Massey-Mainwaring on marriage. Massey-Mainwaring was a well-known art collector who lent items from his collection to public galleries around the country. He was involved in Conservative politics and in 1892 put his name forward as a candidate for the Hackney Central constituency. Eventually he stood aside in favour of Sir Andrew Scoble. In 1895 he was elected as member of parliament for Finsbury Central, holding the seat until 1906. He died suddenly from influenza and diabetes at his London home in March 1907, aged 61."

  "text" : "Mann was the son of Rudolf Mann, a shipping agent who later became a board member at IG Farben and Bayer, and his wife Selma Herrenbrück. Mann initially received a commercial education in Cologne and served a three-year apprenticeship at an Elberfeld steelworks before serving with the German Imperial Army in the First World War. Following his military service he studied political economy for a time before entering the sales department at Hoechst, rising quickly through the ranks at the company. In 1926 he went to Leverkusen to being training to ultimately succeed his father at the IG Farben pharmaceuticals and pesticides department and also took a post on the supervisory board of Degesch. He became a director in 1928 and alternate member of the managing board in 1931, gaining full board membership in 1934. Although his progress has been endorsed by his father Mann had also garnered a reputation for his strong knowledge of the international pharmaceutical market as well as his ability to negotiate good deals for IG Farben."

Little is known of his earliest days in Australia, but he arrived in Mackay in 1874 as assistant to Robert Jonathan Jeffray of Wm. Sloan and Co., a Melbourne merchant house. In 1876, he took over the store of sugar grower Arthur Kemmis and expanded the business as merchant and shipping agent, with close links to the Australasian United Steam Navigation Company. A notable employee from 1881 was James Croker (23 April 1851 – 27 April 1927), who later formed his own business shipping virtually all of the sugar from Mackay. Around 1885, E. V. Reid joined as partner of Paxton & Co. They opened offices in Brisbane and Sydney. Their business flourished until being taken over by McIlwraith & McEachran, which later merged with Adelaide Steamship Company. The imposing company warehouse still exists on the waterfront and is a tourist drawcard."

From 1959 to 1961 he was research assistant at the Radiobiology Institute in Neuherberg, later in the Zoological Institute of the University of Munich. His research interests during this time gave rise to questions that later led to the foundation of the field of bionics in Germany. In 1967 he was a visiting professor at the University of California, Berkeley. In 1969 he was appointed professor and director of the Zoological Institute of Saarland University. In 1990 he initiated the field of study called \"Technical Biology and Biomimetics\" (which he supervised until his retirement in 2002) and also the \"Society for Technical Biology and Bionics\" (GTBB) of which he was the first chairman until 2003. After his retirement in 2002 he became head of the BMBF-funded Competence Network Biomimetics BIOKON at the University of Saarland."

  "text" : "The Reverend Walter Whiter (30 October 1758 in Birmingham, England– 23 July 1832 in Hardingham) was an English philologist and literary critic. He is known for his 1794 work A Specimen of a Commentary on Shakspeare. Specimen, which explored As You Like It in terms of John Locke's philosophy of associationism, is believed to have been the first work of literary criticism to use scientific psychology. In addition to his literary criticism, Whiter published his etymological research, first as Etymologicon Magnum in 1800, then as Etymologicon Universale in 1822 (vol. 1 and 2) and 1825 (vol. 3); August Baron Merian, a correspondent of Samuel Butler, stated that he \"pit(ied)\" Whiter, and described him as \"(a) great etymologist—perhaps the greatest that ever lived. A genius certainly; but it seems, like most eminentartists, dissolute.\" Whiter's linguistic studies—in particular, his research into the language used by Gypsies—led him to be cited as a role model by George Borrow, to the extent that Whiter appears in Borrow's Lavengro as \"Reverend Whiter the philologist\". The book includes a song about his character, which goes as follows: Give me the haunch of a buck to eatAnd to drink Madeira old;And a gentle wife to rest with,And in my arms to fold.An Arabic book to study,A Norfolk cob to ride;And a house to live in shaded by trees,Near to a river's side.With such good things around me,And with good health withal,Though I should live for a hundred yearsFor death I would not call. For several decades, Whiter's notes on the vocabulary of Romani were thought to have been lost, but were rediscovered and published in 1909 as Whiter's 'Lingua Cingariana'."

He authored several books which include the topics of waves, geology, archaeology, poetry and oceanography. In his book \"Deep water, Ancient Ships\" he first proposed the hypothesis that anoxic water in the Black Sea would preserve ancient Black Sea shipwrecks. He led the first test drillings for Project Mohole, and was project director from 1960-1962. Bascom was a consultant to the Advisory Committee on Government Organization.

  "text" : "Sir Wylie McKissock, OBE (27 October 1906 – 3 May 1994) was a British neurosurgeon. He set up the neurosurgical unit at the Atkinson Morley Hospital, was Britain's most prolific leucotomist (lobotomist), and president of the Society of British Neurological Surgeons. McKissock was born in Staines, Surrey. His parents were Alexander Cathie McKissock and Rae Wylie. His father, originally from Lanarkshire, was a manager in a linoleum factory who wrote crime fiction under the name of Alan Graham and invented a machine for cutting sheets of material. McKissock went to the City of London School and studied medicine at King's College London and St George's Hospital Medical School in London, qualifying in 1930. His first positions were at St George's Hospital, Maida Vale Hospital for Nervous Diseases (where he began his neurosurgical career) and Great Ormond Street Hospital. In 1936 McKissock visited Stockholm to study Swedish neurosurgeon Herbert Olivecrona's work, and then spent a year (1937-1938) on a Rockefeller Foundation Fellowship in the United States and Canada. By this time he had a young family, having married Rachael Jones in 1934. The couple had two daughters and a son. In 1939, at the outbreak of World War II, McKissock tried unsuccessfully to join the army as a neurosurgeon and instead was appointed to the neurosurgical unit at Leavesden Hospital. The unit later moved to the Atkinson Morley Hospital, Wimbledon, London, and for a time in 1944 was evacuated to Bath, Somerset. McKissock was appointed an OBE in 1946 for his neurosurgical work on casualties with brain injuries during the war. He became a consultant at St George's Hospital and was also given an appointment at the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery in Queen Square, London, the neurology unit of University College Hospital. Thus at the Atkinson Morley Hospital, which he was to run until his retirement in 1971, he operated on patients from St George's Hospital, Maida Vale Hospital, Great Ormond Street, Queen Square and University College Hospital, as well as accepting referrals from other hospitals. While at the Atkinson Morley Hospital, McKissock developed an extensive practice of psychosurgery, travelling to psychiatric hospitals all over the south of England, Wales and the Midlands. In the 1940s he favoured the standard Freeman-Watts leucotomy where holes were drilled in the side of the head and an instrument swept through the white matter to sever connections between the frontal lobes and the deeper structures in the brain. Here he describes the Freeman-Watts leucotomy and the speed at which he operated: \"This is not a time-consuming operation. A competent team in a well-organised mental hospital can do four such operations in 2-2½ hours. The actual bilateral prefrontal leucotomy can be done by a properly trained neurosurgeon in six minutes and seldom take more than ten minutes.\" In 1948, in an attempt to reduce the risks and damaging effects of leucotomy, he developed a technique of his own, the rostral leucotomy, where the frontal lobes were approached from the top of the head. He still used the standard Freeman-Watts technique on some patients. By the late 1950s he had performed about 3,000 leucotomies. In 1966 McKissock became president of the Society of British Neurological Surgeons. He was awarded a knighthood on his retirement in 1971, after which he went to live in Scotland."

  "text" : "Wesley Alan Meredith (born December 22, 1963) is a Republican third term Senator of the North Carolina General Assembly representing the state's nineteenth Senatorial district. The 19th district is made up of Cumberland County. Meredith was born in Tupelo, Mississippi, and moved to Fort Bragg, North Carolina, where he served in the 307th Engineer Battalion of the 82 Airborne Division. He left the military after nearly three years of service with an Honorable Discharge rank of Sergeant having received the Army Service Ribbon, the Army Achievement Medal with 2 Oak Leaf Clusters, and the NCO Professional Development Ribbon. After his service in the military, Wesley Meredith chose to stay in Fayetteville and make North Carolina his home. He put his years of experience doing the neighbors’ lawns to the test, and officially opened his own business, Cardinal Landscaping. With a red pick up truck and some basic lawn equipment, that business has grown into what it is today. Prior to becoming a state senator in 2011, Meredith served on the Fayetteville City Council for three terms spanning from 2005 to 2010. From 2007 to 2009, Meredith held the position of Mayor Pro Tempore. Meredith is on the following Senate standing committees: Appropriations on Department of Transportation, Commerce (co-chair), Workforce and Economic Development, Insurance (co-chair), Transportation and Rules and Operations of the Senate. Meredith also serves as a member of the Joint Legislative Governmental Operations committee and an advisory member of the Revenue Laws Study committee."

  "text" : "William Eddrup Adcock (31 December 1846 – 18 May 1931) was an Australian journalist and businessman. Adcock was born in London to cigar manufacturer George Charles Adcock and Mary, née Goodwin. The family moved to Melbourne, Australia in 1848, where George became a bookseller in Richmond. By 1865, William was a shopkeeper at Gaffney's Creek. On 30 December 1865, he married Emma Sharples, and in 1871, he was appointed editor of the Richmond Free Press. In 1872, he and his family moved to Palmerston (later Darwin) in the Northern Territory, where Adcock ran a general store. In 1874, he stood, unsuccessfully, for election as a councillor for Palmerston, and after his wife's health became an issue in 1878, he returned to Melbourne. Following his successors' failure, Adcock returned to the territory in partnership with his brother and V. V. Brown. He opened new branches in Palmerston and Derby, and extended his business to include steamship agencies and the local Victoria Hotel, although Adcock himself remained based in Melbourne. In 1885, he returned to the territory to deal with financial difficulties brought on by the failure of the South Australian Town and Country Bank, which led to his being declared insolvent in February 1888. Adcock's appeal, reversed by the Supreme Court of South Australia, but twice reinstated, was ultimately refused in December in a proceeding unique in South Australian legal history. Adcock went to Adelaide on his solicitor's advice and was arrested on 20 December and sent to prison, where he and his counsel, Josiah Symon, continued his dispute with the insolvency court. Adcock spent four years in prison and was ultimately discharged in November 1893, but his assets were liable to be seized if he ever returned to South Australia. Adcock returned to Victoria and journalism before travelling to Coolgardie, Western Australia, in 1900, where he established mining interests. In 1912, he published a compilation of anonymous articles he had attributed to the Australian Journal on the gold rushes in the 1890s, titled The Gold Rush of the Fifties. He was appointed editor of the journal around 1910, and continued in the position until 1926. He died at his home in Kew in 1926, survived by his second wife, Annie Mary Bowcott, whom he had married on 25 April 1898."

Educated at Eythorne, he migrated to Australia in 1884 and established himself as an architect in Townsville, where he would eventually establish the civil engineering, architecture and surveying firm Tunbridge & Tunbridge. In February 1889 he was commissioned in the Mounted Infantry of the Queensland Land Forces, and in December was promoted lieutenant. He and his unit were sent to keep order at the 1891 shearers' strike, and in June 1892 Tunbridge was promoted captain. In November 1898 he was promoted major and transferred to the Queensland Artillery Garrison Battery, serving in South Africa from 1900 and commanding the 3rd Mounted Infantry Contingent. He saw action at Elands River and Rhenoster Kop. He served with distinction and was mentioned in despatches, appointed Companion of the Order of the Bath, awarded the Queen's South Africa Medal with five clasps and promoted brevet lieutenant-colonel. He returned to Australia in 1902 and served as aide-de-camp to the Governor-General. On 7 April 1904 Tunbridge married Leila Emily Brown in Brisbane, and later extended his firm to include a Melbourne branch, where he based himself until 1914. Appointed censor for the 3rd Military District in August 1914, he was swiftly promoted to deputy chief censor and before the month was out returned to the military as a lieutenant-colonel in the Australian Imperial Force. Given command of the 1st Australian Division Ammunition Park (Mechanical Transport), Tunbridge and his units arrived in England in February 1915, where they were incorporated into the British Army as the 300th and 301st Mechanical Transport Companies and sent to France in July. Influential in various reorganisations of the mechanical transport units, Tunbridge was appointed to command the 1 Anzac Corps Ammunition Park on 25 April 1916 and following a reorganisation in January 1917 became senior mechanical operator of the 1 Anzac Corps. During the Third Battle of Ypres his responsibilities covered the entire AIF contingent in France. In June 1918 Tunbridge was promoted colonel; he retired in January 1920 and was formally retired from the AIF in June. He had been mentioned in despatches five times during the war and was appointed Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George in 1917, Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1919 and brevet colonel of the Australian Military Forces. He returned to architecture until his retirement in the 1930s. Tunbridge died at Hawthorn in 1943 and was survived by his wife and three children."

  "text" : "Winstone Zulu (January 7, 1964 – October 12, 2011) was a Zambian HIV and tuberculosis activist. Zulu, who became the first Zambian to publicly acknowledge his HIV status in 1990, was considered one of the world's leading HIV and AIDS activists. At the time, people diagnosed with HIV/AIDS faced widespread discrimination in Zambia. Zulu was born in Lusaka, Zambia, in 1964. He was the sixth of his parents' thirteen children. In 1990, Zulu made headlines by becoming the first person to announce his HIV status in the country. He became one of the first Africans to become involved in the AIDS crisis on a worldwide level. Zulu was further diagnosed with tuberculosis in 1997. Zulu lost four of his brothers to tuberculosis during his lifetime due to little access to anti-TB drugs, widely available in other countries. The deaths of his brothers and his own diagnosis led Zulu to focus his advocacy on behalf of tuberculosis patients and efforts to curb the disease. He explained in the late 1990s, \"TB treatment gives patients more time. If my brothers had survived TB they might have lived long enough to access HIV drugs like me. They shouldn’t have died.\" Zulu noted the link between HIV/AIDS status of patients and a diagnosis with tuberculosis. From 1997 to 2011, Zulu called for increased financial investments to fight the spread of tuberculosis, as well as TB cases directly related to HIV and AIDS. Former South African President Nelson Mandela spoke of Zulu saying, \"There have been so few TB survivors who have stepped forward to share their stories. We need more advocates like Winstone to tell the world about TB and the effect it has on so many millions of people.\" Zulu was taken to University Teaching Hospital (UTH) in Lusaka on October 11, 2011. He died from complications of AIDS at the hospital during the early morning hours of October 12, 2011."

Collins was probably the son of John Collins of King's Norton, who was fined £10 for not taking knighthood on 4 March 1631. In the Civil War, Collins became a captain in the Parliamentary army. On 11 May 1644, he was added to the Committee for Worcestershire by the House of Commons. He became a sub-commissioner of the Grand Excise for Worcestershire on 25 February 1650. On 7 October 1651 the Committee for Compounding made an order that he be a commissioner for Worcestershire after a request on 1 October by Nicholas Lechmere that Capt Wm. Collins may be added to the Committee while Col. John James was not attending. On 14 March 1654 he was made sole sub-commissioner for Worcestershire. In 1654, Collins was elected Member of Parliament for Worcester in the First Protectorate Parliament. He was an Assessment Commissioner for county and city of Worcester in 1656. In 1656 he was re-elected MP for Worcester in the Second Protectorate Parliament. He was re-elected MP for Worcester in 1659 for the Third Protectorate Parliament. He was Governor of Worcester on 9 July 1659 when the Council of State ordered him to assemble his troops in response to Sir George Booth's rising. On 4 January 1660 Capt. Collins wrote from Worcester College to the Army Commissioners \"I have given order for the speedy drawing of my troop together for their march according to your directions, but their necessities for want of pay are very great, having been on hard duty for eight weeks, to preserve the peace of this country, which was much disturbed by highway robbers, being considerable parties, and supposed to be of the old enemy, they riding in the posture of soldiers ; for this time they have had no money but what I have borrowed, and lent them, besides three years arrears formerly due to them. I shall according to your orders, as soon as I possibly provide to march, give notice thereof to Col. Hacker.\""

  "text" : "William Catton Grasby (2 October 1859 – 26 October 1930) was an Australian agricultural journalist and educationist. Grasby was born at Balhannah in South Australia to Yorkshire-born farmer William Grasby and Frances, née Catton. He was educated at home, and from the age of thirteen was a pupil-teacher. He travelled to Europe in 1881 and returned to Australia to teach in primary schools, founding the Payneham Boys' Field Club in 1887 and advocating reform in educational policies in South Australia. In 1891 he published Teaching in Three Continents, the result of two years' study of education in North America, Great Britain and Europe. He summarised his proposals in Our Public Schools, a polemic that advocated kindergartens, practical education, abolition of school fees, results-based wages for teachers and extended educational training. He edited the Educator (1893–94) for the duration of its publication. In 1892 he was appointed director of agronomy and manual training at Way College in Unley. From 1894 he taught at Roseworthy Agricultural College and was a member of the Central Bureau of Agriculture. He married Tasmanian Quaker Hannah Propsting on 13 October 1896. In 1897 he returned to teach at Way College and continued his involvement in agricultural circles. He established the journal Australian Garden and Field in 1896, which he edited until 1904. In 1887 and 1890 he had contested elections for the South Australian Parliament; in 1903 he stood for the Senate as an independent without success. In 1904 Grasby moved to Western Australia, being appointed agricultural editor of the Western Mail and the West Australian and writing highly popular weekly columns. He continued to teach agriculture, holding classes at Perth Technical School and Guildford Grammar School. His 1912 publication Principles of Australian Agriculture was an important textbook, and his strong support for tertiary education for Western Australia led to his appointment to the University of Western Australia's first senate in 1912. In 1911 he was involved in founding the Kindergarten Union. He and Charles Harper together developed the first wheat varieties to be grown exclusively in Western Australia. An early conservationist, he decried the hunting of animals for scientific collections. He retired from public life in 1928 and died at East Guildford in 1930 of diabetes and gangrene."

He succeeded to the estates of Madresfield and elsewhere on the death of his father in 1584 but was required to sell off or mortgage much property over the years. In 1589, he was elected Member of Parliament for Worcestershire. In 1594, he had to sell the manor of Warndon, probably to pay for the rebuilding of the manor house at Madresfield. He was J.P. for Worcestershire from about 1591 and High Sheriff of Worcestershire from 1592 to 1593. He was Deputy Lieutenant and was commissioner for musters from 1595. In November 1599 in an improved financial situation, he bought the manor of Pixham, Worcestershire but in 1602 had to sell other property in the manor of Acton Beauchamp. He was knighted in 1603. In 1604 he was elected MP for Worcestershire again and sat until his death. Lygon died at the age of about 60. Lygon married Elizabeth Harwell, daughter of Edward Harwell of Besford, in around 1590 and had three sons and two daughters. His son William, who inherited the encumbered estates, had to sell off more of them."

He painted landscapes which display the effects of light and colour on the landscape, often working out of doors. As well as painting the area close to his home in the West of England, he also produced numerous views of Polperro in Cornwall, which he and his wife visited regularly. In his 50s he developed Parkinson's disease, which hampered his ability to paint and he died in 1949."

  "text" : "William Dalton (1821–1875) was a Victorian-era British author of adventure stories for youth set in exotic locations such as China, Japan and Peru. He wrote most of his books during a seven-year period between about 1857 to 1864. He was also chief Editor of the London Daily Telegraph for some time. Dalton was the first among many authors to novelize the true story of William Adams, who was the first Englishman to reach Japan in the 17th century. His \"romantic biography\" is called Will Adams, the First Englishman in Japan (1861). It is not an accurate history - Dalton never went to Japan, he relied on old sources and fictionalized the story - but it is an accurate reflection of 19th century British stereotypes of Japan and Asia. Later authors would also novelize the Adams story, the best known is James Clavell's Shōgun (1975) and subsequent 1980 film."

  "text" : "William Dubilier (July 25, 1888 – July 25, 1969) was an American inventor in the field of radio and electronics. He demonstrated radio communication at Seattle's Alaska-Yukon-Pacific Exposition on June 21, 1909; ten years before the first commercial station operated. A graduate of Cooper Union, he was the first to use sheets of naturally occurring mica as the dielectric in a capacitor. Mica capacitors were widely used in early radio oscillator and tuning circuits because the temperature coefficient of expansion of mica was low, resulting in very stable capacitance – mica capacitors are still used where exceptional temperature stability is needed. He founded the Dubilier Condenser Company in New York in 1920."

  "text" : "William Ellsworth Fisher (1871 – 1937) was an architect who founded the Denver, Colorado firm that became Fisher & Fisher. Fisher's father, Allen S. Fisher, moved to Denver from Clinton, Ontario, Canada, with his family in 1885. William became a draftsman for Balcomb & Rice in Denver in 1890 and then studied briefly with C. Powell Karr in New York. In 1892 he went into business in Denver as William Fisher, Architect. After ten years in solo practise, mainly designing starter homes, he partnered from 1901 to 1905 with Daniel Riggs Huntington, who had also worked for Balcomb & Rice. During this time the firm designed increasingly expensive residences and also commercial buildings. After returning to solo practice for a couple of years, he then partnered with his younger brother Arthur Addison Fisher from 1907 until his death in 1937. His son Alan B. Fisher also worked for the firm and became a partner after William's death. The Fisher firm was extremely prestigious and has left a unique legacy in Colorado; 50 of 67 remaining buildings in Denver are either eligible for listing by the National Register of Historic Places or are listed either individually or as part of historic districts. Most of these, including residences, schools, churches, hospitals and commercial buildings, are from the period when William Fisher was in partnership with his brother. One assessment of the brothers' work is that because of their unusual originality and creativity, \"Their contribution to Denver's early stylistic independence is enormous.\" In 1908–09, Fisher was one of ten architects invited by The Delineator magazine to participate in a competition to design a $3,000 country house; however, he did not place. In the 1920s, Fisher was head of the Mountain Bureau of the Architects' Small House Service, which created standardized plans for cheap one- to three-bedroom houses to reduce costs for middle-class families. In the mid-1920s, he and his brother planned the oil company town of Parco, Wyoming (now Sinclair) and designed many buildings there, in a uniform Spanish Colonial style intended to encourage community spirit. The original town (Parco Historic District) centering on the plaza and Parco Inn (formerly Parco Hotel and Sinclair Hotel) is now on the National Register of Historic Places."

He attended the Free School in Dorchester between 1606 and 1615 under Robert Cheeke and became a merchant of Dorchester. He made his first journey to France in 1616. In 1621 he became a Freeman of Dorchester.1621. He became a lieutenant in the militia and an assistant to the governor of freemen in 1622. In 1624 he became governor and a capital burgess. In 1626, Whiteway was elected Member of Parliament for Dorchester on the death of the sitting member Michael Humphreys. He became a steward of the hospital in 1626 and overseer of the poor for Holy Trinity parish in 1628. In 1629 he became bailiff and in 1630 he was town steward. Under the new Charter for Dorchester issued by Charles I on 22 December 1630 he was listed as Capital burgess and first alderman. He was feoffee of All Saints church and bailiff again in 1633. Whiteway kept diaries from about 1619 which recorded all major events of the town and family events. He displayed a wide range of interests and was knowledgeable about astronomy, geology, art and architecture. His library included books on logic medicine and mathematics. He was interested in history and was planning to write a history of England. He was a puritan and so interested in the religious controversies of the time. For business reasons he also took an interest in foreign affairs. Whiteway died at the age of about 35. Whiteway was married to Elinor Parkins, daughter of John Parkins merchant of Dorchester, at Holy Trinity church by Rev. John White in 1620."

  "text" : "William Manning (1747–1814) was a New England farmer, foot soldier and author. After fighting in the American Revolutionary War, he began to believe that his service and labor meant little to those in charge. He soon became a member of the Jeffersonian Republican Party (otherwise known as the Democratic-Republican Party) in response to the day’s ruling Federalist Party. As the years passed and his distrust in government grew, he wrote multiple papers on what he deemed was the corruptness of the “Few” and what the “Many” endured because of it. In 1798, Manning wrote his most famous work, The Key of Libberty (later corrected to The Key of Liberty), in which he wrote that the goal of the Few was to distress and force the Many into financially depending on them, creating a continued cycle of dependence. He continued that the Many’s only hope was to vote for leaders that would fight for those with lesser power and urge for smaller government. His work, however, would not be published for more than a century, mostly due to its controversial content."

With Die Mädels vom Immenhof 1955 he managed an extraordinary success, which laid down his work but also for years on the production of such substances.

  "text" : "William \"Bill\" G. Otis (born July 27, 1946) is a law professor and former federal prosecutor who served as Special Counsel to President George H. W. Bush. A graduate of the University of North Carolina (1968) and Stanford Law School (1974), Otis is currently an adjunct professor at Georgetown University Law Center. He also contributes to the legal blog Crime and Consequences. In 2007, Otis wrote an op-ed in the Washington Post urging President George W. Bush to commute the prison sentence imposed on Scooter Libby, who had been sentenced to 30 months in prison, a $250,000 fine, and two years of probation for his role in the aftermath of the Valerie Plame affair. Approximately one month after Otis's piece appeared, Bush commuted Libby's prison sentence, while leaving the rest of the sentence intact. Otis spent much of his career as head of the Appellate Division of the United States Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Virginia. For ten years, he was a member of the Attorney General's Advisory Subcommittee on the Sentencing Guidelines. In 1992, during the investigation into \"Iraqgate,\" he served as Special Counsel for President George H. W. Bush. He returned to the U.S. Attorney's Office the next year, and ended his tenure there in 1999. He returned to federal service three years later as Special Assistant to the Secretary of Energy. In 2003, he was appointed Counselor to the head of the Drug Enforcement Administration, where he remained until 2007. Otis has appeared before both houses of the United States Congress as an expert witness on diverse subjects in criminal law including the death penalty, illegal drugs, and the United States Sentencing Commission. He has been interviewed on these and other subjects by The New York Times, The Atlantic magazine, CBS's 60 Minutes, The O'Reilly Factor, ABC News, and MSNBC. He has written op-ed pieces for various newspapers on topics including legal ethics, Miranda warnings, and the firing of U.S. Attorneys by then-Attorney General Alberto Gonzales. A survivor of liver cancer thanks to a liver transplant, Otis is married to Lee Liberman Otis, a co-founder and officer of the Federalist Society."

  "text" : "William Howe Crane (1854–1926) was an American lawyer. Born to Reverend Jonathan Townley Crane and Mary Helen Peck Crane, he was the third-oldest of eight surviving children. In 1880 he graduated from Albany Law School, after which he established a practice in Port Jervis, New York. Crane was a prominent member of the community; he served as district clerk of the board of education and treasurer of the town's waterworks. One year he served as special judge for Orange County, which earned him the nickname \"Judge\" Crane. He was also the author of one book, A Scientific Currency (1910). His youngest brother was the author Stephen Crane (1871–1900), who was a frequent visitor to his home in Port Jervis. Stephen based his Sullivan County stories and sketches on his older brother's nearby hunting and fishing preserve, the Hartwood Club, which he visited often. In 1892, William was witness to the lynching of African American Robert Lewis in Port Jervis; he was one of the few men who attempted to intervene. He gave testimony at the resulting inquest, during which he recounted his vain attempts to free Lewis from the noose. Stephen Crane's 1898 novella The Monster, takes place in a fictional counterpart to Port Jervis, and has similarities to Lewis' lynching. William regularly sent his younger brother funds while Stephen was living in England during the last few years of his life, and after the author's death at the age of 28, William became the executor of his will. He later retired to California. His Port Jervis home on East Main Street—now known as the William Howe Crane Homestead—is the home of a local law firm."

When he arrived, he helped establish citrus groves with his family along with establishing a phosphate mine and working in local government with his brother, Charles. He married Luella Pugh in 1895 and moved to Tallahassee, Florida, in 1897, taking up the position of the first \"financial agent\" of the state government. His title was later, in 1901, changed to \"State Auditor\". He was appointed as state treasurer for the first time in 1903 and to comptroller in 1912 when the incumbent, A. C. Croom, died. He ran unsuccessfully for governor in 1917, defeated by Sidney Johnston Catts and returned to farming and business until he was appointed director of a local hospital in 1921. He was appointed to his former position as auditor general in 1927 but, in the following year, John Christian Luning, the incumbent state treasurer, died and Knott was re-appointed to that position, serving until his retirement at age 78 in 1941. He is the longest served state treasurer in the state's history, serving under 11 governors. He died at the age of 101 after collapsing at his home in 1965 and his body lay in state at the Florida State Capitol to allow the public to pay their respects. Luella Knott died eight days following William's death at the age of 93."

He was considered one of the most skilled dentists in New England and the United States. In 1896, Colgate & Company began selling its own toothpaste that mimicked Dr. Sheffield's ready-made toothpaste and sold it in collapsible tubes like Dr. Sheffield.

Born at Beaconsfield in 1820, Charsley was a boy at Uppingham School, from where he matriculated at Christ Church, Oxford. He migrated to St Mary Hall after being blinded in an accident, and from there he graduated, to become a well-regarded tutor. He founded Charsley's Hall, a new Permanent Private Hall at Oxford in 1856 and was the licensed Master of it until 1891, when he was succeeded by Charles Abdy Marcon. The History of the University of Oxford states that One small establishment, however, filled a niche in the market by receiving idle or incapable students removed from the colleges. For nearly thirty years W. H. Charsley presided over a hall in Parks Road whose members, though few in number, were distinguished for their athletic prowess. Charsley died at Great Malvern on 2 November 1900. The Oxford Magazine noted that he had been well known in the University. In R. W. Hiley's Memories of Half a Century (1899), Charsley is described as \"honoured, respected and beloved by all... a fine man in person, of superior mind, a good scholar\"."

  "text" : "William Alfred Cocks (1892-1971) was a master clock maker from Ryton, near Newcastle upon Tyne. He had a lifelong interest in the history and culture of the North-east of England, and particularly in the Northumbrian smallpipes and half-long pipes. He assembled a large collection of historic bagpipes, their music, and related materials, which forms the core of the collection now housed at the Morpeth Chantry Bagpipe Museum. He was elected to the Society of Antiquaries of Newcastle upon Tyne in 1920, remaining a member until his death. In 1928, he was one of the earliest members of the Northumbrian Pipers' Society, being elected one of the technical advisers, with responsibility for smallpipes. He became a Vice-President of the Society in 1938. When an exhibition of historic pipes was held in the Black Gate Museum in 1961, most of the exhibits were from Cocks's collection. He was a pipemaker, as well as author about the pipes: his Tutor For The Northumberland Half Long Pipes was published by the Oxford University Press in 1925, The Northumbrian Bagpipes; their development and makers was published by the Northumbrian Pipers' Society in 1933, and late in his life, together with J.F. Bryan, he wrote a detailed book of instructions for pipemaking The Northumbrian Bagpipes, which was published by the Northumbrian Pipers' Society in 1967. The latter book, in particular, played a large part in promoting the revival of pipemaking. Because of its importance, containing detailed plans based on historical examples, the Society has put this book online at. He corresponded widely about the pipes, in particular with the organologist Anthony Baines  about historic instruments, and with the piper Tom Clough  on playing style. On his death, the bagpipe collection, books, music manuscripts and photographs were left to the Society of Antiquaries; they were at first housed in the Black Gate Museum, but moved to the Morpeth Chantry Bagpipe Museum in 1987. Records of this collection have now been digitised, and images of many items can be viewed at. The collection is a major resource for the study of Northumbrian pipes, their music and history."

He was awarded the Ten Outstanding Young Persons Award (Hong Kong) in 2012  and elected an Associate of the Royal Academy of Music in 2015  in recognition of his achievements in the performing arts and contribution to the community. At the age of six, he made his début with the Hong Kong Philharmonic Orchestra. Following his Macau début with the Macau Chamber Orchestra at the age of ten, the South China Morning Post wrote, “Warren Lee’s performance bore out the insight… that exceptional artists are not so much people to be praised as phenomena to be treasured, bearers of a power altogether greater than the poor vessels that contain it.” He went on to become the first prize winner of the 1995 Stravinsky Awards International Piano Competition and the Grand Prix Ivo Pogorelich. In 2000, he graduated from the Royal Academy of Music and Yale School of Music with the highest of honors. As a music educator, he released in 2008 his educational CD album, “From Bach To Gershwin: A Musical Journey”  (Universal Music Hong Kong 480102-0). The Audio Land Magazine calls it a \"rare successful album that Hong Kong can be proud of.\" He has also been appointed a Guest Professor  by the Central Conservatory of Music EOS Orchestra Academy and an Honorary Artist-in-Residence by the Hong Kong Institute of Education.

Warren Lee also holds a MBA degree from the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology and is elected to the Beta Gamma Sigma. As a renowned pianist, Warren was hailed by critics as a pianist: \"With technique to burn, an extraordinary intellect, and a Horowitzian colour of romanticism, he left us all quite stunned.\"— Roger Shields, Founder of the Stravinsky Awards International Piano Competition“[With] superb pianism… wonderful sense of colour and… impeccably controlled articulation… Not for nothing have the piano makers Steinway enlisted Lee as one of their signature artists…”— Marc Rochester, Strait Times Singapore, September 12, 2011"

It's larger than Houston. This country used to think on a very different level. The two World's Fairs generated each time over 50 million visitors. We used to think on a global level. We used to compete on a global level. We need to get back on that mold.\" Originally appointed by Governor George Pataki as a board member of the City University of New York, Chen also engaged in discussions by CUNY leaders on their immigrant pasts on CUNY's A Nation of Immigrants Curriculum with notable speakers as Cuba Eduardi Marti, Jamaica Marcia Keizs and Hugo Morales.

Wellington was also the first Asian American to serve as a Commissioner on the New York City Board of Standards and Appeals. Mr. Chen co-founded Tri Plus Construction Corporation in 1989, a company dedicated to creating affordable housing in New York City. Chen's programs as Executive Director of Chinatown Partnership is regarded was a major aspect of Chinatown's reforms and economic growth, and Chen was interviewed by NY1 in May 2009 regarding reflections on his personal and professional history.

He earned degrees in violin and theory from Alma College, University of Michigan, and the Eastman School of Music. His teachers included Roy Harris, Gardner Read, Bernard Rogers, Burrill Phillips, and Pierre Monteux. Presser performed both as violinist and violist in the San Francisco Symphony and Rochester Philharmonic, and he taught at six colleges. In addition to a long association with the Interlochen summer camp, he taught composition at University of Southern Mississippi in Hattiesburg from 1953 through 1981. Over 130 works by William Presser are in the catalogs of twenty publishers. His chamber works for winds and brass are staples of the repertoire, appearing on many contest lists and college recitals.

  "text" : "Sir William Herrick (1562 – 2 March 1653) was an English jeweller, courtier, diplomat and politician who sat in the House of Commons at various times between 1601 and 1622. Herrick was the son of John Heyrick of Leicester and was baptised on 9 December 1562. His father was an ironmonger at Leicester. He was sent to London in about 1574 to be apprenticed to his elder brother Nicholas Herrick, a goldsmith in Cheapside. After six years he set up a business on his own in Wood Street on premises leased from the Goldsmith’s Company. He also became a moneylender and in a few years he had made himself a fortune and was able to purchase Beau Manor Park from the Earl of Essex, and obtained a right to arms. He came to the notice of Queen Elizabeth, who sent him on a mission to the Ottoman Porte and on his return he was rewarded with a lucrative appointment in the Exchequer. He was made a freeman of Leicester in 1601 when he presented the corporation with a dozen silver spoons in lieu of a fee. In 1601, Herrick was elected Member of Parliament for Leicester. He became principal jeweller to the King, Queen and Prince of Wales in 1603 and held the post until 1625. He became a freeman of the City of London in May 1605 and was knighted in the same year. He served as MP for Leicester for part of the 1604–1611 parliament. He was prime warden of the Goldsmiths’ Company from 1605 to 1606. In 1607 he took as apprentice his nephew Robert the future poet. In 1621 he was elected MP for Leicester again. Herrick died at the age of about 90 and was buried at St Martin’s Church, Leicester. Herrick was the uncle, and later guardian, of the poet Robert Herrick and supported him financially during his time at Cambridge. Herrick married Joan May, daughter of Richard May of London and of Mayfield Place, Sussex on 6 May 1596, and had at least one son, Henry Herrick, born 1604. His brother Robert was also an MP."

  "text" : "William Snelling Hadaway (1872–1941) was an American artist who worked in Madras, India. He specialized in book illustration and in jewelry and metal design. He trained in Massachusetts in the 1890s \"at the Museum of Fine Arts, under C. Howard Walker and Miss Elizabeth Child.\" He belonged to the Boston Art Students' Association. After school \"he spent two years studying in Sicily and Italy.\" Beginning in 1907 he worked in India for the Madras School of Arts; he stayed until 1927. He developed an expertise in Indian visual arts and published several works on the subject. His papers reside in the Victoria and Albert Museum. Life William Snelling Hadaway was born in Malden, Massachusetts in 1872, son of Ephraim Locke Hadaway (1848–1914) and Helen Agnes Noyes Hadaway (1848–1935). He told his younger daughter that his first job was in a hardware shop where he \"learnt the flashpoints of oils\". In 1893, aged 21, he married Julia Peck (1864–1937), and applied on 30 December 1893 in New York for a passport for himself and wife. They left for Italy on 4 January 1894. On 22 December 1894 he applied for anemergency passport in the US Embassy in Rome, in joint names, saying he was temporarily residing in Naples. He then returned to the US on this passport, without Julia, on 26 June 1895. Julia is listed as returning to New York on 2 September 1895 aboard the \"Werra\" from Verona. They divorced shortly afterwards. Julia subsequently pursued a career as an artist under the name Julia Peck Hadaway. She is listed in the 1910 Census as living in Suffolk, Mass., divorced, aged 46. She specialised in Italian and local scenes; a Venetian canal scene (oil on canvas, 20 ½ x 11 ½ ) was for sale in 1992 in the Barridoff Galleries, Portland, Maine. She died suddenly, in Italy, in 1937. On his return William enrolled in art school in New York where he met Jean Louise Carré (1865–1939), who had arrived in New York from Nova Scotia in September 1894 describing herself as a \"tourist\". She was French Canadian, her father had originally come from Guernsey, her mother had died in childbirth (hers) and her father 2 ½ years later. She was brought up by an uncle and his family in Pictou, Nova Scotia, and had an uncle in Guernsey. They left the US together in October 1897, travelling to London as man and wife on the passport originally intended for Julia (fortunately the names were similar). They married 1904, in St Pancras, when their first two children (Jean Carré, known as Jack, 1898-c.1955, and Lesley Anne, 1899-1985) were aged 6 and 5. Their third child Hilary Stella Mary Snelling was born in 1905 and died in 1995. William forged a highly successful artistic career in London, working as a designer, silversmith and teacher. Jean was also a jeweller and drawer of fashion designs, and sometimes they worked together. They moved to Bushey in 1902 or 3 where William studied with Hubert von Herkomer. In 1907 William was offered the post of Superintendent of the Madras Government School of Arts, which he held to 1927. Under his regime the students made jewellery, furniture and other artefacts. William also wrote monographs on cotton printing in the Madras presidency and Indian metalwork, copies of which may be found in the Victoria and AlbertMuseum. An insight into his character is to be found in an anecdote told in The Hindu of May 6, 2009. Sculptor Mani Nagappa is talking about his father Rao Bahadur M.S. Nagappa's life. His father became William Hadaway's assistant atthe School after an unconventional job interview. As Mani Nagappa tells it: \"It was mid-term at the Madras School of Arts when my father MS Nagappa wanted to join the institution as a student. The watchman would not let him in. My father hung around and drew a picture of the watchman, when he was sound asleep. When the principal Hadaway was leaving in his car,my father threw the sheet in. The Britisher [sic] was impressed with the sketch and appointed my father his assistant\". When an unidentified epidemic involving swelling broke out in Madras in the early 1900s the British government asked Hadaway to commission a painting of a victim to assist with diagnosis. Hadaway gave Nagappa the job, and he did a painting based on a cast of a dead victim. The painting was apparently of use to the medical team back in London. They stayed in India until 1934, when they returned to the UK via New Zealand. They retired to Roquebrun on the French Riviera. Jeandied in 1939; William visited the USA that year for the first time in 42 years. He died in 1941, trapped in Vichy France by the war."

He possibly had a background in law. As some point before June 1389, Bettenham married his wife, Alice. There is little information on him, but he is commonly associated with Stephen Bettenham (d.1415) of Cranbrook, Kent, who may have been his brother or a close relation. Stephen was a successful lawyer and landowner, and obtained a place on the commission of the peace. William, however, is not thought to have been heavily involved in local politics or to have owned much land. He owned 130 acres of land in Staplehurst; this seems to have come to him through his marriage. The last record of Bettenham alive is from February 1400."

  "text" : "William Charles Braithwaite (1862 – 1922) was a British historian, specialising in the early history of the Society of Friends (Quakers). Braithwaite was the son of Joseph Bevan Braithwaite (1818-1905) and Martha Gillett (1823-1895). One of his eight siblings was stockbroker Joseph Bevan Braithwaite (1855-1934). He attended Oliver's Mount School, Scarborough, and University College London. Upon the death of John Wilhelm Rowntree in 1905, Rufus Jones invited Braithwaite to write the early history of the Society of Friends. Rowntree and Jones had set out in 1897 to write a \"comprehensive history of Quakerism\", but the former died before this was possible. As a result, it is Braithwaite who wrote the two classic histories which popularised this research; The Beginnings of Quakerism in 1912, and The Second Period of Quakerism in 1919. In 1955 F. J. Smithen stated that The Beginnings of Quakerism was \"still regarded as the standard work on the rise and early fortunes of the Quaker movement\". In 1909, Braithwaite gave the second Swarthmore Lecture, entitled \"Spiritual Guidance in the experience of the Society of Friends\". He married Janet Morland, and his son was the philosopher Richard Bevan Braithwaite."

  "text" : "Willis Kent (1878-1966) was an independent American film producer. Willis Kent Productions was active from 1928-1958. Its films, about 40 in all, consisted mostly of low-budget westerns, many of which starred short-lived cowboy star and former football player Lafayette Russell (aka Reb Russell), and cheap, sensationalist exploitation epics. The company's first release, The Pace That Kills (1928), was about innocent young teens being lured into the netherworld of cocaine addiction. Kent remade it, using the same title and same director, adapted with sound in 1935. In some markets it was retitled as Cocaine Fiends, which is the title used on most VHS and DVD copies of the film. For at least two releases in the mid-'30s Kent joined forces with Dorothy Davenport, who had forged her own career in early exploitation films following the death of her husband, the morphine-addicted star Wallace Reid. Most of these films are now in the public domain."

  "text" : "William McKendree Morgan (December 2, 1869 – October 16, 1942), was a lawyer and politician in Idaho and served for two separate periods on the Idaho Supreme Court. Born in Adams County, Illinois to John Milton Morgan and Mary (Gooding) Morgan, Morgan was educated in the country schools of Bourbon County, Kansas, later attending the Kansas Normal College at Fort Scott. In 1890, when twenty years of age, he set out to win a fortune in the far west. Making his way to Idaho, he located at Moscow in Latah County and secured employment on ranches in that vicinity. During the winter of 1890-91 he took up the study of law, and was admitted to the bar on October 9, 1894. In the interim, he became a deputy sheriff of Latah County, serving in that position from 1 January 1893, until 1895, when he began practice. He served as a Democrat in the state legislature from 1897 to 1899, and in 1897 was also appointed private secretary to Henry Heitfeld, United States senator, and continued in that position for five years or until 1902, spending most of the period in Washington, D.C. While there, he pursued a course in the law department of Georgetown University, receiving an LL.M. in 1899. Morgan's brother Albert was also an Idaho lawyer, and the brothers were law partners at various times. Although they were closely associated in their professional and social interests, they had opposite political views, Morgan being a Democrat and his brother being a staunch Republican. Morgan served as mayor of Moscow from 1906-1908, and returned to the state legislature from 1911 to 1913, serving as the minority leader in the House. In 1914 he was elected to the Idaho Supreme Court, and by natural rotation became Chief Justice on January 1, 1919. Morgan resigned from the Idaho Supreme Court in 1920, returning to private practice. However, he was returned to the Idaho Supreme Court in 1933 and served his death at age 72 in 1942."

  "text" : "William Newland Welsby (1802?–1864) was a legal writer who was born in Cheshire about 1802, was the only son of William Welsby of the Middle Temple, gentleman. He was admitted as a pensioner at St. John's College, Cambridge, on 28 October 1818, and graduated B.A. in 1823 and M.A. in 1827. On 22 April 1823 he was admitted as student at the Middle Temple, and was called to the bar on 10 November 1826. He went the North Wales and Chester circuit, and in 1841 was appointed recorder of that city. For many years he reported in the court of exchequer, and he was junior counsel to the treasury. He enjoyed the reputation of being an accomplished scholar and lawyer, but his exertions overtaxed his strength, and on 1 July 1864 he died at 19 Holland Villas Road, Kensington, aged 61. He was married, but had no children. Welsby edited, with Roger Meeson, seventeen volumes of \"Exchequer Reports\", beginning with 1837, and collaborated with E. T. Hurlstone and J. Gordon in nine subsequent volumes ranging from 1849. In conjunction with John Horatio Lloyd he published in three parts \"Reports of Mercantile Cases in the Courts of Common Law\" in 1829 and 1830, and he edited with Edward Beavan the second edition of Chitty's \"Collection of Statutes\" (1851–4, 4 vols.), superintending also the third edition, which appeared in 1865, after his death. The fourth volume in the twenty-first edition of Blackstone's \"Commentaries\" (1844) was edited by him, and the whole set, with notes adapting it to the use of the student in America, was issued at New York in 1847. The other works published under his editorship comprised J. F. Archbold's \"Summary of the Law on Pleading and Evidence in Criminal Cases\" (10th edit. 1846, 15th edit. 1862); Dr. Joseph Bateman's \"General Turnpike Road Acts\" (1854), and his \"General Highway Acts\" (1863); Sir John Jervis' \"Treatise on Office of Coroners\" (1854, reissued by C. W. Lovesy in 1866); Sir Christopher Rawlinson's \"Municipal Corporation Act\" (2nd, 3rd and 4th edit. 1850, 1856, and 1863); and he revised the second edition of Sir W. H. Watson's \"Treatise on the Office of Sheriff\" (2nd edit, 1848). Welsby also edited a volume containing sixteen admirable \"Lives of Eminent English Judges of the Seventeenth and Eighteenth Centuries\", which originally came out in the \"Law Magazine\"; nine of them were from his pen."

He was born to Jewish parents who had come to the United States from Belarus and settled in Trenton, New Jersey. Herrick was among the Abraham Lincoln Brigade who fought Franco's forces during the Spanish Civil War. Drawing on that experience he wrote Hermanos!, a novel published in 1969, about the war itself, and another novel set in Spain: Shadows and Wolves (1980), about the post-Franco period. He left the American Communist Party over the Hitler–Stalin non-aggression pact in 1939 and criticised the Brigade as willing accomplices of the Communist secret police, who were killing off anyone who criticized the Party. Two other novels touch on his experience in Spain: Love and Terror (1981) and Kill Memory (1983). His autobiography is entitled Jumping the Line: The Adventures and Misadventures of an American Radical (1998)."

  "text" : "William Nicholas Searancke (1817?–1904) was a notable New Zealand surveyor, land purchase commissioner, resident magistrate and land agent. He was born in St Albans Abbey, Hertfordshire, England in 1817?. Searancke established two families, one Māori and later one Pakeha (English). A granddaughter of Searancke, Te Puea Herangi (also known as Princess Te Puea), became notable as a Māori leader in the early twentieth century. In 1858 he was appointed District Commissioner in the Land Purchase Department in Wellington. He was sent to the Wairarapa. He had 4 children with Hariata Rangitaupua of Ngati Maniapoto. He had become notorious for negotiating secret deals and reneging on his promises. Searancke was exasperated with Wairarapa Maori, calling them unmitigated scoundrels. Searancke saw that Maori were very poor and would eventually sell. In 1858 he bought two large areas of Maori land-the Tupurupuru and Maungaraki blocks for the government. In July 1869 Searanke was the resident magistrate in the Waikato. He was present when the renegade Te Kooti, who had escaped with many Hau Hau prisoners from the Chatham Islands came to Te Kuiti to confront the Maori King Tawhaio. Te Kooti had vowed on his arrival back in Gisborne to replace Tawhaio as Maori king of New Zealand. Searanke reported to the government that Te kooti's presence in the king country appeared to paralyze the Waikato. Te Kooti put the fear of god into them by ordering his 500 men to load their guns and fire over the heads of the approaching Waikato. Te Kooti then ordered them to bring all their greenstone to him which he destroyed. The standoff continued for over a week with Tawhaio refusing to even see Te Kooti who was deliberately snubbed,being forced to camp outside the village on the roadside in contravention of all normal protocol for visitors. From Te Kuiti Searancke travelled with Te Kooti and chief Horonuku, who had spoken out in favour of Te Kooti, to visit Louis Hetet, a French trader who was considered Maniapotos' pakeha. At the meeting Rewi abstained from drinking but Te Kooti got very drunk and talked at length about the reasons for his previous actions but not about his future plans. Searancke warned Te Kooti that his \"escort\" would prevent him travelling down the Mokau valley and obliged him to return to Taupo again."

A member of the Communist Party USA from about 1932, Mortimer was a critic of the efforts of the conservative American Federation of Labor to control the union and was a leader of a so-called \"Unity Caucus\" which led the UAW to join forces with the more aggressive Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO). In the spring of 1941, Mortimer's refusal to follow the anti-strike line of the UAW's governing Executive Board during a highly controversial work stoppage at a California aircraft factory lead to his termination by the union and effectively brought an end to his career."

Watson was born at Nottingham, the son of John Watson, captain in the 76th Foot, by Elizabeth, daughter of Henry Grey of Bamburgh, Northumberland. He was educated at the Royal Military College, Marlow, and given a commission in the 1st Royal Dragoons by the Duke of York on 7 May 1812, serving with his regiment in the Spanish peninsula. When it was reduced in 1814 he exchanged into the 6th Dragoons on 13 April 1815, with whom he served in Belgium and France. He was present at the Battle of Waterloo and at the entry of the allied armies into Paris. He was placed on the half-pay list on 25 March 1816. The next year entered as a student at Lincoln's Inn, and by hard work soon became competent to practise as a special pleader, and continued to do so until 1832, when he was called to the bar in Lincoln's Inn. He joined the northern circuit, where he found work and became popular. In 1841 he entered the House of Commons as liberal member for Kinsale, for which borough he sat till 1847. In 1843 he became a Q.C. and a bencher of his inn. He was an unsuccessful candidate for Newcastle-on-Tyne in the liberal interest, July 1852, but in 1854 he was elected member for Hull, and sat as such until on 3 November 1856 he was created Baron of the Exchequer, to succeed Sir Thomas Joshua Platt. He was knighted on 28 November of the same year. Watson proved himself a judge possessed of clear head and strong mind, but his career on the bench was very short. On the conclusion of his charge to the grand jury of Montgomeryshire Spring Assizes at Welshpool, 13 March 1860, he was seized with apoplexy, and died, aged 63, at his lodging fifteen to twenty minutes later. He was buried in the churchyard of Christ Church in the town on 17 March. Watson married, first, in 1826, a daughter of William Armstrong of Newcastle-on-Tyne, and sister of Lord Armstrong; secondly, in 1831, Mary, daughter of Anthony Hollist of Midhurst, Sussex. His grandson William Watson-Armstrong was ennobled as Baron Armstrong in 1903. He was distinguished as an advocate by honesty and earnestness rather than eloquence, but was a sound lawyer and the author of two (for a time) standard professional works: \n* A Treatise on Arbitration and Award, London, 1825, 8vo; 3rd ed. 1846. \n* A Treatise on the Law relating to the Office and Duty of Sheriff, 8vo, 1827; 2nd ed. 1848, by William Newland Welsby."

Buckland, but after a year left to develop an interest in literature. Zeigler contributed historical material to the History of Sandusky County Ohio (1882). He also travelled through North Carolina with fellow lawyer Ben S. Grosscup to research their jointly written book The Heart of the Alleghanies; or, Western North Carolina. It was published in 1883. According to journalist George Ellison, the book is a \"neglected classic\", The co-authors wrote in a lively fashion about the Cherokees and their lore, the native mountaineers and their lore, bear hunting and trout fishing, famous hunters and renowned fishermen, farming and livestock, mountain scenery and customs, the coming of tourism, mining, the distinctive characteristics of Asheville and other mountain communities, and much more. It would be difficult to think of a topic they didn’t touch upon, often in passing but not infrequently in depth. The book is a neglected classic of Southern Appalachian literature. In 1883 Zeigler settled in San Francisco, and returned to legal work, concentrating on civil law. Eventually he formed the partnership Galpin & Zeigler."

His mother was Margaret Godman Fitzpatrick, daughter of Patrick Persse Fitzpatrick, of Bognor Regis, Sussex. He was educated at Eton and Trinity College, Cambridge. In 1889 he assumed by Royal licence the additional surname of Armstrong. Watson-Armstrong served in the Northumberland Hussars, where he was promoted Major on 12 April 1902. He was High Sheriff of Northumberland in 1899, and was appointed a Deputy Lieutenant of Northumberland in 1901. In 1900 he succeeded to the vast fortune of his great-uncle, Lord Armstrong. The following year he gave £100,000 (equivalent to £9,790,855 in 2015), for the building of the new Royal Victoria Infirmary in Newcastle upon Tyne, for which the city conferred upon him the honorary Freedom in July 1901. The original 1753 infirmary building at Forth Banks near the river Tyne were inadequate and impossible to expand. In September 1901 he was awarded the honorary degree of Doctor of Civil Law (DCL) from the University of Durham. In 1903 he was raised to the peerage as Baron Armstrong, of Bamburgh and Cragside in the County of Northumberland, a revival of the barony which had become extinct on his great-uncle's death three years earlier. Lord Armstrong was married three times. He married firstly Winifreda Jane Adye, daughter of General Sir John Miller Adye, in 1889. They had one son and one daughter. After her death in December 1914 he married secondly Beatrice Elizabeth Cowx, daughter of Jonathan Cowx, in 1916. After her death in November 1934 he married thirdly Kathleen England, daughter of Reverend Charles Thorpe England, in 1935. The last two marriages were childless. Lord Armstrong died in October 1941, aged 78, and was succeeded in the barony by his only son, William. Lady Armstrong died in 1970."

He was born in Bridgnorth, Shropshire, England in 1802. He joined the Church Missionary Society.Yate learned the Māori language and had Christian texts printed in Sydney for his work. Yate arrived in the Bay of Islands, New Zealand on 19 January 1828. Yate took a small printing press with him to the Bay of Islands and used it to produce a version of the third catechism in Māori, Ko te katihama III. With only a fortnight's training as a printer in Sydney, however, he found the task exasperatingly difficult and attempted nothing further on his press. He was appointed to lead the Waimate mission, however his personal life became a matter of controversy and he was dismissed from the CMS in June 1834."

From 1982–2004 he worked for the weekly newspaper The Riverfront Times, producing three columns, with the best known being Street Talk, where over the years he photographed and interviewed more than 8,500 random individuals about miscellaneous topics. He is also known for his documentary work on a special kind of historical outdoor advertising: vintage brick wall signs. As of 2016, he has authored 11 books, a combination of photography, non-fiction, and fiction, including Ghost Signs: Brick Wall Signs in America (1989), Mound City Chronicles (1991), and Litchfield: A Strange and Twisted Saga of Murder in the Midwest (1998). His photographs have appeared in multiple works, including the cover photograph on the Oxford University Press book, For the Common Good (2002). In 2001, Stage, who had been adopted as an infant, tracked down his biological family, a search which led to a Canadian television documentary and formed the basis for his 2009 memoir Fool for Life. In 2007, Stage was a guest commentator on the St. Louis NPR affiliate, KWMU-FM."

Wahanui was born probably in the late 1820s. In the late 1850s Wahanui participated in debates around the Māori King Movement. He became opposed to Pākehā institutions and government and fought at Pukekohe, Orakau and Hairini when the colonial government and British forces invaded the Waikato in 1863–64. After war ended he became an important leader of Ngāti Maniapoto and a principal adviser to the Māori King, Tāwhiao. He was opposed to Ngāti Maniapoto and Waikato selling land, but he and fellow Ngāti Maniapoto leaders Rewi Maniapoto and Taonui eventually realised the inevitability of their territory, the King Country, being opened to Pākehā. Wahanui, Rewi and Taonui signed a petition which was presented to Parliament in 1883; they criticised the government for legislation which ran contrary to the Treaty of Waitangi. He was later offered a seat in the Legislative Council, but did not take it up."

  "text" : "Winifred Lamb (1894-1963) was a British art historian, archeologist, and museum curator who specialised in Greek, Roman, Anatolian cultures and artifacts. The bulk of her career was spent as the Honorary Keeper of Greek and Roman Antiquities at the University of Cambridge's Fitzwilliam Museum from 1918 - 1958. She was the first female archeologist involved in the British Anatolian excavations, and the Fitwilliam museum states that she was a \"generous benefactor and raising the profile of the collections through groundbreaking research, acquisitions and publications.\" The daughter of Edmund Lamb, a former Member of Parliament, and Mabel Lamb, Winifred Lamb attended Newnham College and Cambridge University, studying Classics, earning her degree in 1917. She joined the British Naval Intelligence Department and served throughout World War I. It was here that Lamb met John Beazley, a renowned archeologist also working in British Intelligence, who encouraged her in her research. Her fieldwork and excavation skills were honed at the British School at Athens, which she began attending in 1920. Lamb took part in excavations in Mycenae, Sparta, and Macedonia. She then led her own excavations on Lesbos and in Anatolia. Her interest in the area eventually helped establish the British Institute of Archeology at Ankara. She is the author of numerous books on Greek and Roman antiquities, including the 1929 publication Greek and Roman Bronzes, which was standard reading for studies on the subject. During World War II, a German rocket hit her London apartment, injuring her badly. Her work at the museum continued through 1958, however, and she died seven years after retiring."

  "text" : "Wes Funk (February 18, 1969 – October 9, 2015) was a Canadian writer. Based in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, he published several novels and a chapbook of poetry and short stories, and hosted a weekly television series, Lit Happens, on Shaw TV's services in Saskatchewan. Funk, who was gay, was raised in a Mennonite household in rural Mayfair, Saskatchewan. He had a twin sister, who died in childhood. Funk published his debut novel, Dead Rock Stars, in 2008. Initially self-published, the book later gained national distribution. The novel was republished in audiobook form in 2013, and a new illustrated edition was published in 2015. In 2012, Funk pulled his book Cherry Blossoms off of bookstore shelves after the publisher inadvertently printed an early draft instead of the final version. The corrected edition was rereleased several weeks later. The book won a Bookie Award from CBC Books in 2013. In 2014, Funk published the memoir Wes Side Story. In addition to his writing and broadcasting, Funk also worked in social services. Funk died on October 9, 2015, in Edmonton, Alberta. He was 46 years old. At the time of his death, his short story \"Rescuing Lancelot\" had just been published in the literary magazine Jonathan, and his latest novel Frostbite was slated for publication in 2016."

In the 1820s and 1830s he was caught up in his tribe's resistance to a series of Waikato raids. After a Waikato victory at Maru, at the base of Mt Taranaki, in 1826, he became the leader of some 120 men and their families who stayed within the protection of Te Namu pa, near Opunake, when the remainder of the Taranaki tribe migrated to the Kapiti coast about 1827. Moki and his people were able to obtain muskets from European flax traders who had settled at Ngamotu, near present-day New Plymouth, in 1828. When in 1833 Waikato laid siege to Te Namu, Moki distinguished himself by his marksmanship and received the name Te Matakatea, the clear-eyed. Waikato retreated but, sensing that this was only a temporary reprieve, Te Matakatea led his people a few miles south to a complex of three pa at the mouth of the Kapuni Stream, in the territory of his Ngati Ruanui relatives."

He inherited a substantial fortune from his mother's family. He was returned to Parliament for County Durham in 1708, a seat he held until 1710. In 1720 he was elevated to the Peerage of Ireland as Baron Vane, of Dungannon in the County of Tyrone, and Viscount Vane. These titles did not disqualify him from sitting in the House of Commons and in 1727 he was successfully returned for Steyning. On 15 May 1734 he was elected a Knight of the Shire for Kent. However, he died suddenly only five days later. Lord Vane married Lucy Jolliffe, daughter of Sir William Jolliffe, of Caverswall Castle, Staffordshire, in 1703. He died at Fairlawne, Shipbourne, Kent, in May 1734, and was succeeded in the viscountcy by his only surviving son, William. Lady Vane died in March 1742."

  "text" : "William Bayard Jr (1761–1826) was a prominent New York City banker and a member of the Society of the New York Hospital. He was a close friend to Alexander Hamilton and it was to Bayard's Greenwich Village home located at what is today 80-82 Jane Street where the mortally wounded Hamilton was taken after his famous duel with Aaron Burr. Hamilton died in Bayard's home the next day. Bayard was a member of the prominent Bayard family of French Huguenot ancestry who descended from Balthazar Bayard, a French Protestant, who had taken refuge in the Dutch Republic where the Huguenots found sanctuary from their religious persecution in France. The first Bayards in the New World arrived in the Dutch colony of New Amsterdam with the newly appointed Governor-General Peter Stuyvesant. In the early 18th century the Bayards became among the largest landowners in the New York-New Jersey area. Bayard was also a descendant of Stephanus Van Cortlandt and the Schuyler family. His father, William Bayard Sr., was elected as a delegate to the 1765 Stamp Act Congress, and was assigned to the committee that drafted language opposing taxation without representation. However, when the American Revolutionary War broke out in 1775, the father remained loyal to the crown, assisting the British troops that occupied New York City in 1776. Although Bayard Jr. remained in New York after the war, other members of the family had fled, and many of its properties were confiscated. In 1783 Bayard married Elizabeth Cornell, a descendant of Thomas Cornell. Elizabeth was the daughter of Loyalist Samuel Cornell and Susannah Mabson. Samuel Cornell died in 1781 in British controlled New York, having moved there from North Carolina after 1777 after refusing to take the Oath of Allegiance to the new United States. Samuel Cornell had transferred a share of his North Carolina property to Elizabeth, however in 1779 the North Carolina Legislature voted to retroactively seize all property of Loyalists back to 1776. In November 1784 Mrs. Bayard sued to have her property returned to her but was unsuccessful. William Jr. and Elizabeth had seven children. Catherine and Maria were each married to Duncan P. Campbell. Susan married Benjamin Woolsey Rogers, son of Moses Rogers, a wealthy New York merchant who owned Shippan Point, and Sarah Woolsey, and a distant cousin descended from Thomas Cornell. Harriet Elizabeth married General Stephen Van Rensselaer, a distant cousin through the Van Cortlandt family. William and Elizabeth are both buried in the Churchyard Cemetery of Trinity Church in lower Manhattan."

  "text" : "Wollert Krohn-Hansen (1889—1973) was a Norwegian theologian and pastor. He was the Bishop of the Diocese of Hålogaland from 1940 until 1952, and was instrumental in dividing it into two smaller dioceses. After the division of the diocese, he was appointed as the first Bishop of the Diocese of Sør-Hålogaland from 1952 until his retirement in 1959. In 1914, he received his Cand.theol. degree from the MF Norwegian School of Theology in Oslo. In 1915 he began his career as a parish priest in Værøy and Røst. He worked there until 1922 when he moved to Ofoten. From 1929 until 1936 he was the priest of Narvik. From 1936 until 1940 he was the priest of Tromsø Cathedral. In 1940, fourteen days before the German invasion of Norway, he was named the Bishop of the Diocese of Hålogaland. In 1952, his diocese was divided into two new dioceses: Diocese of Sør-Hålogaland and Diocese of Nord-Hålogaland. Krohn-Hansen then moved from Tromsø to Bodø to lead the new Diocese of Sør-Hålogaland. The northern diocese used the Tromsø Cathedral as its headquarters, but the new diocese in the south didn't have its own cathedral. The new Bodø Cathedral was built and it was consecrated in 1956 by Krohn-Hansen. He retired in 1959 and served in some interim pastoral work during his retirement. Krohn-Hansen died in 1973."

As a child Penn attended public schools in Lynchburg, Virginia and then Hampton Institute and Virginia Normal and Industrial School. He first attended medical school at Leonard Medical School for Blacks in Raleigh, North Carolina before being invited to attend Yale Medical School in 1893. He graduated in 1897, the first African-American to do so, as well as the first African-American to head the university yearbook. In 1898 he met and later married Lula Tompkins, taking her son, Louis T. Wright, as his step-son. Penn had a significant influence on Wright, who also pursued a career in medicine, graduating fourth in his class at Harvard Medical School and serving as the first African-American surgeon on staff at the Harlem Hospital. Penn was a founding member of the Atlanta chapter of the NAACP in 1917, a national organization for which his stepson Louis would later serve as chairman. He is mentioned as a speaker at a meeting of city leaders in the aftermath of the Atlanta Race Riot in 1906, and in 1921 at the opening of Joyland, the first amusement park opened for blacks in Atlanta."

Listeners of both races tuned in to hear information about segregation, disfranchisement, patriotism (this was during World War II), and black migration to the north. The program became the second-highest-rated broadcast in Atlanta. During bus desegregation in Atlanta, Borders sat in the front of a bus and was arrested. He formed the Wheat Street Credit Union to provide low-interest loans to blacks. Three times in the 1960s and 1970s, Borders ran for the Georgia House of Representatives but failed. Borders Sr. was the father of William Holmes Border, Jr., and the grandfather of Lisa Borders, member of the Atlanta City Council and one-time candidate for mayor of Atlanta in the 2009 election."

He was also one of the two founders of the Singapore Free Press, and edited that weekly newspaper until 1846, when he returned to the UK for health reasons. William had befriended James Brooke in Singapore and, on being appointed Governor of the new British colony of Labuan in 1847, Brooke chose him to be his deputy as Lieutenant-Governor. However, Brooke summarily dismissed Napier in 1851 for alleged misconduct. Napier remained in Singapore as Attorney. William was the first Chairman of the Straits Settlements Association, set up in London in 1868. William had a daughter, Catherine (1829–1851), by a Eurasian woman from Malacca. In 1844, he married the widow of architect George Coleman and adopted her son, George Vernon Coleman. They soon had a son, James Brooke, but he died young and is commemorated by the largest monument in Fort Canning Park; a daughter, Maria J., was born in 1846, and they had two more sons in England (Robert J. in 1860, and Harry B. in 1861). In 1848, Catherine met Hugh Low, the Colonial Secretary to Labuan, on the sea-voyage from England to Labuan to establish the new government: they were married, en route, in Singapore. William Napier is commemorated in Singapore by Napier Road."

In Bonn he made the acquaintanceship of a publisher named Schorer, through whom he became an editor of Schorer's Familienblatt. During his time in Bonn, he developed an interest in handwriting analysis, being influenced by the work of pioneer graphologist Jean-Hippolyte Michon (1806-1881). At the insistence of Schorer, he relocated to Berlin in 1891, where he opened a photographic art institute, and with Schorer founded the Graphologisches Bureau. In Berlin he developed a reputation as a handwriting expert, eventually performing important graphological work for the municipal judicial system. In 1895 he published Graphologischen Studien, followed by Praktische Menschenkenntnis auf Grund der Handschrift (Practical knowledge of human nature learned from handwriting) in 1911, and Autographen-Album bedeutender und interessanter Persönlichkeiten (Autograph album of important and interesting personalities). In April 1895, with physiologist William Thierry Preyer (1841-1897) and psychiatrist Friedrich Albrecht Erlenmeyer (1849–1926), he founded a journal of palaeography and graphology titled Die Handschrift, Blatter fur wissenschaftliche Schriftkunde und Graphologie."

  "text" : "Dr. William G. Conway (born 1929) is an American zoologist, ornithologist and conservationist who began his career with the St. Louis Zoo. He joined the New York Zoological Society in 1956 as assistant curator of birds. He was later promoted to director of the society, and then became president of it in 1992 when it was reconfigured into the Wildlife Conservation Society. He retired as president in 1999 and retained the title of senior conservationist. During his tenure, Conway was responsible for modernizing the animal exhibits at the Bronx Zoo and he also introduced new attractions, including the World of Darkness exhibit in 1969 and the World of Birds exhibit in 1974. Conway was a proponent of zoological exhibition of animals in a setting that recreated the environment from which the species originated from. Conway successfully negotiated the society’s acquisition of the Central Park Zoo from the New York City municipal government in 1981, which resulted in an extensive renovation program for the attraction so it could meet modern zoological exhibition requirements. Conway has also been in the forefront of promoting captive breeding programs for endangered species. He was responsible for creating the Wildlife Propagation Trust in 1964, that resulted in the coordination of zoos to pursue the twin goals of preserving at-risk species and eventually reintroducing animals back to the wild. Conway was also responsible for leading the development of the American Zoo and Aquarium Association accreditation program. He has authored more than 250 articles and reports relating to wildlife conservation, ornithology, wild animal care propagation and ecological preservation. In 1999, the National Audubon Society awarded Conway its highest honor, the Audubon Medal."

He was interviewed by government officials in 1857 while the government was considering what action to take over a rising demand by Waikato Māori for law and order in the district to replace ancient tikanga which had fallen into disuse. At an 1857 meeting at Paetai, near Rangiriri, to discuss proposals for a Māori kingship, Kukutai led a contingent that paraded under the Union Jack. Although opposed to land-selling, he spoke against the establishment of the kingship and supported the appointment of magistrates, laws and a form of rūnanga or council. Governor George Grey agreed to meet those demands. The Government introduced written laws, magistrates and courts, built a printing press to inform Māori of government decisions and helped establish a trade school in the Te Awamutu area where Christianity was popular among Maori. In 1861 Grey appointed Kukutai as a head Māori magistrate and government adviser. Kukutai and Wiremu Te Wheoro assisted British forces in the military invasion of the Waikato in July 1863, building and occupying a pa at Te Ia, (near Mercer) and transporting supplies for the British from steamers at Waikato Heads upriver to the Camerontown redoubt, until the supply line was severed by a Ngati Maniapoto attack in September. Kukutai fought with the Kingitanga forces at Rangiriri in November 1863. He was appointed as a major in the New Zealand militia. In December 1866 Kukutai poisoned himself following his wife's death; he died a month later aged 45."

He has identified gene families that contribute to insulin resistance in human muscle insulin using cDNA microarray, e.g., NR4A orphan nuclear receptors and the tribbles gene family, and is using mitochondrial proteomics to better define mitochondrial defects that impair substrate oxidation. Garvey has provided service as a member of national research review committees for the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation, the American Diabetes Association, the VA Merit Review Program, and the National Institutes of Health. Garvey serves on the editorial boards of the Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism and Diabetes. He is a member of the American Society for Clinical Investigation, the Association of American Physicians, the Endocrine Society, and the American Diabetes Association. Garvey has studied a combination of two prescription drugs, topiramate and phentermine, which produced very good weight-loss results in people who are obese."

Senior was born in Holmfirth, Yorkshire, England in June 1837, son of Joseph Senior and wife Martha. Senior became the first officially appointed Principal Short Hand writer for the Parliament of Queensland's 'Hansard'. He had by then served ten years as a special correspondent and parliamentary reporter for the London Daily News and London special reporter for the Manchester Examiner when he was employed (on the instigation of Queensland's Colonial Secretary and Premier, Arthur Macalister and the Speaker, William Henry Walsh), as Queensland Parliament's first Short Hand Writer on 13 January 1876. He was an able writer who produced in his spare time a number of short stories for the Queenslander during his time in office, simultaneously being a Queensland correspondent for his old journal the London Daily News. Senior returned to England in April 1881 where he took up his old profession as a journalist on the Daily News and editor. He became editor-in-chief of the sports journal 'The Field,' of which journal he was formerly the angling editor. He wrote and edited this journal for over twenty-five years, still frequently using his old nom de plume \"Red Spinner\", simultaneously being for a number of years the London correspondent for the Brisbane Courier. He died in London in October 1920."

  "text" : "William Grant (23 September 1843 & Died5 November 1910) was a New Zealand shepherd, stock dealer and landowner. He was born in Contin, Ross-shire, Scotland on 23 September 1843. William Grant was born on Kirkan farm, in the parish of Contin, Ross-shire, Scotland, on 23 September 1843, the son of Ann Tait and her husband, Donald Grant, a shepherd. With an older brother, Andrew, William set out for New Zealand in 1864 on the Eastern Empire, arriving at Lyttelton in January 1865. On the day they arrived Charles Tripp of Orari Gorge station was at the port looking for shepherds for his run in South Canterbury. Observing a fine-looking sheep-dog with the Grant brothers, and assuming that only good shepherds would bring such a dog with them, he hired both men. Andrew was later appointed manager of Orari Gorge.In addition to wages, William was allowed to run some cattle of his own on part of Orari Gorge. This gave him a start in stock dealing, at which he was to become extremely successful, and he soon progressed into business as a full-time stock dealer. At first he drove cattle to the West Coast to supply beef to goldminers, but he was soon handling large numbers of sheep as well. During the 1870s William made Temuka his headquarters for a stock dealing business which in time extended well beyond Canterbury.His land transactions were complex. With Andrew he bought a farm at Rangitata in the 1870s, and Richmond station at Lake Tekapo in 1880. A year later William purchased the 1,010-acre Elloughton Grange farm, which lay on the outskirts of Timaru, and lived there for the rest of his life. William and Andrew sold Richmond in 1882, and in the same year William sold his interest in the Rangitata farm. In 1883 he bought the Irishman Creek run in the centre of the Mackenzie Country, which he sold again in 1890. Probably to maintain a base for his stock dealings in that area he bought the Grampians run in 1892, which he owned until 1908. In 1902 he had bought Irishman Creek again, as well as the adjoining run, The Wolds.Grant married Elizabeth Helen Allan, the daughter of Robert Allan, a Timaru contractor, near Timaru on 30 April 1884. There were to be three sons and two daughters of the marriage. In 1893 he built The Grange, a two-storeyed, 17-roomed mansion, on Elloughton Grange. It was designed by the French-born Timaru architect Maurice Duval.Grant had new opportunities with the beginning of the frozen-meat trade in the early 1880s. In 1885 the South Canterbury Refrigerating Company, in which Grant had a substantial shareholding, began operating from its Smithfield freezing works at Timaru, a short distance from Elloughton Grange. The company did not buy in stock, but handled consignments on behalf of owners. Filling the need for an on-farm purchaser, Grant was soon buying and supplying large numbers of stock to the works, to the point where he was using its total capacity for four and even five days a week. For a time a substantial part of the frozen meat leaving Timaru, including at least one entire shipload, was owned by William Grant.In his later years, having largely retired from stock dealing, Grant paid all his attention to his land and financial interests. He was by then a very wealthy man, investing most of his fortune in first mortgages, usually to Scots, and often with a genuine helpfulness.William Grant died of a heart attack at Elloughton Grange early in the morning of 5 November 1910. He was buried at Timaru on 11 November. His estate was valued at £208,000. Elizabeth Grant continued to live at The Grange until her death in 1942. A plain, unassuming, good-natured man, said to look rather like King Edward VII, William Grant was respected and well liked. His business acumen and remarkable knowledge of stock made him one of New Zealand's most successful meat operators, and for a long time the country's leading buyer and shipper."

  "text" : "Sir Worley Bassett Edwards (5 September 1850 – 1 June 1927) was a New Zealand lawyer and judge. Edwards was born in London, England, the son of Charles Scatcherd Wilson Edwards and his wife Cornelia Allen (Waller). He went to the Otago Region, New Zealand, with his parents in 1856. Having embraced the practice of the law he gained a leading position in the profession, and was appointed a judge of the native land court, with the position of a puisne judge of the Supreme Court of New Zealand, in 1890 by the Atkins Government. When the Ballance Cabinet came into power in 1891, they disputed the appointment as ultra vires, but the New Zealand Court of Appeal decided that the nomination was valid. The case was carried to the Privy Council, and in May 1892 the Judicial Committee gave a decision adverse to the legality of the appointment, on the ground that Parliament had not previously been asked to provide Judge Edwards's salary. Edwards married Mary A. Cutten at Wellington in June 1886. He was knighted in the 1919 New Year Honours."

  "text" : "Walter D'Arcy Cresswell (22 January 1896 – 21 February 1960) was a New Zealand poet, journalist and writer. He was born in Christchurch, New Zealand on 22 January 1896. Cresswell was the son of Hannah (née Reese) and Walter Joseph Cresswell, a solicitor. His elder brother was Douglas Cresswell later known as a writer. On leaving school (Christ's College, 1910–1912) Walter joined the Christchurch architectural firm of Collins and Harman. In mid 1914 Cresswell went to London to further studies at the Architectural Association, and in early 1915 enlisted as a private with the Middlesex Regiment. He was wounded in France in 1916, and after convalescence joined the Corps of New Zealand Engineers, serving from 1917 until the demobilisation of 1919. He was entitled to the British War Medal and the Victory Medal. Cresswell famously blackmailed Charles Mackay, then Mayor of Wanganui, by outing him as a gay man. Shortly after their first meeting Cresswell was shot and injured by Mackay. Cresswell survived and the Mayor was convicted of attempted murder in 1920. Cresswell returned to London in 1921 where he spent most of the rest of his life although he retained his New Zealand links, and made several trips back home.In August 1925 Cresswell married Emily Freda Dacie (the 'Freda' of several of his poems) in the Marylebone Register Office in London. The marriage was short-lived, although a son was born early the following year. In London he eked out a somewhat precarious existence while writing and died there in 1960. A number of volumes of his poems were published over the years - some in New Zealand. Of Walter Cresswell it was said \"He is not remotely the poet he believed himself to be, and, judged on his verse alone, would long have been forgotten\". In later life he was more simply known as \"D'Arcy Cresswell\". For example, some of is letters were published as \"The Letters of D'Arcy Cresswell\" in 1971 by the University of Canterbury."

Prior to taking on positions in Chongqing, Wang served as vice-mayor and police chief of Jinzhou, Liaoning, and the police chief of Tieling, Liaoning. Wang rose to prominence in Liaoning where he gained a reputation for carrying out effective campaigns against organized crime. He became a close associate of prominent politician Bo Xilai, initially working for Bo in Liaoning province, then taking up the police chief post in Chongqing once Bo became party chief there. In Chongqing, Wang was known for his role as a political fixer for Bo Xilai, in addition to carrying out the Chongqing gang trials, which gained significant media coverage. In March 2012, Wang, feeling threatened after having fallen out with Bo, abruptly appeared at the U.S. consulate in Chengdu in what became known as the Wang Lijun incident, setting off a sensational and protracted political scandal that brought down himself and Bo Xilai. In September 2012, Wang was convicted on charges of abuse of power, bribery, and defection, and sentenced to fifteen years in prison. He also testified against Bo Xilai at Bo's trial."

After practising from 1934 at Crayford, he started his speedway career at the Leicester Super track in 1936, winning the (unofficial) Midland Riders Championship, and joining New Cross in 1937. He moved team several times in the late 1930s, joining Wimbledon Dons later in 1937, Leeds in 1938, and Middlesbrough and then Edinburgh in 1939. With the speedway leagues suspended during World War II, Plant worked in his garage in Asfordby repairing tractors. He returned to Middlesbrough in 1946, moving on to Fleetwood during the 1948 season, transferring for a fee of GB£1,000. In 1949 he captained the unofficial British team that toured South Africa. Plant signed for Coventry Bees, and towards the end of the 1951 season, joined Long Eaton Archers on loan, signing for the team in 1952, which was his last season, Plant retiring from the sport at the end of the season, although he did come out of retirement to ride in 'pirate' meetings at Long Eaton in 1954. Plant's son Graham followed him into a career in speedway."

  "text" : "Tom Miller (born May 5, 1962) better known by his ring name Wild Bull Miller, is an American professional wrestler. Miller started wrestling at age 14 in junior high school, and would successfully compete as an amateur until he graduated high school in 1981. He tracked down former WWF star, Flying Fred Curry, before graduating, and Fred, along with his father, Wild Bull Curry, and former wrestler, Bobby Pico, trained Miller to become a professional. Miller started wrestling professionally in late 1981 as Aaron Lee Star. His first match was in Circleville, Ohio, for the now defunct NAWA. That show actually resulted in a riot as several fans was not happy with the fact many of the star wrestlers advertised was not there. As Aaron Star, he also had a few matches on Superstation WTBS, losing to the likes of Wildfire Tommy Rich and Brad Armstrong among others. Upon the death of his trainer, Bull Curry, in 1985, Miller took the name Wild Bull in his honor. Throughout the 80's and 90's, he wrestled for a host of Ohio-based promotions as well as the Indiana-based World Wrestling Association (Dick the Bruiser's promotion) and the Detroit Michigan's NWA affiliate (ran by the Original Sheik). In 1988 he started the International Wrestling Alliance (IWA) and was based out of Columbus Ohio. The IWA sponsored events mainly through Ohio and stands today as Ohio's longest running pro wrestling organization. He started running a pro wrestling school in the late 90s and trained close to a hundred wrestlers over a ten-year period. Many of these wrestlers wrestled for the IWA promotion as well as several other federations. He closed down the original school in 1994 but still continues to train aspiring wrestlers on and off. Besides wrestling, promoting wrestling shows and training wrestling hopefuls, Miller has also produced several pro wrestling television shows."

Raven was granted 100 acres (40 ha) of land in the vicinity of Tennyson Point, New South Wales in 1795, plus another 285 acres (115 ha) in 1799. The grant was known as Grove Farm. These Eastern Farms, now Kissing Point, properties were managed for him by the brewer James Squire of Kissing Point until Squire's death in 1822. The tip of the peninsula into the Parramatta River at Tennyson Point is now called Raven Point."

  "text" : "William Arnold Lynch (August 4, 1844 – February 6, 1907) was an Ohio lawyer and politician. Lynch was born in Canton, Ohio, USA in 1844, the son of Arnold Lynch and Frances (Horan) Lynch. Lynch's parents, both Irish immigrants, had moved to Ohio in their young adulthood. Arnold Lynch was employed as a surveyor and later held office as county surveyor and recorder of deeds. Arnold Lynch died in 1857, when his son was thirteen years old. William Lynch attended the public schools in Canton and graduated at the age of sixteen. He studied the law at a local attorney's office and was admitted to the bar in 1865. The next year, Lynch ran as a Democrat for the office of prosecuting attorney of the county and was elected. Lynch was appointed city solicitor of Canton the same year, holding both offices simultaneously. After completing a two-year term, he was defeated for reelection by his Republican opponent, future U.S. President William McKinley. Lynch was renominated in 1870, facing off again against McKinley, and was narrowly elected. Lynch did not seek reelection in 1872, instead starting a private practice with William R. Day, the future Supreme Court justice. In 1874, he married Eliza Underhill, with whom he had three daughters. The next year, 1875, Day and Lynch faced off against McKinley in court, the two partners representing a group of coal mine owners, and McKinley representing a group of striking miners. The case involved charges the miners rioted when confronted with strikebreakers, but only one man was convicted. Lynch's brother, Austin, joined the firm in 1878, which then became known as Lynch, Day, and Lynch. William Lynch resigned from the partnership in 1882, but the firm continued and is the predecessor of the Canton, Ohio firm Day Ketterer, which still exists. After leaving private practice, Lynch was exclusively employed working for railroad interests, including the Connoton Valley Railroad and the Pittsburgh, Akron & Western Railroad Company. He also was among the owners of the Canton-Massilon Electric Railroad, an intercity line. After McKinley's assassination in 1901, Lynch was one of the founders of the McKinley National Memorial Association, which was responsible for the construction of the McKinley National Memorial. From 1903 to 1906, he served as a city councilman in Canton. He practiced law up to his final day, February 6, 1907, when he died in the middle of a trial in Lisbon, Ohio."

Their formal aspects, however, remain within the prevailing Gothic style. Images of this kind may be found in museums and various churches in Cologne, Munich, Nuremberg, Frankfurt am Main and Berlin, and there is a plaque to him in the Walhalla temple."

His work on forecasting methods includes books on Political Risk (Euromoney, 198_) and (with William Ascher) Strategic Planning and Forecasting (Wiley, 1983). He edited the first book on nuclear proliferation and nuclear strategies in Asia, Asia’s Nuclear Future (Praeger, 1976). His edited volume, The Future of Brazil (Praeger, 1978) evolved from a country risk that inspired considerable early work in the field of political risk analysis. Overholt’s political advising has included intense involvement in Zimbabwe’s movement to independence (1979-1981), South Korean domestic conflicts in 1980, the Philippines revolution of 1986, Burma’s insurgent wars of the late 1980s, and Hong Kong’s transition.

  "text" : "Winfred Overholser (1892 – October 6, 1964) was an American psychiatrist, president of the American Psychiatric Association, and for 25 years the superintendent of St. Elizabeths Hospital, a federal institution for the mentally ill in Washington, D.C. Born in Worcester, Massachusetts, in 1892, Winfred Overholser graduated from Harvard College in 1912 and received a medical degree from Boston University in 1916. He was Commissioner of the Massachusetts Department of Mental Diseases and worked with the National Committee for Mental Hygiene in New York. In 1940, he and his colleague Harry Stack Sullivan, as members of the American Psychiatric Association's Committee on Military Mobilization, formulated guidelines for the psychological screening of inductees to the United States military. He campaigned for recognition of alcoholism as a mental disease, calling it in 1940 \"the greatest public health problem which is not being scientifically attacked. As early as 1941 he warned of the need to consider the mental health of an aging population and said that old age pensions could prove to be \"one of the most important developments in the prevention of mental breakdowns in later life.\" He served as superintendent of St. Elizabeths Hospital, a federal institution for the mentally ill in Washington, D.C., from 1937 to 1962. His most famous patient there was Ezra Pound. In 1947, he agreed to move Pound to the more pleasant surroundings of Chestnut Ward, close to his private quarters, which is where he spent the next twelve years. He was instrumental in Pound's release in 1958, after reporting that there was a \"strong probability\" that criminal insanity explained his crime and that \"further confinement can serve no therapeutic purpose.\" He also testified on behalf of Frank H. Schwable, a Marine who, while held prisoner by North Korea, confessed to participating in germ warfare. He served in 1948 as president of the American Psychiatric Association. He was for a time the editor in chief of the Quarterly Review of Psychiatry and Neurology. In 1949, he provided a pessimistic assessment of the prospects for St. Elizabeth's patients who had been subject to lobotomies. He told a professional conference: \"I am sorry to say that even when they are improved, they are still nothing to brag about. We are not enthusiastic.\" Overholser retired in 1962 after 25 years as superintendent of St. Elizabeths Hospital where under his administration the hospital pioneered the use of \"group therapy, tranquillizing drugs and psychodrama.\" He was also Professor Emeritus of Psychiatry of George Washington University School of Medicine. As Chairman of the American Psychiatric Association, Overholser concluded that United States Secretary of Defense James Forrestal \"came to his death by suicide while in a state of mental depression\". Boston University award him its alumni medal in 1962. He received as well the United States Selective Service Medal. France awarded him its Legion of Honor and Medal of Liberation. He died on October 6, 1964. His wife and three children survived him."

Runyan was ordained as a Methodist minister at age twenty-one and then pastored various congregations in Kansas. Runyan attended Northwestern University for three years from 1895 to 1898. Starting in 1915 Runyan began writing gospel songs with the encouragement of D.B. Towner of the Moody Bible Institute. In 1923 Runyan moved from Wichita to Chicago. From 1924 to 1926 Runyan was affiliated with John Brown University in Siloam Springs, Arkansas pastoring the Federated Church, and editing the Christian Workers' Magazine. Runyan then moved back to Chicago where he worked with the Moody Bible Institute, and he worked as editor for Hope Publishing Company, co-editing \"The Service Hymnal\" with Gordon Shorney. In 1923 Runyan composed the music to the song \"Great is Thy Faithfulness,\" originally a poem by Thomas O. Chisholm, a friend and fellow Methodist minister. Runyan retired from Hope in 1948 and received the honorary Doctor of Letters from Wheaton College. Runyan lived for a period of his retirement in Galveston, Texas and died on July 29, 1957 in Pittsburg, Kansas. He is buried in Baldwin City, Kansas. Runyan was a professor and preacher at Baker University in Baldwin City for a period and his children attended the University. Runyan's survivors endowed the \"The Rev. William M.

  "text" : "William Peryn (died 1558) was an English Catholic theologian and prior of St Bartholomew's, Smithfield, London. Peryn was educated at Blackfriars in Oxford and there are records of him being there in 1529 and 1531, the year in which he was ordained. He went to London and was a preacher strongly against heresy, and a chaplain to Sir John Port. He went into exile with the declaration of royal supremacy in 1534 but returned to England in 1543, when he applied for a degree of BTh at Oxford. He became a chantrist at St Paul's and in early 1547 preached in favour of images in religious services. With the accession of Protestant Edward VI in 1547 he went into exile again, spending several years in Louvain before returning to England in 1553 upon the accession of Catholic Mary I. That year he was appointed prior of the Dominican house at St Bartholomew's in Smithfield, London. This was the first religious house founded by Mary. On 8 February 1556 Peryn is recorded by the diarist Henry Machyn as preaching at Paul's Cross. Peryn was the author of three books: Thre Godly Sermons of the Sacrament of the Aulter (1546); Spirituall exercyses and goostly meditacions, and a neare waye to come to perfection and lyfe contemplatyve (1557); and De frequenter celebranda missa (of which no copy survives). The three sermons published were originally preached at St. Anthony's Hospital in London, and are dedicated to Edmund Bonner, Bishop of London. He borrowed heavily from Bishop of Rochester John Fisher's De veritate corporis et sanguinis Christi in eucharistia and in the preface Peryn explains why he has published the sermons: ...in homely and playne sentens, by cause that I have cheflye prepared them...for the unlearned. And the veryte (beyng delectable and bewtifull of herselfe) nedeth not, the gorgius ornamentes, of eloquens. Also the matters of our fayth, hath moche lesse nede of rethoricall perswacyons, havynge theyr grond, and fundacyon, upon the infallyble veritie, of goddes holy worde. Peryn's Spirituall exercyses was dedicated to two exiled English nuns; Katherine Palmer, abbess of the nuns at Syon and Isleworth, and Dorothy Clement, a Poor Clare at Louvain and the daughter of Sir Thomas More's adopted daughter Margaret Clement. It was also based on Nicolaus van Esch's Exercitia theologiae mysticae. This work by Peryn was to have a long readership among English recusants and was much treasured by Margaret Clitheroe. It would be republished by a Catholic press of Caen in 1598. Peryn died in 1558 and was buried in St Bartholomew's on 22 August, at the high altar."

He developed algorithms for compressing three dimensional images into billions of tiny triangular modules. At telecommunications firm Alcatel-Lucent in New Jersey, he led development of new cell tower technology called lightRadio which reduces the size of transmission equipment dramatically. The equipment uses only basic electrical power and can be placed indoors and linked to optical fiber cables; it enables mobile networks to operate with much less electricity, halving CO2 emissions and reducing the carbon footprint, and permitting cell phone service to reach more people over expanded geographic areas. The technology may mean the end of cell towers within ten years, according to several reports."

He taught first at the School of Oriental and African Studies as a lecturer in Phonetics (1948–51) and then in Comparative Linguistics (1951–55), then held the position of Professor of Comparative Philology at the University of Cambridge until his retirement in 1982. His teachers and influences included N. B. Jopson, Harold Bailey and J. R. Firth, and R. H. Robins was a close colleague. He was elected a Fellow of the British Academy in 1971. He was influential in the development of several important figures in British linguistics, including George Hewitt, John Lyons, John C. Wells, and Geoffrey Horrocks, who now holds Allen's former position as Professor of Comparative Philology. He was also influential in developing linguistics as a distinct discipline in 20th-century Britain, lobbying the General Board of the University of Cambridge to set up linguistics positions in the 1960s, and in helping to found the section for linguistics (subsequently renamed 'Linguistics and Philology') at the British Academy in 1985. The University of Cambridge has a prize named after him, awarded for distinguished performance by a linguistics undergraduate."
