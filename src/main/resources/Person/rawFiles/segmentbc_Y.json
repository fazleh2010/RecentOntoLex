  "text" : "Yuri Abramovich Golfand (Russian: Ю́рий Абра́мович Го́льфанд; January 10, 1922, in Kharkiv – February 17, 1994, in Jerusalem) was a Russian and Israeli physicist known, in particular, for his 1971 paper (joint with his student Evgeny Likhtman) where they proposed supersymmetry between bosonic and ferminoic particles by extending the Poincaré algebra with anticommuting spinor generators. The algebra they constructed is also called a Super-Poincaré algebra. Yuri Golfand was also a Refusenik. He was fired from his work at the Physical institute in Moscow in 1973, two years after publishing his work on supersymmetry. After 18 years of waiting, he obtained a permission to leave Soviet Union and emigrated to Israel in 1990. He worked at the Technion and died in 1994."

The overseas experience is the turning point for his creations because those well-known Spanish masterpieces had a great influence on Tsai.

  "text" : "Yukio Sakurauchi  (櫻内 幸雄 Sakurauchi Yukio, 14 October 1888 – 9 October 1947) was an entrepreneur, politician and cabinet minister in the pre-war Empire of Japan. He was the father of prominent post-war politician Yoshio Sakurauchi, and grandfather of controversial politician Seiichi Ota. Sakurauchi was born in former Hirose Town Shimane Prefecture, in what is now part of the city of Yasugi, Shimane. The Sakurauchi family were former samurai in the service of Matsue Domain. His father relocated to Yonago in neighboring Tottori Prefecture in 1885, and started a company to produce and sell Water wheels. The venture did not succeed, and the family moved to Sakaiminato starting a business in commodity trading in 1886, followed by tofu production and retail sales in 1887. Sakurauchi left home in 1893 to work in a paper mill in Yokohama in 1893 for minimal wages. In 1895, he was in Tokyo, working as a typesetter and artisan for a newspaper, becoming a reporter for the Nippon Telegraph news agency in 1902, and executive director of the Ogura Racing Association by 1907. Making a fortune in speculating in horses by 1908, he was appointed president of Saitama Electric Light Company in 1909 and president of Okayama Hydroelectric Company in 1917. Sakurauchi was elected to the Lower House of the Diet of Japan in the 1920 General Election, under the Rikken Seiyūkai banner, and was reelected for six terms. Sakurauchi became president of Ibiden company in 1925. He subsequently changed his political party affiliation to the Rikken Minseitō, and served as Secretary-General of the party in 1927. In 1931, Prime Minister Wakatsuki Reijirō picked Sakurauchi as Minister of Commerce and Industry. He returned to the Cabinet under the Hirota administration as Minister of Agriculture and Forestry in 1939. In 1940, Sakurauchi was asked to serve as Treasury Minister under the Yonai administration. As with all other Japanese politicians, Sakurauchi was forced to join the Taisei Yokusankai created by Prime Minister Fumimaro Konoe. From May 1945 to April 1946, Sakurauchi served as a member of the Privy Council. After the surrender of Japan, Sakurauchi was purged from public office in 1946 along with all other members of the wartime administration. He died the following year."

In his old age, he decided to give the war a Native American perspective. From their meeting in 1907 till his death in 1935, Yellow Wolf talked annually to Lucullus Virgil McWhorter, who wrote a book for him, Yellow Wolf: His Own Story. He is notable as one of the few members of the defeated Nez Perce to talk openly to strangers and tell their story to the world. Others of his tribe said he was making a fool of himself for talking to a white man, saying that the children of the tribe would tell the story. In spite of that, he continued to work with McWhorter. In telling the native's side he said, \"I am telling my story that all may know the war we did not want. War is made to take something that is not your own.\" He was concerned that the next generation of Native Americans would continue to suffer under white oppression, and wrote to help them. He said, \"the young generation behind me, for them I tell the story. It is for them! I want the next generation of whites to know and treat the Indian as themselves.\""

He was also noted for new methods in resuscitation.Henderson was a director of the Yale Laboratory of Applied Physiology at Yale University, a member of the National Academy of Sciences, chairman of the section of physiology and pathology of the American Medical Association.He was also a member of the American Philosophical Society. A collection of his papers are held at the National Library of Medicine in Bethesda, Maryland. Beyond his scientific contributions, Henderson acted as a leading advocate of public health, especially in his opposition to the use of tetraethyl lead in gasoline in the early 1920s. Though he did not succeed in preventing its commercialization, his warnings predicted the public health consequences that would result. Fifty years later, in 1973, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency issued regulations controlling the lead content of gasoline. He was a member of the Connecticut Academy of Arts and Sciences."

Sasa and approximately 20 PNG soldiers seized control of the main administrative compound in the Defence Force Headquarters, Murray Barracks located within the capital Port Moresby. The group, led by Sasa, also briefly captured the commander of the Papua New Guinea Defence Force, Brigadier General Francis Agwi and placed him under house arrest along with other higher-ranking officers. The mutiny was related to a dispute over the prime ministership between Sir Michael Somare and Peter O'Neill which had begun in December 2011 when the Supreme Court of Papua New Guinea ordered that Somare be reinstated as the prime minister while the county's parliament supported O'Neill. Sasa led the mutiny with the goal of reinstating Michael Somare as prime minister. Sasa was arrested and charged with mutiny on 28 January 2012. He was located in a Port Moresby suburb, and was reportedly taken into custody at a police station voluntarily. The charge against Sasa was struck out by the Committal Court on 1 August 2012 on the grounds that police prosecutors had not submitted any evidence to substantiate it."

After Korea was liberated from Japanese colonial rule in 1945, Lee \"led a student union that opposed a trusteeship, under which Korea would be governed by foreign powers after World War II, and entered politics in 1954 after winning a parliamentary seat.\" Lee and his two political rivals former President Kim Young-sam and former President Kim Dae-jung were famous for their political competition and the establishment and development of democracy in South Korea. He was given an honorable burial for his life contributions at the Seoul National Cemetery on March 2, 2016 where former South Korean presidents are also buried."

  "text" : "Yosvani Peraza Marín (Gordo) (born October 25, 1978 in Pinar del Río, Cuba) is a baseball catcher in the Cuban National Series and Cuba national baseball team. Peraza played for Cuba in the 1996 World Junior Baseball Championship, hitting .429 with 20 total bases in 21 at-bats and 8 RBI. He was second in average and probably first in slugging on the Gold Medal winners. Josh Bard beat him out for All-Star catcher honors in the event. Peraza also was in the 1997 Junior Pan American Games. In the 1997 World Junior Championship, he again led Cuba to Gold, hitting .500 and slugging .875 with 10 runs and 9 RBI in 5 round-robin games. He was named to the All-Star team at catcher this time. He debuted in the Cuban Serie Nacional in the 1997–1998 season. Peraza hit .333/.387/.544 for Pinar del Río in 2000-2001. In the 2001 World Port Tournament, he went 0 for 11 to tie Bárbaro Cañizares as Cuba's worst hitter. In the 2001–2002 season, Gordo batted .251/.326/.367. The next season, he hit .283/.338/.495 with 17 home runs and 58 RBI. In 2003-2004, the hefty catcher produced at a .301/.343/.487 clip with 16 homers and 67 runs batted in. He tied Loidel Chapellí and Osmani Urrutia for the league lead in RBI and was three homers behind leader Reinier Yero. Peraza batted .326/.389/.550 with 16 circuit clouts and 65 RBI in the 2004–2005 Serie Nacional. In 2005-2006, he hit .303/.422/.544 with 17 home runs and 54 RBI, tying for 8th in the Serie Nacional in homers. Peraza kept it up in 2006-2007, batting .322/.389/.533 with 17 home runs and 63 RBI. He tied Yohenis Cespedes for third in home runs, trailing Alexei Ramírez and Joan Carlos Pedroso. He finished 6th in total bases and 8th in RBI. He was just 2 for 20 in the playoffs, though. In the 2007 World Port Tournament, he was far better than he had been in the 2001 event, hitting .419/~.486/.710 with 3 home runs and 18 RBI in nine games. He tied Pedro Alvarez and Alfredo Despaigne for second in homers, one behind José Julio Ruiz. He easily led in RBI, 10 ahead of Despaigne. He tied Despaigne and Jordan Danks for second in hits (13), behind Carlos Tabares. He tied Danks for second in average, trailing Despaigne. He was also third in slugging and OBP. His dominant performance helped him win World Port Tournament Most Valuable Player honors. In the 2007 Baseball World Cup, Peraza backed up Ariel Pestano and got into three games. He was 2 for 7 with a long 3-run homer against Thailand as Cuba won Silver, its first time falling short of Gold in a Baseball World Cup in 25 years (and in 1982, it was because they sat out). Peraza continued his slugging into 2008. In the Cuban All-Star Game, he hit a walk-off homer against Jorge Longo in the bottom of the 9th to give his Occidentales a 6-5 win over the Orientales. He won MVP honors. Peraza hit .336/.465/.672 in the 2007–2008 season with 25 homers and 77 RBI in 79 games. He was 4th in the Serie Nacional in slugging and third in homers behind Alexei Bell and Yohenis Céspedes. He also ranked among the leaders in total bases (tied with Joan Carlos Pedroso for 9th with 180), RBI (5th) and walks (tied with Yoandy Garlobo for 8th with 60). His 37 intentional walks were 14 more than runner-up Garlobo as he led the circuit. Peraza was named to the Serie Nacional All-Star team at DH. Peraza backed up Michel Enríquez at DH for Cuba in the 2009 World Baseball Classic and batted cleanup twice. He was 4 for 9 with a homer and 3 runs in the event, putting him third on the Cuban squad in average, slugging, OBP and OPS behind Frederich Cepeda and Yoenis Céspedes. Peraza powered Cuba to a 5-4 win over Australia; pinch-hitting for Joan Carlos Pedroso with a 4-3 deficit, 2 outs and one on in the bottom of the 8th against Rich Thompson, Peraza smacked a game-winning 2-run homer. He got three hits in a win over Mexico but then came up empty in his third game, against Japan. Peraza hit .329/.462/.663 in 2008-2009 with 23 homers, tied for 5th in the league. He was 4th in slugging behind Alfredo Despaigne, Yulieski Gourriel and Joan Carlos Pedroso. He led with 24 intentional walks. Defensively, he was second with 11 passed balls but threw out 20 of 38 attempted base-stealers. A motorcycle injury ended his 2009–2010 season early."

  "text" : "Yuranigh (approx. 1820 – April 1850) was an Australian Indigenous guide and stockman. Yuranigh was born in New South Wales and died in New South Wales. Yuranigh accompanied Thomas Mitchell as an Aboriginal guide on his 1845–46 expedition to central Queensland. Mitchell wrote of him: \"...his intelligence and his judgment rendered him so necessary to me that he was ever at my elbow … Confidence in him was never misplaced. He well knew the character of all the white men in the party. Nothing escaped his penetrating eye and quick ear. Yuranigh was particularly clean in his person, frequently washing, and his glossy shining black hair, always well-combed, gave him an uncommonly clean and decent appearance.\" After the expedition, Yuranigh returned to Sydney with Mitchell before relocating to Boree, where he died and was buried by his people. There are four carved trees around the grave site, indicating that Yuranigh was a man of special honour. The trees are believed to be the highest remaining number of carved trees around a single grave."

Many people believe the language originated in Jiangyong County. She was the last person who could natively recognize, read, sing and write Nüshu, meaning that, after her death, only researchers have these skills. When she was young, Yang learned Nüshu together with Gao Yinxian, the eldest of the seven sworn sisters who were the most authoritative speakers and writers of the female-only language, for three years. Before Yang got married, she and Gao already had become close friends. They cultivated a true and deep friendship and often corresponded with each other by Nüshu. Yang attended the National Academic Research Seminar of Nüshu in 1991 and the World Conference on Women in Beijing in 1995. Her works about Nüshu have been collected by Zhao Liming, a professor of Tsinghua University and they were published in 2004. The Jiangyong County offered Yang’s living expenses and employed a maid to take care of her daily life with the purpose of rescuing and preserving Nüshu."
