  "text" : "'Said Abd al-Ahad Khan (26 March 1859 – 3 January 1911) was the 17th emir of the Manghit dynasty, the last ruling dynasty of the Emirate of Bukhara, which at the time was a part of the Russian Empire. He ascended to the title aged 26 upon the death of his father, Muzaffaruddin Bahadur Kkan, on 12 November 1885. He married and had one son, Mohammed Alim Khan, who succeeded him after his death. 'Abd al-Ahad was educated at a Russian military school, and obtained the rank of adjutant-general in the Russian army. He brought more Russian influence into Bakharan life. He made attempts at reforms, but was frustrated by conservatives and in his later years took to drinking."
