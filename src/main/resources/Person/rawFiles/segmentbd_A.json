  "text" : "Alfred Fryer (25 December 1826 Cambridgeshire - 26 February 1912 Chatteris, Cambridgeshire), was an English naturalist and authority on the pond weeds or Potamogetons. The Fryer family had lived in the Fenlands of the Chatteris district for more than 300 years; Alfred's father was a gentleman farmer of considerable means who placed few restrictions on his son. His first schooling was at Leicester where he met Henry Walter Bates and Alfred Russel Wallace. When Bates eventually left England for South America he tried to persuade Fryer, who had just lost his first wife, to do the same. In the 1840s Fryer's circle of London friends included the Rossetti family and Coventry Patmore, company which encouraged him to pursue his interest in poetry, while urging Dante Gabriel Rossetti to focus on poetry rather than painting. He returned to his native Fenlands in 1848 and began to devote his prodigious energy to science. At first his attention was taken up by insects, birds, shells and fossils, and it was only after 1860 that he became preoccupied with botany, corresponding with Cardale Babington, John Gilbert Baker and Arthur Bennett. His intimate knowledge of plants led to his considering a flora of Huntingdonshire, but his growing fascination with Potamogetons, or 'Pots' as he termed them, claimed priority. His circle of friends now reflected this single-mindedness - George Claridge Druce of Oxford, Charles Edward Moss of the Cambridge Botany School, Edward Walter Hunnybun (1848-1918)of Huntingdon and A. H. Evans, also corresponding with Thomas Morong (1827–1894), the American authority on the genus. During this period Fryer was growing Potamogetons in tanks placed in his garden, tracking their development together with that of their numerous wild counterparts. His prolific contributions to the Journal of Botany, British and Foreign led to his 1897 election as Associate to the Linnean Society. Until his death, Robert Morgan (1863-1900), also a Linnean Society Associate, illustrated Fryer's copious articles. Morgan's colour plates delighted Fryer and were praised by later critics. The standard author abbreviation Fryer is used to indicate this individual as the author when citing a botanical name."

He was classified as coloured by the apartheid government, but saw himself as an African and dismissed the coloureds' struggle to be seen as a distinct people. He worked as a teacher, but was a member of the ANC, and was sacked and jailed for two weeks in 1952 for his struggle against apartheid. In 1956 he was charged with high treason, and fled to Britain via East Africa and Ghana. His autobiography Road to Ghana (1960) is about this experience. In 1964 he published the play The Rain Killers."

Alessio was born in Naples, and was known to be active in 1710. He painted in the Palazzo Ruspoli and the Palazzo Albani in Rome. He was said to have been excellent at depictions of fires, and in attempting to paint one from nature, set up a damaging conflagration. For this, he apparently was sentenced to years as a galley slave, till he was pardoned under Pope Clement XI, for whom Alessio painted many canvases of perspective, landscape, and marinescapes. He was said to have been influenced by Salvatore Rosa and Claude Lorraine. His son was also a landscape artist."

  "text" : "Alena Arzamasskaia, sometimes called the Russian Joan of Arc, was a famed female rebel fighter in 17th-century Russia, posing as a man and fighting in Cossack Stepan Razin's revolt of 1670 in southern Russia. The daughter of a peasant from the Volga region, Alena was married while still a young girl to a local man who soon died. Essentially a child widow, she then became a nun at Nikolaevskii Monastery. However, she found life in the convent to be as unjust there as it was in the secular world and left in 1669. Upon leaving the convent, she cut her hair and dressed as a man. Pretending to be a Cossack rebel leader, she gathered together a regiment of men from the areas around her hometown. Soon she was leading six thousand fighters, unaware that their leader was a woman. Her company eventually captured the city of Temnikov and the local Cossacks selected her to be the leader. Her skill as an archer and in medicine (learned at the convent) made her popular and respected among the men. In 1670, the Russian Tsar launched a campaign to suppress the rebels and captured Arzamasskaia. She was tortured in an effort to get the identities of other rebels; however, she resisted and did not divulge any information. Later, she was convicted of brigandage for her role in taking over Temnikov, but her crime of dressing as a man carried a worse penalty. She was burned at the stake that same year, and witnesses reported that she did not make a single sound as she burned to death."

  "text" : "Anatoliy Kokush (Ukrainian: Анатолій Акимович Кокуш; born Kerch, Ukraine) is a Ukrainian film engineer, businessman, and inventor. In 2006, he was awarded two Oscars. The awards were in the Scientific and Engineering Award category: one was awarded \"for the concept and development of the Russian Arm gyro-stabilized camera crane and the Flight Head\"; the other was awarded \"for the concept and development of the Cascade series of motion picture cranes\". Kokush has also been recognized by Ukraine's then–First Lady Kateryna Yushchenko for his contributions to Ukrainian cinema and around the world. Kokush graduated from the Leningrad Institute of Film Engineers in 1974. He then started working for Dovzhenko Film Studios in Kiev. In the 1980s Kokush founded the Ukrainian film and television company Filmotechnic. He explained that the machine known as the \"Russian Arm\" is actually called Autorobot, and was given the nickname as a joke in the early nineties when Americans in Hollywood joked that \"the Russian Arm is back in America again\". His company, Filmotechnic, helped film such major Hollywood pictures, as Titanic, War of the Worlds, Casanova, and also the wuxia film Hero, many Russian blockbusters, as well as Ukrainian films. Other films include The Italian Job, Ocean's Twelve, King Arthur, Kingdom of Heaven, Bean: The Movie, Transformers, Iron Man 2, and many other huge box office hits."

  "text" : "Adrien de Pauger (died 9 June 1726) was the French engineer and cartographer who designed the streets of the Vieux Carre, today known as the \"French Quarter\", and drew the original map of the city that became New Orleans, Louisiana. De Pauger was appointed in 1720 by Jean-Baptiste Le Moyne de Bienville to draw up the plans for the new city. De Pauger arrived in the settlement on March 29, 1721. The plan was completed later in 1721, which was a significant step to establishing permanence in the French settlement. De Pauger also selected many of the street names such as Bourbon Street and Royal Street as well as others. This street plan is still in place today. Working with Bienville's chief engineer Le Blond de La Tour, they empressed slave labor to construct the settlement making use of water-resistant cypress wood for raised cottage construction. Slaves under de Pauger labored under the rules of Code Noir, which defined the conditions of slaves in the French Colonial Empire. Biloxi, Mississippi, was the original seaport near the mouth of the Mississippi River for the French colonies. De Pauger successfully lobbied Bienville to have the seat of government of these colonies moved from Biloxi to New Orleans. As a member of the \"superior council\" overseeing the Louisiana colonies at the time, De Pauger also pressed for establishing a deep water port at New Orleans, in addition to the one already in existence at Biloxi. De Pauger's belief was based on his survey of the mouth of the Mississippi River which showed that the mouth had regions sufficiently deep to allow passage of ships drawing fifteen feet of water. Only later would this deep water port at New Orleans be established, opening a major seaway for exports of the agricultural output from the middle of the Mississippi River Valley. Following the example of his project in New Orleans, de Pauger designed in 1725 the early settlement that became the city of Mobile, Alabama, including Fort Condé, the fort built to defend the new settlement. The 1724 plan for Saint Louis Parish Church, New Orleans, Louisiana, by Adrien de Pauger is shown at right. The church was built following his design and was dedicated on Christmas Eve in 1727. The Roman Catholic Church established a parish around the church that de Pauger designed, the parish beginning in 1720. The original church was subsequently destroyed by fire on 21 March 1788, part of the Great New Orleans Fire of 1788. Its replacement became the St. Louis Cathedral. De Pauger died on June 9, 1726. It is believed that he was buried in the not-yet-completed Saint Louis Parish Church by his request. Pauger Street in New Orleans is named in de Pauger's honor. This street originates in the old time suburb that is today known as Faubourg Marigny, with the street extending through the Bywater area before merging with Cameron Boulevard at Filmore Avenue in the Gentilly section of New Orleans. These neighborhoods are all near the original French Quarter."

He also has a Master in Economic Direction of Sports Entities. Malo played his entire Spanish career at UE Santboiana, starting aged 10 in 1975/76. He was promoted to the first category at 17 years old, in 1981. In 1990/91, he had his only season abroad when he played in the New Zealand team of Freyberg RC, after an invitation of Bruce Hemara, who latter would be his coach at UE Santboiana. He would play until 1999/2000, ending his career aged 36 years old. He always refused invitations to play in the much competitive French Championship.

The role of the Mysterious Woman appeared to be combined in some fashion with that of Mandy (portrayed by Julienne Davis), a prostitute with whom the Cruise character has a brief connection. The apparent doubling led to confusion and some controversy. Good also appeared as Tabatha in Randall's Flat cast as a forthright, manipulative woman with striking good looks, and another role as a \"mysterious blonde\" in the 2002 film Butterfly Man.

  "text" : "Alex Russell MC (4 June 1892 – 22 November 1961) was an Australian grazier, soldier, golfer and golf course architect. Russell was born at Geelong to grazier Philip Russell and Mary Gray, née Guthrie. He was sent to Glenalmond College in Scotland for his early schooling before returning to Australia, where he attended Geelong Grammar School, from which he graduated in 1911 having won distinction in both academic and sporting pursuits. He travelled to England in 1912 to study engineering at Cambridge University. He married Jess Lucy Fairbairn, daughter of Frederick Fairbairn, on 14 September 1917 at Chelsea. Commissioned in the Royal Garrison Artillery on 9 October 1914, Russell served on the Western Front during World War I, where he was twice wounded, won the Military Cross, and in 1918 was promoted acting major. After the war he and his wife returned to Australia and lived at Sandringham in Melbourne, close to the Royal Melbourne Golf Club. Both Russells became enthusiastic amateur players; Alex won the Australian Open in 1924, the Australian foursomes of 1924 and 1926, and the Victorian and South Australian championships in 1925, while Jess won the national ladies' foursomes in 1926 and 1927 and was runner-up in the 1927, 1930 and 1932 ladies' amateur championships. Russell helped to design the Black Rock west golf course (opened 1931) and supervised its construction; he also designed the eastern course, as well as courses at Karrinyup in Perth, Yarra Yarra in Melbourne, and Paraparaumu Beach, near Wellington in New Zealand. He was briefly private secretary to Prime Minister Stanley Bruce in the early 1920s. Russell and his wife moved in 1932 to Mawallok, his father's sheep station near Beaufort, and won prizes for his merino sheep; he would be President of the Australian Sheepbreeders' Association from 1950 to 1951.

  "text" : "Antonella Maria Ponce Cabrera (born August 4, 1997) is an Ecuadorian musician, singer, songwriter and actress. Very early in life she showed her love for music, and at the age of two she was already singing in tune with family choirs. She studied singing, dancing, and acting at Arte'n 3, an academy of artistic studies in Ecuador. While there, she worked with nationally and internationally known artists such as Riccardo Perotti, Gabriela Villalba ex- Kudai. Musician Ricardo Williams, who was looking for a female child's voice to sing with him, featured Ponce on his CD. She also performed with him during the concerts he held after the release of his book and CD, Canción de Cuna para despertar a Papá. Ponce made her television debut in 2005 on Teleamazonas, which held the exclusive franchise for Club Disney - Ecuador. She worked for almost 4 years as an actress and anchor for Club Disney, where she developed her passion for acting. Because of her discipline and talent, Ponce was considered the main presenter and actress on the show. In 2007 her musical education took another direction. She was given a test by the director of the Instituto de Música Contemporánea (IMC, Institute of Contemporary Music) of the Universidad San Francisco de Quito, part of the Berklee International Network associated with the Berklee College of Music. The test showed that Ponce had perfect pitch. She began to study at the IMC at the early age of ten, being one of the youngest students at the university. Ponce has performed among university students, impressing the audience with her quality and distinctive confidence. With these studies she developed a new sense for music, and she began to write her own music and lyrics. She has participated several times in the Intercollegiate Musical Festival at the Colegio Menor San Francisco de Quito, where three times she was the only musician singing her own songs. She plays the piano and the flute, and was a member of the Colegio Menor school band. She also taught herself to play the guitar. Ponce has written a variety of songs, with an innovative approach to music. Her abilities are not limited to any particular genre or style; her range allows her to perform jazz, pop, and rock."

From 1894 to 1899 he focused on physico-pathological studies of microbial poisoning at the Pasteur Institute in Paris. In 1899–1900 he served under Maurice Nicolle (1862–1932) as chief of anti-rabies services at the institute of microbiology in Constantinople. Afterwards he was associated with research done at the Pasteur Institute in Paris. Following the death of Emile Roux (1853–1933), he was appointed manager of anti-rabies services. Marie is known for his research involving the action of tetanus toxin on the nervous system, as well as studies of tuberculosis and rabies. In the 1910s he demonstrated that natural and synthetic suprarenin had the ability to neutralize diphtheria and tetanus toxins. His investigations of rabies led to the development of new vaccination processes. With Jean Cantacuzène (1863-1934), he published two articles on gastrointestinal cholera. In 1903 he was co-founder of the Bulletin de l'Institut Pasteur. In 1934, with Paul Remlinger (1871–1964), he was recipient of the \"Prix Dagnan-Bouveret\" by the Académie des sciences for work involving  rage expérimentale (experimental rabies). He died on 29 March 1935 in his laboratory at the Pasteur Institute."

  "text" : "Ambrosius Paul Speiser (13 November 1922, Basel - 10 May 2003 Aarau) was a Swiss engineer and scientist. He led the development of the first Swiss computer. Speiser studied electrotechnology at Eidgenössischen Technischen Hochschule (ETH), where in 1948 he earned his diplom in communications engineering. In 1949, Eduard Stiefel sent Heinz Rutishauser and Speiser to study in Harvard under Howard H. Aiken and in Princeton under John von Neumann; Rutishauser and Speiser became acquainted with the Harvard Mark III and the IAS machine. In 1950, the Institut für angewandte Mathematik (Institute for Applied Mathematics, founded in 1948) of ETH could acquire the Zuse Z4, but there were no other commercially available electronic computers which were suitable for scientific applications. This led the Swiss to the idea of developing their own computer. Under Speiser's technical direction between 1950 and 1955, Switzerland's first electronic calculating machine, ERMETH, originated. Speiser earned his doctorate and habilitation during the development of ERMETH, but began an industrial career when he joined IBM in 1955. From 1956 to 1966 he was the director of IBM Zurich Research Laboratory in Rüschlikon. In 1966 he left IBM to become the director of research for Brown, Boveri & Cie in order to develop the company's research center in Dättwil. In 1962 ETH made Speiser a full professor. For years, he taught one of the first courses in computer science at the ETH. In 1986 ETH honored him with an honorary doctorate for his pioneering work at the frontier of informatics. The Schweizerische Akademie der Technischen Wissenschaften chose Speiser on 1987 as president of its executive committee and upon his resignation in 1993 made him an honorary member. Speiser was also a member of the Schweizerischen Schulrats, member of the board of trustees of the Schweizerischer Nationalfonds, and from 1983 to 1988 president of Vororts (now Economiesuisse)."

  "text" : "Antonio Petito (22 June 1822 in Naples – 24 March 1876) was an Italian stage actor and playwright. He was a notable Pulcinella performer, and an important figure of Neapolitan theater in the 19th century. Petito was the son of another Pulcinella, Petito Salvatore and Donna Peppa. It was his father who initiated him with wearing a mask during a theatrical performance at the Teatro San Carlino in Naples. Petito first performed at the Teatro San Ferdinando in 1831. Petito was not only known for his acting facial expressions, but also for his work as a playwright despite being illiterate. Unable to write well, he used assistants, mostly commonly Giacomo Marulli. After his death, the San Carlino theater remained open for only a short time, having lost its most well known performer. Neapolitan Carousel is a 1954 Italian comedy film about Antonio \"Pulcinella\" Petito. In 1982, the RAI dedicated a seven-part television drama, Petito story, to him. He was the great grandfather of Enzo Petito, a character actor in Sergio Leone classic 1966 Spaghetti Western film The Good, the Bad and the Ugly."

  "text" : "Alexander Horn (or Dom Maurus Horn, OSB) (1762–1820), was a Scottish Benedictine monk who became a British secret agent and diplomat. His work contributed to the birth of the conspiracy theory of the illuminati. Horn was born in the village of Oyne, County of Aberdeen, in the Kingdom of Great Britain. In 1772, at the age of ten, he was accepted as an oblate by the Scots Monastery in Regensburg, Germany, an imperial abbey in the capital which was then the seat of the Imperial Diet of the Holy Roman Empire. About 1782, when he had come of age, he was admitted to the monastic community as a monk and given the religious name of Maurus and was ordained a Catholic priest around 1785. He was an esteemed librarian at the monastery by 1790, while at the same time working as the Regensburg agent for the British ambassador in Munich. He cultivated close ties with the Thurn und Taxis family and other influential people in the region. Despite being a monk, his social life led to him being described as a \"wild young fellow\". Horn wrote anonymously, condemning France's activities in undermining the Holy Roman Empire. He supplied the material that formed the core of John Robison's 1797 allegation of an international conspiracy of freemasons, illuminati, and Jacobins. In 1799 he travelled to England, meeting with members of William Pitt's government including Earl Spencer. He subsequently used his bibliographical expertise to acquire rare books and manuscripts for Spencer's library. When in 1802 the Eternal Diet of Regensburg, under pressure from Napoleon Bonaparte, determined to secularize all property of the Catholic Church within the Empire, the Scots Monastery was uniquely successful in avoiding this fate. Horn and his abbot, Charles Arbuthnot, OSB, (the last abbot of the monastery) lobbied Jacques MacDonald and Jacques Lauriston, Scottish Catholic generals in the French army. He was by now the official British agent in Regensburg and further appealed to the British government. The Scots Monastery was exempt from German church authorities coming under the sole authority of Holy See and the two monks successfully obtained the support of the Cardinal Protector of Scotland in Rome. An express exemption was made in favour of the Scots Abbey, although it was not allowed to take any new novices. In 1804 Horn became the official Chargé d'affaires following the expulsion of the British ambassador in Munich at the instance of Napoleon."

  "text" : "Arpad Haraszthy (Hungarian: Haraszthy Árpád; June 28, 1840, Futtak, Hungary – November 15, 1900, San Francisco, California) was a pioneer California winemaker best known as the creator of Eclipse champagne, the first commercially successful sparkling wine produced in the state. He was the first president of the California State Board of Viticultural Commissioners, one of the founding members and first officers of San Francisco's world-famous Bohemian Club, and a frequent and articulate writer on wine, winemaking, and viticulture. He has been criticized by some modern wine historians for his claims that his father, Agoston Haraszthy (often called \"The Father of California Viticulture\"), imported the first Zinfandel grape vines to California in the early 1850s. Zinfandel later became famous as California's best grape for the production of red table wine. Arpad Haraszthy's claims about his father's importations of Zinfandel have neither been proved nor disproved, and they remain a subject of controversy (see discussion below)."

  "text" : "Alidou Badini is a filmmaker from Burkina Faso who has worked on many films and TV productions. He co-directed the widely discussed Le Beurre et l'argent du beurre, which documents the realities of free trade. Badini has been cameraman or assistant director on various films for the cinema and TV, starting with Keïta! l'Héritage du griot (1994) directed by Dani Kouyaté.His short film Fleurs d'épines (Flowers of thorns) was nominated for a prize at the Panafrican Film and Television Festival of Ouagadougou in 2001. Badini was co-director of Le Beurre et l'argent du beurre, which explores the trade in shea butter made from the nuts of the shea tree, a source of cash to subsistence farmers in Burkina Faso. The almonds and the butter extracted from the nuts are used in cooking and body care.Although attempts have been made to apply \"fair trade\" principles, the film questions whether the villagers can in practice escape the implacable force of the market.Le Beurre et l'argent du beurre was shown at the Amiens International Film Festival.The film received the Jury Grand Prize at the International Environmental Film Festival of Niamey.It has been used as the basis for discussions by groups who support fair trade."

In 1874 he became a professor in the University of Vienna. In 1899 he was appointed head of the department of urology at the Allgemeine Poliklinik Wien (General Polyclinic - Vienna). Through Frisch's efforts, urology became recognized as an independent subject at the medical faculty in Vienna. In 1882 he first identified Klebsiella rhinoscleromatis, an organism that is the cause of rhinoscleroma. With urologist Otto Zuckerkandl (1861-1921), he was co-author of the three volume  Handbuch der Urologie (1904-06). Frisch married Marie Exner (1844-1925), the sister of physiologist Sigmund Exner (1846-1926). Ethologist Karl von Frisch (1886-1982) was his son."

  "text" : "Abdolreza Ghanbari (born c. 1968) is an Iranian university lecturer convicted of Moharebeh (waging war against God) currently awaiting execution in Iran. Ghanbari is lecturer at Payam e Nour University, and married father of two. In 2007, he was detained for 120 days and sentenced to a six-month suspension from teaching and exiled from Sari to Pakdasht. He was arrested at his home in Pakdasht (southwest of the capital of Tehran) on January 4, 2010 in the wake of Ashura (December 27, 2009) protest against the election of President Ahmadinejad. He was held at Evin Prison, and confessed under duress to charges. He was sentenced to death by Judge Salavati in branch 15 of the Islamic Revolutionary Court on the charge of “Moharebeh through ties with hostile groups [against] the regime”. Possession of suspicious e-mails and contact with one of the TV stations outside Iran were cited as reasons [to justify] the charges. His death sentence was confirmed by Tehran's Appeal Court, Branch 36 in April 2010. His Death sentence was commuted to imprisonment in September 2010 but this seems to have been overturned and a request for pardon of the death sentence was rejected on February 28, 2012 by the Commission of Justice in Tehran, clearing the way for authorities to proceed with his execution. Complicating his situation is the fact that his lawyer Nasrin Sotoudeh was herself condemned to a six-year sentence in Evin prison for \"propaganda against the regime\" and \"acting against national security\". Abdolreza Ghanbari’s wife and mother of two, Sakineh Habibi, is fighting his conviction and sentence and is quoted as saying: The fate of my husband is not important to anybody, because he is not a member of any political party or organization. He is on death row and no individual, political, or cultural institution is following up on his case, and no action is being taken to stop his death sentence. Even though nobody replies to our inquiries, I have no choice but to keep my hope alive and try to save the life of my husband and loving father for the sake of my children; for the sake of my ten year old daughter. I request from everyone to not allow a cultural activist and an unknown teacher be executed for the crime of being alone and not having anyone [of influence around]."

In 1891 he obtained his doctorate in Athens, continuing his education in Paris under Photinos Panas (1832-1903), Louis de Wecker (1832-1906) and Xavier Galezowski (1832-1907). In 1894 he founded an ophthalmology clinic at the \"Greek hospital\" in Constantinople, serving as director of this institute until 1922. From 1924 he worked as an ophthalmologist in Piraeus. In 1898 he was the first physician to study the iridocorneal angle in a living human. With Swiss ophthalmologist Johann Friedrich Horner (1831-1886), \"Horner-Trantas spots\" are named, which are defined as small white-yellow chalky concretions of the conjunctiva around the corneal limbus."

In 2011, Shaye was arrested, beaten, and held in solitary confinement for 34 days in Yemen. He was eventually tried and convicted of terrorism-related charges and sentenced to five years in prison, followed by two years of restricted movement and government surveillance. His conviction and sentencing was deeply unpopular with the Yemeni populace. On February 2, 2011, President Obama called then-Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh to discuss counterterrorism cooperation and Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. At the end of the call, according to a White House read-out, Obama “expressed concern” over the release of Shaye. Shaye had not been released at the time of the call, but Saleh did have a pardon prepared. Consequently, Shaye was not released until 2013. Shaye is related by marriage to the radical Islamic cleric Abdul Majid al Zindani and he has used this relationship and other connections to gain access to al-Qaeda leaders, including the late Yemeni-American Muslim cleric Anwar al-Awlaki. In 2013, Shaye won a coveted Alkarama Human Rights Defenders award in Geneva for his work in exposing the reality of the US-led drone war in his country."

  "text" : "Al-Rabī’ ibn Yūnus ibn ‘Abd Allāh ibn Abī Farwa (ca. 730 – 785/6) was a freedman who became one of the leading ministers of the early Abbasid Caliphate, serving under the caliphs al-Mansur (ruled 754–775), al-Mahdi (r. 775–785) and al-Hadi (r. 785–786). Al-Rabi’ was born to a slave woman near Medina about 730 CE. His father Yunus, the scion of a well-to-do family, denied his paternity, and the infant was sent to another family and eventually to an estate in the desert where he was reduced to menial labour. He was however bought by Ziyad ibn Abd Allah al-Harithi, the governor of Medina, who in turn presented him as a gift to al-Saffah, the first Abbasid caliph. Noted by al-Mansur for his literary education and especially his ability in Arabic poetry, he rose to prominence within the Abbasid court, culminating in his appointment as hadjib (chamberlain) and eventually wazir. He is often mentioned in the histories as a powerful figure, controlling access to the Caliph, and a capable administrator. He supervised the construction of Karkh, the commercial extramural suburb of Baghdad, as well as the so-called Palace of Eternity (Qasr al-Khuld), where the Caliphs preferred to stay. Al-Rabi' even received from al-Mansur one quarter of the new city as a grant and named after him (kati’at al-Rabi’). He was instrumental in ensuring the smooth succession of al-Mahdi, but he was replaced as wazir by Abu Ubayd Allah, and returned to his post as hadjib, which had in the meantime been held by his son al-Fadl ibn al-Rabi'. When Abu Ubayd Allah insulted him during a visit, al-Rabi’ brought about the former's downfall in 779/780, by accusing and proving his son to be a non-believer. He did not return to the post of wazir, however, until the reign of al-Hadi, when for a short while he was wazir, hadjib and head of the chancery. Soon after however he was replaced and kept only the direction of the diwan al-azimma (the budget department). He died in early 785 or early 786. His son al-Fadl occupied a similarly influential position in the court of Harun al-Rashid (r. 786–809) after him."

He painted mainly Genre subjects in a fashion after Giuseppe Maria Crespi. He was a pupil in Bologna of Felice Torelli, and he may also have studied with Giuseppe Carlo Pedretti. Beccadelli's documented work consists of two commissions (1763) executed for the Boschi family in Bologna, depicting Charity of the Capuchin Brothers, Interior with Table, and the Country Dance, in which the landscapes were completed by Carlo Lodi. In 1763–4 Beccadelli painted the figures in five decorative overdoors representing landscapes, again in collaboration with Lodi, for the Villa Boschi, Bologna. In 1745 he became a member of the Accademia Clementina, and became its principe in 1757. Late in life, he served on commissions investigating works of art looted during the Napoleonic occupation of the city. He became an art merchant late in life."

  "text" : "Masini’s career as an advice columnist began in 2003, when she was asked to teach a dating class for men in Los Angeles. After self-publishing two books, Date Out of Your League (2003) and Think & Date Like A Man (2005), Masini then went on to establish a presence on the Web as an expert on dating and relationships. More than 26,000 questions have been asked and answered on her website. April Masini has won a following as an expert on dating and relationships who supports traditional gender roles and argues that the feminist movement damaged relationships in America. Commenting on reality TV, she has said: \"The new man that women are looking for is rugged and fearless – and reality TV has capitalized and is bringing women 'the new firemen': men who go into swamps and catch big fish with their bare hands, mano a mano.\" When asked about celebrity marriages, she has said: \"Generally speaking, I think it's very difficult to have two stars in a family competing for the spotlight. There are obviously cases where it seems to work well — like Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt — but I think the reason their relationship works so well is that their primary focus is on their kids. And they're both mega-stars.\" In most cases, however, \"It's too difficult to have two people in the same line of work fighting for attention and recognition.\" As an advice columnist, Masini is supportive of relationships between deployed American troops and the relationships and families they leave behind when overseas or in training and away from home. She advises military spouses with young children: \"Keep a scrapbook of everything that goes on with you and the children while he’s gone, so that you can cuddle up with him when he returns and go over each page.\" Numerous questions from those connected to the military have been answered on her forum. Masini has conservative political views and has been consulted on a range of political issues. When asked how conservatives should respond to the 2012 Supreme Court decision upholding President Obama’s health care legislation, where Chief Justice John Roberts sided with the majority, she commented: \"If you're considering a Democratic ticket in the November election as a way to show Roberts that nobody messes with you and walks away unscathed, reconsider,\" she said. \"It backfires, and while you may feel good about being an ass — I mean, donkey — you'll ultimately be betraying yourself.\" Masini advises dating within your own political party: \"You can cross party lines, but don't you think you'll be happier with someone who sees things the way you do when it comes to issues like the death penalty, gun control and abortion?\" She argues that opposites may attract in the short term, but not for going the distance: “Typically, an ‘oil and water’ combo proves to be more than most can handle.” When ABC News asked her in 2007 about Arnold Schwarzenegger and Maria Shriver, she responded, \"There are exceptions. They're not the sort of couple you see every day.\" April Masini has offered “celebrity love lessons” on MSN, where she suggested the advantages of the low-key approach taken by Maggie Gyllenhaal and Peter Sarsgaard. The Daily News has reported her comments on why celebrity men such as Ashton Kutcher and Brad Pitt are suddenly dating Hollywood’s single moms.And ABC News has sought her matchmaking advice for rapper Eminem (former beauty queen Shanna Moakler) and Jennifer Aniston (alternatively, John Cusack, Quentin Tarantino, or Jake Gyllenhaal.) US News & World Report made April Masini their primary source in their “Tipping Bible” (Your Ultimate Tipping Guide). She has been quoted on tipping etiquette in The Los Angeles Times (Advice on Tipping While Traveling Abroad) and interviewed by The Wall Street Journal (10 People You’re Not Tipping Enough), Yahoo! Finance and Marketwatch, as well as the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette (Tipping is a way of life in U.S., but how much is right?) for tipping etiquette pieces as well. Known as “the new millennium’s Dear Abby,” Masini has appeared as a featured guest on the The O'Reilly Factor, as a panelist on Ricki Lake, and as host of Everything You Need to Know About Sex. She serves on a sex panel at Women's Health. In 2007, Old Spice hired her as the Dating and Relationship Editor for its “Voice of Experience” campaign, announcing that “Nationally recognized relationship expert and author April Masini––featured everywhere from Maxim to The New York Times––will give the female perspective on what guys need to have a dating streak to be envied.” April Masini offers advice to people of different ages, ethnicities, and sexual orientations. Her advice for women on relationships, marriage, and sex has appeared in Glamour, Ebony, Cosmopolitan,Women’s Day, SheKnows.com, and Brides. Her advice for men has appeared in Men’s Health. She has been consulted on financial issues in dating and marriage by Main Street and The Street. Masini has weighed in texting, sexting, and the impact of the digital age on relationships; and she has been interviewed on a range of parenting issues, including the hidden costs of parenthood. Although the focus of her forum is dating and relationships, she has been called on by the media for her opinion on a range of issues, including real estate transactions (BBC News), the relationships of sports teams with their fans (New York Times), television and movies (USA Today), the selling of beer and wine by Starbucks (The Christian Science Monitor), and proper etiquette in changing a baby's diaper on a plane (Los Angeles Times), along with every imaginable dating and relationship question or opinion. Her comments have been sought by Medill Reports-Chicago, a publication of Northwestern University’s journalism school, for an article on racism; and she has been interviewed on the subject of college athletic recruiting. April Masini's work as a columnist has appeared in AskMen.com, Yahoo! Personals, North Dallas Gazette, Florida Weekly, Balance Magazine, BlackStudents.com, Chill Magazine, and èBella Magazine, where her column has been running monthly since 2008. She has been interviewed for articles in (among others) The New York Times, USA Today, Forbes, the Christian Science Monitor, The Huffington Post, New York Daily News, Today, Elle Canada, the Chicago Sun-Times, Fox News, ABC News, and Telemundo, and she is a regular contributor to MSN,Men's Health Magazine, Happen Magazine, and Univision. Prior to her career as an advice columnist, April Masini worked—first with her former husband, Al Masini, and then independently—on a number of projects that led to the expansion of the television and film industry in Hawaii. The Masinis produced and organized the 1998 Miss Universe Pageant, successfully lobbying the Hawaii legislature for $3.3 million to fund the event, which brought delegations from 85 countries to Hawaii, each with its own news media. Al Masini was the pageant’s producer for Hawaii, while April Masini served as co-chair and event coordinator, both working for nearly a year without pay. In 1998, Hawaii Governor Ben Cayetano acknowledged the couple’s contribution to the state by proclaiming June 4th of that year “Al and April Masini Day.” In 1999, April Masini persuaded Greg Bonann, executive producer of Baywatch, to move the television show to Hawaii for three years, instead of the proposed move to Australia. Masini reached out to the governor and legislators of Hawaii, who then advocated for the move; and she was “relentless in her pursuit” of the Baywatch producers, who “eventually gave in and added ‘Hawaii’ to the show’s name.” Coming at a time of economic downturn, the move paved the way in 2001 for Hawaii’s Act 221, designed to develop the state’s high-technology industry through the use of tax incentives. In 1999, production costs in Hawaii were significantly higher than in Australia, with its favorable tax codes. To lure Baywatch, Hawaii offered the show’s producers an incentives package that included $2 million in soundstage and shoreside facilities improvements. To make the Hawaii production affordable, the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees agreed to 12–15 percent wage cuts, while Governor Ben Cayetano cut a deal with the Teamsters Local 399 in Los Angeles to improve wages and working conditions for the drivers. According to Bonann, Baywatch Hawaii was \"one of the reasons\" prompting Hawaii to adopt Act 221. The show brought more than $30 million to the state's economy, with local actors appearing in lead roles, local musical talent contributing to every episode, and local professionals making up 80 percent of the crew. In 2001, Ms. Magazine criticized April Masini for her involvement with Baywatch. In 1999, April Masini helped the highly rated cable show, Pacific Blue, film a two-part episode in Hawaii by contacting executive producer Bill Nuss, “who was vacationing in Kona, and talking him into bringing the show here at least for a couple of episodes,” according to Nuss. Filmed primarily in and around Waikiki, the episodes were Pacific Blue’s first-ever filming outside California. In bringing the show to Hawaii, Nuss hoped to prove that a cable or network series could afford to film in the state. Also in 1999, April Masini was a producer on Destination Stardom. In 2002, April Masini was the first to use Hawaii's newly passed Act 221, designed to develop the state’s technology industry. In August 2002, right after the bill was signed, she brought the tax incentives to the attention of Universal Studios for the financing of Surf Girls, according to Joe Blanco, technology advisor to Hawaii Governor Ben Cayetano. Through Act 221, she then raised approximately $16 million in financing for the film, which was renamed Blue Crush. Based on a magazine article entitled \"Surf Girls of Maui,\" by Susan Orlean, Blue Crush was praised by Slate.com’s Greg Milner as “a sharp depiction—both in its details and its symbolism—of life in Hawaii” and as a film that “makes surfing feel like real life,” Los Angeles-based entertainment attorney John LaViolette of Bloom Hergott Deimer and Cook, which represents Hollywood A-list actors like Arnold Schwarzenegger and Sylvester, commented: “This is the first time that I have heard of a studio making a commitment to foster a mutually beneficial cross promotion between the film and the location where it's been shot.” LaViolette worked in conjunction with producers April Masini and Adam Fields, who advised the State of Hawaii during the negotiation. The resulting agreement formed a relationship between Universal Studios and the Hawaii Visitors and Convention Bureau, by which Universal Studios agreed to promote the state along with the movie in exchange for funding. Blue Crush was eligible for Act 221 funding because the state law included performing arts within its definition of qualified high-tech businesses. As the top 2001 top beneficiary of the tax credit program, the film came under fire from critics such as David Watumull, president and CEO of Hawaii Biotech. Watumull argued that the law had not “contemplated the dollar amounts that are going into movies, which are then taking those dollars away from high-tech and biotech companies,\" adding, \"I'm also not sure that the law contemplated the short-term nature of movie projects.\" However, Masini’s efforts to bring film and television to Hawaii, along with the marketing, promotional, and tourism dollars they offer, continued to pay off years after the productions had left. In 2004, for example, Blue Crush was featured in a U.S. Department of Commerce marketing campaign to lure British travelers to America. Hawaii’s contribution to the campaign, seen on the walls of the London underground and on street billboards, was an image from Blue Crush of a surfer catching a wave. In October 2002, April Masini brought a malpractice and fraud complaint against Cades Schutte, one of Hawaii’s oldest and largest law firms, and Cades Schutte partner Vito Galati, claiming the firm had conspired to limit her profits in the Blue Crush deal."

  "text" : "Ann Kitchen is the District 5 City Councilmember for Austin, Texas. Ann Kitchen was elected to the Texas State House of Representatives, District 48, in the election of 2000. She was defeated for reelection in 2002 by Republican Todd Baxter. Prior to her election to the State Legislature, Kitchen was an attorney, and later managed the health care regulatory group of Price Waterhouse Coopers. She also served as a policy adviser to the Texas Health and Human Services Commission. She began her career in the Texas Attorney General's consumer protection division. In the legislature, she is best remembered for her contributions to House Bill 1156, which expanded women's access to health care, and Senate Bill 11, the Medical Records Privacy Act. After leaving the legislature, Ann Kitchen was Executive Director of the Indigent Care Collaboration (ICC) a regional collaboration of public and private hospitals, clinics, MHMR, public health departments, university medical departments, and medical society responsible for providing care for uninsured individuals. Kitchen is married to Mark Yznaga, a lobbyist with the City of Austin. Ann Kitchen is currently Vice Chair of the City of Austin Charter Revision Committee and is City Councilmember for District 5. Kitchen was elected to Austin City Council District 5 on November 4, 2014. She garnered 54% of the vote in a field of seven candidates and avoided a runoff election. In 2015, Kitchen proposed regulations on ridesharing companies such as Uber and Lyft. These regulations were presented as necessary for public safety, such as a requirement for fingerprinting rideshare drivers. Opponents claimed that the regulations included a gross receipts tax, rules on fares, and other regulations that threatened to drive those companies out of Austin. On May 9, Kitchen's proposed regulations went into effect after a ballot proposition altering them was defeated by a special election, causing Uber and Lyft to leave Austin."

As a son of Otto, he was entitled to use the title of Margrave and he did sign some official documents, be he was never more than a co-ruler. The real power was wielded by his cousin Otto IV \"with the arrow\". Albert III administered the Lordship of Stargard, which Brandenburg had acquired from Pomerania in 1236. Albert III was from 1284 the sole ruler of Stargard and Lychen. After his sons Otto and John died (around 1299), Albert III sold Stargard to his son-in-law Henry II of Mecklenburg. The 1304 Treaty of Vietmannsdorf confirmed Henry II as Lord a Stargard and enshrined that it was held as a fief from Brandenburg. In 1299, a year before his death, he founded the Cistercian monastery Coeli Porta (\"Gate to Heaven\") in Lychen. Albert III died on 3 December 1300 and was initially buried at Lehnin Abbey. In 1309, his body was transferred to the Coeli Porta monastery. It was subsequently lost."

In 2007, he co-founded Aviary, a company that built an award-winning multimedia application suite of creative web apps, with Israel Derdik and Michael Galpert. As CEO, he raised $17 million in venture capital from Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, MIT Media Lab Director Joi Ito, LinkedIn founder Reid Hoffman, venture capital firm Spark Capital, and other notable investors. In September 2011, citing stalling growth of the multimedia application suite, he shifted Aviary's business strategy to powering the photo-editing in third-party apps on web and mobile smart phones. Seeing enormous immediate growth, he chose to focus the company exclusively around this new direction and closed down Aviary's consumer-facing multimedia application suite, one year later on September 15, 2012. As of March 2013, Aviary announced passing 35 million monthly active users, 3,500 partners and 3 billion photos edited across its partner network. Muchnick served as CEO until December 2012, when he brought on former Walmart executive Tobias Peggs to take over, at which point he stepped into the Chief Product Officer role. On September 22, 2014, Aviary was acquired by Adobe Systems. Muchnick was named one of the Top 35 Innovators Under 35 by MIT's Technology Review magazine in 2010."

She is sponsored by Virgin Trains and also has a train named after her based on her achievements and potential to be a future Olympian. She competes for the Sale Harriers, the same club as former Great Britain athletes Diane Modahl and Darren Campbell. Irozuru began participating in athletics as a 14-year-old after she excelled at a youth athletics match by winning the 100 m, 200 m, 4 × 100 m and the long jump. This led to an invitation by Ian Wiltshire to start training at the City of Manchester Stadium before its conversion to a full football stadium. Her talent quickly shone through and in 2006 Irozuru won Silver at both the English Schools Championships and British Schools Championships competing against highly accomplished young jumpers. After establishing herself as an elite junior athlete, Irozuru moved to London to study for a law degree at University College London where she firstly worked with UK Athletics head long and triple jumps coach John Herbert who also coached Jade Johnson to the 2008 Summer Olympics. Her current coach is Larry Achike who helped her achieve 2012 National Indoor Long Jump Silver and Gold in her first senior international in Bratislava. On Saturday 9 June 2012 at the Georgi Pavlov International Athletics Meeting in Sofia, Bulgaria Irozuru jumped 6.80m in the sixth round, setting a new personal best and meeting the Olympic A Qualifying distance for the 2012 Summer Olympic Games. On the 24 June 2012 at the Aviva Olympic Trials & UK Championships in Birmingham she was disappointed to jump 6.48 which meant she had to compete at the 2012 European Athletics Championships in Helsinki, Finland. Irozuru has retired due to leg injuries."

In the same year, he finished second in the 40 km event of the Italian men's championships of cross-country skiing. A photograph showing Viviani during his participation at the Giro delle Dolomiti in Cortina d'Ampezzo demonstrates that he served in the IV Legione / Milizia Forestale in Turin in 1940. The Milizia Forestale was an arm of the Blackshirts devoted to forestry. Together with three friends, he founded the central school for excursion cross-country skiing (Italian: Scuola Centrale Sci Fondo Escursionistico) of the Club Alpino Italiano. At the age of 92 years, and 30 years after his success, he spoke at the press conference of the 16th Trofeo Mezzalama in April 2007."

Kolchynskiy took up wrestling in 1966, and in 1974 was included to the Soviet national team after winning his first Soviet title. He won five more national championships in a row in 1976–80 and would be a favorite at the 1984 Olympics, but those games were boycotted by the Soviet Union. Kolchynsky retired in the mid-1980s, and opened a small sewing shop together with his wife. Later he became involved with Ukrainian organized crime and in 1994 was sentenced to seven years of prison for extortion. He was paroled in 1996 and became a wrestling coach for teenagers. He died of a heart attack in 2002, aged 47. Earlier in 1998, an annual Greco-Roman wrestling tournament in his honor has been launched in his native city of Kyiv."

  "text" : "Alfred-Arthur Brunel de Neuville (1852 - 1941) was a French painter. Having received a somewhat basic training from his father, he became famous in his twenties and thirties as a leading animal artist of the Paris school focussing on domestic cats and then later on still life subjects, such as fruit and flowers. He exhibited work at the Societe des Artistes Francais from 1879 and was elected a member in 1907. Throughout his life Brunel de Neuville worked hard to improve his skills and later paintings are both more complex and intricate than earlier works. Both dogs and cats became popular as the subjects of a sentimental/realist genre at which de Neuville excelled. His trademark painting is a group of mischievous kittens playing with a ball of wool or other domestic object. Although the style is broadly realist, some of the cat paintings are just a touch impressionistic in tone. Certainly the cats are not depicted as a natural subject in a strict realist way. Many of his still lifes have a charming French bucolic feel. Brunel de Neuville was highly popular during his lifetime, but since his death popularity has waxed and waned. Certainly lovers of modern art will abhor the sentimentality of the genre. In terms of value his work fetches more in North America than in Europe. European auction prices are between €2,500 and €5,000, but in the USA prices can go over $10,000. One of his best and largest canvasses is on sale in a gallery Buenos Aires at $20,000. Brunel de Neuville died in 1941 and is buried in Montmartre Cemetery in Paris. His works can be seen in museums at Béziers, Brest, Chateau Thierry, Louviers."

  "text" : "Anne Elder (4 January 1918 – 23 October 1976) was an Australian ballet dancer and poet. Born Anne Josephine Chloe Mackintosh in Auckland, New Zealand in 1918, she moved to Melbourne with her parents in 1921. Inspired by Anna Pavlova, she commenced ballet lessons with Laurel Martyn in the 1930s, and went on to have an impressive career dancing with Colonel de Basil's Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo, the Australian Ballet Company, and the Borovansky Ballet Company for whom she was a soloist (1940–1944). In 1940 she married John Stanley Elder, a solicitor serving in the 2nd/8th Field Regiment, Australian Imperial Force. They had two children, a son and a daughter, born in 1945 and 1947. Elder was troubled by illness throughout her life, and perhaps as a result, \"turned her creative energies to painting, poetry-writing, gardening and her house, which she filled with light and beauty\". In the mid-1960s, encouraged by Bruce Dawe and Philip Martin she began to publish poetry regularly in newspapers and periodicals, including the Australian, Meanjin, Quadrant, Overland and Southern Review. Her first collection of Poems, For the Record, was published in 1972. After having a heart attack in 1968, her health and spirits declined. She died of cardiopulmonary disease complicating scleroderma on 23 October 1976 in Royal Melbourne Hospital and was cremated. A second collection of her poetry, Crazy Woman, was published posthumously in 1976, and was highly commended in the National Book Council awards for 1977. In 1976, her husband John Elder established The Anne Elder Trust Fund Award for poetry, presented annually to the best first book of poetry published in Australia. The award is administered by the Victorian Branch of the Fellowship of Australian Writers. A commemorative volume of her poetry, Small Clay Birds, was published by Monash University in 1988."

  "text" : "Alisdair Hogarth (born 14 October 1980) is a British-born classical pianist, best known for his creation and direction of the vocal ensemble, The Prince Consort, which focuses on piano-accompanied song. He also has a strong background in solo playing and made his concerto debut in 1996, at the age of fifteen, as soloist with the London Philharmonic Orchestra at the Queen Elizabeth Hall broadcast live on Classic FM. He has since performed many concertos with a variety of orchestras, including tours of Hungary and the Czech Republic (Rudolfinum). He regularly broadcasts for BBC television, BBC Radio 3 and World Service, Classic FM and New Zealand Concert FM. After studying music at Cambridge, he went on to claim all major piano prizes at the Royal College of Music in London, where he founded The Prince Consort, named after the road where the College resides. He has commissioned pieces from Ned Rorem and Stephen Hough. He gave the world-premiere of Ned Rorem's Evidence of Things Unseen at Oxford Lieder Festival in October 2009. He then gave world premieres of Stephen Hough's song cycles, Herbstlieder and Other Love Songs (a piano-duet performance with Stephen Hough) at Oxford Lieder Festival and Wigmore Hall in 2010 and 2011, respectively. Recordings of these pieces are available performed by The Prince Consort, joined by Stephen Hough and Philip Fowke, under the award-winning label, Linn Records. Hogarth has recently commissioned leading jazz pianist, Jason Rebello, to collaborate with The Prince Consort on a series of Schubert reharmonizations and a total reharmonization of Schumann's Dichterliebe song cycle. Hogarth has performed with Barbara Bonney and Thomas Allen. He is a regular accompanist to many emerging young artists, such as Jacques Imbrailo, Anna Leese, Jennifer Johnston, Tim Mead, Andrew Staples, and Elisabeth Meister. In commercial spheres, he has worked with Katherine Jenkins, Blake, Lesley Garrett, All Angels, Amici Forever, and X-Factor winner Joe McElderry. He has appeared and performed onscreen in the films The Duchess and The Young Victoria."

In his spare time he also studied Russian history and in 1934 won a scholarship to study in Moscow and Leningrad. After these studies he attended the Agricultural College in Avon Croft, Evesham, Worcestershire. On 19 June 1936, he joined Lincolnshire Constabulary. He was employed in various departments, but later specialised in traffic. He rose to the rank of sergeant. After the Second World War, he founded the International Police Association to be a global police friends club. He believed in the positive qualities of friendship, which is why the motto of the association is \"Serve through friendship\", also rendered \"Servo per Amikeco\" in Esperanto."

Ada Jane Low was born in Bexley, Kent, England, and arrived in New South Wales as a two-year-old in 1857. She was accompanied by her parents, William and Emily Jane Low, and siblings, Edward and Alice, as an \"assisted immigrant\" on the ship Light of the Age. Two further siblings, Adelaide and Agnes, were born in New South Wales in the years that followed the family's arrival and settling in Bathurst. Low and Watson were wed in 1889, shortly before he was elected to the New South Wales Trades and Labour Council. She was not involved in her husband's political career, except to support his decision to resign as Labor leader in 1907. She may also have been influential in her husband's later estrangement from the Australian Labor Party. Owing partly to her husband's brief term as Prime Minister, Ada Watson is possibly the least well-known of prime ministerial spouses in Australia. No photograph of her has ever been found."

  "text" : "Alexander Borovsky (Borowsky) (1889-1968), a Russian-American pianist, was born in Mitau, Russia. His first piano teacher was his mother, a pupil of V. Safonoff, the great Russian pianist. He completed his studies at the St. Petersburg Conservatory in 1912 with a gold medal and the Anton Rubinstein Prize, He created great attention in the 1912 Anton Rubinstein competition which he won. He received a degree in law from St. Peterburg University alongside his music studies. Alexander Borovsky taught master-classes at the Moscow Conservatory from 1915 to 1920. The May 11, 1916 Musical Courier writes from Moscow newspaper of March 1915, \"Alexander Borowski is a pupil of Anna Essipova. He is a pianist of great skill, power and alluring charm, with strong rhythm and well modulated dynamics. Mr. Borowski respects the composer's design and has the gift of bringing the spirit of it. Scriabine's Tenth Sonata (the last composed), a most difficult work of account of its complexity and theosophical spirit, was performed by Borowski at his recital with rarely deep analysis, glowing with fire progressively in a climax.\" \"Occasionally, in the midst of scores of concerts, most of which are only of mediocre quality, we are reminded of the adage that while, \"many are called, few are chosen.\" \"One of the chosen, musically speaking of course, is the Russian pianist, Alexander Borowsky, who is certainly a rising star in the tonal heavens. One must hear him play Bach in order to admire his precision, clear articulation, dynamics and colorful shading. But not only does he excel in the classics, but he seems also to be a born interpreter of modern music, especially of the young Russian school. His success here was a genuine one.\" After winning fame here as a pianist of widely diversified programs, Borovsky returned to Europe where, in 1937, he first devoted himself almost exclusively to presenting the works of Johann Sebastian Bach. At the outbreak of the war, Mr. Borovsky first went to South America, where he continued his Bach cycles—the first such recitals ever to be presented in many of the Latin-American capitals—and where he earned fresh laurels. He gave live Bach evenings in Buenos Aires, with marked acclaim, and, as a result, was invited to repeat his performances under the auspices of the Cutura Artistica of São Paulo, in Brazil. Mr. Borovsky now brings his Bach programs to the United States. Decided to leave Russia after the October Revolution he started touring in Europe and eventually made his American debut in Carnegie Hall in 1923. He became a US national in 1941 and a professor at the Boston University in 1956. He was a soloist with all the major orchestras in Europe and North and South America, appearing as soloist in more than 30 concerts with the Boston Symphony Orchestra under the late Serge Koussevitzky. At the same time he began to record some of the significant works of Bach and Liszt and he was the first artist to record Bach's 30 Inventions and all of Liszt's Hungarian Rhapsodies.Mr. Borovsky's work was distinguished by his objective interpretation of classical and romantic music. His playing of Bach, critics said, was notable for its architectural quality. Mme. Scriabin's writes in Musical Courier, October 18, 1917, page 27 \"I also propose the name of Alexandre Borowsky, a young professor of the Conservatory of Moscow, who plays almost all the works of Scriabine, and who has already acquired a great reputation as a pianist in Russia. Mr. Borowsky is a member of the Scriabine Society.\"\"Addresses on various aspects of Scriabin's art have been given by MM. Braudo, Makovsky, and Bryanchanimov, and the performance of the later works and also of some posthumous pieces has been in the hands of Borovsky's pianoforte music. Borovsky's position is the more honourable since no Russian recital programme is complete without Scriabin's name, and this artist has therefore no rivals.\" In 1923 Borowski writes in \"Modern Masters of the Keyboard,\" by Harriette Brower, \"Yes I have a very large repertoire and am constantly adding to it. While I was in South America I gave many concerts in various cities. In Buenos Aires I gave twelve entirely different programs in ten weeks. I play much Russian music, of course--Scriabine, Prokofieff and many others. But I play the music of all countries and all epochs. American music and MacDowell. Very little American music is known in Russia, I think. As for MacDowell, of course we know him by name, and a few of the more brilliant numbers, such as the Hexen Tanz, Polonaise and Concerto for piano, but not the Sonatas. I should like to do one or more of these, and also some works by other American composers. Now that I have been in America, the musical growth of your country interests me immensely. I have had a happy two months here, and I hope to return for a longer stay. But now, after our two happy months, Madame and I are on the point of returning to Europe, as I have a tour of forty concerts on the other side, which will take me to London, Paris, Spain, Italy, Belgium, Holland and Germany. But all the time I shall look forward to my return to your beautiful country--America!\" The following Welte-Mignon piano rolls were probably recorded in Russia by Borowski in 1910 at Moscow and St. Petersburg: #2029 Tchaikovswsky: Sonata, Op 27, in G, Movement 1, #2030 Rachmaninoff's Elegie, fr \"Morceaux de fantasie\", Op 3 No 1 in E-flat minor (January, 1910), #2031 Arensky: Etude, fr. 24 Morceaux caracteristiques, Op 36 no 13 in F-sharp, #2032: Liadow: Barcarolle, Op 44 in F-sharp, #2033 Rachmaninoff: Prelude, Op 23 No 3 in D minor (January 1910)."

  "text" : "Anthony John Bevins (16 August 1942 – 23 March 2001) was an English journalist, sometimes known as Tony Bevins. He grew up in Toxteth, Liverpool, and was the son of a minister in Harold Macmillan's cabinet, Reggie Bevins. Anthony Bevins was educated at the Liverpool Collegiate School and the London School of Economics. During a year in Bengal, teaching for the Voluntary Service Overseas (VSO), he met his wife, Mishtuni Roy, known as Mishtu; they married in a Bengal temple in 1965. Bevins started at the Liverpool Post in 1967, moved to London as its lobby correspondent in 1970, and then joined the political staff of the Sunday Express in 1973. Later that year he became The Sun's political correspondent. He moved to the Daily Mail in 1976. In 1981 he became chief political correspondent of The Times, but the Wapping dispute, over Rupert Murdoch's move of the paper's staff to Wapping, ended this period of his career. Bevins stood in the final union chapel meeting and told his colleagues, \"I will go to Wapping with ashes in my mouth\". Bevins joined The Independent before its launch in 1986, and was the newspaper's first political editor. Significantly, his newspaper opposed the anonymous lobby system, preferring to find their own sources, a policy Bevins fully supported. This innovation was short-lived, but did lead to such briefings being attributed.

He obtained his doctorate from the University of Munich in 1891 after completing his medical studies at several German universities. As a young man he worked as an assistant at Adolf Aron Baginsky's Kaiser-und-Kaiserin-Kinderkrankenhaus in Berlin. In 1897 at Dresden, he founded a private Säuglingsheim (home for babies), a hospital devoted entirely for in-patient treatment of sick infants. This institution was considered to be the first of its kind anywhere. Here, Schlossmann worked at improving care for infants, that included an environment adhering to strict asepsis, systematic training of pediatric nurses and testing that involved his personal ideas on natural diet. In 1898, he received his habilitation at the Institut für Physiologische Chemie in the Technischen Hochschule at Dresden. Beginning in 1906 he worked in Düsseldorf, initially as director of the children's ward at the municipal hospital. In 1923 he attained the title of professor of pediatrics in Düsseldorf."

  "text" : "Alexander Baker (1611 – 4 August 1685) was an English lawyer and politician who sat in the House of Commons in 1660. Baker was the son of Alexander Baker, barber-surgeon of Channel Row, Westminster and his first wife Alice Jervoise, daughter of Edward Jervoise of Hampshire. He was baptised 25 July 1611. He was a student of Clifford’s Inn in 1634 and became an attorney. He did not participate in the Civil War, although Oliver Cromwell used his house as quarters shortly before the trial of Charles I. In April 1660, Baker became a freeman of New Windsor and was elected Member of Parliament for Windsor for the Convention Parliament. He was commissioner for assessment for Berkshire from August 1660 to 1661. In 1661, he stood again at Windsor and although returned by the burgesses at large he was not supported by the corporation and the House decided in favour of the corporation. He spent the rest of his life \"in peaceful retirement\". Baker died at the age of about 74 and was commemorated by a memorial inscription in Windsor parish church. Baker married Elizabeth Farrer, daughter of Thomas Farrer of Harrold, Bedfordshire by 1635 and had three daughters."

In 1886 he relocated to Berlin, where he worked at a private medical practice until 1911, spending his free time performing research in the laboratories of pathologist Carl Friedländer (1847-1887), pharmacologist Oskar Liebreich (1839-1908) and bacteriologist Robert Koch (1843-1910). Gottstein was deeply interested in epidemiological and statistical studies, as well as social hygiene issues from a medical standpoint. In 1906 he became a municipal councillor in Berlin-Charlottenburg, followed by an appointment as Stadtmedizinalrat (1911). In 1914 he was Geheimer Sanitätsrat (privy medical councillor), and from 1919 to 1924 served as Ministerialdirektor. In this capacity he took a progressive stance in regards to public health, being associated with initiatives that included establishment of the Landesgesundheitsrates (Prussian State Health Council), the Krüppelfürsorgegesetz (welfare act involving the crippled) and the creation of three academies of social hygiene."

He progressed to serve on the union's Executive Committee from 1917, and on the General Council of the Trades Union Congress (TUC) from 1919. He was President of the TUC in 1925, and, during his term of office, he chaired the first meeting of a national organisation of trades councils. A long-term member of the Independent Labour Party, having joined in 1895, Swales was regarded as the most left-wing member of the TUC General Council during the British General Strike. During the strike, he chaired the TUC's Special Industrial Committee, which co-ordinated contact with the Miners' Federation of Great Britain and joint action. He stood to become president of the Engineers in 1930, winning the first round of the ballot, but lost to W. H. Hutchinson in the second round. Swales retired from his union posts in 1935, but took a new post as Trustee for the National Union of Seamen."

On January 9, 2007, Samartino, a Cuban refugee who had been a resident of Bolivia since 2000, was expelled from that country after having been held for seventeen days for criticizing the Bolivian and Cuban governments. According to a report by the Human Rights Foundation (HFR), \"Samartino was subjected to numerous human rights violations, including wrongful imprisonment, arbitrary detainment, forced exile, due process abuse, and undue restriction of free speech.\" He arrived in Colombia on the night of January 8. Thor Halvorssen, president of HRF, said: \"Amauris Samartino’s case is a scandal and it reveals that the government of Bolivia will stop at nothing to silence dissent.\""

  "text" : "Adolfo Ferrata (26 April 1880 in Brescia – 9 March 1946) was an Italian pathologist and hematologist. In 1904 he earned his medical degree from the University of Parma, spending the following years performing scientific research in clinics at Parma, Berlin and Naples. From 1921 to 1924 he was a professor of special medical pathology at the Universities of Messina and Siena, afterwards serving as a professor of clinical medicine at the University of Pavia, a position he kept for the remainder of his career. Among his contributions to medical science are investigations on the structure and embryology of the kidney, research on the morphology of intestinal villi and haematopoietic studies in normal and pathological conditions. In his research of haematopoiesis, Ferrata helped demonstrate the systemic nature of leukemia, leading him to support an hypothesis that elements of the blood (erythrocytes, leukocytes, and blood platelets) all originate from the hemocytoblast, a direct descendant of a mesenchymal cell, which he referred to as an emoistioblasto (hemohistioblast). In 1907 he was the first scientist to show that the complement could be split into two components that were singularly inactive, only regaining their activity when reunited. In 1920 Ferrata founded the journal \"Haematologica\"."

  "text" : "Axel Hermansen Cappelen (20 July 1858 – 13 November 1919) was a Norwegian surgeon. He was born in Selje as a son of district physician Johan Nicolay Cappelen (1818–1890) and Elisabeth Brunchorst Ravn (1825–1906). His brother Christian was also a physician, and through him, Axel was an uncle of Minister of Justice Johan Cappelen. He attended Bergen Cathedral School and finished his secondary education in 1876. He graduated from the Royal Frederick University with the cand.med. degree in 1883. After spending the four last months of 1884 at Rikshospitalet, he moved to Kabelvaag in 1885 to become the municipal physician of Vaagan. Here he married Johanne Marie Kaarbø in 1886. They had one daughter and three sons. One of their sons, Thor, also became a physician and was the father of architect Per Cappelen. In 1889 Axel Cappelen was hired at Nordre Trondhjem County Hospital in Namsos. He remained here for the next years, and was also the acting district physician of East Lofoten in 1888–1889 as well as acting district physician of Fosen in 1891. After a period in the surgical department at Rikshospitalet from 1893 to 1896 he served as chief physician at Stavanger Hospital from 1897 until his death. At Rikshospitalet he is credited with performing the first surgery on a human heart on 4 September 1895. The patient needed emergency surgery due to a knife wound. Cappelen accessed the thoracic cavity by cutting through the fourth rib. He repaired the wound of the left ventricle where he has sustained the stab wounds in the left side of his chest. After two days of intensive care, the patient died of coronary occlusion and not because of the repairing of the heart. At the autopsy the wound was found to be satisfactorily closed. He was a fellow of the German Society of Surgery. In August 1918 he was decorated as a Knight, First Class of the Order of St. Olav. He died in November 1919 from meningitis. A bust of him was unveiled outside of Stavanger Hospital in 1934."

  "text" : "Andrew Love (November 21, 1941 – April 12, 2012) was a saxophone player based in Memphis, Tennessee, best known for being a member of The Memphis Horns. Love was born in Memphis and began his interest in music at the Baptist church where his father was pastor. His music education continued in high school and at Langston University in Oklahoma. He returned to Memphis in 1965 and began session work at Stax Records where he teamed up with trumpet player Wayne Jackson. The two created the signature horn sound at Stax on hit records by Otis Redding, Sam & Dave and others. After recording numerous tracks at Stax, he and Jackson incorporated themselves into The Memphis Horns and began freelancing. Love and Jackson recorded at sessions for such artists as Neil Diamond, Elvis Presley and Dusty Springfield. The duo also toured with The Doobie Brothers, Jimmy Buffett, Robert Cray and numerous other performers. In 2002, Love was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease which forced his retirement the following year and his eventual death in 2012 at age 70. Al Bell, co-owner of Stax records, said \"I love saxophone players, and I have many saxophone players I admire and hold in high esteem. But I have never heard a saxophone player who affects and penetrates me like Andrew Love. It was the spirit in him, and you could feel it in the music. He could arouse your deepest emotions, but he would do it gently, softly. It was like he was making love to your soul.\""

Widely recognized for ‘The Inevitable Flight,’ he garnered enough public interest to eventually convince the government against relocating the world’s largest bird sanctuary in Pakistan.

  "text" : "Adrien Broom is a contemporary fine art and commercial photographer from Connecticut. Broom's fine art photography often alludes to themes of childhood fantasy, with young women as the protagonists. Her commercial work includes fashion and portrait photography. Broom received a bachelor's degree in computer animation from Northeastern University, studied fine art in Florence, Italy at Studio Art Centers International(SACI), and art history in the Christie's Education program in London. Citing childhood memories as an important catalyst, she makes use of period costumes to compose images that are often derived from fairy tales, but \"It's a little darker than my reality as a child, drawing on my adult vision of the beautiful and bizarre.\" When composing fantasy-based scenarios on a miniature scale, Broom constructs sets in her studio using malleable and found objects. A current project continues to draw from the interest in fairy tale imagery, with the exploration of color as a unifying theme. As part of her commercial assignments, Broom regularly photographs Grace Potter and the Nocturnals. Broom's photographs have been featured in numerous exhibitions in Connecticut and New York City, as well as in the American Dreamers exhibition at the Palazzo Strozzi in Florence in 2012. For art historian Roderick Conway Morris, Broom's photographs of ethereal female figures include references to Pre-Raphaelite art, Baroque sculpture and Symbolism. Bartholomew Bland, Director of Curatorial Affairs at the Hudson River Museum, writes that \"through the use of photography, Broom cleverly conceals from us her meticulous craftsmanship....in Broom's (work) it is easy to forget that many of the most dramatic effects are created by hand.\" In her miniature dioramas, Broom uses both overt narrative and enigmatic imagery, with references to classical art as well as existential literature. Working at Erector Square in New Haven, Broom often supplements her studio's ample natural light with artificial illumination. Her work entails three distinct components: the building of sets, the photographic shoot itself and the subsequent editing of images. According to Broom, the construction of a set takes between one and three weeks. \"My sets take a while to build, and renting a space per project just wouldn’t make sense.\" In 2015, Broom's photographs and installations are the subject of an exhibition at the Hudson River Museum."

  "text" : "Rev. Archibald \"Archie\" Eneas Robertson (1870 in Helensburgh – 1958), was a Church of Scotland minister. He is generally regarded in 1901 as being the first mountaineer to \"bag\" all of Sir Hugh Munro, 4th Baronet's 283 peaks over 3,000 feet. After 1907 he became minister of Braes of Rannoch (near the Bridge of Gaur, on the River Gaur) where Robertson made an effort to learn Scottish Gaelic, to deliver his sermons in Gaelic and try to keep the language alive. However it is now known that Robertson turned back before the summit of Ben Wyvis due to adverse weather. Nor was the inaccessible pinnacle of Sgùrr Dearg included in 1901."

Adamatzky is the author or co-author of five books: \n* Identification of Cellular Automata (Taylor & Francis, 1994) \n* Computing in Nonlinear Media and Automata Collectives (Institute of Physics, 2001) \n* Dynamics of Crowd-Minds: Patterns of Irrationality in Emotions, Beliefs and Actions (World Scientific, 2005) \n* Reaction-Diffusion Computers (with Ben De Lacy Costello and Tetsuya Asai, Elsevier, 2005) \n* Physarum Machines: Computers from Slime Mould (World Scientific, 2010) In addition he is the editor or co-editor of several edited volumes. Adamatzky is known for his research in unconventional computing. In particular, he has worked on chemical computers using reaction-diffusion processes.He has used slime moulds to plan potential routes for roadway systems and as components of nanorobotic systems, and discovered that they seek out sedatives in preference to nutrients. He has also shown that the billiard balls in billiard-ball computers may be replaced by soldier crabs."

  "text" : "Ana Karen Allende is a Mexican artisan from the Mexico City borough of Coyoacán, who specializes in creating rag dolls and soft fabric animals. The tradition of making rag dolls in Mexico extends back to the pre-Hispanic period with the making of rag dolls reaching its peak in the 19th century. Allende’s first doll was made when her sister was about to turn fifteen. For quinceañera celebrations in Xochimilco, it is customary to give the girl her “last doll” as a means of marking her transition from child to adult. Allende decided to make this doll herself, using sewing skills taught to her by her grandmother. Soon after, she began to make dolls for her friends and family, and the attention they received prompted her to think of selling them. Allende started her own small business called Retacitos (Scraps) in 2002 involving other members of her family, such as her husband Sinhúe Lucas, along with contracting various single mothers in her area to work. She sells directly to the public only on Saturdays at the Art Bazaar in the San Ángel neighborhood. Her other sales are mainly to stores and museums. She receives a number of custom orders including making dolls that look like famous people such as Frida Kahlo and even those that look like the purchaser. Allende states that her goal is to revive the craft of doll making but in a more modern form. She generally sticks to forms familiar to Mexican concepts of cultural identity such as lucha libre wrestlers, angels, traditional rag dolls, horses, mermaids, rabbits, etc. She has been recognized as an authentic Mexican craftswoman since 2010 by the government of Mexico City, her work has been exhibited in various museums and cultural events and has won the 3rd place at the VI Bienal Internacional de Arte Textil Contemporáneo WTA (2012) and the 1st place in the toys category at the Gran Premio de Arte Popular of FONART (2006)."

He represented Saltcoats from 1929 to 1934 and from 1948 to 1960 and Pheasant Hills from 1934 to 1948 in the Legislative Assembly of Saskatchewan as a Liberal. His surname also appears as Lopston in some sources. Born in Iceland, the son of Sveinbjorn and Steinun Amundson, he came to Winnipeg, Manitoba with his parents in 1887. In 1891, the family moved to Saskatchewan. Loptson trained as a harness-maker and then moved to Selkirk, Manitoba, where he apprenticed as a jeweller. He married Kristin Sveinbjornson in 1908. In 1909, Loptson opened a general store in Bredenbury. He was a member of the council for the rural municipality of Saltcoats, serving four years as reeve. He also served on the town council for Bredenbury, also serving as secretary-treasurer and mayor of the town. Loptson was defeated by Joseph Lee Phelps when he ran for reelection to the assembly in 1938. After his defeat, he returned to farming, retiring in 1945. Loptson ran for an assembly seat again in 1948, defeating Phelps. He served as interim Liberal Party leader and opposition leader in the assembly in 1954 after Walter Tucker returned to federal politics. Loptson retired from the assembly in 1960, moving to Yorkton. He died in Winnipeg in 1972."

In 1966, his criticism of the war in Vietnam was condemned by Sen. Thomas J. Dodd, a member of the Senate Subcommittee on Internal Security, as reflecting \"a vociferous minority\" rather than mainstream Jewish opinion. In 1988, at the outbreak of the first Palestinian intifada, he criticized Israeli government policy. In a series of diary entries published in the New York Times Magazine, he wrote, \"Whether we accept it or not, every night's television news confirms it: Israelis now seem the oppressors, Palestinians the victims.\" In response, Malcolm Hoenlein, executive vice chairman of the Conference of Presidents of Major American Organizations, accused him of \"too much public posturing and too little private discourse.\""

  "text" : "Arthur Hill (1875–1932) was an English animal impersonator for theatre. Hill’s most famous role was as the Cowardly Lion in The Wizard of Oz. Hill began his career performing animals in pantomimes. Among his roles were the wolf in Little Red Riding Hood, the bear in Valentine and Orson and the cat in Dick Wittington. Hill’s animal impersonations became very popular and in 1902 he was offered the role of the Cowardly Lion in the original production of The Wizard of Oz, written by L. Frank Baum, who also wrote the book of the same name. However, unlike the original book the Lion was not a central character and was reduced to a bit part. He was also much more animalistic, as he did not speak. His quest for courage was also deleted. Despite this Hill still earned critical acclaim and his performance was highly popular. Hill said that the lion was the most strenuous role he ever had to play, as the costume was so heavy and elaborate. The costume weighed eighty pounds and was said to be modelled on a study of a lion’s head by Rosa Bonheur. The costume consisted of two pieces a head & mane section and a body section that was made from a real lion skin Hill was given limited visibility by peering through the lion’s mouth which was opened by pulling a string. Strings also operated the eyes, ears and tongue. The sound of roaring was created by an offstage stagehand that rubbed a piece of resin up and down a stout cord fastened at one end to the centre of a drumhead stretched over a barrel. The role earned Hill fame, and after appearing in the original production and reprising it for the production’s revival, he became a regular on Broadway as animals. He appeared in many shows throughout the rest of his life. One of them was A Good Little Devil also featured another animal actor, Pat Walshe, who, coincidentally later appeared in the 1939 version of The Wizard of Oz. In addition to appearing in the stage production of A Good Little Devil, he was also brought, along with much of the show's cast, to appear in the 1914 silent film. In the same year he made another film appearance in The Yellow Traffic. After a long and successful career in Broadway and Pantomime, Hill died at the age of 57 on 4 April 1932."

As a younger son he received only the district of Driedorf from his father's inheritance. In 1653, he married Elisabeth Charlotte (1640–1707), the daughter of Peter Melander, Count of Holzappel. Via her, he inherited the County of Holzappel and the Lordship of Schaumburg. He then styled himself Count of Nassau-Schaumburg and became the founder of the Nassau-Schaumburg line. However, all his sons predeceased him, and when he died in 1676, Holzappel and Schaumburg fell to his son-in-law Lebrecht, Prince of Anhalt-Zeitz-Hoym, the founder of the Alhalt-Bernburg-Schaumburg-Hoym line. Adolph and Elisabeth Charlotte had the following children: \n*  Catherine (b. 1659) \n*  Agnes (b. 1660) \n*  Wilhliam Louis (b. 1661) \n*  Ernestine Charlotte (1662–1732), married: 1.  \n*  in 1678 William Maurice of Nassau-Siegen (1649–1691) 2.  \n*  Frederick Philip of Geuder-Rabensteiner (d. 13 May 1727), Councillor and Hofmeister at the court in Bernburg \n*  Joan Elisabeth (1663 – 9 February 1700), married in 1692 to Count Frederick Adolph of Lippe-Detmold \n*  Louise Henriette (1665-1665) \n*  Charles Henry (b. 1670) \n*  Charlotte (1673–1700), married in 1692 to Prince Lebrecht of Anhalt-Zeitz-Hoym"

Argo, was a promoter of the work of Scottish folk artists and their music. After working as a journalist in the North East, from 1966 he worked for BBC Scotland, from 1973 as a producer with Radio Scotland. He produced the long-running radio series 'Fit Like Folk?', and 'The Reel Blend', a Scottish music series. He was the founder and president of the Aberdeen Folksong Club and published a series of folk song booklets in the 1960s called 'Chapbook'. Many musicians such as Aly Bain, Barbara Dickson, Jean Redpath and Billy Connolly cite Argo as a major influence and stepping stone in their early careers. Argo visited the United States twice in the early 1960s and met many of the established and rising stars of the American folk scene including Pete Seeger and Bob Dylan."

  "text" : "Alexi Torres is an artist from Cuba. He is known for his oil paintings that are painted to appear as if knitted and woven. His artistic inspiration is derived from everyday, organic objects, such as leaves, feathers, basket weavings, and cloth. It is driven by a love of nature and his dedication to perfecting a unique technique of oil painting. Inspired by his upbringing, Torres views the art making process as planting an idea and harvesting it. He builds the stretchers, stretches the canvases, and primes them himself. As his ancestors did during the harvest, he starts and finishes each work following the cycle of the waning moon. Alexi Torres was born in 1976 in Matanzas, Cuba. He attended the Elemental School of Art in Matanzas, Cuba (1989-1991) and the National School of Arts in Havana, Cuba (1991-1995.) He has had solo exhibitions around the world. His work has also been featured in several group exhibitions and held in the collections of famous figures, such as Will Smith. In fact, in the ABC special from November 19, 2013 featuring magician, David Blaine, Jada Pinkett Smith and the whole family are standing in front of the painting, ReAmerica, while Will Smith, David Blaine, and Jada are performing the illusion. Torres currently lives and works in Georgia and Zancudo, Costa Rica. He has shown his work at several art fairs including the Miami International Art Fair, Scope Art Fair, Arthamptons, Art Southamptons, Aspen Fine Art Fair, Palm Beach Art Fair, San Francisco Fine Art Fair, Art Palm Springs, and the Houston Fine Art Fair. He is represented by Unix Gallery. He is also represented by Evan Lurie Gallery."

In 1926 he and Poul Nørlund unearthed 13 skeletons in Igaliku. In 1932 he returned to Greenland with Eigil Knuth on an archaeological dig to excavate old Norse sites on West Greenland's coast. Roussel, Knuth and Nørlund returned during the summer of 1934, excavating the old Norse ruins again at Igaliku. He returned again in the summer of 1937 with a Polish expedition to the Godthaab district. Roussel worked for the National Museum of Denmark and was often appointed to lead archaeological expeditions and exhibitions. He authored works such as Farms and Churches in the Mediaeval Norse Settlement of Greenland (1941) He was later a contributor to the Arctic Encyclopedia. During the German occupation of Denmark, Roussel participated actively in the resistance movement. As a result, in 1957 he was appointed head of the newly established Denmark's Liberation Museum 1940-1945 (Frihedsmuseet), a position he held until 1971 when his health began to fail."

Rising from shoemaker to shipping magnate in little more than thirty years, Allan retired in 1839 having made a fortune and created a transatlantic dynasty. He is recognised as one of the major contributors to Scotland's commercial interests in the early 19th century, and to the establishment of the Firth of Clyde as an international centre of shipping. During the Napoleonic Wars his brig, Jean – so named for his wife – held the record for the fastest crossing between the Firth of Clyde and Quebec City. Under his five sons, the Allan Line became the world's largest privately owned shipping empire."

He was served with a lifetime ban from football, but after winning Cummings Trophy for fair play in the Civil Service Hockey League, he was reinstated in 1931. His first season with the Riders was 1933 and he would play in the Grey Cup in 1936, was an all-star in 1937, and was fully vindicated when he won the Jeff Russel Memorial Trophy for skill, sportsmanship, and courage in 1936. He later served overseas with the Canadian Army for three years, during World War II. Morrison also coached the Carleton Ravens football team in 1948 and 1949."

In July 2013 Matt Vensel, writing in the Baltimore Sun, called Rypien the most prominent player in the league.Most players in the league play for fun, or for the local fame, and the possibility of local endorsement and appearance fees, and need to hold down a day-job. Rypien, on the other hand, is able to support herself solely from serving as a model or spokesperson for firms such as Under Armour, EyeBlack and TheraPearl. Prior to playing football Rypien was a stylist. She has been hired by two different teams in the Lingerie Football League.She served as a quarterback for the Seattle Mist in 2011.She signed to play for the Baltimore Charm in 2012.But the league management decided to cancel the 2012 season in the USA, and concentrate instead on exhibition matches in the USA, and promotion of foreign leagues. Rypien is one of the daughters of quarterback Mark Rypien, the only Canadian chosen as Super Bowl MVP when his team, the Washington Redskins, won Super Bowl XXVI. NBC News reported they were surprised that the Legends Football League allowed free agency, but added \"But if you’re the daughter of former Redskins quarterback Mark Rypien, and a pretty intense player in your own right, I guess you do.\". According to technology journalist Patrick Seitz, the league lacked stars in its early seasons, so the limited press coverage the league received treated it solely as a \"peep show\".He asserted that Rypien and Krista Ford, due to the reflected notability of having famous relatives, were two potential stars the league could offer in its 2011 season—to counter the peep-show coverage. In 2014, Rypien was reported to be dating professional baseball player Taijuan Walker of the Seattle Mariners."

Merz has conducted vigorous research into the historicity of Jesus and is best known for her 1996 book with Gerd Theissen, The Historical Jesus, a widely used textbook translated into six languages. In the book, Metz and Theissen \"assert that the Christian sources portray both positive and negative assessments of temple sacrifice and that Jesus, near the end of his life, deliberately created a rite to displace such sacrifices\" and argue that \"significant sayings of Jesus indicate a critical attitude towards the temple cult.\" They also argue that \"God's kingdom is the establishment of his ethical will, the kingdom is to be understood dynamically as rule. But the \"kingdom of God\" is not an end in itself\", and also examine \"five of the most important differences” between Jesus and John. In the 16th and final chapter they examine the historical Jesus and the beginnings of Christology. In 2007, she and several other scholars published Kompendium der Gleichnisse Jesu, a major volume on the parables of Jesus. In 2012 she was due to publish Kompendium der frühchristlichen Wundererzählungen, another extensive volume which documents the miracles of Jesus."

  "text" : "Aaron ben Benjamin Wolf (about 1670 – July 25, 1721) was a Rabbi at Berlin and then at Frankfort-on-the-Oder, where he lived until his death. His father, Isaac Benjamin Wolf ben Eliezer Liebman, author of Naḥlat Binyamin (Amsterdam, 1682), rabbi in the mark of Brandenburg, was the brother of the court Jew Jost Liebman, who played a prominent part in the congregation of Berlin in the earliest period of its history. Aaron married Resel, the daughter of his uncle, who founded for him a Talmudical school and supported not only Aaron but also his disciples. In 1697, when the declining health of Shemariah, then rabbi of Berlin, necessitated the appointment of a successor, Aaron was made rabbi of the mark, and in 1709 was appointed by King Frederick I of Prussia to the office of chief rabbi of Berlin, with jurisdiction over all the Jews living in the mark. But with the death of King Frederick I conditions changed. Esther, the widow of Jost Liebman, fell into disfavor with Frederick William I, her property was confiscated, and she died of a broken heart in 1714. These reverses made it impossible for Aaron to maintain his students; and the factions in the congregation of Berlin caused him constant anxiety, especially since he had always sided with his wife's family, which was very unpopular with the community. He was finally forced to leave Berlin and went to Frankfort-on-the-Oder, where he officiated as rabbi until his death. He left some works, though none has been printed. He wrote several approbations (haskamot) to books, published in Berlin, notably that to the first edition of Samuel ben Meir's commentary on the Pentateuch (1705), the manuscript of which was in the possession of David Oppenheimer, to whom he was related by marriage. His approbation of Nehemiah Ḥayyun's cabalistic work, 'Oz le-Elohim (1712), caused him great annoyance, because of the charges of heresy brought against the work, which he, like David Oppenheimer, had indorsed without reading. In Berlin his brother-in-law Michael Ḥasid succeeded him."

  "text" : "Aaron Berechiah ben Moses ben Nehemiah of Modena was an Italian cabalist, who died in 1639. He was a pupil of Rabbi Hillel of Modena (surnamed Ḥasid we-Ḳaddosh, that is, \"The Pious and Holy\") and of Rabbi Menahem Azariah of Fano. At the request of the Ḥebrah Ḳaddisha (Burial Society) at Mantua he instituted rites for them. He is the author of Ma'abar Yabboḳ, which contains dissertations on separation, purity, and holiness. Added to these are prayers to be offered for the sick and the dead, as well as rules for their treatment. To avert possible criticism for failing to discuss these themes philosophically, he makes use of the statement of Isaac Arama in his book Aḳedat Yiẓḥaḳ (chap. xxv.): \"Reason must surrender some of its rights to the divine revelations which are superior to it.\" Other works written by him are: Ashmoret haBoḳer (The Watches of the Morning), prayers to be said in the early morning, arranged for the society called \"Me'ire ha-Shaḥar\" (Awakeners of the Morning), and therefore also published under this name. A commentary on Tiḳḳune ha-Zohar. Me'il Ẓedaḳah (The Cloak of Righteousness), on worship and study, published at Mantua in 1767, together with Bigde Ḳodesh (Garments of Holiness), on the same subject. Ḥibbur beḲabbalah, a work on the Cabala, consisting of four volumes: Shemen Mishḥat Ḳodesh (The Oil of Holy Anointment), on the principles of the Cabala according to Moses Cordovero and Isaac Luria; Shemen Zait Zak (The Pure Oil of the Olive), public addresses on the same subject; Shetil Poreaḥ (The Blossoming Plant), on the mysterious meaning of prayers and ceremonies; Imre Shefer (Words of Beauty), and miscellaneous matter; this whole work was seen in manuscript by Azulai at Modena, and is found in parts in some libraries. Magen Aharon (Shield of Aaron), containing a compendium of Luria's works. This fertile writer is said to have been, like Joseph Caro, in constant communion with a spirit called the Maggid."

In 1623 he was imprisoned as a supposed accomplice of Isaac Jeshurun, who had been falsely accused of ritual murder.

Aaron or to his grandfather, Aaron ben Joseph, is uncertain. The latter is more probably its author.

About the middle of the thirteenth century he studied under Naḥmanides, at Girona, where he also met, as a fellow pupil, Solomon ben Adret, who later came to be his opponent. Aaron especially mentions among his teachers his brother Phinehas (who migrated later to Canet near Perpignan, after which place he is surnamed), and his nephew Isaac, the son of his brother Benveniste. His life appears to have been spent in Spain. In 1285 he was rabbi in Saragossa, where he was so highly respected that Nissim ben Reuben, in 1350, did not dare to annul a decision given by Aaron to a community in that city, even though he considered it illegal (Isaac ben Sheshet, responsa, No. 390). About 1291 Aaron lived for a short time in Toledo. The assertion of some modern historians that, when advanced in age, he emigrated to Provence, is based on a misunderstanding of Meiri (see below), where the correct reading is instead of, and instead of (see Neubauer's edition, p. 230). According to Isaac de Lattes, Aaron wrote commentaries on most of the treatises in the Talmud, of which but few exist to-day; namely, those on the treatises Beẓah and Ketubot, also commentaries on the Halakot of Alfasi, of which the portions on Berakot and Ta'anit have been published by S. and N. Bamberger (Mentz, 1874) under the title \"Peḳudat ha-Lewiyim.\" He wrote also several compendiums of laws concerning the precepts of various rituals. The \"Precepts Concerning Wine,\" which is added to the work \"'Abodat ha-Ḳodesh\" by his opponent, Solomon ben Adret (Venice, 1602), is the only one published; another part is in manuscript in the Bodleian Library. His pupil Yom-Ṭob Ashbili (that is, of Seville) has preserved, in his novellæ (\"Ḥiddushim\") to the Talmud, many of the explanations of Aaron. The reputation of Aaron as a high Talmudic authority did not arise from any of the above works, which were not widely published, but from his \"Bedeḳ ha-Bayit\" (Breaches of the House), a criticism of the great work, \"Torat ha-Bayit\" (The Precept of the House), written by Solomon ben Adret. Several times during his rabbinical career Aaron came into conflict on important points with Solomon ben Adret, the leading spirit of the Spanish Jews. On one occasion they failed to agree in the decision of a subject submitted to them, and neither being willing to acknowledge the superiority of the other, they were obliged to refer the case to the French authorities. No sooner had Adret published his important work, \"Torat ha-Bayit,\" than Aaron submitted it to a severe but just criticism. It reflects great credit upon Aaron that he treated his opponent with the greatest deference, never allowing himself to descend to personalities. The same thing can not be said of Adret's counter-criticism, \"Mishmeret ha-Bayit\" (Defense of the House), which is written in an acrimonious, not to say malicious, tone: that may perhaps be the reason that Adret published it anonymously, for it was only in later years that he acknowledged his authorship. These two distinguished pupils of Naḥmanides differed also in many other points. While Adret inclined to mysticism, Aaron treated important dogmatical questions in a fashion which was distasteful to the orthodox, as, for instance, his opinion on resurrection. Without denying resurrection, he maintained that the body would have to undergo certain changes until it acquired an ethereal nature which would permit it to appear before God and to look upon the glory of heaven. Aaron was at first credited with the authorship of the \"Sefer ha-Ḥinnuk\"—an error corrected by Rosin (\"Ein Compendium der Jüdischen Gesetzeskunde,\" 1871, pp. 131–134). See Aaron ha-Levi of Barcelona."

  "text" : "Aaron ben Joseph Sason was an Ottoman Talmudic author; born toward the middle of the sixteenth century, probably at Salonica, where he received his rabbinical education under the supervision of Mordecai Matalon, an eminent scholar. During the last decades of the sixteenth century Aaron ben Joseph engaged in teaching, and some of his pupils ranked among the eminent rabbis of Turkey. With these, as well as with his colleagues, he maintained a lively correspondence on Talmudic questions, the summary of which (232 responsa) was published at Venice in 1625 under the title \"Torat Emet\" (Law of Truth). In the introduction to this work he mentions his commentaries on \"Yad ha-Ḥazaḳah\" of Maimonides and on the \"Ṭur\" of Jacob ben Asher, as well as his treatises on various halakic subjects, which do not appear to have been published, and which are perhaps altogether lost. It seems probable that the work \"Sefat Emet\" (Lip of Truth), which, according to the testimony of Shabbethai, Bass, contains scholia to the Talmud and to the Tosafot, was written by Aaron ben Joseph and not by his grandson, Aaron ben Isaac Sason. This probability is supported to some extent by the title, \"Sefat Emet,\" which corresponds with the title of his collection of responsa, as well as by the above cited statement in his introduction to \"Torat Emet,\" that he had written scholia to the Talmud."

  "text" : "Aaron ha-Levi of Barcelona (also known as Aaron ben Joseph Sason) was a Spanish Talmudist of the end of the thirteenth century; author of the first book of religious instruction among the Jews of the Middle Ages. Though his work the Sefer ha-Chinuch (Book of Education) was well known, having been repeatedly commented on and republished in more than a dozen editions, it was reserved for Rosin to discover anything accurate concerning the personality of the author. The book itself is anonymous; and the statement by Gedaliah ibn Yaḥyah (dating from the middle of the sixteenth century), that its author was the celebrated Talmudist Aaron ben Joseph ha-Levi, has been generally accepted. It is now, however, certain that the author was a Spanish instructor of youth, of modest position, one who had contented himself with but the faintest allusion to his own identity in symbolically applying to himself the verse Mal. ii. 5, at the end of the prefatory letter to the book; in an old Midrash (Sifra, Shemini, ed. Weiss, i. 45d) this verse is referred to Aaron. He lays no claim to original research. The book was simply intended to impart to Jewish youth a knowledge of the Law, and to present in simple form the principles of Judaism to the unlearned layman. The writer seems to have had this lay-public always before him; and his work is in this respect different from that of his predecessors, Maimonides, Naḥmanides, and Moses of Coucy, from whose works he liberally draws. The Sefer ha-Chinuch is an enumeration of the six hundred and thirteen affirmative and negative precepts of the Mosaic Law, arranged in the order of the weekly lessons (parashot), with their ethical and halakic aspects, based upon rabbinical tradition of the Talmudic and post-Talmudic periods, for which latter feature he relies upon Alfasi, Maimonides, and Naḥmanides as main authorities. His chief and original merit is displayed in the ingenuity and religious fervor with which he dwells upon the ethical side of the Law, avoiding most admirably all abstruse philosophical and mystical theories, such as are only too abundant in his guides, Maimonides and Naḥmanides. The following are some specimens of his method. Upon the precept concerning the treading ox (Deut. xxv. 4) the Sefer ha-Chinuch remarks: \"It is the duty of man to accustom himself to show kindness, compassion, and consideration to his fellow creatures. When we therefore treat considerately even the animals given for our use, and withdraw not from them some of the fruits of what their labor obtains for us, we educate our soul thereby to be all the kinder to our fellow men, and accustom ourselves not to withhold from them what is their due, but to allow them to enjoy with us the result of that to which they have contributed\" (par. 601). Some of his explanations of purely ritual ordinances betray likewise a deep religious sentiment. Thus, he says, the counting (see 'Omer) of the seven weeks between Passover and Pentecost (Lev. xxiii. 15) is intended to cause us to meditate upon the real and deeper meaning of both those festivals. Israel's redemption from Egypt was only the beginning of true freedom for the nation; its full measure was not attained until the Revelation was given, which event is commemorated by the latter festival. On that day Israel may be truly said to have become a free people; therefore let the true Israelite reverentially and lovingly count the very days intervening between the date that brought him bodily liberty and that which perfected it by adding spiritual enfranchisement. Even in the citation of rabbinical traditions and amplifications of the Law, the author displays rare judgment and proper feeling, thus completely justifying the popularity which this book has for centuries enjoyed. The author's enumeration of the fundamental doctrines ('iḳḳarim) of Judaism is noteworthy; namely, \"the eternity, omnipotence, unity, and omniscience of God; creation of the world by God; rewards and punishments for human actions; and the truth of Jewish tradition\" (introduction to the Sefer ha-Chinuch). Compared with the familiar principles of faith as enumerated by Maimonides, one is struck by the fact that the Sefer ha-Chinuch, representing the official orthodoxy of the time, mentions neither the unchange-ableness of the Law nor resurrection. This is owing undoubtedly to the aversion of rabbinical Judaism to the Maimonidean attempt to set up dogmas. The Sefer ha-Chinuch has been translated into Spanish and Latin; the former version seems to have been in existence about a hundred years ago, but has entirely disappeared. An abbreviation of the Latin translation was published by J. H. Hottinger under the title Juris Hebræorum Leges 261 . . . Ductu R. Levi Barcelonitæ, Zurich, 1656, and a French extract under the title, Instruction Religieuse et Morale, by E. Halévy."

In it Władysław asks of the Tsar permission for Aaron Markovich, \"the king's agent,\" to visit Moscow for the purpose of purchasing (with the privilege of exemption from custom duties) certain utensils for the royal household; also that he be allowed to take with him, for sale, some \"precious goods.\" This request, together with the fact that Władysław was not very favorably disposed toward the Jews, is evidence of the influential standing of Aaron with the Polish king.

At the end of the work is an appendix, called \"Minḥah Belulah,\" which contains responsa and commentaries on Talmudic topics. Some of his responsa may be found in the \"Meḳor Mayim Ḥayyim\" (Sudilkov, 1836), a work by his grandson, Jacob Meir of Padua.

  "text" : "Aaron ben Moses Teomim was a Czech-Polish rabbinical scholar; born about 1630, probably in Prague, where the Teomim-Fränkel family, from Vienna, had settled; died in Chmelnik, Poland, July 8, 1690. In 1670 he was called as rabbi to Worms, where he succeeded Samson Bacharach. Prior to this he had been a preacher at Prague. In a serious illness which overcame him on Passover evening, 1675 he vowed he would write a commentary on the Haggadah if he should be restored to health. On his recovery he published this commentary under the title \"Maṭṭeh Aharon\" (Aaron's Rod), Frankfort-on-the-Main, 1678. Another work, \"Bigde Aharon\" (Aaron's Vestments), homilies on the Pentateuch, was published after the author's death at Frankfort-on-the-Main, 1710. His \"Glosses on Shulḥan 'Aruk, Ḥoshen Mishpaṭ\" remained in manuscript. Responsa of his are found in the collections of Jair Ḥayyim Bacharach, \"Ḥawwot Yair,\" and in those of Eliakim Goetz b. Meir of Hildesheim, \"Eben ha-Shoham.\" In 1677 Aaron received a call to Lissa in Poland, which he declined; but in 1690 he accepted a call to the rabbinical seat of Cracow. He was there but three months when a Polish nobleman, probably in order to blackmail the congregation, ordered his arrest in Chmelnik, whither he had gone to attend the congregational Meeting of the Four Lands (Arba' Araẓot). On Sabbath, July 8, 1690, he was arrested, placed on horseback, and hurried to prison. He fell off the horse several times and was as often remounted. Before the jail was reached he had died of fright and ill-treatment. He was buried at Pintchov. As a character and as a rabbinical scholar, Aaron Teomim did not rise above the level of his contemporaries. In his rabbinical works, Teomim is a typical Pilpulist. His scholastic discourses are in accordance with the vogue of that age. That his theories, as exhibited in his treatment of the Haggadah, were appreciated by his contemporaries, is proved by the fact that his Haggadah was reprinted three times: at Amsterdam, in 1695; at Frankfort-on-the-Main, in 1710; at Amsterdam, in 1712. A severe criticism which Jair Ḥayyim Bacharach wrote under the title \"Maṭṭeh Aharon,\" and which he did not dare to publish, was certainly not free from personal motives. Bacharach, the son and grandson of former rabbis of Worms, living in that city after he had lost his position in Coblenz, had hoped to succeed his father; and he wished to show that the congregation had not chosen a better man. Bacharach's interesting criticism was published by Jellinek in the first volume of \"Bikkurim,\" a periodical edited by Naphtali Keller."

  "text" : "Aaron Samuel ben Moses Shalom of Kremnitz, also Abu Aaron ben Samuel ha-Nasi of Babylonia, was a personage who was considered until the turn of the 20th century to be a fictitious creation of the Traditionists (Zunz) —those who, in their desire to find teachers and originators for everything, invented him in order to announce him as the father of prayer-interpretation and mysticism. But the publication of the Chronicle of Ahimaaz (written in 1054), by Adolf Neubauer, has demonstrated that Aaron is not altogether a creature of the imagination. It is true that legend has far more than history to say about him, and that only the barest outlines of his real career are accessible. Aaron was the son of a high dignitary in Babylonia, a certain Samuel, who, according to R. Eliezer of Worms, was a nasi (prince). In the Chronicle of Ahimaaz Aaron is said to have been a member of the house of Joab, which means that he was the son of an ab bet din, or chief of the court of justice; since in Jewish legend (Yer. Mak. ii. 31a; Tan., Mas'ey, 12) Joab is referred to as the chief justice in the reign of David. Disagreements between father and son, about the middle of the ninth century, caused Aaron to leave home. He traveled through Palestine to Italy, and landing at Gaeta went to Benevento. He did not stay there long, but went to Oria, in southern Italy, the center of Jewish life in Italy at that time. In that place he associated with the learned brothers, Shephatiah and Hananeel, sons of Amittai, under whose fostering influence he taught successfully—a vocation for which his profound knowledge of the Law, acquired in Babylonia, seemed especially to fit him. Aaron's activity bore fruit not only in Italy, but also beyond the borders of that country. Among his pupils were numbered Moses ben Kalonymus of Lucca, who, under one of Charlemagne's successors, went to the land of the Franks (Mentz), and there became the spiritual head of the Jews in that country. In spite of his success as a teacher in Italy, Aaron was seized by a secret longing for home; and seeing that the seed which he had carefully sown was bearing fruit, he considered himself entitled to return quietly to the land of his fathers. He embarked at Bari, to the great sorrow of his pupils and friends, among the latter being the ruler of the town, who tried to detain him by force. Nothing further is known of him. The cabalists considered him as one of the chief pillars of their mysticism, ascribing to him the cabalistic works, Niḳḳud and Pardes; but see Moses Botarel's commentary on Sefer Yeẓirah, i.1, 5; ii.4, and Moses Cordovero in his Pardes Rimonim. That he is considered to be identical with \"Aaron the Babylonian\" appears from the fact that Botarel (iv.2) describes the latter as making use of the ineffable name of God in working the most wonderful miracles in exactly the same way as Aaron ben Samuel is said, in the Chronicle of Ahimaaz, to have done. Heinrich Graetz's identification of this Aaron with the Aaron who was a candidate for the gaonate in 814—according to Isaac Halevi even earlier—is impossible upon chronological grounds. Aaron's activity in Italy is placed by the Chronicle half a century later than this date; in 870 he was still in Italy."

  "text" : "Aaron ben Samuel was a Hebrew author; born about 1620; flourished in Germany during the latter half of the seventeenth century. He published his \"Bet Aharon\" (Aaron's House) at Frankfort-on-the-Oder in 1690, being at that time of advanced age. This work, which received the approval of the greatest rabbinic authorities of the time, gives the places in the Talmud, the Midrashim, the Zohar, and many other rabbinic and cabalistic works where each verse of the Bible is either cited or explained. Although Aaron owes much to his predecessors (Aaron of Pesaro, Jacob Sasportas, Manasseh ben Israel, and others), his work, because of its completeness, is a monument of remarkable industry and wide reading. In the introduction he states that he spent ten long years at the work, although assisted by several scholars who lived with him for this purpose. In this introduction Aaron mentions three of his other works, which, however, seem to have been lost: (1) \"Sissera Torah,\" a midrashic commentary on Judges, iv. v.; (2) \"Ḥibbur Masora,\" a midrashic commentary on the Masora, of which he gives several specimens; and (3) \"Shaloaḥ Manot,\" a short commentary on the treatise Megillah. At the request of his wife, Aaron translated into Judæo-German the Midrash on the death of Moses, \"Peṭirat Mosheh Shem 'Olam,\" Frankfort-on-the-Oder, 1693. This book was very popular with the Jewish women of Poland and Russia, and has gone through many editions. Aaron must have reached a very great age; for in 1701 he published a commentary on \"Pereḳ Shirah,\" which is appended to a prayer-book printed that year in Berlin (see Stein-schneider, \"Cat. Bodl.\" Nos. 4000 and 4380)."

In 1924 he went into exile with his father Luigi, fleeing fascism , first to France , then to Luxembourg and finally to Liege ( Belgium ), working as a miner and mechanic, participating much in an anarchist group Liege and actively acting during the campaign support for Sacco and Vanzetti . In 1928 his mother, Giovanna Dall'Omo, who remained in Italy, wrote to him asking him to come back as he had been given the summons to serve the army; Angelo informed her by letter his refusal to return to Italy, declaring his libertarian ideals, his condemnation of anti-militarism and fascism. Giovanna, Catholic and traditionalist mentality, asked the local council chaplain, who apparently informed the fascist authorities and from this moment, Sbardellotto figured in police files as \"dangerous anarchist\". He returned clandestinely to Italy, but on 4 as June 1932, police arrested him in Piazza Venezia (Roma) carrying a false passport. It is registered you found a gun and two bombs attached to the body. During interrogation, he confessed that he had gone to Italy with the intention of attacking Mussolini, like Michele Schirru . After a judicial investigation day (in November and December of June of 1932 ), by the Attorney General Vincenzo Balzamo, he was prosecuted summarily. In just two hours he was sentenced to death by the Special Tribunal for the Defense of the Fascist State, chaired by Guido Cristini, for the \"crime of intent\" to assassinate \" Duce \". Sbardellotto refused to make a request for a pardon and was shot the next day, 17 of June of 1932 , at 5:45 am, in Bretta Forte (Roma), after rejecting church services. Previously, he was forced to witness the execution of militant anti - fascist Genovese Domenico Bovone. When he received the download shouted: \"Long live anarchy!\". His body was never delivered to the family and was buried in a secret place."

He is a Nigerian seasoned bureaucrat and administrator who served at the upper echelon of the Kaduna state civil service. He holds the traditional title of Cigarin Zazzau (The Conqueror) and District Head of Sabon Birnin Daji in Kaduna state. The 3rd and last child of late Hajiya Fatima Dalhatu (1905-1998) and the 7th to late Alkali Dalhatu Muhammad (1885-1956). His father was a respected and influential High Court Judge (Alkali) who had served at Anchau-Takalafiya and Makarfi in Kaduna state. After the death of Alhaji Shehu Ladan (former GMD NNPC and first Cigarin Zazzau), the Emir of Zazzau, Alhaji (Dr) Shehu Idris honoured him with the prestigious title. As District Head, he became a patron of both western and Islamic education as a means to succeed in modern Nigeria. He is a people oriented leader who think less of himself and more of the less privileged. After the death of his father in 1956, his elder brother Alkali Bashir Dalhatu became his guardian, while the late Maccido Dalhat CON (1932-2012) became his mentor, confidant and buffer. Cigarin Zazzau is blessed with 3 wives and 10 children."

  "text" : "Adolph Reuss (28 November 1804, Frankfurt am Main – 7 May 1878) was a German-American physician and zoologist, known for his work in the fields of herpetology and arachnology. He studied at the University of Göttingen, earning his medical doctorate in 1825. Following graduation, he served as a doctor in Frankfurt, also becoming involved with zoological research at the Senckenberg Museum. He later emigrated to the United States, where in 1834, he purchased a 200 acre farm near Shiloh, Illinois. In rural Illinois, he worked as a farmer, and in meantime, maintained a successful medical practice. At the time of his death, his estate had grown in size to 450 acres of land. Since 1829, he was a member of the Senckenbergische Naturforschende Gesellschaft, and in September 1856, he became a corresponding member of the Academy of Sciences of St. Louis. While serving at the Senckenberg Museum in Frankfurt, he edited a collection of manuscripts in the field of arachnology that was a catalyst towards the first Senckenberg publication (Museum Senckenbergianum). He described a number of herpetological species, such as Enhydris alternans, sometimes referred to as \"Reuss' water snake\"."

  "text" : "Aron Freimann (5 August 1871 at Filehne, Posen – 6 June 1948 at New York City) was a German librarian and historian. He was the son of Israel Meïr Freimann, and grandson, on his mother's side, of the chief rabbi of Altona, Jacob Ettlinger. He attended the Royal Gymnasium of Ostrowo (his father was the town's Jewish congregation rabbi) and in 1893 entered the University of Berlin (Ph. D., 1896), where he studied history and Oriental languages, devoting himself at the same time to the study of archival and library systems. Parallelly he took courses at the Rabbinical Seminary at Berlin. From 1897 he was chief of the Hebrew department at the Stadtbibliotek Frankfurt, and under his direction the library in Frankfurt upon Main assembled one of the richest collections of Judaica and Hebraica in the world. He retired in 1933 when the Nazis came to power and immigrated to the United States in 1938. Between 1939 and 1945 he served as consultant in bibliography to the New York Public Library. Since 1900 he was one of the editors of Zeitschrift für Hebräische Bibliographie. He was the author of Die Isagoge des Porphyrius in den Syrischen Uebersetzungen (1896), and Geschichte der Israelitischen Gemeinde Ostrowo (1896). To the \"Ḳobeẓ al-Yad,\" a collective work published by the Mekize Nirdamim Society, he contributed articles on the history of the Jews in Prague."

  "text" : "Arthur Vincent Roth (December 4, 1891 – October 10, 1950) was an American long-distance runner who won the 1916 Boston Marathon and competed in the men's marathon at the 1920 Summer Olympics. Roth was born in Dorchester, Massachusetts. In 1912 and 1913, he competed primarily in 10-mile road races. Roth competed in the 1913 New York Evening Mail Modified Marathon and placed 31st out of 1,500 runners. In 1914, he finished fifth at the Boston Marathon and was reported to have been from Roxbury, Massachusetts. Representing the Mohawk Athletic Club, he won a five-mile race put on the Bronxdale Athletic Club in February 1915 (27:04). Three months later in May 1915, Roth finished fifth in a ten-mile contest through the streets of Jersey City and Hoboken that was sponsored by The Jersey Journal. By 1916, Roth was reported to be a \"tracer in an architect's office\". On February 22 of that year, he won a 25-mile-marathon in Brooklyn, New York in a time of 2:48:40. Representing the Dorchester Club at the 1916 Boston Marathon two months later, Roth became the first Boston resident to win the event. He was given a silver punch bowl for his victory. The bowl was eventually loaned to the Boston Athletic Association after a BAA intern observed it being used to hold beer cans at a party. In February 1917, Roth finished third in a 25-mile race in Brooklyn, New York (2:43:35). Later that year, he finished fourth in a 25.5 mile race in Brockton, Massachusetts. The 1920 Boston Marathon served as one of the selection races for the United States Olympic Team at the 1920 Summer Olympics in Antwerp, Belgium. Roth, this time competing for the St. Alphonsus Association, secured a spot on the team by finishing second to Panayotis \"Peter\" Trivoulidas of Greece in a time of 2:30:31. At the Olympic marathon on August 22, he lined-up with competitors from 17 nations, but failed to finish the race after dropping out 14.5 miles into the race. On October 11, 1950, Roth died at his home in Natick, Massachusetts."

Musician Mitch Miller hired him for the Green Briar development in the town of Somers, New York. De Vido's design work was part of the Weekend Utopia: The Modern Beach House on Eastern Long Island, 1960-1973, exhibition at Guild Hall in East Hampton. The book Alfredo De Vido (Ten Houses) by Michael J. Crosbie,Richard J. Wertheimer highlights some of his residential work. De Vido was the architect for the renovation of the circular Theaterama at Queens Theatre in Park, originally part of Philip Johnson's construction project for the 1964 World's Fair. The theatre was once decorated with the artworks including those of Andy Warhol and Robert Indiana. The circular theater was converted according to De Vido's plans into the 476-seat Queens Theater in the Park, a wonderful success according to Borough President Claire Shulman of Queens, who said she was an attendee at the 1939 World's Fair (held at the same site) as a little girl. De Vido's addition of four floors to the Brinckerhoff Carriage House in 1992, a victorian architecture building, was somewhat controversial for destroying the mansard roof. The work was done for the Allen-Stevenson School."

  "text" : "Alexander Thibeau was an American long-distance runner who, along with Albert Corey and Sidney Hatch, was one of Chicago's most prominent marathoners in the early 1900s. Thibeau was one of twelve athletes selected to represent the United States in the marathon at the 1908 Summer Olympics in London, but he did not start the race. Thibeau placed in the top three of the Missouri Athletic Club's All-Western Marathon from 1906 through 1909. He finished second to Sidney Hatch in 1906 (2:47:22) and 1907 (2:48:40), third to Hatch and Joseph Forshaw in 1908 (2:37:46), and second to Joseph Erxleben in 1909 (2:55:25). On June 30, 1906, 50,000 spectators saw Thibeau finish three minutes behind Thomas J. Hicks to place second in a marathon at an Amateur Athletic Union meet in Chicago. From 1905 to the early 1920s, the Illinois Athletic Club of Chicago organized what has been recognized as an early precursor to the Chicago Marathon. On October 1, 1906, Thibeau finished fifth after he and Albert Corey were expected to contend for victory in the 25-mile marathon from Ravinia Park in Highland Park to Grant Park, Chicago. In the following year's event, William Lindquist led the field of 37 runners but faltered after \"hitting the wall\". Thibeau employed a steady pace to overtake Lindquist and claimed victory by finishing six minutes ahead of Corey in a time of 3:00:10. On May 2, 1908 in St. Louis, Missouri, Thibeau placed third behind Hatch and Forshaw with a 2:37:46 performance in a 25-mile marathon to earn a spot on the United States Olympic Team. He finished third in the 15-mile St. Louis Marathon on June 6, 1908. The official report of the 1908 Summer Olympics indicates that Thibeau was one of twelve athletes selected to represent the United States in the marathon held on July 24, 1908, but there is no record that he participated in the event. Thibeau competed in a marathon in Chicago won by Hatch on January 16, 1909, then was reported to have broken Matthew Maloney's amateur indoor marathon record on four weeks later in the same city. His time of 2:52:51 was noted to be two minutes faster than the mark set by Maloney. Thibeau finished second to Hatch at another indoor marathon in March 1909 at Riverview Rink in Chicago. On May 24, 1909, Thibeau turned professional in order to compete for $10,000 in prize money at an \"international marathon derby\" in Chicago on featuring eight of the \"world's best long distance runners\". In addition to Thibeau, the field of eight included Fred Appleby of England; Johnny Hayes and Matt Maloney of the United States; Canadian Indians Tom Longboat and Fred Simpson; Henry St. Yves of France; and John Svanberg of Sweden. On May 29, 1909, the 26 mile 385 yard race was won by Svanberg in a time of 2:48:12, followed by Hayes, Appleby, Maloney, and Simpson. Thibeau finished sixth ahead of St. Yves and Longboat who dropped out of the race.

He was president of Law Asia from 1991 to 1993. As of February 2009 he was Associate President of the Bar Association of India.He has argued in the Supreme Court of India on a \"pro bono\" basis in many Public Interest Litigations (PILs), some involving high-level corruption, as an \"Amicus Curiae\".In 2004 he was a member of the committee on Water Resources Law of the International Law Association.He has been appointed by the government to help resolve Cauvery Water Disputes. In the late 1980s, Divan was one of the founders of the Centre for Public Interest Litigation, a Non-governmental organization that conducts litigation on matters of public interest. The first president was Justice V. M. Tarkunde, who was also the founder of the People's Union for Civil Liberties.Other founder members were senior advocates including Fali Sam Nariman, Shanti Bhushan, Rajinder Sachar and Colin Gonsalves. In February 2005, Prashant Bhushan and Anil B. Divan were counsel for the Centre for Public Interest Litigation (CPIL) seeking quashing of the CVC Act, 2003, which requires the CBI to obtain permission from the Union government before registering corruption cases against senior bureaucrats. Bhushan argued that the act violated the basic rights of citizens and was counter to the rule of law. The Supreme Court referred the question to a constitution bench of five judges.Divan was a member of the Committee on Judicial Accountability.Commenting on the Judges Enquiry Bill, 2006, he said \"The aforementioned new bill is worse than the old Judges Inquiry Act and it needs to be scrapped in toto. This new bill is nothing but a sham\".Divan's son Shyam Divan is also a lawyer practising in the Supreme Court. His daughter-in-law, Madhavi Goradia Divan is an author of books on law and also a practising lawyer."

  "text" : "Antoine de La Fosse (alias Sieur d'Aubigny; 1653 or 1658 – November 2, 1708) Premier gentilhomme de la Chambre, was a French playwright who wrote four tragedies, and was the last French author of tragedies to make a name for himself at the end of the 17th century. The son of a goldsmith and the nephew of painter Charles de La Fosse, Antoine served first as the secretary for the Envoy of France to Florence. La Fosse was then attached to the Marquis Francois Joseph Créquy (1662–1702) who died in the Battle of Luzzara on August 15, 1702, before he became secretary for the 2nd Duke of Aumont Louis-Marie-Victor d'Aumont (1632–1704). La Fosse translated the odes of Anacreon to French (Traduction nouvelle des odes d'Anacreon, sur l'original grec) in 1704, and popular with contemporaries the second edition was published in 1706. German classicist Johann Friedrich Christ (1701–1756) praised the French verse translation. La Fosse's chef d'œuvre Manlius Capitolinus (1698) about Marcus Manlius Capitolinus (died 384 BCE), was imitated from the English dramatist Thomas Otway's play Venice Preserv'd, who in turn had taken his plot from César Vichard de Saint-Réal's Conjuration des Espagnols contre la République de Venise en l'Année M. DC. XVIII (1674). La Fosse's later plays were not as successful, but according to theater historian Phyllis Hartnoll in The Oxford Companion to the Theatre, many of his contemporaries thought he might have rivalled Jean Racine had he begun his dramatic career earlier. His collected plays were popular for more than a century and were re-published multiple times in the 18th and 19th century, e.g. in two quarto volumes in 1747 (Nouvelle edition - \"new edition\"), and in 1811 in two octavo volumes. Among his other works of elegies, odes, epigrams, poems, and cantatas is an ode written in Italian, a language he became fluent in while in Florence, which earned him a membership of Accademia degli Apatisti. La Fosse is interred in St-Gervais-et-St-Protais, Paris."

  "text" : "Abraham (Abe) Ajay (1919–1998) was an artist who was best known for his artistic contributions for The New Masses magazine during the late 1930s and early 1940s. and also for his creative use of reliefs made of found objects during the 1960s and beyond.Abraham Ajay was born in Altoona, Pennsylvania in 1919 to Syrian immigrant parents. Ajay grew up working at his father’s candy store and bar in Altoona until he graduated from high school. From an early age, Ajay had a passion for art and sought to harness his artistic abilities when he made the decision to move to New York City to study at the Art Students League of New York, and the American Artists School in Manhattan. While studying in New York, Ajay became close friends with Ad Reinhardt, the art director for the left-wing culture magazine The New Masses, who inspired him to begin working for the magazine. Ajay’s contributions during the late 1930s and early 1940s to New Masses were significant. Along with Reinhardt, Ajay helped to shape the artistic direction of New Masses during a period where the magazine incurred financial hardships. Ajay’s contributions of covers and cartoons helped to give New Masses a strong artistic presence despite the overall decline of the magazine during the period. A lack of funding helped precipitate Ajay’s departure from New Masses and as the years went on, his support for Communism waned. In the 1960s Ajay began to produce reliefs made of found objects. Later his often intricate constructions, created from tooled wood, gypsum and cast plastics, reminded may art historians of the sculptures of Louise Nevelson. In addition, many critics believe that Ajay’s work illustrates religious architecture. It was during this time period where Ajay achieved considerable acclaim within the art community. Ajay was a professor of visual arts at State University of New York at Purchase, N.Y from 1978 until his health began deteriorating towards the mid to late 1990s. Following a move back to Bethel, Pennsylvania, Ajay died of a cerebral hemorrhage in 1998 at the age of 78. He was survived by his wife, Betty Raymond. Ajay’s work is contained in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in Manhattan and the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden in Washington. In addition, Ajay’s work with New Masses is available in existing copies of the magazine found throughout the country."

In 1903 he earned his medical doctorate from the University of Vienna, later working as an assistant at the University Kinderklinik (children's hospital). In 1924 he became an associate professor at the university, and during the following year founded the children's section of the Kaiser-Franz-Josef-Spital. In 1930 he relocated to the University of Graz as chair of the children's hospital. From 1934 he was director of the Kinderklinik Glanzing in Vienna. Reuss is known for improvements made in the field of pediatrics, especially in regards to the newborn. He strove for recognition of pediatrics as a separate medical specialty and was a pioneer of Austrian social pediatrics. Among his written works was the highly regarded Die Krankheiten des Neugeborenen (1914), later being translated into English as \"The Diseases of the Newborn\". Other noted works by Reuss include: \n*  Die Ernährung des Neugeborenen, 1925 - Nourishment for the newborn. \n*  Die Aufzucht der Fruhgeborenen und Lebensschwachen Kinder, 1925 - On premature and underdeveloped children. \n*  Säuglingsernährung, 1929 - Infant nutrition. \n*  Säuglingskrankheiten, 1935 - Infant diseases."

  "text" : "Albert Loren Rhoton, Jr., (November 18, 1932 – February 21, 2016) was an American neurosurgeon and a professor specializing in microsurgical neuroanatomy. He developed and introduced a number of microsurgical techniques that improved the safety and effectiveness of neurosurgery, including the use of the surgical microscope in neurosurgery. He also designed many of the commonly used of microneurosurgical instruments, which bear his name. Such tools in use worldwide include the Rhoton Micro Dissectors designed for delicate work dissecting tumors from vascular and neural tissues. A pioneer in the field of neuroanatomy, Rhoton was a leader in vastly expanding knowledge of the anatomy of the human brain. His microscopic studies using the surgical microscope brought into focus the brain's intricate blood vessel network and revealed previously unknown connections between vital centers of the brain. At the University of Florida, he built the world's largest collection of three-dimensional images of the brain and published the world's best selling neurosurgical textbook, \"Cranial Anatomy and Surgical Approaches,\" both of which serve as guides for neurosurgeons across the globe.  He is internationally recognized as the \"father of microscopic neurosurgery\" for his anatomical studies which provided the anatomic basis for the development of modern neurosurgical techniques and revolutionized surgical approaches to many neurological disorders including those for acoustic neuromas and skull base tumors."

  "text" : "Anton Rolandsson Martin (3 August 1729 at Mijntenhoff Manor, Reval – 30 January 1785 in Åbo) was a Swedish botanist. He was son of Roland Martin, who later became an appeals court judge, and was born when the family was visiting friends in current Estonia. In the mid-1730s, the family moved to Åbo in present-day Finland, as the father received a position as secretary at the appeals court (hovrätt) there. Martin was enrolled at Royal Academy of Åbo in 1745, where he spent time as musician and a music teacher, while at the same time doing botanical excursions and discovering several plants previously unknown in Finland. He worked as a tutor in Stockholm 1753-1756. After coming into contact with Pehr Wargentin, the permanent secretary of Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, and presenting some papers to the academy, he was enrolled as an apprentice student at the academy in 1756. He also enrolled at Uppsala University 1756, and received a bachelor's degree in medicine in Uppsala 1761. In Uppsala, Carl Linnaeus was teaching, and he was sufficiently impressed with Martin to select him to travel with a whaling ship to collect specimen from the Arctic region and become a pioneering Arctic researcher. In April 1758, Martin left Gothenburg on a whaling ship belonging to the Swedish Greenland Company. The three-month trip went as far north as the 80th parallel, encountered difficult weather conditions, and Martin was only ashore for a few hours, on some small islands to the west of Spitsbergen. The trip did however produce valuable weather observations, and collections of sea-living animals and birds. In 1760, he did a trip to Norway's west coast, and did collections of sea-living animals using Bergen as a base. He also studied causes of leper and migrations of herring. In 1761, after his degree in medicine, he moved to Stockholm intending to finish his education and at the same time practice as a physician. In the autumn he became ill, and after months of pain he was forced have his right leg amputated after it had been attacked by gangrene. He thereafter abandoned his plans for a higher degree, and in 1763 went to Finland, where he lived on small means in different cities but from 1770 in Åbo, receiving some financial support from friends. He continued to make scientific observations and experiments, in particular relating to physiology."

Morrison was one of four brothers who were all golf professionals in the 1920s, 30s, 40s and 50s. Morrison's teachings are credited with helping many golfers reduce their handicap. Morrison is mentioned in Bob Hope's Confessions of a Hooker; My Lifelong Love Affair With Golf, First 100 Years; Golf in America, and Golf In the Ozarks. Morrison was one of the first to use high-speed photographs to analyze golf swings from all possible angles. Through this analysis, Morrison was able to develop the \"Morrison Swing\". Morrison wrote two books that are now out of print; one of which introduced the concept of centrifugal force in golf swings. His other book called Better Golf Without Practice contained instruction on visualization techniques. The adoption of the Morrison swing pattern helped to bring about an improvement in scoring in major tournaments during the 30's, 40's and 50's. His methods have influenced many modern golf instructors."

  "text" : "Andrea Postacchini (1788–1862) was an Italian violin maker born in Fermo, known as the \"Stradivari\" of the Marches (a region of central Italy). According to the most recent research, Andrea Postacchini son of Amico, came from a wealthy, religious family of farm workers. It was decided that he should follow an ecclesiastical career and so the young Postacchini was sent to a monastery in Fermo. There he met a priest who made violins using primitive tools. Andrea became fascinated with this craft and upon his departure (age of 28), he decided to become a violinmaker. Although he was self-taught Postacchini produced many fine instruments, all with elegant archings. His output was diverse and included not only bowed-string instruments but also guitars and bows and restoration work. Postacchini's choice of wood was excellent. The tonal quality of his wood is excellent as well and shows that he was not only a brilliant craftsman but that he also had a good understanding of the acoustical properties required. During his lifetime, Postacchini received great acclaim at exhibitions and fairs. But perhaps his greatest compliment occurred at an exhibition in Fermo in 1869 when his work was acknowledged as a unique continuation in direction and style of Antonio Stradivari, an accolade which gained him the title \"Stradivari of the Marches\".According to the archives in the Santa Maria delle Vergini church in Fermo, there was only one Andrea Postacchini and he was born on 30 December 1786 in Fermo, a hilltop town near the east coast in Italy's marches region. Postacchini spent his life in Fermo and died there on 3 February 1862, age 76. Raphaele Postacchini (1823-1892) was Andrea's son and pupil. In 1993, The Andrea Postacchini International Violin Competition was organized (in Fermo, Italy) to carry on the legacy of the genius of Andrea Postacchini the \"Stradivari of the Marches\""

He taught philosophy and dogma at the theological seminary in Timişoara before becoming rector. In 1948, following the advent of the communist regime, he was named auxiliary bishop of Timișoara and was secretly consecrated in Bucharest. Together with Bishop Augustin Pacha and other prominent Catholics, he was arrested, given a show trial and sentenced to life imprisonment. Released in 1964, he was not allowed to perform the duties of a bishop until the fall of the regime, instead having to work as a chaplain in Timișoara. In 1990, Pope John Paul II named him titular archbishop of Ressiana. He died in 2003."

Upon his return to Romania, he was named secretary to Archbishop Francisc Xaveriu Hornstein and dean of students at the seminary. After a short time as parish priest at the Bucharest Bărăția and at the Craiova parish, he was named head of a school in Bucharest in 1918. In 1920, he was consecrated bishop at Saint Joseph's Cathedral and was installed in Iaşi. He reopened the seminary there that had shut down due to World War I. In 1921, the parishes of Bessarabia, recently united with Romania, were incorporated into his diocese. Following the retirement of Archbishop Raymund Netzhammer in 1924, he was named Archbishop of Bucharest. He was also interim Apostolic Administrator of Iaşi until 1925, when Mihai Robu was named bishop. He remained in office until retiring in 1948 and being named titular bishop of Nicopolis. During 1949-1953, the new communist regime forced him to live at the Franciscan monastery in Orăştie. Twice, with the authorities' approval, he was able to go to Alba Iulia to ordain priests. He was allowed to return to Bucharest in late 1953. He died soon after, and was buried in the Catholic chapel at Bellu cemetery."

  "text" : "Alfred Loritz (born 24 April 1902 in Munich – died 14 April 1979 in Vienna) was a German lawyer and politician who briefly rose to prominence in the immediate aftermath of the Second World War. A Munich lawyer, the Catholic Loritz was a right-wing opponent of the Nazi regime and in early 1939 he made contact with a group of Bavarian monarchists in an ultimately abortive attempt to foment discontent. Ultimately he would spend most of the war in exile in Switzerland. In 1945 he established his own political party, the Wirtschaftliche Aufbau-Vereinigung (WAV), and soon gained a reputation as a demagogic speaker. A believer in a strong federal Germany, Loritz's fiery rhetoric attracted attention both in Germany itself and from the occupiers, with some even suggesting that he might prove to be \"a new Hitler\". However whilst he belonged to the political right Loritz's populism lacked a strong ideological basis and he appealed mainly to internal refugees who saw him as a strong voice for their defence. He was also a strong advocate of denazification and under the Bavarian government of Hans Ehard he was chosen to head up a special ministry for that purpose. Always an at best loose organisation, the WAV won twelve seats in the Bundestag in the 1949 election but by this point had already largely disintegrated as an organisation and saw their vote collapse in the state elections of 1950 and the municipal elections of 1952, by which point their vote share fell to 0.3%. In the Bundestag the party quickly fell apart, with four deputies breaking away in October 1950 to link up with the Centre Party. This was followed by six more in December 1951 leaving WAV to join the German Party along with a seventh who joined the Deutsche Rechtspartei. Loritz was thus left as the sole member in the Bundestag and, although a handful of far right independents linked up with him in 1953, his influence was largely gone. In the late 1950s Loritz sought to relaunch his political career in Bremen but before this could take off he was arrested on charges of incitement to perjury. Loritz however escaped to Austria where he was eventually granted political asylum. He would live out his days there, dying in a Vienna hospital in 1979."

The record adds that the blessings conferred upon him by these rabbis bore fruit, for shortly afterward, by a happy accident, he discovered a treasure. His name was not permitted to fall into oblivion, and for centuries later the name \"Abba Judan\" seems to have been applied in Palestine to every unusually benevolent man.

  "text" : "Abba Mari ben Eligdor (also called Sen (or Senior) Astruc de Noves) was a distinguished Talmudist, an eminent philosopher, and an able physicist and astronomer who flourished in the fourteenth century in Salon-de-Provence. In 1335, he was already very old (Samuel of Marseilles, in \"Écrivains Juifs,\" p. 562, according to which the note in \"Rev. Ét. Juives,\" ix. 59, must be corrected). Of the many writings of Abba Mari, who, according to his contemporary, Isaac de Lattes, wrote commentaries on the Pentateuch, Job, parts of the Talmud, and Pirḳe de-Rabbi Eliezer, as well as works on physics, logic, and metaphysics, merely fragments are extant, and these in manuscript only. His commentary on Job is found in several European libraries; it is not a commentary in an exegetical or historical sense, but is full of philosophical disquisitions upon the Biblical theodicy. The existence of Job is doubted by Abba Mari, as by some of the Talmudic rabbis. He says that, at any rate, the book bearing his name was not written by Job, as some authorities in the Talmud admit, but by Moses. Job's four friends represent in their personalities four different views of evil in the world. Eliphaz, representative of tradition, denies altogether the reality of evil, in agreement with Deut. xxxii. 4. Bildad, on the other hand, does not deny its reality, but holds, as-if he had been the loyal disciple of the old rabbis and Motazilites, that God allows the just to suffer here in order to reward them the more in the future life. Zophar, too, considers evil a reality; with the Ascharites, with whom many rabbis agree, he insists on man's ignorance of the divine will, which finite man ought not to investigate. Elihu is of the same opinion as Eliphaz, but with the difference that what Eliphaz accepts as a matter of faith, Elihu demonstrates philosophically. It can thus be seen that Abba Mari was a loyal student of Maimonides, and that, like him, he considered revelation and true philosophy as identical. Whether a philosophical and allegorical commentary on the Song of Songs, in manuscript in the Cambridge and Oxford libraries and ascribed to him, is really his, or should becredited to Moses of Narbonne, with whom Abba Mari is elsewhere confounded, is uncertain. The same doubt holds concerning the Hebrew translation of Gazzali's \"Tendencies of Philosophers,\" which is ascribed to Abba Mari, but possibly also belongs to the aforesaid Moses. But there is no reason for Steinschneider's doubt concerning a Munich manuscript, containing the introduction to the first book of Euclid, with the superscription, \"Written by Abba Mari, philosopher and teacher of truth.\"; it certainly belongs to our Abba Mari, and the words Abba Mari are not to be translated \"My Lord and Father,\" for these two words would otherwise have their proper place at the beginning and not at the end of the sentence.

  "text" : "Abba b. Martha was a Babylonian scholar of the end of the third century and beginning of the fourth. He seems to have been in poor circumstances. Once he incurred a debt to the resh galuta (exilarch), which he could not repay, and only by disguising himself did he at the time escape arrest for it. Later he was apprehended and sorely pressed for payment; but when the exilarch discovered that his debtor was a rabbinical scholar, he released him. His mother, Martha, seems to have been in easy circumstances; for, when Abba was bitten by a rabid dog and, in accordance with contemporary therapeutics, was obliged to drink through a tube of copper, Martha substituted one of gold. Notwithstanding his pecuniary straits, Abba did not take advantage of the Biblical and Talmudic law, according to which the Sabbatical year cancels all debts. He once owed some money to Rabbah, and paid it in the year of release, using the form of a donation."

  "text" : "Abba Mari ben Isaac of St Gilles was a prominent French Jewish official who flourished about the middle of the twelfth century, and lived at Saint-Gilles, near Lunel, in Languedoc. According to Benjamin of Tudela, who visited the Jewish community of that place, Abba Mari held the office of bailli (magistrate) about 1165, having been appointed by Raymond V, who was friendly to the Jews. The monarch made St. Gilles the second capital of his country. That a Jew was in those times chosen to so high an office is a fact of some importance, as it goes far to show the position which the Jews occupied in southern France previous to the war with the Albigenses. The war lasted until 1229. Some scholars pretend to see in this Abba Mari the father of Isaac ben Abba Mari, the author of the 'Iṭṭur. In this work Isaac refers to his father as a prominent Talmudist, from which circumstance it is inferred that the subject of this sketch was not only a high official but also a Talmudic scholar—a deduction which has been completely set aside by Gross."

Abba, however, steadfastly refused to yield to this, and showed so much courage that the Roman admiringly exclaimed: \"If you had eaten, I should have killed you. If you be a Jew, be a Jew; if a heathen, a heathen!\" (Yer. Sheb. iv. 35a et seq.). Tanhuma bar Abba relates another anecdote concerning a pious tailor at Rome (Gen.

  "text" : "Augustin Pacha (November 26, 1870—November 4, 1954) was a Romanian cleric, the first bishop of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Timișoara. Born into a Banat Swabian family in Măureni (Moritzfeld), Caraş-Severin County, he was the twelfth of thirteen children and his father was a shoemaker. Following theological studies at the diocesan seminary in Timișoara, he was ordained a priest in 1893 in the city's Roman Catholic cathedral. In 1927 he was consecrated bishop at the Timișoara cathedral, becoming titular bishop of Lebedus. Three years later, he became the first Bishop of Timișoara, a diocese succeeding the former one at Cenad, the last bishop having departed Romania in 1923, leaving Pacha as Apostolic Administrator. In February 1934, alarmed by rising Nazi sentiment among the Swabians of his diocese, he visited Adolf Hitler, receiving a polite reply to his complaints but no concrete action. Beginning in 1948, the authorities of the new communist regime took a series of repressive measures: abrogating the concordat; abolishing Pacha's diocese and forcing him to retire; shutting down monasteries and religious schools; seizing the seminary and its assets, as well as the bishop's palace; arresting and torturing numerous priests. Pacha made public a letter written by the Pope that denounced communism, and also rejected the regime's attempt to fashion a compliant Catholic Church, making him the subject of close supervision by the Securitate secret police. Arrested in June 1950 in Caraşova, where he planned to take a vacation, he was briefly interrogated at Reşiţa before being incarcerated in Bucharest and at Sighet prison. At a show trial involving other clergymen in Bucharest in September 1950, he was accused of being an American and Vatican spy and of Nazi sympathies, his visit to Hitler being brought up. He was sentenced to eighteen years' imprisonment and ten years' deprivation of civic rights, and was fined 880,000 lei and charged 306,000 lei damages against the state. Hoping to avoid the creation of a martyr and to draw public sympathy, the authorities released him in June 1954. Pacha, seriously ill with cancer, returned to Timișoara the following month and was placed under house arrest in a parish house. He died several months later and was buried in the crypt of the cathedral. He was a life member of the Romanian Senate between 1939 and 1944."

Akana was of Hapa (mixed) ancestry, with a Chinese father and Hawaiian mother. He earned a bachelor's degree in pedagogy at Hartford Seminary in Connecticut, where he was president of his graduating class. At the October 1906 annual meeting of the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions, Akana delivered a speech in which he stated that his decision to enter the Christian ministry was a direct result of the groundwork laid by the Christian missionaries who set up churches in Hawaii decades before his birth. In encouraging the board to continue its work in Hawaii, the twenty-two-year-old Akana cited the Sabbath being broken in Hawaii by baseball and golf. In 1921, Akana appeared before the United States House of Representatives hearings on \"Public Protection of Maternity and Infancy\", where he delivered a lengthy report on the subject matter as it related to the Territory of Hawaii."

His family were Latter-day Saints and named his after the Book of Mormon prophet Alma. Eldredge came to Utah Territory with his parents in 1847 and in 1849 settled in American Fork, Utah. In 1861 he moved to a place along the Weber River named Eldrege's Springs after him. In 1863 he married Marinda M. Merril. They had a total of six children. In 1866 as a result of Utah's Black Hawk War the leaders of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) instructed the settlers along the upper Weber River to move together in a central location. Eldredge followed this advice and thus became one of the first settlers of Coalville, Utah. The following year he was elected to the city council there. From 1868 to 1871 Eldredge served as an LDS Church missionary in Great Britain. At various times Eldredge worked in railroad building, brick making and as a store owner. He was elected mayor of Coalville in 1874. In 1878 he was elected Summit County prosecutor and a member of the Utah Territorial Board of Trade. In 1883 he was elected a Probate Judge. He was a member of the Utah Constitutional Conventions of 1882, 1887 and 1895, the last one seeing its constitution actually enacted with Utah finally gaining statehood. In 1893 Eldredge was elected to the Territorial Legislature. He ran as a Republican for the United States Congress in 1898 but lost to B. H. Roberts. From 1877 to 1901 Eldredge served as a counselor to William W. Cluff in the presidency of the Summit Stake of the LDS Church."

  "text" : "Abraham Archibald Anderson (1847–1940) was an American artist, rancher and philanthropist. Anderson was born in New Jersey as one of ten children of William Anderson (1814–1887), a civil engineer turned Dutch Reformed Church Reverend, and Sarah Louise Ryerson (1818–1907). After an initial career as a businessman, on June 15, 1877 Anderson married Elizabeth Milbank, the reform-minded daughter of the investor Jeremiah Milbank and heiress to his considerable fortune. Beginning in the mid-1870s, Anderson studied art in Paris, first with Léon Bonnat, then under Alexandre Cabanel, Fernand Cormon, Auguste Rodin, and Raphaël Collin. Anderson developed a reputation for his portraits. His 1889 portrait of Thomas Alva Edison is in the National Portrait Gallery in Washington D.C. In 1890, Anderson organized the American Art Association in Paris, a beneficial mutual-aid society for American art students. He was its president until 1912; it lasted until 1932. In 1900, Anderson commissioned the 10-story Bryant Park Studios building from the New York society architect Charles A. Rich. Situated on the south side of Bryant Park, its generous windows and high-ceilings were designed specifically for artists. Anderson maintained his own suite on the top floor until the end of his life. Bryant Park Studios became immediately popular, and tenants included John LaFarge, Frederick Stuart Church, Winslow Homer, Augustus Saint-Gaudens and William Merritt Chase. The building still stands. Returning to the United States in the summers, Anderson bought land in northwestern Wyoming and developed it into the Palette Ranch. He personally designed William \"Buffalo Bill\" Cody's guest ranch Pahaska Tepee, and his own home, Anderson Lodge. That lodge became the first administrative headquarters for the Yellowstone Forest Reserve in 1902, as President Theodore Roosevelt named Anderson as the first Special Superintendent of Forest Reserves. Anderson played a significant role in the preservation and development of the Yellowstone region. His autobiography, Experiences and Impressions, was published in 1933. Anderson's daughter, Eleanor Campbell, would found the Judson Health Center."

Kay ?) leafing through prints beside a somewhat Bohemian-looking man who is admiring a vase.In April 1896 a number of his drawings and book plates were exhibited in the Champs de Mars Salon.A reviewer in 1902 placed Andrew Kay Womrath in what he called the \"Pictorial\" group.Some of his colored woodcuts are now held in the British Museum."

The messages were deemed offensive to the King and Queen of Thailand, as proscribed by section 112 of the Criminal Code of Thailand and the law on computer-related offences. Having been found guilty of four charges in November 2011, he was sentenced by the Criminal Court to four consecutive five-year terms, for a total of twenty years in prison. His death in prison during the first year of his sentence attracted national and international criticism, prompting a national discussion of Thailand's lèse majesté law."

  "text" : "Albert Kinross (4 July 1870 – 19 March 1929) was an English journalist, magazine editor and writer of novels, stories and articles. Kinross was born in London in 1870. He worked and published in many of the most popular periodicals of his day including the Boston Evening Transcript (as the London correspondent 1896–98), London Outlook (as associate editor 1898–1900), London Morning Post (as dramatic critic for two years); as well as articles in the Century, Harper's Magazine, The Pall Mall Magazine, Overland Monthly, New Outlook, The Windsor Magazine, Atlantic Monthly and The Strand Magazine. He was a special correspondent in Russia during the Russo-Japanese War in 1905–6, an investigative reporter during turn of the century debates over immigration, art critic, book reviewer and political reporter. In 1907 he gave up journalism and became a full-time novelist. During WWI, Kinross returned to his roots in journalism serving as a captain in France and the Middle East, where he set up the Balkan News and Palestine News for the military. In 1917, he wrote a piece for the Atlantic Monthly called \"Torpedoed\" in which he described his experience aboard a ship that was torpedoed and sunk by a German submarine. Kinross died of pneumonia on 19 March 1929 at Tunbridge Wells."

  "text" : "Alan McCullough (July 1981 – 28 May 2003) was a leading Northern Irish loyalist and a member of the Ulster Defence Association (UDA). He served as the organisation's military commander for the West Belfast Brigade's notorious C Company which was then headed by Johnny Adair. McCullough was suspected of having organised the killing of South East Antrim brigadier John Gregg in February 2003. Gregg was a rival of Adair's who enjoyed much popularity among loyalists on account of his attempted assassination of Sinn Féin president Gerry Adams in 1984. The killing provoked outrage amongst the other UDA leaders and as a result Adair and his associates, including McCullough, were forced to leave Northern Ireland. McCullough returned to Belfast in April 2003 but a month later he disappeared from his home in the company of two men. On 5 June his body was found in a shallow grave in Mallusk. The UDA claimed responsibility for the killing using their cover name Ulster Freedom Fighters (UFF)."

  "text" : "August Carl Helmholz was an American nuclear physicist known for his contributions to high energy particle physics. Helmholz was born in Evanston, Illinois on May 24, 1915. He attended the Shattuck School military academy in Faribault, Minnesota, following which he went to Harvard University for his undergraduate education. In 1936, Helmholz won a fellowship to study at the Cambridge University for one year. On the advice of his family neighbour and future Nobel laureate Luis Alvarez, Helmolz moved to the University of California, Berkeley for his graduate education. At Berkeley, he worked with Ernest Lawrence and Edwin McMillan at the Berkeley Radiation Laboratory (which later became the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory) on radioactive materials. In 1942, Helmholz worked with the Manhattan Project for using cyclotron magnets to separate uranium which was later used in the development of the first atomic bomb. Helmholz joined the UC Berkeley physics department as an assistant professor in 1943. He worked on synchrotron accelerators to study the properties of high-energy particle interactions. Helmholz along with Burton Moyer made one of the first measurements of resonances in subatomic physics in the pion-nucleon interaction. Over his career at Berkeley, Helmholz supervised more than sixty doctoral students. He also served as the chair of the UC Berkeley physics department from 1955 to 1962."

The work involved the completion of 250 rooms in anticipation of the royal family moving into the Palace. Masreliez also headed the decoration work at the Drottningholm Palace and the theatre at Drottningholm, and produced work in other palaces and manors in the vicinity of Stockholm, and in the Cathedrals of Gothenburg and Uppsala. Masreliez was for many years responsible for the training of young artists at the new Academy of Arts, a position that came with that of royal ornamental sculptor (kunglig ornamentsbildhuggare). When he retired in 1776, he was succeeded in both positions by his son Jean Baptiste Masreliez. He was elected a Fellow of the Academy in 1773. Another son of his was Louis Masreliez. Both sons were to continue his work on the Royal Palace."

  "text" : "Arthur S. Vernay (May 11, 1877 - October 25, 1960) was a noted English art and antiques dealer, decorator, big game hunter and naturalist explorer. Born in Weymouth, England, Vernay immigrated to New York early in the twentieth century, and found a job as an elevator operator at a furniture store known as A.J. Crawfords. After working there briefly, Vernay started his own shop in 1906, called Arthur S. Vernay, Inc. and located at 1 East 45th Street, near Madison Avenue. There he sold antiques and decorative arts to a number of important and influential New Yorkers including Ogden Codman, Jr., Elsie de Wolfe, Sir Charles Carrick Allom, Consuelo Vanderbilt, Francis Patrick Garvan, Benjamin Altman, Solomon R. Guggenheim, William Russell Grace, as well as leading art dealerships such as M Knoedler & Co, and the design firm Tiffany Studios. In the 1920s, Vernay grew increasingly interested in game hunting and naturalist exploration, and after offering to underwrite a museum collecting expedition led by Colonel John Champion Faunthorpe intended to enhance the American Museum of Natural History's collection of Southeast Asian animals, Vernay joined Faunthorpe into India in 1923. Eventually this expedition would culminate in the American Museum of Natural History's Vernay-Faunthorpe Hall of South Asiatic Mammals, which opened in 1930 and held mounted elephants shot by the collectors in Mysore. His last expedition was to Africa in 1946. Vernay later moved to Nassau, Bahamas, where he cultivated an orchid greenhouse, participated in environmental conservation efforts, co-founding the Bahamas National Trust. In the Bahamas, Vernay lived with his wife at their home, Los Cayos, and was part of an expatriat social community that included the Duke of Windsor and Duchess of Windsor, the Swedish entrepreneur Axel Wenner-Gren, and hosted the English author Ian Fleming when he visited the Bahamas in 1956 before writing both Dr. No and Thunderball. The rodent genus Vernaya was named after him."

She rode BMW motorcycles and became a spokesperson for the marque before buying an MV Agusta. In 1958, she helped found the Women's International Motorcycle Association in Europe.

  "text" : "Alois Handl (22 July 1837, Feldkirch, Vorarlberg – 1915) was an Austrian physicist. In 1859 he obtained his doctorate in Vienna, later becoming a professor at the University of Lemberg. Afterwards he taught classes at the military academy in Wiener Neustadt. In 1876 he established the chair of experimental physics at the University of Czernowitz, a position he maintained until his retirement in 1906. Following his retirement, Handl was succeeded at Czernowitz by Josef Geitler von Armingen (1870-1923). As a physicist he conducted studies in the fields of crystallography, barometry, hydrodensitometry, and also did research involving light absorption, the specific resistance of liquids, and color vision in animals, to name a few. With chemist Richard Pribram (1847-1928), he conducted investigations on the viscosity of different organic compounds, with results of their work being published in the Sitzungsberichte of the Austrian Academy of Sciences and in Wilhelm Ostwald’s Zeitschrift für Physikalische Chemie. Handl's textbook of physics for middle-school students, \"Lehrbuch der Physik für die oberen Classen der Mittelschulen\", was published over several editions."

It is said while engraving works in the church of San Francesco, specifically the canvas by Pasinelli, where St Anthony of Padua liberates the soul of his father from Purgatory, Lorenzini was inspired to become a Franciscan. In 1709, he moved to Florence and took up again art, making engravings of works in the Medici gallery, working with Theodor Verkruys, Mogalli, and Picchianti. After about 30 years, he returned to Bologna, and joined the Accademia Clementina. Among his engravings are Martyrdom of St Ursula by Pasinelli, Annunciation by Veronese, Christ on the sea with St Peter Lodovico Caracci, Repose of Venus by Cignani, Jacob Sold to Slavery by Brothers by Andrea del Sarto, Saul and David with Head of Goliath by Guercino, Mary at Christ's Tomb by Pietro da Cortona, and Noah's Ark by Bassano."

She has been participating in gymnastics since she was five years old, and started cheerleading her sophomore year of high school. She picked up weight-lifting while a student at Hawaii Pacific University. Watson can squat 255 lbs, dead lift 230, curl 35 in each hand, and bench press 155 pounds. Watson gained notability when she was reportedly offered a $75,000 contract from Elite Model Management to serve as a fitness model, but declined because the agency would require her to take legal steroids to enhance her muscle size. She shared with Robin Roberts on Good Morning America and reporters from Inside Edition that taking steroids would go against her religious and personal beliefs, even though she was later accused by certain tabloids and talk show hosts of taking steroids to enhance her performance."

He studied mathematics, philosophy and natural sciences at the University of Prague, where he subsequently became an assistant to Ernst Mach (1838-1916). In 1871 he obtained his habilitation on electricity and magnetism from the University of Vienna. In 1876 became an associate professor at the recently established University of Czernowitz, where in 1882 he was appointed a full professor of theoretical physics. In 1890 he relocated to Innsbruck as a professor and director at the institute of mathematical physics. Here he served as dean to the faculty in 1891. From 1893 to 1914 he served as chair of theoretical physics at the University of Graz. Following retirement, his position at Graz was filled by Michael Radaković (1866-1934). Wassmuth is best known for his research involving thermoelasticity, electromagnetism and statistical mechanics. Among his principal written works are: Die Elektrizität und ihre Anwendungen (Electricity and its applications, 1885) and Grundlagen und Anwendungen der statistischen Mechanik (Fundamentals and applications of statistical mechanics, 1915). In 1885 he became a member of the \"Deutsche Akademie der Naturforscher Leopoldina\"."

In August 2010 Motasim was targeted by assassins and nearly died after advocating the Taliban should negotiate participation in Afghanistan's mainstream political process.“My idea was I wanted a broad-based government, all political parties together and maybe some hard-liners among the Taliban in Afghanistan and in Pakistan didn’t like to hear this and so they attacked me.\" In May 2012 Motasim told the Associated Press he regretted the assassination of Arsala Rahmani, a former Taliban Deputy Minister who served under Afghanistan's President Hamid Karzai. Motasim blamed the breakdown of recent negotiations with the Taliban on the USA's apparent unwillingness or inability to honor assurances that it would release Taliban captives. Motasim was followed by rumors of financial corruption, both as Finance Minister, while on the Quetta Shura—rumors that triggered his ouster in 2009."

Albert received the County of Hochberg and Christopher ruled Baden-Baden alone. However, Albert immedidately transferred Hochberg to his brother, in exchange for an annual pension, so that the margraviate remained de facto undivided. The division agreement was initially limited to a period of six years, which expired in 1482. In that year, the brothers decided to extend the agreement indefinitely. When Albert died childless in 1488, Hochberg fell back to Christopher."

As Raleigh's chief designer he designed the company's best selling Chopper bicycle. He drew the design for the Chopper on an envelope as he travelled home from the USA, in 1967, inspired to replicate the design of Peter Fonda's character's motorbike in the film Easy Rider. He came up with his drawing as he flew home from the trip, set up for him to \"get-to-grips\" with youth culture. In the 1980s, production of the Chopper ceased when the rival BMX hit the market, but, due to popular demand, a limited edition Chopper was released in 2004. Oakley married twice. His first marriage, in 1954, was to Brenda Wilson; the couple had a son and daughter. Oakley was married to Karen Francis from 1992 until his death. Oakley died from cancer, aged 85. He was survived by his son."

He was the son of Petrus Camper is known today primarily for his paleontological work in collaboration with his father, causing several fossil holotypes to be named after him, such as the Puppigerus P. Camperi. The engravings he commissioned on the basis of his father's work were published by Barthélemy Faujas de Saint-Fond. He himself wrote several books on paleontology, including a catalog of his collection of fossils and minerals. His daughter Frederica married one of his pupils in Franeker, the Dutch geologist J.G.S. van Breda (who later became curator of the Teylers Museum in Haarlem). Van Breda wrote a biography of father-in-law, in which he describes him as the home-schooled wunderkind who entered the University of Franeker at age 14 already learned in natural history and modern languages from his close association with his father. Three years later, in 1776, his mother died, and his father was so struck by the loss that he undertook a leave of absence from the university to travel to Paris and the young Adriaan went with him. There due to the fame of his father, they were received with open arms by the various learned societies such as the French Academy of Sciences and consorted with Louis, Antoine Portal, Jacques-René Tenon, Julien-David Le Roy, the Count Jean-Charles de Borda, the Marquis de Condorcet, and Benjamin Franklin (the American liberator). He became member of the Royal Institute of the Netherlands in 1808."

  "text" : "Aristide Auguste Stanislas Verneuil (29 September 1823, Paris – 11 January 1895) was a French physician and surgeon. He studied medicine in Paris, where his instructors were Jacques Lisfranc de St. Martin (1790–1847), Pierre-Antoine-Ernest Bazin (1807–1878), Charles-Pierre Denonvilliers (1808–1872) and Joseph-François Malgaigne (1806–1865). In 1843 he became interne des hôpitaux, obtaining his doctorate in 1852 with the thesis Recherches sur la locomotion du coeur. During the following year he received his aggregation, later being associated with the Hôpital Lourcine (1862), Hôpital du Midi (1865), Hôpital Lariboisière (1865), Hôpital de la Pitié (1872), and Hôtel-Dieu de Paris (1889). In 1868 he became a professor of external pathology, and from 1872 served as a professor of clinical surgery at the Pitié. In 1869 he became a member of the \"Académie de Médecine\" and president of the \"Société de chirurgie\". In 1887 he replaced Leon Athanese Gosselin (1815–1887) at the \"Académie des Sciences\". Verneuil was known for contributions made in the development of wound dressing, and is credited for introducing forcipressure in treatment of hemorrhage. His name is associated with \"Verneuil's disease\", a suppurative disease affecting the apocrine sweat glands that is generally known today as hidradenitis suppurativa. Also, \"plexiform neuroma\" (a neoplasm consisting of twisted bundles of nerves) is sometimes referred to as \"Verneuil's neuroma\"."

  "text" : "Anthony Raye Ketchum (born November 20, 1962) is an American former sprinter. He attended Needville High School in Texas and in 1981 set a state high school record for the 400-meter dash, with a time of 45.64 seconds. He was highly successful at school level, winning four straight titles in the 440-yard dash/400-meter dash from 1978 to 1981 at the UIL Texas State Track and Field Championships (the second man to do so after Kenneth Thomas of Wortham). He was the number one ranked high school athlete in the discipline in 1981 according to Track and Field News. Ketchum placed fifth nationally in the 400 m at the 1981 USA Outdoor Track and Field Championships and also fourth at the AAA Championships in the United Kingdom. His season's best of 45.69 seconds ranked him 26th globally. He was runner-up at the USA Junior Track and Field Championships in the 100-meter dash, taking second to Darren Walker. During this period he was coached by Jack Petty. He made his first appearances at international level in 1981. At the 1981 IAAF World Cup, his performance in the 4×100-meter relay alongside Mel Lattany, Stanley Floyd and Steve Williams brought the United States team the bronze medal. A gold medal in that event also came at that year's Universiade, as the American team of Lattany, Ketchum, Jason Grimes and Calvin Smith topped the podium. After graduating from high school, he began to attend the University of Houston and was coached by Tom Tellez as part of the institution's high calibre Houston Cougars track team (which had recently featured Carl Lewis). In his first year, he won the 440-yard dash title at the NCAA Men's Indoor Track and Field Championships, recording a time of 47.47 seconds to take his first collegiate title. Outdoors, he helped the team's 4 × 100 m relay quartet (including Carlton Young, Mark McNeil, and Stanley Floyd) to a world under-23 best time for the event in 38.53 seconds. Ketchum claimed the relay title with the Cougars at the 1982 NCAA Men's Outdoor Track and Field Championships in an American collegiate record of 39:12 seconds. His best individual run of 45.72 seconds that year ranked him in the top 40 globally. He only competed at the start of the 1983, his best of 45.77 seconds coming at the Mt. SAC Relays, where he was runner-up. At this point he started to focus on playing American football instead. Ketchum played for the Houston Cougars football team from 1983 to 1985 as a wide receiver and kickoff returner. He played three games professionally for the Hamilton Tiger-Cats, briefly staying at the Canadian football team in the 1987 season. Towards the end of his career, he was part of the Detroit Lions team in the late 1980s, but was released in 1989."

At Trinity in the 1840s and 1850s he was Professor of Moral and Intellectual Philosophy. Whilst president of Hobart he was responsible for changing the name from Hobart Free College to honor its original founder, Bishop John Henry Hobart, and was responsible for much fundraising. In 1863, he raised the funds to build the St. John’s Chapel. In 1872, Jackson visited Britain, seeking models and an architect, for a planned new campus for the Trinity College. William Burges was chosen and he drew up a four-quadrangled masterplan, in his Early French style. Jackson was also on the Standing Committee of the Diocese of Connecticut.

  "text" : "Adolph Borsdorf (born Dittmansdorf, Saxony, 25 December 1854; died London, 15 April 1923), was a German player of the French horn. Borsdorf was born in Saxony in 1854. He studied the French horn at the Conservatoire in Dresden and played in a military band. In 1879 he moved to England where he stayed for the rest of his life, becoming the most important horn player in England. The conductor Hans Richter offered him at job in the orchestra at Covent Garden. In 1904 he joined the newly formed London Symphony Orchestra. The four horn players in that orchestra were excellent players and were often called “God’s Own Quartet”. Borsdorf and his colleague Franz Paersch had learned to play on horns that were made in Germany. These had a wide bore (the hole through the tube). However, both players changed to playing instruments made in France by a horn-maker called Raoux. These instruments had a narrower bore. They were not quite as powerful but gave a particularly clear sound. Borsdorf became professor at the Royal College of Music when it was founded in 1882. He also taught at the Royal Academy of Music. He soon became the best horn player in London. He was playing principal horn in the orchestra which Henry Wood conducted at the very first Promenade Concert in the Queen’s Hall in 1895 (the fourth horn was A.E.Brain, grandfather of Dennis Brain). He was also in the orchestra when Richard Strauss’s Till Eulenspiegel was given its first performance in England in 1896 with the composer conducting. In 1913 he became ill and had to have teeth removed. There was also another problem for him: World War I broke out in 1914 and there was a lot of anti-German feeling in England. After the war he rarely played in public. Borsdorf died in 1923. He had done more than anyone else to improve the standard of horn playing in England. He taught many talented pupils, including A.E.Brain Jr., Aubrey Brain, Frank Probyn and his own three sons: Oskar, Francis and Emil who all became professional horn players."

He passed the Civil Service entrance exam in 1869. He took a post with the Bengal Civil Service in 1871, and was appointed to the position of postmaster for Bombay in 1882. After a stint serving in the Finance and Commerce Department, in 1889 he became the Governor of the Indian Post Office, a position he held until 1906. In 1893, Queen Victoria announced the creation of a Royal Commission on Opium to regulate the British opium trade in the Far East. Fanshawe, a supporter of the opium trade, was nominated to the Commission by the Indian Government. The Commission's report found that opium use in Asia was not a major problem in Asia and its conclusions effectively removed the opium question from the British public agenda for another 15 years."

After his release in 2001, he supported government reform plans. In 2001, Hussain chaired the committee which founded Al Wefaq, Bahrain's main opposition party. He urged opposition leaders to boycott 2002 parliamentary election after the king issued Constitution of 2002, which he found going back on reform plans. In 2003, Hussain announced he would leave politics and stop issuing public statements and in 2005 he resigned from Al Wefaq. In 2009 He returned to politics becoming the co-founder and official spokesman of Al Wafa' Islamic Movement. During the Bahraini uprising (2011–present), Hussain played an important role, leading protests, calling for the downfall of regime and establishment of a democratic republic. One month after the beginning of protests, he was arrested, allegedly tortured and sentenced by a special military court to life imprisonment. Later, sentence was overturned, and it was announced that he would be retried by a civilian court. The retrial began on 22 May 2012, but was postponed until May 29."

She finished her PhD in 1980 with a thesis entitled  (The Painter at the Paris Salon: 1791-1880), published at Campus, Frankfurt 1985. The book is a computer based social history of the 19th century French art scene. In 1985 she opened her first gallery in the north of Germany (Kiel), where she lived with her husband, a journalist, and her daughter. In 1998 she moved the gallery to Hamburg, where the German branch of Sfeir-Semler is still based. Beirut gallery: \"After 20 years running a top-notch blue-chip contemporary gallery for minimal and conceptual art in Hamburg, owner Andree Sfeir-Semler decided she wanted to expand her business and return to the city she left behind in 1975.\" In April 2005, on the 20th anniversary of the opening of her German gallery, she made her Beirut exhibition début with “Flight 405”, a group show of work by The Atlas Group/Walid Raad, Elger Esser, Alfredo Jaar, Emily Jacir, Amal al Kenawy, Till Krause, Hiroyuki Masuyama, Michelangelo Pistoletto, and Akram Zaatari. Since then she has mounted numerous exhibitions including the first one-person-shows in the Middle East by Walid Raad (2008), Akram Zaatari (2009), Wael Shawky (2011), MARWAN (2009), Yto Barrada (2010), Etel Adnan (2010), Mounira al Solh (2011), Hassan Sharif (2012), and Gabriel Kuri (2012). Her Beirut gallery hosts diverse curatorial projects including a group show of young Egyptian artists “Out of Place”(2006) curated by William Wells of the Cairo Townhouse Gallery, Catherine David’s “In the Middle of the Middle” (2008), Bidoun Magazine’s show “NOISE” (2009) by Negar Azimi and Babak Radboy, “Au Delà des Images (Beyond Images)” (2006) with works of the Fond National d'Art Contemporain, France, curated by Jean Marc Prévost & Akram Zaatari, and “HomeWorks” (2008), a recurring forum on Contemporary Art based in Beirut organized by Christine Tohmé, director of Ashkal Alwan. Sfeir-Semler also represents established European and American artists (Robert Barry, Elger Esser, Ian Hamilton Finlay, Hans Haacke, Günter Haese, Sol LeWitt, Timo Nasseri, Michelangelo Pistoletto, Ulrich Rückriem, Christine Streuli), therefore nurturing a cross-cultural link between Western and Middle Eastern contemporary art practices. For example, she has held two solo shows of the German photographer Elger Esser in her Beirut gallery, showing works produced during trips to Lebanon and Egypt."

He is the brother-in-law of Hafiz Muhammad Saeed. The United States Department of the Treasury, at the behest of India, has designated Makki as a Specially Designated National. It has announced a reward of $2 million through its Rewards for Justice Program for information leading to the location of Makki. Makki is alleged to be in proximity to Taliban's supreme commander Mullah Omar and Al-Qaeda's Ayman al-Zawahiri. Makki is popular in Pakistan for his anti-India speeches. One, that he gave in 2010, is counted among the most disturbing. Eight days before the German Bakery blast in Pune, he delivered a speech at Muzaffarabad where he had said that three Indian cities, including Pune, were likely to be targeted. Abdul Rehman Makki, alongside Hafiz Saeed, is currently working for Difa-e-Pakistan Council (DPC) which is designated to defend the interests of Pakistan and to agitate against the drone attacks in Waziristan, Pakistan. DPC, in its own words, is against the war in Afghanistan. It has also protested against the NATO supplies going through Pakistan. Abdul Rehman Makki, in many of his public speeches and sermons, has stated that the war on terror started by America has caused the death of thousands of innocents in Afghanistan, Iraq and Pakistan. JuD's leaders deny all allegations on them regarding terrorism. Hafiz Saeed, via media, has challenged India to prove him guilty in any international court after the supreme court of Pakistan has cleared him and his Jama't of all allegations. Pakistan's foreign minister, Hina Rabbani Khar has said that they would need hard evidence to prosecute Hafiz Saeed and his allies such as Abdul Rehman Makki."

He has won three Esso Journalism Awards and four Vladimir Herzog Awards. Today, he is part of the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) and executive producer of journalism at TV Record. In 2007, when working at Correio Braziliense, he was investigating homicides linked to the drug trafficking around Brasília, and was shot at an attempted murder. The suspected shooter was the nephew of Brasília mayor Sonia Melo (PSDB) and Amaury had to stay under police care until he was transferred to the newspaper Estado de Minas, owned by the same group of Correio. He then focused on political subjects, specializing in money laundering. He gained notoriety on 2011 after publishing the book A Privataria Tucana, in which he reveals documents about supposed irregularities in privatizations that allegedly occurred during the administration of the PSDB, the former president Fernando Henrique Cardoso and that friends and relatives of the PSDB's ex-presidential candidate José Serra, would have held companies in tax shelters and moved millions of dollars between 1993 and 2003."

  "text" : "Al Palzer (1 January 1890 - 26 July 1917) was a boxer who fought from 1911 to 1915, one of the \"White Hopes\" during the reign of world heavyweight champion Jack Johnson, an African American. The 6'3\" Palzer, who was German-American, fought in the heavyweight division at a weight of 218 to 228 lbs. Palzer was one of the first boxers to fight for the World White Heavyweight Championship title. On 9 March 1911, he lost a newspaper decision to Frank Moran in a 10-round bout held in Brooklyn, New York. Moran had fought Johnson in a four-round exhibition in April 1909 in Pittsburgh and later lost a title match with Johnson in Paris on 27 Jun 1914. Palzer participated in a \"White Hope\" tournament organized by promoter Tom O'Rourke at New York City's National Sporting Club that was held in May 1911. Ironically, O’Rourke has managed the legendary African American boxers Joe Walcott and George Dixon. He also had signed Palzer to a contract before the tournament, and likely manipulated it so that Palzer could win. Other White Hope tournaments were created in response to O'Rouke's contest. On 19 December 1911, Palzer fought Al Kaufman in Brooklyn and scored a K.O. in the fifth round of their 10-round bout. Kaufman had fought Jack Johnson for the world heavyweight title in San Francisco on 9 September 1909. The 10-rounder ended in a no-decision, and the two fighters met in Reno, Nevada to box an exhibition in July 1910. On New Year's Day 1913, Palzer met Luther McCarty in Vernon, California to determine the \"White Heavyweight Championship\" of the world. McCarty won the title by way of a T.K.O. in the 18th round. It would be a title he would hold for the rest of his life which would only be a short five months. Palzer retired in 1915 after having racked up a record of nine wins (six by K.O.) against four losses. He also lost four newspaper decisions. He died on 26 July 1917, when he was shot to death by his father."

  "text" : "Boskovich was born in Kolozsvár, Transylvania, Austria-Hungary (now Cluj-Napoca, Romania). The origin of his family and of his name was the town Boskovich in Moravia. In Cluj, Boskovich studied in a Jewish high school called \"Culture\" which accommodated both Neolog and Orthodox Jews. In 1920, Alexander joined the local Jewish organization \"Hashomer\" in which he was active for four years. In 1937, Boskovich sent a piano version of his work \"The Golden Chain\" to the conductor Issay Dobrowen. This work, based on Jewish songs from the Carpathian Mountains, was originally written for piano and later on, in 1936, transcribed for orchestra. In 1938, Dobrowen suggested to the \"Palestinian Orchestra\" to embed this work in a concert under his baton. Boskovich was invited (from abroad) to the premiere of his composition \"Jewish Folk Songs\" which was performed by the newly founded Palestinian (Jewish) Orchestra. (Later on, that orchestra evolved into the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra.) One consequence of that event was that Boskovich decided to stay in the country and settle in Tel Aviv. In the coming years, Boskovich often said that Dobrowen, \"The Golden Chain\", and the orchestra's invitation saved his life. One of the cornerstones in the development of the art of music in Israel during the Yishuv period was the performance of Boskovich's Semitic Suite by the Histadrut Orchestra under the baton of Frank Pelleg. Immediately after his arrival in Israel, Boskovich changed his writing style as is well manifested by his Semitic Suite---from the tonality of Europe into textures that imitated the Oud or the Arab Kanun. Writing in the Land of Israel had a profound effect on Boskovich; effect of the varied country's landscapes, the colors of sand and sea, and the sounds of the local music that originated from the various Jewish ethnic groups, as well as from the non-Jewish ones. All of these influences inspired him to develop a personal style peculiar only to himself. Penetrating deep into the Hebrew language served him as one of the most inspiring sources. Unlike others, he did not use songs or dances of the various Jewish ethnicities for a direct source, but rather formed his new ideas based on them. That approach prompted him to compose his violin Concerto---his first major work since 1942 which won the Bronisław Huberman's first prize. Later on in 1944, it was performed by The violinist Lorand Ervin Fenyves, George Singer conducting. Despite its success, Boskovich lost interest in this Concerto and, in 1957, he re- wrote its middle section as a separate piece for violin and piano. During the same period (1943), he also wrote his Concerto for oboe and Orchestra which also shows a strong oriental influence. In the 1940s and the early 1950s, Boskovich formulated and advocated the concept of Mediterranean Music. The Mediterranean Sea in his opinion represented a new authentic cradle that merged Zionism with the landscape and climate of the East. Boskovich loved the Opera, he loved everything French, such as Ravel's music and French art, while he equally loved the Jewish melodies of Eastern Europe. But in Israel---he felt and preached---everything must start afresh---perhaps requiring the abandonment of all the old loves and passions."

Born in Beechville, PA in 1916, Lewis spent most of his childhood in North Carolina. Lewis graduated from Haverford College in 1940, where he played football and baseball. After college, Lewis joined the United States Army Air Forces (later, the US Air Force), and by the end of World War II, Lewis attained the rank of Captain. Lewis joined the Inquirer in 1946 and wrote almost exclusively about the Philadelphia Phillies until 1972. Lewis officially retired from the Inquirer in 1979. In 1981 he was inducted into the writer's wing of the Baseball Hall of Fame, where he received the J. G. Taylor Spink Award, the highest honor awarded by the Baseball Writers Association of America. He served on the Veterans Committee of the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum from 1979 to 2000. In that capacity, Lewis joined a group of Hall-of-Famers who were charged with nominating and voting in new Hall of Fame inductees. He also was the Chairman of Major League Baseball's Scoring Committee from 1960 to 1974. He was cited as \"the foremost authority on baseball rules,\" and was respected as a baseball historian who covered 24 World Series and witnessed 10 no-hitters. Former Phillies' owner, Ruly Carpenter, praised Lewis as probably having as good a knowledge of baseball and how it was meant to be played as some field managers. After retiring to Clearwater, Florida in the early 1980s, Lewis continued to follow the Phillies at their spring training camp in Clearwater, and was the first official scorer in 1998 for the Tampa Bay Devil Rays, until his final retirement in 2002. During his time in Clearwater, Lewis joined with Dunedin Mayor Cecil Englebert, as they served on the Pinellas County Sports Authority. According to Englebert, \"Lewis was very involved in the work we did in the (sports authority) to get the Dome (now Tropicana Field) built, and we traveled together to a lot of baseball meetings throughout the country. He introduced me to many baseball greats that I would never have had the opportunity to meet.\" In addition to writing for the Inquirer, Lewis also published four books on the Phillies and baseball history: \n*  No-Hitters: The 225 Games, 1893-1999 (2000) \n*  This Date in Philadelphia Phillies History (1992 - updated and republished in 2013) \n*  Baseballs Greatest Streaks: The highs and lows of teams, pitchers, and hitters in the modern major leagues (1992) \n*  The Philadelphia Phillies: A pictorial history (1981)"

  "text" : "Albie Thoms (July 28, 1941 – November 28, 2012) was an Australian film director, writer, and producer. He was born in Sydney, Australia. He was nominated for at the 1979 AFI Awards for Best Original Screenplay for Palm Beach. He is best known for his work with Ubu Films, the Sydney Filmmakers’ Co-operative, and the Yellow House. He died on November 28, 2012. Theatre Productions: Thoms’ first production for SUDS was Alfred Jarry’s Ubu Roi (1962), followed by Harold Pinter’s [[The Dumb Waiter]] (1962). He then staged a production of his own devising, A Revue of the Absurd (1963), consisting of playlets, poems and performance pieces by such authors as Alfred Jarry, Samuel Beckett, Eugene Ionesco, Jacques Prevert, N.F. Simpson, Edward Albee and Kenneth Koch. One of its items, Alfred Jarry’s The Song of the Disembraining was thought by the police to be obscene, but Thoms refused to remove it from the show and was summonsed to court, where he was successful in refuting the charge. A Revue of the Absurd was also staged in Melbourne as part of the Marlowe Society’s Theatre of the Absurd season, organised by Bill Wakler. Thoms’ next productions were Arrabal’s Fando and Lis and the Two Executioners (1963) for SUDS, after which he formed the Contemporary Theatre Company (CTC) with Arthur Hynes, and staged Samuel Beckett’s Waiting for Godot (1963). Under the CTC banner, he also directed A Tribute to Jean Cocteau, and produced a Lunchtime Revue (directed by Hynes). Thoms then became manager of the Australian Elizabethan Theatre Trust’s Lunchtime Theatre, which played in suburban shopping Malls, with productions of N.F. Simpson’s A Resounding Tinkle, G.B. Shaw’s Overruled, and Edward Albee’s The Zoo Story (all 1964). For SUDS 75th Anniversary celebrations, he directed Samuel Beckett’s Embers (1964), before embarking on a massive production of Theatre Of Cruelty (1965), which was developed and rehearsed over a six-month period. It involved applying the theories of Antonin Artaud, as expressed in his The Theatre and Its Double, to short plays, poems and performance pieces by such authors as Alfred Jarry, Oskar Kochoschka, Wassily Kandinski, F.T. Marinetti, Gertrude Stein, Kurt Schwitters, Tristan Tzara, Salvador Dali, And Jean Tardieu. It also included Happenings by Martin Sharp, and work from the La Monte Young and the New York Fluxus group, as well as work from Peter Brook and Charles Marowitz, who had been running Artaud workshops in London. It also included Australia first dramatic piece generated by an IBM1440 computer. Theatre of Cruelty represented Sydney at the 1965 Australian Universities Drama festival in Newcastle, where it underwent considerable modification and refinement. First Films: For his production of A Revue of the Absurd, Thoms obtained the assistance of Bruce Beresford to make a film of Jacques Prevert’s ..it droppeth as the gentle rain (1963). This satire on complacency in the face of nuclear fallout was adapted to a Sydney setting, but was banned by the Chief Secretary of New South Wales, who was responsible for theatre licensing, as well as the Commonwealth Film Censors, who controlled film screenings in Victoria. Another attempt at having it screened as part of SUDS’ 75th Anniversary celebrations was also stopped by the Chief Secretary. Thoms then made two films in conjunction with David Perry for inclusion in the Theatre of Cruelty season. These were The Spurt of Blood (1965), based on a scenario by Antonin Artaud, and Poem 25, in which Perry scratched onto celluloid the numbers of a poem by Kurt Schwitters, which were projected beside the actor reciting it. Theatre of Cruelty also included another early example of Expanded Cinema, when Bruce Conner’ film, Cosmic Ray, was projected over the actors performing in a happening by Emmet Williams, while another consisted of an illegal screening of ..it droppeth as the gentle rain, in which wet paper ‘turds’ were dropped from the ceiling. At the conclusion of the program, four members of the production team, David Perry, Aggy Read, John Clark and Albie Thoms decided to form Ubu Films to continue such film activity. Television: While working on Theatre of Cruelty, Thoms was offered a position as Specialist Trainee Production with the Australian Broadcasting Commission, and began learning the craft of television in conjunction with seven others, including Bob Ellis and Richard Brennan. A year later, he was assigned to drama producer, Eric Tayler, as his assistant producer, and worked with him on the first series of Australian Playhouse, and then on the comedy series, Nice’n’Juicy, of which Thoms directed the last three episodes. He then directed an episode of the second series of Australian Playhouse, before joining the production team of Contrabandits, a large-budget series on the activities of the Australia Customs and Excise Department. Thoms directed four episodes of this series, writing and directing one of them, and writing another. He then left to freelance, with his first job producing Chris McCullough’s surreal drama, Vision for a New World, for Karvan International. He then ventured into Children’s Television, writing and directing episodes of Skippy the Bush Kangaroo. He then stopped television work to complete his experimental feature film, Marinetti for Ubu Films. Ubu Films: Established by Albie Thoms, David Perry, Aggy Read and John Clark in 1965 with the aim of making Experimental Films, Ubu became a distribution centre for Australian and foreign independent films, organising exhibitions of them in Australian capital cities, producing expanded cinema in the form of lighshows with rock bands and slide and film projections, and publishing the Underground newspaper, Ubunews. Ubu’s first production was the spy-spoof, Blunderball (1966), a burlesque of all the James Bond films to date, written and directed by Thoms, and intended to raise money for experimental films. It was screened as part of the program Blunderball and Other Recent Australian Films, including works by Bruce Beresford, Richard Brennan and Garry Shead, who became one of the mainstays of the group. The program attracted turn-away crowds, with the profits split among the contributing filmmakers. Ubu used the funds to make Man and His World (1966), written and directed by Thoms for a competition for 50-second film on the title theme, using an ultra high speed camera and split-screen optical printing. The competition was held in conjunction with Expo 67 in Montreal, where it was selected for the finals and screened at the Montreal Film Festival. Thoms then made Rita & Dundi for Ubu, This experimental documentary about two young Paddington dress-makers was banned for nudity, but was screened widely in Australia without complaint. This was followed by an improvised Happening orchestrated by Garry Shead, with the Ubu filmmakers, along with Michael Pearce, David Stiven and Roger Whitaker. It was included in Ubu’s second exhibition program, Underground and Experimental Films, which included previous work and news films, including Thoms handmade film, Bluto, made by scraping emulsion from black leader and hand-colouring the results. It led to Thoms’ penning a Handmade Film Manifesto that was published in Sydney and San Francisco, and led to a Sydney School of Handmade Films, many of which were used in Ubu’s lightshows. Thoms next film for Ubu, Bolero (1967) came about as a result of an invitation from the Royal Belgian Film Archive to submit an idea for a film for the 4th International Experimental Film Festival in Knokke-Le Zoute. Thoms’ idea involved a camera tracking down a street into the eye of a girl, done to the music of Maurice Ravel. It was awarded an Agfa-Gaevert Prize and was exhibited in the final of the competition. Thoms next made David Perry (1968), consisting of scraps found in David Perry’s editing bin, which were scratched on, coloured, and synchronised to the soundtrack of David Perry talking about his films. It was selected for screening at the 2nd Directors’ Fortnight at the 1970 Cannes Film Festival. After that Thoms commenced work on his experimental feature Marinetti. Marinetti: Marinetti was made as a homage to the Futurist poet, F.T. Marinetti, whose theory of art Thoms thought had been neglected. Using a stream-of-consciousness technique in which the camera seemed to be looking inside the authors’ head, it expresses the state-of-mind of a man at a party at which his wife and previous wife are present. A feature-length montage with an overlapping soundtrack, it caused a scandal at its World Premiere in Sydney, but subsequently fared better in other capitals and in North America, and particularly in Europe, where it was invited to be screened in England, France, the Netherlands, Denmark, Germany, Austria and Italy, while Henri Langlois selected it for screening in a program of New Cinema at the Metropolitan Museum in New York. Travels in Europe: Thoms travelled in Europe for six months screening Marinetti, before returning to London, where he worked for Oz magazine and on Freek Press at the Isle of Wight Festival. He then worked on the organising committee for the 1st International Underground Film Festival the National Film Theatre, and the Wet Dream Film Festival in Amsterdam, where he was employed as a consultant to the Nederlandse Film Ko-op. The Yellow House: On his return to Sydney, Thoms joined with Martin Sharp in establishing the Yellow House, a ‘community of artists in the South, in the sun’, inspired by Vincent van Gogh’s Yellow House in Arles. Thoms became principal of the Ginger Meggs Memorial School of Arts in the Yellow House, arranging classes in Modernism, film poetry, plays and performance in preparation for the Spring Exhibition(1971), in which two city townhouses were decorated from floor to ceiling with artworks inspired by van Gogh, Hokusai, Magritte, and Walt Disney. Working with such artists as Martin Sharp, Brett Whiteley, Peter Wright, Dicky Weight, David Litvinoff, Nic Lyon, John Lewis, Ellis D Fogg and Bruce Goold, Thoms contributed the ‘Whaaam Wall’, inspired by Roy Lichtenstein, the ‘Fur Tunnel’ inspired by Meret Oppenheim, and the ‘Caterpillar Corner’ inspired by Lewis Carroll. Morning of the Earth: Thoms had become the regular record-reviewer for the surfing magazine Tracks, edited by David Elfick, and when he left the Yellow House after the Spring Show, he was engaged to edit their surfmovie, Morning of the Earth,(1972), which became Australia’s most-successful surfing film. A Sunshine City: Thoms had received a grant from the Experimental Film & Television Fund to make Sunshine City (1973), a record of the artists’ return to Sydney, Using a flicking light pattern to modify the imagery, Thoms inserted conversations with Sydney associates amid scenes of Sydney life, and featured, among others, Germaine Greer, Brett Whiteley, Jim Anderson, David Elfick, David Litvinoff, and Aggy Read. GTK: After travelling in Europe and North America, studying avant-garde film on a grant from the Australian Film Radio and Television School, Thoms took up a position in 1974 making a film a week for the ABC-TV youth program GTK (Get to Know). He soon was made co-producer of the program, producing more than 200 episodes of the nightly series, and directing more than 50 short films for it. Cite International des Arts: After GTK, Thoms was awarded an artist-in-residency in the Power Studio of the Cite International des Arts in Paris (1976), but was unable to complete much work there due to a lack of funds. Instead he furthered his education by attending the museums and cinema. Australian Film Commission: On his return to Australia, Thoms was appointed manager of the Experimental Film and Television Fund for the Australian Film Commission (1977–78), where he as able to bring about significant reforms to the fund, which remained the Creative Development Fund, and not only encouraged production, but distribution and exhibition, with many films made during his tenure winning prizes and were selected for screening at international film festivals. Polemics for a New Cinema: On completion of his contract with the Australian Film Commission, Thoms was commissioned by the publishers, Wild and Woolley, to collect his writing on film into a book, Polemics for a New Cinema (1978), which brought together essays and articles Thoms had begun writing a decade earlier. Palm Beach: After five years seeking funds for another experimental feature, Thoms received a loan from the Creative Development Fund to make a tripartite narrative Palm Beach (1979), concerning an out-of-work surfer, a drug dealer, and a runaway teenage girl. Shot with a single take for each scene, it had a complex sound montage, in which sounds and dialogue overlapped from scene-to-scene, and were united by talk radio, which gave cohesion to the differing suburbs of Sydney’s Northern Beaches, where the characters lived. It shared first prize for Best Australian Film at the Adelaide Film Festival, was nominated for Best Screenplay in the Australian Film Awards, was sold to German Television, and was released on video in the US. Documentaries: Thoms first documentary was Petfoods is a Serious Business (1969), made for Uncle Bens, with the next being one about the artist Martin Sharp, Something Old, Something New, Something Borrowed, Something Blue (1976), made for ABC-TV. After that he was commissioned by Saarlander Rundfunk in West Germany to make New Australian Film (1977) and by ZDF, West Germany, to make Surfmovies (1981), about the Australian surfing film phenomena. Then it was The Bradman Era (1982), for ABC-TV, about Australia’s legendary cricketer. This was followed by JOK-the Wild One (1983), about Australia’s first rock star, Johnny O’Keefe, and From Neck-to-Knee to Nude (1985) covering the history of Australia’s beach bathing customs, both made for ATN-7. Two scripts for the NFSA followed, with Hot From the Spot to the Screen (1986) dealing with newsreels, and It’s On Record (1986) dealing with the music recording industry. Getting Straight (1989) was a drug recognition film made for NSW prisons, while Aluminium Dampcourse Production and Lead Dampcourse Production (1992-3) were training films made for the family company. Australia is as Good as Its Words (1994) was a promotion for the Literature Board of the Australian Council, while Bohemians in the Bush (1995) dealt with the camps of the Australian Impressionists in Mosman at the end of the Nineteenth Century, as was subject of an exhibition at the Art Gallery of NSW (AGNSW), and was screened on ABC-TV. Another for an exhibition was State of the Waratah (2000), made with Rosie Nice for screening in the Botanical Gardens, while The King of Belle-Ile (2001), about the Australian painter, John Russell, who lived in France and worked with Rodin, Monet, van Gogh and Matisse, was made for an exhibition at the AGNSW, and was screened on SBS. Videos: While earning his living making documentaries, Thoms continued to experiment, making Hollywood Expanded (1976) a nine-screen film for Ellis D Fogg, that was screened at the opening of the Hoyts Entertainment Centre. Polygenesis (1990), was made by transferring fictional film to video and mixing six layers to create an abstraction, while Akai Ghost Poems (1995), edited 40 hours of experimental videotape shot in the Yellow House, and Gulag (1999) used the dripping style of Jackson Pollock to make a hand-made film that was then transferred to video and its speeds altered in a video mixer. Books: As well as Polemics for a New Cinema (1978), Thoms wrote Surfmovies, (2000) a history of the Australian surfing film, published by Shore Thing, Noosa. His memoir ‘My Generation’ (2012) was published shortly after his death by Media21 publishing. He has also contributed to The Documentary Film in Australia publication as well as providing catalogue essays for Bohemians in the Bush (1991) and Belle-Ile: Monet, Russell and Matisse in Brittany (2001), both for AGNSW, and Then and Now and Everything in Between (2010), Mosman Art Gallery, Exhibitions: Thoms was curator of all the film exhibitions staged by Ubu Films. He also assisted with the exhibitions, The Yellow House (AGNSW, 1991), Bohemians in the Bush (AGNSW, 1992), and curated the David Perry retrospective, Then and Now and Everything in Between (2010) for the Mosman Art Gallery. Heritage: Thoms is descended from Cornish tin miners, one of whom, Thomas Thoms (1820-1862) migrated to Australia on an assisted package in 1849. He was sent to work in a copper mine in Bathurst, but it proved unsuccessful, and he was working as a well-sinker, when gold was discovered the Bathurst region. As a result, Thomas was able to build his own home in Bathurst and pay for apprenticeships for his five sons living sons. One of these, Thomas (1857-1928), became a tinsmith, but soon left for Sydney, where he became a plumber at Summer Hill. He was able to expand his business, established in the backyard of his family home, adding the manufacture of galvanised iron water tanks and lead piping, using a machine of his own design. On his death, the business, now named Thomas Thoms Pty Ltd, was operated by his five sons, one of whom was Albie’s father, Ronald (1915-1990). Schooling: After attending Yeo Park Infants School and Canterbury Boys Primary School, Albie attended Trinity Grammar School, where he was a member of the 1st XV, 2nd X1, Athletics Team, and Drama Club. In his final year he won the School Art Prize and a Commonwealth Scholarship to attend Sydney University. University: Thoms studied Arts at Sydney University, majoring in English and Anthropology, and passed an M.A. qualifying exam, which enabled him to work on a thesis on The Stagecraft of the Theatre of the Absurd, which was never completed. A member of the Film Group (SUFG) and the Dramatic Society (SUDS), he was also involved with the university Libertarians, who were part of the Sydney Push. As a writer he contributed to the student newspaper, Honi Soit, and the university magazines, Hermes and Arna, and wrote for the annual university revue, with the first of his scripts produced by Clive James, and the second performed by Germaine Greer. Thoms was elected president of SUDS and the university Theatre Council, and helped organise the 1963 Australian Universities Drama Festival, which had as its guest-of-honour, the expatriate Spanish playwright, Arrabal."

  "text" : "Aurelio Valenzuela Tolentino (October 13, 1867 – July 5, 1915) was a Filipino playwright and dramatist whose works at the turn of the 20th century depict his desire to see Philippine independence from its colonizers. Born in Santo Cristo, Guagua, Pampanga, he was the third and youngest child of Leonardo Tolentino and Patrona Valenzuela. He received his Bachelor of Arts degree from Colegio de San Juan de Letran, and read law at the University of Santo Tomas. Later in his life, Aurelio moved to Tondo, Manila where he became a court desk official. In Tondo he met Andres Bonifacio, one of the founders of Katipunan and eventual leader of the Philippine revolution against Spain, which he would eventually become an early member of. He, together with Andres Bonifacio and Macario Sakay founded the Teatro Porvenir, a theater company where they themselves are actors, where they show their nationalistic and patriotic sentiments. He accompanied Bonifacio in their search for a secret headquarters in the mountains of Morong province (now Rizal) in preparation for the start of the Philippine Revolution. He was arrested shortly after the start of the war and was detained for nine months. He continued to support the cause for Philippine sovereignty after his release and even became one of the signatories of the Declaration of Independence in 1898. When Spain ceded the Philippines to the United States, Tolentino formed Junta de Amigos, a secret organization composed of former Katipuneros to fight for independence from the Americans. Later, he attempted to re-organize the Revolutionary Army, but was unsuccessful in part due to the surrender of Emilio Aguinaldo. This led Tolentino to shift his focus from warfare to propaganda. He edited several anti-US newspapers in Tagalog and Kapampangan, some of which were closed down by the American authorities. On May 14, 1903 his now famous verse drama, Kahapon, Ngayon at Bukas, premiered at Manila's Teatro Libertad. The script called for tearing of the American flag, which was seen by some Americans in the audience. After the show, he was promptly arrested for sedition and rebellion. He was pardoned in 1912 by Governor General W. Cameron Forbes partly due to pressure from Washington. After his release, he continued to write for theater; among his later works included \"Ang Bagong Cristo\", a proletariat interpretation of the story of Christ. He also founded the first worker's cooperative in the Philippines, Samahang Hanapbuhay ng Mahihirap, as well as El Parnaso Filipino, a school for the promotion of Tagalog literature. He died on July 5, 1915 in Manila. He was buried in the city's North Cemetery. His remains were transferred to his hometown in Guagua in 1921, where it is interred under a commemorative monument. The Little Theater of the Cultural Center of the Philippines was named after him."

  "text" : "St.  Anthony of Rome or Anthony the Roman (Russian: Антоний Римлянин) was the founder of the Antoniev Monastery in Novgorod. The hagiographic account on the life of Saint Anthony of Rome is only known since the second half of the 16th century. It claims that Anthony was born in Rome. and became an Orthodox monk there. After persecution of Eastern Orthodox believers started, he left the city and made a home at the seashore. Once, when he was standing on a stone and praying, a storm started, lifted the stone and in two days moved it along the sea to the city of Novgorod. Anthony, who did not speak Russian, was informed by a Greek merchant that he was in Novgorod, met with Saint Nikita, the bishop of Novgorod, and obtained a permission to found the monastery at the site his stone arrived to the shore. It has been reported that the monastery church was consecrated by Anthony not in 1119, but that he was made hegumen only in 1131/32, immediately after Niphont was installed as the Bishop of Novgorod. This long delay is unclear; presumably it was related to some frictions between Novgorod church hierarchs. Anthony died in 1147 and was buried in the monastery. Since 1597, Anthony is venerated as a saint by the Russian Orthodox Church. The feast days are January 17 and August 3."

She replaced Gregory Jaczko who was forced to step down before the end of his term by his fellow commissioners. Macfarlane was reconfirmed for a full five-year term by the United States Senate on July 1, 2013. Prior to taking the top position at the NRC, Dr. Macfarlane was an associate professor of environmental science and policy at George Mason University. As Chairman of the NRC, Dr. Macfarlane prioritized the geological and operational lessons learned from the North Anna and Fukushima, as well as improving the NRC's communication with public stakeholders and paying more attention to the back end of the fuel cycle in an era where more U.S. nuclear power plants were being decommissioned than built. She also pushed to make the NRC a more family-friendly workplace. Given that she had raised questions a decade earlier about the suitability of the Yucca Mountain site for long-term geologic disposal of high-level nuclear waste, supporters of Yucca Mountain expected her to stall NRC licensing of Yucca Mountain, but she complied with a court order that ruled her predecessor's actions illegal and directed the NRC to continue its licensing review until it had spent down the funds made available for this purpose by Congress."

  "text" : "Alirio Ugarte Pelayo (Parroquia Anzoátegui, 21 January 1923 - 19 May 1966), was a Venezuelan politician, journalist, diplomat and lawyer. He was appointed Governor of Monagas state (1949-1951) under the military junta set up after the 1948 Venezuelan coup d'état. After the restoration of democracy in 1958, he joined the Democratic Republican Union (URD). He was Ambassador to Mexico (1959-1962), and was elected to the Venezuelan Chamber of Deputies in the 1963 elections, becoming President of the Chamber. He was a member of the Supreme Electoral Council from 1959 to 1964. Ugarte Pelayo became Secretary General of the URD in 1965, and appeared likely to gain the URD presidential nomination for the 1968 election. In response URD leader Jóvito Villalba, who wanted to be re-nominated, had Ugarte Pelayo suspended from the URD in April 1966. The vote of the URD National Directorate fell 16 to 12, and \"it soon became evident that if Ugarte left the party over his suspension, he would take with him the twelve members of the National Directorate who had backed him against Villalba, eight congressmen, and at least ten state organizations.\" Ugarte Pelayo announced the creation of a new party, Movimiento Demócrata Independiente, and was found dead in his home on 19 May by reporters he had invited for a press conference, an apparent suicide. He gained a doctorate in political science from the Central University of Venezuela in 1946. A street in Maturín, Avenida Alirio Ugarte Pelayo, is named for him."

  "text" : "Albert de Lestang (1884 – 18 November 1959) was a French-Australian botanist. From his North Queensland property, Adel's Grove, de Lestang supplied seeds and plants to botanical gardens around the world. In 1946 he supplied seeds of a rare white-flowered water lily that the botanical world had been chasing since 1852. The seeds were sent to Kew Gardens but forwarded to Texas for propagation. The lily was originally referred to as a form of Nymphaea gigantea but is currently identified as a new species N. carpentariae. The cultivar 'Albert De L'Estang' is thought to be a different species, N. immutabilis. Born in Argentina to French-speaking parents, Albert de Lestang travelled around the world before settling in outback Queensland in the Gulf Country around 1920 taking up a freehold property in that region. Although there is no official confirmation, it is believed he was commissioned by the Queensland Government to experiment with the growing of tropical fruits and trees along Lawn Hill Creek. He used the creek for the supply of water for his project, pumping water to wells through canals near his plantings. Water also had to be transported in kerosene tins. By 1939 he had a list of over 1000 species introduced to his property. This list was forwarded to the Government Botanists C. T. White and W. D. Francis. His gathering of seeds for identification extends from 1925 with most being collected between 1938 and 1953. Brisbane Botanic Gardens has a collection of 536 different seed species provided by de Lestang. He also provided seeds to overseas contacts including Kew Gardens in England. It appears he had good relationships with the local aborigines employing them as seed gatherers. A small portion of his botanical oasis and some remains of his irrigation system still exist at Adel's Grove, \"The Frenchman's Garden\" now a tourist camping site surrounded by Lawn Hill Station. The name is made up form the initial letters of his own name.His origins are unclear. In a newspaper article in 1946 Mr. Trickett of Kew Gardens is quoted as saying De Lestang advised him that he ran away from his home in England following an argument with his father after a quarrel over a girl. The Brisbane Courier of 8 January 1914 contains an advertisement where A. De Lestang requests a position with horse breeders and dealers advising he had 15 years experience with horses and mules throughout Spain, France and Argentina.An article in the Cairns Post of 10 October 1923 carries a letter from the geologist Edward Grey advising he is part of an private expedition under the leadership of De Lestang making a crossing of the Australian continent collecting scientific data. He also ran a store at Adels' Grove for passing travelers. Unfortunately sometime in the 1950s, floods and native animals damaged his trees (believed to number 2000 by then.) Soon after, while he was absent from his home, fire destroyed his dwelling, possessions, his research and further damaged his botanical collection. Disheartened, suffering the effects of old age he eventually entered Charters Towers Eventide Home for the Aged where he spent his final years. Despite his attempts to find someone to take over the garden, it eventually succumbed to neglect, becoming a miners camp."

Francis was born in Danzig but left during World War II, first for Portugal, then by sea to Liverpool in the UK, where he joined the Polish 1st Armoured Division. After World War II, he changed his nationality to British, and his name to Alf Francis. He became a racing mechanic for Stirling Moss and the Chief Mechanic at Rob Walker Racing Team. At Rob Walker Racing Team, he maintained many Grand Prix cars including Cooper-Climax and Lotus 18, and helped developing the team's own Formula 1 car called Walker Special. Working with transmission engineer and designer Valerio Colotti, he became a partner of Colotti-Francis, and moved to Italy. In 1963 he returned to England where he was involved in the unsuccessful Derrington-Francis Formula One project. He subsequently emigrated to the USA, where he built cars for lower racing formulae. In 1966 he authored his biography Alf Francis: Racing Mechanic with journalist Peter Lewis."

This subversion paved the way for the development of a fusion model of Hindu-Christian religion, free from European missionary interference and also inspired the Indian national movement, largely centred on Bengal and Madras Presidency to fight against Western-dominated institutionalized church leading to separation of Christ from Church and Indianization of Christianity: to express and interpret Christianity and Biblical text in Indian context, socially, culturally, and religiously. He was also the founder of indigenous Seventh Day sect on the outskirts of town Nazareth, Tamil Nadu, and was indirectly responsible for establishing the first Seventh-day Adventist church in South India – Tamil Nadu."

On leaving the Army, he also became a Freemason, rising to become Grand Chaplain in 1863, commuting from Yorkshire to his London duties. After moving to London, his editorship of the Freemason ignited an interest in the study of Masonic history, and led to the establishment of Quatuor Coronati Lodge, dedicated to masonic research. Woodford was the first Immediate Past Master of the lodge, and as such convened the lodge for much of its first two years, during the frequent absences of Charles Warren, the master. Just before his death, towards the end of 1887, he passed on a set of coded papers which resulted in the establishment of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn."

  "text" : "Ali V Ben Ahmed, nicknamed Ali Khodja, Ali-Meguer, or Ali Loco (the mad) was the dey of the Regency of Algiers from September 1817, just after the assassination of his predecessor Omar Agha the 8th. He remained so until his death in February 1818. His sobriquet Ali-Meguer may indicate his Mingrelian background. Fearing plots against his rule he at one point had more than 1500 soldiers executed. A few days after his arrival, and to better ensure his safety, he left the Palace of the Djenina located in the lower part of the city of Casbah and offering small defences, to move to the fortress of the Casbah where he put the treasure safe. He died of the plague in February 28, 1818."

In 1959, Press was elected to the New South Wales Legislative Council as a member of the Australian Labor Party. However, she opposed the Labor policy of abolishing the Legislative Council, and together with a number of other Labor MLCs was expelled from the party shortly after her election; these members formed the Independent Labor Group. Eventually the group began to fragment, and Press joined the Liberal Party in 1967. When the Council became directly elected in 1978, Press did not nominate and retired.

Not long after, in September 1961, Amelia was elected to the Council as a nominee of the Independent Labor Group, which comprised those former Labor MLCs who opposed the party policy of abolishing the Legislative Council. Her election was made possible with the assistance of the Liberal Party, which exerted its influence to avoid the election of another Labor MLC.

The only international competition she is known to have participated in is a contest at Le Touquet in 1905, although the opportunity was open to her on several occasions.

  "text" : "Alfredo Zalce Torres (12 January 1908 – 19 January 2003) was a Mexican artist and contemporary of Diego Rivera, David Siqueiros and other better-known muralists. He worked principally as a painter, sculptor, and engraver, also taught, and was involved in the foundation of a number of institutions of culture and education. He is perhaps best known for his mural painting, typically imbued with \"fervent social criticism\". He is acclaimed as the first artist to borrow the traditional material of coloured cement as the medium for a \"modern work of art\". Publicity-shy, he is said to have turned down Mexico's Premio Nacional de Ciencias y Artes before finally accepting it in 2001. Before his death, Sotheby's described him as \"the most important living Mexican artist up to date\"."

He served as reeve for the rural municipality of Humboldt from 1931 to 1939 and as a member of the local school board from 1917 to 1942.

In 2002, he was asked to compete in a professional Trick Shot competition, The North American Championship, and after a 4th-place finish, he stayed in that discipline. Best known for his television appearances on ESPN, he has won many televised competitions such as Trick Shot Magic (2009, 2010 & 2014), The World Cup of Trick Shots (2006, 2008 & 2009), The WPA World Artistic Pool Championship (2007, 2011 & 2012) and The Masters Championship (2005, 2007 & 2009).

For Grand Duchess Olga Nikolaevna Romanova, he framed a pair of tondi after paintings by Fra Angelico (15th century), executed by Diomede della Bruna, a Florentine painter born in 1839 ( \"Elaborate, octagonal Baroque style frame with flame-carved border, ebony with part-gilt bronze fittings and 16 set carnelians each. On the verso the Florentine frame maker's label \"Ebanista Andrea Picchi\". 46 cm diameter each\"). (2) He also framed for Umberto I and his wife Queen Margherita of Savoy,two works by Tito Chelazzi - an oil painting of daisies (after the queen's name, Margherita, which means \"daisy\") and a mirror (roses thea painted on glass) the royal couple had commissioned from this painter, he too a sought after artist by European royal families. After some years in Via della Vigna Nuova, Picchi moved to Via Maggio,28, where he developed his artistry in carving ebony, a dense yet fine textured black wood. But his masterpiece in carving would be the excepcionally beautiful ebony and ivory cabinet in the style of the Italian Renaissance Picchi presented in the 1867 Paris Exhibition, though with \"a marked similarity in this design to that of a 17th century cabinet(...)\"as Frederick Litchfiel points out in his History of Furniture(3). In fact, when comparing the pictures of the two cabinets in Litchfiel's book, one may doubt if it is a mere coincidence or not. Nevertheless Picchi's cabinet remains a jewel of carving and an example of mastering ivory and ebony.Now in oblivion, only his oval stamp on the verso of some ebony framed works of the 19th century calls out \"Andrea Picchi, ebanista, Via Maggio, No. 28, Firenze\"."

  "text" : "Arthur Earl Baird, better known as Dr. Craig Earl, was a radio game show host in the 1930s and 1940s. Born in Medford, Massachusetts c. 1900, Baird hosted \"Professor Quiz\" from May 9, 1936, until the show concluded July 17, 1948. Baird claimed to have a degree in theology from Tufts University (in fact, he attended the college for two years but left without a diploma), and did an early exercise and health program on Boston radio in the early 1920s under that name. He claimed to be an orphan; however, his 1918 draft card recorded him as \"living at home in Medford with his folks and attending college\". By 1935, Baird was married, but during that year he suddenly vanished. As it turned out, Baird's disappearance was manufactured so he could avoid paying alimony or child support to his wife. He later made his way to New York and masqueraded as Dr. Craig Earl, scholar and world traveler, taking the job as \"quizmaster\" on \"Professor Quiz\" in 1936. The identity of \"Professor Quiz\" was a closely guarded secret until a Radio Daily article revealed him to be \"Dr. Craig Earl\" in 1937. In 1942, when his real identity was discovered, Baird was ordered to pay more than $25,000 to his ex-wife. (By this point, Baird had remarried, and his new wife assisted him on his quiz show, working as the scorekeeper.) In spite of the fairly widespread bad publicity, Baird continued to use the Earl identity, and his radio career continued. Sometime after leaving the air, Baird apparently legally changed his name to Craig Earl; he died in 1985."

He attended Fort Street Public School and left at the age of sixteen to become a drover, shearer and farm hand. In 1891 he bought a property near Grenfell, but in 1895 he was declared bankrupt. He was discharged in 1896 and became a stock and station agent. On 27 June 1900 he married Jane Eliza Stinson, with whom he had five children. He was elected to Weddin Shire Council in 1906 and served as president in 1913. In 1913 he was elected to the New South Wales Legislative Assembly as the Liberal member for Ashburnham. He was briefly a minister without portfolio assisting the Minister for Agriculture from February to April 1920. In that year, with the introduction of proportional representation, Grimm was elected as one of the members for Murrumbidgee, serving until 1925. He died at Manly in 1939."

In Jewish sources, Mendel Theben is referred to as manhig ufarnas ham'dina (English: \"leader and chief of the country\"), which means that the Jews of the entire kingdom recognised him as their leader. He maintained close relationship with the Habsburg court and Austrian aristocracy. He used his influence to promote the interests of his people, personally travelling to Vienna to intervene with Maria Theresa, Queen of Hungary, on behalf of Jews who had been imprisoned for a blood libel in the village of Orkuta. Mendel Theben was a special favourite of the Empress-Queen despite her strong Judeophobia and she listened to him with sympathy. He was the father of Jacob Mendel Theben.

He won 13 Gold Medal awards at the Chelsea Garden Show in London for this garden. He was the son of Major John Congreve and Lady Helena Blanche Irene Ponsonby, the daughter of the Eighth Earl of Bessborough. As a businessman he ran Humphreys & Glasgow, the gasworks manufacturers and petrochemical engineers, from 1939, when he took over from Dr Arthur Glasgow, his father-in-law and a co-founder of the firm. He remained there until 1983, when the company was sold to an American concern. However, his abiding passion was gardening, especially at Mount Congreve, near Kilmeaden, County Waterford. The Mount Congreve estate lies just outside the village of Kilmeadan. It is famous the world over for its rare species of plants and also its plant nurseries. It consists of around seventy acres of intensively planted woodland garden and a four-acre walled garden. In addition there are an 18th-century house (the ancestral home of Ambrose Congreve), ranges of glasshouses, more than 16 miles of paths and a wholesale nursery. After Congreve's death, aged 104 years, the Mount Congreve estate was left to the Irish State."

  "text" : "Andrew Hatcher (1923 – 1990) was an associate press secretary to President John F. Kennedy and a founder, in 1963, of 100 Black Men of America. Born in Princeton, New Jersey, Hatcher graduated from Witherspoon School for Colored Children in 1937 and Princeton High School in 1941. He attended Springfield College in Springfield, Mass. and served in the United States Army as a lieutenant during World War II. After his separation from the service, he relocated to San Francisco, California, working as a journalist and later as Assistant Secretary of Labor under Governor of California Pat Brown. Hatcher served under Adlai Stevenson as a speechwriter during Stevenson's two unsuccessful runs for President of the United States in 1952 and 1956. In 1960, he joined Sen. John F. Kennedy’s campaign press staff as a speechwriter with his close friend Pierre Salinger. Immediately after his election as President, Kennedy named both men to his White House staff, making Hatcher the first black person to serve in the White House Press Office. His young son Avery was a student in the home school which Jacqueline Kennedy established for her daughter Caroline Kennedy and children of White House staffers. Hatcher died in 1990."

Armando was identified in the lawsuit as a suspected embezzler who failed to make a kickback payment to the Chicago Outfit. According to the complaint, it was alleged that members of the Chicago Outfit, including Outfit boss John DiFronzo, schemed to extort money from the Fosco family, as if the family was in possession of said ill-gotten gains alleged to have been skimmed from the International Brotherhood of Teamsters. The case was ultimately dismissed for statute of limitations issues."

He was returned to Parliament for Horsham in 1715, a seat he held until 1721, when he succeeded his elder brother Rich in the viscountcy. This was a Scottish peerage and did not entitle him to an automatic seat in the House of Lords although he was forced to resign his seat in Parliament as Scottish peers were barred from sitting in the House of Commons. In 1728 he was made Lord-Lieutenant of the East Riding of Yorkshire, which he remained until his death.

  "text" : "Alfred Swieykowski (1869–1953) was a French painter of Russo-Polish descent. He studied under Fernand Cormon and Paulin Bertrand at the École des Beaux-Arts in Paris. He exhibited at the Salon des Artistes Francais (1894–1921), receiving an award in 1896 and another for the Exposition Universelle in Paris in 1900. He became member of the Société Nationale des Beaux-Arts and exhibited at its Salon from 1926 to 1943. He sat in the jury of the Société Nationale des Beaux-Arts in 1927 and won a silver medal in 1937 at the Exposition Internationale. Post-Impressionist, throughout his life he adopted at first a classic technique then a personal impressionist style, at times bordering on fauvism. He tackled a wide range of subjects but specialised in the landscapes of Paris, Normandy, Brittany and especially the Alps. An Aristocrat, he only signed the numerous paintings designed for exhibition, and often either exchanged or gave away his work so he was quite unknown in the art world. The 'Association des Amis d'Alfred Swieykowski' was formed in 2004, a non-profit group that locates and exhibits his paintings. Some 300 have been found so far."

  "text" : "Annius Plocamus was a Roman tax collector from the Mediterranean, who facilitated direct trade and the first contacts between the Roman Empire and Ancient Ceylon, present day Sri Lanka. The Romans had already heard about the island of Sri Lanka, which the Greeks had described under the name of Taprobane. However, according to Pliny, as described in his Natural History, it was during the reign of the Emperor Claudius (AD 41-54) that the two civilizations first met. A freedman of Annius Plocamus having farmed the customs of the Red Sea on behalf of his state's treasury, while sailing along the coast of Arabia, was driven by northern monsoon winds, passed Carmania and on the fifteenth day into Hippuros, a port of Ceylon. The freedman was entertained with hospitality by the Sinhalese monarch, where in six months time he acquired a thorough knowledge of Sinhala. With the freedman's description of the Romans and Caesar, as well as the impressive quality of Roman coins in his possession, the Sinhalese king sent an embassy to learn more about these people. According to Pliny, the decision to send an embassy was made by the king's perception of Roman honesty when the captured denarii turned out to be of the same weight. These coins were seized as rights dictated. The embassy of four envoys were sent to Rome, including ambassador-in-chief Rasaiah/Rachias."

  "text" : "Aubrey Francis Jackman MBE (1921 - 18 September 2010) was a leading producer of international military tattoos and prominent hotelier in Bath, England.Born in Bath in 1921, Jackman's family owned a number of hotels in the city, including the Lansdown Grove, Pulteney Hotel and Fernley (now known as the Abbey) Hotel. Following the outbreak of World War II, Jackman attempted to join the British Army, but with his agricultural experience (having studied at the Royal Agricultural College) he was instead sent to work on a farm in Somerset. In 1940 Jackman enlisted in the Local Defence Volunteers (Home Guard). He was then later permitted to join the Somerset Light Infantry as an officer in February 1941, rising to the rank of Major. Jackman's military postings included Egypt, Palestine, Lebanon, Greece, Italy and Austria. He became heavily involved in organising entertainment for the troops, and ended his Army career in 1947, have been demobilised without ever having to fire a shot in anger. On his return to England, Jackman took over the family hotel business, also taking on the role of president of the Bath Hoteliers' and Restaurateurs' Association for 40 years, while still keeping in touch with his military roots. From the mid-1950s to mid-1960s he was producer and director of the Bath Tattoo  and also the Wembley Military Pageant and Cardiff Searchlight Tattoo. In 1967 Jackman travelled to Canada as Production Consultant to the Canadian Armed Forces Tattoo 1967, still the world's largest travelling show, produced by Colonel Ian Fraser. Jackman thereafter became consultant of the Royal Nova Scotia International Tattoo. In 1977 he was producer for the Wembley Pageant given in honour of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II's Silver Jubilee. Through his work with military tattoos in the UK and overseas, also including those in Oman and Luxembourg, Jackman was appointed Chairman of the International Association of Tattoo Organisers (IATO). Jackman was also onetime chairman of Bath Conservative Association, and a supporter of the Army Benevolent Fund, the Royal Artillery Association, and the Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen and Families Association. He was also involved with the Armistice Day parades in the city of Bath. Major Jackman died in 2010, at the age of 89, having just finished writing his autobiography 'The Spice of Life', named after a march written for Jackman by Commander Jack McGuire, Director of Music Emeritus of the Royal Nova Scotia International Tattoo. Jackman's funeral was held at Bath Abbey on Monday 4 October 2010. He is buried in the family crypt in the Victorian graveyard at Beckford Tower, Bath."

  "text" : "Agneta Willeken (1497-1562) was the lover of the German mercenary Marcus Meyer, one of the most notable participators of the Count's Feud. She was pointed out as a political participator on the side of Lübeck in the propaganda of the war. She was the daughter of the merchant Peter Radkens of Hamburg and married the merchant Hans Willeken. Her spouse became ruined in 1527, and the couple moved to Lübeck, where she became a widow. She became the lover of Marcus Meyer, with whom she corresponded when he left to participate in the war. During Meyer's siege of Varberg Fortress in 1535, she sent him a letter, which was taken by the King of Denmark and used as propaganda material. This letter was used to point out Willeken as a major instigator and political participator of the war. She was pointed out as the main force behind the decision of the Lübeck mayor, Jürgen Wullenwever, to declare war on Holstein."
