  "text" : "Big Bow (1833–ca. 1900) was a Kiowa war chief during the 19th century, as a longtime fellow of Guipago and Satanta. Big Bow's name in Kiowa is Zepko-ette', also spelled Za-ko-yea. He was born in Elk Creek in Indian Territory in 1833. He was active in the Southern Plains, in the present day states of Kansas, Oklahoma, and Texas. Big Bow raided native and non-native settlements and took part in the Warren Wagon Train Raid, on May 18, 1871 on Salt Creek Prairie in Texas, along with Satank, Satanta, Mamanti, Tsen-tainte (White Horse), Ado-ete (Big Tree), Fast Bear, Yellow Wolf, Eagle Head.But Satanta, while asking the Indian Agent on the Kiowa-Comanche Reservation for ammunition and supplies, bragged that he had led the war party at Salt Creek Prairie, and told Satank and young war leader Ado-ete (Big Tree) were there too; he didn't call the names of Mamanti, Tsen-tainte (White Horse), Ado-ete (Big Tree), Fast Bear, Yellow Wolf, Eagle Head, so they weren't arrested. On April 20, 1872 Zepko-ete and Tsen-tainte, with about one hundred of their Kiowa warriors and Comanche allies, attacked a government wagon train at Howard Wells station, along the San Antonio - El Paso trail, killing 17 Mexicans and kidnapping a woman; two companies (A and H) of 9th Cavalry from Fort Clark, led by capt. N. Cooney and lt. F. R. Vincent, got the Indians, but were forced to retreat after suffering two casualties (lt. Vincent himself, deadly wounded, and a \"Buffalo Soldier\"; ten Indians (four in the assault on the wagon train and six in the fight against the \"Buffalo Soldiers\") were reported to have been killed.Big Bow joined Guipago and the Comanche under Quanah and made a name for himself in the Comanche Campaign and the Red River War; he was one of the last to surrender (following Tene-angopte's advice), in January 1875, to the United States, before Guipago's surrendering on February 25, 1875.Committed to anti-white ideals and a path of resistive violence, Big Bow refused to sign the Treaty of Medicine Lodge in 1867, which relocated the Kiowa and Comanche to live together on a reservation in western Oklahoma and Texas. Although failed, Big Bow also participated in the Battle of Adobe Walls, a violent struggle in an attempt to push invaders out from hunting buffalo on their tribal lands. His defiance and frustration against the white-washing of his land and traditions revealed itself through his violent endeavors and actions. So committed to bloodshed to fight for his beliefs, Thomas Battey, a Quaker missionary close to the tribe, commented on his ferocious countenance. Determined to preserve his lands, he was devoted to violence as an enforcer. When the Kiowas were forced onto their reservation in 1875, Tene-angopte didn't include him in the number of Kiowa chiefs and warriors to be deported to Fort Marion, Florida, and Big Bow and his family settled near Rainy Mountain in Indian Territory."

  "text" : "Bull Chief, born in 1825 with an unknown death date, was part of the Crow, or Apsaroke tribe. He was interviewed by a man named Edward S. Curtis, who visited many tribes during the 20th century for interviews and to take portraits of the Natives. As a young man Bull Chief was never very successful when he was part of war-parties and always returned home without honor. He believed it was unnecessary for one to fast in order to be successful in a battle, and therefore opted not to fast. Being so unsuccessful after returning from battle after battle, Bull Chief decided to climb Cloud Peak, which is the highest peak of the Bullhorn Mountains in Wyoming. Bull Chief stayed up on Cloud Peak for one day and one night hoping to have a vision, but having no luck he had to leave because mountain-rats were biting through his clothes and a fierce blizzard was causing hazardous conditions. When Bull Chief returned home, his village was getting ready to be moved to a new location. Based on landmarks mentioned in the new location, it appears the tribe was moved near Red Lodge Creek, MT. During this transition time, Bull Chief decided to continue trying to fast in order to have a vision. He fasted for four days and four nights, but still had no vision. After which, he tried two more times unsuccessfully. Seeing that his current attempts were failing, and all of the other men in his tribe counting coup he again decided to try something new. For this attempt, he went up to the head of Red Lodge Creek to fast for four days and for four nights in blinding snow. This time his experience turned out much different from all of his previous attempts. He had a vision in which he, “Saw his own lodge and a splendid bay horse standing in front of it.” It was not explained as to what this vision meant, but thereafter Bull Chief began to do remarkably well in battles. Shortly after the vision, Bull Chief was able to get his first honor and started counting coupe frequently. Counting coup is the highest honor for winning intertribal wars between Plains Indians. Bull Chief's determination and personal strength helped him to his successes as a hunter, in combat, and in spiritual pursuits."

He also served in World War II as an infantry officer and the chief of staff of an Australian and two British divisions. When he was a captain in the Australian Army, Robertson was wounded during the capture of Tobruk from Italian forces. After this incident, Robertson was posted in Greece to fight against German forces. Later in New Guinea, by now promoted to the rank of lieutenant colonel and filling a senior liaison officer role, Robertson was ordered to inspect the US Army perimeter at Buna. Robertson was unsatisfied with what he saw, and reported his observations to General Edmund Herring, and General Richard K. Sutherland who was also present at the time. Consequently, Douglas MacArthur made changes to the US Army command at Buna. In August 1943, Robertson was again promoted, this time to the position of General Staff Officer, Grade 1 to George Vasey, and Commanding Officer of the 7th AIF Division. During the Salamaua-Lae campaign, Vasey sent Robertson to Port Moresby to seek better relations with the US Army, and his manner was said to have surprised both the USAAF's General George Kenney and General Frank Berryman. Robertson later wrote to Vasey that he had succeeded in his task. Robertson, as Vasey's senior staff officer, was later involved in an operation following the capture of a Japanese order document. During World War II, Robertson served in Europe with the British Army 51st (Highland) Infantry Division in March 1944."

  "text" : "Boris Moiseyevich Schein (born June 22, 1938) is a Russian-American mathematician, an expert in semigroups, and a Distinguished Professor in the Department of Mathematical Sciences at the University of Arkansas. Schein was born in Moscow on June 22, 1938, but moved to Saratov during World War II. He became interested in mathematics as a teenager, and came under the influence of Viktor Wagner, a professor of mathematics at Saratov State University. Schein did his undergraduate studies in Mechanics-Mathematics at Saratov State, and chose to specialize in geometry, Wagner's subject. In 1958 he solved the problem of characterizing the semigroups that could be embedded into an inverse semigroup. He graduated summa cum laude in 1960. He continued working as a graduate student with Wagner, and in 1962 defended a candidacy dissertation on semigroups of transformations at the Herzen State Pedagogical University of Russia in Saint Petersburg. He accepted a faculty position at Saratov in 1963, and defended his Ph.D. theses in 1966, again at Herzen State Pedagogical University. In 1968, Schein was one of the founding editors of the journal Semigroup Forum, published by Springer-Verlag. However, in the 1970s his connections with Western mathematicians led to political difficulties, his correspondence with mathematicians outside the USSR was cut off, and his students were prevented from graduating. Eventually, in the late 1970s, his mentor Wagner retired from the university and Schein was dismissed. In 1979, Schein was able to travel to Austria with his wife and daughter, and immediately he obtained a temporary visiting position at Tulane University in New Orleans. In 1980, he took his present position at the University of Arkansas. In 2011, Schein was named a distinguished reviewer of Zentralblatt MATH by the European Mathematical Society."

Walsh was a two time Canadian champion skip, having won the Brier for Manitoba in 1952 and 1956. Walsh was born in 1917 in Ontario and moved to Winnipeg as an infant. After graduating from high school, he worked at the Comptroller General's office for the Government of Manitoba, where he worked for the rest of his life. He served with the Royal Winnipeg Rifles during World War II. Walsh won his first of two national championships at the 1952 Macdonald Brier in Winnipeg. The Walsh rink, which included Al Langlois, Andy McWilliams and John Watson, went undefeated at the event, winning all ten matches. They clinched the event in their second last game, when they beat Alberta's Art Simpson, 9-7. Simpson had up until then just lost one match, and a win could have forced a tie breaker for the championship. At the 1956 Macdonald Brier, the Walsh rink finished the round robin with a record of 8-2, tied with Ontario's Alf Phillips. This forced a one game playoff to determine the champion between the two rinks. Walsh won the match 8-7, in an extra end in front of 3200 fans at Moncton Stadium to capture his second national title. Walsh's 1956 team consisted of Langlois, Cy White and McWilliams. Walsh died in 1971 after a long illness. He was inducted into the Canadian Curling Hall of Fame in 1975."

  "text" : "Bredo Greve is a Norwegian anarchist and filmmaker, who made 3 feature-length films and 12 short films, from 1966 to 1986. His films handle social critical subjects, such as nature conservation, critique of technology and modern society. Most of them share a pessimistic view about the future, but often with a touch of humor. He was also known for making movies on an extreme low budget, usually shooting on 16 mm. Having all his own film equipment, he was very self-reliant, and an independent filmmaker in the true sense of the word. In 1976 he got a lot of media-attention for his film The Stone Wood Witches. It was an unconventional and controversial film about the teachings of a modern witch, inspired by Carlos Castaneda's books about Don Juan. Many people found it to be “morally degrading and anti-christian”. Among them was the cinema manager in the city of Hønefoss, who denied to screen the movie because of its morals. In protest Bredo screened the movie outside on the wall of the cinema, which led into a lawsuit plus many debates about Norwegian film politics. Although Bredo Greve was an outspoken and well-known figure in the Norwegian film community back in the 70’s, most people today don’t know who he is. None of his films are out on DVD, and have never been commercially released on VHS. Still he has left a deep impact on many of those who experienced his movies back in their time. Among Bredo Greve’s most important works are: That Fancy Furcoat of Yours (1977), The Stone Wood Witches (1976) and Film a Wonderful World (1978)."

  "text" : "William Sirs (6 January 1920 – 16 June 2015) was a British trade unionist, who served as general secretary of the Iron and Steel Trades Confederation (ISTC) from 1975 to 1985. Bill Sirs was born and raised in Hartlepool, one of 10 children. He left school at 14 and became a crane operator in the iron and steel industry, becoming active in the forerunners to the ISTC. He remained in north-east England until he moved south with his two children and his wife Joan. Sirs is best remembered for his involvement in the steelworkers' strike of 1980. During the action Sirs came into conflict with Ian MacGregor, the man appointed by Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher to slim down British Steel Corporation, then a nationalised industry. Sirs was quoted as saying, \"We are being looked upon as the worst producing steel nation in Europe\". Sirs subsequently incurred the wrath of other trade unionists by his intervention in the miners' strike of 1984."

He competed for Britain in the 1996 Olympic road race and represented Scotland at the Commonwealth Games in 1986, 1990 and 1998. He also won the Grand Prix Midtbank in 1994. Since 2009, he has commentated on cycle racing for British Eurosport. He also joined the Endura Racing cycling team as general manager in 2011. Following Endura's merger with the German-based NetApp squad at the end of 2012 to form NetApp–Endura, Smith was initially appointed to the role of assistant general manager before becoming the team's Business Development Manager. In July 2014 team MTN–Qhubeka appointed Brian Smith as interim general manager until the end of the year as he had participated in the formation of the now-defunct Cervélo TestTeam. In addition Smith acts as manager to Czech rider Leopold König. In April 2016 it was announced that Smith would leave Team Dimension Data (as MTN-Qhubeka had become) at the end of the month by mutual consent, with Smith explaining that his role had become less hands-on and more focussed on administration and logistics with the team's achievement of UCI WorldTeam status. Smith is the founder of the Braveheart Cycling Fund, which was launched in 2003 to support young Scottish racing cyclists."

Krechting was born in Schöppingen, Münster, the son of the town clerk and church musician Engelbert Krechting. Like his five brothers, he received higher education. He became a priest, a tutor for the Earl in Bentheim and a pastor at Gildehaus in the county of Bentheim. But when he proclaimed Anabaptist teachings, he was removed from his position. With many that he had convinced, he moved to Westphalian Munster (the so-called \"New Jerusalem\"), where he was one of the Anabaptist preachers. In the court of Jan van Leiden, he served on the Council with his brother Heinrich Krechting, the Chancellor of the Anabaptist kingdom. Heinrich, however, escaped capture, while Bernhard Krechting, probably on behalf of his brother, suffered an agonizing end. On 22 January 1536 he was tortured to death with Jan van Leiden and Bernhard Knipperdolling at the principal market in Munster. As a deterrent to those who opposed the Catholic Church, their bodies were placed in three iron cages hung from the tower of the Lamberti Church, where they have remained into the 21st century."

He resigned from his position as Chairman soon after and was replaced by Dave Richards. He was appointed an OBE in 1991 for services to Sheffield."

He holds a doctorate in clinical psychology from Duquesne University. In 2011, Robbins co-authored an open letter from the Society for Humanistic Psychology regarding the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders's fifth edition, the DSM-5. The letter has been endorsed by thirteen other American Psychological Association divisions, and has been signed as a petition by over 15,000 people. In a recent San Francisco Chronicle article about the debate over the DSM-5, Robbins noted that, under the new guidelines, certain responses to grief could be labeled as pathological disorders, instead of being recognized as being normal human experiences."

Erdmann received his Ph.D. in 1873 from the University of Berlin with a dissertation on Kant. The title of his thesis was Die Stellung des Dinges an sich in Kants Aesthetik und Analytik. Hermann von Helmholtz proposed Erdmann's publication Die Axiome der Geometrie (1877) as the basis for a habilitation. In 1878 he became an associate professor at the University of Berlin, in 1879 a full professor at the University of Kiel, and in 1884 he went to the University of Wroclaw, in 1890 to the University of Halle, in 1898 to the University of Bonn and in 1909 he returned to Berlin."

Born in London, she made her music hall debut in Bermondsey, London. She became popular with cockney working-class audiences and went on to appear on the same bill as Jenny Hill at the Canterbury Theatre of Varieties and Vesta Tilley at Gatti's Charing Cross Music Hall. Off-stage, she became a popular figure in London for her many charitable donations to the poor. In later life, Bellwood suffered from alcoholism as a result of her financial troubles and bankruptcy. With her health in decline, she died at her home in London aged 40."

  "text" : "Barry Seymour Gomersall (1945–2007) was an Australian rugby league referee. Gomersall refereed six rugby league internationals and nine State of Origin series matches. Nicknamed \"the Grasshopper\", Gomersall was known for his thin legs inside tight shorts and his habit of ignoring on-field fights. First appointed to referee State of Origin by the Queensland Rugby League in 1982, Gomersall was often accused by New South Wales supporters of bias. A reporter from New South Wales once asked: \"How do you account for the fact that in your nine matches Queensland won seven and NSW won only two?\", Gomersall was said to have replied \"Well, surely anyone's entitled to two bad games.\" Gomersall placed a high priority on personal fitness saying \"if someone is going to score a try, I want to be there first\". Gomersall was a long time Queensland Rail employee. After his refereeing career, Gomersall entered Queensland politics, standing for the electoral district of Mirani in five elections. Barry Gomersall died in Sarina in central Queensland on 9 February 2007  from prostate cancer aggravated by collision with livestock on his farm."

During his first two seasons at the latter club he only made 3 appearances, however the following two seasons saw him play 45 times. After these two seasons he was unable to establish himself in the first team and moved to Watford in 1938. Although he was on the Watford books until 1946, his last play was in three Southern League appearances in the incomplete 1939-40 season which was cut short by the Second World War. In 1949-50 he was team coach with Rickmansworth Town. Dabbs, who lived at Prenton, Birkenhead, at the time of his transfer to Watford, made his lifelong home at Croxley Green, Hertfordshire, until he moved into a care home shortly before his death at Chelmsford, Essex, in December 2000, aged 91."

  "text" : "Brenda Berkman (born 1951) is a pioneering female firefighter. She filed the lawsuit that resulted in the first women being hired by the New York City Fire Department in 1982. In 1977 the FDNY used a physical test that all the women applying to be firefighters failed, including Berkman; she sued on the grounds of gender discrimination and won, and a new test was created in which standards were changed so the test was job-related. Berkman and 40 other women passed the new job-related test. (See Brenda Berkman, et al. v. The City of New York, CV-79-1813, 536 F. Supp. 177 (E.D.N.Y. 1982), aff’d Berkman v. City of New York, 705 F.2d 584 (2d Cir. 1983.)) She joined the FDNY in 1982. The struggle of women to join the FDNY, and Berkman's part in it, was featured in a 2006 PBS documentary called Taking The Heat.  Berkman was the founder of the United Women Firefighters, an organization for women in the FDNY, and was its president from 1982 until 1986. Her awards include: the Susan B. Anthony Award from the National Organization for Women (1984), a Revson Fellowship on the Future of the City of New York, from Columbia University (1987-1988), the Distinguished Alumni Award from St. Olaf College, and the Women of Courage Award from the National Organization for Women (2002). Berkman responded to the World Trade Center attacks, and in 2012 a self-portrait she created was exhibited at the 9/11 Decade Exhibit at the Westbeth Sculpture Gallery Annex. Her experience was also featured in the book Women at Ground Zero: stories of courage and compassion. She retired in 2006 at the rank of Captain. She is openly lesbian, and was the first openly gay person to be a professional firefighter and a White House Fellow."

Von Laffert accompanied Adolf Hitler to the German Opera House in Berlin, Germany in December 1935. She was rumored to be a romantic companion of Hitler during the time he neglected his companion Eva Braun, between early March and late May 1935. Von Laffert was a member of the Alliance of German Maidens (Bund Deutscher Mädel, or BDM) during the year 1932-1933. This was the girls' branch of the Hitler Youth. A blonde woman, she was considered among the most beautiful women around Hitler. She was invited by him to various festive events. Among these was a National Day of Celebration of the German People, held on May 1, 1934. The occasion was staged as a large propaganda public display at Tempelhof Field. Von Laffert continued to appear at important Nazi government functions as late as March 1939. In 1939 she was invited to a state dinner in the Chancellor's home. It is plausible that Eva Braun was forbidden to appear on such occasions."

  "text" : "\"Count\" Byron Khun de Prorok (1896–1954, born in Philadelphia as Francis Byron Kuhn) was a Polish-American amateur archaeologist, anthropologist, and author of four heroic travelogues. He has come to be regarded as the original tomb raider, \"loved by audiences and held in contempt by the scientific community\". Count Byron De Prorok was educated at the University of Geneva. He worked on the excavations at Carthage from 1920 to 1925 and held the Archaeological Institute of America's prestigious Norton Lectureship in 1922–1923. During the later 1920s and early 1930s, Prorok undertook a series of expeditions in Africa of dubious scientific value, pursuing ancient legends and eventually came to believe he had found evidence that proved Atlantis lay in North Africa, the true location of the fabled Biblical land of Ophir and what he supposed were the ruins of an ancient temple where Alexander the Great \"became a god\". In addition to these tremendous 'discoveries' he also claimed to be a member of the Order of the Holy Sepulchre, the Royal Archaeological Institute and The Royal Geographical Society. His numerous critics say that this \"count\" Byron de Prorok was neither a real count nor an archaeologist, was expelled from The Royal Geographical Society (allegedly in 1932), who had \"a vivid imagination\" and \"was given to gross exaggeration\". He was, however, an active member of the Adventurers' Club of New York. Regardless of his archaeological faults, De Prorok was a pioneer in using motion pictures, which he did first in 1920. However, none of his films survive. His published works include Digging for Lost African Gods (1926), Mysterious Sahara: The Land of Gold, of Sand and of Ruin (1929), Dead Men Do Tell Tales (1933) and In Quest of Lost Worlds (1935)."

  "text" : "Bradley C. S. Watson is a Canadian-born American political science educator, lawyer, and writer, and a member of the “West Coast Straussian” school of political thought. He is professor of politics at Saint Vincent College in Latrobe, Pennsylvania, where he holds the Philip M. McKenna Chair in American and Western Political Thought. He is co-director of the college’s Center for Political and Economic Thought, a public policy educational and research institute dedicated to advancing “scholarship on philosophical and policy concerns related to freedom and Western civilization with particular regard to the American experience.”  He has held visiting faculty appointments at Princeton University and Claremont McKenna College. He is a fellow of several think tanks, and a Senior Scholar at the Intercollegiate Studies Institute. He was born in Toronto and educated in Canada, Belgium, and the United States, earning a B.A. from the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, a J.D. from Queen's University Faculty of Law in Kingston, Ontario, an M.Phil. from the Institute of Philosophy, University of Leuven (Louvain), Belgium, and an M.A. and Ph.D. from the Claremont Graduate University in California. His publications concentrate on several themes: the unfolding of the liberal idea in the modern world, particularly through courts of law; the problems and prospects of higher education, particularly civic education, in liberal societies;  and the strengths and weaknesses of the West in the face of an illiberal foe—Islamism. Watson is a critic of American progressivism. He has appeared on the Glenn Beck television program to discuss his book Living Constitution, Dying Faith: Progressivism and the New Science of Jurisprudence. He has argued that the idea of a “living constitution,” which he traces largely to social Darwinism and pragmatism, undermines the American founders’ Constitution dedicated to fixed natural truths, and is a slippery slope toward moral and political nihilism He has also been critical of both legal positivism and the deontological liberalism of John Rawls, arguing that they fail to provide a stable foundation for constitutional interpretation,  and of same-sex marriage, arguing that it is antithetical to moral realism and essentialism. Although West Coast Straussianism is usually understood to be a version of political conservatism, Watson has been attacked from various points on the conservative spectrum, including by Harry V. Jaffa, the acknowledged founder of the West Coast Straussians. Jaffa has suggested that Watson is insufficiently critical of the legal positivism of conservative Judge Robert H. Bork,  while others have suggested he is too critical.  Meanwhile, traditionalist conservatives have denied Watson’s claim that universal philosophical principles played an important role in the American founding. Watson has defended both natural rights philosophy and cultural traditions as essential elements of the American experience, and of a complete understanding of the U.S. Constitution."

Bo attended Harrow School, read PPE at Oxford University, and studied for a master's degree at Harvard University. In 2016, Bo graduated from Columbia Law School with a Juris Doctor degree. Because his father was a high-ranking Communist Party official, Bo Guagua's alleged lavish lifestyle has been an occasional topic of news media gossip, which intensified and gained considerable international attention when his father was removed from office in March 2012. Both his parents came under investigation in the alleged homicide of family friend Neil Heywood, who also reportedly helped Bo during his time in the UK. Bo's father is often described as a \"princeling\" (offspring of Communist Party elite); his lifestyle and privileges typify those of fuerdai, and far exceed those of regular Chinese people of his age."

  "text" : "Barry Thomas Smitherman (born September 13, 1957) is a lawyer who served as a member and chairman of the Texas Railroad Commission from 2011 to 2015. A Republican, he was appointed to the commission on July 8, 2011 by then Governor Rick Perry to fill a vacant post; on February 28, 2012 he was elected chairman of the commission, which regulates not railroads but the Texas oil and gas industry. In 2013, Smitherman announced his candidacy to succeed Greg Abbott as state attorney general in the Republican primary election held on March 4, 2014, when Abbott polled 91.5 percent of the ballots cast to win the party's nomination for governor to succeed the retiring Rick Perry, who declined to seek a fourth full term. Smitherman's opponents were State Senator Ken Paxton of McKinney in Collin County and State Representative Dan Branch of Dallas County. Smitherman finished in third place with 281,064 votes (22.1 percent) in the attorney general's race, but his voters, depending on overall turnout, could be critical to the outcome of the runoff election on May 27 between the leading votegetter, Ken Paxton, and the runner-up, Dan Branch."

Artley also wrote or illustrated many books, most of which recount his memories of growing up on his parent's Northern Iowa farm during the first half of the 20th Century."

She currently lives and works in Berlin, Germany.Sellmann also holds a Master of Fine Arts degree from Hunter College, NYC. In her paintings Sellmann uses a watercolor-on-canvas technique in \"candy colored acrylic tones (bonbonbunte Acryltöne)\" and “multi-layers of translucent pigments in pale pinks, powder blues, and acidic yellows and greens“.Works of her have been described as “see-through versions of Old Master paintings ... gone translucent and ethereal“, \"particular reverie-inducers“, exploring “the other side of pink“. Recent paintings combine kidult and fairy tale \"romanticism“ (Cassandra Neyenesch) with influences of Far Eastern spirituality. Inspired by Balinese energy master Ratu Bagus she performed a space clearing at Wonderloch Kellerland Berlin in 2011, which could be considered either an empty room or \"a purely transcendent exhibition“. She has works in private and public collections, such as the Museum of Modern Art, New York."

  "text" : "Bill Stukus (1916 - July 1, 2003) was an award winning, all-star and Grey Cup champion Canadian football quarterback. Stukus started with the Toronto Argonauts, winning a Grey Cup in 1937 and 1938, and being named an all-star. Perhaps his best season was in 1942, with the wartime all-military Toronto RCAF Hurricanes, when he was an all-star, won a third Grey Cup and was the Ontario Rugby Football Union Imperial Oil Trophy winner as MVP. He played with the Toronto Indians and then returned to the Argonauts in 1947, winning his fourth Grey Cup. He played 48 regular season and 17 playoff games for the Argos. He finished his career playing three seasons with the Edmonton Eskimos. While serving in the RCAF during the war, he also had the good fortune to play in the famed Tea Bowl, where the Canadian Army football team defeated the American Army team 16-6 at White City Stadium on February 13, 1944 in London, England. Bill was one of the famed Stukus brothers. Bill and his brothers Annis and Frank played together in the offensive backfield of the 1938 Grey Cup champion Argonaut team."

His works included Notizie dei cambi (1582) and Lezione delle monete (1588). His Scisma d'Inghilterra was first published in 1602 in Rome. It was a concise version of a work of Girolamo Pollini, on the English Reformation, which itself was dependent on a Latin work of 1585 written by Nicholas Sander and Edward Rishton. John Milton used its imprimaturs (from the 1638 edition) as an illustration on his Areopagitica."

  "text" : "Bascom Nolley Timmons (March 31, 1890 – June 8, 1987) was an American newspaperman based in Washington, D.C., in a career that spanned all or parts of six decades. He was an advisor to U.S. Presidents Calvin Coolidge and Franklin D. Roosevelt, who had been competing opposite party candidates for Vice President of the United States in 1920. Oddly, like the late Governor Claude R. Kirk, Jr., of Florida, Timmons himself once sought to run for vice president, but the position is now selected by the presidential nominee of a political party. Timmons offered his candidacy in 1940, when his friend John Nance Garner declined to join President Roosevelt in seeking a third term as vice president. The nomination finally went to Henry A. Wallace of Iowa. In 1968, the Republican Kirk \"ran\" with the understanding that he would complement a ticket headed by either Richard M. Nixon or Nelson A. Rockefeller. Nixon, the successful nominee, however, tapped Governor Spiro T. Agnew of Maryland, for the second slot on the ticket. A native of Amarillo, Texas, Timmons began his career in journalism at the age of sixteen with the former Fort Worth Record in Fort Worth, Texas. He later worked for the defunct Dallas Times-Herald, the Amarillo News, and the Milwaukee Sentinel. In 1912, he joined the Washington Post. In 1920, Timmons created a bureau in the nation's capital, to serve newspapers in Texas, Oklahoma, Louisiana, Alabama, and Ohio. In 1932, Timmons became president of the National Press Club; in that capacity, he worked thereafter to save the press club building in New York City from foreclosure. He persuaded President Franklin Roosevelt to sign an amendment to the federal bankruptcy law that blocked the foreclosure and hence kept the building open. He was a member of the Sigma Delta Chi hall of fame. In 1944, Timmons hired Sarah McClendon as the Washington correspondent for the Philadelphia Daily News. Two years later when Timmons dismissed McClendon to provide jobs for returning World War II veterans, she started her own McClendon News Service and remained a Washington institution for decades. Timmons was widely respected and liked in Washington, D.C., but his reporting long infuriated Lyndon B. Johnson. Timmons' press bureau served a number of newspapers. His biggest customer, the Fort Worth Star-Telegram, listed him as its chief correspondent. Shortly after Johnson became President, he surreptitiously pressured the Amon G. Carter, Jr., the Star-Telegram's owner, to drop Timmons. The paper gradually phased him out; Timmons seemed unaware of Johnson's role. Timmons died at his home in Washington, D.C., of pneumonia at the age of ninety-seven."

  "text" : "Berthold Hatschek (3 April 1854 – 18 January 1941) was an Austrian zoologist remembered for embryological and morphological studies of invertebrates. He studied zoology in Vienna under Carl Claus (1835-1899), and in Leipzig with Rudolf Leuckart (1822-1898). He gained his doctorate at the University of Leipzig with a dissertation titled Beiträge zur Entwicklungsgeschichte der Lepidopteren. Hatschek was deeply influenced by the works of Ernst Haeckel (1834-1919). In 1885 he was appointed professor of zoology at Charles University in Prague, and from 1896 was a professor and director of the second zoological institute at the University of Vienna. Hatschek suffered from severe depression, which greatly affected his work in the latter stages of his life. Hatschek is remembered for the so-called \"trochophore theory\", in which he explains the trochophore to be the larval form of a hypothetical organism- the \"trochozoon\" (which in adult form corresponded to a trochophore-like rotifer, and was the suggested common ancestor of almost all bilateral, metazoan lifeforms). In 1888 he split Frey and Leuckart's Coelenterata into three phyla: Spongiaria, Cnidaria and Ctenophora. From his research of amphioxus, the anatomical terms- \"Hatschek's pit\" and \"Hatschek's nephridium\" are derived."

  "text" : "Brian Brinkley (born 28 December 1953) is an English former competitive swimmer who represented Great Britain in the Olympic Games, FINA world championships and European championships, and England in the Commonwealth Games, during the 1970s. During his elite swimming career, he won thirteen medals in major international swimming championships. At the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich, West Germany, Brinkley qualified to compete in six events: the 100-, 200-, 400- and 1500-metre freestyle events, the 200-metre butterfly, and the 4x200-metre freestyle relay. His best performances were fourth in the 400-metre freestyle final, and eighth as a member of the British men's team in the 4x200-metre freestyle relay. Brinkley was a member of the British national team at the 1974 European Aquatics Championships in Vienna, winning a pair of silver medals in the men's 200-metre butterfly and as a member of the British team in the 4x100-metre medley relay. When Christchurch, New Zealand hosted the 1974 British Commonwealth Games, he swam for England in six events, winning medals in all of them. He won a gold medal for his first-place performance in the 200-metre butterfly, and two silver medals for finishing second in the 200-metre and 400-metre individual medley events. He was also a member of all three of England's relay teams, winning a silver in the 4x200-metre freestyle, and bronzes in the 4x100-metree freestyle and 4x100-metre medley. At the 1975 World Aquatics Championships, he won a silver medal with the British men in the 4x200-metre freestyle relay, and three bronze medals in the 200-metre freestyle, 200-metre butterfly, and 4x100-metre medley relay. A year later in Montreal, Quebec, at the 1976 Summer Olympics, Brinkley competed in four events. He was a member of the fourth-place British team in the men's 4x100-metre medley relay, and won a bronze medal with the third-place British men in the 4x200-metre freestyle relay. In individual competition, he advanced to the event final of the 200-metre butterfly and came sixth. He also swam in the preliminary heats of the 200-metre freestyle but did not advance."

  "text" : "Bullen Reymes (28 December 1613 - 18 December 1672) was an English courtier, diplomat and politician who sat in the House of Commons from 1660 to 1672. He fought in the Royalist army in the English Civil War. Reymes was the eldest son of Bullen Reymes of Westminster and his wife Mary Petre, daughter of William Petre of Torbryan, Devon. He was educated privately and travelled abroad where he was attaché at the Paris embassy from 1631 to 1632 and based in Venice (where he played the lute and 'red in Shakespeares playes') from 1634 to 1635 and 1636 to 1637 but also visited Sicily, met Artemisia Gentileschi in Naples and travelled as far as Athens, where he saw 'the beautiful ruins' before the disastrous 1687 explosion in the Parthenon. He was a captain of foot in 1640 and a gentleman of the privy chamber from 1641 to 1646. He supported the King in the Civil War and was colonel of horse in the Royalist army from 1643 to 1646. He was active in defending Exeter and was made a freeman in 1645. The city surrendered in 1646 and he laid down his arms. He was treated leniently by the committee for compounding for Dorset and paid no more than £100. In 1650, he was imprisoned in Taunton Castle and after the Battle of Worcester helped some Royalists to escape abroad. He succeeded to the heavily mortgaged estates of his father in 1652. In June 1660, Reymes was elected Member of Parliament for Weymouth and Melcombe Regis in a by-election to the Convention Parliament. He resumed his position as gentleman of the privy chamber in the same month.He was servant to the Duke of Gloucester until September 1660 and was commissioner for assessment for Dorset from August 1660 to 1669. In 1661 he was re-elected MP for Weymouth and Melcombe Regis in the Cavalier Parliament and proved to be a very active member. In the same year he became freeman of Weymouth and Vice Admiral of Dorset until his death. He was commissioner for loyal and indigent officers for Dorset in 1662 and commissioner for assessment for Westminster from 1663 to 1669. At this time he was involved in a feud with the Strangways family over various matters. He was commissioner for sick and wounded in Hampshire and Dorset 1664 to 1667 and was appointed commissioner for Tangier from 1664 until his death. He became a freeman of Portsmouth in 1665 and was deputy treasurer of prizes at Portsmouth from 1665 to 1667. He had become a merchant of sailcloth and was supplying sailcloth to the navy at the time of the second Dutch war when he had several minor administrative posts. In 1668 he became surveyor of the Great Wardrobe and achieved great savings after the mismanagement of the previous post holder. He was commissioner for sick and wounded for Hampshire and Dorset again from 1671 until his death. Reymes died at the age of 68. Reymes married Elizabeth Gerard, daughter of Thomas Gerard of Trent, Somerset in 1640 and had three sons and two daughters."

  "text" : "Barbara Annette Robbins (July 26, 1943 – March 30, 1965) was an American secretary employed by the Central Intelligence Agency. She was killed in a car bombing of the United States Embassy, Saigon. Robbins was the first female employee to be killed in action in the CIA's history, the first American woman killed in the Vietnam War and, as of 2012, the youngest CIA employee to die in action. Robbins was born in South Dakota and raised primarily in Colorado, where she received secretarial training at Colorado State University from 1961-1963. She joined the CIA soon after graduation, motivated by a desire to participate in efforts to combat communism. Robbins, who had not previously traveled outside the United States, volunteered for the assignment in Saigon. When asked by her father Buford, a Navy veteran, about her decision, she reportedly told him: \"When they [the Communists] get to West Colfax [a Denver neighborhood], mister, you'll wish you'd done something.\" On March 30, 1965, a car bomb exploded outside the embassy. Before the explosion, there was a confrontation between the driver and a policeman and Robbins went to the window of her second-story office to see what was happening; she was killed instantly. A Filipino storekeeper serving in the US Navy was killed, along with 19 Vietnamese. The CIA honored Robbins with a star on the Memorial Wall in its headquarters building in Langley, Virginia. The wall pays tribute to personnel killed while working for the agency. However, for many years the agency omitted Robbins' name from the display's Book of Honor, which lists the names of the slain employees, citing security concerns since Robbins was working under the guise of an employee of the State Department. In May 2011, CIA Director Leon Panetta announced that Robbins' name would be inscribed in the Book of Honor. Robbins was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor First Class by South Vietnamese Foreign Minister Tran Van Do."

On October 4, 1859 Hallowell was appointed as the first president of the Maryland Agricultural College.

Bānu and Pāpak are considered as one of the most heroic freedom fighters of Persia who initiated the Khurramite movement. It was a freedom fighting movement aimed to overthrow the Arab Caliphate and restore the Sassanians to the throne. After the occupation of Persia by the Arabs, Banu and Babak worked as revolutionary resistance fighters leading the Persian Resistance Militia. The famous female commando and revolutionary Banu, is to this day considered by most Iranians as a heroine. The central area of activity for Banu was Azerbaijan state of Persia. Banu was a temperamental woman and a very skilled archer, she grew up with her bow and arrows. According to some sources, Banu was Babak's partner in life and death, in war and peace. Between 816-837 A.D. occurred one of the most dramatic periods in the history of Iran which was set under Babak and Banu’s leadership. During these most crucial years, they struggled against the Caliphate and refused their Arabian/Islamic customs. Eventually, Banu, Babak and their warriors were forced to leave Babak Fort after 23 years of constant successful campaigns which killed over 500,000 invading Arabs. Babak's mighty army \"Red-Wearing Ones\" (alternatively Persian: سرخ ژامگان Surx-Zhāmagān) was never defeated. They were eventually betrayed by one of their own officers (Afshin) and were handed over to the Arab Abbasid Caliphate."

A star with the collegiate Minnesota Gophers, their team MVP in 1954, McNamara was drafted by the Cleveland Browns. Instead, he turned directly north and signed with the Winnipeg Blue Bombers. However, the promise he showed was unfulfilled, as his career was beset with injury. In 1955 he rushed for only 51 yards. 1956 is when he showed his true form, rushing for 1101 yards, catching 36 passes for another 512 yards, scoring 17 touchdowns, and intercepting two passes. He was chosen as an all-star. Injuries returned and in 1957 he rushed for 90 yards with one TD on an interception return. In 1958 he did manage 236 rushing yards and 248 receiving yards, on 18 catches, but he had become a liability to the Bombers with his no cut contract, and he wasn't in the line up for the last half of the season and did not play in their Grey Cup victory. The Bombers then waived him out of the league, but he still holds an amazing CFL record: he scored 6 touchdowns at the BC Lions on October 13, 1956. McNamara next played with the inaugural Denver Broncos of the new AFL. In two seasons as a receiver and cornerback he caught 7 passes for 143 yards and intercepted 7 passes. He later tried out with the Minnesota Vikings. In his later years, Bob McNamara was a tireless booster for Minnesota Gophers sports and an instrumental supporter for the school's TCF Bank Stadium, which opened in 2009 and brought outdoor football back to campus. He died while undergoing chemotherapy treatment for cancer, on July 20, 2014."

The Arts Fuse has published more than 1,700 articles from 60 expert writers and critics. The web magazine serves as a next generation platform for arts and culture consumers across New England and beyond.

The Arts Fuse’s writers currently include Harvey Blume (The New York Times, The Boston Globe, Wired, Agni), J. R. Carroll (WKCR, Crawdaddy!, WBUR Online Arts site), Debra Cash (The Boston Globe, WBUR), Franklin Einspruch (New Criterion, Weekly Dig, Big Red & Shiny), Steve Elman (The Boston Globe, The Boston Phoenix, WBUR), Helen Epstein (author of six books of literary non-fiction), and many more. In 2011, The Arts Fuse received a grant from Mass Humanities for its Judicial Review, an online, in-depth, and interactive discussion of the issues raised by the arts on The Arts Fuse. The Arts Fuse also won CBS Boston's Most Valuable Blogger Award in 2011.

  "text" : "Burke Harr (born October 13, 1971) is a politician from the U.S. state of Nebraska. Harr is a member of the Nebraska Legislature, in which he represents the 8th legislative district in Omaha, consisting of the midtown neighborhoods of Dundee and Benson and the neighborhoods that surround Creighton Preparatory School. Harr was born in Illinois. He grew up in Omaha, where he graduated from Creighton Preparatory School in 1990; he then attended the University of St. Thomas in Minneapolis-St. Paul, Minnesota. He subsequently studied law at the University of Notre Dame. He returned to Omaha for a clerkship with the Nebraska Court of Appeals, then worked as a Douglas County prosecutor, practiced real-estate law, and co-founded a business consulting firm. In 2010, incumbent legislator Tom White declined to run for re-election, instead running for the position of U.S. Representative. In the nonpartisan primary election, Harr won 41% of the vote; businessman John Comstock won 31%; and Richard Ream won 28%. As the top two vote-getters, Harr and Comstock moved on to the general election. Harr, a member of the Democratic Party, opposed proposed across-the-board spending cuts to balance the state budget; Comstock, a Republican described as a Tea Party supporter, favored reducing the government's budget and ultimately eliminating the state's income tax. In the general election, Harr defeated Comstock by a margin of 51%–49%. In 2014, Harr sought re-election to his legislative seat. He was challenged by Gwenn Aspen, a Republican property manager. Aspen was seeking office for the first time; she had been active in, and her husband Jeremy Aspen had been co-chair of, the Mayor Suttle Recall Committee, which in 2010–11 had made an unsuccessful attempt to recall mayor Jim Suttle. In April, an Aspen mailing accused Harr of ignoring problems with Nebraska's \"good time\" law, which allowed convicts to win early release from prison; in 2013, one such convict, Nikko Jenkins, had committed four murders in Omaha. In the May primary, Aspen obtained 2183 votes to Harr's 2076. Both candidates moved on to the general election, in which a proposal to raise Nebraska's minimum wage was also on the ballot. Harr supported the increase; Aspen opposed it. In the general election, Harr prevailed, with 4834 votes to Aspen's 3916. Harr was elected as the Vice Chairperson of the Business and Labor Committee in 2013. He also serves on the Agriculture and Revenue Committees. Harr is a member of The Tax Modernization Committee, which has been tasked with conducting a comprehensive examination of Nebraska's tax system."

  "text" : "Bethuel Boyd Vincent (August 4, 1803 – July 21, 1876) was a prominent businessman and politician in Erie County, Pennsylvania. He was the son of Judge John Vincent. B. B. Vincent was elected the first clerk and treasurer of the recently established Waterford, Pennsylvania in March 1834 and served as the last Burgess of Erie, Pennsylvania in 1850, after which the city was incorporated and run by a mayor. He was one of the organizers of the Erie County Mutual Fire Insurance Company, which was established in Erie on March 26, 1839. He was a co-owner with William and David Himrod of Vincent, Himrod and Company, which operated an iron works on Mill Creek in Erie in 1840. The works later became the prominent Erie City Iron Works. He was one of several managers of the Erie Canal Company when that entity was charged during the 1842–43 session of the Pennsylvania State Assembly to tend to certain affairs of the Erie Canal. (See Erie Canal#Enlargements and improvements) He was among those selected by the city council in early 1846 to plant trees in the town square, which was called The Diamond at the time. An official ceremony was held in June 1846 to celebrate the plantings and to rename the park Perry Square. He was among the first subscribers to the establishment of Erie Cemetery in October 1846. He was President of the Marine National Bank from its establishment in Erie on March 9, 1865 until January 1867. His son, Strong Vincent (June 17, 1837 – July 7, 1863), was a lawyer who was mortally wounded at Little Round Top during the American Civil War Battle of Gettysburg. The boy's maternal grandfather, Captain Martin Strong (1770 - May 1823), was a pioneer, territorial surveyor, and prosperous land owner."

Tamimi's lawyers denied those charges saying “He believes in passive resistance and says he never asked anyone to throw stones”. al-Tamimi organizes weekly demonstrations against Israeli settlement. He has been arrested by the Israeli authorities over a dozen times, at one point spending more than three years in administrative detention without trial. Al-Tamimi advocates grassroots, nonviolent resistance, but has stated his belief that stone-throwing is an important symbol of Palestinian resistance to Israeli occupation. His 2011 arrest drew international attention, with the European Union describing him as a \"human rights defender\" and Amnesty International designating him a prisoner of conscience. He was arrested again in October 2012 for a demonstration in a supermarket, but released in early 2013."

  "text" : "Becky Sandstedt is an American filmmaker and animal rights activist. She investigated the conditions of downed animals on commercial farms and was the first person to bring their plight to the public's attention. Becky Sandstedt's investigation began after seeing a pamphlet about the treatment of \"downers\" at livestock markets − animals for sale who were too sick or injured to stand, and who might be left for days with no water, food or treatment. The material prompted her to visit a livestock market belonging to United Stockyards Corporation in South St. Paul, Minnesota. She worked at night as a cocktail waitress and visited the stockyard every day from October 1989 until May 1991, using a video camera she bought on credit for $75 a month. She requested a meeting with management in 1989 and again in June 1990 through the local humane society, and was told the problem was being dealt with. In May 1991, she released 44 hours of footage to local and national television stations that showed downed animals lying in pens for days without food or water, cows being dragged by heavy chains attached to a hind leg, pigs kept without food or water in temperatures of -22 °F (-30 °C), and one cow, still alive, frozen to the ground. The footage was reduced to 18 minutes by Farm Sanctuary, and published as \"The Down Side of Livestock Marketing\"; however, Becky Sandstedt never received credit for her footage or documentation from the organization, which still uses the film to solicit donations. Becky Sandstedt's powerful documentation and extensive, dedicated investigation received broad coverage in the media, including on NBC's Nightly News and Tom Brokaw's television program \"Expose.\" United Stockyards responded, just before NBC's segment regarding Becky Sandstedt's independent investigation aired on May 19, by announcing a \"no downer\" policy at South St. Paul and the six other livestock markets the company owned; farmers would no longer be paid for downed animals, but instead the animals would be euthanized and the farmer charged a rendering fee. The company said Becky Sandstedt had not influenced their decision, but had only determined the timing of their announcement. In 1991, she received the Animal Humanitarian of the Year award from the Animal Protection Institute. Becky Sandstedt was also The Guest of Honor at Hollywood's Genesis Awards. Farm Sanctuary continues to benefit from Becky Sandstedt's investigation and continues to use Becky's video footage and photographs as a propaganda tool to receive donations and take credit for her work."

  "text" : "Bernard Judge is an American journalist who has served in management positions at the City News Bureau of Chicago, the Chicago Tribune, the Chicago Sun-Times and the Chicago Daily Law Bulletin. He is a lifelong Chicagoan, married to Kimbeth Wehrli Judge and father to three grown children, Kelly, Bernard, and Jessica, and five grandchildren, Daniel Goldberg, Isabella Goldberg, Henry Schott, Ava Schott, and Declan Judge. After he got out of the Army in 1964 Mr. Judge worked briefly at the old U.S. Steel South Works site before entering the newspaper business. He eventually built a national reputation. When the actor Edward Asner was playing city editor Lou Grant, he sought Judge's advice about the nuances of running a newsroom. Mr. Judge began his career as a reporter for City News Bureau of Chicago in 1965. He moved to the Chicago Tribune to cover state and federal courts and government. During his tenure, two investigative reporting projects he directed won the Pulitzer Prize. (He later served as a juror for the 2000 Pulitzer Prize awards.) Mr. Judge returned to the City News Bureau of Chicago in 1983 as the Editor and General Manager. He then joined the Chicago Sun-Times as the metropolitan editor and associate editor. He directed series and projects that won more than 20 state and national awards, including the series by Charles Nicodemus that killed the plan to establish a new central library and set the stage for the Harold Washington Library Mr. Judge left the Chicago Sun-Times to become the editor and vice president of the Chicago Daily Law Bulletin. He became the Law Bulletin's publisher in 2001. At the newspaper's 150th anniversary celebration in 2004, Chief Judge Joel M. Flaum of the 7th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals said \"The paper has bound many generations of lawyers together. It is extremely well led by Bernard Judge, who has been a beacon of excellence wherever he's been. And never has that beacon shone more brightly than at the Law Bulletin.\" Upon Judge's retirement in 2007, former Illinois Supreme Court Chief Justice Thomas R. Fitzgerald stated \"He has endeared himself to hundreds, if not thousands, of lawyers because of his integrity. He understood it wasn't only getting the story, it was getting it right.\" Since retiring, Mr. Judge has been a non-lawyer Hearing Board Officer for the Illinois Attorney Registration and Disciplinary Commission (ARDC), serving as a trial judge in lawyer disciplinary cases. In April, 2012, the Illinois Supreme Court appointed him to serve as a Commissioner of the ARDC. Mr Judge also served on the Illinois State Admissions Review Committee responsible for reviewing claims that some applicants to the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign received special treatment. The blue ribbon panel's response to the University of Illinois clout scandal included recommendations of reforms to improve the fairness and transparency of the admissions process. He has also become a first-time author in retirement. Along with Neal Samors, Mr. Judge co-authored Chicago's Lake Shore Drive: Urban America's Most Beautiful Roadway"

He was nephew to the pastor Just Kruse (1886–1962), and cousin to Colonel Erling O. Kruse (b. 1922) and physiotherapists Astrid E. Kruse Andersen (b. 1926). Tvedt grew up in Bergen, Norway, and after the completion of examen artium in 1930, he went to Germany and was trained as a physiotherapist. He then studied medicine at the University of Oslo, and was MD in 1942. After the fire in University Hall in November 1943, he fled to Sweden and came to Uppsala. There he worked for a period as a doctor for Norwegian refugees and he got to work for a sports and work physiologist, Professor Torgny Sjöstrand. After the Second World War, sports and work physiology was his main interest. He was a doctor for the Norwegian athletes at several world championships and Olympic Games. As a sports physician, his caught interest in strain disorders, and put a lot of effort into such problems. In 1946 he was connected to the Oslo Orthopedic Institute as a teacher and was later education leader until the state took over the institute in 1966 and called it the Norwegian School of Physiotherapy. He ran the department together with Dr. Otto Holmboe until Holmboe's death. Then he was responsible for the main teaching of Norwegian physiotherapists. As a teacher Tvedt was a pioneer who used very unorthodox methods of teaching. It meant that he was controversial, but his strong point was never drawn into question. As a physiotherapist, his mantra was motion. Under the leadership of Tvedt, people in various professions was filmed, then the employees together with Tvedt studied the video to learn how to see how they could improve their working position. When Erling Stordahl started his health sports center at Beitostølen, Tvedt was in place as an active consultant. The Director of Health Karl Evang was of the opinion that Tvedt with his ideas about physical activity was 20 to 30 years ahead of its time.Tvedt was for years associated with the Police Academy and was an active promoter of Norwegian police officers' physical education. He was also special medic for many years at the Oslo Police District's occupational health."

  "text" : "Beatrice Blyth Whiting (14 April 1914, New York City – 29 September 2003, Cambridge, Massachusetts), was an American anthropologist specializing in the comparative study of child development. Together with her husband John Whiting, she was a key figure in the Harvard Department of Social Relations and a pioneer in the cross-cultural study of childhood and child development. Born on Staten Island in 1914, she received her B.A. from Bryn Mawr College in 1935. She then studied anthropology at Yale. In 1943, she became one of the first women to receive a PhD from that department for her fieldwork among the Paiute Indians of Oregon. Her dissertation advisor was anthropologist George Murdock. Beatrice Whiting did much of her work in collaboration with her husband John Whiting, also an anthropologist at Harvard. Often they did fieldwork together, with Beatrice focusing on the experience of women and girls and John focusing on the experience of men and boys. Beatrice Whiting joined the Harvard faculty in 1952. In 1954, she and her husband began the Six Cultures Study of Socialization, a project that involved field studies in Mexico, India, Kenya, Okinawa, the Philippines and the United States. The project continues to be regarded as one of the most ambitious comparative studies of child development and family life. In 1966, the Whitings founded the Child Development Research Unit at the University of Nairobi to conduct more intensive studies in Kenya. She became one of the first women to receive tenure at Harvard University when she was named professor at the graduate school of education in 1974. In the 1980s, after their retirement from Harvard, the Whitings turned their attention to older children, directing the Comparative Adolescence Project. He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1981."

Since then he has gone on to appear in several TV dramas.In 2012 he played the part of a wounded soldier in the dramatisation of the story of Dr. Ludwig Guttmann written by Lucy Gannon.

  "text" : "Benvenuto Campesani (c. 1250 – 1323) was a Vicentine poet and notary. He composed in particular a short poem in elegiac couplets \"on the resurrection of Catullus, Veronese poet\"; that is, on some event related to a manuscript of Catullus. The poem is apparently written as a sort of a riddle, and its precise meaning is unclear. It tells of some compatriot of Catullus, probably named Franciscus (Francesco), who presumably either found the manuscript, or brought it to Verona from some other place, or made a new copy of it. Campesani was a supporter of Cangrande della Scala, whose Christian name also happens to be Francesco."

  "text" : "Brian David Valentine Lindsay (born 22 January 1937) is an Australian politician. He was a Liberal Party of Australia member of the Legislative Assembly of Queensland from 1974 until 1977, representing the electorate of Everton. Lindsay was born in Ashgrove, the grandson of Labor Senator John MacDonald, and was educated at St Finbar's Convent and Marist Brothers College. He attended the Royal Military College, Duntroon from 1955 to 1958, then entered the military, serving with the Pacific Islands Regiment from 1959 to 1963 and with the regular army in Papua New Guinea, Malaya, Borneo, and in the Vietnam War. He was mentioned in despatches for distinguished active service in South Vietnam in 1968–1969, but was discharged with the rank of major as a result of injuries suffered in Vietnam. Lindsay subsequently studied to become a teacher, variously attending Melbourne Teacher's College, Kelvin Grove Teachers College and the University of Queensland. He taught at Marist Brothers College from 1973 until his election to parliament the following year. Lindsay was elected to the Legislative Assembly at the 1974 state election, winning the usually safe Labor seat of Everton amidst the Liberal-National landslide victory that year. He differed from Premier Joh Bjelke-Petersen on the issue of death duties, favouring their removal more slowly than that sought by Bjelke-Petersen, and later antagonised gay and lesbian activists by, in response to debate about whether gay teachers should be allowed in Queensland, requesting assurance from the Education Minister that 'young men and women with such unfortunate and unnatural personal lifestyles are never admitted to the profession'. He was defeated by Labor candidate Glen Milliner at the 1977 election. Lindsay is married with one son and one daughter."

  "text" : "Benjamin Dass (15 August 1706 – 5 May 1775) was a Norwegian educator and scholar who served as Rector of Trondheim Cathedral School. Dass was born at Skar farm (Skar i Alstahaug) in Herøy, Nordland, Norway. He was the son of Jacob Benjaminsson Dass and Maria Volquartz. His father was a nephew of poet-priest Petter Dass (1647-1707). His mother was a sister of Marcus Carstensen Volqvartz (1678–1720) who was a priest in Trondheim. In 1719, Thomas von Westen (1682–1727), who had founded the Seminarium Lapponicum in Trondheim, took an interest in him and had him enrolled at the Trondheim Cathedral School. In 1726, he entered the University of Copenhagen. Towards the end of his nine year stay in Copenhagen, he was admitted to Borchs Kollegium where he came in contact with Hans Gram  (1685–1748) who was manager of the Danish Royal Library and the secretary of the Royal Archives. In 1734, he was contacted by the Bishop of Trondheim and offered the headmaster position at the Trondheim Cathedral School. In 1735, he took his magister degree with honor and moved to Trondheim. Several of his school reforms were implemented in the 1739 Educational Act (Folkeskoleloven) of King Christian VI of Denmark who had visited Trondheim in 1733. Among other provisions, the law designated compulsory school attendance for children. Dass retired in 1750 and was succeeded as rector by his former student, Gerhard Schøning. In 1753 moved to Copenhagen. From 1757 he began to develop health problems and in 1775 he died in Copenhagen. After his death, parts of his large book collection were donated to the Gunnerus Library (Gunnerusbiblioteket) at the University of Trondheim."
