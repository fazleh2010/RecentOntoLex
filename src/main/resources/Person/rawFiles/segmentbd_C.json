  "text" : "Consort Zhang, imperial consort rank  Defei  (張德妃) (892-November 4, 915) was the wife of Zhu Zhen (Zhu Youzhen), the last emperor of the Chinese Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period state Later Liang. The future Consort Zhang was a daughter of Zhang Guiba (張歸霸), a general under Later Liang's founding emperor (and the father of Zhu Zhen, who was then known as Zhu Youzhen) Emperor Taizu. While Zhu Youzhen was the Prince of Jun under Emperor Taizu, he married Lady Zhang as his wife and princess. After he became emperor in 913, he wanted to create Princess Zhang empress, but Princess Zhang, citing the fact that he had not formally offered sacrifices to heaven and earth as an emperor, declined. In 915, Princess Zhang became seriously ill. Zhu Youzhen, who had changed his name to Zhu Zhen by that point, created her the imperial consort rank of Defei. She died the same night as the creation. After her death, her brothers Zhang Handing (張漢鼎) and Zhang Hanjie (張漢傑), as well as her cousins Zhang Hanlun (張漢倫) and Zhang Hanrong (張漢融), became close associates of his, and they, along with his brother-in-law Zhao Yan, were traditionally blamed for corruption and offering him bad advice that led to the decline and fall of the Later Liang state."

  "text" : "Darrell Bailey, better known as Clipper Darrell, is a superfan of the Los Angeles Clippers of the National Basketball Association. A season ticket holder since the 2000–01 season, he dances, leads cheers, and taunts the opposing team at home games in a half red, half blue suit—the Clippers' team colors. One of his usual chants is \"Let's go Clippers!\". A personal favorite of his is \"U-G-L-Y, you ain’t got no alibi, you ugly!\", which he directs at opposing players when they shoot free throws. Azcentral.com in 2013 called him \"one of the NBA’s last quality clean hecklers\". Bailey drives a customized 1995 BMW 740i, whose exterior and interior are each red, white, and blue. The hood features a Clippers logo and autographs, and the license plates are customized with CLIPERD. His home in Los Angeles is painted in the team's colors with a red, white and blue basketball court in the driveway and a Clippers logo on the pavement. The front door is red, and the living room is white and blue with Clippers logos prominent from the walls to the floor tiles. In 1984, Bailey was fired from his job as an electrician and told he would \"never amount to anything\". After hearing an announcer say the same about the Clippers, he decided to support the team. He was originally known as Dancing Man before changing to Clipper Darrell after a few radio appearances. He attended 386 consecutive games until the streak was broken by a trip to the hospital for high blood pressure. The New York Times called him \"the team’s unofficial biggest fan\". The Wall Street Journal wrote, \"He’s perhaps the only superfan in the history of the Los Angeles Clippers.\" He is not an employee of the Clippers organization. In February 2012, there was a dispute with the team over the use of Clipper in his name. The Clippers accused him of capitalizing on the Clipper name, but later reached a mutual agreement that Bailey would notify the Clippers when appearing publicly as Clipper Darrell. In 2014, former Clippers co-owner Shelly Sterling received the title of \"Clippers Number One Fan” as part of the sales agreement with incoming owner Steve Ballmer. Yahoo! Sports, however, opined that Clipper Darrell was \"the Clippers No. 1 fan, no matter what official documents say.\" Bailey has a wife and four children."

Griffin got his start in politics volunteering for the Bill Clinton presidential campaign, which led to a position in the White House Press Office at the age of 19. Following his stint in the White House and his graduation from Georgetown University, he led a number of political campaigns advocating for or against various California ballot initiatives, as well as a number of fundraising efforts for political candidates, such as Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama. Following the 2008 passage of California's highly publicized Proposition 8, which barred the recognition of same-sex marriage, Griffin founded the American Foundation for Equal Rights (AFER) to overturn the law. AFER's challenge, Perry v. Brown was ultimately successful following a decision by the United States Supreme Court in June 2013. In 2012, Griffin was appointed president of the Human Rights Campaign, the largest LGBT rights organization in the United States."

She owns Midelfart Capital and is chairwoman of Midelfart Holding. She is a daughter of the businessman Finn-Erik Midelfart (1943–95) and Hermine Kristin née Muhle (born 1944), and a step-daughter of the real estate investor Nikolai Paus. She belongs to the prominent Midelfart family, whose name is derived from Middelfart in Denmark. The name consists of the old Danish word mæthal meaning \"middle\" and far meaning \"way\" (i.e. \"middle way\"). It therefore probably originated as designating the narrow passage between Funen and Jutland, only later being applied to the settlement. She is married to business magnate Tor Olav Trøim, widely described as the long-time right-hand man of shipping magnate John Fredriksen."

  "text" : "Cornelius Frederiks (died 16 February 1907) was a leader of the ǃAman (Bethanie Orlam), a subtribe of the Orlam people, in the southern area of German South-West Africa, today's Namibia. He was a rival Kaptein of the Bethanie Orlam, contesting the chieftaincy of Paul Frederiks. Among the Orlam people living in Bethanie, Cornelius had more followers but Paul was the official leader who also had the support of the German colonial powers. When the Herero and Namaqua War of 1904-1907 broke out, Frederiks was one of the indigenous leaders that actively fought a guerrilla-style war against the Germans. He often sided with Hendrik Witbooi, leader of the ǀKhowesin (Witbooi Orlam), and both were wanted for a 3,000ℛℳ ransom. The German Schutztruppe kept the upper hand in the majority of battles and forced most Nama and Orlam groups to surrender. The group under Frederiks gave up on 3 March 1906. On 9 September 1906 Cornelius Frederiks was imprisoned at Shark Island concentration camp in Lüderitz as part of a group of 1,795 Nama people. Most of them died in the icy wind due to malnutrition and neglect, their bodies were buried at low tide and soon washed into the ocean. Frederiks died on 16 February 1907. He was decapitated and his head was sent to Germany for research on racial superiority. Eugen Fischer's study on \"racial anatomy of 17 Hottentot heads\" appeared in 1922."

  "text" : "Charles Overton Handley, Jr. (July 14, 1924 - June 9, 2000) was a zoologist and explorer who conducted various expeditions for the United States government. Born in Longview, Texas, Hanley's father was a professor of wildlife management and an avid bird-watcher. In the summer after his high school graduation, Handley participated in an expedition to collect mammals in the Southern Appalachian mountains, with the Museum of Zoology of the University of Michigan. He thereafter resolved to study mammals. Handley received a B.A. from Virginia Tech in 1944, and served in World War II as a rifleman in the 120th Infantry, seeing action in Europe. After the war, the secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, Alexander Wetmore, hired Handley to collect birds and mammals on a naval icebreaker expedition to the Arctic. Handley received an M.A. from the University of Michigan in 1947, and a Ph.D. in mammalogy from that institution in 1955, in the interim participating in expeditions to the High Arctic, Labrador, Guatemala, and the Kalahari Desert. Having described many new taxa lemmings and Arctic hares, Handley became a curator of mammals at the Smithsonian. He later conducted extensive surveys of the mammals of Panama and Venezuela, with a particular interest in bats, which he continued to study late in his life. Handley died in Springfield, Virginia."

  "text" : "Carin Mannheimer (born Karin Birgitta Jacobson; 17 August 1934 – 11 July 2014) was a Swedish dramatist, screenwriter, author and film director, born in Osby, Sweden. She garnered acclaim with Rapport om kvinnor [Report on Women], which was published in 1969. The book is a collection of interviews with Swedish women from the working class. This was during a time period of awakening feminism in Sweden when women were assumed to want to work outside the home. The interviews, however, revealed that many women did not want to work outside the home, would have preferred to care for their children but had no economic choice. For this reason, Mannheimer was criticized by the women's movement in Sweden, and the book established her reputation as a social critic."

  "text" : "Constant Mayer (October 3, 1829 – May 12, 1911) was a French painter who emigrated to the United States. Mayer was born in Besançon, France. The family was Jewish. He studied in Paris in the École des Beaux-Arts and under Léon Cogniet, and followed his profession in that city until 1854, when he moved to New York City. Mayer worked as a colorist at the photography studio of Jeremiah Gurney and CD Fredericks, at 340 Broadway, in Manhattan. With his own studio, at 1155 Broadway, he became known for his genre or historical paintings based on literature, and particularly for his portraits. He also created many sketches and drawings. His sentimental Civil War-themed painting, \"Recognition\" of 1865, drew considerable attention over the years. In 1869, Mayer was made a chevalier of the Legion of Honor. He had been elected an associate of the National Academy of Design in 1866, and was also a member of the American Art Union. Mayer left the U.S. in 1969 for Paris, where he died in 1911. In his will he left much of his assets to Jewish causes - in particular Jewish orphanages. Several of Mayer's works appear in the collections of world-renowned museums, such as the Metropolitan Museum of Art."

Smith played on the Asian Tour in 2014, finishing in the top-10 seven times and finishing 5th on the Order of Merit. His best finish was tied for second at the CIMB Niaga Indonesian Masters. Smith has been coached and mentored since 2004 by Golf Queensland coach Grant Field. Smith's first PGA Tour event was the CIMB Classic in October 2014, which was a joint event with the Asian Tour; he tied for 5th. In April 2015, he tied for 15th in the RBC Heritage, playing on a sponsor's exemption. After qualifying for the 2015 U.S. Open, his top-4 finish earned him an invitation to the 2016 Masters Tournament. The finish also earned Smith Special Temporary Membership on the PGA Tour for the remainder of the 2014–15 season. Smith earned his 2015–16 PGA Tour card by earning enough as a non-member to have been in the top 125 on the money list: his best three events would have been sufficient."

She graduated from Oxford in 1973 with a doctorate on Minoan civilization and Mycenaean beliefs in the afterlife. She was a lecturer at Liverpool (1976-78), and a senior research Fellow at University College, Oxford (1990-95). Also she worked as Reader in Classical Literature at the University of Reading (1995-98). According to the Reading's Classics Department, Sourvinou-Inwood's acknowledged supremacy in the area of Greek religion studies made a lasting contribution to the Department's research, and this field continues to be one of its strongholds in the twenty-first century."

She was a granddaughter of Frederik Holst, sister of Axel Holst and aunt of Peter Midelfart Holst. She finished her secondary education as a private candidate in 1889, and had attended Nissens School. The next year, in 1890, she became the first female philology student at the Royal Frederick University, Norway's only university at the time. She was the first woman to take the cand.philol. degree in Norway, in 1896, and the first to take a doctorate at a Norwegian university. Her adacemic advisor was Johan Storm, whose acquaintances enabled her to study at Cambridge in 1892, Sorbonne in 1893, Leipzig in 1897, Copenhagen in 1898–99 and Berlin in 1902–03. She finished the dr.philos. degree in 1903 with the thesis Studier over middelnedertyske laaneord i dansk i det 14. og 15. aarhundrede. She thereby followed in the footsteps of her grandfather, who in 1817 became the first person to take a doctorate in the independent Norway. Johan Storm was a doctoral opponent together with Hjalmar Falk and Sophus Bugge. Holst had short tenures as a German teacher at the Royal Frederick University and Aars og Voss school in 1904 and 1906. She lectured at Wellesley College from 1906 to 1907 and the University of Kansas in Lawrence from 1907 to 1908. Holst then retired and returned to lead a quiet life in Norway. She was unmarried, and resided in Fagerborg with her two older sisters Anna Amalie and Thea. She died in her hometown in November 1935."

  "text" : "Caroline Sophie Testman (1839 - 1919), was a Danish feminist. She was the co-founder of the Dansk Kvindesamfund or DK (Danish Women's Association) and its chairman 1872-1883. She was the daughter of postmaster and captain Peder Otto Testman (1806–90) and Henriette Marie Hohlenberg (1808–74). She had the wish to study, but was not given permission by her father. In the 1860s, however, she became active as a freelance journalist, and contributed with articles to various papers, something she continued to do most of her life. One of the papers she contributed to was Tidskrift för hemmet, the paper of the Swedish feminist Sophie Adlersparre. Caroline Testman was the co-founder of the first women's organisation in Denmark, Dansk Kvindesamfund or DK (Danish Women's Association) alongside Tagea Johansen, Elisabet Ouchterlony and Matilde Bajer. DK was founded in 1871 as a branch of the French Association Internationale des Femmes with Matilde Bajer as chairman and Caroline Testman as treasurer. Bajer soon left her position, and when her successor Severine Casse did the same in 1872, Testman became its chairman, a post she kept until 1883. During her tenure, she focused on access of education and professional work for women. She founded Handelsskolen for Kvinder (The Business School For Women) in 1872 to open the work market for women within the expanding work force in trade-, office and banking-professions: this school was eventually given government support and remained the primary institution of academic education for women in Denmark within this subjects until 1903, when this education was made available for women by the state. In 1874, she also founded Søndagsskolen for Kvinder (SK) for elementary education of workerclass women, which were staffed with voluntary academics: this was active until 1890, when this education was made available for women by the student union. In 1876, she founded Tegneskolen for Kvinder (The Drawing School For Women) alongside Charlotte Klein. Caroline Testman was a supporter of women suffrage, but during her tenure as chairman, the question had not yet been an issue. In 1884, she proposed to have the question accepted as one of the goals of the association, but without success. In 1887 she supported the reform suggestion of conditional women suffrage made by the politician Fredrik Bajer. She continued to be an active member within the DK until her death. In her will, she set up a fund for female students."

  "text" : "Charles Cogen (October 31, 1903 – February 18, 1998) was president of New York City's United Federation of Teachers (UFT) (1960–1964) and subsequently, the American Federation of Teachers (AFT) (1964–1968). During Cogen's tenure the teachers' union demonstrated a militancy that had not previously been apparent, and was at odds with the image of the teacher as quiet civil servant. That strikes were technically illegal under the state's Condon-Wadlin Act did not deter Cogen from leading citywide walkouts that resulted in significant economic and professional advances for those he represented. To those who argued that striking teachers set a poor example for students, Cogen responded that such teachers were models of courageous citizenship. Similarly, Cogen scoffed at efforts to characterize teacher walkouts as subverting the public interest: \"Who is to say what the public interest is?\" There had never been a teacher strike in New York City prior to 1960 (although Cogen threatened one in 1959 when he was leader of the Teachers' Guild) During the four years that Cogen was president of the UFT, teachers struck twice and came within 24 hours of a third. Each such crisis involved confrontations with New York City's superintendent of schools and the city's mayor. Occasionally, the state's commissioner of education and governor were also involved. These were people with national profiles, and consequently, Cogen also became a national figure. This proved to be of substantial assistance to him when he ran for the presidency of the AFT."

  "text" : "Conrad Will (July 29, 1941 – September 11, 2002) was one of the early pioneers in the sport of Triathlon. A member of the famed “San Diego Track Club” and “Horny Toads” running group in San Diego, California, he competed in some of the earliest triathlons in the late 1970s. In 1981 he participated in the Ironman Triathlon in its first year on the Big Island of Hawaii. He competed in Ironman Hawaii 6 times in his 40s and 50s. In 1984 he set a world record in the 40-49 age group at the Ultra Distance triathlon in Massachusetts. A few days later, he won the over 40 national title in the Long Course Triathlon in Colorado. Outside of competition he was an even greater contributor to the sport of triathlon. He worked closely with Valerie Silk and the Ironman Triathlon to bring the sport to a larger audience and in 1983 he produced and directed the first ever Ironman “spin-off”, the Ricoh Ironman in Los Angeles. That same year he went on to create and co-found the annual three-day Ultraman (endurance challenge), also in Hawaii, which more than doubled the distances of the Ironman. In 1984 he was elected board president of the national governing body for the sport USA Triathlon, then called Tri-Fed. In his efforts to race faster, Mr. Will also invented and manufactured the QWIKFIL tire inflation device, which greatly reduced the time needed to repair a flat tire."

  "text" : "Carlo Lodi (11 February 1701- 22 April 1765) is an Italian painter of the late-Baroque period in Bologna, mainly painting landscapes. He was born and initially trained with Angelo Michele Cavazzoni. Another pupil was Bernardo Minozzi. He then went to work for some months under the landscape artist, Nunzio Ferraiuoli. He married in 1730, but had no children. In 1735, he collaborated in the decoration of the Palazzo Malvezzi Campeggi (now Law College Faculty Building) in Bologna with Antonio Rossi, who painted figures in landscape. The paintings depict the feats of the Malvezzi family. In the 1740s, he worked again with Rossi on the decoration of the Palazzo Pepoli/Villa Cicogna in San Lazzaro di Savena, with scenes depicting the Story of Moses, Story of Telemachus, Landscapes, and Events during Spanish Invasions. In 1753 he helped decorate the refectory of the Convent of San Giacomo in Bologna and Villa San Giovanni Comelli, near Bologna. Also, in the same year, Rossi's death ended their successful collaboration. In the future he collaborated with Nicola Bertucci, including for the Villa Ranuzzi-Cospi in Bagnarola, a frazione of Budrio, near Bologna. His landscape paintings obtain buyers in Rome, including Cardinal Luigi Valenti Gonzaga. He was very active in fresco decoration, including in the Magani House, and in Casa Lambertini, Casa Guidalotti, Casa Scarani, Casa Bentivogli, Casa Graffi, Casa Varnini, Casa Tondelli, and Casa Boschi. He became a member of the Bolognese Accademia Clementina in 1747. He died in Bologna. One of Lodi's pupils was Vincenzo Martinelli."

  "text" : "Camille du Gast (Marie Marthe Camille Desinge du Gast, Camille Crespin du Gast, 30 May 1868 – 24 April 1942) was one of a trio of pioneering French female celebrities of the Belle Epoque, together with Hélène de Rothschild (Baroness Hélène van Zuylen) and Anne de Rochechouart de Mortemart the (Duchess of Uzès). du Gast was known as \"one of the richest and most accomplished widows in France,\" and as an accomplished sportswoman—a balloonist, parachute jumper, fencer, tobogganist, skier, rifle and pistol shot, horse trainer—as well as a concert pianist and singer. She was the second woman to compete in an international motor race. In France she later became renowned for her extensive charity work. She was president of the 'Société protectrice des animaux' (SPA, 'French Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals') until her death, and her campaign against bullfighting included disruptive direct action protests. She provided health-care to disadvantaged women and children in Paris, and continued whilst under German occupation in World War II. Her quixotic character, pugnacity, ambition and daring plus her feminist pioneering meant that she was both admired and detested in equal measure. Her social drive, connections and independent financial status attracted jealousy, misogynist outbursts and gossip. She was the central figure in the Parisian scandal of La Femme au Masque where she was maliciously but mistakenly named as the nude model in a notorious painting by Henri Gervex. This salacious story involved three court cases, and was reported around the world. Her exuberant social and sporting lifestyle was changed by a traumatic experience around 1910, when her daughter attempted to have her murdered in order to inherit. In the middle of the night, in her own house, she challenged the gang and they fled. Afterwards she devoted herself to French Government work in Morocco, and charitable works with animals, disadvantaged women and orphans. A pioneer feminist, she served as vice-president of the Ligue Française du Droit des Femmes (The French League for the Rights of Women) after World War I. In 1904 she became the only woman official of the Automobile Club de France (A.C.F.). She was known in the press by the soubriquets l'Amazone and la Walkyrie de la Mécanique (Valkyrie of the motor car)."

  "text" : "Charles P. Pray (born August 15, 1945) is an American politician from Maine. Pray was born in the paper mill town of Millinocket, Maine on August 15, 1945. He grew up in northern Piscataquis County, Maine attending a one-room schoolhouse from 1954-1959. He attended Maine Central Institute, graduating from Stearns High School in his birthplace of Millinocket in 1964. He then attended Ricker College in Houlton. In 1966, he enlisted with the US Air Force and served in Southeast Asia during the Vietnam War. Finishing with the Air Force in 1970, he returned to Maine and enrolled at the University of Maine, from which he graduated in 1973 with a B.A. in political science. In 1974, he was elected to the Maine Senate to represent Piscataquis County and the northern area of Penobscot County, which was the largest legislative district east of the Mississippi River. From 1978-1982, Pray served as Assistant Majority Leader of the Maine Senate. From 1982-1984, Pray served as Majority Leader. In 1984, Pray was elected by his peers as President of the Maine Senate, a position he held until a surprise defeat in 1992. He is one of two individuals to serve four terms but is the only Senate President in Maine history to hold the office for 8 full years. During the 1992 election, Pray was defeated by Stephen Hall of Guilford, which the Bangor Daily News called a \"stunning defeat\". Following the end of his term in the Maine Senate, Pray held several positions at both the federal and state level. In the Bill Clinton administration, he served as Special Assistant/Senior Advisor to the Assistant Secretary for Congressional & Intergovernmental Affairs at the United States Department of Energy in a Senior Executive Administration Service position in Washington, D.C. In 2003, Governor John Baldacci appointed Pray to the position of State Nuclear Safety Advisor following work he was involved with while at the Department of Energy. Pray served as Director of Congressional Affairs for the National Nuclear Security Administration in 2010 in the Obama Administration. In 2011, Pray jumped into the debate on the proposed creation of a national park on land owned by Roxanne Quimby which was part of the Senate district Pray represented. He called for a comprehensive study of the effects of that a national park might have on not only tourism, but the entire economy of the region. In late 2012 and early 2013 Pray served as Town Manager for his home town of Millinocket, Maine. In July 2013 he was nominated by the Penobscot County Commissioners to serve a four-year term on the Maine Land Use Planning Commission, the State's planning commission for communities without a planning board and the vast unorganized territories of Maine. Pray remains active advising and outline strategies for elected and potential political candidates."

He was the eldest son of Prince Charles of Nassau-Usingen and his wife, Christina Wilhelmina, the daughter of Duke John William III of Saxe-Eisenach. In 1770, Charles William became Lieutenant-General in the Dutch army. In 1789, he was promoted to general and in 1790 to colonel of the Walloon regiment and captain of the grenadiers. In 1775, he succeeded his father as Prince of Nassau-Usingen. In 1783, he concluded a treaty of inheritance with the princes of Nassau-Saarbrücken, Nassau-Weilburg and Nassau-Dietz (i.e., Orange-Nassau), in which it was agreed that the Nassau lands were inidivisible and that mutual succession among the various branches based on primogeniture would be observed. In 1797, Prince Henry Louis of Nassau-Saarbrücken died childless and Charles William inherited his principality. However, under the Treaty of Lunéville, the territories on the left bank of the Rhine were lost to France. The Reichsdeputationshauptschluss of 1803 compensated Charles William with territories taken from the Electorate of Mainz, the Electorate of Cologne, Electorate of the Palatinate and Hesse. Charles William died later that year. Since he had no male heir, he was succeeded by his younger brother Frederick Augustus."

  "text" : "Charles Beadle (October 27, 1881-unknown) was a novelist and pulp fiction writer, best known for his adventure stories in American pulp magazines, and for his novels of the bohemian life in Paris. He was born at sea. His father, Henry Beadle, was a ship captain, and traveled with his wife Isabelle. Charles grew up in Hackney, in greater London, attending boarding schools. He left home as a teenager and traveled. He served in the British South Africa Police in Southern Rhodesia, doing duty in the Boer War. After the war he traveled up East Africa. He was in Morocco from 1908–12, and began his writing career. His first known published work was an article, \"A Talk with the New Sultan of Morocco\" in The Pall Mall Magazine (October 1908). His first known published fiction was the novel The City of Shadows: A Romance of Morocco (1911). He sailed to New York City, arriving on November 14, 1916. He established himself as a pulp adventure writer, publishing authentic stories of Africa for Adventure, Argosy, Short Stories, The Frontier, etc. He also wrote sea stories. His most successful work was probably Witch-Doctors, a four-part serial in Adventure (issues of March 15 to May 1, 1919). It was published as a book in 1922, both in the U.S. and London. By 1920, he was living in Paris, which appears to have been his residence for the rest of his life. He published at least one book, The Esquimau of Montparnasse, on the bohemian scene in Paris. He is presumed to have died in France, although his date of death is currently unknown. His last known published work was \"Nameless Spy,\" a ten-page story in Short Stories (June 10, 1947)."

Her paternal grandfather was Henry the Lion. She and her husband are known as patrons of the monasteries in Maulbronn, Tennenbach, Herrenalb, Selz, Salem and Backnang Abbey. In 1245, Irmengard founded Lichtenthal Abbey in Lichtental (now part of Baden-Baden, where later the Margraves of Baden would be buried. However, the construction of this abbey exceeded her financial resources and she had to request assistance from her sons. In March 1245, she was given several manors and rights. The brothers Herman and Rudolf, gave their mother Irmengard, who had begun the construction of a Cistercian monastery at Beuren, near Baden, for the salvation of her late husband, the Margrave of Baden, and for the reduction of her sins, but had insufficient means, the Jus patronatus of the churches in Ettlingen and Baden, the tithes in Iffezheim (deciman, que nobis cedit aqud Vffinshein), the villages of Winden and Beuren with all lands belonging thereto, two manors in Oos and one in Eberstein, and twelve pounds of coins from Strasbourg from their interest in Selz— General State Archive in Karlsruhe In this case, the brothers gave away more than they owned, because they had earlier enfeoffed Louis of Liebenzell with two parts of the tithes.

He was appointed Assistant Minister for Health on 3 April 2012, but was expelled from the ministry for breaches of cabinet solidarity. Before entering parliament Dr Davis worked as the director of geriatric medicine at The Prince Charles Hospital. He has served as president of the Queensland branch of the Australian Medical Association and was the state chair of the Royal Australasian College of Physicians. On 13 May 2014, Davis was sacked from Cabinet in response to his speaking against the government on a number of matters. Premier Campbell Newman said Davis had failed to observe the convention that cabinet members and assistant ministers are bound by collective decision making. Although Davis initially stated that he intended to retire at the next state election, he resigned from the Parliament on 23 May 2014. A 2014 Stafford by-election was held on Saturday 19 July 2014. On 25 July 2014, in an interview on the ABC's 7.30 Queensland, Davis stated that he had resigned from the Liberal National Party and had spoken to Australian Labor Party state secretary Anthony Chisholm about the potential for continuing his political career with Labor, potentially running in Newman's seat of Ashgrove. The following day, Leader of the Opposition Annastacia Palaszczuk stated that Davis was not a member of the Labor Party and would not be running as a Labor candidate. On the same day, Davis submitted his application to join the Labor Party, and also stated that he was interested in federal politics if he was unsuccessful in obtaining a state seat."

He was president of the local chapter of the Saskatchewan Grain Growers' Association and of the Saskatchewan Association of Regional Municipalities. Hamilton was for a short time a director for the Canadian National Railway. He was first elected to the provincial assembly in a 1919 by-election held after Robert Menzies Mitchell resigned his seat. Hamilton served in the provincial cabinet as Minister of Agriculture, Minister of Municipal Affairs, Minister of Highways and Minister of the Child Welfare Act. He was defeated by Robert Sterritt Leslie when he ran for reelection to the assembly in 1929. He then served on the Board of Grain Commissioners for 19 years, retiring in January 1948.

He chaired the conference which saw the union merge with others to form the Confederation of Health Service Employees, and was also elected as president of the new union. In 1948, Bartlett was elected to the General Council of the Trades Union Congress, and in 1960, he became President of the Trades Union Congress, the first holder of that post in many years to remain in non-trade union employment. He was awarded the CBE in 1960, and retired in 1962. Following his retirement, Bartlett lived in Ivybridge in Devon, where he served as a parish councillor."

A building was secured in 1923 and was purchased by the City of Tampa in 1928. At the time, the Tampa Municipal Hospital, now Tampa General Hospital, did not admit African American patients. This changed in the 1950s. The Clara Frye Memorial Hospital that existed in West Tampa from 1938 to 1967 was named after her. The original Tampa General Hospital building was renamed after Frye in 1991. Frye will also be immortalized along with other prominent Tampa historical figures on the Tampa Riverwalk with a bronze bust. A memorial garden at Water Works Park (Tampa) honors her legacy."

Her debut in 1939 was for the weekly magazine Søndags-B.T. with which she remained on a contract the entire life as well as she worked throughout her life for magazines in Denmark as well as abroad. She made illustrations for novels and short stories, fashion tips, pattern sheets, vignettes for astrology as well as paper dolls. She illustrated books, a.o. the Susy Rødtop series by Gretha Stevns and the Puk series by Lisbeth Werner. She designed a series of porcelain figurines for Royal Copenhagen. Christel's drawings was sold as letterheads, in girlfriend books and in a range of other products. She made commercial drawings for several products, designed clothes and shoes under the label of Christel of Copenhagen. She sculptured and decorated mannequin dolls for Hindsgaul and in 1971 she designed the decorations and costumes for the Noël Coward play Private Lives. Her drawings were also published as a collectors itema and as pin-ups. Christel drew in a very personal style, which appealed to both young women and young men, and she was able to draw both erotic and sweat at the same time. In her own opinion she felt that her popularity was connected to the possible fact that her drawings \"contained a large element of fashion and new style at a time when girls looked dreadful in the clothes that they could buy, as no-one had yet bothered to invent women's everyday fashion\". Christel was married to the actor Johannes Marott with whom she became the mother of three children; Kasper, Stine and Kim. From 1973 and until the rest of her life she resided in Rome, Italy."

It is known that she was considered very beautiful and was favored by Liu Yan. In 920, she gave birth to his third son Liu Hongdu — who would effectively become his oldest son since Liu Hongdu's older brothers Liu Yaoshu (劉耀樞) and Liu Guitu (劉龜圖) would both die early. During Liu Yan's Dayou era (928-942), she would receive the imperial consort title Zhaoyi (昭儀). Liu Yan died in 942 and was succeeded by Liu Hongdu, who changed his name to Liu Bin. He honored Consort Zhao as consort dowager, but not as empress dowager. In 943, his younger brother Liu Hongxi the Prince of Jin, whom he had put in command of the government, had his associates Chen Daoxiang (陳道庠) and Liu Sichao (劉思潮) assassinate him, and Liu Hongxi subsequently took the throne (as Emperor Zhongzong). It is not known what occurred to Consort Dowager Zhao."

He contributed to the original Broadway musicals A Princess of Kensington (1903) (songs), The Little Cherub (1906) (additional lyrics), The Girls of Gottenberg (1908) (lyrics for \"I Can't Say That You're the Only One\"), Fluffy Ruffles (1908) (songs with lyrics), Peggy (1911) (lyrics), and The Big Show (1916) (additional lyrics). In London, he was one of the lyricists, along with Wodehouse, for Seymour Hicks's 1907 musical The Gay Gordons; Wodehouse also worked on Bovill's revue Nuts and Wine, which debuted at the Empire Theatre on 4 January 1914. The two had worked earlier together on the London newspaper The Globe. Wodehouse moved into Bovill's flat; it was while working on the revue that Bovill came up with the idea for the A Man of Means stories that were published in The Strand in England and the Delineator in the United States. The collected stories were published in 1916. Bovill died on 21 March 1918."

In 2010, Asia Sentinel described Chen Xiwo as ‘one of China’s most outspoken voices on freedom of expression for writers.’ Due to Chen's refusal to compromise about his often controversial writing however, it was nearly 20 years before his books could be published in China. He now teaches comparative literature at Fuzhou Normal University and has published seven major novels.After graduating from Fujian Normal University, Chen studied in Japan from 1989 to 1994. One recurring theme in Chen’s fiction is sex, and perhaps his most famous work I Love My Mum (遮蔽), uses incest as a metaphor for a dysfunctional society.Despite his early difficulties being published there, Chen's writing has now received widespread recognition in his homeland. One of his major novels, \"Exile\", won the eighth HuangChangXian Literature Prize. Other books, including \"Irritation\", which has also been translated into French, helped gain Chen the fourth Fujian Flowers award for outstanding literary works."

She was educated in France, where she became fluent in French and German; she did not acquire her knowledge of the other languages until after her fortieth birthday. She spent most of her life in London. Bell was born in Westminster to architect Ambrose Poynter and Emma Forster; her brother was Sir Edward Poynter, a director of the National Gallery. She was a distant relation of Edward Burne-Jones and Rudyard Kipling. She was married to banker Robert Courtenay Bell (1816–1896) with whom she had six children, one of whom was Charles Francis Bell, who oversaw the Fine Art Department of the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford. Under the direction of George Saintsbury, Bell, Ellen Marriage, and Rachel Scott were responsible for translating the vast majority of Balzac's Human Comedy into English, superseding earlier translations that had generally been regarded as stilted. The low pay that translators received at that time required Bell and her colleagues to complete work quickly, but her translations have nonetheless been noted for their close adherence to the source texts, and their high degree of readability."

  "text" : "Lieutenant Colonel Charles Kochersperger (1826—1867) was a Union Army officer with the 71st Pennsylvania Infantry Volunteers Regiment. He was the unit's second-in-command at the 1863 Battle of Gettysburg and its commander at the 1864 Battle of the Wilderness. Kochersperger was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on February 8, 1826, the eldest son of Charles Kochersperger by his wife Jane, née McDonnell. He was married there on July 4, 1849, to Sarah Ann Bozorth of the same place. In 1855, he purchased a private mail delivery company, Blood's Penny Post, which issued its own postage stamps and competed directly with the United States Postal Service. It would eventually be shut down by a Supreme Court of the United States decision. In 1861, he enlisted with the 71st Pennsylvania Volunteers Regiment. He rose to second-in-command by Gettysburg and full command for the Wilderness, where he was severely wounded. Kochersperger died from the long-term effects of his war wounds in Philadelphia on December 26, 1867, and was buried on Dec. 29 at the city's Odd Fellows Cemetery, now defunct. His widow survived him by 45 years, dying in Darby, Pennsylvania, on April 14, 1912."

He was knighted in the 1919 New Year Honours List and was further appointed a KCIE in the 1924 King's Birthday Honours. He also was founding President of Bahishkrit Hitakarini Sabha, established by B.R. Ambedkar in 1924. Sir Chimanlal was recognized by Gandhi as an impartial advocate of great integrity. While in favour of independence from Britain, Sir Chimanlal was opposed to Partition; sadly, he lived to see Partition and its accompanying horrors become a reality before his death on 10 December 1947, aged 83."

  "text" : "Carrie Reichardt is a contemporary artist, who works from a mosaic-covered studio in London, The Treatment Rooms. A member of the Craftivism movement, Carrie Reichardt uses murals, ceramics, screen-printing and graphic design in her work. She is a dedicated advocate of the movement and curated one of the few exclusively Craftivist exhibitions in the UK,. Reichardt's preoccupation with seditious ceramics places her within an artistic tradition extending as far back as William Morris and the production of subversive souvenirs during the Victorian Jubilee. Her first solo exhibition, entitles Mad in England, provided an exploration of this theme, which she has continued to pursue in subsequent work. Reichardt's most recent exhibition in the Mad in England series, timed to coincide with Elizabeth II's Diamond Jubilee, saw the artist inspired by the present day dissent evident in movements Occupy the City to UK Uncut. Reichardt trained at Kingston University and received a First class degree in Fine Art from Leeds Metropolitan University. In 2009 she was invited to become Artist in Residence at Camberwell Art College as part of the Artists Access to Art Colleges programme. This initiative provides placements for visual artists and singers in higher and further education institutions across England. She followed this by a period as Artist in Residence at the Single Homeless Project. She remains a supporter, donating a percentage of the profits from some of her ‘Mad in England’ range to the charity. For the past two years she has exhibited at the Whitecross Street Party in Islington as part of her ongoing collaboration with the SHP. Carrie Reichardt has spoken on the use of craft and art as protest, most recently for National Museums Liverpool’s International Women’s Day lectures in March 2012. She has also represented the UK as part of a group of international artists invited to mosaic the Argentinian Government building in Buenos Aires. Her recent work includes: \n*  The Tiki Love Truck – commissioned by ‘Walk the Plank’, specialists in outdoor performance. This mosaic-covered pick-up truck, was dedicated to the memory of a death-row inmate. Winning first prize at the inaugural parade in Manchester, the truck has since participated in the Illuminated Parade in Blackpool, and the Glowmobile Parade in Gateshead. \n*  Trojan Horse –a life-sized resin horse, with a skull for a face and coated in a mosaic ofinformation about the abuse of horses, made in collaboration with sculptor, Nick Reynolds. This protest against equestrian cruelty was displayed at the Cheltenham Festival Races, an event symbolic of the British establishment and an international centre of horse racing. The project was featured in The Guardian \n*  The London Elephant Parade 2010 – Carrie’s mosaic elephant, ‘Phoolan’, was part of the largest ever public art event  – taking place outside London’s Natural History Museum \n*  The Milan Elephant Parade – this joint project with Reynolds was inspired by the revolutionary spirit spreading across the world and conveyed the message that ending capitalism is the only true way to save the elephant and the planet. The elephant was displayed outside the Triennale di Milano Museum of Art. \n* Mary Bamber, a life-sized ceramic-adorned figure of the revolutionary socialist, Mary Bamber, now on permanent display at the Museum of Liverpool. Richart is best known for her anarchic crockery, where vintage floral, kitsch, royal and religious crockery is given a new twist by re-firing with layers of new ceramic decals. They are modified in a \"radical use of traditional things\", along with skulls, cheeky slogans and political statements. Carrie Reichardt’s work has featured in the press including, The Observer, The Guardian, The Evening Standard, Tile and Stone and in several books including; ‘1000 Ideas for Creative Reuse,’ Garth Johnson, ‘Mural Art No 2’, Kirikos Iosifidis and ‘The Idler 42 - Smash the System’ – Tom Hodgkinson."

  "text" : "Carla Liesching (born 1985) is an artist from Johannesburg, South Africa, based in New York City. Her work investigates human relationships to structure, particularly ideological shifts in geographic organisation and narrative. Liesching's practice addresses conceptions of self in relation to place, movement, distance and belonging. Interested in the photographic portrait's agency in the shaping of identity narratives, Liesching creates archives of staged environmental portraits, which parodically hearken back to the medium's early involvement with human classification systems and pseudo-scientific exploration (for example, photography used in the aid of physiognomy, physical anthropology, phrenology, Darwinism and colonialism.) Liesching's installations often include sculptural and sound components alongside her photographic work. She is most recognised for her photographic series The Swimmers. Liesching is represented by Cape Town-based gallery Brundyn & Gonsalves."

  "text" : "Charles Joseph Gravier (4 March 1865, Orléans – 15 November 1937, Paris) was a French zoologist. He initially taught classes at École normale (1883–85) in Orléans and at the École normale supérieure de Saint-Cloud, afterwards becoming a professor of natural history at the École normale (1887) in Grenoble. In 1893 he obtained his aggregation of natural sciences and in 1896 his PhD in sciences. Later he became first assistant to Edmond Perrier (1844–1921) at the Muséum national d'histoire naturelle in Paris, where from 1903 he served as an assistant to Louis Joubin (1861–1935). In 1917 he attained the chair of zoology (worms and crustaceans) at the museum. Gravier is known for his research of Anthozoa (class containing sea anemones and corals). The genera Gravieria, Gravierella and Gravieropsammia are named after him, as are numerous marine species. In 1923 he was made a chevalier of the Légion d'honneur and commander on 6 August 1937."

Afterwards he worked as an assistant to Karl Brandt (1854-1931) at the zoological institute in Kiel. As a young man he carried out studies of freshwater plankton in Holstein lakes (1890-95). In May- 1898 he obtained his habilitation at Kiel for zoology and comparative anatomy, and a few months later took part as a zoologist in the Deutschen Tiefsee-Expedition (German Deep Sea Expedition) aboard the steamship \"Valdivia\". In 1906 he was appointed associate professor in Kiel, and in 1911 became a scientific officer in the Preußischen Akademie der Wissenschaften in Berlin. In this position he worked as a publisher of scientific journals in the field of zoology, which included editorship of Das Tierreich (The Animal Kingdom; from 1927). He was a member of the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature, and from 1918 to 1945 was secretary of the Deutschen Zoologischen Gesellschaft (German Zoological Society). In addition to his research involving the 1898-99 Deutschen Tiefsee-Expedition, he was tasked with processing material taken from the Plankton-Expedition (1889) and the Deutschen Südpolar-Expedition (1901-1903). In his investigations, Apstein distinguished himself in research of Thaliacea."

The government of Belize pursued a dubious disciplinary action against him despite the objections of the Solicitor-General (who resigned and left the country over the case), and he was reduced in rank for six months. Williams was eventually reinstated, but the accusations continued to dog his career until it was revealed that the man he had allegedly murdered was actually alive and well in the United States, a fact that had been known to his superiors for some time. Thus vindicated, Williams took up a new post as Officer Commanding the Cayo District Police, but the following month announced that he would be taking study leave in order to attend law school."

  "text" : "Chiara Matraini (1515–1604) was an Italian Renaissance writer from Lucca. Primarily known for her love poetry, composed in the style of Petrarch, she also authored a number of spiritual prose and verse texts. Matraini wrote throughout her long life, publishing her last text, the Dialoghi spirituali (1602), when she was well into her 80s. Her many projects included genres that were uncommon for women writers of her time, such as an oration on the art of war, a translation from Latin to vernacular, and several didactic religious texts. Matraini's writing demonstrates an eagerness to compose in an authoritative voice. She was married to Vincenzo Cantarini, with whom she had one son. Her husband's early death apparently facilitated her active literary life. Her literary contacts included Benedetto Varchi and Lodovico Domenichi."

He was the son of poet Rafael Obligado (the author of \"Santos Vega\") and Isabel Gómez Langenheim. He pursued studies at the Colegio Nacional de Buenos Aires and took his doctorate at the Universidad Nacional de Buenos Aires in 1917. His first book, \"Poemas\", was published in 1920. He translated several French poets (Victor Hugo, Lamartine, Alfred de Musset and others). He was a literary critic, lecturer and university professor and served as the director of the Instituto de Literatura Argentina. In 1928 he traveled to Europe, visiting several countries. On his return to Argentina, he was named a dean of the Faculty of Philosophy and Letters. He was later named a member of the Academia Argentina de Letras and the Real Academia Española. In 1932, he produced a comprehensive translation of the poems of Edgar Allan Poe and Percy Shelley as well as a critical study of Leopoldo Lugones. The Spanish government awarded him the Civil Order of Alfonso X, the Wise in 1947. He was manager of the \"Bibliotecas Populares\" of the Ministry of Education when he died on February 3, 1949."

During his career (1964 to 1997), he specialized in drama rather than comedy. In film, he held several leading roles but is especially distinguished in auxiliary roles depicting more limited characters. He is especially remembered for his first-class performance in Army of Shadows by Jean-Pierre Melville in 1969. Appearing in a number of soaps and TV shows of the late 1960s to early 1980s, Barbier gained a certain notoriety thanks to the character of Joseph Durtol, bounded and proud hero of The Man of Picardy, the legendary French television series. He died in Manosque (Alpes de Haute-Provence), aged 85."

There he became secretary of Leonardo Pesaro, Procurator of San Marco, and later, in 1676, was appointed canon of St Mark's Basilica. From 1663, he wrote several librettos for operas which were performed in the theaters of Venice, Vienna and Piacenza. He catalogued all opera performances held in Venice from 1637 until 1681 in his treatise Memorie teatrali di Venzia (Theatrical Memories of Venice), published in 1680 as part of collection Minerva al tavolino. He wrote all his works in Italian.

He married Louise Smith in London in 1918. In 1919, Stork received a homestead near Eastend. His first wife died in 1936 and he married Jean Sturdy in 1938. Stork was defeated when he ran for reelection in the Swift Current provincial riding in 1938. In October 1938, he refused to stand for nomination in the federal Maple Creek riding after his name was put forward. By the following year, he had become an organizer for the Liberal party. Stork moved to Regina, where he was involved in the oil business, and later moved to Calgary. After the death of his second wife in 1958, he moved to London, Ontario, still employed in the oil industry. Stork became seriously ill in 1968 and died two years later."

  "text" : "Major Claus Enevold Paarss (18 February 1683 – 26 May 1762) was a Dano-Norwegian military officer and official. Retired from service, he was appointed governor of Greenland by King Frederick IV between 1728 and 1730. Major Paarss commanded a Danish man-of-war and three or four other ships to Hans Egede's \"Haabets Koloni\" on Kangeq, which he removed to the mainland opposite and fortified under the name \"Godt-Haab\", later known as Godthåb and then Nuuk. His contingent of colonists consisted of twenty soldiers, three sergeants, and two officers from the Danish artillery corps, along with twelve military convicts, ten unmarried mothers, and two female convicts who were to be wed to one another according to lots. He also carried a dozen horses. After putting down a general mutiny, Paarss tried and failed twice to cross the island from the Ameralik Fjord in search of resources and a connection to the supposed location of the old Norse Eastern Settlement. He also proposed a scheme to populate Greenland with fallen Danish aristocrats and their households on the model of the French colonies in Canada. Meanwhile, forty of his colonists died of scurvy and other complaints, leading to the abandonment of the colony even by the native Greenlanders."

  "text" : "Christopher Gerald Pole-Carew (born May 1931) in 1979 High Sheriff of Nottinghamshire, was, after serving in the Royal Navy, during his working life, a newspaper executive who rose to notoriety in his handling of trade union membership, initially as managing director of the Nottingham Evening Post who sacked journalists who joined the trade union or for going on strike for LESS pay than they were currently receiving - about £1,00 a year,  and later under Rupert Murdoch, where his role included trade union matters. The appointment brought comment in the House of Commons. Pole-Carew was educated at Great Walstead School and the Royal Naval College, Dartmouth, from the age of 13. Pole-Carew's appointment as High Sheriff of Nottinghamshire was the subject in 1979 of a House of Commons motion deploring it. Although retired, Pole-Carew is currently registered as holding two directorships. Pole-Carew lives near Axminster, in Devon, with Gillian, his wife. Prior to this the Pole-Carews had been custodians for 20 years of Old Shute House, near Axminster, owned by the National Trust.. Pole-Carew is a descendant of William Pole (1515–1587), MP for Bossiney, who purchased the Shute estate in 1560. Pole-Carew was hated by the print unions, largely because he proved them wrong in the way the newspaper industry should (and became to be) run. Yet he was deeply liked by his staff, whether journalists or printers. This was proved in 2001, when 24 of his old staff from Nottingham came down and stayed in the West Country so as to give him a party for his 70th birthday. Organised by Barrie Williams, who wrote Pole-Carew's biography: 'Somebody Had to Do It'."

Walter Thompson ad agency. Born on an Indian reservation near Tulsa, Oklahoma, Dawkins grew up in New York City, where he studied art with plans to become a portrait painter. He met John Severin when both attended the High School of Music & Art and their close friendship continued throughout their lives. In 1943, he worked with WABC radio's wartime all-night record operation. Joining the Air Corps that year, he graduated from private to corporal while working in public relations and on corps newspapers. Returning to New York after the end of WWII, he began his 34-year career at J. Walter Thompson Company as a mailroom messenger, advancing to market research clerk and copywriter. From 1949 to 1951, he worked in JWT's office in London, where he married Patricia Horan, an American who worked in the art department of the London office. After a period in Montreal, he rejoined the New York office, where he became the Vice President in 1965. In 1972, he was Creative Director in JWT's Paris office."

Private correspondence about Father Damien, penned by Hyde and published without his permission, sparked a heated public rebuke from Robert Louis Stevenson who expressed his belief that sainthood lay ahead for Damien."

  "text" : "Casimir Maistre (24 September 1867, in Villeneuvette (Hérault) – 20 September 1957, in Montpellier) was a French explorer and geographer. In 1889-91 with Georges Foucart (1865-1943), he participated in the \"Catat mission\" in Madagascar, an exploratory investigation of the island's resources. In early 1892 he was sent by the Comité de l'Afrique française to the French Congo in order to reinforce an exploratory mission led by Jean Dybowski (1856-1928). At Brazzaville he met with Dybowski, who was ill and on his way back to France. On June 29, Maistre and a handful of Europeans, departed from their position on the Kémo (a tributary of the Ubanghi)  in order to explore largely unfamiliar regions of the continent's interior. On the expedition he would journey over 5000 kilometers, engaging in numerous treaties with African chieftains as a means to consolidate French influence in the region. In the interior he recognized that the Chari and Logone Rivers were navigable year-round, as well as primary access routes to/from the Lake Chad area. After his return to France, he was honored by the Société de Géographie in 1894 for his exploratory efforts. As a result of the mission, he published two books: \n*  À travers l'Afrique centrale, du Congo au Niger (1892-1893), (1893) \n*  La région du Bahr Sara, (1902). After his return from Africa, he settled in Villeneuvette, where he worked as a manager in a family-owned factory."

The Great Northern War began in 1700 and Creutz landing in Zealand. He distinguished himself at the battles of Petschora and Kletsh (in present-day Poland). Promotions to major and lieutenant colonel then came quickly. Creutz became a colonel in 1704. The Battle of Poltava in 1709 brought Creutz command of the entire cavalry. However, he had to surrender soon after Perevolotnya. After Count Piper's death, he was the senior Swedish prisoner in Russia, of which his extant correspondence bears visible witness. In 1722, he was able to return to Sweden and service in the cavalry."

Chuzi was the grandson of Duke Jian of Qin, who was the uncle of his predecessor Duke Ling. When Duke Ling died in 415 BC, the throne was passed to his uncle Duke Jian instead of his son, the later Duke Xian. Duke Jian reigned for 15 years and was succeeded by his son, Chuzi's father Duke Hui II, who reigned for 13 years and died in 387 BC. When Chuzi succeeded his father as ruler of Qin he was either one or two years old, and the power was controlled by his mother, the duchess dowager. Just two years later, in 385 BC the minister Jun Gai (菌改) rebelled against Chuzi and the duchess. He led his forces to escort Duke Xian, who was at the time exiled in the State of Wei, back to Qin, killed Chuzi and his mother, and installed Duke Xian on the throne. Chuzi was just three or four years old when he died."

On March 3, 1956, in Amsterdam she broke the 20-year-old record of 1:04.6 by Willy den Ouden, who like Gastelaars, was born and raised in Rotterdam. Only later it turned out that her time of 1:04.2 was an improvement on Dawn Fraser race in 1:04.5 in Sydney the previous week. On April 14 Gastelaars lowered the record to 1:04.0 in her home base swimming pool in Schiedam. The decision by the Dutch Olympic Committee to boycott the Olympics in Melbourne that same year in protest of the Soviet invasion of Hungary caused her to miss out on a likely medal in the 100m individual freestyle and the 4 × 100 m relays. She did compete in the 1960 Summer Olympics, but was past her prime at that point and finished seventh in 100m freestyle."

He emigrated to the United States in 1868, going on the last LDS charter sailing ship (after this LDS emigrant companies used steam ships) and was part of the last overland Mormon pioneer company before the railroad was completed. In 1869, Lund married Petra Antonie Maria Jensen, a native of Denmark. After her death he married Anna Nielsen, who was also from Denmark. Lund settled in Mount Pleasant, Utah Territory, shortly after his first marriage. He served as city recorder, member of the city council, mayor, and justice of the peace. He was a member of the territorial legislature in 1890 and 1894 and a member of the Utah State Constitutional Conventions of 1882 and 1888, both of which had their attempts to gain statehood rejected by the United States Congress. From 1879 to 1880, Lund served a mission for the LDS Church in Minnesota and the surrounding states. From 1890 to 1896, he was the bishop of the Mount Pleasant Ward. From 1896 to 1898, he served as president of the Scandinavian Mission of the LDS Church. When the North Sanpete Stake was formed in 1898, covering the northern part of the county, Lund became its first president."

He studied medicine at the Universities of Tübingen and Würzburg, afterwards attending lectures on geology and zoology in Vienna and Prague. In 1862 he traveled to Cairo, where he spent eighteen months learning Arabic. Beginning in February 1864 he worked as a physician at Kosseir, a seaport on the Red Sea. Here he spent five years collecting a vast quantity of fish and other marine specimens. From 1869 he examined his Red Sea collection at the Staatliches Museum für Naturkunde Stuttgart, traveling to Frankfurt and Berlin in order to conduct zoological comparison studies. At Stuttgart he also investigated Australian fish species procured by Ferdinand von Müller (1825-1896), from whose collection Klunzinger described approximately fifty new species from Australia and New Zealand. In 1872 he was back in Kosseir collecting additional marine specimens, later returning to Stuttgart (1875), where in 1884 he was appointed professor of zoology at the University of Stuttgart. His name is associated with a number of zoological species, such as Pempheris klunzingeri,  Leiognathus klunzingeri, Cladiella klunzingeri, Dendronephthya klunzingeri, Hypseleotris klunzingeri and Echinoecus klunzingeri."

Tokoudagba continued the tradition of bas-relief though the use of cement and commercially available synthetic paint, while also producing works on canvas, frescoes and monumental sculptures. In 1989, Cyprien left Benin for the first time to exhibit at “Magiciens de la Terre” in Paris, France.Tokoudagba's work was exhibited at the \"Ouidah '92\" festival, which celebrated Vodun art from Benin and the African Diaspora in Ouidah, Benin in February 1993.His works have also been exhibited in the following museums: Smithsonian institution - National Museum of African Art, Washington, DC; Musée Dapper, Paris, France; Museum Kunst Palast, Düsseldorf, Germany; Hayward Gallery, London, Englands; Centre Georges Pompidou, Paris, France; Mori Art Museum, Tokyo, Japan; São Paulo Biennale, Brasil."

While there she met and in 1925 married Edward Pakenham, later 6th Earl of Longford. She moved to Ireland with her husband in 1925. They divided their time between Dublin and Pakenham Hall, now Tullynally Castle, in Castlepollard, County Westmeath. In 1930, Christine Longford and her husband bought shares in The Dublin Gate Theatre Company. In addition to designing costumes and managing productions Christine wrote plays including Lord Edward and Patrick Sarsfield. She also adapted novels for the stage, Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice among them. The company suffered when the Longfords withdrew their backing. Her books include A Biography of Dublin, published as part of the Biographies of Cities series, Country Places, published by Parkside Press Dublin and Making Conversation, republished by Persephone Books in 2009."

He worked at the Victoria & Albert Museum's collection of English watercolours and miniature portraits before moving to the Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge in 1946 following the end of World War II. Winter was born in Melbourne, the son of Carl Winter and his wife Ethel (née Hardy). He was educated and Xavier College and Newman College, University of Melbourne. He came to England in 1928 and attended Exeter College, Oxford. He married Theodora (née Barlow) in 1936; they had two sons and a daughter, but were divorced in 1953. He was appointed as an Assistant Keeper in the Departments of Engraving, Illustration and Design, and of Paintings, at the Victoria & Albert Museum 1931, where he worked with Basil Long, leading the department after Long's death in 1936. He was appointed as Deputy Keeper at the V&A in 1945, but moved to become Director and Morley Curator at the Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge in 1946, and also a fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge, where he remained until his death in 1966. He published Elizabethan Miniatures in 1943, and The British School of Miniature Portrait Painters in 1948. Along with Patrick Trevor-Roper and Peter Wildeblood, Winter gave evidence to the Wolfenden Committee, whose report led in 1967 to the decriminalization of sex between adult male homosexuals. He gave evidence anonymously as \"Mr White\". His testimony to the Committee has been portrayed on-screen in the BBC dramatisation, Consenting Adults."

During World War II, Lakey was a member of several U.S. Army bands. He also directed his own band (1946). In 1947, Lakey enrolled at the University of North Texas during its inaugural year of first jazz degree program offered in the world. In 1949, at the request of Gene Hall, the jazz program's founding director, Lakey, as student conductor, became the first conductor of the Laboratory Dance Band, the original name of the One O'Clock Lab Band. After various stints directing youth bands in the Los Angeles suburbs — San Fernando Valley Youth Band and Claudhoppers Youth Band — and running his own music retail store, Lakey founded (circa 1963) Claude Lakey Mouthpieces, Inc., maker of woodwind mouthpieces. In 1990, he sold the company to Nicholas D. Bogden (born 1947) who moved it from Nacogdoches, Texas, to Redmond, Washington and operates the company under its original name. Bogden, in the 1980s, had been the general manager of Rumbo Recorders, a three studio audio recording facility located in the San Fernando Valley area of Los Angeles."

Their first recorded match was January 14, 1881, when Hadley won points in a three-rounder and claimed the Grant's title. Hadley fought Grant a 10 more times while he was the colored champ, beating him eight times. In their seventh fight, held on May 4, 1882 in New York City, their four-rounder was declared a no-contest. Their next fight, on June 20 of the same year, saw Morris finally beat the undefeated Hadley (whose \"official\" record was 12-0-2 at the time), besting the champ on points in a four rounder. Hadley apparently did not put his belt at stake for the fight, for he continued as champion until 1883, when he was finally bested by George \"Old Chocolate\" Godfrey. Morris lost three more fights to Hadley during his championship reign and one after Hadley lost his title to Godfrey. The last time they battled while Hadley was the colored champ was on December 7, 1882, when they fought in New York City for the Police Gazette Medal Championship of America. Hadley KO-ed Morris in the third round. Their last fight was on December 8, 1883-12-08, exactly one year and one day after they had last met in the ring. Morris apparently was outpointed by the ex-champ and retired from pro boxing."

  "text" : "Clay John Schexnayder (born February 1969) is a businessman from Ascension Parish, Louisiana, who is a Republican member of the Louisiana House of Representatives. His House District 8, opened to competition when the Republican incumbent John LaBruzzo of Jefferson Parish was shifted through redistricting into District 94. In the general election held on November 19, 2011, Schexnayder defeated the Democrat Kevin Hull, 5,549 (64 percent) to 3,116 (36 percent).LaBruzzo, meanwhile, was defeated in his district. Schexnayder is the son of Perry P. Schexnayder and the former Dorothy Ann Demars (1937-2009).In 1989, Schexnayder graduated from French Settlement High School. Two years later, he graduated from the Allen Institute in Atlanta, Georgia, where he studied basic automotive mechanics. A former race car driver, he participated in competition in the circuit encompassing Louisiana, Mississippi, and Arkansas circuit. He was formerly employed by the Firestone Tire and Rubber Company. Since 1998, he has operated Car Craft Automotive in Sorrento in Ascension Parish. He is a former part-time sheriff's deputy in Ascension Parish. Schexnayder and his wife, the former Phoebe Keller, have four children. In his legislative campaign, Schexnayder promised to seek more jobs to the state and to strengthen infrastructure and education. Schexnayder ran with the backing of Governor Bobby Jindal and the outgoing Republican Representative Mert Smiley in District 89, who was instead elected as the Ascension Parish assessor.The TEA Party movement termed Schexnayder a \"tax and spend Republican\" and refused to support him.\""

  "text" : "Christopher D. Broadwater, known as Chris Broadwater (born March 22, 1972), is an attorney in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, who is a Republican member of the Louisiana House of Representatives from District 86, which encompasses within Tangipahoa Parish the communities of Independence, Tickfaw, Natalbany, and northwestern Hammond, Broadwater's own city of residence. Broadwater won the seat in a low-turnout general election held on November 19, 2011. Broadwater defeated fellow Republican George Holton, 2,800 (56.9 percent) to 2,125 (43.2 percent). A native of Saint Francisville in West Feliciana Parish, Broadwater listed the key campaign issues in 2011 as economic development and education. He claimed that his private sector experience and his work as the former director of the office of workers compensation would give him an early advantage as a legislator. Broadwater promised to pursue a balanced state budget. As the former head of a state agency, he developed and managed a $62 million departmental budget during the first term of Governor Bobby Jindal. Broadwater won the seat vacated by the term-limited Speaker Jim Tucker in a low-turnout general election held on November 19, 2011. Tucker himself ran unsuccessfully for Louisiana Secretary of State but lost to incumbent Tom Schedler. District 86 had been relocated after the 2010 United States Census. The \"District 86\" represented by Tucker was south of Lake Pontchartrain, but Broadwater's constituency was entirely north of the Lake. (The area south of the Lake had lost population because of Hurricane Katrina.) Broadwater is a 1995 graduate of Baptist-affiliated Louisiana College in Pineville. He graduated in 1998 from the New Orleans Baptist Theological Seminary. In 2002, he received his Juris Doctor from the Louisiana State University Law Center in Baton Rouge. Broadwater and his wife, the former Hilaria Nelson of Franklinton in Washington Parish have three daughters—Emma Grace, Rose Kathron, and Maggie Frances. The Broadwaters are members of First Presbyterian Church of Hammond."

  "text" : "Cuthbert Robert Blackett F.C.S., J.P. (9 October 1831 – 1902), was a Victorian Government Analytical Chemist in colonial Australia. Blackett was the son of the Rev. C. R. Blackett, Independent minister at Southminster, England, where he was born 9 October 1831. Having served his time as a pharmaceutical chemist, he arrived in Melbourne in January 1853, and became a member of the first council of the Pharmaceutical Society, and ultimately its secretary and president. He was also for five years editor of the journal published by that society. On the passing of the Pharmacy Act in 1877, the Government appointed him one of the members of the Pharmacy Board, and on the retirement of Mr. Bosisto he was elected President. He was examiner in chemistry to the College of Pharmacy, and for some time acted as lecturer on chemistry, materia medica, and botany, pending the arrival of Professor A. H. Jackson, B.8o. In 1879 he was elected to the Legislative Assembly for Fitzroy in the Conservative interest. Mr. Blackett was President of the Royal Technological Commission; and when the Central Board of Health was formed he was offered the position of president, but declined it. In 1882 he was again returned for Fitzroy, but was defeated at the next general election, owing to his pronounced free-trade views. Mr. Blackett was appointed Government Analytical Chemist on the death of Mr. Johnson, in 1887, and is also a Fellow of the Chemical Society of London, and was co-examiner in chemistry to the Melbourne University, until he resigned the office. Mr. Blackett married Miss Margaretta Palmer in May 1870 at Stokesley, England."

  "text" : "Charles Paul Ernest of Bentheim-Steinfurt (30 August 1729 – 30 June 1780) was a Count of Steinfurt. He was the son of the reigning Count Frederick and his wife Francisca Charlotte, née Countess of Lippe. His father died young and Charles Paul Ernest became head of the Bentheim-Steinfurt family in 1733. Initially, he had to share power in the territories of Steinfurt and Alpen with his great-uncle Statius Philip (1668-1749). Under the guardianship of his great-uncle, he enjoyed an excellent education. His Hofmeister Johann Christoph Buch accompanied him on several long journeys to perfect his foreign language skills. In 1748, he married Sophie Charlotte, the eldest daughter of Frederick William II, Prince of Nassau-Siegen. In 1749, he great-uncle and regent Statius Philip died, and Charles Paul Ernest took up the business of government. At times, he lived in Paris, where he became acquainted with Voltaire. Charles Paul Ernest had a strong interest in history an collected rare books, incunables, manuscripts, images, coins and natural history curiosities. In 1765, he began creating the Steinfurter Bagno Park. He had the welfare of his subjects at heart; his subjects liked and revered him. In 1770, he joined the Palatinate Academy of Sciences in Mannheim. His youngest daughter, Caroline of Bentheim-Steinfurt was active as a writer. Charles Paul Ernest died on 30 June 1780 and was succeeded by his son Louis (1756-1817), who was described as highly educated, intellectual and interested in scientific and economical issues."

  "text" : "Carl Friedrich Haase, name sometimes spelled as Karl Friedrich Haase (13 February 1788, Leipzig - 10 November 1865, Ober-Lössnitz near Dresden) was a German obstetrician. In 1813 he obtained his medical doctorate from the University of Leipzig with the thesis Dissertatio de morbo coeruleao. In 1828 he was appointed professor of obstetrics and director of the maternity clinic at the medical-surgical academy in Dresden. His name is associated with the \"Haase rule\", a formula for suggesting the age of a human fetus or newborn from its length (fetal length in centimeters during the first 3 to 5 months of pregnancy correlates to the square of the age in months, and during the second half of pregnancy the age in months is MULTIPLIED by 5). It is also referred to as \"Haase's formula\" (Haase-Formel). With Johann Ludwig Choulant (1791-1861) and others, he was co-author of Bereicherungen für die Geburtshilfe, für die Physiologie und Pathologie des Weibes und Kindes (Enrichment for obstetrics, on the physiology and pathology of women and children). In 1846 with obstetrician Woldemar Ludwig Grenser (1812-1872), he successfully treated future writer Karl May (1842-1912) for visual impairment."

His involvement in Athenian politics helped pave the way for the rule of the Four Hundred following the Athenian coup of 411 BCE. Clitophon also appears in the writing of Plato, and presents a philosophy of \"thoroughgoing normative relativism\" in a brief role in the Republic."

  "text" : "Charlotte Harrison (born 31 July 1989) is a New Zealand field hockey player. She has competed for the New Zealand women's national field hockey team (the Black Sticks Women), including for the team at the 2012 Summer Olympics and at the 2006 and 2010 Commonwealth Games, and as a reserve for the team at the 2008 Summer Olympics. Harrison was first selected for the Black Sticks Women in October 2005 on the back of her performance for Northland in the National Hockey League that year. At the time, she was 16 years old, making her the youngest ever player selected for the Black Sticks Women. She played her first match for the Black Sticks on 31 October 2005, against Australia in Pakuranga, Auckland, as part of the 2005 Oceania Cup and World Cup qualifier. Born in Palmerston North to Steve and Zanna Harrison, Charlotte spent most of her early life living in Whangarei. She is of Māori descent, and affiliates to the Ngāpuhi iwi. She has two younger sisters: Samantha, who joined Charlotte playing for the Black Sticks Women in 2009, and Anita. Despite Charlotte being two years older and three centimetres (1 in) shorter than her sister Samantha, once the two competed together for the Black Sticks, their similarities in appearance became apparent and were often mistaken for each other by comentators and match officials. This was partially alleviated by Samantha dyeing her hair brown in mid-2010, but within a year reverted to her natural blonde colour. Harrison attended Whangarei Girls' High School, before later studying beauty therapy at the Auckland University of Technology. As of August 2012, she resides on Auckland's North Shore where she is employed as a beautician. At club level, Harrison is a member of the Southern Districts Hockey Club, based in Papatoetoe, Auckland. In the National Hockey League, she is a member of the Northland women's team."

His surname indicates that he was from the monastery of Xanthopoulos. With another monk, Ignatius Xanthopoulos, Callistus composed the important Century, a tract of 100 sections on the ascetical practices of the Hesychastic monks; it was incorporated in the Philokalia of Nicodemus the Hagiorite and had a great influence on Orthodox spirituality. The majority of Patriarchs in the 14th century were monks in the Hesychast tradition. Within the Orthodox Church, his memory is celebrated on 22 November."

Mathile shared some of the proceeds with 2,000 Iams employees. In 1970, dissatisfied with corporate life, Mathile accepted a job as sales manager at a small, regional pet food manufacturer: The Iams Food Company in Dayton, Ohio. Over time, he became the company's sole owner, CEO, and chairman. Known for his commitment to developing products that delivered superior nutrition, Mathile also emphasized innovative marketing. He is one of the few entrepreneurs to lead a company with two successful premium brands — Iams and Eukanuba."

Described by his contemporaries and by historians as \"ingenious\" and \"restless,\" many of his projects proved too ambitious to be realized and few attained real success. In certain quarters he was described contemptuously as a \"visionary projector,\" yet he was also credited with being the first to conceive a waterway to the West that would ultimately be achieved by the Erie Canal."

  "text" : "Bishop Chrysostomos of Zakynthos (1890–1958) was the Metropolitan Bishop of Zakynthos during the Second World War, and a key figure in saving the entire, 275-person strong Jewish population of the island. During the Nazi occupation of Greece, Mayor Loukás Karrer and Bishop Chrysostomos refused Nazi orders to turn in a list of the members of the town's Jewish community for deportation to the death camps. Instead they secreted the town's 275 Jews in various rural villages and turned in a list that included only their own two names. The entire Jewish population survived the war. However, as punishment for insubordination, the Nazis took all of the island's children to work in camps, but fortunately not to be killed. When they had loaded up the children into a truck and drove away, the truck stopped because of sheep crossing the road. Two children jumped out and escaped the Nazis. Statues of the Bishop and the Mayor commemorate their heroism on the site of the town's historic synagogue, destroyed in the earthquake of 1953. In 1978, Yad Vashem, the Holocaust Martyrs' and Heroes' Remembrance Authority in Israel, honored Bishop Chrysostomos and Mayor Loukás Karrer with the title of \"Righteous Among the Nations\", an honor given to non-Jews who, at personal risk, saved Jews during the Holocaust. After the war, all of the Jews of Zakynthos moved either to Israel or to Athens."

  "text" : "Carl Weinberg is an American economist. He is the founder, Chief Economist and managing director of High Frequency Economics, an economic research firm located in Valhalla, NY. Weinberg was born in the Bronx and raised in Teaneck, NJ. He earned his bachelor's degree from Rutgers University. He received a doctorate in economics from the University of Pennsylvania, as a student of Nobel laureate Lawrence Klein. At the University of Pennsylvania, Weinberg also worked under prominent economists F. Gerald Adams, Robert Summers, Oliver E. Williamson and Albert Ando. Weinberg is one of the original participants in Project Link, an econometric modeling group sponsored by the U.N. He is still a contributor to the group, participating in panel discussions at Project Link conferences in New York and Beijing. Weinberg has also worked on econometric modeling projects at Wharton Econometric Forecasting Associates and at the National Bureau of Economic Research. Throughout his career, Weinberg has been based in Toronto, London, Paris, New York and Italy, and he has spent extended time as an advisor in Africa and Latin America. As an IBM Fellow, Weinberg spent several years in Italy in the 1970s, developing macroeconomic modeling innovations at the IBM Scientific Center, located in Pisa. Starting in 1982, while based in Toronto as an economist at the Bank of Montreal, Weinberg served on several bank advisory committees aimed at negotiating multi-year restructuring deals to keep Latin American sovereign borrowers from defaulting on their loans. He worked directly with finance ministers, central bank governors and other officials of several Latin American governments to develop sustainable restructuring programs. These experiences provided Weinberg with unique insights into the European sovereign-debt crisis. In the spring of 2010, he recommended multi-year restructuring of Greece's sovereign debt obligations, anticipating the eventual outcome two years in advance. In the late 1980s, Weinberg was based in New York, at Shearson Lehman Brothers, as the firm's Senior International Economist. During his time at Lehman, he served as an advisor for projects in Africa and Latin America, including a long-term project with the government of Cameroon. At High Frequency Economics, Weinberg serves as Managing Director and Chief Economist. Under his leadership, High Frequency Economics grew from a two-man firm distributing daily macroeconomic research by messenger service to a global company with 350 client institutions in 25 countries. In addition to his experience in practical economics, Weinberg has maintained connections throughout his career to the academic world. While living in Italy, he lectured in economics at the European University Institute in Florence. In France, he taught at the American College in Paris. He has also taught economics courses at the Wharton School. Weinberg is currently a professor in the graduate program in economics at New York University. He teaches a popular course in international finance. In the spring of 2012, he initiated the Eurocrisis Discussion Group in NYU's department of economics, a group of economists that meets regularly to analyze developments in the European sovereign-debt crisis. Under Weinberg's leadership, the group prepared an article for Barron's \"Other Voices\" column titled, \"How Europe is 'Unfixing' Its Problems.\""

  "text" : "Claudio Di Veroli (born 1946) is an Italian-Argentinian harpsichordist who has written four books on baroque performance practice. Born in Buenos Aires, Argentina, he was raised in an Italian family and attended Italian primary and secondary school. He studied privately in Buenos Aires under Ernesto Epstein (piano and interpretation), Erwin Leuchter (harmony) and Ljerko Spiller (chamber music), obtained a degree in Mathematics from the University of Buenos Aires and a PhD in Statistics from Imperial College, London. Living in Europe in the early 70's he studied harpsichord with Colin Tilney in London and Hubert Bédard in Paris. He then returned to Buenos Aires, where he pioneered the performance of Baroque music based on ancient practices. He was Professor of Harpsichord and examiner of the Organ course at the Conservatorio Nacional in Buenos Aires. He has lived in Ireland since 2001. He recently offered a masterclass in his adopted city of Bray, Ireland. As a soloist he has performed extensively in concert halls, churches and television, both solo and with ensembles. In 1984, a reviewer observed that he, \"did not miss any detail in order to complete the historical legitimacy of his performance, and also produced a logical, live expressivness\". A year later, the same reviewer noted his \"virtuosity in the formidable 'Cadenza' of the Fifth Brandenburg Concerto\", a performance which was the world's first contemporary one with Baroque fingerings. He is the author of four books as well as many papers. Favourable reviews have appeared in Stimulus, Early Music America and the British Clavichord Society Newsletter.)."

  "text" : "Clayton Anthony Fountain (September 12, 1955 – July 12, 2004) was a federal prisoner, member of the Aryan Brotherhood, and convicted murderer. Clayton was born on September 12, 1955, at the U.S. Army Hospital in Fort Benning, Georgia. Clayton was the oldest of six children, having one brother and four sisters, and was named after his father, Clayton Raleigh Fountain. The family moved every 1½ to 2 years. While his father served combat tours in Korea and Vietnam and his mother was working, Clayton, as the oldest child in family, became a surrogate for both parents when he was very young. He recalls maternal responsibilities for cooking, ironing, serving, cleaning, and caring for his young siblings. It was the male/paternal role, however, for which his father had carefully trained him. While serving in the Marines, he was convicted of murdering his staff sergeant in 1974, while stationed in the Philippines. He was sentenced to life imprisonment, and was ultimately sent to the United States Penitentiary, Marion, which was at the time, the highest-security prison in the nation. Fountain used his military training to murder three prisoners and one correctional officer with a home made knife while serving time at Marion, and was labeled the \"Most Dangerous Prisoner\" in the federal system. After stabbing an officer to death in 1983, Fountain was moved to the United States Medical Center for Federal Prisoners in Springfield, Missouri. He was housed in a specially constructed containment unit, and was only allowed contact with authorized personnel. Fountain converted to Catholicism, and completed several educational courses on theology during the twenty years he spent in virtual isolation. He developed ties with an order of Trappist monks, and was accepted posthumously as a lay brother after his unexpected death from a heart attack in 2004. The book A Different Kind of Cell: The Story of a Murderer Who Became a Monk is based on his life and religious conversion."

His thirst for adventure was expressed by his arrival to Spain as Ambassador of Venezuela in the early 1970s, by crossing the Atlantic ocean sailing his beloved VITO sailboat. In his role as Ambassador, Carlos signed several peace treaties and was awarded several decorations, like the Great Order of Hispanic Culture Institute, the Order of Liberatator of Venezuela and the Knight Grand Cross of Spain's Order of Isabella the Catholic in 1972.

  "text" : "Charles H. Pearce (1817-1887) was an African-American political and religious elder in Florida from 1865 until his death. He helped bring the African Methodist Episcopal (AME) Church to Florida and worked to build its congregation during and after the Reconstruction Era. He also built political power through the expanding congregation, held several offices, was influential in his support (and in some cases opposition to others seeking office or in office), and established educational institutions and won state support of the education for all Floridians. He was a prominent black officeholder in the post-Civil War era, a time when threats, the KKK, and animosity to freed blacks was high. Pearce stated that, \"A man in this State, cannot do his whole duty as a minister except he looks out for the political interests of his people.\" In an act of political payback, he was disqualified as an elector on the Hayes and Wheeler ticket after a felony conviction for offering a bribe. There were other efforts to dispute and prevent the seating of black electors. Pearce had rivals within the AME church and among the leaders of the Baptist Church in Florida. Among his work to establish schools for African-Americans, Pearce helped establish the predecessor to what became Edward Waters College. Pearce was born enslaved in Queen Anne's County, Maryland in 1817. As a young man, he purchased his freedom and moved to New Haven, Connecticut, where he was ordained a minister in the AME Church. He later moved to Canada, where he was a preacher until 1865. In that year, he moved to Florida as a missionary. While in Florida, he was elected ot the Florida constitutional convention of 1868, but was expelled by moderate Republicans because of his British citizenship. Nevertheless, he was elected to the Florida Senate in 168 and served in that body until 1870 and again from 1872-184. He was considered the political boss of Leon County during the Reconstruction Era."

A friend and rival of Arthur O'Neill, Fanning performed at the Granard Harp Festivals of 1781, 82 and 83, each time winning first prize. He accomplished the same feat at Belfast in 1792. Captain Francis O'Neill said of him: \"Charles Fanning preferred Ulster to his native province, and although certain important episodes in his life happened at Tyrone, his chief haunts were in the County of Cavan. The mistake of his life was marrying the kitchen maid of one of his early patrons, a Mrs. Baillie who was a good performer on the harp herself, and who had entertained him at her table, and introduced him to genteel company. The result is well expressed in the concise language of Bunting: “He was also patronized by the celebrated Earl of Bristol, the great Bishop of Derry; but in consequence of having married a person in low life and corresponding habits, he never attained to respectability or independence.\""

She served as the Governor of Easter Island (Rapa Nui) in the government of president Sebastián Piñera, between 2010 and 2014. A native of the island, Cardinali hasworked as a professor in Santiago and also in Easter Island's tourism industry. Cardinali's predecessor, former Governor Pedro Edmunds Paoa, resigned in early August 2010 following the occupation of six buildings by protesters who demanded the return of land to the descendents of the island's indigenous Polynesian inhabitants. Lawyer Jorge Miranda was appointed as interim Governor until a replacement could be found. Chilean deputy Interior Minister Rodrigo Ubilla appointed Carmen Cardinali as Governor of Easter Island in early September 2010 to replace Edmunds. Cardinali's challenges included archeological preservation of the island's heritage and revamping the tourist industry. She served as a Governor until March 2014, being replaced by Marta Raquel Hotus Tuki, appointed by president Michelle Bachelet."

  "text" : "Celina Seghi (born March 6, 1920) is a former Italian alpine skier. Born in Abetone, Tuscany, she was the youngest child in a family of nine and earned her first Italian championship medal, a bronze in the slalom, in 1934. In 1937 she earned three national titles, her first victories at that level, by winning the slalom, downhill, and combined events. In total she won a total of 25 gold, 6 silver, and 3 bronze medals at the Italian National Championships: gold seven times, silver thrice, and bronze twice in the downhill, gold and silver once each in the giant slalom, gold ten times, silver twice, and bronze once in the slalom, and gold seven times in the combined. On the international level Seghi won gold in the slalom and silver in the combined event at the 1941 FIS Alpine World Ski Championships, but the results of the tournament were nullified by the International Ski Federation due to the limited participation from only German-friendly nations. She resumed skiing after World War II and next appeared at the 1948 Winter Olympics, where she finished fourth in both the women's downhill and combined, and joint-fourteenth (with Laila Schou Nilsen) in the slalom. In 1950 she captured her only recognized World Championship medal, bronze in the women's slalom, and two years later participated in the 1952 Winter Olympics, finishing fourth in the women's slalom, seventh in the giant slalom, and joint-fifteenth (with Silvia Glatthard) in the downhill. She retired from active competition in 1956, shortly before the 1956 Winter Olympics, married a surgeon in 1970, and moved to Pistoia, where she continued to ski into her 90s."

  "text" : "Colin Roberts CVO (born 31 July 1959) is a British diplomat and the current Governor of the Falkland Islands. He was educated at Winchester College and King's College, Cambridge. He previously served as British Ambassador to Lithuania, from 2004 to 2008, Commissioner of the British Indian Ocean Territory and the British Antarctic Territory from 2008 to 2012 and Director of the FCO Eastern Europe and Central Asia Directorate from 2012 to 2014. Roberts also held diplomatic service posts in Japan and France. In April 2010, Roberts, acting on the instructions of David Miliband—established a marine nature reserve around the Chagos Islands known as the Chagos Marine Protected Area. The designation proved controversial as the decision was announced during a period when the UK Parliament was in recess. On 1 December 2010 a leaked US Embassy London diplomatic cable dating back to 2009 exposed British and US calculations in creating the marine nature reserve. The cable relays exchanges between US Political Counselor Richard Mills and British Director of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office Colin Roberts, in which Roberts \"asserted that establishing a marine park would, in effect, put paid to resettlement claims of the archipelago's former residents.\" Richard Mills concludes: Establishing a marine reserve might, indeed, as the FCO's Roberts stated, be the most effective long-term way to prevent any of the Chagos Islands' former inhabitants or their descendants from resettling in the [British Indian Ocean Territory]. In 2013 it was announced that Roberts had been appointed Governor of the Falkland Islands and Commissioner for South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands, to take up office in April 2014. Alicia Castro, Argentina's ambassador to the United Kingdom, criticised Roberts's appointment as a \"provocation\" and said he was \"not the person to encourage dialogue between nations\"."

  "text" : "Chhaganlal Karamshi Parekh popularly known as Chhagan Bapa (27 June 1894 – 14 December 1968) was a noted philanthropist, social worker, who worked for up-liftment of poor, education and social reform of women. He was born in 1894 at Rajkot in Gujarat in a Gujarati Vaishnava family of Lohana caste. In his young age he started his career as a clerk at R. A. Mucadam & Sons' Chanda colliery in Jharia. Later in 1914 he joined Lower & Upper Jharia Collieries located at Tisra, which were owned by Kutchi owners Gangji Dossa Jethwa & Khimji Dossa Jethwa. The owners were very much impressed with his work and promoted him. From here he progressed to start his own coal supply firm. He was among the committee members of historic All India Trade Union Congress meeting hosted at Jharia in year 1928 and shared dais with other notable colliery owners like, Ramjush Agarwalla, the host and others like, D. D. Thacker, Karamshi Khora and other dignitories. But in the year 1949, there was change in his life. He took retirement from his work and dedicated his life towards social service. He got inspiration for social work from Thakkar Bapa and became a member of Servants of India Society and served in relief works in Himachal Pradesh, Assam and earthquake relief works in Kutch. After, leaving Jharia in 1949, he spent almost a decade in Calcutta where he already had a house and offices for coal supply business. Here, he helped founding Laxminarayan Temple & Dharamshala and Laxminarayan Trust Hospital at Bhowanipore, both the establishments were funded by Gujarati diaspora of Calcutta, which included a handsome donation by him. However, he later dedicated his whole life in social works and later shifted to Bombay, where he died in 1968. During the earthquake of 1956 in Kutch, he worked relentlessly for the relief work, collecting funds and doing other humanitarian services. In course of his works he was also responsible for laying foundation of Anjar General Hospital and the first only girls school of Anjar known as K.K.M.S. Girls High School for which he was able to generate a munificent donation from Khatau family and Smt. Maniben Khatau Sethia. At Bombay, he was inspiration behind starting of Lijjat Papad in 1959, which is a noted women's cooperative based at Mumbai. He was also one of the founding member of Gujarati Dharamshala at Haridwar. The Government of India issued a postage stamp in his honor in 1999. The Laxminarayan Temple at Kolkata, have named the Hall in name of Chhagan Bapa as a memrorial to him."

  "text" : "Christian Hansen (November 8, 1869 - August 15, 1941), commonly known as C. X. Hansen, was an American educator and historian in the Lutheran church. He was integral to the formation of the Danish Evangelical Lutheran Church in North America (the North Church) and the United Danish Evangelical Lutheran Church (United Church). C. X. Hansen and Peter Sørensen Vig led the United Church to establish an educational system as a fulfilment of one of its top priorities. Elk Horn Højskole in Elk Horn, Iowa, had been founded in 1878 as the first Danish folk school in America. In 1894, Pastor Kristian Anker, then owner and principal of the Elk Horn Højskole, sold it to the newly formed Danish Evangelical Lutheran Church in North America for use as a seminary and college. Dana College in Blair, Nebraska, was begun as a preparatory school. When the North Church merged with the Blair Church in 1896, the seminary was consolidated with Trinity Seminary in Blair, Nebraska.[1]"

  "text" : "Chris Burkard (born March 12, 1986 in San Luis Obispo, California) is an American self-taught photographer and artist, based in California Central Coast region. Burkard’s work is layered by landscape, lifestyle, surf, outdoor and travel subjects. Burkard takes a photojournalistic approach to conceptualize large-scale editorial projects that extend across multiple mediums, formulated for digital and print content platforms. The use of natural lighting techniques is prevalent throughout Burkard’s work as well as capturing humanizing moments in both cultural and natural landscapes. Burkard gravitates towards and leads assignments to colder places. This contrasts the idea of surfing as a sun-drenched, beach-blonde experience. Burkard has led trips to some of the coldest regions of the globe. In addition to hunting down perfect waves in some of the harshest conditions in the world, Burkard has shot, both personally and commercially, on six of the seven continents. His travels have included over 21 trips to Iceland, as well as trips to Norway, the Faroe Islands, India, Cuba, New Zealand, Russia, Switzerland, and Italy."

This was an Irish peerage and did not entitle him to a seat in the English House of Lords (although it did entitle him to a seat in the Irish House of Lords). In 1687 he was appointed Lord-Lieutenant of the North Riding of Yorkshire. A Roman Catholic, he actively canvassed the local gentry in the cause of James II. He was suspicious, as he told Sir John Reresby, of the activities of the Earls of Danby and Devonshire in Yorkshire, saying \"it could be for no good end that [they] were come down to the country\"; and indeed they were plotting the Glorious Revolution. As the gentry of Yorkshire refused to served under a Catholic, he and the other Yorkshire lieutenants were replaced by the Protestant Duke of Newcastle in October 1688. Lord Fairfax of Emley married Abigail Yate, daughter of Sir John Yate, 2nd Baronet. Their daughter, the Honourable Alathea Fairfax, married William Widdrington, 3rd Baron Widdrington, and was the mother of William Widdrington, 4th Baron Widdrington. Lord Fairfax of Emley died in July 1711. He had no sons and was succeeded in the title by his nephew, Charles."

  "text" : "Carl Eugen Guthe ( June 1, 1893 – July 24, 1974) was an American academic and anthropologist, son of Karl Eugen Guthe, Professor of Physics and Dean of the Graduate Department of the University of Michigan, and Clara Belle née Ware of Grand Rapids, Mich. Guthe married Grace Ethel (née McDonald) 12 September 1916 in Wayne, MI and they had three sons: Karl Frederick, Alfred Kidder, and James. Karl Frederick Guthe (1919–1994) was professor emeritus of biological sciences at the University of Michigan. Alfred Kidder Guthe (1920–1983) specialised in the archaeology of the US eastern seaboard, and became director of the Frank H. McClung museum at U Tennessee. Guthe graduated from the University of Michigan in 1914. He went on to receive two degrees in anthropology from Harvard University – an M.A. in 1915 and a Ph.D. in 1917. Guthe assisted Alfred Kidder with his excavations at Pecos, New Mexico: their efforts to ship the skeletons found there to the Peabody Museum at Harvard resulted in their being suspected of espionage. He became the first anthropologist hired at the University of Michigan, the first chair of anthropology there, and the first director of the school's new Museum of Anthropology in 1928. He also headed an archaeological expedition to the Philippines, which was used to supply exhibits to the museum. He left the university in 1944 to take up the appointment as director of the New York State Museum. He created the Society for American Archaeology and began publishing the American Antiquity journal."

He was honorary professor of poetry at the Manchester Royal Institution, and in 1856 was granted a civil list pension. His friends included Robert Southey. Swain's epitaph for John Horsefield is noted by English Heritage as an element of their rationale for listing Horsefield's tomb as a Grade II monument. Charles Swain was born to an English father and French mother in Every Street, Manchester, England, on 4 January 1801, He received an education and began work when aged 15 as a clerk for Tavaré and Horrocks, a dye-works that was part-owned by a maternal uncle. He married Ann Glover in January 1827 and the couple went on to have five daughters and a son, of which four daughters lived to become adults. Swain left his job at the dye-works after fourteen years to become a bookseller. That venture did not last and two years later he joined Lockett & Co., a firm of engravers and lithographers in Manchester. He had artistic interests – as indicated by his memoir of Henry Liverseege, the Mancunian artist, and books such as A Cabinet of Poetry and Romance: Female Portraits from the Writings of Byron and Scott (1845) – and he went on to buy the engraving department from the firm and to run it himself. By the time the bookselling venture ended, Swain was already friends with Robert Southey and with other literary names. His poems had been published in journals from 1822 onwards and he had also had various more substantial works published, such as Metrical Essays on Subjects of History and Imagination (1827), Beauties of the Mind: a Poetical Sketch with Lays Historical and Romantic (1831) and The Mind (1832). Swain died on 22 September 1874 as the result of an epileptic fit. He had been living at Prestwich Park, Prestwich, at the time, in a house bought for him by friends. His wife died four years later."

He fought out of Stockton at a weight of between 148 and 156 lbs. during his career, which would classify him as a middleweight by modern reckoning as well as by the standards of the time. Boxing historian Nat Fleischer claimed that Turner, whom he called a \"great two-fisted fighter, as fearless as they come\", won 90% percent of the bouts in which he fought. The Stockton Cyclone frequently took on boxers who outweighed him by as much as 20 lbs. His brother Rufe Turner also was a boxer."

In 1815, he was appointed lieutenant in the Vesterlenske Regiment. He headed Trondhjems Ingeniørdetachement from 1845 until his retirement in 1870. As an engineer officer, Roosen was engaged with surveying. In 1824, he published his first topographical map of Norway. His cartographic works led to the publication of several maps that addressed Norway's geography. Skiing also caught his interest. In 1865, he published the book Om Skiløbningen, on the skill of skiing. Roosen was also interested in Norwegian history and he was particularly concerned with Nidaros Cathedral in Trondheim. In 1849, he married Camilla Marie Thrane (1813-1897), daughter of a merchant banker David Thrane (1781-1832) and Helene Sophie Bull (1780-1831). Through his marriage, he became a brother-in-law of Marcus Thrane."

He was a descendant of the prominent Tornikios clan, of Armenian or Georgian origin. His father, Demetrios Tornikios, was a prominent official who rose to become logothetes tou dromou (Postal Logothete, in effect foreign minister), a post he continuously occupied from circa 1191 until his death. Constantine is first mentioned as being involved in the riots that broke out in the imperial capital, Constantinople, in late 1198 or 1199. Originally, the mob protested against the crimes of the head of the capital's prison (the praetorium), John Lagos, but soon it turned into a full-scale rebellion against Alexios III, which had to be bloodily suppressed. At the time, Constantine was Eparch (governor) of the capital. In 1200 or 1201, after his father's death, Constantine succeeded him as logothetes tou dromou for a couple of years, being replaced by Niketas Choniates. Constantine's own son, also named Demetrios, became mesazon (chief minister) in the Empire of Nicaea, and his grandson Constantine was named to the high rank of sebastokrator."

  "text" : "Christoffel Cornelius Froneman, commonly known as Stoffel Froneman (Leliehoek, Winburg 26 March 1846 - Cypress District Marquard 12 March 1913), was Veldkornet, General and Vice-Commander-in-Chief of the Orange Free State Boer forces during the Anglo-Boer War of 1899-1902. He took part in both the Basotho War between the Orange Free State and the Basathos from King Mosjwesjwe and the Anglo-Boer War and he distinguished himself to such an extend that his promotions followed each other in quick succession. At the outbreak of the war he was Commandant of the Ladybrand Commando. In early February 1900, together with Generaal de Wet, he took part in the Battle of Koedoesberg, west of the Boer positions at Magersfontein. When later that month General Piet Cronjé surrendered at Paardeberg, Froneman, with the help of General De Wet, managed to escape and was promoted to General. Near Sannapos and the Battle near Brandwaterkom he really excelled. Near Pompje he raided a train and all over the region he caused havoc for the British and inflicted great damage. By 1901 he was the Vice-Commander-In-Chief for the entire Eastern Orange Free State. Froneman fought until the end of the Anglo-Boer War and took part in the Peace Treaty negotiations in Vereeniging, where he voted for peace. On June 11 General Froneman and about 800 Boer commandos surrendered near Winburg to General Elliott. Nearly every one handed in a rifle with bandoliers, but, like other commandos which had come in, they spent nearly all their ammunition in game-shooting since peace was declared. The Boer Generals and the Commandants and Field Cornets were allowed to retain their private rifles."

She was called \"The Queen of Tiveden\". Constantia Eriksdotter and her sister Virginia were removed from their mother's custody when she married in 1561. This was illegal, as according to the law the mother had sole custody until the children reached the age of three. They were placed first in the court of Princess Cecilia of Sweden, then that of Princess Elizabeth of Sweden (1564), and finally that of queen Karin Månsdotter. In 1573, she visited her deposed father in prison, and was possibly the last family member to see him alive. On 13 January 1594, she married the English nobleman Henry Frankelin, courtier to her uncle Charles IX of Sweden. The same year, she was awarded nine estates in Väne parish in Bohuslän by her cousin king Sigismund III Vasa. In 1595, she was further granted Bocksjö Manor in Tiveden in Västergötland, where she chose to reside. As a widow after 1610, she mainly lived at Odenfors Manor outside Vreta. Like her father, Eric XIV, Constantia was described as mentally fragile. In the Undenäs church, a moonstone belonging to Constantia is still kept.
