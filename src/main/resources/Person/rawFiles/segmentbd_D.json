  "text" : "David Dunbar (fl. 1728–1737) was a British military officer, a surveyor of the King's woods in North America, and lieutenant governor of the Province of New Hampshire. Of Scotch-Irish origin, Dunbar married into a wealthy and politically influential family, and received his first North American appointment, that of Surveyor of the King's Woods, in 1728, through the influence of his family connections and that of Martin Bladen, a member of the Board of Trade. In this position he made numerous local enemies in his enforcement of regulations governing the cutting of trees that could be used as ship masts. He was the leader of an attempt to establish a colony named \"Georgia\" in what is now the central coast of Maine, and was in 1730 commissioned as lieutenant governor of the Province of New Hampshire in an attempt to strengthen his authority. He engaged in frequent disputes with New Hampshire's Governor Jonathan Belcher. He established Fort Frederick in Maine."

He and several cousins were charged with assaulting an FBI agent outside a Catholic church in Brooklyn. A requiem mass was being conducted at that time for Carmine Lombardozzi, a crime family figure and Marino's uncle. On April 20, 1993, Marino was indicted with others on conspiracy to murder charges. The victim was Thomas Spinelli, who was planning to testify before a grand jury on Cosa Nostra control of the private trash hauling industry in New York City. In 2010 Marino pleaded guilty to a conspiracy charge for approving the murder of informant Frank Hydell (Marino's nephew on his wife's side). The Gambino family suspected that Hydell had become a government informant and requested permission from Marino, then in prison, to kill Hydell. Marino was sentenced to five years imprisonment in 2011. He was released from prison on August 27, 2014. In 1995 Anthony Casso, a Lucchese underboss who turned states evidence, identified Marino as a co-conspirator in a failed assassination attempt on Gambino boss John Gotti."

He was appointed on 19 March 2012 by President Joachim Gauck. He is a member of the Social Democratic Party of Germany. He grew up in East Germany, where he initially studied theology, the only subject he was allowed to study. After the German reunification, he worked for the Federal Commissioner for the Stasi Records and became a close aide of Joachim Gauck, serving as his press secretary. In 1991, he was one of six individuals, one of them also being Gauck, who were awarded the Theodor Heuss medal by the Theodor Heuss Foundation, on behalf of the peaceful protesters of 1989 in then-East Germany. In 1992, he left the Federal Commissioner's office to study law, and earned an LL.M. at the University of Pennsylvania in 1998. In 2000, he passed the second state examination, qualifying as a lawyer. He then worked as an adviser to the Federal Ministry of the Interior. From 2004, he worked for the Evangelical Church in Germany. Following Gauck's nomination for President of Germany, Gill became head of his transition team and the designated head of the Bundespräsidialamt. He is married to Sheila Gill, an American. They have two daughters."

Herskovits Library of African Studies, Northwestern University, and several books and articles about linguistics, libraries and librarianship, including Responsible Librarianship: Library Policies for Unreliable Systems published in 2008. In his writings on libraries, Bade’s research focus has been on the “processes of misunderstanding, mystifying and mythologizing technologies and how this allows a technocratic elite to turn convivial tools into tools for control and exploitation.” He has written extensively about cataloging, bibliographic control, authority control, and misinformation, drawing upon the literatures of philosophy, linguistics, rhetoric, ergonomics and resilience engineering in making his arguments.

Born Denham Jephson, he was the grandson of William Jephson and the great-grandson of Anthony Jephson, who both represented Mallow in the Irish House of Commons. He was a descendant of Sir John Jephson, husband of Elizabeth Norreys, niece of Sir John Norreys, Lord President of Munster, who was granted Mallow Castle following the Desmond Rebellion. He was returned to the British House of Commons for Mallow in 1826, a seat he held until 1832. He was re-elected in 1833, when the incumbent, William Daunt, was unseated on petition. In July 1838 he was created a baronet, of Mallow in the County of Cork. Later that month he assumed by Royal licence the additional surname of Norreys. He continued to represent Mallow in Parliament until 1859. Jephson-Norreys married Catherine Cecilia Jane Franks, daughter of William Franks and sister of Sir Thomas Harte Franks, in 1821. They lived at Mallow Castle, County Cork. Lady Jephson-Norreys died in December 1853. Jephson-Norreys died in July 1888, aged 88. He had no surviving sons and the baronetcy died with him."

In addition to his primary performer role as guitarist and backing vocalist of Miles Nielsen and The Rusted Hearts, he records and plays with Bun E. Carlos (of Cheap Trick) in The Monday Night Band, which performs exclusively on Monday nights. On April 2, 2012, Rockford, Illinois, Mayor Larry Morrissey declared April 2012 Dan Lindsay, Dan McMahon, and Miles Nielsen month in the City of Rockford for their work on Undefeated. Also in 2012, he received the Outstanding Achievement Award from the Rockford Area Music Industry (RAMI) organization and scored the 12 minute-long short film that helped the Rockford Park District win the 2012 National Gold Medal Award for Excellence in Park and Recreation from the National Recreation and Park Association (NRPA). He owns and co-operates The Midwest Sound, a farm-house recording studio on the outskirts of Rockford, Illinois, and a two-time RAMI Award winner (2013 and 2014) for Best Recording Studio."

D. C. Lau studied Chinese under Prof. Xu Dishan at the University of Hong Kong, but fled to Mainland China in 1941 just before the Japanese occupied Hong Kong. In 1946, he was offered one of the first scholarships for a British university and studied Western philosophy in Glasgow University (1946–49). In 1950, Lau would take up a post at London University's School of Oriental and African Studies, developing SOAS into a world-renowned centre for the study of Chinese philosophy. He was appointed in 1965 to the newly created Readership in Chinese Philosophy and in 1970 became Professor of Chinese in the University of London. In 1978 he returned to Hong Kong to take up the Chair of Chinese Language and Literature at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. On his retirement in 1989, he began to computerise the entire body of extant ancient Chinese works, with a series of sixty concordances."

He graduated in film direction from the Centro Sperimentale di Cinematografia in Rome with the film Unexpected (Inatteso), a documentary on the demand for political asylum in Italy, which was screened at the Festival dei Popoli in Florence and at the Berlinale, within the section \"Forum\" in 2006. In 2008, he won the national prize Premio Solinas for the screenplay of the feature film When elephants fight (Quando gli elefanti combattono), written in collaboration with Filippo Gravino and Guido Iuculano. In 2009, he joined the production company Sciara, where he works as director and producer. In 2011, he directed two documentaries for RAI 3, the Italian cultural public channel: Urban extremes - Jerusalem (Estremi urbani, Gerusalemme), on the territorial conflict in Jerusalem and Romany imaginary - Minority artists (Immaginario Rom - Artisti Contro), on Romany art in Hungary. Distilo's works generally focus on social issues, with a special interest in various forms of contemporary art. In his movie Deep time (Margini di sottosuolo) (2012), he explored the boundaries between documentary and fiction with a story on archeology and the feelings that bound people to their past. In the documentary Igort, the secret landscape (2013), Distilo tells the story of the research and work of Igort, an Italian comics artist and illustrator, for its trilogy on Soviet Union and the evolution of the artist's relationship with storytelling by image."

Since the starting of the campaign Daniel has received thousands of submissions from dozens of countries across 4 continents. The campaign is worldwide and anyone can request a sticker package through his website to participate. The best submissions from each year are compiled into photo books produced and independently released through DENIAL Art. DENIAL creates much of his artwork through the use of intricate stencils and spray paint on wood panels. Additionally he creates site specific installations across Canada and the USA thus far, using various medias including stencils, wheat paste and traditional graffiti techniques. In 2011 DENIAL began working with Gallery 323 to create limited edition panels of his street art which were distributed through several galleries across Canada and the United States as well as being featured on popular time-released art website. DENIAL has thus far released 7 limited editions through 2012. In 2011 DENIAL worked with Deadboy on anti Rob Ford graffiti which was featured in Now Magazine as well as touring across Canada from Ontario to Vancouver with the One of a Kind Show]."

  "text" : "Rebecca Coriam (born 11 March 1987) is a British crewmember who disappeared from the cruise ship Disney Wonder off the Pacific coast of Mexico on the morning of 22 March 2011. She was last seen in the crew lounge, where a security camera recorded her during a phone conversation that appeared to be causing her some emotional difficulty. Her disappearance was the first such incident in the history of Disney Cruise Lines. The case remains under investigation, and her whereabouts since the phone conversation have not been established. While some of the crew who sailed on that ship believe that she went overboard, there is evidence that suggests she may be alive. Her parents have been critical of Disney's handling of the investigation, believing the company knows more than it claims to and has been more interested in avoiding unfavourable publicity than solving the case. In early 2013 they indicated they would sue Disney in an American court. The Coriams have been joined by British government officials, who have instituted policies allowing for more comprehensive investigations of such incidents in the future, and advocates for the relatives of many other crew and passengers who have been reported missing from cruise ships over the last decade. There are claims the company has more extensive evidence than it has so far admitted, and accusations of a coverup."

He afterwards removed to Christ Church, Oxford, where, on 9 February 1600, he took the degree of B.A. A few years later he settled in the Low Countries, and in 1617, when he was residing in Utrecht, he translated from the Dutch – but it cannot now be traced from what original – a piece which he published in London in 1618, 'Hans Beer Pot, his Invisible Comedy of See me and See me not,' which was stated to have been 'acted in the Low Countries by an honest company of Health Drinkers,' This play was anonymous, and was attributed to Thomas Nash by Phillips and Winstanley. The author admits that it is neither tragedy nor comedy, but a plain conference of three persons, divided into three acts. Belchier was the author of various other poems and translations, but none of them appear to have been printed. He presented to Corpus Christi College a silver cup with the family arms upon it, 'Paly of 6 or, and gul, a chief vaire.' He hanged himself at Utrecht in 1621."

  "text" : "Diego de Pesquera was a 16th-century Spanish sculptor of the Sevillian and Granadan schools. Records show he was active in the city of Granada in 1563, and in Seville from 1571 to 1580. With a style influenced by the Italian Renaissance and that of Michelangelo, he may have trained in Italy. For Granada, he worked on the gate of the Sala Capitular at the cathedral and in 1567 at the church of San Pedro - he also produced the altarpieces at Colomera and Ogíjares. One of his most important works from that period was the group of Saint Anne, the Virgin Mary and the Christ Child in Granada Cathedral. For the Capilla Real (royal chapel) of Seville Cathedral, he produced sculptures of Saint Justa and Saint Rufina. His reliefs for the chapter-house anteroom at Seville Cathedral also survive from this, his final period. He also worked on non-sacred themes, in 1574 producing sculptures of Julius Caesar and Hercules for La Alameda. Another work on this theme was his Flight of Mercury on the Plaza de San Francisco in Seville."

With a high level of economic development, equality would no longer entail sharing poverty and lengthy toil, the main reason for classes and inequality in the past. These views are expounded in his book Bright Future: Abundance and Progress in the 21st Century."

When new constituencies had been introduced, he ran in 1906 in Nedenes as one of eight candidates. He finished fifth in the first round with 119 votes, behind Ivar Fløistad, Finn Blakstad, Aslak Kateraas and Lars Olsen Skjulestad. In the second round he ran as the running mate of Fløistad, but they lost to the duo Blakstad/Kateraas. In the 1912 election Vigeland ran as the Liberal candidate in a much smaller field. He managed to carry the districts Gjøvdal and Lille Topdal in the first round, but fared worse in the more urbanized districts and finished third in both rounds."

Gee mostly painted battle scenes, landscapes as well as pictures inspired by local legends such as Lady Godiva. He was active as a painter between the years of 1815 and 1868. He died in 1871 or 1872. In 1831, Gee began restoration work on the Holy Trinity Doom, an early 15th-century painting of the Last Judgment. He received five guineas for his work.There is little contemporary information about Gee's work on the Doom, but conservation work begun in 1995 suggests he added outlines to the figures and repainted or recoloured some areas.There is no evidence that Gee significantly changed the painting's composition or symbolism.Gee also applied a coating of megilp to the painting. This bituminous varnish soon degraded and by 1873 the Doom was 'almost invisible'."

  "text" : "Dharma Pala (1035-1060) was ruler of Pala Dynasty (900–1100) of Kamarupa Kingdom. Harsha Pala's son, named Dharma Pala, left three copper plates: 1. Khonamukh Plates 2. Subhankarapataka Grant 3. Pushpabhadra Plates The first and second charters were composed by the same poet since they are couched in similar language and were issued by Dharma Pala (resplendent in the grandiosity and pomposity of usual titles). The Khonamukh charter was issued in the first year of his reign. The donee was Bhatta Mahabahu who was son of Vishnu and grandson of Ummoka and sprang from a Brahmin family, belonging to the Kashyapa gotra and the Kanva sakha of the Yajurveda and hailing from Madhya Desa. The charter at serial 2 was issued in the third regnal year. The donee hails from village Krodanja in Sravasti, famous for its learned Brahmins. The said village has been identified with Karanja in Dinajpur district of Bangladesh. The name of Krodanja is elsewhere found as Krodanchi and Kolanchi, which was centre of learned Brahmins in the Kanauj region of UP and the Brahmins of this place, who settled in north Bengal appears to have given the name of their old habitation to their new habitat as in the cases of Sravasti and Tarkari. The introduction of the first two Prasati is exception in the sense that it has the name of its composer, Prasthanakalsa, unlike the earlier inscription in Assam, excepting the Gachtal copper plate inscription of Gopala, composed by Balabhadra. The mention of Dharmapala as \"flourishing in a city called Kamarupanagar\" in Aniruddha's Prasati has created controversy, for the capital of Brahma Pala line is named Hadappaka in some records and Durjaya in others. It is also accepted that Ratna Pala transferred his capital to Durjaya and Gopala restored it to Hadappaka. It is thus difficult to determine if Kamarupanagar is same as Hadappaka or it is different and new city altogether. Bhattacharya (1933) thinks that Dharmapala's capital has to be identified with the city that later was known as Kamatapur on the Dharla, a tributary of the Brahmaputra. Since the ruins of Kamatapur lie 14 miles south-west of Cooch Behar and 40 miles from Dhubri on the Brahmaputra, observations of Bhattacharya lacks credence, more so because of the evidence later revealed by the Gachtal plates. Some other related facts need attention. In 1809, Buchanan Hamilton spoke of the ruins of Dharma Pala's city near Dimla in Rangpur district of Bangladesh, about 2 miles from the Tista and regarded the King as belonging to Pala Dynasty of Kamarupa. There is a belief that Dharmapala did build a city in the western fringe of his domain. There is no satisfactory evidence to identify Dharma Pala's capital Kamarupanagar with Kamatapur, particularly as the two names have no resemblance. But tradition associated Dharma Pala not with Kamatapur but with a city about 35 miles away."

  "text" : "Dallin Dixon Oaks is a linguistics professor at Brigham Young University (BYU). He specializes in English linguistics and is perhaps best known for his work in structural ambiguity. Oaks earned a BA in English teaching from BYU in 1984. From 1985 to 1987 he was a teacher of English as a second language at Kaysville Junior High School and Davis High School in Davis County, Utah. At the same time he earned an MA from the University of Utah. He then continued his studies to earn a Ph.D. from Purdue University with a specialty in English Linguistics. He is the author of three books: Linguistics at Work: A Reader of Applications, An Introductory English Grammar 5th edition (updating Norman C. Stageberg's earlier work and serving as co-author), and Structural Ambiguity in English: An Applied Grammatical Inventory (2 vols.).  Oaks has done much of his research in the area of structural ambiguity. His two-volume book on structural ambiguity shows how an understanding of the grammatical features of the English language can be helpful in generating structural word plays that are found in advertising and humor. In fact, in 2015 he with others co-founded PhraseWorthy LLC, which has produced an online software that helps people in such fields as advertising and marketing to brainstorm clever word plays. His book on ambiguity fits within a larger research framework that explores applications of linguistics. In addition to his books, he has published articles in a variety of journals, including General Linguistics, Southern Journal of Linguistics, the Journal of Technical Writing and Communication, Reading Research and Instruction, IEEE Transactions on Professional Communication, Humor: International Journal of Humor Research, and Journal of Advertising Education. His professional activities have included some previous service as a reviewer for the National Endowment for the Humanities (Fellowships Panel), which judged fellowship proposals in Language, Linguistics, Rhetoric, and Communication. He has also been a featured guest on radio shows for his research, including Grok's Science Show (originating from WHPK---a University of Chicago affiliated station) and Okham's Razor (Australian National Radio). Oaks is a son of Dallin H. Oaks. Oaks is a Latter-day Saint."

  "text" : "David James Lewer (Swanage, Dorset, 1920-2005) was an English author, architect, historian and choral musician. Born in 1920 to parents James William Lewer and Emily (née Brown), David was the younger of two siblings. His sister Phillis was born in 1917, but died in 1950. Lewer became a chorister at the Temple Church, London in 1931, remaining in the choir until 1933. Unlike most Temple choristers, he had already begun at City of London School before being accepted into the choir, and after his voice broke in 1933, he remained connected with the church for much of his life, initially as Honorary Librarian and a member of the Templars Union, the association of old choristers. Later, he joined the gentlemen of the choir as a Tenor, and remained a regular member of the choir until at least 1982 and the retirement of 'The Doctor', Sir George Thalben-Ball. He remained an occasional member for several years after this. Following his retirement to Dorset, he was an active participent in the choir of St George's Church, Langton Matravers. After qualifying as an architect, Lewer spent his career in architectural practise. Even after his retirement, he continued to work, designing and project managing the building of his final residence, Quality Court in Langton Matravers, Dorset, which was built partially in the garden of his previous residence, Old Forge Cottage. Starting after the Second World War, Lewer also began to write factual books and pamphlets on a variety of subjects, but specialising in his two great loves: Swanage and its history, and the Temple Church. His most famous work, 'A Spiritual Song', is a comprehensive history of the Temple Church choir, and was published by the Templar's Union, the association of ex-choristers, and was conceived particularly as a memorial to Alfred Capel Dixon: he was granted access to the historical records of two of the Inns of Court, the Inner Temple and the Middle Temple by then sub-treasurer of the Inner Temple, Commander Rodney Flynn . It is notable for containing the complete list of choristers from the foundation of the current choir model under Edward John Hopkins in 1842 up until the date of publication: a list which was updated in subsequent reprints."

He taught in the schools in New Brunswick from 1872 to 1882, and was Superintendent of Schools in Portland, New Brunswick (now the north end of Saint John) from 1880 to 1882. Instead of practicing law, however, McIntyre moved west to Manitoba in 1883 to accept an appointment as principal of Carlton School. In 1885, he was appointed superintendent of schools, a position he held for 43 years. McIntyre was also the first president of the Children's Aid Society in Winnipeg. He developed the Winnipeg school board's curriculum and philosophy and was recognised with a Doctor of Laws degree in 1912 from the University of Manitoba. In 1935, he was awarded an Order of the British Empire. He felt that \"success in education came not from repression and torture but from the encouragement and happiness of the child\" and that the development of the child is more important than the curriculum. Winnipeg's Daniel McIntyre Ward and Daniel McIntyre Collegiate Institute are named after him."

And since my advanced age does not allow me a way of dynamically reacting (although if a fellow Greek were to grab a Kalashnikov, I would be right behind him), I see no other solution than this dignified end to my life, so I don’t find myself fishing through garbage cans for my sustenance. I believe that young people with no future, will one day take up arms and hang the traitors of this country at Syntagma square, just like the Italians did to Mussolini in 1945″"

  "text" : "Rabbi David Elimelech Tzanger (born Nowy Sacz, Poland 1880-1962) was a religious figure and Hasidic personality in his native Poland, Canada and Israel. Tzanger was born to parents Isaac Pinchus and Hinda Rechel Tzanger (née Kirshbaum), who were followers of the Tsanz Hasidic sect. He was a disciple of the first Bobover Rebbe - Reb Shlomo Halberstam. He was originally trained as a ritual slaughterer, however due to his extreme piety and knowledge of Jewish law he was crowned the Krakower (Crakow) Rebbe by the then Bobover Rebbe Ben Zion Halberstam. This was a prestigious position as the city of Cracow was a major centre of Hasidic Judaism. The Krakower Rebbe was then sent to Canada to lead the Hasidic community there and finally to Israel where he led a community of hasidic Jews in Tel Aviv. The Krakower rebbe was buried on the Har Hamenuchot in recognition of his contribution to Judaism."

  "text" : "Richard Wynn Keene (9 December 1809 – 28 November 1887) is mainly remembered today under his theatrical name of Dykwynkyn. Keene was a Victorian designer of costumes, props, mechanical effects and scenery for plays and pantomimes on the London stage, with a strong sense of wit and a special feeling for animals. He contributed some notable props for the first cycle of Wagner's Ring at Bayreuth. He was also an artist and in his earlier career a manufacturer and inventor of building materials. Keene's cement, a type of hard plaster for internal use, perpetuates his name. Keene achieved his theatrical distinction despite being severely or almost totally deaf. Probably for that reason he was never a public figure, and he died in penury."

He was the third, but eldest surviving son of the Count Philip IV (1493-1574) and his first wife, Margaret of East Frisia (1500-1537). Although his parents were Calvinists, Daniel became a Catholic and in 1550, he became canon in Strasbourg. However, he resigned from this position soon afterwards and joined the French army. On 4 April 1567 he was a pallbearer at the funeral of Landgrave Philip I of Hesse. Probably at this funeral, he met Philip's daughter Barbara (1536-1597), the widow of Count George I of Württemberg-Mömpelgard (1498-1558). He married her on 11 November 1568. Their combined coat of arms can still be found in the stair tower of Waldeck Castle. The marriage remained childless.

  "text" : "Dick Perez (born 1940) is an American artist known for his baseball paintings for the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum and the Philadelphia Phillies. He is also known for his paintings for various baseball card series. Perez's book \"The Immortals: An Art Collection of Baseball's Best,\" (published 2010) offers a visual history of the 292 members of the Baseball Hall of Fame. He is a native of San Lorenzo, Puerto Rico. He moved to New York at age six and to Philadelphia at age sixteen where he studied at the Philadelphia College of Art and the University of Pennsylvania. Perez’s art was on exhibit at the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts in Philadelphia in 2004. It was the only one-man show dedicated to sports art at that institution. There is now a permanent exhibit of the 33 paintings (the original 32 plus an additional one of Pat Gillick who was admitted to the Hall of Fame in 2011) in the Hall of Fame section at Citizens Bank Park. He has been the official artist for the Philadelphia Phillies since 1982 and was the official artist for the Major League Hall of Fame for twenty-five years. Starting in 1982, Perez painted a yearly set of cards for the \"Diamond Kings\" series for the Donruss Trading Card Co. The paintings were of baseball's premier players. The paintings were in partnership with Frank and Peggy Steele. (The Perez-Steele Galleries). Perez currently paints for Topps baseball cards. His paintings use acrylics, oils, gouache and watercolors. His artistic influences include such greats as John Singer Sargent, Anders Zorn, Joaquin Sorolla, and Diego Velazquez. His works include other sports and non-sports paintings. Perez painted a portrait of Grover Cleveland Alexander for President Ronald Reagan and a Japanese stickball scene for \" Ichiro Suzuki of the Seattle Mariners. He also painted Arky Vaughan for President Clinton. He was commissioned to paint Robert N. C. Nix, Jr., a former Pennsylvania Supreme Court Chief Justice, for the Pennsylvania Bar Association. He won a national contest in 1976 for the National League official centennial logo and designed the cover for the 1982 World Series. For Perez, baseball has a rich history with multiple facets (offense, defense, running, catching and pitching) and multiple focal points (the stadiums, the uniforms, the equipment and the fans in the stands). He tries to incorporate all of these elements into his paintings."

He has published widely on literature, sacramental culture and ideology in medieval and Renaissance England. He was an undergraduate student at Queens' College, Cambridge and earned his doctorate at University of York. He is a former editor of the Journal of Medieval and Early Modern Studies. His most influential work traces the influence of the Church Fathers in late medieval and early modern poetry and culture to work out questions of politics, gender, and social ethics. Aers taught at the University of East Anglia before going to Duke in the mid-1990s. In 1998 he was awarded the Trinity College Distinguished Teaching Award. In an interview that shortly followed the award, he is quoted as saying, \"My work moves between literature, theology, politics and history. The academic parceling up of these subjects can become an impediment to studying what I want to study, so that's the motive for interdisciplinarity. When I think about ethics, I can't help but think about politics. When I think about my Christianity, I'm also thinking about social justice. The questions I'm asking go directly across what have grown up as disciplinary boundaries within the modern academy.\""

After football he settled in Brampton becoming a teacher (Bramalea Secondary School). He is more affectionately referred to by his students as \"Coach\" or \"Coach C\".

  "text" : "Doreen Southwood (born 1974) is a South African artist, designer, and boutique owner based in Cape Town. She works in a wide variety of media in her artwork, producing sculptures, objects, prints, film, and more, which she often bases on personal experiences and self exploration. Her candidness regarding personal flaws and the cycles of repression and coping that accompany conservative, middle class, Afrikaans upbringing inform much of her work, calling attention to ways in which women are silenced or otherwise repressed in that space. In 2003, Southwood was named the overall winner of the Brett Kebble Art Awards for her painted bronze sculpture, \"The Swimmer.\" The sculpture featured a young woman gazing blankly ahead as she stands on the end of a diving board. For this award, Southwood received R100,000, at that time the largest award for a single artwork in South African history. Her work has been exhibited in Senegal, Cuba, New York, and across South Africa. In 2001 she opened a shop in Cape Town called Mememe, which seeks to make the work of African fashion designers available to the public. Another Mememe shop opened in Johannesburg in 2011. Southwood's own designs have been featured in fashion weeks in Johannesburg and Cape Town  and are known for embodying features of the feminine and nostalgic."

Gaining most of her popularity in the 1970s, with avant-garde work, Maurer has made her art career off of contemporary and modern influenced works that have been shown worldwide. All of her art is based on mathematical, and complex system processes. Most of Maurer's work follows the theme of showing options to the viewer and what the viewer can do with those options. Many of her works break down simple actions so the viewer can really view the piece as movement, not a photograph of movement. Dora Maurer is not only an artist, but she has been a professor at Faculty of Fine Arts in Budapest and a curator."

Muller received his BS in 1947 and his PhD in 1951 in physics from Caltech; an honorary PhD was conferred by the University of Paris in 1989. He was the inventor of the Muller C-element (or Muller C-gate), a device used to implement asynchronous circuitry in electronic computers. He also co-invented the Reed–Muller codes. He discovered the codes, and Irving S. Reed proposed the majority logic decoding for the first time. Furthermore, he invented Muller automata, an automaton model for infinite words."

Hoare, another Dean Close teacher, was manager, and also during which Denys spent a year at Geelong Grammar School, Victoria, on exchange. He was also a very good cricketer and played for Hertfordshire for a number of years. He went to Dean Close School in 1951, appointed by A. N. 'Tony' Gilkes, the then Headmaster, on the personal recommendation of the Vice-Chancellor of Oxford University, to teach Hockey and History, in that order. The Headmaster sought to rebuild the School's previously good Hockey reputation after the problems resulting from World War II. Supported by two very able colleagues, E. S. Hoare, himself a former international, and C. A. P. Tuckwell, formerly West of England, the quality of hockey rose and by 1957 Dean Close School was producing such players as R. I. Ireland, who later captained Cambridge University, Wiltshire and England and who also played for Great Britain, together with W. J. Benton-Evans and F. C. Welles, who were to play for Wales and Scotland respectively. Talented hockey players seemed to flow frequently from the School. It gave Denys much pleasure to discover that, apart from one year, there was continuous Dean Close representation in the Cambridge v. Oxford Universities annual Hockey Match 1957-74. The Hockey XI in 1955, 1957 and 1961 were unbeaten by any other school side. Denys realised that the future of Hockey lay in the use of artificial pitches, and it was he who was behind the fund-raising efforts that eventually resulted in the first artificial pitch in any school in England at Dean Close School. It consisted of 'Redgra' and was opened on 4 March 1961 by a match between a Hockey Association XI and the School XI. The latter won 3-2. Today the pitch, since completely remodelled, is called 'Carnill's' in his honour. When he first arrived, Denys was appointed House Tutor of Walton Court House, and so began the first of 33 years of service to Dean Close School. He was an innovator, founding the Economics and Politics Department and arranging numerous visits and visiting speakers. One former colleague comments: 'Denys was in charge of the Department when I joined Dean Close for my first teaching post as a young man. It was immediately obvious to me what an inspirational figure Denys was. He was highly intelligent, fascinated by Politics and totally involved in the life of Dean Close. Friday evenings were lecture time when Denys would invite guests from political life to talk to our students. It was a time where controversial issues would often be discussed and Denys was marvellously open minded, prepared to listen to viewpoints with which he disagreed. He was a strong advocate of free speech. I could tell when he disagreed with someone because a very serious look would pass across Denys's face. He would then say what he felt. Importantly Denys was a man who saw the shades of grey in difficult issues.' He took over the Social Service Group in the 1960s and developed both it and ties with various homes and institutions such as the Cheshire and Eildon Homes, Nazareth House, Dr Barnado's, Ullenwood, and Betteridge School. He became aware of the need for a wheelchair in 1973 for the Social Service Group, and arranged a special Chapel collection. This led to Denys organizing, with two colleagues, the first School Midsummer Fair. Over the next ten years, the Fair grew into a large annual event, raising thousands of pounds for local charities as well as the Social Service Group. A former colleague wrote: 'Denys had an optimistic cast of mind and it was a joy to hear him walking along a corridor or across a quadrangle singing or humming to himself. He was a man who was happy with himself with a secure loving family life. He had a ready smile and was able to laugh at himself. To give one instance of a story Denys used to tell against himself: in 1979 a new Headmaster was appointed whom Denys, being a senior member of staff, had met. During the summer vacation Denys was walking across Big Field (the playing fields which he loved) and happened to see a large man walking towards him. \"Hello Denys and how are you?\" said the new Headmaster. Denys smiled, said hello and then asked if they had met before.' Denys retired in 1984. He was now able to be with his family more often. He had met and married Pam Clarke in 1961 when she had been the Dean Close Headmaster's Secretary. They were married in the School Chapel by the Headmaster of the day, the Revd Douglas Graham. Denys and Pam had two daughters – Sally, born in 1963 and Elizabeth 'Libby', born in 1965. His new freedom gave Denys time to develop his considerable painting talent. His pictures of landscapes and interesting buildings in Cheltenham and the surrounding area were – and continue to be – much admired, and his work was to be seen on display from time to time in Cheltenham. The same former colleague, himself no mean artist, writes: 'He was inspired by a famous watercolourist called James Fletcher Watson and when I look at Denys's mature work I think Fletcher Watson would have been proud especially of a wonderful series of paintings of local grounds where Gloucestershire played. Denys in turn inspired me, for which I am eternally grateful.' The Old Decanians Society celebrated Denys' 90th Birthday on 11 March 2016 by sending him a 40-page booklet in which Old Decanians and former members of staff had included their greetings and memories of him. He read and understood them all but within three weeks of his Birthday he had died. Three comments in those greetings sum up the man who was Denys Carnill. The first comment was \"…[Denys] has always been the most humble of men despite being one of Britain's most prominent Olympians and undoubtedly one of its Hockey Superstars…\" The second observed: \"…A warm and kind person, incredibly sincere and down to earth…\" The last said 'I loved working with Denys and I found him an inspiration as a person. He was like a second father to me. He had a zest for life which few people have. He often said what a joy it was to work at Dean Close and I'm so grateful that some of that joy came my way.'\""

  "text" : "David Bunevacz (born December 20, 1968) is a Filipino American businessman, model and former decathlete. He is the son of Joseph Bunevacz (Hungarian-American) and Filomena Ismaela (Filipino) in Torrance, California. As a track and field teacher/instructor/coach, Joseph Bunevacz was instrumental in providing his son David with the training and focus needed to compete in the grueling multi-platform decathlon. From 1983 to 1987, David attended Praclete High School in Lancaster, California. David participated in track and field events and began training for the decathlon. He still holds the school's records for high hurdles, high jump and long jump. David also won the Arco Jesse Owens National Track and Field Championship in the high jump. A multifaceted athlete, David trained in a wide variety of track in field sports throughout high school and college, including: \n*  High hurdle \n*  High jump \n*  Long jump \n*  Javelin throw \n*  Shot put \n*  400 metres \n*  Discus throw \n*  Pole vault In 1988 David enrolled at University of California at Los Angeles. During his college years David competed for the Bruins track and field team, eventually becoming team captain. He set the university record for the javelin throw. In 1991, David won the Pac-10 meet. He suffered a spinal injury from weight lifting which required surgery but has had no lasting consequences. David graduated UCLA in 1993 with a degree in Business Management and Sociology. David's strongest events were the throws, in particular the javelin throw. In a class at the Rizal Coliseum, David tossed a javelin from a standing start that was just a few meters short of the prevailing Philippine record. By the age of 21, he had a personal record of 7,316 points for the decathlon. After graduation David was recruited by Philippine Sports Commission Chairman Philip Juico to represent the Philippines in numerous international sporting events including the Southeast Asian Games. Bunevacz agreed to represent his mother's country and began training in earnest. In 1997 David earned a gold medal at the South East Asian Games (SEAG) after the original medalists were disqualified over failed drug tests. He married Fillipino actress, model and author Jessica Rodriguez in October 2000. The family resides in Los Angeles with their three children Hayca, Grant and Breana Bunevacz."

From 1921 to 1942, Graham collected and sent to the Smithsonian Institution nearly 400,000 zoological specimens, including more than 230 new species and 9 new genera, of which 29 were named after him (see ). From 1932 to 1942 he was curator of the Museum of Art, Archeology and Ethnology at the West China Union University, which still stands as part of Sichuan University, in Chengtu. There, he taught comparative religions at the Theological College, and archeology and anthropology at the University. He wrote extensively and spent his retirement years, from 1950 to 1961, in Englewood, Colorado compiling his writings and research into three books that were published by the Smithsonian Institution. McKhann refers to Graham as \"One of a handful of Western missionaries whose scientific work was respected by other scientists—and of even fewer scientists whose religious work was respected by other missionaries.\""

His ancestral name was Ying (嬴), and Duke Hui was his posthumous title. He was the second of the two rulers of Qin called Duke Hui. Duke Hui's father Duke Jian of Qin was the uncle of his predecessor Duke Ling. When Duke Ling died in 415 BC, the throne was passed to his uncle Duke Jian instead of his son, the later Duke Xian. Duke Hui then succeeded his father when Duke Jian died in 400 BC after 15 years of reign. In 387 BC, the thirteenth year of Duke Hui's reign, Qin attacked the State of Shu and took the city of Nanzheng. Later that year Duke Hui died and was succeeded by his young son, Chuzi II. Chuzi was then either one or two years old, and the power was controlled by his mother, the duchess dowager. Just two years later, in 385 BC the minister Jun Gai (菌改) rebelled against Chuzi and the duchess. He led his forces to escort Duke Xian, who was at the time exiled in the State of Wei, back to Qin, killed Chuzi and his mother, and installed Duke Xian on the throne."

  "text" : "David M. Becker, now a partner at Cleary Gottlieb, was twice General Counsel and Senior Policy Director of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Becker graduated from Columbia College (1968) and Columbia University Law School (1973), where he was editor-in-chief of the Columbia Law Review. He then was a law clerk for Judge Harold Leventhal of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, and a year later for Justice Stanley Reed of the U.S. Supreme Court. He served from January 2000 to May 2002 after joining the SEC staff as Deputy General Counsel in 1998, and again beginning in 2009. He left the second time in 2011. SEC Inspector General H. David Kotz discovered that in spite of having a conflict of interest, Becker had worked on the investigation of the Madoff investment scandal. The Becker family had received a $2 million inheritance that had been invested in a Madoff account. Kotz referred the matter to the U.S. Justice Department's criminal division. Becker indicated that he had notified seven senior SEC officials about the account, including the Chairman and the SEC's ethics officer, and none suggested that he recuse himself. Becker said: I have seen Inspector General Kotz do this before, make a big fuss... about sending reports to the Justice Department. Nothing has happened in any of them, and some of them ... from my time at the SEC were laughable. The Justice Department declined to pursue the matter. Eventually then SEC chairwoman Mary Shapiro said about the incident \"I wish that Mr. Becker had recused himself, absolutely.\" On September 22, 2011, Becker testified before the Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee of the House Committee on Financial Services and the TARP, Financial Services and Bailouts of Public and Private Programs Subcommittee of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform about his role in advising the SEC related to the bankruptcy of Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities. He is now a partner at Cleary Gottlieb."

Rennie also coached various Upper Hutt club level teams, the same club at which he started his rugby and coaching career. Rennie was coach of the New Zealand national under-20 rugby union team, under whom the team won three consecutive World titles from 2008 to 2010.In 2012 Rennie became the first first-year Super Rugby coach to win a Super Rugby title when he guided the Chiefs to a 37-6 win over the Sharks. Unfortunately, during the match, Rennie's house was robbed and valuables were stolen, as had similarly occurred to Chiefs player Sonny Bill Williams several weeks earlier. He coached the Chiefs to their second straight Super Rugby title in the 2013 season, beating the Brumbies by 27-22."

In the 1990s he returned to West Palm Beach to care for his father, who taught him about his great-great-grandfather, a Seminole. Bryant helped organize ceremonies at Riverbend Regional Park in Jupiter, Florida to commemorate the Battle of the Loxahatchee, where Florida's Trail of Tears began after the battle between 500 and 700 Seminoles and approximately 1,700 U.S. soldiers. He also helped write the book We R Florida about Seminole life in Palm Beach County. He died in San Francisco after a heart attack at age 64."

  "text" : "David Akin is a Canadian reporter and parliamentary bureau chief for the one-person bureau of the Sun chain of newspapers. Akin's career began in 1993 with The Packet and Times in Orillia, Ontario as the paper's city hall reporter. In 1995, he moved to The Chronicle Journal in Thunder Bay, Ontario where he worked as a senior reporter and joined the The Hamilton Spectator and then the National Post, followed by The Globe and Mail. From 2001 to 2008, Akin was a parliamentary correspondent for CTV News before joining Canwest News Service (now known as Postmedia) as a national affairs correspondent. At CTV, Akin won a Gemini Award for his reporting. The Globe and Mail reported that he resigned from Canwest on June 10, 2010, to become the first reporter for Sun Media's new all news cable service. From 2011 to 2015 he was the national bureau chief for Sun Media and the Sun News Network and hosted the The Daily Brief and, later, the hour-long prime time show Battleground. He was briefly a freelance reporter after the demise of the channel before returning to the Sun chain, following its acquisition by Postmedia, as parliamentary bureau chief and sole member of the chain's Parliamentary bureau. Canadian playwright Michael Wheeler characterized Akin as having \"broke ranks\" with the rest of the Parliamentary press gallery when he asked the Prime Minister about Homegrown prior to its opening night.According to Wheeler all reporters had agreed upon a question about a prominent issue of the day which they would all ask if they were called upon for a question from the Prime Minister. In February 2010 Akin reported, as fact, a rumor that Gordon Lightfoot had died."

After the war he became the general in the New Jersey state Militia. He was married to Mary Wolverton. Children of Daniel Bray and Mary Wolverton are: Elizabeth Bray, b.

For all time Washington crossing the Delaware will be one of the most dramatic incidents of the great struggle. Art has fixed it upon canvas, history has dwelt upon it. But few eyes beheld that little band of men risking life and health through the long nights. bringing the boats to Washington. A large portion of New Jersey Route 29 is named the Daniel Bray Highway in honor of Captain Bray's vital role in this critical phase of the Revolutionary War. In 1903 Joseph F. Folsom wrote \"The Ballad of Daniel Bray\", which is printed in \"Patriotic Poems of New Jersey\" compiled by W. C. Armstrong, and in \"Historic Trenton\" by Louise Hewitt. Author: Rev. Joseph F. Folsom\"Many patriots who in the long struggle did less for their country's freedom than Daniel Bray are to-day more honored and sung, although he, through many perils, gathered by night the fleet of boats by which Washington crossed the icy Delaware. Even had the battle of Trenton proved a disaster for the Americans, instead of the glorious victory it actually became, the dangerous descent of the swiftly flowing river, from the mouth of the Lehigh to Malta Island, a journey of fifty miles through long wintry nights, accomplished by Captain Bray and his compatriots, should at least give his name a place beside those of Paul Revere, Sergeant Jasper and Molly Pitcher.\" After the war, Daniel Bray, like Cincinnatus, went back to being a Hunterdon County farmer, on his homestead farm in Kingwood Township. He and his wife Mary Wolverton already had four children by the end of the war. To the right is a link to a picture of where Daniel Bray is buried. 8366.jpg"

  "text" : "David Wightman (born in Stockport, Greater Manchester 1980) is an English painter known for his abstract and landscape acrylic paintings using collaged wallpaper. He graduated with an MA in Painting from the Royal College of Art in 2003. In 2003, while still studying at the Royal College of Art (and having just been nominated for the Lexmark European Art Prize), Meredith Etherington-Smith, former editor of Art Review, said of his short-listed piece: \"David Wightman frames his picture perfect Swiss postcard in the cool collateral of a Ben Nicholson modernist painting\". In 2009, he showed a large site-specific painting: Behemoth at Cornerhouse, Manchester (2009) and went on to exhibit with Sumarria Lunn Gallery at The Hempel, London (2010). In 2010-11 he was one of two artists (the other being Hannah Maybank) selected for the Berwick Gymnasium Arts Fellowships - a six-month residency supported by English Heritage and Arts Council England. The residency took place in a Nicholas Hawksmoor designed former military gymnasium in Berwick-upon-Tweed, Northumberland. In 2013, he was commissioned by HOUSE Festival in Brighton (selected by artist Mariele Neudecker) to make a site-specific painting for a disused pavilion on Brighton's seafront. The piece (Hero) is the largest painting by the artist to date. Cherie Federico, editor of Aesthetica Magazine has said: \"You must spend time with Wightman’s paintings; on the surface they are beautiful and intricate, but like the layers they are made from, there is so much depth to his works\". In 2012 he had his first major solo show entitled Paramour at Halcyon Gallery, London. His work is held in several public collections including the Royal College of Art and General Energy UK. Most recently, Wightman collaborated with the Swiss fashion house Akris as part of their Fall / Winter 2014/15 collection. He lives and works in London."

King Yi of Zhou sided with Marquis of Ji and executed Duke Ai by boiling him to death. King Yi then installed Jing, a half-brother of Duke Ai and Duke Xian, on the throne, to be posthumously known as Duke Hu of Qi. Duke Hu moved the capital of Qi from Yingqiu (later known as Linzi) to Bogu (薄姑). The move was resented by the people of Yingqiu, who rebelled under the leadership of Duke Xian. Duke Hu was killed and Duke Xian ascended the throne. Duke Xian expelled the sons of Duke Hu and moved the capital back to Linzi. He reigned for 9 years and died in 851 BC.

His personal name was Lü Zhu'er (呂諸兒), ancestral name Jiang (姜), and Duke Xiang was his posthumous title. Although under Duke Xiang the state of Qi conquered the neighbouring state of Ji, its traditional enemy, Duke Xiang is best known for his depravity, having had an incestuous relationship with his sister Wen Jiang and murdered his brother-in-law Duke Huan of Lu. At the end Duke Xiang was himself murdered by his cousin Wuzhi, who subsequently usurped the Qi throne."

  "text" : "David Binder (born February 22, 1931) is an American journalist and author. He was a reporter for the New York Times from 1961 to 2004  serving as a foreign correspondent in Berlin in 1961 where he reported on the building of the Berlin wall; in the Balkans, based in Belgrade 1963–1966; in Germany based in Bonn and later Berlin, 1967 to 1973. During the latter period he reported on the gradual rapprochement between East and West Germany, and on the Prague Spring of 1968. He was then transferred to Washington, D.C as a diplomatic correspondent, later as serving as the bureau's assistant news editor, and again as a reporter. He was repeatedly sent abroad as a special correspondent for The Times to report on the decline of the Soviet Bloc in 1987, the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, the collapse of the Warsaw Pact and the end of the Communist regimes in the German Democratic Republic, Romania, Albania and Yugoslavia in 1990-1992. He traveled to the Balkans to report on the civil wars that brought about the dissolution of Yugoslavia (1990-1995) and the post-Communist regimes in Bulgaria and Romania . He also reported on the unification of West and East Germany. In 2000-2001 he again went to the Balkans to report on the burgeoning sex trade and drug smuggling in the region for MSNBC. Early in his career he worked briefly as a science reporter for The Times, returning more than three decades later to reporting on wildlife biology. Over the years he also contributed to other publications including The Reporter, The Nation, The New Republic, Foreign Policy (published in Washington), Politika (a daily published in Belgrade), Vreme, (a weekly published in Belgrade) Weltwoche (Swiss weekly published in Zurich), der Spiegel, (a German weekly published in Hamburg) Stern, (a German magazine(published in Hamburg) Neues Deutschland, (a daily published in Berlin), Blaetter fuer deutsche und internationale Politik (published in Bonn) and The Wilson Quarterly (published in Washington). In 1970 he was elected president of the Verein der Auslaendischen Presse (Foreign Press Association) of Germany. In 1989 he was appointed to the editorial advisory board of the newly created Mediterranean Quarterly. In its first issue he published an article entitled The End of the Bloc, saying the Soviet Union's East European empire was \"falling apart before our eyes.\" This appeared before the opening of the Berlin Wall in November 1989."

  "text" : "Donovan Drayton is the son of guitarist Ronny Drayton. Drayton came into the spotlight when attention was drawn to what his father claims is a wrongful incarceration with no valid trial or charges. On July 25, 2013, Drayton was acquitted of all but one charge, possession of a weapon. On January 4, 2012, the bands Living Colour and 24-7 Spyz played together for the first time at a benefit for Donovan Drayton's defense called The Million Man Mosh, organized by his father, Ronny Drayton. Michael Hampton also appeared at this benefit. According to Greg Tate, \"Whatever lingering doubt some may had about Donovan’s innocence was forever dispelled by the fact that Donovan, alone among those charged in the case, refused to accept a plea deal…This despite the fact that he risked maximum sentences while those who confessed to planning and executing the crime were given minimum terms of incarceration.\". On January 4, 2013, a second Million Man Mosh was held, which featured Living Colour, 24-7 Spyz, and Burnt Sugar. In March, 2013, the 4Donovan website put together a benefit album to raise money for Donovan's defense funds. All of the proceeds, after Paypal deductions, go directly to Ronny Drayton. The album features performances by Burnt Sugar, The Veldt, Leon Gruenbaum, Gene Williams, Jane Getter, The Family Stand, Ronny Drayton, Paula Henderson aka Secretary, Ajaxpark, David Gilmore, Honey Ear Trio, Mark Lesseraux, Micah Gaugh, Joe Bowie, Stephanie Rooker, No Image, Asa Lovechild, Manguss, Les July, The Rewd Onez, The Sweet Fuzzy Itsy Bitsy, D-Xtreme, Baba Yaga, Throwdown Syndicate, The Freeman Brothers, Suga Bush, Alex Lozupone with Pain Hertz, Darquematta, Divine Pocket Bouncers, Dope Sagittarius with Mazzmuse, Ted Stilles, Ben Tyree, Marc Edwards & Slipstream Time Travel, Tommy O, Devi, and Marque Gilmore."

Hooijer was born in Medan on Sumatra, but spent his youth in Bogor on Java. In 1932, his family moved to The Hague where he finished his high school education at Dalton Den Haag school in 1937. Subsequently he studied geology on the University of Leiden. In 1941 he joined the staff of the Rijksmuseum van Natuurlijke Historie in Leiden, where he was especially interested in fossil rhinoceroses and hippopotami. In 1946, he became curator of the Dubois collection. In the same year he promoted under Professor Hilbrand Boschma (1893–1976) with his dissertation Prehistoric and fossil Rhinoceroses from the Malay Archipelago and India. From 1950 to 1951 he got a Rockefeller fellowship and worked at the American Museum of Natural History in New York City. From 1970 until his retirement in 1979 he was professor at the University of California, Irvine. Hooijer published 267 scientific articles about vertebrate fossils from Indonesia, Africa, the Near East (especially Israel), the Netherlands, the Antilles, and South America. Many of these work were devoted to fossil rhinoceroses, cats, hogs, rodents, primates, and probiscoidae. He described six new genera, including Celebochoerus, Chilotheridium, Epileptobos, Paradiceros, Paulocnus, and Spelaeomys and 47 new species and subspecies, including Babyrousa bolabatuensis, Elephas celebensis and the Flores Cave Rat. Hooijer was married and had two daughters and one son. He died in Leiden, Netherlands."

  "text" : "Daniel \"Homeless\" Mustard (born December 25, 1975) is an American singer-songwriter and musician. He got his nickname from being homeless. He went on the Opie and Anthony Show because he was chosen to participate in their \"Homeless Shopping Spree\" charity event. However, due to restrictions placed on the event by SirusXM management they were unable to follow through with the event. With airtime set aside for the event that was now needing to be filled, and because they had gone through and brought in several homeless people, they decided to improvise and hold a \"Homeless Talent Show\". During his interview Daniel disclosed his history as a musician and they asked him to perform a song, so he performed \"Creep\" by Radiohead, and delivered a solo performance that was extremely well received by surprised critics and audience alike. He has since recorded an EP, Daniel Mustard EP and was released on November 30, 2010. On October 26, 2012, via his Facebook page, Mustard announced he would be making a short documentary about his story and career so far. He asked fans, specifically in the New York City area, to volunteer themselves to be interviewed about the first time they heard his cover and what impact it may have had on them. Mustard's second release, Fragments of Bone, was completed and released using funding from a Kickstarter campaign on September 25, 2012 and was produced by James Bertuzzi. The album contains a new recording of his cover of \"Creep\". On December 7, 2012, Mustard released a Christmas song called \"Since Santa Ain't Coming\" through his YouTube channel accompanied by a music video. He describes the song as an 'anti-Christmas song' due to his little love for the holiday, mostly because his birthday happens to fall on the same day."

An ethnic Bulgarian, he joined the Romanian Communist Party (PCR) prior to 1944, when it was illegal. Coliu spent the World War II years in Moscow with other Romanian communists, and was a devoted collaborator of Ana Pauker's. Following the King Michael Coup, he returned to Romania with the Horia, Cloşca şi Crişan Division, where he was made a general in the Land Forces for political reasons. He joined the central committee in 1945, remaining until his death. He was elected a candidate member of the politburo in 1952, alongside Alexandru Drăghici and Nicolae Ceauşescu, holding that post until 1969. He sat in the Great National Assembly, heading its foreign affairs committee from 1953 to 1955. Under Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej, between 1954 and 1965, he was president of the State Control Commission and of the Party Control Commission, seconded by Ion Vincze. The party's professional interrogator as part of repressive actions initiated by the Securitate secret police, he took over the latter post in 1960 as Constantin Pîrvulescu was purged for his silence several years earlier in a plot to unseat Gheorghiu-Dej. By 1961, the Comintern veteran was among those advocating a turn toward national communism. He left his control commission post in 1969. Coliu was a hardliner within the leadership of the PCR, an unconditional follower of Joseph Stalin and of Stalinism. His wife Olga was Soviet citizen whom he married while in Moscow."

His father was also the president of Croatian Music Institute from 1919 to 1929. Plamenac studied and finished law school at the University of Zagreb. In 1912 he studied composition in Vienna. In Prague, 1919, he studied composition and piano. Plamenac also studied musicology with Hugo Chaim Adler in Paris. He finished his complete works on Johannes Ockeghem motets and chanson. In 1928 he began teaching musicology at the University of Zagreb as the private assistant professor. He was also the accompanist at the city opera in Berlin. In 1939 Plamenac went to the United States as the Yugoslav representative to the International Musicological Society Congress in New York. Plamenac decided to remain in New York due to frequent persecution of Jews in Europe and World War II. Plamenac was professor of music at the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign from 1954 to 1963. He received an honorary doctorate in 1976. Plamenac was the first to indicate to the value of the works of Croatian renaissance and baroque periods, as he published them in modern editions. Plamenac died on 15 April 1983 in Ede, Netherlands. In Plamenac's honor, Croatian Musicological Society awards every year Dragan Plamenac Award to best scientific achievement, primarily related to Croatian musical culture, Croatian or foreign scientists in the field of musicology."

Dan develops his skills by logging in 30-plus hours a week of practice to golf and was originally planned to hit the 10,000 hour goal of deliberate practice by October 2016.

  "text" : "Dirmicius of Regensburg, 2nd Abbot of Regensburg, fl. 1121–1133. The Schottenkloster of Saint James was founded at Regensburg for Irish Benedictine monks in 1110. According to Harbison (1975) – who quotes a 13th-century source – the second abbot was called Dirmicius. His original name was probably Dermot. Dirmicius ruled from about 1121 to 1133. According to Elsasser, during this time, he sent two men, Conrad the Carpenter and William the Joiner, to help with the construction of Cormac's Chapel on the Rock of Cashel. Harbison states that Dirmicius sent two of his monks to Ireland during the reign of King Conchobar Ó Briain of Thomond (reigned 1127–1142) to collect money \"presumably for the building of a church in Regensburg.\" (Harbison, 1975) The only surviving part of the Schottenkloster is the north portal – the Jakobskirche – which consists of \"two square towers and a part of the eastern aspe. These two towers have been invoked as models upon which the two towers of Cormac's Chapel in Cashel were based.\" (Harbison, 1975) At least one charter survives mentioning Dirmicius (see external links)."

Robust in build and ruddy of complexion, he is one of the central figures in its life, and in its celebrated fair.\" O'Neill went on to say: \"Though totally blind, he is, strange to say, unsurpassed as a judge of cattle and other kinds of farm stock, and so well recognized is his skill in this respect that at fair and market his opinion is eagerly sought when trading is in progress. Stranger still is the fact that furniture moving is his principal occupation. With a table on his head, or a cupboard on his back, he can make his way safely all over town. To see him thus engaged and without a trace of timidity in his footsteps, a stranger would never suspect that he was blind.\" \"Gifted with great conversational powers, an endless fund of humor, and a tenacious memory, he is naturally the life of every gathering which he attends. With such attractions, not to mention his qualifications as a prize-winning piper, we can understand how he won the heart and hand of a buxom young colleen half his age, it being his second matrimonial venture.\" \"The jolly Denis, having “seen” to the burial of an old friend and brother piper, naturally “came in” for his beautiful set of pipes. He disposed of his own superannuated set, made by the elder Kenna in 1781, to Mr. Wayland, the irrepressible enthusiast and untiring promoter, of Cork, he being the fifth proud possessor of this specimen of Kenna’s handiwork.\" \"The first owner after coming from the hands of the maker was a Mr. Burke of Tyquin, near Athenry, County Galway, and their cost ten pounds. By bequest they became the property of Mr. Burke’s nephew, Mr. C. Natton, of Kingstown. Dublin, from whom Denis Delaney purchased them in 1873.\" Delaney died of pneumonia on 29 November 1920 in the infirmary of Ballinasloe Workhouse. According to his death certificate, he was 78. He was married twice: in 1869 to Catherine and in 1904 to Maria Flannery."

Witnesses described the assassin as a well-built man, 30 to 35, with thick black hair and mustache, 5 feet 8 inches, wearing blue jeans and a striped polo shirt. Two Armenian militant groups, ASALA and JCAG, took responsibility for the assassination.

Vibe belonged to an influential Danish family. His father was knighted in 1679. His grandfather, Mads Jensen Medelfar (1579-1637), had been the  Bishop of Diocese of Lund (1620–1637). He finished his formal education with an extended journey abroad, returning to Denmark in 1695. In 1704 he accompanied King Frederick IV of Denmark on a tour of Norway during the Great Northern War. During the winter of 1708–09, he accompanied the king on his journey to the Italian city of Venice. Vibe served as an adviser to the king and was in 1708 appointed to the Privy Council; later that year he became a member of the national government. He was appointed Governor-general of Norway from 1722. He came into conflict with Bartholomæus Deichman, bishop of the Diocese of Oslo. Vibe often opposed his proposals and won acceptance for his view with the king. He lived at the Bygdøy Royal Estate, and became the owner of Rosendal Estate in 1725. Since 1690, Vibe had also owned Freidenfelde Manor in the Duchy of Holstein and in 1725 he became the owner of Barony Rosendal in Hardanger. He was decorated with the Order of Dannebrog and with the Order of the Elephant."

  "text" : "Li Wangyang (Chinese: 李旺阳, 12 November 1950 – 6 June 2012) was a Chinese dissident labor rights activist, member of the Workers Autonomous Federation and chairman of the Shaoyang WAF branch. Following his role in the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989, he served twenty-one years in prison on charges of counterrevolutionary propaganda, incitement, and subversion. Of all Chinese pro-democracy activists from 1989, Li has spent the longest time in prison. On 6 June 2012, one year after his release from prison, and a few days after a television interview in which he continued to call for vindication of the Tiananmen Square protests, Li was found hanged in a hospital room. Shaoyang city authorities initially claimed suicide was the cause of death, but it was revised to 'accidental death' after the autopsy. Following a protest march attended by up to 25,000 people, Pan Democrats and senior establishment figures in Hong Kong publicly commented on the suspicious nature of the death, and said they had escalated the demands of citizens to politicians or \"relevant departments\" at national level for an independent investigation. The uproar in Hong Kong is said by commentators have put pressure on mainland authorities to order a criminal investigation so as not to overshadow the impending visit of president Hu Jintao for the 15th anniversary celebrations of the handover of Hong Kong."

  "text" : "Donald Delbert Clayton (born March 18, 1935) is an American astrophysicist whose most visible achievement was prediction on sound nucleosynthesis grounds that supernovae are intensely radioactive. He was awarded the NASA Exceptional Scientific Achievement Medal (1992) for “theoretical astrophysics related to the formation of (chemical) elements in the explosions of stars and to the observable products of these explosions”. Supernovae became the most important stellar events in astronomy owing to their profoundly radioactive nature. Clayton's works surprised with foundational ideas for five original subfields of astrophysical research: (1) nucleosynthesis, the assembly of the atomic nuclei of the common chemical elements by nuclear reactions within the stars; (2) astronomy of gamma-ray lines emitted by radioactive atoms created and ejected by supernovae; (3) growth in time of the interstellar abundances of the chemical elements, especially of their radioactive isotopes, owing to births and deaths of stars; (4) predicted interstellar cosmic dust grains, which he named stardust, of isotopically identifiable condensation within gaseous stars; (5) predicted condensation of solid grains of carbon within hot, oxygen-dominated radioactive supernova gases. Clayton published these original and surprising ideas from research positions at California Institute of Technology, Rice University, Cambridge University, Max-Plank Institute for Nuclear Physics, Durham University and Clemson University during an academic career spanning six decades. Clayton authored four books for the public: a novel, The Joshua Factor (1985), is a parable of the origin of mankind utilizing the mystery of solar neutrinos; a science autobiography, Catch a Falling Star; a mid-career memoir The Dark Night Sky, of cultural interest owing to Clayton's conception of it in 1970 as layout for a movie with Italian filmmaker Roberto Rosselini  about growing awareness during a cosmological life (See Personal below); Handbook of Isotopes in the Cosmos (Cambridge Univ. Press, 2003), describing in prose the nuclear origin of each isotope of our natural elements and important evidence supporting each nuclear origin. Clayton has published on the web Photo Archive for the History of Nuclear Astrophysics from his personal photographs and his researched captions recording photographic history during his research in nuclear astrophysics."

  "text" : "Dick Weissman (born January 21, 1935, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania) is a singer, composer, banjo player, author and teacher. He co-founded The Journeymen with John Phillips and Scott McKenzie in 1961. The group recorded three albums and seven singles for Capitol Records before breaking up in 1964. Weissman released a solo album \"The Things That Trouble My Mind\" for Capitol in 1964, before moving into a career as a studio musician, record producer and songwriter. In 1972 Weissman moved to Colorado and began writing instructional books for banjo and guitar, which were published by Mel Bay. To date, he has written 15 published books on music and the music business and has written over fifty instructional folios for various music publishers. He later became a tenured professor in the Music & Entertainment Industry program at the University of Colorado at Denver. In 1979, Dick recorded a solo album on Kicking Mule Records, Inc. Its name is \"Modern Banjo - Mountain Style\". As stated on the jacket, this was a great challenge for him and he dedicated the album to guitarist Sam Brown. He dedicated to Sam because he \"thought that he (Sam) might have liked some of the music on this record\" and because \"Sam Brown (was) one of my favorite guitarists.\" Sam Brown died shortly after the album was completed. According to Dick, \"a victim of the music business, New York City, and his own frustrations.\" Between 1994 and 2005, Weissman recorded three additional solo albums, for the Folk Era, Wind River and Long Bridge folk labels."

He arrived in Sydney in 1880 and attended Crown Street Superior School, Sydney Grammar School and the University of Sydney, graduating with a first in Bachelor of Arts (Honours) in 1893 and a Bachelor of Law in 1895, in which year he was called to the Bar. In 1902 he was admitted as a solicitor. He entered the New South Wales Legislative Assembly in 1901 as the Liberal member for Sydney-Fitzroy, transferring to Darlinghurst in 1904 (he would represent Sydney for the period of proportional representation from 1920 to 1927, Paddington from 1927 to 1930, and Woollahra thereafter). In 1919, Levy, despite being a Nationalist, accepted the position of Speaker of the Legislative Assembly from James Dooley's Labor government, provoking discontent within his own party. He resigned with the fall of the government in 1920, was re-appointed by George Fuller for his seven hours as premier, and continued the position when Dooley resumed the premiership later the same day. Becoming known as a scrupulously independent Speaker, Levy advocated the British model of Speakership in which the Speaker's seat was uncontested, and made efforts to have this practice adopted by statute. He was Speaker until 1925, served again from 1927 to 1930, and served briefly in Bertram Stevens' 1932 emergency cabinet as Minister for Justice and Attorney-General. Resuming the Speakership in 1932, he held the position until his death in 1937 at Darling Point."

  "text" : "Dr. Dale P. Cruikshank is an astronomer and planetary scientist in the Astrophysics Branch at NASA Ames Research Center. His research specialties are spectroscopy and radiometry of planets and small bodies in the Solar System. These small bodies include comets, asteroids, planetary satellites, dwarf planets (e.g., Pluto), and objects in the region beyond Neptune (Kuiper belt objects and trans-Neptunian bodies). He uses spectroscopic observations made with ground-based and space-based telescopes, as well as interplanetary spacecraft, to identify and study the ices, minerals, and organic materials that compose the surfaces of planets and small bodies. Together with several colleagues, Cruikshank has found many kinds of ice on several small planetary bodies. These include frozen CH4, N2, CO, CO2, and H2O on Neptune's satellite Triton, CH4, N2, and CO on Pluto, H2O on Pluto's satellite Charon, H2O ice on many of the moons of Saturn and Uranus, H2O and CH3OH on the Centaur object 5145 Pholus. In studies with the Cassini spacecraft, he and his colleagues have found hydrocarbons on several of Saturn's satellites."

  "text" : "David Edward Byrne (born 20 January 1952) is an Australian activist and politician. A former Augustinian monk and Liberal member of the Legislative Assembly of Queensland, he later moved to Cape York, became an advocate for Aboriginal land rights and co-founded the Cape York Land Council with Noel Pearson. Byrne was born in Sydney and was educated at St Martin's Catholic Primary School and Villanova College in Brisbane. He initially entered the Augustinian seminary and became a monk for five years, but later studied teaching at the University of Queensland. A member of the state executive of the Young Liberals, he was elected to the Queensland Legislative Assembly at the 1974 state election amidst the National-Liberal landslide of that year. At 22, he was at that time the state's youngest ever MLA, and he graduated from university during his term. He caused particular controversy when, in 1974, he asked in Parliament why earlier recommendations of an investigating police officer to charge then-Labor Senate nominee Mal Colston with arson had not been proceeded with. Premier Joh Bjelke-Petersen then sought to appoint Albert Field instead, thus sparking the 1975 constitutional crisis. Rae Wear notes in her biography of Bjelke-Petersen that Byrne received 'very bad publicity' over the incident. His electorate was abolished at the 1977 election; he ran for re-election but was defeated. Byrne worked as a history master at San Sisto College in Brisbane before his election and as a lecturer at the Queensland Police Academy after leaving politics. By the early 1980s, however, he was living in the remote community of Injinoo on Cape York, where he became heavily involved in the movement for Aboriginal land rights and in particular of the rights of indigenous communities living on their own country to determine their own governance and future. He subsequently co-founded the Cape York Land Council in 1990, along with friend and ally Noel Pearson. He later served as its deputy director, and remained with the organisation until 1999.He stood unsuccessfully as an independent for the State seat of Cook in 1989 and 1992. Byrne was the subject of an episode of Australian Story in 1997. He lived in Topaz on the Atherton Tablelands for some years maintaining a strong interest in Indigenous issues. He operated a dairy, became a cheesemaker, bred cattle and completed a law degree. He was admitted as a lawyer in the Brisbane Supreme Court in September 2013. He now lives in Injinoo again working with the Apudthama Land Trust and the Injinoo Community."

  "text" : "Dawid Kruiper (c. 1941 – 13 June 2012) was a traditional healer and leader of the ‡Khomani San in the Kalahari. Well known for his acting role in The Gods Must Be Crazy II, Kruiper spoke for the rights of indigenous people to the United Nations in 1994, and led the way for successful land-claims for the San people in South Africa, culminating in the restoration of 40,000 hectares of land in 1999. He also made headlines after hitch-hiking from the Kalahari to Cape Town in 2004 to speak to then South African president Thabo Mbeki, and was also involved in the development and restoration of the San languages. Kruiper was born in the Kalahari National Park. He was outspoken on the theft of traditional knowledge, particularly regarding hoodia, by western pharmaceutical companies. Kruiper died at approximately noon on June 13, 2012 at Upington Medi-Clinic in Upington. He had been transferred there from Gordonia Regional Hospital on June 12, 2012 after his condition abruptly deteriorated at night. Family representative Anna Festus told news media that Kruiper had been doing better during the weekend prior to the deterioration. Specifics of his medical condition and cause of death were not reported."

The former Watford Harrier held the England record in the event which he broke several times during his decade long international athletics career. He later competed for Polytechnic Harriers. He was a founder member of the Hammer Circle. He was a former pupil at Watford Boys Grammar School. It was as an administrator, educator and sporting pioneer that he truly made his mark. Whilst on National Service in Cyprus in 1955, Anthony first played the game of volleyball and, on his return home to a job as an assistant lecturer at Manchester University he established a national governing body for the sport. Anthony remained president of England Volleyball. Volleyball England’s Hall of Fame bears his name. He traveled the world to promote peace and the values of the Olympic Games through UNESCO and the Olympic Solidarity movement. He was a familiar face at the International Olympic Academy in Greece and oversaw the establishment of Britain’s own National Olympic Academy in 1982. As a journalist, he was responsible for uncovering much of Britain’s early Olympic heritage and also ensured that William Penny Brookes’ Olympian Games in Much Wenlock received their rightful place in the history of the modern Games. In 1994, Anthony welcomed Juan Antonio Samaranch to Much Wenlock to mark the centenary of the IOC. Wenlock was the name of one of the London 2012 games mascots. He worked closely with Baron Pierre de Coubertin’s great nephew, Antoine de Navacelle, in the establishment of the Coubertin awards which combined sport with the world of business ethics."

In these private ateliers he produces Neo-Expressionist paintings as well as sculpture, and mosaic. He paints in both oil and acrylic, often incorporating mixed-media, collage and graffiti. Perhaps best known for his signature \"Polo\" series which first gained him critical acclaim his more recent work focuses on themes including his native Spanish culture, American Pop icons and classic literature. He often draws on his experiences as a songwriter (Zapata co-wrote lyrics for Michael Jackson and Jon Secada) and exposes his deeply poetic imagination by incorporating text and visual cues into many of his works. In this way, his images coax the viewer into his realm where fact and fiction persist simultaneously, fortifying each other's beauty, depth and meaning."

  "text" : "Donna Hilley was an American music publishing executive who served as CEO of Sony/ATV Music Publishing from 1994 to her retirement in 2005. Originally from Birmingham, Alabama, Hilley began her career at WKDA in Nashville and went on to work in country music publishing. Her exact age at her time of death was unknown, as she \"often fibbed about her age.\" The Tennessean reported that she was 65 when she died, although she may have been in her early 70s. A graduate of Jones Valley High School in Birmingham, Hilley was inducted into the Alabama Music Hall of Fame in 1999. She had been married to her high school sweetheart from Birmingham for over 40 years. Donna was born Donna Jean Whitten in Montevallo Alabama on June 30, 1940 (she did often fib about her age, but this is accurate). Her father, John Truman Whitten, was a lineman for the Alabama Power Company. Her mother, Janie Mae Whitten ( née Sizemore) was a stay at home mom when Donna was born at home after a long difficult labor (many births occurred at home in the rural South in those days). Her parents came from very poor psychosocial situation, and Donna's parents had moved up the socioeconomic ladder only a bit. Her brother, Jimmy Whitten, was born 5 years later, and a sister Diane Whitten, was born 14 years later. By this time the family had moved to Birmingham for her dad's job. Donna married her high school boyfriend and moved to Nashville (he was at Vanderbilt) immediately after high school. Though armed with only a high school degree and no experience, she began working at a radio station in Nashville. Two young girls, Vickie and Debbie, were born soon after. The couple was quite poor. With a husband in school and Donna at a low paying but fun job, the money was scarce. Several years later Donna followed one of the disc jockeys from WKDA into his advertising firm, Bill Hudson and Associates. She moved up the hierarchy in that position. In 1980 Donna and Rayford were surprised with the birth of their third daughter Whitney (19 & 21 years younger than Vickie and Debbie). Several years later her previous boss at the radio station had also been running a music publishing company, Tree. When Mr Stapp ( owner of Tree ) called Donna to say his secretary had taken ill and had stated only one person could do her job, and that person was Donna Hilley, Donna moved over to Tree Publishing. The position was \"executive assistant\" to Jack Stapp. Not so slowly, but in a very dedicated and determined style that became two well known character traits in Donna. The music business was historically a man's world, especially in those days. Donna worked her way up to president and CEO later of Tree Publishing."

Unenthusiastic about Jim Molyneaux's leadership of the party, Brewster backed Trimble's successful candidacy in the September 1995 leadership election. Brewster was already the Treasurer of the East Londonderry Association of the party, and Trimble assisted him in winning election as one of the party's honorary secretaries in 1996. Brewster claims that Trimble also offered to help him take over as the Member of Parliament for East Londonderry from William Ross, a leading figure in the UUP but a critic of Trimble. However, Brewster did not want the role, and instead won a seat in the equivalent constituency on the Northern Ireland Forum. He worked with Peter King and Dean Godson on the UUP's \"Strand I\" team at the talks which led to the Good Friday Agreement. Brewster was also active in the Orange Order and, like most UUP members who were prominent Orangemen, he became critical of Trimble's leadership, and opposed the Good Friday Agreement. He joined the oppositionist Union First Group, and left the party in 2003 to join the rival Democratic Unionist Party. Outside politics, Brewster worked as a Solicitor."
