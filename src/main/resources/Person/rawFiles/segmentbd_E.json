He obtained his first successes in 1961, with Il capello and Pinne fucile ed occhiali, which both ranked second in the Italian Hit Parade. Later he obtained several more great successes (including Guarda come dondolo, Abbronzatissima and O mio signore which charted 1 and I Watussi which charted 3) until the second half of the 1960s. After a less successful period, he re-launched his career in the 1970s founding the duo Vianella with his wife Wilma Goich. The main hit of the period was Semo gente de borgata, which ranked 7 in Hit Parade. In the late 1970s he reprised his solo career."

  "text" : "Enrique Beech (August 14, 1920 – November 14, 2012) was a Philippine sport shooter. He was born in Manila and attended Colegio de San Juan de Letran and San Beda College, where he played on the association football squad. He was recruited upon his 1936 graduation to play for the Philippines national football team and stayed with them through 1950, when a knee injury put his career on hold. The Philippine Olympic Committee, then the Philippine Amateur Athletic Federation, helped pay for a knee operation so that he could resume playing, but Beech soon turned to shooting following his recovery, believing that he would have a better chance to medal in this sport at the 1954 Asian Games. Beech competed in trap shooting throughout his career and won a bronze medal at the 1954 Asian Games. Two years later he headed to the 1956 Summer Olympics, where he placed 24th in a field of 32 participants in the same event. At the 1958 Asian Games he again captured a bronze medal and his last major international tournament was the 1960 Summer Olympics, where he ended up near the bottom of the rankings in the competition.

He was elected bishop in March, 1935 and consecrated on May 8, 1935 by Adolf Küry with the assistance of Henricus van Vlijmen and John Hermannus Berends. In December 1935, Kreuzer took an oath of episcopal allegiance to Adolf Hitler including the following paragraphs: \"I am ready to take the obligation that shall bind me in my responsible position to particular loyalty to the commonwealth and the Führer. Not as though I felt that either the Church I represent or I myself needed binding by an oath, rather does my own heart urge me to be loyal. Yet do I welcome this hour since it gives me the opportunity of bearing my solemn witness to the fact that our Church knows itself to be intimately allied with the people. [...]\"Our Church is rooted and grounded in Christ's Gospel and in the traditional heritage of Old Catholicism. But at the same time it realizes how close is the relationship with what is to be developed and strengthened in our people by the Third Reich, namely the national commonwealth that shall embrace all members and confessions of the people. It is thus that I, as Bishop of my own Church, do not hesitate to welcome the era of the Third Reich with sincere devotion. We are specially grateful to it because it respects the individuality of our minority in point of number.\"As for myself it shall be my most earnest endeavor to uphold, cherish, and advance the obligation of national loyalty and allegiance to the State and to its Führer.\" (Cited in The Living Church, April 18, 1936, p. 498.)"

  "text" : "Ernst Julius Richard Ewald (14 February 1855 – 22 July 1921) was a German physiologist born in Berlin. He was a younger brother to gastroenterologist Carl Anton Ewald (1845-1915). In 1880, after finishing his studies in mathematics, physics and medicine, he became an assistant to physiologist Friedrich Goltz (1834-1902) at the University of Strasbourg. In 1900 he succeeded Goltz as chair of physiology at Strasbourg, a position he maintained until 1918. Ewald is best remembered for his research of the vestibular system of the inner ear, that largely involved experiments performed on the semicircular canal system of pigeons. From these studies the so-called \"Ewald laws\" are derived, which deal with the effects of endolymph motion on body, head and eye movements and also on the phenomena of excitation-inhibition asymmetries in the vestibular system. \n*  Ewald's first law: \"The axis of nystagmus parallels the anatomic axis of the semicircular canal that generated it\". \n*  Ewald's second law: \"Ampullopetal endolymphatic flow produces a stronger response than ampullofugal flow in the horizontal canal\". In 1892 he was given an award by the Paris Academy of Sciences for his monograph \"Physiologische Untersuchungen über das Endorgan des Nervus octavus\"."

  "text" : "Enrique del Moral Dominguez (born Irapuato, Guanajuato, January 21, 1905 - died Mexico City, June 11, 1987) was a Mexican architect and an exponent of the functionalism movement, a modernist group that included Mexican artists and architects such as José Villagrán Garcia, Carlos Obregón Santacilia, Juan O'Gorman, Juan Legarreta, Carlos Tarditti, Enrique de la Mora and Enrique Yanez. The movement developed from innovative concepts presented by Frank Lloyd Wright, Le Corbusier, Mies van der Rohe and the Bauhaus school as well as Die Stijl, and remodeled the profile of cosmopolitan Mexico City and other cities in the 1930‘s. Over a span of more than fifty years, Enrique de Moral was designer and builder of over 100 public and private works in large metropolitan areas such as Mexico City as well as his hometown of Irapuato, but is primarily known for his role in the overall plan of the Ciudad Universitaria (1947–1952), site of the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM), along with the architects Mario Pani and Salvador Ortega. He was responsible for the direction and coordination of the master project and the Rectorship Tower, one of the most representative features of the campus. Del Moral modernized curricula during his time as director of the Faculty of Architecture (UNAM) (1944–1949), incorporating philosophies acquired from like-minded architects such as Mies van der Rohe at the Illinois Institute of Technology as well as Mexican philosophy on esthetic espoused by Dr. Jose Gaos in the Faculty of Philosophy and Literature (UNAM). He dedicated a large amount of his academic life to lecturing both domestically and abroad, and published books and essays on the evolution of architectural styles. He theorized about functionalism in Mexico and debated controversial issues of his time, such as the integration of plastic arts into architecture, and promoted the conservation of cities, approaching architecture in a way that could find balance between traditional and modern styles."

She attended the Århus Theatre School in Denmark 1993-1997. Since her graduation, she has worked within theater, film, performance art, and television in both Denmark and Sweden. Nyman has performed with The Royal Danish Theatre, The Betty Nansen Theatre, Malmö City Theatre and in Henning Mankell’s play Lampedus and many more. Parallel to her acting, Nyman runs a political art project called SPACECAMPAIGN, which includes posters and t-shirts, plus activities such as talks, fictitious articles and performance art. The aim is to nuance the mass medial conceptions of, ethnic minorities. Nyman has been a regular cast member of several TV-shows such as the Danish dramas At the Faber (season 4) and the 1:st season of Forsvar, the Swedish mini-series Om ett hjärta plus minor roles in crime dramas Wallander and The Bridge. Today she lives in Stockholm, but resided in Copenhagen for many years. Through her art, she commented on the right-wing populist Danish People's Party in various ways, including singing the Danish National Anthem on election night, while wrapped in a tablecloth from IKEA (to look more like the stereotypical Eritrean woman) to the partys leader Pia Kjaersgaard. The party holds that Denmark is not naturally a country of immigration, and that it has never been so. The party also does not accept a multi-ethnic transformation of Denmark, and rejects multiculturalism\". In 2012, Nyman directed A Performance of Swedish Arms Exports (En föreställning om svensk vapenexport) at Teater Tribunalen. The goal is to initiate a national referendum on Swedish arms export."

Before joining UCS in 2003, Lyman was president of the Nuclear Control Institute. He has a doctoral degree in physics from Cornell University. According to Lyman, despite the events of September 11, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) has voted to delay implementation of safety and security upgrades in ways that will weaken protection of nuclear power plants. Lyman says that these new moves illustrate an \"ominous trend\". Pressure from the nuclear industry to delay tighter security arrangements has succeeded, with the full support of the NRC’s commissioners. Commissioners backing of these retrograde measures could be seen as providing industry protection rather than defending the safety of the public."

Later, as Brazil's Minister for Science and Technology, he supported stem-cell research. He served two terms as governor of his home state, Pernambuco. He helped hospitals, secondary schools, wind power, farms, poor people and anti-crime data-mining. In his 2014 campaign for president of Brazil he criticized the incumbent and her Workers' Party and positioned himself as the business-friendly leader of the Brazilian Socialist Party. At 8-10% in popularity, Mr. Campos kept campaigning, 18 hours a day. For outdoor rallies and local radio interviews, he criss-crossed the country by rented jet. He died on 13 August 2014, when his plane crashed in poor weather in the city of Santos."

After her stage debut in 1810 when she sang in the premiere of Stefano Pavesi's Il trionfo di Gedeone at Bologna's Teatro del Corso, she went on to perform at La Fenice, La Scala, Teatro Regio di Torino, Rome's Teatro Argentina and several other opera houses, primarily in Northern Italy. In addition to the roles she created in Rossini's operas, she also sang in the world premieres of operas by several composers who are lesser known today, including Pietro Raimondi, Simon Mayr, and Ferdinando Paër. Her last known appearance was in 1828 after which there is no further trace of her. The date and place of her death are unknown."

The daughter of Saverio Angri (originally from Naples) and Maria Vitturi di Giovanni, her real name was Nazarena Mattia Elena Catterina. She was baptised on 10 June 1821 at the Roman Catholic Cathedral of St James and St Christopher in Corfu, Greece. During the 1855 and 1856 season at the Teatro Regio in Turin, she performed in La Cenerentola (as Angelina), The Barber of Seville (as Rosina), and Il trovatore (as Azucena). Later in 1856, she performed for the first time in New York City, accompanied by the pianist and composer Sigismond Thalberg."

Martyn\" (born Edinburgh, 23 March 1813; died Newcastle-on-Tyne, 27 December 1846), was a Scottish opera soprano, popular singer and actress of the early 19th century, in England and in America. She also composed some ballads with her husband Charles Martyn, a bass from Bristol. After showing early promise as a singer in Edinburgh, she became a student of Sir George Smart, a prominent conductor and vocal instructor. She debuted at Covent Garden in Rossini's Cinderella (14 December 1830) and also appeared in Spohr's \"Azor and Zemira\" (1831), Meyerbeer's \"Robert le diable\" (1832), and Rossini's The Maid of Judah (1832), among other productions. After her marriage in 1834, she and her husband continued to perform, in England and America, for a number of years. In 1839 the Martyns premiered Beethoven's Fidelio in America. They later became music teachers in Newcastle. She was a grandniece of the Scottish poet Robert Fergusson. An engraving (by John Henry Robinson) of her exists, from a portrait by Alfred Edward Chalon. The portrait was exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1839. Another engraving was by William Sharp from a portrait by William Booth."

An ordnance engineer, Reising was the recipient of more than 60 firearm patents. Following his work with Harrington & Richardson, he designed semi-automatic rifles for Mossberg & Sons, Marlin, Savage, and Stevens. Of Swedish ancestry from a family that came to Delaware in 1635, Reising was born at Port Jervis, New York. He was the son of a railroad engineer who died when Eugene Reising was an infant. Reising attended Lehigh University for three years, then worked as a cowboy in Texas and Mexico for a few years. On returning to the U.S. he went to work for Colt, testing and selling guns. He worked with John M. Browning on the development of the Colt Model 1911 pistol. Approximately 100,000 Reising submachineguns were manufactured and many were used in World War II."

  "text" : "Elizabeth A. Johnson was a prominent advocate of Kansas history. She discovered, purchased, and donated the land that makes up the Pawnee Indian Museum State Historic Site to the state of Kansas in 1899. At the time, it was considered to be the first place the United States flag was raised on the state of Kansas. In the 1870s, Johnson became interested in Zebulon Pike and the possibility that the events surrounding the raising of the U.S. flag occurred nearby. She discovered what was believed to be the site in 1875 and, after studying Pike's journals and investigating another reported Pawnee site in southern Nebraska, concluded that this was the village that Pike had visited. To protect the site from being plowed, she and her husband bought the land. In 1901, the Johnsons donated the site to the state of Kansas for historic preservation. Johnson's claim was supported by Elliott Coues, who had edited Pike's journal; with his endorsement, it was accepted by the Kansas State Historical Society. In 1901, Johnson donated the land to the state of Kansas, which built a 26-foot (7.9 m) granite monument commemorating Pike's symbolic triumph over Spain. At the dedication of the monument, several of the speakers drew parallels between the Pike episode and the recent American victory in the Spanish–American War. In 1906, a four-day festival was held to celebrate the centennial of the flag incident. Subsequent research showed that Pike's expedition had not visited this village, but the Kitkehahki village now known as the Pike-Pawnee Village Site, located on the Republican River in Webster County in south-central Nebraska. The error was a fortunate one, however: it led to the preservation of the site in Kansas, whereas the Nebraska site had been degraded by years of cultivation."

  "text" : "Edmund Boulnois (17 June 1838 – 7 May 1911) was a British businessman and Conservative Party politician. Edmund was the son of William Boulnois of St John's Wood, the proprietor of the Baker Street Bazaar, Marylebone, London . He was educated at King Edward's School, Bury St. Edmunds and St. John's College, Cambridge. He graduated with a BA degree in 1862, going on to gain a MA in 1868. In 1863 he married Catherine Bennett of Great Marlow, Buckinghamshire. He succeeded his father as owner of the Bazaar and was also chairman of the West Middlesex Waterworks Company, a director of the London Life Association and of the Westminster Electric Supply Corporation. Boulnois was elected to the Marylebone Board of Guardians, of which he became the chairman. In 1880 he was appointed a justice of the peace for Middlesex. A member of the Conservative Party, at the 1886 general election he acted as election agent for Frederick Seager Hunt, member of parliament for Marylebone West. The Local Government Act 1888 created a new London County Council, with the first elections held in January 1889. Boulnois was chosen by the Marylebone Constitutional Union to contest the electoral division of Marylebone West. He was elected as a member of the Conservative-backed Moderate Party, which formed the opposition group on the council. In July 1889 the sitting Conservative member of parliament for Marylebone East, Lord Charles Beresford, resigned his seat on becoming captain of the HMS Undaunted. Boulnois was chosen by the party to contest the resulting byelection. He held the seat with a majority of 493 votes, defeating the Liberal Party candidate, Granville George Leveson-Gower. Boulnois held the seat until the 1906 general election, when he retired from parliament. When the Metropolitan Borough of St Marylebone was created in 1900, Boulnois was chosen as the borough's first mayor. He served two consecutive terms as mayor. Boulnois maintained two residences: a town house in London's Portman Square and \"Scotlands\", Farnham Royal, Buckinghamshire. He died at his Buckinghamshire home in May 1911, aged 72."

  "text" : "Eduardo Zuleta (born 19 November 1935, in Guayaquil) is a former noted Ecuadorian international tennis player. He competed in the Davis Cup in 1961 and 1963. Eduardo competed on the U.S. as well as the European summer tennis circuit in the late 1950s-early 1960s, with notably more success on slow clay surfaces, on which he was a very steady and indefatigable retriever, than on the faster grass, which was a much more popular surface in his day than it is today. When not on the tournament circuit he practiced in Miami, where he was well known for hitting against a wall for hours, which gave him callouses on his racket hand a good quarter of an inch thick that he would shave down at night with a razor blade. He toured at times with Ecuadorians Washington Suarez and Davis Cupper Miguel Olvera. Zuleta had the nickname El Barco (\"The Ship\") in his home country because he invariably returned there from his tennis tours with suitcases full of tennis equipment and clothing that he received free from manufacturers as goodwill advertising. Perhaps his most conspicuous debut on the tennis stage was his first-round encounter on the grass of the U.S. Championships at Forest Hills, NY in 1963 with then U.S. No. 1 Chuck McKinley, who had just won Wimbledon two months earlier. The outcome was a foregone conclusion in straight sets, but Eduardo put up a creditable fight."

  "text" : "Edward Lockspeiser (21 May 1905 – 3 Feb 1973) was an English musicologist, composer, art critic and radio broadcaster on music who specialized in the works and life of French composer Claude Debussy and was considered one of the few British authorities on French classical music. Lockspeiser studied at the Paris Conservatory between 1922 and 1926 with Alexandre Tansman and Nadia Boulanger and at the Royal College of Music in London from 1929 to 1930 with Charles Herbert Kitson and Malcolm Sargent. He was voted into the Académie des Beaux-Arts in 1948 for his services to French music. Lockspeiser's extensive writings on Debussy include a two-volume biography, Debussy: His Life and Mind (1962, 1965), which was the culmination of 30 years of intense research into the composer's life and personality. According to Mark DeVoto of The Boston Musical Intelligencer, this tome \"remains a landmark work of biography enriched by a wide-ranging analysis of Debussy’s cultural background and literary and artistic influences.\" He contributed the entry on Debussy in The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, articles on Debussy, Felix Mendelssohn and Sergei Diaghilev to the Encyclopædia Britannica and numerous articles for Gramophone, Music & Letters, The Listener and The Musical Times. He was a guest lecturer at the University of London between 1966 and 1971; afterwards, he served in the same capacity at the Collège de France. Lockspeiser became London music critic for the Yorkshire Post in 1936; before that he concentrated on composition and conducting, founding the Toynbee Hall Orchestra in 1934. He worked with the British Broadcasting Company (BBC) from 1941 to 1950. Among the works the BBC commissioned during his tenure was the Sinfonietta from French composer Francis Poulenc. After he left the BBC, Lockspeiser focused on teaching and music journalism. In his teaching, Lockspeiser stressed the importance of understanding a composer's social and aesthetic background to gain a thorough understanding of his musical works. In his last work, he extended this principle to include the visual arts that may have influenced the composer. Lockspeiser's commitment to music and the visual arts was absolute; his wife Eleanore is quoted as saying that \"art was the only important thing in our household\" and their daughter, sculptor Mary Frank, has stated that she \"was brought up to be an artist.\" While he wrote some film music later in his career, the majority of Lockspeiser's musical compositions date from the 1920s. Only one work was published (Deux mélodies, Paris, 1926). Lockspeiser's personal library, which was extensive, was acquired after his death by Lancaster University."

  "text" : "Ernest Entwistle Cheesman (21 September 1898 Wood Green - February 1983 Weybridge), was an English botanist noted for his work on the family Musaceae. He was the son of Charles Cheesman and Grace Lizzie Davies. About August 1936 he married Ellen Elizabeth B. Weston (1892-1966). Cheesman collected in Trinidad and Tobago in 1925-1937, working as professor of botany at the Trinidad Imperial College of Tropical Agriculture  and publishing Flora of Trinidad and Tobago with R. O. Williams in 1929. He became interested in the cultivation of cocoa while in Trinidad and wrote a number of papers on the subject - \n* Cheesman E.E. 1935. The vegetative propagation of cocoa. Tropical Agriculture 12(9): 240-246. \n* Cheesman E.E. 1936. The vegetative propagation of cocoa. VII.- Root systems of cuttings. Page 7, plates 3 & 4 in Fifth Annual Report on Cocoa Research 1935, Trinidad. \n* Cheesman E.E. 1941. General notes on field experiments CRB1 to CRB6. Pages 4–11 in Tenth Annual Report on Cocoa Research 1940. Trinidad. Returning to England he worked on the taxonomy of Musaceae at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew during the 1940s. As a result of his studies he revived the genus Ensete in 1947 (Kew Bull. 1947, 97), first published in 1862 by Paul Fedorowitsch Horaninow (1796-1865), but then not accepted. Cheesman made it clear that there are no wild Musa native to Africa, only Ensete, and that Ensete is monocarpic, has large seeds and 9 haploid chromosomes. Cheesman noted in 1948 of bananas \"Some botanists have regarded the seedless forms as ranking with the fertile species and have bestowed Latin binomials upon them. Others have preferred to regard them as varieties of one mythical \"species\" (usually called \"Musa sapientum\") which is supposed to exist somewhere in the wild and fertile condition … Such mistakes... are not peculiar to the genus \"Musa\", but they are unusually conspicuous in this group\". Giving a seed-bearing wild species the status of subspecies to a seedless cultivar is a good example of the stultifying effect formal nomenclature has had on crop taxonomy. Musa cheesmanii N.W.Simmonds is a tribute to his work on the Musaceae. Simmonds was a 1950s research worker on Musaceae at the Imperial College of Tropical Agriculture in Trinidad, Cheesman's 1930s place of work."

The work followed the approach of Jacob Emden and sought to explain the Talmud to Christians and the Gospel to Jews and to demonstrate the common grounds of belief. He also published a commentary on the Yad Hachazakah of Maimonides. His English translation of the Mishneh Torah was completed in 1857 and published in England in 1863 by Thomas William Nicholson of London. In his later life he became blind.

  "text" : "Edwin Hennig (April 27, 1882 – November 12, 1977) was a German paleontologist. Edwin Hennig was one of five children of a merchant who died when Hennig was 10 years old. Starting in 1902, Hennig studied natural sciences, anthropology, and philosophy at the University of Freiburg in Freiburg im Breisgau, Baden-Württemberg, Germany where earned a doctorate in 1906 with Otto Jaekel. This is where Hennig significantly contributed to research on the extinct genus Gyrodus. Afterwards, he was an assistant to Wilhelm von Branca at Berlin’s Friedrich-Wilhelms-Universität, where he attained his habilitation and became a private lecturer. During World War I, he was a military geologist until 1917 where he became a professor at the University of Tübingen and later an academic rector and director of the geological paleontology institute. Hennig later joined the National Socialist German Workers' Party in 1937. In 1945, he was relieved of office and submitted to denazification. Hennig retired in 1951. Edwin Hennig is well known for joining expeditions with Werner Janensch to the Tendaguru Beds in what is now Tanzania, East Africa. He is also known for describing discoveries of Australopithecus afarensis from East Africa, collected by Ludwig Kohl-Larsen. Much like Othenio Abel, Hennig was a supporter of orthogenesis theories of evolution as was his assistant, Karl Beurlen."

Eggert had a sister, Katrín, who married Bishop Gissur Einarsson, the first Lutheran bishop in Iceland. In his youth, Eggert served Ögmundur Pálsson, Bishop of Skálholt, and will have gone with him to Germany and Norway on his missions in the years 1538-39. Later, he was in the service of Gissur Einarsson and went with him when we went abroad for consecration in Copenhagen in 1542. He was sýslumaður in the Westfjords in 1544 and lived at first at Núpur. He was hirðstjóri 1551-53 and Lawspeaker for the south and east untul 1556, and for the north and west 1556-68, after which he was a sýslumaður and steward of the land of Helgafellsklaustur. Eggert was the richest man in Iceland of his time, and indeed the most powerful. Among his manuscripts was the celebrated Eggertsbók (Rekjavík, Stofnun Árna Magnússonar, AM 556a-b 4to), which contains the earliest surviving text of Gísla saga. On one occasion while Eggert lived at Saurbær, he was seized by English pirates and held for a whole month on board their ship until a high ransome was paid. In 1580 Eggert moved to Hamburg, where he died. Eggert's first wife was Sesselja Jónsdóttir; he later married Steinunn Jónsdóttir."

In 1924, he was the pilot of the first airship to launch and pick up an airplane while in flight, at Wilbur Wright Field. His 1928 balloon licence (number 25; FAI number 930) was one of very few signed by Orville Wright, in his capacity as Chairman of the National Aeronautic Association's Contest Committee. He was commander of Bolling Field in Washington DC from 1939-1941, then of U.S. Air Forces in Northern Ireland, and the Eighth Air Force Composite Command during World War II. He was in charge of air operations at the Yalta and Potsdam Conferences. In 1944, he was U.S. Army Air Force commanding officer in charge of Post Hostilities planning for Europe. The same year, he became head of the Air Section of the United States mission to Moscow, then served as commanding general, U.S. Air Force in the U.S.S.R. from December 1944 until May 1945.

  "text" : "Edward Gamblin (1948 – 2010) was a Canadian country rock singer and songwriter, who was one of the most influential early stars of First Nations music. Born in 1948 at Cross Lake, Manitoba, Gamblin was a member of the Cree people. At the age of five, he was sent to the residential school at Norway House, where he remained until transferring to the residential high school at Portage la Prairie in his teens. He left high school at 16 and hitchhiked to Winnipeg, where he stayed briefly before returning to Norway House, where he formed his first band, Cree Nation, in 1966. He married his childhood classmate Aurelia Monias in 1970, and the couple lived in both Winnipeg and Norway House at different times. Gamblin performed with a variety of bands over the course of his career, most notably Northern Lobo, and wrote more than 60 original songs. In his later years, Gamblin became an activist for healing and reconciliation around the abuses of the residential school system, writing \"Survivor's Voice\" and working with the Aboriginal Healing Foundation. He also attracted press attention for reuniting with Florence Kaefer, a teacher at the Norway House school who hadn't known the full extent of the abuses going on in the student residence. In 2008, Gamblin had an accident on stage, cutting his ankle. The wound became infected, and resulted in the amputation of his leg. His health continued to decline, and he died on July 27, 2010 in Winnipeg."

  "text" : "King was the son of Richard King of Ashby de la Launde and his wife Elizabeth Colly, daughter of Anthony Colly of Glaston, Rutland and MP for Rutland. He was a student of Gray's Inn in 1623 but delayed being called to the bar for over 20 years. On the outbreak of the Civil War, he became a captain of foot in the Parliamentary army. He took part in the first attack on Newark, and was indicted for treason at the Lincolnshire assizes in 1643. In the same year, he became Sheriff of Lincolnshire to 1644 and Governor of Boston to 1645. He was also a commissioner for levying money and a commissioner for defence, in the eastern association. In 1644 he was commissioner for assessment for Lincolnshire, Deputy Lieutenant for Lincolnshire and colonel in the parliamentary army. He was freeman of Grimsby in 1645. He quarrelled with Lord Willoughby of Parham and Cromwell regarded him with suspicion. After his commissions were cancelled at the request of the county committee in 1645, he held no further county office until 1658. King was finally called to the bar in 1646 and replaced a Royalist as Recorder of Grimsby which position he held until his death. Also in 1646 he stood unsuccessfully for parliament at Grimsby. In 1647 he was accused of obstructing the collection of taxes. He became an ancient of Gray's Inn in 1650. In 1653 he succeeded to the estates of his father, including Ashby Hall. He was commissioner for sewers for Lincolnshire in 1658. In 1659 he was considered to be one of the Lincolnshire Royalists. He was commissioner for militia in March 1660 and a J.P. for Kesteven from March 1660 to 1663."

(April 29, 1924 – May 17, 2005) is widely acknowledged as the father of automated essay scoring, a multi-disciplinary field exploring computer evaluation and scoring of student writing, particularly essays. Page’s development of and pioneering work with Project Essay Grade software in the mid-1960s set the stage for the practical application of computer essay scoring technology following the microcomputer revolution of the 1990s. Born in San Diego, CA, Page, a United States Marine Corps veteran, graduated from Pomona College (Claremont, CA) and taught high school English while pursuing his M.A. degree in English at San Diego State University (1955). He received his Ed.D. degree in educational psychology from the University of California, Los Angeles in 1958. Page served as professor of education and psychology for several academic institutions before joining the University of Connecticut (Storrs) in 1962 as Professor of Educational Psychology and Director, Bureau of Educational Research. It was during his tenure there (in late 1964) that Page began the development of PEG software, inspired by the convergence of computational linguistics, artificial intelligence technology, and his own experience as a high school English teacher. Page’s research earned him a number of academic appointments including Visiting Scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (1967–68) and Visiting Professor of Experimental Design at Harvard University (1968–69). Fluent in Spanish, Page also lectured extensively on issues and trends in educational psychology in Spain and South America. Page published more than 250 research articles, technical reports and papers. He was President of the American Psychological Association’s Division of Educational Psychology (1976–77) and a founding editor of the division’s journal, Educational Psychologist. Page also served as President of the American Educational Research Association (1979–80) and contributed to the editorial review boards of several other publications, including the Journal of Educational Measurement of the National Council on Measurement in Education (NCME). In 1979, Page joined the faculty of Duke University as Professor of Educational Psychology and Research and remained there until 2002. During his tenure, Page renewed his development and research in automated scoring and, in 1993, formed Tru-Judge, Inc., anticipating the potential for commercial applications of the software. In 2002, and in declining health, Page sold the intellectual property assets of Tru-Judge to Measurement Incorporated, an educational assessment company specializing in the development and scoring of large-scale assessments."

He was the second son of M.E. Grant Duff (later Sir Mountstuart Grant Duff). He passed the Preliminary Examination for the Civil Services in 1883 and entered the Diplomatic Service in 1888. He served in Rome, Tehran, St Petersburg, Stockholm and Berlin before a post in London 1899–1903. He was Secretary of Legation in Tehran 1903–06. In the summer of 1906 there was no minister (ambassador) in post – the previous minister, Sir Arthur Hardinge, had left in 1905 and the new minister, Sir Cecil Spring Rice, although appointed in December 1905, did not leave England until September 1906 – so Grant Duff was the senior British diplomat in Tehran when, during the Persian Constitutional Revolution, about 12,000 men took sanctuary (bast) in the gardens of the British Legation in what has been called a 'vast open-air school of political science' studying constitutionalism. The Foreign Secretary, Sir Edward Grey, was outraged by Grant Duff's hospitality towards the bastis which, however, inadvertently expedited the Constitutional Revolution. Grant Duff had already been appointed to be Councillor at the Embassy in Madrid and he took up that post in late 1906. While in Madrid he negotiated the purchase of land at the corner of calle de Núñez de Balboa and calle de Hermosilla for a British Embassy Church. Building did not start until 1923, and it was dedicated as the Church of St George in 1925. In 1910 Grant Duff was appointed Minister to Venezuela, but he did not take up the post; he was Consul-General to the Kingdom of Hungary, in Budapest, 1911–13 before his final post as British Envoy to the Swiss Confederation, 1913–16. He was appointed CMG in 1911 and knighted KCMG in 1916 on the termination of his mission in Berne. In 1900 he married Edith Florence Bonham, elder daughter of Sir George Bonham, 2nd Baronet (who was British Envoy to the Swiss Confederation, 1905–09). She was appointed a Lady of Grace of the Order of St John of Jerusalem in 1916 and CBE in 1918 as \"Founder and Organiser of the Bread Bureau for Prisoners of War.\" She founded the \"British Legation Red Cross Organization\" through which the many British expatriates in Switzerland helped wounded soldiers in French and British hospitals."

  "text" : "Eugen von Bamberger (5 September 1858 – October 1921) was an Austrian internist born in Würzburg, Germany. He was the son of pathologist Heinrich von Bamberger (1822–1888). He studied medicine at the Universities of Vienna and Würzburg, receiving his doctorate in 1882. Afterwards he worked as an assistant to Hermann Nothnagel (1841–1905) at the Allgemeines Krankenhaus in Vienna. From 1891, he was a director of internal medicine at the Rudolfsspital. In 1889, he provided a detailed description of a condition that has become known as hypertrophic pulmonary osteoarthropathy. During the following year, French neurologist Pierre Marie (1853–1940) was able to differentiate the syndrome from acromegaly. The term \"Bamberger-Marie disease\" is sometimes used for hypertrophic pulmonary osteoarthropathy."

  "text" : "Steury was born in Berne, Indiana in 1930 to David and Mary Habegger Steury. In 1948, while attending a church service in his hometown, Steury became a Christian. Though he didn't know it at the time, that decision set his life on a course that would lead him far from the rural Indiana life he'd known. Steury's first step outside Indiana took him to Asbury College in Wilmore, Kentucky. He graduated from Asbury in 1953 and the following year married Jennie Sue Groce. Steury obtained a medical degree from Indiana University School of Medicine in 1957 and began an internship in tropical medicine at Gorgas Hospital, Panama. In 1956, while still a medical student, Steury signed on with World Gospel Mission and in 1959 was sent to the organization's mission station at Tenwek, Kenya. Begun in 1935 as an aide station, the Tenwek facility had grown into a medical dispensary and clinic, but Steury was the station's first physician. With Steury's leadership, the clinic developed into one of Kenya's largest missionary hospitals with outlying clinics that brought healthcare to the surrounding community. The facility attained a global reputation for its work. Steury died at Avon Park, Florida, in 2002."

  "text" : "Ermenegildo \"Gildo\" Gasperoni (August 4, 1906–June 26, 1994) was a Sammarinese politician. He served as the general secretary and, later, chairman of the Sammarinese Communist Party. Gasperoni was the son of an artisan from San Marino. In his youth, he left the country in 1924. He joined the French Communist Party in 1926. He was an activist of the Communist Party of Luxembourg between 1930 and 1936. He joined the International Brigades during the Spanish Civil War, serving as political commissar of the Garibaldi Battalion in the Twelfth International Brigade. He later shifted to serve as the political commissar of the international centre for recruiting and training volunteers. He returned to his homeland in 1940, beginning to work towards the foundation of the Sammarinese Communist Party. The Italian Communist Party had organized a local branch in San Marino in 1921, but the country did not have a communist party of its own. On July 7, 1941 the Sammarinese Communist Party was founded under Gasperoni's leadership. As of 1949, he was the Minister of Transport in the communist-socialist coalition government. Apart from his political labours, he also worked as an auto mechanic in Borgo Maggiore at this time. Gasperoni represented the Sammarinese Communist Party at different international events, such as the 1969 International Meeting of Communist and Workers Parties in Moscow and the 1976 Conference of Communist and Workers Parties of Europe in Berlin. At both of these events Gasperoni voiced criticisms against the policies of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. In 1978, Gasperoni was elected to serve a six-month term as one of the two Captains Regent (i.e., co-heads of state of San Marino), along with the socialist Adriano Reffi. With Gasperoni San Marino had a communist head of state for the first time in two decades. During a visit to the Soviet Union in January 1983, Gasperomi and the Sammarinese Communist Party general secretary Umberto Barulli were decorated with the Order of Friendship of Peoples at a ceremony in the Kremlin. As of the 1980s, Gasperoni had been named honorary chairman of the Sammarinese Communist Party."

  "text" : "Elmer Darwin Ball (21 September 1870 – 5 October 1943) was an American entomologist. Ball is known for his contributions to the knowledge of the leafhoppers, treehoppers, froghoppers, and other related insects. Born in Athens, Vermont, his family moved to Iowa shortly after, where Ball received his early education. He earned B.S. and M.S. degrees from Iowa State College in 1895 and 1898, respectively. Ball married Mildred R. Norvell in 1899. After a brief stint as a school teacher and then assistant principal of Albion Seminary, he began teaching zoology and entolomogy at Iowa State College, and then at Colorado Agricultural College. After this he became a Professor in the Utah Agricultural College, and commenced graduate work with Herbert Osborn as his mentor. Specializing in the biology of leafhoppers and related taxa, he received his Ph.D. from Ohio State University in 1907. That same year he became the dean of the Utah Agricultural College. In 1916, Ball became the state entomologist of Wisconsin for two years before returning to serve as the head of the department of zoology and entomology at Iowa State. Ball went on leave from Iowa State to serve as Assistant Secretary of Agriculture for two years, from 1920 until 1921. He was employed at the U.S. Department of Agriculture from 1921–1925 as the scientific research director. Following this, he worked for the Florida State Plant Board, where he researched insect pathogens of celery. In 1928, he was appointed dean of the College of Agriculture and director of the Agricultural Experiment Station at the University of Arizona, where he worked until illness prevented him from doing so. After suffering a cerebral hemorrhage in February, 1938, he went on extended leave. After five year of illness, Ball died on October 5, 1943, in Pasadena, California. His papers are held in the collection of the Smithsonian Institution Archives."

The Führer's corpse was, according to her own words, found by soldier Ivan Churakov on 4 May 1945. Four days later, on 8 May, Colonel Vassily Gorbushin gave her a small box that allegedly contained Hitler's jawbones. During the identification of the corpse, the Soviet team worked in top secret conditions. It consisted of only three people, Rzhevskaya being one of them. She and Gorbushin allegedly managed to find in Berlin, Käthe Heusermann, an assistant of Hugo Blaschke, Hitler's personal dentist. She confirmed the identity of the Nazi leader. The information was, however, suppressed by Joseph Stalin, who later ordered the facts not to be publicized."

He was involved in politics from early on, strongly identifying with the cause of the \"Uitlanders\" (English resident in the Boer republics). He even became a prominent member of the Reform Committee which sponsored the Jameson Raid in 1895. His involvement in this disastrous event led to his brief imprisonment in Pretoria. He became the first Chairman of the Responsible Government Association and eventually a member of Louis Botha’s Transvaal cabinet from 1907-1910. He was also elected to the Senate in the new united Republic of South Africa after Union. Edward was a member of a large and influential Cape family, of St Helenan Jewish descent. Members of the Solomon family were heavily involved in Cape politics, were physically all remarkably tiny, and included some of the greatest legal minds in southern Africa. The great Cape Colony politician Saul Solomon was Edward's uncle, and his brother was the Attorney General Sir Richard Solomon."

  "text" : "Edwin Kipyego (born 16 November 1990) is a Kenyan long-distance runner, best known for a series of victories, at the half marathon and 10K distances, in the United Kingdom and elsewhere. His personal best for the half marathon is 60:05 minutes. He first began to compete in European road races in 2009 and he placed in the top ten at that year's Hamburg Half Marathon. Having chosen to focus on the half marathon distance, he had his first road race victories in 2010. He won the Reading and Bristol Half Marathons and was runner-up in Cardiff and Nottingham. Moving on from his United Kingdom base, he won the 2011 Ribarroja Del Turia Half Marathon with a personal best of 61:23 minutes. He came close to that mark at the Nice Half Marathon (61:26) and was seventh at the Lille Half Marathon. In his eighth half marathon outing of the year, he retained his title in Bristol in September. He suffered an injury in October, but on his return in January 2012 he caused an upset at the Kenyan Discovery Half Marathon, beating Emmanuel Mutai and James Kwambai. He improved his best to 61:11 minutes with a runner-up performance at the Lago Maggiore Half Marathon in Italy then had his second career victory at the Reading Half Marathon. Kipyego incorporated 10K races into his schedule the following year and it proved to be a successful move. He won the British 10K London with a time of 27:49 minutes – making him the twelfth fastest in the world that year. His last two outings of the year also brought personal bests: he set a course record of 58:16 minutes at the Marseille-Cassis Classique Internationale and improved to 60:55 minutes to win the Delhi Half Marathon. Kipyego ran a personal best of one hour five seconds to win the CPC Loop Den Haag in March 2013."

  "text" : "Elvino Vardaro (18 June 1905, Buenos Aires - 5 August 1971,  Cordoba, Argentina) was an Argentine tango composer and violinist. Vardaro grew up in the Abasto neighborhood of Buenos Aires and at the age of four he began studying the violin. At the age fourteen he made his concert debut with a violin recital of classical music and whilst playing violin to accompany silent films he met the pianists Rodolfo Biagi and Luis Visca who played with him. In 1922 he joined the orquestra directed by Juan Maglio and later went on to play with the ensemble of the bandoneonist Paquito Bernardo. The following year he joined Roberto Firpo’s orchestra and played alongside the violinists Octavio Scaglione and Cayetano Puglisi with whom he would become close friends. In 1926 the bandoneonist Pedro Maffia left the orchestra of Julio De Caro and formed his own ensemble with Osvaldo Pugliese on piano, Pedro Maffia and Alfredo De Franco on bandoneons, Elvino Vardaro and Emilio Puglisi on violins and Francisco De Lorenzo on double bass. That same year Vardaro composed his first tango, Grito del alma.In 1929 he joined with Osvaldo Pugliese in forming the Vardaro-Pugliese Sextet that played together until 1931. Two years later he organised a sextet with Anibal Troilo and Jorge Argentino Fernandez on bandoneons, Hugo Baralis and Vardaro on violins, Pedro Carracciolo on double bass and Jose Pascual on piano. In 1935 he introduced a third bandoneonist Eduardo Marino and in 1937 the singers Francisco Alfredo Marino, Carlos Lafuente, Guillermo Arbos and Nelly de la Vega joined the ensemble which performed in cafes, cabarets and on the radio in Buenos Aires and in Montevideo in Uruguay. In 1938 he played with Lucio Demare in an ensemble which included the singer Juan Carlos Miranda and two pianos. After retiring to live in Cordoba he reappeared in 1941 to conduct the jazz orchestra Brighton Jazz, which performed on Radio El Mundo and in cafes and cabarets and recorded two works, one of which, Violinomania, was written by Argentino Galván and dedicated to Vardaro in tribute to his virtuosity. For several years he played in the orchestra of Joaquin Do Reyes and was heard on Radio El Mundo and during the 1940s and 1950s he appeared with the orchestras of Adolfo Perez, Osvaldo Fresedo and Fulvio Salamanca. In 1955 he joined Ástor Piazzolla’s Orquesta de Cuerdos and in 1961 moved to Piazzolla’s first Quinteto. During this same period he was also performing with the orchestra of Carlos Di Sarli. In the last years of his life he moved to Arguello, near the city of Cordoba, where he played in the provincial symphony orchestra until his death on 5 August 1971."

  "text" : "Emmanouil Dadaoglou (Greek: Εμμανουήλ Δαδάογλου) (died 1870) was a Greek anarchist and a central figure in the early era of Greek anarchism. Born in Smyrna, Dadaoglou was a trader. He probably acquired his anarchist ideas from Italian political refugees. In Paris he met with fellow anarchists Amilcare Cipriani and Pavlos Argyriadis. There they organized a group of European volunteers, anarchist and socialist, who took part in the riot against King Otto in Athens in 1862. Then, together with Plotinos Rodokanatis, Dadaoglou tried to organize an anarchist group in Athens, but failed. From 1864 to 1867, Dadaoglou lived in Naples, Italy where he took part in the activities of the International Working Men's Association (the First International). At this time he met Maria Pantazi, . They returned to Athens in an attempt to organize a new anarchist group without meeting any success. They lived together until Emmanouil's death in 1870."

  "text" : "Eugene de Salignac (1861–1943) was an American photographer who worked for the Department of Bridges/Plant and Structures in New York City. Born in Boston in 1861 into an eccentric family of exiled French nobility, de Salignac had no formal training in photography. In 1903, at the age of 42, his brother-in-law found him a job as an assistant to the photographer for the Department of Bridges, Joseph Palmer. After 3 years of apprenticeship, Palmer suddenly died, and in October 1906, de Salignac assumed his duties. As the sole photographer for the department from 1906 to 1934 (in 1916 it changed its name to the Department of Plant & Structures), he documented the creation of the city's modern infrastructure—including bridges, major municipal buildings, roads and subways. Most notably, he documented the construction of the Manhattan Bridge and the Queensboro Bridge, and the Manhattan Municipal Building but his most famous image is that of painters posing nonchalantly on the cables of the Brooklyn Bridge. Using a large-format camera and 8x10 inch glass-plate negatives, he shot over 20,000 images in his career. Most of these negatives and over 15,000 vintage prints are held by the New York City Municipal Archives. Into his 70s de Salignac was still climbing bridges and actively working, but he was forced to retire in 1934 despite a petition to Mayor La Guardia. In his lifetime de Salignac's work was little seen outside of New York City government, and his name was forgotten after his death in 1943. His images were rediscovered in the 1980s, but it was not until 1999 that an archivist realized the collection was mostly the work of one man. In 2007, Aperture published New York Rises, the first monograph of his work, which became a traveling exhibition that opened at the Museum of the City of New York. Since then, his photographs have been widely reproduced and are part of a growing interest in industrial photography that has been left out of the traditional photography canon."

  "text" : "Eline Hansen (1859-1919), was a Danish feminist and peace leader. Hansen was born Oct. 22, 1859 at Assens, the daughter of Christian Jacob Hansen (1832–80) and Johanne Margrethe Rasmussen (1822–91). In 1876-77 she was a student at N. Zahles privatlærerindekursus for governesses in Copenhagen; she graduated as a teacher in 1883 and worked as one at Aarhus højere Pigeskole in 1884-89, and at the public schools in Copenhagen in 1889-1910. Eline Hansen became interested in gender equality as a student, and during her career as a teacher she worked for equality between male and female students and teachers. Hansen became a pioneer in Denmark as a school kitchen inspector, when she was educated in this profession in Norway on the expense of the Danish government and employed as such in Copenhagen in 1897. In 1898, she petitioned the government with a demand to start professional university courses for cooks at school kitchens, which was granted and put in effect in 1899. She herself became a teacher at this course. Eline Hansen was a member of the Copenhagen School Direction in 1904-1910 and chairperson of the Copenhagen Public School Teacher's Association in 1905-1909. In 1908, she successfully managed to raise the salary for female teachers. Eline Hansen was an important member of the Danish women's movement. In 1886 she co-founded the local Århus section of the women's organisation Dansk Kvindesamfund (DK) and the contact between the section of Århus and Copenhagen. She was a member of the central comity of the DK in 1893-1903, and alongside chairperson Jutta Bojsen-Møller credited with preserving the DK in a difficult period of split of the Danish women's movement. In 1899, she co-founded the Dansk Kvinderaad, later Danske Kvinders Nationalråd (DKN). In 1915-16, she arranged demonstrations for poor housewives. She functioned as an interpreter at the International Woman Suffrage Alliance’s congress in Copenhagen in 1906. During World War I she managed to maintain contact between British and German women, and in 1915, she was a delegate in the international women's peace conference in the Hague. Upon her return, she co-founded the peace movement Danske Kvinders Fredskæde, later Kvindernes Internationale Liga for Fred og Frihed, with Thora Daugaard, Clara Tybjerg, Louise Wright and Eva Moltesen. She was also active in the struggle for women suffrage, and chairperson of one of the Danish suffrage movements. In 1918, the fist election after women suffrage, she was nominated for parliament, but did not became elected."

Brenner was born in Isokyrö, and at the age of 17 was studying archeology where he later became involved in the antiquities trade. Brenner's study of antiquities led him to create art himself, and he worked as a portrait miniature painter and numismatist. In 1690 he married the Swedish writer, poet, and hostess Sophia Elisabet Brenner. He died in Stockholm in 1717. In 1691 his great work on Swedish coins Thesaurus nummorum Sveo-Gothicorum was printed. In the following year on a limited scale it began to be spread by the government as a gift to dignitaries and professionals. Its reception was very good and the book was mentioned with praise in foreign press. Brenner was appointed an extraordinary member of the Swedish Antiquities College in 1692 and received a considerable annual subsidy for his job of \"further elaboration and perfection\". The following year he was appointed Assessor there with a government salary. A new amended edition of Thesaurus was issued fourteen years after Brenner's death by Nils Piping. The number of images had then increased from 431 to 574, and histories of Swedish coin collectors and their collections had been added."

The attractive young woman quickly advanced to main roles alongside Gustav Fröhlich and Hans Albers. After singing lessons, she was committed in 1931 as a soubrette at the Grosses Schauspielhaus in Berlin.However, the Nazi takeover ended her film career after six successful years, since she was allegedly half-Jewish. Holt was prohibited from appearing in films. She still enjoyed engagements as a soubrette at the Komische Oper in Berlin. When Jewish publisher Felix Guggenheim (1904-1976) married her in 1936, it was no longer possible. In 1938 the couple emigrated first to Switzerland, then in 1940 to England, and later to the United States. There Felix Guggenheim was exile publisher of authors such as Thomas Mann, Franz Werfel, Lion Feuchtwanger and Alfred Doblin.Evelyn Holt remained until the end of her life in the U.S. and never returned to movies."

Christensen was born in Redding, California. After working as a grocery checker for the Raley's Superstore Chain, he worked in a series of odd jobs until landing at George Lucas' Industrial Light & Magic (ILM)in 1999. While working there, Christensen coined the phrase \"Hard Surface Roto\" as well as \"Organic Roto\" which used advanced tracking techniques to proceduralize the normally slow process of rotoscoping. With over twenty feature films under his belt, Christensen quit ILM to form his own company, \"RotoFactory\" in 2006 to offer other visual effects shops in the United States an opportunity to keep their 2D outsourcing domestic. In 2010, Christensen expanded into New Orleans, Louisiana, to offer expanded services to the major motion picture studios as well as a 30% tax incentive allowed by the state of Louisiana. Christensen's Factory VFX also began training programs to assist New Orleans residents in developing a new industry, working with both government programs and local city non-profits, Factory VFX is helping revitalize a city stricken with natural and man-made disasters. Aside from his Visual Effects film-work, Christensen also runs three additional companies all under the banner of Christensen Media Services that includes television production, digital and print publications."

Bridgeman moved to Wigan, Lancashire, when his older brother John, later Bishop of Chester, became Rector of the parish in 1616. He was a law student, listed as a member of Grays Inn in 1624, and became a Justice of the Peace (JP) for the county of Lancaster in 1628, although he was a poor attender at quarter sessions and there was an attempt to remove him from the bench in 1638 after a serious brawl. In 1625, he was elected Member of Parliament for Wigan. He was elected MP for Liverpool in 1626. In 1628 he was elected MP for Wigan again and sat until 1629 when King Charles decided to rule without parliament for eleven years. Bridgeman was twice married. His married firstly, on 30 June 1627, Elenor, daughter of Sir Richard Brooke of Little Sankey, Cheshire, but the marriage was childless and she died in 1638. He remarried to Anne, daughter of Sir Hugh Chamberlaine of Chester; with her he had one daughter and also acquired a house at Sankey Bridge, Warrington. Bridgeman supported the Royalist cause at the outbreak of the English Civil War, as result of which his house was captured by Roundhead troops in 1643 and he was fined £100 as a Royalist 'delinquent'. He died a prisoner of parliament while being escorted to London in 1646. He left his widow, who remarried and lived until 1685, and his only daughter who married Sir John Edgeworth. Bridgeman was uncle of Sir Orlando Bridgeman, 1st Baronet, of Great Lever who was ancestor of the Earls of Bradford."

After a theological education, Rumi turned to Sufism under the guidance of Haji Bayram Veli. Later, he founded the Eshrefiye branch of the Kadiri dervishes. Rumi wrote in Turkish. While he is known for his Divan and Muzakki-l-nufus, he wrote many books such as Tarîkatnâme, Fütüvvetnâme, Delâil ün nübüvve, İbretnâme, Mâziretnâme, Hayretnâme, Elestnâme, Nasîhatnâme, Esrarüttâlibîn, Münâcaatnâme and Tâcnâme.

  "text" : "Edmund Kesting (27 July 1892, Dresden – 21 October 1970, Birkenwerder) was a German photographer, painter and art professor. He studied until 1916 at the Dresden Academy of Fine Arts before participating as a soldier in the First World War, upon returning his painting teachers were Richard Müller and Otto Gussmann and in 1919 he began to teach as a professor at the private school Der Weg. In 1923 he had his first exposition in the gallery Der Sturm in which he showed photograms. When Der Weg opened a new academy in Berlin in 1927, he moved to the capital. He formed relations with other vanguardists in Berlin and practiced various experimental techniques such as solarization, multiple images and photograms, for which reason twelve of his works were considered degenerate art by the Nazi regime and were prohibited. Among the artists with whom he interacted are Kurt Schwitters, László Moholy-Nagy, El Lissitzky and Alexander Archipenko. At the end of World War II he formed part of a Dresden artistic group known as Künstlergruppe der ruf - befreite Kunst (Call to an art in freedom) along with Karl von Appen, Helmut Schmidt-Kirstein and Christoph Hans, among others. In this city he made an experimental report named Dresdner Totentanz (Dance of death in Dresden) as a condemnation of the bombing of the city. In 1946 he was named a member of the Academy of Art in the city. He participated in the controversy between socialist realism and formalism that took place in the German Democratic Republic, therefore his work was not realist and could not be shown in the country between 1949 and 1959. In 1955 he began to experiment with chemical painting, making photographs without the use of a camera and only with the use of chemical products such as the developer and the fixer and photographic paper, for which he made exposures to light using masks and templates. Between 1956 and 1967 he was a professor at the Academy of Cinema and Television of Potsdam. His artistic work was not recognized by the authorities of the German Democratic Republic until 1980, ten years after his death."

  "text" : "Eric Selbin is a political scientist whose primary research interests are revolutions and related forms of collective behavior (resistance, rebellion, social movements) as well as International Relations Theory. Much of his work has focused on Latin America and the Caribbean, and his volume on Modern Latin American Revolutions is frequently used as a textbook in courses in Latin American Studies and contentious politics. He holds a PhD from the University of Minnesota and is Professor of Political Science at Southwestern University in Georgetown, Texas, where he has also been appointed a University Scholar. In 2013, Selbin was appointed a research fellow at the Teresa Lozano Long Institute of Latin American Studies (LLILAS) at the University of Texas at Austin and he has held appointments at Sweden’s Umeå University (2003-2006) and at the Tallinn Postgraduate Summer School in Social and Cultural Studies (2012). In 2014, he was appointed to the Lucy King Brown Chair, one of six endowed, Brown Chairs at Southwestern University. Selbin's most well-known work is Revolution, Rebellion, Resistance: The Power of Story (2010), which puts forth four different types of \"revolutionary story\" that have accompanied revolutionary struggles from the French Revolution to the present day: Civilizing and Democratizing, The Social Revolution, Freedom and Liberation and The Lost and Forgotten. For Selbin, these narratives, conducted across time and space through processes of myth, memory and mimesis, are the crucible of revolutionary action. Selbin has also collaborated on topics related to homeschooling and feminism with Helen Cordes, the writer and editor to whom he is married, and their two daughters."

After losing the case three years later, she co-founded the diversity consulting business Project Include. In 2015, unpopular decisions made during Pao's tenure at Reddit generated a wave of controversy that culminated in her stepping down. The backlash she received sparked debates both on the treatment of women in technology and the need for transparency in a company that relies on volunteers."

  "text" : "Edgardo Fulgencio (29 October 1917 – 28 October 2004) is a Filipino former basketball player who competed in the 1948 Summer Olympics. Ding, as he is called by his friends before he was teased 'kalembang', started his basketball career in 1933 at the age of 16. Fulgencio transferred to Jose Rizal College and made the team in 1937. Then came the last war and at the age of 24, Ding was recruited by Skip Guinto, son of then Mayor Leon Guinto to join the Manila Flatties team along with Bobby Jones, Totong Martinez, Franco Marquicias, Felicisimo Fajardo and Guinto himself. It was a strong team that ruled all tournaments in Manila during the Japanese Occupation. In 1946, Fulgencio joined the famed Maurice Enterprise squad and his team won their first MICAA championship by defeating the star-studded Sampaguita Pictures quintet. Ding rejoined the Heavy Bombers in 1947 in his ambition to get a degree. By 1948, JRC coach Mateo Adao has moulded a fighting team that captured the NCAA title after a 15-year campaign. The championship was the stepping stone for Ding to make the 1948 London Olympics. Came 1949, Fulgencio was not qualified anymore to play in the NCAA and he went to Far Eastern University but had to undergo the one-year residence, so in the meantime, he played for Heacock's in the MICAA under his tutor, Franco Marquicias. Fulgencio helped power the FEU Tamaraws to the 1950 UAAP championship. The Tams won the opener and in the second game, FEU coach Martin Dino fielded Fulgencio, who was also a playmaker, as a forward. When Ding got his commerce degree in 1952, he announced his retirement and transferred from the court to the bench and mentored the Tamaraws to second place in the UAAP that year."

His brother was the well-known \"blind naturist\" Clarence Hawkes of Massachusetts. E. W. Hawkes studied at Dakota Wesleyan University (1909) and Pennsylvania University (1913, 1915). Over the course of multiple trips to Alaska and northern Canada, Hawkes gathered data for his books. His 1914 publication Dance Festivals of the Alaskan Eskimo was based on the three years Hawkes spent in the Bering Strait District, including on the Diomede Islands and at St. Michael. It was while stationed at St. Michael as a government teacher over the winter of 1911-1912 that Hawkes observed the traditional Inuit \"Messenger Feast\", which he recounted in his 1913 Inviting In. His 1916 The Labrador Eskimo was based on his experiences in summer 1914 with the Geological Survey of Canada in the Hudson Bay area. Hawkes held a variety of university fellowships in Anthropology, including Columbia University (1913–1914). and Harrison College (1914–1916)."

In the presidential campaign, Fehrnstrom sparred frequently on Twitter with David Axelrod, top adviser to President Barack Obama. The web site Politico named Fehrnstrom one of 50 \"People to Watch\" in 2012 Fehrnstrom is married, he and his wife Kathy have two children and live in Brookline, Massachusetts."

  "text" : "Edwin Gariguez is a Filipino religious leader and environmentalist. He was awarded the Goldman Environmental Prize in 2012, for his voicing of protests on behalf of indigenous communities against large scale mining projects in the Philippines. Edwin Gariguez is the current Executive Secretary of National Secretariat for Social Action (NASSA), the advocacy and social development arm of the Catholic Bishops’ Conference of the Philippines (CBCP). He was ordained to the Catholic priesthood on April 1, 1993, committing himself to serve in the local Church of Calapan in Oriental Mindoro. Along with the challenge of seriously pursuing the agenda for being Church of the Poor, he led the program for the major sectoral block of disadvantaged peasantry by organizing Peasant Empowerment and Advocacy Network (Peasant-Net), a provincial federation of poor farmers. From 1999 to 2001, he seriously took the challenge of the campaign for transformative politics, by accepting the position of Executive Secretary to the Municipal Mayor of Victoria, Oriental Mindoro. After his tenure in the local government, he worked full-time for the Mangyan Mission, a Church-based NGO promoting the rights of the indigenous communities. As Advocacy Officer for the Mangyan Mission he ran campaign programs, and empowered leaders and IP communities to take action and effect collaborative partnerships to address critical issues affecting them, particularly their security for ancestral domain claim, and in promoting participatory and self-determined development programs for the Mangyan indigenous communities. He was also engaged establishing linkages with other partner-organizations, on the national and international level to protect the rights of the indigenous peoples. With the aggressive promotion of mining in the Philippines, he was challenged to work with the indigenous communities in pursuing their right to self-determination and in ensuring that their rights are respected as provided in the Indigenous Peoples Rights Act of 1997. Part of this campaign is to oppose the incursion of transnational mining companies to the ancestral lands of the indigenous peoples and in critical ecosystems. Large-scale mining, specifically the proposed Mindoro Nickel Project of Intex Resources, threatens the very survival of the indigenous peoples because a big part of the mining tenement overlaps with the ancestral domains of Alangan and Tadyawan tribes. In 2005 he took up masteral course in Sociology-Anthropology from Ateneo de Manila University, but he later decided to transfer to Asian Social Institute (ASI) to enroll for the Doctoral Program on Applied Cosmic Anthropology (ACA). The ACA Program gives emphasis on the application of knowledge and research to the concrete social realities that students face as catalyst of development or as agents of change. Gariguez obtained his PhD degree in Anthropology from the Asian Social Institute in 2008. His dissertation expounds on the ecological spirituality of the indigenous peoples in Mindoro as a practical framework and alternative paradigm for sustainable development and well-being. After his studies in Asian Social Institute, he went back to his work in Mindoro. His engagement in addressing mining-related issues and campaigns is extensive. He is one of the founding members of ALAMIN (Alyansa Laban sa Mina), a provincial alliance of church, local government and civil society organizations in the island of Mindoro that waged a decade of sustained advocacy to protect the rights of the Indigenous Peoples and peasant communities to be impacted by extractive industry. At the national level, Gariguez is one of the convenors and current member of the Council of Leaders of Alyansa Tigil Mina (ATM), a country-wide coalition of organizations and individuals from mining-affected communities, NGOs, POs, Church-based organizations and academic institutions that was formed in 2004. ATM serves as a watchdog that actively engages and challenges the Government, international finance corporations, transnational mining corporations and other key players to expose their wrongdoings and failures of laws and policies in the mining industry. In November 2009, Gariguez, together with 25 members of ALAMIN launched a hunger strike before the Department of Environment and Natural Resources to protest the flawed and questionable issuance of Environmental Compliance Certificate (ECC) to the Norwegian mining company. And this effort to pressure the national government was successful and further investigation of the anomalous ECC was ordered to be conducted on the ground. The arena of struggle for anti-mining campaign relies not only on the strength of local victories. Since the issue and the new hierarchy of power have assumed global character, the campaign necessarily has to assume global engagement. To this end, Gariguez embarked on several international lobbying and advocacy campaigns in Oslo, London and other parts of Europe. Most recently, in October 2011, Gariguez participated on policy and performance standard review of World Bank and International Finance Corporation in October 2010, wherein ALAMIN’s experience on asserting free, prior and informed consent of the indigenous peoples was presented in a panel discussion in World Bank Headquarters in Washington DC. In one of his research works on mining issues, Gariguez collaborated with Clive Wicks and Robert Goodland in doing a case study on Mindoro and the impact of mining on agriculture and food security. The published work is entitled “Philippines: Mining or Food.” The full report, along with case study summaries, is available here: . On April 2010, Gariguez was appointed as Executive Secretary of National Secretariat for Social Action (NASSA, a development office under the Catholic Bishops’ Conference of the Philippines (CBCP). NASSA acts as a secretariat to the social action centers of the different dioceses all over the country. The network tries to serve the Church in its mission to be truly a Church of the Poor, implementing concrete programs and addressing pressing issues concerning the voiceless sectors and the less-privileged. NASSA, since its foundation in 1966, has been committed to carry out its mandate by underpinning sustainable development and social transformation efforts through development programs and projects that are designed to benefit the disadvantaged and the oppressed. NASSA is also mandated to assume the role of the national Caritas organization, being the CARITAS PHILIPPINES. NASSA/Caritas Philippines is the social development, humanitarian and advocacy arm of the Catholic Church in the Philippines. As such, it pursues a trilogy of missions. As the social development arm, NASSA commits to initiating and supporting sustainable development programs and services for the Diocesan Social Action Centers (DSACs) and marginalized groups. As the humanitarian and emergency response arm, NASSA commits to capacitating DSACs and mobilizing resources for disaster preparedness, relief and rehabilitation in the context of emergencies. As the advocacy arm, NASSA commits to promoting social consciousness and faith-driven collective action of the social action network for social, environmental and political issues and concerns of the poor."

One of the group designated by the press the 'Bright Young People' in the 1920s, he shared a flat at 39 Maddox Street in London with Brian Howard, which was so run-down that fungus grew on the dilapidated staircase. Although he was a respected antiquarian, specialising in 18th century literature, and worked for the booksellers Elkin Mathews, he remained impecunious, largely living off his elder brother, Lord Cranbrook. He also worked at various colleges and for the British Council After 1935, he lived in Athens, Cairo and Lebanon, returning to England in the late 1960s in poor health.

He received a master's degree from Guelph and the University of Toronto and a doctorate from Cornell. His 1955 thesis was \"studies on ascorbic acid synthesis in apple leaves\" (Cornell: 1955, 304 pages). In 1960, while working for the Canadian Department of Agriculture in Ottawa (Agriculture Canada), he developed a process of making instant mashed potato flakes, and filed a patent on the process (Canadian patent 3260607, July 1966). The product reached the market in 1962. Another of his inventions at the time was an infrared apple peeler. He later worked for the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, moving to Italy where he became chief of the technical division, an important component of the Green Revolution. He retired in 1985. He has 5 children, two girls and three boys."

  "text" : "Edward Del Castillo is the Founder, Executive President, and Chief Creative Officer of Liquid Entertainment. Prior to founding Liquid, he served as Senior Producer for Lord British Studios and Firaxis within Origin Systems. There he created, developed, and produced the first three-dimensional Ultima game, advised on Ultima Online, and produced Sid Meier's Gettysburg!. Within Lord British Studios, he pioneered and managed the transition from two dimensional gaming to three dimensions, including creating the design, art and code pipelines necessary to transition the entire department from two- to three-dimensional gaming. Prior to his work at Origin, Mr. Del Castillo worked at Westwood Studios, where he served as the producer on the original Command & Conquer: Tiberian Dawn, and Red Alert, along with several expansions, ports, and other projects. On Command & Conquer and Red Alert, he was the primary creative and managerial force responsible for the creation, design, and production of all aspects of these titles. Under his supervision, these genre creating titles went on to become some of the most well awarded titles in gaming history. Mr. Del Castillo’s deep understanding of game design has led him to be well published throughout the industry. As founder, president and chief creative officer of Liquid Entertainment, Del Castillo's first game was Battle Realms, published by Crave Entertainment and Ubisoft in November 2001 to critical acclaim. Battle Realms is a real-time strategy PC game for Windows that features an unconventional approach to resource management and unit development. It was well received by reviewers, many of whom praised its at-the-time state of the art 3D engine and East Asian-inspired setting and aesthetics. It was nominated Best PC Strategy game of 2002 by The Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences, and was chosen for Computer Gaming World's Top 10 Games of E3 2001. Liquid Entertainment has since released multiple next-gen console titles and also mobile, social and casual games to critical success in its 15+ years in business. These titles include intellectual properties of The Lord of the Rings, ABC's Desperate Housewives, Marvel Comics' Thor and the Dungeons and Dragons series. Del Castillo holds a bachelor's degree in economics from the University of California, San Diego. He has one son resulting from his marriage with Carmen Del Castillo, his current wife. In late 2014 he conducted an experimental Kickstarter campaign for a digital card game in the Battle Realms universe called Battle Realms Legends to gauge interest. The Kickstarter didn't go through, so Ed and Liquid redirected their efforts back towards the original Battle Realms game. Most recently, Battle Realms has been greenlit on Steam and is in the process of being converted to run on Steam and GOG Galaxy."

  "text" : "Enrico Costa (born 1944 in Sassari, Sardinia) is an Italian astrophysicist, known for studies of gamma ray bursts (GRBs). Costa's family moved in 1954 to Rome, where he spent the remainder of his childhood and adolescence and studied physics. For his PhD with Giulio Auriemma, he participated in rocket experiments with X-ray detectors at the IAS (Istituto di Astrofisica Spaziale) in Rome. In 1976, he joined the IAS and worked on balloon experiments. Later he was involved in BeppoSAX, the Italian X-ray astronomy satellite (with Dutch participation, and ESA support), which operated from 1996 to 2003. Costa was in 1981 part of the team of Livio Scarsi, which proposed the construction of the satellite for X-ray detection. On the satellite was a Phoswich Detector System (PDS) used by Filippo Frontera for the discovery of gamma ray bursts (i.e., the PDS was a Gamma Ray Burst Monitor, GRBM). February 28, 1997 was the first time an X-ray afterglow associated with a GRB was observed after localization by SAX, followed shortly thereafter by the optical afterglow (observed by Herschel and Isaac Newton telescopes, La Palma). Two months later, another GRB was detected with subsequent observation in the radio range, thus directly demonstrating by the redshift that GRBs are of extragalactic origin. In 1999, he developed the X-ray detector for the Italian X-ray/gamma-ray satellites AGILE, which started in 2007. He also developed X-ray polarimeters. Enrico Costa is the author or co-author of a number of papers in peer reviewed scientific journals. Several are published in Science Magazine. Also, in 2011 he received with Gerald J. Fishman the Shaw Prize."

In 1576, together with Philip de Lalaing (1537-1582), his half-brother and stadtholder of Hainault, he joined the States-General of the Netherlands against Spain. In the Pacification of Ghent, 16 of the Seventeen Provinces made an alliance to drive out the mutinying Spanish troops. Emanuel became an army commander in the States army until he was decisively beaten in the Battle of Gembloux (1578) (31 januari 1578).After this defeat, he became a leader of the Malcontents in Hainault. Ha had his own army with which he fought against the Calvinists which ruled Flanders at that time, and took Menen. Finally Emanuel reconciled with the King of Spain and his Governor Alexander Farnese, Duke of Parma. He signed the Union of Arras in 1579 and became stadtholder of Hainault. He was also made Admiral of Flanders and Knight in the Order of the Golden Fleece. Emanuel served Farnese during many sieges in Flanders and Brabant, until he was wounded during the siege of Corbeil.

Cobb and offered to draw caricatures of the famous patrons who dined at the restaurant. In a very short time, Eddie had drawn hundreds of pictures of Hollywood stars and the Brown Derby became famous for the caricatures which adorned it walls. For aspiring actors, having their caricature on the walls of the Brown Derby meant they had finally 'made it' in Hollywood. For Eddie Vitch it was to become his ticket into the world of entertainment. By the 1940s, Eddie had created a comedy mime act and was traveling the world in variety theater alongside some very famous stars such as Edith Piaf, Maurice Chevalier and Josephine Baker. His career took off during the 40s and 50s and he performed with the Folies Bergère, Paris, in the Berlin Wintergarten theatre, the Hippodrome, London and the Tivoli Gardens in Copenhagen. He went on to perform his comedy shows on TV and had guest appearances in several movies. In 1966, he retired from theater life and moved to Australia."

  "text" : "Edward Betham (1707–1783) was a scholar and divine and was educated at Eton college, and in 1728 proceeded to King's College, Cambridge. He became a fellow of King's College in 1731, and was also for some time bursar. He was subsequently presented by the provost and fellows to the living of Greenford, in Middlesex. He was appointed one of the preachers at Whitehall, and in 1771 the provost and fellows of Eton elected him to a vacant fellowship. Betham appears to have impressed his contemporaries equally by his learning and his benevolence. 'His fortune was not large, yet his liberality kept more than equal pace with it, and pointed out objects to which it was impossible for his nature to resist lending his assistance.'In 1780 Betham founded and endowed a charity school in his own parish of Greenford, having previously erected a schoolhouse there. The schoolhouse known as Betham House, which is now a residential property, still bears a Latin inscription alluding to his generosity towards his parish. He gave 2,000l. for the better maintaining of the botanical garden at Cambridge. His affection for Eton was strikingly manifested in his will. He directed a marble statue of Henry VI to be prepared and erected at a cost of 700l. The statue was entrusted to the well-known sculptor Bacon, and it now stands in the chapel of Eton College, bearing the inscription : 'Posuit Edvardus Betham, collegii hujusce socius.' The king holds a model of the college in his hand. A bust of Henry was also given to the college library by Betham, and other benefactions are associated with his name. Betham died in 1783 and buried in the grounds of the Holy Cross church where he had been the Rector."

Best known as an antiquary and book collector, Bolkhovitinov came from a generation of learned Orthodox monks formed by the Russian Enlightenment. The son of a Voronezh priest, Bolkhovitinov attended the Slavic Greek Latin Academy and the Moscow University. As a young man he made his living by translating French books for the Novikov printing house. After his wife died, Bolkhovitinov took the tonsure in 1800 and was made a bishop 4 years later. While living in Novgorod between 1804 and 1808, he published the charter of Mstislav the Great and studied the crypt of the Yuriev Monastery. Though amateur, his archaeological and palaeographical work was highly regarded by a circle of antiquaries close to Count Nikolai Rumyantsev. He also gained the friendship of poet Gavrila Derzhavin, who addressed to him a lengthy idyll, Life in Zvanka (one of the best known poems in the language). After arriving in Kiev in 1822, Bolkhovitinov resumed his scholarly pursuits. He was responsible for the excavations of the long-demolished Golden Gate and the Church of the Tithes. He assembled a large collection of manuscripts, developed an interest in the history of church music, and compiled the first comprehensive guide to Russian secular writers. During the Decembrist Revolt he went to Senate Square and urged the rebels to lay down arms. He was buried in the Saint Sophia Cathedral in Kiev."

He was drafted into the Soviet Army in 1941 and sent to the front to fight against Nazi Germany. A year later he was severely wounded and captured by German soldiers. After spending a few months in the POW camp Enver Galim was released. Fearing repression in Stalinist Russia, he decided to stay in Germany. To avoid deportation, he applied for Turkish citizenship and after receiving it, changed his name to Enver Galimoglu. After the war, he continued his career as a journalist, writing articles for the magazine Azad Vatan and other publications. Between 1953 and 1988 Ebver Galim worked for the Tatar-Bashkir Service of Radio Liberty. After 1968 he was Radio Liberty's correspondent based in New York. He contributed numerous articles and analyses to Problems of the Peoples of the USSR, the Turkish-language magazine Dergi and the Russian-language newspaper Vestnik.

While his career in Ireland was a brief one , lasting only about a year, he remains notable as having been the first Master of the Rolls in Ireland. He derived his name from his birthplace of Grimsby, Lincolnshire. It is very likely that he spent his last years there: certainly he retained close links with the town throughout his life, building several houses and endowing a chantry there. He was parish priest of East Keal in 1322 and of Preston in 1325; he also held the Scottish living of Moffat. In later life he received several further clerical preferments, notably as prebendary of St. Paul's Cathedral. In 1330, he was referred to as a royal clerk. In 1333 it was decided that the Lord Chancellor of Ireland required a Keeper or Master of the Rolls to assist him. Grimsby was chosen to be the first Master: he did go to Ireland but returned to England a year later. He resumed his English position as a clerk in Chancery and had custody of the Great Seal in 1340 and 1351. He died in 1354."

  "text" : "Edward S. Stephens (c. 1849 – September 30, 1909) was an educator in the United States in the late 19th century. He was the first principal of the Catholic Hill School, the first public school for African Americans in Asheville, North Carolina. During his time in Asheville, Stephens and other prominent African American citizens, with the support of heir and philanthropist George Washington Vanderbilt II, established the Young Men's Institute, modeled after the Young Men's Christian Association. Asheville's noted Stephens-Lee High School (now Stephens-Lee Recreation Center), the successor to the Catholic Hill School, which burned down in 1917, was partially named after Stephens. Stephens and Elizabeth \"Izie\" Reddick, a teacher at Catholic Hill, moved to Topeka, Kansas, in 1895, where they married and started the Topeka Industrial Institute, which later became the Kansas Vocational Institute, with a campus ultimately comprising over 100 acres. It is now the site of the state's women's prison, the Topeka Correctional Facility. The Stephenses moved to Bridgeport, Connecticut, in 1900, where they continued teaching. Edward died of tuberculosis September 30, 1909, and was buried in Mountain Grove Cemetery. Izie lived another 34 years. In her widowhood, she was active in Bridgeport's Phillis Wheatley branch of the Young Women's Christian Association."
