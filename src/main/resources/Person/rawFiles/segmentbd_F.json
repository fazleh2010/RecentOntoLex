  "text" : "Sister Francella Mary Griggs, S.N.J.M., (February 5, 1920 – January 7, 2012) was a Native American member of the Sisters of the Holy Names of Jesus and Mary and a leading advocate of the Confederated Tribes of Siletz Indians of Oregon. She successfully advocated for the restoration of federal recognition of the Confederated Tribes of Siletz Indians. The tribe regained federal recognition in 1977. Sister Francella was born Florence Griggs on February 5, 1920, to Lloyd Manley and Amanda West Griggs. She graduated from St. Mary School in Medford, Oregon. The oldest of two sisters, Grigg's parents both died when she was young. She and her sister were raised at the Christie School, as the school is now called, in Marylhurst, Oregon, by the Sisters of the Holy Names of Jesus and Mary. Griggs entered the Sisters of the Holy Names of Jesus and Mary and took her vows on February 5, 1943, which was her 23rd birthday. She completed bachelor's degrees in English and Spanish. Sister Francella then taught at high schools throughout the Pacific Northwest, including Holy Names Academy in Seattle, Holy Names Academy in Spokane, Sacred Heart Academy in Salem, Oregon, St. Mary's High School in Eugene, Oregon, Star of the Sea in Astoria, Oregon, and St. Mary's Academy in Portland, Oregon. Griggs began focusing on Native American issues beginning in the late 1960s. She joined a commission to restore federal recognition of the Confederated Tribes of Siletz Indians, which she and her family were members. She collaborated with several Oregon United States representatives for federal recognition, which was restored in 1977. She became a professor at the Indian Center of Eastern Oregon State College, now known Eastern Oregon University, in La Grande, Oregon. She also served as the executive director of the Portland Urban Indian Program. Griggs died on January 7, 2012, at the Marie-Rose Center at Mary's Woods in Lake Oswego, Oregon, at the age of 91. She was the oldest member of the Confederated Tribes of Siletz Indians at the time. Her Mass of Christian Burial was held at the Mary’s Woods Provincial House Chapel in Lake Oswego and she was buried in a family plot on the Siletz Indian reservation."

  "text" : "Filips van Zuylen was a Dutch corsair active in the 1620s. As part of the Groot Desseyn plan, he was particularly active against the Portuguese in West Africa but failed to capture the colony of Luanda, an important center for the Atlantic slave trade, in early 1624. After this initial defeat he decided to wait for reinforcements from Brazil before making a second attempt, this time with fellow corsair Piet Heyn, in October of that same year. While approaching from the south Heyn missed van Zuylen's 3-ship squadron, waiting to the north of Loanda, and decided to go ahead with the attack on his own. Heyn's fleet suffered a disastrous defeat as a result. Many of his ships became stuck in the shallows just outside Loanda and, when other ships stopped to free them, made easy targets for the Portuguese cannons. Heyn quickly realized that his seven ships could not breach the colony's heavily defended fortifications. Following a failed nighttime sortie against Portuguese merchant ships moored in the harbor, he ordered a withdrawal and the Dutch corsair fleet retreated back to friendly ports."

  "text" : "Early in his engineering career, Hall focused on experimental typefaces, typesetting, type design, and display configurations with ink on paper and metal placings. His first showing of his inventions occurred at the Chicago World Fair in which he displayed his newly invented and developed, stereotyper, in 1893. His technical innovations spawned a pioneering of non-impressed metal holdings, which led to the termed, \"Battle of the Dots\", between the traditional New York Point and his typographic structure. He adapted the stereotyper and Braille writer, subsequently creating a new precedent for blind education and information technology. It quickly spread around the country and was established on a global scale soon after. He went on become successful academic administrator in Illinois and served as the Superintendent of the Illinois Institution for the Blind He wrote numerous publications on mathematics and structural theory that were widely used in the United States during the 1890s and 1910s. In total he has published 20 widely circulated mathematical and structural studies and textbooks. He served as the official Illinois state delegate to the Farmers' National Congress in 1908 and the National Farm Land Congress in 1909, and was a member of the National Conservation Commission. He later founded the first boarding school for the blind in the United States. He was widely known for his publications of Hall's Mathematical Series, an established educational series on algebraic manipulation and arithmetic."

In 1923, she became the first woman to graduate in architecture from the Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich where she studied under Karl Coelestin Moser. After working with Pfleghard & Haefeli in Zurich, she married Rudolf Steiger in 1924 and established her own firm with him in Riehen, moving to Zurich the following year. Their first project, the Sandreuter House in Riehen (1924), is considered to be the first Modernist house in Switzerland. Steiger-Crawford went on to design individual houses while developing modern furniture, including a stackable metal chair for the Zett House in Zurich (1932). In 1930, she turned to sculpture, terminating her architectural activities in 1938. From 1938, she was a member of the Swiss Association of Female Artists and Sculptors."

  "text" : "Frank Worth (1923 - 2000) was an American photographer who befriended and photographed many Hollywood actors and actresses between 1939 and 1964. His black and white candid pictures are unusual for the era, when most stars limited themselves to carefully posed glamour portraits. He kept many of his photographs private so that they were not seen until after his death. He was rumored to have been intimate with several of his subjects including Marilyn Monroe and Jayne Mansfield; he confirmed his affair with Monroe shortly before his death. Worth was born in New York City. He became interested in photography in high school. Moving to Hollywood, he was hired to photograph movie stars but quickly became a freelance photographer. He made friends with Rudy Vallee and his wife, who allowed him to live with them and introduced him to other stars. Among his early subjects was Rita Hayworth, then an unknown starlet. Worth became a friend of numerous well known actors and actresses including James Dean, Marilyn Monroe, Frank Sinatra, James Cagney and Pat O'Brien. These friendships plus \"a knack for being in the right place at the right time\" allowed him to capture unique images of the stars. He was allowed onto the set of classic films such as Rebel Without A Cause and The Seven Year Itch. He filmed Elizabeth Taylor's first wedding. He also did sports photography and was the original photographer for the Los Angeles Dodgers. He gradually gave up photography and fell into poverty, but he refused to sell the photographs of the people who had been his friends. After his death in December 2000, his cousin acting as executor found more than 10,000 negatives in his apartment. Eventually a friend realized the possible value of the photos and formed a company to publish them. They were the subject of several heavily publicized exhibitions, including one in London in 2002 which Christie's auction house described as \"the most extraordinary collection of its kind for the past 50 years\" and a Sotheby's exhibition in 2003. The London exhibition was curated by twins Austin and Howard Mutti-Mewse, whose longtime obsession with Hollywood helped them to sort out the long-lost collection."

That same year he married Anna Wilcken; they would become the parents of three children. Fox began teaching at what was known as Latter-day Saints University that year, the institution that is the predecessor of LDS Business College. In 1910, Fox received a Willard D. Thompson scholarship to attend the University of California, Berkeley. He received his master's degree in economics in 1912. In the 1920s he took leave of LDS Business College, this time to work on a Ph.D. at Northwestern University, which he completed in 1932. From 1926, Fox was the president of Latter-day Saints University, presiding over the high school, junior college and business school. Among the students who studied there while Fox was president were Gordon B. Hinckley, Russell M. Nelson, and George W. Romney. In 1931, the institution was scaled back to only the business college. Fox continued as president until 1948, serving in that office for 22 years. Fox was an active member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), serving on the high council of the Emigration Stake, which encompassed the Avenues in Salt Lake City. When the Ensign Stake was split off to cover the western portion of the avenues, Fox was appointed to the Sunday School board of that stake. He was a member of the Kiwanis Club, and served as president in 1944–45. In the 1930s, Fox wrote a long manuscript on the history of economic cooperation in the LDS Church that he was unable to get published at that time. After his death, his son Karl A. Fox was able to convince LDS Church Historian Leonard J. Arrington and Dean L. May to revise and extend the work, and it was published in 1976 as Building the City of God: Community and Cooperation Among the Mormons; a second edition was published in 1992."

He contributed a series of ten articles about Hindu geography and mythology for Asiatic Researches – associated with Asiatic Society of Bengal -, between 1799 and 1810, claiming that all European myths were of Hindu origin and that India had produced a Christ (Salivahana) whose life and works closely resembled the Christ of Bible. He also claimed to have discovered a Sanskrit version of Noah (Satyavrata) and attempted to confirm the historicity of revelation and of the ethnology of Genesis from external sources, particularly Hindu or other pagan religions. In his essay Mount Caucasus – 1801, he argued for a Himalayan location of Mt. Ararat, claiming that Ararat was etymologically linked with Āryāvarta – a Sanskrit name for India."

Myers was educated at Clare College, Cambridge from 1829 to 1833 where he won the Hulsean prize and was elected a Fellow. In 1835 he became curate of Ancaster, Lincolnshire and in 1838 perpetual curate and first incumbent of the newly built St John's, Keswick, Cumbria. He founded St. John's school in 1840 and in 1849 Keswick's first public library with the proceeds of a legacy from his mother-in-law, Mrs. John Marshall. The school served for a Sunday School as well as an infant school during the week. He married Fanny Lucas in 1839 and after her death in 1840 he married Susan Harriet Marshall (1811–1896), daughter of the wealthy industrialist John Marshall (1765–1845). Their children included poet, classicist, philologist, and psychic researcher Frederic W. H. Myers (1843–1901), poet Ernest Myers (1844–1921) and Dr Arthur Thomas Myers (1851–1894)."

  "text" : "Frederick Arthur Challinor (12 November 1866 at Longton, Staffordshire – 10 June 1952 at Paignton, Devon), was a British composer. His father was a miner. Challinor was ten when he started labouring in a brickworks. At age twelve he was working in a coal-mine. At fifteen he went to work in a pottery. At this time a legacy to the family included a cottage piano and this inspired an interest in music. He worked at lessons on harmony while taking his meals at the factory. Studies resulted in him becoming an Associate of the Royal College of Music. He then started study toward a Bachelor of Music degree. He graduated with distinction in 1897 and became a successful composer. Cantatas such as Judah in Babylon, The Gardens of the Lord, and Bethany were well received. His music is attractive partly because of its simplicity and expressive qualities but also for its originality and directness. In 1903 he became a Doctor of Music. At the time he had some four hundred published compositions. He also wrote the words for many songs. He might be remembered for the lilting hymn tune Stories of Jesus (words by William H Parker) written for a competition sponsored by the National Sunday-school Union, London."

He is currently a guest speaker for the Innocence Project. Bermudez was the accused gunman in an August 1991 shooting that killed a 16-year-old boy outside a nightclub after an altercation. Eyewitnesses identified Bermudez from police photographs and then a lineup. However, four of Bermudez' friends testified that he was with them, miles away, at the time of the crime; friends of the boy who was killed also said Bermudez wasn't the shooter. No forensic evidence linked him to the crime. Ultimately, Bermudez was convicted and sentenced to serve 23 years to life in prison. However, five eyewitnesses to the alleged crime later recanted, and he was acquitted in 2009, on actual innocence grounds, after serving 18 years in prison. Media outlets in the New York City area covered the Bermudez case from 2007 throughout his acquittal. He was represented by attorney Barry Pollack, who successfully acquitted Martin Tankleff of murder charges in 2007. In 2011, Bermudez filed suit against the City of New York for $30 million."

  "text" : "Fany Pfumo (also spelled Fany Mpfumo) is a Mozambican-born singer, mainly active in South Africa. He is considered one of the founders and of the prominent artists in the marrabenta style scene. Born to a poor family, he started his career playing an \"oil tin guitar\" in Maputo's suburbs but later moved to South Africa in search of a better living. In Johannesburg, Pfumo had the opportunity to record with HMV, achieving international fame with songs such as Loko ni kumbuka Jorgina (\"When I remember Jorgina\"); this one, in particular, remains one of the best known songs of marrabenta and Mozambican pop music. After achieving international fame in South Africa, Pfumo eventually returned to Mozambique. Pfumo's trademark style is characterized by the mix of marrabenta rhythms with jazz elements as well as influences of South African kwela music. He played in a number of bands during the 1950s and 1960s but also recorded several solo singles."

Reitz was a director of the bank for more than 40 years and was its president for 31 years. After he retired, he devoted his time to disposing through philanthropy of the vast wealth he had accumulated. In business circles, he was widely respected for his principled sense of business and high sense of public responsibility in the conduct of business. His obituary cited that Reitz was a gentleman of the \"old school\" and preferred to avoid public attention. He attributed his longevity to seldom worrying and keeping regular habits. Reitz claimed to have always slept nine hours each night and, after business hours, forgot business and refused to discuss it at his home."

  "text" : "Frank Stitt III is the owner and executive chef of Highlands Bar and Grill, Bottega Restaurant, and Chez Fon Fon in Birmingham, Alabama. He was inducted into the James Beard Foundation's \"Who's Who of Food and Beverage\" in 2011. He was also named the \"Best Chef in the Southeast\" in 2001 foundation, and was a 2008 finalist for the its national \"Outstanding Chef\" award. He has also been recognized with a Lifetime Achievement Award from the Southern Foodways Alliance for his elevation of Southern cuisine and his early advocacy of locally-grown food. Stitt, the son of a surgeon, was born in 1954 and grew up in Cullman, Alabama. After graduating high school in 1972 he spent a year in Europe. He began his studies at Tufts University in Medford, Massachusetts, then transferred to the University of California, Berkeley, as a philosophy major. It was through philosophical treatises on food by authors such as Richard Olney and Elizabeth David that he developed an interest in cooking. He tried unsuccessfully to apprentice himself to area chefs, until Fritz Luenberger brought him on at his Casablanca restaurant. Stitt soon worked his way into the kitchen at Alice Waters' Chez Panisse. From her he was introduced to Olney, who was living in Provence and compiling a multi-volume Time–Life series on cooking. He became Olney's assistant. While there he met other notable chefs and food writers such as Julia Child, Jeremiah Tower, and Simone Beck. He also took menial jobs, such as grape harvesting, that would allow him to learn more about foods. While there he began working on ideas for marrying Southern foods with French cooking techniques that would set the tone for his flagship restaurant. After leaving France, Stitt worked in the Caribbean for a while before returning to Alabama. He took a job as a sommelier at a wine shop and as a chef for the Hyatt House hotel while teaching cooking classes privately. He was unable to interest local banks in loaning him money to start his own restaurant, so he approached friends and family. His mother re-mortgaged her house to help out, and Highlands Bar and Grill opened in November 1982. The restaurant quickly became a success, allowing Stitt to repay his investors within four years. In 1988 Stitt opened Bottega Restaurant nearby, borrowing on Italian cooking traditions. Both restaurants spawned more casual siblings, Bottega Cafe adjoining Bottega, and Chez Fonfon next door to Highlands. Stitt's kitchens have directly influenced many local culinary talents, such as Chris Hastings, owner of Hot and Hot Fish Club. His activism on behalf of locally-grown farm products has energized the area's local food movement. Stitt and his wife, Pardis, have been recognized by many publications and have won numerous national culinary awards. His first cookbook, Frank Stitt's Southern Table has been a best-seller and was named \"Best Cookbook\" for 2005 by the Southern Booksellers Association. Stitt was inducted into the Alabama Academy of Honor in 2009."

  "text" : "James Frederick \"Fred\" Henderson (February 1867-18 July 1957) was a British socialist writer and Labour Party politician. Born in Norwich, he was the son of James Alexander Henderson, a clothier. He was educated at the city's Old Presbyterian School, the Belfast Mercantile Academy and Owens College, Manchester. He first worked as a journalist for The Star newspaper in London, where he met T. P. O'Connor, George Bernard Shaw and William Morris, and became a committed socialist. Returning to Norwich, he founded a branch of the Socialist League there in 1886. In the following year he was sentenced to four months imprisonment for incitement to riot after groups of unemployed workers looted food shops. He was detained in Norwich Gaol where he was one of the last prisoners in England to be put to work on the treadmill. Henderson began publishing poetry at the age of 16, and following his release from prison he wrote Echoes of the Coming Day: Socialist Songs and Rhymes. He entered local politics in 1890 when he was elected to the Norwich Board of Guardians. By 1892 he had returned to London, where he founded the Clapham Labour League. He was one of six candidates supported by the Labour Representation League who were elected to the London County Council, representing Clapham. These \"Lib-Lab\" councillors formed part of the majority Liberal-backed Progressive Party that controlled the council. His membership of the council was to last only a year, however: on 9 March 1893 he was found guilty of stealing three shillings from a prostitute, and he was sentenced to four months imprisonment with hard labour. Although he protested his innocence, his resignation from the council was accepted on 28 March. Henderson returned to Norwich, working as a journalist. In 1902 he was the first socialist to be elected to the city council, and he remained a member of the council until his death, from 1923 as an alderman. He served as Lord Mayor of the city in 1939-1940. He was granted the freedom of the city in 1947. Henderson was an active public speaker and lecturer, and a book based on his speeches was published by the Independent Labour Party as The Case for Socialism in 1911. The book was highly influential and was translated into several languages. This was followed by The New Faith: A Study of Party Politics and the War (1915), The Economic Consequences of Power Production (1931), Money Power and Human Life (1932) and Capitalism and the Consumer (1935)."

  "text" : "Frank Laskier (1912 – 8 July 1949) was a British seaman who came to public attention during World War II. In late 1940, Laskier was a gunner in the Merchant Navy when his ship was attacked and sunk by a German raider off the coast of West Africa. Rescued from a raft and returned to Britain, he was interviewed by BBC radio. His famous \"My Name is Frank\" broadcasts during the Battle of the Atlantic affected popular opinion about the war and helped Merchant Navy recruitment efforts in America and Britain. \"Seaman Frank\" became a figurehead of the Merchant Navy in newsreels, speaking tours and autobiographical books. By the war's end, sentiment had moved on and he was largely forgotten. At age 37, he died in a car accident in New York City. Today, the little that is remembered about Laskier is mixed; one observer described him as just an icon of wartime propaganda, but another critic considers Laskier's autobiographical writing to be \"powerful\" and the \"genuine article\" about a seaman's life."

Oslay researched the Slovene March (Prekmurje) and published in the irredentistic Domovina of Sándor Mikola. Oslay's themes were the Prekmurian history, language, the reformation and Croatian history. Oslay made many claims that are untenable and unprovable, including: Styria was inhabited by Hungarians, therefore Styria is also an ancient Hungarian area. The Slovenes in Prekmurje and Styria are assimilated Hungarians, etc. Oslay supported the anti-Slavic chauvinistic propaganda of Sándor Mikola after World War I."

  "text" : "Farman Ismayil oglu Karimzade (Azerbaijani: Fərman Kərimzadə; March 3, 1937, Boyuk Vedi village – 1989, Baku) – is an Azerbaijani writer, screenwriter, film director and film producer. In 1949, he was deported from his native village to Beylagan city with his family (then the city was called Zhdanov). In 1955, he entered the State Art School named after Azim Azimzade. Later he worked in Beylagan as a teacher. From 1962 to 1965, he studied at All-Russian State University of Cinematography named after S.A.Gerasimov, in Moscow. After graduating from the university he worked as a translator, managed a department at \"Absheron\" newspaper, in 1966–1970's, he worked at \"Literatura i kultura\" (\"Literature and culture\") magazine. In 1970–1977's he was a member of the board of \"Azerbaijanfilm\" film studio and was a member of Azerbaijan Union of Writers since 1968. In 1958, \"Size 41 shoes\" narrative was published by the writer. This was one of the first attempts of the writer, but despite that, it was full of appeals and freethinking ideas. \"The last exhibit\" (Azerbaijani: Sonuncu eksponat; 1961) and \"A wedding sheep\" works were also dedicated to the Great Patriotic War. \"The last exhibit\" narrative is a touching story about a poor mother who lost her son in the war. Now seeing in the museum her son's shirt, sewed by her, the mother feels pain, because custodians of the museum have yet looked after the exhibits and her lovely son's shirt is fully moth-eaten. 1980's were the most productive years in Farman Karimzade's literary creativity. Mainly he wrote about historical themes: among Farman Karimzade’s novels are – “Khudaferin bridge\" (Azerbaijani: Xudafərin körpüsü; 1981), \"Battle of Chaldiran\" (Azerbaijani: Çaldıran döyüşü; 1984–1985, about the Safavid-Ottoman war and Shah Ismayil Khatai's life), \"Tabriz's pride\", \"Ols eagle's death\" (1988), \"Snowy pass\" (1986–1987). Farman Karimzade also worked as the film director in the sphere of cinematography and was the editor in shootings of such films as \"Shovkat Alakbarova is singing\" (1970), \"The last pass\" (1971), \"Stone suffers\" (1975), \"Voice of a pipe\" (1975), \"Dervish is exploding Paris\" (1976), \"The shah and a servant\" (1976) and others. Scenarios of such films as \"The last pass\" (1971), \"Bell\" (1973), \"Four Sundays\" (1974) and \"My wife, my children\" (1978) belong to him. Farman Karimzade was the real patriot of his country. After 1988 events, he personally met with politicians, Generals, various high-ranking officials, in Baku and in Moscow. Probably, because of these events Farman Karimzade couldn't bear it, and after a year he died of heart-stroke at the age of 52."

  "text" : "John Forster Charlton (1915–89), was an English traditional musician, originally from near Hexham, Northumberland, who later settled in Gateshead. He at first played fiddle, but later also took up the Northumbrian smallpipes. He was a major figure in the folk music revival during the 1950s and 1960s, and an active member of the Northumbrian Pipers' Society. He was a founder member of the High Level Ranters, playing fiddle and smallpipes on their first record, Northumberland for Ever, but he subsequently left the group. Later he played in a country dance band, The Borderers. He was very active in recording traditional musicians in the area, notably Billy Pigg, and he would take a portable tape recorder to sessions and festivals. Several of these recordings were used to compile the record Billy Pigg, the Border Minstrel, while many more may be heard on the FARNE archive. Besides Billy Pigg, musicians he recorded include Joe Hutton, Diana Blackett-Ord, Richard Flemming and George Atkinson, as well as some duet recordings of himself with Colin Caisley. He also made, but did not retain, a recording of Tom Clough, late in the latter's life. He was also a pipemaker, and is believed to have made the first concert-pitch Northumbrian smallpipe chanter, for Billy Pigg. Billy Pigg on pipes, John Doonan on piccolo and Forster Charlton on fiddle, liked to play as a trio, but smallpipes were traditionally pitched rather lower than modern concert pitch, and correcting for this, by using a very sharp reed in the smallpipes and pulling out the tuning slide of the piccolo, caused intonation problems. However it is not known whether Billy Pigg ever used this chanter regularly. He also had a great interest in other types of bagpipes. During the 1950s and 1960s, he invited prominent uilleann pipers, including the McPeakes, Seamus Ennis and Leo Rowsome, to Northumberland to play at concerts. Similarly, when the triennial International Bagpipe Festival at Strakonice in Southern Bohemia was founded, Josef Režný persuaded Charlton to come as a representative of the Northumbrian Pipers' Society. From 1968 until 1986, he, later with other pipers, would go to Strakonice. This connection led to some of Josef Režný's arrangements for Dudy of traditional Czech music, being adapted for smallpipes. He was planning another trip to Strakonice in 1989, despite his poor health, but died before it took place. He was a prolific composer of tunes in traditional style, notably \"The Rowley Burn Hornpipe\". Tragically, he was driving from his home in Gateshead to his brother's funeral in Lesbury, in northern Northumberland, when he had a fatal road accident."

  "text" : "Felix Gillet (born March 25, 1835, Rochefort, Charente-Maritime, France; died January 27, 1908, Nevada City, California, United States) was a California pioneer nurseryman, horticulturist, sericulturist, and writer who made several important introductions of superior European deciduous fruit and nut trees to California and the northwestern United States. Beginning in 1869, in his Barren Hill Nursery in Nevada City, Gillet cultivated his own imported scion wood and home-grown nursery stock, experimented with grafting and hybridizing, and continually wrote articles on horticulture and his plant selections, while remaining active in Nevada City civic affairs. Publishing his own nursery catalog for 37 years and advertising widely, he sold his walnuts, filberts (hazelnuts), chestnuts, prunes, figs, strawberries, grapes, peaches, cherries, citrus and dozens of other fruit and nut varieties throughout California and the Pacific Northwest. The commercial walnut variety “Felix Gillet” was named in his honor."

  "text" : "Frank Buytendijk (The Hague, 1969) is a Dutch author of management books. He studied business and information technology at the Hogeschool Utrecht (University of Applied Sciences Utrecht), was a consultant at various firms in his home country, was a research analyst and held executive positions in various large, medium and small software companies. He has a background in business intelligence, corporate performance management and business process management. Buytendijk is also a visiting fellow at Cranfield University School of Management. In 2012, he was appointed fellow at The Data Warehousing Institute (TDWI). Currently, Buytendijk is a research vice president at analyst firm Gartner, where he served before as well between 2001 and 2006. Buytendijk wrote five books related to strategy, organizational behavior and performance management. A common theme throughout these books is the application of stakeholder theory in business. According to managementboek.nl, Buytendijk's first book on balanced scorecards briefly reached the #1 sales position for management books in the Netherlands; it remained in the top 100 for 890 days. His second book - on data warehouses - quickly followed. This was a more technology-oriented book. Both the first and second book were written in Dutch. Buytendijk's third book, titled \"Performance Leadership,\" was published by McGraw-Hill; it discussed the relationship between performance management and organizational behavior. The book has its roots in behavioral economics. \"Dealing with Dilemmas\", published by John Wiley & Sons, followed in 2010. It argues, following Henry Mintzberg, that strategy is full of dilemmas that require a different approach than traditional analysis, namely the opposite, synthesis. Part of the book on scenario planning and strategy maps is also available as a case study in the Harvard Business Review database. The fifth book, called \"Socrates Reloaded,\" consists of a number of essays diving deeper into philosophical aspects of business and technology that started to emerge in \"Dealing with Dilemmas\"."

In 1870 he formed the business partnership of Leverett, Frye, and Scholding, opening the first of a chain of grocery stores in Greenwich. Frye took sole control of the company in 1880. In 1892 the business was renamed Leverett & Frye, and by 1894, when it became a limited company, it had 50 stores in England and Ireland, concentrating on opening shops in newly developed suburbs. Frye became president of the Metropolitan Grocers Association and in 1891 helped found the Federation of Grocer's Associations of the United Kingdom. Frye was a progressive employer, operating a profit-sharing scheme with his employees and was on the Radical wing of the Liberal Party. He became a member of the Metropolitan Board of Works, and in 1889 was elected to the first London County Council as a Progressive Party councillor representing North Kensington. He stepped down from the council at the 1892 elections, having been nominated as Liberal candidate to contest the parliamentary seat of Kensington North. He was elected at the general election held later that year, serving one term in the House of Commons as a member of parliament before losing his seat in the next general election in 1895. He later became an alderman of Kensington Borough Council. He retired to Worthing on the Sussex coast, where he died aged 68."

  "text" : "Frederick Ebenezer John Lloyd (1859–1933) was an independent Catholic bishop with the American Catholic Church. He was born at Milford Haven, Wales. In 1915, René Vilatte founded the American Catholic Church. It was at this time that he received Lloyd into the church and on December 19, 1915, he was consecrated as a bishop at Saint David's Chapel on East Thirty-Sixth Street, Chicago. Vilatte was assisted by Bishop Paolo Miraglia-Gulotti, formerly of Italy and then of New York and working with Vilatte in the United States. During the consecration the archbishop addressed the congregation and newly consecrated prelate saying: It needs to prophet to fortell for you and the American Catholic Church a great future in the Province of God. The need for a Church both American and Catholic, and free from paparchy and all foreign denominations, has been felt for many years by Christians of all the denominations. May your zeal and apostolic ministry be crowned with success. By 1914, the dynamic energy of Vilatte was diminishing and in a synod held in Chicago on April 10, 1920, he offered to retire and named Lloyd as his successor as Primate and Metropolitan of the American Catholic Church (ACC). On September 8, 1929, Lloyd consecrated John Churchill Sibley as Missionary Archbishop and Vicar General of the Order of Antioch in England. The spread of the American Catholic Church from 1920 until his death in 1933 was largely due to his initiative."

  "text" : "Friedrich von Beck-Rzikowsky (1830–1920), sometimes Friedrich Beck, was an Austrian Generaloberst. Beck was born at Freiburg im Breisgau, and entered the army of the Austrian Empire in 1848. He distinguished himself as chief-of-staff of an infantry division at the Battle of Magenta, and in 1863 was made personal aide-de-camp to the Emperor. He held this position, with that of adjutant-general and chief of the imperial military chancery until 1882, winning the Emperor's confidence and exercising the greatest influence on all military questions. In 1866 he acted as the Emperor's confidential agent at the headquarters of Field Marshal Benedek, before and after the Battle of Königgrätz, and his advice was of great importance, though it was not always followed. In 1878 he was entrusted with a similar mission to the commander-in-chief of the troops operating in Bosnia. In 1882 he was made chief of the general staff of the Imperial and Royal army, a position which he occupied until 1906. Not only was his advice listened to in military affairs, but he frequently exercised great influence on important political and personal questions, gaining a great reputation throughout the monarchy as one of its most influential men. His clear judgment and practical common-sense enabled him to see and judge men and things from a purely objective standpoint. He retired at the age of 77, and was appointed commander of the Imperial Guard."

  "text" : "Frank Teich ( September 22, 1856 - January 27, 1939) was an American sculptor, stone carver and businessman, often referred to as the father of the Texas granite industry. Born in Neundorf bei Lobenstein, Germany and educated in drawing, design and stone carving, studying with Johannes Schilling, Teich immigrated to the United States in 1878, moving to Chicago a year later. There he was placed in charge of the stone carving for the Cook County Courthouse. He left Chicago and settled in Texas in 1883, where he remained for the rest of his life. In Austin, Teich received the contract as superintendent of the granite cutting on the new capitol building, designed by Elijah E. Myers. Teich designed the Volunteer Firemen Monument that was installed on the capitol grounds in 1896. After receiving the commission to execute the Confederate Soldiers Monument on the capitol grounds  Teich contacted the Roman Bronze Works, who in turn assigned an employee of theirs, Pompeo Coppini, to San Antonio, where Teich's studio was located, to assist in the making of the monument. Roman Bronze Works got the contract for five bronze figures, but they never got Coppini back. He stayed in Texas for the remainder of his life. Around 1900, Teich discovered a large outcrop of granite near Llano, Texas. It was his exploitation of that resource that resulted in his being referred to as \"the father of the Texas granite industry.\" Much of Teich's sculptural output over the ensuing decades involved the making of Confederate monuments. In 1896, he was made an honorary member of the Daughters of the Confederacy. Since Teich supplied both statues and the granite bases that statues by other artists are mounted on, it is sometimes difficult to know for sure what might be his work or someone else's."

  "text" : "Francis I. McKenna (February 25, 1859 – February 24, 1914) was a real estate and land developer, and architect from the 1890s to the 1920s in Portland, Oregon. McKenna moved to Portland in 1889 and purchased the land now known as the University Park neighborhood. He went on to establish the Portland Belt Line Company, which lobbied city officials to extend the cable car system to St. Johns, Oregon. The project was constructed in 1905. McKenna was also known as an advocate of civic improvement and industrialization. Born to farmers in Illinois, McKenna was orphaned at the age of 12. This forced him to find work in labor, including farming and building railroads. When he turned 18, McKenna had enough formal and informal education to ascertain a job at a rural Ohio public school. Eventually, he was offered a job at Creighton University which he held for two years. McKenna quit his profession and packed up for Oregon in 1889 with his wife Laura and son Coe. North McKenna avenue and McKenna park were named in honor of the University Park developer. His son, Coe, continued the family's real estate legacy."

He is thought to be the first to use a weapon during the 1936 revolt. Sa'adi was at one point imprisoned by the British authorities. When he was released from prison, he moved to Haifa where he met Sheikh Izz al-Din al-Qassam and joined his organisation. On 15 April 1936, a group called Ikhwan al-Qassam under al-Sa'di's leadership ambushed a bus on the Nablus-Tulkarm road. Three Jewish passengers were taken off the bus and shot, two of them fatally. This incident is seen as the starting point of the 1936–1939 Arab Revolt. For the many operations against the British, he was sentenced to death. He was executed on 22 November 1937, at the age of 80 during the Ramadan fast."

  "text" : "Frankie Masters (April 12, 1904 – October 28, 1990) was a big band leader whose performance career spanned the late 1920s to late 1970s. Masters formed a swing band after dropping out of Indiana University in the mid-20s. Frank had played the banjo and sang in a college band and had spent at least one summer playing his way back and forth to Shanghai, China aboard a cruise ship. In Chicago in 1925, he formed an orchestra and became the house act at the Sherman Hotel's College Inn in Chicago. He signed with Victor Records in 1927 and began his recording career but didn't achieve much success until he switched to Vocalion Records in 1939 and recorded what would become his theme song, \"Scatterbrain,\" a number one hit that year. MCA organized a sponsored radio show for the Masters band in about 1939. It was broadcast first via WBBM, later WMAQ and was called “It Can Be Done.” Also featured each week was poet-journalist Edgar Guest. The show, according to saxophonist Buddy Shaw, who played with Frankie’s band at the time, featured stories about people who had achieved success through adversity. Masters and company also made several movie shorts, which were shown in theaters nationally. Frankie and Phyllis Miles, his wife, hosted two television shows locally. The first, in 1950, was a weekly show sponsored by RCA Victor called “Lucky Letters” on WBKB. Later that year and into early 1951, they had a weekly program called “Walgreen’s Open House.” Then in the fall of 1974, when the famed Empire Room of the Palmer House reopened for the season, the Frankie Masters Orchestra became the new house band, replacing Ben Arden and his band, which had been appearing there since 1957."

He succeeded his father in 1610, inheriting the family seat of Great Fulford. In 1625, he was elected Member of Parliament for Devon. He served as a Deputy Lieutenant of Dorset by 1640 and was appointed High Sheriff of Dorset for 1642–43. During the Civil War he was an active royalist and was captured and briefly imprisoned in Devon in early 1643. He maintained a garrison at Great Fulford until December 1645, when he surrendered to Thomas Fairfax, 3rd Lord Fairfax of Cameron. His eldest son was killed during the war. He married Elizabeth, the daughter and co-heiress of Bernard Samways of Winterbourne St. Martin and Toller Fratrum, Dorset, with whom he had 7 sons (several of whom predeceased him) and 6 daughters. Fulford died at the age of about 80 between 7 January 1664 when he made his will and 2 May 1664 when it was proved and was buried at Toller Fratrum. His eldest son having been killed, his Devon estates passed to his grandchild and the Dorset estate to his brother George."

  "text" : "Faustin Ndikumana is a Burundian anti-corruption activist and founder of the group Parole et Action pour le Réveil des Consciences et l'Evolution des Mentalités (English: \"Words and Action for the Awakening of Conscience and the Evolution of Mindsets\", PARCEM). In February 2012, he was detained for two weeks on charges of making \"false declarations\", leading Amnesty International to designate him a prisoner of conscience. In early 2012, Ndikumana wrote to the Burundian Justice Minister, Pascal Barandagiye, stating that PARCEM had been told by new judges that they had been asked to pay US$1,000 to $1,500 in exchange for their appointments. On 3 February, Ndikumana held a press conference to make the allegations public. Ndikumana was arrested by agents of the Anti-Corruption Brigade on 7 February while giving an interview to Radio Publique Africaine. He was then taken before a magistrate of the Anti-Corruption Court, apparently on the basis of a complaint by the Justice Minister. The court charged him under Article 14 of the Anti-Corruption Law with making \"false declarations\", which carries a maximum sentence of ten years' imprisonment and a fine of 1 million Burundian francs (US$716). Ndikumana was then transferred to Mpimba Central Prison in Bujumbura. Ndikumana's detention immediately drew domestic and international criticism. Front Line Defenders expressed concern, stating that Ndikumana's arrest appeared to be \"motivated by his work against corruption in the judicial system and its impact on access to equitable justice for all citizens\". Amnesty International designated him a prisoner of conscience, \"detained solely for exercising his right to freedom of expression\", and called for his immediate arrest. The organization also noted its concern that the arrest might have a \"chilling effect\" on other activists and journalists. Ten Burundian civil society groups rallied in Bujumbura on 14 February to call for Ndikumana's release, with Gabriel Rufyiri of the Anti-corruption and Economic Malpractice Observatory urging the government to free Ndikumana and become \"more transparent in recruitment\". On 17 February, a court rejected Ndikumana's bail plea, ruling that he must remain in prison; however, the court reversed its decision four days later, and he was released on bail on 21 February. Agence France-Presse attributed the about-face to diplomatic pressure on Ndikumana's behalf, particularly from the European Union. As part of Ndikumana's bail terms, he cannot leave the Bujumbura area or travel to the airport, and he must report to the court each Thursday."

He was born in Wilmont, Saskatchewan, the son of Joseph Krenn and Mary Winkels, both of German descent, and was educated at St. Peter's College. His parents had both died when he was seven. In 1937, Krenn married Sybilus Smith. He lived in Bruno, Saskatchewan. Krenn resigned from a civil service job to seek the Liberal candidacy for Watrous in 1938. He ran unsuccessfully for a seat in the Canadian House of Commons in a 1943 by-election held in the Humboldt riding. Krenn was defeated by James Andrew Darling when he ran for reelection to the Saskatchewan assembly in 1944. He later ran as an independent in the British Columbia riding of Fraser Valley in the 1965 Canadian Election, receiving 272 votes."

They fought again on March 24, with four-ounce gloves. In the eighth round, LaBlanche grabbed Childs by the waist, threw him to the canvas, and then kicked him. The badly hurt Childs got up and wrestled LaBlanche, putting him in a half-nelson before elevating LaBlanche and throwing him. The police stopped the fight and the referee awarded Childs the decision after disqualifying LaBlanche. Childs fought 15 more bouts before getting a shot at the colored heavyweight title. Along the way, he fought Bob Armstrong, the colored heavyweight champ, in a six-round non-title contest held on March 7, 1897 in Philadelphia. Childs won on points. His fight before that had been with white heavyweight contender Joe Choynski (the mentor of future colored heavyweight and world heavyweight title-holder Jack Johnson), who won by knockout (K.O.) in the third of a three-round fight. In the intervening thirteen months before Armstrong gave him a shot for the title, Childs squared off on January 8, 1898 at Chicago's 2nd Regiment Armory against a boxer named Klondike (real name John Haines or John W. Haynes), so called because he was supposed to be a great find (evoking the Klondike Gold Rush). It was Klondike's first fight, and he was K.O.-ed by Childs. Klondike would go on to beat future world heavyweight champ Jack Johnson in Johnson's third pro fight and claim what he called the \"Black Heavyweight Championship\". Childs and Klondike would meet again, frequently, as African American boxers were forced to fight one another often due to the color bar."

His brother was Robert Hope-Jones, the electric organ designer. His parents were from Ruthin, Wales. Frank became interested in electrical apparatus when his elder brother Robert worked for a telephone company and assisted him when he began designing and building electric organs. Frank himself moved into the field of electric clocks and founded the Synchronome Company of London in 1895. The Synchronome company manufactured electrically operated master clocks, patented in 1907, such as the Shortt-Synchronome clock. These were pendulum clocks which were automatically impulsed every half minute by mechanical means, the mechanism then being reset electrically. They were the most accurate clocks available prior to the development of the quartz crystal and atomic clocks. He was also interested in timekeeping via radio signals and in 1913 Synchronome started to manufacture the Horophone, a device for capturing radio time signals. He also suggested to the BBC that they should transmit a time signal and in 1924 the Greenwich pips were first broadcast. In 1946 he was awarded the Gold Medal of the British Horological Institute. He died in Surrey at the age of 82. He had married Florence M. Gask (née Tippett) in 1917. They had a daughter Agnes."

His first paintings of Saints Barbara and Thomas Aquinas for San Bartolomeo in Bologna (both in situ) date from 1779, were probably completed in collaboration with his father. In 1790 he became a member of the Accademia Clementina, and in 1821 he was elected to the Accademia Pontificia in Rome. He is best known for his frescoes for various palaces in Bologna, including paintings of Allegory of Victory and the Muses for the Palazzo Comunale, Bologna and a Apotheosis of Hercules (entry staircase ceiling), an Apollo and the Hours in the grand salon, and a Dance of Nymphs and Cupids for a room in the Palazzo Hercolani. In 1828 he painted five canvases for the ceiling of San Paolo in Monte at Bologna, now in the convent there. In that year, he also painted Triumphant Religion Granting Immortality to Felsina on the ceiling of the Sala degli Uomini Illustri e Benemeriti of the Pantheon in the cemetery of the Certosa at Bologna. In 1830 he completed the Delivery of the Keys for a church in San Pietro Capofiume near Bologna."

In 1847 he became a partner in Dent Allcroft, retiring from business in 1865. He continued his association with the City of London: in 1866 he was elected as one of the two Sheriffs of London and Middlesex. He was knighted in 1867, became a justice of the peace for Middlesex and a Deputy Lieutenant for the City of London in 1869. A Liberal in politics, he made a number of unsuccessful attempts to enter parliament including at Liskeard in 1869 and St Ives in 1874 and Worcester in 1878. In 1870 he was elected to the first London School Board, as one of the members representing Finsbury. In 1837 he married Amelia Sarah Emily Vanderpant, daughter of John Vanderpant of Utrecht in the Netherlands. Lycett died in October 1880, at his home in Highbury, Islington, aged 77. He left an estate of more than a quarter of a million pounds, much of which he willed to various Methodist charities."

Storrs-Turner also published a number of other essays and monographs opposing the opium trade, including British opium policy and its results to India and China, Reply to the Defence of the Opium Trade by the Shanghai Correspondent of the Times, as well as works on Christianity (such as The Quakers: A Study, Historical and Critical... and The Certainty of Religion)."

  "text" : "Fingal mac Gofraid, and his father, Gofraid mac Sitriuc, were late eleventh-century rulers of the Kingdom of the Isles. Although one source states that Gofraid mac Sitriuc's father was named Sitriuc, there is reason to suspect that this could be an error of some sort. There is also uncertainty as to which family Gofraid mac Sitriuc belonged to. One such family, descended from Amlaíb Cuarán, King of Northumbria and Dublin, appears to have cooperated with Diarmait mac Maíl na mBó, King of Leinster. Another family, that of Echmarcach mac Ragnaill, King of Dublin and the Isles, opposed Amlaíb Cuarán's apparent descendants, and was closely connected with Diarmait's adversaries, the Uí Briain. If Gofraid mac Sitriuc was a descendant of Amlaíb Cuarán, it could mean that he was installed in the Isles by Diarmait after the latter oversaw the apparent expulsion of Echmarcach in the 1060s. Membership of this family may also explain apparent amiable relationship that Gofraid mac Sitriuc and Fingal appear to have enjoyed with Gofraid Crobán, their immediate successor in the Isles. It could also explain an attack on Mann in 1073, conducted by a possible the Uí Briain and a possible kinsman of Echmarcach. On the other hand, if Gofraid mac Sitriuc was a close kinsman of Echmarcach, it is possible that he is identical to Gofraid ua Ragnaill, King of Dublin, a contemporary ruler who is known to have reigned in Dublin during a period of Uí Briain overlordship after Diarmait's death. This identification could mean that Gofraid ua Ragnaill immediately succeeded Echmarcach in both Dublin and the Isles. Gofraid mac Sitriuc is stated in one source to have died in about 1070, after which Fingal succeeded him. Fingal later appears to have fended off an attack upon Mann by men with Irish connections. At some point in the 1070s the kingdom was conquered by Gofraid Crobán, although the circumstances of this event are uncertain. Although it is possible that the latter overthrew Fingal, this is by no means certain. In fact, the throne may well have been vacant when Gofraid Crobán conducted his campaigns to gain the kingship. Whatever the case, there is reason to suspect that descendants of Fingal ruled the Kingdom of the Rhinns following his demise."

  "text" : "Fallah Varney was a Liberian soldier and one of the leaders of the People's Redemption Council, the military junta that ruled the country after a 1980 coup d'état. Born on 7 April 1957 at Korniadu in Lofa County, Varney attended schools run by the Firestone plantation. After finishing high school at the Charlotte Tolbert Memorial Academy in 1972, he enlisted in the Armed Forces of Liberia in 1974. He was promoted from private to private first class in 1975 and to corporal in 1979. In the wake of the 12 April coup, he took the rank of lieutenant colonel and became the secretary general of the People's Redemption Council, as well as chairing the PRC's commerce and transportation committee. Varney held office for less than a year: on 27 January 1981, he was driving a car on the highway between Monrovia and Paynesville when his vehicle was involved in a head-on collision. The inmates of nearby houses rushed to the vehicles, but he was dead by the time the first person reached his car. Two days later, his body was transferred from a funeral home to the Capitol Rotunda, where he lay in state for another two days. On 1 February, his body was flown back to Lofa County: a funeral was held at the Voinjama airfield, after which it was returned to Korniadu for burial. Doe chose Abraham Kollie, the PRC deputy speaker, to succeed Varney as secretary general. A member of the Episcopal Church of Liberia, Varney was married with two daughters. He was a grandson of a chieftain of the Kissi people and saw his participation in the PRC as an attempt to fight for the freedom of his ethnic group. Varney was buried in the Kolahun District, near his hometown of Korniadu. In 1983, Liberia issued a set of seven postage stamps celebrating the third anniversary of the coup; Varney was featured on the three-cent stamp in the set."

  "text" : "Frederic John Fransen (born 1965) is an American academic. Although he first came to prominence as the author of The Supranational Politics of Jean Monnet, a study of Monnet's critical contributions to the foundations of the European Union, Fransen has in more recent years been more widely known as a consultant to—and advocate for—major donors to institutions of higher education in the United States. Both in his role as a provider of advice to clients (principally through his Indianapolis-based consultancy \"Donor Advising, Research, & Educational Services\") and in a more public way in his capacity as Executive Director of the non-profit Center for Excellence in Higher Education, he has to a significant degree raised awareness of the problem that gifts to colleges and universities are at times used in ways that are not in accordance with the intentions of the donors. Although Fransen is perhaps best known for his association with this issue and the quest for ways to address it, he also not infrequently writes and speaks on the need for more general structural reform in higher education. He also serves as a Visitor of Ralston College, a start-up liberal arts college in Savannah. He is the holder of a doctorate in Social Thought from the University of Chicago and was formerly the Director of Higher Education Programs at The Philanthropy Roundtable and a Senior Fellow of the Liberty Fund."

Urbina had been the subject of a manhunt since 1999 despite reported sightings in Mexico. A $100,000 reward was offered for information leading to Urbina's arrest.

Somehow, between them, the real man has got overlaid and Sanderson is on his way to becoming a legendary figure.", "Of all the men I have met &#91;&hellip;&#93; only one has stirred me to a biographical effort. This one exception is F.W. Sanderson, for many years the headmaster of Oundle School. I think him beyond question the greatest man I have ever known with any degree of intimacy. &#91;&hellip;&#93; To tell his story is to reflect upon all the main educational ideas of the last half-century, and to revise our conception of the process and purpose of the modern community in relation to education.", "The methods will change from learning in class-room to researching in the galleries; from learning things of the past to searching into the future; competition giving place to co-operative work. And somewhere within the field of work each boy or girl may find his own part, and so take part in the creative life, and grow by doing it, and be 'bitten' with the desire to do, and gain in purpose, in determination, in self-determination, in confidence, and outlook. My own view is that at an early stage every effort should be made to get a boy at a 'grip' with some part of knowledge, and that we must not be afraid to specialise at the early ages of fifteen to seventeen, for when once a boy has been caught with the love of research he will go on, and can widen out at a later stage. In fact, he will find the need for extending his knowledge and capacities. Examinations tend the other way, with, as I think, disastrous effects on many a creative boy.", "To enable schools to carry out this prime duty, i.e. to make the highest use of each member, which is to say to make the school highly efficient, it is necessary to have a wide range of subjects in the school. We shall see what changes should come over schools. They must be built", "It is an undeniable fact, I fear, that to command the full respect of the very young male a master must give some proof of physical prowess or at least have some athletic legend attached to his name.  It was even suggested that the Head was \"not a public-school man and did not know what was what,\" and – precious examples of what is what! – that his bow ties were of the \"made-up\" variety and his cuffs detachable. Such is the snobbishness of little boys that these ridiculous falsehoods were enough to prejudice one's regard.", "He was very historically minded.  His so-called scripture lessons, for example, were not really very much to do with theology, but tended to treat the Bible in a purely historical manner.  He also brought the school fame through an expansion of science and engineering, and though I read classics, I still had to spend a lot of time gaining workshop experience.  I learnt how to work a lathe, and how to do steam-engine compression diagrams.  And these things stood me in enormous good stead later when, for example, I came to write the volume &#91;of Science and Civilisation in China&#93; on mechanical engineering in Chinese history." ]

  "text" : "Frederick William Sanderson (13 May 1857 – 15 June 1922) was headmaster of Oundle School from 1892 until his death. He was an education reformer, and both at Oundle, and previously at Dulwich College where he had started as assistant master, he introduced innovative programs of education in engineering. Under his headmastership, Oundle saw a reversal of a decline from which it had been suffering in the middle of the 19th century, with school enrolment rising from 92 at the time of his appointment to 500 when he died. Sanderson was the inspiration for the progressive headmaster character in H. G. Wells' novel Joan and Peter. Wells had sent his own sons to Oundle, and was friendly with Sanderson. After Sanderson's death, which occurred shortly after delivering an address to Wells and others, Wells initially worked on his official biography, entitled Sanderson of Oundle, but later abandoned it in favour of an unofficial biography, The Story of a Great Schoolmaster."

Born at Tamworth to police officer Michael Burke (who would serve in the New South Wales Parliament from 1885 to 1887) and Catherine Agnes, née Leahy, he attended Crown Street Public School. After leaving school he held a variety of jobs including storeman, hotel manager and assistant on the staff of the Evening News. In 1901 he married Ada May Frazer, with whom he had five children. He worked on the tramways until he was dismissed after involvement in a union-led 1908 strike; he formed a small business and from 1914 to 1918 worked as an inspector for the New South Wales Commodities Commission and the Commonwealth Price Commission. He also worked as a staff member for Clive Evatt, and was president of the Newtown branch of the Australian Labor Party. As president of the Anti-Conscription Council, Burke was ardently opposed to conscription and in 1917 was elected to the New South Wales Legislative Assembly as the member for Newtown. While proportional representation was in force from 1920 to 1927 he was one of the members for Botany, returning to his old seat in 1927. From 1930 to 1932 he was Speaker of the Assembly. In July 1939 he joined Bob Heffron's Industrial Labor Party, but this splinter group was reincorporated into the ALP in August. He was defeated in 1944 by Lang Labor candidate Lilian Fowler. Burke died at Dulwich Hill in 1949."

  "text" : "Captain Frank Augustus Chaffey (31 March 1888 – 9 July 1940) was an Australian politician. He was born at Moonbi to farmer William Adolphus Chaffey and Amelia, née Chad. He was educated at Nemingha and Tamworth before attending Hawkesbury Agricultural College, after which he worked on the family dairy farm. He studied at Sydney Technical College from 1907 and worked as a woolclasser briefly before returning to Tamworth to run the farm. He was active in the local Farmers and Settlers Association. On 1 May 1912 he married Amy Stella McIlveen, with whom he had six children. During World War I he served with the 1st Light Horse Brigade and from 1918 to 1919 was Director of Education of the Australian Infantry Forces. Chaffey was elected to the New South Wales Legislative Assembly in 1913 as the Liberal member for Tamworth. When proportional representation was introduced in 1920 (by which time the Liberal Party had become the Nationalist Party), he became one of the members for Namoi, but he returned to his old seat when single-member electorates were re-introduced in 1927. He was Assistant Minister for Lands and Agriculture from April 1922 until June, when he became full Minister, serving until 1925; he later served as Secretary for Mines and Minister for Forests (1927–1929) and Colonial Secretary (1929–38). On the 9th of July 1940, Chaffey died of a coronary occlusion at his Sydney home in Rose Bay, New South Wales. Premier Alexander Mair spoke after his death that \"The State has lost a splendid citizen of the highest worth. As a Member of the Legislative Assembly and a former Cabinet Minister, and as a private citizen he was held in the highest esteem\" and that; \"His career was one of the longest in the history of the State. He showed outstanding capacity as an administrator.\" Chaffey was cremated at Northern Suburbs Crematorium following a private service which was held at St Michael's Church, Vaucluse. He was succeeded in Parliament as the member for Tamworth by his son, Bill. Chaffey Dam, a large freshwater dam on the Peel River north of Tamworth, New South Wales is named after both Frank and Bill Chaffey."

He succeeded his grandfather Lord Hawley in the barony in 1684, also inheriting large estates in Berkshire, Devon, Dorset and Somerset. The barony was an Irish peerage and did not entitle him to a seat in the English House of Lords. He instead stood for election to the English House of Commons for Somerset in 1705 but was unsuccessful. However, in 1713 he was returned for Bramber, a seat he held until 1715. He did not stand for Parliament after 1715. Lord Hawley married firstly Lady Elizabeth Ramsay, daughter of William Ramsay, 3rd Earl of Dalhousie, in 1697. After her death in 1713 he married secondly Elizabeth Hayes in 1718. He died in May 1743 and was succeeded by his son by his second wife, Francis. Lady Hawley died in 1745."

As his family became more and more closely connected to the family of Supreme Court Justice William V.S. Tubman, Frank began to become prominent: when Tubman ran for President in 1943, he was rumoured to be Tubman's first choice for Vice President, although his younger brother William was eventually chosen, perhaps because of Frank's unpredictable moods and violent temper. Despite being passed over for Vice President, Frank remained active in the TWP and national politics. By 1976, he was a member of the Senate and had been elected its president pro temp. He was abruptly removed from office in 1980 by a military coup d'état: on 12 April, a group of enlisted men calling themselves the \"People's Redemption Council murdered President Tolbert, arrested Frank Tolbert and many other high officials, and proclaimed themselves the country's new government. After a rapid trial in a kangaroo court, Tolbert and the others were summarily executed by firing squad on a Monrovia beach ten days after the coup."

Francesco was the progenitor of a pedigree of painters. He had a brother, Antonio Annibale Nasini. Most famous of all the family was his son Giuseppe Nicola Nasini (1664-1736), who traveled to Rome and had widespread patronage. Francesco was also the father of Antonio Nasini (1631-1716), who like his father, was mainly active near Siena. Finally, Apollonio Nasini, son of Giuseppe, was also a painter of some distinction. Francesco was very prolific in the province of Siena. In an inventory of works of art in Siena, many works are listed by specific members of the family, or attributed to the family. For example, in the right chapel of the church of the Madonna del Rimedii, were frescoes, in poor condition, of Saints Cecilia, Agnese, Margherita, Barbara, Rocco, and Agustine (1700). In a chapel on the left, were frescoes of Saints Agatha, Lucia, Appollonia, Orsola, Anthony of Padua, and Gaetano (Cajetan). The ceiling had a Glory of St Anthony painted in 1694. In the suppressed church of St Mark linked to a suppressed monastery were frescoes of Saints John the Baptist and St Bernard Abbot, Saints Michael and Raphael Archangel, plus other frescoes in the chapels including an Annunciacion, Visitation, and frescoes of the Evangelists and the holy father, and Saints. In San Francesco presso Asciano, there was an altarpiece of the Crucifixion completed in 1664. Francesco also painted frescoes of the Last Supper in the refectory of the convent of the Carmine. He also painted an altarpiece for the church of San Pietro alla Magione"

  "text" : "Fred Otash (January 7, 1922 – October 5, 1992) was a Hollywood police officer, private investigator, and author. Fred Otash has been interviewed numerous times in the media, including in 1957 by Mike Wallace, which can be viewed online at the University of Texas. Otash worked for Hollywood Research Incorporated, which did business with the tabloid magazine Confidential. He is also known for being hired by Peter Lawford to investigate Marilyn Monroe. Fred Otash also was involved in the investigation of the \"Wrong Door Raid\" involving Frank Sinatra. Otash died at the age of 70 on October 5, 1992. Otash suffered from emphysema and high blood pressure. He wrote about his life in his memoir, Investigation Hollywood: Memoirs Of Hollywood's Top Private Detective. Fred Otash was the youngest of 6 children and is survived by his daughter, Colleen Otash, and his four sisters, Evelyn Abisalih, Grace Steiner, Selma Otash and Lila Merhige, and one brother Mitchel. Author James Ellroy has used a fictionalized version of Fred Otash in two of his novels from the Underworld USA Trilogy. Otash appears in The Cold Six Thousand and Blood's a Rover. Otash is also the main character in another story by James Ellroy called Shakedown. The movie Chinatown's (1974) main character, played by Jack Nicholson, was also based in part on Fred Otash. As of December 2014, a Fred Otash TV show is in development at HBO and is being produced by Se7en director, David Fincher, as well as the writer of L.A. Confidential, a film which is very inspired by the life and times of Otash, James Ellroy."

  "text" : "Francis Hobart Herrick (19 November 1858 Woodstock, Vermont - 11 September 1940 Cleveland, Ohio) was an American writer, natural history illustrator and Professor of Biology at Adelbert College of Western Reserve University. Herrick attended St. Paul's School in Concord, New Hampshire from where he went to Dartmouth College in 1881. His Ph.D. was obtained at Johns Hopkins University in 1888. The embryology and biology of shellfish, especially lobster, became his consuming interest. He was approached in 1890 by the United States Commissioner of Fisheries to research and publish a comprehensive report on the American Lobster. Over a period of five years Herrick studied lobsters along the seaboards of Massachusetts, Maine and New Hampshire working from a laboratory at Woods Hole, Massachusetts. The finished work was entitled The American Lobster: A study of its habits and development and appeared in volume 15 of the Bulletin of the United States Fish Commission for 1895. This definitive work includes some 100 detailed drawings of Homarus americanus. Herrick was greatly concerned about the unregulated lobster-fishing industry and that the limited migration of lobsters bedevils recovery of lobster populations once depleted. His 1917 work was the first critical biography of John James Audubon and negated the public's romanticised image of him as an American woodsman. An ornithologist with a particular interest in the aetiology of instinct in wild birds, Herrick was the first researcher to study the bald eagle in the field, and help popularise wildlife photography in the process. He became professor emeritus in 1929."
