  "text" : "Georg Ludwig August Volkens (13 July 1855 – 10 January 1917) was a German botanist born in Berlin. He studied natural sciences at the Universities of Berlin and Würzburg, graduating in 1882 with the thesis Ueber Wasserausscheidung in liquider Form an den Blaettern hoeherer Pflanzen. As a student he was influenced by Alexander Braun (1805–1877), Julius von Sachs (1832–1897) and Simon Schwendener (1829–1919). In 1884-85 he conducted botanical research in Egypt on behalf of the Königlich-Preußischen Akademie der Wissenschaften. In 1887 he obtained his habilitation, followed by work as an assistant to Adolf Engler (1844–1930) at the Botanical Museum in Berlin. Later he journeyed to East Africa, where he performed phytogeographical studies at Mount Kilimanjaro, as well as conducting investigations on the regions' resources from an economic standpoint. On the expedition he collected numerous plant species new to science. In the years 1899 to 1900 he took part in a scientific/economic mission to the Mariana and Caroline Islands, where he spent seven months on the island of Yap. In 1902 he performed botanical duties at Buitzenborg, Java in an effort to distribute plants to Africa, New Guinea, Samoa and the Carolines for agricultural purposes. In 1900 he returned to Berlin, where he taught classes and conducted scientific research at the museum. The plant genus Volkensinia is named after him, as are numerous botanical species."

  "text" : "Count George of Nassau-Beilstein, later also Count of Nassau-Dillenburg, (1 September 1562 – 9 August 1623 in Dillenburg) was the third son of Count John VI \"the Elder\" of Nassau-Dillenburg (1536-1606) from his first marriage with Elisabeth of Leuchtenberg, In 1576, he studied at the University of Heidelberg. In 1578, he went to the Netherlands, to serve in the army, under Count of Günther XLI of Schwarzburg-Arnstadt. While in the Netherlands, he tried to be elected Bishop of Utrecht, but failed. From 1580, he attended the court of Margrave George Frederick of Brandenburg-Ansbach-Kulmbach. In 1604, he purchased his first territory, the district and city of Driedorf from his father. After his father died in 1606, George and his brothers decided to divide Nassau-Dillenburg. When this division was implemented in 1607, William Louis received Nassau-Dillenburg; John VII received Nassau-Siegen; Ernst Casimir received Nassau-Diez; John Louis received Nassau-Hadamar and George received Nassau-Beilstein, which included the Lordships of Westerwald, Burbach and Hickengrund. In 1611, he purchased the Nassau share of the district of Wehrheim, which Nassau shared with Trier, from his brother John VII. Until 1612, George resided in Dillenburg, as regent for his absent brother William Louis, who was in Holland. After his brother returned, George moved into Beilstein Castle, in his own territory. In 1618, George reached an agreement with his brother John VII, in which John ceded to George the right to inherit Dillenburg if William Louis were to die childless. This came to happen in 1620. So George moved back to Dillenburg and became the founder of the younger Nassau-Dillenburg line. Nassau-Beilstein was divided, with George keeping Burbach and Hickengrund. He ruled his territory well; like his brothers he issued court regulations, administrative and law enforcement regulations. George died in Dillenburg in 1623."

His estates were sequestered by Parliament and on 22 February 1646, he requested \"a moderate composition\" because he \"disliked the business, and was never in arms\". He was willing to submit to a fine and on 7 April, a fine was set a £500. In addition to this, he was assessed by the Committee of Advance of Money at £400 on 29 January 1647. However his debts were judged to amount to £4476 on 16 November 1648 and his assessment was taken off on 24 November \" as his debts are much more than the whole value of his estate.\" Fleetwood was living in 1651."

Techron was among the first companies to produce printed circuit boards in North America. As a leader in the emerging circuit board market, Techron dealt with many high-profile clients in need of the cutting edge technology. The most notable client that George dealt with was NASA. During the Apollo program in 1967, NASA choose Techron's boards when constructing their space craft. After managing the company for over two decades as CEO, George later sold the Techron to a local competitor. George retired in Watertown, Massachusetts, where he lived through the rest of his life passing at age 83. He was the husband to wife Julie, father of five (Mary, Karen, Lisa, Donna and Tom) and grandfather of ten (Daniel, Elise, Mia, Peter, Derek, Genna, Haley, Stephen, Jonathan & Kayla)."

Soon afterwards he became Professor of Organic Chemistry at Armstrong College, later part of University of Newcastle. He retired in 1954. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1937. His candidacy citation read: \"Distinguished as an organic chemist. Author or joint-author of about 45 scientific memoirs published in the Journal of the Chemical Society. These cover a wide range of topics, of which the more significant are new synthetic methods, especially in the quinoline group; strychnine and brucine; the lupin alkaloids; the constitution of santonin; catalytic production of polynuclear compounds; experiments on hexadeuterobenzene. Made outstanding contributions to chemistry of lupinane, encountering for the first time cis and transfused rings in isomeric octahydropyrrocolines. Noteworthy too are his synthetical studies in the decaline group, and on rearrangements in the course of selenium dehydrogenations.\" He was a fearless rugby player, and represented Cornwall twice in 1913. He married Angela Mary Gertrude Evans in 1931; they had three sons and a daughter."

He was born in the 5th century at Lichos, in the lower valley of the River Saison, into a Roman Catholic family. During his youth Catholics were persecuted by the Arian Euric, king of the Visigoths (466-485). Euric's successor, Alaric II (485-507), was tolerant towards them, permitting among other things the creation of Catholic bishoprics, including that of Oloron, of which Gratus was the first bishop. He took part in the Council of Agde in 506, where 34 Catholic bishops of the Visigothic kingdom met under the chairmanship of Saint Caesarius of Arles. In 507, the Visigoths were defeated by Clovis at the Battle of Vouillé. After the death of Clovis in 511, however, there was a still a strong Visigothic presence south of the Garonne (Aquitaine). Gratus is believed to have died at Jaca during this period, from where his body was retrieved and brought to its place of permanent rest in Oloron-Sainte-Marie. His feast day is 11 October."

He served in the provincial cabinet as Minister of Municipal Affairs from 1912 to 1921. Langley resigned from cabinet in 1921 at the request of Premier William Martin after Langley attempted to put pressure on a Saskatchewan magistrate. He resigned from the assembly in 1922.

They couple have ten children. Prior to becoming Mayor, Banu was a corporator from the Katipalla ward, having been elected twice into the position. Banu won the 2012 mayoral election after the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) candidate, Roopa Bangera, was disqualified due to a failure to properly submit her caste certificate in the prescribed format within the given time, and that the certificate subsequently submitted by her was past the time stipulated for filing the nomination. As a result, Banu became the only running candidate and was hence declared elected by default. This incident came as a shock to many, since the BJP nominee was widely considered to be most likely to win. Due to the absence of any provision in the Karnataka Municipal Corporations Act, 1976, to call for a no-confidence motion, Banu will serve as Mayor for the proscribed term from 7 March 2012 to 20 February 2013. She took office on 7 March 2012, with BJP politician Amitakala as Deputy Mayor."

  "text" : "George Strachan was an English cricketer. He was born at Prestbury, near Cheltenham, 21 November 1850. His height was 6 ft. 1 in.; weight, 13 st. According to W. G. Grace: He was a good bowler and batsman: but it was by his brilliant fielding that he made his reputation; and there can be little doubt that at long-leg or cover-point he had few equals in his own time. Many a batsman, having hit a ball in the direction of cover-point, started to run, being ignorant of his wonderful quickness and great reach, and feeling certain he could never get to it; but not only did he get to it, but picking it up with surprising quickness, he had it into the wicket-keeper's or bowler's hands like a flash and seconds before the batsman had reached his crease! At Cheltenham College, where he was educated, they tell of a smart bit of fielding which he did when the M.C.C. played the College Eleven one year. He was bowling to George Hearne, who stepped back and pulled him twice between the wicket and mid-on. The third ball was bowled in the same place, and Hearne pulled it again; but Mr. Strachan moved a yard or two when he saw him make up his mind to hit in the same way, and brought off a remarkable catch yards from the wicket. As a batsman he had sound defence, and hit freely. He represented Gloucestershire, Middlesex, and Surrey. He captained Surrey from 1872 to 1875 and from 1877 to 1878. For the Gentlemen v. Players in 1872 he met with marked success as a bowler, and in the same match at the Oval in 1875 he took five wickets in 21 balls, off which no runs were scored. George Strachan died on 29 December 1901, at Middelburg, Transvaal, South Africa."

  "text" : "George Broadbent redirects here. For Sir George Broadbent, 4th Baronet (1935-1992), see the Broadbent baronets George Robert Broadbent (3 November 1863 – 28 October 1947), was an Australian cycling champion and map publisher. Broadbent was born in Ashby, Victoria, the son of George Adam Broadbent, (who migrated from Lancashire), and his wife Elizabeth, née Ruffhead. The family moved to North Melbourne and Broadbent attended the Errol Street school. On leaving school, he became a draper, like his father, and became an early bicycling and bicycle-racing enthusiast. Broadbent held most Victorian and Australian cycling road records at various times. Two performances on solid tyres—203 miles (327 km) in 24 hours on a penny farthing, and 100 miles (161 km) in 6 hours 20 minutes on a 'safety' bicycle—were never surpassed. The Australian Cyclist periodical described him 'the finest road rider that Australia has ever produced'. Broadbent won the five–mile Australasian championship for 1893-4 and the five-mile Victorian championship in 1894–5. Broadbent married Louisa Santy at Richmond, Victoria on 29 December 1887. Broadbent was a foundation councillor of the League of Victorian Wheelmen in October 1893. He contested the first Warrnambool-Melbourne race in 1895, and was active in the Good Roads Movement. In 1896 he issued a road map of Victoria, 'prepared … after some sixteen years riding and touring in all parts of the Colony', which indicated general topography, distances, and roads classified as 'good', 'fair' or 'ridden with difficulty'. It became Victoria's standard road map. Broadbent bought a steam-driven motor car in 1898, contributed regularly to the Argus and Australasian on both cycling and touring and, in December 1903, attended the meeting which established the (Royal) Automobile Club of Victoria. Broadbent was an active member of the Great Ocean Road Trust created in 1919 to establish a road from Barwon Heads to Warrnambool. Broadbent retired in December 1937; he was one of fifteen surviving founders to be elected life-members of the Royal Automobile Club of Victoria in May 1947. Broadbent died at his home in Hawthorn, Victoria on 28 October 1947; he was survived by three sons and six of his seven daughters. His second son Robert Arthur (also an amateur and professional cycling champion) represented Australia at the 1924 Paris Olympic Games, succeeded him as tourist manager of the R.A.C.V. and established R. A. Broadbent-Tourist Publications in 1963. His youngest son Edward Albert took over Broadbent's Official Road Guides Co. in 1945."

  "text" : "George William Symonds Jarrett (15 December 1880 – 6 December 1960) was a British politician. During the First World War he joined the National Democratic Party (NDP), which had been set up as a pro-war party for Labour supporters. In 1917 he was appointed as the party's Chief Organiser. At the General Election of 1918 he contested Mansfield, Nottinghamshire for the NDP. His main apponent was the Labour candidate, William Carter. Jarrett did not face a Unionist opponent but did face a Liberal candidate and an Independent candidate. His prospects improved when he received endorsement as the official Coalition candidate from Prime Minister David Lloyd George and the Unionist Leader, Andrew Bonar Law. This was helpful enough to enable him to present himself as the main challenger to Labour, however, not enough to help him win. After 1918, the Coalition Government-supporting NDP was wound up and many of its members joined Lloyd George's National Liberal party as did Jarrett. When the Unionist party decided to end the Coaliion in 1922 and force an election, Jarrett continued to support the idea of an anti-socialist coalition. For the 1922 General Election he switched constituencies, to contest the Labour seat of Dartford, Kent, held by John Edmund Mills. He stood as a National Liberal candidate. He was again not confronted by a Unionist candidate but again had to compete with a Liberal candidate. This time he was successful, gaining the seat for the old coalition parties.Parliamentary Debates (Hansard). House of Commons. December 21, 1922. His time as an MP was interrupted in 1923 by another General Election. For this election, Lloyd George re-united his National Liberals with the main Liberal party. Jarrett did not join the Liberal party and sought re-election in Dartford as a Constitutionalist. He again faced John Mills as the Labour candidate, but this time there was no Liberal candidate. However, this time he lost. He did not have long to wait for a chance to get back into parliament as another General election was called for 1924. However, this time he switched to contest the Labour seat of Edmonton, Middlesex. Again he had a free run against the Labour candidate, the incumbent Francis Alfred Broad. He again stood as a Constitutionalist. Yet he narrowly failed to win the seat. His next attempt to re-enter parliament came in 1926 when he stood as a Conservative candidatre at the East Ham North by-election. The Conservatives were hoping to hold the seat they had gained at the general election. Jarrett faced both Labour and Liberal opponents and failed to hold the seat, finishing second to Labour. His final attempt to get back into parliament was at the 1929 General election when he contested Edmonton again, this time as a Conservative candidate. However, despite the absence of a Liberal candidate, he was not able to defeat the Labour candidate. He married Janet Mary Dunning in 1912."

  "text" : "Gerhard Melvin Dahl (June 8, 1876 – December 29, 1953) was an American financier. He was born in Fort Howard, Brown County, Wisconsin to Theodore Halverson Dahl, a Lutheran minister, and Rebekka Oline (Gjertsen) Dahl, who immigrated from Norway in about 1865. Dahl was a graduate of the University of Wisconsin, and as an attorney served as City Attorney and later was elected District Attorney in Portage County, Wisconsin. On June 5, 1900 Dahl married his first wife, Georgeana (Cate) Dahl, the youngest daughter of Judge George Washington Cate of Stevens Point, Portage county, Wisconsin, who served one term in the U.S. House of Representatives as a Democrat. In 1902 the Dahls suffered the loss of their only child, George Theodore Dahl, before his first birthday. In 1910 Dahl was appointed Street Railroad Commissioner in Cleveland, Ohio. In 1912 went to work for Sidney V. Mitchell as vice president of Electric Bond and Share Company (engaged in financing and managing public utilities in many states). On January 1, 1917 Dahl became a vice president of Chase Bank in New York City. In that position he led the three-year successful reorganization of the New Orleans Railway and Light Company. The Brooklyn–Manhattan Transit Corporation in New York was set up in 1923 with as its chairman. He was originally a member of the BRT reorganization committee when William S. Menden was president. Their goal was to re-vitalize the BMT, improve service, improve its public image, and enhance shareholder value. Dahl was chairman of the board of BMT from 1924-1943. For many years Dahl and NYC Mayor John Hylan feuded about transit issues in a bitter, personal and public way. There are many articles in New York papers about this feud. Dahl published the book \"Transit Truths\" in 1924 to educate the public about the issues. Dahl became a millionaire as chairman of BMT and was on the board of directors of dozens of corporations. He and his wife Georgeana lived in the Ritz Tower Apartment Hotel in New York City, located at the crossroads of the Upper East Side - the corner of 57th Street and Park Avenue, where exclusive shops and artistic enterprises on 57th met luxury apartment buildings on Park Avenue. The Ritz-Carlton Company managed the building and its restaurants. The Dahls wintered in Palm Beach, Florida (traveling back and forth in a private railroad car) and entertained lavishly at the Whitehall luxury hotel. They maintained a yacht in Florida, an estate in Smithtown, Long Island worth $500,000, belonged to several golf, tennis and yacht clubs, and raised horses and Great Dane dogs. On February 8, 1924, the body of 26-year-old musician and aspiring actress Louise Lawton was discovered in her apartment, murdered by suffocation. The detectives found expensive furniture, a healthy bank account, and a framed picture of a man that was identified as Gerhard Dahl. Mr. Dahl did know her and her parents in connection with supporting her musical career. Louise was known to several prominent New Yorkers. Mr. Dahl offered to cooperate with the investigation, and was never further implicated in her death by any prosecution. In the late 1920s Dahl took to gambling, and joined the Sons of Hope (always hoping to improve their hands), a group of prominent wealthy men who met to drink and gamble. The table limit was $2,000. In John F. Kennedy's book, Why England Slept, he described an epic poker battle between Dahl and New York journalist Herbert Bayard Swope as \"a battle to the death between the two greatest extraverts of the Western World.\" At this time in his life his assets were worth about $5,000,000. Frederick K. Strauss, a man of Wall Street, once told a mutual friend that, \"In dealing with him (Dahl), you are dealing with the most arrogant man in New York.\" Around the time of the stock market crash and into the Great Depression, Dahl had huge loans with Chase National Bank, at one time reaching $4,758,000. On 15 Jun 1932 he owed Chase $3,183,358.19, which was written down to $615,000. Chase National Bank held Dahl's BMT stock as collateral. In early June 1932 Chase sold 55,000 of those shares before the price dropped drastically. This was before insider stock trading became illegal. Dahl was innocent and in fact protested against the sale, but Albert H. Wiggin, president of Chase, was also part of BMT and used the insider information to maximize their stock sale value. (See \"The causes of the 1929 stock market crash: a speculative orgy or a new era?\" by Harold Bierman, and \"Privileged Characters\" book by Morris Robert Werner) After the death of his wife in 1949, Dahl became addicted to alcohol and barbiturates. His world collapsed until he had about $10.50 in the bank and he checked himself into Bellevue Hospital to kick the habits at age 74. Dahl married a second time (Mary E. ?) in 1952. Dahl died at Brooklyn Hospital on December 29, 1953."

All relevant information became quickly subject to censorship in China, but were disseminated on the international Internet. Local Chinese activists organized a postcard campaign, and gather funds for his defense. Eventually after 16 days Guo and two other bloggers arrested in the same investigation were released.

A high-school dropout, Gund joined the United States Marines in 1955 when he was 18 years old. His early years in the Marines brought him to the city of San Francisco, where he soon took up residence. After his military service, Gund attended Menlo College in Atherton, California, but never graduated. He instead began bringing in Eastern European films and distributing them around San Francisco and the US, using his membership in the San Francisco Film Society as a catalyst. Gund was also dedicated to the world of sports. Earlier NHL-related business involvements included terms as president of the Cleveland Barons, chairman of the Minnesota North Stars, and partner with the California Golden Seals and the San Jose Sharks. Gund was also a member of the International Council of USA Hockey, a chairman and trustee of the U.S. Hockey Hall of Fame, and a trustee of the USA Hockey Foundation. While married to Iara Lee, Gund produced many of her films, including most recently Cultures of Resistance, along with earlier films Synthetic Pleasures and Modulations. He was President of Caipirinha Productions, which produces Lee's films and, along with Lee, also founded the Iara Lee and George Gund III Foundation, which is involved with \"philanthropy, voluntarism and grantmaking.\" In 1989 he was a member of the jury at the 16th Moscow International Film Festival. Gund died on January 15, 2013 at the age of 75 after a lengthy battle with stomach cancer."

They played at the Teatro alla Scala in Milan; the Teatro del Corso and of Arena del Sole in Bologna; the Obizzi theater in Padua; as well as theaters in Perugia and Faenza. His company specialized in comedies by Carlo Goldoni, and plays such as La moglie saggia, Le tre Zelinde, Pamela nubile, in Ottavia and in Antigone by Vittorio Alfieri and the Galeotto Manfredi by Vincenzo Monti. Giovanni, through excessive gambling, became peniless, and his company broke up by 1827. Giovanni and his wife were reduced to work for the company of the actress Carolina Internari. Natalina soon died of typhus after 1828. Andolfati also worked for the company of N. Medoni in 1834, as did his daughter Annetta."

He worked briefly at Cambridge and then the Curie Laboratory, where he worked with both J.J. Thomson and Pierre Curie. He eventually rose to full professor at the University of Giessen, however, with the rise of Naziism he was dismissed from his position. He eventually emigrated to the USA and became a professor at Louisiana State University. Jaffe is best known for his classic paper \"Zur Theorie der Ionisation in Kolonnen\" (Theory of columnar ionization), which was published in 1913. In it he proposes a model for charge recombination and charge collection efficiency for a \"column\" of charge generated by ionizing radiation."

Noszlopy) of several books on the public sculpture of the English midlands. At the time of his sudden death on 5 June 2011, at the age 78, he was Emeritus Professor and Senior Research Fellow at Birmingham City University's Institute of Art and Design. Noszlopy was born in Budapest, Hungary and graduated with a degree in museology (art history and subsidiary subjects) from Eötvös Loránd University in 1956. In October 1956 he was elected to the Revolutionary Committee of the Hungarian Artists' Association, but was arrested shortly after the second Soviet military intervention, the same year. He fled Hungary and lived briefly in Vienna and Paris, then settled in London. In 1960, after three years study at the Courtauld Institute, he became a teacher at Coventry College of Art, soon moving to Birmingham College of Art. In 1991, following the fall of communism, Eötvös Loránd University awarded him a DPhil summa cum laude. He was a foundation member of the Association of Art Historians. Adrian Hicken, a professor at Bath Spa University, said in an obituary that Noszlopy had \"made notable contributions to the teaching and dissemination of art history in England for almost fifty years\"."

  "text" : "S. Gopalan, pen-name Gopulu (18 June 1924 – 29 April 2015), was a Tamil illustrator and cartoonist, known for his work for the Tamil humour magazine Ananda Vikatan. Born in Tanjore in 1924, Gopulu spent his early years in the city. He studied at the Kumbakonam School of Art. In 1941, he came to Chennai looking for a job in Ananda Vikatan. There, he met the legendary cartoonist 'Mali', who commissioned a number of paintings for the magazine's Deepavali special. It was not till December 1944, however, that Mali offered Gopulu a job at the magazine. (Mali was also the one who gave Gopulu his pen-name). In the course of the next twenty or so years, till 1968, Gopulu did political cartoons, cover designs and illustrated columns for the magazine. As an illustrator, Gopulu worked on popular serials such as Thillana Mohanambal and Washingtonil Thirumanam. He is known for his work with the writer Devan for whom he illustrated the serial Thuppariyum Sambu in comics form. Devan's bumbling detective is remembered in the form in which Gopulu first drew him. Gopulu also traveled with the writer Saavi in 1953-54, to Ajanta, Ellora, Delhi, Jaipur, Calcutta for a travel series. In 1972, Gopulu started his own ad agency, Ad Wave Advertising. He designed the logo of the Tamil magazine Kungumam, and that of Sun TV too. Later, he quit advertising and began to work as a freelance illustrator for magazines such as Kalki, Amudhasurabhi, Vikatan and Kungumam. Gopulu was given the ‘Kalaimamani' award by the Government of Tamil Nadu on 26 November 1991. He is a recipient of the Murasoli Award and the M. A. Chidambaram Chettiar Award. In 2001 he was honoured with the lifetime achievement award as part of the inaugural function of the Indian Institute of Cartoonists in Bangalore."

  "text" : "Giuseppe Antonio Torri (1655 – c. 1713) was an Italian architect of the early 18th century. He was born and died in Bologna, where he was active in a late-Baroque style. His surname is also spelled Tórri. He initially trained with his father, Giovanni Battista. On 30 March 1697 he was appointed architect to the Senate of Bologna. He worked on the designs used to reconstruct the Collegio Germanico-Ungarico (1700), now a seminary. He helped design the building's interior courtyard. In 1703, he designed the present building for the parish church of San Tommaso dal Mercate, which was completed by Giovanni Antonio Taruffi. He is said to have invented machinery (trafila, 1710) for the mint at Bologna; and helped with the building of the astronomical observatory at the University of Bologna. Other buildings in Bologna to which he contributed include the church of San Gabriele (begun 1700, finished 1720), the palazzo San Giorgio (1709), the church of San Domenico in Modena (1708). He contributed some designs for the church of the Santissima Trinita that had been begun by F. Martini in 1662. He also contributed some plans, at a distance, for a palazzo that William III of England contemplated. The building presently housing the Court of Appeals in Bologna, the Palazzo Baciocchi, previously Ranuzzi, has a grand staircase designed by Torri. He also contributed to reconstructions and modernizations at Palazzo Scarani, Palazzo Isolani de San Stefano, and Palazzo Pepoli Campogrande. Among his pupils was Alfonso Torreggiani."

  "text" : "Gilbert fitzBaderon of Monmouth (died about 1189) was one of the two sons of Baderon fitzWilliam. When Baderon died, at some date between 1170 and 1176, Gilbert succeeded him as lord of Monmouth and holder of Monmouth Castle. Gilbert is best known as a patron of literature. It was in Gilbert's time that the Anglo-Norman (or Cambro-Norman) poet Hue de Rotelande, who lived at Credenhill in Herefordshire, wrote his verse romance Ipomedon, which was among the most popular works in its genre in medieval England. The original text in Anglo-Norman (a variant of Old French spoken and written in Norman England and Wales) was translated at least three times into Middle English under the variant title Ipomadon. Hue de Rotelande afterwards wrote a sequel, Protheselaus, which he dedicated to his patron Gilbert fitzBaderon. Around 1170 Gilbert acted as witness when his sister Rohese of Monmouth and his brother-in-law Hugh de Lacy, Lord of Meath, made a donation to Monmouth Priory. On his death Gilbert was succeeded as lord of Monmouth by John of Monmouth."

  "text" : "Sir George Samuel Elliott (1847 – 4 May 1925) was a British businessman and politician. Born in Islington, he was educated at the City of London School and entered business as a refreshment contractor with premises at Upper Street.  In 1875 he was elected to Islington Vestry. He subsequently became a member of the Islington Board of Guardians: during his 38 years membership he was chairman for 20 years and vice-chairman for 9. When the first elections to the London County Council were held in January 1889, Elliott was elected as one of two councillors representing Islington South. Originally a member of the Liberal-backed Progressive Party, he was re-elected in 1892 and 1895.  There was some doubt as to his party allegiance by the time of the 1898 election: as a Unionist he was seen as being aligned to the Conservative supported opposition Moderate Party, although he was nominated by the Progressives. He was later described as an \"Independent Progressive\", and at the 1901 election was returned unopposed, taking the Moderate whip. He stood at the 1904 council election as an independent, but was defeated. Elliott was elected to the Islington Borough Council as a Conservative, and was thirteen times mayor of Islington: in 1902/03, from 1906–09, and from 1910–18.   As mayor during the First World War he was largely responsible for raising the 21st (Service) Battalion (Islington), The Middlesex Regiment.   He was knighted in 1917. At the 1918 general election he was elected as Coalition Conservative member of parliament for Islington West.   He retired from parliament at the next general election in 1922. He married Elizabeth Frances Hellier, Upottery, Devon and the couple had six children.  He died suddenly at his home \"The Chalkpit\", Maidenhead, Berkshire, in 1925. He was buried at Abney Park Cemetery."

  "text" : "Garrett Madison (born November 3, 1978) is an American mountaineer and is one of the world's top high altitude mountaineering guides, having personally guided 37 clients to the summit of Mt Everest between the years 2009-2015, more than any other American. Garrett began guiding professionally in 1999 on Mount Rainier, and his company, Madison Mountaineering, provides domestic training programs and local summit climbs, operates on the highest peaks on all seven continents, and specializes in climbs of the highest mountains in the world. On May 19–20, 2011, he reached the summit of Mt Everest on his fourth successful attempt as expedition leader and guide for Alpine Ascents International, and reached the summit of Lhotse (4th highest mountain in the world) only 21 hours later as guide to Tom Halliday. Also on the expedition was guide Michael Horst who made both summits as well in under a 24-hour period, a few days earlier. This historic achievement marks the first time in history that both peaks Mt Everest and Lhotse were summited together in less than 24 hours, and Madison repeated the \"double header\" feat again in 2013. In 2014, Garrett led the first ever successfully ‘guided’ ascent of K2, arguably the hardest and most dangerous mountain in the world, reaching the summit with 2 climbers and 3 Sherpas on July 27, 2014. Garrett also regularly guides many \"7 Summits\" expeditions such as Aconcagua, Vinson Massif, Kilimanjaro, Elbrus, etc., during the year. In addition, Garrett is regularly involved with film productions on Everest, participating in 4 different features over the last 3 years. Madison was leading a team of climbers up Mt Everest when the April 2015 Nepal earthquake triggered an avalanche, resulting in the deadliest day in Everest's history. The team's doctor, Eve Girawong, was one of the American fatalities."

In 2014, he endorsed the book \"Faith and Wrestling: How the Role of a Wrestler Mirrors the Christian Life\" by author Michael Fessler. Gene's endorsement reads, “My belief has always been that wrestling is a microcosm of life. Most of the things that we are going to experience in life are going to be experienced in a wrestling career. Michael does an excellent job in paralleling the relationship between faith and wrestling. His book expresses the importance of developing the total athlete—spiritually, physically, emotionally, and socially. I look forward to the day when people (including wrestlers) from ‘every nation, tribe, people and language’ will gather to worship our God. (Revelation 7:9, 11).”"

  "text" : "George Pitt (9 May 1625 - 27 July 1694) was an English landowner and politician who sat in the House of Commons from 1660 to 1679. Pitt was the eldest surviving son of Edward Pitt of Strathfieldsaye, Hampshire and his wife Rachel Morton, daughter of Sir George Morton, 1st Baronet of Milborne St. Andrew, Dorset. He succeeded to Stratfield Saye House on the death of his father in 1643 and served briefly as a cornet in the Royalist army from 1643 to 1644. He travelled abroad from 1644 to 1646 and was a student of Middle Temple in 1652 and Inner Temple in 1654. In 1660, Pitt was elected Member of Parliament for Wareham in the Convention Parliament. He was made gentleman of the privy chamber in June 1660 and J.P. for Hampshire and Gloucestershire in July 1660. In August 1660 he became commissioner for assessment for Dorset until 1664 and for Hampshire until 1680. He was commissioner for oyer and terminer for Middlesex in November 1660. In 1661 he was re-elected MP for Wareham in the Cavalier Parliament. He was commissioner for assessment for Westminster from 1664 to 1669 and J.P. for Westminster from 1665 to 1689. He was commissioner for assessment for Gloucestershire and Wiltshire from 1673 to 1680. In 1674 he obtained the post of comptroller to the Duke of York until 1675 and in 1675 became a freeman of Portsmouth. He was J.P. for Dorset from 1680 and commissioner for assessment for Gloucestershire, Hampshire and Wiltshire from 1689 to 1690. Pitt died at the age of 69. Pitt married in 1657, Lady Jane, widow successively of George, 6th Baron Chandos of Sudeley, and Sir William Sedley, 4th Baronet of Southfleet, Kent and daughter of John Savage, 2nd Earl Rivers. They had three sons and four daughters."

  "text" : "Guido von Pirquet (March 30, 1880 – April 17, 1966) was an Austrian pioneer of astronautics and a Baron of a lower noble family. Born near Vienna, he was educated at Technische Hochschule in Vienna and Graz. He developed an interest in rocketry, building and testing model rockets in 1927. In 1928, he proposed the idea of building a space station in low Earth orbit (LEO) for fueling vehicles to travel to the other planets. He published detailed calculations for how this type of mission could be completed. For this reason, he is considered the true \"father of the space station\". Along with Rudolf Zwerina, he founded the Austrian Society for Rocket Technology in 1931. His interest in rocketry waned following the Anschluss in 1938. Guido von Pirquet is one of several scientists working in the pre-spaceflight era (1920-1957) who fully understood the promise of the gravity assist method for reducing flight time and increasing payload to the outer planets. He gave detailed formulas showing how close passage of Jupiter could be used to make a large change in the velocity and orbital energy of a spacecraft. His vector diagrams clearly show the gravity assist mechanism that are identical to those used later by Krafft Ehricke (1956) and much later by Minovitch (1961). Minovitch claims incorrectly the he is the \"inventor\" of the gravity assist space flight technique.. Pirquet crater on the Moon is named after him. He was inducted as an honorary fellow of the British Interplanetary Society in 1949, their highest honor. In 1976, he was inducted into the International Space Hall of Fame. His brother, Clemens von Pirquet, became a scientist and pediatrician."

  "text" : "Georg-Andreas \"Andrew\" Pogany (born in 1971 in Munich, Germany) is a former United States Army Staff Sergeant and a posttraumatic stress disorder diagnosis advocate. In April 2005 Pogany was honorably discharged due to medical reasons related to PTSD. However, less than two years earlier, on October 14, 2003 Pogany's separation status and reputation was in serious jeopardy as he became the first American soldier since the Vietnam War to be charged with cowardice. During Pogany's service, he was an interrogator for the Green Berets. On only his second night in Iraq Pogany witnessed the gruesome death of an Iraqi who was cut in half by machine gun fire. He told his superiors that he was suffering from panic attacks and was headed towards a nervous breakdown. Soon after his request his superiors sent him to Fort Carson, Colorado, to face a court-martial for cowardice, a charge which may be punishable by death. The charge was later reduced to dereliction of duty, and was ultimately dropped on Dec 18, 2003. The Army offered Pogany a non-judicial punishment proceeding, but he instead requested a court-martial. Army psychologists said that Pogany had no psychological disorders, but had symptoms consistent with PTSD. Pogany claims that his panic attacks may have been related to Lariam, an antimalarial drug that he and other Ft. Carson soldiers took on a weekly basis prior to leaving for Iraq. The drug's manufacturer, Roche, has received over 3,000 reports of side effects, including paranoia, psychosis and aggression. The Army dropped all charges against Pogany, and a spokesman stated that Pogany “may have a medical problem that requires care and treatment.” After Pogany retired from the military, he has worked as a veterans' and active duty service advocate for issues related to health and military justice. He founded and currently manages \"J1W2\", or \"Just One Wounded Warrior\" which seeks to connect veteran and active military to mental health care professionals."

  "text" : "George Howard or Halsey (1622 - 17 September 1671) was an English politician who sat in the House of Commons between 1660 and 1671. Howard was the son of Lady Mary Howard, daughter of Sir John Fitz of Fitzford. She was married four times and had been estranged from her third husband, Sir Charles Howard of Clun Castle Shropshire, for 18 months when she gave birth to Howard in \"some obscure place near London\". His father was alleged to be a servant George Cuttford of Walreddon, Whitchurch, Devon. The child was christened George Halsey and his existence concealed until he was nine years old. His mother married Sir Richard Grenville, 1st Baronet after the death of Sir Charles Howard although they were separated during the Civil War, and later when he was banished. Howard was commissioner for militia for Devon in March 1660. In April 1660, he was elected Member of Parliament in a double return at both Tavistock and Bere Alston. In both cases he was allowed to sit on the merits of the election and chose to sit for Tavistock in the Convention Parliament. He was commissioner for assessment from September 1660 to 1669. In 1661 he was again elected in double returns for both Bere Alston and Tavistock and chose Tavistock again in the Cavalier Parliament. He was portreeve at Bere Alston from 1661 to 1662. He was J.P. from after 1666 to 1669. Howard died at the age of about 48 and was buried at Tavistock. Howard married Mary Burnby, daughter of Richard Burnby of Bratton Clovelly, Devon on 10 September 1655."

  "text" : "George Harold Stuart-Bunning (1870–1951), born George Harold Stuart, was a British trade unionist. Born in Oldham, Stuart became a postman and an activist in the Postmen's Federation. He also became active in the Labour Party, and stood unsuccessfully in York at the 1906 general election, then in the Dundee by-election, 1908. Although this second candidature was endorsed by the Scottish section of the party, its National Executive refused to back him, as the party already held the other Dundee seat, and was concerned that it would over-reach itself. Despite this, Keir Hardie spoke on Stuart's platform, and the Dundee Courier enthusiastically reported his criticisms of the ultimately successful Liberal Party candidate, Winston Churchill. Stuart soon became the Secretary of the Federation and, in 1912, he was the main figure involved in founding the Civil Service Federation, a combination containing more than 100,000 members. Under his leadership, the Postmen's Federation opened up membership to women. Duncan Campbell-Smith describes him as the \"single most impressive officer among all the postal union staffs\", and he was centrally involved in the formation of the Union of Post Office Workers. Stuart stood for Parliament again at the North West Durham by-election, 1914, and once more lost to the Liberal candidate. His politics developed over time; at the time of the Dundee election, he was criticised for speaking too little about socialism and for not holding membership of the Independent Labour Party (ILP), but, by 1911, he was regarded as being on the left of the ILP, and was elected to its National Administrative Council, where he worked closely with J. M. McLachlan. Stuart altered his surname to \"Stuart-Bunning\" in deference to his uncle, Theodore Bunning, manager of the Beeston Brewery. He served as President of the Trades Union Congress in 1919, but became involved in various disputes, and resigned all his trade union positions later in the year. He instead became the British Labour representative to the International Labour Organisation. Stuart-Bunning was awarded the OBE and was appointed as Chevalier of the Order of the Crown of Belgium. He also served as a Justice of the Peace. In 1928, Stuart-Bunning was appointed as an executor of Theodore Bunning's estate, and he received a large inheritance."

His mother was from a wealthy family of ironmongers, who after her first husband's death married the mayor of Zurich, Hans Waldmann.Gerold Edlibach married Ursula Röist, with whom he had a total of 18 children. He was employed by the Einsiedeln Abbey to manage its property in the city of Zurich during 1473 to 1480.He was elected to the city council in 1487, but he was forced to retire after the execution of his step-father in 1489. He sat in the council again during 1493 to 1499 and during 1515 to 1524.He acted as a reeve for the city in Bülach in 1488, in Grüningen during 1494 to 1498 and in Greifensee, Zürich during 1505 to 1507.As an opponent of the Reformation in Zürich led by Ulrich Zwingli, he opted to retire from all offices in 1524. His main work is the Zürcher Chronik which documents the history of the Old Swiss Confederacy from 1431 to 1530.The portion covering the time up to 1486 is partly based on the illustrated chronicle by Diebold Schilling the Elder. Edlibach extended the 1486 work adding his own account of contemporary events until his death in 1530, although entries become noticeably briefer after 1517. The manuscript is kept at the Zurich Central Library Edlibach also published a Zürcher Wappenbuch in the 1480s, an account of the Waldmann scandal of 1489 (Waldmannscher Auflauf) and a glossary of Rotwelsch (fickabel des rotwelschtz) in 1490, besides various notes on the Reformation during 1520 to 1527."

From 1859 to 1862 he was editor of the Ohio Statesman. He then retired from the newspaper business to become manager of the state public works. In 1876 Manypenny was appointed chair of a special commission to investigate the issues that led to the Sioux outbreak that year, which included the defeat of the American forces under George Armstrong Custer at the battle of the Little Bighorn. In 1880 he wrote Our Indian Wards which detailed a variety of wrongs perpetrated on the Indians, along with recommendations for reforms."

She began her career as a singer in theatrical revue shows, where she became a popular \"sciantosa\" (i.e., a diva), but later dedicated herself mostly to the canzone napoletana genre, recording with major labels such as Columbia and HMV, and touring intensively abroad. In the mid-1920s, she moved to New York, where she reached the apex of her international popularity with Neapolitan classics such as A cartulina 'e Napule (\"Postcard from Naples\") or E l'emigrante chiagne (\"And the emigrant cries\"). In the early 1950s, she suffered severe health problems; having expressed the desire to die in her hometown in Naples, she actually died during the traversal by boat, off the Algerian coast."

The large number of similar landscapes he painted, especially of heather-colored hills in the region of the Meuse and Creuze likely contributed to relatively sparse attention to his well-executed works.

  "text" : "Blog writer Gabrielle Songe, The Brahma and me, began her journalism career as a stringer employed by The Tri-State Defender, a Memphis weekly newspaper founded in 1951, by John Sengstacke, who served as publisher until his death in 1997. Songe reported on candidates running for local offices during the 1994 election year. In less than 90 days she was hired as a general assignment reporter. The following year her series on Memphis optional schools won an Award of Achievement in the 1995 Mid-South Professional Journalism Awards, a chapter of the Society of Professional Journalists,. Three articles, “2005 Plan represents ‘new hope,’” “Grapes of wrath” and “Cause” won awards in the 1996 Mid-South Professional Journalism Awards. Songe subsequently served as president of the Mid-South chapter of The Society of Professional Journalists. Songe moved her employment in 1996 to The Daily News Publishing Co., Memphis, covering law and government issues and writing a weekly feature in the Focus section for the daily newspaper. As the law and government reporter her article, “Tie-breaking seat produces protracted selection process,” Nov. 20, 1996, described the choice of Shelby County Commissioner Morris Fair as the replacement for outgoing Commissioner Bill Gibbons, and “Seeking shoes,” Jan. 31, 1997, featured unintended consequences of Tennessee’s welfare reform program, Families First, that required children to attend school on a daily basis. However, some impoverished families did not have enough shoes to go around. So siblings shared pairs of shoes and could only attend classes on alternating days. In her personal life as Songe’s care of abandoned canines increased she moved from the city to additional land in a neighboring county where she went to work for the Fayette County Review, a now defunct weekly newspaper. Hired as a feature editor by The Southern Sentinel, Ripley, Miss., in 1997, Songe wrote a weekly column, under the title Perceptions, until 1999. Her publisher sent her to photograph dairy farms during Dairy Month of 1998, where she captured on 35 mm film a Brahma-Holstein calf being born. Learning that he was to be sold in 30 days, she purchased him for $40, and brought him home. The young bull, named Sonny, was the subject of several columns, and later became the featured protagonist in her blog. While working as a contract writer and photographer for The Amory Advertiser, Songe’s photo of a hobo and his traveling German Shepherd took second place in the Mississippi Press Association 2000 Better Newspaper Contest Editorial Division A, presented June 16, 2001. After back-to-back losses of employment and the foreclosure of her farm, Sept. 29, 2010, Songe began to blog at The Brahma and me, weaving through her writing and photography the escapades of her farm animals. In the process she reveals her spiritual journey that leads to her faith as a Christian. Recent entries begin with a devotional passage. A published author Songe’s short story about Sonny appears in CC Writers Shorts II Our Pets – Our Family, an anthology of Christian writers’ works by Amazing Phrase Publishing of Collierville, Tenn."

His most notable contributions are probably his works on the Asteraceae of North America, with several papers published throughout the 1990s that argued for multiple generic names to replace the single polyphyletic name Aster, and his recent and ongoing contributions to the Flora of North America project. Several plant species have been named for Nesom, such as Zeltnera nesomii of the gentian family and Steviopsis nesomii of the aster family. Three genera are named in his honor: Nesomia, Neonesomia, and Guynesomia. The standard author abbreviation G.L.Nesom is used to indicate this individual as the author when citing a botanical name."

She served in the legislature from 1977–82, the Multnomah County Commission from 1985–91, and the Portland City Council from 1991-98. Gretchen Miller met and married Stephen Kafoury while attending Whitman College in the early 1960s. She graduated from Whitman in 1963, with a Music degree. The couple moved to Portland in 1965, but soon afterward they joined the Peace Corps, and Gretchen Kafoury spent two years in Iran, teaching English as a Peace Corps volunteer. They returned to Portland in 1967, and Gretchen Kafoury became a teacher at Portland State University. Kafoury co-founded the Oregon chapter of the National Organization for Women (NOW) in 1970 and the Oregon Women's Political Caucus in 1971. In 1972, she was one of a small group of women (also including Mildred Schwab) who protested the City Club of Portland's policy excluding women members, effecting a change in the club's policy of more than fifty years. By 1975, Gretchen and Stephen Kafoury had divorced, but Gretchen continued to use her married name. She subsequently married two more times, her last marriage ending in 1998, but continued to use the name Gretchen Kafoury or Gretchen Miller Kafoury. Gretchen Kafoury's ex-husband, Stephen Kafoury, preceded her in the legislature, and her daughter Deborah Kafoury served two terms there as well, including one as minority leader. She was elected to the Portland City Council in 1990, and served on the council from 1991 to 1998. Beginning in 1999, Kafoury was an instructor at Portland State University, teaching classes related to homelessness, poverty, and community development. She died on March 13, 2015, aged 72, of natural causes at her Portland home. She was survived by her daughters, Deborah and Katharine Kafoury."

Brown moved to San Francisco in the 1860s. He worked as a lithographer before becoming known as a painter in the 1880s. In San Francisco, he worked at Kuchel & Dressel from 1861–1867. In 1867 he opened his own firm and in 1878 he created The Illustrated History of San Francisco, which consisted of 72 topographical images of the city. Brown's work in the Bay Area and in the Nevada Territory included documentation of settlements, property sales, claims and city boundaries. The following year he sold his company. He left the Bay Area in 1882 and moved to Victoria, British Columbia. While there, he participated in the Amos Bowman Geological Survey. While participating in the survey, he served as draftsman and documented the Cascade Mountains. In 1884 he moved back to the United States and traveled throughout the northwest and west, painting such sites as Mt. Rainier. He lived in Portland, Oregon, painting landscapes and also traveling to Yosemite and Yellowstone National Park to paint. In 1893, Brown moved to St. Paul, Minnesota. In St. Paul he worked again as a draftsman, this time for the United States Army Corps of Engineers and for the city of St. Paul's engineering department. He died in St. Peter, Minnesota in 1918. Brown's works are held in the collections of the Oakland Museum of California, Smithsonian American Art Museum, and the Los Angeles County Museum of Art."

  "text" : "Granville Wellington Carter NA, Fellow National Sculpture Society (November 18, 1920 – November 21, 1992) was an American sculptor. He started his sculpture career by taking up wood carving as a teenager. Many of his wood carved creations would be signed \"Dany\", as he was known by family and friends. His fine wood carvings gained him praise and coverage in local newspapers such as the \"Portland Sunday Telegram\"., and the \"Lewistion Journal\". Carter was featured the 1949 book \"Handicrafts of New England,\" by Allen Eaton. Dany Carter was a prolific whittler of figures and animals. All were executed in his wood of choice - white pine. He also crafted several dioramas, some were scenes from Disney's \"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film),\" and \"Pinocchio.\" Other dioramas included practical lighting effects incorporated into the settings giving them their own dramatic lighting effects. One of his largest carvings titled \"Under the Wire,\" can be viewed at the \"Harness Racing Museum & Hall of Fame\", Goshen, New York. The diorama was donated in 1972 by noted businessman and philanthropist, Louis Resnick. The 4 ft wood harness racing diorama depicts a harrowing scene where a driver is thrown from his sulky, as three trailing sulkies are bearing down on the displaced driver."

A common form of charity for the disabled, Barry was taught the Uilleann pipes, giving him a livelihood and a place within the community. As a bearer of the piping tradition Barry was a popular and respected musician and he traveled throughout western Ireland to play at house dances. He inspired many later pipers such as Willie Clancy (whose father knew Barry) and Johnny Doran. He wrote many tunes that are still in the repertoire of players of Irish traditional music such as \"Garret Barry's jig\", The Humours of Glen, and \"I buried my wife and danced on top of her\"."

She went under two hours and forty minutes for the first time at the Alexander the Great Marathon, where her time of 2:37:39 hours was enough for second place. She bettered this time by almost six minutes with her sixth-place performance at the 2009 Frankfurt Marathon. She was runner-up at the 2010 Marrakesh Marathon and again beat her best to finish in 2:30:55 hours for third at the Maratona d'Italia in Carpi. The 2011 season marked a breakthrough for Rono: she began with a half marathon best of 1:09:08 at the Rabat Half Marathon, then won her first marathon race at the Hannover Marathon. She established herself among the world's best runners over the distance at the Eindhoven Marathon that October. She ran alone in the final 10 km to cross the line in a course record time of 2:24:33 (a personal improvement of more than six minutes). This placed her within the top ten Kenyan runners that year. She returned to Kenya at the end of the year and competed in cross country races, including third places at the Tuskys Wareng Cross Country and Discovery Kenya Cross Country. She was a distant second to Mary Keitany at the RAK Half Marathon at the start of 2012, but was five seconds off a personal best. In her first World Major Marathon appearance, she reached the podium at the 2012 Boston Marathon. Warm temperatures disrupted the event, but she managed to make it a Kenyan sweep in the women's race with her third-place finish. She improved her personal best to 67:58 minutes to win the Udine Half Marathon and took three minutes off her best at the Frankfurt Marathon, where she was second in a time of 2:21:39 hours."

  "text" : "Gordon J. Key authored video game software for the Acorn BBC Micro, Electron and RISC OS platforms in the 1980s and '90s. His most well-known works were published by The Fourth Dimension (earlier known as Impact Software). He is also credited with additional programming routines in FedNet's futuristic flight combat game Star Fighter 3000 (1994), and authored Party Machine for the Amstrad CPC. In an article about the Electron referring to Key's Holed Out! golf simulator, Steve Botterill (co-founder of The Fourth Dimension) referred to Key as being \"one of the most brilliant programmers\" he had ever met. In an interview in the November 1988 issue of The Micro User, Key explained that his development as a programmer began for pleasure, modifying existing games. He then used increasingly more machine code in an effort to produce magazine games of equal quality to commercial titles. At the time of publishing Clogger, he was learning ARM assembly language in addition to setting up a vehicle restoration business for old buses. In 2010, Key answered a number of questions posed by registered members of The Icon Bar forum. He has not written any commercial software since starting in the antiques trade."

Some sample thoughts of the book are:1. Express Your hope in me. Come out of yourself. Enter into Me.2. Do not fail to give Me your sufferings. They help sinners.3. I asked you to wake up in the arms of the Father because each one of your mornings is a new creation.4. I asked you to fall asleep in the Holy Spirit because your last conscious breath should be in love.5. Try to understand My yearning for you, for all My children."

  "text" : "Gertrud Virginia Adelborg (10 September 1853 in Karlskrona – 25 January 1942) was a Swedish feminist and a leading member of the women's rights movement. She was the daughter of Captain (naval) and noble Jacob Adelborg and Hedvig af Uhr, and the sister of painter Ottilia Adelborg and textile artist Maria Adelborg. She never married. Adelborg was educated by a governess at home and in girls schools. She worked as a teacher in 1874–79, and was employed at Svea hovrätt 1881–83. Gertrud Adelborg was active within the Swedish women's movement and the struggle for woman suffrage. She worked for the bureau of the Fredrika Bremer Association or FBF in 1884–1907 (from 1886 as chairperson of the Stockholm bureau) and was a member of the central comity of FBF in 1897–1915. She initiated the FBF:s school for the education of female teachers at Rimforsa, where she belonged to the school board in 1907–21. In 1899, a delegation from the FBF presented a suggestion of woman suffrage to prime minister Erik Gustaf Boström. The delegation was headed by Agda Montelius, accompanied by Gertrud Adelborg, who had written the demand. This was the first time the Swedish women's movement themselves had officially presented a demand for suffrage. Gertrud Adelborg was a member of the central comity in the National Association for Women's Suffrage (Landsföreningen för kvinnans politiska rösträtt, LKPR) in 1903-06. In 1907, she headed the LKPR delegation which presented their demand to the monarch Oscar II of Sweden himself. She reminded Oscar II of the reforms regarding women's rights which had been passed by his father Oscar I of Sweden, and continued with expressing her hope that \"The son of Oscar I would attach his name to a suggestion of women suffrage\". According to Lydia Wahlström: \"as soon as the king heard the name of his father, his interest was awoken\", and Oscar II promised his support, but added that as a constitutional monarch he could not do much, and that the doubted the present government would. Adelborg's role within the suffrage work was described as important but less public: she took on secretarial tasks, made investigations, structured work and was the author of many of its publications and manifests. She was given Illis Quorum in 1907."

  "text" : "Ira Glenn Goodart (August 5, 1885 – November 8, 1948) was an American railroad conductor, hotel manager, county commissioner and county treasurer. Goodart was raised in Friendsville, Illinois, a small community outside of Mount Carmel, Illinois, in a German Catholic family. After trying a variety of menial jobs Goodart took a position on the New York Central Railroad as a conductor. He held the position with the New York Central until he lost his right leg during a violent train crash in the early 1920s. After a period of joblessness and a period of time as an alcoholic, Goodart found employment as a hotel manager at the Grand Rapids Hotel and during his tenure he increased the hotel's notability. He stayed five years and much of the time the hotel was in severe debt due to unsuccessful events planned by Goodart and flooding. In 1929, Goodart burned down the hotel under suspicious circumstances. Earlier that year the United States Senate Committee on Commerce had decided to remove the dam at Grand Rapids, which attracted many tourists to the hotel. After the hotel fire, Goodart became a politician and was elected to public offices in Wabash County. Goodart served as an elected official for 19 consecutive years in various positions with the county and city of Mt. Carmel. During his political career Goodart was a member of the Democratic Party and served as county treasurer, county commissioner, county assessor and ran multiple times, but was never elected, for constable and sheriff. Goodart died in November 1948, one year after reelection as county finance commissioner."

  "text" : "George Wilford Buckley Byng (1861 – 29 June 1932) was an English conductor, composer, music arranger and musical director of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. He is known for composing music for ballet productions staged at the Alhambra Theatre in London during the Edwardian era, for his theatre compositions and as a conductor for HMV from World War I up to about 1930. As a child, he received a musical education and at age 11 joined the orchestra at the Theatre Royal, Dublin. He played in orchestras throughout Britain for two decades before beginning a conducting career. By the 1890s, his compositions of incidental music for plays were used in London theatres. From 1898 to 1913, as the musical director of London's Alhambra Theatre, he composed, arranged and conducted the music for approximately 30 ballets and scenas. During this period, he continued to compose new music, including theatre scores, for other companies. For two years thereafter, he was the musical conductor at the Gaiety Theatre, London. After conducting for Thomas Edison's British recording studio for several years, in 1915 Byng joined HMV full-time, where he conducted a great number of recordings. From 1917 to 1924, he conducted many of the early acoustic sets of the Gilbert and Sullivan operas in cooperation with the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company. He remained with HMV for at least 15 years."

Following graduation in 1811, he worked under Tenore as a manager of the Orto Botanico di Napoli (botanical garden in Naples). In 1817 he moved to Sicily, where he was appointed director of the botanical garden at Boccadifalco, outside of Palermo. In Sicily, he conducted extensive investigations of the island's flora, publishing two major works as a result, \"Florae Siculae Prodromus\" and \"Florae Siculae Synopsis\". In 1827 he returned to Naples as superintendent of the botanical gardens. In 1861 he was named by Victor Emmanuel as professor emeritus of the University of Naples. Plants with the specific epithet of gussonei are named in his honor, an example being Petagnaea gussonei."

  "text" : "George Singer (1846 – 4 January 1909) was an English cycle manufacturer who was a pioneer of both cycle and automobile development. Singer was born at Stinsford, Dorset in 1847 the son of George and Helen Singer. He served an apprenticeship at Penn's Engineering Works in Greenwich and in 1869 he moved to Coventry to work at the Coventry Machinist Company. Around 1874 he started his own company to manufacture cycles and the Singer Cycle Company soon grew into a large business and in 1896, at the height of popularity for cycles, he floated his business as a company with a capital of £700,000. The development of forks with curves is attributed to him. Singer was elected to the Coventry city council in 1881; he became an alderman in 1893 and also served as Mayor of Coventry from 1891 to 1894. He resigned from the council in 1898 as his interests were more with philanthropy and charity than politics. Singer died on 4 January 1909 aged 62 at his home at Coundon Court near Coventry."

  "text" : "Graham James Dalby (born 2 December 1957 in Chatham, Medway, UK), is a British composer, conductor, band leader and vocalist, now specialising in Jazz Age Swing music from 1911 to 1965. In 1987 he established and led Graham Dalby and the Grahamophones. They have performed worldwide (not USA to date), recreating the sound and the look of the Golden Era of British dance band music. Since 1987 he has led the London Swing Orchestra as they are now known. Graham Dalby was educated at Dover College, UK, and was commissioned in The Royal Hong Kong Police in 1977. He made his professional debut as a singer there as Christus in The Bach St Matthew Passion with the Hong Kong Philharmonic Orchestra in a live broadcast by RTHK on Easter Day 1978. He returned to London in 1980 to study singing and conducting at Trinity College of Music. During this time Dalby formed The Student Singers and Orchestra and gave many large scale choral concerts around London including Mozart Requiem, Beethoven Mass in C and Haydn's Oratorio The Creation with BBC's Brian Kay singing the bass solo. In 1984 Dalby conducted a large scale gala concert at The Royal Albert Hall of works by Elgar, Richard Strauss and Tchaikovsky in aid of World Wildlife Fund. In 1985 Dalby joined two professional music groups. The first, Nexus Opera toured Britten's opera Curlew River including a televised broadcast from Wells Cathedral for the Bath Festival and a BBC Radio 3 broadcast live from The Royal Albert Hall Proms. The second, Martin Best Medieval Ensemble, recorded Cantigas de Santa Maria for Nimbus Records and toured festivals in Britain including Salisbury Cathedral and St Alban's Abbey. That same year he was invited to perform as soloist with Serge Baudot and The Orchestre de Lyons in a broadcast (France Musique) performance of Traite d'orchestration et d'instrumentation for The Berlioz Festival at the Lyons Opera. From 1995 – 2005 Dalby was a member of several professional singing groups and recorded many BBC and film sessions such as Hans Zimmer's Crimson Tide and The Peacemaker, Evita with Madonna and even The Muppet Treasure Island. He recorded more than one hundred and fifty sessions with The Ambrosian Opera Chorus of recordings as varied as Kiss Me Kate for EMI to Semiramide with I Solisti Veneti for Erato Records. In 1985 Dalby formed an early version of what was to become Graham Dalby and The Grahamophones – a Thirties style swing band fronted by an English crooner. The first overseas debut was at The Congreshalle, Berlin supporting Gloria Gaynor and James Last. In 1986 Dalby wrote the theme song and appeared and presented the BBC2 video documentary, I'd Sooner Be a Crooner.(Producer Russell England). 1987 Dalby and his orchestra signed a deal with President Records and released their first album \"We're Tops on Saturday Night\" and were invited to perform at many international arts festivals including Henley Festival, Hong Kong Arts Festival, Molde (Norway) Jazz Festival and City of London Festival. Subsequent recordings with President Records followed: \"Mad Dogs and Englishmen\" in 1988 cat. no. PCOM1097, \"Teddy Bear's Picnic\" (BBC Radio 2 Children in Need single with Gloria Hunniford), \"Let's Do It Again\" 1990 cat. no. PCOM1108 and \"Transatlantique\" 1993 cat. no. PCOM 1128. From these albums Dalby wrote and arranged Sooner Be a Crooner, Hair of the Dog, Vo-Do-De-O Dodo and Thinking of You, all published by Kassner President. The movie, A Handful of Dust, starring Alec Guinness and based on novel by Evelyn Waugh featured a scene with Graham Dalby at The Cafe de Paris playing his composition Sooner Be A Crooner. This was over-written by George Fenton's orchestral score although the visual scene survives. In 1995 Dalby and his Orchestra were commissioned to record a comprehensive series of Ballroom Dance albums at Abbey Road studios . Some fourteen albums (including compilations) were recorded on the Let's Dance series ranging from Foxtrot to Jive and even Spanish Paso Doble. They were distributed by BMG and many are still available worldwide e.g. Let's Dance The Jive cat no.LTD102711. The three album set Dancing Neath The Stars issued in 2005 was released without Dalby's knowledge or approval. In 1994 Dalby wrote and presented What Ho! Wodehouse, a musical biopic, for BBC Radio 2 The Arts Programme during which Dalby interviewed the Heritage Secretary Iain Sproat (author of Wodehouse at War d.2011) and proved, probably for the first time ever on air, that the accusations against the author P.G. Wodehouse on the grounds of collaboration and treason during WWII were spurious and that Wodehouse had no case to answer. This was subsequently toured live around British theatres including The Symphony Hall, Birmingham. In 1998 Dalby wrote and produced The Story of Chartley an elaborate son et lumiere of 2,000 years of history which was narrated by the BBC World Service presenter John Touhey and commissioned by the Sheriff of Staffordshire David Johnson, the script, edited, is now published by the Staffordshire Tourist Board. You're the Cream in My Coffee was used as the evocative and period-convincing theme song for The Mrs Bradley Mysteries in the late 1990s and it was recorded and sung by Graham Dalby and The Grahamophones in a re-creation of Jack Hylton's 1928 version. External Links Mrs. Bradley Mysteries on IMDb (Graham Dalby music consultant / music advisor / ... (5 episodes, 1998–2000) In 1997 Graham Dalby recorded at Abbey Road Studio, The Great Legends of Jazz and Swing for EMI Records and performed the last number by a British Dance Band in British Hong Kong at 11:45 on The Peak on 30 June 1997. It was Mad Dogs and Englishmen. The album was re-issued in 1999 as Swing Classics on EMI. In 2000 Dalby and his orchestra were asked to play for H.M. Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother's 100th Birthday at Windsor Castle and later featured in a BBC documentary The Queen Mum and Me shown on BBC1 during the Laying in of State of The Queen Mother in 2002. In 2004 Dalby formed a large orchestra and chorus renamed The Esterhazy Orchestra for the 500th Anniversary of The Royal Warrant Holders Association in which he programmed and conducted an elaborate performance of five hundred years or Royal patronage through music. In 2006 Dalby recorded (at EMI Olympia Studios) a debut album with the Esterhazy Orchestra for the eleven-year-old soprano Emilia – his daughter – then a chorister at Salisbury Cathedral – for Signum Records. In 2012 Dalby, to mark twenty five years of recording, compiled and re-recorded an Anthology of Swing Music with The London Swing Orchestra of four albums of music from 1920 – 1965 in association with Upbeat Recordings upbeatrecordings.co.uk"

  "text" : "George Heron Milne (3 July 1887 – October 25, 1948) was an American librarian. He worked at the Library of Congress for 39 years and was chief of the Congressional Reading Room from 1937 to 1948. He served as librarian for many years at the Cosmos Club in Washington, D.C. Milne was born in Washington, D.C., to well-known interior decorator Alexander Milne (1847–1927) and Isabella Metcalfe (1854–1922). He married Ella Baldwin Lower of Cleveland, Ohio, in 1917. His bride's brother was a co-author, with Milne and J. Bentley Mulford, of a bibliography entitled The Dramatic Books and Plays Published During 1912-1916 and 1921. Milne worked as a messenger for The Evening Star newspaper from 1902 to 1905 and then was employed by the Philip T. Hall haberdashery firm from 1906 to 1909. He was hired as a messenger by the Library of Congress in November 1909, and served in the general reading room. In 1917, he was transferred to the congressional reading room and became chief there in 1937. As a boy, Milne would trek through the woodlands near Washington, D.C., in search of species of plants not generally known. In later life, it was said that Milne knew the names of all domestic flowers and plants and most wildflowers and could spot them at a glance. Rep. Daniel A. Reed of New York said that Milne, as a child, visited the White House on many occasions with his father and “developed a mutual friendship” with the children of President Theodore Roosevelt. Rep. Brooks Hays of Arkansas said, “The number of Members he personally assisted in the 31 years of his service... must almost equal the number who have served in the Congress during that time. His quiet telephone voice has been known to virtually every member of Congress and certainly to every secretary on Capitol Hill. (From 1917) until one week before his death, George Milne, day and night, year in and year out, served the Congress with a devotion, a vigor and a technical skill which has seldom been equaled.” Late in Milne's career, the Director of Legislative Reference Services (now Congressional Research Service) wrote, \"Mr. Milne is almost ideal as custodian of the congressional reading room. He makes the problems of Members of Congress his own and gives them the kind of superservice that they greatly appreciate ... his spirit and devotion to his work are almost too much and are sometimes carried to the detriment of his health.\" Milne served until a week before he died in Suburban Hospital after a heart attack. Alexander Milne had emigrated from Aberdeen, Scotland, in 1871, and became a recognized authority on old colony furniture. He was in charge of decorating the catafalque on which President William McKinley rested while lying in state in 1901."

Simmons (January 14, 1916 – July 21, 2009) was an outdoorsman and guide who became notable as a master builder of skiffs, the \"vessels used to navigate the Everglades,\" The skill made him a \"Florida Local Legacy\" and the winner of the Florida Folk Heritage Award in 1995. Simmons was born January 14, 1916 in the Florida City, Florida area and raised in nearby Homestead, Simmons \"spent much of his life in the glades, alone or with other gladesmen, hunting alligators, deer and turtles, as well as fishing\"; his family, \"like most poor farmers and settlers in the region, lived 'from hand to mouth' during the depression\" that followed the Florida land boom of the 1920s. Starting at the age of 12, Simmons built pole-powered skiffs used to navigate the Florida Everglades prior to the advent of fanboats; originally made of cypress wood, the craft boats were used for hunting and navigation. Simmons earned a living by \"hunting, fishing, banana farming, and guiding newcomers.\" An interest in writing about his experiences in the Everglades led him to approach Laura Ogden, a professor at Florida International University for help in writing a book: the collaboration led to the 1998 publication of Gladesmen: Gator Hunters, Moonshiners, and Skiffers (ISBN 9780813015736). Simmons' story was the inspiration for the name and the music of the Florida band Nate Augustus and the Gladezmen. Simmons died on July 21, 2009."

He then studied psychoanalysis under Sigmund Freud in Vienna before moving back to Warsaw in 1921 and translating Freud's Introduction to Psychoanalysis into Polish. During his career, he wrote a large number of books on psychoanalysis including Evil in Man: The Anatomy of Hate and Violence and Dictators and Disciples from Caesar to Stalin. The latter looks specifically at Julius Caesar, Oliver Cromwell, Maximilien Robespierre, Adolf Hitler and Joseph Stalin. The psychoanalyst Frank M. Lachmann describes Bychowski as not being a traditional Freudian: \"Here was a Freudian analyst who was clearly more interested in connecting with the patient and finding areas of strength than in demonstrating how clever he could be in eliciting psychopathology\". Lachmann writes that Bychowski eventually adopted similar views to that of Heinz Kohut. Amongst his patients was noted American filmmaker James Toback"

  "text" : "Gavin Smith (born December 10, 1954; disappeared May 1, 2012; declared legally dead May 1, 2014; body recovered October 26, 2014) was an American film studio executive, formerly a regional manager of distribution for 20th Century Fox. Prior to his 18 years in that position he played basketball at UCLA, where he was part of the 1975 team that won that year's NCAA championship, the last for legendary coach John Wooden. He later played at Hawaii, where he set the school's still-standing single-season scoring record of 23.4 points per game. He had a small role as a bartender in Cobb, the 1994 biopic of baseball legend Ty Cobb. On the night of May 1, 2012, Smith left a friend's house in Oak Park, California, where he had been staying due to reported marital difficulties. It does not appear he planned to be away long. When he failed to pick up one of his sons for school the next morning, his family reported him missing. The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department has been investigating. Two years later, with Smith still missing and no evidence of his presence anywhere past the night of his disappearance, he was retroactively declared legally dead. On October 26, 2014, over two years after his disappearance, hikers found the remains of Gavin Smith near Palmdale in the Antelope Valley. In January 2015, John Lenzie Creech, a convicted drug dealer who had begun an eight-year prison sentence on that charge shortly after Smith disappeared, was arrested again and charged with the murder. His wife had reportedly been romantically involved with Smith. Creech's attorney said the death was a \"tragic accident.\""

  "text" : "Giovanni Bellucci (born Rome, August 31, 1965) is an Italian pianist.After having inadvertently discovered the piano, when he was already fourteen, he started studying at the ‘S. Cecilia’ Conservatoire in Rome under the direction of Franco Medori. After having taken his degree summa cum laude and honourable mention, he was awarded a \"Master\" at the Accademia Pianistica in Imola. As a result he could subsequently claim amongst his contacts artists of the stature of Paul Badura-Skoda, Alfred Brendel, Murray Perahia and Maurizio Pollini. His recording of Franz Liszt’s Paraphrases of Verdi and Bellini operas was included in Diapason magazine’s selection of the all-time top 10 Liszt recordings. Apart from Bellucci, the music critic Alain Lompech only took into consideration artists such as Martha Argerich, Claudio Arrau, Aldo Ciccolini, Gyorgy Cziffra, Wilhelm Kempff and Krystian Zimerman. For the British magazine Gramophone, Bellucci is an artist born into the great Italian tradition and brought up to it - a tradition historically represented by Busoni, Zecchi, Michelangeli, Ciani, Pollini. “He takes us back to the golden age of the piano” declared the daily Le Monde in highlighting Bellucci’s success in the World Piano Masters Competition in Montecarlo 1996 – the last in a lengthy series of successes in international competitions (from the ‘Queen Elisabeth’ in Brussels to the ‘Prague Spring’, from the RAI ‘Casella’ to the ‘C. Kahn’ in Paris, from the ‘Busoni’ to the ‘Franz Liszt’). In 2005, he received the award \"Recital of the year\" after his first concert tour in Australia. All his CDs, published by Decca, WARNER CLASSICS, ACCORD-UNIVERSAL, OPUS 106, ASSAI, and DANACORD, have been awarded by specialist publications: “Choc de l’année” by the Classical magazine Répertoire and “Choc” of Le Monde de la Musique in France, UK Gramophone’s “Editor’s choice”, “5 Stars” from Musica, “5 stars” from the BBC Music Magazine, “Cd exceptionnel” from Répertoire, “ffff” from Télérama, “Best Cd” from the magazine Suono, etc. The recording company Universal has published the complete Hungarian Rhapsodies S244 by Franz Liszt (with a double CD including a rare work, such as the Romanian Rhapsody S242) and the CD Chopin Métamorphoses, where Giovanni Bellucci played some works as world premiere, like the Concerto No. 1 by Chopin/Tausig and the Polonaise op. 53 “Heroic” by Chopin/Busoni. The Concerto op 39 for piano and orchestra by Ferruccio Busoni, recorded by the Italian pianist with the orchestra and choir of the Mannheim National Theater, will soon be published."

Arrington polled 25,214 votes (53.7 percent) to Robertson's 21,769 (46.3 percent). Robertson had led a nine-candidate field in the primary election on March 1 with 27,791 (26.7 percent) of the ballots cast, followed by Arrington's 26,980 (26 percent). In third place was Michael Bob Starr, the former commander of Dyess Air Force Base who led handily in Abilene and finished with 22,256 votes (21.4 percent). Laredo surgeon Donald R. May finished fourth in the primary with 9,592 votes (9.2 percent). In the first phase of the campaign, Robertson had questioned Starr’s participation in the LGBT \"Fun Run\" at Dyess Air Force Base.

  "text" : "Gyula Elek (20 February 1932 – 23 May 2012) was a Hungarian handball player, coach and an iconic figure of Ferencvárosi TC. During his 16-year-long playing career between 1949 and 1965, Elek played for Taurus SC, Elektromos SE and Ferencvárosi TC. Shortly after his retirement he was contacted by Ferencváros to take the head coaching position of the women's handball club, which he accepted and began the work in early 1966. He also brought to the club Anna Rothermel, the goalkeeper of the 1965 World champion Hungarian team, to whom he later married. Elek spent 21 years on the bench of Ferencváros with a shorter interruption (1966–85, 1990–92), during which period the team achieved several outstanding results, winning four Hungarian championships and as many Hungarian cup titles. On continental level Ferencváros won the EHF Women's Cup Winners' Cup in 1978 after beating SC Leipzig 18 to 17 in the final. In the following year they reached the final of the tournament again, however, this time they were defeated by TSC Berlin. In 1971 the team played in the final of the European Champions Cup as well, where they were beaten by Spartak Kiev, the dominant team of the era. After quitting the coaching position in 1992, Elek became the director of the Ferencvárosi TC handball department, a position he held until his retirement. Elek and his wife, Anna Rothermel had one son, Gábor, who followed his father's path and became the head coach of Ferencváros in 2008. Gábor also had a number of successes, most notably winning the EHF Cup Winners' Cup in 2011 and 2012. Gyula Elek died after a short hospital treatment on 23 May 2012. He was 80."

  "text" : "Professor Dr. Gustavo Zubieta-Castillo MD (May 20, 1926 – September 17, 2015) was a Bolivian physician, high altitude medicine expert, physiologist, army surgeon, writer, painter, who has been named as the \"Mountain Guru\" at the St. John's Medical College in Bangalore, India. He has worked on high altitude physiology. Being born at 3800m in Oruro, Bolivia, and then studying medicine at the Universidad Mayor de San Andres in the city of La Paz, at 3513 m above sea level, all his work has focused on initially high altitude physiology and later evolved to high altitude pathology. He proposed new concepts and understanding of what was known as Chronic mountain sickness. This pathology characterized by an increase of red blood cells, cyanosis, ventilatory and respiratory alterations with pulmonary hypertension and hypertrophy of the right ventricle seen at high altitude, above the normal values for such altitude, was originally affirmed to be due to \"loss of adaptation\". He changed this interpretation, as he strongly stood for “The organic systems of human beings and all other species tend to adapt to any environmental change and circumstance within an optimal period of time, and never tend towards regression which would inevitably lead to death”. This concept has indeed changed the way high altitude diseases are interpreted. On July 9, 1970, Zubieta-Castillo was the founder of the first high altitude clinic in the world located in La Paz, Bolivia High Altitude Pathology Institute. One of his theories is the proposal that man has the extraordinary capability to adapt to live in the hypoxic environment of the highest point on the planet Earth: the summit of Mt. Everest."

He married Doris Imlach of Liverpool on 20 November 1915, and they made their home at Flowerhill House, Tynagh, County Galway. Their children William and Pamela were born there. However, in 1929 he sold Flowerhill House and 180 acres to John Walsh of Kylebrack. Upon the death of his brother in 1933, Nugent succeeded to all his titles. Most of the estate had been bought out by tenants in 1903, and in 1934 he sold the remainder of the estate, which included Pallas Mansion, built on a twelve-acre site and with some five hundred acres of an estate, by his ancestor in the early 18th century. Pamela (born 1921) served as Section Officer in the Women's Auxiliary Air Force during World War II. She married Brigadier John Ewart Trounce Barbary, on 23 September 1950, and had children Michael (born 1951) and Joanna (born 1955). She was alive as of 2003.

He was returned to the Irish House of Commons for both Carrick and Roscommon Borough in 1783, but chose to sit for the latter. He continued to represent this constituency until 1797 and again between 1798 and 1799. In 1800 his elder brother Henry was elevated to the Peerage of Ireland as Baron Mount Sandford, with a special remainder to his younger brothers William and George. George's nephew Henry succeeded to the barony in 1814 but was killed at a brawl at Windsor on his way to the Ascot races in 1828, when the title devolved on George. As this was an Irish peerage it did not entitle him to a seat in the House of Lords and he was never elected an Irish Representative Peer. Lord Mount Sandford died in September 1846, aged 90, when the barony became extinct."

  "text" : "Gregori Mikhailovich Chmara (Ukrainian: Хмара Григорій Михайлович, Russian: Хмара Григорий Михайлович; 29 July 1878 - 3 February 1970) was a Ukrainian-born stage and film actor whose career spanned six decades. Born in Poltava, Russian Empire (now Ukraine), Chmara began his career in 1910 at the Moscow Art Theater. He made several films in Russia and following the Russian Revolution he went to Germany where he performed as a singer. After meeting the Danish actress Asta Nielsen, the two fell in love and lived together, but never married. In the 1930, he began appearing in Polish and French films, as well as German films. His last film role was in the Stellio Lorenzi-directed French television film adaptation of Fyodor Dostoevsky novel Crime and Punishment (Crime et châtiment), filmed in 1970 and released in 1971.

  "text" : "Douglas George Lee MBE (b 7 November 1945) is a glider pilot who was world gliding champion on three consecutive occasions. He was born in Dublin, Ireland. He joined the Royal Air Force as an engineering apprentice at the age of sixteen in 1962, becoming a British subject. He completed his training as an electrical fitter and in 1967 he was selected for officer and pilot training. He joined an operational squadron in 1971 flying Phantoms. He left the RAF in 1983 as a Squadron Leader and joined Cathay Pacific to fly Boeing 747s. During his apprenticeship he began gliding with the Royal Air Force Gliding & Soaring Association, winning his first British National Championship in 1974 in an ASW17. He was selected for the British Team for the World Gliding Championships at Räyskälä in Finland in 1976 and won the Open Class in an ASW17. He then won the following two World Championships at Châteauroux in France 1978 (also in an ASW17) and at Paderborn in Germany 1981 in a Nimbus-3, becoming the first person to win three successive World Championship titles. He flew in two more World Championships but his home in Hong Kong had reduced his opportunities for gliding and so he was out of practice. He received several awards including the MBE, the Royal Aero Club's Gold Medal, the Britannia Trophy (twice) and the Lilienthal Gliding Medal. In 1978 he took Prince Charles for his first flight in a glider. He bought a farm near Dalby in Queensland in 1996 in anticipation of his retirement in 1999. He established a small airfield there and is now an Australian citizen. With his Schempp-Hirth Nimbus-4DM, he taught advanced pilots for ten years. He and his wife, Maren, are now active in their church and in politics in Queensland. They have two children, Sonja and Brian. He published his autobiography, Hold Fast To Your Dreams, in 2013,which was also published in Polish in 2015 as Uwierz w marzenia."

Born Edward George Wright, Lashwood was known as \"the Beau Brummell of the music halls\". Lashwood was born in Birmingham, England, the son of a local builder. He made his first provincial appearance in 1883 and his London debut at The Middlesex Music Hall in Drury Lane in 1893. He performed at the Plaza Music Hall in New York in 1909. Some of Lashwood's songs became among the earliest hits of the gramophone era and included such numbers as \"Riding on Top of the Car\", \"Send for a Policeman\", \"Goodbye, Dolly Gray\" and \"Oh! Blow The Scenery on the Railway\". He was also noted for singing numerous patriotic songs during World War I, which became popular with troops and the population at home. Lashwood married twice. His first wife was Charlotte Williams. His second wife, Edith Fink, was a music hall chorus girl. He died on 20 January 1942 at Droitwich Spa in Worcestershire, and is buried in the churchyard of St Mary de Wyche, Wychbold, Worcestershire."

  "text" : "Giovanni Battista Valentini, (Cantalicio) ( Cantalice, circa 1450 - Rome, 1515 ), was an Italian humanist, author and Catholic bishop. Cantalcio was Born in Cantalice, but his origins are obscure., It is known that, 1460s, he became a follower of Cardinal Papiense at Pavia. He then became a master of the school, and for over 20 years he taught grammar, poetry, rhetoric and history, in different parts of Tuscany . In his capacity as teacher, he is known to have been in San Gimignano from 1471 to 1476. He was then in Siena (where he wrote Rheatina: pro defensione Senensius ). He was summoned to Florence by Lorenzo de' Medici, to whom he had dedicated a poem in 1472 on the sack of Volterra. The relations between him and the Medici court was encouraged by Cantalicio's friend, the humanist Agnolo Poliziano. Cantalicio later he taught at Rieti, Foligno, Spoleto, Perugia and Viterbo, where he continued to write. From this period date his Summa perutilis in regulas distinctas totius artis grammatices et artis metricae and Epigrammata (in 12 books) published in 1493. Most of his poems are dedicated to the classical Latin authors, among whom Juvenal, Martial, Ovid, Horace and Terence. Others are dedicated to the lords of the courts where he stayed, including Giulio Cesare Varano and Federico da Montefeltro, to whom he dedicated the De pometto gestis et moribus invictissimi Phederici Pheretrani Urbini Ducis. In 1494 he was in Naples, in the retinue of Cardinal Giovanni Borgia, for the investiture of Alfonso II of Naples. His enthusiasm for the dynasty of Aragon made him sing the praises of the Duchess Isabella as well as Bartolomeo d'Alviano, to whom he dedicated a poem to the defense of Bracciano of 1497. Later, he dedicated to Lucrezia Borgia, Lucretiana the Spectacula, a detailed account of the celebrations held in Rome for her marriage to Alfonso I d'Este: it was, according to Benedetto Croce, best published description of that event. Traveling between Rome and Naples, he was able to befriend Gonsalvo of Cordova, Viceroy of Naples, by whose influence he attained from Pope Julius II the Diocese of Atri-Penne, whose bishop he became on 1 December 1503 . Not surprisingly, in 1506, dedicated to Gonsalvo a poem in four books,De bis recepta parthenope Gonsalviae. He attended the first session of the Fifth Lateran Council, before giving up the bishopric in favor of his nephew. (The Diocese of Atri - Penne is today divided between the Archdiocese of Pescara-Penne and the Diocese of Teramo-Atri)."

  "text" : "Guelfi Paul Scassola (19 April 1940 – 27 August 2002) was an Australian politician. He was a Liberal Party of Australia member of the Legislative Assembly of Queensland from 1977 until 1983, representing the electorate of Mount Gravatt. Scassola was born in Innisfail, the son of a cane farmer. He was raised and educated in north Queensland, attending Silkwood State Primary School and Silkwood Convent School, but his father died when he was twelve, and facing hard times, his family relocated to Brisbane. He subsequently attended St Stephen's School, St Patrick's School, Kangaroo Point State Primary School, and Brisbane State High School, before graduating in law from the University of Queensland in 1963. He did his articled clerkship at the firm of senior Liberal Party figure Leo Catt, and thereafter became a solicitor. Scassola was involved in the Liberal Party for many years, serving on the state council of the Young Liberals from 1964 to 1967, the state executive of the party from 1958 to 1968 and from 1969 to 1973, the state policy committee from 1969 to 1977, the party's federal council from 1971 to 1975, and as its Queensland state vice-president from 1963 until 1977. Scassola was elected to the Legislative Assembly at the 1977 election, winning the seat of Mount Gravatt upon the retirement of Liberal MLA Geoff Chinchen. He was particularly concerned with family and disability issues as an MLA, the later stemming from his experience as the father of a son with Down syndrome. He was a member of the \"Ginger Group\" of Liberal MLAs who wished to assert a more distinct voice for the Liberal Party, and were concerned about government accountability and the little weight given by Premier Bjelke-Petersen to Liberal opposition to certain decisions. In 1983, Scassola was one of eight Liberals who crossed the floor to vote with Labor over the creation of a public accounts committee. The vote sparked an angry response from Premier Joh Bjelke-Petersen and Liberal leader Llewellyn Edwards, and Edwards subsequently sacked Terry White, the Minister for Welfare Services and one of the dissenting MLAs, from Cabinet. Scassola subsequently supported White's successful leadership challenge against Edwards. Bjelke-Petersen refused to recognise White as Deputy Premier; the resulting conflict saw White break the decades-old Liberal-National coalition. In the 1983 state election, held a short time later, the Liberal Party was badly defeated, losing several seats to the National Party. Scassola was one of those defeated, losing his seat to National Ian Henderson. Scassola contested Mount Gravatt twice more unsuccessfully: in 1986, when he again lost to Henderson, and in 1989, when he lost to Labor candidate Judy Spence. Scassola returned to his legal practice after his parliamentary defeat. He was heavily involved in public life outside politics, serving as the foundation president of the Down's Syndrome Association, as president of the Brisbane Metropolitan branch of the Lions Club, and serving as patron of and providing free legal assistance to numerous other community organisations. He died in Brisbane in August 2002."

  "text" : "Sir George Barham (22 November 1836 – 16 November 1913) was an English businessman and founder of the Express County Milk Company, later to become Express Dairies. He is sometimes described as the father of the British dairying industry. Barham was born in November 1836 at the Strand, London. Barham first worked with his father in the dairy business and in 1864 he founded the Express County Milk Company. A cattle plague in 1865 threatened the supply of milk in London and Barham transported fresh milk to London by rail to avert the crisis. A separate company supplying utensils for the dairy industry was formed as the Dairy Supply Company Limited which by the start of the 20th century was the largest company of its type in the world. At his own expense Barham helped to introduce modern dairy practices in India and to the West Indies. In 1900 he was appointed a member of the Committee on Milk Standards, he issued a minority report of which most was adopted by the Board of Agriculture. He was called as a witness to a number of commissions on Railway Rates and before the Committee of Food Adulteration. Barham suggested a bill which became the Margarine Act. Barham owned two estates at Wadhurst in Sussex and 1895 he stood for the Unionist party in the 1895 general election at West Islington but was not elected. On 5 July 1904 Barham was knighted. He was Mayor of Hampstead in 1905 and 1906 and from 1908 to 1909 High Sheriff of Middlesex. He married Margaret Rainey and they had two sons, she died in 1906. Barham died aged 76 in November 1913 at his home at Snape, Wadhurst."

In 2006 Spero met nine-year Miles Davis collaborator and Music Director Robert Irving III. This chance meeting helped shape Spero's early career, as Irving soon after adapted Spero as an endeared musical disciple and first-call referral. Irving composed the liner notes for Spero's most recent album, claiming that the \"evolutionary arc [of the project] sets exceptionally high standards.\" In early 2012, Spero was asked to join the Buddy Rich Big Band where each evening on tour, he is showcased in a solo piano performance, recently appearing in London and New York where the band headlined the \"Buddy Rich 25th Memorial Concert\". In January 2013, Spero received the Best Jazz Entertainer award at the Chicago Music Awards. In early 2015, Spero was recruited as the keyboard player and sound designer for pop sensation Halsey. They have completed 3 tours, including opening for Imagine Dragons and two headlining tours. Spero is currently on tour with Halsey opening for the Weeknd in arenas across Canada and the West Coast of the USA."

  "text" : "Gebran Tueni (in Arabic جبران تويني) also written Tueini born to an Greek Orthodox Christian family in Lebanon and who died in Beirut, Lebanon in 1948, was a famous Lebanese journalist and a figure of the Arab Renaissance. Because of his political views, he lived in exile for a while in Paris. Returning to Beirut, he founded the Lebanese newspaper Al Ahrar (in Arabic الاحرار) and in 1933, An Nahar (in Arabic النهار) daily newspaper that became the largest circulation daily in Lebanon. The paper that started on August 4, 1933 as a 4-page tabloid was published by Gebran Tueni as its editor-in-chief and he continued at the head of the influential newspaper until his sudden death in 1948, when editing was taken over by his son Ghassan Tueni, also a prominent journalist, politician, ambassador, and later on Lebanese government minister who continued until 1999. His grandson Gebran Tueni, the son of Ghassan Tueni, who was named after him became the editor-in-chief of An Nahar after Ghassan Tueni's retirement. The grandson Gebran was also a prominent Lebanese journalist who was elected as a Member of Parliament in Lebanon in 2005, and a fierce critic of the Syrian government and its policies in Lebanon and a figure of March 14 Alliance leading to his assassination on 12 December 2005."

In addition to being the Korean War's only Navy ace, he was the only night ace and the only American ace to do so flying a piston engined aircraft, the F4U Corsair. Bordelon, nicknamed \"Lucky Pierre\", was credited with three Lavochkin La-9s or La-11s, and two Yak-18s between 29 June and 16/17 July 1952. Bordelon became an instructor after Korea, and taught survival training to pilots during the Vietnam War. He was also chosen for the prestigious Top Gun award. Guy Bordelon retired as a commander after 27 years in the U.S. Navy, returning to his home town of Ruston, Louisiana. He died in 2002 at the age of 80, and was buried in the family plot in Greenwood Cemetery, in Ruston."

He was a supporter of the prominent theologian Maximus the Confessor, and was, according to the Doctrina Jacobi, responsible for the forced conversion of the African Jews to Christianity, as decreed by the Emperor Heraclius.

He would later marry Sir Thomas's daughter, Cecily, with whom he would have two sons and a daughter. He was educated at Cambridge University and in 1529 he became Member of Parliament for Thetford. In 1532 he was appointed to the bodyguard of Henry VIII and same year he and three of his brothers were pardoned of offences against forestry laws. In 1536 he sat on the Middlesex grand jury which found a true bill against Anne Boleyn. He inherited much of his father's wealth, and enjoyed a comfortable life as a landowner. However a dispute with a tenant led to his eventual downfall, as he was accused and found guilty of treason. He was hanged at Tyburn in 1540. In 1554, during the reign of Queen Mary, part of his lands were repatriated to his eldest son, Thomas, with the help of Sir Ralph Sadler."

  "text" : "George Spencer Payne (25 March 1850 – 17 July 1892) was an English cricketer. Payne's batting and bowling styles are unknown. He was born at East Grinstead, Sussex. Payne made a single first-class appearance for Sussex against Kent in 1869 at the Higher Common Ground, Tunbridge Wells. Kent won the toss and elected to bat first, making 116 all out. In response, Sussex made 152 all out in their first-innings, with Payne being run out during it for a duck. Kent then made an improved 304 all out in their second-innings, during which Payne bowled four wicketless overs, to set Sussex 268 for victory. However, Sussex failed in their chase and were dismissed for just 118, with Payne being dismissed for 4 runs by George Bennett. This was his only major appearance for Sussex. He died at the town of his birth on 25 June 1892. It's likely that given the surname connection he was related to William Payne, Alfred Payne, Charles Payne, Richard Payne, and Joseph Payne. All were first-class cricketers who were born in East Grinstead."

He received the titular church of Santi Nereo e Achilleo on the same day, and received the red hat four days later. He participated in the papal conclave of 1484, where he was the preferred candidate of the Orsini family, though he ultimately lost the election to Giovanni Battista Cibo, who took the name Pope Innocent VIII. On March 9, 1489, he opted for the titular church of San Vitale. He participated in the papal conclave of 1492 that elected Pope Alexander VI. He died of bubonic plague in Rome on October 20, 1493.

  "text" : "G Nammalvar (or Nammazhwar) தமிழில் : நம்மாழ்வார் (1938 – 2013) was an Indian organic farming expert, Green Crusader. Hailing from the agro-based Thanjavur district of Tamil Nadu, he was involved in preaching the farmers to get an edge in organic farming. Nammazhlwar was born in 1938 in Elangadu, Thanjavur District, and he graduated from Annamalai University with a BSc degree in Agriculture. In 1963, he began working for the Agricultural Regional Research Station, a government organisation in Kovilpatti, as a scientist, conducting trials on spacing and manure levels of various chemical fertilisers in cotton and millet crops. During his tenure there, the government had conducted various experiments in rain fed land, using expensive inputs like hybrid seeds, chemical fertilisers and chemical pesticides which Nammazhwar considered futile as the rain fed farmers were resource poor. Based on his experience, he felt very strongly that it was imperative to totally reorient the research work being undertaken. But his peers at the institute paid little attention to his advice. Frustrated, he left the institute in 1969. For the next 10 years, he was an agronomist for Island of Peace, an organisation founded by the Nobel Laureate Dominique Pire. His focus was on improving the standard of living through agricultural development in the Kalakad block of Tirunelveli District, Tamil Nadu. It was at this time that he realised that in order to get optimal results in farming, farmers should rely only minimally on external inputs. All inputs should come from within the farm. So called wastes should be recycled and used as input. This revelation was a turning point in his life. He completely lost trust in conventional farming practices and began experimenting with sustainable agricultural methods. In the late 1970s, Nammazhwar became greatly influenced by Paulo Freire and Vinoba Bhave and their theories on education. The purpose of education should be freedom. Freedom is essentially self-reliance. Self-sufficiency means that one should not depend on others for one’s daily bread. Secondly, one should have developed the power to acquire knowledge for oneself. And last but not the least, a man should be able to rule himself, to control his thoughts and feelings. Eager to propagate these new theories on education, specifically to aid farmers in becoming self-sufficient, he started a Society, Kudumbham in 1979. \"Participatory Development\" was the way forward. There can be no education without action. Nor can there be any action without education. Both go hand in hand. Nammazhwar interacted with local farmers, understood their needs, and based on their input, evolved farming practices suited to the local farmers. In 1987, Nammazhwar attended a 4-week training course conducted by the ETC Foundation, Netherlands, on ecological agriculture. In 1990, he founded a network called LEISA (Low External Input and Sustainable Agriculture) to promote the concepts of ecological farming, specifically the importance of self-reliability and low external inputs. During the same year, he started an ecological research centre for rain-fed cultivation in Pudukottai district. Nammazhwar was also greatly influenced by Mr Bernard de-Clerk of Auroville fame, whom he had worked with since 1984. In 1995 he was nominated as the Tamil Nadu state coordinator for ARISE (Agricultural Renewal in India for Sustainable Environment). Concurrently, Bernard was the coordinator at the national level. During his tenure he travelled widely across India promoting the principles of sustainable agriculture. When the Tsunami hit India on 26 December 2004, Nammazhwar was actively involved in the rehabilitation process. In 2005, he helped farmers across various villages in Nagapattinam district to rehabilitate. In 2006, he left for Indonesia and assisted in reclaiming several farms in Tsunami affected areas. Recognising his extensive work in the field of agriculture, the Gandhi Gram Rural University, Dindugal honoured Nammazhwar with a Doctorate of Science degree in 2007. Nammazhwar travelled widely across the world, observed the agricultural practices in various different ecological systems and based on his findings, trained several farmers and NGO workers. He has written several books and articles in the Tamil language. He had a wide readership across different sections of society. His works may soon be translated to the English language, making his writings easily accessible. Nammazhwar spent a substantial part of his time actively touring the south and conducting training classes on ecological farming. He was in the process of setting up several research cum training centres across South India. The first was at Surumanpatti, Kadavur in Karur district. He was also actively involved in linking different farms and institutes around the world so as to accelerate the process of ecological development. He led the Historic Protest against The Methane Gas project which was Started by Great Eastern Energy Corporation an American multinational. The project was proposed in the Fertile Cauvery Delta region of Tamilnadu which is the Source of Food for almost all the people of Tamilnadu. Thanks to his Efforts and the farmers agitation the project was cancelled. Nammazhwar was the Chief Guest for the practical session conducted on organic farming titled \"iniyellam iyarkai\" (Now all natural) on 20-21 July 2013 by the Ramanathapuram district collector."

  "text" : "Giuseppe Vincenzo Ciaccio (15 October 1824 in Catanzaro – 15 June 1901 in Bologna) was an Italian anatomist and histologist. His name is associated with accessory lacrimal glands known as \"Ciaccio's glands\". In 1845, he earned his degree in medicine and surgery in Naples, afterwards opening a medical practice in Catanzaro, where in 1855 he attained the chair of theoretical surgery and obstetrics at the royal university-school. In 1860 he relocated to Turin, subsequently receiving a scholarship to study and work abroad. In London, he met with Thomas Spencer Wells (1818-1897) and Lionel Smith Beale (1828-1906), who was an important influence to Ciaccio in his decision to dedicate himself to microscopic anatomy. Following his stay in England, he traveled to Berlin, where he attended lectures by Rudolf Virchow (1821-1902) and performed histological studies of Pacinian corpuscles in the laboratory of Wilhelm Kühne (1837-1900). In 1865, he was named professor of microscopic anatomy at the University of Naples, and two years later served as professor of experimental physiology at the University of Parma. From 1870 he was associated with the University of Bologna, working as a professor of comparative anatomy and histology. In the fields of anatomy and histology, he is known for studies involving the finer structure of the eye (microscopic investigations of the conjunctiva, cornea and vitreous). He also made contributions involving research of peripheral nerve fiber terminations in vertebrates (e.g. torpedo fish)."

  "text" : "George Young (1692–1757) was an Edinburgh surgeon, physician, philosopher and empiric. As a young man he was a member of the Rankenian Club, a group of intellectuals who were to go on to become some of the most influential figures of the Scottish Enlightenment. Young's lecture notes (1730–31) give a clear account of contemporary medical and surgical practice and are characterised by the empirical approach to the advancement of medical knowledge, especially in the evolving understanding of nerve and muscle function. His Treatise on Opium (1753) was a practical guide for physicians in the use of the drug which emphasises its complications. It was the longest, most balanced and most comprehensive English language account written yet written. Young's legacy is also apparent in the work of his pupil Robert Whytt (1714–1766) and his surgical apprentice James Hill (1703–1776). Young had taught both the value of repeated observation and a sceptical approach to prevailing dogma. Whytt was to advance knowledge of nerve and muscle function  while Hill went on to make important contributions to the understanding and management of head injury."

  "text" : "George Paice (1854 – 14 March 1925) was a British landscape, canine, hunting, and equestrian painter. Born in Pimlico, London, Paice studied at the Heatherley School of Fine Art and at the Royal Academy from 1905-1910. He worked mostly for private collectors, his paintings almost never present at public exhibitions. Nevertheless, he did exhibit his works at the Royal Academy and at the Royal Society of British Artists, gaining notoriety among the wealthy. He was quickly a much sought-after artist by the English aristocracy, one or two mecenes encouraging his work.Probably for that reason,most of his paintings remained in private collections until two decades ago when some of those works appeared in world known Auction Houses such as Christie's (South Kensington,20/06/91). After his marriage in 1879, he and his wife, Eunice Mary Stuart, moved to Croydon where Paice painted most of his horses and dogs, although he did paint some point-to-point landscapes, these larger than the usually small format animal portraits he was commissioned to paint (among the most known and famous artworks of Paice are \"The Red Lion Inn, Wendlesbury, Nr. Bicester, Oxfordshire\", \"'Jenny' a bay hunter in a landscape\", and \"A saddled bay hunter in a stable with a goat\"). Rarely did he paint people, one of the few exceptions being his own self-portrait. He used various signatures: \"P\" ('A bay horse at a manger in a stable interior',1883), \"GPaice\" - P and G superposed -('Huntsmen and Hounds',1886,Lotherton Hall, Leeds Museums and Galleries), \"G.Paice\"('Swanington',1907), \"George Paice\" ('Two Pugs on a Red Divan',1880). A wealthy artist at the beginning of the 20th century, Paice suffered a great loss of money during World War I due to lack of commissions but continued painting until his death. Strangely enough, George Paice remains absent from many Art Dictionaries, although his paintings travelled overseas, as referred in The National Sporting Library (NSL) Newsletter, Spring 2008: \"Mrs. Dulaney also contributed an oil painting by British artist George Paice (1854–1925), Hunter in a BoxStall with Docked Tail, in which the handsome bay poses alertly in a spacious box stall, eyeing the viewer\"."

He became a world champion in 1971 and set three ratified world records in the total: in 1968, 1971 and 1973. Chetin was born in a small village in the Urals. He took up weightlifting aged 16, when he lost his parents and was sent to an orphanage. In 1964 he moved from Perm to Yalta and then to Shakhty, to train under Rudolf Plyukfelder. The same year he finished third at the Soviet championships, and later returned to Perm. He won the national titles in 1968–69, 1971–72 and 1976. Chetin semi-retired between 1973 and 1976 to recover from alcoholism. In the late 1970s he moved from Perm to a friend in Uzbekistan. There he first worked as a farmer and ferryman, but then started competing in powerlifting and coaching the Uzbekistan weightlifting team. In 1992, aged 49, he won a European title and a bronze medal at the world powerliting championships. He died 10 years later."
