Born in Tecumseh, Ontario, Breault graduated from the University of Western Ontario in 1936 with his medical degree, and practiced medicine in Windsor, Ontario for over 40 years. As Chief of Pediatrics and Director of the Poison Control Centre at Hotel Dieu Hospital beginning in 1957, where he helped develop the child-safety cap. His Ontario Association for the Control of Accidental Poisoning, established in 1962, enabled the 1967 adoption of a cap design known as the \"Palm N Turn\", which was endorsed by the Ontario College of Pharmacy. Incidences of poisoning by accidental medicine ingestion, which had previous been over 1000 per year, dropped by 91 percent. Ontario was the first province to make child-proof lids mandatory for medicine bottles in 1974, and other provinces did the same shortly thereafter. Breault died in 1983. The Hotel Dieu Hospital established a pediatrics centre named after him to recognize his contributions to medicine. He was inducted into the Canadian Medical Hall of Fame in 1997."

  "text" : "Hana Shalabi (Arabic: هناء الشلبي‎‎; born 2 July 1982) is a Palestinian prisoner in Israel, held in administrative detention. On 16 February 2012, the Israeli military arrested Shalabi at her home in Jenin, in the Palestinian administered territories of the West Bank. She is believed to be a supporter of the Palestinian Islamic Jihad, however, her father has denied that she is an active member. The Israeli prison authority said she was taken into custody for unspecified terror activity. To protest against being held without charge, she began her hunger strike. She ended her hunger 43-day hunger strike on 29 March after a deal with Israel in which she is to be deported to the Gaza Strip and stay there for three years. Many protests were held within the Palestinian territories in solidarity with Shalabi, and her arrest was condemned by the Palestinian leadership. Shalabi had also been detained previously in 2009 and released two years later in October, 2011 during the Gilad Shalit prisoner exchange between Israel and Hamas."

  "text" : "Harvey Aronson (born May 1929) is an American journalist and journalism teacher, and a former Newsday editor who also wrote or co-wrote several books. He was part of a group of Newsday reporters involved in writing the bestselling hoax novel Naked Came the Stranger, initially credited to fictional author Penelope Ashe, and published as a parody of commercialized book publishing in general and of novels in the genre of Jacqueline Susann's Valley of the Dolls in particular. Aronson co-edited the project with his colleague, Mike McGrady, who had conceived the idea, and Aronson also wrote a chapter of the book about a character described in a later news article as \"Melvin Corby, a meek real-estate lawyer, unsatisfied in his marriage yet incapable of adultery, the only character in the book thus afflicted.\" In a Life magazine article written after the ruse was revealed, Aronson commented that he thought the book had ended up being more comedic than pornographic, and he opined that Susann \"writes about sex as if she were a virgin\". Aronson later published his own novel, The Golden Shore (1982), about the development of Miami Beach, but the book, which Kirkus Reviews called a \"routine biz-family-saga\", did not go beyond a first edition. Among his other books are The Defense Never Rests (1971), an autobiography of lawyer F. Lee Bailey co-written by Aronson, and a 1973 book about the killing of Mafia figure Joey Gallo. Aronson grew up in New York City, where his father was a sometime professional boxer who fought under the name \"Kid Aron\". Aronson attended Syracuse University. Aronson is married to Irene Virag, who was also a Newsday reporter when they met. Aronson and Virag both became founding members of the faculty of the Stony Brook University School of Journalism when it was established in 2006."

Woodward was born in Norwich, Norfolk, England, the eldest son of geologist Henry Woodward, and died in West Perth, Western Australia. In his Annual General Report of the Government Geologist, 1890 he was the first to note the potential of the Pilbara iron ore reserves: This is essentially an iron ore country. There is enough iron ore to supply the whole world, should the present sources be worked out. The report was ignored and it wasn't till 1961 that Lang Hancock could capitalise on his re-discovery and laws that enabled his profitable exploitation of the iron ore."

Although as a creative artist de Vlieger has written a number of original compositions, he is more noted for his arrangements of works from the classic repertoire for orchestra or instrumental ensembles. These include a number of transcriptions of the works of Richard Wagner; amongst them The Ring: An Orchestral Adventure (1991), Meistersinger: an orchestral tribute (2005) and Parsifal: an orchestral quest (1993). Many of these have been recorded on the Chandos label by the Royal Scottish National Orchestra conducted by Neeme Järvi. De Vlieger's other works include an orchestration of the Vier ernste Gesänge of Johannes Brahms (2012), and an arrangement for percussion orchestra of the Pictures from an Exhibition by Modest Mussorgsky (1981). He has also written a Handbook for the orchestral percussion section (2003). He also carried out the orchestration of the Symphony No. 1 \"The Lord of the Rings\" by Johan de Meij (2000)."

In 1234, the brothers divided Mecklenburg among themselves; Hernry Borwin III received the Lordship of Rostock. Henry Borwin III came into conflict with the emerging Hanseatic cities of Rostock and Wismar. He also waged war on his brothers. After the overthrow of Pribislaw I, Henry Borwin gained control of a part of Parchim-Richenberg. During a war against Pomerania, he conquered Circipania, including the cities of Gnoien and Kalen, in 1236. He assisted Denmark in the war against Holstein.

He was one of the first occupied with social economy. He spoke Walloon with his blue collar workers, which was exceptional in that time. He was a prolific writer (in French) of articles for newspaper and political journals, brochures, and books on political philosophy, and had several of his works translated into German and English. He favoured individualism, free trade, and international peace. He also wrote works about corporations, trade unions, government, democracy, and representation, voicing bold and well-intentioned ideas (which may not be altogether consistent). But his criticism of the principle of limited liability in connection with corporations is an original point which seems to have attracted attention at the turn of the century, as well as his ideas about the organisation of trade unions. He was called upon to address lawyers' and economists' associations and other bodies."

He served in the 27th Foot Regiment and fought for the British in the American Revolutionary War, where he transferred to the 44th Foot soon after arriving. He was soon promoted to major; in January 1778 to lieutenant-colonel; in 1782 to colonel; in 1784 to brigadier-general. He was a lieutenant governor of the Province of Quebec from 1785 to 1788 during the second term of Guy Carleton (Lord Dorchester) as governor. In those days, the \"lieutenant governor\" simply was the deputy of the governor; there is no connection to the modern-day Lieutenant Governor of Quebec. The town of Port Hope, Ontario derives its name from him, as do the township municipality of Hope, Quebec and the municipality of Hope Town, Quebec. Through his brother Charles, he was the uncle of his namesake Henry Hope, a Royal Navy officer. He has a monument in the North Transept of Westminster Abbey, by the sculptor John Bacon. He married Sarah Jones of Mullaghbrack; there were no children. The fact that he predeceased his father gave rise to the case \"Graham against Hope\" in the Court of Session of Scotland, over the question of whether his widow's sister's daughter was entitled to the legacy bequeathed by his father."

  "text" : "Henric Sanielevici (Romanian pronunciation: [ˈhenric saniˈelevit͡ʃʲ], first name also Henri, Henry or Enric, last name also Sanielevich; September 21, 1875 – February 19, 1951) was a Romanian journalist and literary critic, also remembered for his work in anthropology, ethnography, sociology and zoology. Initially a militant socialist from the political-philosophical circle of Constantin Dobrogeanu-Gherea, he incorporated other influences and, in 1905, created his own literary review, Curentul Nou (\"The New Trend\"). Sanielevici and his friend Garabet Ibrăileanu were among the founders of \"Poporanism\", a peasant-oriented and left-wing movement. However, Sanielevici soon detached himself from both Marxism and Agrarianism, criticizing Romanian traditionalist literature, and prophesying a Neoclassicism for the working men. His heated polemic with the rival school of Sămănătorul journal isolated him from the other Poporanists, whom he eventually denounced as \"reactionaries\". More controversy surrounded his ambiguous attitudes during World War I. From 1920, Sanielevici was an isolated figure on the left, editing a new version of Curentul Nou and only affiliating with the popular daily Adevărul. He moved away from literary theory and, following his anthropological speculations, revived Lamarckism and scientific racism to formulate his own racial-sociological system. Himself a Jewish Romanian, Sanielevici attempted to undermine the racial assumptions of Nazi ideologists and local fascists, but his own interpretations of natural history were universally ridiculed. Sanielevici placed human nutrition and mastication at the core of racial distinctions, and went on to stratify artistic temperaments into racial clusters. The author faded into obscurity by the 1940s, when his work was vilified by the governing fascists, then expunged by the communist regime. His tracts were revisited with more sympathy after the 1960s, but reviewers generally describe Sanielevici as an eccentric and discountable contributor to Romanian culture."

  "text" : "Heinrich Krechting (1501 in Schöppingen – 28 June 1580 in Gödens, Ostfriesland) was a leader of the radical Anabaptist movement in Münster. Krechting was the son of the town clerk and organist Engelbert Krechting. He attended grammar school and married Elsle Oedefelt in 1526, daughter of a Schöppinger draper. They had four children. In 1531 he became mayor in Schöppingen. A year later he became a judge and Gograf (Presiding Judge) in the Gogericht (assembly) of greater Munster. In the fall of 1533 he joined Jan van Leiden, who possibly baptized him in January 1534. When Johann von der Wieck was arrested in early 1534, he fled with a large crowd of citizens to Munster, where his brother Bernhard Krechting already was an Anabaptist preacher. Leiden appointed Heinrich as his secretary and later as \"Chancellor of the Kingdom\" - his personal representative. Heinrich Krechting was responsible for organizing the defenders against the siege. As the cathedral fell through treachery after 16 months on 25 June 1535, Heinrich Krechting barricaded himself with a few hundred survivors on the principal market in a wagon fort. They fought fiercely, and it was decided to give the fighters their lives and safe passage if they laid down their arms. Krechting and 24 of his comrades were allowed to leave town with a bishop's permit and 10 gold florins. Krechting fled first to Lingen and tried with the toleration of Count Anton of Oldenburg to rally the Anabaptists again. After the execution of Jan van Batenburg in February 1538, he was leader of the radical Anabaptists. His efforts to choose a new king and win back Munster during the Oldenburg feud in 1538 failed due to the weakness of his movement. When Count Anton of Oldenburg removed the Anabaptists from his country in 1538, Heinrich was able to remain and find shelter in Gödens. Nothing more is known about his work as an Anabaptist after that time. In 1580, he died a respected man. His grandson Heinrich Knechting and his great-grandson Hermann Wachmann were mayors of Bremen."

  "text" : "Henry Clarke (died 22 July 1914) was a British businessman and local politician in London. Clarke carried out business at Gracechurch Street in the City of London as a coal importer and commission merchant. In 1883 he was elected to the Common Council of the City of London as a representative of Bishopsgate Ward, a post he held until his death.  He was chairman of the City's Library Committee in 1887, and in 1897 commissioned and donated a painting by Andrew Carrick Gow to the Guildhall Art Gallery to mark the Diamond Jubilee of Queen Victoria. In the same year he was made a Deputy Lieutenant of the City. When the first London County Council elections were held in January 1889, Clarke was elected as one of four councillors representing the City of London, and was appointed chairman of the Improvements Committee. He held the seat until he retired from the council in March 1904, having the honour of serving as Deputy Chairman of the council in 1902-1903. He was also one of the county council's representatives on the Metropolitan Water Board. Clarke was a resident of Hampstead, in north west London, and following his retirement from the council remained active as a justice of the peace, serving as chairman of the Hampstead magistrates. He died suddenly at his Hampstead home in July 1914, aged 82."

  "text" : "Henry Lilley Smith was born in Southam, Warwickshire, England in 1787 or 1788. He became assistant surgeon to the 45th Regiment and obtained a diploma of MRCS in 1810 and then practised at Southam, where he was appointed parish surgeon. In April 1818 he opened a small hospital for the treatment of diseases of the eye and ear. It was built on land adjoining his house and contained about fourteen beds and was supported by voluntary subscriptions and donations. Smith periodically visited Warwick, Rugby, Banbury, and Northampton to select suitable cases. About 100 in-patients and 250 out-patients were treated annually. In-patients received free professional attendance, medicine and lodging, but had to pay for their food, the charge for which was 10d (old pence) a day for a man, 8d for a woman and 6d for a child. During the first forty years of the 'Eye and Ear Infirmary' 12,220 patients were treated and two-thirds were discharged cured. In 1823, fired by his ambition to improve medical care for the poor, he established a self-supporting dispensary in Southam under the presidency of Sir Grey Skipwith, MP for South Warwickshire, and his committee. The premises consisted of a two-storied thatched cottage, sited close to the Infirmary. Membership was for Southam residents who could not afford to pay doctor's fees. Patients had to be recommended by employers, clergymen of their parish or by two respectable inhabitants. The annual subscription was 3 shillings and 6d for adults and 2s for children. The dispensary was self-supporting but during the cholera epidemic of 1832 each family had to pay an additional 6d a week. The Southam Dispensary was the first of its kind and its success resulted in the establishment of others in Atherstone, Chilvers Coton, Burton-on-Trent, Rugby, Coventry and Northampton. Smith was one of the original members of The British Medical Association and was an adviser to those wishing to follow his example. He also initiated a 'Maypole Holiday' in 1825 which is still held as the 'May Fair' in Southam today (2012) and provided allotments for local boys aged between 8 and 14. Each boy was required to grow some flowers, herbs and at least 6 kinds of vegetable. A small rent was charged and a small library for them was provided. Smith died in 1859 in Southam, where, on Leamington Road, there is a memorial to his life and work close to the site of his dispensary, which was demolished in 1868. The memorial, erected in 1889, is to be found next to his hospital building which is now enlarged and used as a wedding venue called Warwick House."

  "text" : "Henry Behnes, also Burlow, (c. 1800 – August 1837) was an English sculptor. Born in London, Behnes was the son of a Hanoverian pianoforte-maker and his English wife. He was the younger brother of William Behnes, also a sculptor. Both brothers were determined in their choice of a profession by the same circumstance. Henry, being a much inferior artist, was honourably anxious to prevent confusion in the public mind, and took the name of Burlowe. The irregularities of William Behnes are considered to have added a strong incentive to this act of repudiation. Henry exhibited at the Academy in 1831–33. He afterwards went to Rome, and was much employed as a bust modeller. He died of cholera in that city in August 1837. According to an account in the The Art Journal he was a person 'of sterling character and generous impulses, who sacrificed his life in devotion to those of his friends who had been seized with cholera.' Though 'every way superior to his brother as a man,' he was, says the same writer, 'his inferior as an artist' ... 'the difference in the instant apprehension of form and manipulative power in the two brothers was very remarkable. The composition of the one was hard, piecemeal, and disjointed, while the modelling of the other was rapid, certain, soft, and accurate.' Against this critique may be set the remark of Richard Redgrave: 'He was original in his art and of much promise.'"

  "text" : "Countess Henriëtte Adriana Maria Ludovica Flora d'Oultremont de Wégimont (28 February 1792 in Maastricht–26 October 1864 at Rahe Castle in Aachen) was the second, morganatic, wife of the first Dutch king, William I. Henriëtte d'Oultremont was one of five children of Count Ferdinand L.F.M. d'Oultremont de Wégimont of the House of d'Oultremont in Liège and his wife Johanna Susanna Hartsinck, daughter of Admiral Andries Hartsinck. Around 1840, King William found himself in discord with much of the Dutch population due to his refusal to implement demanded reforms. This discord was enhanced when the king, head of the strictly Protestant and royal House of Orange-Nassau, announced his intention to marry the Catholic Countess Henriëtte, who had been a lady-in-waiting to his first wife, the late Queen consort Wilhelmine (1774-1837). The resistance was so great—Henriëtte was Catholic and a native of Belgium, which had seceded from the Netherlands—that William decided to abdicate in favour of his son William II on 7 October 1840. After abdication, he styled himself King William Frederick , Count of Nassau. He married Henriëtte on 17 February 1841; he was 71 years old at the time, she was 47, and the couple would have no children. She had received the Dutch title, Countess of Nassau on 7 February 1841, by which she was known during the couple's subsequent retirement in Berlin. William I died two years later, in 1843. Because of her devoted care for her elderly husband, the Dutch royal family awarded her an allowance and a castle near Aachen, where she died in 1864. Henriëtte was not buried below the New Church in Delft with the Dutch kings and their queens; she was instead buried in the family vault in the chapel in the park surrounding Wégimont castle in Soumagne, near Liège in Belgium. In the Netherlands, she was nicknamed Jetje Dondermond (\"Henriëtta Thundermouth\")."

  "text" : "Hermione Wiltshire (born 17 April 1963 in London) is an English sculptor and photographer. Wiltshire studied at the Central Saint Martins College of Art and Design and the Chelsea School of Art, completing her education in 1987. In 1992, she was artist in residence at the Tate Liverpool. She was formerly senior lecturer in photography at the Royal College of Art (2008) and acting head of the photography programme (2011–12), and is currently a senior tutor there. Wiltshire's work treats the photograph as a sculptural object and approaches issues in sexuality, including pornography, the male gaze, and women's self-image, from a feminist perspective."

  "text" : "Henry Ellis Warren (May 21, 1872 – September 21, 1957) was an American inventor credited with invention of the first synchronous electric clock which kept time from the oscillations of the power grid in 1918 as well as with 134 other inventions.Warren founded Warren Telechron Company in 1912 which later was acquired by General Electric in 1943.Warren was noted as \"the father of the electric time\".Just between 1916 and 1926 the company sold 20 million clocks. The clocks remained popular into the 1950s.In 1940 he also invented the \"singing clock\" which instead of a pendulum had a vibrating metal string."

  "text" : "Hans G. Conrad grew up in modest circumstances and graduated from the so-called Werkschule of Brown, Boveri & Cie. in Baden, Switzerland. In the late 1940s he met the artist, architect, designer and publicist Max Bill in Zurich, Switzerland. Conrad worked for Bill, who, at that time, had been commissioned to design the Swiss Pavilion for the Milan Triennale in 1951. At that time, Conrad was also working for the Swiss architect and designer Alfred Roth (not to be confused with the German politician). Later, between 1952 and 1954, Conrad designed promotional advertising for the German-American furniture manufacturer Knoll International belonging to Florence Knoll and Hans Knoll. By way of Max Bill, who was one of the co-founders of the Ulm School of Design (Hochschule für Gestaltung, HfG) alongside Otl Aicher and Inge Scholl, Conrad relocated to Ulm during the HfG's founding period, most likely on 1 December 1952. He was the first student at the HfG: his student ID was valid from 1 January 1953, although classes did not officially start until 3 August 1953. At first he studied product design and then visual communication. Conrad met his first wife, Eva-Maria Koch, who was also a student at the HfG, in Ulm. Otl Aicher and Conrad developed an exhibition system for the electrical appliance manufacturer Max Braun (company) that was used for the first time at the Deutsche Rundfunk- Phono- und Fernsehen Ausstellung (German Broadcasting, Phonograph and Television Exhibition) in Düsseldorf in 1955. In 1956, the combined phonograph-radio device Phonosuper Braun SK 4, later known as the Schneewittchensarg (Snow White's Casket), which is one of the most influential design developments of the 20th century (design: Hans Gugelot, Dieter Rams and Otl Aicher), was introduced in this design setting. He designed an exhibition bus for Braun as a final project, which was, however, never realized. Conrad worked as the head of trade fair and exhibition design at Braun from 1958 until 1962. Thereafter, he took over as head of worldwide advertising for Lufthansa. He engaged Otl Aicher and his design group E5 of the HfG in Ulm to develop a visual corporate design concept for Lufthansa. Otl Aicher's concept from 1962 is seen today as a milestone for the development of rationally derived corporate design concepts and is, in its most substantial and essential elements, still utilized today. Hans G. Conrad was a member of the committee for visual design of the Olympic Games in Munich between 1969 and 1972. (Chairman: Anton Stankowski). Otl Aicher led the department XI (visual design). Conrad became a member of the editorial staff of the business magazine \"Capital\" in 1970 (position comparable to today's Creative Director). Adolf Theobald was the publisher of the magazine and Ferdinand Simoneit its editor in chief until 1974 at which time Johannes Gross took over the position. The magazine developed into one of the most influential and predominant in Germany's media under his leadership. In 1989 Conrad left \"Capital\". In October 1992 he suffered a stroke. He died on 26 December 2003 in a nursing home in Cologne-Rodenkirchen."

  "text" : "Herbert S. Lewis (born May 8, 1934) is Professor Emeritus of Anthropology at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, where he taught from 1963 to 1998. He has conducted extensive field research. In Ethiopia, Lewis studied both the history of the Oromo (Galla) Kingdom of Jimma Abba Jifar and the lives of contemporary Oromos from 1958–60 and in 1965–66. (Many of his ethnographic photographs are visible in the University of Wisconsin's Digital Library. See the link to Africa Focus below). His work in Ethiopia was concerned above all with political leadership and community organization as well as ethnohistory and culture history. The book, originally titled A Galla Monarchy: Jimma Abba Jifar, Ethiopia, 1830-1932, is a study of the nature of the monarchy, the sources of the ruler's power, as well as its origins. The study in 1965-66 centered on community life and the leadership of spirit mediums, k'allu, who effectively organized religious life and conflict resolution, and provided a degree of political leadership for rural districts. In the 1970s and 1980s, Lewis studied ethnicity, class, and culture change in Israel, focusing on those Jews who immigrated from Yemen and Morocco. The major publication resulting from this work was After the Eagles Landed: The Yemenites of Israel. Contrary to the stereotype of the Yemenites as downtrodden and rather poor \"Oriental\" Jews (mizrachim in current usage) Lewis's evidence showed them to be confident, increasingly successful in status (occupation, education, political presence), as well as maintaining and developing aspects of their music, dance, arts, and persistent in the orthodox Jewish religious belief and practices they brought with them from Yemen. His 2005 publication, Oneida Lives (see below), presents a large selection of personal accounts by Oneidas of Wisconsin that offer wide-ranging perspectives on the lives of men and women of various ages between 1885 and the beginning of World War II. (These accounts were collected by the Oneidas themselves through a WPA grant to the University of Wisconsin anthropology department. Morris Swadesh initiated the WPA project in 1937 and it was initially overseen by Floyd Lounsbury.) His book In Defense of Anthropology: An Investigation of the Critique of Anthropology presents a series of chapters that make a sustained argument for the value (and honor) of modern (as in “prior to postmodern”) American and British anthropology. The work traces the major transformation undergone by American anthropology as a result of the cataclysmic events of the 1960s—the war in Vietnam, the civil rights movement, the increasing rise of the women's and other identity movements, and the increasingly visible anti-colonial movements. The discipline of anthropology became the object of numerous critiques; \"the critique of anthropology's complicity in projects of power is itself the main political act\" (Sherry Ortner 1999). This work responds critically to these critiques, offering evidence to counter the widespread notion of anthropology as the handmaiden of colonialism, and of its liability for exoticizing and otherwise misrepresenting what post-1960s writers call \"the Other.\" Lewis' major research interests include: anthropological theory and history, cultural and social change, ethnicity, and political anthropology. Although initiated into anthropology by Marxian, materialist, neo-evolutionists at Brandeis and Columbia he soon became more of a Weberian-Boasian (see Lewis 2001b on Boas, Darwin, pragmatism, etc.). His conversion was mediated and facilitated by fieldwork in political anthropology in Africa, a concern for ethnicity before this was a common and acceptable subject, the teaching of Conrad Arensberg, the early writings of Fredrik Barth, Max Weber on forms of political action. These led to a concern with individual action in the context of culture. (Call it structure and agency before its time.) Many of Lewis' published papers and book reviews are available at academia.edu"

  "text" : "Harold William Burton (October 23, 1887 – October 2, 1969) was an early 20th-century architect with architectural works throughout the western United States and Canada. Burton was one of the most prolific architects of chapels, meetinghouses, tabernacles and temples for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). In 1910 he opened an architectural firm with Hyrum Pope (Pope and Burton) in Salt Lake City, Utah. They were particularly fond of Frank Lloyd Wright and the Prairie School architectural style. As young architects, Pope & Burton won design competitions for two of their better-known works, the Cardston Alberta and Laie Hawaii temples of the LDS Church. Burton moved to Los Angeles, California in 1927 to set up another office in the firm with Pope. After Pope unexpectedly died in 1939, Burton established a new firm with his son Douglas W. Burton. Together they continued to design many buildings, including some for the church. In 1955, Harold became the chief supervising architect for the LDS Church. One of his final works was the Oakland California Temple. Aside from places of worship, Burton also designed civic buildings and homes. Many of his works exist today, some of which are listed on the National Register of Historic Places."

He was his father's successor as lord of Monmouth and held the lordship until about 1170/1176. In 1101, when William presented the newly completed St Mary's Priory Church and its attached Priory to the parent Abbey of Saint-Florent de Saumur, along with the revenues of several local churches, the donation was formally confirmed by Hawise, Iveta and Advenia. On 18 March 1101 or 1102 the Priory Church was consecrated by Hervey le Breton, bishop of Bangor, in the presence of abbot William of Saint-Florent de Saumur and of Bernard, King Henry I's chaplain. On this occasion Hawise and her two daughters made crosses that were used in the ceremonial."

  "text" : "Hannah Jensen Kempfer (December 22, 1880 – September 27, 1943) was a Minnesota schoolteacher, farmer and politician. She was a member of the Minnesota House of Representatives from 1923 to 1930 and from 1933 to 1942, representing District 50 and Otter Tail County. Kempfer was one of the four women first elected to the Minnesota legislature in 1922 after women's suffrage. Born on a ship in the North Sea, Kempfer was adopted by a Norwegian family that immigrated to the United States in 1885. Her family settled in Minnesota and squatted a piece of railroad land where she grew up in poverty. She became a teacher at a small rural schoolhouse. As a legislator, she championed the rights of children and fought for the conservation of natural resources. She introduced legislation to protect the Showy Lady's slipper, Minnesota's state flower."

He was one of the leaders of the protest against the taxation policies of the Lord Deputy of Ireland, Sir Henry Sidney, in the late 1570s, and as a member of the Irish House of Commons in the 1580s he successfully opposed Sidney's successor, Sir John Perrot. In the early 1600s he was one of the leaders of the protest against strict enforcement of the Penal Laws. His professional reputation was gravely damaged in his last years when he was convicted and fined for having altered a deed concerning the Earl of Kildare's will. He was the grandfather of the playwright Henry Burnell."

  "text" : "Howard Tall Fox, Jr. (September 4, 1920 – June 28, 2011) was an American Major League Baseball front office executive. He was a member of the Minnesota Twins organization for more than 60 years, and served as president of the club in 1985 and 1986, following its sale by longtime owner Calvin Griffith to Carl Pohlad. A native of Emporia, Virginia, Fox attended Virginia Polytechnic Institute and served in the United States Army during World War II, rising to the rank of captain. Fox joined what would become the Twins in the late 1940s, when the team was still known as the Washington Senators, as business manager of their Emporia Nationals farm system affiliate in the Class D Virginia League. He then moved to the parent team in Washington as publicity director and traveling secretary, and accompanied the Senators to Minneapolis–St. Paul when the franchise relocated after the 1960 season. Fox was promoted to executive vice president of the Twins in the 1970s, and, after his term as club president, he became chairman of the Twins' executive committee, serving into 2011, the year of his death. During his tenure, the Twins won three American League pennants and the 1987 and 1991 World Series. He died at age 90 in Orlando, Florida, which served as the spring training home of the Senators and Twins during the Griffith era."

  "text" : "Henry A. Hargreaves, Ph.D. (born 1928) is a prolific Canadian science fiction writer. Originialy from Bronx, N.Y., Hargreaves has spent a life establishing himself as a pioneer of Canadian short fiction, among a higher pursuit of academics, with a distinguished career of tenure spanning three decades, and retiring a professor emeritus of English Literature at the University of Alberta. His short fiction was collected in one of Canadian science fiction's earliest anthologies: North By 2000, published in 1975 and was re-issued as North by 2000+ in 2012 with additional material, with such short stories as \"Fore\" - Eight - Sixteen, In His Moccasins, Infinite Variation, and 2020 Vision. With a return to his roots, Hargreaves released an introspective memoir Growing Up Bronx: A Memoir of my Shapers and Shakers in 2012. Met with favorable reviews, his foray into non-fiction was a fine complement to an already substantial body of work. In 2015, Dr. Hargreaves was honored with a prestigious induction into the Canadian Science Fiction & Fantasy Association Hall of Fame, whilst living in retirement in the solitude of Claresholm, Alberta, with his wife."

  "text" : "Hussain Sadiqi (Persian: حسین صادقی‎‎) is an Afghan Australian actor and martial artist. He won an award for the best fight scene for the Australian made action movie Among Dead Men at International Film Festival in Pasadena, California. An athlete in Afghanistan, Sadiqi left as the Taliban arrived and landed in Australia as a refuge in 1999 at Port Hedland Detention Centre. Martial Arts expert Hussain Sadiqi was born in the central highlands of Afghanistan Oruzgan Province. He began his Martial Arts training when he was only 9 years old. He attained the top ranking Martial Arts position in Afghanistan at a young age and become the National Champion at the age of 16. At 18 he became the captain of Afghanistan National Team. In 1999 unfortunately he had to flee Afghanistan because of several years of war and becoming a Taliban target due to his high profile. His new journey began in 1999 when he left Afghanistan in search of a new homeland. His family paid 5000USD to a smuggler to get Hussain out of Afghanistan to safety. His journey from central Afghanistan to Pakistan, then moving to Indonesia and finally boarding a fishing boat along with 147 other asylums saw him take three months to reach Australia. Soon after arriving in Australia he was sent to a Detention Center for six months until he was released on a temporary protection visa. After being released he was selected to compete in Taekwondo for the Afghan team at the 2000 Sydney Olympic Games and carry his country flag at the Opening Ceremony. A couple of days before the Games started the International Olympic Committee banned the Afghan team because the Taliban which controlled Afghanistan at the time would not let women compete. Hussain gained many fans with his Martial arts based documentary “The Art of Fighting” directed by Gavaine Broune.

  "text" : "Hans Bohrdt was born on 11 February 1857 into a comfortably well-off middle-class family. He lived and worked in Berlin, Germany. His love for the sea began when he was 15 when he visited the port of Hamburg. Bohrdt was a self-taught painter who would later go on to give private lessons to Kaiser Wilhelm II. German Kaiser Wilhelm II took a liking to Bohrdt and would fund all of his projects. In 1915 Bohrdt created his most famous illustration which is called \"The Last Man\". The image shows a German navy officer holding up a German flag as his ship sinks because he would rather go down with the ship than surrender. \"The Last Man\" would become one of the most widely recognized propaganda images used during the war to inspire courage. Bohrdt was accepted into the Imperial Yacht Club in Kiel. In 1906 the emperor even grants Bohrdt a spacious villa in Berlin. After World War I Germany was completely destroyed. Bohrdt now made a living creating maritime postcards, book illustrations, magazines, and supplied images for newspaper articles."

  "text" : "Harold Francis Greeney III is an American biologist best known for establishing the Yanayacu Biological Research Station and Center for Creative Studies on the eastern slopes of Antisana volcano in Ecuador. He received his PhD from the Department of Behavioural Ecology, University of Wroclaw, Wroclaw, Poland in 2008, his MSc from Department of Entomology at the University of Arizona in 1999, and his BSc at Wake Forest University in 1993. He is an author on over 225 peer-reviewed biological research articles concerning the ecology, behavior, and evolution of invertebrate and vertebrate species. Greeney's work on the reproductive biology of neotropical birds resulted in a Pamela and Alexander F. Skutch Research Award by the Association of Field Ornithologists in 2005. Although he has published information on the nesting behavior of more than 500 species of birds, Greeney is well known for his interest in antpittas. His passion and skill for finding bird nests, especially of rare or difficult to find species, have led to Greeney's participation in several nature documentaries such as Hummingbirds: Magic in the Air, An Original DUCKumentary, and Hummingbirds: Jewelled Messengers, as either a scientific consultant or in an on-air role. Along with a group of North American collaborators, Greeney has maintained an active NSF-funded research program entitled Collaborative Research: Caterpillars and Parasitoids in the Andes of Eastern Ecuador since 2004. Greeney is married and has two children."

After Richard became king in 1189, Neville continued in his service and he accompanied him on the Third Crusade. Neville remained in the royal service following Richard's death in 1199 and the accession of King John to the throne, becoming one of the new king's favourites and often gambling with him. He was named in Magna Carta as one of John's principal advisors, considered by a medieval chronicler to be one of King John's \"evil councillors\". He deserted John after the French invasion of England in 1216, but returned to pledge his loyalty to John's son Henry III after the latter's accession to the throne later that year. Neville's royal service continued until his death in 1234, though by then he was a less significant figure than he had been at the height of his powers."

  "text" : "Harry Bidwell Ansted (1893-1955) was a United States Army officer, pastor and educator, and the first president of Seoul National University. Born on December 17, 1893, in Temperance, Michigan, Ansted attended Hillsdale College and majored in Business at Greenville College.

In 1944, near the end of the World War II, Ansted enrolled in the US Army as an Army chaplain. After his service in Leyte, Philippines, he was transferred to Korea, a southern part of which was under US Military rule at the time. It was here, in 1946, that he became the first president of Seoul National University, a new national university established in place of Keijō Imperial University. He also created the official motto of the school, Veritas Lux Mea, which is still used to this day. Ansted was succeeded by Lee Choon-ho on October 24, 1947. Ansted died on December 16, 1955 in Seattle, Washington, and was buried in Evergreen Washelli Memorial Park."

  "text" : "Henry Excelsior Wiggins (13 May 1906—18 March 1993) was a notable minister, third principal and an integral part of the formation of the Assemblies of God churches in Australia. He was born in Oxford, Oxfordshire, England where he was raised by his mother Annie Claire Wiggins and his father Ernest Wiggins until he left home in his early twenties. He attended Oxford university studying law, but never finished as he decided to become a minister instead. He originally was in conservative church circles but when his mother became involved in the pentecostal movement around the lakes district area of England, Henry started to look into what this movement was about. Though originally wary of this movement, after attending meetings of Smith Wigglesworth he became convinced that the pentecostal movement was his calling from god. He traveled around England and attended many revivalist meetings where he eventually met his future wife who was at the time Laura Anne Markham. Shortly after their marriage they moved to Nambour, Queensland, Australia to expand the Assemblies of God churches overseas. He pastored a church in Nambour and along with his wife taught at the Assemblies of God bible college. He became an editor of a pentecostal magazine and published many articles on theological views and eventually became the principal of the college. After pastoring churches in both England and Australia, ministering as the principal of the assemblies of God churches in Australia, he died after suffering from Alzheimer's disease."

  "text" : "Henry Lafont (born 10 August 1920 in Cahors; died 2 December 2011) was a French aviator. He was the last surviving French veteran of the Battle of Britain. Lafont was born in Cahors, France on 10 August 1920. Attracted by flying, he obtained his pilot's licence and in November 1938 entered the Armée de l'Air flying school at Istres. When the Armistice was signed on 22 June 1940, Lafont was just finishing a course at the Fighter School at La Sénia airfield near Oran, Algeria. He refused to accept the Armistice with Germany. With five other servicemen, including René Mouchotte and Charles Guérin, he escaped from Oran to join the Forces Aériennes Françaises Libres. They escaped by flying a twin-engine Caudron Goéland transport aircraft, surviving a takeoff with sabotaged propellors locked in coarse pitch, to Gibraltar, navigating with the aid of a school atlas. The group joined the Forces Aériennes Françaises Libres in June 1940. They arrived in Britain in mid-July. Lafont was one of eleven French pilots posted to RAF St. Athan in late July. He moved to No. 1 School of Army Co-operation at Old Sarum on 29 July and then went to Odiham on 10 August where he flew 15 hours on Tiger Moths and Hectors.He was posted to 6 OTU, Sutton Bridge on the 19 August, converting to Hurricanes and joined No. 245 Squadron at Aldergrove on 11 September. On 18 September, Lafont was attached to No. 615 Squadron RAF at Prestwick and moved south with 615 to Northolt on 9 October, participating in the latter stages of the Battle of Britain flying Hurricanes. He claimed Bf.109s 'probably destroyed' on 26 February 1941 and on 15 March. In May 1941, he was posted to 59 OTU as an instructor for French pilots coming from 10 FTS at Ternhill. There Lafont trained more than 60 French pilots. He later joined the Groupe de Chasse n°1 \"Alsace\" (later incorporated into No. 341 Squadron RAF), which was formed in the Middle East and took part convoy patrols during the campaign in Libya. Wounded on 27 June 1942, he returned to action in January 1943, flying fighter operations over the Western Front. He finished the war flying a Spitfire Mk. IX, and had completed 230 operational missions. He also won the Croix de Guerre with three palms and the Cross for Military Valour. He left the air force in 1966 with the rank of colonel. From 1967 to 1984, Lafont was director of the Paris Air Show at Le Bourget. Lafont was made a Companion of the Ordre de la Libération."

  "text" : "Henrique de Araújo de Sommer (Lisbon, 29 January 1886 — Cascais, 28 March 1944) was one of Portugal's most important industrialists. He was a member of a German aristocratic family living in Portugal, since his grandfather Heinrich Baron von Sommer joined the armies of D. Pedro IV of Portugal, married a Portuguese lady and started a company - Casa Sommer & Cia. dedicated to importing iron. Henrique de Sommer, after commercial studies in England, was called at the age of 26 to manage his family businesses. He started the production of Portland cement at the Maceira Liz factory in 1923, being still remembered for his social work, and the out of ordinary working conditions for the factory workers. With the acquisition of the Companhia de Cimentos Tejo in 1935 he became Portugal's main cement producer. He experimented with the Basset method of iron ingot, but met with little success, having set along with a project of expansion of his cement production to Mozambique the path that would later be followed by his nephew António Champalimaud. He had no children, and the division of his inheritance among his nephews and niece was sadly known as the Sommer Inheritance Case, the longest lawsuit in Portuguese history."

At the end of the 1960s, 't Mannetje founded the restoration workshop Restauratieatelier Uilenburg in Amsterdam. The goal was to restore and produce sculpted parts for monumental buildings. In the 20 years of its existence, the atelier formed itself into a school for sculptors and specialists. 't Mannetje also sculpted modern gable stones, dozens of these stones are to be found in the city center of Amsterdam. He also sculpted several free standing statues, amongst them are the winged marble sphinxes at the entrance of the Wertheimpark and the pilar bearing turtle, made out of marble and hardstone, at the Sint Antoniesluis. Nowadays he has his atelier in Gorssel, Gelderland."

His work is seen as part of the Dutch/Belgian literary movement known as 'De Vijftigers', a group of young poets started in the late 40s and connected to the COBRA movement, which also included Lucebert and Hugo Claus. Besides poetry, Andreus also wrote a large number of children's books, the best known series of which revolves around the character 'Meester Pompelmoes'. Andreus stories for children are full of fantastical themes, playful, and written in a lyrical, rhythmical style. He received a number of prizes for his children's books, including a 'Zilveren Griffel' prize for his poetry book 'De Rommeltuin' and his book 'Meester Pompelmoes en de mompelpoes' won the CNPB Children's Book of the Year award in 1969 (a predecessor of the Gouden Griffel). He also wrote a number of radio dramas, chansons, TV scripts and commercials, novels, and a novella."

  "text" : "Hippolito Salviani (1514–1572) was an Italian physician, scholar and naturalist, noted for his Renaissance book Aquatilium animalium historiae, depicting hundreds of Mediterranean fish, some from Illyria, and a few mollusks. He also wrote works on medicine, such as that dealing with Galen's theory of crises, and a topical play.  Salviani taught at the University of Rome until 1568, after which he was chief physician to the House of Farnese and three successive popes, Pope Julius III, Pope Marcellus II and Pope Paul IV. Salviani was born in Città di Castello. He studied medicine in Rome, developing a great interest in ichthyology and in natural history generally. He enjoyed the financial support of Cardinal Cervini (later Pope Marcellus II), enabling him to explore the Mediterranean coastline. Cervini's death caused Salviani to dedicate the work to Pope Paul IV. Aristotle's work on fish species is one of the earliest known. In the 1500s fish enjoyed a renewed interest in both France and Italy. 1551 saw the appearance of Pierre Belon’s Histoire naturelle des estranges poissons marins, illustrated by woodcuts. In 1554 Guillaume Rondelet’s De piscibus marinis was published, also using woodcuts. Salviani’s work was published in parts over a period of three years. Its use of copper engraving was well-suited to depicting fish, and greatly superior to woodcuts with its lifelike rendition of eyes and scales. The copper engravings have a scientific appearance, but some details, like the correct number and position of the scales were omitted. Nicolas Béatrizet probably designed the title-page and the fish illustrations were made by Antoine Lafréry. Another theory is that they were drawn by the Italian painter Bernardus Aretinus and engraved by Nicolas Béatrizet. Salviani's Aquatilium animalium only deals with animals personally observed and handled by him. He collected most of the fishes for his studies from the market in Rome. Salviani died in Rome, aged about 58."

  "text" : "Count Hermann-Karl von Keyserling (1697–1764) was a Russian diplomat from the Keyserlingk family of Baltic German nobility based in the Duchy of Courland and Semigallia. In 1733, the nobility of Courland sent Keyserling to Saint Petersburg in order to inform Ernst Johann von Biron that he had been elected Duke of Courland. Biron was so pleased with the news that he had Keyserlingk appointed President of the Saint Petersburg Academy of Sciences. A year later, Keyserling was appointed Ambassador of the Russian Empire at the court of August III in Dresden and Warsaw. He kept this position until his death. As the Russian ambassador to the imperial court in Vienna he was made an imperial count in 1744. Johann Sebastian Bach, a noted composer, is thought to have composed the Goldberg Variations for Count Keyserling as a sleep aid. The work takes its name from Johann Gottlieb Goldberg, a musician in the service of Count Keyserling. His son Heinrich Christian von Keyserling was the wealthiest aristocrat of Königsberg whose palace was frequented by the likes of Immanuel Kant and Johann Gottfried Herder. His marriage to Caroline von Keyserling was childless. Herman Karl's daughter Anna von Medem was the great grandmother of geologist Alexander Keyserling."

He dealt with the analysis of patterns of interaction and communication in groups, and also interferences in communication. He examined the personality characteristics of leaders. He distinguished three types of managers: 1.  \n*  The visionary and charismatic leader is characterized by being original, witty, and uncompromising. He is often eccentric and seeks to break with status quo, and embarking on a new path. Historical examples of such leaders were Gandhi, Hitler, Gladstone and the Ayatollah Khomeini. 2.  \n*  The rational and analyzing leader' are holding to the facts supported by numbers. He is systematic and can effectively control. Examples of this type are Clement Attlee, Robert Peel, or Jimmy Carter. 3.  \n*  The pragmatist – The contractor of established plans, skillfully solving problems. Leaders of this type are typically not visionary. They seek to subjugate the people to their will. Historical examples: Bismarck, Lenin, Stalin, Lyndon B. Johnson."

His wide musical expertise includes music notably in Africa, Oceania and Switzerland. He also had particular interest in yodeling and lullabies. His recordings of lullabies from Solomon Islands was later released by UNESCO as part of their Musical Sources collection. One famous lullaby he recorded, a traditional Baegu lullaby from the Solomon Islands called \"Rorogwela\" was sung by Afunakwa, a Northern Malaita old woman. The recording was later used, apparently without permission, in Deep Forest's song \"Sweet Lullaby\". Prof. Zemp studied musicology and anthropology at the University of Basle graduating in 1961. He also finished a diploma in percussion at the City of Basel Music Academy (Basel's Conservatory school) in 1960. He attended École pratique des hautes études for his doctorate. He joined French National Centre for Scientific Research (CNRS) becoming a director of research. He taught ethnomusicology at the University of Paris X-Nanterre. In 1982, he became editor the recording series (Collection du Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique et du Musée de l'Homme on the Le Chant du Monde record label.

For over 10 years, Dunn contributed to the UDA's magazine Ulster and helped construct the Common Sense: Northern Ireland - An Agreed Process document which was a treatise on power-sharing between loyalists and nationalists, largely composed by South Belfast brigadier John McMichael and UDA commander Andy Tyrie. She left the UDA following the death of McMichael in December 1987 and the resignation of Tyrie four months later. McMichael was killed when a booby-trap bomb planted by the Provisional IRA exploded under his car. Tyrie resigned as commander after finding a similar device beneath his car."

The compositions of Hermann Reutter are not well known, though his musical career was one of great excellence and long duration. Reutter was, at one time or another, a teacher, administrator (director of the Hochschule für Musik, first in Berlin and later in Stuttgart), composer, recitalist and accompanist. His song output demonstrates a remarkable sensitivity to poetry and awesome musical originality. It also encompassed an amazing breadth of poetic sources; a variety of Russian poets, Rilke, Rückert, Lorca, Icelandic poems, Hölderlin, ancient Egyptian poems, Goethe, Sappho and Langston Hughes, amongst many others. Reutter was a member of the Nazi Party. He died in Heidenheim an der Brenz."

By 21 May 1243 he had been appointed to the office of Dean of St Paul's Cathedral, the cathedral church of the London diocese. He remained in that office until at least 28 October 1253, his last appearance in a document. He likely continued to hold the office until his death, which occurred before 26 August 1254. His death was commemorated by the cathedral on 9 April, which implies that he died in April 1254."

She was the daughter of blacksmith Johan Thimotheus Tengelin and Anna Maria Hultman, and married the artist Mårten Eskil Winge (1825-1896) in 1867. Hanna Winge was a student at J. J. Ringdahls målarskola (The J.J. Ringdahl Art School) in Stockholm in 1859, and at the Royal Swedish Academy of Arts in 1864-67, and the student of Johan Christoffer Boklund (1817-1880). One of Winge's most known motifs in her art was the depiction of children. Together with Sophie Adlersparre and Molly Rohtlieb, Hanna Winge was the co-founder of the Föreningen Handarbetets vänner (The Friends of the Handicraft's Society), which was founded in 1874 with the purpose of the development of Swedish textile art. She was the leading force of the society, and became known for her design in the Norse style, such as embroidery patterns with dragons. Her Norse style inspired art and place in the revival of the Norse style within art was also demonstrated in her design for a reformed costume, and the design of the villa of Carl Peter Curman in 1878, for which her and her spouse were engaged as decorators. Another area in which her Norse style was displayed was in church textiles, where it spread after her design of an Altar cloth in Uppsala domkyrka in 1882."

  "text" : "Herman Grimm (1828–1901) was a German academic and writer. Grimm's father was Wilhelm Grimm (1786-1859), and his uncle Jakob Grimm (1785-1863), the philologist compilers of indigenous folk tales (\"Brothers Grimm\"). His other uncle was the painter engraver Ludwig Emil Grimm (1790-1863). He attended the Gymnasium of Leopold von Ranke. In 1841 he moved to Berlin and the circle of Bettina von Arnim (1785-1859) and Achim von Arnim (1781-1831) and began publishing drama and novels. He began legal and philological studies at the universities of Berlin and Bonn. In 1857 he visited Rome where the artistic circle of Peter von Cornelius brought his interests to art. In 1859, he married Gisela von Arnim (1827-1889), the von Arnim's daughter, and published his treatise, Die Akademie der Künste und das Verhältniß der Künstler zum Staate. His short-lived periodical, 'über Künstler und Kunstwerke' (1864-1867), published many important essays. It also contained some of the first photographic illustrations of art in a magazine. The first volume of his biography of Michelangelo, 'Das Leben Michelangelos', began appearing in 1868. He wrote his dissertation in 1868 from Leipzig and his habilitation 1870 in Berlin. In 1871 he weighed in on the famous Hans Holbein Meyer Madonna debate concluding against the sound reasoning of the \"Holbein convention\" of eminent scholars, that the Dresden version was the autograph one. He accepted the chair in the newly created discipline of history of art (Lehrstuhl für Kunstgeschichte) in Berlin in 1872 and remained there the rest of his life. Grimm published the first (though incomplete) edition of his popular 'Das Leben Raphaels' in 1872. Grimm's art history writing is characteristic of the period consolidation of standards following unification of Germany, known as the Gründerzeit. When Friedrich Waagen, for example, criticized in the early issues of the Zeitschrift für bildende Kunst Goethe's aesthetic taste of some fifty years before, Grimm, the spokesman for the Gründerzeit, took it personally, refuting Waagen effectively point by point. Grimm's 'Beiträge zur deutschen Culturgeschichte', essays about important cultural personalities, appeared in 1897. Throughout his life his books were popular and his biographies went through numerous editions. At his death he was succeeded by Heinrich Wölfflin. His more famous students included Alfred Lichtwark; Julius Meier-Graefe studied under him but received not degree. Grimm's reputation is that of the arch-Romantic, Gründerzeit art historian. He viewed himself as the intellectual successor of Goethe. His approach to art history was through the \"Great Masters,\" and arranging significance of art through a biographical account of art history. His tastes both typified and led German and continental bourgeois taste. Homer, Dante and Shakespeare were the great writers of their age; in art, only Raphael and Michelangelo could compare. The nineteenth century's adoration of Raphael is in large part Grimm's doing. Wölfflin wrote that Grimm showed indifference to all but the very great. This approach to art history is shared by other historians of his age, including Carl Justi, but was personally savaged in the lectures of Anton Springer. Grimm was one of the first to carefully study reception theory, though he is little acclaimed for it. In the 3rd edition of his life of Raphael (1896) he added a section on Rezeptionsgeschichte. Perhaps because formal analysis and the sanctity of viewing the original work of art mattered so little to him, he was among the first to use lantern slides (reproductive images) in his lectures. Grimm's writings were gradually supplanted by better scholarship in the twentieth century. His emotional approach to art-historical debate, as evidence in the Holbein Madonna incident, proved his allegiances were usually closer to nationalism than art history. In Germany, his concept of the [German] hero as a mover of history was embraced by the Nazis, who saw to it that new and repackaged versions of his writings, such as 'Vom Geist der Deutschen', 1943, appeared up until the war's end.

  "text" : "Harold Jones (1906 – 1971) was a child killer from Abertillery, Monmouthshire in Wales. In 1921, when he was only 15, he was tried at Monmouth Assizes for the murder of an 8-year-old girl, Freda Burnell. However, he was acquitted, and he returned to Abertillery to a hero's welcome. A few weeks afterwards, he murdered 11-year-old Florence \"Flossie\" Little. This time he pleaded guilty to the murder charge, possibly to avoid being tried after he had turned 16, when he would have been liable to the death penalty (see Capital punishment in the United Kingdom). He also admitted that he had committed the earlier murder, and was sentenced to be detained. He was released from prison in 1941. Little is known about his subsequent movements, but he died in 1971. It has been suggested by the writer Neil Milkins that following his release he later became the serial killer Jack the Stripper."

  "text" : "Henri Bouchet-Doumenq (13 May 1834, Paris - 1884) (alternate spellings: Bouchet-Doumeng, Bouchet-Doumencq, Boucher-Doumencq, Boucher-Doumeng, Doumenq-Boucher) was a 19th-century French painter who specialized in portraits and landscapes. He was the second son of the amateur painter Charles Bouchet-Doumenq, whose family was from Montpellier; a work of Charles hangs at the Fondation Calvet. His mother, Antoinette Bonpard, was a native of Vallant-Saint-Georges. The family home was also shared by a friend of the father, Auguste-Barthélemy Glaize, originally from Montpellier. Doumenq studied painting with Glaize and the Swiss painter Marc-Charles-Gabriel Gleyre of the École des Beaux-Arts in Paris. Doumenq was a friend of the painter Eugène Castelnau, and it is through him he met Frédéric Bazille in 1862. He exhibited his paintings on numerous occasions including La Chanteuse in 1865, Jeune fille faisant un bouquet in 1870, Henri B-D au Salon de 1878 in 1878, La rêveuse (Arles) (n°429) (1880), Jeune mère Arlésienne (n°317) (1883), and Dans le Jardin (1886). His works are present in the collections of several museums, Calvet Museum (Avignon), Museum Petiet (Limoux), Library and Museum Inguimbertine City (Carpentras), and the Museum of Fine Arts (Limoges). He had at least one sibling, a sister, Caroline. In 1880, at the age of 46, Doumenq married his art student, Magdalene Bernard (1854-1896), with whom he had two children, Pierre-Charles (1887-1890) Jean (1893-1915)."

After working briefly as a teacher and seaman, by 1871 he had made it to Montreal and began performing as a ventriloquist. He debuted in New York City in 1874 and traveled with various minstrel groups. In 1890 he opened \"Harry Kennedy's Theatre\" in New York, but sold out and moved after one season to a smaller venue (the Alhambra) on Coney Island. He also managed a bar on Fulton Street in Brooklyn. Songs he wrote include \"When Peggy And I Are Wed,\" \"Molly and I and the Baby,\" \"Say Au Revoir, But Not Good-bye,\" \"A Flower from Mother's Grave,\" \"Cradle's Empty, Baby's Gone,\" \"An Old Fashioned Photograph,\" \"Patsy Branigan,\" \"I Owe Ten Dollars to O'Grady,\" \"I Had Fifteen Dollars in my Inside Pocket,\" \"Hush Don't Wake the Baby,\" \"Grandmother's Birthday,\" and \"Little Empty Stockings By the Fire.\" He married his first wife, Nellie in 1876, and she died in 1883. He married again in 1886, and his second spouse (Mary) died in 1890. Survived by five minor children, Kennedy died at his home in Brooklyn of Bright's disease on January 3, 1894 and was buried at Holy Cross Cemetery, Brooklyn."

  "text" : "Hector Frederik Estrup Jungersen (13 January 1854 – 6 March 1917) was a Danish marine zoologist born in Dejbjerg (today part of Ringkøbing-Skjern Municipality) . In 1877 he obtained his degree in zoology, and in 1889 his doctorate of sciences. From 1879 he taught classes at the Metropolitanskolen (Metropolitan School) in Copenhagen, where he served as an assistant professor from 1882 to 1899. During this time period (1886–1901) he was also a lecturer at the nearby Polytekniske Læreanstalt (Poly-technical College). In 1899 he succeeded Christian Frederik Lütken (1827–1901) as professor of zoology and manager of the zoological museum (department of vertebrates) at the University of Copenhagen. In 1912/13 he served as university rector. Jungersen was a proponent of evolutionary comparative morphology, and is known for making significant contributions in the field of ichthyotomy (fish anatomy). In 1895-96 he participated as a senior zoologist in the \"Ingolf Expedition\" to waters near Greenland and Iceland, and afterwards carried out taxonomic investigations of marine fauna. From 1899 to 1917 he was chair of the Danish Natural History Society. He was the author of Volume I (Reptiles and Amphibians, Krybdyr og Padder) of the multi-volume series on Danish fauna, (Danmarks fauna, 1907). From the \"Ingolf Expedition\" he wrote an article on deep-sea marine life and its zoogeographical distribution. A number of his written works have been published in English."

Henry Borwin I was a son of Pribislaw and his wife Woizlava of Pomerania. Pribislav was an Obotrite prince and was the first Lord of Mecklenburg. He died on 30 December 1178 of the wound he received during a tournament at the court of Henry the Lion in Lüneburg, and Henry Borwin I succeeded him as Lord of Mecklenburg. Shortly before Pribislav's death, Henry Borwin I married Matilda, a daughter of Henry the Lion. For several years, Henry Borwin I fought a war with his cousin Nicholas I. His father-in-law was unable to assist him during this war. This lack of outside assistance attracted the attention of King Canute VI of Denmark, who used the situation to expand his position on the Baltic Sea coast. The Danes took Henry Borwin I prisoner. He had to cede Rostock to Denmark and accept Canute VI as his liege lord. In 1200, Canute returned Rostock to him as a fief. In 1202, he fought on the Danish side in the Battle of Stellau. The Danes won, and Henry Borwin was rewarded with two more fiefs: Gadebusch and Ratzeburg. In 1218 and 1219, he assisted in the Danish conquest of Estonia, and from 1225 to 1227, he assisted them in a war against Schauenburg. Henry Borwin I revived the cities of Rostock and Wismar and founded the abbeys of Dobbertin, Tempzin and Sonnenkamp."

  "text" : "Hajrudin \"Šiba\" Krvavac (22 December 1926 – 11 July 1992) was a Bosnian film director most notable for directing movies from the Partisan film genre during 1960s and 70s. His gift for precise storytelling was visible in his early documentaries and would become a staple of his feature films later on. Starting with his directorial debut, the segment Otac (Father) of the anthology film Vrtlog (Vortex, 1964), all his feature films are action films set in World War II. Their storytelling owes a lot to comic books and American action films, especially westerns, with an imaginative combination of action and emotions, personal drama and epic tragedy, idealised heroism and psychological trials, sometimes with a dose of humor. Because of the style of his films, Krvavac was sometimes compared to Howard Hawks."

  "text" : "Hans Paus (born 1656 in Hjartdal – 18 March 1715) was a Norwegian priest and poet. He was parish priest in Kviteseid from 1683 until his death. A popular man in his parish who learned the local dialect (at a time when most church officials and civil servants used Danish), he is noted for being the first to write in dialect in Norway. His poem Stolt Anne (ca. 1700), written in the Kviteseid dialect, became a popular folk song in Telemark. 12 verses were included in Norske Folkeviser (1853) by Magnus Brostrup Landstad and Henrik Ibsen, a relative of Hans Paus, paraphrased the poem in the drama Lady Inger of Ostrat. The poem honored Anne Clausdatter, the owner of Borgestad Manor and a relative of Paus. She rewarded him with an agricultural property (Bukkøy) for it. He owned several agricultural properties in Kviteseid. Hans Paus was the son of Povel Pedersson Paus (1620–1715), parish priest in Hjartdal, and Ingrid Corneliusdatter Trinnepol, who belonged to the Skien patriciate who had made a fortune in the sawmill industry (her family might originate in Trinitapoli, Italy). Hans Paus married Susanne Amundsdatter Morland, daughter of the provost of Øvre Telemark Amund Hanssøn Morland. He succeeded his father-in-law as parish priest in Kviteseid. Amund Morland, of Danish origin, had succeeded Hans Paus' grandfather Peder Paus (born 1590) as the Kviteseid parish priest and provost; hence, the Paus and Morland families have been referred to as a dynasty of priests in Øvre Telemark. Hans Paus' maternal grandparents were timber merchant, sawmill owner and councilman in Skien, Cornelius Jansen Trinnepol (1611–1678) and Anne Iversdatter (1605–1642), a daughter of councilman Iver Christensen and Margrethe von Ansbach. Susanne's maternal grandparents Christen Andersen and Anne Gundersdatter owned Borgestad Manor. Original painted portraits from 1685 of Hans and Susanne came in the possession of Christopher Tostrup Paus and are today found at Herresta in Sweden. Hans Paus was the brother of the judge of Øvre Telemark, Cornelius Paus (1662–1723), who used a coat of arms featuring a wild man."

  "text" : "Hans Henrich Maschmann (6 May 1775 – 19 November 1860) was a Norwegian pharmacist who was central to the effort to provide the country with medicines during the Napoleonic Wars. Hans Henrich Maschmann was born in Oslo, Norway. He was the son of Johan Heinrich Maschmann (1719-1785) who had re-located from Hamburg, Germany. From 1773, his father had been the owner-operator of the pharmaceutical firm, Elefantapoteket i Christiania. In 1786, Hans Maschmann was sent to school in Hamburg which was followed three years later with a four year apprenticeship at a pharmacy in Halden in Østfold. Later he traveled to Kongsberg, where he attended lectures of the Danish chemist Nicolay Tychsen (1751-1804). In 1796, he took his examen pharmaceuticum. In 1797, following the death of both of his parents, Maschmann received his license to acquire and operate the pharmacy. When Denmark-Norway was drawn into the Napoleonic wars in 1807, the resulting British naval embargo limited the supply of goods, including pharmaceuticals. Maschmann worked with other pharmaceutical wholesaler in the country to avoided medical shortages during these crisis years which extended until the Treaty of Kiel in 1814. In 1839, he turned over management of the pharmacy firm to his eldest son Carl Gustav Maschmann, who died in 1848. He managed the pharmacy until 1856 when his younger son, Bernt Sverdrup Maschmann joined the firm. Maschmann was a member of Royal Norwegian Society of Sciences and Letters from 1825. He was appointed Knight of the Order of St. Olav in 1853 and also knighted in the Swedish Order of Vasa."

Marila paints series of large canvases and works with themes from religious subjects by 16th century painters such as Albrecht Dürer and Matthias Grünewald. He has created dynamic self-portraits and maps, mainly of small industrial towns in Finland such as Mänttä and Riihimäki. In recent years, Marila has painted monumental flowers paintings inspired by the 17th century Dutch floral still lifes, and 19th century Romanticism of Henri Fantin-Latour. The role of material and painting gestures becomes more prominent when figurativeness and non-figurativeness are engaged in the large-scale canvases. In 2011 Marilala was awarded with Carnegie Art Award, worth one million Swedish krona. Marila is the second Finnish artist to win the biannual award for Scandinavian artists."

In 1895 he became rector of Holy Trinity Sloane Street, and in 1902 he moved from there to St Luke's Church, Chelsea, where he was also rector. He was Archdeacon of Middlesex from 1903 to 1930. He also became in 1903 chaplain to the 1st Middlesex Royal Engineers Volunteers, later redesignated the 2nd London Divisional Royal Engineers of the Territorial Army. From 1894 to 1930 he was Examining Chaplain to the Bishop of London, serving three incumbent bishops - Frederick Temple (about whom Bevan authored a memoir of Temple's period in London, published 1906), Mandell Creighton and Arthur Winnington-Ingram. Through his mother, Bevan was the grand-nephew of John Smalman, the builder of Quatford Castle in Shropshire, which later became his own country residence when he inherited it in 1889. In 1883 he married Charlotte, the second daughter of the 8th Viscount Molesworth. The organist and composer, John Ireland (1879–1962), whose 'Te Deum in F' (1907) is dedicated to Bevan, was appointed sub-organist at Holy Trinity Sloane Street in 1896, and followed Bevan to St Luke's Church, Chelsea as organist in 1904."

His father was Thomas Nugent, 1st Baron Nugent of Riverston, his mother Marianna Barnewall (a daughter of Henry Barnewall, 2nd Viscount Barnewall of Kingsland and Hon. Mary Netterville). In 1694 he was outlawed for high treason, probably for supporting James II during the Williamite War in Ireland. However, he must have been rehabilitated, as he served as a Cornet Charles Mordaunt, 3rd Earl of Peterborough's Dragoons while in Spain. From 1715 he styled himself as 2nd Baron Nugent of Riverston. In February 1737 he recovered his estate by Act of Parliament 1728. He married Susanna Catherina Beresford, daughter of Sir Tristram Beresford, 3rd Bt. and Hon. Nichola Sophia Hamilton, in 1703. He died on 5 March 1738 without issue and was succeeded by his brother, William Nugent, 3rd Baron Nugent of Riverston."

His notion of Männerbünde placed male associations, where he deemed masculinity more \"unfettered\", in opposition to the family which he saw as dominated by women. Notions of Männerbünde, though not just Schurtz's, would have an influence on Nazi Germany's SS while in a very different way his ideas on same-sex bonding has become of historical interest to Queer studies."

  "text" : "Henry Britton (24 January 1843 – 21 February 1938) was a journalist in colonial Australia Britton was the second son of Alexander and Lydia Britton, born in Derby, England, where his father was engaged in tuition, was also a contributor to the press, and had some repute as a public lecturer. Henry Britton emigrated to Australia with his family in November 1854, and reached Melbourne in February 1855. He at once proceeded to Castlemaine, Victoria, where his father established a newspaper called The Miners' Right, subsequently named The Castlemaine Advertiser. He learned the business of a journalist in his father's office. In 1863 Britton joined the parliamentary reporting staff of The Age newspaper, Melbourne. Two years later he transferred his services to the Argus, Melbourne. In 1870 he acted as special correspondent for the Argus in Fiji. The series of letters he wrote was republished under the title of \"Fiji in 1870,\" and the volume bad a large sale. In December 1871, as special correspondent of the Argus, he accompanied the Australian Eclipse Expedition to Cape York, northern coast of Australia, where observations of the total eclipse of the sun were made. His account of the proceedings of the expedition was afterwards republished in Nature, the London scientific journal. In 1873 he went to Fiji again as special commissioner for the Argus to inquire into the working of the South Pacific labour trade, in connection with which many scandals had arisen. The notorious brig Carl had kidnapped a number of South Sea Islanders under circumstances of great atrocity. The Australian Governments agreed to pay the expense of returning the kidnappees to their several homes in the islands. One of the vessels commissioned for this purpose by Commodore Stirling was H.M. schooner Alacrity. Britton was allowed a passage in this vessel with some fifty or sixty of the savages, and he assisted at their landing under circumstances of considerable danger at their various homes in the Marshall, Gilbert, and Ellice groups of islands, north and south of the line. In 1874 he was again called upon in the capacity of special correspondent of the Argus to go to Fiji in the suite of Sir Hercules Robinson, the then Governor of New South Wales, who had made a request that he might be sent on the occasion of the annexation of that country. Britton was present at the official interviews with Seru Epenisa Cakobau and the other leading chiefs, and he fully described the annexation ceremonies, which included many incidents of peculiar interest. Britton was also acting at this time as special correspondent for The Times. In 1877 Britton was made chief of the Argus reporting staff and sub-editor. Falling into bad health, and having a desire to visit the old country, which he had not seen since infancy, he in 1878 made a voyage round the world. Returning to Melbourne, after a year's absence, he resumed his connection with the Argus, to which he contributed a series of social sketches under the signature of \"Marcellus,\" and also a series of papers explaining the modus operandi of the medical clairvoyants of Melbourne. Early in 1883 he joined the contributing staffs of the Age and Leader. At the end of that year he published a romance called \"Loloma,\" illustrative of cannibal life among the Fijians in the olden time. At the general election of 1886, he sought parliamentary honours at the hands of the electors of Castlemaine, but was not successful. In November 1889 the proprietors of the Leader offered prizes for the two best locally produced Christmas stories for publication in their Christmas number; there was a very large number of competitors, and Britton was awarded the first prize for his story \"Jack Travis's Merry Christmas: a Tale of Australian Adventure.\" In March 1890 Britton was appointed dramatic editor of the Australasian. Britton died at Wonthaggi Hospital on 21 February 1938, at the age of 94."

His most famous poem, written c. 345 CE, describes the bravery of Samudragupta and is inscribed on the Allahabad Pillar. At least one of his known inscriptions was written as a panegyric. Harisena was an early writer of Kāvya poetry; Arthur Berriedale Keith says of it, \"Harisena's poem bears expressly the title Kavya, though it consists both of prose and verse. Its structure is similar to the delineation of kings adopted in the prose romances of Subandhu and Bana\". Other works attributed to either this author (or others by the same name) include Apabramsa Dharmapariksa, Karpuraprakara (Suktavall), the medical treatise Jagatsundari-Yogamaladhikara, Yasodharacanta, Astahnikakatha and Brhatkathakosa. He was also the chief minister of Samudragupta's empire.Harishena had a great interest in playing the lute with his friend Samudragupta. Harishena had also played an important role in the coronation of Samudragupta with Kumaradevi."

In 1983 he obtained Swiss citizenship by naturalization and earned a doctorate in Philosophy form the University of Geneva. He taught French in high school until he was fired in 2002 by the Swiss government for \"anti-democratic\" statements.  He defended stoning for adultery and believes AIDS is a \"divine curse\".He went to court and won his trial but the Swiss government has refused to reinstate him. He again attracted the attention of the press and Swiss authorities by virtue of his radical statements. At the 2014 meeting of the Union of Islamic Organizations in France, he stated: \"“All the evil in the world originates from the Jews and the Zionist barbarism.” In June 2016 he was invited to speak about islamophobia at a Swiss high school.He explained that \"A woman is like a pearl in a shell. If it is shown it fosters jealousy. Here a woman without a veil is like a two euro coin. Visible to all she goes from hand to hand.\""

Mais was born in Westbury on Trym, Bristol, England, the son of Henry Mais (1805–1888), engineer, and his wife Amelia Jane, née Coathupe (1803–1868). Mais junior was educated at Bishop's College, Bristol, and was articled for seven years to W. M. Peniston, one of Isambard Kingdom Brunel's chief engineers, working on English railways. At Birmingham, Mais made steam engines and superintended the building of locomotives at Swindon, in 1850 he worked on the Port of Hull docks. Mais migrated to Australia, intending to start an engineering business arriving in Sydney in December 1850. However, he found unsettled conditions and became acting engineer for the Sydney Railway Company. Later he worked as assistant engineer for City Commissioners' Department on the water and sewerage works. In January 1857 a select committee accused him of inexcusable errors and 'gross misconduct'. Mais then went to Victoria and worked for the railway contractors Cornish & Bruce on the Sandhurst-Melbourne line. For three years Mais was engineer and general manager of the Melbourne and Suburban Railway Company, he won praise as a 'first class man in every sense of the word'. The Colonial Bank of Australasia awarded him £25 in December 1863 for his conduct of the Melbourne railway during the floods. On 27 March 1867 Mais was appointed engineer-in-chief to the South Australian Government on a salary of £750. Mais was president of the Royal Society of South Australia in 1885. Mais resigned as engineer-in-chief in March 1888 after being accused of accepting private work and using government draftsmen on Silverton Tramway Company projects. Mais then became a consulting engineer in Melbourne, was chairman of the Victorian Advisory Committee of the Institution of Civil Engineers for sixteen years. He was a member of the Institution of Civil Engineers (London), of the Society of Engineers UK, and the American Society of Civil Engineers. Mais died at his home in South Yarra, Victoria on 25 February 1916 and was survived by three sons and two daughters. He was buried in Kew Cemetery on 28 February 1916."

  "text" : "Heinz Czechowski (7 February 1935 – 21 October 2009) was a German poet and dramatist. At the age of ten, Czechowski survived the highly destructive bombing of his birthplace of Dresden. After training in surveying and graphic design, he studied at the Johannes R. Becher Institute of Literature in Leipzig, where he was strongly influenced by Georg Maurer and the Saxon school. His first published poems appeared in 1957 in an issue of Neue Deutsche Literatur. From 1961 to 1965, he worked at the Mitteldeutscher Verlag publishing house in Halle, Saxony-Anhalt. Between 1971 and 1973, he wrote plays for the city of Magdeburg, after which he became a freelance writer. Czechowski produced free translations of the work of foreign poets (e.g. Anna Akhmatova, Mikhail Lermontov, Marina Tsvetaeva, and Yiannis Ritsos). He was a founding member of the Leipzig Free Academy of the Arts."

  "text" : "Henry Streatfeild (1706 - 1762) was a substantial British landowner and member of the prominent Chiddingstone, Kent Streatfeild family. Henry Streatfeild was born on 3 June 1706 in Chiddingstone. He was the son of Henry Streatfeild (1679-1747) and Elizabeth Beard. By tradition, the first son in each generation was called Henry which can sometimes cause challenges for local historians. He was admitted to the Middle Temple on 29 October 1723. The Streatfeild family owned numerous estates in Kent, including Tyhurst and Chiddingstone Cobham. Henry Streatfeild bought Bore Place in 1759. Upon acquiring Bore Place, Henry chose to lease the attached lands to tenant farmers and Bore Place estate was divided in two, with one tenant farmer occupying the main house (South Bore Place) and another living in North Bore Place. Henry himself chose to live at High Street House in Chiddingstone, later known as Chiddingstone Castle, which he had inherited from his father in 1747. Henry married Lady Anne Sidney, the illegitimate daughter of Jocelyn Sidney of Penshurst Place on 25 September 1752. at Enfield. On Sir Jocelyn's death, Henry could potentially have inherited the Penshurst Estate as the 7th Earl left no legitimate heir and on his death-bed wrote a will leaving everything to his 14-year-old illegitimate daughter, Anne. This however was successfully contested by her cousins, and after much legal wrangling Henry and Anne only received the income from the Sidneys' Welsh properties - but these were still fairly significant. Anne brought with her a marriage portion of £10,000 and estates in Glamorganshire. Henry and Anne had five children, though the first died as an infant: \n*  Henry Streatfeild b. 1753, d. 1753 \n*  Sophia Streatfeild b. 1755, d. 30 Nov 1835 \n*  Harriet Streatfeild b. 1756, d. 1824 \n*  Henry Streatfeild b. 13 May 1757, d. 22 Aug 1829 \n*  Richard Thomas Streatfeild b. 23 Dec 1759, d. 26 Aug 1813 Henry died on 4 April 1762 and was interred in the family vault at St Mary's Church Chiddingstone."

  "text" : "Herbert Reed (August 7, 1928 – June 4, 2012) was an American musician, vocalist and founding member of The Platters, who were known for their hits during the 1950s and 1960s. Reed, who was the last surviving original member of the group, which he co-founded with four other musicians in 1953, is credited with creating The Platters' name. Reed thought of the group's name after noticing that DJs in the 1950s called their records, \"platters\". Reed was raised in poverty in Kansas City, Missouri, and moved to Los Angeles when he was fifteen years old. He moved to the Boston area during the 1970s, after the success of The Platters. He was the only member of The Platters who sang on all of the approximately 400 songs recorded by the group. His vocals can be heard on The Platters' biggest hits, including Smoke Gets in Your Eyes, The Great Pretender, Twilight Time and My Prayer. As the last surviving original member of The Platters, Reed waged a long, but successful, federal court battle over the rights to the name, The Platters. The courts ruled that Reed was the only heir to the group's name. In 2012, Reed said in an interview, \"It's not right to have someone steal your name. It's just not right. We were cheated back then, but that's how things were done...It's theft, and I have to fight it so that no other artist faces this.\" Reed toured throughout his career. He performed as many as 200 concerts per year until 2012, when he stopped due to declining health. He died from complications from several ailments, including heart disease, at a hospice in Boston on June 4, 2012, aged 83. He had most recently resided in Arlington, Massachusetts."

The jailer was not at home but his wife was. She loved music and cordials and being once a beauty was by no means insensible to flattery even from men who could not see. She fell an easy victim to their wiles, and the blind harpers contrived to steal the keys out of her pocket, oppressed as she was with love and music.\" \"They did not forget to make the turnkey drunk also, and while Higgins remained behind soothering his infatuated dupe, Keenan escaped with Higgins’ boy on his back to guide him over a ford in the river Strule, by which he took his ,,, back to Kilmoon and repeated the offense for which he had been previously imprisoned.\" He was the Hugh Higgins, blind Native of Mayo age 75 years, who performed at the Belfast Harp Festival in 1791. He had performed at Granard in 1791 \"but won no premiums. In fact, he did not play at all at the second hall at Granard, having taken offense at something connected with the arrangements. Arthur O'Neill's avowed friendship for Higgins was a guarantee of his respectability.\""

Levi was born in Massachusetts and became an Assistant professor of Anthropology at Temple University. She received her Bachelor of Arts degree in Anthropology from the University of Massachusetts in 1990 and went on to receive a PhD in Anthropology in 2001 from New York University. She currently lives in Philadelphia. She is currently doing research on street musicians in Condesa in Mexico City. Her research mainly focuses on performance practices, global and local contexts, and the political uses to which they are directed. Levi has performed ethnographic field work on lucha libre in Mexico City and the significance it has in the Mexican culture. Not only did she do ethnographic field work, but she also trained with a retired lucha libre wrestler and his students. Levi worked with this well respected wrestler for a year and a half and incorporated this as research into her book The World of Lucha Libre  This allowed Levi to view lucha libre as an arena that examined the connections between ideas of mestizaje, class, gender, aesthetic values, mass mediation, and the state. This thus led her to write her book The World of Lucha Libra in which these ideas are explored. In a Los Angeles Times interview in 2009 she described lucha libre created a unique, cross-class \"cultural phenomenon\" that put on a \"display of these larger-than-life heroes but heroes that everybody...knew [and] came from their social class.\""

He was the subject of a best-selling autobiography which has been criticised for sensationalism. He was also the subject of controversy for having claimed that he was the prisoner of war shown in a photograph staring at Heinrich Himmler, when the prisoner in question is identified elsewhere as a Soviet soldier."

  "text" : "Hans Clemer was a French painter of Flemish origin who worked most of his career at Piedmont. There is little documentation of the birth of Hans Clemer. The first records date from the late fifteenth century. The artistic career of Hans Clemer shows an articulate culture, attentive to innovative technical solutions, in which there are references to his contemporary Giovanni Martino Spanzotti.A document found in Aix-en-Provence, speaks about two painters, Josse Lieferinxe and Mestre Ans and contains an agreement between the two artists, linked by kinship and the leader of the Brotherhood of St. Anthony of Padua, the monastery of Aix, for the realization of a work representing the saint.To the end of the fifteenth century Clemer seems to be already in service in the valleys of the marquisate of Saluzzo and in particular, in Maira Valley, in the parish church of Elva, in which it is possible to see the cycle of frescoes depicting scenes from the life of Mary and a Crucifixion, dating from 1493. Those two works are still well preserved in the choir and apse of the church, a beautiful building in the style of the late Romanesque period. This masterpiece has earned him the title of Master of Elva, but the artist's presence in much of the territory of the marquisate is proved by a series of works ranging from the religious subject to historical and mythological representations. Soon, he was called to work even in the capital of the marquisate: Saluzzo. Here Hans Clemer made his last works commonly dated to the period 1511-1512. Beyond the paintings on the facade of the cathedral of Saluzzo, Clemer also created the decoration of the house and the magnificent Altarpiece of Our Lady of Mercy in the Cavassa house."

Husein Mekhmedov was of the Turkish minority in Bulgaria and as wrestling is Turkey’s national sport, he was introduced to wrestling at a young age. Mehmedov competed in heavyweight his entire career and was equally strong at both styles of wrestling. He was selected to the Bulgarian national team in 1950 after his military service with the Bulgarian Army. Mehmedov had a brief, but quite successful international career. He first competed internationally at the 1955 World Student Games, winning gold in Greco-Roman heavyweight. In 1956, he won bronzes in both Greco-Roman and freestyle at the World Cup and established himself as one of the medal contenders at both heavyweight styles at the 1956 Olympics. At Melbourne, Mekhmedov won silver in freestyle, but a few days later had to withdraw from the Greco-Roman event after two bouts due to injury. In 1957, he won gold in freestyle and silver in Greco-Roman heavyweight at the World Student Games and later won bronze at the 1957 World Freestyle Wrestling Championships. Those World Championships were Mehmedov’s last international appearance as he finished his competitive career in 1959. He then worked as a wrestling coach in Bulgaria until 1989 when he emigrated to Turkey. He settled in Istanbul, where he died in March 2014 at the age of 90."

  "text" : "Helen S. Hawkins is best known as a feminist and a producer and host for KPBS. Hawkins co-founded and was the first president of the San Diego chapter of the National Organization for Women (NOW). Later, she would be awarded the NOW Susan B. Anthony award for her “courage and compassion and work for women’s rights.” Along this same vein of work, Hawkins served on the Commission for Affirmative Action and Women’s Rights. She also aided in the creation of Dimensions, a women’s networking group. After raising a family, Hawkins went back to school and received her doctorate in History at the University of California, San Diego in 1975. After graduating, she became the publications director for the Institute on Global Conflict and Cooperation at the University of California, San Diego. In the late 1970s, Hawkins went to work at KPBS television as Executive Director of humanities programming. She produced and appeared in over 100 programs. Many of these programs focused on women’s rights and issues. Her production “California Rights” earned her an Emmy and a Silver Gavel Award from the American Bar Association. Hawkins died in 1989 from a rare form of cancer. The Helen Hawkins Memorial Fund was created by the San Diego Independent Scholars Board of Directors after her death. In 2005, Hawkins was inducted into the San Diego County Women’s Hall of Fame."

However, the marriage never took place. In 1314, Duke Henry married Countess Elizabeth of Virneburg. The marriage remained childless. Henry helped his brother, Frederick the Fair, in his fight for the German throne. After the Battle of Mühldorf on 28 September 1322, Henry, King Frederick and 1,300 other Austrian nobles were taken prisoners. Henry spent several years in the Bohemian castle Biirglitz before being released for a ransom of 3,000 ducats and the cession of his rights to Znojmo, Castell, Laa and Weitra. Exhausted by the harsh prison conditions, Henry died at the age of 28. His widow had him buried at Königsfelden Abbey, along with several members of his immediate family."

  "text" : "Henry English Fulford, also known as Harry English Fulford, or simply H.E. Fulford (1859—1929) was a British diplomat, who spent most of his career in China. H.E. Fulford was born in Chepstow, Monmouthshire. His father, Rev. John Fulford, had been an Anglican priest in Australia (Adelaide and Melbourne). Soon after the boy's birth, the Fulford family returned to Australia, where Rev. Fulford (later, Rev. Canon Fulford) resumed his ecclesiastical career. After graduating from the Melbourne Grammar School, Henry Fulford went to England, to acquire some business experience in London. In 1880 H.E. Fulford joined the British Consular Service, and was sent to work in China. In 1887, when he was a student interpreter at the British Consulate in Newchwang (today's Yingkou), he joined two British officers on leave from India - H. E. M. James of the Indian Civil Service and Francis Younghusband of the British Army - and went with them on a tour of Manchuria. As he was the only person of the three Brits who had a China background, he provided the British party with a language and cultural expertise. Fulford served for a number of years in the British consulate in Newchwang. He became the consul there in 1899, and served in that position during the Boxer Uprising and the Russo-Japanese War, informing the British governments on the events as they developed.In 1906, he was appointed the British Consul General in Mukden (now, Shenyang).Later, he held a number of other consular posts throughout China. He served as a Consul General in Hankou (1911), acting Consul General in Shanghai (1913), and Consul General in Tianjin (1912-1917). In 1917, Fulford retired and returned to Australia. On May 15, 1929, his daughter found him shot dead, apparently in a suicide, in the bedroom of his Melbourne residence."

Born the seventh of eight children in Stockbridge, New York, his parents were Methodists of English and Scotch ancestry. In 1865, Armour established the New York syndicate of Armour Meats under the name Armour, Plankinton & Co. This move was prompted by a series of restrictive laws regarding lines of credit in effect throughout most Midwestern states at the time. American forebear of the Armour family, Scotsman James Armour, was among the earliest to settle in the newly established British colony of New Jersey, arriving just three years after its establishment in 1664, though settlers from Holland, Germany, Sweden, and France had been living in the area since 1614 in the former New Netherland and New Sweden (Nya Sverige) colonies. Armour died on September 8, 1901 at his New York City home and was laid to rest at the family mausoleum in Woodlawn Cemetery."

Ōen promulgated his highly xenophobic views through his school, the Gendōkan, which he founded in 1837 at Chiba Castle. He advocated resistance to Western influence and trade, and recommended the expulsion of foreigners from Japan. In 1868. he became a teacher at the Jishūkan, and also worked as an advisor to Iwakura Tomomi. He died aged 73 at the home of his student Otaguro Tomoo. After his death, his students, led by Tomoo, adapted his teachings to form the basis of the Shinpūren movement."

He represented Kinistino from 1952 to 1959 in the Legislative Assembly of Saskatchewan as a Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF) member. He was born in Halanzy, the son of François Victor-Joseph Begrand and Marie Jungers, and came to St. Louis, Saskatchewan with his family when he was just six months old. The family received Canadian citizenship in 1900 and acquired a homestead in 1908. Begrand served in the Canadian Army during World War I and received training as a mechanic. After returning home, he worked as a mechanic at a garage in Watrous before opening his own garage in Hoey. In 1920, he married Phyllis Papen. Begrand was a dealer for British American Oil and sold agricultural equipment for International Harvester. He served as reeve for the rural municipality of St. Louis from 1937 to 1952 and was also chair of the separate school board. He was an unsuccessful candidate for the Rosthern seat in the provincial assembly in 1944. Begrand died in office of a heart attack in the Wakaw hospital at the age of 63."
