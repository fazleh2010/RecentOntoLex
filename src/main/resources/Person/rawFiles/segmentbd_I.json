  "text" : "Ioan Constantin Filitti (Romanian pronunciation: [iˈon konstanˈtin fiˈliti], first name also Ion; Francized Jean C. Filitti; May 8, 1879 – September 21, 1945) was a Romanian historian, diplomat and conservative theorist, best remembered for his contribution to social history, legal history, genealogy and heraldry. A member of the Conservative Party and an assistant of its senior leader Titu Maiorescu, he had aristocratic (boyar) origins and an elitist perspective. Among his diverse contributions, several focus on 19th-century modernization under the Regulamentul Organic regime, during which Romania was ruled upon by the Russian Empire. As a historian, Filitti is noted for his perfectionism, and for constantly revising his own works. I. C. Filitti had an auspicious debut in diplomacy and politics, but his career was mired in controversy. A \"Germanophile\" by the start of World War I, he secretly opposed the pact between Romania and the Entente Powers, and opted to stay behind in German-occupied territory. He fell into disgrace for serving the collaborationist Lupu Kostaki as Prefect and head of the National Theater, although he eventually managed to overturn his death sentence for treason. Filitti became a recluse, focusing on his scholarship and press polemics, but was allowed to serve on the Legislative Council after 1926. In his political tracts, written well after the Conservative Party's demise, I. C. Filitti preserves the orthodox conservative principles of Maiorescu. His attachment to boyar tradition was expanded into a critique of centralized government, etatism and Romanian liberalism. Toward the end of his life, he supported the dictatorial regime known as National Renaissance Front."

  "text" : "Isagani M. \"Gani\" Yambot (November 16, 1934 – March 2, 2012) was a Filipino journalist who served as the publisher of the Philippine Daily Inquirer from 1994 until his death in 2012. Yambot was born in Tagbilaran City, Bohol, in 1934. Both his parents were teachers: his mother taught science while his father taught English and mathematics. The family moved to Manila, settling in the Tondo district. He studied at the University of the Philippines, where he earned a degree in liberal arts. He earned a fellowship to the Washington Journalism Center. His first job in journalism was at the now closed Manila Times, which he joined in 1953. He remained with the newspaper, covering both Malacañan Palace and the Philippines' Senate. He left the Manila Times, taking a position as a night editor for United Press International (UPI) in 1973. In 1974, Yambot joined the former Times Journal, serving as that newspaper's managing editor from 1983 until 1985. From 1981-82, Yambot worked as a press attaché for the Philippines' Ambassador to Saudi Arabia, Benjamin Romualdez, in Jeddah. He served as the press attaché for the Embassy of the Philippines in Washington, D.C. from 1985-86. Upon his return to the Philippines from his diplomatic posting in Washington, Yambot joined the Malaya newspaper as its managing editor in 1988. Yambot became an editor at the Philippine Daily Inquirer in April 1989, remaining at that daily newspaper for the rest of his career. He was named executive editor and, in June 1991, associate publisher. He became publisher of the Daily Inquirer in February 1994. In 1999, major advertisers who supported former Philippine President Joseph Estrada organized a five-month-long boycott of the Philippine Daily Inquirer. Yambot denounced the boycott as politically motivated. He was awarded the Outstanding News Editor award from the College Editors Guild of the Philippines in 1975. He won the Catholic Mass Media Award for Best In-Depth Article in 1994 and the Lakan Award for Outstanding Achievement in Journalism in 1995."

Bishop Vynnyckyj was an Orthodox bishop from 1680 to 1691, and a Catholic bishop from 1691 to 1700. Vynnyckyj's initiative was important for the growth of the Ruthenian Catholic Church from the Union of Brest. Vynnyckyj was widely believed to be a Reddist in La Société Pleine Rouge, although evidence to substantiate this claim is elusive as many of the sacred texts and manifestos released by this society remain lost to the modern world. Today the diocese of Przemysl is a Polish diocese of the Byzantine rite vinculated to the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church."

In the context of a deepening political crisis, Canavan became an active member of the Alliance Party of Northern Ireland shortly after its 1970 inception. Ivor Canavan was elected to Londonderry City Council in 1973. In December that year, he took part in the negotiations that culminated in the Sunningdale Agreement. Canavan was elected Deputy Mayor of Londonderry in 1974 and, the following year, became the first and only Alliance Mayor of Londonderry. In May 1976, the Canavan family home was bombed. The Provisional IRA claimed responsibility. No one was in the house at the time of the blast. Canavan served as Chairman of the Police Authority (NI) Complaints Committee. from 1977-79. He resigned from this post and retired from active politics to take up a position with DuPont in Geneva, Switzerland. Ivor Canavan was appointed an OBE in 1980 for public services in Northern Ireland. Canavan's brother Michael was a prominent member of the Social Democratic and Labour Party."

  "text" : "Indra Pala (960-990) was ruler of Pala Dynasty (900–1100) of Kamarupa Kingdom. Ratna Pala's son, Purandera Pala, predeceased him, and thus the later's son, Indra Pala, his grandson became successor. Indra Pala defeated King Kalyan Chandra (975-95 AD) of Vanga, who was the son of Sri Chandra (925-75 AD). He issued two copper plate grants in 8th year (Guwahati plates) and 28th year (Guwakuchi plates) of his reign. In these records the king is adorned in grandiose epithets. The epithet Varah(descendant of the Boar incarnation of Vishnu) is applied for the first time to Pragjyotisha king who is also described as Prachi-Pradipa (the light of the east) and a past master of grammar (Pada), Vakya (Mimamsa), logic (Tarka), and Tantra. The donee of Guwakuchi grant belongs to Deva family, which is now a non-Brahminical cognomen in Bengal. His family belonged to Vai village in the land called Savathi (Sanskrit, Sravasti); same as the modern Baigram near Hilly railway station in Bogra district of Bangladesh. The area was formerly known as Pahuni yojana which later came to be known as Sravasti, apparently, because a larger number of Brahmins had settled there from Sravasti, a well-known ancient centre of learning in UP. It was also the capital of old Kosala Janapada and an early centre of Buddhism and was situated at the site of modern Set-Mahet on the border of Gonda and Bahraich districts. A unique and interesting feature of Guwakuchi grant is that after the details of gift land, there is enumeration of no less than 32 names of the Paramesvara i.e., the reigning monarch. Some of the serials are given here (1) Kirti-Kamalini-Martanda, (6) Arasika-Bhima, (28) Medini-Tilaka, (31) Turanga-Revanta, (32) Haragirija-Chasana-Pankaja-Rajo-Ranj itottamanga. Indra Pala who was addicted more to study than to war, was succeeded by his son Go Pala (990-1015 AD) and the latter by his son Harsha Pala. Earlier there was no information about these two rulers, but copper plate grant issued by Go Pala and found at Gachtal, near Doboka in Nagaon district, has changed it all."

After his medical studies, he settled in Heraklion working as a doctor. He participated in all the major revolutions against the Ottoman Empire and distinguished for his rhetorical abilities and his prudence. He was the president of the Cretan revolutionary assembly (1878) and the main negotiator for the Pact of Halepa. During the revolution of 1897 he was president of the Cretan general assembly and later the first Speaker of the Cretan parliament. In 1905 he supported the Theriso revolt and Eleftherios Venizelos. He was elected representative of Heraklion several times. He died in 1924 in Athens and was honoured by the Hellenic Parliament."

  "text" : "Irv Culver was an American aeronautical engineer. Most notable of all his accomplishments, Culver is credited for solving a fatal flaw in the Lockheed P-38, which killed several pilots. A humorous episode during World War II resulted in giving the very secret Lockheed \"Advanced Development Projects\" division the name \"Skunk Works\". A phone call to W. A. \"Dick\" Pulver was misdirected to Irv Culver who answered the phone with \"Skonk Works, inside man Culver\" and the name stuck. Another variant of the story relates that the original Skunk Works was located in a circus tent adjacent to the Lockheed plastics fabrication facility which smelled bad and reminded the engineers of the \"L'il Abner\" comic strip. Reportedly, Culver showed up for work wearing a civil defense gas mask as a gag and when he answered the phone he said \"Skonk Works\" referring to the cartoon. \"Kelly overheard him and chewed out Irv for ridicule: \"Culver, you're fired,\" Johnson roared. \"Get your ass out of my tent.\" Culver showed up for work the next day and Johnson never said a word. Kelly Johnson referred to Culver as \"a brilliant designer\" in his autobiography Culver was interested in a variety of aircraft configurations and developed guidelines for laying out the twist distribution on tailless aircraft. He also helped to design an experimental helicopter, distinguished by a forward-sweeping blade, that was extremely easy to fly. In 1966, Culver, Thomas Hanson and Lance Hook were awarded a patent (US3261407) for a rigid rotor system which set world speed records for Lockheed helicopters and laid the foundation for aerobatic rotorcraft. It earned Culver the Dr. Alexander Klemin Award from the American Helicopter Society. In recent years, Culver was noted by Dan Armstrong, President of Experimental Soaring Association, for his work with Jim Maupin designing gliders intended to be built by craftsmen from plans. Culver is a well-known aerodynamicist. He published a 13-page paper on the design analysis for the Windrose 15-meter glider that he designed with Maupin."

  "text" : "Ivor Gordon Davies  (21 July 1917 – 27 June 1992) was an Anglican priest who was the Archdeacon of Lewisham between 1972 and 1985. Educated at the University of Wales, where he took a Second in Greats in 1939; and at the University of London (Bachelor of Divinity, 1951), Davies prepared for ordination at St Stephen's House, Oxford, being ordained deacon in 1941 and priest in 1942 for the Diocese of Llandaff. Following a three-year period as Curate at St Paul, Grangetown, Cardiff, he served between 1944-47 as a Chaplain to the Forces before returning to parish work as Curate of St John the Baptist, Felixstowe between 1947-49. Appointed Perpetual Curate (a title effectively identical to vicar) of St Thomas’, Ipswich in that year, he subsequently became a Residentiary Canon at Southwark Cathedral in 1957; serving as Diocesan Canon Missioner until his appointment as Archdeacon of Lewisham. Ivor Davies served under three Bishops of Southwark, and was a key figure in the diocese during the episcopate of Mervyn Stockwood, whose tenure saw many changes and developments in theology and theological training, particularly during the 1960s when Southwark became known as the centre of the ferment which was nicknamed \"South Bank Religion\". Although himself an Anglo-Catholic in formation and in churchmanship, his early association with the Church in Wales Catholic wing seems to have become modified during his subsequent career in the Church of England, and he became a friend and associate of Honest to God author John AT Robinson during that prelate's time as Bishop of Woolwich. Indeed, Davies is credited with doing much to develop initiatives in pastoral care of the sick - and in modernising approaches to spiritual counselling, measures that would later be taken up by Robinson and others in due course. Shortly after his retirement, he summed up the Stockwood and Robinson period in a way that also cast light on his own approach to ministry. \"John (Robinson) and Mervyn (Stockwood) were a duo of the same creative mould, and under their combined leadership the Diocese (of Southwark) experienced one of the most constructive periods of its life. They were turbulent days, and I received many letters expressing great unease from those who were unsettled by what was being written and done. But I knew from personal contact with John that he had the heart of the Gospel in him and the disturbance for me was a challenge to be faced...What John did was to nudge me carefully but clearly into the acceptance of new ways of working, and several areas of diocesan life which were earlier part of my brief as Missioner were put by John under new management. For instance, I introduced into the diocese seminars on Clinical Theology and Pastoral Counselling...He took the initiative of appointing a specialist to be full time in promoting this field of ministry. I started courses for churchwardens and Parochial Church Council members and was in on lay training generally. John saw the need for greater specialisation... I count myself among those who feel greatly indebted to him. His life and work were inspirational to the very end\" Following his retirement, Archdeacon Davies retired to Felixstowe, holding Permission to Officiate in the Diocese of St Edmundsbury and Ipswich until his death."

Already in 1944 a cruel guard named \"Ivan\", sharing the distinct duties and the extremely violent behavior with a guard named \"Nicholas\", is mentioned in survivor literature (Rok w Treblince by Jankiel Wiernik, translated into English as A Year in Treblinka in 1945); however, very little is known about Ivan Marchenko. John Demjanjuk was accused first of being Ivan the Terrible at the Treblinka concentration camp, but in 2011 he was accused of war crimes as a different guard named Ivan Demjanjuk who served at the Sobibor extermination camp."

Asheim earned his doctorate in theology in 1961 for thesis entitled Faith and Education according to Martin Luther, which explored the role of Luther’s pedagogical thought in his theological programme. Since the publication of Religious Education: Interpretation, Education, and Upbringing in 1987, Asheim's works have focused on ethics. The majority of Asheim's theological career has been passed at the MF Norwegian School of Theology. He was appointed to a senior lectureship there in 1963, a post he vacated to serve as director of the theological department at the Lutheran World Federation in Geneva from 1965 to 1970. In 1970 he returned to the School of Theology as Professor of Religious Education, and was appointed to the chair of Ethics in 1979, which he held until his retirement in 1994. He is widely acknowledged as a prominent voice amongst the Norwegian theologians of the late twentieth century, serving in retirement as a Senior Researcher at the Research Council of Norway (1994-1997) and as the inaugural chairman of the Norwegian Church Doctrinal Commission (1987-1991). He has been a member of the Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters since 1980, and was elected to the Royal Norwegian Society of Sciences and Letters in 1995. He married Tora Raastad in 1957. They reside at Hosle."

He joined the Libyan Ministry of Foreign Affairs in 1975. In January 2009, Dabbashi became the deputy Permanent Representative of Libya to the United Nations in New York. In March 2009, he served a term as the President of the United Nations Security Council. In February 2011, Dabbashi announced that he and the other members of Libya's UN mission were calling on Gaddafi to resign and that crimes against humanity and war crimes had been committed in Libya by the regime. In November 2011, after the fall of Gaddafi's government, it was reported that Dabbashi would be appointed as Libya's foreign minister by the National Transitional Council, but the reports proved incorrect when Ashour Bin Khayal was appointed to the position."

  "text" : "Ioan Dragomir (October 11, 1905—April 25, 1985) was a Romanian bishop of the Greek-Catholic Church. Born into a peasant family in Ariniș, Maramureş County, he attended high school in Zalău and Baia Mare. He then studied theology in Gherla, remaining there several years as a teacher. After his ordination, he was a parish priest from 1932 to 1934 in Coştiui, Hoteni and Ocna Şugatag. He left to study theology at Strasbourg but returned early due to ill health. After recovering, he finished his studies in Rome, becoming a doctor of theology. He was named archpriest of Satu Mare and also canon at the Baia Mare cathedral. Despite experiencing persecution, he led an active religious life during the period when Northern Transylvania was ceded to Hungary. Following the area's return to Romania, he helped reopen Romanian schools and set up curricula. In 1948, the new Communist regime outlawed his church and he spent time hidden in a barn attic in his native village. One night, dressed as a peasant, he went to the Ulmeni station and boarded a train for Bucharest, paying a villager who recognized him to keep quiet. He lived hidden at the nunciature and in 1950 was consecrated bishop by Gerald Patrick O'Hara. Shortly thereafter he left, since relations with the Vatican were severed, and Dragomir was arrested, sentenced to prison and subjected to various repressive measures. Released in 1964, he returned to Ariniş, where he had been presumed dead, and resumed his duties. Near the end of his life, gravely ill and influenced by others, he consecrated three bishops on his own, without discussion with other bishops or Vatican approval. He died in Bucharest and was buried alongside his parents in Ariniş. The funeral took place during a period of comparatively relaxed persecution, and was attended by bishops Alexandru Todea, Ioan Chertes and Ioan Ploscaru."

The latter was performed in secret shortly after the new Communist regime outlawed the church and arrested his predecessor, Ioan Bălan. Himself arrested in August 1949, he spent a number of years in prison, including at Sighet. After the collapse of the regime in 1989 and the church's legalization, he was the first Greek-Catholic bishop to officiate at a mass. This took place in January 1990, with the Romanian Orthodox Banat Metropolitan Nicolae Corneanu quickly agreeing to restore the Greek-Catholic churches in his province to their former owners. He retired in 1996."

  "text" : "Isaac Mayo was a junior surfman in the United States Life-Saving Service, one of the agencies later amalgamated into the United States Coast Guard.On April 4, 1879, he led multiple and eventually successful efforts to rescue seamen stranded in an offshore wreck at the height of a violent storm. The schooner Sarah J. Fort was wrecked on a sandbank just off Cape Cod.Initial attempts to row a rescue boat out to the wrecked and disintegrating schooner failed, with two boatmen lost overboard.By the time the tide had gone out the initial rescue crew was exhausted, and Mayo was part of a second boat crew. The boat was swamped and wrecked. Mayo rallied and led a third rescue attempt in a smaller rescue boat that was ultimately successful at rescuing the last four survivors of the schooner's crew. To honor his bravery and leadership, the Life-Saving Service honored Mayo with a Gold Lifesaving Medal.The Humane Society of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts awarded Mayo and the rest of the rescue boat's crew Silver Medals.As the captain of the rescue boat, Mayo was also awarded what the Humane Society called a \"Diploma.\" In 1879 Mayo, his wife and grandson, moved to North Dakota, where they took up farming."

He did his graduate work at the University of Kentucky and Northwestern University's School of Medicine. Millman's work with Baruch Blumberg helped lead to the creation of a test to detect hepatitis B. The test allowed blood banks to identify the hepatitis B virus in the blood of potential donors, thereby preventing the spread of the virus. Later research by the team led to a vaccine that is now commonly given to neonates (newborns). Millman and Blumberg found that the blood of individuals who carried the hepatitis B virus contained particles of the outside coating of the virus. The coating, hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), is not infectious; however, HBsAG can provoke an immune response. In order to develop a vaccine, Millman and Blumberg developed a method of detaching the coatings from the virus."

In his Ph.D. thesis, he completely classified all (more than 100 topologically different) possible flows of the generalized Lotka–Volterra dynamics (generalized Lotka–Volterra equation) on the plane, employing equivalence of this dynamics to the 3-type replicator equation. In “Non-cooperative two-person games in biology: a classification” (1986) and his book jointly authored with B. M. Pötscher (Game theoretic foundations of evolutionary stability, Springer 1989), he popularized the field of evolutionary game theory which at that time received most attention within Theoretical Biology, among researchers in Economics and Social Sciences. Around the turn of the millennium, he coined, together with his co-authors, the now widely used terms \"Standard Quadratic Optimization\" and \"Copositive Optimization\" or \"Copositive Programming\". While the further deals with the simplest problem class in non-linear optimization with an NP-hard complexity, copositive optimization allows a conic reformulation of these hard problems as a linear optimization problem over a closed convex cone of symmetric matrices, a so-called conic optimization problem. In this type of problems, the full extent of complexity is put into the cone constraint, while structural constraints and also the objective function are linear and therefore easy to handle."

He was a specialist in continuum mechanics and the theory of elasticity. He was born in the city of Starodub, Bryansk Oblast, Russia Vorovich attended Moscow State University to study mathematics where he achieved outstanding levels in his first year. He later became one of a group of specialists who were able to achieve a crossover between mechanical engineering and mathematics, expressing and posing mechanical problems in mathematical form, solving the problems mathematically and still maintaining an engineer’s understanding of the results. Vorovich graduated from the Zhukovsky Air Force Engineering Academy in 1944. His main works deal with mathematical problems of continuum mechanics, the nonlinear theory of shells, problems of stress concentration and thick plates, and mixed problems in the theory of elasticity about which he wrote or co-authored several books. He was awarded the Order of the Badge of Honor. In 1971, Vorovich founded the Research Institute of Mechanics and Applied Mathematics at Rostov State University, Rostov-on-Don, now part of the Southern Federal University, Russia."

Originally from Ukraine, Vovkovinskiy moved to Rochester, Minnesota in 1989 (at the age of seven) to be treated at the Mayo Clinic. At that time he was already about 6 feet tall and weighed over 200 pounds. Most recently, he has acted in commercials and films, notably the 2011 comedy film Hall Pass, and also became well known for wearing a T-shirt that read \"World's Biggest Obama Supporter\". He is also the first tallest living person from two different countries. In September 2012, a story on Igor on the Australian version of 60 Minutes erroneously billed him to be over 243 cm (8 ft 0 in) tall. In 2013, Vovkovinskiy was part of Ukraine's stage performance at the Eurovision Song Contest 2013. Vovkovinskiy's height has been attributed to having a tumor pressing on his pituitary gland, causing his body to have released excessive amounts of growth hormone."

  "text" : "Ioan Duma (November 5, 1896 — July 16, 1981) was a Romanian cleric and a titular bishop of the Roman Catholic Church. Born in Valea Mare, Bacău County, he studied at the Franciscan seminary in Hălăucești and in Rome. Ordained there in 1924, he returned to Romania to serve in the parishes at Săbăoani and Hălăuceşti, also teaching at the seminary in the latter place, and officiating at Franciscan convents in Transylvania in 1944. In 1948, nuncio Gerald Patrick O'Hara consecrated him bishop in secret, without the approval of the new communist authorities. For the next two years, he undertook activities against the regime, and was arrested in 1951 by the Securitate secret police. Sentenced to four years' imprisonment for \"spying on behalf of the Vatican\", he was released when his term expired in 1955 and forced to live and work as a parish priest first in Iaşi, then in Mihail Kogălniceanu, Constanţa County. In 1957, he was nearly arrested again, an order to the effect having been signed by Interior Minister Alexandru Drăghici. A year later, he was investigated after attending his mother's funeral near his native village, his personal papers confiscated. In 1960, wishing to isolate and watch him more closely, the Securitate sent him to live at Târgu Jiu. In 1971, he was allowed to visit Pope Paul VI in Rome. He was no longer under supervision after 1975, as the Securitate considered the aged and ill prelate no longer posed a threat. He died in Târgu Jiu and was buried in Valea Mare."

In retribution, the caliph Al-Mutawakkil sent an expedition against him led by Bugha al-Kabir (also known in Georgia as Bugha the Turk), assisted by the Georgian noble Bagrationi family. In 853, they burnt and sacked Tbilisi, and killed the emir."

In about 1562 at Catherine's instigation, she became the mistress of Louis, Prince of Condé, brother of King Antoine of Navarre and one of the leading Huguenots in France. Two years later when Isabelle created a scandal by giving birth to his son whilst the court was on a royal progress, she was banished to a convent. She later married wealthy Tuscan banker Scipion Sardini, a favoured protégé of Catherine de' Medici."

His parents joined The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) in 1855, and his father baptized a few hundred people into the church over the next few years. His father was put in prison on multiple occasions for these actions as they were regarded as an affront to the official Lutheran Church of Norway. Thoresen migrated with his family to Utah Territory in 1863 and settled in Hyrum. From 1876 to 1878, he was a missionary of the LDS Church in Sweden and Denmark. Over the years, Thoresen served as mayor of Hyrum and as a county prosecutor. He was a delegate to Utah's 1882, 1887 and 1895 Constitutional Conventions. Thoresen was elected as a Democrat to the state legislature and was heavily involved in promoting the Democratic Party in the state."

She was daughter of Francisco Barreto, Portuguese governor of India, and married Alvaro de Mendaña, Spanish navigator, patron of several expeditions to the Pacific Ocean, and discoverer of the Solomon Islands and the Marquesas Islands. Isabel accompanied him on his last expedition from Peru to the Pacific. In the Santa Cruz Islands, she replaced Mendaña and her brother, Lorenzo Barreto, as Adelantada and Governor after their death. She and the main pilot Pedro Fernández de Quirós arrived at Manila, in the Philippines, with the 100 survivors of the expedition in the only remaining ship (at the beginning 378 men and women in four ships), after a terrible voyage of twelve weeks from the settlement of Santa Cruz (Nendö). Doña Isabel was honoured in Manila, and Quirós was commended for his service; with both absolved of any responsibility for the results of the expedition. Isabel, accused of cruelty by the crew, demonstrated a strong personality with great leadership and great determination. She had an uncompromising attitude and managed to maintain severe discipline of the crew of tough and adventurous men, always willing to conspire and mutiny. (The story is told in The Islands of Unwisdom, an historic novel by Robert Graves.) She remarried to general Fernando de Castro, again crossing the Pacific Ocean to Mexico, and then traveling to Argentina, where they lived for several years, before returning to Peru. It is said that Isabel crossed the Atlantic Ocean for the last time to Spain to defend her rights over the Solomon Islands, because the King had granted the right to colonize the islands to Pedro Fernández de Quirós. She may be buried in Castrovirreyna (Peru) or in Galicia (Spain), in 1612.

In the Battle of Metaxas Line (April 6–9, 1941), the numerically and technically superior German Army invaded Greece from the Bulgarian border. However, the Greek fortifications at Nymfaia, near Komotini were able to provide a two-day resistance against enemy attacks. After the battle, the retreating Greek soldiers in Western Thrace were ordered by their headquarters to move across the Evros river to Turkey. General Zisis found this turn of events too humiliating and preferred to commit suicide, while his soldiers were ordered disarmed and interned by the Turks."

  "text" : "Ivan Milton Brown (10 November 1922 – 19 May 1977) was an Australian politician. He was a Liberal Party of Australia member of the Legislative Assembly of Queensland from May 1976 until his sudden death in May 1977. Brown was born in Dromana, Victoria. He served in World War II, serving in the Middle East and South Pacific from 1940 until 1945 with the 2/7th Australian Infantry Battalion. He was an electorical wholesaler and distributor and manufacturer's agent before entering politics. Brown was a member of the Liberal Party's state executive and the party's chairman in the federal seat of Lilley from 1973 to 1975, and was campaign director for a number of local, state and federal election campaigns. He entered the Legislative Assembly in a heavily contested 1976 by-election for the seat of Clayfield, following the retirement of John Murray. Clayfield was normally a safe Liberal seat, but with growing internal tensions in the conservative coalition, Brown faced a concerted challenge from the National Country Party, who nominated their high-profile state secretary, Mike Evans. In a campaign described as \"probably the most bitter and intense in recent political history in this state\", the Labor candidate finished first, Brown second, and Evans third, with Brown elected on Evans' preferences. Brown served for only eleven months before dying suddenly in office in May 1977. A second by-election was not held due to the proximity of the 1977 state election, when the Clayfield seat was abolished in a redistribution."

  "text" : "Ibrahim Mogra is an imam from Leicester and Assistant Secretary General of the Muslim Council of Britain. Mogra was born in 1965 in Malawi into a family of Gujarati Indian origin and emigrated to the UK at the age of 18 to study and settle. He was educated at Darul Uloom Bury, Holcombe, Greater Manchester; Al-Azhar University, Cairo; and the School of Oriental and African Studies, London. He is the founder and Principal of Khazinatul-`Ilm, Madaris of Arabic and Muslim Life Studies, in Leicester. In 2000, he contributed to BBC Radio 2's Faith in The Nation examination of the afterlife amongst the main religious faiths. He has been a panelist on The Big Questions, a faith and ethics television programme broadcast live on BBC One. Mogra believes that for British Muslims \"our loyalty to Britain must be unquestionable\". Mogra has been a representative for Jewish-Muslim relations appreciating the similarities of communities governed by a code of law and ethics (Torah and Qur'an) and religious festivals and holy days. Asked to choose a favourite film for The Clerics' Choice in The Daily Telegraph, Mogra picked The Message, \"you see through the eyes of the camera, as the Messenger would have seen it\". He has worked closely with Abu Eesa Niamatullah, Strategic Director of the 1st Ethical Charitable Trust. On 7 April 2013, Mogra took part in an interview on BBC Radio 4, condemning the men at the centre of the Rochdale sex trafficking scandal. He said that sexual grooming of non-Muslim girls by Muslim gangs was an abhorrent behaviour that was unacceptable regardless of race or religion. He expressed that as some of the perpetrators happened to be from a Muslim background, it was the duty of the entire Muslim community to condemn their actions. However he also cautioned that the paedophile scandal should be seen purely as criminal behaviour, warning that using labels of race and religion could \"drive the problem deeper underground\". Mogra also said that the Muslim Council was also working with different groups such as the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children, police and other Muslim groups to speak out against such crimes and assist in tackling the problem."

  "text" : "Colonel Ian S. Fraser is a leading producer of large scale military tattoos and events in Canada and overseas. Born in 1932, Fraser served in the Canadian Army and Canadian Forces from 1952 to 1983, retiring with the rank of Colonel, having had regimental service with The Black Watch (Royal Highland Regiment) of Canada, The Royal Canadian Regiment (RCR) and the Canadian Airborne Regiment. Fraser was Commanding Officer of 2RCR, the Canadian School of Infantry and the Canadian Airborne Regiment, and during his military career served in Canada, Germany, India and Cyprus. Fraser is also a graduate of the Indian Defence Services Staff College and the Canadian National Defence College. After producing a small scale Tattoo in the late 1950s, in 1962 Fraser was recruited as the Producer/Director of the Canadian Tattoo for the Seattle World’s Fair. In 1967 he was then chosen to write, produce and direct the Canadian Armed Forces Centennial Tattoo 1967. The Centennial Tattoo remains the world's largest ever touring production, touring across Canada from April to November 1967, and presented in 44 locations covering every Canadian province. In 1979 Fraser produced and directed the first Nova Scotia Tattoo, to mark the first International Gathering of the Clans outside Scotland. The event was attended and opened by Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother. The Nova Scotia Tattoo has since been held annually, becoming known as the Royal Nova Scotia International Tattoo, following the royal designation bestowed upon the event in 2006 by Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II on the occasion of the 80th birthday. Fraser remained producer / director of this, now the world's largest annual indoor show, until 2007, when he passed the role of Producer on to CEO Ann Montague. Fraser remains Artistic Director of the show. In addition to his work in Nova Scotia, Fraser has acted as a consultant for a variety of additional productions in Canada, Australia, South Africa, the United States and Europe, producing and directing over 1000 shows throughout his career. Fraser has also written plays for the Canadian Broadcasting Company (CBC), authored a number of books, and been the recipient of numerous awards including the Order of Military Merit, the Canadian Forces Decoration and the Order of Nova Scotia. In 2001 Fraser was granted a Doctor of Civil Laws, Honoris Causa, from Acadia University."
