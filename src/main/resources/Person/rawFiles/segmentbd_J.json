  "text" : "James Harvey D'Egville (ca. 1770 – ca. 1836) was an English dancer and choreographer. James' father Pierre D'Egville was ballet master at Drury Lane and Sadler's Wells Theatres. His other son George D'Egville was also a dancer. James D'Egville performed at the Paris Opera from 1784 to 1785. Back in England, in June 1786, he danced in The Nosegay at the Haymarket Theatre with Maria Theresa Kemble in the presence of the Royal Family. On 7 July he appeared in a ballet entitled Jamie's Return with Kemble and his brother George. It was well received which inspired an artist named Miller to do a painting depicting the three of them. Between 1799 and 1809 he was choreographer at the King's Theatre, now Her Majesty's Theatre where he had danced as a child in 1783. One of his pupils was Mary Ann Dyke who became tragedienne Mary Ann Duff. In 1827, the London Magazine published an article decrying the fact that D'Egville had won a libel suit against The Spirit of the Age newspaper for writing about his alleged association with the assassin of Princess Lambelle while he was in France in 1792. It annoyed the magazine immensely that simply writing that someone had said something libellous was grounds to win damages against a periodical. The magazine also had snide things to say about D'Egville's ballets. They wrote of him, \"the gentleman who deserves the thanks of all the saints on earth, for having cured the young men of the present day of the sinful taste for ballets.\""

  "text" : "John Stewart Wynne (aka John Wynne) is an American author of novels, short stories and poetry, as well as a Grammy-nominated producer of spoken word recordings. His writing often depicts characters in extremis, outsiders adrift in a conformist landscape, in plots that juxtapose the surreal and naturalistic. He has been hailed as the heir apparent to the tradition of “outsider art” exemplified by Tennessee Williams, Carson McCullers and Truman Capote. Wynne’s writing has been praised for its audacious originality, its beautiful imagery, the astute asides and wry observations of his characters, and his highly charged but often darkly comic mise-en-scènes. Wynne’s first published fiction was the 1978 short story The Sighting, where flying saucers and Bela Lugosi rub up against an archetypal 1950s drive-in while counterpointing the blossoming relationship of two teen-age boys. Gordon Montador in The Body Politic enthused: \"There is nothing else quite like it, for no other writer has experimented with gay experience in the context of our adolescence in straight America in such a direct, sensual and imaginative manner.\" The Sighting was further praised by Hubert Selby Jr. 1980 Prix Goncourt winner Yves Navarre, Rita Mae Brown, James Purdy and Charles Palliser. The story was selected by Ian Young as one of the seminal works of gay literature in his The Male Homosexual in Literature: A Bibliography. Wynne’s first novel Crime Wave details the unexpected love affair between a photojournalist (Jake Adams) and a woman (Renee Cloverman) living in a Manhattan brothel. Jake attempts to make Renee respectable by moving her into the country with his aunt’s family where her presence turns out to be a risk not only for her but for them as well. It was praised by author Barbara Trapido in The Spectator as a “disturbing, well-written and impressive work whose genre is Manhattan lumpen Gothic...the book has a terrible and compelling beauty.” Author Jenny Uglow in The Times Literary Supplement wrote “Crime Wave is about personal and social sado-masochism. The author’s challenging aim is to show there is no such thing as ‘mindless violence’, whether directed towards the self or towards others. Each aggressive act is the result of a long cycle of action and reaction, continued through generations. Crime Wave is an ambitious first novel.” Wynne’s short story collection The Other World was hailed as “one of the best books of the decade” by The James White Review. Peopled with circus performers, sociopaths, cross dressing teenagers and God-fearing families, these stories have a hallucinatory edge that makes the everyday seem like another world. Details wrote, “Wynne’s prose is chiseled and precise. And in pages that tremble with beauty, Wynne gracefully reveals the darker side of human possibilities.”. Booklist called it “startling, outrageous, frightening and sometimes even funny.\" National Book Award-winner Paul Monette wrote, “With so much tepid and sentimental fiction coming out, Wynne’s stories are like a plunge in cold water with a near-Brechtian intensity of focus and an infallible ear for dialogue, Wynne casts a laser eye on the things we say, so different from what we mean. A book to handle with asbestos gloves, but well worth the walk through fire.” Lambda Award-winner Rebecca Brown called it “an incredibly powerful book.” Wynne’s other writing has appeared in The Paris Review, The American Poetry Review, Christopher Street and High Risk 2, among other publications. Wynne has also produced and directed over one hundred audio books, including The Phantom of the Opera performed by F. Murray Abraham, William Styron reading his Darkness Visible (memoir), Christopher Reeve performing F. Scott Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby and John F. Kennedy, Jr. reading his father’s Pulitzer Prize-winning book Profiles in Courage. The latter was nominated for the 1991 Grammy Award as Best Spoken Word Album. Wynne himself was nominated for the Grammy Award in 1995 as producer of Best Spoken Word Album for Children for The Magic School Bus: Fun with Sound, featuring Lily Tomlin. In 1995 Wynne authored the first popular guide to spoken word recordings, The Listener's Guide to Audio Books. Magnus Books published The Red Shoes, a new novel by John Stewart Wynne, in July 2013.  In 2014 The Red Shoes was nominated for a Lambda Literary Award in the Best Gay General Fiction category."

  "text" : "John S. Carter, Jr. (June 14, 1945 – May 10, 2011), better known as simply Carter, was an American music producer, writer, arranger, instrumentalist, and A&R man. Carter was born the son of an oil wildcatter in East St. Louis, Illinois. His music career began in 1967 when he co-wrote \"That Acapulco Gold\" (a #70 hit on the Billboard Hot 100 chart) with Tim Gilbert of The Rainy Daze. Also with Gilbert, he co-wrote the lyrics to \"Incense and Peppermints\" by the Strawberry Alarm Clock.He first worked for Atlantic Records and was recruited to the A&R department of Capitol Records. There he worked with Bob Seger (fostering his hit album Night Moves) and the Steve Miller Band during the periods of their commercial breakthroughs. He also signed Sammy Hagar, Bob Welch and The Motels to Capitol, and co-wrote and produced some of their early output. Carter is credited with relaunching the career of Tina Turner in the 1980s. In 1983, despite opposition from within Capitol, Carter signed Turner and supported her throughout the recording of her first Capitol album, Private Dancer -- an album that ultimately involved eight different producers. Though many producers contributed to the album, it was Carter who produced the title song. The album went on to sell more than 20 million copies and made Turner a global superstar. He died of cancer on May 10, 2011 in Palm Springs, California."

He was ordained a deacon in 1854, and a priest in 1855 (by John Graham, Bishop of Chester). Following periods as curate at Doddleston in Cheshire and Holy Trinity, Manchester, Hughes-Games was vice-principal of York Training College from 1859 to 1861 then headmaster of the Liverpool Institute until 1865. He was principal of King William's College in the Isle of Man for the twenty years (1866–1886); and archdeacon of the island from then until 1894 when he became vicar of Holy Trinity, Hull. Hughes-Games married Mary Helena Yates on 24 December 1859; they had ten children, several of his sons attending King William's College. His eldest son, Joshua Hughes Wynn Hughes-Games (1860-1904) followed his father as a clergyman, serving as vicar at St Matthew's, Birmingham; Birling, Kent; and Birkenhead, as did his second son, Stephen Herbert Wynn Hughes-Games (1862-1923), chaplain to the Bishop of Sodor and Man, diocesan inspector of schools, and principal of Bishop Wilson Theological College, Isle of Man, as well as curate in several places. A younger son, Cyril Tomlinson Wynn Hughes-Games (1868-1933), was a barrister, Vicar-General of the diocese of Sodor and Man, and a member of the legislative council of the Isle of Man. His youngest son, Harold James Wynn Hughes-Games (1872-1954), taught at King William's College, and later at the Royal Naval College, Osborne, Isle of Wight, and that at Dartmouth.

He supported the Royalist cause in the English Civil War. Whistler was the son of Hugh Whistler of Milton Parva, Oxfordshire. He matriculated at Trinity College, Oxford on 14 October 1597 aged 17 and was awarded BA on 17 February 1601. He entered Gray's Inn on 4 May 1601 and was called to the bar in 1611. In 1622 he was made deputy recorder of Oxford to Thomas Wentworth. In 1624, Whistler was elected Member of Parliament for Oxford. He was re-elected MP for Oxford in 1625, 1626 and 1628 and sat until 1629 when King Charles decided to rule without parliament for eleven years. He succeeded Wentworth as recorder of Oxford on his death in 1628. In 1640 Whistler became treasurer of his Inn. He was elected MP for Oxford in April 1640 for the Short Parliament and again in November 1640 for the Long Parliament. He supported the King and was disabled from sitting, probably in January 1644."

  "text" : "John Nixon (1588 - 14 April 1662) was an English politician who sat in the House of Commons from 1646 to 1653. Nixon was the son of William Nixon, a husbandman of Blechington and his wife Joan Silvester. He became a merchant at Oxford and acquired a considerable fortune. On 2 October 1622 he was elected on to the Common Council, and in 1623 became bailiff. He was admitted a freeman on 3 February 1625  and in 1627 was elected senior bailiff. He became mayor of Oxford in 1636. In April 1638 he was elected an Alderman. As a zealous puritan, he was a witness against Archbishop Laud at his trial. Although he was a prominent Parliamentarian, in 1642 he contributed four pounds of powder and two pieces of match to a general royalist fund. However, in 1643 he fled from Oxford when the King was on his way and the then mayor on the advice of the king recommended that he and other aldermen and councillors who had left the city should be disfranchised, forfeit the freedom of the City, and be deprived of any offices they held in the City. In June 1646, five days after the Royalist troops began evacuating Oxford, the act of disenfranchisement was repealed and Nixon was restored to his freedom and his place on the council. He was elected mayor of Oxford again in 1646. In December 1646, Nixon was elected Member of Parliament for Oxford as a recruiter to the Long Parliament. In October1647, a Parliamentary Order of 4 October demanded “the Continuance of the old Mayor and Bayliffes in theire places until further order”, and Nixon continued as Mayor in place of the mayor chosen for 1647. He was a commissioner for assessment for Oxford in 1649 and was appointed one of the City Coroners in 1653. He was mayor of Oxford for the third time in 1654. In 1658, Nixon founded a free school for the sons of freemen. It opened at Guildhall Yard in 1659, and survived for 235 years until 1894. In January 1659 Nixon stood for parliament again but was unsuccessful. He was appointed commissioner for assessment for Oxford in 1660. In May 1661 he was reported to be unable to do the work of a Commissioner of Barges \"owing to his weakness of body\", but in August he took part in the procession that went out to meet Charles II, wearing a scarlet gown and tippet. Nixon died in 1662 and was buried on 17 April at St Mary's Church with the following epitaph on his monument. John Nixon of this Citty Alderman Ended that race he 73 yeares ran In April 62. no merits he Owned bvt Christs yet by its frvit the tree Is to be knowne.

  "text" : "John Neylon Molony (born 15 April 1927) is an Australian historian, academic and author. He is an Emeritus Professor of History at the Australian National University (ANU). Molony's long academic career with the ANU began in 1964, when he was employed as a Research Assistant in Medieval History in the School of Social Science. He was to go on to become Head of the Department of History and to hold the Manning Clark Chair of Australian History from 1982 until his retirement from the University in 1990. On his retirement, the ANU appointed Molony as an Emeritus Professor of History. Following his retirement from the ANU in 1990, Molony was appointed to the Keith Cameron Professorship of Australian History at University College Dublin. He held this position until 1993. In 1993, on his return to Australia, Molony was appointed to the Foundation Research Professorship in History at the Australian Catholic University in Canberra. He left the University in July 1996. During the course of his career, Molony has published a number of scholarly works on subjects as diverse as the encyclical of Pope Leo XIII and Ned Kelly to the bicentennial history of Australia, as well as numerous newspaper and journal articles, chapters in books and literary reviews. Out of all of his published works, Molony has said that he believes his 2000 book The Native-Born: The First White Australians will be judged as his most significant original contribution to the writing of Australian history, stating \"I say this because the native-born had never been given the serious consideration they deserve for their contribution to the making of our nation. More than any other element, including the convict element, they made us what we in large measure remain today.\""

From 2001 to 2006, he served as Executive Director for France at the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, while doing financial consulting for the French Embassy in London. From 2006 to 2011, he was Second Deputy Governor of the Banque de France, a member of the Board of Directors of the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) and a member of the Financial Stability Forum. He is also deputy at the G7 and G20 and member of the OECD workgroup devoted to economic and financial policy (WP3). Since 2012, Jean-Pierre Landau participates as jury member for the Prize for Conflict Prevention awarded by the Fondation Chirac. In January 2014, Landau wrote a Financial Times opinion piece that was critical of Bitcoin, a digital currency. He suggested that for a currency to be successful it needs a central bank to decide on changes to the money supply. If the supply of a currency is too small it will not be sufficient for the needs of an economy. He contends that because the number of Bitcoin will reach a predetermined limit the supply will be insufficient to satisfy the demand."

  "text" : "Juan Pedro Laporte Molina (7 August 1945 – 22 January 2010) was a prominent Guatemalan archaeologist best known for his work on the ancient Maya civilization. He studied in the United States at the University of Arizona, in which he enrolled at the age of nineteen. After just one year he transferred to the Escuela Nacional de Antropología e Historia (\"National School of Anthropology and History\") in Mexico. He continued his studies at the Universidad Autónoma de México from 1972 to 1976, from which he graduated with a doctorate in archaeology. He worked as a research assistant at the Museo Nacional de Antropología in Mexico City from 1967 through to 1976. Laporte worked at various archaeological sites while he was in Mexico, including Tlatilco, Chichen Itza and Dainzú. He first began working as an archaeologist in Guatemala in the 1970s, and was the head of the School of History of the Universidad de San Carlos de Guatemala (USAC) for more than thirty years. He first entered USAC in 1977, soon after returning from Mexico. In 1974 he carried out investigations at the Maya archaeological site of Uaxactun in the northern Petén Department of Guatemala. Between 1974 and 1976 he carried out archaeological investigations in Antigua Guatemala, which has since been designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and around Lake Izabal. Juan Pedro Laporte died in January 2010 from a lung tumour. An obituary in Guatemala's Siglo Veintiuno newspaper described him as \"the father of Guatemalan archaeology\". He was one of the founding editors of the Simposio de Investigaciones Arqueológicas en Guatemala (\"Symposium of Archaeological Investigations in Guatemala\"), which has been published annually since 1987. His books include La organización territorial y política en el mundo Maya Clásico : el caso del sureste y centro-oeste de Petén, Guatemala and Bibliografía de la arqueología guatemalteca."

Eric Kohn of IndieWire criticized the inclusion of The Artist into awards that should recognize lesser known films. He suggested Hodge should have been given the recognition. Screen Junkies also included both cinematographers among three it named Best Cinematographers for 2012. John Anderson of Variety singles out Hodge for his menacing lighting and artful lensing. Anderson also rates Hodge as one of his \"10 to watch\". Hodge was able to master the one-of-a-kind camera designed and built by the director of the film, Evan Glodell. It combined vintage camera parts, bellows and Russian lenses, around a Silicon Imaging SI-2K Mini Digital Cinema camera. It required a chain of people to carry the MacIntosh computer and batteries necessary for the contraption to work. Hodge also appeared in the film as \"Man peeing in bathroom.\""

  "text" : "Jeremy Nevill Bamber (born 13 January 1961) was convicted in 1986 of the murder of his adoptive parents, adoptive sister and her six-year-old twin nephews. The shooting of the family, in August 1985 in Essex, England, came to be known as the White House Farm murders. Bamber is serving life imprisonment after being convicted by a 10–2 majority. Informed by the Home Secretary in 1994 that he would never be released, he is the only whole-life prisoner in the UK known to protest his innocence. Bamber was 25 years old when he was convicted. The prosecution argued successfully that, after carrying out the murders to secure a large inheritance, Bamber had placed the gun in his 28-year-old sister's hands to make it look like a murder–suicide. She had been diagnosed with schizophrenia, and for several weeks after the murders the police and media believed she was the killer. Arguing that he is the victim of a miscarriage of justice, Bamber has several times applied to have the conviction overturned or his sentence reduced. The Court of Appeal upheld the conviction in 1989. The Criminal Cases Review Commission (CCRC) referred the case back to the Court of Appeal in 2001, which upheld the conviction again in 2002. The CCRC rejected further applications from Bamber's lawyers in 2004 and 2012. In July 2013 the European Court of Human Rights ruled in Bamber's favour that there must be a possibility, for whole-life prisoners, of release and review. Bamber told The Guardian in 2011 that he has never contemplated the thought that he will not be released. He does not have the support of his extended family, who were involved in gathering the evidence that saw him convicted and who remain convinced of his guilt."

He is now the Institute’s Distinguished Fellow and also serves on its Board of Directors. Faux was educated at Queens College, George Washington University, and Harvard University. He is the author of The Servant Economy (Wiley, 2012), The Global Class War (Wiley, 2006), The Party’s Not Over (Basic Books, 1996) and co-author of Reclaiming America (M.E. Sharpe, 1996), Rebuilding America (Pantheon, 1984) and The Star-Spangled Hustle (Doubleday, 1972). The Global Class War was translated into Spanish and Arabic. In 2009, New York Times reporter John Harwood wrote: “’The distribution of income and opportunity is likely to dominate the next stage of American politics,’ Jeff Faux predicted in ‘The Global Class War’ in 2006. …Then last fall, the financial crisis shoved other concerns aside and began to vindicate Mr. Faux’s prediction.” Faux is also a contributing editor to Dissent Magazine and The American Prospect and serves on the Board of Directors of Campaign for America's Future. Faux has received a Carnegie Scholar Award from the Carnegie Corporation of New York, the Weinberg Award from Wayne State University, a fellowship at the Harvard Institute of Politics, and an honorary doctorate from the University of New England. Prior to starting the Economic Policy Institute, he was the co-director of the Center for Economic Alternatives. He is a former economist for the U.S. Departments of State, Commerce, and Labor, and former director of economic development for the U.S. Office of Economic Opportunity."

  "text" : "Jean-Henri Humbert (24 January 1887 – 20 October 1967) was a French botanist born in Paris. He studied physics, chemistry and natural sciences in Rennes and Paris, and following a scientific excursion to Madagascar, he worked as a university assistant at the faculty of Clermont-Ferrand (from 1913). In 1919 he was appointed to the chair of botany, subsequently teaching botany classes at the institute of chemistry and industrial technology (1920–22). In 1922 he relocated to Algiers, where he became chef de travaux to the faculty of sciences. In 1931 he succeeded Henri Lecomte (1856-1934) as chair of botany at the Muséum national d'histoire naturelle in Paris. Humbert was a member of the Académie des sciences d'outre-mer (1938) and the Société botanique de France, serving as its president from 1940 to 1944. He was also a member of the Institut de France and the Société d’Histoire Naturelle de l’Afrique du Nord. From 1951 to 1957 he was a member of the Académie des Sciences. He has a handful of botanical genera named after him, including Humbertiella from the tribe Hibisceae. He was an editor of the journal \"Flore de Madagascar et des Comores\" (Flora of Madagascar and the Comoros)."

  "text" : "John Bartlett (1784-1849) was a minister and co-founder of McLean Hospital and Massachusetts General Hospital, two of the first hospitals in the United States. John Bartlett was born in Concord, Massachusetts in 1784 as the fourth of twelve children and as a youth was greatly influenced by his local pastor, Dr. Ripley. After working with a relative in commerce in Maine, Bartlett returned to Massachusetts and graduated from Harvard College in 1805. Bartlett then studied theology for two years in Cambridge and then became chaplain of the Boston Almshouse, which cared for poor residents of Boston. Bartlett remained as a chaplain from 1807 to 1811 and during this period studied theology further under William Ellery Channing. Bartlett also studied medicine, although he never intended to be practicing physician, but thought the education useful in his work with the impoverished. After observing the conditions of the poor at the Almshouse, Bartlett visited the hospitals in New York and Philadelphia and researched the newest medical methods. Bartlett then organized two meetings of prominent physicians and wealthy benefactors, one meeting resulted in the founding of McLean Insane Hospital and the other resulted in the creation of Massachusetts General Hospital. In 1811 Bartlett was ordained as pastor of the Second Congregational Church in Marblehead, Massachusetts, where he held to a Unitarian theology. Also in 1811, Bartlett married, Rebecca Dublois, daughter of George and Sarah Dublois, and they eventually had six children together. He was an active member of the Marblehead Humane Society and Freemasons. Bartlett died in 1849 at age sixty-five after several personal tragedies."

  "text" : "Jamison Dean \"Jamey\" Newberg (born March 3, 1969) is a Dallas, Texas lawyer and sports writer who became fairly well known since the late 1990s as an expert multi-media commentator on the Texas Rangers baseball organization, with an emphasis on the subtleties of minor league player development and complex trade strategies. Newberg originally compiled his analysis and observations (which have come to be known as The Newberg Report) into a semi-regular email memo sent to a handful of like-minded fan recipients. As his readership increased, those insights were also posted to a blog. Since 1999 his commentary has been collected and published in an annual bound volume each winter. Newberg appears regularly on Dallas television and radio broadcasts discussing the Rangers, is a featured panelist on a regular Rangers-based podcast, and also contributes written material to the Rangers official online presence on MLB.com."

Of the three sisters, Jennie was the most famous and successful right up to her death. Their mother was Annie Yeamans (1835 – 1912), a well known character actress in the Victorian era stage. Her father was Edward Yeamans, a circus clown. The Yeamans family came from Australia and toured China, Japan and Java in traveling shows before arriving in San Francisco in 1865. After arriving in America, Edward Yeamans died in 1866 or '68.As an adult, Jennie appeared in a popular stage melodramas or musicals; one musical being Blue Jeans in 1890, which was later made into a 1917 silent film Blue Jeans starring Viola Dana. For a time Yeamans was married to impresario Charles B. Dillingham. Yeamans died of tuberculosis on 28 November 1906 at the Hotel Gerard in New York City where she and her mother Annie lived.

  "text" : "John Karidis (Born, Pittsburgh PA, 1958 - Died, New York, March 5, 2012) was an American mechanical engineer, inventor, and an Emeritus Distinguished Engineer at the IBM T.J. Watson Research Center. He graduated with BS, MS & PhD, (1976-1983) in Mechanical Engineering from Penn State University. John Karidis was an inventor with 83 U.S. patents granted to date. His list of patents  include various inventions on computer user interfaces, thermal solutions, printing devices, orthopedic devices, and computer memory systems. John Karidis was best known for the IBM ThinkPad Butterfly keyboard design. The unusual patented design had two jigsaw puzzle like interlocking pieces which were tucked in the laptop when the display lid was closed. Then, the keyboard would fold out horizontally to make a wider keyboard when the display lid was opened. The \"Butterfly\" laptop attracted much attention and became an instant classic when it was first introduced in 1995. It is being displayed in the permanent collection of the Museum of Modern Art in Manhattan(MoMA), New York. It has also been used by James Bond in the film GoldenEye. IBM did not continue the Butterfly keyboard after the ThinkPad 701 model. John Karidis told in a 2001 interview that \"The butterfly keyboard was no longer necessary, because people moved to larger displays. Where the butterfly approach makes sense is where you want the largest keyboard possible in combination with an 8-inch or 10-inch display.\". However, 17 years after its introduction to market, there are still calls for bringing the Butterfly keyboard back to netbooks which suffer from small keyboards. Another of John Karidis inventions was one of the world's fastest robotic probing systems. Called the \"Hummingbird minipositioner\". This robot can probe and test 40-100 contacts per second on very fine geometry multi-chip modules. The design is used as an exemplar of engineering and robotic discipline in courses at Johns Hopkins University, the University of Michigan, and McGill University. Penn State University has established the Dr. John P. Karidis Department Head’s Award for Research Achievement in Mechanical Engineering. The award recognizes mechanical engineering students who have made important contributions in advancing research in his or her selected areas of study."

During a confrontation between Christians and Muslims in Zongon Kataf, James Wuye lost his right arm, while Muslim Youth Councils Secretary General Muhammad Ashafa lost two cousins and his spiritual mentor. In 1995, the two former opponents decided to work together and build bridges between their respective communities. With this aim in view, they launched the Interfaith Mediation Center of the Muslim-Christian Dialogue, an organization with over 10,000 members providing interfaith training to young people in schools and universities, to women, religious leaders and politicians. The center has thus contributed to defusing tensions in the 2002 and 2004 clashes in Kaduna and Yelwa."

  "text" : "John Smith (1567–1640) was an English genealogical antiquary and politician who sat in the House of Commons from 1621 to 1622. Smith was the son of Thomas Smith of Hoby, Leicestershire and his wife Joan Alan, daughter of Richard Alan, citizen of Derby. He was educated at the free school, Derby and then went in 1584 to Callowden to wait on Thomas Berkeley, son and heir of Henry Berkeley, 7th Baron Berkeley. He studied under the same tutor, and he went up with the young lord to Magdalen College, Oxford, in 1589. In 1594 he was admitted to the Middle Temple, and two years later, having completed his studies there, returned to the Berkeley family as household steward. In 1597 he took the more lucrative and important office of steward of the hundred and liberty of Berkeley. About the same time he took up his residence at Nibley, Gloucestershire, where in time he acquired two adjacent manor-houses, \"adorned with gardens and groves and a large park well wooded.\" The Berkeleys were so generous to him that the family jester is said on one occasion to have tied Berkeley Castle to the church with twine \"to prevent the former from going to Nibley.\" As steward of the manor, Smith had charge of the muniment-room at the castle, and, devoted himself to studying the valuable material which had accumulated there over the centuries. He eventually wrote a history of the lives of the first twenty-one lords of Berkeley, from the Norman conquest down to 1628. In 1621, Smith was elected Member of Parliament for Midhurst but took little part in the increasingly contentious politics of the time. Smith died at Nibley in the autumn of 1640. Smith married firstly Grace, a native of Nibley, who died in 1609, without issue,. He married secondly on 9 January 1610 Mary Browning, daughter of John Browning of Cowley and by this marriage had five sons and three daughters. He is believed to be the great grandfather of the poet John Smith."

  "text" : "Sir John Smith Teasdale CBE (28 June 1881 – 2 July 1962) was an Australian wheat farmer and administrator. Teasdale was born at Alston, Cumbria, England to stonemason James Teasdale and Jane, née Maughan. He worked as a grain merchant before his migration to Western Australia in 1911, where he and a number of his brothers settled to farm in the Bruce Rock area. Although the Teasdales' initial efforts were devastated by a 1914 drought, John connected with the local farming community to canvass ways of improving drought resistance. Becoming more involved in the farming community, Teasdale was an executive member of the Farmers' and Settlers' Association in 1916 and in 1922 helped found the Wheat Pool of Western Australia, touring Great Britain and the United States to gather information on farming methods. He married Luita Christina Waldeck on 22 August 1929 in Perth. Teasdale, a Country Party member, successfully lobbied for the 1930 Farmers' Debts Adjustment Act; from 1932 to 1940 he was President of the Primary Producers' Association of Western Australia. He proposed a twenty per cent reduction in acreage for wheat producing countries in 1932, but opposed the Wheatgrowers' Union of Western Australia when it attempted to withhold wheat supply until a compulsory national pool was established. In 1933 Teasdale was a founding director of Co-operative Bank Handling Ltd, and in 1939 he was appointed to the Australian Wheat Board (AWB), chairing the 1947 Royal Commission on Wheat Marketing and Stabilisation. In 1950 he was appointed chairman of the AWB, a position he held until his death. During his chairmanship, Teasdale supported research into new wheat strains but was out-voted when he opposed selling wheat to China on extended credit. Appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1948 and knighted in 1951, Teasdale died in 1962 at Kew, having moved to Melbourne shortly after his appointment as AWB chairman."

He founded the largest independent church in Central Africa.The main gathering of the church occurred at Pentecost, at Maranke's village, lasting for seventeen days, and ending with communion.

  "text" : "Julius Caesar Strauss (July 1857 - 1924), known professionally as J. C. Strauss, was an American photographer who was known as an internationally renowned craftsman and the most famous photographer in St. Louis, Missouri, at the turn of the 20th century. Born in Cleveland, Ohio, this penniless son of a Bavarian-born tailor left home and sneaked into St. Louis in 1876. He opened a photo studio in 1879. By the 1890s, he had built a gallery. Although he was willing to experiment with different lighting and backgrounds, he insisted upon rigidly-posed portraits. Photographer Alfred Stieglitz from New York eventually over took the style and reputation of Strauss who continued to create pictures that looked more like paintings. From the time of the St. Louis World's Fair until his death, Strauss' studio was a local tourist attraction."

Lee's lesser known works include the paper The opacity of s-irregular verbs in Korean: Confronting Optimality Theory approaches (2011)  which was written in 2005, and later published in the Calgary Papers in Linguistics. Lee also presented the paper The distribution of Turkish articles: Implications for L2 English at the Linguistic Society of America 2006 Summer Meeting in East Lansing, Michigan."

  "text" : "Jean-Pierre Sylvestre de Grateloup (31 December 1782 – 25 August 1862) was a French physician and naturalist. He completed his medical studies at Montpellier and remained attached to the countryside of the southwest of France. In company with his childhood friend Jean-Marie Léon Dufour (1780–1865) and Dufour's friend Jean-Baptiste Bory de Saint-Vincent (1778–1846) he expressed his enthusiasm for botany specializing in the study of cryptogams, the ferns and other plants that reproduce through spores. Then the shells found in the region attracted his attention, in particular those from the Adour. He practiced medicine in the military hospitals at Dax, where from his graduation from Montpellier in 1807 he worked in the company of Jean Thore (1762–1823). Under the Bourbon Restoration he experienced setbacks in his career. After his marriage in 1822 he moved to Bordeaux. As a corresponding member of the Société linnéenne de Paris, the world's first \"Linnaean society\", he was made director of the natural history museum of Dax, which was founded on the collections of Jacques-François de Borda d'Oro (1718–1804). In addition to his own works he edited articles for the Annales générales de sciences physiques by Bory de Saint-Vincent, Auguste Drapiez (1778–1856) et Jean-Baptiste Van Mons (1765–1842). His Catalogue des mollusques terrestres et fluviatiles: vivants et fossiles, de la France continentale e insulaire, 1855, catalogued all the molluscs found in France, living and fossilized. The standard author abbreviation Gratel. is used to indicate this individual as the author when citing a botanical name."

His emphasis on the international dimension of the late-eighteenth and early-nineteenth-century revolutions was crystallized in the concepts of Atlantic history and 'occidental revolution'. In 1955 Godechot collaborated with the Yale historian Robert Roswell Palmer to present a joint paper on 'the problem of Atlantic history' at the 10th International Congress of Historical Sciences in Rome."

  "text" : "Jonathan R. Davis was an honorary captain of the Palmetto Regiment of Volunteers of South Carolina in the Mexican–American War and a gold rush prospector. On December 19, 1854, he single-handedly killed eleven armed outlaws at Rocky Canyon near Sacramento, California using two Colt revolvers and a Bowie knife. This episode became one of the deadliest small arms engagements in American history involving one man against multiple foes. Michael Trcic depicted the event in the sculpture \"One Man With Courage is a Majority\". He was educated at South Carolina College, where he was a member of the Euphradian Society. The unit, the Palmetto Regiment of Volunteers, was accepted into federal service in December 1846 and disbanded at the close of the war in June and July 1848. Davis is listed as a second lieutenant in Mexican War Veterans: A Complete Roster of the Regular and Volunteer Troops ... By William Hugh Robarts (1887) who notes that he was wounded in the Battle of Churubusco. He was not alone in being wounded since five of his brother officers died and another eight were wounded in leading the regiment that day. Among those who fell were Col. Pierce M. Butler (killed), Lt. Col. James P. Dickenson (mortally wounded), Adjutant 2nd Lt. James Cantey (severely wounded), Capt. Keith S. Moffat (wounded), Capt. William D. Desaussure (twice wounded), 1st Lt. James R. Clark (mortally wounded), 1st Lt. Kennedy G. Billings (severely wounded), 2nd Lt. Joseph Abney (severely wounded), 2nd Lt. David Adams (killed), 2nd Lt. Wilson R. Williams (killed), 2nd Lt. Sebastian Sumter (wounded), 2nd Lt. James W.

In 1898, he established the Regina Trading Company, Regina's first department store. Bole resigned his seat in the provincial assembly in 1915 to become Saskatchewan liquor commissioner; this post was eliminated when prohibition came into effect in the province the following year.

During the rule of Eduard Shevardnadze, Pirtskhalaishvili became Deputy Defense Minister under Vardiko Nadibaidze, but ultimately resigned because of differences with Nadibaidze over military reforms. After the dismissal of Nadibaidze in 1998, Major-General Pirtskhalaishvili was appointed Chief of the General Staff and promoted to the rank of lieutenant general. During his tenure, the United States launched the GTEP training program for the Georgian troops and Georgia deployed its contingent in Iraq. During the disputed parliamentary election in November 2003, eventually annulled by the Rose Revolution later that month, Pirtskhalaishvili ran, unsuccessfully, in the Lanchkhuti constituency on a ticket of pro-Shevardnadze election bloc For New Georgia."

  "text" : "John de Vesci, sometimes spelt Vescy, was a prominent 13th-century noble. He was the eldest son of William de Vesci and Agnes de Ferrers. He married firstly Mary of Lusignan and secondly Isabella de Beaumont. John died c. 1289. He succeeded to his father's titles and estates upon his father's death in Gascony in 1253. These included the barony of Alnwick and a large property in Northumberland and considerable estates in Yorkshire, including Malton. Due to being under age, King Henry III of England conferred the wardship of John's estates to a foreign kinsmen, which caused great offence to the de Vesci family. John sided with Simon de Montfort, 6th Earl of Leicester during the barons' rebellion against King Henry III, known as the Second Barons' War of 1263–64. He was summoned to the great parliament of January 1265, the first directly elected parliament in medieval Europe. During the battle of Evesham on 4 August 1265 he was wounded and taken prisoner. Released sometime afterwards he admitted to compound for his estates after the Dictum of Kenilworth. During 1267, he participated with some of the northern barons in another rising, however Prince Edward went north with an army and John was forced to submit. After being treated well by Edward, he became a devoted friend. John went with Edward on his crusade to Palestine between 1271 and 1272. He was one of the two barons who led Eleanor of Castile from the presence of her husband Edward, when he was operated upon for his poisoned wound. In 1273 he was made governor of Scarborough Castle. In 1275, John was part of an expedition against Guðrøðr Magnússon, who was leading an uprising on Mann, in an attempt to establish himself as king. The Chronicle of Mann and Chronicle of Lanercost indicate that a Scottish fleet made landfall at Ronaldsway, on 7 October. The Chronicle of Lanercost records that John de Vesci and other Scottish magnates arrayed their forces on St Michael's Isle, and sent forth an embassy offering Guðrøðr and his followers peace. Guðrøðr refused, and the following morning, before sunrise, both chronicles indicate that his forces were utterly defeated during the battle of Ronaldsway. According to the Chronicle of Mann, 537 rebels were slain by the Scots. John served in Wales in 1277. He married Mary of Lusignan in 1279, however Mary died very shortly afterwards. He married Isabella de Beaumont sometime afterwards and was granted by King Edward I of England lands in Northumberland and Kent, including Eltham. He became the king's secretary and counsellor, and was sent in February 1282 with Antony Bek to Aragon to negotiate a marriage between Alfonso, son of King Peter III of Aragon, and Edward's daughter Eleanor, which resulted in the signing of the contract as proxy at Huesca. He served in Wales in 1282. In June 1285 he was sent with two others to negotiate the marriage between Edward's daughter Elizabeth and John, son of Floris V, Count of Holland. John was given as a hostage by King Edward I to King James II of Aragon in 1288. He died in 1289, without issue, and was buried at Alnwick Abbey. His heart, was buried in 1290 with the hearts of Queen Eleanor and her eldest son, Alfonso, in the Dominican priory at Blackfriars. His brother William succeeded to his estates and his widow played a notable part in the reign of King Edward II of England, as a strong friend of the king and queen, procuring the advancement of her brothers."

  "text" : "John Arnold, widely known as John Arnold of Monmouthshire (c. 1635–1702), was a Welsh Protestant politician and Whig MP. He was one of the most prominent people in Monmouthshire in the late 17th century. A stark anti-Papist, he was a notable figure during the Popish plot and the suppression of Catholicism in the country. Arnold represented the constituencies around Monmouth (known as the Monmouth Boroughs) and Southwark in Parliament in the 1680s and 1690s. His strong anti-Papist beliefs and insurgences against Catholic priests made him an unpopular and controversial figure amongst his peers and in his native Monmouthshire. Amongst his associates were Titus Oates and Anthony Ashley Cooper, 1st Earl of Shaftesbury."

  "text" : "John Read, PhD, is a New Zealand psychologist and mental health researcher. He is Professor of Clinical Psychology in the University of Liverpool's Institute of Psychology, Health and Society. Read was formerly a clinical psychologist in the Department of Psychology at the University of Auckland. His research interests include: attitudes towards 'mental illness', psycho-social causes of psychosis, and the role of the pharmaceutical industry in psychology. Before joining the University in 1994, Read worked for twenty years as a manager of mental health services, working with people experiencing psychosis. He is the Editor of the journal Psychosis and is on the editorial boards of two other journals. He is also on the Executive Board of the International Society for the Psychological Treatments of Schizophrenia. Read is the editor of Models of Madness: Psychological, Social and Biological Approaches to Schizophrenia (Routledge, 2004) which has sold over 10,000 copies and been translated into Chinese, Russian, Spanish and Swedish. In 2010 he received the New Zealand Psychological Society’s Sir Thomas Hunter Award for ‘excellence in scholarship, research and professional achievement’. In 2010, Read and Richard Bentall co-authored a literature review on \"The effectiveness of electroconvulsive therapy\" (ECT). It examined placebo-controlled studies and concluded ECT had minimal benefits for people with depression and schizophrenia. The authors said \"given the strong evidence of persistent and, for some, permanent brain dysfunction, primarily evidenced in the form of retrograde and anterograde amnesia, and the evidence of a slight but significant increased risk of death, the cost-benefit analysis for ECT is so poor that its use cannot be scientifically justified\"."

He acquired the Lordship of Haastrecht in 1380 and Hagestein in 1382. When he inherited Arkel from his father in 1396, he became a member of the court council of the Count of Holland. During the reign of Albert I, the county suffered from a series of conflicts known as the Hook and Cod wars. John V sided with Albert I and the Cods. However, during a campaign in West Frisia, John V came into conflict with Albert's son, William VI, who sided with the Hooks. The murder of Aleid van Poelgeest may also have played a role in their animosity. Albert informed his father that John was no longer a faithful ally and John declared himself independent and refused to participate in further campaigns against the Frisians. This triggered the Arkel War, in which William VI conquered Arkel. John V lost his land and spent the years 1415-1426 in captivity. John V died in Leerdam in 1428. His son William inherited his claim on the Land of Arkel."

  "text" : "Juliusz Mieroszewski (Polish pronunciation: [ˈjuljuʂ mjɛrɔˈʂɛfskʲi]; February 2, 1906 – June 21, 1976) was a Polish journalist, publicist and political commentator. He wrote under the pseudonyms \"J. Calveley\" and \"Londyńczyk\" (Londoner). He was born in Kraków. In interwar Poland he was a co-editor of the \"Ilustrowany Kurier Codzienny\" (Illustrated Daily Courier), where his beat was German politics and policy. During World War II he escaped from Nazi occupied Poland and worked for publications of the Polish government in exile, \"Ku Wolnej Polsce\" (For a Free Poland), \"Orzeł Biały\" (The White Eagle), \"Parada\" (Parade). After the war, with Poland falling under communist rule, he decided to stay in Great Britain. He wrote columns for the emigre journal \"Wiadomości\" (News). Between 1950 and 1972 he was the chief editor of the \"English section\" of the influential Parisian emigre journal \"Kultura\". In the 1970s Mieroszewski was the closest collaborator of the journal's chief editor, Jerzy Giedroyc. While at the time Poland was an authoritarian communist state, controlled by the Soviet Union, Mieroszewski and Giedroyc, in the pages of the journal, sought to articulate a political program for what they envisioned as a future independent Polish state. While Mieroszewski was a dedicated socialist, he was strongly opposed to communism and the Soviet domination of Eastern Europe. A crucial, and at the time unique, consideration of the Kultura program was the Polish relationship with the national aspirations of Belarusians, Lithuanians and Ukrainians. Mieroszewski was also a translator - he translated George Orwell's 1984, as well as works of Bertrand Russell and Arnold Toynbee into Polish. He died in London in 1976."

He then went to London where he joined the Glasshouse church, an early Particular Baptist (Reformed Baptist) congregation. Myles then returned to Ilston in Wales, where he served as a minister from 1649 to 1662 and he served as a \"tryer\" for ministers under Oliver Cromwell's government. After the restoration of the monarchy and requirement that all ministers adhere to the Book of Common Prayer, Myles left England for the Plymouth Colony in the 1660s. Myles took the historic Ilston Book to North America with him, and it is now located at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island. In America Myles worked with the Congregationalist state church in Rehoboth, before his group was told to leave the town for their Baptist views, and Myles and his congregation (largely from Ilston, Wales) then founded the town of Swansea and First Baptist Church in Swansea. \"Swansea\" was named after a town in their homeland in Wales. Myles served as pastor for twenty years. During King Philip's War, Myles pastored the First Baptist Church in Boston while fleeing from the Indians."

His inheritance helped him attend Phillips Exeter Academy and Bowdoin College, from which he graduated in 1827. After Bowdoin, he moved to Bangor, Maine to study law under prominent area lawyer Allen Gilman. In 1833, he was a member of the Executive Council of Maine and from 1834 to 1838 he was a Land Agent for the state. In 1846, he was elected to the Maine State Senate and served as Senate President in 1847. He was re-elected in 1848 but resigned after unsuccessfully challenging incumbent Democrat John W. Dana his party's nomination for Governor. In 1849, Hodgdon was named Bank Commissioner and in 1853, he was offered the position of US consul in Rome by President Franklin Pierce, which he declined. In 1853, he left Maine for Dubuque, Iowa, where he became mayor in 1859."

  "text" : "Jan Ferdynand Nax (April 1736 – 19 January 1810) was an architect, economist, social reformer and adviser on the navigability and conservation of Poland's water resources. While he was born in Gdańsk, and was of German origin, Nax spent most of his life in Poland and was strongly assimilated into Polish society. As an economist, Nax based his thinking around the theory of mercantilism, which generally supported the development of a monetary-based economy instead of the system of servitude which then existed in Poland. He was a close adviser Poland's last king, Stanisław August Poniatowski, in the king's failed attempts reform which preceded the First Partition of Poland, among Russia, Prussia and Austria, in 1772. Nax supported the development of trade and production, stressed the need for reform in agriculture, and promoted enfranchisement of the peasant class. He was also an adviser on tax policy, and a supporter of protectionism in foreign trade. Also appointed as a royal architect by King Stanislaw (1774), Nax is associated with the design and construction, or reconstruction, of a number of aristocratic homes including the Małachowski Palace in Nałęczów, The Palace at Kurozwęki, The Palace at Szczekociny, The Palace at Nakło, The Palace at Śladków, and The Palace at Rusinów, all of which represent his neoclassical approach to architectural design. The Palace at Szczekociny is generally considered to be his most important contribution to Polish architecture of the late 18th century, and is notable for his introduction of Polish national symbols into the palace's artistic features, including the Polish eagle motif atop columns that adorn the structure. Nax conducted studies of Poland's major waterways, including the Pilica and Warta rivers, drafted a map of the Dniester River (1781); and wrote regulations for the Bug, Narew, Nida, Pilica and Wieprz tributaries. In 1784 Nax developed a map of Polish sources of salt."

He was at Southsea in 1782, and was an eye-witness of the foundering of the Royal George. He invented a plan for destroying the wreck, which was the same as one carried out by Colonel Pasley in 1839. He also invented the 'sunproof' for testing the soundness of guns, long in use in the royal arsenal; a 'gyn' called by his name, and a petard, of which there is a model in the Woolwich laboratory; a crane for descending mines; and a harpoon for taking whales (for the last two of which he received premiums from the Society of Arts); and an apparatus for rescuing shipwrecked mariners, said to be identical with that afterwards devised by Captain Manby. For this he received a premium from the Society of Arts of fifty guineas, and in 1815 the House of Commons voted £500 to his daughter (Mrs. Whitfield) in recognition of the same invention. In 1793 the Duke of Richmond gave him a commission as second-lieutenant in the artillery."

In 1769 he was Sheriff of the City of London with John Sawbridge, and together they opposed Sir James Eyre on the place of execution of convicted weavers. In the same year Townsend followed John Horne in breaking away from the supporters of John Wilkes, founding the Constitutional Society. In 1781 he presented a petition for electoral reform from the Tiverton activist Martin Dunsford. In 1782 Shelburne arranged for his election to Parliament for Calne. As a member he backed some calls for reform, but mainly supported William Pitt the Younger. Shortly before his death in office he had opposed the impeachment of Warren Hastings."

  "text" : "Juan Carlos Izpisua Belmonte (born 1960 in Hellín - Albacete) has been a professor in the Gene Expression Laboratories at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies in La Jolla, California since 1993. In 2004, he helped to establish the Center for Regenerative Medicine in Barcelona and was its Director between 2004 and January 13, 2014. While maintaining the lab on site at Salk, in 2012, Dr. Izpisua Belmonte joined other labs from Salk, Sanford-Burnham, La Jolla Institute for Allergy and Immunology, and UCSD, as the inaugural occupants of the Sanford Consortium for Regenerative Medicine in La Jolla. Izpisua graduated from the University of Valencia, Spain with a Bachelor’s degree in Pharmacy and Science. He then earned a Master’s degree in Pharmacology from the same university before moving on to complete his Ph.D. in Biochemistry and Pharmacology at the University of Bologna, Italy and the University of Valencia, Spain. He followed that with a stage as a postdoctoral fellow in different institutions, including the European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL), in Heidelberg, Germany and University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), Los Angeles, USA prior to moving to the Salk Institute in 1993. His work has been influential in our understanding of the cellular and molecular basis of how an organism with millions of cells develops from a single cell embryo after fertilization. These discoveries may have implications for disease treatment, as well as organ and tissue regeneration and aging. He is the lead author of a 2015 paper revealing a promising new approach to influence aging. Dr. Izpisua Belmonte has received several awards and honors over the years, including the William Clinton Presidential Award, the Pew Scholar Award, the Gold Medal of the Junta Castilla-La Mancha, and the Roger Guillemin Endowed Nobel Chair. A notable honor was the naming of a secondary school, Instituto Enseñanza Secundaria (IES) Izpisua Belmonte, in his hometown of Hellín, Albacete, Spain."

  "text" : "Julie Talen is a writer and experimental filmmaker best known for her work with multi-channel narrative. Her directorial debut, the digital feature, Pretend, premiered at the Lincoln Center’s New York Video Festival in 2003. The film uses an array of multiple frames and complex graphics to tell the story of a troubled family living in upstate New York. \"The collage of images evokes the memories, fantasies and fears of the characters, bridging the distance between the objective reality of what the camera sees and the inner worlds that are ordinarily left to actors to convey,’’ wrote A.O. Scott of The New York Times, who also called Pretend a “harrowing, dazzling feature.”  In Sixty Cameras Against the War (2004), Talen unearthed unexpected synchronicity among random digital videos taken in a massive but little-seen anti-war rally held in New York City on Feb 15, 2003, just days before the invasion of Iraq. The film was shown at the Whitney Museum of American Art among other locations. Talen has also written for such publications as the Village Voice, American Film and the Los Angeles Weekly, and was a contributing editor to Channels Magazine. She assistant-edited an award-winning Merchant/Ivory documentary and worked as a researcher and assistant producer on the original reality series, Unsolved Mysteries. Her studio screenwriting assignments began in 1991, on the strength of a spec script – A Simple Wedding – which was eventually sold to Douglas Wick at Columbia Pictures and was selected by the LA Reader as one of the ten best unproduced scripts of 1992. She has since written adaptations and original screenplays and worked with such directors as Gillian Armstrong, Paul Verhoeven and Robert Altman. She shared credit on the 1996 Paramount film Harriet the Spy starring Rosie O'Donnell and directed by fellow New Yorker Bronwyn Hughes. Talen graduated from Brown College and the Columbia University School of Journalism."

  "text" : "John Lloyd (3 September 1833 - 6 June 1915) was a Welsh-born barrister who became a prominent figure in the local government of London. The son of John Lloyd of Dinas, Brecon, he was educated at Bridgnorth Endowed School before attending St John's College, Oxford. He did not graduate, instead leaving Oxford to manage his family's estates in Breconshire, Monmouthshire and Herefordshire. In 1877 Lloyd moved to London, where he was called to the bar at the Middle Temple. In London he became involved in local government, and as secretary of the London Municipal Reform League campaigned for the creation of the London County Council. When the first elections to the county council were held in January 1889, he was elected as a Progressive Party councillor representing North Kensington. Re-elected in 1892, he was defeated in 1895 and failed to regain his council seat at subsequent elections. Lloyd took a great interest in the traditions and history of his native county. He amassed a collection of papers and documents which he used as the basis of three publications: Historical Memoranda of Breconshire (two volumes 1903 and 1904), The Great Forest of Brecknock (1905) and The Early History of the Old South Wales Ironworks (1906). He died at his home in Bayswater, London in 1915, aged 81. He was buried in Talachddu, Breconshire."

  "text" : "Jean-Michel Emmanuel Salanskis (born April 5, 1951 in Paris) is a French philosopher and mathematician, professor of science and philosophy at the University of Paris X Nanterre. Originally gaining a Diplôme d'études approfondies in pure mathematics he went on to study philosophy with Luis Puig and Jean-Francois Lyotard from 1974 to 1983. In 1986 he completed a doctoral dissertation on Le continu et le discret (the continuous and the discrete). He is an important interpreter of continental philosophers such as Jacques Derrida, Emmanuel Levinas, Edmund Husserl, Martin Heidegger, and Gilles Deleuze, and he has published widely in English and French. He has also written about Judaism and the philosophy of mathematics. In his book La gauche et l'égalité he argues that the left is structured by a “critique of power taking the form of a critique of man’s humiliation at the hands of transcendence\" (p. 22), and that it is therefore necessary \"to eliminate entirely the communist episode from the left,” for this episode partakes of the crushing of the people by one man who can “become the keystone of the world, restoring the attributes and the aura of royalty\" (p. 37). In his 2010 book Derrida, he presents the philosophy of Jacques Derrida in an accessible manner for the lay reader, showing how Derrida's work related to the fields of psychoanalysis, radical politics, and literature. In Les temps du sens he embarks on a project to devise a mathematical hermeneutics that can be applied to fields such as philosophy of science, cognitive sciences and philosophy of religion."

Bird may have killed as many as 46 people. Criminologist Eric W. Hickey, Ph.D, Director of Alliant International University's Center for Forensic Studies, wrote about how the Bird case challenges stereotypes of serial killers, who are mostly thought to be Caucasian males, whereas African American killers typically are associated with urban violence. Hickey wrote, \"Revelations that Jake Bird, a black man, had actually stalked and killed dozens of white women in the 1940s in dozens of states...continue[s] to challenge traditionally held profiles of serial killers.\""

Goodale received her BA and MA from Radcliffe College and later her PhD from the University of Pennsylvania and held teaching positions at Barnard College, the University of Pennsylvania, and the Darwin Institute of Technology. Goodale worked to bring attention and notability to the ethnographic research, dedicating her work and encouraging her students in the collection of facts and information on other cultures during a time when many felt the practice was outdated and ineffective."

His father, Moises, worked as a superintendent. Dicker took up Law studies in Kiev. He joined the Socialist-Revolutionary Party as a young man. He was jailed and imprisoned several times due to his political activism. He migrated to Switzerland in 1906, fleeing the Czarist repression in the Russian empire. He continued his Law studies in his new homeland. He obtained his degree in 1909 and was admitted to the Bar in 1915. He would become a prominent penal lawyer. Dicker became a Swiss citizen in 1915. In Swiss politics, Dicker emerged as a prominent leader of the Socialist Party in Geneva. He collaborated with Léon Nicole at the newspaper Le Travail. Between 1922 and 1925, Dicker represented Geneva in the National Council. He returned to the National Council in 1928, and would remain a member of that body until 1941. Dicker defended Nicole in a legal case in May 1933. Being a prominent Jewish political leader, Dicker was subjected to violent antisemitic attacks. On November 9, 1932 the far-right National Union convened a meeting in the municipal hall in Plainpalais, a meeting intended to function as a tribunal against Nicole and Dicker. A leftist countermanifestation was organized. Violence broke out between demonstrators and army, killing 13 people and injuring 65. Dicker was one of four Socialist parliamentarians that sided with the Swiss Socialist Federation when the Socialist Party went through a split in 1939. The Swiss Socialist Federation was banned on May 27, 1941 and Dicker and the other parliamentarians of the party were expelled from the National Council on June 11–12, 1941."

Hill made her stage début at an early age in a pantomime version of Mother Goose at the Aquarium Theatre in Westminster. After a difficult apprenticeship at a public house, she embarked on a career in music hall by 1868. She made a success at the London Pavilion, and until 1890 she was at the peak of her fame, enjoying top-billing at music halls across London and in the northern provinces. In 1879 she became the proprietor of her first music hall and later owned or operated several more, but without success. By 1889 her health was declining, and she was forced to cancel a number of theatrical engagements. After a tour of New York in 1891, she returned to London where she made some appearances until 1984, but was mostly in poor health."

He was charged with treason by the Government of Charles I and his estates were forfeited by Oliver Cromwell, but he survived to die a natural death."

  "text" : "Sir John Wenman Crofton (27 March 1912 – 3 November 2009) was a pioneer in the treatment of tuberculosis, who also spent the better part of his life raising awareness about the harmful effects of tobacco. Crofton was born in Dublin, Ireland to a well-off Anglo-Irish family. His father was Dr. William Mervyn Crofton, who conducted medical research at the Royal University in Dublin, wrote books on endocrinology and virology, and had flourishing private medical practices both in Dublin and London. His mother was Mary Josephine Abbott, known as Molly. John was sent to prep school at Baymount, in the suburbs of Dublin away from the \"troubles\", and then in 1925 to Tonbridge School in Kent. In 1930 he matriculated at Sidney Sussex College in the University of Cambridge, eventually earning an MB in 1937 and MD in 1947. During his studies he was a keen rock-climber, making frequent expeditions to the Scottish Highlands, and pioneering a number of climbs, one of which (the Cumming-Crofton route on Mitre Ridge in the Cairngorms) still bears his name. Like most Cambridge medical students, his clinical practice was in London, in his case at St Thomas's Hospital. During this time his family moved from Dublin to London and he lived with his parents for the first time since the age of nine. His first medical posts, in 1937, were casual posts at military hospitals: the Royal Herbert Hospital in Woolwich, and the Queen Alexandra's Military Hospital. In August 1939, while temporarily unemployed, he arranged a climbing trip in the French Alps with friends; they were in Italy when they discovered that war was about to break out, and managed to get back into France the day before the border closed, and from there on crowded trains back to England. He then signed up with the Royal Army Medical Corps, serving in France, in Egypt with periods in Greece and Eritrea, and from 1942–1944 in Malta. He was then granted home leave and took up a posting in Northern Ireland, where he met his future wife, Eileen, also a qualified doctor. They married in December 1945, just three weeks after he suffered a broken nose in a car crash in Luneburg. Demobilised, he started work at the Brompton Hospital, organising a controlled trial of the use of streptomycin in the treatment of tuberculosis, coordinated by the Medical Research Council: an appointment arranged by Guy Scadding, under whom Crofton had worked in wartime. After a while he was appointed a Senior Lecturer at the Brompton. At the University of Edinburgh, Scotland, Crofton was appointed Chair of the Respiratory Diseases and Tuberculosis in 1952. In Scotland, he developed what came to be known as the \"Edinburgh Method\" for tuberculosis treatment. The essence of the method was the use of multiple drugs taken simultaneously to reduce the chance for drug-resistant strains of the tubercle bacilli to develop; this combined with careful monitoring of patients to ensure that they adhered to the prescribed medication regime. His team were able to demonstrate that mortality, and the spread of the disease in the community, could be reduced almost to zero if medication was properly prescribed and properly taken. The incidence of tuberculosis in Edinburgh declined rapidly, and Crofton spent much of the rest of his career travelling around the UK and the wider world attempting to get this message across. Alongside tuberculosis, Crofton's other main work was in preventing tobacco-related medical problems. In this he worked closely with his wife Eileen, who from 1972 headed the Action on Smoking and Health (ASH) organisation in Scotland. From 1963 to 1966 Crofton was Dean of Medicine at the University of Edinburgh Medical School. From 1966 to 1969 he worked with Andrew Douglas on their postgraduate textbook, Respiratory Diseases. From 1969 to 1971, the period of student unrest all around the world, he was Vice-Principal of the University: during this time Gordon Brown (future Prime Minister) was elected by the students as Rector. This had traditionally been a ceremonial post, but Brown decided to exercise his right as Rector to chair the University Court. According to Crofton, Brown did the job very efficiently. From 1973 to 1976 he was President of the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh. In 1977, he officially retired from the University and was knighted. He was chair of the International Union Against Tuberculosis and Lung Disease (IUATLD) from 1984 to 1988. He helped write the World Health Organization's guidelines for the treatment of tuberculosis before his death. In 1998, Sir John Crofton was a founder member of a new UK and international tuberculosis charity, TB Alert. He served as TB Alert's Honorary President from 1999 until his death in 2009. His support for the charity continues through The Sir John Crofton Fund to Fight TB and the Sir John Crofton Prize for TB Nursing. Crofton was the 2005 recipient of The Union Medal from the IUATLD. The Crofton Award, named in honour of the physician and his wife, physician Eileen Crofton, is given by the Royal Environmental Health Institute of Scotland (REHIS) and ASH Scotland, recognising the \"contributions young people in Scotland make towards reducing the harm caused by tobacco\"."

During the Landshut War of Succession, John fought on the side of Elector Palatine Philip. After the war, he was briefly expelled by Emperor Maximilian I. Nevertheless, he was hired by Duke George of Bavaria and later by Elector Palatine Louis V. Between 1513 and 1518, he served as governor of Amberg, earning an annual salary of 1000 guilders. This additional income allowed him to lend money to Elector Palatine Otto Henry and his brother Philip and to Margrave Frederick I \"the Elder\" of Bradenburg-Ansbach. However, most of the money was never repaid. In 1515, he sold Neuhaus to Waldsessen Abbey. In 1530, he purchased Luhe and Wernberg from Hans Adam Wißpeck zu Volburg and granted city status to the town of Pfreimd, where he lived. He also introduced the primogeniture in Leuchtenberg."

  "text" : "Joel Olson (4 November 1967 – 29 March 2012) was an associate professor of political theory at Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff and a social justice activist. Olson graduated with a PhD in political theory from the University of Minnesota. Inspired by the work of abolitionists and African-American Sociologist W.E.B. Du Bois, his dissertation examined the interconnection between race and democracy. From his dissertation, he published his book The Abolition of White Democracy (2004, University of Minnesota Press). At the time of his death, he was building a theory of fanaticism or extremism that would explain the politics of Pro-Life assassins, abolitionists, green anarchists, and Al-Qaeda. The work was titled American Zealot: Fanaticism and Democracy in the United States. Although a university professor, Olson rejected intellectual-worker and activist-theorist divides, engaging in politics on the streets, canvassing, building community support. Over his life, he worked in and helped found groups like Bring the Ruckus, Cop Watch, and the Repeal Coalition. This, latest effort was initiated in 2008 in response to an increased oppression of immigrants and those perceived to be immigrants in Arizona. The Repeal Coalition, co-founded by Olson and other members of the Flagstaff community, focuses on repealing all anti-immigration legislation and providing support for the immigrant community. As their web states, the group is \"an organization committed to repealing over 60 anti-immigrant laws and bills that have been passed or considered by Arizona politicians in the past few years. We demand the repeal of all laws — federal, state, and local — that degrade and discriminate against undocumented individuals and that deny U.S. citizens their lawful rights.\" The following quote of Olson's was turned into a plaque on a memorial outdoor classroom between the buildings of the College of Social and Behavioral Sciences at NAU: \"What is the most damage I can do, given my biography, abilities, and commitments, to the racial order and rule of capital?\""

He produced many buildings in Leigh and Nicholas Pevsner remarked that, \"Any building of any merit (in Leigh) which is not a church or a mill is almost certainly by the local firm of J.C. Prestwich & Sons, capable – sometimes very capable – in a number of styles.\" Several of Prestwich's buildings survive including the Central Buildings on Bradshawgate which were built for the Leigh Friendly Co-operative Society, Leigh Technical School and Library on Railway Road, Leigh Town Hall, Leigh Infirmary and numerous shop, public house and business premises and houses in Pennington. Other buildings have been demolished including Leigh Public Baths and Leigh Union workhouse hospital. Prestwich designed other public buildings including Tyldesley Library and Atherton Town Hall. Further afield he designed public baths in Stockport and Ashton-in-Makerfield and schools in Atherton, Southport, Birkdale and Hindley. Prestwich was a fellow of the Manchester Society of Architects and practised until 1930. His son Harold joined the practice in 1908."

Chapple was close to Burges and was one of the executors of his will. On Burges's death, Chapple wrote \"a constant relationship...with one of the brightest ornaments of the profession has rendered the parting most severe. Thank God his work will live and ... be the admiration of future students. I have hardly got to realize my lonely position yet. He was almost all the world to me.\" Burges's practice was inherited by his brother-in-law, Richard Popplewell Pullan and Chapple worked with him on the two volumes of drawings of Burges's work which Pullan published in the mid -1880s. Chapple also worked with Pullan and William Frame in completing a number of Burges's unfinished works, including Cardiff Castle, and Castell Coch, the fantasy palaces Burges designed for John Crichton-Stuart, 3rd Marquess of Bute in South Wales. At Castell Coch, Chapple was responsible for much of the furniture, including the elaborate suite in Lady Bute's bedroom. He also completed St Michael's Church, Brighton. Chapple retired in 1911 and died at Barnet in 1922."

  "text" : "John Albert Bullbrook (1882–1967; born in the Medway area in what was then Kent in South-East England) was an author, archaeologist and archaeological historian, who went to Trinidad in 1913 as a petroleum geologist. He began his archaeological career in 1919, pioneering the search on the indigenous population of Trinidad. By the early 1930s, he already provides evidence of the prominence of reflections on the indigenous history of Trinidad, and on the figure of the Carib, in some of the élites’ writings of local history. Famously in a public lecture in 1938, John Bullbrook, by then a local specialist in the Amerindian history of Trinidad, made the comment: \"To this day we speak of the Queen if the Caribs at Arima, yet I doubt if there is much--if any--Carib blood in her race.\". In 1940, for a public lecture and book published under the Royal Victoria Museum and the Historical Society of Trinidad and Tobago, entitled The Ierian Race, Bullbrook wrote: \"Probably, if I were to ask any of my audience this evening what was the predominant or even the only race in Trinidad at the time of the discovery by Cristobal Colon, the reply would be unhesitatingly: ‘Why, Carib, of course’\". Throughout the 1940s, he conducted extensive excavations in the Amerindian middens in Cedros, Erin and Palo Seco. The Cedros site in Trinidad, which he excavated with Irving Rouse in 1946, is considered one of the most important archaeological sites in the Caribbean, consisting of a partly destroyed shell midden located on the southwest tip of Trinidad. The corrected radiocarbon datings for the finds at this site were given as 190 B.C. and A.D. 100. Bullbrook, as a partisan in the local debate over whether the true natives of Trinidad were Carib or Arawak, lamented later, in 1960, that the \"tradition\" of believing that Caribs were the indigenous people of Trinidad was \"deep rooted and hard to destroy\". In July 1960, Bullbrook, at the first conference in the West Indies on pre-Columbian archaeology held in Fort-de-France, Martinique, discussed his research into the \"Arawaks and Caribs of Trinidad\" along with the likes of Rev. Father Pinchon and A. H. Anderson. Articles of Bullbrook's have been published in magazines with a varying range of readers such as The Caribbean, Caribbean Quarterly, and Shell Magazine. He later became curator of the Royal Victoria Institute (now the National Museum), and died at the age of 85 (in 1967). John Bullbrook (who was the first to use modern stratigraphic techniques in Trinidad), having been educated in Great Britain, had previous field experience in the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan. His techniques represent a significant advance over the ‘museological’ approach that characterized the work of Fewkes (1850–1930) and de Booy (1882–1919). His collection of correspondence with Yale University (1941–1963), with a variety of people on the subject of archaeology in the West Indies (1917–1960), with the Historical Society of Trinidad and Tobago (1939–1949); and correspondence with the Trinidad and Tobago Field Naturalists Club, have all been donated to the University of the West Indies by Carlisle Chang (in October 2000). Bullbrook was homosexual, but was married to the lesbian painter Amy Leong Pang."

He was born in Cornwall, the son of John Pascoe and Marjorie Wills, and came to Canada around 1870. The family first settled in North Dorchester, Ontario; in 1892, his parents moved to a homestead near Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan where they spent the rest of their lives. Pascoe acquired his own homestead near Regina around 1883. After four years, he moved to Michigan and then back to Ontario; during this time, he was involved in the lumber business. Pascoe married Mary Olton in 1887. In 1891, he travelled west again, settling on his own homestead near Moose Jaw. He served as chairman of the Local Improvement District surrounding Moose Jaw and then, after he moved his residence to Moose Jaw, as a member of Moose Jaw City Council. Pascoe was mayor of Moose Jaw from 1913 to 1915. He was defeated when he ran for reelection to the provincial assembly in 1925 as a Conservative. Pascoe served as mayor of Moose Jaw again from 1929 until his death in 1931. He died at the age of 68 of a heart attack in a Moose Jaw suburb while attempting to shovel away sand that had been blown around his car by the wind. His son James Ernest was also a Moose Jaw mayor and served in the Canadian House of Commons."

  "text" : "John Keigwin (1641–1716) was a Cornish antiquary, born at Mousehole, Cornwall. He was a leading member of a group of antiquaries in west Penwith; this group also included John Boson and Thomas Boson, William Gwavas, Thomas Tonkin, William Borlase, Oliver Pender, and James Jenkins of Alverton. The scholars Edward Lhuyd and William Borlase described Keigwin's knowledge of the Cornish language as profound and complete. His teacher was the scholar John Boson. Keigwin had mastered the French, Latin, Greek and Hebrew languages in addition to Cornish and English. He was a nephew of William Scawen, also a scholar of the Cornish language, since Scawen's sister Elizabeth had married his father Martin Keigwin. Keigwin's translations of Pascon Agan Arluth and Creacon of the World were published by Davies Gilbert in 1826 and 1827. Among other scholarly work he translated the letter of Charles I, King of England to the people of Cornwall written at Sudeley Castle in 1643 into Cornish. The scholar Henry Jenner, noted extraordinary mistakes made by Keigwin in the translations of Pascon and Creacon. Jenner and P. Berresford Ellis note that Keigwin used the Hebrew word for war, milchamath, in translating King Charles's letter instead of bresel."

  "text" : "John McNair (October 1887–18 February 1968) was a British socialist politician. McNair was born in Boston, Lincolnshire, but moved to Tyneside at an early age. He left school when he was thirteen, working as an errand boy. He joined the Independent Labour Party (ILP), and was involved in Victor Grayson's election campaigns in 1910, on one occasion having to fill for an entire evening when Grayson failed to arrive. In 1911, he moved to Coventry, in an attempt to find regular employment, but his political activity made this difficult, and so, later in the year, he moved to Paris, where he lived and worked until 1923. He worked as the London Organising Secretary for the ILP during the 1924 general election, but felt that this had harmed his health, and he returned to Paris, where he worked for the next twelve years. In 1936, McNair again returned to the UK, and was appointed as the ILP's national Organising Secretary and international representative. In this post, he travelled to Spain with John McGovern, in order to investigate the role of the Catholic Church in the Spanish Civil War. When McGovern returned to Scotland, McNair remained in Barcelona, running the ILP's political office, and making arrangements for the arrival of British volunteers to fight with the POUM; these included George Orwell, who McNair met on Orwell's arrival. Following the suppression of the POUM during the Barcelona May Days, he fled Spain with Orwell and two others. McNair was elected as General Secretary of the ILP in 1939, in which capacity he evacuated the party offices to Glasgow. While holding the post, he stood in the Bristol Central by-election, 1943, taking 7.3% of the vote, and wrote an official biography of James Maxton, entitled The Beloved Rebel. In 1955, McNair retired from the General Secretaryship, and returned to Tyneside, when he completed a degree at the University of Durham in French and English history, and Greek and Roman culture. Aged 72, he followed this with an MA, his thesis being on the work of Orwell."

In 1847, the family traveled with Mormon pioneers from Nauvoo to the Salt Lake Valley. In 1849, Charles Rich became an apostle of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). In 1860, Joseph Rich traveled to England and Wales, where he was a missionary for the LDS Church until 1863. During that time, his father was the president the LDS Church's European Mission, which was based in England. Returning to Salt Lake City, Charles and Joseph Rich were recruited by Brigham Young to participate in the settlement of the Bear River Valley in Idaho Territory. Under the leadership of Charles Rich, the settlers founded Paris, Idaho. On January 25, 1867, Joseph Rich became a member of the Council of Fifty. In 1868, Rich wrote a famous article in the Deseret News in which he claimed that a group of settlers had seen \"monsters\" swimming in the waters of Bear Lake. This was the beginning of the popular legend that the Bear Lake monster inhabits the lake. Rich was a Democrat and was twice elected to represent Bear Lake County in the Idaho Territorial Legislature. He presided over the Democratic Party's Idaho state convention in 1894 and was elected as an Idaho state senator in 1896. In 1898, he was elected as the judge of Idaho's fifth judicial district. In 1886, Rich married Ann Eliza Hunter, a daughter of Edward Hunter, a prominent leader in the LDS Church. Rich died in Centerville, Utah, and was buried in the Paris Cemetery in Paris."

At that time he was working as a teacher in an Approved School, a Scottish reformatory. One gang member in the school, \"Tim Malloy\" (born 1950, also a pseudonym and a generic term for a Glasgow Catholic), agreed to infiltrate him into his gang in Maryhill in Glasgow. Patrick spent four months as a gang member, observing their behaviour. A Glasgow Gang Observed has been re-published in 2012 and 2013.

Crain followed her brother, Peter, into competitive running in high school (Franklin HS, Wisconsin) and continued her running at Ohio University where she earned All-MAC honors (1987–1990). After college she put her competitive running career on hold while pursuing a professional career until deciding to train for and compete in the 1996 Olympic Trials. On August 21, 2007, while on a training run for her fourth Olympic Marathon Trials, Crain was hit by an automobile, while crossing the intersection between Brady and Farwell streets in her hometown of Milwaukee. Jenny suffered a myriad of injuries including extensive brain damage, ending her competitive running career and starting a life-time of rehabilitation."

  "text" : "Johan Beetz (August 19, 1874 – March 26, 1949) was a Canadian naturalist of Belgian origin. He settled in a small coastal town in the Côte-Nord region of Quebec, which was later renamed Baie-Johan-Beetz in his honour, along with the nearby bay, known as the baie Johan-Beetz. He was born in Boortmeerbeek, Belgium, in the château d'Oudenhouven, to an aristocratic family. His father Johannes Beetz died when he was two years old and his mother Céline Verzyl (or Versyl) remarried an English major named Walter Turner. He had a privileged childhood and the future King Albert was among his childhood acquaintances. In his youth, he participated in hunting in Morocco, Algeria and Congo, and took part in archeological digs. He studied medicine and biology. However, his fiancée (and cousin) Marthe Versyl died of pneumonia. Apparently seeking a change in his life, he considered moving from Belgium to Africa, but then he happened to converse with a certain Monsieur Warner, who talked about the hunting and fishing in Pashti-Baie (or Piastrebaie) along the north shore of the Gulf of Saint Lawrence in Quebec, Canada, where Warner had a house. Beetz bought Warner's house on the spot, and moved there in May 1897. Within this year, Beetz meet Henry de Puyjalon a pioneer in Canadian ecology, among the first to suggest wild life conservation areas. He married a local girl named Adéla Tanguay on September 27, 1898 and constructed a very large house, today known as the Maison Johan-Beetz and classified as a historical monument by the Quebec government. They eventually had 11 children. He hunted, fished, and trapped with the local villagers. He raised foxes for their fur. He was a naturalist and ornithologist, and made numerous studies and hand drawings. He invented a mummification process for preserving animal bodies; however the technique was lost when he died. From 1903 to 1913 he was the local postmaster, and he often served as a sort of doctor. He was credited with sparing the village from the Spanish influenza in 1918–1919 by restricting external contact and disinfecting mail. In 1922 the Beetz family moved to Saint-Laurent, then a suburb of Montreal and today a borough of the city. He bought a house there at 54 rue Saint-Germain. In July 1924, he was made a chevalier in the Order of Leopold II by the Belgian government. He later lived at 322 avenue Laurier, Quebec City, which has a plaque mentioning that fact. In 1931 he founded a zoo in Charlesbourg (today part of Quebec City), later known by the name Jardin zoologique de Québec (it closed in 2006). He continued to raise foxes, at a farm in Vaudreuil. When the business was badly affected by the 1929 stock market crash, he was named director of the \"fox\" department at the Service de l'élevage des animaux à fourrure of the Quebec government. He wrote a book on the subject, entitled \"L'Indispensable\" à l'éleveur de renards argentés; it was published in English translation as \"The indispensable\" for fox breeders, translated by Thos. J. Carbray. The Université de Montréal wished to give him an honorary doctorate, however he preferred to deliver an oral thesis presentation; he was granted the Doctor of Science degree (Docteur ès Science agricole (vulpiculture)). The fox breeding industry in Quebec did not survive long after the death of its founder, however. In 1965, the village where he spent many years of his life was renamed Baie-Johan-Beetz. There are streets named after him in both Baie-Johan-Beetz and in Sept-Îles. There is also a lake, Lac Beetz, in the Lac-Jérôme unorganized territory, which may be named for him, although the Commission de toponymie du Québec does not attest this."

  "text" : "Julien Joseph Vesque (8 April 1848, in Luxembourg – 25 July 1895, in Paris), was a French naturalist, noted for his work on the agricultural and horticultural benefits deriving from the study of plant physiology. He was the father of Marthe and Juliette, the celebrated circus aficionados known as the Vesque Sisters. Vesque received his early education at the Athénée grand-ducal, moved to Paris in 1871, living and working there for the rest of his life. He held the position of professor from 1880 at the Muséum national d'Histoire naturelle and from 1883 he was professor at the Paris Agricultural Institute, teaching at the Sorbonne during the same period. His main area of study was water transportation in plants. In 1880 he stated that the movement of water in plants is due to both transpiration and root pressure. He was also interested in the effect of temperature on root absorption of water from the soil. Vesque proved that water moved through the cavities of the vessels and not along the walls of plant vessels. During his research he invented laboratory instruments for studying transpiration in plants. He is denoted by the author abbreviation Vesque when citing a botanical name."

He came from a family of musicians—his father, Luke Smith, Sr. was a bandleader, and six of his brothers also played the trumpet or trombone: Luke, Stanley, Doonie, Charles, and Carpathia, and Russell. Three of the brothers went on to professionally, Russell as first trumpet for Fletcher Henderson. Known throughout his childhood as \"Toots\", Smith originally started as a drummer but was convinced by Ethel Waters that he was far better as a trumpet player. It has been said that when he reached New York in 1920 he already had a fully formed style, which achieved \"the vocalised sound, the blues spirit and the swing which makes for convincing jazz performance\". In 1921, Smith joined the Black Swan Jazz Masters in Chicago, directed at the time by Fletcher Henderson who described Smith as \"the most soulful trumpet I ever had\". He also worked with the Jazz Hounds, the Broadway Syncopators, and finally with McKinney's Cotton Pickers throughout the 1920s. He became famous from his work accompanying Bessie Smith, recording over 30 records. Some of the other artists he worked with include Billy Paige, Noble Sissle, Eubie Blake, and Allie Ross. Smith died of complications from tuberculosis on December 2, 1937 in an asylum in Central Islip, New York."

  "text" : "Jalda Rebling (born 1951 in Amsterdam) is a German hazzan. A year after birth, she and her parents moved to East Germany in 1952. Her parents survived the Holocaust, and Rebling's mother and aunt were the first to tell Otto Frank of his daughters' deaths. Her mother Rebekka Brilleslijper, also known as Lin Jaldati, was a well-known singer of Yiddish music. In 1987 Rebling helped organize a Yiddish culture festival in Germany, which occurred every year into the 1990s. Rebling herself eventually became one of the best known Yiddish singers in united postwar Germany. She also acted in Yiddish at the Hackischer Hoftheater. In 1979 the Anne Frank Kindergarten in Berlin had Rebling and her mother perform for the fiftieth anniversary of Anne Frank’s birth; the production was shown on GDR TV and sold as a record, and it became the family’s signature production on tour. They performed it at Yad Vashem in Jerusalem, and Rebling noted that while “we sang in Yiddish, there was also a German song by Paul Dessau. In fact, we brought the first two pieces of German-language music into Yad Vashem.” Rebling wrote \"Yiddish Culture — a Soul Survivor of East Germany,\" which was included in the book Speaking Out: Jewish Voices from United Germany, published in 1995. In 2007 she became the first openly lesbian cantor ordained by the Jewish Renewal movement. That year she also became the first woman to lead the High Holiday services in Lund, Sweden. She also led the first egalitarian service in the traditional Jewish community of Hamburg, Germany.

  "text" : "Jerzy Tumaniszwili (Georgian: გიორგი თუმანიშვილი, Giorgi Tumanishvili) (June 21, 1916 – December 9, 2010) was a Polish naval commander of a Georgian aristocratic descent. A World War II veteran and later an émigré to the United States, he received the rank of rear-admiral from the government of Poland in 2008. Jerzy Tumaniszwili was born in Moscow in 1916. His father Prince Paul Toumanoff (Tumanishvili, 1872–1935) served as Marshal of Nobility of Georgia in the last years of the Russian Empire. His mother, Jadwiga Szyszko, was a daughter of the Polish general Cezary Szyszko, a commander in Zhytomyr. After the Russian Revolution of 1917, the family moved to Georgia, which they fled, following the country's takeover by the Bolsheviks in 1921. The family eventually settled in Warsaw, where Paul Toumanoff headed a local Georgian émigré committee from 1924 to 1930. In 1935, Jerzy Tumaniszwili, through the recommendation of General Alexander Zakariadze, a Georgian in the Polish service, was enrolled in the Polish naval college (Akademia Marynarki Wojennej). In 1938 Tumaniszwili received the rank of second lieutenant of the Polish navy. During World War II, he served as an artillery officer on the ORP Burza, OF Ouragan, ORP Krakowiak, and ORP Piorun. He participated in various combat missions, including the Norwegian Campaign, the Battle at Calais, the Atlantic Convoys, the actions in the Bay of Biscay, and the D-Day operations. He was wounded in combat in 1942 during battle with enemy torpedo boats. In 1944, Tumaniszwili was promoted to captain of the Polish navy. In 1950, Tumaniszwili left Communist Poland for the United States, where he ran an enterprise, producing disposable needles. He also wrote for the local Polish press and participated in the émigré Polish organizations, including the New York City-based Józef Piłsudski Institute of America. In 1990, the president of Poland in exile, Ryszard Kaczorowski, gave him a promotion to Lieutenant Commander. In 2008 he received the honorary rank of Rear Admiral from President Lech Kaczyński. He was decorated with Virtuti Militari, Polonia Restituta and other orders. Tumaniszwili died at age 93 in Florida in 2010."

  "text" : "John Vanderaart (born John L.M. van der Aart, 18 November 1962, Amsterdam) (also known as Doctor John or DRJ) is a Dutch games developer and writer. He studied computer science in Leiden. In the 1980s, he became known because of his computer games for home computers such the Commodore 64, Sinclair ZX Spectrum and the MSX computers. He especially wrote educational software, action games and adventure games. He released his first games for the Dutch software house Radarsoft, which he founded with some of his study mates. He was one of the first Dutchmen who could earn his living by making computer games. Several of the games of Radarsoft were also released abroad. In 1986 he stopped at Radarsoft after releasing the game Hopeloos. The reason for this was because he thought the company's strategy was becoming too commercial-driven and he thought it was a pity that it wasn't about the computer games themselves anymore. After the games era he became specialized in network technology. In 1995 he still made BASIC-listings for the magazine Eigen PC. He also wrote for LAN Magazine and he had a section in the twice weekly magazine Computer Idee under the alias FAQman. He also wrote several books about computer technology. Nowadays he gives advice and does troubleshooting for his own consultancy company."

  "text" : "J. Waskom Pickett Jarrell Waskom Pickett (1890–1981) was a Methodist minister and missionary to India. Pickett was born in Jonesville, Texas, February 21, 1890, to Leander Lycurgus Pickett and Ludie Carrington Day. Leander, a Methodist minister and intenerant evangelist, was born in Burnsville, Mississippi on February 27, 1859. He pastored churches and conducted revival meetings throughout the South and Southwest. On one such occasion he spoke at Mansfield Female College, an all-women's school in DeSoto Parish, Louisiana. There he met Ludie Carington Day, a professor at the school. The two began seeing each other socially and were married on December 5, 1888. Leander was 30 years old. Ludie was 21. The couple had seven children. In 1890, the Pickets lived in Wilmore, Kentucky, where Leander became involved in the founding of Asbury College. Soon after they arrived in Wilmore, J. Waskom was enrolled at Asbury and graduated in 1907 at the age of seventeen. In 1910, E. Stanley Jones asked Pickett to assume leadership of an English-speaking Methodist congregation Jones had founded in India. Pickett accepted that invitation and was appointed to serve in Lucknow, India, by the Methodist Board of Foreign Mission. On October 1, 1910, he boarded the steamship Baltic in New York City and set sail for India. Three months later, at a meeting of the North India Conference of the Methodist Church held from January 4–10, 1911, in Lucknow, Pickett was ordained into the ministry as an elder in the Methodist Church. While working in India, Pickett met Ruth Robinson, the daughter of John Wesley Robinson, a Methodist bishop for Southern Asia. Ruth had been born in Lucknow on March 8, 1898. The two were attracted to each other, but Ruth insisted on obtaining a college degree and returned to the United States where she attended Northwestern University in Chicago, Illinois. She graduated from Northwestern in 1916. Later that summer, Pickett joined Ruth in Chicago where, on July 27, 1916, they were married. When the Picketts returned to India they assumed leadership of a boys school in Arrah, India. The Picketts had four children, Elizabeth, Miriam, Margaret, and Douglas, all born in India. In 1933, Pickett published \"Christian Mass Movements in India\" which chronicled and examined the growth of the church in India. Principles described by Pickett in that work became the basis for the Church Growth Movement. Donald McGavran, one of the earliest proponents of that movement, often said, \"I lit my fire at Pickett's candle.\" In 1935, Pickett was consecrated a Methodist bishop by the Central Conference of Southern Asia. Pickett provided leadership for the Methodist Church's work in India until he retired from the missionary field in 1956. Following retirement, he returned to the United States and accepted a teaching position at Boston University's School of Theology. He died in Columbus, Ohio, on August 17, 1981."

Landy is the author of Philosophy as Fiction: Self, Deception, and Knowledge in Proust (Oxford University Press, 2004) and of How To Do Things with Fictions (Oxford University Press, June 2012). He is the co-editor of two volumes, Thematics: New Approaches (SUNY, 1995, with Claude Bremond and Thomas Pavel) and The Re-Enchantment of the World: Secular Magic in a Rational Age (Stanford, 2009, with Michael Saler). Philosophy as Fiction deals with issues of self-knowledge, self-deception, and self-fashioning in Marcel Proust's A la recherche du temps perdu, while raising the question of what literary form contributes to an engagement with such questions; How to Do Things with Fictions discusses a series of texts (by Plato, Beckett, Mallarmé, and Mark) that function as training-grounds for the mental capacities. Landy has appeared on the NPR shows \"Forum\" and \"Philosophy Talk\" and has on various occasions been guest host of \"Entitled Opinions.\" Landy received Stanford's Walter J. Gores Award for Teaching Excellence in 1999 and Dean's Award for Distinguished Teaching in 2001. In 2012 he was included in Princeton Review's \"Best 300 Professors\"."

  "text" : "The Viscount Jean-Jacques Desandrouin (May 25, 1681 – 16 November 1761) came from the district of Lodelinsart belonging to the Belgian city of Charleroi. His name is connected with the beginnings of the industrial revolution in Belgium and the massive expansion of coal mining in the area of Anzin in northern France. For the spelling of his name, there are the variants 'Désandrouin or 'Desandrouins or sometimes De Sandrouin and Androuins. His activities changed the face of this region. His economic success was based on his involvement in the manufacture of glass, in metal production in forging and in promotion and transport of coal. He co-founded and owned the most important mining company in his time the Compagnie des mines d'Anzin, which was founded on November 19, 1757."

  "text" : "John Chevir (c.1410-1474) was an Irish judge and politician of the fifteenth century. He held the offices of Lord Chief Justice of Ireland and Master of the Rolls in Ireland, and was also one of the first recorded Speakers of the Irish House of Commons. He was born in Kilkenny, younger son of John Chevir senior, justice of the peace. He was the brother of William Chevir (died 1446) who also had a successful, if somewhat turbulent career: William held office as a judge of the Court of King's Bench (Ireland), Deputy Treasurer of Ireland and Deputy to the Lord Chancellor of Ireland. John was at Lincoln's Inn in 1442 and soon afterwards was acting as legal adviser to James Butler, 4th Earl of Ormonde in London, but he returned to Ireland before 1450. John and his brother were strong supporters of the Earl of Ormonde's faction, one of the two major parties in Irish politics in the 1430s and 1440s. He was then appointed Master of the Rolls; this was then a less important office than it became later, and its duties were administrative rather than judicial. It was clearly a part-time office since he was returned to the Irish House of Commons at the same time and was one of the first known Speakers. The Parliament of 1463 passed an Act restoring to him the mill and watercourse at Esker;  this was probably the manor of Esker near Lucan, Dublin, a Crown property which was often leased to public servants for their lifetime. In 1468 he was appointed joint Lord Chief Justice with Sir Thomas Fitz-Christopher Plunket and became sole Chief Justice in 1471. He remained in office until his death in 1474. He married Anne Bermingham, who outlived him; given the rarity of his surname (which is thought to be the original form of Cheever) it is likely that they were the parents of John Chevir, merchant of Dublin, who in 1479 was one of those permitted by Edward IV to build a chantry at the Church of St. Nicholas Without, Dublin."

He was first vice principal and later principal of St Bonaventure's High School, Hyderabad from 1958 to 1977. He was also instrumental in starting the school band in 1958. In the early 1960s Todd took a break from St. Bonaventure's to act as the principal of St. Mary’s High School, Sukkur. He has also been principal of St Francis Grammar School, Quetta. From 2000 to 2006 he was vice principal of St. Patrick's School. On May 6, 2011, The Old Patricians (former students of the school) presented the Father J. B. Todd ofm Gold Medal to the top student from the eighth grade at the closing ceremony of the 150th anniversary of the school. On March 18, 2012, at the age of 91, he attended the Old Patricians’ St Patrick’s Day Reunion dinner. Among his former students is Bishop Samson Shukardin of Hyderabad. Along with many other former students they gathered at the Karachi Gymkhana to celebrate Todd’s 94th birthday."

  "text" : "Josette Marie \"Josie\" DeCarlo (née Dumont; September 8, 1923 – March 14, 2012) was a French-born model who became the inspiration and namesake for Josie McCoy of Josie and the Pussycats comics and the 1970 Hanna-Barbera Saturday morning cartoon series. She was the widow of the late cartoonist, Dan DeCarlo, who created Josie and the Pussycats and based the main character on his wife. DeCarlo was born Josette Dumont in France. She met her future husband, Dan DeCarlo, on a blind date in Belgium in 1945, just a short time after the end of the Battle of the Bulge. At the time of their meeting, Dumont did not speak any English, while DeCarlo, a member of the U.S. Army during World War II, spoke very little French. Unable to have a conversation due to their language barrier, Dumont and DeCarlo communicated through his cartoons. In a later interview, Josie explained their early courtship, \"We communicated with drawing...He would draw things for me to make me understand what he had in mind. He was really so amusing. Instead of just using words, he would use cartoons to express himself. Right away, we knew that we were meant for each other.\" Decarlo and Dumont married. She became the inspiration for Josie and the Pussycats almost accidentally while the couple were taking a cruise. DeCarlo wore a cat suit costume during the cruise, which became the basis for the fictional Josie and the Pussycats trademark outfits. She explained to the New York Times in 2001 interview, \"We went on a Caribbean cruise, and I had a costume for the cruise, and that’s the way it started.\" Later, when she got a new hairdo, Dan DeCarlo incorporated it into the Josie character as well, \"The hairdo came after...One day, I came in with a new hairdo with a little bow in my hair, and he said, ‘That’s it!’\" Dan DeCarlo drew his wife with the cat costume as Josie McCoy, initially giving her the name \"star\" before deciding on Josie. Josie first appeared in Archie Comics in 1962. While DeCarlo became the model for Josie, the character was voiced by actress Janet Waldo in the television series. Dan DeCarlo died in 2001. However, Josie DeCarlo remained active in the comic and animation industries following his death. She promoted her late husband's work within the industry, particularly the Josie and the Pussycats brand during the 2000s."

  "text" : "Jewel Flowers Evans (22 July 1923 – 6 February 2006) was an American pin-up model best known for her work with Rolf Armstrong as a \"Calendar Girl\" during the 1940s and 1950s. Jewel Flowers was born in 1923, in East Lumberton, North Carolina, in the part of the town known as a cotton mill village, to Calton and Leah Flowers. She was the youngest of three children. She had a sister, Evelyn Flowers, and a brother, C.F. Flowers. As a teenager she was crowned \"Miss Lumberton, North Carolina\". She moved to New York City at 17 after graduating from high school, having been both invited there by a friend from Lumberton and sent by her parents to enroll in a business college in Manhattan. In March 1940, Flowers sent a picture of herself to pin-up artist Rolf Armstrong in response to an advert he had placed in the New York Times. Armstrong, 50 at the time, had been based at the Hotel des Artistes on West 67th Street in Manhattan since 1939, and was looking for new models. He invited Flowers for an interview. On March 25, 1940, Flowers started modeling for Armstrong. Their professional collaboration and friendship lasted for two decades. The first painting, titled \"How am I doing?\", reportedly because Flowers, unused to modeling, repeatedly asked Armstrong \"How am I doing?\" during the modeling session, was first published after World War II had started. It was Brown & Bigelow's best selling calendar for 1942 at a time when the company sold millions of calendars in America, and it became one of Armstrong's most reproduced pictures. Flowers was popular with American servicemen during World War II, some of whom sent her letters proposing marriage. Armstrong's calendars and silhouettes of Flowers were copied onto bombers and other planes as nose art and painted on tank turrets. She became so well known during the war, although more as a famous face than by name, that a serviceman's letter addressed simply as \"Jewel Flowers, New York City\" was delivered correctly. For many American servicemen abroad, she represented the \"Why We Fight\" spirit. U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt's government enlisted her to help promote war bonds. The January 1, 1945 edition of TIME magazine included Armstrong's \"Toast of the Town\" painting of Flowers in an article about Calendar Art. The article noted that calendars with \"girl paintings\" were \"bought heavily by foundries, machine shops, auto-supply dealers.\" Flowers married Frank Welch in California in 1946. They lived in several places while her husband tried a number of business ventures, including Laguna Beach, California, Greenville, South Carolina, Reno, Nevada, where she reportedly worked in as a card dealer for a time, and New York City. They had a son together, Woody Welch. According to Michael Wooldridge, coauthor of Pin up Dreams: The Glamour Art of Rolf Armstrong, Armstrong called her a number of times during the period she was following her husband from place to place, to try to persuade her to return to New York and modeling for him. Her modeling career ended with Armstrong's death in 1960. He left a large proportion of his personal wealth to Flowers. In total, Armstrong created around fifty to sixty works using Flowers as the model. She returned to Lumberton as a wealthy woman. Her marriage to Frank Welch ended in divorce and in 1961 she moved to Myrtle Beach, South Carolina. She married Jon Wesley Evans there in 1965, they worked together at his Certified Public Accounting firm, and were successful in real estate investment. Jon Evans died in 1995. Flowers died in 2006 of complications following surgery. Louis K. Meisel, coauthor of The Great American Pin-Up, said she was \"the last of the great models\" drawn by illustrators. South Carolina's The State newspaper described her as \"probably the number one pin-up girl of all time\"."

The short film got the attention of the producer Franck Chorot and Gaumont, who promptly offered Leclercq a budget of 8.7 million euros to produce his first feature film Chrysalis, the story of a police lieutenant (played by Albert Dupontel) who tries to find his wife’s killer in a Paris of 2025. Leclercq returned to reality to undertake the ambitious project of L'Assaut, a film about the hijack of the Paris-Algiers flight in December 1994. His work includes directing the 2013 film The Informant, producing the 2014 film L'Affaire SK1, and writing and directing the 2015 film Braqueurs."

He was born 1577, according to a manuscript of his horoscope extant in the British Museum. where he is also given the title eques romanus (Roman knight) suggesting a knight of the Germanic Holy Roman Empire, or Freiherr, which suggests identification with the family of two Grossschedel brothers, \"Gebrüdern Groschedel,\" of Regensburg, whose elevation to nobility was granted in 1623, and the family's noble status was confirmed to Franz von Großschedl by Maximilian II Emanuel, Elector of Bavaria in 1691. Another surviving manuscript of his can be found within the Manchester Medical Manuscripts Collection held by special collections at the University of Manchester Library. The manuscript has the reference MMM/23/2/1 and contains elements of a pharmacopoeia as well as references to the role of the zodiac and the works of Paracelsus and Jean Beguin.

  "text" : "Jeremy Keenan (born 1945) is a British social anthropologist. He is a professor at the School of Oriental and African Studies of the University of London. The regional focuses of his research are the Sahara, North Africa and the Sahel region. Concerning the contents, he concentrates on anthropology of development, security and globalisation. During the last years, he has published a number of books and articles about the approaches of the United States to counter terrorism in Africa. Keenan has long argued that Islamist terror groups in North Africa are masterminded by Algeria, with the knowledge of the CIA and other intelligence services, which stage \"false flag\" attacks to expand Algerian and US political influence over the region and its economic resources. In his book \"The Dark Sahara\", Keenan accuses the United States and Algeria of having conspired to fabricate evidence and exaggerate the threat of al-Qaeda terrorism in Northern Africa. He calls the \"global war on terror\" a deception and claims that it is causing immense damage to the peoples of the Sahara, namely the Tuareg. On 22 May 2012, he alleged in a BBC interview that the Algerian government (despite being officially secular) was backing Ansar Dine, both because Ansar Dine justified the existence of the government's security apparatus, and because backing it allowed Algeria to \"project power in what it sees as its sphere of influence\"."

  "text" : "John Tanner (1778–1850) was a leading figure in early Mormonism and the chief financial backer of the Kirtland Temple. Tanner was a native of Rhode Island. He moved to New York when fairly young. Of his 21 children from three successive wives (his first two wives died before he married his next wife), 14 lived to adulthood. Tanner was a Baptist until he joined the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints in 1832. He was baptized by Jared Carter. Ten of his 14 children who lived to adulthood affiliated with The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) and eventually moved to Utah Territory. In late 1834, Tanner sold his property in and around Lake George, New York which included a hotel. He then moved to Kirtland, Ohio where in early 1835 he lent money and assumed loans to keep the building of the Kirtland Temple moving forward. When Joseph Smith tried to repay him he refused any payment saying they owed him nothing. Tanner moved with the main body of the Mormons to Missouri, where he was on one occasion attacked during the actions that lead to the removal of the Mormons from that state. He then moved to Montrose, Iowa where he lived for six years. He then moved for a time to Nauvoo, Illinois. Tanner went west with the Mormons. He led the large family of his son-in-law Amasa Lyman west, since Lyman was in the advanced pioneer company. Two of Tanner's sons were in the Mormon Battalion. He settled in Cottonwood, Utah Territory where he died in 1850."

  "text" : "Joaquim Gomis Serdañons (Barcelona 1902 - 1991) was a Catalan photographer, collector, entrepreneur, and promoter of the arts. Gomis was born in Barcelona on September 19, 1902 to a wealthy family. His father owned a business in the cotton trade and his grandfather Cels Gomis (Reus, 1842 - Barcelona, 1915) was a civil engineer with intellectual interests. At the age of twelve, Gomis acquired his first camera−a Brownie−which he used to take his first photographs. In 1919 he received his degree in accounting, and beginning in 1921 he lived in England and the United States. These periods abroad enabled Gomis to produce photo series based on the architecture and urban landscapes of the places he visited. In 1929 he married Odette Cherbonnier in Paris. Joaquim Gomis was well-respected in artistic circles, which were somewhat taken aback when he began photographing the work of Gaudí, an architect who was underrated at the time. In 1930 Gomis became a founding member and the first president of the Amics de l'art nou (Friends of New Art) association and was also a founding member of Club 49 in 1949. During the Spanish Civil War, Gomis lived in Paris and traveled in Europe. In 1939, at the end of the war, he returned to Barcelona. In 1940, in collaboration with Joan Prats, Gomis published his fotoscops, a series of books with images in sequential order. Although his first series was about a eucalyptus, some of the subjects he covered were Gaudí's Sagrada Familia church, the Cathedral of Tarragona, the works of Joan Miró, and the city of Barcelona. His photographic production can be associated with the Neues Sehen movement and is considered one of the exceptions within a context dominated by pictorialism. In 1952 he was named president of the Amics de Gaudí (Friends of Gaudí) group, and from 1972 to 1975 he presided over the Fundació Joan Miró.Exhibitions of Joaquim Gomis' work include a show held at the IVAM in Valencia in 1997, with previously unpublished images from the period he spent in the United States from 1922 to 1923. Some of his works are held in the Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya."

He was a captain and an adjutant in the 1st Native veteran Battalion of the Indian Army. He exhibited his first photographs of old temples in 1857 at a meeting of the Photographic Society of Bengal, which also earned praise in the Madras Journal of Literature and Science. In 1858 he showed some negatives at a meeting of the Photographic Society of Madras. He wrote on the photographic techniques that he experimented with and suggested modifications to those followed by Captain Linnaeus Tripe and Dr. A.C. Brisbane Neill. He also published notes from the museum such as one on the Indian climbing perch and its habit. Mitchell helped establish the Museum Library which later became the Connemara Public Library, acquiring books, often second-hand to stock it. It was opened in June 1862."

  "text" : "Jayesh Manek (born 1956 in Uganda) is an Indian fund manager. He was the winner of the Sunday Times Fantasy Fund Manager competition in 1994 and 1995, beating thousands of other entrants and winning £100,000 on each occasion. This attracted the attention of John Templeton, who gave Manek £5 million to invest in July 1995 and a further £5 million in June 1996. In 1995 Manek helped found India Value Investments, a Mauritius-based investment firm investing in Indian equities. In December 1997, Manek became the first British Indian fund manager, establishing the Manek Growth Fund, a unit trust open to public investment. By 2000, having attracted over £100 million in investment to the Growth Fund, the fund was up by 160%, and worth nearly £300 million. The dot-com crash saw values crashing, and since that time Manek Growth has been a poor performer. In the 1, 3, and 10 years to 2 January 2012, Manek Growth was the worst performing fund in its sector. Heavy holdings in individual, high-risk shares has seen fund values fluctuate wildly, but the long-term trend is only down, and Manek Growth is as of 18 April 2012 worth less than its launch price. Analysis of Manek's long-term failure has noted that he made multiple entries into the Sunday Times competition and that his high-risk approach might result in big short-term gains, ideal in a competition where the only prize is for coming first (most growth), but when real money is at stake, risky."

After studying in Västerås, Uppsala and Dorpat, he graduated in Dorpat with a Master of Arts degree in 1641 and was promoted to Doctor of Theology in Uppsala in 1661. His first professorship was in Greek and oriental languages at the Dorpat university in 1642. In 1666 Gezelius published En rätt barnaklenodium [A real children's gem], which went through 70 editions over the next two centuries. In 1672 Gezelius published a three-piece Latin encyclopaedia, (Encyclopaedia synoptica: ex optimis & accuratissimis philosophorum scriptis collecta), which specifically dealt with fields of philosophy and mathematics. Encyclopaedia synoptica is considered to be Finland's first encyclopedic work. Johannes Gezelius the elder was known as an opponent of Finnish paganism and in 1673 ordered the destruction of spells."

During the winter that followed, McClure worked at a sawmill in Gimli, Manitoba and for a grain elevator company in Winnipeg. The following year, he claimed a homestead near Sturgis, Saskatchewan. In 1911, McClure married Floy Nesbit. The McClures grew grain and raised purebred Shorthorn cattle and Clydesdale horses on their farm. In 1949, they sold the farm and returned to Ontario."

John was the son of the Duke John Adolph of Schleswig-Holstein-Gottorp and the nephew of the previous Administrator John Frederick, whom he succeeded in 1634. John was the first Administrator of Lübeck to take permanent residence at Eutin Castle, which he kept expanding and expanding. He tried to draw scholars and scientists to his court and to promote the economic development of the prince-bishopric, but his efforts were hampered by the outbreak of the plague in the years 1638 and 1639, while at the same time the Thirty Years' War imposed additional burdens on the country. Thus Danish troops were quartered in the capital Eutin both in 1638/1639 and in 1643, and in December 1643 a whole Swedish Cavalry-regiment was quartered in Eutin. The Prince-Bishopric had to house and feed this regiment. During the negotiations in Osnabrück that led to the Peace of Westphalia, the existence of his Prince-Bishopric was at risk: the possibility existed that his land would be given to some other state as territorial compensation for an earlier annexation. John managed to avert this danger by carefully selecting his negotiators; first David Gloxin from Lübeck, then his councillor Christian Cassius."

In 1477, he promised the mayor and city council of Rietberg to restore their ancient rights and privileges and grant them the same rights as the city of Lippstadt. Also in 1477, John's brother Conrad travelled to Rome with John of Roden and his wife Lucke. They raised money for this journey by mortgaging Aldehof manor in Bokel. On 24 April 1481, John I and his wife Margaret joined Marienfeld Abbey, which was led by abbot John V Wineken. On 13 May 1481, John donated an altar in the abbey for the souls of his parents and siblings. As payment, he transferred the Horntemannsgut in Gütersloh parish, however, with an option to buy it back for 200 Rhenish guilders. He also donated an altar to the castle chapel in Rietberg."

  "text" : "Julien Pierre Anne Lalande (1787 in Le Mans, France – 1844 in Paris) was a French Navy officer and politician. He became one of the main actors in the Oriental Crisis of 1840 when the French Levant Squadron did not stop the Ottoman Kapudan Pasha (Grand Admiral) Ahmed Fawzi Pasha who defected with the whole Ottoman Fleet to the Sultan´s enemy Muhammad Ali of Egypt (\"Lalande affair\"). Britain and Russia supported the Ottoman Sultan and formed an alliance with Austria and Prussia against Egypt (Convention of London). France was politically isolated and, because it was threatened by a coalition of all its former enemies, France chose not to intervene when British and Austrian naval and infantry forces attacked Egyptian-held Beirut and Acre. Rear Admiral Lalande, however, offered his Prime minister Adolphe Thiers and his king Louis Philippe I a plan to stop the Russian Black Sea fleet by occupying a few Dardanelles forts, to attack and capture or destroy the Royal Navy Levant Squadron and to use the Egypt-Ottoman fleet to transport French troops for an invasion in Ireland. Lalande was called back to Toulon and removed from his command. After Thiers was replaced by François Guizot Lalande became a deputy in the French National Assembly from 1840 to 1842 and supported Guizot´s policy. \n* British Admiral Stopford was targeted as main enemy by Lalande \n* French Marine minister Roussin opposed Lalande´s plans \n* Lieutenant Jurien de La Gravière (later Admiral) was Lalande´s adjudant \n* French Prince of Joinville, son of king Louis Phillipe, was Lalande´s ally"

  "text" : "Jean Auguste Hippolyte Houzeau de Lehaie (6 March 1867 - 4 September 1959) was a Belgian biologist and horticulturist who devoted his career to the botany of bamboo species and the introduction of many into European gardening practice through his property, L'Hermitage, near Mons in the Belgian province of Hainaut. He was also a student of the temperate terrestrial orchids of Belgium and France. An inveterate traveler, he was the patron and editor of a journal devoted to bamboo, Le Bambou, which he published in 1906 to 1908. Over many decades he freely disseminated exotic bamboos to public and private gardens, testing them for hardiness in northern Europe. His archaeological interests were stimulated by the Neolithic flint mines of Spiennes, near Mons. From 1945 to 1947 he edited and published the journal La Solidarité paysanne, defending the plight of the traditional modern European farmer. The standard author abbreviation J.Houz. is used to indicate this individual as the author when citing a botanical name."

Benson studied at the University of Saskatchewan but did not graduate, instead turning to farming. In 1918, he married Hilda Ferris. He farmed near Semans. Benson was defeated when he ran for reelection to the provincial assembly in 1934 as a Farmer-Labour Group candidate. The following year, he was defeated when he ran as a CCF candidate in the Yorkton federal riding. He returned to the provincial legislature in the 1938 election as a CCF member. In 1950, after voting against the government on a number of issues, he left the CCF and sat as an independent in the assembly. Benson was defeated by Russell Brown when he ran for reelection as an independent in 1952. After leaving politics, he returned to farming, retiring in 1964. He then moved to Victoria, British Columbia where he died in 1987."

He married his cousin, Agnes Westoby in 1871, and by 1880 he was living in Stamford Hill in north London, and was a leading member of the Hackney Conservative Club. In 1882 he unsuccessfully stood for election to the London School Board. He became President of the Hackney Conservative Union, representing the party at meetings with the boundary commissioners appointed under the Redistribution of Seats Act 1885. When the first elections to the London County Council were held in January 1889, Lowles was nominated by the Conservatives to contest the Hackney Central Division. He was elected, serving three years as a member of the Conservative-backed Moderate Party that formed the opposition group. He was defeated at the next council elections in 1892, when the Liberal-backed Progressive Party increased the size of its majority. At the 1895 general election Lowles stood for election to the House of Commons as Conservative candidate at Shoreditch, Haggerston. He unseated the sitting Liberal Party member of parliament, Randal Cremer by the small margin of 31 votes. Cremer submitted an election petition to overturn the result, but following a recount Lowles was confirmed elected with an increased majority of 40 votes. Cremer returned to the courts alleging that Lowles was guilty of \"treating\", but his second petition was dismissed in February 1896. When the next general election was held in 1900, Cremer regained the Haggerston seat by a majority of 34 votes. Lowles promptly issued legal proceedings against Cremer for libel over statements made during the campaign, and was awarded damages of £750 in June 1901."

  "text" : "Jad Azkoul is a teacher and concert classical guitarist who was once the student of Abel Carlevaro, and translated much of his work. In 1997, Carlevaro declared that Azkoul was his \"genuine representative\", as well as being a \"great master teaching alongside\" him. Azkoul's father is Karim Azkoul, the Lebanese diplomat and philosopher.Azkoul is also the cousin and close friend of fellow Lebanese-American musician Paul Jabara, an esteemed Disco composer. Azkoul is renowned both as a performer and teacher; he is often invited to give masterclasses in various festivals throughout the world. () Jad Azkoul was awarded the Order of the Cedar, making him a Knight of Lebanon, for his musical contributions to the country. Joseph McLellan, of the Washington Post, had this to say on the subject of Jad Azkoul's guitar-playing: “Azkoul can make his instrument sing. This is a skill far more important than the ability to whip out thousands of notes per minute accurately and expressively, which he can also do.” On another occasion, McLellan was quoted as saying: \"The guitar can be many different kinds of instrument, and Azkoul is a master of all its potentials: the raw power of the amplified guitar used in rock (which is how Azkoul began as a boy in his native Lebanon), the delicacies of music composed for the lute, the fire and energy of Flamenco, the rhythmic complexities of Latin American dances and the experimental techniques of modern composers.\" Jad Azkoul has been teaching at the Conservatoire Populaire de Musique, Danse et Théàtre (CPMDT) in Geneva since 1984. Two notable absences were when he lived and taught in Washington DC from 1991 to 1996, and when he was in London on sabbatical leave (2010-2011). In fact since 2010 he has also been on the music faculty at the London College of Music. He gives regular summer master classes in France at \"Musicalta\" in Alsace and at the \"Musicales de Grillon\" in the Provence."

  "text" : "Johann Christian Cuno (3 April 1708 in Berlin – 1783 in Durlach) was a German poet, writer, botanist and merchant, and was the son of a postal official in Berlin. He was also known under the names of Joan Christian Cuno, Johannes Christian Cuno and Johann Christ Cuno. He was tutored at home, among others by the Silesian poet Johann Christian Günther. Despite wanting to enrol at Halle University, he was conscripted in 1724, but managed in 1727 to obtain Royal permission to study, not theology, as he had hoped, but law. After a year he was obliged to rejoin his regiment as a common soldier. Promoted to sergeant in 1731, he travelled to Croatia, Slavonia, Hungary and Italy as recruiting officer, taking up 10 years of his life. During his military service he never lost his love for the sciences, but only met up with scholars again in 1740 in Rome. From Rome he went to Amsterdam, arriving destitute and facing a harsh winter. There he supported himself by proofreading for a bookseller, as well as giving lessons in languages and in music. In 1741 he made the acquaintance of and married a widow Völkers, whose husband had been a merchant. He restored the business to its former efficiency, and consequently had time to return to the sciences and his love of poetry. Cuno counted many Dutch poets amongst his friends and translated a number of their works into German or 'High Dutch' as it was then known. On a property outside Amsterdam he started a botanical garden and grew exotic plants, which were listed as a supplement by Büttner to Cuno's \"Ode über seinen Garten\" (1749). Cuno corresponded with Linnaeus, who honoured him by creating the plant genus Cunonia. David Sigismundus Augustus Büttner (1724-1768), commemorated in Buettneria, was a Hungarian botanist, professor of medicine and botany at the Collegium medico-chirurgicum Berlin, and later professor of botany and zoology at the University of Göttingen. After Cuno's wife died in 1761, he entered the service of the Dutch East India Company. One of Cuno's friends in Amsterdam was the philosopher and mystic Emanuel Swedenborg. Cuno had heard about Swedenborg and wanted to meet him, but was hesitant and doubted his respectability. Even so, Cuno wrote that he first met the Swede by chance in a bookshop toward the end of 1768. He found that Swedenborg spoke both French and German, though haltingly, and that despite his wealth he boarded with a young couple and lived a spartan life. Cuno thought of introducing him to his card-playing friends, but the Swede's strict bedtime and inability to converse in Dutch, made the idea unworkable. Cuno finally retired to Weingarten near Durlach. Amongst his writings that deserve mention were the poem \"Versuch eines moralischen Briefes an seinen Enkel und Pflegesohn\", as well as his 1762 \"Messiah\" in twelve cantos. Although not a great poet his works were read with pleasure, as is shown by the numerous editions published, and by his being elected a fellow of the Deutschen Gesellschaft in Göttingen. His motto Juste, Candide, Caute (Justice, Sincerity, Caution), the Latin initials echoing his own, appears below his engraved portrait."

  "text" : "Justin Girod-Chantrans (26 September 1750, Besançon – 1 April 1841, Besançon) was a French naturalist known for his pioneer research in the field of phycology. Following studies with the Jesuits, he entered the Ecole du Génie militaire in 1768. Several years later, he attained the title of captain (1777), subsequently serving at different military posts (including Santo Domingo) until 1791. Around 1786, he developed an interest in natural history. In 1799 he founded the Société d'agriculture, commerce et arts in Besançon. He then became involved in politics, being elected to the legislature in 1802. Beginning in 1810, he devoted all his time and energy to natural sciences. He described a number of phycological species; Haematococcus lacustris, Volvox lacustris and Conferva mammiformis being a few examples."

He moved to Zurich in 1921 together with his mother, following his father's death. He worked as a delivery apprentice. He spent some time in Basel too. Jakob Lüthi joined the Young Communist League of Switzerland in 1929. In the following year his mother married the German communist parliamentarian Georg Lechleiter, and Jakob and his mother moved to Germany. Jakob adopted his stepfather's family name (his stepfather was executed in 1942). In the communist movement, Jakob's nom de guerre was Tomi. In 1933 he was expelled from Germany. He travelled back to Switzerland along with an Alsatian woman, Rosel Iltis, whom he married two years later. Early in 1934 Lechleiter clandestinely re-entered Germany for two months. He also travelled to Moscow, where he obtained political training. Lechleiter became the secretary of the Young Communist League of Switzerland in 1934, a position he held until 1937. He did however come into conflict with the party leader Jules Humbert-Droz. Lechleiter served as the Zurich canton secretary of the Swiss Party of Labour between 1945 and 1956, and as national secretary of the party between 1966 and 1978 (as part of a triumvirate along with Jean Vincent and André Muret). Lechleiter represented the party at different international events, such as the 1969 International Meeting of Communist and Workers Parties in Moscow and the 1976 Conference of Communist and Workers Parties of Europe in East Berlin."

Educated at Bedford School and then King's College, Durham (now part of Newcastle University), Hennessy aged 21 joined the Royal Artillery in 1942, later being seconded to the Indian Army in 1944 until 1946. After the War, Hennessy joined what was then HM Overseas Service, serving initially in Basutoland, South Africa from 1948 in a number of roles, seconded in 1961 to the Office of the High Commissioner in Pretoria and taking on a number of positions in the government of South Africa. He retired from the Overseas Service in 1968 and was appointed to the Foreign Office, serving as Chargé d'Affaires to Montevideo, Uruguay for 1971–72, and then High Commissioner to Kampala, Uganda and non-resident Ambassador to Kigali, Rwanda, 1973–76.

In 1982, Hennessy was appointed as the second ever HM Chief Inspector of Prisons, taking over from Bill Pearce, previously the Chief Inspector of Probation for Inner London whose tenure as HMCIP was cut short by illness. James Hennessey served a five-year term until 1987. After stepping down as Chief Inspector to be replaced by Judge Sir Stephen Tumim, Hennessy served on the Parole Board for England and Wales until 1991 and as a Trustee of the Butler Trust until 1998.

Emmett was born in Boone County, Kentucky. He was baptized into the Church of Christ in 1831 and in August 1832 he moved to Jackson County, Missouri to live with the gathering of Latter Day Saints there. He was a missionary for the church in Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Ohio, and Missouri. In 1843, Emmett was living in Nauvoo, Illinois and was a bodyguard and close associate of Joseph Smith. In February 1844, Smith selected Emmett to explore the western United States and to select a location that the Latter Day Saints could settle in. Emmett was added to Smith's Council of Fifty in March 1844. When Smith was killed later in 1844, Emmett claimed that he had been empowered by Smith to lead the Latter Day Saints away from Nauvoo to a new settlement. Brigham Young and the other church apostles attempted to convince Emmett that Young should lead the church, but Emmett gathered approximately 100 followers and the party made its way to present-day Vermillion, South Dakota. Young and the other apostles dropped Emmett from the ranks of the Council of Fifty in 1845. By 1846, Emmett returned to Young and pledged to follow his leadership. In 1849, Emmett traveled to Utah Territory, but shortly thereafter he left the Latter Day Saint church and moved to Tuolumne County, California. He later moved to San Bernardino, where he died."

McPike’s photographic work has been featured on the BBC website, the Nomade Arts Gallery in Miami, U.S.A. and the West Hill Gallery in Nassau, Bahamas. To commemorate the opening of THINK Global School in 2010, she created an outdoor photo installation that accompanied the school during its residencies in Stockholm, Sydney, and Beijing. The exhibit was placed in prominent pedestrian areas and featured documentary style photos from the THINK coffee table book, celebrating the themes of tolerance, diversity, and self-reflection that inspire McPike’s school in its unique mission."

The painter Jean-Joseph Sanfourche St Léonard de Noblat where he lived since 1975. He was a prominent figure in art brut. he was a friend of Gaston Chaissac, Jean Dubuffet, Robert Doisneau,.Jean Joseph Sanfourche is now celebrated worldwide, the United States to Japan via Switzerland or Italy. Born June 25, 1929, in Bordeaux, he lived his early years in Rochefort (Charente-Maritime),his father was a mechanic for Maryse Bastié, where his father, Arthur, taught him the basics of drawing and painting. This father-resistant, was shot by the Germans. The family then leaves to take refuge in Limoges, where the young boy learns wood sculpture and industrial design to professional National School. Jean-Joseph Sanfourche, begins to paint, despite an eye disease that cripples the irreversible, but he did make an important meeting at Ivry-sur-Seine hospital, that of the writer Antonin Artaud. His professional activities (accounting, business executive), the lead in Brive in Alger to Paris. In Périgord, Belvès he lives after Bourdeilles.After spending twenty years in Paris, where he spent several years in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, responsible for investing in African stock in French universities; he settled a decade in Solignac, then in 1975 in Saint-Léonard-de-Noblat. I'm not an artist, but a man who makes things on the edge of the art and magic of the caves, \"said Jean Joseph himself Sanfourche this singular figure who converses with stones, believed very humor and fervor mixed with the power of talismans, and loves to paint on pieces of bone and flint ... This old half-blind recluse has exhibited in Japan, Switzerland, America and Germany, and Unesco has even recently screened a film retrospective of this strange life, halfway between the artist, the child and the shaman film called \"I, Sanfourche.\" Visually impaired, Sanfourche implements in his art his obsession with the look. His characters come alive, married to matter in vivid colors of life. Under the apparent ease of the cut shapes and the areas of color, however hides a slow process of purification of preparatory drawings. The work of Sanfourche is now celebrated around the world, from the United States to Japan through Switzerland and Italy this rare artist, unconventional, has transmitted its characters to the schematic traits and round eyes strength and simplicity breathed his ill-voyancethis simple heart is pleased to have sold a series of bronzes to the great Tina Turner in person! it is known for the song in GoldenEye, james bond then tables Elton John has or had offered to Raymond Poulidor, two of the most famous inhabitants of Saint Léonard de Noblat, who posed for posterity, during a friendly meeting and delivered a work of Raymond Poulidor making tribute to his sporting achievements. He lived by and for its works imbued with a subtle humor, derision and delicious poetry that touch the sacred and magic, a spiritual dimension that invites us to let go with time. Paints, enamels, sculptures... he leaves a wonderful legacy, recognizable at first glance, much appreciated by the neophyte recognized scholar. He rests in the cemetery of Limoges."

  "text" : "Jean Florimond Boudon de Saint-Amans (24 June 1748, Agen – 28 October 1831, Agen) was a French naturalist and antiquarian. He was the author of works involving agriculture, botany and antiquities. At the age of 18 he joined the infantry regiment of Vermandois, of which he participated in journeys to the Caribbean. In 1773, he left the military, married a wealthy heiress, and moved back to his hometown of Agen. In 1794 he became a member of the board of agriculture to the Ministry of the Interior, and two years later was appointed professor of natural history at Ecole centrale de Lot-et-Garonne. From 1800 until his death in 1831, he served a president of the General Council of Lot-et-Garonne."

  "text" : "Jean Ruel (1474 – 24 September 1537), also known as Jean Ruelle or Ioannes Ruellius in its Latinised form, was a French physician and botanist noted for the 1536 publication in Paris of De Natura Stirpium, a Renaissance treatise on botany. Ruel was born in Soissons. He was self-taught in Greek and Latin, and studied medicine, graduating in 1508, or, according to other sources in 1502. In 1509 he became physician to Francis I, devoted himself at the same time to a study of botany and pharmacology. He was a professor at the University of Paris, and a large part of his academic career was given to an analysis of Dioscorides' De Materia Medica, of which he published a Latin translation in 1516. Ruel's three-volume De Natura Stirpium, which was published without illustrations, was intended partly as a gloss to the ancient writers. In it he described in great detail not only the habit and habitat, but also the smell and taste of each plant, producing a list in French of a large number of plant names. Although some of his works were compilations or translations of previous authors, they represent the first attempt to popularise botany. His 1530 book Hippiatrika or Veterinariae medicinae, commissioned by Francis I, is a Latin collation of all that was written in Greek of Veterinary Medicine. Ruel also produced anatomical fugitive sheets of a man and woman in 1539. These sheets were constructed of hinged layers which could be lifted so that internal human anatomy was revealed. Ruell translated a large number of works into Latin, such as the last two volumes of Joannes Actuarius' De Methodo Medendi, which he published under the title De Medicamentorum Compositione in 1539. After the death of Ruel's wife, Étienne de Poncher the Bishop of Paris, appointed Ruel as canon at Notre Dame de Paris on 12 December 1526, enabling him to pursue his studies. Ruel died in Paris and was buried in Notre-Dame. Charles Plumier, the noted Marseilles botanist named the genus Ruellia in his honour."

Van Angelbeek was born in East Frisia in 1727 and in 1754 travelled to India and Batavia, returning to the Netherlands in 1755. In 1756, he joined the Dutch East India Company returning to the Indian Ocean and serving as a merchant at Batavia and in Bengal. In 1764 he took an official position in the capital of Dutch Ceylon at Colombo and in 1767 moved to the port of Tuticorin in India, serving as Koopman and eventually becoming senior official of the port in 1770, retaining the position until 1783. In 1783, Van Angelbeek was made governor of Malabar, and in 1787 was appointed as the governor of all Dutch India. In 1794, during the French Revolutionary Wars, Van Angelbeek took command of the Dutch colony of Ceylon, and was in command when a British expeditionary force arrived the following year. Most of the Dutch ports fell rapidly, Colombo the last to surrender in February 1796. He remained in Colombo during the British occupation, dying in 1799. He was the last Dutch governor of the colony as the British retained it for 152 years. He was married to Jacomina Lever and had two children, both his son Christian and his son-in-law Willem Jacob van de Graaf were prominent in the administration of the Dutch Indian Ocean colonies."

  "text" : "John Kingsbury Frost (c. 1922 - 1990) was an American physician specializing in the field of cytopathology - the microscopic study of individual body cells to detect cancer and other diseases. The first area of the body to be studied in this way was the female genital tract, using the Pap smear invented by Georgios Papanikolaou. Frost and other physicians expanded the field to allow for cytopathologic evaluation of the lung, bladder, and many other body sites. Frost was best known as a teacher of cytopathology. He organized and directed a school of cytotechnology and created and led a postgraduate Institute to teach the techniques to physicians."

  "text" : "Jean Brossel (15 August 1918 – 4 February 2003) was a French physicist known for his work on quantum optics. He was born and died in Périgueux. Brossel passed the entrance exam for l'École normale supérieure (ENS) 1938, but then was for two years a soldier. From 1941 to 1945 he studied at the ENS under Alfred Kastler and then went to the group of Samuel Tolansky in Manchester spending the years 1945–1948 and in 1948 to Francis Bitter at MIT. In 1951 for work done at MIT, Brossel received his PhD in Paris under Kastler with a thesis on the application of double resonance methods (developed by Kastler and him) to the study of the excited states of Hg. After completing his PhD, Brossel was attaché des recherches and then Maître de Recherches at CNRS. In 1955 he became a professor at the Faculté des Sciences in Paris (and later a professor at the University of Pierre and Marie Curie (Universitie Paris VI)). From 1973 to 1985 he was Director of the Physics Faculty of ENS. In 1985 he retired and went to the University of Paris. Brossel is known for his work on optical pumping with Alfred Kastler, with whom he founded in 1951 the spectroscopic laboratory at ENS (Laboratoire de Spectroscopie Hertzienne), which now is called the Laboratoire Kastler-Brossel. Brossel was the co-director and then in 1972 after Kastler's resignation the director. In his hometown of Périgueux a square is named after him. In 1960 Brossel won the Holweck Prize and in 1977 he was elected a member of l'Académie des sciences, whose Prix Ampère he received in 1974. In 1984 he received the gold medal of CNRS."

The cottage was of Jacobean origin, with an ornamental doorway, surmounted by a stone lintel, carved into which was “1684” and “T” and “I.R.”, being the date the cottage was built and the initials of the owners/builders. She appeared to live alone, and was, as such, probably wrinkled and a \"little odd\", which is why she was considered to be a witch by many of the local country-folk. No one knows when she died, and the only “definite?” fact is that she lived in the seventeenth century and is thought to be buried in the corner of a field at Greenhead, near Carterway Heads. She is mentioned in “Ode to the River Derwent”, a poem of some 40 verses by John Carr which appears in The Bishoprick Garland of 1834 by Sir Cuthbert Sharp."

  "text" : "Juan de Dios Aldea (1853–1879) was a Chilean sailor. His remains rest in the crypt of the Monument to the Heroes of the Battle of Iquique, in Valparaíso. He was born in a modest family. He was the son of professor Jose Manuel Aldea and Ursula Fonseca. His childhood was spent in Santiago with his paternal grandparents, Juan de Dios Aldea and Maria Antonieta Contreras. At the age of 8 he enrolled in the Franciscan School of Chillán, directed by his father, where he distinguished himself with his excellent handwriting and his evident interest for military exercises. After living for four years with his aunt, on August 1, 1872, he enrolled as a volunteer soldier in the Financial Commission sent by the Navy's Artillery Battalion; an organization located in Valparaiso which depended on the General Command of the Chilean Navy. In this battalion, he also served as a chief. He stayed in the First Company of that battalion for two years. In April 1874 he was sent on commission to Valdivia and on May 11 was promoted to 2nd Corporal. On January 1, 1876 he was promoted to 1st Corporal, and a year later to 2nd Sergeant. In June 1877 he boards the corvette \"Esmeralda\" In February 1878 he is transferred to the pontoon \"Thalaba,\" and, after staying a month, he returns to the First Company of the Battalion. In October he came back to \"Thalaba\" and in December returned to the Company of the Battalion, being transferred to the post of Guard of the Municipality of Valparaíso. Due to his impeccable service record, upon the declaration of the War of the Pacific, he is transferred to the corvette \"Esmeralda\". On May 21, 1879, he found himself on board the \"Esmeralda\", which, along with the \"Covadonga\", completed the blockade of the Peruvian port of Iquique. After the crow's nest of the \"Covadonga\" spotted the Peruvian ships \"Huascar\" and \"Independencia\", Aldea found the Esmerelda's gunners and took over their combat post. After an hour of combat the first ramming by the \"Huascar\" occurs, ordered by Commander Miguel Grau Seminario."

  "text" : "Jules-Antoine Castagnary (11 April 1830 – 11 May 1888) was a French liberal politician, journalist and progressive and influential art critic, who embraced the new term \"Impressionist\" in his positive and perceptive review of the first Impressionist show, in Le Siècle, 29 April 1874. Born at Saintes, Charente-Maritime, in the west of France, Castagnary lived in Paris, where he contributed to Le Monde illustré, Le Siècle and Le Nain jaune, a political journal of Liberal tendencies. He reviewed the annual Paris salons from 1857 to 1879. He organized the provincial Republican press at the time of the Siege of Paris (1870-1871). After the collapse of the French Second Empire, Castagnary, who was an anti-clerical republican, developed a secondary political career. He became a member of the municipal council of Paris (1874), was the director of the École nationale supérieure des Beaux-Arts (1887), and sat on the Conseil d'État (1879) and the Comité des monuments historiques. He was appointed to a ministerial post in the short-lived Léon Gambetta cabinet in 1881, but resigned when that ministry fell 1 January 1882. His portrait by his intimate friend Gustave Courbet (1870), whose art Castagnary championed from the first and whose radical role during the Paris Commune Castagnary defended after Courbet's death, is now in the Musée d'Orsay, Paris. The correspondence between the two men is a fundamental document in analyzing Courbet's life and output. At the time of his death in Paris, Castagnary was engaged in a full-length biography of Courbet, left incomplete; he is buried in the Cimetière de Montmartre, Paris."

Von Erberg was born in Ljubljana. After graduating from mathematics, logics, philosophy, and administrative law, he was at first a board councillor at the Carniolan Provincial Estates. In 1794, he married Josephine, Gräfin von Attems. They had seven children. In 1804, he became a chamberlain at the Austrian Court, and was from 1809 until 1814 the educator of the young Ferdinand I of Austria. In 1815, von Erberg moved to Dol pri Ljubljani, where he intensively collected books and numerous other cultural and natural objects from Carniola and also created a garden with over 7000 plants. He was a friend of Sigmund Zois and also corresponded with other Carniolan scientists and artists. Until the end of his life, he only rarely left Dol. In 1832, he hired Franz Franz, an officer, to inform him about events in Vienna and in Ljubljana. In the following eight years, Franz sent him about 1800 letters, which have been preserved until today and give an insight in the history of Ljubljana before the 1848 revolutions. In 1825, von Erberg wrote the Attempt at a Sketch of the Literary History of Carniola (German: Versuch eines Entwurfes zu einer Literar-Geschichte für Crain), which he intended for his personal use. It consists of twelve questions about the literary history of his homeland and extensive answers to them. Even today, it represents a source of information about the older Slovenian literary history."

  "text" : "James \"Jim\" Marker (c. 1922 – May 2, 2012) was an American-born Canadian businessman who invented Cheezies, a brand of cheese curl snack food popular in Canada. Marker also established the Belleville Aerodrome, a private airport, in 1961. Marker was born in Dayton, Ohio. Marker, who was originally a farmer, worked within the confectionery industry in Chicago, Illinois, for many years. However, Marker invented a new machine used to process cornmeal. The machine caught the attention of Marker's business partner, W.T. Hawkins. Together, Marker and Hawkins moved to Canada and founded the W. T. Hawkin Company in 1949, which manufactures the Cheezies snack. Marker and Hawkin originally started their new company in Tweed, Ontario, to take advantage of the areas railroads to ship their Cheezies. A fire destroyed their original Tweed factory in 1956, and they relocated to their company's current location in Belleville, Ontario. They concentrated exclusively on Cheezies after dropping other snack foods from their portfolio. Marker designed the machine used to create Cheezies, which shaped the snacks, cooked them in vegetable shortening, and coated the snacks with aged cheddar. No two Cheezies pieces are exactly alike. Marker's original machine is still used to manufacture Cheezies at the company's plant, as of 2012. Marker remained Vice President of the W. T. Hawkin Company until his death in 2012. He last visited the Cheezies factory for a surprise inspection in March 2012. Outside of the snack food industry, Marker established the Belleville Aerodrome in Ontario in 1961. He frequently used the airport to fly his Apache plane. Marker died on May 2, 2012, at his home in Belleville, Ontario, at the age of 90. The W. T. Hawkin’s Cheezies factory closed for the remainder of the day upon news of Marker's death."

He was married to Evelina Danby, who is generally accepted to be the illegitimate daughter of J.M.W. Turner and his mistress Sarah Danby (1766–1861). Together, they had seven children: Son: name unknown (1819-c1819), Daughter: Evelina Sarah Margaritta Dupuis(1821-c1821?), Son: William Dupuis (1823-c1823?), Daughter: Rosalie Adelaide Dupuis (1825–1900), Son: Joseph Hutton Dupuis (1827–1903), Son: Hanmer Lewis Dupuis (1829–1911), Daughter: Evelina Louisa Dupuis (1832-after 1875). Joseph Dupuis was a man of the highest reputation among his peers.

  "text" : "Joseph \"Joe\" Mayo (born 25 May 1952 in Tipton, Staffordshire, England) is a retired English professional footballer who played as a striker. He was born in Tipton in 1951 and was a pupil at Horseley Heath infant and junior schools before attending Tipton Grammar School from 1962 to 1967. He then played for several local sides and in the 1971-72 had an unsuccessful trial with Football League side Oxford United, before finally getting his first professional contract in September 1972, aged 21, with Walsall. He made seven senior appearances for the Fellows Park side in a five-month spell before he was sold to West Bromwich Albion for £17,000 in February 1973. He made his senior debut in the Second Division against Hull City in September that year and became a first team regular in the 1974-75 season. However, he lost his place in the first team three seasons later and was sold to Orient, back in the Second Division, in February 1978. He helped the unfancied East London side reach the semi-finals of the FA Cup that season, and continued to do well over the next few seasons, totalling 40 goals in 177 games for the club. He left Brisbane Road in September 1981, transferring to Cambridge United for £100,000. He was loaned to Blackpool in the autumn of 1982, where he played five League games and scored one goal, followed by a spell in Hong Kong with Happy Valley United the following summer. He was appointed assistant manager of Welsh side Caernarfon Town in 1986 but left the following year. In his entire playing career, Mayo played more than 300 senior games and scored 75 goals. He has since worked as a hotelier in North Wales."

  "text" : "Jon Samseth, born July 23, 1954 in Trondheim, Norway, is a Norwegian engineer and professor of physics. He was awarded an engineering degree in physics (siv.ing.) from the Norwegian Institute of Technology (NTH) (now Norwegian University of Science and Technology, NTNU) in 1981. He later earned a Diplôme d'ingénieur degree in Petroleum economics from the École Nationale Supérieure du Pétrole et des Moteurs (ENSPM) in France in 1983. He received his PhD in physics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in 1988. Samseth is a professor of energy physics at the Oslo and Akershus University College as well as a scientific advisor to SINTEF materials and chemistry. In addition, he served as an adjunct professor (professor II) in the Department of Chemical engineering at NTNU from 2007 to 2015. Samseth has focused his research broadly in the field of soft matter. Within this field, he has used neutron scattering to study a variety of surfactant-containing systems, including micelles and microemulsions, aerogels and block-copolymers. Since 2004 he has been engaged in the study of nanostructured polymer-membranes applied to gas separation. Samseth has been actively involved internationally through the International Union of Pure and Applied Physics (IUPAP). He was member of IUPAP’s first energy working group in which they assessed viability of various energy sources. In 2012, IUPAP commissioned him to chair and form a new working group devoted to energy topics at large.He was also a member of the Scientific Committee on Problems of the Environment's (SCOPE) biofuels rapid assessment group and has been the president of SCOPE since 2014. From 2010 to 2013 he has been a scientific advisor to the yearbook team of UNEP (United Nations Environment Programme) and participated as a member of the writing team. In the 2012 yearbook, he was responsible for the chapter on the decommissioning of nuclear reactors. Currently, Samseth is actively involved in the public debate on energy issues, most notably those related to nuclear energy, and gives public lectures on these topics as well. He raises ethical and environmental concerns connected to energy issues and advocates that nuclear energy is an integral part of a modern energy system. Because of his experience in energy topics, he is frequently featured in the media, particularly when nuclear energy concerns the public (such as during the Fukushima accident in Japan.) In 2012 professor Samseth was elected member of the Norwegian Academy of Technological Sciences (NTVA)."

One author said of him, \"Like fellow Australian Greg Smallman, Redgate builds his (lattice braced) guitars with an arched back to improve their volume and projection, and he uses lightweight carbon fiber reinforcements under the soundboard. While not as thin as a Smallman's, Redgate's soundboards are much lighter than traditionally braced examples, and his guitars are therefore more responsive, energy efficient, and louder than traditional classical instruments."

Until April 2013 he played the men's doubles together with Dave Khodabux (highest achieved world ranking 32). From that moment on he only played the mixed doubles with Samantha Barning who was his partner in this discipline since 2012 and with whom he achieved world ranking 24 in about a year’s time. In September 2013, Barning got seriously injured, the reason why they couldn’t play a considerable number of tournaments. Therefore, they fell far back on the world ranking. In February 2014 they started to play international tournaments again and came in third place at the European Championships in Kazan, Russia. His highest achieved ranking in the mixed doubles was 16. De Ruiter trained full-time at the Dutch National Sports Centre Papendal. He was chairman of the Athletes council of the Dutch Badminton Association and he has a bachelor's degree in sports marketing at Johan Cruyff University in Amsterdam."

Until recently, little was known of his life. Representative of a class of late medieval \"humanist knights\", he was associated with the court of García Álvarez de Toledo, 1st Duke of Alba and may have been the nephew of the noble Pedro Alvarez Osorio. In 1476, he was appointed official chronicler to the monarchs Fernando and Isabella; among his other political activities, he may have participated in the civil war of the 1470s and in Grenada. \"Until Cervantes... Juan de Flores was one of the most widely read Spanish authors in Europe\", and the European popularity of his Grisel y Mirabella (which had at least 56 editions in several languages before Cervantes' time) was on a par with Diego de San Pedro's Cárcel de amor and Fernando de Rojas's La Celestina."

The physical presentation of the work, including the installation space and the logistics of speakers, are also deliberate choices for Webb.

  "text" : "Johannes Zorn (1739 Kempten - 1799) was a German pharmacist, botanist and botanical illustrator. After his studies in pharmacy, Zorn became an apothecary in his hometown. He made extensive trips across Europe to collect medicinal plants, and between 1779 and 1790 published 6 volumes of \"Icones plantarum medicinalium\" in Nuremberg in which he illustrated and described over 600 medicinal plants. Later in 1796 this was published as the six-volume \"Afbeeldingen der Artseny-Gewassen met Derzelver Nederduitsche en Latynsche Beschryvingen\" in Amsterdam by J. C. Sepp & Zoon. It was illustrated by 600 handcoloured engraved plates, the Dutch text being from Martinus Houttuyn`s \"Natuurlijke Historie\". A rare 1813 supplement by Adolphus Ypey also contains 100 plates. A further supplement of 12 plates and 12 pages of text was published later. He was passionate about the flora of the New World and published \"Dreyhundert auserlesene amerikanische Gewachse\" with 250 coloured plates, the majority after Jacquin's \"Selectarum Stirpium Americanarum Historia\". Jacquin was associated with the gardens of Schoenbrunn as a result of being deputed by the emperor Francis I to gather exotic plants from America for cultivating in the palace grounds. Hundreds of plants from the Caribbean found their way to the palace and led to the publishing in 1763 of Jacquin's edition which was beautifully illustrated, but prohibitively expensive. Zorn's more affordable version shows hand-coloured plates smaller than the original engravings. He is commemorated in the genus Zornia and is denoted by the author abbreviation Zorn when citing a botanical name."

This granted him and his heirs sole navigation rights from Bridgwater to Ham Mills, and allowed him to improve the river at his own expense. He saw this as a philanthropic action, as it reduced the price of coal to the poor people of Taunton, as well as improving the transport infrastructure. He died in 1644 and was buried in Bath Abbey.

He experienced a religious conversion in 1782, and was baptised by John Rippon in the Baptist meeting-house in Carter Lane, Tooley Street, Southwark, on 11 May 1783. He subsequently became a Baptist minister in Walworth from 1792 until his death in 1796. He was a popular preacher, and during the period of his ministry it became necessary to extend the church building on three occasions. He was also a writer of devotional poems and hymns, many of which remained popular through the 19th century, although now largely forgotten. Many were published under the collective title Walworth Hymns in 1792. A version of his hymn \"My Song in the Night\" was included on the album Come, Thou Fount of Every Blessing released by the Mormon Tabernacle Choir in 2009. Swain died aged 35 on 16 April 1796. He was buried in Bunhill Fields burial ground in London. His headstone, recovered from its original site following bomb damage in World War II, is now located next to those of William Blake and Daniel Defoe."

Vanderheyden hoped to benefit from the Flamenpolitik instituted by the Germans, as Belgian cinema had traditionally been dominated by English and French language films. Vanderheyden made his last film in 1942, after which Belgian feature film production was suspended due to an increasing shortage of Film stock.

The B-15 is considered a big part of the melodic bass parts which are widely considered essential to The Motown Sound in addition to the Fender Precision Bass, and the various musicians who wrote and performed the bass lines in the studio on many hit records as well as during live shows. Along with the Fender Precision Bass, the B-15 was the primary amplifier used by James Jamerson, who, as a member of The Funk Brothers, \"played on more number-one hits than The Beatles, Elvis Presley, The Rolling Stones, and The Beach Boys combined.\" in addition to many other highly notable bass players at various points during their careers including Chuck Rainey, Bob Babbitt, Justin Meldal-Johnsen and many others. After leaving Ampeg, Oliver went on to form Oliver Sound Company, where he continued to design and market amplifiers. After a time, he decided to scale down the operation and instead operate Oliver Sound as an amplifier repair shop out of his basement in Massapequa, New York, which he operated until his death in 2011."

  "text" : "Jack Irwin Hale (8 June 1922 – 29 February 2008) was an English competitive swimmer who represented Great Britain in the Olympic Games and England in the British Empire Games. When London hosted the 1948 Summer Olympics, he competed in three events. His best finish was seventh in the event final of the men's 400-metre freestyle. He also swam in the preliminary heats of the 1,500-metre freestyle and the 4x200-metre freestyle relay, but did not advance in either event. At the 1950 British Empire Games held in Auckland, New Zealand, Hale won a gold medal as a member of the England's winning team in the men's 3x100-yard medley relay, together with Pat Kendall and Roy Romain. He also received a bronze medal with the third-place English team of Donald Bland, Pat Kendall and Ray Legg in the men's 4x220-yard freestyle relay. Individually, he also competed in the preliminary heats of the 440-yard freestyle event. Hale missed the 1952 Summer Olympics, following an accident in which he suffered broken ribs when a diver landed on top of him. Afterward he retired from competitive swimming, and became a swimming instructor and coach in his hometown of Kingston upon Hull, working for nearly 40 years with his wife Valerie, teaching local children to swim. He died in Hull in 2008."

  "text" : "John Dair (3 March 1933 – 25 November 2005) was a Scottish actor who appeared in many television productions over a 25-year period. Large and burly in appearance, he is perhaps best remembered for his roles as Harry Grout’s bodyguard ‘Crusher’ in the sitcom Porridge and as Charlie Dawson in the drama Our Friends in the North. Although born in Dundee, Scotland, he had been a resident of London, England, for many years. He drove mobile cranes and bulldozers on building sites and then worked as a singer until he was offered the part in Porridge whilst performing at the Lyceum Theatre, London. He then went on to appear in one of the most memorable scenes in the sitcom in which his character displays a 'sense of humour failure' when a joke is repeated to him. He also had small parts in films, the most memorable of which was in Batman as crime boss Vinnie Ricorso, who is fatally stabbed in the throat with a quill pen by the Joker. In 1984 he appeared in the iconic music video for the Frankie Goes to Hollywood song Relax as a man dressed as a Roman emperor in a gay nightclub. He also appeared in commercials including the acclaimed 1985 advertisement for Levi Strauss & Co. jeans with Nick Kamen that was set in a Laundromat. He died of lung cancer in 2005."

He became the Democratic nominee for Baltimore mayor in April 1907, defeating opponents John Charles Linthicum and George Stewart Brown. In May 1907, he defeated incumbent Republican mayor E. Clay Timanus. In 1910, Mahool signed city ordinance No. 610 prohibiting African-Americans from moving onto blocks where whites were the majority, and vice versa. Mahool had been an advocate for social justice, championing causes such as woman's suffrage, but the ordinance came in response to an uproar after George W.F. McMechen, an African-American Yale law school graduate, moved into a rich (white) neighborhood. The ordinance was rapidly declared unconstitutional. Mahool lost a re-election bid in 1911 in the primary, losing to James H. Preston. Mahool died in Baltimore on July 29, 1935, nine days after suffering a fall in Ocean City, Maryland."

MacFarlane then settled on a farm near Carlea, Saskatchewan, where he raised Clydesdale horses, Shorthorn cattle, Yorkshire pigs, Shropshire sheep and Barred Rock chickens. He also served on the Alysham School Board. In 1920, he married Jean Gray. MacFarlane was defeated by Oakland Woods Valleau when he ran for reelection in 1938.

Graham, a former director of a Glasgow bank, having learnt the basics of photography, arrived in Jerusalem in December 1853 and stayed there for two-and-a-half years, taking lodgings in a tower on the Mount of Olives. While there he was visited by artists including Thomas Seddon and William Holman Hunt, both of whom seem to have used his photographs as reference material for their paintings. When he exhibited photographs, he would often write an appropriate quotation from the Bible on the mount. During his time in Jerusalem he taught photography to the Russian-born Mendel John Diness, who had been converted from Judaism, and baptised in 1849 by the British consul James Finn. He was the author of a pamphlet called Jerusalem; its Missions, Schools, Converts etc. under Bishop Gobat published in London in 1858."

He proposes an alternative path for China: Constitutional Confucianism, also known as Political Confucianism, or Institutional Confucianism, through the trilateral parliament framework.

He holds an MA from Oxford University and an MSc from Sussex University in the UK, and was elected a Fellow of the Royal Geographical Society in London in 1990. He is a life member of the British Humanist Association. He has travelled extensively in Central Asia and Southern Asia, researching Zoroastrianism and other religions. According to his publishers his book Beyond Belief took over 20 years of research, including an overland expedition from Europe to South and Central Asia, retracing journeys of Alexander the Great, Robert Byron and Eric Newby. This research took him to sites including Medjugorje in Herzegovina; traditional Bogomil sites in the Balkans, early Christian sites across Turkey, the Mountains of Ararat near the border with Iran, Zoroastrian Towers of Silence, Chak Chak and other Zoroastrian centres in Iran, Christian churches in Pakistan, Parsee temples in Mumbi, the Syrian Churches of Kerala, the Roza Bal shrine at Srinagar in Kashmir; Lumbini in the Rupandehi district of Nepal; early Buddhist sites along the Karakorum Highway, and historic religious sites of Tajikistan and Uzbekistan. He writes extensively on a range of topics including Gnostic Dualism, the Cathars of the Languedoc, the Counts of Toulouse, Occitania, Medieval warfare and the Medieval Inquisition. His work is characterised by combining serious scholarship with an entertaining style. For several years he wrote a weekly column on English word origins for the Sunday Express, a national newspaper in the UK. He is the châtelain of a late Medieval castle in the South of France, listed as a Monument Historique by the French Government."

Wostinholm was a charted accountant, stockbroker and estate agent who worked out of offices on Bramall Lane in Sheffield. He took the position of secretary of the Bramall Lane Cricket Ground in 1862 and was responsible for the ground's development into a top class cricket venue. He also became secretary of the recently formed Yorkshire County Cricket Club and worked to establish Yorkshire as the leading county. In 1889 he was instrumental in the formation of a new football team to play at the Bramall Lane ground during the winter months and became the club secretary of Sheffield United at their inception. Although the team was selected by a committee and coached by a trainer, Wostinholm undertook many of the duties currently associated with that of a football manager including player transfers and dealing with The Football Association. Retiring from Bramall Lane in 1899 and Yorkshire in 1902 Wostinholm died in 1909 at the age of 73."

He succeeded Benjamin Holebrook as clerk of works at Trinity College in 1850. Shortly afterwards he became the official college architect, a post which he retained until his death. In 1872 he formed an architectural partnership with William Mansfield Mitchell, which was dissolved in 1882. He was a member of the Royal Institute of British Architects and was president for the last ten years of his life of the Royal Institute of the Architects of Ireland. He was a member of the Grand Lodge of Ireland (Freemasons) and designed the Masonic Female Orphan School of Ireland (now Bewley's Hotel) which opened in 1882."

In 1585 Jeong passed a gwageo for the selection of officials and became an officer of the military training department of Hanseong (hanseongbupanyun). Next year, he was promoted to an officer of the book publishing department of Hongmungwan (hongmungwansuchan), and then he was in charge of dual positions, a reporting officer at Saganwon (Saganwonjeongwon) and a junghakgyosu. In 1590, he was appointed as an inspecting officer at Saheonbu (Saheonbujipyeong), also serving as a member of King's assistant group. In the next year, he was dispatched to the northeastern border as a crops commander of this region. Following the war with Japan in 1592, Guk Gyeong-in took up arms in rebellion in Hoeryong, captured and turned two princes Prince Imhae and Prince Sunhwa and their entourages Kim Gui-yeong, Hwang Jeong-uk and Hwang Hyeok over to the enemy chief Katō Kiyomasa before surrendering himself. Fuming at the revolt, Jeonng put together a righteous army with seonbis. The righteous army led by Jeonng arrested Guk and beheaded him, and then won battles at Myungchun, GilJoo and SSangpo against the Japanese army. They totally reclaimed the northeastern province by winning at Baegtapgyo in the next year. In 1624, he died while being tortured after he was arrested and falsely accused of participating in a revolt of Yi Gwal. Long after, he was posthumously reinstated after the accusation was proved unfounded."

  "text" : "Sir John Pennycuick (6 November 1899 - 14 January 1982) was an English barrister and judge. He was a High Court judge from 1960 to 1974, and Vice-Chancellor of the Chancery Division from the recreation of the office in 1970 until 1974. Pennycuick was the only son of the British Army officer and engineer Colonel John Pennycuick, CSI (1841–1911). His father was the tenth of the eleven children of Brigadier John Pennycuick, CB, KH (1789–1849), who was killed in the Battle of Chillianwala in the Second Anglo-Sikh War. He was educated at Winchester College and New College, Oxford, and became a second lieutenant in the Coldstream Guards in 1919. He was called to the bar at Inner Temple in 1925, where later he became a bencher in 1954 and was Treasurer in 1978. He became a Queen's Counsel in 1947. He was appointed as a High Court judge in 1960, in the Chancery Division, and received the customary knighthood. Pennycuick became the first modern Vice-Chancellor in July 1970 when the office was revived to replace the title of \"Senior Judge\" for the head of the Chancery Division. He was appointed as a Privy Counsellor in the Queen's Birthday Honours List in June 1974, and retired as a full-time Chancery judge in September 1974, although he continued to sit as a judge occasionally. He married Lucy Johnstone in 1930, and they had one son and one daughter. His wife predeceased him in 1972."

  "text" : "John Harwood (1893–1964) was a British watchmaker who invented the self-winding wristwatch. Harwood was born in Bolton, Lancashire. During the war he had served as an armoury staff sergeant, developing an automatic pistol and a screwdriver whose blade turned on impact. After the war he served a watchmaking apprenticeship with Hirst Brothers and Co of Oldham. In 1922 he moved to the Isle of Man to set up his own watch repair business. In 1923, supported by a local businessman, he developed a self-winding wristwatch and applied for a patent in Switzerland, which was granted in September, 1924. His design ensured that the watch could be hermetically sealed against the ingress of water or dust. The hands could be reset by a rotating bezel. After four years, supported by funds from two Manchester brothers, Louis and Philip Alexander, he persuaded Swiss watch manufacturers Anton Schild S.A. and Walter Vogt of Fortis to manufacture the design. Blancpain also made them under licence in 1928 for sale in France and the Perpetual Self-winding Watch Company for sale in North America. The watches were first shown at the Basel Fair in 1926. He set up the Harwood Self Winding Watch Company in 1928 to market the watches in the UK, but the company failed in September 1931, not having sufficient financial resources to withstand the effects of the Great Depression. The watches also proved difficult to mass-produce and very delicate in use. In 1957 he was awarded the Gold Medal of the British Horological Institute."

From 1675 to 1678 he was again a member of the committee of the E.I.C. and in 1677 Master of the Haberdashers Company. He served twice more on the committee of the E.I.C. from 1679 to 1680 and from 1681 to 1683. He interrupted his period as alderman in 1683 but was re-elected for Queenhithe in 1688.

  "text" : "Jonathan Kreisberg is an American jazz guitarist and composer. Guitarist Jonathan Kreisberg has been steadily building his name as one of the most compelling composer/performers in Jazz. Combining timeless melodicism with forward thinking lines and textures, His style and approach has created a strong following of fans around the world. He frequently tours worldwide and records with his own groups as well artists such as Dr. Lonnie Smith, who says of Kreisberg \"He is a passionate musician with great vision, and he is constantly in fiery pursuit of innovation.\" Born in New York City, guitarist and composer Jonathan Kreisberg has fond memories of a childhood steeped in music. “I was lucky to grow up in a household that had a great and wide-ranging record collection,” he recalls, “including Coltrane's My Favorite Things, John Williams playing the ‘Concierto de Aranjuez’ and Cream's Disraeli Gears.” Jonathan started playing guitar at the age of ten after moving to Miami with his family. At 16 he was admitted to the New World School of the Arts, where his jazz studies took center stage. Intensely dedicated to the instrument, he was featured in Guitar Player and DownBeat while still in his teens. He won a scholarship to the University of Miami, where he held the guitar chair in the acclaimed Concert Jazz Band, touring Brazil and performing with Joe Henderson, Michael Brecker, and Red Rodney. Upon graduation, Jonathan began playing straight ahead jazz gigs as well as a myriad of other projects. He performed 20th century works with the New World Symphony under Michael Tilson Thomas. He also recorded a C.D. and performed extensively with the progressive rock group Third Wish. He also formed the first incarnation of the Jonathan Kreisberg Trio. Based in Miami, this electric based Trio released a C.D. and completed several U.S. East Coast tours, which included opening slots for George Benson and Steve Morse. He also began giving clinics at music schools and universities. While still in his early 20's, he returned to his birthplace in NYC with his focus on cutting edge acoustic jazz. \"My Miami Trio was about coming up with new textures and being communicative while still playing intense musically. When I moved to New York I entered a more introspective phase, really getting deeper into melodies and harmonies.\" This also coincided with a renewed interest in the jazz tradition. \"I found that the deeper I got into the tradition the more possibilities I became aware of for the future.\" Since returning to New York City, Jonathan has worked in the bands of many jazz greats including Dr. Lonnie Smith, Lee Konitz, Joe Locke, Stefano Dibatista, Ari Hoenig, Joel Frahm, Don Friedman, Greg Tardy, Donald Edwards, Jane Monheit, and Yosvany Terry. He has also led groups of various instrumentations featuring artists such as Bill Stewart, Larry Grenadier, and Scott Wendholt. Jonathan has now recorded eight CDs as a leader, including ONE, his recent all solo guitar cd, and WAVE UPON WAVE, his latest JKQ offering. On the latter he brings along alto saxophone genius Will Vinson, the incredible pianist Kevin Hays, and the young rhythm section team of Rick Rosato and Colin Stranahan and creates modern jazz that combines a respect for the tradition with instrumental virtuosity, modern soundscapes and influences from every corner of the world (and beyond). Although currently based in New York City, Jonathan can be seen on tour worldwide. Entering the major Jazz Festival circuit with their electrifying show at Jazz Baltica (the video footage is now at 100,000 YouTube hits and counting), JKQ has subsequently performed many of the major European and American festivals. When not on tour, Jonathan can be found at his steady wednesday trio hits at Bar Next Door in NYC, as well as at the Jazz Standard and Smalls Jazz Club."

  "text" : "James (Jim) Crawford (6 February 1908 – 11 November 1973) was an Australian playwright and commentator who wrote political plays, feature articles for newspapers and was very involved in many social and political groups. He was best known for his plays Rocket Range and Billets and Badges. Crawford wrote twenty-four plays and twenty-one skits which are known about. Some of the plays were turned into radio dramas. Crawford also wrote numerous newspaper articles in relation to political and social problems at the time which led him to be well respected in the community. Crawford was born in Manchester, England in 1908 and arrived in Australia in 1924. As a playwright, Crawford was influenced by William Shakespeare and Christopher Marlowe. He was also greatly influenced by the Communist Party of Australia and the ideals it stood for. In an article written by Crawford about Elizabethan Theatre he wrote that \"In the Elizabethan Theatre, Marlowe spoke with the voice of the radical intellectual. Shakespeare spoke with the voice of the people.\" From the themes of the plays written by Crawford it is clear he has tried to emulate both Marlowe and Shakespeare.Crawford was an important member of the Roving Reds Revue Company, New Theatre Club and Realist Writers Group. He also made contributions to several other groups. Crawford also spent time in the Army Services after marrying Ursula Hills in 1938. After his divorce from Ursula, Crawford married Pamela Crawford (née Seeman) in 1949. Crawford continued writing right up until his death at Greenslopes Hospital on 11 November 1973."

In 1906 he succeeded Alois Handl (1837-1915) as chair of experimental physics at the University of Czernowitz. In 1919, when Czernowitz became a Romanian university, Geitler relocated to Graz, where he taught classes at the Technische Universität Graz. Among his scientific research were studies that explained differences between x-rays and cathode rays. His best known publication was Elektromagnetische Schwingungen und Wellen, (\"Electromagnetic oscillations and waves\") (1905). He was a cousin to physicist Heinrich Hertz (1857-1894). Among his students at Czernowitz was Wojciech Rubinowicz (1889-1974)."

There in a cave, he held a conversation with Dattatreya in human form. He made disciples from among all castes including Muslims and Arabs. On one of his tours to Ankalakopa, while resting in a temple, he had the vision of Lord Dattatreya who came to him in the form of Narasimha Saraswati, a great saint lived in Narsobawadi near Gangapur. Narasimha Saraswati initiated him in the spiritual life, under an audumbar tree. Janardan Swami composed beautiful Abhangas. His very presence used to bring peace of mind to those who came to him. Of his three main disciples, Saint Eknath was the best known; the others were Ramajanardana and Janijanardana. Janardan Swami asked Eknath to go on a pilgrimage. He himself accompanied Eknath up to Nasik-Tryambakeshwar. He took Mahasamadhi in 1575."

  "text" : "John Fothergill Crosfield CBE DSc MA (Hampstead, London 22 October 1915 - Hampstead, London 25 March 2012), inventor and entrepreneur, was a pioneer in the application of electronics to all aspects of colour printing and the inventor of the acoustic and subsonic mines during the Second World War. Graduating with a degree in mechanical sciences from Cambridge University in 1936, Crosfield was working on electrical lifts for ASEA in Sweden when war was declared. He joined the Admiralty, where with a team of mathematicians and engineers he was charged with developing sonar, to detect midget submarines, and new types of mines. In 1947, Crosfield founded J F Crosfield Ltd. (later Crosfield Electronics Ltd.) to develop press control equipment, beginning with the Autotron, that enabled magazines to print economically in colour. Following this the company played a leading role in the introduction of colour scanning in 1958, phototypesetting and later the automated composition of pages incorporating pictures and text, a 1970s precursor to Photoshop. He founded Crosfield Business Machines Ltd in 1966 to develop and produce banknote inspection, counting and sorting machines. The companies won 4 Queens Awards for Technology and Exports. De La Rue acquired the Crosfield businesses in 1975. In 1971, Crosfield was awarded the CBE for Services to Industry. Though he was a board member of De La Rue, Baker Perkins and the Scientific Instruments Research Association until 1985, Crosfield found time to research and write The Crosfield Family, The Cadbury Family and, in 1991, Recollections of Crosfield Electronics 1947 to 1975. He installed an electron-microscope in his studio, using it to scan and image microscopic insect and plant life from his garden. He used these images as the inspiration for surreal but fascinating paintings. Crosfield was noted for his generosity, giving away most of the fruits of his success in his lifetime. He was widely read, a good conversationalist and always interested in the exploits of his large, extended family and his many friends and their offspring. After a short illness, he died at his home at the age of 96."

Commentators credited these two record-breaking performances to the high altitude in Mexico City, where they competed. Lea qualified for the Olympics at the Armed Forces track and field championship. Experts at the time considered Lea one of the best prospects for an olympic medal for the United States. Lea once again competed against Jones, and once again Jones won, breaking his own world record in the process. Despite this, both Jones and Lea did poorly in the 1956 Olympics and neither won a medal. Lea struggled with nerves before competition, and reportedly panicked before every one of them. Before his Olympics competition, he suffered a nervous skin rash."

He has won a number of awards for his scholarship including research grants for his work on Blake, Dante, and Henry James and is a recurring face on the conference scene; four times on Dickens in 2012. Tambling’s literary interests range from Boccaccio to Kafka, Chaucer to Cinema. More specifically he has published books on Blake, Dickens and the nineteenth-century and cities within literature. Publication of his book Opera and the Culture of Fascism (1996) was met by a number of distressed voices from the operatic world ; possibly due to the book’s suggestion of a complicity from the industry with fascist ideology."

He was born in Stoney Creek, Ontario, the son of William Corman, and studied political science at the University of Toronto. After receiving his B.A. in 1912, he moved west, studying law in Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan, and was called to the Saskatchewan bar in 1915. In 1914, he married Mabel \"Con\" Conner. Corman practised law in Moose Jaw and was active in the Liberal Party. However, he became dissatisfied with the Liberals during the Great Depression. He was elected to Moose Jaw City Council in 1937 and was mayor from 1939 to 1944. Corman ran unsuccessfully for a seat in the provincial assembly in 1938 as a Social Credit candidate. He served in the provincial cabinet as Attorney General from 1944 to 1956, when he retired from politics. During his time as Attorney General, the Farm Security Act was passed in 1944 and the Saskatchewan Bill of Rights was passed in 1947. He also hosted the radio show Your Attorney General Speaks from 1946 to 1950. Corman died in Moose Jaw at the age of 84."

In 1829 he became an associate professor at the University of Strasbourg, where in 1834 he was appointed professor of accouchements (obstetrics). In 1867 he was appointed dean to the faculty of medicine at Strasbourg. Due to consequences of the Franco-Prussian War, the medical faculty relocated to Nancy in 1872, where Stoltz resumed his role as dean. Stoltz is credited for introducing into French obstetrics the technique of induced premature labor in cases of dangerous parturition. He also made improvements to the obstetrical forceps. He was the author of many papers in the fields of obstetrics, gynecology and pediatrics, and penned the introduction to Hermann Franz Naegele's Traité pratique de l'art des accouchements. The following are a few of his principal writings: \n*  Considérations sur quelques points relatifs à l'art des accouchements, 1826 \n*  De la délivrance, 1834 \n*  Mémoire et observations sur la provocation de l'accouchement prématuré dans des cas de rétrécissements du bassin, 1835."

He was born in Goderich, Ontario and came to Saskatoon, Saskatchewan in 1912. Educated at the University of Saskatchewan and the Saskatoon Normal School, he taught school briefly and then served in France with the Canadian Expeditionary Force during World War I. After the war, he farmed for a while and then became a school principal in Fort Qu'Appelle. In 1934, Sturdy was an unsuccessful Farmer-Labour candidate for the Qu'Appelle-Wolseley seat in the provincial assembly. The following year, he was elected to the executive of the Saskatchewan Teachers' Federation. In 1940, he became the overseas assistant director of educational services for the Royal Canadian Legion. Sturdy served in the provincial cabinet as Minister of Reconstruction and Rehabilitation, as Minister of Social Welfare and as a minister without portfolio. In 1956, he chaired the Committee on Indian Affairs, which recommended giving First Nations people in Saskatchewan the rights to vote in provincial elections, to live outside of reserves and to purchase liquor. After retiring from politics in 1960, Sturdy moved to Victoria, British Columbia. He later died there at the age of 73."

  "text" : "Georg Adam Joseph Schmitt (baptised on 18 March 1734 in Gernsheim, Germany, died on 28 May 1791 in Amsterdam) was a German/Dutch composer, conductor, music director, publisher, music theorist and pedagogue. He is also known as \"The Dutch Haydn\". Joseph Schmitt was a student of Carl Friedrich Abel, who was a student of J.S. Bach and a mentor of Mozart, and probably also had close contact with composers and performers at the court in Mannheim. In 1753, at age 19, Schmitt was admitted into the clergy. For a period of around 20 years worked as a musical priest at the Cistercian Eberbach Abbey (Kloster Eberbach) in the Rheingau, where he composed a broad range of music, from sacred to secular, chamber to symphonic. In the early 1770s, Schmitt moved to Amsterdam, where he had already compositions published by leading European music publishing firm, the Hummel brothers. Schmitt established himself quickly in the city, becoming music director at the Felix Meritis society, where he worked for the next two decades, and opening his own publishing firm which subsequently introduced major works by composers such as Mozart to northern Europe for the first time. In his various roles, Schmitt became the most important figure in Dutch musical life in the second half of the 18th century. As a composer, Schmitt's works are beautifully crafted. His style is sparkling and cosmopolitan. It is definitely influenced by Abel, Bach's sons and the Mannheimers, but also possesses a highly refreshing originality and a highly distinctive voice - beautifully balancing elegance, energy and sturm und drang elements. As a historical figure, Schmitt has largely been ignored by the Dutch, despite his pioneering role in the realisation of the country's first purpose built concert hall, the Felix Meritis. The hall opened in October 1788 with Schmitt conducting the inaugural performance. In the 19th century, the hall was the central point of Dutch music life and hosted the Dutch débuts of luminary performers including Clara Schumann and Brahms. Schmitt's compositions had been largely forgotten, until recently. Dutch-based Australian conductor Simon Murphy has been responsible for reintroducing Schmitt's music to the world in performance, through broadcasts, on disc and in new editions. In the 18th century, Schmitt's music was particularly popular in northern Europe, Scandinavia and on the east coast of the U.S. Listings of performances of his orchestral works can be found on 18th-century programmes from U.S. concert societies, and Schmitt's works are included in the listings of the holdings of most 18th-century European court, orchestral and music society libraries."

He moved to Basel to study medicine, continuing his studies in 1726 and 1727 at the University of Leiden. There he became a friend of Albrecht von Haller. With Haller he made a grand tour to Paris to finish their medicine studies. That is where he wrote his diary that was later published as Pariser Tagebuch. The two friends in 1728 studied mathematics under Johann Bernoulli and travelled through Switzerland. Gessner became a doctor in Bazel in 1730, but he quickly chose a scientific career. In 1733 he became math professor and in 1738 he began to teach physics in Zürich. Gessner influenced many Swiss students, such as Johann Heinrich Rahn and Johann Georg Sulzer. Gessner was a follower of Carolus Linnaeus and published over Swiss flora."

  "text" : "John \"Bunter\" Graham (born c. 1945) is a longstanding prominent Ulster loyalist figure. It is unknown when Graham joined the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF) but he quickly rose high in its ranks as a member of the \"Brigade Staff\" (Belfast leadership) to allegedly become UVF Chief of Staff in 1976. At some point in the late 1970s, he was admitted to the Mater Hospital for a short stay. Although he was watched by bodyguards, the Provisional IRA decided to assassinate him, in what they termed \"Operation Bunter\". However, this was prevented by the police, acting on information received from an informant. In 1983, Joseph Bennett, a UVF commander, became an informant for the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC). As a result, fourteen prominent members of the UVF were imprisoned, including Graham. On 14 January 1993, Graham was hit by rifle shots, fired through the window of his home. The Irish National Liberation Army (INLA) claimed responsibility. The attack led to a number of other leading loyalists turning their homes into miniature fortresses for fear that they too would be targeted. Graham has been named on several occasions as the incumbent UVF Chief of Staff, and as such holding Brigadier-General rank: for example, by Pat Rabbitte, and by campaigner Raymond McCord. Investigative journalist and author Martin Dillon uses the pseudonym \"Mr F.\" to refer to a \"military commander\" in the UVF, who he states was \"known as Bunter\". Ed Moloney in his book Voices From the Grave: Two Men's War in Ireland stated that he has held the position of UVF Chief of Staff since 1976. Raymond McCord claimed, in a statement to the United States House Committee on Foreign Affairs, that Graham had acted as an \"agent of the state\". In 2000, amid a violent UDA-UVF feud, Graham was involved in talking to hardliners in the UVF and dissuading them from escalating the conflict. Under Graham's influence the UVF members who were feuding with the UDA West Belfast Brigade agreed to a truce negotiated by the group's political representatives David Ervine of the UVF-linked Progressive Unionist Party and Gary McMichael of the UDA's political arm, the Ulster Democratic Party. In 2012, Graham went on a trip with other veteran loyalists and republicans to the Middle East to study the Arab-Israeli conflict and the lessons it might provide for Northern Ireland."

Upton was the eldest son of Clotworthy Upton, 1st Baron Templetown, Clerk Comptroller to Augusta, Dowager Princess of Wales, by Elizabeth Boughton, daughter of Shuckburgh Boughton. The Honourable Arthur Upton and the Honourable Fulke Greville Howard were his younger brothers. He succeeded his father in the barony in April 1785, aged 13. This was an Irish peerage and entitled him to a seat in the Irish House of Lords after his 21st birthday in 1792. However, he was still able to stand for election to the British House of Commons and in 1802 he was returned to Parliament as one of two representatives for Bury St Edmunds. In 1806 he was created Viscount Templetown, in the County of Antrim, in the Irish peerage. He continued to represent Bury St Edmunds in Parliament until 1812. Lord Templetown married Lady Mary Montagu, daughter of John Montagu, 5th Earl of Sandwich. She died in October 1824. Templetown survived her by over 20 years and died in September 1846, aged 74. He was succeeded by his eldest son, Henry. His second son George, who eventually succeeded in the title, was a General in the British Army,as was his third son, Arthur"

  "text" : "John Mathew (31 May 1849 – 11 March 1929) was an Australian Presbyterian minister and anthropologist, author of \"Eaglehawk and Crow\" and \"Two Representative Tribes of Queensland\". Mathew was born in Aberdeen, Scotland, the fourth child (and eldest son) of Alexander Mathew, a factory overseer, and his wife Jean, née Mortimer. Mathew was initially educated at Kidd's school, Aberdeen, at nine years of age his father died and went to live with his maternal grandmother at Insch then at the Insch Free Church School where he was a pupil-teacher from 1862 to 1864. Mathew migrated to Queensland, Australia, with a brother and sister in 1864 to live with their uncle John Mortimer on his station, Manumbar, on the Burnett River. Mathew worked there for six years as a Stockrider, bookkeeper, and storeman becoming familiar with the culture and language of the Kabi and Wakawaka (see List of Indigenous Australian group names#W people. Mathew then tried gold-digging for two years and then worked as a teacher at Dalby, Queensland (1872–75) and the Brisbane Normal School (1875–76). Then he moved to Victoria, Australia and graduated from the University of Melbourne (B.A., 1884; M.A., 1886) with first-class honours despite working at times as a tutor and station-manager. As a Presbyterian minister, Mathew worked at Ballan, Victoria from 1887 for two years, then at Coburg, Victoria from 1889 to 1923. In 1889 Mathew won the prize and medal of the Royal Society of New South Wales for an essay titled 'The Australian Aborigines'. This was the basis for his best-known publication, Eaglehawk and Crow (1899). This publication was criticized (as Mathew had expected) by the ethnographers Walter Baldwin Spencer, Alfred William Howitt and Lorimer Fison. There was however, more support from Daisy Bates and Robert Hamilton Mathews. Mathew returned to Queensland in 1906, visiting the Kabi and Wakawaka people at the Barambah Government Aboriginal Station. He published Two Representative Tribes of Queensland (1910) and although his linguistic studies and ethnographic reporting are still well regarded, his controversial theory of a tri-hybrid origin of Australian Aborigines is not supported by current data."

  "text" : "Jacobus Craandijk (7 September 1834, in Amsterdam – 3 June 1912, in Haarlem) was a Dutch Mennonite teacher and minister who enjoyed using his spare time for walks while taking notes and drawing. He was trained at the Amsterdam Mennonite seminary and first served in Borne from 1859, where he met and later married Anna Geertruida Ballot in 1861. He then served in Rotterdam from 1862, where he served on the board of the Rotterdam-based Nederlandsch Zendelings Genootschap (Dutch Mission Society) from 1864. In 1869 he wrote the book Het Nederlandsch zendelinggenootschap in zijn willen en werken, in which he reported on the goals and more and less successful results of that society since its inception. It upset him to see that each religion set up its own missionary work, which in his opinion, was a waste of resources. In general, it was his aim to persuade people of all faiths to invest in one Missionary society as a way to join forces for good in the third world. To this end he tried but failed to win support for government-sponsored third world development projects. In 1879 Van Craandijk organized and presided over a conference of prominent Dutch Mennonite leaders held at Amsterdam. In 1884 he was called to serve in the Doopsgezinde kerk, Haarlem, where he stayed. In 1897 he spoke at the centennial celebration of the Dutch Missionary society, and he also wrote a memorial boek Gedenkboek for the occasion. Today he is best known for his \"Walks with pen and pencil\", a series of books with illustrations based on notes he made while walking in various parishes. Together these books form an important archival record and can be seen as early tourist literature. This seven part series is listed as one of the 1000 most important texts in the Canon of Dutch Literature. He is known for 135 drawings of Dutch castles."

  "text" : "John Bamlet Smallman was an Irish-Canadian businessman (9 March 1849 – 14 February 1916). A son of James Knight Smallman and Eliza Switzer, John was born in Clifden, County Galway, Ireland. The family emigrated in 1859 to London, Ontario, Canada where his father became active as a commission merchant. From age 14 to 21, Smallman worked as a clerk, saving enough money to form a partnership with his fellow Methodist, Lemuel Hill Ingram, a clerk in a local wholesale establishment. They ran a successful business, and in 1882 they were purchasing direct from British suppliers on cash terms. Within ten years trade had increased to $110,000, staff productivity had more than doubled (to $9,200 per clerk), expenses had fallen from 16 to 11 percent of turnover and profits were averaging 10 percent. Smallman and Ingram expanded their business by acquiring new premises in 1892. They purchased adjacent properties and added shoe and toy departments (only to be discarded as insufficiently profitable). Soon an even larger location was secured. By the turn of the century the store employed more than 100 clerks. Smallman bought Ingram's interest at the latter's death in January 1901, bringing his own nephew and two of Ingram's children into the business. It was incorporated in 1908. Smallman suffered a nervous breakdown and two strokes. He died on 14 February 1916. His obituary stated that he never mixed in politics, was a member of First Methodist Church and supported the Children’s Aid Society and the Irish Benevolent Society. The bulk of his shares in his business were bequeathed to the Western University of London, Ontario."

  "text" : "Jeremy Goldkorn (Chinese: 金玉米; Pinyin: Jĩn Yùmí; born in Johannesburg) is a South African blogger and editor who has lived in Beijing, China since 1995. He is the founder and editor of Danwei, which includes a China-focused blog and media research firm. He graduated from the University of Cape Town with a Bachelor of Arts (Honors) in Literature. Prior to founding Danwei, he worked for several Beijing-based magazines, including Beijing Scene, TimeOut and technology magazine ReDegg, and as business development manager for Beijing design firm Standards Group. Danwei, which is named after the Chinese term for a work unit, is considered to be a well-read China-focused \"bridge blog\" that translates Chinese language media articles into English. John Lanchester has written that \"Danwei gives a range of sources, news and opinions on China that no mainstream news organisation can match.\" Danwei has collaborated with the Australian Centre on China in the World at the Australian National University to archive China media articles for research purposes since 2010. Danwei has been blocked in mainland China since 2009, but Danwei now publishes at Danwei.com which operates unblocked. In early 2013, Goldkorn sold Danwei to the Financial Times but he continues to manage the company and website. Goldkorn has spoken frequently about Chinese media and Internet culture, including at the University of Sydney and Columbia Law School, and in interviews with Frontline, the Australia Network and the Asia Society. He also regular co-hosts the Sinica current affairs podcast with Kaiser Kuo, which is recorded at the Popup Chinese studios in Beijing."

He was born in Smith Falls, Ontario to parents Thomas Harris and Mary Jane Jones, and was educated in Melfort, Saskatchewan, Prince Albert and Saskatoon. In 1932, Harris married Hilda May Carson. He taught school for 20 years. Harris lived in Choiceland where he managed the Co-op store. After retiring from politics, he returned to teaching school. In 1952, he moved to Tompkins to manage the Co-op store there, then suddenly returned to teaching in Choiceland; then, in 1960, departed for Edmonton, Alberta – where he taught until the early 1970s."

  "text" : "John Barker (1814–15 November 1891), was an English-born Australian lawyer and parliamentary officer. He was the first parliamentary clerk of both the Legislative Council and Legislative Assembly in the Victorian colonial parliament. Barker was the eldest son of the late John Barker and Mary Anne, and was born at Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire. He emigrated to Port Phillip (now Victoria) in 1840, after entering himself for the bar at Lincoln's Inn, and engaged in pastoral pursuits with his brother Edward, afterwards a well-known physician in Melbourne. Revisiting England, he was called to the bar in 1843; and in 1844 married Susanna, daughter of Richard Hodgkinson, of Morton Grange, Nottingham. He returned to Port Phillip in November 1844, accompanied by his brother William (who subsequently practised as a surgeon at Emerald Hill, Melbourne). In the next year he was appointed a magistrate, and in August 1849 was one of the Commissioners under the Disputed Boundaries Act, having the Hamilton district assigned to him. Barker, who was admitted to the Victorian bar in November 1851, was in October of that year, on the separation of Port Phillip from New South Wales and its formation into the colony of Victoria, appointed Clerk of the Legislative Council then constituted, and successfully performed the difficult task of inaugurating its procedure. When responsible government came into operation in 1856, Barker was offered the choice of the clerkship of the new Upper or Lower Chamber. He accepted the latter, and remained Clerk of the Assembly until April 1882, when he was appointed Clerk of the Legislative Council and Clerk of Parliaments, a post which he resigned in 1891. He died on November 15 of that year. At his death he was the last surviving participant from either the first parliament or the formation of the Legislative Assembly."

  "text" : "John Purss (12 December 1732 – 8 April 1803) was a Canadian businessman, militia officer, and office holder. Purss was born in Elgin, Scotland in 1732, the son of a merchant there. He moved to Quebec after the British victory and, in 1762, entered into a business partnership with fellow Scot James Johnston. Their business traded wheat, iron, and seal furs and oil. The businessmen partnered with Jean-Baptiste Bouchette in 1765 to take advantage of his trading post and Gulf of Saint Lawrence fishery. They also bought a share of an ironworks in 1767, although they sold it a few years later. In 1770 they entered into a long term lease for the King’s Wharf in Quebec, a vital resource for commerce in the city. In the 1780s the firm entered into a partnership with Johnston's brother-in-law, Henry Taylor, to run a distillery on Rue Champlain. With four stills, four boilers and eight evaporation tubs, the distillery produced spirits, beer and an invention of Taylor's called \"essence of spruce for making beer\", which was exported to New York and the West Indies. By the end of the 1780s the partners owned shares in the Dorchester Bridge and owned a number of houses which they leased. Their fortunes seemed to decline in the subsequent decades as they sold property and the distillery, sublet the King's Wharf, borrowed money and sold their shares in the bridge. The partnership ended with Johnston's death in 1800. The firm's assets were split between Purss and Margaret Macnider, Johnston's widow. Purss played a role in the city's public life. He was an important figure in the Quebec Fire Society. In 1787 Purss became a lieutenant in the militia and was promoted to captain around 1799. He served as assessor in 1797. Purss died on 8 April 1803. Having never married, his estate was left to relatives in Britain and to his partner's widow."

  "text" : "Jean-Baptiste Bouchette (5 July 1736 – 28 April 1804) was a French Canadian merchant, mariner, and militia and naval officer. Bouchette established a fishing business in the Gulf of Saint Lawrence around 1760 and by 1765 was a well established merchant in Quebec City. In that year he established a partnership with Scottish emigrants John Purss and James Johnston to establish a trading post to serve the fur and fishing industries in the Gulf. In 1773, Bouchette married Marie-Angélique Duhamel, daughter of Captain Julien Duhamel (1723-1778) and Marie-Angelique, daughter of Francois Dupolo Duval and Marie-Anne Boucher de la Bouteillerie (1675-1762). Madame Bouchette's father, like himself, was a native of Saint-Malo who settled at Quebec City in 1753. The Bouchettes were the parents of nine children, including Colonel Joseph Bouchette., who surveyed and described both the lower and upper province. Bouchette fitted out and armed his own schooner for His Majesty's service during the American War. In 1775, Bouchette's schooner was armed to assist in the defence of Quebec against the American invasion. It served as one of the escort vessels for the convoy evacuating Montreal. She was burned by the rebels. When the convoy became trapped due to unfavourable winds, Bouchette piloted a small boat to help General Guy Carleton and Charles-Louis Tarieu de Lanaudière, his aide-de-camp, escape the American batteries. In gratitude, Bouchette was granted a commission in an artillery company and on 28 April 1776 he was made a lieutenant of militia and given command of an armed sloop Hope. He served during the siege of Montreal, 1775-6. On 11 September 1777 he was made a master and commander and captained the Seneca, which patrolled the Great Lakes on Lake Ontario. Bouchette was discharged in 1784. By 1788 Bouchette had returned to private life in Quebec, but it was not to last long. In 1791 he returned to Lake Ontario reappointed as master and commander in the Provincial Marine and by 1802-04 was the senior officer on the lake. Bouchete became increasingly disillusioned with the military and in 1803, after a confrontation with a senior officer, he was brought in front of an inquiry which upheld three charges against him. Bouchette returned to Quebec and died on 28 April 1804."

  "text" : "Jian, King of Qi (Chinese: 齊王建; pinyin: Qí Wáng Jiàn; reigned 264–221 BC) was the last king of Qi, one of the seven major states of the Warring States period of ancient China. His personal name was Tian Jian (田建), ancestral name Gui, and he did not have a posthumous title because he was the last king of Qi. Jian succeeded his father King Xiang of Qi, who died in 265 BC. He reigned for 44 years. At the time he acceded to the throne, there were only a few states left in what is now China. Qi was one of the wealthiest, and it was on the seacoast far from the most aggressive state, Qin. For years, King Jian's mother acted as his advisor. On her deathbed she wanted to tell her son the king which ministers she thought were the best. But when the writing materials arrived she could no longer tell him. After she died, Hou Sheng (后勝) became his prime minister. It was alleged by some sources that Hou Sheng was in the pay of the state of Qin. One famous anecdote is that after the Battle of Changping in 260 BC, in which, according to the historian Sima Qian, 450,000 soldiers of the state of Zhao were killed by the Qin army, King Jian was advised: \"Zhao is a hedge that protects Qi... just as the lips protect the teeth. When the lips are gone, the teeth become cold....Go to the aid of Zhao!\" However, the king did nothing; during his reign he tried to stay out of wars, as the future First Emperor Qin Shihuang attacked all the states around him. The kingdom of Qi was the only opponent of Qin after Qin Shi Huang conquered every other state. King Jian and his prime minister Hou Sheng (后勝), a relation of Jian's wife, sent the Qi army to the western border of Qi to protect the country; but Qin general Wang Ben (王賁), son of Wang Jian, attacked Qi from the north instead and conquered it in 221 BC, completing Qin's unification of China. King Jian was captured with his entire court. In one story, the king went to Qin voluntarily, resisting the urging of his loyal counselor, after the defeat, because Qin Shihuang, the First Emperor, had promised him a large property of 500 li. Instead, when he arrived in Qin, he was sent to a remote area with his wife and daughter, where he starved to death. The Qi people made a sarcastic ballad to commemorate him. \"Oh, pine trees! Oh, cypress trees! Making the king of Qi die in a common village–this was a guest who was good at adapting!\""

His father died while he was yet a boy, his mother remarried to Martin O'Reilly, himself a celebrated piper. O'Reilly tutored Moore on the pipes. At some point, Moore emigrated to the United States, enlisting in the navy, in which he served \"for quite a few years.\" After leaving the navy, he settled in Brooklyn, working as a professional piper around New York. On an 1887 engagement in Springheld, Ohio, organised by Mr. Powers of the Ivy Leaf Company, he became ill and was hospitalised. He was replaced by Barney Delaney. In 1894, he returned to Galway in order to bring his step-father to New York. The night prior to departure, he visited Patsy Touhey and Patrick FitzPatrick, who noted his condition was not the best but not alarming. However, he died within a week while en route, and was buried at sea on his own request. O'Neill remarks of him: Moore was not particularly distinguished for brilliancy of execution on the chanter, but in the manipulation of the regulators he had few if any superiors. Often when the reed in his chanter proved refractory or did not “go” to suit him, he would play the whole tune through on the keys of the regulators."

  "text" : "Joseph Anderson Panton CMG, (2 June 1831 – 25 October 1913) was a Scottish-born Australian magistrate and goldfields commissioner. Panton was born in Knockiemil, Aberdeenshire, Scotland, the son of John Panton (of the Hudson's Bay Company service) and his wife Alexina McKay, née Anderson. Joseph Panton was educated at the Scottish Naval and Military Academy, developing an interest in drawing. He later studied geology amongst other subjects at the University of Edinburgh, but did not finish a degree. Panton's uncle, Colonel Joseph Anderson, suggested that he migrate to Australia; Panton arrived in Sydney aboard the Thomas Arbuthnot in March 1851. He then went to the Port Phillip District. After farming briefly at Mangalore, Panton tried for gold without luck at Mount Alexander. Then Panton applied for a position as an officer in the gold escort and was appointed assistant commissioner in 1852 at Kangaroo Gully near Bendigo, Victoria. A year later he was senior assistant commissioner at Bendigo and then senior commissioner in 1854. Panton investigated resentment against the Chinese gold-diggers and recommended a Chinese protectorate; this was adopted by Governor Charles Hotham in 1855. Panton had helped to organize the Melbourne Exhibition in 1854 and was a commissioner fothe Melbourne International Exhibition (1880). In 1858, Panton went to Scotland and then to Paris to study art with a friend of his, Hubert de Castella. On Panton's return to Australia, he was appointed warden and magistrate at the Jamieson-Wood's Point and next at the Anderson's Creek goldfields. Panton then became magistrate at Heidelberg, where he also mapped the Yarra Valley, naming Panton Hill. Panton's Gap where the road to Ben Cairn and Donna Buang branches from the Don Road near Healesville, Victoria derives its name from a small house he had there. He also named Mount Donna Buang which he first called Mount Acland but renamed it after learning the Aboriginal name. From Heidelberg, Panton was transferred to Geelong and moved to Melbourne as senior magistrate from 1874 to 1907. Panton was active in the Victorian Artists Association and the Victorian Academy of Art which developed into the Victorian Artists Society. A fellow of the Royal Geographical Society (London), Panton was also vice-president of the Royal Geographical Society of Australasia, Victorian Branch. In 1895 Panton declined the honour of knighthood but was appointed Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George (CMG). Predeceased by his wife, he died at St. Kilda, Victoria on 25 October 1913 and was survived by two daughters, one of whom, Amy, was a well-known portrait painter. In 1882, the Victorian government botanist, Ferdinand von Mueller named a newly described plant from Western Australia, Eremophila pantonii in his honour."

He was the eldest son of the scholar and statesman Nikephoros Choumnos. The date of his birth is unknown, however in ca. 1290–1294, when he is known to have fallen ill, he was still very young. Through the influence of his father, he quickly rose in the imperial hierarchy and was named parakoimomenos tou koitonos. He also led Byzantine forces against the Ottoman Turks in Bithynia in 1300–1306, under Michael IX Palaiologos. His campaigns apparently met with some success, since he acquired a reputation for ability in warfare. In 1307 he was promoted one rank to parakoimomenos tes sphendones. In 1308/1309 he married an unknown lady related to the ruling Palaiologos dynasty, with whom he had a son and a daughter. Their names are unknown. His stance in the Byzantine civil war of 1321–1328 is unknown, but his brother George Choumnos appears to have been a partisan of Andronikos II Palaiologos. Like his father, John was a learned man, having studied rhetoric, philosophy and medicine. A collection of his letters survives, as well as a medical treatise on the proper diet for gout. He died sometime between 1332 and 1338, while serving as governor of Chios."

Since she worships at the altar of Shel Silverstein, it’s not surprising her favorite book writing genre is rhyming verse. Her first children’s book and Hoffer Award winner, Catty Wompus: A Tale of Friendship, is about a lonely girl who learns the true value of friends. It’s based on a childhood experience that never left her. The sequel, Catty Wompus and The New Kid, takes the lessons learned, one step further. In 2015, Catty and her pals were brought to life in a musical television pilot called The Adventures of Catty Wompus that she hopes will become a series. In addition to the Catty Wompus books, Julie is an award winning screenwriter with awards and placements from top-ranking film festivals and screenplay competitions such as the Austin Film Festival, BlueCat, Nicholl Fellowship, PAGE International Screenwriting Awards and Fresh Voices. She recently had the honor of being included in the Austin Film Festival’s Inaugural Screenwriters to Watch article in MovieMaker magazine, July 19, 2016. Julie holds a Feature Film Writing Certificate from UCLA Extension as well as the Academy of Film Writing. She's a founding board member of the Cinematic Arts and Technology Foundation of Cal State Monterey Bay whose goal is to empower at-risk youth through year-round community programs that investigate, educate and celebrate the cinematic arts. Julie resides on the beautiful Monterey Peninsula with her husband and two painfully cute canine pals, Tyson and Lambchop."

  "text" : "John \"Mac an Asal\" McDonough (died c. 1857) was an Irish piper. McDonough was a native of Annaghdown, County Galway but had travelled widely throughout Ireland, spending a great deal of time in Dublin (at one stage apparently entertaining either faculty of students at Trinity College, Dublin, and associated with Canon James Goodman of Trinity). According to O'Neill, \"old people speak of this remarkable piper's facility in giving to the music an appeal and expression peculiarly his own. An all-around player, capable of meeting all demands, he had a preference for piece or descriptive music.\" While in the capital, \"McDonough’s name was placarded conspicuously in Dublin as the celebrated Irish piper from Annaghdown, County Galway, especially on the bridges crossing the Liffey. While playing on the streets one evening, to the keen delight of an appreciative audience, some well-to-do gentry who came along were so captivated by his inimitable execution that they took him into a clubhouse or hotel in the vicinity. No doubt he was treated with much liberality, but when he reappeared on the street some time afterwards, it was noticed that he was under the influence of intoxicants. This so angered the waiting audience that they stoned the building, and didn’t leave a whole pane of glass in the windows within reach of their missiles. His nickname, Mac an Asal (son of the ass) arose from his father's profession as a dealer in donkeys or asses. McDonagh Sr. had his son play the pipes, sitting on one of them, as he guided them to a fair or market. He was married and had at least one child, a Mrs. Kenny, Queen of the Irish Fiddlers, who was married to piper John Kenny. Piper|John Flannagan(born 1870) married mrs. Kenny's daughter. . McDonough himself was reduced to dire poverty by Great Famine, forcing him to leave Dublin and die in Gort poorhouse. O'Neill remarks \"His splendid instrument, made specially for him by Michael Egan, the most famous of all Irish pipemakers, while both were in Liverpool, was treasured by his widow for seven years after his death. Necessity however forced her to sacrifice her sentiments, and though costing originally twenty pounds she disposed of it for a trice to a pipe-repairer named Dugan, of Merchant’s Quay, Dublin.\" He was unrelated to fellow musician and Galwegian, Pat McDonagh."

When Landquist studied at Uppsala University, he was member of the student organization Les quatre diables together with Sven Lidman, Sigurd Agrell and Harald Brising. Landquist was engaged in Strindbergsfejden and released August Strindberg's works. In 1916 he wrote a Gustaf Fröding monograph and was ready to introduce Sigmund Freud's theory manners in Swedish history of literature. He also translated Freud's works to Swedish. Landquist was 1910–22 married to Elin Wägner and later, from 1938, with Solveig Landquist. Landquist's critical recension of the 1946 book Pippi Långstrump was the beginning of a newspaper debate where people protested against Astrid Lindgren's writing of children books. In 1971 Landquist received \"De Nios Stora Pris\"."

  "text" : "James O'Brien (1823–85), Irish piper. O'Brien was born in Swinford, County Mayo. He was friendly with Piper Cribben, and became his pupil, and was acquainted with Patrick Walsh (piper). He was neither blind nor lame, but took up music for the sheer love of it. However, after emigrating to England, he was suffered a spinal injury while working in a stone quarry which disabled him from hard manual labour, so he was forced to rely upon music as his sole source of income. O'Brien played all over the north of England, in taverns, picnics, and fairs. He was especially fond of Yorkshire and Lancashire, but was known to wander as far south as Devon. Captain Francis O'Neill tells of him: \"While sauntering along a highway one day he came to a fine-looking mansion, and, being thirsty, he went up to the hall door and rang the bell. An old lady, whose head was crowned with a wealth ot snow-white hair, responded. When O’Brien announced the object of his call she asked him where he came from.\" \"On learning that he was an Irishman she further inquired if he knew a place called Ballinamuck. Of course he did, for it was close to his birthplace. Then the mystery of her interest in Irish topography was revealed.\"\"Her son, an officer in the English army, was killed in that vicinity a little while before the battle of Ballinamuck, in September, 1798. When the Irish and French troops were marching towards the town, followed closely by the English.\"\"A French soldier dropped out of the ranks, too ill to proceed farther, and crawled behind a stone wall to die. Seeing the English force marching by a short time later, he took deliberate aim at an officer and shot him dead. The victim was the whitewhaired lady’s son.\"\"Notwithstanding a bereaved mother’s cherished grief, O’Brien’s thirst was assuaged with a beverage stronger than water.\" He relocated to the United States in the early 1860s, disembarking at Portland, Maine and proceeding from there to all Irish communities in the state before going on to Boston, Massachusetts. In 1875 he settled in Chicago, staying at the home of Roger Walsh (formerly of Portland). Here he made the acquaintance of Captain Francis O'Neill, who in 1913 wrote \"Many a pleasant hour the present writer spent listening to “Jimmy’s” delightful music and memorizing his tunes, many of which were not in circulation until given publicity through our efforts.\" Aftere his death in 1885, his pipes were held by John Doyle, and after his passing, to Sergeant James Early."

He is also the provost of Kresge College at UCSC and a Governing Board Member of the Latino Literary Cultures Project/Proyecto Culturas Literarias Latinas. Poblete earned his Bachelor of Arts from the University of Chile and his Ph.D. from Duke University where he studied literary markets in Chile, the role subaltern readers play in influencing these markets, and the influence of cultural values on curricular choices in schools. One of Poblete’s professors at Duke University was Argentine born Walter Mignolo who contributed to Poblete's Critical Latin American and Latino Studies. Poblete’s current research focuses on the 19th century Latin America and contemporary Latino culture. His research on the 19th century culture focuses on literature as a disciplinary discourse for the formation of national subjects, as a set of social practices, and as a product in the cultural market. In addition, Poblete has written and researched various aspects of Latin American and Latino culture and experiences, with consideration to modern phenomenons including globalization and transnationalism. His studies on US Latinos and contemporary Chilean culture “participate in an effort to rethink Latin/o American Studies in a global framework. That is to say, capable of encompassing Latin America and the United States from interdisciplinary angles, which can do justice to the new complex cultural, social and political developments of a globalized Latin/o America.” Poblete’s work has also often analyzed literary works (including comics, film, and literature) and their political or social role in the U.S./Latin America."

  "text" : "John W. McKecknie (1862–1934) was an American architect working in Kansas City, Missouri, who applied the principles of reinforced concrete in the construction of commercial structures clad in a repertory of classical motifs. He produced designs for some 120 commercial buildings, residences and apartment blocks, establishing the monumental character of West Armour Boulevard with more than a dozen colonnaded apartment blocks. Several of his structures are now registered in the National Register of Historic Places, and others contribute to their Historic District designations. Born in Clarksville, Ohio, McKechnie studied for two years at Wilmington College, Wilmington, Ohio, (1880–82) before entering Princeton University (AB, 1886), which he followed with two years at the Columbia School of Mines, New York City. He worked in New York for Cady, Berg & See, architects of the original Metropolitan Opera House and the American Museum of Natural History. McKechnie taught evening courses in architecture at the Brooklyn Institute of Arts and Sciences, predecessor of the Brooklyn Museum, and installed full-scale sections of the Parthenon Notre Dame de Paris and other structures at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York. In 1895 he toured Italy, documenting and drawing architecture. The results, supporting Prof. William H. Goodyear's theory that mathematical regularity in ancient buildings was the exception rather than the rule, was published in the Architectural Record, 1896-97. In 1897/98 McKechnie moved to the booming city of Kansas City, Missouri, to work at first as architect for the builders Hucke & Sexton. By 1900 he had opened his own practice; in 1914 he was joined by his long-term employee Frank Trask as partner."

A memorandum entered on the roll of parliament in 1290 records the delivery by him of a 'roll of peace and concord' made between the chancellor and scholars of the university and the mayor and burgesses of the city of Oxford to the clerk of the king's wardrobe for safe custody. He was summoned to parliament as a justice between 1295 and 1309, having been appointed a justice itinerant in 1292. In 1305 he was nominated receiver of petitions to the king in parliament emanating from Guernsey, with power to answer all petitions that did not require the personal attention of the king. At the time of his death in 1312, de Berewyk possessed estates in Surrey, Essex, Wiltshire, Hampshire, and Norfolk. He left an infant heir."

  "text" : "Jeffrey \"Jeff\" Herman (born 1959) is an American trial lawyer who specializes in representing victims of sexual abuse.He is most noted for exposing the clergy sexual abuse scandal in the Archdiocese of Miami and the Archdiocese of Denver. Herman is also noted for his landmark $100 million verdict on behalf of a client who was sexually abused by Rev. Neil Doherty, one of the largest verdicts ever against an individual priest. Said to be driven by his commitment to break the silence on child sexual abuse, Jeff consistently represents alleged victims of abuse. For over a decade, Herman has made national headlines exposing sexual predators and the institutions that protect them. He has been featured in The New York Times, USA Today, Forbes, People, and New York magazine and is a contributor to The O'Reilly Factor, MSNBC, and CNN. Herman has been recognized for his unique child forensic interviewing technique and he trains professionals from various child welfare organizations on how to help sexually abused children heal through disclosure. While on MSNBC discussing the Jerry Sandusky sex abuse scandal, Herman coined the term \"pedophile speak\", describing the way pedophiles talk about and justify abusing children. While discussing the sexual abuse lawsuits he filed against Kevin Clash, Herman told The Baltimore Sun it has been his goal to \"listen to sexual abuse victims and give them a voice.\" In an op-ed piece for Reuters about bringing down powerful men accused of rape, Herman said the role of the internet in sexual abuse cases is changing and it can play a positive, equalizing role enabling victims to come forward and speak up in support of others. Herman is the founding and managing partner of Herman Law. According to the Miami New Times, \"Herman is the country's leading attorney when it comes to handling high-profile sexual abuse lawsuits.\""

After visiting the United Kingdom and Europe in 1914, he enlisted with the Australian Imperial Force in 1915 and served with the Mining Corps until he was invalided home in 1917 and stationed at Molongolo Concentration Camp as the quartermaster. In 1922 he would receive the Volunteer Officers' Decoration. He was secretary of the Master Butchers' Federation until 1926. In 1926, Shand was elected to the New South Wales Legislative Assembly as a Nationalist member for Cumberland; when single-member districts were re-introduced in 1927 he became member for Hornsby. He was an honorary minister from 1935 to 1938, when he began to fall out with what had become the United Australia Party; he resigned from the party in 1941 and contested Ryde as an independent UAP candidate, winning the seat. He was re-elected in 1944 but died later that year."

  "text" : "John Jackson (fl. c. 1700 – 1717) was the first chaplain to the garrison at St John's, Newfoundland, and is credited with building the first Anglican church in Newfoundland and present day Canada. Jackson was appointed chaplain of the St. John's garrison in 1700 and sailed to Newfoundland with his wife and eight children in 1701. It is possible that Jackson also served as chaplain on Sir John Norris and Sir John Gibsone's 1697 expedition to the island. Initially, Jackson's salary of fifty pounds per annum depended on tithes from the civilian population, but by 1703 he was recognized by the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts. He arrived to a tense atmosphere, pitting officers against their soldiers and the town's civilians. Jackson consistently opposed the officers and was accused of sowing \"discord among the inhabitants\". Jackson repeatedly wrote to his superiors in England complaining about the behaviour of the officers, including Michael Richards and Thomas Lloyd. Over the winter of 1704–1705 a group of officers, including Richards and Lloyd, complained to the Board of Trade in London that Jackson was a disruptive influence and requested his recall. In 1705 Jackson and his family (now eleven children) left Newfoundland aboard Falkland. The ship ran aground in Sandwich Bay, Kent. No lives were lost, but the family lost most of their possessions. In 1709 Jackson took a post as curate in Dursley, Gloucestershire. He married a woman named Mary Bissett in 1710. (The fate of his first wife is unknown; she may have died in Newfoundland.) In the same year, he became rector of Uley."

In 1904 he became a produce and fuel merchant, later establishing John Ness, Son & Co. From 1909 to 1934 he was president of the Dulwich Hill School of Arts, and he served from 1908 to 1922 on Marrickville Council (mayor 1915–17, 1918–19). In 1922, he was elected to the New South Wales Legislative Assembly as a Nationalist member for Western Suburbs; with the reintroduction of single-member districts in 1927 he was elected to represent Dulwich Hill. Defeated in 1930, he was re-elected in 1932 as a United Australia Party candidate. Ness served until 1938; he died at Dulwich Hill in 1947."

The book was the winner of the 16th ILAB Breslauer Prize, awarded in 2014.

He drew daily cartoons in the paper during Woodrow Wilson's first presidential campaign and World War I. Knott's most famous cartoon character \"Old Man Texas\" was a champion for government honesty, low taxes and property ownership. It is believed his cartoons supporting American entry into World War I helped increase the sales of Liberty Bonds and donations towards the war effort. Knott's cartoons were reprinted in several publications including The Literary Digest, Review of Reviews, The Wall Street Journal, Los Angeles Times, New York Evening Post, the New York Herald Tribune, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, and the Philadelphia Public Ledger."

He was born in Gelderland but moved to the Southern Netherlands and later to Amsterdam, where his sons Arnoldus and Henricus were born. From about 1586 Jacob and his son Arnold produced globes, both terrestrial and celestial, the first ever produced in the northern Low Countries. Over the next fifty years, the van Langrens continued to revise and improve their engravings; Petrus Plancius collaborated on the 1589 edition. In 1592, the States General granted the Van Langren family a monopoly in the production of globes, which led to quarrels with Jodocus Hondius. Jacob died in Alkmaar in 1610, where he is buried in the Grote Kerk. His grandson Michael van Langren was also a cartographer."

In 1769 he returned to Scotland with a slave, one Joseph Knight, who, inspired by Somersett's Case in England, in which the English courts had held that slavery did not exist under English law, brought suit against Wedderburn for his freedom. Knight won his claim, establishing the principle that Scots law would not uphold the institution of slavery. Wedderburn ended his days as a wealthy country gentleman, having restored his family fortune and recovered the title Baronet of Blackness."

  "text" : "John Hervey (18 August 1616 – 18 January 1680) was an English courtier and politician who sat in the House of Commons from 1661 to 1679. He fought for the Royalist cause in the English Civil War. Hervey was the eldest son of Sir William Hervey of Ickworth and his first wife Susan Jermyn, daughter of Sir Robert Jermyn of Rushbrooke. He travelled abroad in 1636 and was at Leyden in 1637. From about 1641 to 1646 he was a gentleman of the privy chamber. He was a captain of horse in the Royalist army from 1642 to 1646. In 1646, he compounded on goods and chattels valued at £240, and was fined £24 on the Exeter articles. He succeeded to Ickworth on the death of his father in 1660. Hervey became J.P. for Suffolk in July 1660 and a commissioner for assessment for Suffolk in August 1660. In 1661, he was elected Member of Parliament for Hythe in the Cavalier Parliament. He was commissioner for assessment for Westminster from 1661 and commissioner for loyal and indigent officers for Suffolk in 1662. He was treasurer and receiver to Queen Catherine of Braganza from 1662 until his death. In 1664 he became Fellow of the Royal Society and was a leading shareholder in the Duke of York’s theatre. In parliament on one occasion he voted with the opposition and earned a reproof from the King. On the next day he went into the government lobby and when the King remarked \"You were not against me to-day\", Hervey replied \"No, sir. I was against my conscience to-day\". He was commissioner for assessment for Middlesex from 1673, commissioner for recusants in 1675 and commissioner for assessment for Norfolk from 1677. In 1677 he became a member of the Royal Fishery Company. Hervey died at the age of 64 and was buried at St Mary's Church, Ickworth. Hervey married Elizabeth Hervey, daughter of William Hervey, 1st Baron Hervey of Kidbrooke in 1658. He had no issue and the estate passed to his brother Sir Thomas Hervey."

Schinas lives aboard the self-built steel cruising yacht Mollymawk with her family. The family's adventures aboard their previous yacht Maamari ended in disaster in 1996 when the boat was capsized in a storm off the Falkland Islands; an event widely covered by popular British newspapers such as the Daily Mail, The Times, The Telegraph, and The Independent. Schinas later wrote a book about the family's adventures. (A Family Outing in the Atlantic, Imperator, London, ISBN 978-0-9560722-3-8). Schinas works as a freelance nautical journalist, and frequently writes for the main British yachting magazines including Yachting World, Yachting Monthly, and Practical Boat Owner. She has written a series of articles for Practical Boat Owner about the building of the family's second yacht in South Africa, and has written a book on the subject, How NOT to Build a Boat (Imperator, London, Aug 2013, ISBN 978-0-9560722-2-1). In the past she has written under her married name Jill Schinas, but she now prefers to use the name Jill Dickin Schinas. Schinas is also the author of Kids in the Cockpit: A Pilot Book to Safe and Happy Sailing with Children (Adlard Coles Nautical, Sep 2005, ISBN 9780713672299), and often writes on the subject of sailing with children. Besides her career in writing and journalism, Schinas is a prolific artist. In the past she produced line-drawings of her home port, Chichester Harbour (about which she has also written a history book, Chichester Harbour: The Thirteen Villages, published by the Chichester Harbour Conservancy). Jill paints and draws under her maiden name, Jill Dickin."

In the late 1980s the military wing (APLA) of the PAC was disbanded and their focus became political and social issues. Jan Shoba was arrested in 1984 and placed in Robben Island Prison. He managed to get the prison authorities to agree to a delivery of the Zimbabwean daily The Herald. He was thus able to supply the PAC on Robben Island with valuable information regarding political developments. In 1990, following the negotiated Harare Declaration he was released from jail. He was placed in charge of party security, which may have played a part in his demise. In a Truth and Reconciliation report it was stated that Jan Shoba trained members of the PAC in the use of firearms in June 1991. At the time the PAC developed the \"Great Storm\" operation, designed to instill fear in farmers. Jan Shoba's possible involvement in the \"Great Storm\" could be the reason for his demise. He was assassinated outside his yard in Atteridgeville - his killers are still unknown. In May 2012, Duncan Street in Pretoria was renamed Jan Shoba."

In 1937, he became a member of the Young Communist League of Yugoslavia, and the next year a member of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia. After invasion of Yugoslavia by Axis powers in 1941, he was one of the organizers of the shock groups at the railway in Zagreb. He participated in a few diversions: attack at the Gestapo agents in Bukovačka street and theft of 60 rifles, 10,000 bullets and some hand grenades from Germans' wagons at the West railway station in Zagreb. Gredelj was arrested by the Ustashe in the summer of 1941. He was tortured in prison, but said nothing. He was set free, since there was not enough evidences to prove his guilt. After that, he was appointed to work in illegal press cell of the Communist Party of Croatia in Klaićeva street. Ustasha agents discovered illegal press room on 23 December 1941, and tried to arrest Gredelj. He started shooting and tried to escape, but was mortally wounded. He was transported to Vinogradska street hospital where he soon died of wounds. He was posthumously proclaimed a People's Hero of Yugoslavia in 1951. A company TŽV Gredelj bears the name after him."

  "text" : "Johan Andreas Altenburg (1763–1824) was a Norwegian merchant and shipowner. He belonged to the patriciate of the port town of Skien and was the grandfather of Henrik Ibsen. Johan Andreas Altenburg was born at Lille Ulefos, in Telemark, Norway. He was the son of sawmill manager Diderik Altenburg (1719–1766) and Marichen Johansdatter Barth (1737–1769). His parents died early. He was originally a ship's captain, but stopped sailing at a relatively young age. Altenburg owned several ships, a farm and a large brewery in the community of Bratsberg. He married Hedevig Christine Paus (1763–1848), a sister of shipowner Ole Paus and Martha Paus (married Blom). His sister, Kristine Cathrine Ploug, lived with him and his family following the death of her husband in 1799. He was the father of Marichen Altenburg (1799–1869) and thus the maternal grandfather of playwright Henrik Ibsen. Following his death and his daughter's marriage to Knud Ibsen in 1825, his considerable fortune passed to his son-in-law, who however went almost bankrupt due to failed speculations in the mid-1830s. Almost the entire family fortune was lost by 1835. The Ibsen family had lived at the stately Altenburg Manor in central Skien, until Knud Ibsen's bankruptcy force them to move. The Altenburg Manor burned to the ground in the 1886 fire which also reduced much of Skien to ruins in 1886 after which the center of town was rebuilt."

Born in Dunblane in 1794, Liddell was educated at the University of Edinburgh before joining the Royal Navy where he saw service at the Battle of Navarino (1827). During a period as director of Malta's Bighi Naval Hospital (1827–1844), he served on HMS Barham during Sir Walter Scott's 1831 voyage to Naples. He was appointed inspector of fleets and hospitals in 1844. He was elected a fellow of the Royal Society on 18 June 1846, knighted in 1848, appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath in 1850 and promoted to Knight Commander on 9 February 1864. Succeeding Sir William Burnett, his time as Director-General coincided with the Crimean War, which brought him into contact with Florence Nightingale with whom he was subsequently in occasional contact regarding hospital design; at his request, Nightingale inspected Haslar Hospital in January 1857, and he later accompanied her on a visit to Chatham hospital. Liddell died at his London home at 72 Chester Square, and was buried on 2 June 1868 in the Greenwich Hospital's cemetery (today East Greenwich Pleasaunce)."

He wrote a number of works for keyboard and chamber ensembles, many of a pedagogical nature, and at least two one-act operas. He became music master to the Princess of Orange. There is much uncertainty about his date of birth (variously given as 1750, 1758, or 1760) and date and place of death. It appears that he was born in Gröningen in Germany, but a number of reference articles have confused this with Groningen in the east of the Netherlands. Some of his works have been recorded by the German ensemble Trio 1790."

During the Civil War, the couple sold most of their real estate holdings and donated the money to the cause of the Confederate States of America. When her husband was appointed to oversee hospitals during the war, she went to work converting tobacco factories into hospitals. She made daily visits to the wounded, and received a battlefield injury in the course of her duties. Her husband died within months of the close of the war, and she spent the rest of her life in poverty. When she died, she was interred with a full military burial at Arlington National Cemetery, with the Alabama congressional delegation serving as her pallbearers. In 1991, she was inducted into the Alabama Women's Hall of Fame."

  "text" : "Johnny Banks (born December 25, 1861 in Richmond, Virginia), was an African American boxer who fought under the sobriquet \"The Darkey Wizard\" and was the Negro Middleweight Champion of the World during the mid-1880s. Standing 5'6\" tall (some sources claim he was 5'5.5\" tall), Banks fought out of New York City at a weight of 128-160 lbs. from 1883 to 1899. In his career, he racked up an official record of 11 wins (three by K.O.) against eight losses (being K.O.ed three times) and 17 draws. Most of his fights went unrecorded. Boxing historian Nat Fleischer claimed that he fought as many as five times a week in Philadelphia and he averaged a fight per week for five years. Fleischer claimed that Banks won over 90% of his bouts. Reportedly, Banks contorted his mouth as he fought and snorted, grunted, and yelled while in the ring. He was a very smart boxer with a good right. He claimed the Negro Middleweight title but lost it to James Desverney on January 26, 1887 in a fight in New York City when he was disqualified in the ninth round."

Stephen died the same year and John succeeded him as Duke of Slavonia, with his mother Margaret as regent. John did not only assume the Duchy of Slavonia on his father's death; the newborn also became heir presumptive to the throne of his paternal uncle, King Louis I of Hungary. King Louis I requested that his maternal uncle, King Casimir III of Poland, adopt John as his heir presumptive, which he did in 1355. Duchess Margaret remarried in 1356, but kept the regency over the duchy. However, a war broke out between the Kingdom of Hungary and the Republic of Venice in the spring of the same year and the royal court decided to end Slavonia's autonomy. John died in 1360. He was survived by both his uncle Louis and his granduncle Casimir, and consequently never ascended either throne. His older sister Elizabeth replaced him as heir presumptive to the Hungarian throne."

A native of Drumrany, Ballymore, County Westmeath, Beatty emigrated to the USA in 1839, landing in Brooklyn, New York, where he worked as a bricklayer. By 1860 he had moved to Chicago and was a member of the Illinois militia, being \"actively engaged in the commissary department\" upon the outbreak of the American Civil War. \"About this time Mr. Beatty commenced his musical studies under the instruction of the veteran piper James Quinn ... A good set of Egan pipes which he owned were laid aside after Billy Taylor of Philadelphia had developed a more powerful instrument. ... With the first returns from a lucrative position, a carte blanche order for a new set of pipes was given Mr. Taylor, and it was on this triumph of the great pipermaker’s art that John K. Beatty so distinguished himself. ... So supreme was he at lilting that on hearing him vocalize a tune in that way, the renowned Taylor said: “Ah, Mr. Beatty, if you could only play it that way you’d be a wonder.” But he cou1dn’t. Neither could anyone else, for such rhythmic staccato was beyond their powers of execution.\"\"Mr. Beatty’s headlong execution on his superb set of pipes was as much of a surprise to Tarlach Mac Suibhne, the “Donegal Piper,” as was his lilting. After watching his acrobatic performance on the huge instrument for a time, McSweeney remarked quizzically: “Begor, Mr. Beatty, you have a great shower of fingers.” And so he had.\"\"In the exuberance of his spirits and anxiety to impress his audience with a due sense of his superlative execution, he not infrequently left much to be desired in the way of rhythmic precision, it must be confessed; and if the drones and regulators after a round or two of such strenuosity insisted on disagreeing with the chanter, it must not be regarded as a reflection on the maker, or the conduct of the instrument under milder treatment.\"\"Like a true bard he composed and sang his own songs, mainly on topical subjects, and had his practice on the pipes been commenced in his youth instead of his manhood, the true spirit of the minstrel so dominant in his character would doubtless have gained him more enduring fame.\" By the time Captain O'Neill published his book in 1913, Beatty had grown \"enfeebled by age and no longer able to play in the manner described.\""
