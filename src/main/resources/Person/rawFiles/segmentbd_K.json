  "text" : "Kari Korhonen (born July 24, 1943, Sotkamo) is a Finnish mycologist and forest pathologist, known for his studies of fungi causing root rot. Korhonen graduated as a biologist from the University of Helsinki in 1968. He made his career as a researcher at the Finnish Forest Research Institute in Helsinki, beginning in 1973. From the start his research concentrated on the forest pathogen fungi then known as Heterobasidion annosum and Armillaria mellea. During his career over 40 years he collected more than 4000 isolates of these species in Scandinavia, Germany, Italy, Greece, USA, Canada, Estonia, Belarus, Siberia and China. Initially, following Veikko Hintikka's discovery of a technique to distinguish between Armillaria species by growing them together as single spore isolates on petri dishes and observing changes in the morphology of the cultures, Korhonen showed in 1978 that the European Armillaria mellea species complex could be separated into five reproductively isolated species. Similarly he studied the sexual incompatibility of bipolar systems also in Heterobasidion. As result of these studies the genus Heterobasidion was divided into three species while Armillaria has by now been divided into more than 40 species. Korhonen has published more than 50 scientific papers in international journals and edited books, almost all dealing with root rot fungi and their antagonists. For his pioneering work, he received an honorary doctorate from the University of Monaco of Bavaria in 1992. Fungal species named in honor of Korhonen include Entoloma korhoneni (Noordeloos 2004) and Hygrophorus korhonenii (Harmaja 1985)."

How much was their salary?\" Until now, most of the cases we have encountered are cases of people who were poor and lived in poor neighborhoods.

  "text" : "Khaled Ali (also spelled Khaled Aly; Arabic: خالد على‎‎, IPA: [ˈxæːled ˈʕæli]) (born February 26, 1972) is a prominent Egyptian lawyer and activist. He is known for his advocacy for reform of government and private sector corruption and for promoting social justice and labor rights. Ali is the former head of the Egyptian Center for Economic and Social Rights (ECESR) and co-founder of the Front for Defending Egypt's Protesters and the Hisham Mubarak Law Center (HMLC). He has been called a \"legendary anti-corruption crusader\" and \"Egypt’s best-known counselor and defender of independent unions and worker protests.\" He won the “Egyptian Corruption Fighter” award in 2011. He has been involved in several prominent court cases against the government, including a 2001 ruling that gave syndicates more freedoms, a 2010 case he won that mandated a higher minimum wage for workers, and a case leading to the nationalization of three large companies that had been privatized. Ali was an activist before, during, and after the 2011 Egyptian Revolution. He has been involved in worker strikes before and since the downfall of Mubarak's regime, and been an active supporter of the role of workers in the revolution and the labor mobilization that took place during it. He has denounced violent acts by the police and military, and has represented revolutionaries and the families of those killed in court. In February 2011, Ali was detained in a raid by Egyptian security forces on the HMLC. He is against the rule of the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces and supports postponing the drafting of a new constitution until after the 2012 election. A latecomer to the 2012 presidential race, Ali announced his candidacy the day after he became eligible to run, making him the youngest candidate in Egypt's upcoming election. His platform is one of social and economic justice, including core issues like regional economic strength, protecting natural resources, fighting corruption, addressing unemployment, and improving workers' rights. Ali lays great stress on education, which he believes will lift Egypt out of poverty. He seeks a balance between the public and private sectors. Ali does not belong to a political party and never has belonged to one. He calls himself the \"candidate of the poor\". He is supported primarily by students, activists, farmers, and workers, generally on the left of the political spectrum. Ali's campaign slogan is \"We will fulfill our dream\"."

He was the leader of the clan that lived around the Waterberg. Kambazembi was a cousin of Maharero. He took over the chieftainship from his father Kangombe in 1860 and reigned until his death. He was known to be friendly with all people, including Whites. He however was in fierce opposition to selling land to an encroaching wave of white settlers (probably early participants of the Dorsland Trek), and to German colonial occupation. He also took pride in conserving Herero culture, leading the life of a nomad and continuing to wear hides instead of the Victorian dress code introduced by the missionaries. When he died in September 1903, his sons divided the clan area. David Kaonjonga Kambazembi became chief of the Waterberg, Salatiel Kambazembi took over the rest of the land."

The Innis Arden Cottage, built in 1903, has been recognized as a seminal example of early Bungalow-style architecture and was the subject of an award-winning restoration by the Greenwich Point Conservancy between 2006-2011. Budd had been practicing architecture for over 30 years when she applied for recognition by the American Institute of Architects. She became the first woman member of the New York chapter of the AIA in 1924. She designed \"Hostess Houses\" for the YWCA in the South and Mid-west. Some of her buildings include: \n*  Burchel House, alterations, 29 E. 63rd St. N.Y. (1908) \n*  Anna Winegar Studio, alterations, Bronxville, NY (not dated) \n*  Harry C. Duncan House, Tavares, FL (1925), National Register, 1997 \n*  M.G. Howey House, Lake County, FL, (National Register, 1983)"

  "text" : "Katsuaki Asai (born 1942) is a Japanese aikidoka who is the founder of Aikikai in Germany, and is the highest ranked aikidoka in that country. Asai started training under aikido's founder Morihei Ueshiba aged 13, at the Hombu dojo in Tokyo, and continued during his studies at Meiji University. He was sent to Germany by Kisshomaru Ueshiba in 1965 to teach aikido, and has lived in the country ever since. His first occupation was to teach aikido to policemen in Münster, and he now runs a school in Düsseldorf. In the early days of German aikido, Asai clashed with the Deutscher Judobund (DJB) over whether his art should be included under their organisation. In this, he was opposed by Gerd Wischenewski, another student of Ueshiba, who was also a prominent member of the DJB. Although the DJB retained an aikido division, Asai remained independent of them and continued to operate as part of the Aikikai. He retains the German trademark on the term \"Aikikai.\""

  "text" : "Karsten Pflum (born 8 June 1960) is the moniker of Jacob Helverskov Madsen, Danish electronic music producer and DJ. Inspired equally by 1980s synth pop, Detroit techno, and Nordic folk-music, Karsten Pflum started experimenting with old synthesizers and sequencers in the middle of the 90's using the name Slaphead Faun. After discarding that name he released his first album Tracks on the label Worm Interface in 2003, soon followed by EPs and full length releases on labels like Jenka Music, Tender Productions, Suburban Trash Industries, Mindwaves (where Slaphead Faun rose again as an album title), Ad Noiseam and Hymen Records (Ant-Zen). His music has been broadcast by famous British DJs John Peel, Mary Anne Hobbs and Karl Hyde of Underworld, and he has toured in places like Scandinavia, Germany, Switzerland, Belgium, UK, Spain, Turkey and China. Over the years he became part of the intriguing and very talented young Danish school of electronica and a driving force of the North European electronic music scene. Currently he lives in Berlin and studied electronic music at the academy in his former hometown of Aarhus. In his work, he explores the boundaries of heavy bass driven dubstep, frantic d'n'b and breakcore, combining soulful soundscapes with complex rhythm programming and treatments."

  "text" : "Karl Rose was a naval officer in the German Imperial Navy who served under Karl August Nerger aboard the ''SMS Wolf'' (auxiliary cruiser) during World War I. During the Wolf's epic 451-day sortie, Rose became Nerger's second in command after the death of kapitänleutnant Iwan Brandes. Rose was made prize captain of two separate ships during the voyage; the Japanese mailship Hitachi Maru, and the coal freighter Igotz Mendi. On the 7th of November, 1917, the order was given to sink The Hitachi Maru in order to preserve what little coal there was for the Wolf's engines. However, Rose would soon be given command of another prize ship ten days later with the capture of the Igotz Mendi. Rose would command the Igotz Mendi for the rest of the voyage back to Germany. Rose's fortunes would change when he accidentally ran his ship aground on the beaches of Denmark. While passing through a minefield laid by the German Navy, Rose spotted mistook a lighthouse for a German patrol boat. Eventually several Danish warships arrived and Rose attempted to pass the vessel off as a civilian German merchant ship. However, the Danish sailors were not fooled and refused Rose's requests to be towed, despite his best efforts to maintain control of the situation and return to the ship back to Wilhelmshaven as a prize. Once aground, Rose and the entire crew were detained by the Danish military police. This caused a great deal of political bitterness between Denmark and Germany. There was speculation that Kaiser Wilhelm II would declare war on Denmark for the Danish government's refusal to turn Rose and his men over to the Reich. Rose was held in Danish prison for the remainder of the war. After leaving the Navy, became a merchant officer with the Hamburg America Line and served with them until he died."

During World War II, Hak-sun was among many young women forced into sexual slavery by the Japanese Imperial Army. She was the first woman to come forward about the plight of the comfort woman. As the first to share her story, she helped to bring to the public's attention the issue of Japanese sex slavery during the Pacific War when she went public with her story in August, 1991. At a press conference, she described her suffering as a comfort woman. She said that seeing the Japanese imperial flag \"still makes me shudder. Until now, I did not have the courage to speak, even though there are so many thing I want to say.\"  In December, 1991, she filed a class-action lawsuit against the Japanese government. At that time, she was the first of what would become dozens of women from Korea, China, Taiwan, the Philippines, Indonesia, and the Netherlands who came forward to tell their stories of being forced to be sex slaves of Japanese military. She was the lead plaintiff and initially the only one to use her real name in connection with the case. She was inspired to finally take her story public after 40 years of silence, by the growth of the women's rights movement in South Korea. Kim died in 1997, with the court case still ongoing."

She lost her sight due to cataracts at the age of four. She initially had to leave school, before attending a school for the blind from the age of six. In 1999 Ifill became the first blind person to graduate from the University of the West Indies, gaining a degree in Sociology and Psychology from Cave Hill Campus in her native Barbados. She went on to obtain an MBA at Durham Business School, in England. She had initially considered studying law, with an aim to become a lawyer, but believed she would be unable to achieve that as a blind person, a belief she subsequently regretted. In 2008  Barbadian Prime Minister David Thompson appointed her to the Senate, and subsequently to the position of deputy President of the Senate. On 14 March 2012, Prime Minister Freundel Stuart announced that, the following week, he would appoint Ifill President of the Senate. She became the first woman to hold that position, and the first person with a disability, as well as the youngest ever holder of the position, at the age of 38. She succeeded Branford Taitt (in office 2008-2012). Ifill also serves as President of the Barbados Council for the Disabled."

  "text" : "Kaare Langlo (October 7, 1913 in Bergen, Norway – October 7, 1985 in Oslo) was a Norwegian meteorologist. He contributed to establishing meteorology as an important scientific field both in Norway and internationally. Langlo was assistant general secretary of the World Meteorological Organization (WMO). Langlo grew up in Bergen and received his examen artium (baccalaureate) at Sydneshaugens skole in 1932. He earned a Cand.Real. degree in 1941 and his Ph.D. in 1953 both from the University of Oslo. From 1940 to 1943 he was at the Auroral Observatory in Tromsø. In 1944 he was at the Christian Michelsens Institutt in Bergen and in 1945 at Meteorological Office in London. Langlo was a meteorologist at the Meteorological Institute in Oslo 1943–1945 and department head 1945–1952. Langlo held leading positions at the secretariat of the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) from 1952 to 1975. He played an important role in establishing international programs such as World Weather Watch and Global Atmospheric Research Programme. From 1970 he was assistant general secretary. From 1976 he was senior advisor to the Norwegian Meteorological Institute and from 1978 to 1983 Langlo was director of the institute. During his time at the institute he was promoting internationalization and he was eagerly working for Norwegian membership of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts in Reading in Great Britain. Norway eventually became a member, but that was after he had retired from the director chair. He published several geophysical reports and articles and is most well known for establishing links between the ozone layer and meteorological conditions. In particular, as early as 1952 he associated low ozone levels in the stratosphere to the presence of polar stratospheric clouds (PSCs). Kaare Langlo was named Knight, First Class of Order of St. Olav in 1975 for his contribution to international meteorological collaboration. From 1960 to 1970 he was member of the International Ozone Commission."

Grote studied archaeology [pre- and proto-history] at Göttingen University, writing his master's thesis on the Mesolithic in the southern Lower Saxony hill country. His doctorate from Hamburg University on prehistoric settlement usage of the abris in the Buntsandsteingebiet near Göttingen was completed in 1994. He worked at the Niedersächsischen Institut für Denkmalpflege (Archäologie) in Hannover from 1977 to 1979. Since 1979 he has been the archaeologist for Göttingen county [Landkreis]. In 1997 Grote was given the sponsorship award of the Dr. Helmut und Hannelore Greve Stiftung für Wissenschaften und Kultur. In 1998 Grote surprised the German archaeological community by demonstrating the presence of a Roman camp in Hedemünden, farther north-east than any previously known Roman presence. Other significant work, all in southern Lower Saxony, has been the extensive surveying and excavations around Seeburger See, including a motte-and-bailey and a refuge fort in Bernshausen, and Medieval abandoned villages."

  "text" : "Kārlis Kaufmanis (February 21, 1910, Riga, Latvia – June 21, 2003, Clearwater, Florida) was a Latvian-American astronomer. He is noted for his theory, on which he delivered a public lecture more than a thousand times, that the Star of Bethlehem was a conjunction of the planets Jupiter and Saturn that took place in 7 BC. He was also the author of several textbooks on astronomy, mathematics, and cosmology. He held positions at the University of Latvia (1936–40), the French Lyceum (1940–44), and the Esslinger Gymnasium in Germany (1945–48). He moved to Gustavus Adolphus College in St. Peter, Minnesota as an associate professor in 1949. He joined the University of Minnesota as a visiting lecturer in 1961 and became an associate professor in 1963. He held the rank of full professor from 1970 until his retirement in 1978. From time to time the School of Physics and Astronomy at the University of Minnesota holds the Karlis Kaufmanis Public Lecture. Speakers have included Clyde Tombaugh, discoverer of the dwarf planet Pluto, Carolyn Porco, noted for imaging work on the Voyager missions, and Michael E. Brown, discoverer of several dwarf planets in the Kuiper belt."

Penka studied anthropology from the point of view of comparative linguistics and took a particular interest in the origins of the Indo-Europeans. He used the term Aryan in the linguistic sense and also extended it into a broad term of race and culture. It was he who popularized the theory that the Aryan race had emerged in Scandinavia and could be identified by the Nordic characteristics of blue eyes and blond hair. In his Origines Ariacae ('Origins of the Aryans') of 1883 he proposed that the Indo-European homeland was in the far north, the Hyperborea of antiquity. Penka has been called \"a transitional figure between Aryanism and Nordicism\". Penka died in Vienna in 1912. He is now seen as a pioneer of racist and anti-Semitic theories in ethnology."

He was the son of King Huanhui of Han. In 233 BC, King An sent Han Fei to Qin to request to be a vassal. However, Han Fei was executed. In 231 BC, King An offered Nanyang (南阳), an area around modern day Mount Wangwu, to Qin. In the 9th month of the same year, Qin sent Neshi Teng (内史腾) to receive the area. In the following year (230 BC), Qin sent Neishi Teng to attack Han. King An was captured and the State of Han ceased to exist. Qin then created Yingchuan Commandery from conquered Han territory. In 226 BC, ex-Han nobility launched a failed rebellion, and An died the same year."

  "text" : "Andreas Heinrich Karl Brandt (23 May 1854, Schönebeck near Magdeburg – 7 January 1931, Kiel) was a German zoologist and marine biologist. He studied natural sciences in Berlin, receiving his doctorate in 1877 at the University of Halle. Following graduation he served as an assistant to Emil Du Bois-Reymond (1818–1896) at the physiological institute of the University of Berlin. From 1882 to 1885 he worked at the zoological station in Naples, and in 1885 obtained his habilitation from the University of Königsberg under the direction of Carl Chun (1852–1914). From 1888 he was a professor of zoology at the University of Kiel, where he also served as director of the zoological institute and museum. Additionally, from 1887 to 1913 he taught classes at the German Imperial Naval Academy. In 1922 Brandt became professor emeritus, and in 1924 was appointed chairman of the Preußischen wissenschaftlichen Kommission zur Untersuchung der deutschen Meere (Prussian Scientific Commission for the Investigation of German seas). He is known for his research on the role that dissolved nitrogen and phosphorus compounds play upon oceanic life. He also made contributions in his morphological and systematic studies of radiolarians and tintinnids. In 1889 he participated in the Plankton-Expedition under the direction of Victor Hensen (1835–1924). From the expedition Brandt introduced new ideas about adaptation and propagation in regards to deep-sea life."

  "text" : "Katarina Majerhold (born May 20, 1971) is a Slovenian philosopher with a particular interest in philosophy of emotions, especially in philosophy of love and happiness in connection to immune system, philosophy of clowning (red noses), philosophical counseling and ethics. Majerhold is currently an independent researcher and lecturer of philosophy of emotions (such as happiness, love, joy, compassion, kindness). She previously worked at the Slovenian Educational Research Institute where she held the rank of a young researcher/assistant and worked on higher education for many years. In that time she wrote and edited three important books on Slovenian higher education (University and Its Autonomy (1999), University and Its Power (2001), Does University Need Its Social Environment (2003) Ljubljana, Študentska založba). In her early career as a philosopher of love she mostly worked on learning of the western concepts of love and which prevailing concept of love each period in history offered (Empedocles' Love (Eros) and Strife (Neikos), Plato's Eros and Aristotle's Philia, St. Paul's Agape and St. Augustine Caritas, Rousseau's notion of a modern romantic pair of Email and Sophie, Freud's love as transference and Nussbaum's compassionate, reciprocal, erotic and individual love). However, this does not mean that each representative concept of the period speaks of a totally new or innovative concept of love, many of them are interdependent and/or modification of the other. However, in the last few years she has started developing her own concept of love as an art work (i.e. installation), imagining love as innovative, individual and common process at the same time. Her latest development is connecting love and happiness with strong immune system and for this reason she has been developing a philosophy of clowning which has a similar aim and effect as doctors-clowns-red noses only that philosophers achieve the effects through playful, kind, compassionate and witty dialogue using imaginative, critical, emphatic and kind thinking. Her dedication to love is seen in numerous articles she wrote about the topic, such as love and happiness, love and gift, love and art, love and truth, love and politics, love: top-down or bottom-up and alike in the scholarly magazines at home and abroad. However, she did not write not only articles but also books on love, sexuality and emotions: Love in Philosophy(from Plato to Freud, Psihopolis, Novi Sad 2012), Living (Koda, Študentska založba, Ljubljana 2012), Concepts of Love Through History (Modrijan, Ljubljana 2012). She wrote article The Gift in What Philosophy Can Tell You About Your Lover (Open Court, Chicago and LaSalle, Illinois, 2012). She also does art, especially writing screenplays for documentaries and films through which she tries to convey her knowledge and experiences in the area of love, sexuality, happiness and play (she is the author of documentaries, such as Love and Emotions, fabrics of our lives', The Future of Clothing, 2008–2010, Radio-television Slovenia, forthcoming Attraction of the Sexes). She is all about philosophy with heart (love), humour and joy. Majerhold is also a humanitarian, and dedicates her time, knowledge and energy to people in need."

He was the son of King Xiang of Han. In 293 BC, King Xi sent Gongsun Xi (公孙喜) to lead an alliance of Han, Wei, and Zhou forces of 240,000 to attack Qin. The resulting Battle of Yique ended in alliance defeat and capture of Gongsun Xi. The defeated troops were executed and Han lost an additional 5 cities according to Zizhi Tongjian. In 295 BC, Qin attacked and took Wan (宛), modern-day Nanyang, Henan. In 296 BC, Han ceded 200 li around Wusui (武遂), southwest of modern Linfen or southeast of modern Yuanqu County, to Qin. In 286 BC, Qin defeated a Han army in Xiashan (夏山), within modern-day Yuzhou, Henan. In 284 BC, King Xi met with King Zhao of Qin in Western Zhou (西周国) to form an alliance against Qi. According to Zizhi Tongjian, the alliance was led by Yan and also included Wei and Zhao. The alliance sacked the capital of Qi. King Min of Qi initially escaped capture, but was eventually executed. In 275 BC, Qin attacked Wei. Han sent Bao Zheng (暴蒸) or Bao Yuan (暴鸢) to help Wei, but was defeated. Qin executed 40,000 Han soldiers. In 273 BC, Wei and Zhao attacked Han at Huayang (华阳), in modern-day Xinzheng. Han requested helped from Qin, but Qin would not help. Han again requested help, this time sending Chen Shi (陈筮). The chancellor of Qin, Wei Ran (魏冉), received Chen Shi and asked whether he was sent because of the desperate state in Han. Chen Shi replied no. Wei Ran became angry and asked why Chen Shi claimed the situation was fine when Han repeatedly asked for help. Chen replied that if the situation was truly desperate, Han would have sought protectorship from a different state. Wei Ran immediately sent help and defeated Wei and Zhao at Huayang. King Xi died in 273 BC and was succeeded by his son King Huanhui of Han."

  "text" : "Keith Spaith (April 8, 1923 – March 1, 1976) was an award winning, Grey Cup champion and all-star Canadian football player for the Calgary Stampeders from 1948 to 1954. Spaith played his college football first with Saint Mary's College of California and then later transferred to University of Southern California. In 1947 he played one season in the Pacific Coast Professional Football League, with Hawaiian Warriors. His team finished 7–2 and won the league title, but was rocked with scandal when it was discovered players had bet on games. Spaith was one of 14 suspended. He joined the Calgary Stampeders in 1948 and his first two seasons were the stuff of legend. In his rookie season he led the Stamps to an undefeated 12–0 record (the last team in Canadian professional football to do so) and won the Grey Cup. In that victory he played all 60 minutes, and even intercepted a pass. He was also an all-star and winner of the Jeff Nicklin Memorial Trophy as best player in the west. In 1949 the Cowboys went 13–1, but lost the Grey Cup to the Montreal Alouettes. Regardless, once again Spaith was an all-star and MVP award winner. The Stamps, under his leadership, had a 25-win and 1-loss regular season record in his first two years. Spaith played five more seasons with Calgary. He completed 555 of 1166 passes for 8906 yards, with 23 touchdown passes and 52 interceptions. He also punted 397 times. After his football career, he returned to the United States and worked in the construction business. He and his wife Betty and two sons and a daughter. His oldest son, Robert Spaith, is a well-known sculptor in Alberta, Canada. He died, age 52, in March 1976. In 2002 he was inducted into the Stampeders Alumni Wall of Fame."

  "text" : "Keri Pickett (born in 1959, Charleston, S.C.) is an award-winning American photographer, author and filmmaker whose work explores love, family and community. Pickett’s work \"pulls subjects from the edges of public awareness to the center of the frame\". Pickett was first exposed to photography as a child through her figure-skater/photographer uncle Roy Blakey and years later, as an adult, she made a film about his life. Pickett discovered her own love of photography in college and graduated with a B.A. degree in photography from Moorhead State University in Minnesota with minors in Art History and Women's Studies. After graduation in 1983, Pickett moved in with her photographer uncle Roy Blakey in New York for a short time while starting an internship under the direction of American photographer Fred W. McDarrah at Village Voice. In 1987, after Pickett was diagnosed with Burkett's lymphoma, a rare cancer characterized by the rapid growth of tumors in the body, she left New York and returned to her home in Minnesota to begin chemotherapy. During the two years of Pickett’s treatment, she concentrated on her photographic work: Kids Coping with Life-Threatening Illness. Where once she had thought she was too young to die, Pickett's paradigm shifted as she photographed and became friends with children in the hospital who were dying of cancer. Pickett says, \"When I was on chemotherapy I was so upbeat and positive that this started coming out in my pictures. I was a positive example to people. I started taking photos of kids with life-threatening illnesses, and my work switched....I starting putting more of myself into the work.\""

Mary Logan Barmeyer says Clark's work is \"meant to make you think twice about what it means to be human, and furthermore, what it means to be animal.\" Writer Monica Ramirez-Montagut says Clark's works \"reclaim storytelling and vintage techniques as strategies to address contemporary discourses on welfare, the environment, and female struggles.\""

  "text" : "Klaas Sybrandi (Haarlem, 18 November 1807 - Haarlem, 4 September 1872), also spelled as Sijbrandi, was a Dutch Mennonite minister, author, translator and involved with several societies and foundations. Sybrandi was born as son of the Haarlem Mennonite minister Sybren Klazes Sybrandi and enjoyed a privileged education. First he attended Latin school in Haarlem, and was then, 17 years of age, admitted 'with high expectations' at the Kweekschool der algemeene Doopsgezinde Societeit te Amsterdam (Seminary of the General Mennonite Society in Amsterdam) where he developed an affection for classical literature - supposedly larger than his interest in theology. In 1827 he was promoted to doctor in literature at the Leidsche Hoogeschool. In 1830 he became minister of the Mennonite congregation in Nijmegen (in the far east of the Netherlands), in 1832 he refused a position in Middelburg (in the far southwest) but in 1834 he did accept a new position in Groningen, a university city in the north of the country, to lead the congregation there. In 1838 he finally moved back to his home town to become minister at the Doopsgezinde kerk, Haarlem. Already in Nijmegen he published some works about literature and in Groningen he made friends under the university teachers there. In 1841 his work Verhandeling over Vondel en Shakespear als Treurspeldichters was awarded a gold medal by Teylers Tweede Genootschap (Teylers Second or Scientific society) and he became main editor of Konst- en Letterbode until 1853 (following the sudden death of the previous main editor, Vincent Loosjes). He initially only planned to do this for a short while but then continued to do so and wrote many pieces for the literary magazine - several of which anonymously. Sybrandi was above all however a minister and Mennonite teacher, and spoke out against the unification of all Protestant churches into one single church. Shortly after his arrival in Haarlem Sybrandi became a member of Teylers Eerste Genootschap (Teylers First or Theological Society), and after the death of his father in 1858 he would succeed him as director at the Teylers Stichting (Teylers Foundation). In 1844 he joined the Algemeene Doopsgezinde Sociëteit (General Mennonite Society) of which he would become chairman of the board in 1849/1850 and 1857/1858. He was also a member of the Maatschappij van Nederlandsche Letterkunde (Society of Dutch Literature) in Leiden. Sybrandi retired in 1871 (although he feared modernist successors) and died in 1872. He married the daughter of Mennonite minister Nicolaas Swart, but they did not have any children."

He was subsequently a politician in North Korea, holding posts connected to the Workers' Party of Korea. Born in 1898 at Ulsan, in 1920 he moved to Japan and studied mathematics at Nihon University in Tokyo. While there, he organized a Korean workers' movement and was elected chairman of the Federal Union of Zainichi Koreans. Detained as a political prisoner, he was released on 10 October 1945 after Japan's defeat in the Second World War, and became a member of the executive committee of the JCP. Although the League of Koreans was founded as a non-political organization, his appointment as supreme adviser ensured its drift toward the left. Under Kim's influence, the League purged its anti-communist members and in February 1946 it joined the Korean Democratic National Front. In 1951, Edward Wagner described Kim as \"the man who probably is to be credited more than any other with shaping the League's political orientation and preserving its undeviating character\". He subsequently moved to North Korea in 1950 and became a member of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea, and from April 1956 he served as chairman of the Fatherland Front. He remained in the Front's presidium through the first half of the 1960s. North Korean official sources state that Kim died in 1969, but the actual date and circumstances of his death are unknown."

Havard was elected to the position in general election held on November 19, 2011. The incumbent Tom McVea, a former Democrat-turned Republican was term-limited. Havard defeated the Democrat Ken Dawson, 6,626 (61.4 percent) to 4,170 (38.6 percent). Havard handily won his second term in the House in the primary election held on October 24, 2015. He polled 8,782 votes (63.4 percent) to the Democrat Ronnie Jett's 5,067 ballots (36.6 percent). A graduate of Jackson High School in Jackson, Louisiana, Havard attended ITI Technical College and Louisiana State University, both in Baton Rouge, to study industrial instrumentation and design. Prior to his election, he had worked for eighteen years as a manager of engineering sales and a business development executive in the petrochemical, oil, and natural gas industries. Havard vowed in his campaign announcement to work to \"create new jobs ... streamline government and rescind current regulation that create barriers for business. We must encourage, not stifle, small business development.\" Havard is a member of Rotary International, the Lions Club and the East Feliciana Parish Chamber of Commerce. He is a member of the trade association, the Louisiana Oil and Gas Association. He volunteers for the Easter Seals Foundation. He has been a volunteer youth baseball coach and an appointed member of the Zachary Taylor Parkway Commission. On May 18, 2016, Havard introduced an amendment to a bill requring that strippers be over twenty-one years of age. His amendment mandated that strippers also be no more than 28 years old and weigh no more than 160 pounds. He later withdrew the amendment but would not apologize when accused of sexist disrespect by his legislative colleague, Helena Moreno, a Democrat from New Orleans. She claimed that Havard's amendment would have applied equally to male strippers. Havard said that an apology would have meant obeisance to political correctness. An irate Governor John Bel Edwards called Havard's remark \"in bad taste, and it wasn't funny.\" The incident attracted national attention. Havard and his wife, the former Shondell Escher, a public schoolteacher in St. Francisville, have two sons. They are affiliated with the historic Grace Episcopal Church in St. Francisville."

  "text" : "Kenzo Tada (February 17, 1889 – after 1930) was a dirt track motorcycle racer who was born in Japan and became the first Asian to compete in the Isle of Man TT. He started his career in 1907 as a bicycle racer; his company Tomeye Trading Co. was the Velocette motorcycle importer in Tokyo. He started racing motorcycles in 1921, at which time there were only 20 racers in Japan, and he became a leading organizer of motorsport events in Japan. During the Taisho era, there had been a rapid growth of the motorcycling industry and racing in Japan. Races, sponsored by the national newspapers and intended to boost enthusiasm for Japan's rapidly developing industry, attracted crowds of up to 50,000. Inspired by the British motorcycle magazines he read, Tada learned about the demanding Isle of Man TT and in 1930 traveled for 40 days to Europe, by sea and rail, to complete in the 1930 Isle of Man TT event. He was the first Japanese overseas racer. Tada was invited to race by Veloce to prove the global popularity of their models, and he rode Alec Bennett's semi-works 350cc Velocette KTT bike, finishing 15th and gained the nickname 'the India Rubber Man' as he had a number of minor falls during the course of the race but remounted to carry on."

He was awarded the Golden Laurel of the Polish Academy of Literature in 1937 for his monographs about world-renowned authors such as Henryk Sienkiewicz, Marcel Proust, Thomas Mann, John Galsworthy and others. He translated into Polish The Picture of Dorian Gray by Oscar Wilde (1928). He wrote under several different pen names including Dionizy, Adam Korabski and Ludowiec, and specialized in the literature of Polish positivism and modernism. Soon before his death in 1948 he got entangled in the workings of pro-communist Polish Writers' Union created in 1944 behind the Soviet front line, and served as its president in 1946–1947. He died in Kraków a year later."

He was also a 10x USA National championships finalist in the event with a best time of 20.01 and highest world ranking of 6. He received a 1 year suspension after he tested positive for a PED at the New York Games on May 22, 1994. USA Track and Field exonerated Braunskill of any wrongdoing but the suspension came from IAAF and effected his Eorpean competitions. He went on to compete for another 10 years in the sport. Braunskill is probably best known for what he did those next 10 years. He took advantage of a bad situation and vowed to do right by it. His belief was that \"you wont be great until you do more without the spikes on your feet than you do with the spikes on your feet.\" Remarkably, Braunskill never lost his Home Depot or Champion Apparel sponsors. In fact, he used this platform to travel more than any other track and field athlete. He donated 100% of his appearance fees to whatever organization that had kids in the town and country he competed in. From giving teddy bears to the sick youth at a children's hospital in Tel Aviv, Isreal to providing South Africa's poverty stricken housing developments with anti fire paint to paint their homes. Braunskill has definitely become an ambassador around the world and can definitely say he has done more to influence without his spikes than with his spikes. He is a Bronze Star decorated retired Army Officer. Braunskill is married to Shantal Braunskill of Cape Town, South Africa and they have two children, Kevin jr and Chelsea."

  "text" : "Klondike (1 January 1878 - 3 February 1949) was an African American boxer billed as \"The Black Hercules\" who declared himself the black heavyweight champion (not to be confused with the World Colored Heavyweight Championship, which he officially fought for just once and unofficially another time). Born John Haines or John W. Haynes, the 6' tall Klondike fought out of Chicago as a heavyweight at a weight of 190 to 200 lbs. from 1898 to 1911. He took the nickname because he was supposed to be a great find (evoking the Klondike Gold Rush). He made his pro boxing debut against future two-time colored heavyweight champ Frank Childs on 8 January 1898 at Chicago's 2nd Regiment Armory (a fight erroneously credited to lightweight Frank Young Haines). He was K.O.-ed by Childs. Later that month, on the 29th, Childs won the world colored heavyweight title from Bob Armstrong and his first defense of the title was against Klondike on February 26. Childs won by a T.K.O. in the fourth round of the scheduled six-round bout when the referee stopped the fight. They fought again four times, as African American boxers were forced to fight one another often due to the color bar. Childs won every fight. Klondike fought many of the top black heavyweights of his generation, including Johnson, the first black man to win the world heavyweight championship. Ironically, Klondike would first declare himself the black heavyweight champion after beating Johnson in the future world heavyweight champ's third pro fight at Chicago's Howard Theater on 8 May 1899. It was only Klondike's eighth pro bout. According to the Chicago Tribune, \"...Johnson knocked Haines down in Round one with an uppercut, and only the bell saved Klondyke...\" Klondike and Johnson fought again twice, with one bout ending as a draw and the third with Johnson winning by a T.K.O."

  "text" : "Kaj Pindal (born 1927) a Danish-born Canadian animator and animation educator who worked at the National Film Board of Canada (NFB) beginning in 1957, and created such works as the Academy Award-nominated What on Earth! (1967, co-directed with Les Drew) and the 1988 NFB short Peep and the Big Wide World as well as the PBS series of the same name. He began his career as an underground cartoonist during the German occupation of Denmark and was forced to flee his home city of Copenhagen when his series of anti-Hitler cartoons put his life in peril. After the Second World War, he made animated commercials in Sweden and at Denmark’s Nordisk Film, and worked on UNESCO films and filmstrips. He emigrated to Canada in 1957 and joined the NFB the same year. His NFB credits also include The City: Osaka, created for Expo '70 in Osaka, and designed to give Japanese people a glimpse into Canadian life. This two-minute black-and-white film played during the world's fair on a screen composed of sixty thousand individual light bulbs. Pindal is the subject of a 1979 NFB documentary entitled Laugh Lines. In addition to his work at the NFB, Pindal returned to Denmark for a year in 1970 and spent several months in 1983 teaching in Denmark and Sweden. He has remained an influence in Canadian animation through his involvement with Sheridan College, where he has taught periodically since 1977."

  "text" : "Karin Nilsdotter (ca 1551-1613), was the royal mistress of Charles IX of Sweden, between 1568 and 1578. She was the mother of Carl Carlsson Gyllenhielm. Karin Nilsdotter was the daughter of Nicolaus Andrae (Nils Andersson), vicar of Östra Husby in Östergötland, and his spouse Karin. She is believed to have become the mistress of Charles in 1568. In 1573, she is confirmed as such, and she was by then officially the chamber lady of the noblewoman Sigrid Kyle, spouse of Johan Olofsson till Sjösa, governor of Nyköping Castle, at Sjösa Manor. After the birth of their son in 1574, she lived with her son at Julita Manor. The relationship was terminated before Charles' marriage in 1578, when she was awarded the Sundby Manor and married to Charles' courtier Gustav Andersson (d. 1584), with whom she had two daughters. She remarried the personal physician of queen dowager Catherine Stenbock, and in 1594 she married thirdly to the nobleman Peder Kristensson Siöblad of Flättna, governor of Nyköping Castle, with whom she had a daughter."

  "text" : "Konrad Oebbeke (2 November 1853, Hildesheim – 1 February 1932) was a German geologist and mineralogist. He studied at the Universities of Heidelberg and Erlangen, obtaining his doctorate at the University of Würzburg in 1877. Afterwards he worked as an assistant to the Geological Survey of Bavaria. He served as privat-docent at the University of Munich, later becoming a professor of mineralogy and geology at Erlangen (1887).From 1895 to 1927 he was a professor at the Technische Hochschule of Munich. Oebekke is known for his studies of minerals found in Bavaria, in particular those of economic value. In the Fichtelgebirge he drew attention to the presence of well-crystallized minerals (including topaz) on Epprechtstein. He produced several editions of Wolfgang Franz von Kobell's \"Tafeln zur Bestimmung der Mineralien\" (Tables for the determination of minerals), and with Ernst Weinschenk (1865-1921), he published editions 6 & 7 of Kobell's \"Lehrbuch Der Mineralogie\".
