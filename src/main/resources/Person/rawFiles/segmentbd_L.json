  "text" : "Luther B. Bridgers (1884-1948) was an American songwriter and minister. He was an eleventh lineal descendant of Lawrence Bridger (1550-1630), Rector of St. John the Evangelist Church in Slimbridge, Gloucestershire, UK. Luther Burgess Bridgers was born on February 14, 1884 in Margarettsville, North Carolina to Rev. James Buchanan Bridgers (1856-1913) and Georgiana nee Cooke. Luther's father conducted revival meetings until his death, often with his son assisting him, from 1904-1913. From 1902-06 Luther B. Bridgers attended Asbury College in Wilmore, Kentucky where he met his wife Sarah Jane \"Sallie\" Veatch (1885-1911) with whom he would have three sons. He was ordained in the Methodist Episcopal Church, South and pastored his first congregation in Perry, Florida from 1908-09 which he eventually relinquished in favor of itinerant evangelism throughout the southeastern United States. A gifted singer, Bridgers also penned a number of hymns, the most famous being \"He Keeps Me Singing\" which was first published Charles D. Tillman's The Revival hymnal #6 in March, 1910. The tune was derived from \"Melody of Love,\" a popular song of the day, written by Hans Engelmann in 1903. On March 26, 1911, while Bridgers' wife and children were visiting her parents in Harrodsburg, Kentucky, they were killed in a house fire. It has often been misreported that from this tragedy, Bridgers wrote the words and music for \"He Keeps Me Singing.\" Undoubtedly, the song took on a greater poignance after the incident, as Bridgers continued to grow in reputation as a powerful preacher in revival meetings throughout the South. In 1914 he was named General Evangelist by the Methodist Episcopal Church, South and married Aline Winburn with whom he sired Luther B. Bridgers, Jr (1915-1992). In the years immediately following World War I Bridgers took part in missionary outreaches to Belgium, Czechoslovakia, Poland, and Russia. In 1921 Asbury College awarded Bridgers an honorary Doctorate of Divinity for his greatly successful evangelistic work. The song \"He Keeps Me Singing\" has been recorded by the likes of Slim Whitman, Jake Hess, and Babbie Mason. From 1932-1944 Bridgers pastored several Methodist churches in the Atlanta, Georgia area, then briefly at a Methodist church in Morehead, North Carolina. In declining health, he relocated to Gainesville, Georgia where he died May 27, 1948."

On 30 October 2010, Panton was asked by News of the World news editor James Mellor to find out more from Metropolitan Police anti-terror head John Yates about the printer cartridge bomb found on a cargo plane at East Midlands Airport the previous day. Mellor wrote in an email to Panton: Panton replied: \"Noted. Not got hold of him yet still trying.\" Panton was on maternity leave at the time of the closure of the newspaper in July 2011. Panton was arrested at her home in Surrey, where she lives with her Scotland Yard-based Metropolitan Police detective husband. The couple have two young children. She was later released on police bail. During his evidence to the Leveson Inquiry in March 2012, former Metropolitan Police anti-terror head John Yates admitted that he drunk champagne with Panton and other executives from the tabloid newspaper. Yates denied that he gave Panton any favours in return for such hospitality, or that the relationship between the two was that close."

  "text" : "Latonia Moore (born 1979, in Houston, Texas) is an American soprano. Of African-American ancestry, she grew up with Black music, and at age 8 began to sing in the church choir of the New Sunrise Baptist Church, where her grandfather Cranford Moore was a pastor. In her youth, she sang in the Texas All-State Choir. Moore first studied gospel and jazz, until one of her teachers at the University of North Texas convinced her to study classical music. Moore made her debut in 1998 at the Palm Beach Opera in West Palm Beach, and was engaged as a student in the same year at the Houston Ebony Opera. She continued as a student of Bill Schuman at the Academy of Vocal Arts, in Philadelphia, where she graduated in 2005. In 2000 she won the Metropolitan Opera National Council Auditions. In New York City, Moore attracted critical praise for her 2008 performance with the Opera Orchestra of New York in Puccini's Edgar. In March 2012, she made her Metropolitan Opera debut as a late replacement for Violeta Urmana on short notice as Aïda in a live broadcast. Moore is featured on commercial recordings of the Mahler Symphony No 2 (Deutsche Grammophon 0289 474 5942 2) and of Verdi's Macbeth (sung in English, Chandos CHAN 3180(2)). In January 2016, Moore performed for the newly revived New York City Opera in Puccini's Tosca at the Rose Theater in Lincoln Center. In April 2016, she sang the lead role of Cio-Cio San in the San Diego Opera's performance of Puccini's Madama Butterfly, garnering critical recognition for her acting, her \"rich, supple and multi-octave soprano voice\" and vocal interpretation."

The last programme was broadcast on 14 November 1999, a few days before Anderson's death; this was the 1,786th programme in the series, which thereby became the longest-running show in Swedish radio history. Anderson had a characteristically hoarse voice, and in his radio programme he spoke a mixture of Swedish with a Scanian accent and English. He specialised in jazz music from the 1920s, 1930s and 1940s."

  "text" : "Leslie Frank Louis \"Les\" Diplock CMG (16 September 1899 – 6 November 1983) was an Australian politician. Diplock was born in South Brisbane to house-painter Louis Diplock and Louisa May, née Lucas and attended state and private schools in Rockhampton. He was a student teacher from 1914 and taught in Rockhampton, Toowoomba and Bribie Island from 1918 to 1924. He married Olive Constance Becker on 20 December 1920 at Taroom. He was head teacher at six successive schools before acting as district inspector of schools for the south-west region from June to December 1952. He was elected to the seat of Condamine in the Legislative Assembly of Queensland in 1953 as a Labor Party candidate. Diplock was appointed minister for public instruction in 1956, and his ministry was chiefly remembered for a controversial bill providing for a government appointee to head an appointments and promotions repeal board at the University of Queensland; the bill was repealed when the Coalition won government in 1957. During the Labor split of that year, Diplock sided with his leader Vince Gair in splitting away to form the Queensland Labor Party (QLP), and he retained Condamine in that year's election. He transferred to Aubigny in 1960, defeating the sitting Country Party member, but by 1963 Diplock was the QLP's sole parliamentary representative. The QLP formally aligned with the national Democratic Labor Party in 1962, although Diplock continued to describe himself as a QLP member until 1969. He continued to represent Aubigny until its abolition in 1972, when he retired following the seat's abolition. He was appointed Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George in 1972. Diplock, despite being a member of the Catholic-associated DLP, was a devoted Anglican and Freemason. He retired to Scarborough. He died in 1983 at Sandgate and was cremated."

  "text" : "Lou Lombardo (1932–2002) was an American filmmaker with credits on more than twenty-five feature films. Noted mainly for his work as a film and television editor, Lombardo also worked as a cameraman, director, and producer. In his obituary, Stephen Prince wrote, \"Lou Lombardo's seminal contribution to the history of editing is his work on The Wild Bunch (1969), directed by Sam Peckinpah. The complex montages of violence that Lombardo created for that film influenced generations of filmmakers and established the modern cinematic textbook for editing violent gun battles.\" Several critics have remarked on the \"strange, elastic quality\" of time in the film, and have discerned the film's influence in the work of directors John Woo, Quentin Tarantino, Kathryn Bigelow, and the Wachowskis, among others. While Lombardo's collaboration with Peckinpah lasted just a few years, his career was intertwined with that of director Robert Altman for more than thirty years. In the 1970s Lombardo edited McCabe & Mrs. Miller (1971) and several other of Altman's films. Towards the end of his career Lombardo edited Moonstruck (1987) and two other films directed by Norman Jewison. While his editing is now considered \"revolutionary\" and \"brilliant\", Lombardo was never nominated for editing awards during his career."

Between 1992 and 1996 he directed three shorts: Eternité moins cinq, Camilio and La femme à l'ombrelle.He has written screenplays for television and film since 2003. His first full-length feature film was Rêves de poussière (Dreams of Dust - 2007).The film was a France-Canada co-production between Athénaïse – Sophie Salbot and Corporation ACPAV inc. – Marc Daigle.The associate producer was Sékou Traoré of the Burkina Faso company Sahelis Productions. Rêves de poussière tells of Mocktar Dicko, a Nigerien peasant, who goes to look for work in a gold mine in northeastern Burkina Faso. He hopes to forget the past in this prison, where the bars are made of dust and wind.A reviewer says the \"opening shot reminds you of a choreographed musical—only there is no music, only silence and the sounds of workers’ tools\".Another critic says \"Cinematographed by Crystel Fournier, images are hauntingly dreamlike. Wind-swept dust is a recurrent motif\". Laurent Salgues is married to the actress Fatou Tall Salgues."

  "text" : "Ludwig von Baldass (German: Ludwig von Baldaß; 1887–1963) was an Austrian art historian, professor and acclaimed author who specialised in Early Netherlandish painting. He studied under Max Dvořák at the University of Vienna and began to lecture there in 1926, gaining the position of professor in 1934. Von Baldass' 1942 treatise on Hans Memling was instrumental in the re-evaluation of his artistic importance. Other publications include articles and books on Jan van Eyck (1952), Hieronymus Bosch (1953), Giorgione and Albrecht Altdorfer. Following the Anschluss with Nazi Germany, von Baldass adhered to the Nazis' policy on the arts. His approach seems to have been one of pragmatism, out of an interest in both preserving and expanding the state collection. When the Reich began a campaign of plundering works from Jewish collectors, members of the Rothschild family attempted to leave the country, taking their paintings with them. Von Baldass resisted and frustrated their efforts in a bid to prevent the works from leaving Austria. As a result, most passed into the hands of the Nazi state. After the war, Louis Rothschild attempted to reclaim parts of his collection, but von Baldass made use of his influence and bargained that some pieces should stay in the care of the state Kunsthistorisches Museum, in return for the passage of a number of others back to the Rothschild family. De Rothschild was eventually and reluctantly forced to concede to these terms. Von Baldass retired from lecturing in 1949 and devoted himself to writing; his most important works were published after 1952. He was married to Paula Wagner, a granddaughter of the architect Otto Wagner."

  "text" : "Liu Yanzuo (劉延祚) was a son of the late Chinese Tang Dynasty/early Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period warlord Liu Shouwen, the military governor (Jiedushi) of Yichang Circuit (義昌, headquartered in modern Cangzhou, Hebei), who tried to defend Yichang against the attacks of his uncle Liu Shouguang after his father was captured by his uncle in 909. Little is known about Liu Yanzuo personally. His grandfather Liu Rengong had taken over the nearby, larger Lulong Circuit (盧龍, headquartered in modern Beijing) in 895, and had sent Liu Shouwen to conquer Yichang in 898, leaving Liu Shouwen in command there. In 907, Liu Shouguang overthrew Liu Rengong and put him under house arrest, taking over Lulong. Hearing of this, Liu Shouwen launched an attack on Liu Shouguang, and the war between the brothers continued for several years. In 909, Liu Shouwen was captured in battle by Liu Shouguang's officer Yuan Xingqin. Liu Shouguang put him under house arrest and tried to advance to take over Yichang. Liu Shouwen's secretaries Lü Yan (呂兗) and Sun He (孫鶴) supported Liu Yanzuo as Liu Shouwen's successor and tried to put up a defense at Yichang's capital Cang Prefecture (滄州). Initially, the defense held even after Liu Shouguang had Liu Shouwen taken to the frontline to show that he had been captured. However, soon the food supplies ran out, and the army resorted to cannibalizing the weaker people in the community for food. In spring 910, Liu Yanzuo surrendered. Liu Shouguang sent his son (Liu Yanzuo's cousin) Liu Jiwei (劉繼威) to Yichang to take over for Liu Yanzuo, while having Liu Yanzuo and his staff members taken back to Lulong's capital You Prefecture (幽州). Curiously, historical accounts do not describe what Liu Yanzuo's fate was, even though it explicitly stated that Liu Shouguang killed Lü and his household while sparing Sun. (Liu Yanzuo's father Liu Shouwen would remain under house arrest for some time, and then was assassinated on secret orders from Liu Shouguang.)"

It was produced by Evolution Theatre in 2011. His ten-minute play Late was featured in New Theatre of Ottawa's Extremely Short Play Festival in May 2012. New Theatre of Ottawa also produced his ten-minute play The Book of Daniel for the 2013 Extremely Short Play Festival.

During the 9th century a fortified castle changed into a fortified early feudal town-settlement (now Uzhhorod), which became the centre of a new Slavonic principality, at the head of which was Laborec, who was a vassal of Great Moravia. When Tsar Simeon the Great began expanding his Bulgarian Empire, he gained control of a segment of \"White Croatia\", forcing Laborec to recognize his authority at the end of the 9th century. In 896 the Hungarian tribes crossed the Carpathian Range and migrated into Pannonian Basin. Prince Laborec fell from power under the efforts of the Hungarians and the Kievan forces; many of these forces remained behind and were assimilated by the White Croats. Laborec was defeated and killed on the banks of the Laborec river that still carries his name. According to a number of contemporary historians (for example Gyula Kristó, Ferenc Makk, etc.), Laborec was not a real person."

He was born in Darlington to Thomas Thackeray and Selina Neish. He was a founding member of the London Sketch Club. When he was over 30 he spent some winters in Egypt and produced humorous sketches which he collected in The Light Side of Egypt (1908). Thackeray drew the designs for over 950 postcard prints, mostly comic, and made a great number of illustrations for the humorous Press in England. At the beginning of World War I, despite being over 40, he volunteered for the Artists Rifles. He died in Brighton after a long illness."

He was born in County Meath, son of John Netterville of Dowth and Alison St Lawrence, daughter of Nicholas St Lawrence, 4th Baron Howth. His family had a long association with the law: the first recorded member of the family in Ireland was Nicholas de Netterville, who was appointed judge of the Court of Common Pleas (Ireland) in 1301. John's cousin and brother-in-law Thomas Netterville was a judge of the Court of King's Bench (Ireland), and after John's death his widow remarried another judge, Sir Patrick Whyte. In 1555 Netterville in his capacity as owner of Dowth was involved in litigation with another High Court judge, Walter Kerdiff. In 1558 he served on a commission to inquire into the lands held by Gerald FitzGerald, 11th Earl of Kildare. The following year he was appointed second justice of the Court of King's Bench. In 1560 he sat on a commission to inquire into martial law in Meath, but died the same year. Some years after his death the Lord Deputy of Ireland, Sir Henry Sidney, described Luke in disparaging terms: a man who was \"but second justice of one of the Benches...... of mean family.......born to nothing.\" \" This attack on Netterville, however was in the course of an attempt to destroy the career of Luke's son Richard, who was one of Sidney's bitterest enemies, and there is no reason to think that his low opinion of Luke was widely shared. Luke married Margaret Luttrell, daughter of Sir Thomas Luttrell, Chief Justice of the Irish Common Pleas, and had two sons: \n* John ( died 1601) father of Nicholas Netterville, 1st Viscount Netterville \n* Richard (died 1607) a leading politician and barrister."

  "text" : "Lise London (15 February 1916 – 31 March 2012) was a French Communist politician and activist. She participated in the International Brigades during the Spanish Civil War and the French Resistance during World War II. She was the widow of Artur London, a Czechoslovak communist politician and co-defendant in the Slánský Trial. Following her husband's show trial and imprisonment, she became a strong critic of Stalin and Stalinism. London was born Élizabeth Ricol in Montceau-les-Mines, France, in 1916 to parents from Spain. She became a member of the French Communist Party as a teenager. She moved to Moscow in the Soviet Union, where she first met and then married her husband, Artur London. The couple moved to Spain and joined the International Brigades at the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War in 1936. In a 2011 interview with El Pais, London described her involvement with the International Brigade as the \"best moment\" of her life, saying, \"The Spanish people are always in my memories. I am constantly reminded of the Brigades, of my old friends; I dream about them. Spain was an ideal, our most beloved ideal, and it continues to be a valid ideal.\" Lise and Artur moved to Paris in 1939 following the end of Spanish Civil War and the establishment of Francoist Spain. Nazi Germany soon invaded and occupied France in 1940. Both joined the French Resistance. In 1942, London was arrested and sent to Ravensbrück concentration camp, where she was held prisoner for the remainder of the war. Lise London moved to Czechoslovakia with her husband after World War II. Artur London joined the new Communist Czechoslovakian government as a deputy foreign minister. However, her husband fell out with authorities and Stalin, and was sentenced to life in prison during the Slánský trial in 1952. He was released in 1956 after Stalin's death and the couple returned to Paris. Artur London would later publish a play about his trial, The Confession, which was published in 1968. Artur London died in 1986. Lise London became a writer and author, especially focused on the experiences of her husband during the 1950s. Her books include \"Mégère de la rue Daguerre\", published in 1995. In a 2011 interview with El Pais, London revealed that she had \"tore up my membership card\" and left the French Communist Party, though she remained a supporter of communism. Lise London died on 31 March 2012 in Paris at the age of 96."

  "text" : "Louisa Charmaine Benson Craig (sometimes spelt Luisa Benson; 10 March 1941 – 2 February 2010) was a Burmese-born two-time beauty pageant winner and Karen rebel leader of Portuguese Jewish and Karen ancestry who was particularly known for becoming Burma's first Miss Universe contestant in 1956  and again Miss Burma in 1958. After American schooling she returned to Karen State and married Lin Htin, a commander of the Karen National Liberation Army(KNLA) in 1964. After her husband's death in 1965, widowed Louisa led the Fifth Brigade, but fell out with the Karen National Union leadership following a power struggle with Bo Mya. As a \"Most Wanted\" independence warrior leader, Louisa was urged by her people in 1967 to leave to spare her life; and she emigrated to the United States by marrying a Mayflower descendant of Massachusetts' historic Governor Bradford and an aunt who started Twinings American tea company, Glenn Campbell Craig, former classmate of her youthful overseas studies at Tufts University, who reconnected with her as a U.S. Naval officer requesting assignment to Asian waters near Karen State. After emigrating, Louisa Benson Craig obtained a master's degree in international affairs at Columbia University and worked to advocate for Burmese democracy and resettlement efforts for Burmese refugees in the United States. In 2004, she was named a plaintiff in a landmark human rights case against Unocal, which was operating in Burma, for profiting from the Burmese military's alleged human rights abuses by operating the Yadana gas field."

Another achievement she was responsible for was helping to create the \"Zero Garbage Discharge Program\".

This is seen as monumental because it was seen as the first of its kind and was exceeding all of the government regulations at the time."

He was a CFL All-Star and winner of the Dr. Beattie Martin Trophy for rookie of the year in the west (and was runner up to Johnny Rodgers for the CFL's Most Outstanding Rookie Award.) He was a CFL All-Star in each of his first 4 seasons, intercepting 21 passes, and played in the classic 64th Grey Cup when the Green Riders lost in the last minute.

He was a proconsul by Caesar's appointment in 48 BC, during the civil war. He occupied Thessaly, but was forced by Metellus Scipio to retreat, after which he joined Calvisius Sabinus in Aetolia. He was a tribune of the plebs in 44 BC, a year in which the people's tribunes were exceptionally numerous and his brother held the praetorship. Along with his fellow tribunes Tiberius Canutius and Decimus Carfulenus, L. Cassius was excluded from the important meeting of the Roman senate held November 28 to reassign several provinces for the following year. A bill enabling Caesar to add new families to the patriciate was probably sponsored by him rather than his brother as praetor."

Young's architectural training came at the Pratt Institute in New York and at the University of Pennsylvania under Paul Philippe Cret between 1922-1924. He returned to Utah in 1924 and went to work briefly for the church architect of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). In 1929 he established an architectural firm with Edward O. Anderson that lasted through 1936. Two of his early works are some of his most notable, namely the Kingsbury Hall in the University of Utah Circle and the Granite Stake Tabernacle, which are both listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places. Young later partnered with Arnold Ehlers. In the late 1930s and early 1940s, Young was on the church board of architects for the LDS Church, which oversaw the design of the Idaho Falls Idaho Temple. Young served as president of the Utah Chapter of the American Institute of Architects (AIA) during the 1930s."

He was a son of Zdzisław (captain of polish artillery, murdered in Katyń in March 1940) and Janina née Wałęga (polish and Ukrainian teacher). He was a lieutenant in Polish counterintelligence for a few years. Gondek's special research includes the legal justice system of the Polish Underground State during World War II, as well as the Polish postwar military missions, the political, economic and military consequences of war for occupied Germany, and the history of air sports and physical training aimed at developing defensive strategies by Poland's army during the communist years. Gondek's analysis of the underground Special Military Courts, Civil Courts and the Special Committees of the Polish Secret State is based on documents and legal papers published already during the occupation of Poland. Much attention is paid to legal and structural changes experienced by these organizations in the course of war, as in the case of National Armed Forces and the Tatra Confederation (Konfederacja Tatrzańska) behind the Soviet front. Gondek attempts to present the multitude of challenges facing the underground judiciary across the whole territory of the former Second Republic."

In 1912-13 he performed research of the fauna in Algeria and Tunisia, and following World War I, returned to Tunisia as a forester. In 1925 he took part in one of the first motorized crossings of the Sahara (from Tunis to Cotonou via Lake Chad). From 1928 he was stationed in Madagascar, where he collected zoological specimens that included a number of lemur species. Lavauden is credited with providing descriptions for several new mammal and avian species/subspecies. Many of his collections are housed at the Muséum d'histoire naturelle de Grenoble."

Cooney ran against incumbent William Cohen in Maine's 2nd Congressional District and received 19.7% of the vote in a loss. He was subsequently elected by the Maine Legislature to serve as Maine State Treasurer until 1978, when he was replaced by Jerrold Speers. Cooney earned a B.A. from Lake Forest College and represented Sabattus, Maine in the Maine House of Representatives from 1970-1976, where he eventually served as Chair of the State Government Committee. Cooney was rumored to be a frontrunner for the position of State Treasurer despite his lack of financial experience because of the common practice of the majority party in the legislature appointing its losing candidates to the constitutional positions, of which State Treasurer is one. He noted this during the campaign and said that he would not seek the position, but ultimately did so. Independent Governor Jim Longley told media that he would do his \"best\" to work with Cooney and sought to make the State Treasurer and other elected positions appointive by the governor. Following his stint as State Treasurer, Cooney continued in a number of Maine governmental positions, including as Director of the Bureau of General Services, Governor Joe Brennan’s Representative to the Loring Air Force Base Readjustment Committee and on Governor John Baldacci's Base Readjustment Liaison in the Department of Redevelopment, Re-Employment, and Business Support regarding the closure of the Brunswick Naval Air Station."

In 1879 he obtained his PhD from the University of Vienna, receiving his habilitation in zoology in 1898. From 1880 to 1922 he was associated with the Naturhistorisches Museum in Vienna. In 1899 he was the first scientist to provide analysis of Hadropithecus stenognathus (an extinct species of lemur), a study based on a mandible discovered by fossil collector Franz Sikora at Andrahomana cave in southeastern Madagascar. At the time, Lorenz believed the specimen to be the mandible of an anthropoid primate species. The North Island kaka (Nestor meridionalis septentrionalis), a nationally endangered bird from New Zealand, was named by Lorenz in 1896. The western avahi (Avahi occidentalis), a species he described in 1898, is sometimes referred to as \"Lorenz von Liburnau’s woolly lemur\"."

  "text" : "Lucius Quinctius (born c. 124 BC) was a politician of the late Roman Republic. A homo novus associated with the populares, he was tribune of the plebs in 74 BC and praetor in 67 BC. Quinctius is characterised by Cicero as a man well fitted to speak in public assemblies (Cic. Brut. 62). He distinguished himself by his violent opposition to the constitutional reforms of Lucius Cornelius Sulla, and endeavoured to regain for the tribunes the power of which they had been deprived. The unpopularity excited against the judges by the general belief that they had been bribed by Cluentius to condemn Oppianicus, was of service to Quinctius in attacking another of Sulla's measures, by which the judges were taken exclusively from the senatorial order. Quinctius warmly espoused the cause of Oppianicus, constantly asserted his innocence, and raised the flame of popular indignation to such a height, that Junius, who had presided at the trial, was obliged to retire from public life. Quinctius, however, was not strong enough to obtain the repeal of any of Sulla's laws. The consul Lucullus opposed him vigorously in public, and induced him, by persuasion in private, says Plutarch, to abandon his attempts. It is not improbable that the aristocracy made use of the powerful persuasion of money to keep him quiet. In 68 BC Quinctius was praetor, perhaps because of Crassus's support. He took his revenge upon his old enemy Lucullus, by inducing the senate to send him a successor in his province, although he had, according to a statement of Sallust, received money from Lucullus to prevent the appointment of a successor."

He first exhibited both as a painter and lithographer in 1824. His best known work, ' The Extreme Unction,' painted in 1824, was reported to be in the collection of M. Dussommerard in the mid-1860s. Amongst his other original works may be cited, 'The Obsequies of the Kings of the ancient Egyptians,' and 'Gaspar Netscher and his Daughter, which are in the gallery at Dresden. His lithographs after eminent painters, old and modern, are too numerous to mention. He obtained a second-class medal in 1840."

Born in Nafplion, he later studied in Athens and Munich on a scholarship provided by Simon Sinas. Drosis's major work is the extensive neo-classical architectural ornament at the Academy of Athens, for the Danish-Austrian architect Theophil Hansen. The Academy was also funded largely by Sinas. Drosis sculpted the principle multi-figure pediment sculpture, on the theme of the birth of Athena, based on a design by painter Carl Rahl. This brought first prize at the Vienna Exhibition of 1873. Drosis is also responsible for the figures of Athena and Apollo with lyre on the Academy's flanking pillars, and the seated marble figures of Plato and Socrates, which were executed \"by the Italian sculptor Piccarelli\". (The eight smaller pediments in the Academy complex are the terra-cotta work of Austrian sculptor Franz Melnitzky.) Drosis died in Naples."

  "text" : "Lucy Katherine Partington (4 March 1952 – some time between 28 December 1973 and 2 January 1974; aged 21) was a British murder victim. She was born in St Albans, the third child of Roger and Margaret (Bardwell) Partington. On the night of 27 December 1973, during her final year of reading English Literature at Exeter University, she was abducted by serial killers Fred and Rosemary West. Her precise date of death can never be known. However, at twenty-five past midnight on 3 January 1974 Fred West admitted himself into the casualty unit at Gloucester Royal hospital with a serious laceration of his right-hand that required several stitches, leading to speculation that she could have been kept alive and tortured for several days in the cellar of the Wests' home in Cromwell Street before finally being murdered. Whatever the truth, her remains were discovered there on 6 March 1994 alongside the knife Fred West used to dismember them. On 16 February 1995, Lucy's remains were reburied in Exeter, Devon. Lucy’s sister, Marian Partington, wrote about the impact of Lucy’s life, disappearance, and death in her memoir, If You Sit Very Still, in May 2012. The book builds on Salvaging the Sacred, an essay written by Marian and published in The Guardian Weekend in May 1996. The essay inspired a play by Bryony Lavery and a feature film by Juliet McKoen, both entitled Frozen. Lucy was the cousin of novelist Martin Amis. He dedicated his novel The Information to her and writes about her life and death in his memoir Experience."

  "text" : "Lewis Warren Shurtliff (July 24, 1835 – May 2, 1922) was a Utah politician and a missionary and leader in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). Shurtliff was born in Sullivan, Ohio. As an infant, his parents joined the Church of the Latter Day Saints; the family followed Joseph Smith to Kirtland, Ohio; Far West, Missouri; and Nauvoo, Illinois. In 1851, the Shurtliff family travelled to Utah Territory as Mormon pioneers and settled in Weber County. In 1855 to 1858, Shurliff was a Mormon missionary to the Native Americans in present-day Salmon River, Idaho. In 1867, he went on a mission to England, Scotland, Wales, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Germany, France, and Italy. Shurliff returned to Utah Territory and became the LDS Church Bishop in Plain City. In 1883, he became the president of the church's Weber Stake, which was based on Ogden. Also in 1883, Shurliff was invited to join the church's Council of Fifty. In 1886 and 1888, Shurliff was elected to the Utah Territorial Council. After Utah gained statehood in 1896, Shurliff was a State Senator from 1896 to 1899. He was initially elected as a Democrat but later became a Republican. Shurliff also served as a Weber County Commissioner and as a Weber County probate judge. In 1896, the Utah settlement of Salt Creek was renamed Warren to honor Shurtliff. Shurliff died in Ogden, Utah. One of Shurtliff's daughters, Louie Emily Shurtliff, married Joseph Fielding Smith, who after her death went on to become an apostle and later the President of the LDS Church."

Born in El Kantara, Bouhali hailed from an Arab peasant family. In 1934 he travelled to Moscow, where he received political training for 9 months. Bouhali took part in the founding congress of the Algerian Communist Party in 1936. In 1939 he was named secretary of the Algerian People's Aid (Secours populaire algerien), an organization dedicated to assisting victims of colonial repression. In 1940 Bouhali, along with other Communist Party leaders, was imprisoned and deported to the Sahara. He was detained at the Djenien-Bou-Rezg concentration camp. At the third party congress, held in 1947, Bouhali was elected general secretary of the party, substituting Amar Ouzegane. Bouhali was exiled throughout the Algerian War of Independence. When the insurrection broke out, he moved to metropolitan France, and after the banning of the Algerian Communist Party on September 13, 1955 he moved to East Germany. At the time of Algerian independence in 1962 he remained in East Germany. Bouhali returned to Algeria, but went into exile again (along with other communist leaders) a few months after the 1965 coup d'état. He later became a member of the central leadership of the Socialist Vanguard Party (PAGS). Bouhali represented the Algerian communists at different international events, such as the 10th anniversary of the People's Republic of China in Peking 1959 and the 1969 International Meeting of Communist and Workers Parties in Moscow."

  "text" : "Louis Claude Noisette (2 November 1772 at Chatillon – 9 January 1849) was a French botanist and agronomist, son of Joseph Noisette, gardener to the Count of Provence, the future Louis XVIII. In 1795, after a short stint in the infantry, he became a gardener at Val-de-Grace but his position is eliminated around 1798. For several years, he accumulated funds to found, in 1806, along with his brothers, a botanical facility to collect all the great plants of the time. He had a rich collection of roses. For him, Claude Antoine Thory (1759–1827) named Rosa x noisettiana or the Noisette Rose, the hybrid obtained by Noisette from seeds sent by his brother. Philippe Noisette, who had received a government mission in America, and had settled in South Carolina. Phillipe Noisette gave the planter John Champneys a plant of Rosa x 'Old Blush' sent by Louis Claude from France. This one was fertilized by Rosa moschata (the Musk Rose) which resulted in Rosa x 'Champneys's Pink Cluster'. It was from sowing of seeds of 'Champney's Pink Cluster' sent by Phillipe, that Louis Noisette obtained Rosa x 'Blush Noisette', the first Noisette rose. Louis Claude Noisette became famous all over Europe. In Austria, Prince Nicolas II Esterházy called on him to plant his vast estate. Noisette was responsible for the introduction and the distribution in France of a large number of rare American and Indian plants. For these reasons, he was named a Chevalier of the Legion of Honor on May 8, 1840. Noisettia is a genus of small flowering plants, native to tropical America in the family Violaceae, named for him. He died in 1849 without children. His two brothers, also gardeners, and who left descendants were Philippe (born in 1773 in Paris and died in 1835 in Charleston, South Carolina) and Antoine (born in Torcy in 1778 and died in Nantes in 1858). The latter directed the botanical garden in Nantes. The descendants of Phillipe Noisette operated a nursery in the Charleston, South Carolina area into the 1940s. In the Garden of the King at the Palace of Versailles, one of the gardens is named in honor of \"Louis Noisette - great gardener\"."

He began competing abroad for the first time in 2008 in his early twenties. His first win came at the Setúbal Half Marathon in Portugal, and another followed at the 2009 Pombal Meia Maratona. Working with athletics manager Jos Hermens, he gained a place at the 2011 Amsterdam Marathon and made the third-fastest marathon debut in history with his run of 2:06:05 hours, which was enough for second place behind Wilson Chebet. In his first race of 2012 he came fifth at the Roma-Ostia Half Marathon, but improved his best over the distance to a time of 1:00:38 hours. He was invited to the 2012 Boston Marathon and managed sixth place, although difficult running conditions left him with a slower time of 2:15:29 hours. A run at the 2012 Chicago Marathon saw him in contention up to the half way point, but he faded into eleventh place by the finish. Korir then won the 2014 Toronto Waterfront Marathon with a time of 2:08:15."

While borough president, Louis Haffen worked with Michael J. Garvin. Garvin is credited with the design of the Haffen Building and the Bronx Borough Courthouse (built between 1905 and 1915), but a scandal arose when it was discovered that Garvin was not the architect. Oscar Florianus Bluemner was the real architect, and the allegations of plagiarism and fraud in relation to who designed the courthouse forced Louis Haffen's resignation from office amid accusations of cronyism, fraud and corruption. As Borough President he selected contractors in 1897 to pave Jerome Avenue. Three sections of the road were to be remodeled, costing the Bronx about $136,505. He died on Christmas Day, 1935 and is interred at Woodlawn Cemetery in the Bronx."

  "text" : "Loonis McGlohon (September 29, 1921 – January 26, 2002) was an American songwriter and jazz pianist. McGlohon was born in Ayden, North Carolina, and graduated from East Carolina University. After a spell in the Air Force during World War II, he played with the Jimmy Dorsey and Jack Teagarden orchestras and became involved with broadcasting in Charlotte, North Carolina, working as music director for WBT (AM) radio and WBTV (Charlotte's CBS-TV affiliate). McGlohon was an accompanist to many well-known singers including Judy Garland, Mabel Mercer and Eileen Farrell. He was co-host of the Peabody Award-winning NPR radio series American Popular Song with his friend and collaborator, Alec Wilder. Among the songs that McGlohon wrote with Wilder are \"Blackberry Winter\", \"Be a Child\" and \"While We're Young\". McGlohon, like Wilder, could write both music and lyrics, and for the song \"Songbird\" he wrote both. With Wilder, he also wrote music and lyrics for the former North Carolina outdoor attraction Land of Oz. For his hometown of Charlotte, North Carolina McGlohon wrote the music for LeGette Blythe's outdoor drama, \"The Hornet's Nest,\" staged in June and July, 1968 at a new amphitheater at the University of North Carolina - Charlotte. The two principal songs were, \"This is the Day!\" and \"What Will the World be Like!\" McGlohon allowed the College of William and Mary Choir to include \"This is the day!\" in its repertoire for many years. In 1980, Frank Sinatra recorded two of his songs with Alec Wilder - \"South to a Warmer Place\" and \"A Long Night\" - on the album She Shot Me Down. In 1985, he was commissioned (with his friend Charles Kuralt) to write a piece in celebration of North Carolina's 400th birthday. The result was North Carolina Is My Home, a symphonic work with narration and vocals which became a recording, public TV broadcast, live presentation and coffee table book. McGlohon was inducted into the North Carolina Music Hall of Fame in 1999. At the age of 80, he died following a long-term battle with lymphoma. NationsBank Performance Place in Charlotte's Spirit Square was named Loonis McGlohon Theatre in a January 9, 1998 event. In 2004, the biography Loonis! Celebrating a Lyrical Life (written by Jerry Shinn) was published by the East Carolina University Foundation."

He is a leading authority on corporate strategy, financial markets, and risk. In collaboration with Nobel Laureate Edmund Phelps, he co-authored a 2010 Harvard Business Review article that called for the creation of the First National Bank of Innovation  as a way to enhance U.S. economic dynamism. In a 2012 European Financial Review article, he redefined risk intelligence and designated it “new essential competence” for financial institutions and investors who aspire to create lasting value and contribute to economies and societies. He is the creator of the Corporate Risk Scorecard, a holistic view of a company’s business model and risk profile similar to a food Nutrition Label (Barrons) and co-author of the pioneering “Brain as a Business Model” framework (European Financial Review, 2014). Tilman was profiled as a \"Business Visionary\" by Forbes among “influential authors, decision makers, and thought leaders in the field of business” and named Young Global Leader of the World Economic Forum for “professional accomplishments, commitment to society and potential to contribute to shaping the future of the world.”"

He is best known for creating the first professional atlas visualizing Livonia (area now divided between Estonia and Latvia), the Atlas von Liefland, oder von den beyden Gouvernementern u. Herzogthümern Lief- und Ehstland, und der Provinz Oesel in 1798. He was born in Tuhala, Estonia. He visited Riga in 1782. Mellin, a soldier in the Imperial Russian Army, became a cartographer at the request of Paul I of Russia, who wanted to see a map of Livonia. Since a professional map did not exist, Mellin was put in charge of creating it. In 1798, the Atlas von Liefland, oder von den beyden Gouvernementern u. Herzogthümern Lief- und Ehstland, und der Provinz Oesel, was published by Mellin. It took 28 years to complete it. Mellin used maps from private collections, the military, and the Russian Academy of Sciences. The map shows natural features such as islands, geology and shorelines of the region. The maps were so popular they were sold overseas. At one point, Mellin was accused of espionage because of where the maps were being sold. He was arrested. Paul I had the maps pulled off the market."

  "text" : "Bates was such a hit in New York that Four Wheel Drive decided to utilize her skills even further. In 1920, they sent her on three transcontinental tours throughout the United States. The advertising scheme introduced the idea that the FWD truck was easy to steer, as evidenced by a woman driver. During her first tour, she represented Francis Hugo's Safety First Campaign. She toured approximately 25 towns, beginning in Kansas City, Missouri, and finishing in Belefontaine, Ohio. While in Erie, Pennsylvania, she flew over the city in an \"earoplane\" and saturated Erie with information about the Four Wheel Drive and its vehicles. In May 1920, Popular Science magazine referred to her as \"exhibit A for feminine efficiency.\" She returned to Clintonville, Wisconsin, in late July 1920. She began her next tour within the month, traveling to state fairs throughout the eastern United States. In September, she drove her truck loaded with coal through the streets of Utica, New York. Both an expert driver and a mechanic, Bates was more than capable of completing all maintenance on her truck.During her final tour of 1920, Bates took the southern states by storm. She was now known as \"our girl driver.\" In Oklahoma, she defied the police and took her truck across a flooded road, hauling meat for a packaging plant. This courageous venture led to the sale of ten trucks for Four Wheel Drive and much admiration for Bates. For the next two years, Bates traveled as a demonstrator, both locally and throughout the United States, demonstrating the Model B truck and the newly developed fire trucks. In early December 1922, Bates moved to Milwaukee, later marrying Howard Coates and having two sons. Her descendents include one granddaughter and three great-grandchildren, one of whom is actress Ashley Hinshaw. Luella Bates has been included in several books about the Four Wheel Drive company, the history of trucking and the history of Clintonville, Wisconsin. During the infancy of the trucking industry, she played an important role in the history of women in trucking."

  "text" : "Line Luplau (1823-1891) was a Danish feminist and suffragist. She was the co-founder of the Danske Kvindeforeningers Valgretsforbund or DKV (The United Danish Suffrage Movements For Women) and first chairperson in 1889-1891. Line Luplau was the daughter of the vicar Hans Christian Monrad (1780-1825) and Ferdinandine Henriette Gieertsen (1783-1871) and married the vicar Daniel Carl Erhard Luplau (1818-1909), in 1847. Luplau developed an early frustration over the fact that women was not recognized full rights as humans because of their sex. This interest is regarded to have developed from the public debate following the controversial novel Clara Raphael by Mathilde Fibiger (1851). Her spouse served as a vicar in a parish in Slesvig-Holsten, and the family was forced to leave for Varde when this part of Denmark was lost after the war in 1864. In Varde, Luplau founded a charity organisation, and became the first woman in Denmark to speak at a national celebration. In 1872, Luplau became a member of the local branch of the women's organisation Dansk Kvindesamfund (DK) alongside her spouse and her daughter Marie Luplau. Her interest in women's rights focused on woman suffrage and equal political rights, and she belonged to the opposition group within the DK. In 1888, she delivered a list of 1702 names in support to Fredrik Bajer's motion in the parliament of women suffrage as the representative of the DK. In 1885, she belonged to the supporters of the newly founded women's organisation Kvindelig Fremskridtsforening (KF), a fraction of former DK- members, and served in the KF central comity in 1886. In 1886, she moved to Copenhagen after her husband's retirement, and in 1888, she represented KF at the first Nordic women's conference in Copenhagen, where she and Johanne Meyer presented women suffrage as one of the four main issues within women's rights. Line Luplau became one of the leading figures of the Danish women suffrage movement, and served in the board of the KF-paper Hvad vi vil alongside Matilde Bajer, Anna Nielsen and Massi Bruhn. In 1889, Line Luplau founded the Danish suffrage movement Kvindevalgretsforeningen (KVF) together with Louise Nørlund, and served as its chairperson in 1889-91. Her goal was to form an organisation exclusively for women suffrage rather than the DK and KF, which handled many different women's issues, and she gathered support from both males and various different political groups, especially the left wing political groups. Line Luplau was a controversial, strict and energetic activist with a direct approach, whose activism aroused strong emotions, and she was not popular among other women's groups, who considered her to have split the women's movement. In 1891, she was forced to resign as chairperson of the KVF for health reasons. In 1917, her daughter Marie Luplau created a group portrait painting for the Danish parliament depicting the notable members of the women suffrage movement, where Luplau was placed in the front."

  "text" : "Leroy Kirkland, (February 10, 1906 – April 6, 1988) was an arranger, bandleader, guitarist and songwriter whose career spanned the eras of big band jazz, R&B, rock and roll and soul. Kirkland played guitar in southern jazz bands in the 1920s, and during the 1930s he worked as arranger and songwriter for Erskine Hawkins. He joined Tommy and Jimmy Dorsey in the 1940s and later in that decade began arranging music at Savoy Records in New York. He continued to arrange R&B artists for OKeh Records, Mercury Records and other companies. Some of Kirkland's more successful collaborations were with Screamin' Jay Hawkins (\"I Put a Spell on You, \"Little Demon\",\"Yellow Coat\", etc.) and Big Maybelle (Kirkland co-wrote her biggest hit, \"Gabbin' Blues\"). In 1956, Kirkland and his session band teamed up with 14-year-old singer Barbie Gaye to record an R&B song, \"My Boy Lollypop\". Kirkland's arrangement of the song resulted in a sound that was new and original. Years later, the style would become known as ska and would influence other genres such as blue beat, rocksteady, and, most popularly, reggae. When the song was covered eight years later by Jamaican artist Millie Small, the cover version with little change went on to become one of the biggest selling records worldwide. Later at Savoy Records, Kirkland worked with Nappy Brown and Wilbert Harrison. Although behind the scenes for most of his career, Kirkland contributed to the recordings of music legends such as Etta James, Charlie Parker, Ella Fitzgerald, The Righteous Brothers, The Supremes, Brook Benton and the Five Satins."

  "text" : "Lucy Hutchinson (born 18 July 2003) is an English child actress from Sanderstead, Croydon. Her first acting experience came in the 2008 film Dustbin Baby, based on Jacqueline Wilson's 2001 novel of the same name. In Dustbin Baby, she played the younger version of the lead character April, seen in flashbacks. Hutchinson was five at the time of filming, and was described by director Juliet May as \"one of the most remarkable five year olds I have ever met\", saying that \"it's like she's not acting at all\". Prior to her appearance in Dustbin Baby, Hutchinson had attended a local drama group for children, and was signed up with an agency. Her father said that she got the role because \"she was the right face in the right place ... She was incredibly lucky but that doesn't deter from how well she did in getting it.\" After the release of Dustbin Baby, Hutchinson played roles in British television programmes EastEnders, Doc Martin and Psychoville. Her film debut came when she filmed scenes for the American film Prometheus, in which she played a younger version of the main character, Elizabeth Shaw. Director Ridley Scott considers the scenes critical for providing insight into Elizabeth's motivations. Hutchinson said \"It was really good and I think the experience was great for me as well. It was filming at Pinewood, it is such a big place and that showed me what other sets were being built there which was good. I have never really been to a big set before, I just thought 'wow'. I know it was a big scene, Ridley Scott told me it was a really big scene. I was quite confident and just thought 'yeah I am going to do this'.\" Hutchinson subsequently made appearances on radio, stage and television, including roles in Little Crackers, The Politician's Husband, Not Going Out and Inside No. 9. She has main roles Dani's Castle and the BBC comedy The Kennedys. Hutchinson lives and attends school in Croydon. She lives with her parents, Gary and Anna, and older brother."

  "text" : "Lynn Poole (August 11, 1910 – April 14, 1969) was the creator and host of an early U.S. science television program, The Johns Hopkins Science Review (1948–1955), and the author of more than 20 popular science books. In 2002, Patrick Lucanio and Gary Coville wrote that \"In retrospect, Lynn Poole created one of those unique series that allowed television to fulfill its idealized mission as both an educational and an entertainment medium.\" The \"pioneering program\" made Poole a \"surprise star\". Marcel LaFollette argues that contemporary science television such as NOVA and the Discovery Channel are derived from the innovations of Poole and others. Poole was born in Eagle Grove, Iowa. He received his bachelor's degree from Western Reserve University in 1936, and a master's degree in 1937. In 1938 he joined the staff of the Walters Art Museum in Baltimore, where he directed the education department. In 1941 he married Gray Johnson, then working as a journalist at The Evening Sun. Following service during World War II as a public relations officer for the VII Bomber Command, in 1946 he joined Johns Hopkins University as its first director of public relations."

  "text" : "Louis Hippolyte Joseph de Mauris, Vicomte de Malartic (1769—1832) was a French aristocrat and military officer who served in the French Army as well as in the United States Army in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. He was born on 1 March 1769, he attended the French Military School at the age of 14. He graduated in 1784 and was commissioned a sub-lieutenant. He joined the French Guards as an ensign, and in 1789 transferred to the artillery company in that unit. As the French Revolution unfolded, he left France in 1790 following the disbanding of the French Guards for the United States. Once there he moved to Gallipolis, a frontier settlement in Ohio. He participated in two military campaigns against the Indian tribes of the Northwest Frontier during his time on the frontier. In 1791, Malartic served as the aide-de-camp for Major General Arthur St. Clair in his operation against the Indians of the Northwest Frontier that culminated in the disastrous battle at the Wabash river known as St. Clair's Defeat and the destruction of the U.S. Army. Malartic himself was wounded at the battle. After his recovery, he returned to France to join the military forces attempting to restore the monarchy. He remained in military service to the pretender in exile during the Revolution, serving as well in Prussian and Austrian service, eventually rising to become Field Marshal in 1799 under Louis XVIII. He returned to France in 1814, and remained in military service until 1830, when, unwilling to support Louis Philippe I after the July Revolution, he resigned."

She used a 'skull and crossbones' logo, and was skilled at riding motorcycles and driving four wheel vehicles, and was the first person to ride a wall in a scaled down midget racing car. She was one of the first and most popular female wall of death riders of the 1920s and '30s. At the time, walls of death were often called silo-motordromes. She later became the operator of a long range shooting gallery."

In 1817 he obtained his medical doctorate, later becoming a surgeon to the \"Bureau central\" (1823). During the following year he was appointed \"second surgeon\" at the Hôtel-Dieu de Paris, and in 1830 received his agrégation (professeur agrégé). For a period of time he served as head of the ophthalmologic clinic at the Hôtel-Dieu. In 1836 he succeeded his former teacher and good friend, Guillaume Dupuytren (1777-1835) as professor of clinical surgery. His name is associated with Purkinje-Sanson images, being defined as catoptric images produced by reflections from the anterior and posterior surfaces of the cornea, and from the anterior and posterior surfaces of the crystalline lens. Term named in conjunction with Czech physiologist Jan Evangelista Purkyne (1787-1869)."

  "text" : "Lambert Orkis (born 1946, Philadelphia) is an American United States-based internationally accomplished classical pianist. His career has been based on many differing roles: ranging from being the pianist of choice for Anne-Sophie Mutter for works of piano and violin chamber music since 1988 (mainly containing sonatas for violin and piano by Beethoven, Mozart, Brahms, and Schubert). For their interpretation of the Beethoven and Mozart violin sonatas, the duo was honored by a German Grammy rsp. and by a French \"choc de l’année\". For eleven years, Orkis had also collaborated with the famous cellist (and conductor) Mstislav Rostropovich on chamber music recitals. From this collaboration, Rostropovich created a permanent position for Orkis, appointing him as first piano instrumentalist member of the National Symphony Orchestra during his tenure as a chief conductor in Washington, D.C. A third specialty of Lambert Orkis are his performances on period instruments but is also a specialist in contemporary music, having collaborated with the cellists Lynn Harrell, Anner Bylsma and Daniel Müller-Schott, as well as with the violinists Julian Rachlin and Jaap Schroeder. Contemporary composers such as George Crumb, Richard Wernick and James Primrosch have written piano compositions especially for him. Lambert Orkis is Professor of piano of the Boyer College of Music and Dance at Temple University in Philadelphia."

After receiving an Ed.D. degree from Louisiana State University, Kendrick joined the faculty of East Carolina University in Greenville, North Carolina. Prior to becoming a general authority, Kendrick served in the LDS Church a stake president and regional representative. From 1985 to 1988 he was the president of the Florida Tampa Mission. In 1988, be became a member of the First Quorum of the Seventy. One year later, when the Second Quorum of the Seventy was created, Kendrick was transferred to that quorum. In 1991, he was transferred back to the First Quorum, where he served until 2001, when he received general authority emeritus status. In 1992 and 1993, Kendrick was the second counselor to Jack H Goaslind in the general presidency of the Young Men organization. Kendrick was the president of the Dallas Texas Temple from 1993 to 1995. Kendrick and his wife are the parents of three sons and one daughter."

As a stamp dealer, Barrington Smith dealt principally in used British Commonwealth stamps, but the home-made and naive patriotic covers that he sold in bulk during the war years have become collectable in their own right. Barrington Smith traded from 1935 until about 1962, initially as a printer, soon becoming a stamp dealer and later a stamp wholesaler and supplier of \"tropical novelties\". He is not believed to have been connected with the Leicester, England, firm of philatelic accessary wholesalers Barrington Smith. He traded under his own name and also as the Buccaneer Hobby Club from 127 Hagley Park Road, Half Way Tree Post Office, Jamaica and was the publisher of The West Indian Philatelist."

  "text" : "Lester Dubins (April 27, 1920 – February 11, 2010) was an American mathematician noted primarily for his research in probability theory. He was a faculty member at the University of California at Berkeley from 1962 through 2004, and in retirement was Professor Emeritus of Mathematics and Statistics. It has been thought that, since classic red-and-black casino roulette is a game in which the house on average wins more than the gambler, that \"bold play\", i.e. betting one's whole purse on a single trial, is a uniquely optimal strategy. While a graduate student at the University of Chicago, Dubins surprised his teacher Leonard Jimmie Savage with a mathematical demonstration that this is not true. Dubins and Savage wrote a book that appeared in 1965 titled How to Gamble if You Must (Inequalities for Stochastic Processes) which presented a mathematical theory of gambling processes and optimal behavior in gambling situations, pointing out their relevance to traditional approaches to probability. Under the influence of the work of Bruno de Finetti, Dubins and Savage worked in the context of finitely additive rather than countably additive probability theory, thereby bypassing some technical difficulties. Dubins was the author of nearly a hundred scholarly publications. Besides probability, some of these were on curves of minimal length under constraints on curvature and initial and final tangents (see Dubins path), Tarski's circle squaring problem, convex analysis, and geometry. His doctorals students include Theodore Hill."

His military actions were mostly focused against Visigoths that had gradually been attempting to spread their control over Gaul. In 436 their king Theodoric I tried to conquer Narbo Martius to obtain access to the Mediterranean Sea and the roads to the Pyrenees. Litorius, with the aid of the Huns, could prevent the capture of the city and drove the Visigoths back to their capital Tolosa. But in the consequent battle at Tolosa in 439 the allied forces of Romans and Huns were defeated by Visigoths and Litorius soon died in the imprisonment from the injuries which he had received in this battle."

The people of India do not want God. He was awarded with Padma Shri in year 1955 for his contributions in field of Literature & Education. He was also given title of Ithihasratna for his works and writings on history of Odisha. He was a member of Asiatic Society, President of Odisha Sahitya Academy and also a member of Servants of India Society. A school in Cuttack has been named after his as Lakshmi Narayan Sahu Mahavidyalaya."
