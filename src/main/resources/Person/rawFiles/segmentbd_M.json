He built a mansion house retaining the old castle walls, to a design, it is said, of Robert Smythson or John Smythson. The three storey house has five bays each with stone mullioned and transomed windows. There is a castellated parapet and an entrance porch. In 1621, Cradock was elected Member of Parliament for Stafford. He was re-elected MP for Stafford in 1624 and 1625. He was elected MP for Stafford again in 1628 and sat until 1629 when King Charles dispensed with parliament for eleven years. Cradock died in 1636 and was buried in the church of St Peter at Caverswall. Cradock married Elizabeth Fowler daughter of Richard Fowler of Harnedge Grange, Shropshire on 28 April 1612. They had a daughter Mary and a son George, who entered the Inner Temple in 1632, and died in 1643. Cradock was said to be cousin of Matthew Cradock, a financial supporter of the Puritan migration."

In 1914, he supported the pro-Greek party, that established the Autonomous Republic of Northern Epirus and struggled against annexation of the region to the newly established Albanian Principality. With the incorporation of Northern Epirus to Albania he managed to gain influence in Albanian politics. In 1923 he became a member of the Albanian Parliament for the Gjirokaster District. He supported Ahmet Zogu, who was elected as the first President of Albania in 1925. That year and for a short period, Kasso became chairman of the Albanian Parliament. Soon later he was positioned ambassador of Albania in Athens, Greece. Kasso, together with other representatives of the Greek minority in the Albanian Parliament, supported the educational rights of the Greeks in Albania."

After the head chief Dohäsan died in 1866, naming Guipago as his own designated heir and consequently establishing Satanta as the second-ranking chief, Mamanti assumed the role of a war chief, but he got real power when he gained screech owl medicine and became an owl prophet.His rivalry as a medicine man was versus Napawat (No Mocassins), a powerful and influent one friendly to Tene-angopte. Mamanti had two wives. He had several children with both of his wives, and also an adopted a captive named Tehan."

  "text" : "(Marguerite) Martha Allan (1895 – April 4, 1942) was the founder of the Montreal Repertory Theatre and co-founder of the Dominion Drama Festival. She loathed amateur theatre, but her energies spearheaded the Canadian Little Theatre Movement at a time when live theatre in Montreal and across Canada was being threatened by the rapid expansion of the American-influenced movie theater. She almost single-handedly laid the groundwork for the development of the professional modern Canadian theatre scene. In 1935, she received the Canadian Drama Award for outstanding service in the development of the Canadian theatre. At the annual Dominion Drama Festival the Martha Allan Trophy is awarded in her memory for the best visual performance. She also wrote three plays: What Fools We Mortals Be; Summer Solstice; and All Of A Summer's Day, that won the Sir Barry Jackson Trophy for the best Canadian play at the Dominion Drama Festival in the early 1930s."

He is best known as founder and owner of Las Vegas Sports Consultants (1982–1999), the international odds making company licensed by the Nevada Gaming Control Board. Roxborough is credited with introducing mathematical formulas and computer models to the multi-billion dollar sports wagering industry. The Las Vegas Review-Journal listed Roxborough number two in its list of the most influential people in sports of the 20th century. Roxborough was a co-founder of American Wagering Inc, the first U.S. bookmaking company to be listed on a public stock exchange in 1996 (Nasdaq: BETM). He served as a director from the company's inception until March 11, 1998. The company was subsequently purchased by UK Bookmakers William Hill PLC. With partner Benjamin Lee Eckstein in 1986, Roxborough co-founded “America’s Line,” a daily newspaper sports odds column syndicated by Universal Press in 1988 appearing in more than 120 North American newspapers. Roxborough and Mike Rhoden co-authored “Sports Book Management: A Guide to the Legal Bookmaker”, originally published in 1988 and updated in 1991 and 1998 (OCLC 40281354). The 112 page book was a text for the college course Race and Sports Book Management that Roxborough taught at the College of Southern Nevada (formerly Clark County Community College) as part of the Casino Management curriculum. Roxborough was a partner in the 1997 Sprint Champion and Eclipse Award winning thoroughbred race horse Smoke Glacken. The novel Gambling on Magic by Christopher G. Moore (Heaven Lake Press) was loosely based on Roxborough's life. Roxborough is featured in the 2016 sports gambling documentary The Best of It."

  "text" : "Marcus Cocceius Nerva (before 5 BC – AD 33) was a member of the entourage of the Roman emperor Tiberius and a celebrated jurist. He was the son of Marcus Cocceius Nerva and the grandfather of emperor Nerva. In AD 24 Tiberius appointed him to the head of the curatores aquarum, a three-man commission responsible for Rome's water supply. In 33 he starved himself to death despite the pleas of Tiberius. In explanation Tacitus writes \"Those who knew his thoughts said that as he saw more closely into the miseries of the State, he chose, in anger and alarm, an honourable death, while he was yet safe and unassailed on.\" From this we may infer that he despaired at the tyrannies of the Praetorian Guard and committed suicide as a form of protest and may have been worried about his own safety."

But unlike his elders, he belongs to a generation influenced by the 1979 Islamic Revolution of Iran, the Saudi Salafi preachers and the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood, which brought him to join an Islamist group determined to islamize northern Nigeria and drive out non-Muslims. This movement reached its peak during the 80's and 90's. Muhammad Ashafa went on to become Secretary General of the National Council of Muslim Youth Organizations\"'an organization promoting debate and confrontation against Christians.During a confrontation between Christians and Muslims in Zongon Kataf, Muhammad Ashafa lost two cousins and his spiritual mentor, while Secretary General of the Kaduna State chapter for the Youth Christian Association of Nigeria (YCAN) Pastor James Wuye lost his right arm. In 1995, the two former opponents decided to work together and build bridges between their respective communities. With this aim in view, they launched the Interfaith Mediation Center of the Muslim-Christian Dialogue' Forum\"', an organization with over 10,000 members providing interfaith training to young people in schools and universities, to women, religious leaders and politicians. The Center has contributed to defusing tensions in the 2002 and 2004 clashes in Kaduna and Yelwa."

Subsequently, after Trope's graduation from Loyola Law School, he was admitted to practice law in California in 1987. As an agent for football stars, Trope was known for negotiating record breaking contracts in the 1970s, including the first million dollar package for an NFL rookie. This caused many publications to refer to Trope, still in his 20's, as a Super Agent by 1977, as well as \"Whiz Kid\" and \"LA's Boy Wonder\".

In Vienna he conducted pioneer ophthalmometric research with August Leopold von Reuss (1841-1924) that included studies of corneal astigmatism following cataract extraction. The two men are credited as the first to describe exact ophthalmometric observations on \"wound astigmatism\".

  "text" : "Mickey Patel (1941–1994) was an Indian cartoonist and illustrator OF books and magazines, as well as a painter and designer. He was born in 1941 in Lahore, which is now part of Pakistan and studied economics at St. Stephen's College, Delhi. In a tribute to Mickey Patel in Outlook magazine, Shobhita Punjia wrote that Mickey \"only made it to evening art classes, but was soon drawing cartoons for Shankar's Weekly and Yojana, later trying to make a living by working with advertising firms — Lintas, Thompson, ASP and Clarion\". According to Punjia, besides the illustrations he was best known for, Patel also worked as a visualiser and animated film-maker. His work was shown in international exhibitions and he won many awards, including the Noma Concours awarded by UNESCO for picture book illustrations, which he was nominated for three times (1978, 1984, 1986). As a freelance illustrator and cartoonist, Patel worked for newspapers and magazines such as India Today, Reader's Digest, Business Standard, Hindustan Times, Illustrated Weekly of India, as well as clients such as Air India, UNICEF, Oxford University Press (OUP), India Tourism Development Corporation (ITDC), and National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT), among others. He also did humorous greeting cards for Vakils in the 1960s, and cartoons for the Patriot, some of which can be seen in the Penguin Book of Indian Cartoons (1988).

  "text" : "Captain Michael Grass (c.1734–1813) was a German-born militia captain who was loyal to the British and led a contingent of United Empire Loyalists to Canada after the American War of Independence. Grass was one of the founders of Kingston, Ontario. He was born in Strasbourg, Germany, emigrated to America, and settled in Philadelphia in 1752. During his years in Philadelphia, he worked as a tanner and saddler. He later moved to New York City and then to Tryon County, New York where he began farming as well as continued his vocation of saddler. Grass served in the British regiment in New York during the Seven Years War. During this time Grass was apparently captured by French forces and imprisoned at Fort Frontenac around 1756, where he gained an appreciation for the Cataraqui area. In 1777, at the beginning of the American Revolution, Grass returned to New York City because Tryon County became too dangerous for Loyalists. While in New York he served as a lieutenant in the New York City Militia. In 1783, Grass and a group of Loyalist families were sent by Sir Guy Carleton to settle on the north shore of Lake Ontario. He was placed in charge of eight companies of Loyalists, consisting of up to a thousand people. From New York City they headed to Sorel, Quebec in the fall of 1783 and were given permission later that year by Governor Frederick Haldimand to settle at the location preferred by Grass - Cataraqui (later named Kingston). Grass arrived with about fifty families in 1784. Grass is considered one of the founders of Kingston, Ontario. He became a leader in the new community, creating one of the first permanent English-speaking towns in Canada. He was appointed a magistrate and performed many of the marriages in Kingston during these early yearsIn Kingston, Ontario, a street is named after Michael Grass. As well, the publishing house Michael Grass House bears his name."

  "text" : "Mordechai M. (Moti) Yung is an Israeli-American cryptographer and computer scientist currently employed at Snapchat (previously he worked at Google until early 2016). Yung earned his Ph.D. from Columbia University in 1988 under the supervision of Zvi Galil. In the past, he worked at the IBM Thomas J. Watson Research Center, was a vice president and chief scientist at CertCo and was director of Advanced Authentication Research at RSA Laboratories.He has also held adjunct and visiting faculty appointments at Columbia through which he advised several Ph.D. students including Gödel Prize winner Matthew K. Franklin and Jonathan Katz. In a 1996 publication with Adam L. Young, Yung coined the term cryptovirology to denote the use of cryptography by computer viruses and other malware and discovered the secure attack (from the attacker's perspective) for kidnapping data known as ransomware.Young and Yung authored the book Malicious Cryptography: Exposing Cryptovirology (John Wiley & Sons, 2004).(See also )In 1996 Yung and Young introduced the notion of kleptography to show how to use cryptography to attack host cryptosystems where the malicious embedded cryptologic resists reverse-engineering. The first such attack against a real system is believed to have been mounted by NIST against an American Federal Information Processing Standard detailing the Dual_EC_DRBG (essentially exploiting the repeated discrete logarithm based \"kleptogram\" introduced in 1997 by Young and Yung). Yung has contributed extensively to the foundations of basic cryptographic systems and protocols (such as to innovating the notion of public key cryptosystems secure against chosen-ciphertext attack, which is currently a major requirement from public-key encryption schemes operating on the Internet), as well as to numerous new cryptographic ideas and techniques. He also contributed to various constructions, leading to practical implementations and use in actual systems and networks. Awards: Moti Yung was the annual Distinguished Lecturer of the International Association for Cryptologic Research at Eurocrypt 2010. In 2013 he became a fellow of the Association for Computing Machinery(See also ).In 2014 he became a fellow of the International Association for Cryptologic Research, and in 2015 he became an IEEE fellow. In 2014 he received the ESORICS (European Symposium on Research in Computer Security) Outstanding Research Award  and he received the ACM's SIGSAC Outstanding Innovation Award."

  "text" : "Born on July 1, 1953, in Berkeley, California, Mark Terrill grew up in the unincorporated mountain community of Sky Londa in San Mateo County, south of San Francisco. After failing to complete high school, he travelled widely in the Pacific Northwest and Alaska, working as a dishwasher, woodcutter, gardener, bartender, taxi driver, gravedigger, sawmill worker, deckhand and welder before finally obtaining his seaman’s papers and shipping out of San Francisco to the Far East and beyond. Back in San Francisco in the late 1970s, Terrill became involved in the local music scene, and was founding member and lead guitarist for post-punk, anti-rock band, Ugly Stick. He was executive producer of the Farmer’s debut EP, Packed in an Urban Area, which appeared on his own label, BFM Records. He also co-starred in the film Beer Story. In 1981, he attended a writing workshop in Tangier, Morocco, with Paul Bowles, and after extensive travels throughout Morocco and Europe, finally settled in Hamburg, Germany in 1984. Simultaneously with pursuing his literary activities, he has been employed as a shipyard welder, road manager for various rock bands (American Music Club, Mekons, etc.), cook and postal worker. He currently lives on the grounds of a former boatyard with his wife, Uta, and several cats."

He was found guilty by majority verdict on 15 March 2012 and sentenced to life imprisonment. The judge ordered him to serve a minimum of 18 years in prison. The case is controversial because the prosecution obtained a murder conviction without a body. The body of Suzanne Pilley has never been found."

A monument to Wyldbore's memory can be found in the Lady Chapel of Saint John's Parish Church, Peterborough. Wyldbore has a particular connection with Saint John's Church because of a legacy he left to the bellringers, reputedly in gratitude for having found his way safely through the mists on Peterborough Common, by making for the sound of St John's bells.Wyldbore left a bequest for a peal of bells on the anniversary of his death, a tradition which continues to the present day each March 15."

  "text" : "Mihail Roller (Romanian pronunciation: [mihaˈil ˈrolər], first name also Mihai, also known as Rolea or Rollea; May 6, 1908 – June 21, 1958) was a Romanian communist activist, historian and propagandist, who held a rigid ideological control over Romanian historiography and culture in the early years of the communist regime. During his training in engineering, he rallied with the communist cells in Romania and abroad, joining the Romanian Communist Party while it was still an underground group. He collaborated with the Agitprop leaders Leonte Răutu and Iosif Chișinevschi, spent time in prison for his communist activity, and ultimately exiled himself to the Soviet Union, where he trained in Marxist historiography. Returning to Romania upon the close of World War II, Roller carried out communist assignments in the field of culture. Under Răutu, he helped draft the official history textbook, monopolizing the historical narrative for over a decade. Turning the focus away from nationality and on class struggle, Roller's work sought to reeducate the traditionalist public, and depicted Romania as strongly linked to Slavic Europe. In advancing such theses, Roller censored out historical events, and, in one instance, recounted events that never took place in real life. In the later 1950s, Roller found himself shut out by his communist peers. He was branded a deviationist by the party leadership members, probably because he had unwittingly exposed their secondary roles in early communist history. Roller died in mysterious circumstances, which do not exclude the possibility of suicide."

  "text" : "Margaret Elizabeth Johnstone (18 May 1851 – 29 September 1909), also known as 莊思端 in Chinese community, was an English missionary and educator in Hong Kong. In the 1860s, Margaret accompanied her father, a widowed army officer, on his posting to Hong Kong. She was enrolled in the English school opened by Susan Baxter and first met her teacher Mary Jane Oxlad (1840–1922) there in 1864. Later Margaret returned with her father to Ireland when his regiment left Hong Kong. After the death of her father, Margaret applied to the Society for Promoting Female Education in the East (FES) to be a missionary. After a period of training, she set sail for Hong Kong in March 1874. Margaret was assigned to the Baxter Vernacular Schools for Girls in Hong Kong, first assisting Oxlad. After Oxlad was transferred to Japan in 1877, Margaret took over their supervision. In 1880, she started a small boarding school for Chinese girls, which was later moved to the property known as 'Fairlea' on Bonham Road. The 'Fairlea' school provided Christian education for the daughters of Chinese Christians and served as a home for poor and orphaned girls, a training ground for day-school teachers, and the mission house of the FES missionaries. In 1891, the Diocesan Home and Orphanage transformed into a boys' school and the girls from DHO were accepted as students in 'Fairlea' by Margaret. Margaret also played an important part in establishing the Diocesan Girls' School in 1900. To evangelise and foster literacy among women, Margaret and her colleagues worked closely with the Church Missionary Society, in which the FES was dissolved in 1899. By then there were eight schools spread over Hong Kong and Kowloon, including the villages of Stanley, Shau Ki Wan and To Kwa Wan. In 1906 Margaret suffered a stroke, which obliged her, partially paralysed, to leave Hong Kong. She died in England in 1909. In June 1911, her old students and friends erected a tablet in St. John's Cathedral, on which her missionary work was highly praised."

She was orphaned at the age of 14, and worked to support herself and her two younger brothers, but enjoyed watching plays. She then studied under Charles Dullin. Her first lead role was in Le Mioche (1936). During the Occupation of France, she had a prominent role in Douce (film) and Lumière d'été (both 1943), and Sortilèges (film) (1944). Because she had acted during the Occupation, Robinson found it difficult to get work afterwards, but again came to prominence in Une si jolie petite plage (1949). Madeleine Robinson won the Volpi Cup for Best Actress in 1959 for her role in À double tour. In 2001, she was awarded a Molière d'honneur for her contribution to the field."

Kleiber graduated from the Federal Institute of Technology as an Agricultural Chemist in 1920, earned the ScD degree in 1924, and became a private dozent after publishing his thesis The Energy Concept in the Science of Nutrition. Kleiber joined the Animal Husbandry Department of UC Davis in 1929 to construct respiration chambers and conduct research on energy metabolism in animals. Among his many important achievements, two are especially noteworthy. In 1932 he came to the conclusion that the ¾ power of body weight was the most reliable basis for predicting the basal metabolic rate (BMR) of animals and for comparing nutrient requirements among animals of different size. He also provided the basis for the conclusion that total efficiency of energy utilization is independent of body size. These concepts and several others fundamental for understanding energy metabolism are discussed in Kleiber's book, The Fire of Life published in 1961 and subsequently translated into German, Polish, Spanish, and Japanese. He is credited with the description of the ratio of metabolism to body mass, which became Kleiber's law."

He was the Tamil Press's first caricaturists, according to Chennai historian S. Muthiah in The Hindu. Muthiah has written elsewhere that Mali did as much with his strokes for Vikatan as its celebrated editor Kalki Krishnamurthy did with his words. Mali published his drawings in the Indian Express in the 1930s, and first made his name at the Free Press Journal 'before being immortalised in the pages of Ananda Vikatan, the first popular Tamil periodical'. He also did cartoons for the Vikatan group's English-language Merry Magazine, where he became the editor in 1935. He is said to have left the editorial nitty-gritty to his assistant editor, while continuing to illustrate such humorous serials as 'Private Joyful in Madras' (The magazine shut down in c. 1935 or 1936). While it was the writer and poet Subramanya Bharathi who first introduced cartoons to Tamil journalism, it was Ananda Vikatan that made them truly popular. As cartoonist and senior artist at Ananda Vikatan, Mali was thus a key influence on a second generation of cartoonists. Gopulu and Silpi were illustrators he mentored at Vikatan. According to Tamil film historian Randor Guy, Mali designed the famous logo for Gemini Studios, which depicts cherubic twin buglers. Mali died in c. 1947, according to an obituary in The Indian Review."

McDonald served as the commissioner of the United States Commission of Fish and Fisheries from 1888 until his death in 1895. He is best known for his inventions of a number of fish hatching apparatuses and a fish ladder that enabled salmon and other migrating fish species to ascend the rapids of watercourses resulting in an increased spawning ground. McDonald's administration of the U.S. Commission of Fish and Fisheries was notably free of scandal and furthered the \"protection and culture\" of fish species throughout the United States."

  "text" : "Murray Isaac Lender (October 20, 1930 – March 21, 2012) was an American businessman and entrepreneur who helped expand his father's small, Connecticut bagel bakery, Lender's Bagels, into a nationwide brand. Murray Lender served as the chief executive officer of Lender's, while his brother, Marvin, served as the company's president. Under Murray Lender, Lender's Bagels began selling frozen bagels to supermarkets in 1960, introducing many American consumers to the bagel for the first time. The Washington Post called Lender \"the most important man in the modern history of bagels.\" Murray Lender also became known to the public for appearing in a series of television commercials for Lender's Bagels. Murray Lender's father, Harry Lender, immigrated from Lublin, Poland, to the United States in 1927. That same year, Harry opened a small bagel bakery in New Haven, Connecticut, which catered to the city's Eastern European Jewish community. His wife, Rose Braighter Lender, and their two oldest children, Hyman and Sam, followed Harry Lender to the United States in 1929. Murray Lender was born in New Haven, Connecticut, on October 29, 1930. He graduated from Junior College of Commerce, which is now known as Quinnipiac University.Later, as chairman of Quinnipiac’s Board of Trustees, he heard Quinnipiac President John L. Lahey give talks on the history of the Great Hunger in Ireland, and as a result donated funds to create the Ireland's Great Hunger Museum at Quinnipiac. “A lot of Irish and Irish American artists and supporters helped to make this day possible, but without the support of a son of a Jewish immigrant from Poland who saw parallels in our experience we wouldn’t be ...(able to).. dedicate this new facility. That’s a proof of how important this story is to all immigrants,” Lahey said. All four brothers - Hyman, Sam, Harry and Marvin - entered the family's bagel business, called H. Lender's and Sons. Harry Lender died in 1958 and the brothers began freezing bagels for sale in 1960. Murray also came up with the idea of pre-slicing bagels. Murray Lender and his family sold Lender's Bagels to Kraft Foods in 1984. The brand was acquired by the Pinnacle Foods Group in 2003. Murray Lender died at a hospital in Miami, Florida, on March 21, 2012, at the age of 81. He had suffered injuries in a fall ten weeks earlier at his home in Aventura, Florida. He was survived by his children Carl Lender, Haris Lender and Jay Lender and 6 grandchildren."

In late 1678, Vigoreaux hosted the party were Maitre Perrin heard Marie Bosse say that she was a professional poisoner. This led to the arrest of Vigoreaux and Bosse as well as Bosse's family on 4 January 1679. They were the first to be arrested in the actual Poison Affair, and their testimony led to the arrest of La Voisin and the exposure of her whole organisation. Marie Vigoreaux was proven to be closely linked to the Bosse family, as she was claimed to have had sexual relations with all of the family members. At the threat of torture, Vigoreaux and Bosse confessed to be poisoners and made a list of their customers and colleagues. Vigoreaux implicated Marguerite de Poulaillon by naming her as her client: when Poulaillon expressed that she wished to be a widow, Vigoreaux had recommended her to Bosse. Adam Lesage claimed that Vigoreaux and her spouse had been commissioned by François-Henri de Montmorency, duc de Luxembourg to murder his wife and a business associate, and her husband later identified Montmorency in prison, though he later retracted his statement. Vigoreaux had also been commissioned by the Marquis de Feuquieres to make him untouchable in battle by the use of magic, and to murder someone who tried to prevent him from marrying. 4 May 1679, Vigoreaux and Bosse was sentenced to be tortured and burned to death. Marie Vigoreaux died during torture in a device designed to crush bones."

  "text" : "Marsha V. Kazarosian (Armenian: Մարշա Ղազարոսյան) is an American attorney in Haverhill, Massachusetts notable for handling high-profile cases in the New England area. Her handling of a gender discrimination case involving a country club brought her national recognition. She represented one of the teenaged defendants in the 1990 murder of a young husband by his wife Pamela Smart, who conspired with her teenaged lover to murder her husband for insurance money; the story became the basis of the subsequent movie To Die For starring Nicole Kidman, and the television movie Murder in New Hampshire starring Helen Hunt. Her legal skill was the subject of a cover story entitled The Power of Marsha Kazarosian in a publication geared to the legal community. Massachusetts Lawyers Weekly listed her as a top lawyer in New England, and she has been identified as a top Massachusetts attorney in another publication for every year since 2006. Her law practice focuses on civil litigation, family law, discrimination and general litigation. She has litigated cases involving gender discrimination, ethics in government, rape victims, sexual harassment, police misconduct, and other issues. She has appeared on local television regularly to discuss legal matters. In 2014, she is president of the Massachusetts Bar Association. Kazarosian is the daughter of the late Armenian American lawyer Paul Kazarosian, and both of her parents were children of survivors of the 1915 Armenian genocide. Since the age of four, Marsha Kazarosian wanted to be a lawyer like her father. She graduated from Phillips Academy in 1974, the University of Massachusetts Amherst in 1978, and earned a law degree from Suffolk University Law School in 1982. In 1996, women members of the Haverhill Golf and Country Club were dissatisfied with its treatment of women regarding membership, tee time availability and membership wait lists; Kazarosian represented them. It became a high-profile case reported in the national media in which opposing lawyers described her as a \"barracuda attorney\" according to Sports Illustrated. Kazarosian described how female club members felt excluded by the male-dominated club: It's like an old high school football team that grew up together and moved to the country club. If you cross them, you're blacklisted...— Marsha Kazarosian, in Sports Illustrated, in 1998 Kazarosian earned a $3.9 million financial judgment for the women plaintiffs, and the judgment was upheld by a state appeals court which reviewed the case. According to the New York Times, it was the first instance in which a state's public accommodations law was upheld by a state appeals court when applied to discrimination at a country club. In addition, Kazarosian has been an active leader in bar associations at the county and state levels. Her firm has offices in Haverhill and Salem."

She teaches live model drawing, portrait and aquarelle at Centre des Arts 'le Hangar' in Chateauneuf de Grasse. She is founder of Aquarellista!, a movement for all artists who use Aquarelle as their main technique.

In 2011 she won the Prize of the Culture Council in the Grand Prix d'Aquarelle de Belgique. In 2010 and 2011 she participated as one of the main artists in the Holotropic Art Symposium in Romania. Kulik has published a learning guide on aquarelle watercolour painting (the 2nd Hangar Watercolour Booklet)in 2009 and a book on cat-art, 'Chatatouille' dedicated to an exhibition of paintings and sculptures of cats together with sculptor Sally Ducrow. Kulik frequently has solo exhibitions all over Europe (England, Italy, Romania, Belgium, Sweden) and especially in galleries in France (Vence, Cannes, Paris, Nice), and her home country the Netherlands (Amsterdam, Rotterdam, The Hague, Hilversum). She also exhibited in the United States (Seattle). For her abstracts she is represented by Gallery Oscar (Nice). Kulik is married to French society realtor Jeroen Zaat, has two daughters, several cats and sails a 52 ft classic yacht 'Avatar' that she and her husband crossed the Atlantic with.

She mastered the language and so got access to the treasure of knowledge on various sastras at a young age.She composed several verses in Sanskrit and was known all over Kerala as a gifted poet. However, except for few shlokas, not much is available of her work. She was also the contemporary of (Dharma Raja) Sree Karthika Tirunal Balarama Varma Maharaja of Travancore (1724–98), who had the title 'Dharma Raja', meaning 'the king of righteousness'. During the time when Malabar was invaded by Tipu Sultan of Mysore, she stayed in exile at Travancore. It was during her exile at Travancore that the king completed the treatise on dramaturgy viz. Balarama Bharatam and Manorama Thampuratty offered her comments and suggestions, leading to its fruitful completion. Her correspondence with king Karthika Tirunal is of historic importance."

  "text" : "Magdelaine Chapelain (1651 - June 1724), was a French fortune teller and poisoner. She was a defendant in the famous Poison Affair. Chapelain was a very successful fortune teller who had secured a fortune at her work. She had acquired her spouse, a former usher with a position as bureaucrat, and she also owned several buildings. In connection to the Poison Affair, she was implicated because she had formerly employed Françoise Filastre as a maid: when Filastre was arrested upon her return from a certain trip to the Auvergne (province) in December 1679, it was a trip which had been financed by Chapelain. Chapelain was also connected to Louis de Vanens, to whom she had rented a house. Adam Lesage claimed that Chapelain made her fortune by manufacturing poisons and performing black magic in collaboration with a man by the name of Boucher, and Filastre claimed that she had on occasion supplied Chapelain with poison for the use of selling, that Chapelain had commissioned her to help her form a pact with Satan, and that Chapelain also performed curses and other magical services for her clients. Filastre claimed, that it was Chapelain who had been commissioned by Madame de Montespan to place an assassin (Filastre), in the household of Angelique de Fontanges. Like many other involved with the Poison Affair, Magdelaine Chapelain was never trialed, but imprisoned in perpetuity by a Lettre de cachet at Belle-Île-en-Mer. The date of death is not known for all of them, but of the prisoners whose date of death is known, Magdelaine Chapelain's death in June 1724 was the last recorded."

  "text" : "Minggatu (Mongolian script: ᠮᠢᠨᠭᠭᠠᠲᠦ; Chinese: 明安图; pinyin: Ming'antu, c.1692-c. 1763), full name Sharabiin Myangat (Mongolian: Шаравын Мянгат) was a Mongolian astronomer, mathematician, and topographic scientist at the Qing court. His courtesy name was Jing An (静安). Minggatu was born in Plain White Banner (now Plain and Bordered White Banner, Xilin Gol League, Inner Mongolia) of the Qing Empire. He was of the Sharaid clan. His name first appeared in official Chinese records in 1713, among the Kangxi Emperor's retinue, as a shengyuan (state-subsidized student) of the Imperial Astronomical Bureau. He worked there at a time when Jesuit missionaries were in charge of calendar reforms. He also participated in the work of compiling and editing three very important books in astronomy and joined the team of China's area measurement. From 1724 up to 1759, he worked at the Imperial Observatory. He participated in drafting and editing the calendar and the study of the armillary sphere. His seminal work The Quick Method for Obtaining the Precise Ratio of Division of a Circle (Chinese: 割圜密率捷法; pinyin: Ge Yuan Mi Lu Jie Fa), which was completed after his death by his son Mingshin, and students (among them his most gifted pupil Chen Jihin and an intendant in the minister of finance, Zhang), was a significant contribution to the development of mathematics in China. He was the first person in China who calculated infinite series and obtained more than 10 formulae. In the 1730s, he first established and used what was later to be known as Catalan numbers. The Jesuit missionaries' influence can be seen by many traces of European mathematics in his works, including the use of Euclidean notions of continuous proportions, series addition, subtraction, multiplication and division, series reversion, and the binomial theorem. Minggatu's work is remarkable in that expansions in series, trigonometric and logarithmic were apprehended algebraically and inductively without the aid of differential and integral calculus. In 1742 he participated in the revision of the Compendium of Observational and Computational Astronomy. In 1756, he participated in the surveying of the Dzungar Khanate (renamed Xinjiang), which was incorporated into the Qing Empire by the Qianlong Emperor. It was due to his geographical surveys in Xinjiang that the Complete Atlas of the Empire (the first atlas of China drawn with scientific methods) was finished. From 1760-1763, shortly before his death, he was administrator of the Imperial Astronomical Bureau."

  "text" : "Minnie Fisher Cunningham (March 19, 1882 – December 9, 1964) was the first executive secretary of the League of Women Voters, and a suffrage politician who worked for the passage of the Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution giving women the vote. A political worker with liberal views, she became one of the founding members of the Woman's National Democratic Club. In her position overseeing the club's finances, she helped the organization purchase of its Washington, D.C. headquarters, which is still in use. Cunningham was descended from wealthy plantation slaveholders who had moved to Texas from Alabama. By the time she was born in 1882, the family fortunes had been dissipated by the Civil War and Reconstruction, forcing her mother to sell vegetables to make ends meet. She holds the distinction of being the first female student of the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston to earn a Graduate of Pharmacy degree. As a member of the National American Women's Suffrage Association, Cunningham helped persuade Senator Andrieus Aristieus Jones of New Mexico, chair of the Senate Woman Suffrage Committee, to introduce the amendment for a vote. Cunningham was part of a team who met with President Woodrow Wilson in the Oval Office, successfully coaxing the President into releasing a statement expressing a leaning towards suffrage. When Texas Governor James E. Ferguson actively opposed the passage of the Nineteenth Amendment, Cunningham formed a coalition that helped impeach the governor. She was active for decades in both national and Texas state politics. In 1928, Cunningham became the first woman from Texas to run for the United States Senate. She supported the New Deal policies and programs of Franklin D. Roosevelt, and sought to uplift the status of the disenfranchised in the country. Cunningham saw the connection between poverty and nutrition, and worked for government legislation to require nutrient enrichment of flour and bread. Cunningham's 1944 Texas gubernatorial candidacy against incumbent Coke Stevenson garnered her second place in a field of nine candidates. To meet the expenses of running a county campaign office for John F. Kennedy's presidential race, she sold used clothing."

Carter and Marian Wright Edelman, a lawyer who worked for the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund Inc., sued the Drew School District to challenge the Mississippi \"freedom of choice\" law. In 1969 the plaintiffs won the suit. In 1969 a court order ended the segregation system in the Drew School District.

  "text" : "Matthew G. Carter (October 16, 1913 – March 14, 2012) was an American pastor and politician who served as the Mayor of Montclair, New Jersey from 1968 to 1972. Carter was the first African American to serve as Mayor of Montclair. He also served as the chairman of the New Jersey State Commission on Civil Rights. Carter was born in Danville, Virginia, on October 16, 1913, to Clarence and Henrietta Carter. He became the pastor of the Zion Baptist Church, located in Petersburg, Virginia. Carter received a bachelor's degree from the Virginia Union University in 1939, before completing his Master of Divinity from Virginia Union University's School of Theology in 1942. Carter later completed additional graduate studies at Columbia University and the Union Theological Seminary in New York City. Carter entered local politics in Montclair, New Jersey in 1964, winning election to the Montclair Town Commission. He ran on the Montclair Community Committee slate and was the top vote-getter with 6,694 votes. Four of the five candidates on Carter's ticket won. He served as both the Commissioner of Public Works and the Vice Mayor of Montclair from 1964 to 1968. Carter also held a seat on the Montclair Township Commission. He was re-elected to the Township Commission in 1968, defeating eleven other candidates in the election. In 1971, Carter sought the Republican nomination for New Jersey State Senator, running At-Large in Essex County. His running mates were three incumbent Senators, Michael Giuliano, James Wallwork, and Milton Waldor, as well as North Caldwell Republican Chairman Frederic Remington. Carter received 19,011 votes in the Republican primary, significantly more than his closest rival for the nomination, Donald Blasi of Newark, who received 3,557 votes. Carter lost the general election, finishing 8th in a field of 16 candidates for 5 seats. Giuliano and Wallwork won, along with Democrats Ralph DeRose of South Orange, Frank Dodd of West Orange, and Wynona Lipman of Montclair, the first African American woman to serve in the New Jersey Senate. Carter received 77,418 votes. Lipman, who came in fifth, received 85,644 votes. Carter was elected Mayor of Montclair by his colleagues on the Commission in 1968, the same year as his re-election. He served until 1972. Carter was a strong advocate of the expansion of affordable housing during his tenure. His advocacy and professional work in the field continued after leaving office. He established a Fair Housing local ordinance for Montclair, which stipulated that housing decisions should not be based on national origin or race. In 1979, Carter oversaw the opening of the Erie Lackawanna Apartments, a low income housing complex spearheaded by local residents and the Union Baptist Church. The 126-unit apartment complex was subsidized with funding from the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development. In 1999, the apartments were remained the Matthew G. Carter Apartments to honor Carter for his contributions. Carter was appointed as the chairman of the New Jersey State Commission on Civil Rights, a statewide body. He went on to serve on the boards of many other organizations as well. Professionally, Carter also held positions as the assistant director of the YMCA publishing house, based in New York City, and the Department of Community Affairs of Hoffmann-La Roche. Matthew Carter died of complications of Alzheimer's disease on March 14, 2012, at the age of 98. He was survived by his wife, Frances Hill Carter; two daughters, Bettye Carter Freeman and Nanette Carter; and three granddaughters. His daughter, Bettye Freeman, who was formerly a Massachusetts assistant attorney general for civil rights, is a dean of students at Northeastern University School of Law."

He was the father of Louis Blais who also was actively involved in the militia. Although Blais remained loyal to the British government, in January 1776, he announced at the local church that a Pierre Ayotte was recruiting for the American side; it was later said that no one showed up. In March of that year, Blais' house became the headquarters for the royalist advance guard. The house was attacked by the Americans in what was to be known as the Battle of Saint-Pierre; three British supporters were killed, several were wounded and many were captured. Blais died at Saint-Pierre-de-la-Rivière-du-Sud in 1783."

  "text" : "The Venerable Mother Maria Kaupas, S.S.C., (January 6, 1880 – April 17, 1940) was an American Catholic Religious Sister who founded the Sisters of Saint Casimir. She was born Casimira Kaupas in Ramygala, Lithuania, then part of the Russian Empire. At the age of 17 she emigrated to the United States, where she settled in Scranton, Pennsylvania, to work as a housekeeper for her brother, the Reverend Anthony Kaupas, who was pastor of St. Joseph Parish there. While there she had her first contact with Religious Sisters and was attracted by their way of life. She also became aware of the struggle her countrymen had in the United States due to the language barrier, especially in their spiritual life. Overcome by homesickness, Kaupas returned to Lithuania in 1901, but she kept seeking to determine where her call in life was. She soon resolved to become a teaching Sister, especially committed to the care of the Lithuanian immigrants in America. Kaupas' brother soon informed her that the Lithuanian clergy in the United States were seeking to establish a new community of Religious Sisters dedicated to teaching the youth of their community in a religious setting, and to preserve their native language and customs. She was asked to lead this new venture and she began her studies toward this end with the Sisters of Mercy of the Holy Cross in Switzerland in October 1902. Although the Priests Council disbanded in 1904, Kaupas determined nonetheless to pursue the idea of a new religious congregation. In 1905 Jeremiah F. Shanahan, Bishop of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, agreed to sponsor this new congregation. Mother M. Cyril, I.H.M., accepted Kaupas and two companions into the novitiate of the Sisters, Servants of the Immaculate Heart of Mary, based in Scranton, for their preparation for consecrated life. At that time she received the religious name of Sister Maria. On August 29, 1907, Kaupas made her profession of religious vows, and the Congregation of the Sisters of St. Casimir was founded. The Sisters immediately began to work in the parochial schools of the region. In 1911, they established their motherhouse in Chicago, where there was a large Lithuanian population. They began to staff schools in Lithuanian parishes of the city. Over time, Sisters were sent to teach in many parishes across the United States, both Lithuanian and non-Lithuanian. Their service also came to include home missions in New Mexico. In 1928, the Sisters of St. Casimir began their health care ministry with the opening of Holy Cross Hospital in Chicago. She founded the beautiful school Villa Joseph Marie in Holland, PA. This school remains thriving to this day. It is situated on beautiful acres of property at the corner of Holland and middle Holland Road. It has roughly under 400 students and 40 faculty members. It has countless elective opportunities, clubs, and classes available. Students are very obsessed with their school, and their mascot the Jem Bear. Students often attend highly selective universities post VJMHS graduation. See  for more information. Kaupas died in Chicago, Illinois, on April 17, 1940. In 2010, she was found to have lived a life of heroic virtue by the Congregation for the Causes of Saints in Rome and was declared Venerable."

  "text" : "Marco della Tomba, O.F.M. Cap. (1726-1803), was an Italian Capuchin friar, who served as a missionary in North India, then called by its Persian name of Hindustan. He was a part of the Mission to Tibet financed by the Sacred Congregation of Propaganda Fide, which still supervises the missionary activity of the Catholic Church throughout the world. Friar Marco appears to have lived and worked in Tibet, Nepal, and northern India, viz., Bihar and Bengal. He is credited for writing several essays and letters describing his experiences of Indian society and customs for the benefit of future missionaries, notably in two autobiographical essays: Diversi sistemi della religione dell'Indostano and Osservazioni sopra le relazioni che fa Monsieur Holwell Ingles; several translations of Indian religious texts from Hindi to Italian; and 55 pieces of correspondence between himself and Cardinal Stefano Borgia, Secretary of the Congregation of Propaganda Fide. This friar was literally unknown or unheard of until his life and works were described by journals and articles published by Cambridge University Press and others, based on a research project in 1998 by David Lorenzen, an author who used Marco's surviving letters in the Vatican Library and the Vatican Secret Archives of the Propaganda Fide to write a personal and intellectual biography of him from Marco's own view. Lorenzen used the texts of Marco's surviving letters and essayswith material from various works to fill in the gaps. He thus wrote the friar's life, attributing to Marco words that he never wrote or spoke, in order to \"construct\" a \"historical text\"."

  "text" : "Michael Malet (c 1632 - after 1683) was an English lawyer and politician who sat in the House of Commons from 1660 to 1679. He was a zealous Protestant and opponent of the court and appears to have lost his reason. Malet was the son of Sir Thomas Malet of Poyntington. He was a student of Middle Temple in 1650 and was called to the bar in 1655. He became a member of the Rota Club in 1659. In 1660, he was elected Member of Parliament for Milborne Port in the Convention Parliament. He was a J.P. for Somerset from July 1660 to 1670 and a commissioner for maimed soldiers from December 1660 to 1661. In 1661 he was re-elected MP for Milbourne Port in the Cavalier Parliament. He was commissioner for assessment for Somerset from 1661 to 1669 and for Berkshire from 1664 to 1667. In 1675 he became a bencher of Middle Temple. He was commissioner for assessment for Westminster from 1677 to 1679. Malet was an extreme Protestant opposed to the High Church as well as Roman Catholics. He was also an outspoken enemy of the Court and apparently became increasingly insane. It was said of him when Samuel Pepys introduced the naval programme \"Michael Malet, who, to make good the M’s in his name, is many times mightily mad, without a metaphor or a trope, said he knew no need we had of ships in time of peace, unless it were to carry away the Italian women again, meaning the duchess of York.\" Later it was reported that he \"came to the Queen’s drawing room to show he can be as mad elsewhere as in the Parliament House, and there bawled out aloud to his royal highness, quite across the circle when the room was full, ‘Monsieur le Duc, il faut laisser l’idolatrie, il faut faire Dieu votre ami; il vous servira mieux que le roi de France, ce que je maintiendrai’; which he was so pleased with that he said it over twice; and afterwards, being persuaded out of the Queen’s presence, uttered twenty other follies in the privy chamber\". His final disgrace came at a by-election in Berkshire in July 1678 when \"poor, maggot-headed Mr Malet\" uttered some words ... which were said to \"reflect very greatly upon his Majesty’s honour\" and he was sent to the Tower. He was never brought to trial and was last recorded alive in 1683. Malet married Mary Aldworth, widow of John Aldworth of Letcombe Regis, Berkshire and daughter of Thomas White of Fyfield Berkshire by 1664. They had at least three sons. He was the brother of John Malet."

Steen attended Mission High School, growing up in the city's first post-World War II housing project. His father enlisted in the United States Navy shortly after the attack on Pearl Harbor, serving in the Pacific Theater, and as a staff sergeant in the U.S. Air Force during the Korean hostilities. His younger brother Scott Steen is a jazz trumpeter and session man with Royal Crown Revue, recording on more than 20 albums.

He played for several years during the 1990s with Tigres, but his career did not really shine until he joined Guadalajara in 1998. He became a frequent starter with Chivas as a left-sided attacking midfielder, small in stature but an eager dribbler. He helped Guadalajara reach the final of the Apertura championship in 1998, which ended in a loss to Necaxa. Although the club's fortunes soon entered a period of decline, Ruiz remained with Chivas for three more years until he rejoined Tigres in 2002. His final top-flight season came in the Apertura 2004 campaign. Ruiz also represented the Mexico national team in international play. A late bloomer on the world stage, Ruiz made his international debut at the age of 31 against Ecuador on 20 September 2000, in which he scored a goal. His international career coincided entirely with the coaching tenure of Enrique Meza, who preferred him at the position of left wingback. Mexico's results dipped during the qualifying campaign for the 2002 FIFA World Cup, culminating in elimination from the 2001 FIFA Confederations Cup and a home defeat against Costa Rica. Meza came under intense pressure and was eventually dismissed in June 2001, and Ruiz was never capped again by any subsequent Mexico coaches. Ruiz's last international appearance came in a 3-1 defeat against Honduras in a World Cup qualifying match on June 20, 2001."

  "text" : "Marco Kartodikromo (1890 – 18 March 1932), also known by his pen name Mas Marco, was an Indonesian journalist and writer. Born to a low-ranking priyayi (noble) family in Blora, Dutch East Indies, Kartodikromo's first employment was with the national railway. Disgusted by the racism shown there, in 1911 he moved to Bandung and found work as a journalist for Medan Prijaji. The following year he moved to Surakarta and worked with two publications, Saro Tomo and Doenia Bergerak; he soon began to write pieces critical against the Dutch colonial government, which led to his arrest. After a period as a correspondent in the Netherlands, Kartodikromo continued his journalism and critique of the government; he also wrote several pieces of fiction. Involved with the Communist Party of Indonesia, after a 1926 communist-led revolt Kartodikromo was exiled to Boven-Digoel prison camp in Papua. He died in the camp of malaria in 1932. Kartodikromo, who preferred writing in Malay, experimented with new phrasings at a time when the state-owned publisher Balai Pustaka was attempting to standardise the language. According to literary critic Bakri Siregar, he was the first Indonesian writer to openly criticise the Dutch colonial government and the traditional form of feudalism practised in the country. For this vocal criticism, the Dutch government decried him as a \"crazy\" man who could spark unrest among the native populations."

  "text" : "Muley Xeque (Arabic: مولاي الشيخ‎‎ Mawlay al-Shaykh) was a Moroccan prince, born in Marrakech in 1566 and died in Vigevano (Lombardy, Italy) in 1621. Exiled in Spain, he was converted to Catholicism in Madrid and was known as Philip of Africa or Philip of Austria, in addition to the nickname of The Black Prince. He was the son of Saadi Sultan Abdallah Mohammed, who after reigning between 1574 and 1576 was dethroned by his uncle, Abd al-Malik (1576-1578). Aided by Portuguese troops under the command of King Sebastian of Portugal, al-Mutawakkil faced his rival on August 4, 1578 in the Battle of the Three Kings, which resulted in the defeat of the Portuguese and which killed three monarchs, giving way to the reign of Ahmad al-Mansur, the brother of Abd al-Malik. After a stay in Portugal, he lived in Carmona from 1589 to 1593. According to Lope de Vega, who was his personal friend and whose comedy \"The Baptism of the Prince of Morocco\" must be part of what we know about the character, Muley Xeque decided to leave Islam after attending in Andújar to the procession of the Virgin Head. On November 3, 1593 he was baptized in the Monastery of San Lorenzo de El Escorial, sponsored by Philip II, after whom he was named. He was made a grandee of Spain and Commander of the Order of Santiago. He was well acquainted with Madrid's high society of the time. He lived in a mansion at the corner of Huertas and Prince streets (which gave its name) in the place currently known as Santoña Palace. His friend, Lope de Vega, dedicated his sonnet 148 to him. Upon the expulsion of the Moors, the presence of a former Muslim in the court became uncomfortable, so Muley Xeque moved to the Spanish possessions in Italy. There he died in Vigevano, near Milan, where he was allegedly buried, but his exact resting place is unknown. A chronicler of Vigevano, Matteo di Cherasco Gianolio, picked up the eventful life of Muley Xeque in a book called the Vita Memorie storiche intorno the real prince Muley Xeque di Marocco, another of the historical sources on the life of this character. Muley Xeque is due, and the name of Prince Street in Madrid, Calle Felipe Africa in Valdemorillo, where he lived some time before his baptism. In Getafe, there is another street of the same name, not about Muley Xeque, but another Moroccan prince who, years later, was baptised with the same name."

He emigrated to England in 1882 and became a naturalized British citizen in 1887. Giwelb was noted for his genial and unassuming nature which contrasted with the rarity of the material in which he dealt. He owned a modest shop in Leicester Square and later the Strand, before eventually retiring to Brighton with his wife Natalie. Giwelb was responsible for the unmasking of the forger Dr. Bernhardt Assmus, after he bought forged Penny Black VR official stamps from Assmus. He accompanied the police on a visit to Assmus' premises at 12 Church Street, Islington, and assisted them at Vine Street Police Station in sorting the seized material. His wife was Natalie Giwelb."

Voronin was a successful businessman, academician and innovator and entrepreneur of a unique method of tailoring menswear without fittings, called the zhyletno-maketnoho method, for which he received a patent in 1970. The 1980s led him to establish his own business. In 1985, he established the company \"Мода і час\" (Fashion Hour). In 1991, he launched \"Михайло Воронін\" or \"Michael Voronin\" in Vienna and Paris. Since 1994, the brand is owner of the chain \"Zhelan\". Many celebrities have worn the brand.

  "text" : "Martin Gunnar Knutsen (29 September 1918 – 23 February 2001) was a Norwegian politician, chairman to the Communist Party of Norway (NKP) 1975–1982. Knutsen was born in Skien. He was active in the resistance during the German occupation of Norway. While being a teaching student he published the clandestine bulletin Fritt fram (Norwegian for \"Freely forward\"). Knutsen, along with a group of colleagues, was arrested in 1944 and Fritt fram ceased publication. During the 1950s he stayed in Moscow, and worked as a newsreader for the Norwegian-language broadcasts of Radio Moscow. On 5 March 1953 he was the first to read out the news of the death of Joseph Stalin to a Norwegian audience. Knutsen headed the orthodox group inside NKP, which resisted the moves by the party chairman Reidar T. Larsen to merge the party into the Socialist Electoral League (SV). Knutsen replaced Larsen as party chairman in 1975, and pulled the party out of SV. After the rupture with SV the marginalization of NKP continued. Knutsen had been a deputy member of the Parliament of Norway during the term 1973–1977, and met during 2 days of parliamentary session. He headed the NKP candidate slate in Akershus in the 1977 legislative election, but was not elected, as the party obtained only 0.4% of the votes nationwide. Knutsen was also a member of the executive committee of Skedsmo municipal council from 1971 to 1975. Knutsen was a recipient of the Soviet Order of Friendship of Peoples. He stepped down from the NKP chairmanship in 1982. Knutsen left NKP in September 1990, after five decades of membership in the party. He met his wife Nina in 1977, a translator and teacher hailing from Zlatoust. He died in 2001."

Kalman was appointed editor in chief of The Jerusalem Report in January 2012. and held the position until August 2012, resigning when asked to \"implement a 10 per cent budget cut demanded by the management.\" Kalman said \"I would rather resign than try to produce the magazine on even more of a shoestring than we currently have.\" Kalman has also reported for and is a television contributor for PBS in the United States, and Channel 4 News, UK, and CTV in Canada. He is a commentator for BBC Radio in Britain, and other radio programs in Canada as well. Kalman was the only reporter present throughout the 7-year James Ossuary trial in Jerusalem of Oded Golan, accused of faking the ossuary, or burial box, of James, the brother of Jesus. He thoroughly chronicled the events online. In 1999, then-Hamas leader Sheikh Ahmed Yassin made a peace offer to the incoming Israeli government of Ehud Barak during an interview with Kalman. In 2008, he co-directed and co-produced, with David Blumenfeld, the documentary Circumcise Me: The Comedy of Yisrael Campbell, which has been screened at more than 50 film festivals in the US, UK, Canada, Australia and on TV in the US and Israel.

  "text" : "Martin Poll (November 24, 1922 – April 14, 2012) was an American film and television producer. Poll produced eleven feature films during his career, including The Lion in Winter, for which he received a 1968 Academy Award nomination for Academy Award for Best Picture. The Lion in Winter, which starred Katharine Hepburn and Peter O'Toole, received nine nominations and won three Academy Awards. It also won a Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture – Drama. Poll was born on November 24, 1922, in New York City. Poll launched his production career in 1954, when he produced thirty-nine episodes of the televisions series, Flash Gordon, for distribution in West Germany and France. Poll purchased and restored the Biograph Studios, a studio facility and film laboratory complex in the Bronx, during the 1950s. He reopened the studios in 1956 under a new name, Gold Medal Studios. The reopening made the Bronx-based facility the largest film studio in the United States located outside of Los Angeles at the time. Poll helped create numerous films at Gold Medal Studios, including A Face in the Crowd in 1957, The Goddess in 1958, The Fugitive Kind in 1959, Middle of the Night in 1959, and BUtterfield 8 in 1960. Poll was appointed the Commissioner of Motion Picture Arts of New York City in 1959 for his work with Gold Medal Studios. The New York City government soon established its own film commission shortly after Poll's appointment. Poll sold Gold Medal Studios during the early 1960s to focus on film production. In addition to his body of film work, Poll also produced television series, films and specials as well. His credits included The Dain Curse, a 1978 CBS television miniseries; The Fantastic Seven, a 1979 CBS television movie; and Diana: Her True Story, a TV film which aired on NBC in 1993 based on a book by Andrew Morton. Poll earned an Emmy nomination for executive producing a remake of The Lion in Winter, starring Glenn Close as Eleanor of Aquitaine, which aired on Showtime in 2003. Martin Poll died in New York City on April 14, 2012, at the age of 89. He was survived by his wife, Gladys Poll; three sons – Mark Poll, Tony Jaffe and Jon Poll, a film editor and film director; and three grandchildren."

He played an important part in the development in the town and the district. Father Clancy was enthusiastically involved in the life of the town, local committees and governing bodies. He was instrumental in the changing of Geraldton's name to Innisfail in 1910. He also advocated for forging a link to the Atherton Tableland and the use of Mourilyan Harbour by shipping. Mount Father Clancy Garreth McGonnell near the Beatrice River was named in his honour."

In April 2012, he successfully appealed against the death sentence under North Carolina's 2009 Racial Justice Act which allows for a prisoner under sentence of death to appeal for the sentence to be commuted to life imprisonment if racism is proven to be a factor in the original trial. North Carolina Superior Court judge Gregory Weeks found that the Act was applicable in Robinson's case after his lawyers cited a study from Michigan State University indicating that qualified black jurors were systemically excluded from jury service, both generally in North Carolina and at Robinson's trial. Consequently Weeks ordered his removal from death row. Robinson was the first death row inmate to use the legislation."

Fearing an alliance between Muhiti and General Ma Hushan, Sheng moved against Muhiti, who fled to Srinagar in India. After Muhiti reached Srinagar, he went on pilgrimage to Mecca the following year.He was said to have gone to Japan via steamboat from India and asked the Japanese emperor for aid in liberating his homeland.

  "text" : "Maurilius (c. 1000–1067) was a Norman Archbishop of Rouen from 1055 to 1067. Maurilius was originally from Reims, and was born about 1000. He trained as a priest at Liege and became a member of the cathedral chapter of Halberstadt. He became a monk at Fecamp Abbey, but then became a hermit at Vallombrosa. From there he was elected abbot of the monastery of St Marry of Florence, but his austerity caused a revolt amongst the monks and he was forced to return to Fecamp. Maurilius held the office of Archbishop of Rouen from 1054, when he first occurs in documents as archbishop. The Annals of Jumieges, however, place his elevation as archbishop in 1055. Maurilius succeeded Mauger, who was deposed by a council held in 1054 or 1055 at Lisieux under the guidance of a papal legate. After Mauger's deposition, Maurilius was appointed because of his support for church reform. Contemporaries praised his saintly character which gained him respect from his fellow clergy. He was also known for his scholarly interests and knowledge. He was a benefactor of the abbeys of Saint-Ouen, Jumièges, Le Tréport, and Saint-Ymer. Along with Lanfranc, he convinced the future St Anselm to take monastic vows in 1060. As archbishop, he built a large church to replace Rouen Cathedral. He also held at least one provincial synod - the 1063 Synod of Rouen, and perhaps held another ecclesiastical council sometime between 1055 and 1063. The archbishop's last appearance in documents happens in 1067, and he died in the summer of 1067. His last public act was to consecrate the new abbey church at Jumièges on 1 July 1067 in the presence of Duke William, newly returned from his conquest of England in 1066. Two different dates are given for Maurilius' death, with a notice of his death appearing for 11 July at the monastery of Mont Saint-Michel but Jumièges Abbey recorded his death on 9 August. He was buried in Rouen Cathedral. After his death, the archbishopric was offered to Lanfranc, who refused the office."

  "text" : "Moshe Mayer (October 25, 1909 - September 23, 1993) was a Romanian-Israeli architect, real estate developer and businessman. He was noted especially for his luxury hotels in African nations, including the Ducor Intercontinental Hotel in Monrovia (1960) and the Hotel Ivoire in Abidjan (1963) and his skyscrapers and presidential palaces in Tel Aviv and other cities. His achievements in real estate and hotels in the 1960s saw him hailed by Haaretz as \"man of the year\" in 1970. They said of him, \"The State of Israel is too small for Moshe Mayer. He is constructing housing, skyscrapers and luxury hotels, and building rivieras and presidential palaces. For over 20 years he has been hopping to and fro ... spending most of his time in airplanes or at his Geneva headquarters.\" By 1967 he was the wealthiest man in Israel and became Chairman of Mafit Trust Corporation Ltd. of Geneva, Switzerland. Due to his extreme wealth he amassed an extensive valuable art collection including many Vincent van Gogh originals which he left to the Tel Aviv Museum of Art before he died in September 1993 in Tel Aviv where he had lived for much of his life."

  "text" : "Marian Partington (born 21 February 1948) is an English writer, and the sister of Lucy Partington, who was abducted by Fred and Rosemary West on 27 December 1973 and murdered by them in the final days of 1973 or the first days of 1974. In May 2012 she wrote about the impact of Lucy’s life, disappearance and death in her memoir, If You Sit Very Still. The book builds on Salvaging the Sacred, an essay written by Marian and published in The Guardian Weekend in May 1996. The essay inspired a play, by Bryony Lavery and a feature film, by Juliet McKoen, both entitled Frozen. In April 2012, prior to the publication of her memoir, Marian was interviewed in the Financial Times Magazine. In November 2012 the former Archbishop of Canterbury, Rowan Williams, cited If You Sit Very Still by Marian Partington as one of his books of the year in the Times Literary Supplement. In 2004, Partington’s story was featured in The F Word exhibition; The Forgiveness Project's exhibition which explores forgiveness in the face of atrocity. She works as a storyteller, in schools and prisons, for The Forgiveness Project, a charitable organisation which explores forgiveness, reconciliation and conflict resolution through real-life human experience. Partington has forgiven one of her sisters killers, Rosemary West, but she did not reply and got the prison where she is serving life to tell Partington she doesn't want her to write again. In contrast though, Partington exchanges Christmas cards with one of Fred West's daughters, and West's younger brother got in touch when she wrote to him, saying he hoped something good could come out of all this evil. Marian is a Quaker and a Buddhist."

At the age of 10, she was offered to a Monsieur V and the Comédie de Marseille. Her mother died two years later and Marie became a premieres danseuse (first dancer) of the Lyon opera. By the age of 14, she was employed at the Comédie-Française and lived in a small apartment in Paris. Shortly after beginning her studies with balletmaster Gaétan Vestris, she became his lover. In 1760 she gave birth to a son, Auguste Vestris. In June 1761 Allard made her debut at the Paris Opera in Jean-Philippe Rameau's Zaïs. The audience and the young rakes Duc de Mazarin and Monsieur de Bontems were quite taken with her. In her first decade at the Paris Opera she danced 35 roles and received commendation for her pas de deux with Jean Dauberval in Sylvie. Allard and Vestris also taught dance to their son, who would become the leading male dancer of his generation. At one point, Allard's contract was suspended temporarily \"on the ground that her deplorable habit of producing two children every eighteen months caused her to be constantly in a condition which was destructive of all stage effect.\" Her career started to decline as her son rose to fame and the committee asked her to retire in 1781. Allard died from a stroke in 1802."

  "text" : "Marius Lavet (Clermont-Ferrand, February 8, 1894 - Paris, February 14, 1980) was a French engineer who invented in 1936 the principle of stepper motor. He studied at Supélec, the School of Electric Power, French private engineering school. A stepper motor can turn an electrical impulse in angular movement. This type of engine is very common in all devices where it is desirable to control the speed or position in open loop, usually in positioning systems. The invention of Lavet is enshrined in French Patent FR823395 and was instrumental, among other applications, for the development of watches with quartz mechanism, using the principle known as the piezoelectric. Quartz watches are today largely predominate in the world for its low price and its high precision, coming to have a negligible deviation for comuns citizens."

  "text" : "May Collins (26 May 1903 – 6 May 1955), an American actress on stage and in silent films, was the star in several of the first of the modern romantic comedies to reach the movie screen. The daughter of Benjamin Collins and Lillie Smith, she spent most of her early life in New York City. At the age of four years she saw Peter Pan on stage and it was said that after the play she ran out to the stage door to catch a glimpse of the main star, Maude Adams. “I ran up to her calling ‘oh Peter Pan,’” said Collins in an interview, “…Miss Adams raised me up in her arms and gave me a kiss.”May Collins started out as a member of Mrs. August Belmont's dramatic society in New York City. While there she earned several prizes for acting. She was cast in the stage play \"The Betrothal.\" Later she joined William A. Brady's forces, and played in Owen Davis melodramas.\"The sort you know,\" laughed Miss May Collins, \"where you say: 'You're not the man I married! Get out of the room before I shoot! But gawd, how I love you!'\" Collins also had a part in a play with Grace George in \"She Would and She Did.\" She had top billing in several silent films, All’s Fair in Love and The Shark Master; in 1921; and Red Hot Romance, and Little Eva Ascends in 1922. Collins' last role, on Broadway, was as Elizabeth Edwards in the original Abe Lincoln in Illinois in October 1939. The play won the 1939 Pulitzer Prize for Drama. Collins later repriced her role in the first TV adaptation of the play in 1945. She also spent two years in Australia starring in The Trial of Mary Dugan."

During the 1970s and 1980s, Lovell began to pursue other professions and interests outside of entertainment. She returned to college as an adult and became a therapist. She specifically focused on AIDS patients with the onset of the AIDS epidemic during the 1980s. Lovell and her husband, Peter Matz, held fundraisers which raised thousands of dollars for AIDS Project Los Angeles. Lovell continued her therapy practice during the 1990s. She simultaneously returned to the entertainment industry singing at jazz clubs and cabarets in the Los Angeles area, including the Jazz Bakery and Cinegrill. She was cast in a small role in the 1996 film, Ghosts of Mississippi, directed by Rob Reiner. Matz died of complications from multiple sclerosis, which she lived with for thirty years, on April 13, 2012, at the age of 81. She was survived by two stepsons and her grandchildren.

In 1728, he arrived at the Moravian community of Herrnhut in Saxony. In 1733, Stach traveled to Greenland together with Christian David and his cousin Christian Stach where they were greeted by the Danish pioneer missionary Hans Egede. Together they founded the settlements of New Herrnhut (modern Nuuk) and Lichtenfels. In 1741, he made a return trip to Germany where he was both ordained into the ministry and became married. Matthäus and Rosina Stach left the Greenland mission and returned to Germany in 1771. The following year he was called to the Moravian settlement in Bethabara, North Carolina. Over the rest of his life, he and his wife Rosina operated the local Moravian boys' school. Stach died in 1787 at Bethabara."

  "text" : "Mitchell Flint (born June 27, 1923) is an American lawyer and a veteran aviator. He was a U.S. Navy Fighter pilot during World War II, and later served as an American Volunteer pilot in Israel's first fighter squadron during its War of Independence. Mitchell Flint was born in 1923 in Kansas City, Missouri. His father Harry worked for the Pendergast political machine. Harry was also a decorated U.S. fighter during World War I and introduced teenage Mitchell to his lifelong love of flying at Kansas City's original airfield. Flint graduated from Westport High School in Kansas City, where he took part in the school's Junior Reserve Officers' Training Corps, graduating with honors. He volunteered at age 18 to serve as a fighter pilot in the U.S. Navy's World War II effort. Following his successful completion of the Civilian Pilot Training Program, Mitchell served in the Pacific Theater on the naval air carrier, the USS Wasp, under Admiral John S. McCain, Sr.. Flint performed multiple dive bombing missions in the Pacific while flying the Vought F4U Corsair fighter aircraft. He shot down a Kamikaze and ultimately was awarded three Air Medals for his war efforts. After six years of service in the US Navy, he continued flying for sixteen years in the United States Navy Reserve, ultimately achieving the rank of Commander. Concerned for the plight of Europe's Holocaust Survivors in the aftermath of World War II, Flint volunteered as an American fighter pilot in Israel's first aviation unit -- The 101 Squadron. He served under Commander Modi Alon and flew alongside Ezer Weizman, the country's future President, during Israel's War of Independence. Most notably, he led the dive-bombing team which ousted Colonel Gamel Abdel Nasser, the future President of Egypt). Flint may be the only pilot in history to fly the Corsair, the Avia S-199, North American P-51 Mustang and the Supermarine Spitfire in wartime combat. Flint attended, and along with other War for Independence volunteers, was saluted for his efforts at Israel's Silver Anniversary in 1979, and again in 1999, at Israel's Golden Anniversary. Mitchell Flint lives in Los Angeles, where he earned his law degree from UCLA, and has had a family law practice for over fifty years. He is married to Joyce Flint, a former fashion designer-turned conservator, and has two sons, Michael, a film producer in Hollywood, and Guy, an educator. He also currently serves at a Co-Director for Machal West, an organization composed of American Veterans who fought in Israel's War for Independence, which he co-founded."

He exhibited 14 works at the 1876 Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia. One of these was a marble statuette of Hercules and Antaeus, a copy after Stefano Maderno's c. 1622-25 original. His best-known work is a twice-lifesize marble statue of George Washington (ca. 1876), depicted standing at the prow of a boat while crossing the Delaware River. This was bought for Trenton, New Jersey in 1889, installed in Cadwalader Park in 1892, and moved to Montgomery Plaza in 1976. Eyre is buried in Bagni di Lucca, Tuscany, Italy. He was an uncle of the architect Wilson Eyre."

  "text" : "Michael James Robert Dillon (2 October 1798 - 15 May 1850) was the 12th and last Earl of Roscommon. Michael James Robert Dillon was born on 2 October 1798, nearly four months after his father, also called Michael Dillon, had died. Michael Dillon senior had been a captain in the Dublin Militia and he was killed at the Battle of New Ross, opposing the Irish Rebellion against British rule. The young Michael Dillon's mother was Mary Dillon, née Griffith. The eleventh Earl of Roscommon, Patrick Dillon, had been the subject of two prolonged investigations by the Irish House of Lords during the 1790s to ascertain his legitimacy as son of the tenth Earl, against the rival claim by Robert Dillon, a descendant of the seventh son of the first Earl and the next male heir in line. The Earldom of Roscommon became dormant on the death of Patrick Dillon in 1816. Robert Dillon having since died, his claim passed to Michael Dillon, whose grandfather James 'Surgeon' Dillon had been Robert's first cousin. Michael spent 10 years working to prove his claim to the title until 1828 when the United Kingdom House of Lords decided that he was the rightful heir to the Earldom and he became the twelfth Earl. As part of its deliberations the Lords decided against Francis Stephen Dillon, an inmate of a debtors' prison who dubiously claimed descent from the third son of the first Earl. Michael Dillon married Charlotte Talbot on 19 August 1830. They had a single child, a son named James who was born in 1831 but died the same year. Charlotte died on 21 November 1843 and Dillon himself died on 15 May 1850 at age 51, resulting in the Earldom of Roscommon falling dormant."

He continued his musical studies with William Massot and at the Conservatory of Music in Madrid, with teachers like Tragó, Galiana, Chapí and Hernando. He then worked in Madrid with the Polish composer Weber. He obtained a grant from the Island's Council to complete studies in Germany, where he was a student at the Conservatory of Music in Berlin. Among his teachers there was Anton Rubinstein who would become a good friend. He taught music for the royal families of Prussia (the Hohenzollerns ) and Saxony, and gave concerts for European royalty. In 1906 he married Gabriela Miteau with whom he had four children. In 1912 he moved with his family to Madrid, and three years later to Barcelona. He died in Pollença on 21 December 1935 and is commemorated by a bronze bust (at 39°54′28″N 3°04′55″E﻿ / ﻿39.90772°N 3.08181°E) in the main square of Port de Pollença, Placa de Miquel Capllonch, which is named after him."

  "text" : "Mascezel (Latin: Masceldelus or Mascezel; died circa 398) was briefly ruler of Roman North Africa after the defeat of his brother Gildo during the Gildonic war in 398 AD. He is credited with landing 5,000 Roman legionnaires in the province on the orders of Stilicho in order to put down the revolt. He was favourably compared to his elder brother by the panegyrist Claudian. According to Paulinus of Milan, Ambrose of Milan appeared to Mascazel in a dream and assured him of victory against his brother. Zosimus described his death as follows: By means of this victory, the brother of Gildo restored Africa to Honorius, and returned to Italy. Though Stilico was envious of him for his great achievement, yet he pretended an attachment to him, and gave him favourable expectations. But subsequently, as he was going to some place in the suburbs [of Rome], and was pacing over the bridge, Masceldelus among others attending on him, the guards, in obedience to a signal which Stilico gave them, thrust Masceldelus into the river, where he perished through the violence of the stream."

  "text" : "Muhammad ibn Khalid ibn Yazid al-Shaybani was an Arab general and governor for the Abbasid Caliphate, active in the Caliphate's Caucasian provinces in the 9th century. Muhammad was a member of the Shayban tribe, originally from the Diyar Bakr in the northern Jazira, and the grandson of Yazid ibn Mazyad al-Shaybani. Yazid and his sons established Shaybanid influence over the Caliphate's Transcaucasian provinces by repeatedly occupying the office of governor (ostikan) of Arminiya (a large province encompassing Armenia, modern Azerbaijan, Iberia and Arran). His father Khalid served in the same office no less than four times: in 813/814, 828–832, briefly in 841 and again shortly after, dying in office ca. 844. Muhammad succeeded him in his post, continuing his work of suppressing the various local rebellions by Muslim and Christian princes. After his dismissal, he returned to his ancestral lands in Diyar Bakr, and was re-appointed as ostikan in 857, following the bloody suppression of a major Armenian rebellion under Bugha al-Kabir. He received the office again in 878, when according to Thomas Arcruni he tried to form an alliance with other local Muslim rulers such as the Kaysites to curtail the rising power of the Prince of Princes Ashot Bagratuni, but was defeated and forced to flee the country. He was the last Shaybanid governor of Arminiya. According to medieval Arabic sources, Muhammad founded the city of Ganja in 859/60, so called because of a treasure unearthed there. According to the legend, the Arab governor had a dream where a voice told him that there was a treasure hidden under one of the three hills around the area where he camped. The voice told him to unearth it and use the money to found a city. He did so and informed the caliph about the money and the city. Caliph al-Mutawakkil made Muhammad the hereditary governor of the city on a condition that he would give the money he found to the caliph."

She is trained in a variety of styles of dance including ballet, modern dance, African dance, the Horton technique, Spanish dance, jazz, movement and mime, flying low technique, release technique, gumboot dance and Butoh. Nyamza is known for blending styles in a way that challenges traditional standards. Nyamza has performed nationally and internationally and has choreographed autobiographical, political, and social pieces both on her own and in collaboration with other artists. She draws inspiration from her daily life and her identity as a young, black woman. Nyamza's abstract dance style allows her to use dance as a way to share both her own personal stories as well as African stories with the world. Additionally, has created various community outreach projects that have helped to spread the positive influence of dance to different communities within South Africa, including the University of Stellenbosch's Project Move 1524, a group that works to educate on issues relating to HIV/AIDS, domestic violence and drug abuse, through dance movement therapy."

  "text" : "Mihai Robu (April 10, 1884—September 27, 1944) was a Romanian cleric, bishop of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Iaşi. Born in Săbăoani, Neamţ County, He entered the Roman Catholic Theological Institute of Iași in 1894, being ordained deacon in 1906 and priest in 1907. For several years, starting before his priestly ordination, he was in charge of the Iaşi seminarians. During World War I, when the seminary was closed, he was a parish priest at Văleni, Faraoani and Bacău. In 1920, he returned to teach when the seminary reopened, and was named secretary to Bishop Alexandru Cisar. In 1922, he was named parish priest at Horlești and chaplain at an Iaşi monastery. In 1925, he was consecrated Bishop of Iaşi by Cisar. Among his activities were the building of numerous churches, special attention to the seminary and the opening of a new one at Luizi-Călugăra, support for the Catholic press and many visits to parishes in the diocese. By 1943, during World War II, Robu had become disturbed by the treatment Moldavian Catholics were receiving from local officials who derided and harassed them as allegedly being ethnic Hungarians or Csangos. He sent a petition to dictator Ion Antonescu in which he explained that the community were in fact ethnic Romanians, and asked that the mistreatment come to an end. The government agreed with Robu, promising to investigate and punish those responsible. In March 1944, due to the approach of the Eastern Front, he closed the seminary and withdrew with the students to Beiuş. Meeting with repression from the German and Hungarian armies, he went to the mountains at Finiș in mid-September. He caught double pneumonia and soon died. Buried in Beiuş, his remains were moved to the old Roman Catholic cathedral in Iaşi in 1964."

  "text" : "Mas Mansoer was born on 25 June 1896 in Kampung Sawahan, north of Surabaya. His father was Kyai Hajji Mas Ahmad Marzuki, a descendant of the Sumenep royal family and a friend of Kyai Hajji Ahmad Dahlan. His mother was a woman from Surabaya who was of mixed Buginese and Minang descent. At the age of 12, Mansoer went to Mecca to study Islam. He then enrolled at Al-Azhar University in Egypt. During his studies, he read several Western literary works about freedom, humanism, and democracy. He also observed how Egyptian people fought against British colonists to obtain their independence, which influenced his later views. After graduating from Al-Azhar, Mansoer returned to Surabaya and became an ustaz at the Mufidah pesantren. During this period, he felt that the colonial government hindered the teaching of Islam. This situation made him join Muhammadiyah and Persatuan Bangsa Indonesia (Indonesian People's Association). He preached in remote areas. In 1914, Mansoer and Abdul Wahab Hasbullah (the cousin of Hasyim Asy'ari) founded an educational organization named Nahdhatul Wathan (Awakening of the Homeland). They also joined the Indonesche Study Club, an organization led by Dr. Sutomo. Later, he became a chairman of East Java branch of Muhammadiyah. In 1937, he became a chairman of Muhammadiyah through an election at the 26th Muhammadiyah Congress. Because of his widespread influence, the colonial government offered him a position in the Het Kantoor van Inlandsche Zaken as the head of institution of religious affairs. However, he refused it. Mansoer took the initiative in formatting the Majelis Islam A'la Indonesia on 25 September 1937. The purpose of the organization was to aid clerics throughout Indonesia in networking and building relationships with each other, both physically and spiritually. Under influence from the nationalism movement, MIAI was also involved in opposing the colonial government, such as in the like Gabungan Politik Indonesia (GAPI; Indonesian Political Federation) led by M. H. Thamrin. In 1938 he founded the Partai Islam Indonesia (Indonesian Islamic Party) with Dr. Sukiman. During the Japanese occupation, Mansoer was under pressure due to his activities with Muhammadiyah. Mansoer, Kyai Hajji Wahid Hasyim, and Kyai Hajji Taufiqurrahman then formed an Islamic organization called Masyumi. After the group was formed, the Japanese government banned all political organizations and formed PUTERA (Pusat Tenaga Rakyat; previously Jawa Hokokai) to spread its propaganda. Mansoer, along with Soekarno, Mohammad Hatta, and Soewardi Soerjaningrat, were appointed as leaders in 1942; collectively they were known as the Empat Serangkai (Four Series). He accepted the appointment and resigned as Chairman of Muhammadiyah. Mansoer resigned from PUTERA in 1944 by reason of illness. During this period, Mansoer conveyed an idea of a roemah jang moerah dan sehat (\"cheap and healthy house\") in a meeting with other intellectuals and Japanese officers; this was hoped to solve housing problems faced by native Indonesians. His idea was supported by Soekarno. He also drew a blueprint for the project. Before the Proclamation of Indonesian Independence, Mansoer became a member of the Panitia Persiapan Kemerdekaan Indonesia (Preparatory Committee for Indonesian Independence). During the national revolution, Mansoer helped the people of Surabaya in defending the city against the British Army. Then, he was arrested by the Dutch, and was told to give a speech and convince the people of Surabaya to surrender; however, he refused. As a result, Mansoer was jailed in Kalisosok Prison in Surabaya. Mansoer died on 25 April 1946 in the prison. His remains were buried in Gipu, Surabaya."

  "text" : "Mialy Rajoelina (born Mialy Razakandisa) is the spouse of Andry Rajoelina, the president of the High Transitional Authority of Madagascar from 2009 until 2014. She is the president and spokesperson of Fitia, a humanitarian association aiming at helping the poor and the sick. She is the youngest first lady Madagascar has ever had. Mialy was born as the oldest of three girls and has a masters degree in finances and accounting management at the Conservatoire National des Arts et Métiers in Paris. In 1994, Mialy met her future husband Andry Rajoelina in a high school in Antananarivo. The couple maintained a long-distance relationship for for six years while Mialy completed her studies in Paris and Andry started his career as an entrepreneur. They reunited in Madagascar in 2000 and got married in the same year. Mialy have three kids with Andry: two boys, Arena (born 2002) and Ilonstoa (born 2005), and a daughter born in 2007 that the couple named Andrialy, a contraction of their own names. Mialy marriage with Andry allowed the later to become head of Doma Pub, a company owned by Mialy's in which Andry was to become leader on the local advertising hoarding market and kick start his career as an entrepreneur. Most of her family went to France during the 2009 crisis due to safety concerns, including the couple's children. Milaly has French citizenship which she obtained while studding in France. Mialy has made frequent public appearances, such as when she spoke at a TED Talks in Antananarivo in 2011. Since her husband has become president Mialy has founded the FITIA association, which aims to collect donations and offer them the most vulnerable in Madagascar, especially women. Supporters of Milay and her husband say that the FITIA show that the couple care for Madagascar and its people while opponents say that the organization is a propaganda campaign aimed at increasing their popularity. Mialy has admitted to using her popularity to help her husband although she also adds that she sees nothing wrong with it and that people who support her usually support her husband as well. Like he husband Milay is a Roman Catholic, in April 2013 she and Andry met with Pope Francis to become the first African head and first lady to be recived by the new pope at that time. Mialy and Andry set some records when the later became president, Andry is Africa's youngest ever president and Mialy is Africa's youngest ever first lady."

  "text" : "Dr. Mabel Harlakenden Grosvenor (July 28, 1905 in Beinn Bhreagh, Nova Scotia – October 30, 2006 in Baddeck, Nova Scotia) was a Canadian-born American pediatrician, and a granddaughter and secretary to the scientist and telephone inventor Alexander Graham Bell. She lived in both Beinn Bhreagh, Nova Scotia and Washington, D.C. Grosvenor oversaw the stewardship of Bell's legacy Canadian estate at Beinn Bhreagh, Baddeck, Nova Scotia, until her death, and was also the Honorary President of the Alexander Graham Bell Club (founded in 1891), Canada's oldest continuing women's club. The club grew out of a social organization started at Beinn Bhreagh, by Mabel Bell, Alexander's wife. When Grosvenor died in 2006 at age 101, she was the last surviving individual to have personally known and worked with Alexander Graham Bell."

  "text" : "Mahmoud Shokraye is an Iranian cartoonist. He is most famous in English-speaking world for being sentenced to 25 lashes for a caricature he drew for a newspaper of a local member of parliament for the city of Arak. Shokraye drew a cartoon of local politician Ahmad Lotfi Ashtiani for Nameye Amir, a city newspaper in Arak. The cartoon depicts Ashtiani in a football stadium, dressed as a footballer, with a congratulatory letter in one hand and his foot resting on the ball. Ashtiani sued Shokraye for insulted him. The Markazi provincial court then found in favor of Ashtiani and sentenced the cartoonist to 25 lashes. The punishment was unprecedented for an Iranian cartoonist and prompted a backlash in Iran's online community and social media with calls for cartoonists to draw new caricatures of the MP. Nikahang Kowsar, a prominent Iranian cartoonist who was also punished for caricaturing a prominent official told the Guardian newspaper: \"This verdict is a direct threat to each and every cartoonist working inside Iran. From now on, if this sentence is not set aside, any public official could sue the cartoonists for portraying him/her in a cartoon.\". Iranian journalist Masih Alinejad thought the sentence notable as a sign of Iranian authorities' lack of tolerance towards any form of criticism, and noted the very mild nature of the caricature. \"He has drawn the MP exactly the way he is, even with his prayer mark. Actually the MP's cartoon looks better than the MP himself.\" Amnesty International also protested the lashings."

In 1782 he went to Paris, moving there with his younger brother Johan-Jakob-Georg Haas (1756-1817), another engraver. There he worked under Nicolas de Launay. In 1786 he accepted a commission to copy art works in the Berlin Gallery and became a member of the Academy of Berlin in 1793.

  "text" : "Michael Gaismair, (1490, Sterzing, County of Tyrol – 15 April 1532, Padua, Republic of Venice) was the son of a mining entrepreneur, which became secretary of the powerful bishop of Brixen. In 1525 Gaismair came in contact with the ideas of the Anabaptists Felix Mantz and Jörg Blaurock, who worked in the Eisacktal and Graubünden (Switzerland), and shortly after, in May, he received news of the German Peasants' War in Germany, and the activities in Saxony of the radical preacher Thomas Müntzer, who shared some ideas with the Anabaptists. Shortly, the same Tyrol (under Habsburg rule) became a powder keg of popular uprisings, especially in the Eisacktal and Puster Valley. These peasant revolts were captained by a certain Peter Passler and Gaismair: Brixen and Neustift were occupied and looted. The rebels, reinforced by local miners and survivors of the Battle of Frankenhausen, resisted the Habsburg army counterattacks. Gaismair dreamed of founding a democratic republic in the area, he envisaged the abolition of the Catholic Church and its rituals, replaced by a faith based on a direct contact with God, through the personal interpretation of Scripture. He also envisioned a utopian elimination of titles of nobility, the nationalization of land and mines, the establishment of schools, hospitals, old people’s homes etc. To overcome the differences the leaders of the revolt were invited to the regional diet of Innsbruck (June 1525) by Crown Prince Ferdinand of Habsburg (b. 1503, Emperor 1558–1564). Gaismair also went there, but in August he was jailed for treason. After two months, he managed to escape, travelling to Graubünden, Switzerland. Gaismair established contact with the Swiss reformer Ulrich Zwingli, with the plan of a new democratic order in Tyrol and Salzburg by the example of Grisons and Venice. Among other things, by the disappointing experience of the parliamentary debates Gaismair evolved from reformer (Summer 1525) to revolutionary social rebel (1526). In his draft of a new order of Tyrol in May 1526 Gaismair designed an egalitarian, democratic, Christian state. Gaismair again gained followers, and in the spring of 1526 assisted the revolt of the peasants in Salzburg. Despite the victories on the field, Gaismair and his army were forced to retreat through the territory of the Republic of Venice, then at war with the Habsburgs. The Bauernführer (head of the farmers), as Gaismair was called, then turned to the Doge Andrea Gritti (1523–1538) to convince him to support a military revolt in Tyrol, but he failed in his intent. He died in 1532 in Padua, in Prato della Valle (where there is a plaque in his memory) murdered at the hands of two soldiers who wanted to collect the bounty placed on his head by Ferdinand I. The movement of Gaismair was then done, but not the religious turmoil of Tyrol, which in the same years saw the development of Anabaptist preaching by Jakob Hutter."

  "text" : "Marisela Escobedo Ortiz (1958 – Chihuahua, Chihuahua, December 16, 2010) was a Mexican social activist, killed while protesting the murder of her daughter that occurred in 2008. Marisela Escobedo Ortiz's social activism began in 2008 in Ciudad Juarez following the murder of her 16-year-old daughter Ruby Frayre. Marisela Escobedo and her husband claimed their daughter was allegedly murdered by Sergio Rafael Barraza Bocanegra. They managed to locate Barraza in Fresnillo, Zacatecas, where he was arrested and taken to Juarez where he confessed to the crime in court and told of the burial of the remains of Ruby. Barraza was however acquitted by judges for lack of evidence and was released, thereby generating a scandal that became known nationally and internationally. In response, Marisela Escobedo began a series of protests against the resolution against Chihuahua state authorities, asking for Barraza to be arrested and tried again, appealing the decision. A circuit court overturned the acquittal and Barraza was sentenced for murder, while Barraza remained a fugitive from justice. After numerous representations to the governors Jose Reyes Baeza Terrazas and Cesar Duarte Jaquez, they moved their protest to the Plaza Hidalgo in the city of Chihuahua in front of the Government Palace, the home of the governor where on 16 December 2010 Marisela was killed by an unknown assassin by a single shot to the head."

He also suggested female circumcision. He also told the workshop, \"Women have got more moisture in their organs as compared to men so there is need to research on how to deal with that moisture because it is conducive for bacteria breeding. There should be a way to suck out that moisture.\" Gender Activist Betty Makoni said that he should withdraw his statement."

He was born in Baesweiler and his father was from Aldenhoven, Germany. Goebbels painted in the historicist style of the Nazarene movement and decorated the walls of more than 20 churches in the Rhineland region. The interiors of Rolduc Abbey near Kerkrade, Netherlands are considered his masterpiece. Many of his paintings are no longer extant today, however well-preserved examples can be found near Rolduc, in particular at St. Briktius in Oekoven-Rommerskirchen (pictured) and at the former Marienborn Monastery (German: Kloster Marienborn) in the village of Hoven near Zülpich, Germany. He was also commissioned to paint the wings on the late Gothic altarpiece at Antwerp Cathedral with pictures from the life of Jesus. In appreciation of his services, in 1892 he was appointed Canon at Aachen Minster. Although a tomb in Aachen was built for him, his wishes were to be buried in his birthplace, so he is instead buried in Baesweiler cemetery. In the spring of 2007, a town square in front of the cemetery was named after him."

  "text" : "Marguerite Delaporte (1610 – after 1682) was a professional French poisoner and fortune teller. She was one of the accused in the famous Poison Affair. Delaporte was the widow of a baker. She was a professional fortune teller who claimed to see visions in a glass of water after it had been prepared with spells. During the Poison Affair she was pointed out as a customer of the master poisoner Maitre Pierre, who claimed that she, as well as Marie Bosse, La Voisin, and Catherine Trianon, all bought poison from him for the use of their clients. Delaporte herself claimed, that when a customer asked her to foretell the death of her spouse, she would always answer that it was in the hands of God. It was Delaporte who introduced La Voisin to her lover, the alchemist Denis Poculot. Poculot was later kidnapped by the marquis de Termes, who demanded that he manufacture gold for him, and it was the release of Poculot which would be the official errand of the poisoned petition La Voisin attempted to present King Louis XIV of France in her attempted regicide. Delaporte was also among those pointed out by Marguerite Monvoisin to have participated in the black masses arranged by Etienne Guibourg for Madame de Montespan. She was to have participated together with La Pelletier. Delaporte belonged to the group consisting of 14 individuals to have had direct contact with de Montespan, alongside Monvoisin, Guibourg, Adam Lesage, Romani, Bertrand, Monsieur and Madame Vautier, Magdelaine Chapelain, Philippe Galet, Latour, La Pelletier, Lafrasse and La Belliere, and who were therefore not put on trial, but imprisoned for life without trial by a lettre de cachet."

  "text" : "Marguerite Joly (1637 – 19 December 1681) was a professional French poisoner. She was one of the accused in the famous Poison Affair. In March 1680, Joly was arrested in connection to the Poison Affair, when she was pointed out by Etienne Guibourg. She was described as a skillful professional poisoner and poison manufacturer who equalled La Voisin in rank, and said to be extremely dangerous. During torture, Joly admitted being a professional abortionist. She also claimed to have knowledge of human sacrifices of infants during black masses. Marguerite Joly became the star witness in the case against Francoise de Dreux. Dreux had been acquitted in April 1680, but was arrested a second time because of the testimony of Joly. She pointed out Dreux as her regular client in her capacity of poisoner. She claimed that Dreux had poisoned two former lovers, Pajot and de Varennes; that she had tried to poison the Duchess de Richelieu, the wife of her lover Duke de Richelieu; that she had plans to murder her brother and sister-in-law Monsieur and Madame Saintot, as well as all rivals who was ever visible around her lover Duke de Richelieu. The first mentioned deaths could not be proven as murders, however, and the eventual attempted murders of the others had not succeeded, if they had taken place. Dreux left the country after the arrest of Joly, but a warrant for her arrest was issued. Dreux was judged guilty in her absence because of the statement of Joly. Marguerite Joly was sentenced to be burned at the stake. Before her execution, she was subjected to water torture. During the torture, she confessed to several murders and pointed out Anne Meline as her accomplice. She claimed that she had been present at the sacrifice of the nephew of La Poignard to Satan; at the sacrifice of an infant at a black mass for a Mademoiselle de Saint-Laurens to induce a desired marriage; that she had committed murder supplied with poisons by a female cosmetic in collaboration with Meline, who had also murdered Joly's former spouse. As soon as the torture stopped, however, she retracted her statements, with the exception of that regarding Saint-Laurens. She was executed the same night."

He was consecrated titular bishop of Tegea in the Byzantine Rite by Manuil Olshavskyi, Vicar Apostolic of Mukacheve on 16 September 1748. This arrangement did not satisfy the diocese's Romanians, who wanted an independent diocese, a separate cathedral, Romanian schools, their own seminary and monastery, and better pay for their priests and archpriests. Covaci pressed these demands, but only obtained better funding for clergy in the 95 parishes (divided into eight archpriests' districts) extant in 1765. He died in 11 April 1775 in Oradea."

  "text" : "Marin Medak (born 1987) is a Slovenian adventurer. Marin is one of the youngest ocean rowing expedition leader and the first Slovenian to row across the Atlantic Ocean. Marin Medak lives in Piran and is a student at the Faculty of electrical engineering on the University of Ljubljana. He started sea kayaking in early 2009 and after four months departed for his first solo sea kayaking adventure. He paddled the islands of Dalmatia (Croatia), starting at Lošinj (Croatia)and finishing in Zadar (Croatia). A year after he kayaked solo 1400 km from Savudrija (Croatia) to the Island of Zakynthos (Greece). In 2011, he persuaded an experienced sea kayaker Simon Osborne (UK) to come with him to South Korea. In March 2011, after 23 days of temperature around or below freezing, the duo become the first to successfully paddle the length of the coast of South Korea.In the same year Marin and his Paralympian friend Gal Jakič try to set a speed record for kayaking the coast of Croatia, but had to abort the expedition due to medical problems. After three years of adventures around the world it was time for Marin to live his dreams and row across the Atlantic ocean. In early 2012 he successfully skippered a four-man Slovenian-British Ocean Rowing expedition Tušmobil TransAtlantik. He was joined by three UK rowers, Simon Osborne, Stephen Bowens and Alastair Humphreys. Marin is supporting and raising funds for Društvo KROS, a charity organization that helps with children rehabilitation after neural injuries. After his extreme expeditions, Marin ventured into entrepreneurship. In April 2013 he launched a keyring brand Hobkey, with keyrings for sea and whitewater kayakers, scuba divers and canoeists. At the end 2013 Marin and Gigodesign, an award winning design studio from Ljubljana, Slovenia, partnered to make the smallest iPhone charger on the go. After a year of work they launched Oivo, a charger that uses AA batteries to power the phone and it's small enough to fit as a keyring. Oivo was launched on Kickstarter in September 2014. In 18 days they raised more than $26,000, but the team decided to cancel the campaign due to too many mistakes made in the go-to-market phase. They tried to sell the whole product, but were unsuccessful. The project was abandoned in November 2014. In January 2015 Marin joined forces with an Australian adventurer, Huw Kingston, to become the first to row the Eastern Mediterranean from Tunisia to Turkey.They started in Hammamet stopped in Malta, Foinikounta, Monemvasia and finished 1750 kilometers and 49 days later in Çeşme.For the last two legs, Dimitris Kokkoris  joined the expedition. Due to delays by unfavorable winds, Huw had to skip the last let and end his rowing leg earlier, to continue his bigger expedition Mediterr Année."

  "text" : "Max Glass (June 12, 1881 – July 18, 1965) was an Austrian screenwriter and film producer. Glass was born in Jaroslau, which was then part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, into a Jewish family, but later converted to Catholicism. He gained a PHD in Philosophy from the University of Vienna. Glass entered the German film industry as a writer, but soon became a producer. By the mid-1920s he rose to be head of production at Terra Film before breaking away to set up his own production company in 1928 Glass' lover the actress Ruth Werner appeared in a number of his films but was unable to marry him until he had secured a divorce from his first wife. Following the Nazi takeover of power in Germany in 1933, Glass' production companies were shut down and he was forced to go into exile in France. Glass again worked as a producer, but ran into further trouble following the German invasion of France during the Second World War. In 1942 the collaborationist Vichy Government stripped him of his citizenship. Glass and Werner then went to Brazil and United States for the remainder of the conflict, only returning to France once the war was over. They finally married in 1957."

After placing second in a pre-Olympic meet in Munich, Gill competed while injured. Gill won two of India's five-ever medals at the Commonwealth Games. Political interference almost cost him the chance to compete, including a false published quote that he did not intend to compete. Prime Minister Indira Gandhi intervened to allow him to compete. Gill won one Gold Medal and one Silver in the Asian Games. He won 52 major international invitational competitions in North America and Europe, setting 19 new records in the process; in addition, he won 5 NCAA Championships all with new records. Some of those records stood 40 years later. Gill attended Cal Poly, San Luis Obispo, competing 1968-1971, winning five NCAA championships. He was elected into the Cal Poly Athletic Hall of Fame in 1993, the only Asian to receive that honor.Gill currently resides in Turlock in central California In 1970, Gill was given India's highest sports award, the Arjuna Award."

Mar-Zutra II became Exilarch of the Jewish community in Babylon at the age of fifteen in 483 CE, twelve years before the revolt. After King Kavadh I denied Jews the right to organize their own militia, Mar-Zutra took advantage of the confusion into which Mazdak's communistic attempts had plunged Persia and led a successful military revolt that achieved political independence for the Jews of Mahoza. The Jewish state lasted seven years until 502 CE when Kavadh finally defeated Mar-Zutra and punished him with crucifixion on the bridge of Mahoza. A son was born to him on the day of his death, who would be named Mar-Zutra III. The latter did not attain to the office of Exilarch, but returned to the Land of Israel, where he became head of the Academy of Tiberias, under the title of \"Resh Pirka\" ('Aρχιφεκίτησ), several generations of his descendants succeeding him in this office. After Mar Zutra's death his successor Mar Ahunai did not dare to appear in public for almost thirty years following Mar-Zutra's defeat and it is not known whether he ever really acted as Exilarch following Kavadh I's reign which ended in 531 CE."

He designed the reconstruction of the church of San Giovanni Nuovo (San Zaninovo), built 1751-1762. He boasted that this church was the Redentore redento (redeemed Redeemer) because it corrected the errors Lucchesi found in Palladio's church of Il Redentore. San Zaninovo's facade was never completed. Lucchesi also helped in reconstruction at the Ospedaletto. He also published works about artistic methods.

  "text" : "Margarete [Margarethe Elisabeth Sylva] Schlegel (1899–1987) was a German theatre/film actress and soprano operetta singer active in Germany between 1919-1933 and on British radio between 1935-1955. The sixth of seven children and the third of four girls, she was born at 11.45pm on 31 December 1899 in Bromberg, West Prussia, Germany, (now Bydgoszcz, Poland) to a German-speaking Prussian-Polish Catholic family. Her father was Augustin Heinrich Schlegel (1865-1934), who legally changed the family surname from Wisniewski upon relocating them to Berlin in 1904, while her mother was Anna Agatha Schlegel née Garski (1864-1940). Naturally beautiful and talented (she could sing, dance and act very well from an early age), Margarete Schlegel sought a chorus role in theatre in 1917 as a way of earning extra money for her family while still a schoolgirl due to the privations of war. This soon led to a starring role in Charley's Aunt at the Thalia Theatre and later both serious and comic roles at the Deutsche Theater in Berlin, where she was trained and mentored by theatre director Max Reinhardt. After the Great War she was frequently cast in Weimar silent films by the pioneering cinema directors F. W. Murnau and E. A. Dupont and in whose films she worked with noted actors Bela Lugosi and Conrad Veidt, all of whom later left for Hollywood along with writer and director Billy Wilder, who co-wrote the screenplay of her last German film, a romantic operetta comedy called Das Blaue vom Himmel. The film was released in December 1932 just prior to Hitler's ascent to power and therefore not subject to Nazi dictates. Her best known and penultimate film was Phil Jutzi's morality play Berlin-Alexanderplatz (1931) which was remade as a German TV miniseries by Rainer Werner Fassbinder in 1980. In all, she appeared in 35 silent films and three sound films of differing styles during the Weimar era. During the 1920s she continued to star in theatre roles and operettas, such as Franz Lehár's Merry Widow and Gypsy Love. Her soprano repertoire included arias and lieder by Offenbach, Puccini, Handel, Brahms, Richard Strauss and Johann Strauss (see listing below), which she performed in recitals and radio broadcasts in addition to the musical numbers she sang in sound feature films. In 1924 Margarete Schlegel married the assimilated Jewish-Prussian political economist, Prof Hermann Joachim Levy. In 1926 they had a son, Hermann Martin Heinrich Levy, who was baptised Catholic. When her husband was dismissed from his professorship at Technical University of Berlin in May 1933 and his academic books and novels written under the pseudonym Hermann Lint were burned by the Nazis, he travelled to Britain to give the Sidney Ball Memorial Lecture at Oxford University and as a Visiting Professor at King's College, Cambridge at the invitation of the Professor of Economic History, John Clapham. Although Ms Schlegel was offered many opportunities to join her Weimar expatriate film colleagues in Hollywood from the late 1920s onwards, she declined these offers to emigrate to the USA. In 1935 she was offered the chance by SS Head Heinrich Himmler to continue her film career under the Third Reich on the condition that as an Aryan she divorced her assimilated Jewish husband (he was baptised as a Lutheran at the age of 14 in 1895 under the oversight of his older sister's husband, the research chemist Prof Arnold Carl Reissert), but instead fled with her son to join her husband in Britain. In consequence, in July 1938 the Nazis officially proscribed her films, which could no longer be shown publicly in Germany or its occupied territories. At about the same time, her husband was added to Hitler's so-called Black Book, the death list of opponents of the Third Reich who would be arrested upon the anticipated Nazi occupation of Britain after Operation Sea Lion. Also in 1938 her husband's former family residence and marital home in Tiergarten, \"Villa Kabrun\", was seized by the Nazis for use as the foreign embassy of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia in the putative \"world capital\", Germania. After arriving in England, she became a featured soprano on BBC Radio in operas and operettas by Offenbach, Lehar and Horton in the late 1930s. During WW2 she broadcast anti-Nazi German-language propaganda radio programs for BBC Europe which were heard across the Continent. After her husband died suddenly in 1949 from a heart attack, she remarried and moved to Saltdean on the Sussex coast in England. In the 1950s she continued broadcasting for BBC Radio, singing in operettas and recitals such as \"The Queen of Song\" about the life of Adelina Patti. She also sang and spoke in German language educational radio programs for the BBC from 1938 onwards. She died on 15 July 1987 after being very active in local Catholic church affairs for many years."

At the state meet in 1975, Roberson set a national high school record of 13.2 s in the 120 hurdles plus recording the outstanding times of 9.4 s for the 100 y and 21.1 s for the 220 y. Also in 1975, Robertson clocked a high-school record for the 100 y at 9.2 s and equalled the then records for the 120 y hurdles (his new record was pending) and 220 y. Roberson was a key member of the Florida State track team during his years there, 1976-1980, setting college indoor and outdoor records in the 60, 100, and 200 m, and Metro Conference records in the 100 and 200 m. His greatest triumph was winning the 1980 NCAA (United States college) title at 200 m. Roberson also triumphed on the international stage by winning gold in the 100 m at the 1979 World University Games and as part of the winning United States 4 × 100 m relay team at the 1979 Pan American Games. His triumphs as a high-school and college athlete in Florida were honoured by having a track meet named after him - the Mike Roberson Invitational. The meet was started by the former coach of his old high school, Winter Park, Bob Mosher. In 1985, he was inducted into the Florida State University Hall of Fame. In 1989, he was inducted into the Central Florida Sports Hall of Fame. In 2010, he was inducted into the Winter Park Sports Hall of Fame."

Yoshiari was a son of Emperor Montoku, although he was granted the surname Minamoto which removed him from the Imperial lineage. He was a successful courtier, being appointed as a court consultant at the age of 28 and rising to the post of middle counsellor by 883. He held various positions at court including Grand Counsellor in 891, General of the Left in 893, mentor to Crown Prince Atsuhito and Inspector of Mutsu and Dewa. In 891 he was appointed Grand Counsellor. At the behest of Emperor Uda, he was assigned to the work of compiling a National History covering the period from the reign of Emperor Seiwa to that of Emperor Koko. This was an unusual appointment, in that custom dictated a member of the Fujiwara clan should have held the post of Chief compiler; it is thought that this was an attempt by Emperor Uda to undermine the increasingly influential Fujiwara. Ordered by Emperor Uda to develop a style of mounted archery, Yoshiaki created what was to later become the Takeda school of yabusame."

  "text" : "Molinier was the stage name of François Gély (1807–1859), a French operatic baritone who mostly performed minor roles at the Paris Opéra. He made his professional debut without much success on 15 February 1826 with the Opéra-Comique at the Salle Feydeau as Alibour in Méhul's Euphrosine et Coradin. He first appeared at the Paris Opéra on 2 October 1837 as an emergency replacement in a leading bass role, Pietro in Daniel Auber's La muette de Portici. He sang with great emotion, but was thought to have overextended his resources. However, having rescued the performance (and the receipts), he was rewarded by engagement as a company regular, and continued to sing there until 1854. During this period he created a number of minor roles, as noted in the list below. He also performed other minor roles, such as a herald-in-arms in Meyerbeer's Robert le diable, the Comte de Nevers in Meyerbeer's Les Huguenots, Rodolphe and Melcthal in Rossini's Guillaume Tell, and Pharaon in Rossini's Moïse."

Today, KIPP is a network of 125 high-performing public schools around the nation serving more than 41,000 students. Mike Feinberg and Dave Levin earned many awards, such as the 2006 S. Roger Horchow Award (Jefferson Award) for Greatest Public Service by a Private Citizen, an Honorary Degree from Yale University, the Thomas Fordham Foundation Price for Valor, the Charles Bronfman Prize, and the Presidential Citizen’s medal. Feinberg and Levin’s efforts became the story told by Jay Mathews, in his best-selling book, Work hard. Be nice: How Two Inspired Teachers Created America’s Most Promising Schools. KIPP has also inspired Paul Tough to write How Children Succeed: Grit, Curiosity, and the Hidden Power of Character."

  "text" : "Mami Kataoka is an art curator and writer. She received a BA from Aichi University of Education in 1988. Since 2003, Kataoka has been the Chief Curator of the Mori Art Museum, Tokyo, Japan. The Mori Art Museum is a contemporary art museum in Roppongi Hills in Tokyo. During her tenure at the Mori Art Museum, Kataoka has curated a number of exhibitions, including: “Ai Weiwei: According to What?” (2009), which is touring in the United States from 2012 onwards, and “Lee Bul: From Me, Belongs to You Only” (2012), the first large-scale solo exhibition of Asia's leading female artist. In addition to overseeing the activities of the curatorial department at the Mori, she has curated diverse exhibitions such as \"Roppongi Crossing: New Visions in Contemporary Japanese Art 2004\", which provided an overview of the recent art scene in Japan; \"Ozawa Tsuyoshi: Answer with Yes and No!\" (2004), which was the first in a series to introduce mid-career Asian artists with solo exhibitions; co-curated \"Follow Me!: Chinese Art at the Threshold of the New Millennium\" (2005), which showed the museum's strong focus on Asian contemporary art; and \"MAM Projects\", which sought to encourage young and upcoming artists internationally. She curated the first three MAM Projects: 001: Santiago Cucullu (2004), 002: Jun Nguyen-Hatsushiba (2004) and 003: R.O.R (Revolutions on Request), a group from Finland. She has also worked on \"Hiroshi Sugimoto: End of Time \"(2005) in collaboration with the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden in Washington D.C. and \"Tokyo-Berlin / Berlin-Tokyo\" (2006) in collaboration with the Neue Nationalgalerie in Berlin. Prior to the Mori, Kataoka was chief curator of the Tokyo Opera City Art Gallery, where she worked from the start of the project to create the gallery, from 1992 until 2002, three years after its opening in 1999. There she curated \"Releasing Senses\" (inaugural exhibition in 1999), \"Tatsuo Miyajima: Mega Death\" (2000), \"Encounter\" (2001), \"Rirkrit Tiravanija\" (2002) and collaborated on projects including \"Territory: Contemporary art from the Netherlands\" (2000), \"My home is yours, your home is mine\" (2001), \"JAM: Tokyo-London\" (2001), \"Under Construction: New Dimensions in Asian Contemporary Art\" (2002), among others. From 2007-2009, Kataoka joined the curatorial team at the Hayward Gallery, London as the esteemed gallery's first international curator. Here she curated “Laughing in a Foreign Language” (2008) an exhibition exploring a role of humour in diverse cultures. Kataoka is a key figure in documenting and analyzing trends within contemporary Japanese art since 2000, considering relevant social historical and generational themes evident in contemporary Japanese art. She most recently guest curated “Phantoms of Asia: Contemporary Awakens the Past” (2012) at the Asian Art Museum of San Francisco. Kataoka was a Co-Artistic Director of ROUNDTABLE: The 9th Gwangju Biennale (Korea, 2012). Recognizing the temporary and circulatory nature of biennales, which by definition reflect shifting curatorial themes and structures in rotation, Kataoka's work as part of the ROUNDTABLE curatorial team confronted the diverse inter-connectivities of different contexts within which we can find our own temporal positioning."

Before the National Museum of the American Indian was built on the site in 1999, the Smithsonian Institution conducted an archeological excavation of the foundations and garbage dump of the house. The expensive tableware in the garbage dump was made of ironstone and porcelain. Food remnants include meat, fowl, fish, and exotic fruits like coconuts and berries. French champagne corks were especially numerous.She built a three-story house on the site which rose greatly in value.Her business was apparently very successful and she died with a net worth of $87,000 - worth over $2,000,000 in 2005 dollars. In 1864 the Union Army's Provost Marshal published a list of brothels in Washington and Mary Ann Hall's had 18 \"inmates,\" making it the largest in the city. She was buried with her sister and other family members under \"large and dignified\" memorials at the Congressional Cemetery in Washington, D.C."

  "text" : "Maria Fein (7 April 1892 – 5 September 1965), was a Jewish-Catholic actress from Vienna who became a star of German theatre and film before the rise of Adolf Hitler forced her departure. During her time in Germany she was largely associated with the theatrical producer/director Max Reinhardt and had acted in plays by such writers as Christian Friedrich Hebbel, Friedrich Schiller, William Shakespeare, Aeschylus and Ferdinand Bruckner. Between 1916 and 1932 Fein appeared in at least twenty-three German films working with pioneer movie directors Robert Wiene, Uwe Jens Krafft, Hanna Henning, Rochus Gliese, Walter Schmidthässle, Frederic Zelnik, Albert Lastmann, Paul Leni, Rudolf Walther-Fein, Michael Curtiz, Rudolf Meinert and Fritz Friedmann-Frederich. Following the Nazi annexation of Austria in 1938, Fein fled to the Netherlands and in 1941 found refuge for the duration of the war in Switzerland. Fein remained active on stage over the balance of her life in her adopted Switzerland and abroad until shortly before her death."

  "text" : "Morris Kurtzon (born 1875 in Lithuania) was the president and founder of Mount Sinai Hospital of Chicago from its inception in 1919 until 1945. Mount Sinai was a hospital founded to help the disadvantaged eastern European Jews of Chicago. Kurtzon sought to provide the West Side community in Chicago a hospital where Jewish doctors could practice without prejudicial practices excluding them. Kurtzon bought the bankrupt Maimonides Hospital, reorganizing it under the name Mt. Sinai Hospital Association. He refused an offer to sell the property to the University of Illinois, preferring to donate it to the entire community. The community responded to this gesture with an effort to create financial support for the new hospital. Although women had not traditionally been allowed to fully participate in many communities, Mt. Sinai included many women among its supporters. Kurtzon devoted much of his time to planning and designing the facility. The final hospital plans were done by architects Schmidt, Garden and Ericksen. Kurtzon was vice president of the Chicago Platers Union in 1890 and founded Garden City Plating & Manufacturing (GARCY) in 1898. GARCY designed custom equipment for the new hospital, much of it made of stainless steel. GARCY became Morris Kurtzon, Inc. after 1948 and then Kurtzon Lighting, which is still owned and operated by family members."

  "text" : "Meyer R. Bimberg (died March 25, 1908) was a successful seller of campaign buttons and a theatre builder. Known as \"Bim the Button Man\" after the 1896 Republican National Convention, he made his fortune selling campaign buttons and built five theatres: West End Theatre (New York), the Yorkville Theatre in Harlem, New York, the Colonial Theatre (New York), the Astor Theatre and the Stuyvestant Theatre (which later became known as the Belasco Theatre). He was found dead in his bed at the Zenobia building after a bout of tonsilitis. The New York Times compared his theatre building, though short-lived, to Oscar Hammerstein I's. A heavyset redhead, Bim used personal connections to help prognosticate the outcome of elections. His brother Edward Bimberg was the proprietor of the Palm Garden on 52nd Street after a career on the vaudeville stage."

  "text" : "Maria Mercedes Reinares y Arrastia-Tuason also known as Mercedes Tuason (born September 27, 1930) in Lubao, Pampanga, is a Philippine diplomat and ambassador to the Holy See. An alumnus of Saint Scholastica's Catholic college in Manila, Tuason has served in the field of nutritional sciences and was appointed plenipotentiary to the Holy See in 2009. In the Philippines, Tuason is particularly known as an advocate of the Holy Rosary devotion and her roles in many charitable organizations, namely the Red Cross foundation. In May 2003 Pope John Paul II awarded Tuason the Magistral dame of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta. In May 23, 2012, Pope Benedict XVI awarded Tuason the Grand Cross of Merit for the title Order of Pius IX due to her charitable works and diplomatic service to the Roman Catholic Church, a coveted title that was not granted to ladies until November 1993. Currently, the Order of Pius IX is the third to the highest ranking order granted by the Pope through chivalry, the highest being the Supreme Order of Christ. Tuason is also known for her pro-life activism and cooperation with the Archdiocese of Manila in challenging the legalization of abortion through the Reproductive Health Bill. Tuason has fluency in writing and speaking in Tagalog, English, Spanish and Italian language and has partial fluency in the Hokkien dialect."

  "text" : "Morrison Isaac Swift (1856–1946) was an American social theorist, organizer and activist. A prolific writer, speaker and pamphleteer, he wrote a number of books on social and political theory and several works of fiction. Regarded by some as an anarchist and by others as a liberal, Swift was an outspoken anti-imperialist, anti-capitalist and a tireless promoter of socialism and public ownership. He was anti-slavery and oppression, an advocate of social justice for the unemployed and the working poor and a champion of freedom for the individual. Swift was described in a political magazine in 1894 as \"quiet in bearing, & possessed of a certain personal charm, winning in his manner before a conversational group, & very able before a promiscuous crowd. He is well educated, has traveled, & has dwelt much upon economic ills & their cures. He is a socialist of the extreme type. He advocates peaceful methods, but would not hesitate at radical measures provided they promised success.\" His obituary noted that he was \"a person of unusual gentleness, humility and charm and beloved by all who knew him.\" William James, quoting Swift in a lecture at the Lowell Institute in Boston in 1906, called him, \"that valiant anarchistic writer.\" He was also regarded as \"One of the most violent & prolific anti-imperialists.\""

  "text" : "On May 26, 2012, a naked male assailant named Rudy Eugene attacked and gruesomely maimed homeless man Ronald Poppo underneath a tram bridge crossing the MacArthur Causeway in Miami, Florida, making headlines across the world. During the 18-minute filmed encounter Eugene erroneously and erratically accused Poppo of stealing his Bible, then beat him unconscious, removed Poppo's pants, and bit and chewed the flesh off most of his face above the beard (including his left eye). This rendered Poppo permanently blind in both eyes and grossly disfigured his face. Due to the incident's bizarrely grotesque nature and subsequent worldwide media coverage, Eugene came to be dubbed the \"Miami Zombie\" and the \"Causeway Cannibal\". The attack ended when Eugene was fatally shot by a Miami PD officer after failing to respond to commands instructing him to stop (he reportedly even snarled at police). Although friends and family interviewed immediately afterward filled in details of Eugene's life, the reason for the attack remains unclear due to Eugene's death. Eugene, 31, was employed at a car wash at the time and was a divorced former high school football player with a series of petty criminal arrests from age 16 until most recently in 2009. Poppo, 65, a graduate of Manhattan's prestigious Stuyvesant High School, was homeless and had long been presumed dead by his estranged family. While police sources speculated that the use of a legal recreational synthetic stimulant party drug such as \"bath salts\" (which have a notorious reputation for the psychotic effects of the drug on some individuals) might have been a contributing factor, experts expressed doubt about this hypothesis, since toxicology reports were only able to identify cannabis/marijuana in Eugene's system, leaving the ultimate cause of his behavior unknown."

  "text" : "Manfred Noa (1893–1930) was a German film director. Noa was described by Vilma Bánky, who he directed twice, as her \"favourite director\". Noa's 1924 film Helena has been called his \"masterpiece\" although it was so expensive that it seriously damaged the finances of Bavaria Film. Noa is perhaps best known today for his 1922 film Nathan the Wise, an adaptation of Gotthold Ephraim Lessing's 1779 play of the same title, which made a plea for religious tolerance. He was the third husband of the actress Eva May, who was the daughter of his fellow director Joe May. Noa died 5 December 1930 in Berlin of peritonitis."

Following Kemal Atatürk’s establishment of Ankara as the new capital of the Turkish Republic, a new university was organized in this city. Melahat Senger moved to the new capital to attend law school (Ankara Üniversitesi Hukuk Fakültesi) from 1925–1929 and finished her studies as the first female graduate of this new school with high honors. In 1938, she married Asım Ruacan, a colleague in law, and had one son with him. She worked as a judge throughout Turkey, and in 1945, she was appointed to the Turkish Appellant Court (Yargıtay) as its first woman member. She decided many crucial cases. During the politically turbulent years of the Democratic Party (Demokrat Parti) administration (1950–1960) in Turkey, she was forced to retire from her post because of her steadfast refusal to bend the principles of law to serve the political party in power. She successfully challenged her forced retirement in court, and was reinstated to the appellant bench in 1963 with full honors and compensation. Judge Ruacan was a fearless advocate of the principles of the law and was also an untiring defender of women’s rights following Atatürk’s Kemalist ideology for the Turkish Republic all her life. She died of a heart attack in Ankara, Turkey, in 1974."

  "text" : "Michael III of Anchialus (Greek: Μιχαὴλ Γ´) was Patriarch of Constantinople from January 1170 to March 1178. Michael was appointed patriarch by the Byzantine emperor Manuel I Komnenos, culminating what had been a highly distinguished intellectual and administrative career. Before becoming Patriarch, Michael III had held a progression of important church administrative offices, including referendarios, epi tou sakelliou, and protekdikos, the last of which was in charge of the tribunal which adjudicated claims for asylum within the Great Church. The most important of his appointments before receiving the Patriarchal throne was the office of hýpatos tōn philosóphōn (ὕπατος τῶν φιλοσόφων, \"chief of the philosophers\"), a title given to the head of the imperial University of Constantinople in the 11th–14th centuries. In this role he condemned the neoplatonist philosophers, and encouraged study of Aristotle's work on the natural sciences as an antidote. As Patriarch, Michael III continued to deal with the theological issue of the relation between the Son and the Father in the Holy Trinity. The issue was created due to the explanation that one Demetrius of Lampi (in Phrygia) gave to the phrase of the Gospel of John «ὁ Πατήρ μου μείζων μου ἐστίν», which means my Father is bigger than me (John, XIV.29). Michael acted as the Emperor's chief spokesman on this issue. Michael also ordered a review of Eastern Orthodox ecclesiastical and imperial laws and decrees by Theodore Balsamon known as the \"Scholia\" (Greek: Σχόλια) (c. 1170). Michael's patriarchy was marked by the Emperor Manuel's attempts to forge a union with the Catholic Church. Continuing a longstanding papal policy, Alexander III demanded recognition of their religious authority over all Christians everywhere, and wished themselves to reach superiority over the Byzantine Emperor; they were not at all willing to fall into a state of dependence from one emperor to the other. Manuel, on the other side, wanted an official recognition of his secular authority over both East and West. Such conditions would not be accepted by either side. Even if a pro-western Emperor such as Manuel agreed to it, the Greek citizens of the Empire would have rejected outright any union of this sort, as they did almost three hundred years later when the Orthodox and Catholic churches were briefly united under the Pope. In existing correspondence Michael presents a deeply courteous but unbending position on the authority of his Church. The correspondence also show a good working relationship with the Emperor. Some of Michael III's correspondence with Manuel I survive, as does his inaugural address as hýpatos. Other documents including correspondence with Pope Alexander III have been attributed to him, though they are more likely later apocryphal creations of the 13th century. Michael III can also take credit for acting as patron to the young Michael Choniates, who composed an encomium in his honour, still extant."

  "text" : "Sister Mary Xavier Molony, P.B.V.M. (August 1781 - October 1865) was an Irish Presentation Sister who was the first nun to establish Catholic schools in Newfoundland. Baptised Belinda Molony to Francis and Catherine Maloney of Tulla, County Clare, she took the name Mary Xavier upon taking her vows as a Presentation Sister at Galway in 1825. In August 1833 Molony, Mother Mary Bernard Kirwan and two other sisters left Galway for Newfoundland to found a school for orphan girls, at the suggestion of Bishop Michael Anthony Fleming. They arrived at St. John's on 21 September but as no word of their arrival reached their sister back in Galway for another four months, they were thought to be lost at sea, with the result that Solemn Requiem Mass was had for them, and the original copies of their vows were burned. According to the Dictionary of Canadian Biography: Within a few weeks of their arrival the sisters had gathered and divided into classes girls of poor families in the settlement. They began teaching in a room at the rear of an old tavern, the “Rising Sun.” The curriculum included grammar, literature, arithmetic, French, music, needle work, and Christian doctrine. Attendance at the convent school rose from 450 in 1833 to 1,200 by 1844. Later boys and adults were also taught in the school. There were several moves before a new convent was built in December 1844, but the St John’s fire of 9 June 1846 reduced it to ashes. The sisters, who numbered eight in 1846, moved to Bishop Fleming’s farm on the outskirts of the city until Bishop John Thomas Mullock arranged for the construction of a new convent on Cathedral Square in 1850. The group were noted as the first nuns in Newfoundland. In 1853 Molony was made the first superior of the convent of Harbour Main, opening on 9 July 1853 and attended by one hundred and eighty children. However, she became ill within three years and had to return to the mother house in St. John's where she died, aged 84."

  "text" : "Marcus Vinícius da Silva Bernardo, best known by his nickname Marcus Baby, is a Brazilian \"plastic artist.\" In the 1990s he decided to create his own sculptures using child dolls and action figures (such as Barbie) as a base. In November 2005, he started creating dolls in the likeness of celebrities. These dolls, which are not for sale, are displayed on his website. The first doll to attract media attention was a wheelchair doll, inspired by a character from Viver a Vida, a well-known Brazilian telenovela. He also made news when he refused to sell a doll he had created in the likeness of Hebe Camargo. His doll of Dilma Rousseff, the President of Brazil, was released right after her January 2011 inauguration. Affectionately dubbed \"Barbie Dilma,\" it has become the best-known of his dolls."

  "text" : "Mary Vincent Conway, Sister of Charity and educator, c.18 June 1815 – 27 May 1892. Baptised Honoria, she was the daughter of Michael Conway and Eleanor McCarthy, her father serving with the militia during the Napoleonic Wars. She was born at Dover Castle, England. The family, of modest means, resettled in Ballinasloe, County Galway, where Honoria and her two siblings were taught in a private Catholic school. Two of her maternal uncles, James and Charles McCarthy, settled in Digby County, Nova Scotia. In 1831 Margaret Conway, Honoria's elder sister, married widower Hugh Donnelly of Athlone, a wool draper. In 1833 he went to Saint John where he became successful enough in business that he brought out his family in 1837, Honoria and her widowed mother being part of the household. Due to a reversal in business, Donnelly retired in 1838 and relocated to Nova Scotia. Honoria and her mother resided at Salmon river, near Meteghan, with Charles McCarthy, where Mrs. Conway died in 1845. The Donnelly's moved to Rhode Island in 1848. It is thought that during these years \"she became involved in the efforts of Catholic charitable groups to address the needs of an expanding Irish population.\" In 1854 she took vows as a Sister of Charity in New York, taking the name Mary Vincent. She was one of four volunteers who travelled to Saint John - under the direction of Bishop Thomas Louis Connolly - and was appointed mother general. The Dictionary of Canadian Biography states: Recruits to the new community came gradually and steadily during the first years. They were largely of Irish descent. Honoria Conway, now Mother Mary Vincent, had the pivotal and dual challenge of evolving mechanisms by which a religious could develop according to the rules while meeting the immediate need of running an orphanage and setting up schools. The rudiments of an orphanage were already in place when the sisters assumed responsibility for its operation. The establishing of the schools, however, followed the pattern the core personnel had observed in New York. Thus, in 1854 the sisters opened the first free school in Saint John for the daughters of poor Irish immigrants, and in 1858 an institute requiring fees, St Vincent’s Select School for Girls, was founded. It was hoped that the tuition-based institution would finance the free one. By 1859 there were 27 sisters operating five schools – two in Saint John, one in nearby Portland, one in Fredericton, and one in the Acadian parish of Saint-Basile-de-Madawaska, which enjoyed success even though it was conducted in English."

He was a pioneer in the development and use of biomechanical devices and modeling in major personal injury cases to explain the mechanical properties of the musculoskeletal system in relation to the physics and dynamics of collisions with cars, trains, and human beings involved in accidents. He was the lead trial attorney in “bet the company” cases for the Union Pacific Railroad, the Santa Fe Railroad, the Southern Pacific Transportation Company, Swinerton Construction Co., and the Regents of the University of California.

  "text" : "Martin O'Reilly (1829–1904) was a blind Irish piper. Although associated with east County Galway in some sources, O'Reilly was born in Galway City, living at the junction of Eyre Street and Suckeen (now St. Brendan's Avenue). At one stage he became step-father to the piper John Moore (1834–87), as he married the boy's mother when her first husband died. He also taught the piper Peter Kelly. He kept a dance hall in the Suckeen for some years before it was forcibly closed by a local priest. Francis O'Neill who published a short biography of him in 1913 wrote that \"Sightless and old and unable to make a living by other means than music, he was obliged, like many another unfortunate Irish minstrel, to take refuge in the poorhouse as his only escape from starvation.\" The intervention of the Gaelic League caused him to participate in the Feis Ceol of 1901 in Dublin, where he won first prize in the piper's competition. His performance - under the heading Large Concert Hall of the Rotunda - was described in a Dublin newspaper as follows: \"A notable incident was the playing of Mr. Martin O’Reilly, who played a selection entitled “The Battle of Aughrim,” descriptive of the advance, the trumpets of the British, the battle onslaught of the Irish soldiers, and the wail of the women. Aughrim was of course a lost field, but, nothing daunted, the gallant old piper, throbbing with a spirit that might long to play his countrymen into battle, fired them with a stirring and strident version of the victorious march of Brian Boru.\" Following this he performed at a number of concerts in various towns around Ireland, such as the Belfast Harp Festival of 1903. A photograph was taken of him by a Father Fielding in Dublin, which in 1907 became the frontispeice for O'Neill's Dance Music of Ireland. O'Reilly however ended up back in the poorhouse, in Gort, where he died in 1904."

  "text" : "Marc J. Swartz (31 October 1931 – 14 December 2011) was an American political and cultural anthropologist with areal specialization in eastern Africa. Born in Omaha, Nebraska, Swartz trained in anthropology in the interdisciplinary Department of Social Relations at Harvard, receiving his PhD in 1958. He was a founding member of the Department of Anthropology at the University of California, San Diego, where he served as a member of the faculty for 36 years. During his career, Swartz was a founding member of the Society for Cultural Anthropology, former chairman of the American Society for Political Anthropology, a life member of the American Anthropological Association, a fellow of the Royal Anthropological Institute and a member of the National Geographic Research board of editors. Swartz conducted extensive field research among indigenous peoples in highland Tanzania (the Bena), in Kenya (coastal Swahili, and on Chuuk atoll (formerly known as Truk) in the southwestern Pacific Ocean. In each case he was accompanied and assisted by his wife of 58 years, Audrey. Swartz dedicated his career to the study of the influence of culture over various aspects of human interaction, including the sources and maintenance of political power, social status, aggression, sexuality and medical beliefs. “He believed that human cultures were defined by common understandings that were shared, transmitted, prescriptive and morally forceful. He disputed the casual use of the word ‘culture’ to refer to artifacts or behaviors. To him, culture was what’s in your head,” said David K. Jordan, UC San Diego professor emeritus of anthropology and a longtime friend and colleague to Swartz. In addition to many scholarly papers, he wrote and edited a number of books, including “The Way the World Is,” “Local Level Politics,” “Political Anthropology” (with Victor Turner and Arthur Tuden) and, with David K. Jordan, “Culture, the anthropological perspective,” “Personality and the Cultural Construction of Society” and a textbook, “Anthropology: Perspective on Humanity.”"

Maurice played chess from an early age, going on to compete in over-the-board tournaments in Southampton, England during the 1960s, becoming club champion in 1969. By the 1980s, Johnson had moved into Correspondence Chess playing domestic and international tournaments, winning the British Correspondence Chess Association championship title as an outright winner for 3 consecutive years in 1989, 1990, and 1991, remaining the only player to do so since it started in 1906. This achievement saw him awarded the BCCA Millards Silver King Trophy but Johnson donated the trophy back to the British Correspondence Chess Association some time later, where it has since remained in storage. Maurice W. Johnson achieved the IM norm (International Master) in 1994 and the GM norm (Grandmaster) in 1995, whilst playing the SSKK-Bulletinen 40 Years tournament and went on to play in the World Championship 3/4 Final in 1999, achieving a personal ICCF rating of 2618 in 1998. During 1997 Johnson wrote the article \"How I became a CC grandmaster\" for the inaugural issue of the Correspondence Chess magazine Chess Mail."

  "text" : "Sir Miles Hobart (12 April 1595 – 20 June 1632) was an English politician who sat in the House of Commons from 1628 to 1629. Hobart was the son of Miles Hobart of London and was born at Plumstead. Others have him the son of Sir Henry Hobart, 1st Baronet. He matriculated at Queen's College, Oxford on 30 June 1615, aged 16 and was a student of Gray's Inn in 1616. He was knighted at Salisbury on 8 August 1623. In 1628, he was elected Member of Parliament for Marlow. In the debate of 2 March 1629 about the \"illegal imposition of Tonnage and Poundage\" he locked the door of the House of Commons, against the King's Messenger and was accordingly imprisoned in the Tower of London. He sat until 1629, when King Charles I of England decided to rule without Parliament for eleven years. Shortly after release from prison, Hobart was fatally injured in a carriage accident on Holborn Hill. Miles Hobart died on 20 June 1632, at Harleyford, and was buried at Marlow. A monument tablet with bust in the parish church was voted to him by Parliament in 1647."

  "text" : "Marianne de Pury (born 3 April 1935) is a theatre artist and composer born in St. Gallen, Switzerland. She is best known as the musical composer of two 1966 anti-war plays, Jean-Claude van Itallie's social satire America Hurrah and Megan Terry's rock musical Viet Rock. De Pury studied piano and composition at the Conservatoire de Musique de Genève. She enjoyed the performing arts from a young age and, as a teen, she made frequent trips to Paris to see theatre. Later she moved to New York City, where she studied as an apprentice under the Open Theatre's director Joseph Chaikin. There she forged connections with artists active in New York's avant-garde theatre scene as well as the Black Panther Party. In 1965 she began a collaborative project with playwright and director Megan Terry who was working on a devised performance piece for the La MaMa Experimental Theatre Club protesting the Vietnam War. Their ensemble improvisations at the Open Theatre laboratory resulted in Viet Rock, widely recognized as the first rock musical written and produced in the United States. De Pury followed the production as an accompanist when it premiered at the Yale Repertory Theatre in 1966 and later transferred to the Off-Broadway Martinique Theatre on 10 November 1966. During her time in the United States, de Pury also served as composer-in-residence for the Yale School of Drama and worked as a translator for the French playwright Jean Genet. De Pury is founder of the Santa Fe Ensemble Theatre in New Mexico and has directed free-lance productions in Basel, Bern, Bonn, Dublin, Sarajevo, Melbourne, New York and Cameroun. Upon returning to Switzerland, she became the administrative director of the Theatre de Carouge, a three-stage performing space in Geneva, Switzerland."

  "text" : "Mervyn Herbert (Merv) Thackeray (20 October 1925 – 7 June 2014) was an Australian politician. He was an Australian Labor Party member of the Legislative Assembly of Queensland from 1957 until 1972, representing Keppel (1957–1960) and Rockhampton North (1960–1972). He was disendorsed in January 1972 and ran unsuccessfully as an independent at the 1972 state election. Thackeray was born in Mackay and educated at Mackay Primary School. He had a career as a grazier and on the railways before entering politics, working variously as engine driver, fireman, engine cleaner and union delegate. He entered politics at the 1957 election immediately following the Labor split of that year, defeating Labor defector and Queensland Labor Party candidate Viv Cooper on behalf of official Labor in the seat of Keppel. His seat of Keppel was abolished in 1960, and he successfully switched to its successor seat of Rockhampton North. He was subsequently re-elected in Rockhampton North a further three times. Thackeray had a poor relationship with the party administration throughout the later part of his career. Mike Ahern claimed Thackeray had been \"on the outer with the ALP, partly because he was a left-wing meat worker and partly because he was useless.\" Ahern further claimed that Thackeray had been leaking Labor tactics to Government Whip Vince Jones.In January 1972, Thackeray, along with two other dissident MLAs, Col Bennett and Ed Casey, were disendorsed after repeated clashes with the state secretary and state executive. The three MLAs ran for re-election as independents under the banner of the \"True Labor Party\", but Thackeray and Bennett were both soundly defeated."

  "text" : "Maruti Mane (10 August 1938 – 27 July 2010) was an Indian former wrestler who competed in the 1964 Summer Olympics. Mane had a glorious run as a wrestler between 1962 and 1972 and did exceedingly well for the country in major championships. In the 1970 Commonwealth Games, he won silver in the unlimited freestyle event. In the 1962 Asian Games, he won gold in the 97 kg freestyle and the silver in the 97 kg Greco-Roman events. Mane was crowned Hind Kesari in 1964 after defeating Rajasthan wrestler Mahiruddin. He was at one time listed among the best wrestlers in the world. He was also presented with the prestigious Dhyan Chand award by the Union government. In his wrestling days, Mane used to work out for almost 10 to 12 hours daily. His fitness was said to be the reason for him lasting a good 11 minutes against the then all-conquering Russian wrestler Alexander Medved in 1967. No wrestler could last for more than a couple of minutes against the Medved, who was crowned world champion four times and won three Olympic golds in Tokyo (1964), Mexico (1968) and Munich (1972)."

Mir Jalal Khan was the ruler and founder of the First Balochi Confederacy in the 12th century. A confederacy which did not last due to political rivalries, but it laid the ground for future attempts at political integration and cohesion among the Baloches. He left four sons, Rind Khan, Lashar Khan, Hooth Khan, Korai Khan, and a daughter Mir Jato, who married his nephew Murad. These five are the eponymous founders of the five great divisions of the tribe, the Rinds, Lasharis, Hooths, Korais, and Jatois. Rind had been appointed successor to the Phagh or Royal Turban by his father and proposed to perform the ceremonies and erect an asrokh or memorial canopy. His brother and rival Hooth refused to join him, whereupon the others also refused; each performed the ceremony separately, and there were five asrokhs in Kech. Some of the Balochs joined one and some another, and so the five great tribes were formed."

He has authored several books dealing with the cultural environment in the Arab – particularly the Iraqi – world. The most prominent of his works is Khareef al-Muthaqqaf al-Iraqi (The Fall of Intellect in Iraq). This book was controversial upon publication, and received praise as well as criticism from reviewers. In 2012, Al-Akhras, a descendant of a Shiite family, launched a campaign to urge Dr. Ahmed al-Kubaisy, the notable Iraqi Sunni cleric, to return to his homeland, Iraq, subsequent to rumors of calls in the Gulf countries to deport al-Kubaisy on the grounds of his un-extremist opinions over the unrest in Iraq and the M-E region."

  "text" : "Mary Ellmann (1921–89) was an American writer and literary critic. Magazines she reviewed for included the New York Review of Books, The Nation, Encounter, The Atlantic Monthly, Commentary, The New Republic, The New Statesman and The American Scholar. Ellmann is particularly noted for her book of essays, Thinking About Women (1968), which discusses the evolution of the representation of femininity in British and American literature, exhibiting sexual analogies and stereotypes from the texts and contrasting criticism by male and female authors. The literary historian Mary Eagleton cited Ellmann's book as one of two \"significant texts\" in early feminist theory. The work has been widely cited for its introduction of the concept \"phallic criticism\" as applied to writers of both sexes. In a review of academic studies of gender, Mary Poovey described Thinking About Women as an example of the \"earliest U.S. incarnation\" of feminist literary criticism, which, \"with the excitement of pioneers discovering virgin territory... helped make writing about women academically acceptable.\" Ellmann married the literary critic Richard Ellmann in 1949. The couple had three children, Stephen, Maud, and Lucy."

Norwegian Championship: 10 Gold, 4 Silver and 2 Bronze.Nordic Championship: 4 Gold He has also participated 7 European Championships, 6 World Championships and 2 Olympic Games. His best result is probably 4th place at the World Championship in Budapest in 1986. He was also extraordinary in the Olympic games in 1988 in Seoul. He had four wins, and ended at a respectable 7th place. He has been a coach ever since. He started wrestling at the age of 13, at the Herøya Wrestlingteam, along with a friend of him. He had been doing several other sports earlier, like football and skijumping. As a fifteen-year-old boy, he realized how much wrestling fascinated him, and he decided to go for wrestling. He has now, after a long period of remarkable wrestling, become head coach for the Norwegian Wrestling Team. Besides wrestling, he spends a lot of time with his family and his other job as a Police Officer in the Skien Police Department. He hopes to continue to work with wrestling in 10 years, because wrestling will always be his passion. For Morten, it is incredibly rewarding to help the wrestlers succeed in such a tough sport."

  "text" : "Mario Giacinto Peracca (21 November 1861, Turin – 23 May 1923, Turin) was an Italian herpetologist. He discovered zoology through his father, an amateur ornithologist. He started taking medical classes at the University of Turin, with his studies eventually turning to zoology. In 1886 he obtained his degree from the university under the direction of Michele Lessona (1823-1894). After graduation, he remained in Turin as an assistant to Lessona, and later Lorenzo Camerano (1856-1917), at the zoological institute. Here he worked until his retirement in 1920. At the zoological institute, he served as curator of herpetological collections. Among the specimens at the museum were reptiles and amphibians that were produced at his estate, where he kept a large temperature-controlled vivarium with tropical plants, containing animals that included giant salamanders and Galapagos tortoises. Many of his written works dealt with herpetological collections from South America and Africa (including Madagascar), with some publications on specimens from Italy, the Middle East, China and Australia. He was the taxonomic authority of numerous reptile and amphibian species, and has several species named after him, such as Peracca's clawed frog (Xenopus clivii), Mantidactylus peraccae, Anolis peraccae, and Lepidoblepharis peraccae; the latter three species being described by his friend, George Albert Boulenger (1858-1937)."
