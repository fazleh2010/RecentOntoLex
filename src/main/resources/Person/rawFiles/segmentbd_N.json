This event was expected to be broadcast across 120 countries and was predicted to be seen by over a billion people. Choudhury’s most popular achievement is choreographing and performing in the first Bollywod act on the BBC's hugely popular dance show Strictly Come Dancing, which was seen live by over 10 million people and brought Bollywood to the show for the first time.

In 2011 he took his dance company Bolly Flex to Sky 1's Got To Dance, receiving standing ovations and gold stars  from all the critics. He then took Bolly Flex  on tour  across the UK  and Europe. They were the first Bollywood dance company to play the Royal Opera House. In 2012 he directed and produced the Dhamaka Bollywood Concert with Flex FX Production, featuring Atif Aslam performing live with Bollywood dancers Bolly Flex. 2013 Naz created Bollywood Showstopperswith Bipasha Basu, Atif Aslam, Malaika Arora Khan, Shaan and Bolly Flex which took place at The O2 Arena London and the LG Arena (Birmingham) in April 2013.

They married in 1940 despite her poor health, which began with a bout of rheumatic fever at age three and lasted her entire life. She began writing novels with her husband in 1947 with Mrs. Mike, the fictionalized story of their friend Katherine Mary Flannigan who married a Mountie and moved from Boston to the Canadian wilderness. It became a bestseller and inspired a 1950 film adaptation. The two Freedmans wrote nine more novels together, and Freedman wrote several more by herself. Her later works, including Mary, Mary Quite Contrary (1968) and Sappho: The Tenth Muse (1998) have been called \"ardently feminist.\" Freedman's son, Michael Freedman, became a noted mathematician, and her two daughters also work in academia as a musician at the University of California, Berkeley and as the director of the medical humanities program at the University of California, Irvine."

His furniture designs are comfortable and functional, but also poetic and aesthetically sophisticated. In an interview, he explained, \"the objects I have carved a soul beyond the functionality.\" Cesbron's studio is a remodeled ironworks space, at Saint Denis between Fort de Briche et le Boulevard Périphérique in Paris. He has shown his work in Barcelona, Brussels, Paris, and cities throughout Germany. A sculptural wooden staircase he created is installed in the Christian Louboutin Ginza boutique in Tokyo. He was interested in woodworking as a child, but under pressure from his parents, studied physics instead. He went on to teach at a university in the Ivory Coast in West Africa where, in his spare time, he became interested in the African art of wood-carving. Thereafter, he returned to France and earned his Ph.D. in physics at a university there while developing his own woodworking skills. Cesbron had his first major art exhibition in 1994 at the Musée de l'Orangerie in the center of Paris. It aroused a great deal of attention and after another year as a physicist at the university, he turned to art as a profession."

  "text" : "Nathaniel Whetham (1604 – 16 September 1668) was an English baker and politician who sat in the House of Commons between 1654 and 1659. He fought in the Parliamentary army in the English Civil War. Whetham was the son of Thomas Whetham and his wife Dorothy Hooper. He was baptised at Burstock on 25 November 1604. He was apprenticed in London to Edward Terrill, the baker to the Inner Temple. By 1632 he had completed his apprenticeship and was appointed steward to the court of the Worshipful Company of Bakers. He joined the \"Company of the Plough\" which had secured a patent from Sir Ferdinando Gorges on land in South-East Maine with the aim of emigrating there but the venture was unsuccessful and he continued his trade in the Company of Whitebakers. When the Civil War broke out, Whetham joined the City of London militia and was appointed major of dragoons and a captain of one of their companies under colonel Richard Browne. Whetham and his dragoons were stationed near Aylesbury where his troops were restless and an attack on the Royalist garrison at Brill was abortive. However, he was appointed Governor of Northampton and for the next four to five years he held the town on behalf of Parliament. In October 1643 he repelled an advance by Prince Rupert and his twenty-two troops of horse and 700 men and then raided Royalist troops along Watling Street by night. In April 1644 he organised the rescue of over thirty parliamentary soldiers from Banbury Castle. In August 1644 he was described as 'Commander in chiefe' and 'valliant and faithfull' in the first siege of Banbury Castle. He remained at Northampton for most of the next three years and took part in the second siege of Banbury Castle. In September 1649, Whetham was sent as Governor of Portsmouth to reinforce the port. His immediate priority was to repair the fortifications. He was also responsible for reorganising the armed forces, and setting up of a Hampshire Militia under his own command. He was also appointed a Justice of the Peace for Hampshire. In 1654, he was elected Member of Parliament for Portsmouth in the First Protectorate Parliament. At this time Whetman met and became friends with General George Monck who was based at Portsmouth and in 1655 went to Scotland with Monck as member of Monck's Council of State for Scotland. In 1656 he was elected MP for a Scottish constituency comprising the boroughs of St. Andrews, Dysart, Kirkaldy, Anstruther-East, Pittenween, Creel, Dumfermline, Kinghorn, Anstruther-West, Innerleithing, Kilkenny, and BurntIand for the Second Protectorate Parliament. He returned to Portsmouth in March 1657 wrote to the Committee of Safety saying that he had found affairs at Portsmouth very much under control. He was elected to sit on the Committee of Safety but does not appear to have attended any meetings. In 1659 he was re-elected MP for the Scottish constituency for the Third Protectorate Parliament. At this time he was caught up in the dispute between Parliament and the army when the army attempted to take Portsmouth which had been established as a parliamentary stronghold. He finished his term as governor of Portsmout in 1659. Whetham then joined General Monck who was advancing on London from the north. As a result of his contributions he was awarded a pension of £200 a year and hereditary entitlement to his lands as well as his own regiment. However, by the time of the Restoration his regiment had been handed over to Colonel Richard Norton and later King Charles II and Parliament agreed to annul the sale of church lands by which Whetham had bought the manor of Chard. He left his manorial home for a small tenancy on the estate and remained there until his death in 1668 at the age of about 64. Whetham married Joanna Terrill, widow of his former master Edward Terrill."

He was the second son of Nicholas of Seagrave, first Baron Seagrave and a leading supporter of Simon de Montfort in his struggle with King Henry III. Nicholas Seagrave was first summoned to Parliament in 1295 and continued to be summoned until his death. In 1298 he fought in the vanguard at the Battle of Falkirk. In 1300 he was present at the siege of Caerlaverock in the retinue of Henry de Bohun, 1st Earl of Hereford, and in 1301 he sealed the barons' remonstrances to the pope as 'Nicholas de Seagrave, lord of Stow'. In 1301 he became involved in a dispute with Walter Langton, bishop of Lichfield, and in the same year he and his wife Alice were accused with many others of breaking houses belonging to Ralph de Monthermer, 1st Baron Monthermer. In the Scottish campaign of 1303-4 he became involved in another dispute, and when he was refused trial by combat he deserted the army to flee to France. On his return in 1305 he was apparently sentenced to death, but soon pardoned and restored to favour by King Edward I. He was one of Edward II's strongest supporters at the start of his reign, and in 1308 he was appointed Lord Marshal. However, he was an adherent of Thomas, 2nd Earl of Lancaster, who became a leader of the opposition to the king. This made Seagrave's position at court increasingly untenable, and he was replaced in 1316. He died on 25 November 1321."

  "text" : "Nicholas Loney (1826 in Plymouth, United Kingdom – 23 April 1869 Mount Kanlaon in Negros Island, Philippines) was a British businessman and Vice Consul in the Philippines. The younger son of Admiral Robert Loney of the Royal Navy and Ann Condy, Nicholas Loney left home at 16. He first went to Latin America where he traveled extensively and learned Spanish for a few years. He then turned home to Plymouth, England but stayed only a short time before departing for Asia. He eventually ended up in Singapore where he worked for Kerr & Co., a merchant house. As the Philippines, opened to international trade, Kerr & Co. sent him to Manila where he became a popular figure among the business community. When Iloilo City was opened to international trade in 1855, he was appointed as the first British Vice Consul in Iloilo the following year in 1856. Sugar production was increasing due to growing price of sugar in Manila and Loney helped the plantation owners and farmers by providing loans and purchasing modern machinery from Europe through his firm, Loney & Ker Co., which helped increased the efficiency of sugar production in Iloilo. He also encouraged improvements in infrastructure at the port of Iloilo, reclamation of the western bank of Iloilo River and the construction of the Calle Progreso (present day Isidro de la Rama Street) which became the location of numerous sugar warehouses. He died on 23 April 1869 while exploring Mount Kanlaon on Negros Island, Philippines of an unspecified disease.He was buried by the seashore under some coconut trees in what is now Rizal Street in Iloilo City. In March 1904, the Municipal Council of Iloilo passed a resolution naming the quay along the Iloilo River, part of the Port of Iloilo, as Muelle Loney, or Loney Waterfront. In March 1981 a statue of him was unveiled at the end of Muelle Loney."

Inkster was educated at Oxford and joined SIS in 1975, for which he served in posts in Kuala Lumpur, Bangkok, Beijing, and Hong Kong. He rose to become deputy to SIS chief Richard Dearlove, and was widely assumed to be in line for the top spot when Dearlove announced his departure in 2003 . The selection of John Scarlett instead of Inkster was the subject of considerable political controversy. Inkster was a member of the SIS board for seven years. Inkster left SIS in 2006. Inkster has argued that the UK should not take in direct military action in Syria, although supporting rebel forces was sensible."

  "text" : "Neil Heywood (20 October 1970 – 14 November 2011) was an English businessman who worked in China. He was associated with Bo Xilai (the former Communist Party of China Committee Secretary for Chongqing, and a member of the Chinese Politburo). Heywood was found dead in a hotel room in Chongqing, and initial official reports (which have subsequently been challenged) attributed his death to alcohol poisoning. Media reports have suggested the former chief of police under Bo, Wang Lijun, may have had information concerning Heywood's death. Soon after Heywood's death (6 February, 2012), Wang fled to the US consulate in Chengdu, and allegedly told US diplomats of Heywood having been poisoned, and Bo's family was involved in corruption. The Wang Lijun incident precipitated Bo's high-profile sacking 2 weeks later. According to a reinvestigation by the Chinese authorities, evidence indicates Heywood having been murdered, with Gu Kailai, Bo Xilai's wife, and Zhang Xiaojun, an orderly at Bo's home, of being \"highly suspected\" in the situation,  according to Xinhua News. On 26 July 2012, Gu Kailai was charged with the murder of Neil Heywood  and in August was convicted of the crime."

  "text" : "Nikolay Fyodorovich Balboshin (Russian: Николай Фёдорович Балбошин, born 8 June 1949) is a retired Soviet heavyweight Greco-Roman wrestler. He rarely lost a bout in the 1970s, winning five world titles, six European titles, and an Olympics gold medal in 1976. At the 1976 Olympics he pinned all his five opponents, in total spending less than 17 minutes on the mat. He was the Soviet flag bearer and a clear favorite at the Moscow Olympics, but injured an Achilles tendon in the second bout and withdrew from the tournament. He recovered by 1984, when he won his last Soviet title and was selected for the 1984 Games, but could not compete because of the 1984 Summer Olympics boycott by the Soviet Union. He retired from competitions to become a wrestling coach n Moscow. In 2006 he was inducted into the FILA International Wrestling Hall of Fame. Balboshin was born in East Germany, where his father, a career military officer, was serving at the time. He is married to Nina Balboshina and has a son Nikolai (born 1973) and a daughter Yelena (born 1979). He took up wrestling when his family moved to Moscow and trained together with his elder brother Vladimir. His career was marred by injuries. In the 1960s he broke his arm at a junior wrestling competition. In 1972 he was included to the Soviet national team to compete at the 1972 European championships and Summer Olympics, but lost that season after tearing a knee tendon. He won the Soviet, European and world titles in 1973 while recovering from a shoulder injury, which also bothered him next year when he lost the European championships final to Kamen Goranov. In 1975 he won the European title, but injured a hip at the world championships and placed fourth."

The UDM was formed in 1985 after the miners' strike led to a split from the National Union of Mineworkers. With Mick Stevens (UDM general secretary), Greatrex appeared in court on 20 May 2011, accused of stealing almost £150,000 from a fund intended to help sick miners. Their trial began in March 2012. Greatrex abused his position as a trustee of the fund by paying for work on his own home. On 3 April 2012 the jury found Greatrex guilty of all 14 charges, they found Stevens not guilty. Greatrex was advised by the judge to expect a custodial sentence.He was jailed for four years. In December 2012, the Birmingham Crown Court ordered Greatrex to repay over £200,000."

  "text" : "Nets Hawk Katz is a professor of mathematics at the California Institute of Technology. He was a professor of mathematics at Indiana University Bloomington until March 2013. Katz earned a B.A. in mathematics from Rice University in 1990 at the age of 17. He received his Ph.D. in 1993 under Dennis DeTurck at the University of Pennsylvania, with a dissertation titled \"Noncommutative Determinants and Applications\". He is the author of some results in combinatorics (especially additive combinatorics), harmonic analysis and other areas. In 2003, jointly with Jean Bourgain and Terence Tao, he proved that any subset of Z/pZ grows substantially under either addition or multiplication. More precisely, if A is a set such that both A.A and A + A have cardinality at most K|A| then A has size at most K^C or at least p/K^C. This result was followed by the subsequent work of Bourgain, Sergei Konyagin and Glibichuk, establishing that every approximate field is almost a field. Somewhat earlier he was involved in establishing new bounds in connection with the dimension of Kakeya sets. Jointly with Laba and Tao he proved that the Hausdorff dimension of Kakeya sets in 3 dimensions is strictly greater than 5/2, and jointly with Tao he established new bounds in large dimensions. In 2010, Nets Katz along with Larry Guth published the results of their collaborative effort to solve the Erdős distinct distances problem, in which they found a \"near-optimal\" result, proving that a set of N points in the plane has at least cN/log N distinct distances. In early 2011, in joint work with Michael Bateman, he improved the best known bounds in the cap set problem: if A is a subset of (Z/3Z)^n of cardinality at least 3^n/n^{1 + c}, where c > 0, then A contains three elements in a line. In 2012, he was named a Guggenheim fellow. During 2011-2012, he was the managing editor of the Indiana University Mathematics Journal. In 2014 he was an invited speaker at the International Congress of Mathematicians at Seoul and gave a talk The flecnode polynomial: a central object in incidence geometry. In 2015 he received the Clay Research Award."

  "text" : "Nikolaus Decius (also Degius, Deeg, Tech a Curia, and Nickel von Hof; c. 1485 – 21 March 1541 (others say 1546) was a German monk, hymn-writer and composer. He was probably born in Hof in Upper Franconia, Bavaria, around 1485. He studied at the University of Leipzig and obtained a master's degree at Wittenburg University in 1523 and became a monk. Although a monk, he was an advocate of the Protestant Reformation and a disciple of Martin Luther. He was Probst of the cloister at Steterburg from 1519 until July 1522 when he was appointed a master in the St. Katherine and Egidien School in Braunschweig. He wrote in 1523 for Allein Gott in der Höh sei Ehr, adapted by Luther in 1525, a German paraphrase of the Latin Gloria. Decius's version was first sung on Easter Day at Braunschweig on 5 April 1523. Decius's Low German version first appeared in print in Gesang Buch by Joachim Sluter, printed in 1525. In 1526, Decius became preacher at the Church of St. Nicholas in Stettin at the same time as Paulus von Rhode was appointed preacher at St. James's in Stettin. In 1535 he became pastor of St. Nicholas and died there in March 1541 after a suspected poisoning. Shortly before his death he wrote the hymn \"O Lamm Gottes, unschuldig\" (O Lamb of God, innocent) sung on a tune from the 13th century. Decius's version was first published in Anton Cornivus's Christliche Kirchen-Ordnung in 1542. Johann Sebastian Bach used it as a cantus firmus in the opening chorus of his St Matthew Passion. It was translated into English by Arthur Tozer Russell in the 19th century."

This marked his first time playing drums live in 28 years. In 1993 Turner entered into a joint venture with I.R.S. Records, heading the new Shock Therapy label. Turner has been a technology innovator since late 1994 when he produced the first ever live video concert broadcast with a major label band on the Internet  and organized the first video 'fan' conference with members of the classic rock band, The Doors. He launched Rocktropolis in early '95, one of the web's earliest music websites, 'rock n roll's first virtual city,' that received significant media attention. In the late '90s he became a vice president at N2K. Turner's drumsticks were featured for 8 years in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, one of the largest drumstick collections in the world."

  "text" : "Nicolae Militaru (November 10, 1925 – December 27, 1996) was a Romanian general who served as Defense Minister between December 1989 and February 1990. A graduate of the M. V. Frunze Military Academy in Moscow, he commanded the Romanian Land Forces' 2nd Army from 1969 to 1978. That year, under suspicion for being a GRU agent and for plotting against dictator Nicolae Ceauşescu, he was retired from active duty and made an assistant to the Defense Minister. A Securitate plot to depose Ceauşescu existed in the early 1980s, and he is known to have joined in 1984, adding an Army dimension. On December 24, 1989, during the Romanian Revolution, Militaru was already in charge of the Defense Ministry when a contested incident took place. According to a narrative put forward by former Securitate agents, he lured USLA military counterintelligence agents into an ambush and ensured the group was headed by Colonel Gheorghe Trosca and Major Eugen Cotuna since they had compromising information on Militaru's alleged GRU ties; the pair ended up killed. However, during 1990, army officers in the military's own press cast doubt on a story that was widely reported in civilian newspapers, alleging it was a Securitate diversion effectively spread by agents who had infiltrated the regular press. On December 26, in the Revolution's immediate aftermath, the new leader, Ion Iliescu, formally named him Defense Minister. As minister, Militaru recalled to active duty some thirty officers, most of whom had received active training in the Soviet Union. Other officers became increasingly uneasy and a pro-reform group, Comitetul de Acţiune pentru Democratizarea Armatei (CADA, Action Committee for the Democratization of the Army) emerged on February 12, 1990. The following day over a thousand soldiers and officers assembled in Bucharest, and Militaru was dismissed on February 16, replaced by General Victor Stănculescu. He ran in the 1996 presidential election, winning 0.22% of the vote. He died of cancer the next month on December 27, 1996."

Although Santino's pit bull Rocco was grandfathered in, several restrictions were imposed on Rocco's behavior, and Santino complained about dog-related harassment from other tenants and from building staff. On January 24, 2012, Santino had Rocco euthanized, citing changes in Rocco's behavior which he attributed to the harassment and restrictions. Several hours later, Santino committed suicide; his suicide note explained that he felt he had betrayed Rocco (whom he had originally rescued from an animal shelter).

  "text" : "Nicholas Amer, born Thomas Harold Amer (born 29 September 1923) in Tranmere, Birkenhead, Cheshire, is an English stage, film and television actor known for his performances in William Shakespeare's plays. Amer made his professional debut in 1948 playing the part of Ferdinand in The Tempest. In his long career, Amer has played more than 27 different Shakespearean roles and toured to 31 different countries. Amer served for five years during World War II in the Royal Navy as a wireless operator aboard Motor Torpedo Boats, first in North Africa, then in the Allied invasion of Sicily, where he was wounded in action. Following demobilisation in 1945, he studied at the Webber Douglas School of Singing and Dramatic Art in London for two years, winning the Webber Cup in his final year. He adopted the stage name Nicholas Amer and joined the Liverpool Playhouse under John Fernald. Together with Harold Lang, in 1963 he formed Voyage Theatre as a vehicle for performing Shakespeare's plays overseas. Amer's many roles include those of Romeo, Laertes (three times), Hamlet, Ferdinand (three times), Andrew Aguecheek, Donalbain and, as he got older, Julius Caesar, Macbeth and Macduff. In the 1980s he toured the USA playing King Duncan in an Old Vic production of Macbeth. His London stage appearances include A Man for All Seasons with Charlton Heston, Captain Brassbound's Conversion with Penelope Keith and The Wolf with Judi Dench and Leo McKern. Amer's first film part was as a 'pot boy' in The Mudlark (1950) with Alec Guinness and Irene Dunne. Other film appearances include Chapuys in Henry VIII and His Six Wives (1972), Al-risâlah (The Message) (1976) starring Anthony Quinn, Admiral Nelson in Nelson's Touch (1979), The Prince and the Pauper with Rex Harrison, Mallarmé in Gauguin the Savage (1980), Peter Greenaway's The Draughtsman's Contract (1982) with Anthony Higgins and Janet Suzman, Chapuys again in A Man for All Seasons (1988), Ben Gunn in a re-make of Treasure Island (1990) with Charlton Heston, The Whipping Boy (1994), The Deep Blue Sea (2011) with Rachel Weisz and Tom Hiddleston, The Awakening (2011) with Rebecca Hall, and his most recent film, a short, Heroes Return (2012) for Camelot, playing the World War II veteran Private Jack Jennings, filmed on location in the Burmese jungle on the border with Thailand. His many TV credits, starting in the early 1950s, include Hamlet (1961), The Avengers (1963), I, Claudius (1976), The Professionals (1979), If Tomorrow Comes (1986), Fortunes of War (1987), Jonathan Creek (1999), ChuckleVision (2004), Midsomer Murders (2005) and Borgia (2011). He also wrote numerous ballet and opera reviews for The Stage under his own name and under the pseudonym 'Kenneth Smart' and appeared in numerous TV commercials."

She won the 1987 Rotterdam Marathon in a time of 2:41:24 hours, then won her first Belgian marathon title two months later. In September she broke the Belgian record with a winning run of 2:33:33 hours at the Brussels Marathon. She was invited to November's New York City Marathon and came tenth in a time of 2:38:18 hours. Her second marathon season came in 1989. Aerts began the year with a Belgian record of 1:11:32 hours in the half marathon – a time that won her the women's race at the City-Pier-City Half Marathon. This record stood for five years, until it was beaten by Marleen Renders in 1994. She was third at the Paris Marathon in a near-personal best time of 2:33:58 hours and won a second title in Brussels, which was also the national championship race that year. Her last marathon outing that year was the Carpi Marathon in October and she again reached the podium, taking third place. Aerts made three international appearances for Belgium: she was seventeenth in the marathon at the 1990 European Athletics Championships and competed at the IAAF World Cross Country Championships in 1989 and 1990."

He was the father of physician Hans Olof Ahnlund, literary scientist Knut Ahnlund and the grandfather of journalist and writer Nathan Shachar. Nils Ahnlund was born in Uppsala as the eldest son of theologian Olof Ahnlund and Hilda Svensson. In 1893 his father was appointed vicar in Umeå, and that is where Nils finished his secondary education. Thereafter he enrolled at Uppsala University, where he quickly became a disciple of Harald Hjärne. His research mainly focused on the time of Swedish Empire, and his dissertation was on Gustavus Adolphus. Between 1926 and 1926 he worked at Svenska Dagbladet, where he had a promising career ahead of him. However, he chose the academic path and became the first professor of history at Stockholm University College in 1928. During World War II, he participated in the public debate, exhibiting nationalist sentiments. Ahnlund was a popularizer of history and became widely known for his contributions in newspapers and radio, but in academia he was also successful and became, among other things, a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Letters, History and Antiquities as early as 1934 and the Swedish Academy. He was also made a member of several nordic academic societies as well as vice president of the Comité International des Sciences Historiques."

  "text" : "Nikanor Hoveka (ca. 1875—1951) was chief of the Ovambanderu, a Herero clan in Namibia (then South West Africa). He succeeded his father Kanangati Hoveka in 1896 as chief of the Ovambanderu. This came at the time when Imperial Germany had just begun to colonise the area and to establish German South-West Africa. When the Herero and Namaqua War of 1904–1907 broke out, Hoveka fought against the Germans. In 1905 he was interned at Otjihaenena concentration camp near Okatumba. After World War I Hoveka became engaged in early Pan-Africanism. He was one of the first Namibians to support and spread this idea and helped to set up the Windhoek office of the Universal Negro Improvement Association (UNIA) in 1922. In April 1946, the South African administration of South-West Africa held a referendum among the indigenous population to gather support for an incorporation of the area as its fifth province. The referendum was worded in a deceiving way, offering choices \"to join the Chinese, the Russians, or even the British\", blurring the real issue of surrendering their territory to the South Africans. The referendum went in favour of the South Africans but was rejected by the UN General Assembly. Nikanor Hoveka and Hosea Kutako were the first to petition the United Nations about this issue. Nikanor Hoveka died in 1951. He was succeeded as chief of the Ovambanderu by Stephanus Hoveka."

According to Bloomberg statistics, within the first few weeks of Godahewa's appointment as SEC head, the market bounced back from world’s worst performing stock market status to the third best performing stock market status. This prompted the business newspaper Daily FT to carry a headline \"From Bust to Boom\". In November 2012 Godahewa presented a three-year roadmap for capital market development in Sri Lanka. which was endorsed by key industry stakeholders as a timely, positive step in the right direction. By January 2014 Godahewa was in a position to publicly claim that \"Foundation laid; time for other stakeholders to deliver\" The all share price index of CSE had reached 7500 and was performing above all regional and global indices when Godahewa announced in January 2015 the vision and strategies for the market capitalization to be 100Bn by 2020"

She stopped school at an early age and worked with a seamstress to help her family, but gave up to take a chance for music. In the early seventies she got a breakthrough, taking part in the musical show \"Mawahib\" (a show that revealed Moroccan talents such as Samira Said, and Rajae Belmlih). She became a star in the 1970s with the release of her song \"Jrit Ou Jarit\" also known as \"Yaka Jarhi\". It became a hit throughout the Arab world, from North Africa all the way to the Persian Gulf region. Unlike her fellow singers from Mawahib, she stayed in Morocco to pursue her career and not to go to Egypt, that was welcoming voices from across the Arab world to work with its leading composers and writers. \"I think, she said, that one can achieve success and reveal itself to the world without immigrating\". Her Khaleeji song from Qatar, \"Wagif Aala Babikom\", was a huge success."

Carlisle traced his descent from John Carlisle (d. 1670), of Witton-le-Wear. He was the son of Thomas Carlisle. His father married, first, Elizabeth Hutchinson; they had at least one child, a son, the surgeon, Anthony Carlisle. Thomas married secondly Susanna Skottowe, who was Nicholas' mother. Nicholas was born in York, where he was baptized in the St Mary Bishophill Junior, York on 8 February 1771. He received his education from the Rev. James Lawson at West Witton. Carlisle entered the naval service of the East India Company, attaining the post of purser. He also went into private business and made a large sum of money."

(later Major General) Henry Dearborn's company in the expedition against Quebec in Col. Benedict Arnold's detachment. The thousand men marched to Newburyport, where they embarked on September 18, 1775. During the campaign, Lt. Nathanial and Capt. Dearborn, as well as others, were captured at Quebec December 31, 1775. On April 4, 1777, the New Hampshire House promoted Lt. Nathaniel to Captain in Col. Cilley's regiment. His company, with sixteen or more men from Weare, was in the first New Hampshire regiment in John Sullivan's brigade. It saw action under Washington at Trenton and Princeton. Capt. Nathaniel was at White Plains in July 1778. The records indicate absence for illness \"at Hartford\" from November 1778 to April 1779. George Washington had written from Valley Forge on May 20, 1778 to Major General Heath of Boston as follows: \"I shall direct a guard to relieve Capt. (Nathaniel) Hutchins at Reading\". Later, Nathaniel was on furlough from October 1779 to the end of the year. But he was sick again the last two months of 1780 and seems to have retired from service pursuant to a general order of November 1, 1780. His military record is as follows: French and Indian War \n*  Ensign, Roger's Rangers, New Hampshire Detachment under Cpt. John Stark, 1759 American Revolution \n*  2nd Lieutenant, 1st N.H. Regiment under Col. John Stark, April 23, 1775 (Battle of Bunker Hill, June 17, 1775) \n*  1st Lieutenant, 5th Continental Infantry, January 1, 1776 \n*  Captain Lieutenant, September 25, 1776 \n*  Captain Lieutenant 1st N.H., November 8, 1776 \n*  Captain, April 4, 1777 \n*  retired January 1, 1781 His headstone has inscribed upon it: \"Nathaniel Hutchins died 10 Jan. 1832, aged 89. He served in the French War 5 years, was Commanding Officer in the Revolutionary War, and was in the Battle of Bunker Hill in 1775.\" The grave bears a Revolutionary War flag."

Black emigrated to Australia in 1839, and went to the Camperdown district, where, as the representative partner of Mr. Finlay, of Castle Toward, Argyleshire, Mr. Stuart Gladstone, of Capenock, and Mr. Stewart, of Glenormiston, Perthshire, Scotland, he purchased the Glenormiston property. The partnership, which was highly remunerative after 1846, continued until 1868, when the property was divided. Black bought Gladstone's portion, now known as Mount Noorat, and resided on it until his death on 15 May 1880. Black, who married Miss Grace Greenshiels Leadbetter, represented the Western Province from February 1859 to May 1880 in the Legislative Council, and was also a magistrate for the southern bailiwick. As a politician he was a staunch Conservative, and opposed the introduction of free education."

He was born in Port Huron, Michigan, the son of Granville Boynton and Frances Rendt Boynton. Frances Rendt was the daughter of Captain Ludwig Rendt, a Hessian soldier who fought for the British in the War of 1812; his wife was from Spain. Boynton was educated in Waukegan, Illinois and briefly attended medical school in Cincinnati, Ohio where he married Anna Fidelei. Together they had five children. After his service in the Civil War, Boynton returned to Port Huron where he served in many capacities, including postmaster, newspaper publisher and mayor. He held patents related to fire fighting equipment and commemorative badges. He also founded the Order of the Maccabees, a national social fraternity that served as a form of life insurance. His failing health caused him to seek a warmer climate; Boynton visited South Florida in 1895 with Congressman William S. Linton. Boynton purchased land along the beachfront from Linton and built a wooden two-story hotel, The Boynton, later called the Boynton Beach Hotel. The associated town west of the hotel was named for Major Boynton on the plat filed by Byrd S. Dewey and her husband Fred S. Dewey on September 26, 1898. The town incorporated in 1920. Major Boynton died on May 27, 1911 at his home in Port Huron."

  "text" : "Nathan Runkle (born c. 1984) is an American animal rights advocate. He is the founder and executive director of Mercy For Animals. Raised on a farm in rural Ohio, Runkle has long had a deep connection with farmed animals. After a local farmed animal abuse case involving a piglet slammed headfirst into a concrete floor during an agriculture project at a nearby high school, he founded Mercy For Animals to give \"food\" animals a much-needed advocate in his local community. Since founding Mercy For Animals over a decade ago, Runkle has overseen the organization's growth into a leading national force in the prevention of cruelty to farmed animals and promotion of compassionate food choices and policies. A nationally recognized speaker on animal advocacy, factory farming, and veganism, Runkle has presented at colleges, conferences, and many other forums from coast to coast. Runkle works closely with MFA's diverse group of members, supporters, and employees to oversee, develop, and fulfill objectives within the organization's four areas of focus: education, legal advocacy, corporate outreach, and undercover investigations. Runkle has worked alongside elected officials, corporate executives, heads of international organizations, professors, farmers, celebrities, and film producers to pass landmark farmed animal protection legislation, raise public awareness about vegetarianism, and implement animal welfare policy changes. VegNews magazine has recognized both Mercy For Animals and Runkle for making substantial contributions to the vegetarian movement, naming Runkle one of the \"25 Most Fascinating Vegetarians\" and one of the country's \"Top 20 Activists Under 30 Years Old,\" and twice naming MFA \"Non-Profit of the Year.\" In 2009, at the age of 25, he became the youngest person ever inducted into the U.S. Animal Rights Hall of Fame. Runkle is one of several people who provided information used in the writing of the book Striking at the Roots: A Practical Guide to Animal Activism (2008) by Mark Hawthorne. Also, he is one of several people who provided information used in the writing of the book Uncaged: Top Activists Share Their Wisdom on Effective Farm Animal Advocacy (2013) by Ben Davidow."

  "text" : "Ngan Shing-kwan, CBE (Chinese: 顏成坤; 1900–2001), born in Hong Kong,  was a notable Hong Kong transport and later property tycoon that ran China Motor Bus. Ngan got his start running his uncle's rickshaw service during the 1920s in Kowloon. Such was Ngan's reputation in the rickshaw industry that according to one interview \"[s]top any rickshaw puller on the street and he would nod knowingly at the nearest mention of Ngan Shing Kwan's [sic] name.\" This success within the rickshaw industry attracted the attention of the government and Ngan won the first exclusive licence to operate a bus service in Hong Kong in 1933. Ngan established himself on the Hong Kong business scene via a frugal attitude during the early days of China Motor Bus. The Company owned many strategic bus depots and properties, which were subsequently redeveloped for commercial, residential and industrial use at great profit. Ngan Shing-kwan thrived by sticking to two simple principles: devotion to the buses and counting the pennies. In fact, it was Ngan that was instrumental in bringing the iconic double-decker bus to Hong Kong. However, by the early 1990s and after Ngan Shing-kwan's retirement from day-to-day operations, that the Company began to fall behind its competitors Citybus and Kowloon Motor Bus. Ngan Shing-kwan's children incorrectly wagered that frugal Hong Kong customers would not pay a premium for air conditioned buses. The Company's frugality, once a virtue, had now become a liability. Even though CMB was a Hong Kong Stock Exchange listed Company, annual general meetings were often held in a depot and once inside a hospital. Finally, in 1998, despite owning a fleet of more than 800 buses, having 2,400 employees and a turnover of HKD$800 million, the Hong Kong government pulled CMB's licence, citing poor performance. At the time CMB's licence was pulled just 20% of their fleet was air conditioned, versus their competitors which had approximately 80%. Ngan Shing-kwan remained Chairman of CMB until his death, where he was subsequently succeeded by his children: Irene, Henry and Horace. The later, Horace, subsequently became Baron of Appleby in 1999. Ngan was a high profile member of Hong Kong's public sector. In addition to his role at China Motor Bus Co. Ltd, he was the first chairman of the Tung Wah Hospital's and the Po Leung Kuk (Society for the Protection of Women and Children). Ngan was also a member of Hong Kong's Legislative Council (1951–1961) and the Executive Council (1959–1961), until he was succeeded by Douglas Clague on 28 May 1961. In the New Year Honours 1961 Shing-kwan was appointed as a Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire for public services in Hong Kong. Ngan was also an influential figure within the Chiu Chow Chamber of Commerce since the 1930s and was known to be a devout Christian and trustee of Hop Yat Church's in Kowloon (since 1957), North Point (since 1984) and Ma On Shan (since 1997)."

She distributed her prints, and various note cards at a number of state parks and other venues. She was presented with a plaque in 1970 for her contributions to Kentucky's Public Libraries. In the 1980s, she was commissioned by the Kidney Foundation of Central Kentucky, to paint a series of Kentucky winter and holiday scenes to be used as Christmas cards and prints, which earned tens of thousands of dollars for the foundation. Nellie also marketed prints that benefited the Arthritis Foundation, various women's clubs, and other organizations, Her paintings of local, Powell County, Kentucky, attractions; such as Natural Bridge, and the Red River Gorge, paid tribute to the Powell County area she was so proud of. Her joy of painting was immense, and she loved to share her artwork with people. Her reputation as a generous, kind, and fun loving person was known in her hometown, home state, and in many other states around. In 2006, Nellie died at the age of 91. She was in the process of painting a new original work. Al Cornett, a Powell County artist, described her as \"an excellent wildflower artist and landscape painter\"."

She was an especial favorite with the dancers, and it is quite likely that she must have had some previous training to have acquired such proficiency. None but the best can play for those who are called stage or platform dancers. Without a blink of light in her eyes, she was able to discern each step-dancer by the sound of his feet.\" Barry furthermore stated that \"Not the least entertaining part of the performance was the fusillade of comments she kept up all the time, such as: Wisha, darlin, to ye, Patsy Magner. Yerra, I wouldn't doubt your father's son Wire into 'em, Mickey Joe Sullivan, there is not the batins of ye anywhere for a gorsoon.

  "text" : "Nevio Skull (23 December 1903 – 3 May 1945) was a Yugoslav Italian businessman and politician from Rijeka (now Croatia). From his father, Skull inherited the property of the \"Foundry and factory machines of Matthew Skull\", founded in Rijeka in 1878 and quickly became the largest private industry in the city before being taken over in 1935. After 1943 Skull was approached by emissaries of the Yugoslav Partisans, who attempted to convince him to support the annexation of the city of Rijeka to the Democratic Federal Yugoslavia. Skull rejected these proposals, and with the surrender of Italy in World War II, a group of citizens issued a Liburnia Memorandum in which it was recommended that an Italian confederate state be formed from the free cantons of Rijeka (Fiume), Sušak (Sussak) and Ilirska Bistrica (Bisterza), with a planned condominium with the islands of Krk (Veglia), Cres (Cherso) and Lošinj (Lussino). On the night of 3–4 May 1945, following the Yugoslav occupation of Rijeka, Skull was arrested by agents of OZNA and disappeared. His body was found on the riverbed of the Rječina 25 days later with a gunshot wound to the neck."

  "text" : "Nicholas, Count of Schauenburg and Holstein-Rendsburg (also known as  Claus of Holstein; 1321 – 8 May 1397 in Itzehoe) was a titular Count of Schauenburg. Together first with his brother and then with his nephews, Nicholas was the co-ruling Count of Holstein-Rendsburg from 1340 until his death. In 1390 Nicholas and his nephews inherited Holstein-Kiel, which itself included former Holstein-Plön through reversion in 1350. So except of Holstein-Pinneberg Nicholas and his nephews had united all of Holstein. He was also co-ruler of Schleswig from 1375 to 1386. He was thus a leading member of the House of Schauenburg and an influential figure in the area north of the Elbe. He was the second son of Count Gerhard III of Holstein-Rendsburg and his wife, Sophia of Werle. He ruled Schleswig jointly with his elder brother Henry II from 1375 to 1384, thereafter alone. In 1386, he abdicated as Duke of Schleswig in favour of Henry II's son Gerhard VI of Holstein-Rendsburg, who was confirmed as Gerhard II as Duke of Schleswig by King Olaf II of Denmark. In 1354, he married Elisabeth, the daughter of Duke William II of Brunswick and Lüneburg, Prince of Lunenburg. She was the widow of Otto of Saxe-Wittenberg, a son of Rudolph I. They had one daughter: \n*  Elisabeth (1360 – 25 January 1416 in Cammin), married: 1.  \n*  Duke Albert IV of Mecklenburg-Schwerin (1363-1388) 2.  \n*  in 1404 to Duke Eric V of Saxe-Lauenburg (c. 1374 – 1435) In 1362, Nicholas engaged his daughter to Prince Haakon, who later became King Haakon VI of Norway. However, the engagement was broken off for political reasons in 1363 and Haakon married Queen Margaret I of Denmark instead. Nicholas died in 1397 and was buried in Itzehoe. His nephew Gerhard VI acted as guardian for his underage daughter Elisabeth. After Nicholas' death his co-ruling nephews Albert II and the elder Gerhard VI partitioned Holstein-Segeberg as a secundogeniture for Albert from Holstein-Rendsburg. Gerhard VI then continued ruling Holstein-Rendsburg as the sole count."

He is known for the Cholodny–Went model, which he developed independently with Frits Warmolt Went of the California Institute of Technology.Despite being associated with the same theory, the two men never actually met. Cholodny worked in the A.V. Fomin Botanical Garden, attached to the University of Kiev.He was one of the pioneers of the concept that microbes adhere to surfaces, using the technique of first placing glass slides in earth for a measured time period,then using a microscope to examine the slides.The Prokaryote Leptothrix cholodnii is named after him. In 1927 Cholodny proposed that the cells of the coleoptile are first polarized under the influence of uneven exposure to light, so growth hormone can diffuse more rapidly towards the side in the shade than in any other direction.Went reached the same conclusion in 1928, and the two scientists' names have been attached to the controversial Cholodny-Went theory."

  "text" : "Niels Carlsen (8 January 1734 – 3 May 1809) was a Norwegian timber merchant, landowner, shipowner and banker. Carlsen was one of the biggest ship owners in Norway of his time. Carlsen was born in Drøbak in Akershus, Norway. He was the son of Jacob Carlsen (ca. 1685-1749) and Maria Jørgensdatter Frost. His father had married the widow of his employer and took over the trading business. Drøbak had a favorable location situated on east side of Drøbak Sound, at the narrowest part of the Oslo Fjord. It was near the capital, had good anchoring and mooring facilities and a protective harbor. Niels Carlsen and his half brothers Christian went into their father's business and expanded it. The brothers were shipowners, forest owners, traded in both imports and exports and took part in the financing operations that came with the profession. Carlsen bought up forest lands on both sides of the bay, floated the logs into circulation plots which he had acquired along Drøbak Sound, operated a sawmill and built bulwark against the sea to facilitate the loading of ships. He owned a large part of the property along the seafront as well as the small islands where Oscarsborg Fortress is now situated. With these acquisition, he initiated the operation of a ferry landing, plus guest house and coaching inn. Carlsen married Martha Zachariassen (1743–1821), the daughter of Zacharias Simonsen Wesseltoft (1701-1777), a wealthy merchant and shipowner in Skien. She and her family contributed to the further development of Carlsen's business and to the development of Drøbak. Carlsen and his wife donated funds for a wooden cruciform church, hospital and school. Drøbak Church (Drøbak kirke) was fully furnished and was inaugurated in 1776. Facing the church is the building which was dedicated as a hospital and hostel for poor widows in 1793. A bust of Carlsen, made by Arne Vinje Gunnerud, is located between Drøbak Church and the old Drøbak Hospital."

When the soldiers formed themselves into the People's Redemption Council in order to govern the country, he became the co-chairman of the council and thus the country's Vice Head of State. In the aftermath of the government's overthrow, he was proclaimed a general, although his precise title is unclear; some sources called him a brigadier general and others a major general. He died violently in the wake of what former PRC chairman and later President Samuel K. Doe called an attempted coup d'état. Doe's government announced that Podier had died in a gun battle on one of the country's borders, although other sources questioned Doe's claims and suggested that he had been tortured to death in one of Doe's many attempts to consolidate his power."
