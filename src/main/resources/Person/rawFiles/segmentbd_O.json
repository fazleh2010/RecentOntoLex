Allen has been credited with being the architect of the Summit Stake Tabernacle, Taylor approved of the plans and likely assisted Allen who was untrained as an architect. Obed Taylor worked in partnership with William H. Folsom on many projects including the Deseret National Bank, ZCMI's cast-iron storefront (1876), and the Feramorz Little residence. He died at the height of his architectural career in 1881. Funeral services were held in the Salt Lake 18th Ward meetinghouse which he had recently designed. The Walker Opera House as well as a building at the University of Deseret were designed by Taylor but completed after his death."

He improved the administration of the county and granted city rights to Bevergen. He acquired the bailiwicks of Clarholz, Marienfeld and Herzebrock. His marriage with Adelaide of Lippe gave him a claim on the cities of Rheda and Lipperode. This led to a lengthy dispute, which was resolved in 1401 by a compromise between his son Nicholas II and his second cousin Simon III of Lippe: Nicholas received Rheda, and LIpperode became a condominium between Lippe and the County of Mark From 1372 to 1379, Otto was also administrator of the Bishopric of Osnabrück, after he had deposed bishopMelchior. In 1379, he was besieged in Rheda and had to surrender."

  "text" : "Oscar Collett (9 December 1877 – 1950) was a Norwegian landowner and benefactor. He was born in Trondhjem as a son of landowner Albert Peter Severin Collett (1842–1896) and Nanna Høegh (1854–1921). He was a brother of physician Arthur Collett and chemist Emil Collett. He was a forester by education, and spent his career as an executive of the family-owned forest estate company Firma Albert Collett together with his brothers Johan and Axel. The company still operates hundreds of square miles of forest in Namdalen, as well as several hydroelectric power stations. Collett became a member of the gentlemen's skiing club SK Fram in 1890, the club's second year of existence. From 1935 he served as a supervisory council member of the insurance company Forsikringsselskapet Viking, together with many acquaintances from Fram. He was a deputy board member of the Norwegian Forestry Society and the Det norske Myrselskap. He was also a co-founder of the first incarnation of the Norwegian Ornithological Society and its journal Norsk ornithologisk tidsskrift in 1920. By the end of 1920 Collett had become the single largest benefactor to the journal; with a gift of NOK 1,200 he had contributed 22% of the journal's assets, more than twice as much as any other individual. He sat on the Ornithological Society's interim board until the first general assembly in 1922, where he was elected deputy board member. Oscar Collett died in 1950, and was buried at Vestre gravlund. His son Carl Oscar Collett, who was born 1922 and whose mother was Maria Iversen, became a landowner and politician. Carl Oscar became a son-in-law of Henning Bødtker, and was admitted to SK Fram, continuing the family tradition."

At the age of 19, she organized ethnic Kokang forces, nicknamed the Olive's Boys, an army of over a thousand soldiers and consolidated control of opium trade routes from the highlands to lowlands. She dominated Kokang's opium trade from the end of World War II to the early 1960s. In the 1950s, after the Nationalist defeat and their subsequent expulsion from mainland China, she partnered with the Kuomintang to establish opium trade routes along the Golden Triangle (Southeast Asia). From 1948 to 1950, she was married to Twan Sao Wen, the son of Tamaing's chieftain, and had a son, Duan Jipu (段吉卜), in 1950. Her son is a teacher in Chiang Mai, Thailand. From the 1950s to the mid-1960s, she was the commander of the Kokang Kakweye (People's Defense Forces). She was a prominent figure in opium trafficking and gold trading. She was arrested in 1962, along with her brother Jimmy, a member of parliament in Yangon, by Burmese authorities, to remove them from power and place Kokang territory under Burmese administration. She was imprisoned at Insein Prison and released in 1968. Yang was known to be a bisexual who carried on affairs with film actresses and singers, including Wah Wah Win Shwe (ဝါဝါဝင်းရွှေ). In the late 1980s, she was recruited by Khin Nyunt to help broker ceasefires in Burma with ethnic rebel groups. After her release, she reportedly spends her final years as a nun."

One of his brothers was Thomas Holland, who became the 1st Earl of Kent and was also invested a founder Knight of the Garter. Otho's father was illegally beheaded by Lancastrians when Otho was 12 years old. Otho joined his brother Thomas in Edward III's military expedition to Normandy in 1346 and fought at the Battle of Caen. There the Constable of France surrendered himself to his brother who sold him to the King. Back in England the Constable was given to Otho to guard until he could ransomed but Otho allowed his prisoner too much freedom (by allowing him to cross to France on parole) and was heavily censured as a result. In 1348 he was invested, along with his brother Thomas, as a founder knight of the new Order of the Garter and allocated stall 23 at the home of the order in St George's Chapel at Windsor Castle. In 1355 he again joined his brother Thomas on a campaign in France, but was taken prisoner in Dauphiny and ransomed. He was made Governor of the Channel Islands in 1359. He died childless in Normandy in 1359. His estates went to his brothers Robert and Thomas."

  "text" : "Ottaviano Fregoso (born in Genoa, 1470 - died in Ischia, 1524) was the Doge of the Republic of Genoa. Ottaviano Fregoso, was the son of Agostino Fregoso and Gentile di Montefeltro, daughter of the renowned condottiero, patron of humanists, and book collector, Federico da Montefeltro, Duke of Urbino. Ottaviano was born in Genoa, but, like his brother, the future cardinal, Federigo, spent much of his youth at the court of Urbino, presided over by their uncle, Guidobaldo da Montefeltro. There the brothers received a classical humanistic education and were the companions and close friends of such humanists as Pietro Bembo and Baldassare Castiglione and the painter Raphael. Ottaviano and Federigo Fregoso are participants in the fictional discussion presided over by Elisabetta Gonzaga, Duchess of Urbino, in Baldassare Castiglione's The Book of the Courtier, which was supposed to have taken place at the court of Urbino in 1507. In the dialog, both brothers, who themselves (like the other interlocutors in the discussion), are supposed to embody the Italian Renaissance ideal of courtly behavior in an ideal court, are depicted as defending a republican form of government. Beginning in 1497, Ottaviano participated in an alliance with King Charles VII of France, in order to expel the Sforza family from Genoa. In the early 1500s, he also defended his uncle's duchy of Urbino against Cesare Borgia, known as Valentino, the son of Pope Alexander VI. In the course of this war, Guidobaldo da Montefeltro, was forced to destroy several fortresses rather than cede them to the enemy. In 1506 Guidobaldo conferred on Ottaviano the lordship of Sant'Agata Feltria, which was confirmed in 1513 by Pope Leo X. Also in 1506, Ottaviano was sent to Bologna to recover for the Papal States the cities that had fallen into the hands of Giovanni Bentivoglio. Subsequently, Ottaviano returned to Genoa, where he and his cousin, Giano II Campofregoso, attempted to expel their former allies, the French. At that time the Fregoso (Guelph) and the Adorno (Ghibelline) families were engaged in a violent struggle for the supremacy of the city. These clashes culminated in 1510 with the victory of Adornos: the Fregoso faction was forced again into exile and again took refuge in Urbino. Three years later, the Fregosos turned the tables and defeated the Adornos, returning to Genoa, where in June 1513 Ottaviano became Doge. During his government he initiated important public works such as the modernization of the port of Genoa and the construction of the tower of the Cathedral of San Lorenzo. For its times, Ottaviano's government displayed notable magnanimity towards its opponents, both those within his family, as with his cousin (and former ally against the French), Giano II Campofregoso, who plotted to take Ottaviano's place as Doge, and toward members of such traditionally hostile families as the Adorno and the Fieschi. After 1515, Ottaviano Fregoso was forced to acknowledge King Francis I of France, as his overlord; Francis, however, allowed Ottaviano to remain on as ruler of Genoa. In 1520 Pope Leo X conferred on him the title of Count. When Spanish troops under Emperor Charles V sacked and occupied Genoa in 1522, Ottaviano was captured and imprisoned, first at Naples, then at Aversa, and then in the fortress of Ischia, where he died in 1524, according to some authors, by poisoning. After his death, the fief of S. Agatha was ruled, first by his brother, Cardinal Federigo Fregoso and then by his son Aurelio."

After passing the matriculation exam in 1934, he went on to the Rangoon Medical College (now UM-1 Yangon). However, he dropped out and pursued journalism instead. Throughout his journalism career, he wrote for the Kyipwayay (\"Growth\") magazine, and the Totetyay (\"Progress\"), the Journal Kyaw (along with Chit Maung), and the New Light of Burma newspapers. In 1958, soon after Ne Win first declared emergency martial law, he was imprisoned in the Coco Islands for two years, under the Public Order Protection Act, for his leftist political activism. In the mid-1960s, he was detained again in Insein Prison. Ohn Myint is widely considered to have influenced Aung San Suu Kyi, and the two had a close friendship. In 1989, he was arrested for another 5 years and once again in 1998 for allowing himself to be interviewed by researcher Aung Htun, who was writing a book on the history of Burma's student movement. Although he was sentenced to 7 years of hard labor, his sentence was commuted the following year, after the visit of American congressman Tony P. Hall. He was cremated at the Yayway Cemetery in Yangon."

Otia Ioseliani was born in the village of Gvishtibi, Tsqaltubo District, in then-Soviet Georgia. He began writing in the mid-1950s and published his first collection of stories in 1957. The nationwide recognition came with his first novel The Falling Stars (ვარსკვლავთცვენა, 1962), which, like Ioseliani's many early works, treated the theme of World War II. He then tackled in his works a great variety of themes using different artistic styles. In the 1960s and 1970s, he published popular novels such as Once There Was a Woman (იყო ერთი ქალი, 1970), Taken Prisoner by Prisoners (ტყვეთა ტყვე, 1975), and a number of stories. In the 1960s, Ioseliani first tried his hand at screen scripts and theatre plays, resulting, among others, in the comedies Until the Ox-Cart Turns Over (სანამ ურემი გადაბრუნდება, 1969) and Six Old Maids and a Man (ექვსი შინაბერა და ერთი მამაკაცი, 1971), which were successful enough to fill the theatres in East Berlin. Ioseliani died in 2011 at the age of 81. He was buried in the yard of his own house in his native Gvishtibi according to the will of the late writer. Among his awards was Georgia's Order of Honor."

  "text" : "Oscar Luscher Rapson (3 November 1883 – 8 May 1952) was an American farmhand, hotel manager and store owner. Rapson is best known for being the first manager of the Grand Rapids Hotel, which was the first major resort on the Wabash River. Rapson was born in Danville, Illinois, but both of his parents died within a few years of his birth. Rapson and a few of his siblings were raised by their aunt and uncle in Mount Carmel, Illinois. In his early years, Rapson worked in many low-paying jobs until finally finding a job working on Frederick Hinde Zimmerman's farm. Initially, Rapson was a general farmhand, but after a period of time became the first manager of the Grand Rapids Hotel. During his tenure as manager of the hotel, Rapson orchestrated many national events and helped the area surrounding the hotel to experience economic growth and notability during his stewardship through an increase in tourism and business at the hotel. While manager at the hotel, Rapson oversaw the creation of a country club and golf course as well as numerous other outdoor recreation facilities including trap shooting facilities, boat tours, hiking trails, surf boat rides, and many others. Additionally, the hotel's restaurant was opened while Rapson was manager and proved to be very successful in attracting organizations and clubs to the hotel. In 1924, shortly after the unexpected death of Frederick Hinde Zimmerman, Rapson was fired and Glenn Goodart replaced him as manager of the hotel. After the being fired from his position as manager of the hotel, Rapson moved to various small cities in Texas. The first few years after his arrival in Texas, Rapson primarily worked jobs similar to his previous work on the Zimmerman farm in Illinois. Later, after he married and settled in Marlin, Texas, he opened a small general store that sold a variety of items to locals in Marlin, Texas as well as the surrounding area."

  "text" : "Olivier Costa de Beauregard (Paris, 6 November 1911 – Poitiers, 5 February 2007) was a French relativistic and quantum physicist, and philosopher of science. He was an eminent specialist of time and of information theory. He studied under Louis de Broglie. From 1947, he proposed to de Broglie his interpretation of the EPR paradox which questions the notion of time. In 1974, with Bernard d'Espagnat, he suggested to Christian Imbert, a young professor at Institut d'Optique, to propose to Alain Aspect to perform a Bell's inequalities experimental test, to settle the conflict between the results of Clauser and Freedman at Berkeley, and Holt and Pipkin at Harvard. After Aspect decided to do a different experiment, he explained the quantum mechanical predictions by the theory of retrocausation or CPT-invariance.His numerous publications also concerned the inertial effect of spin, the Imbert effect, Fresnel evanescent wave of Fresnel, and Dirac equation."

He was born in Ham-Nord, Quebec, the son of Alfred Demers and Rose Anna Dufresne, and was educated in Victoriaville. In 1912, his father and mother moved to Debden, Saskatchewan; they were one of the first families to settle in the area. They convinced Omer and his brother Adelbert to move to Debden. The two brothers arrived with a boxcar full of supplies and, soon after arriving, built a store which included living quarters. In 1914, Omer married Lucienne Larose. With his business going well, he soon built a larger store and residence. Demers helped open the first school in the town in 1915 and helped establish a Catholic parish. He also served as postmaster from 1912 to 1919. In 1920, Demers became the first mayor of Debden. He sold the store after his wife developed tuberculosis. After she recovered, she opened a women's clothing store in Debden. Demers took up ranching and then muskrat ranching; both ventures were not successful. He was defeated by Albert Victor Sterling when he ran for reelection to the assembly in 1944. In 1945, Demers moved to British Columbia. He died in Esquimalt at the age of 75."

  "text" : "Oskar Karlweis (10 July 1894, Hinterbrühl – 24 January 1956, New York) was an Austrian stage and film actor, active internationally. Son of a playwright, Karlweis abandoned his youthful law studies for the stage, first for eight years at Vienna's Stadttheater. After service in World War I, he was active with Max Reinhardt's Theater in der Josefstadt in Vienna, followed by engagements at various theaters in Munich and Vienna, and then to the Berlin stage where he had a popular following playing singing and dancing roles, including as Prinz Orlofsky in Die Fledermaus. His general manner was humorous, charming, naive, and cheerful. In Berlin between 1930 and 1933 he worked as a recording artist and acted in more than a dozen German light comedy and musical films, most famously as one of Lilian Harvey's suitors in the hugely successful operetta film Die Drei von der Tankstelle. With Hitler's rise to power in 1933, Karlweis, who was of Jewish descent, returned to the Austrian stage; but with the Nazi Anschluss in 1938 he was again forced to flee, first to Switzerland and then Paris where, at both locations, he took to the stage with fellow Austrian law school dropout, writer/director, and cabaret performer Karl Farkas. When German forces took Paris in 1940, Karlweis, along with his friend Austrian writer Friedrich Torberg, fled via Spain to Portugal, whence they made their way to New York. Not knowing English, Karlweis was at first limited to acting in German emmigré productions, but he soon got his English legs and appeared in eight Broadway shows in the early 1940s, including the title role in Franz Werfel's long-running \"Jacobowsky and the Colonel,\" garnering outstanding reviews. In the early 1950s Karlweis played supporting roles in TV productions and in several Hollywood and European films. He died in 1956 of a heart attack in New York, and is interred in Vienna."

  "text" : "Olga Limburg (5 April 1881 – 7 March 1970) was a German theater and film actress. She began her artistic career in 1901 with a commitment at the Municipal Theatre of Poznan. Since 1902, she played at several of Berlin's leading theaters including the Tribune, the Metropol Theatre, Berlin Lustspielhaus, the comedy and the Theater am Kurfürstendamm.

Limburg's film acting career started in 1907 with a minor role in the silent film Fest der Handwerker and followed by Der gelbe Tod, 1. Teil (1910). She also starred in major productions including Prinz Kuckuck (1919), Kean (1921) and Rudolf Meinert-directed Marie Antoinette, the Love of a King (1922). These films achieved her much acclaim as a supporting actress. She continued her acting career through the next decade and starred in talkies like Zwischen Nacht und Morgen (1931), Ein Unsichtbarer geht durch die Stadt, The Black Forest Girl (both 1933), The Girl Irene (1936) Madame Bovary (1937), Napoleon ist an allem schuld, Five Million Look for an Heir (both 1938) and Hurrah! I'm a Father (1939) to name a few. It was during these two decades that the became one of the busiest actresses of the German cinema. She played roles of aunts, neighbors, housekeepers and other women next door. From 1919 to 1955, Limburg appeared in 49 films, including four alongside Heinz Rühmann. Before her retirement from the film industry she acted in Nannete, Kleider machen Leute (both 1940), Lord of life and death (1954) and The Heart of St. Pauli (1957).

He was born in Salt Lake City but at a fairly young age moved with his parents to Brigham City, Utah, where his father was the leading authority in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). Snow worked on building the transcontinental railroad. He then studied for a time at the University of Deseret (the predecessor of the University of Utah) under John R. Park. From 1870 to 1873, Snow served as a missionary for the LDS Church in the United Kingdom. In October 1873, he married Mary B. Peirce. In 1875, Snow served another mission, this time in the Eastern States Misson, based in New York City. In 1877, when the Box Elder Stake of the LDS Church was organized, encompassing all of Box Elder County, Utah, and headquartered in Brigham City, Snow was made the stake president, in many ways succeeding his father who had been essentially functioning like a stake president. Snow was released as stake president in 1888. From 1880 to 1886, he served as a member of the Utah Territorial Legislature from Box Elder County. Snow died in Los Angeles, California."

  "text" : "Obie Walker (September 19, 1911 - May 4, 1989), born Obie Dia Walker in Cochran, Georgia, was a professional boxer. Walker was the penultimate World Colored Heavyweight Champion from 9 October 1933, when he out-decisioned title holder George Godfrey in a 10-round fight at the Arena in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, to 20 July 1935, when he lost the title on a decision in a 15-round bout to former colored heavyweight champ Larry Gains on 20 July 1935 in Tigers Rugby Stadium, Leicester, England. A heavyweight contender of the 1930s, he was avoided by many boxers. Sportswriter Ed Danforth praised the \"Bearcat\" in the Atlanta Georgian in a column published on 5 July 1938: \"Walker became the toast of Paris. He knocked cold every topnotcher he met on the continent. Max Schmeling shrewdly dodged him, the best of the Englishmen too, sidestepped the squatty brown man who carried lighting bolts in both fists. Competent critics say he could have knocked out Schmeling, Joe Louis and Jim Braddock in one night within the space of 10 rounds.\" Though short, Walker was quick on his feet, could take a punch on the chin, and was a strong puncher. Among the top heavyweight contenders he defeated was Two-Ton Tony Galento, who fought Joe Louis for the heavyweight championship. It was Louis's long reign as champ that ended the World Colored Heavyweight Title. In his career, Walker won 77 fights (53 by K.O.) and lost 16, with 5 draws. He was never K.O.'ed himself."

  "text" : "Owen Richard Maddock (24 January 1925 – 19 July 2000) was a British engineer and racing car designer, who was chief designer for the Cooper Car Company between 1950 and 1963. During this time Maddock designed a string of successful racing cars, including the Formula One World Championship-winning Cooper T51 and T53 models. The T51 was the first mid-engined car to win either the World Drivers' or Constructors' Championships, feats it achieved in the hands of Jack Brabham in 1959. A year earlier Stirling Moss had taken the first ever Formula One victory for a mid-engined car in another Maddock-designed vehicle: a Cooper T43. In addition to his Formula One work, Maddock also produced race-winning Formula Two, Formula Three and sportscar designs. After leaving Cooper in 1963 Maddock went on to a successful career as an engineering consultant, including a spell as a hovercraft designer working for Saunders-Roe on the Isle of Wight. In his spare time he also enjoyed racing hovercraft, and was a co-founder of the Hovercraft Club of Great Britain. Away from engineering Maddock was an accomplished jazz musician. Among others, he was a part of Mick Mulligan's Magnolia Jazz Band, playing sousaphone, that featured George Melly on vocals. When the band decided to turn fully professional Maddock preferred to remain an amateur and left the group. He also counted saxophone, bass clarinet and piano among his repertoire, and continued to play and compete in jazz competitions until shortly before his death."

His company published books such as Skram's novel Constance Ring, Krohg's confiscated novel Albertine, and the periodicals Nyt Tidsskrift and Kringsjaa. In 1903, Huseby emigrated to America with his family, where he established the Olaf Huseby Publishing House in Minneapolis, Minnesota which remained active from 1904-1935. In retirement, Olaf Huseby and his wife Ingeborg (Skjegstad) Huseby (1861-1945), established their home in Hillsdale, Michigan. He died during 1942 and was buried at Lake View Cemetery."

He received his education at the University of Prague, obtaining his doctorate with a thesis on the expansion of sound and light waves (1879). At Prague he worked as an assistant to Ernst Mach (1838–1916) in the institute of experimental physics. After serving as a lecturer for several years in Prague, he relocated to the University of Vienna in 1890 as an assistant to Joseph Stefan (1835–1893). During the following year he was appointed associate professor of theoretical physics at the University of Czernowitz, where in 1894 he attained the title of \"full professor\". From 1905 to 1925 he served as a professor at the University of Innsbruck. Following his retirement, he was succeeded at Innsbruck by Arthur March (1891–1957). His scientific research largely dealt with the specifics of thermodynamics and electromagnetism. He was the author of well-regarded books on the electromagnetic theory of light and electric potential. \n*  Elektromagnetische Theorie des Lichtes, (1883) - Electromagnetic theory of light. \n*  Das Potential und seine Anwendung zu der Erklärung der elektrischen Erscheinungen, (1884) - Potential and its application to the explanation of electrical phenomena. In 1908 Tumlirz described careful and effective experiments which demonstrated the effect of the rotation of the Earth on the outflow of water through a central aperture, in a paper entitled \"New physical evidence on the axis of rotation of the earth\"."

  "text" : "Ole Paus (23 March 1766 – 26 July 1855) was a Norwegian ship's captain, shipowner and land owner, who belonged to the patriciate of the port town of Skien from the late 18th century. From 1799, he owned the estate Rising in Gjerpen. He is noted as the stepfather of Knud Ibsen as well as the uncle of Marichen Altenburg, the parents of playwright Henrik Ibsen. Many of his descendants, including singer Ole Paus, were named for him. He was married to Johanne Plesner, a daughter of merchant Knud Plesner. Johanne had previously been married to ship's captain Henrich Ibsen, who died at sea in 1797. Johanne and Henrich's only child was Knud Ibsen, who grew up at Rising. Ole Paus was best man at Knud Ibsen's wedding, when he married his niece Marichen Altenburg (a daughter of shipowner Johan Andreas Altenburg and Ole's sister Hedevig Christine Paus). Ole Paus' brother-in-law was Diderik von Cappelen, who was married to his wife's sister Maria Plesner in his first marriage and to Ole Paus' cousin Marie Severine Blom in his second. Ole Paus and Johanne Plesner had 5 sons and 4 daughters: \n* Lawyer Henrik Johan Paus (born 1799) \n* Judge, Governor of Bratsberg and Member of Parliament Christian Cornelius Paus (born 1800) \n* Maria Marthine Paus (born 1802) \n* Christine Pauline Paus (born 1803), married ship's captain Gerhard van Deurs \n* Nicolai Kall Paus (died as an infant 1804) \n* Jacob von der Lippe Paus (born 1806, died 1826) \n* Mariane Nicoline Elisabeth Paus (born 1808) \n* Shipowner and banker Christopher Blom Paus (born 1810) \n* Johanne Caroline Paus (born 1813). Ole Paus was the grandfather of factory owner Ole Paus and the great-grandfather of chamberlain, land owner and art collector Christopher Tostrup Paus (born 1862), who received a comital title from Pope Pius XI. His great-great-grandson Herman Paus married Countess Tatyana Tolstoy, a granddaughter of Leo Tolstoy, and their descendants own Herresta and other Swedish estates. Also among his descendants are General Ole Otto Paus, singer Ole Paus, fashion designer Pontine Paus and businessman Peder Nicolas Paus. Ole Paus was portrayed by Per Theodor Haugen in the 2006 NRK miniseries En udødelig mann."

  "text" : "Olivia Giovetti (sometimes Olivia Marlowe-Giovetti) is an American author, journalist, music critic and radio personality. She was known as the host of The New Canon, a weekly show as part of the programming for Q2 Music, an affiliate of WQXR-FM in New York. Giovetti has also appeared on-air for WQXR proper and writes for the station's website. Her work with The New Canon has made her a prominent figure within the contemporary classical scene in New York, bringing composers like David Lang, David T. Little, Steven Mackey, and John Luther Adams to wider audiences with interactive interviews. Her work with the station has been featured in notable media publications, including New York magazine, NPR, and Alex Ross's blog \"The Rest is Noise.\" She gained added notoriety in 2012 after a blog post, critical of the Metropolitan Opera's new production of Der Ring des Nibelungen and the company's General Manager, Peter Gelb, written for WQXR's opera blog was rescinded after Gelb personally complained to the station. The incident was reported by the New York Times and later made the paper's front page when a similar story of Gelb's strained relationship to the press was reported. In 2013, Giovetti premiered a scene from a new opera she wrote with composer Mohammed Fairouz, based on the life of Benazir Bhutto, at the Brooklyn Academy of Music. Giovetti was previously known for her work as the Classical and Opera editor for Time Out New York, and has also written for the Washington Post, Gramophone, and Playbill. She is also a columnist for Classical Singer magazine and frequently contributes to the publication's features. In her writings, Giovetti has noted that her classical connections extend on her Italian side to ancestors that worked with Giuseppe Verdi. Giovetti's father committed suicide on September 11, 1992. In 2010, Giovetti married Lawson Marlowe, the son of screenwriter-producers Andrew W. Marlowe and Terri Edda Miller."

O'Neill informant, a Mr. Cummings of San Francisco (formerly of Athenry) states that he was a native of Athenry, County Galway, though he appears to have lived in the town of Galway at some point. His date of birth is unknown but he lived in the middle years of the 1800s. Nicholas Burke said of him \"he was much given to rambling and was seldom to be found at home. Going from one gentleman’s place to another’s, all over the country, he remained at each for an indefinite period, as did the harpers in their day.\" A Captain Clancy of the Chicago police in 1913 remembered him calling to his father's house, some eight miles northeast of Galway, in the 1850s. Captain Clancy \"has a clear recollection of the piper and his instrument, describes him as rather tall and thin, with high cheek bones and sallow complexion. His pipes were longer, slimmer, and softer in tone than the modern concert instrument made by Taylor of Philadelphia.\" Cunnigam frequently boasted that he received one hundred pounds a year from the Duke of Northumberland for performing at his castle during the six to eight weeks around Christmas. He also boasted of performing before royalty. Described as \"an incorrigible rambler\", in 1861 he was in the USA, mainly in and around Boston, New York City, and Brooklyn, where he performed with William Boyle (piper). He seems to have also travelled to Melbourne and Sydney at some point. O'Neill said of him \"Like Ferguson, Cunnigam was an exception among pipers. A splendid performer, he played airs, marches and descriptive pieces to perfection, yet, to quote the language of Mr. Burke, “he wasn't much on jigs, reels, or hornpipes.’\""

  "text" : "Omar Agha was the Dey of the Regency of Algiers from April 1815 to September 1817, after the assassination of his predecessor Mohamed Kharnadji the 7th of April 1815, who had been in office for only 17 days. He launched a war against Tunis, and led the Attacks of Barbary privateers on American ships. An expedition of the US Navy led by Commodore Stephen Decatur in command of a squadron of nine ships, was conducted in 1815 against the Regency of Algiers. The episode is known as the Second Barbary War. The operation forced Dey Omar to sign a treaty ending attacks of piracy, a treaty that he denounced shortly thereafter. The Congress of Vienna, which addressed the problem of Christian slaves from Barbary piracy, charged the United Kingdom and the Netherlands to negotiate with the Dey of Algiers and the Beys of Tunis and Tripoli. Although the latter two were agreeable, it was not the same for Omar Agha. It would take the 9-hour Bombardment of Algiers (1816) on 27 August 1816, by an Anglo-Dutch naval force commanded by British Admiral Lord Exmouth, to compel the Dey to abolish christian slavery. However, the bombardment of Algiers did not destroy Barbary power. Despite the signing of the treaty and the release of 3,000 christian slaves, Dey Omar set to rebuilding the city's defences, putting itsJewish inhabitants to foced labour in the place of Christian slaves. Moreover, the problem remained such that it was one of the main areas of contention at the Congress of Aix-la-Chapelle (1818). Regardless, the Janissaries came for the Dey on the morning of September 8, 1817 and had him strangled and buried within an hour. Following his repeated defeats and domestic uproar, a new Dey was soon proclaiming defiance. His successor was Ali ben Ahmed."

  "text" : "Otto of Denmark (c. 1310 – after 1346) (Danish: Otto Christoffersen) was a Danish prince who was also Duke of Lolland and Estonia. He was the second son of King Christopher II of Denmark and Euphemia of Pomerania. In his childhood his older brother Eric had been elected as junior king of Denmark. Otto was given the titles Duke of Lolland and Estonia and was expected to expand the Danish conquest of Estonia acquired during Livonian Crusade. His father and brother were deposed in 1326 and restored three years later on the condition his father signed a charter that gave him little to no power while the Danish nobles and the Counts of Holstein ruled behind the scene and mortgaged most of the kingdom. His brother Eric predeceased both Otto and his father, fighting to rid Denmark from the rule of the Counts of Holstein. King Christopher died in 1332, leaving Otto and his younger brother Valdemar as his only sons and potential heirs to the throne. The Danish nobles for some reason decided not to elect a successor. In 1332, Otto made an attempt to win the Danish crown, but was defeated by Count Gerhard III of Holstein on Taphed at Viborg on 7 October 1334. He was held prisoner in the Segeberg Castle. Upon his father's death and his failed attempt to seize the throne, Denmark ceased being a formal kingdom, and for the next eight years it was subjected by various mortgagees to German military rule. His younger brother would later regain Denmark from the Holsteiners and succeed as Valdemar IV of Denmark. Once Valdemar became king in 1340, Otto was released on the condition that he surrender his claim to the throne. Otto subsequently went to Germany, and joined the Teutonic Order in 1346. The Order bought his duchy in the same year, and no further information is recorded about him. Otto is the other (?Translation needed?) hero of Bernhard Severin Ingemann's novel, Prins Otto af Danmark og Hans Samtid (Prince Otto of Denmark and his Time, 1835)."

Disgusted by the ukiyo lifestyle of contemporary Edo, Ōtaguro became involved with the Tosa Kin no To movement of Takechi Hanpeita. Concerned that his sonnō jōi activism would have negative repercussions for his family, he had himself stricken from the records of the Iida clan and was adopted into the Ono family (who later disowned him on charges of negligence). He became a disciple of Hayashi Oen, and followed his mentor into the Shinto priesthood, becoming shikan of the Isa Ote Jingu shrine at Shinkai."
