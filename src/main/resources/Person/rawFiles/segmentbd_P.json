  "text" : "Peter \"Chuck\" Badie (born May 17, 1925) is a New Orleans jazz bass player. Born in New Orleans, he grew up in Mahalia Jackson’s Carrollton neighborhood. His father was a prominent jazz saxophone player who played with the “Eureka” and the “Original Olympia” brass bands. (His father played with Percy Humphrey’s first band.)  In addition to the strong musical influence of his father, Badie would frequent places such as the Rhythm Club to listen to singer Billy Eckstine and piano player Earl Hines, as well as the Erskine Hawkins, Andy Kirk, and Lucky Millender bands. In 1942, Badie joined the Navy and returned from the service in 1945. He used the G.I. Bill to enroll at the Grunewald School of Music. His first musical job was with the “Buccaneers,” but soon he was playing at the Dew Drop Inn. In 1950 he went on the road with rhythm-and -blues pioneer, Roy Brown (“Good Rockin’ Tonight”) for two years. Later he joined Paul Gayten’s band at the Brass Rail, followed by a stint with Dave Bartholomew’s Band. According to the brief biographical sketch in Harold Battiste’s New Orleans Heritage – Jazz 1956-1966, Badie was introduced to Lionel Hampton, who asked him if he “could travel”. \"I started to ask him could a fish swim?\" Badie remembers. For three years, he performed with Hampton all over the world, playing the electric bass and recording more than 100 songs with Hampton’s band. He left the band to return to New Orleans to assist his mother in the care of his father, who was ill. Back in New Orleans, he joined the American Jazz Quintet, which was considered the top New Orleans modern jazz group of the 1950s and 1960s. At that time, it included Ellis Marsalis, Ed Blackwell, Nat Perrilliat, and Alvin Batiste. In 1961, Harold Battiste formed All For One (AFO) Records, and its membership boasted some of the now-legendary musicians of New Orleans: Badie, Alvin Batiste, Warren Bell, James Black, Edward Blackwell, John Boudreaux, Melvin Lastie, Tami Lynn, Ellis Marsalis, Richard Payne, Nathanial Perrilliat, and Alvin Red Tyler. AFO became an incorporated production company, and Badie served as one of its board members. AFO established its own label, issuing classic R&B recordings and some jazz recordings. According to John Broven in Rhythm & Blues in New Orleans, one of the hits produced by AFO was Barbara Georges’ \"I know.\" AFO also recorded Prince La La’s \"She Put the Hurt on Me,\" and Lee Dorsey’s \"Ya Ya.\" Badie is on most of the popular recordings issued by Minit, which was owned by Joe Banashak and Larry McKinley. These sessions were produced by Allen Toussaint and included Ernie K-Doe’s \"Mother-in-Law\"; Jesse Hill’s \"Oo Poo Pa Doo\"; Irma Thomas’ \"It’s Raining\"; and Benny Spellman’s \"Lipstick Traces.\" He appeared on Chris Kenner’s classic recording for Instant Records, \"Land of 1000 Dances.\" For ten months, Badie toured and recorded with Sam Cooke, and he can be heard on Cooke’s \"Meet me at Mary’s Place\" and \"Ain’t that Good News.\" In addition, he added his distinctive touch to Cooke’s recording of \"Tennessee Waltz,\" telling a friend that he introduced it in 4/4 time instead of the ¾ time made popular on Pattie Paige’s version. He also is proud of the intro he added to Cooke’s Civil Rights song, \"Change is Gonna Come.\" All these songs were recorded in one session in December 1963. After Sam Cooke was killed in Los Angeles in 1964, Badie returned home to New Orleans with his family. He has played with Zoot Sims, Dizzy Gillespie, Fats Domino, Lloyd Price, Big Joe Turner, Charles Brown (musician), and Hank Crawford. In the late 1960s, he worked six nights a week at Mason’s with pianist Ed Frank and drummer June Gardner. Badie stopped playing in the 1970s and early 1980s because of health reasons; however, he returned to music in the late 1980s. Since 1994, he regularly performs on Saturday nights at the Palm Court Jazz Café. Although Badie was one of the first musicians around New Orleans to perform on an electric bass, which he used almost exclusively with Lionel Hampton’s band, most of his major recordings featured him on the upright bass. A versatile musician, he was comfortable playing with big bands and small traditional jazz bands, modern jazz ensembles, and rhythm-and-blues bands. Badie lost his home on the Lower Ninth Ward after the levees broke following Hurricane Katrina, and at the age of 80 assumed a new mortgage to purchase a home in the Habitat for Humanity Musicians’ Village. Despite his age, he put in 350 hours of equity in the Musicians’ Village to build his new home, working with countless young people from around the nation pouring concrete, laying heavy cinder block bricks, framing houses, and painting. He learned many of these skills when clearing land in the 1940s for the development of Lakeview. Badie is a member of St. David’s Church in the Lower Ninth Ward, which he helped to build when it was first constructed and then worked to rebuild after it was flooded during Katrina. With his parish church closed because of Katrina, he attended St. Augustine Church, where he sometimes performed with other jazz musicians and the choir. He also is a member of the Knights of St. Peter Claver. Badie has two sons, Emmanuel and Peter (deceased), and one daughter, Celeste Landry. He is pre-deceased by his wife, Odile Badie and his Son Peter Badie III."

A former soldier with the Royal Artillery between 1980 and 1987, he has since worked extensively as a journalist in combat zones, producing footage from conflicts in the Balkans, the Middle East, and Libya. In 2011, he was shortlisted for the PRX Bayeux TV report along with Marie Colvin, a war correspondent with The Sunday Times. On 22 February 2012 during the Syrian uprising, Conroy was injured while covering events from the Syrian city of Homs, a stronghold of Syrian opposition forces, after the building where he and other journalists were based was shelled by Syrian government forces. Marie Colvin and French photojournalist Remi Ochlik were killed in the attack, while Conroy was injured along with another journalist, French reporter Edith Bouvier of Le Figaro. Conroy suffered leg injuries in the attack and was subsequently smuggled out of the city and across the Syrian border to Lebanon. Avaaz coordinated the evacuation out of the city, but about twenty Syrian activists died during the evacuation operation. French President Nicolas Sarkozy described the killing of Colvin and Ochlik as an assassination. It is believed that the journalists were targeted. The editor of The Sunday Times said he believed his reporter had been targeted. Conroy later described the situation in Homs as an \"indiscriminate massacre\" and \"slaughter\" and compared it the Battle of Grozny during the First Chechen War."

  "text" : "Lieutenant-Colonel Percy William Woods DSO MC (8 November 1885 – 5 January 1937) was a decorated Australian army officer of the First World War. Woods was born in Sydney, New South Wales, the son of Frederick Woods of London and Isabel (née England) of Melbourne. In September 1914, Woods enlisted as a private in the Australian Imperial Force. He served in Egypt and was mentioned in dispatches. In February 1916, Woods was transferred to the 55th Battalion of the Australian Army. For his courage at the Battle of Fromelles in July 1916, he was awarded the Military Cross in the 1917 New Year Honours. He was promoted to Lieutenant-Colonel and was awarded the Distinguished Service Order in the 1918 New Year Honours for his leadership during the capture of Doignies, France. Upon returning home, he worked as a clothing manufacturer, but gassing from the war left him disabled by pulmonary fibrosis. In 1932, he applied for disability benefits, which were denied by the Repatriation Commission \"on the ground that his ill health was not due to war service.\" He appealed this decision, and multiple witnesses testified that Woods had been gassed on three occasions and yet had refused evacuation from the front line. His appeal was accepted and he was granted a pension, which was increased in 1933 when he became totally incapacitated. Woods died in Sydney of cerebrovascular disease in 1937. Among the mourners at his service were 42 members of the 55th Battalion."

He was the son of General War Commissioner Jens Lorentz Flor (1730-1806) and Maria Bolette Heegård (1752-1787). His father later bought Haugbu farm in Asker in Akershus and settled his family there. Flor completed his legal examination in 1792. He subsequently acted as an assistant to his father as a military auditor. In 1797, he served with the Asker Regiment (Akershusiske infanteriregiments) and in 1799 was a second lieutenant with the Vestre Laurvig Company (Vestre Laurvigske kompani). From 1806 to 1811, he managed the family farm at Asker. In 1816, he formed the newspaper Drammens Tidende together with Søren Tybring who was vicar of Bragernes Church in Drammen. He served as co-editor until 1817. Flor was elected a member of Norwegian Parliament from Drammen during the sessions 1818-20, 1821-23 and 1824-26. He served as an alternate representative 1842-44."

In 1803 he became pastor at Athens, New York. In 1806 he accepted the pastorate of St. John's English Lutheran Church in Philadelphia, the first exclusively English Lutheran congregation in the United States. He remained in this position until his death. He received the degree of D.D. from the University of Pennsylvania in 1823 and from Columbia in 1837. In 1804 he had refused to accept the same honor from Harvard on the ground that he was too young, and he also declined the provostship of the University of Pennsylvania in 1823. Mayer was active in benevolent enterprises in Philadelphia. In 1808 he was associated in the formation of the Pennsylvania Bible Society, the first institution of the kind in the United States, of which he was for many years an active manager and at the time of his death its presiding officer. He was for many years a trustee of the University of Pennsylvania. In 1817 he did much to establish the system of public education in Pennsylvania. For many years before his death he was president of the board of managers of the Institution for the Deaf and Dumb. In 1812 the ministerium of Pennsylvania appointed a committee to prepare a suitable collection of English hymns for public worship, to which was to be appended a liturgy, and Mayer was entrusted with this work. In 1833 a new and enlarged edition was issued, of which he again had charge. He published the sermon that he delivered at the 50th anniversary of his pastorate in Philadelphia."

  "text" : "Peter Laugesen (born 5 March 1942 in Copenhagen) is a Danish poet and playwright who lives in Arhus. Peter graduated from Aarhus Cathedral School in 1961 and trained as a typographer. He became a member of the Situationist International in 1962. He was attracted by the writing of Ivan Chtcheglov and contacted Jeppesen Victor Martin and participated in a Situationist exhibition in Denmark. He was then invited to France where he met Guy Debord and Michelle Bernstein and was attracted to the dérive as a poetic practice. He was also influenced by Alexander Trocchi and his book Cain's Book. He was expelled in 1963. because he refused to give up poetic practice. It was only later that he met Jørgen Nash with whom he became good friends. He published his first collection of poems, Landscape, in 1967. In 1992, Peter Laugesen received the Grand Prize of the Danish Academy. In 2003 he was awarded the Danish Critics Prize for Literature (Kritikerprisen). Since 1997 he has been a member of the Danish Academy. Laugesen has performed and released CDs with Mind Spray, Sing Vogel and Christian Vuust. He also contributes media and social commentary, in particular for Dagbladet Information. For many years Peter Laugesen collaborated with the author Dan Turèll who at one time lived next door. They subsequently continued their intense dialogue by letter, and also produced joint publications. In 1969, they participated both at Hindsgavl seminar in 1969 with Kristen Bjorn Kjaer, who also took part in joint publishing projects Bardo. Some of the texts from Hindsgavl seminar is preserved in a small folder. In addition, the two double-bonded by the Font that is an art book, rather than a collection of texts. Peter Laugesen has a humble, anarchistic approach to writing practice, with deep roots in Beat poetry, inspired by writers like Allen Ginsberg, Jack Kerouac and William Burroughs: the beautiful and the ugly cannot be separated but are interdependent. Peter Laugesen has applied his language skills to translation e.g. Tender Buttons by Gertrude Stein.

  "text" : "Paolo Grassi (Milan, Italy, 30 October 1919 - London, England, 14 March 1981) was an Italian theatrical impresario. As a young man, he worked in magazines and discovered a passion for the theater. It led him in 1937 to create a Bertoldissimo (musical work), which he oversaw and directed. He organized the theater company Ninchi-Dori-Tumiati and founded the avant-garde group Palcoscenico (Stage). Grassi was a Socialist. During the Second World War, he was conscripted into the army but went over to the Italian resistance movement, including working with the socialist newspaper Avanti!. In 1947, together with Giorgio Strehler, friend and associate, Grassi founded the Piccolo Teatro di Milano, the first Italian civic theater. It was later renamed, in his honor, the Teatro Paolo Grassi. In 1964, he purchased the Teatro San Ferdinando with Strehler, renaming it \"Teatrale Napoletana\". From 1972 to 1977 he was superintendent of the La Scala theatre, while from 1977 to 1980 held the post of president of Italy's state broadcaster RAI. He later became director of the Electa publishing house. Grassi died prematurely in London in 1981 following heart surgery, and is buried at the Monumental Cemetery of Milan. The Scuola d'arte drammatica Paolo Grassi (\"School of Dramatic Arts Paolo Grassi\") in Milan is named in his honour."

On his return, Petronas reportedly advised the emperor to pay more attention to the Crimea and its cities, where Byzantine control was loose. In reply, Theophilos raised him to protospatharios and appointed him strategos in Cherson, thus founding the theme of the same name. It may be possible that he also held the office of genikos logothetes, based on a seal found at Cherson."

  "text" : "Pieter van Coninxloo (c. 1460–1513) was an Early Netherlandish painter first documented as active in Brussels from 1479. Little is known of his life apart from his appearance in records of 1479, 1503 and 1513, in the archives of Margaret of Austria when he is mentioned in relation to the commission of portraits. He came from a family of artists; at least six generations were painters. His brother was Jan van Coninxloo. Van Coninxloo specialised in portraiture, and worked at different times for the Burgundian court. He is thought to have painted a c 1505 portrait, now in the Royal Collection at Windsor Castle, of Margaret of Austria commissioned by Philip the Good with the intention of sending it to Henry VII of England. He was employed in 1513 to paint portraits of the future Charles V and his sisters. Max Friedländer believes he may have been one of the most significant of the Brussels school painters before Bernard van Orley. However only a handful of his works have survived, and even these are tentatively attributed. He is sometimes associated with the unidentified artist known as the Master of the Legend of the Magdalen (Meister der Magdalenenlegende), thought to have been a court painter to Margaret of Austria, and who shares similarities of style, time and location. A number of art historians, including Max Friedländer, who first identified the Master of the Legend of the Magdalen, speculated that they may have been the same person. He may also have been a member of the master's workshop."

The council has the power to name the prime minister and control prime ministerial positions. Prayut is a former Commander in Chief of the Royal Thai Army, the post he held from October 2010 to October 2014. After his appointment as army chief, Prayut was characterised as a strong royalist and an opponent of former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra. Considered a hardliner within the military, he was one of the leading proponents of military crackdowns on the Red Shirt demonstrations of April 2009 and April–May 2010. He later sought to moderate his profile, talking to relatives of protesters who were killed in the bloody conflict, and co-operating with the government of Yingluck Shinawatra who won parliamentary election in July 2011. During the political crisis that began in November 2013 and involved protests against the caretaker government of Yingluck, Prayut claimed that the army was neutral, and would not launch a coup. Yet in May 2014, Prayut staged a military coup against the government and then assumed control of the country as NCPO leader. He later issued an interim constitution granting himself sweeping powers and giving himself amnesty for staging the coup. In August 2014, a military-dominated national legislature, whose members were handpicked by Prayut, non-democratically appointed him Prime Minister. After seizing power, Prayut launched crackdowns on dissent. He required all students in Thai schools to recite the \"twelve values\" as formulated by him. He has also banned public discussion about democracy and any criticism of his government, placing heavy restrictions on freedom of expression in Thailand."

Stonesong was the first company to cooperatively develop major popular reference books with well-known institutions and brand names, including Harvard University Medical School, The Library of Congress, The American Pharmaceutical Association, Lands End, ESPN, The American Film Institute, National Geographic and others. Several of the Stonesong reference titles won Notable Book Awards and Best Reference recognition from the American Library Association and others. Mr. Fargis edited and produced more than a dozen reference works with The New York Public Library, the best known being four editions of The New York Public Library Desk Reference. In addition, Fargis formed Round Stone Press in 1990 with two partners, Susan Meyer and Marsha Melnick. This imprint specialized in the development and production of illustrated reference works. The company was later renamed Grand Central Press, absorbed by The Stonesong Press and is no longer active. That company produced works with Reader's Digest, Woman's Day, The National Wildlife Federation, National Geographic, and National Public Radio. Fargis has worked in every area of trade book publishing including editorial, sales, publicity, royalty systems, contracts, and subsidiary rights. Prior to founding Stonesong, he was the Publisher and Editor in Chief of Thomas Y. Crowell Co. and Funk and Wagnalls, companies that became divisions of Harper and Row (now HarperCollins) where he then acted as Managing Director of the three imprints. Paul Fargis is a founding member and past President of The American Book Producers Association and The Charitable Book Program. He has acted as an expert witness in cases involving publishing disputes and has been a consultant to a number of firms and authors. He was a member of the American Book Council and has been an appraiser for the Internal Revenue Service concerning the fair market value of literary properties. Mr. Fargis is a graduate of Fairfield University (1961) and holds a Master of Arts degree in Education from the New York University Graduate Institute of Book Publishing. He is the author or editor of several books and articles. His bylined books include: \n* The Consumers Handbook (1966, 1974) \n* The New York Public Library Desk Reference (1989 et al.) \n* Perks and Parachutes \n* The Big Book of Life’s Instructions \n* Company’s Coming (1968) \n* I’m Writing My Own Cookbook (1978) \n* Life’s Little Destruction Book Shortly after receiving his Masters degree he joined Hawthorn Books as an editor and a year later became the American Editor of the 150-volume international Twentieth Century Encyclopedia of Catholicism. During that tenure he also acted as Managing Editor of Twentieth Century Catholicism, a short-lived periodical. Mr. Fargis sold Stonesong to his daughter Alison Fargis and Ellen Scordato who continue running the company today. Mr. Fargis now acts as a publishing consultant specializing in negotiating and interpreting publishing contracts and evaluating book proposals. After retirement, Mr Fargis became a licensed Home Improvement contractor in Westchester County, NY allowing him to pursue a lifelong love of carpentry and building. He holds a patent for an expandable folding device for printed material. And he has served on the Board of Directors of his church, the Unitarian Fellowship of Northern Westchester. Earlier he served as the Executive Director of the Harrison Town Recreation Commission, member of the Harrison Town Forum, on the Board of Directors of the United States Catholic Historical Society, on the Advisory Board of the Graduate School of Corporate and Political Communication at Fairfield University (1969 to 1981) Currently he is a crew member of the Katonah Bedford Hills Volunteer Ambulance Corps. He enjoys stonework and sculpture and is an avid hiker. Paul Fargis is married to the Reverend Dawn Sangrey, a Unitarian Universalist minister and author, and they have a son Christopher. He is also the father of Alison Fargis and John Fargis from an earlier marriage. He has four grandchildren."

He was born in a family of actors and actresses. His father, Bartolomeo Andolfati, was a Commedia dell'arte actor known for playing the role of Pantalone. His mother, and sisters were actresses, among the latter, Gaetana Goldóni Andolfati became also a well-known actress. His son, Giovanni Andolfati also became an actor. Pietro played the commedia dell'arte role of the amoroso or innamorati for the theater company of P. Rossi, later became lead comic figure and director by 1792 in the theater in the via del Cocomero in Florence, then director of the Accademia dei Filodrammatici a Milano. He also was an independent author of drams and translator of French and Spanish works to Italian. The Accademia Filodrammatica di Milano was in fact a theater company, but its theater building, designed by Polak and Canonica, promoted republican ideas, which by then were ascendant. It favored a natural equality for an audience, substituting private boxes with galleries. His colleagues in the theater circuit were Vincènzo Monti, Carlo Porta, and others. He also helped foster the careers of Francesco Righetti and Giuditta Pasta. The theater employed Andrea Appiani as a scenographer."

  "text" : "Paolo Monaldi (1710 – after 1779) was an Italian painter of the late-Baroque or Rococo style, known for painting Bambocciata, or genre scenes of public activities. Paolo Monaldi was born and died in Rome, and initially trained in the studio of Paolo Anesi. Monaldi worked under Anesi in the fresco decoration of the Villa Chigi, painted between 1765 and 1767. In particular, he contributed to the paintings depicting the myth of Diana and Endymion, and with Angelica and Medoro over a series of eight landscapes with bambocciate. Monaldi's rural scenes recall the work of the Anesi colleague, Andrea Locatelli, also active in Rome. He was also a painter for Palazzo Rospigliosi. Palazzo Braschi and the Accademia di San Luca. He even painted for the Chigi for their Roman villa, On the basis of the Lanzi, Stefano Ticozzi in his Dictionary of Painters by the renewing of Fine Arts until 1800, (1818) cites him as \"not ignoble painter bambocciate\""

Sturges was trained at Princeton before working with the firm The Providence Partnership. Heralded for his Mid-Century Modern style, Sturges was often praised for his buildings' sensitivity to site and context. The Rhode Island Historical Preservation Commission noted in their 1981 report that Sturges' Bonanza Bus Terminal was \"one of the most handsome complexes erected as part of urban renewal in the 1960s; it is particularly well suited to its site and lends an urbane note to the streetscape.\" The complex was demolished soon afterward. The Post Office in Bristol, built on a site formerly occupied by a house by famous Rhode Island Architect Russell Warren, incorporated features salvaged from the demolished Warren building in its design. Also in Bristol, his Old Stone Bank building incorporates reliefs by Hugh Townley in the facade design. Notable buildings include: \n* Bonanza Bus Terminal (1963) 1 Sabin Street, Providence (demolished) \n* US Post Office (1963) Hope Street, Bristol \n* Old Stone Bank (1965) Hope Street, Bristol (now Citizens Bank) \n* Biltmore Hotel renovations (1979) 1 Dorrance Street, Providence Sturges published his first book in 1995 and remained a prolific author until his death in 2005, publishing nearly one book per year. He is the author of HarperCollins' I Love... series, including I Love Trains, I Love Planes, I Love Trucks, I Love Tools, I Love Bugs, and I Love School."

The Bay Area was a motherland of new forms of video, performance and installation art. Paul Kos (together with his contemporaries Vito Acconci and Bruce Nauman) was one of the first artists to incorporate video, sound and interactivity into his sculptural installations. Kos is drawn to the integrity of materials, and in finding a place where material, play, chance and meaning can magically come together. For Kos, manipulation and participation are fundamental to art."

Mason has previously held positions at American University in Cairo and the Joan B. Kroc Institute for International Peace Studies at the University of Notre Dame. He has been interviewed and cited as an expert on Mormonism by outlets such as the Los Angeles Times, NPR, The Salt Lake Tribune, Religion Dispatches Magazine, and KPCC public radio in Pasadena, California. In January 2012, Mason published an opinion piece in The Washington Post regarding diversity within Latter Day Saints (LDS) thought. He was featured on New England Cable News(NECN) in May 2012 regarding the \"Mormon movement\" in Arkansas, and has been quoted in both the New York Times and the Los Angeles Times on Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney. Mason is also the author of The Mormon Menace: Violence and Anti-Mormonism in the Postbellum South which received positive reviews in the Journal of American History and the Journal of Southern Religion. He has also authored a number of articles and book chapters on Mormonism and American religion history. Mason's current research projects include a biography of LDS president Ezra Taft Benson and a book on a Mormon theology and ethic of peace. In 2016, Mason, who has advocated a more embracing LDS church, began a joint blog in a current-issues/events debate format, at the non-partisan religion website Patheos.com, with the social activist John P. Dehlin, who has often been critical of the LDS church."

  "text" : "Pietro Fabris (active 1740 – 1792) was a painter of Italian descent, active in England and Naples. Pietro is best known for work he completed for the dilettante geologist, the diplomat Sir William Hamilton, which included a number of engravings based on his paintings that depicted contemporary volcanic activity collected in two books, Observations on Mount Vesuvius, Mount Etna, &c. (London, 1774) and Campi Phlegraei: Observations on the Volcanoes of the Two Sicilies (Naples, 1776). He also painted some soires sponsored by Hamilton, including one that included a young Mozart at the harpsichord. In other works he produced for sale, he painted Bamboccianti scenes, genre paintings of local folk in native garb at work or play. The biography of Fabris is poorly documented. He is suspected to have been born in England to a Venice-trained stage set designer called Jacobo Fabris. Pietro, as a young man, was patronized by the diplomat Hamilton to accompany him and visually reproduce for him on his jaunts to visit the volcanic sites in Mount Etna, Mount Vesuvius, and Lipari islands. His paintings and drawings were exhibited in 1768 in the London Free Society and in 1772 in the London Society of Artists of Great Britain. Fabris became acquainted with painter Antonio Joli in Naples."

He held £1,000 stock in the East India Company, and was a member of the committee of the company from 1659 until his death. In 1659, Middleton was elected Member of Parliament for Weymouth and Melcombe Regis in the Third Protectorate Parliament. He was re-elected MP for the constituency in 1660, when he was involved in a double return to the Convention Parliament but was accepted by the House on 5 May. He was one of the five MPs who were authorised to raise a loan of £2,000 in the City of London and who then funded the loan from their own pockets after they met with some difficulty. They received the thanks of the House on 25 May. He was a commissioner for assessment for London from August 1660. He stood for Weymouth and Melcombe Regis in 1661 but was defeated. Middleton died at the age of about 58 and was buried at St. Dunstan in the East on 24 December 1661.

  "text" : "Priscilla Alden Copeland Reining (March 11, 1923 – July 19, 2007) was an American applied anthropologist. She was most remembered for her extensive work with the HIV/AIDS epidemic, especially on the African Continent. Priscilla Reining was the recipient of three anthropological degrees, from the University of Chicago. Reining's field of specialization was centered mainly on the sub-Saharan region of Africa. During a Sudanese uprising in 1955, Reining and her family fled the country having \"led a whole convoy of people.\" She worked for several years with the Haya people located in Tanzania in the early 1950s becoming one of the uppermost authorities on the village life of sub-Saharan peoples. One of her more notable studies was that of the Haya land tenure: We have examined the two forms of landholding and tenancy in the Haya system of land tenure. Although they co-exist, they have different bases, the one as an aspect of the traditional structure and the other as an aspect of the structure developing at the time of the study. The significance of each derives from the particular characteristics of Haya land which is valuable but limited in quantity. In the traditional structure, the land formed the base or medium through which the institution of clientship was expressed and some land is still held under this form of tenure. In the developing structure, the pressure on the land makes for heterogeneous arrangements, here considered under the rubric of the relatively new form of tenure. Reining also pioneered and implicated the Landsat imagery technology in the field of anthropology and other social sciences. However it was her work on HIV transmission in Africa that brought her most recognition within the anthropology community."

  "text" : "Paul Auguste Hariot (1854 – 5 July 1917), the son of Louis Hariot (also a pharmacist), was a French pharmacist and noted phycologist, best known for his 1900 publication Atlas Colorié des Plantes Médicinales Indigènes. Hariot took up the position of botanical assistant at the École Supérieure de Pharmacie in the late 1870s during his training in pharmacy in Paris. On qualifying in 1882, his rather quiet and studious life was changed by an invitation to accompany the botanist Émile Bescherelle (1828-1903) on an expedition to Cape Horn aboard the ship La Romanche, a trip during which he amassed a fine collection of algae. On returning to France he studied natural sciences and was awarded a degree in 1888 whereupon he joined the National Museum of Natural History in Paris, working in the cryptogamic herbarium under Professor van Tieghem. Here he worked on classifying specimens that had been gathered by Sébastien Vaillant (1669-1722), and those of the brothers Edmond and Charles Tulasne. He revised when necessary the taxonomy and systematics of the species described, and his name appears frequently as a second author for many species of algae. In 1890 he was awarded the Prix Montagne by the Academy of Sciences for his monograph on terrestrial algae of the genus Trentepohlia. He was awarded the Prix Desmazières for 1913 for his work on marine flora. Besides publishing a guide to phycology in 1892, he contributed to a number of illustrated books on plants, and published the first practical guide to seaweeds from the coast of France. Hariot's main interest was in algae and fungi, and later including the rusts. He was one of the founders of the Plant Pathological Society of France, and at the time of his death, was curator of the Cryptogamic Herbarium at the Jardin des Plantes. He is commemorated by Lagenophora hariotii (Franch.) T.R.Dudley, Chamaeangis hariotiana (Kraenzl.) Schltr.,Microterangis hariotiana (Schltr.) Senghas and Saxifraga hariotii Luizet & Soulié. The standard author abbreviation Har. is used to indicate this individual as the author when citing a botanical name."

  "text" : "Paul Borchardt (1886–1953) was a German archaeologist, a pupil of the geographer Siegfried Passarge. He is known for his theory that the mythical city of Atlantis was located in Tunisia. Borchardt argued that the Shott el Jerid swamp, generally thought to mark the site of Lake Tritonis, was in fact the original Atlantic Sea referred to by Plato. Borchardt also identified Mount Atlas as being a peak in the Ahaggar Mountains, rather than in the Atlas range. He related the names of Berber tribes to the names of Poseidon's sons in Greek mythology, and suggested links between the city of Atlantis, the palace of Alkinoös referenced in The Odyssey and the City of Brass in the tales of The Arabian Nights. He believed he had discovered Atlantean ruins at Qabes, but these ruins were later found to be of Roman origin. During World War II, Borchardt was incarcerated at Dachau, due to his Jewish ancestry. He escaped to Britain in 1939, and thence to the United States. He was arrested and put on trial for spying in 1941, and was sentenced to 20 years imprisonment. His early release was secured in 1952 due to petitioning from the German government, but he died less than a year afterwards."

  "text" : "Patricia Hendricks is a 7th dan aikido teacher and founder of Aikido of San Leandro. She is also the head of division one (the Iwama division) of the California Aikido Association and is the first \"menkyo kaiden\" in Saito's system of aiki-ken and aiki-jo.Patricia Hendricks as a 7th Dan, Shihan is one of the highest and most noted aikido instructors in the world. She teaches internationally and runs a full-time dojo in San Leandro, California. She has spent more than 7 years being uchideshi, living in dojos, primarily in Iwama, Japan under Morihiro Saito, a top student of the founder of aikido, Morihei Ueshiba. She is one of the closest students of Saito, with numerous appearances in Saito's books, as well appearing with him in magazine articles and as his uke on major demonstrations including the All Japan Demo held in Tokyo, Japan every year. She started studying aikido in June 1974 while a student at Monterey Peninsula College in Monterey, California. She had been interested in studying a martial art and found a course in aikido being offered that semester. The instructor was Mary Heiny, who was a Sandan at that time, and who had recently returned from studying in Japan. It was during that semester of study that she heard about Stan Pranin, who was teaching aikido to a small group of students in his garage in Monterey. She studied with Stan Pranin until 1977, at which time she and Stan Pranin both moved to Oakland to train with Bruce Klickstein and then with Bill Witt. Later that same year she moved to Iwama, Japan, where she became uchideshi and a student of Saito. She returned to Oakland in 1979 and continued studying at the same dojo.Over the next 28 years, she returned regularly to Iwama for brief and long term periods of study with Saito. During this time, she also earned her degree in Oriental Languages (with emphasis in Japanese) from U.C. Berkeley. In 1984, she founded the Aikido of San Leandro dojo. In 1988, she embarked on a 6-month European tour, combining travel and teaching, before once again returning to Iwama for study as a long-term uchideshi for another 18 months. At present, she is the Division 1 head of the CAA organization, and is authorized by Saito to conduct weapons testing. She was the first to be awarded Menkyo Kaidan by Saito Morihiro. She is one of the pioneering aikidoka for women."

With Sylvain Lévy, Alfred Foucher, Chavannes, Clément Huart, he learned Sankrit, Tibetan, Chinese, Arab.La Philosophie Comparée, his Sorbonne doctoral dissertation, attempted to apply Comtean positivism and a comparative method which identified 'analogies' between the philosophies of Europe, India and China.

He was a field marshal (chom phon) of the Royal Thai Army and minister of interior in the governments of military rulers Sarit Thanarat and Thanom Kittikachorn. Praphas graduated from the Chulachomklao Royal Military Academy and became an infantry officer. He was sponsored by Field Marshal and Prime Minister-to-be Sarit Thanarat. He was quickly promoted to higher ranks. In 1957, Sarit appointed him minister of interior, a position in which he continued to serve after Sarit's death in 1963. The new Prime Minister was Thanom Kittikachorn, whose son married Praphas' daughter. From 1963 to 1973, he was additionally deputy prime minister and Commander-in-Chief of the Royal Thai Army. During this time, Praphas was the strong man in the background who pulled the strings in the Thanom government. He was known for obscure financial transactions and political intrigues. In 1973, he was replaced as army commander by General Krit Srivara, which indicated his loss of influence. In October 1973 protests against the rigid military rule grew into a massive popular uprising that was answered by a bloody crackdown on the protesting students and democracy activists. The many dead civilists prompted King Bhumibol Adulyadej to intervene. Praphas, Thanom and his son Colonel Narong Kittikachorn went into exile. Praphas returned to Thailand in January 1977, after the military had ended the democratic interlude in October 1976. However, he was not able to exercise political influence again. Praphas Charusathien died on 18 August 1997 in Bangkok."

Mulkey was the second place American behind Rafer Johnson at the 1960 USA Outdoor Track and Field Championships which served as Olympic Trials. He failed to finish the 1960 Olympic competition, dropping out after the discus throw. Mulkey had been a competitor at the 1952 Olympic Trials finishing 17th as a high schooler from Purdy, Missouri and the 1956 Olympic Trials finishing 7th representing the University of Wyoming. Mulkey placed second at the 1959 Pan American Games behind Dave Edstrom. In 1961 he surpassed Vasili Kuznetsov's world record by scoring 8,727 points at the Southeastern AAU (the equivalent of USATF in the day) meet in his home town of Memphis, Tennessee, but the record was never ratified by the IAAF because the field was not approved. Mulkey competed for Memphis State College and then the University of Wyoming. He never quit the sport, moving from the open division into the early days of masters athletics. He competed at many Masters Athletics World Championships and set several world records as he progressed through the age groups. His M60 American Record was decertified as the American record after World Masters Athletics changed the implement specifications, but it remains the best mark. He coached his then girlfriend Philipa Raschker (Phil and Phil), one of the most successful Masters athletes ever. Both Phils each were named the 1993 and 1994 USATF Combined Athletes of the year. Now residing in Birmingham, Alabama, Mulkey has spent many years coaching at The Altamont School, with numerous state titles to his team's credits. Now the hurdle coach at Vestavia Hills High School."

The pieces are largely autobiographical, but also carry general themes about popular culture, fashion, health, and food.

In 1891 he was appointed associate professor of botany at the University of Poitiers, later relocating to Paris as a lecturer at the faculty of sciences. In 1921 he attained the title of professor in Paris. In 1887 he founded the scientific journal Le Botaniste. He was the member of several learned societies, such as the Académie des sciences (1917), the Société botanique de France (president 1914–18) and the Société mycologique de France. He was the circumscriber of the mycological genus Amoebophilus."

It is doubtful that he was actually an ordained priest, or merely in consequence of his office had to wear the ecclesiastical dress, but he received the name Abbé l'ainé, or simply l'Abbé. Later, he and his brother gave up their connection with the church and went to Paris, where they obtained engagements at the Grand Opera. They were both excellent players, but Philippe seems to have been the more celebrated of the two. He is the uncle of the violinist Joseph-Barnabé Saint-Sevin dit L'Abbé le Fils."

From his childhood, Peter Zorn studied the Greek language and by the age of fourteen he had translated several books. At eighteen, he went to the University of Leipzig at Wittenberg. He received his bachelor's degree in theology in 1705 in Rostock and published several polemical writings. He left Rostock, traveled to the Netherlands, returned to Germany and lived there two years where he gave lessons in Greek and antiquities. Upon leaving, he made an appearance in his hometown, accepted a place as rector of Plön, and remained there until trouble with the minister of the prince led him to resign. Hamburg then offered him a pension, but he remained there only a few years and accepted the invitations to Prussia. He became a professor of rhetoric and history at Stettin and in 1729 he was professor of ecclesiastical history. Finally, from Stettin, he went to Thorn, then in Prussia, but now the city of Torun in Poland. In addition to being rector and professor, he was also the town librarian."

  "text" : "Paul Fillunger (June 25, 1883 in Vienna – March 7, 1937 in Vienna) was an Austrian geotechnical engineer. Raised in a family of engineers, he studied at the Technische Hochschule in Vienna and took a position in the state-owned railway company in 1906. In 1908 he completed a PhD and then went to teach mathematics, machine industry and then mechanics at the University of Vienna. Fillunger pioneered the study of saturated ground and was made famous by an article published in 1913. He discovered the difference in behaviors of the effective and general stresses in samples of ground, opening the way for further research. He is considered to be a pioneer of the theory of liquid-saturated porous solids. Fillunger's theories put him in heated conflict with Karl von Terzaghi, who is often referred to as \"father of soil mechanics\", whom Fillunger was accused of slandering. The University blamed Fillunger, who then committed suicide by opening the gas jets in the bathroom with his wife."

  "text" : "Philip Hoffman (born December 10, 1955) is a Canadian filmmaker and a member of the faculty of York University. Hoffman was born December 10, 1955 in Kitchener, Ontario. He studied at Sheridan College, where he received a diploma in media arts in 1979, and Wilfrid Laurier University, where he received a B.A. in English literature in 1987. While a student at Sheridan College he became associated with a group of filmmakers known as the Escarpment School, other members of which included Richard Kerr and Mike Hoolboom. In 1986 he became an instructor at Sheridan College. In 1994, he started operating a summer film workshop, the Film Farm Retreat, at Mount Forest, Ontario, initially with support from Sheridan College. In 1999 he joined the York University Film and Video Department as a faculty member. He also has been a visiting professor at the University of Helsinki and University of South Florida. Hoffman has been described as \"filmmaker of memory and association\" whose \"highly personal\" work blends fiction and documentary and \"contests the claim to the truth\" that characterizes conventional documentary film. The San Francisco Cinematheque presented a retrospective of Hoffman's work in 2004, entitled \"Passing Through: A Philip Hoffman Retrospective\". The Canadian Film Institute presented a retrospective showing of his works in Ottawa in March and April 2008. A book, entitled Rivers of Time and consisting of an interview with Hoffman, \"essays and reflections\" on the filmmaker and his work, and images from his films, was issued to coincide with the retrospective. In 2016, Hoffman was awarded a Governor General's Award in Visual and Media Arts."

Peter Watson was a character who was mentioned on page 133 by W & T Fordyce (publishers) in The Tyne Songster published in 1840, in the song \"To Mr. Peter Watson - (Who lays powerful bats on the knaves with fire-shovel hats on)\", written by Henry Robson in Watson’s honour. It is not written in a Geordie dialect, but has a strong Northern connection. For centuries, the Government Clergy (i.e. Rector, vicar, or perpetual curate etc.) had the right to collect from each household in a Parish, “Easter Dues”. This was based on a set sum (in the early/middle nineteenth century it was at the rate of 4p per person), and the head of the household had the duty to pay this sum on behalf of every member resident in the property of the age of 16 or more. Peter Watson objected to this compulsory payment reasoning that “the claims were founded neither in the law or in the gospels”, and was duly summons (and jailed for a short time for non-payment) before the court judged that the collection of these under the Acts of William III were illegal, ruling that \"This act, or anything herein contained, shall not extend to any tythes, offerings, payments or oblations shall not extend….. …within any city or town where the same are settled by Act of Parliament\" It is therefore the British public who are indebted to him for the removal of this \"odious, unjust and oppressive clerical tax\". Nothing more appears to be known of this person, or his life."

  "text" : "Patrick \"Patt\" Lalor (1781–1856) was a political leader in Queen's County, Ireland in the 19th century and the father of revolutionary politicians James Fintan Lalor, Peter Lalor and Richard Lalor. He was the first Catholic elected to the House of Commons to represent Queen's County (1832-5) in over two centuries and a loyal supporter of the Repeal Association led by Daniel O'Connell. Patt Lalor first came to prominence as a leader of the resistance to tithes in Queen's County during the Tithe War 1831-36 when he refused to pay tithes to support the Church of Ireland and allowed his sheep to be confiscated as a result. Lalor declared at a public meeting in February 1831 in Maryborough that \"...he would never again pay tithes; that he would violate no law; that the tithe men might take his property, and offer it for sale; but his countrymen, he was proud to say, respected him, and he thought that none of them would buy or bid for it if exposed for sale. The declaration was received by the meeting in various ways: by many with surprise and astonishment; by others with consternation and dismay, but by a vast majority with tremendous cheering.\" Lalor held true to his word and did not resist the confiscation of 20 sheep from his farm, but was able to ensure no buyers appeared at subsequent auctions. Following Catholic Emancipation, he was elected to the House of Commons in 1832 but narrowly defeated in 1835. In his later years, he served as a justice of the peace for Queen's County and as a prominent member of the Tenant Right League supporting land reform. He died at his residence \"Tenakill\" near Mountrath on 10 April 1856 aged 75. Patt Lalor married Anne Dillon (died 4/6/1835), the daughter of Patrick Dillon of Sheane, and had 13 children. After her death, he married Ellen Mary Anne Loughnan with whom he had no children. His son Richard Lalor and great grandson John Lalor Fitzpatrick also represented Queen's County in the House of Commons. His first cousins included Alice Lalor (1769–1846), the American religious leader, Dr Joseph Lalor (1811-86) the reformist Medical Superintendent of the Richmond District Lunatic Asylum, and Joseph O'Lawlor (1768–1850) the Spanish general and military Governor of Granada."

  "text" : "Percy Shelley (1860-1937) was a major force in developing Shelley Potteries. He was born in Longton, Staffordshire. He attended Owen’s College, Manchester and then London University, where he gained a B.A. degree. In 1881, Percy joined his father, Joseph, at Wileman & Co. pottery. Percy had not received any formal training in pottery, but became known first and foremost as a potter and went on to develop the lasting reputation of Shelley China. Wanting to improve the ware that the company was producing and to get a better understanding of the export market, especially America, Percy went to the U.S.A. and visited the 1893 Chicago Exhibition. In June 1896, his father, Joseph, died and he took over control of the business. To improve the ware he brought in artists and designers who he felt could (and did) change the company. The two best known were Rowland Morris and Frederick Alfred Rhead. Percy married in 1890 and his son Percy Norman was born in 1893 and a year later twin boys, Vincent Bob and Kenneth Jack were born. Norman and Bob joined their father in the business just before the start of the 1st W.W. After the war they were joined at the factory by their brother Jack who had completed his university course. Each son was to take charge of an area of the company and build on the growing reputation that their father had started. In 1932, Percy retired to Bournemouth and died in 1937."

  "text" : "Petros Peloponnesios (\"Peter the Peloponnesian\") or Peter the Lampadarios (c. 1735 Tripolis–1778 Constantinople) was a great cantor, composer and teacher of Byzantine and Ottoman music. He must have served as second Domestikos between his arrival about 1764 until the death of Ioannes Trapezountios, and it is assumed that he became Lampadarios (leader of the left choir) between 1770 and 1778 at the Great Church of Constantinople, after Daniel the Protopsaltes became Archon Protopsaltes. Large parts of the monodic chant sung in several current traditions of Orthodox Chant are transcriptions of his compositions, which he had written down as a teacher of the \"New Music School of the Patriarchate\"."

  "text" : "Paul Christian Frank (28 November 1879–21 February 1956) was a Norwegian barrister, politician, organizer and non-fiction writer. He was born in Kristiania (present-day Oslo, Norway). He was CEO of the trade association Norges Handelsstands Forbund from 1920 to 1952. Frank is particularly remembered for his tireless agitation against governmental price controls. He was decorated Knight, First Class of the Order of St. Olav in 1946, Knight of the Order of the Dannebrog, Knight of the Order of the Polar Star and Commander of the Order of Vasa. During the occupation of Norway by Nazi Germany, Frank was imprisoned in Møllergata 19 from June to July 1941, then in Grini concentration camp from 12 September 1941 to 26 November 1942. He was arrested a third time in June 1944; after a month in Åkebergveien he was incarcerated in Grini from July to August 1944. He had endeavored to keep Norges Handelsstands Forbund from being usurped by the Nazis. His organization was one of forty-three to protest nazification attempts on 15 May 1941, in a letter addressed directly to Reichskommissar Josef Terboven. This protest of the 43 was met with harsh reactions; by 12 June 1941 an arrest order had been issued on Frank's fellow signatory from Norges Handelsstands Forbund, Erling Steen. On 18 June six more protesters were arrested, including Frank. Frank died in Oslo in 1956."

He is said to have been personal physician to Pope Innocentius X and Pope Alexander VII. Zacchias was also legal adviser to the Rota Romana, the highest Papal court of appeals, and head of the medical system in the Papal States. His most well known book, Quaestiones medico-legales (1621-1651) established legal medicine as a topic of study. Zacchias was at the cutting edge of medical pursuit in his time, arguing that poison, infection, and disease were all transmittable through smell: \"We have a thousand and one examples of living beings that have been infected by olfaction alone ... We see many people every day who fall into a serious or very serious state because of good or bad odors.\" Zacchias work also contains superstitious views on magic, witches, and demons which were widely held at the time. He is known to have argued that minors make proper test subjects to be put to torture. Despite these consequences, Zacchias is seen to have radically progressed the works of jurisprudence in medicine of his time."

  "text" : "Paula Hounslea was a British victim of an unsolved murder. She had been missing since 22 August 2009, and her body was later found in a fire pit on the loop line cycle path in Fazakerley, Liverpool on 5 May 2010 by a dog walker. The body was identified using Hounslea’s medical and dental records. Police have launched a murder inquiry and hope to speak to anyone who saw someone matching Hounslea's description either on the day of her disappearance or since, Hounslea was 37 at the time of her disappearance and was white, around 5 ft 8ins tall, of medium build and had blonde or light brown shoulder-length hair when last seen she was wearing a grey jumper, with possibly a pink cardigan over the top, dark jeans and a gold Madonna pendant necklace and it is thought that she had three small bags of clothes with her. Hounslea disappeared the morning after a family meal after telling her daughter she was staying with a friend for a few days, the alarm was raised when it was discovered she had not stayed with the friend and had not called her parents which was unusual, she has been described as bi-polar and was not in the greatest health. Although at the time of the disappearance she was not working it was thought she might be working somewhere else having had experience as a bar tender and seamstress. It was known that Hounslea's cash card had been used to withdraw money on separate occasions in the days following her disappearance and that perhaps an attempt had been made to phone a friend but problems with the phone meant that she was unable to connect and she attempted to book a room at a local hotel but did not arrive. The case remains open On 13 June 2012, Hounslea's daughter Lois and her boyfriend Kevin Kavanagh then aged 21 and 20 respectively, were arrested on suspicion of murder  and released on bail the next day, the house Lois shared with her mother was sealed off for forensic examination."

  "text" : "Panama Joe Gans was a black boxer who was the penultimate holder of the World Colored Middleweight Championship. Born Cyril Quinton on 14 November 1896 in Barbados, British West Indies and raised in the Panama Canal Zone, the 5'7\" Quinton originally fought out of Panama and then New York City. He named himself after African American boxing great Joe Gans, the first black fighter to win a world boxing title. He fought at between 147 and 160 lbs. Panama Joe won the Lightweight Championship of Panama and the Middleweight Championship of South and Central America. On December 12, 1916, though barely twenty-one years old, he soundly defeated Abraham Jacob Hollandersky, a former holder of the Panamanian Heavyweight Championship, in 20 rounds in Panama City. Panama Joe won the World Colored Middleweight Championship from George Robinson in Madison Square Garden on October 8, 1920. It was the first time two black boxers were featured on a fight card at the Garden. He defended the title thrice in 1923, racking up no decisions (and thus keeping his title) against Whitey Black on May 14 in Detroit and against Tiger Flowers in Toledo, Ohio on May 25. He knocked out Willie Walker via a 9th round K.O. in New York City on June 30. He lost his title to Larry Estridge in a fight at Yankee Stadium on July 26, 1924. Estridge successfully defended the title against Gans at Queensboro Stadium in Long Island City, Queens, New York on August 11 of that year. It was his sole title defense. The title went into abeyance after Tiger Flowers became the first black boxer to win the world middleweight championship when he defeated Harry Greb in 1926."

  "text" : "Pong Tiku (also spelled Pontiku and Pongtiku; 1846 – 10 July 1907), known among his Buginese allies as Ne' Baso, was a Torajan leader and guerrilla fighter who operated in southern Sulawesi, part of modern-day Indonesia. The son of the lord of Pangala', after Tiku captured the neighbouring kingdom Baruppu' he became its leader, later ruling Pangala' after his father's death. By exploiting the coffee trade and allying with the lowlands Buginese, Tiku was able to obtain large amounts of wealth, land, and power. During the Coffee War (1889–1890), his capital at Tondon was razed by another lord, but retaken the same day. When the Dutch colonials, based in Java, invaded Sulawesi in the early 1900s, Tiku and his soldiers utilised fortresses to withstand and launch attacks. Captured in October 1906, in January 1907 he escaped and remained at large until June. He was executed several days later. Tiku was the longest lasting resistance leader in Sulawesi, such that Governor-General J. B. van Heutsz considered him damaging the stability of Dutch control over the region and dispatched the Governor of Sulawesi to oversee his capture. Since his death, Tiku has been used as a symbol of Torajan resistance. Long commemorated in Sulawesi, he was officially declared a National Hero of Indonesia in 2002."

  "text" : "Phillip Bennion (born 7 October 1954) is a British Liberal Democrat politician. He sat as a Member of the European Parliament for the West Midlands, having replaced Liz Lynne after she stepped down in February 2012. Bennion was born in Tamworth, Staffordshire and educated at Queen Elizabeth Grammar School. He went on to study agriculture and agronomy at Aberdeen and Newcastle. After returning to Staffordshire to run his family farm, he gained a second degree, in history and economic history, from the University of Birmingham. He served as a councillor on Lichfield District Council from 1999 to 2011, and he has unsuccessfully contested four general elections, including Tamworth in 2005 and Telford in 2010. Bennion advised Charles Kennedy on agricultural issues during his leadership of the Liberal Democrats. Bennion went on to serve on the party's federal policy committee for eight years. He was second on the party list for the West Midlands constituency at the 2009 European Parliament election, but the party's 12% share of the vote entitled them to only one seat. When Liz Lynne stepped down in February 2012, electoral rules meant that Bennion, as the next Liberal Democrat candidate on the list, took her seat. He stood for re-election in 2014 and was placed top of his party's list of candidates, but he lost his seat as the Liberal Democrats polled 5.6% of the vote which was not enough to secure one of the West Midlands' seven seats."

  "text" : "Peter J. Hooge (July 5, 1886 – April 13, 1963) was a lawyer, judge and political figure in Saskatchewan. He represented Rosthern from 1944 to 1948 in the Legislative Assembly of Saskatchewan as a Liberal. He was born in Winkler, Manitoba, the son of Johann Hooge, a farmer of Dutch descent who had come to Canada from Russia. Hooge was educated in Winkler, in Gretna and at the University of Manitoba, where he received a LLB degree. He taught school in Altona, Manitoba and Herbert, Saskatchewan. Hooge was called to the Saskatchewan bar in 1914 and went on to practise law in Saskatoon, Leader and Rosthern. He married Margaret Matchuk in 1917.

From 1976 to 1980 he was a part of Nordli's Cabinet as State Secretary in the Office of the Prime Minister. He was known as one of the closest allies of party secretary Haakon Lie, and was accused of being instrumental in the political surveillance of socialists and communists in Norway during the Cold War, however, he strenuously denied this and nothing was proven. From 1980 to 1983, Engstad was a press and cultural counsellor at the Norwegian embassy in Tel Aviv, Israel. He issued a travel handbook on Israel in 1990. He chaired the friendship association Friends of Israel in the Norwegian Labour Movement (Norwegian: Venner av Israel i Norsk Arbeiderbevegelse). After serving at the embassy in Israel, he was the secretary-general in the association Folk og Forsvar, which promotes the public understanding of military affairs, until his retirement in 1992. He also edited their magazine Folk og Forsvar, and continued to do so for some time after retiring. He also wrote several books, such as the 50-year history of Framfylkingen in 1984 and the 100-year history of the Norwegian Officers' Union in 1996. He also wrote two books about Trygve Bratteli, in 1984 (together with Guttorm Hansen) and 1987, and issued a collection of Bratteli's speeches in 1985. Engstad died in 2012."

  "text" : "Petrus Petri (also Pedro Pérez) (c. 1220 – 1291) was a thirteenth-century Spanish master architect. For centuries it was held with complete certainty that he was the first master architect of the Cathedral of Toledo, based on the only existing testimony regarding the authorship, a legend inscribed in vulgar Latin still visible on a tombstone in the church Petrus Petri, deceased in 1291, master of the church of Saint Mary of Toledo, whose fame was propagated by his good examples and customs, who constructed this temple and rests here, for what an admirable building he made, he will not feel the wrath of God. Towards the middle of the 20th century, the bishop of Ciudad Real thoroughly investigated this claim and brought to light a series of documents which demonstrated the existence of a first master prior to Petrus Petri called Master Martín, married to María Gómez and certainly of French origin, who had been summoned by Ximénez de Rada. One of the documents is dated to 1227 and names \"a master Martín of the work of Saint Mary of Toledo\". Another document lists income collected by the cathedral in 1234 and records again the name of \"Master Martín of the work\", of whom it is also written that he was a tenant of a house associated with the cathedral. In later writings there appear the names of Martín (stonemason) and Juan Martín (master of stonemasons), who are believed to be relatives of each other. No new documents have appeared, so at present this master Martín is accredited as the first architect. To this argument it must be added that the date of the beginning of construction does not correlate with the age of Petrus Petri who during those years must have been too young to be an architect. Studies released after this discovery indicate that the master Martín would be the designer of the chapels of the ambulatory and upon his departure by death or by absence the supervision of the work was taken up by master Petrus who finished the ambulatories and constructed the triforia in Toledan style. Towards the end of the 20th century, the sanctuary and two sections of the naves of the south side were completed. It is known that Petrus Petri also worked on the Old Cathedral of Salamanca, discussed in the Archives of the Cathedral of that city, where he also worked with Florín de Pituenga, Casandro Romano, Alvar García, Pedro de la Obra, Juan el Pedrero, Sancho Pedro and Juan Franco."

Koppel was born on January 15, 1918 (2 Shvat 5678 on the Hebrew calendar) in the town of Turek in central Poland. He emigrated with his parents to Israel in 1924. At the age of 15, he volunteered for the Haganah, served in the Notrim Police Force as a Rav Semel (Sergeant Major) on various missions in the Tirat Shalom and Rosh Pinna areas. He served as commander of the Mishmar Hana (Mobile Guards) as well as under Orde Wingate. He graduated the first officers course of the Haganah in 1939, and in 1941, after the outbreak of the Second World War, he volunteered in the British Army and served on various fronts. In 1946, he was discharged with the rank of sergeant major and joined the Dan Transportation Cooperative (now the Dan Bus Company) as a bus driver. He continued to be a member of the Haganah, and in 1947 he joined the permanent staff of the Haganah and served as an instructor. In the Israel War of Independence, he was a convoy commander in Operation Nachshon. He served in the 7th Armored Brigade as a deputy commander and as a commander, and took part in the battles of Latrun. Koppel left the army in 1950 as a major and transferred to the General Security Service. In 1953, with the establishment of the Israel Border Police, Kopel was appointed as the force's first commander. In May 1964, he was appointed to succeed Yosef Nachmias as Inspector General (also called Commissioner General) of the Israel Police after Nachmias had announced his resignation. His term as Inspector General began on 1 July of that year. He held this post until 1972. After his service in the police force, settled in Kfar Bin Nun. After retiring from the police force, he served as chairman of the commission of inquiry established to investigate the circumstances of the Munich Olympics massacre. He also served as president of the Israel Football Association. He died on November 5, 1997 (5 Cheshvan 5758) and was buried in the Police cemetery on Mount Herzl in Jerusalem. The Israel Border Police Heritage and Commemoration Center (Hebrew: מרכז המורשת וההנצחה של משמר הגבול‎‎‎), near Barkai, is named for him."

  "text" : "Patrick Boyle (1832 - 1 August 1901) was a printer and publisher in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Boyle was born in Newport, County Mayo, Ireland, in 1832. In 1844 he and his family emigrated to the United States, moving two years later to Toronto, Canada. From the early 1850s he worked as a printer at the Globe - then run by George Brown - and afterwards for the Catholic Citizen. He worked briefly at his trade in New York and New Orleans but had returned to Canada at the start of the American Civil War. In January 1863 Boyle launched the Irish Canadian, a response to contact with the Irish nationalist paper, Phoenix, sectarianism in Toronto between Irish emigrants, and his personal fury at British colonialism in Ireland. The Irish Canadian was held to be a mouthpiece of the Hibernaian Benevolent Society of Canada, a working-class association of which Boyle was secretary. He agitated for Home Rule, the political advancement of Irish Catholics in Canada, as well as Irish rights in Canada and in Ireland. In 1892 it had the largest circulation of any Catholic newspaper in Ontario. Despite his sympathies for the Fenian movement, Boyle, through his paper, opposed any Irish invasion of Canada. His failure to fully distance himself from the movement led to a break between him and Irish-Canadians headed by Thomas D'Arcy McGee, James George Moylan, and Archbishop John Joseph Lynch. Jim O'Neill's Fenian invasion in 1866 led to further tensions, not improved by Boyle's assumption of the presidency of the Hibernians after the arrest of Michael Murphy. Boyle was arrested in April 1868 in the aftermath of the assassination of D'Arcy McGee, remaining in jail for three months with his brother-in-law and co-publisher, James E. Hynes. The failure of the Fenian cause led him in 1872 to align with John O'Donohoe and the cause of Reform. Yet his criticism of clerical interference in politics led to verbal blows with Archbishop Lynch, a withdrawal of support from the Liberals, and by 1878 backing of the Conservatives. By 1887 Boyle had ceased backing the Conservatives in the aftermath of their 1886 'no popery' campaign. From then on he left religious questions alone, seeking purely political objectives. Nevertheless, 1888 saw further hostilities erupt between Boyle and Lynch, who died in May before a resolution of the matter. Boyle died in Toronto in 1901, survived by his unmarried daughter, Harriet. A fund was set up for her by both friends and long-time rivals. Mark McGown summed him up as follows: Boyle’s lifelong fight for Irish Catholic rights enhanced the political influence of his community and had a long-term impact on Catholics as their Irishness faded. An effective organ of ethno-religious and political opinion, his Irish Canadian not only provided strong foundations for contemporary Catholic journalism, but forced Canadian political parties to recognize the emergence of a Catholic presence in English Canada.— Mark McGown,"

Penny journals were the popular medium of the period. The engraving, based on a watercolour portrait by Frederic William Burton, was accompanied by a three-page article, by George Petrie, on the piper’s life and character. This media exposure resulted in an unprecedented level of national fame for any folk musician and, as a result, Conneely was sought out by patrons, musicians and collectors of Irish music such as piper Lord Rossmore, the Hudson brothers and William Forde.\" Collector Henry Hudson (1798-1889) collected the greatest number of Conneely's tunes, his music manuscripts are now house in the National Library of Ireland, the Boston Public Library, and the University of Notre Dame's library. Other collectors included Lord Rossmore, James Petrie, William Forde. Conneely was supported by James Hardiman, who presented Conneely with his pipes, made in the 1820s. His likeness was made in a pencil sketch by Sir Frederic William Burton. Upon his death, his two sons were taken into care by the Christian Brothers."

  "text" : "Patrick Flannery (died 1855, New York), Irish piper. Flannery was a native of Aughrim, County Galway, four miles west of Ballinasloe town. Being blind, he was given the uilleann pipes as a means of earning a living. The lament The Battle of Aughrim (commemorating the Battle of Aughrim which occurred in his home village in July 1691, was his signature tune. He taught it to his pupil, John Coughlan (piper), and his nephew, William Madden (piper) of Ballinasloe. He emigrated to New York in 1845 with the Coughlan family and his nephew, William, where he died in 1855. According to O'Neill \"He was well along in years when he came to America, about 1845 and as he had no family, he lived for years with Mr. James Quinn (piper) in New York City. Money was showered on him as he played in the streets, so keen was the appreciation of his wonderful music, which we can well believe was voluminous as well as melodious. Flannery died while playing The Bucks of Oranmore before an audience on the streets of Brooklyn in 1855. He had no family, and was survived by his nephew. O'Neill said of his pipes: \"Concerning his splendid instrument the statement of Michael Egan to Mr. Burke is of unique interest: “I made his pipes in Liverpool. I made him a good instrument, and the right man got it. It made a great name for him and also for me. Until I made Flannery’s pipes, there was no more thought of my pipemaking than there was of Michael Mannion’s of Liverpool, or Maurice Coyne’s of Dublin.” The renowned piper had lived at least ten years in America, and taking into consideration his advanced age on arrival, we can safely assume that his birth may be dated a score or so years back into the eighteenth century. Flannery’s grand set of pipes, in which Mr. Egan, their maker, took so much pride, became the property of Mr. Quinn, his friend, who honored the old minstrel with a decent burial. Ald McNurney, into whose hands they passed subsequently, found them too large for convenience, so he traded them for a more suitable instrument to Bernard Delaney, who can wake the echoes with them again, although they are far below modern concert pitch."

  "text" : "Peter Kelly (1837 – 1 April 1910) was an Irish piper. Kelly was born in the town of Galway but blinded in infancy.

When aged about thirty he moved to Glasgow with fiddler John Crockwell, where he married and had nine children. He was survived upon his death by his widow and three children. O'Neill said of him: \"This ideal old minstrel was a well-known figure for many years in the vicinity of the Jamaica and Albert bridges, and opposite the Queen Street Station, but instead of sitting down while playing he stood upright, resting his right leg above the knee on a short crotched stick so as to manipulate his instrument successfully. He had the reputation of being a particularly skilful and sweet player, and Mr. Henderson, the famous bagpipe maker who made his reeds, speaks in very high terms of his capabilities as a musician. Kelly played all his music by ear, and so quick was he in picking up a tune, that if he heard it played, sung, or whistled once, he could repeat it on the pipes without making a mistake. His favorite melodies were The Coolin and The Blackbird\" \"Very often he was accompanied by another blind man named Smith, who played the flute, and the two were looked upon as inseparable cronies, and both were equally fond of their pint of porter, though by no means drunkards. Kelly was at his usual stand on the Albert bridge on the Saturday evening preceding his death from pneumonia four days later.\" \"Dire want drove his widow to a pawnshop with the pipes shortly after, and the generous ( ?) pawnbroker said, had not the chanter been worn nearly through by the finger marks he could afford to have given much more than the ten shillings he allowed her.\""

Much of his Friulian poetry was based around the middle class dialect of Udine, where he spent much of his life. His most famous poem is Plovisine. Zorutti was fascinated by the romantic poets, and this earned him praise from writers such as Tommaseo and Carducci, but harsh criticism from other members of the new Friulian poets after World War II, including Pier Paolo Pasolini who regarded him as an old writer and unable to possess poetic character."

He also became chairman of the Young Unionists. King was suggested as a possible UUP candidate in the South Antrim by-election, 2000, but the party instead stood David Burnside. In 2001, he was part of a group of anti-agreement UUP members who met with John de Chastelain of the Independent International Commission on Decommissioning. During the previous mandate of the Northern Ireland Assembly, King was a Special Advisor to the First Minister of Northern Ireland.

From 1834 to 1861 he taught classes in physics and natural history in Haguenau. With botanist Friedrich Wilhelm Schultz (1804–1876), he was co-author of Archives de la flore de France et d'Allemagne. Billot's Annotations a la flore de France et d'allemagne (1855) was issued with Flora galliae et germaniae exsiccata, a series which after his death in 1863 was continued by other scientists under the title of \"Billotia\". Today his herbarium is kept at the Muséum d'histoire naturelle in Nantes. The standard author abbreviation Billot is used to indicate this individual as the author when citing a botanical name."

He was Secretary for Lands and Minister for Forests from 1920 to 1922 and from 1925 to 1926, and deputy leader of the Labor Party from 1923 to 1926, when he resigned from the party. He ran as an independent candidate in 1930, during which time he was working as a proofreader for the Goulburn Evening Post, and in 1932 ran for Goulburn as a United Australia Party candidate, winning election. He was defeated in 1935. After his defeat Loughlin farmed in the Carcoar and Mandurama districts before retiring to Pennant Hills in the 1950s. Loughlin died at Hornsby in 1960."

  "text" : "(This is a Chinese name; the family name is Huang.) Peter Wen-shiung Huang (Chinese: 黃文雄; pinyin: Huáng Wénxióng; Pe̍h-ōe-jī: N̂g Bûn-hiông, also known as Peter Ng; born October 2, 1937) is a Taiwanese activist for democratization and human rights. Huang majored in journalism at the National Chengchi University in Taipei and then served in the military for two years. In 1964, he applied to the graduate program in Sociology at the University of Pittsburgh and studied there before transferring to a Ph.D. program at Cornell University in 1966. On April 24, 1970, Huang and his brother-in-law, Cheng Tzu-tsai, both members of the World United Formosans for Independence, were involved in the assassination attempt of then-Vice Premier Chiang Ching-kuo (Chiang Kai-shek's son) in New York City. Huang approached Chiang with a gun at the Plaza Hotel, but a Diplomatic Security Service special agent pushed him out of the way, causing the bullet to strike the hotel's revolving doors. The World United Formosans for Independence later issued a statement disclaiming involvement. He pleaded guilty in a 1971 trial to charges of attempted murder and illegal possession of a firearm, but was granted bail before sentencing, and fled the United States. Cheng Tzu-tsai also jumped bail in 1971 after his conviction, fleeing to Sweden for asylum, but was extradited to the US in 1972, sentenced in 1973 to up to five years in prison and later served an additional prison term in Taiwan for illegal entry. Huang's action is considered a stimulus for political reform in Taiwan, which promotes the role of Taiwanese people in the political arena. He was in hiding for 25 years, returning to Taiwan in 1996, after Taiwan's statute of limitations had run out on further prosecution for the assassination attempt as one of the last persons who had not been permitted to return to Taiwan for political reasons. Huang was prosecuted and served four months in jail for violating the 1987 National Security Law for illegal entry, since he did not have an entry visa when he returned to Taiwan in 1996. In 1998, Huang became the director of the Taiwan Association for Human Rights. In 2000, he was appointed as National Policy Advisor to the President for human rights issues. He is also an avid supporter of the Green Party Taiwan since its founding. Huang led Amnesty International Taiwan from 2009 through 2013. In 2012, he was given an Alumni Excellence Award by the National Chengchi University for his lifelong commitment to democracy, freedom, and social movements."

  "text" : "Sir Peter Birkett is a British educator and entrepreneur, who until December 2013 was the CEO of UK and Europe for GEMS Education.Birkett was Knighted in the 2012 Birthday Honours for services to further education and the academy movement. In October 2013, Barnfield Federation came under investigation by the Department for Education and the Skills Funding Agency for 'grade massaging,' whilst the Luton branch of the National Union of Teachers (NUT) expressed concern that the federation might have tried to take on too many schools too quickly. In November 2013 Birkett collected the national Education Investor award for the best performing \"School operator – academy chain\" on behalf of Barnfield Federation. In December 2013, Birkett resigned from GEMS Education UK, saying that the Department for Education investigation of the Barnfield Federation had \"achieved prominence in the press\" to stop the issue becoming \"an undue distraction for my colleagues and the work of GEMS Education.\" In Oxfordshire, his resignation led to concerns about GEMS Learning Trust, the not-for-profit arm of GEMS Education Solutions which had been selected to run schools on a new estate. A spokeswoman however said that Birkett had no responsibility for GEMS Learning Trust. In February 2014 the BBC claimed to have seen a Skills Funding Agency report into Barnfield College including details of Birkett's resignation settlement. The final report -a review of the management and governance at Barnfield Federation was published the same month and found \"evidence of significant financial irregularity together with breaches of the Academies Financial Handbook, the Funding Agreement, Charity Commission regulation and the Companies Act 2006.\" It also noted items of academies’ expenditure which were \"irregular and improper, not for the purpose intended and do not provide value for money of public funds.\" However the names of all individual directors and local firms in the report were redacted. The BBC report said that the college had wrongly claimed almost £1m for “students it could not account for” and that the terms of Birkett’s resignation constituted improper use of funds. In January 2015 Birkett once again denied responsibility for the problems at Barnfield college saying it was in fact an example of “good practice” though Luton MP Gavin Shuker claimed he had starved the college of resources. The academy chain was split up. As of 2015, Birkett has become managing director of p5e."

He was also an amateur poet and translator. Shirinsky-Shikhmatov came from a Tatar princely family that could trace its lineage to Genghis Khan. He served with distinction in the Russian Navy during the Napoleonic Wars. As a protégé of admiral Alexander Shishkov he followed his mentor from the navy to the ministry of education. Boasting that he was but \"a blind tool of his emperor's will\", he sought to increase the number of university students who were of noble origin at the expense of commoners. He believed that it was the nobility's duty to rule Russia. Shirinsky-Shikhmatov's most durable achievement was the Archaeographic Commission set up in 1834 to oversee the publication of medieval archives and chronicles. It continues under a different name to this day."

  "text" : "Peter K. Vogt (March 10, 1932 in Broumov, Czechoslovakia) is an American molecular biologist, virologist and geneticist. His research focuses on retroviruses and viral and cellular oncogenes. Vogt received his undergraduate education in biology at the University of Würzburg and in 1959 was awarded his Ph.D. at the University of Tübingen for work done at the Max Planck Institute for Virology in Tübingen. From 1959 to 1962 he was Damon Runyon Cancer Research Fellow in the laboratory of Harry Rubin at the University of California in Berkeley and started work on Rous sarcoma virus. He taught microbiology and molecular biology to medical and graduate students at the University of Colorado in Denver (1962–1967) and the University of Washington in Seattle (1967–1971). In 1971, he joined the University of Southern California as Hastings Professor of Microbiology and in 1980 assumed the chairmanship of the Department of Microbiology at the School of Medicine. Since 1993, he has been a Professor at The Scripps Research Institute in La Jolla. He became Executive Vice President and Chief Scientific Officer at Scripps in 2012. At the beginning of his scientific career, Vogt studied mechanisms of retroviral cell entry and the role of viral surface proteins in determining host range. He defined related groups of viral surface proteins and their corresponding receptors on the cell surface. During his time in Seattle, his focus shifted to the genetics of retroviruses. Together with his associate Kumao Toyoshima, he isolated the first temperature sensitive mutants of a retrovirus and in collaboration with the biochemist Peter Duesberg discovered the first retroviral oncogene, src. His work on mutants of the Rous sarcoma virus enabled Michael Bishop and Harold Varmus to isolate DNA sequences that represent the src oncogene and to demonstrate the cellular origin of oncogenes. In his extensive studies on avian retroviruses, Vogt discovered oncogenes that play important roles in human cancers, e.g. myc (in collaboration with Bister and Duesberg), jun (with Maki and Bos) and p3k (with Chang). Vogt has received the Irene Vogeler Prize (1976), the Alexander von Humboldt Award (1984), the Ernst Jung Prize for Medicine (1985), the Robert J. and Claire Pasarow Award (1987), the Paul Ehrlich and Ludwig Darmstaedter Prize (1988), the Bristol Myers Award (1989), the Charles S. Mott Prize (1991) and the Albert Szent Györgyi Prize (2010). He holds an honorary doctorate from the University of Würzburg (since 1995) and has been elected to several academies, including the National Academy of Sciences USA, the American Philosophical Society, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the German National Academy of Sciences Leopoldina and the American Academy of Microbiology. He is on several scientific advisory and editorial boards, e. g. the Sidney Kimmel Foundation for Cancer Research (since 2005), the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, USA (since 2000) and Current Topics in Microbiology and Immunology (since 1967). Vogt is also an avid painter. During his time in Würzburg, he studied with the artist Josef Versl."

  "text" : "Pierre Jean-Baptiste Legrand d'Aussy (3 June 1737 - 6 December 1800) was a French antiquarian and historian, who introduced the terms menhir and dolmen, both taken from the Breton language, into antiquarian terminology. He interpreted megaliths as gallic tombs. Born at Amiens, the son of an employee of the general tax farm, the Ferme générale, he received his education from the Jesuits, was admitted to their order and served as professor of rhetoric at Caen.After the suppression of the Jesuits in 1762-63, he returned to Paris, where Jean-Baptiste de La Curne de Sainte-Palaye took him on as a research associate for his Glossaire français, and the marquis de Paulmy entrusted to him the editing of the Mélanges drawn from his private library. In 1770 Legrand was named secretary to the directors of the École Militaire. Somewhat later, he served as private tutor to the son of a fermier général. One of his brothers having been named abbot of Saint-André de Clermont, Legrand went to pay him a visit, and ranged through Auvergne as a naturalist, in 1787 and 1788. A result was the Voyage dans la haute et basse Auvergne (Paris, 1788). With the Revolution, in 1795 Legrand was named conservator of French manuscripts in the Bibliothèque nationale. He took up once again an earlier project of writing a complete history of French poetry. Having translated the Old French into modern French and published a large number of analyses of old French poets in the Notices des Manuscrits de la Bibliothèque du Roi, he enlarged his frame of reference, but have completed only some parts of his great work, when he died suddenly, in Paris, 6 December 1800. Legrand was a member of the Institut de France."
