  "text" : "Reishin (Munenori Toshio) Kawai (1931-2010) was an 8th dan aikido practitioner and acupuncturist, who held the roles of President of the South American Aikido Federation and Vice-President of the International Aikido Federation. He was responsible for the introduction of aikido to Brazil in 1963. During his boyhood his health was fragile, which led him to receive acupuncture treatment, and to practice Sumo wrestling and Kenjutsu. In his youth he became an uchi-deshi for 7 years in the household of Torataro Saito, who taught him oriental medicine - as well as Daito-ryu Aikijujutsu and Ueshiba-ryu (!) Aiki-Budo. Technically, Kawai's foundation was therefore old school, in line with that of Gozo Shioda (Yoshinkan) and Morihiro Saito (Iwama). Subsequently, he studied at Tsukushoku University under the tutelage of Mishimasa Nishizawa, graduating as an M.D. in Oriental Medicine. Kawai proceeded to become an associate professor in the subjects of general acupunture and moxa technique at the Faculty of Oriental Medicine at Tsukushoku University. At the same time, he continued and updated his Aikijujutsu studies at the Aikikai Hombu Dojo - primarily studying with O-Sensei Morihei Ueshiba and his son Kisshomaru Ueshiba, as well as with Morihiro Saito on Sundays - for several years, before emigrating to Brazil and setting up practice as an M.D. there. Six years later he took a sabbatical to study Aikijujutsu and Aikido with Aritoshi Murashige, who encouraged him to establish a dojo in Brazil - which Kawai then proceeded to do. In 1963, the Founder of Aikido, Morihei Ueshiba, presented him with the Shihan diploma (the official acknowledgement as a Master level teacher) in recognition of his high standards and of his efforts to disseminate Aikido - which Kawai Sensei continued to do, throughout all of South America. From 1976 to 1984 he was Vice President of The International Aikido Federation (IAF), subsequently becoming Director General of The South American Aikido Federation, and the official representative of Aikikai Hombu Dojo in that subcontinent. Throughout his life, Kawai and his students remained intensely loyal to Hombu Dojo. In Brazil he married Leticia Okubo and became the father of two daughters, Cristina and Lilba Okubo Kawai, and the grandfather of two grandchildren, Lariza and Matias."

He improved and extended many of the already existing buildings from an earlier exposition, as well as creating new facilities including the Old Globe Theater. His own designs were predominantly in the Spanish Revival architectural style, occasionally blending them with American Craftsman influences, working to preserve San Diego's Spanish-influenced history. His firm, Requa and Jackson, were the architects of choice in San Diego during the 1920s, dominating the area with their \"Southern California Style\" that blended Mediterranean and Mission stylings."

She had the same success with this role in London. Her interpretation of Silla in Hans Pfitzner's opera Palestrina at Covent Garden rocketed her to the Metropolitan Opera in New York City. As a soloist, Randi Stene has performed at BBC Proms with Esa-Pekka Salonen and at the Salzburg Festival with Philippe Herreweghe. She is also a frequent guest soloist with the symphony orchestras in the Nordic capaitals. Given her base in Copenhagen and her key role within Danish opera, she was an obvious choice as a soloist at the inauguration of the new opera house in Copenhagen in the new production of Verdi's Aida. Her recordings includes songs by Hugo Alfvén, John Dowland, Edvard Grieg, Wilhelm Peterson-Berger and Jean Sibelius. In 2004 Stene was named Knight of the Order of the Dannebrog, and in 2007 she received the Norwegian-Finish Sibelius Award."

Emperor Louis IV had in 1334 mortgaged Ortenburg Castle, the cities of Offenburg, Gengenbach and Zell am Harmersbach and the imperial possessions in the Ortenau area to his father. When the time came to repay the loan, Emperor Charles IV did not have the money, so Rudolf was allowed to keep these possessions. Charles IV also mortgaged the toll at Strassbourg to Rudolf and Archbishop Berthold II of Strasbourg. On 26 August 1347, he married Adelaide, Lady of Belfort, (d. 1370/73), the daughter of Margrave Rudolf Hesso of Baden-Baden and his wife, Joanna of Burgundy. This marriage remained childless. In 1356, Rudolf concluded an inheritance treaty with his nephew Rudolf VI of Baden-Baden, in which Rudolf V appointed Rudolf VI as his heir. Rudolf V died in 1361. After his death, Baden-Pforzheim fell to Baden-Baden, reuniting Baden again. His widow remarried on 4 April 1369, to Count Walram IV of Tierstein."

Due to \"Russification\" of the university, Kobert left Dorpat in 1896, subsequently becoming director of the Brehmerschen Heilanstalten (a sanatorium founded decades earlier by Hermann Brehmer) in Gorbersdorf. In 1899 he was appointed to the chair of pharmacology, pharmacognosy, chemistry and physiological history of medicine at the University of Rostock, a position he kept until his death. Kobert's work largely involved investigations of ergot alkaloids, scopolamine, saponins and various plant and animal poisons. He was the author of popular textbooks, and was especially known for his release of Historischen Studien aus dem Pharmakologischen Institut der Universität Dorpat (Historical studies in the Institute of Pharmacology at the University of Dorpat; 5 volumes 1889-96)."

From 1979 to 1982 he taught English in Italy, Iran, and Leicester. He has written freelance and translated Virgil and Theocritus. Early on, he collaborated with his friends Dick Davis and Clive Wilmer on a book of poems, Shade Mariners. Michael Schmidt included some of his poems in two anthologies. Carcanet published his poetry books The Winter's Task (1977), Selected Poems (1986), Lusus (1999) and \"The Day and other Poems\" (2006), and his verse translations, Virgil's Georgics (1982) and Theocritus' Idylls (1988). His Collected Poems and Translations was published in 2009. Wells' poetry was inspired first by Virgil's Georgics and then by his own experiences working as a woodsman. In it, he explored man's experience of \"landscape, how it might be lived in and worked in, recorded and celebrated.\"  Staudt says that \"The Winter's Tale,\" the title poem of The Winter's Task, \"celebrates the laborer's pursuit of work for its own sake, as he moves out of himself and lays hold of a fundamental and objective reality \". He is married, with two children, and lives in France."

  "text" : "Rudolf Callmann (29 September 1892 – 12 March 1976) was a German American legal scholar. He was preeminent in the field of German and American competition law. Born in Cologne into a wealthy Jewish family, Callmann earned a doctorate in law from the University of Freiburg in 1919. His studies had been interrupted by frontline service in World War I. In 1923, he entered his father's law firm in Cologne, and established himself as a leading authority on unfair competition and antitrust law. As a World War I veteran he was allowed to practice even after the Machtergreifung in 1933, but in 1936 decided to emigrated to the United States. He was offered a research fellowship at Harvard Law School, where he worked with Zechariah Chafee, while getting accustomed to American common law, and in 1939 he passed the bar exam. Between 1939 and 1945 he completed the American edition of his magnum opus on unfair competition, now (in revised edition) known as Callmann on Unfair Competition, Trademarks, and Monopolies. In 1949, Callmann founded the boutique law firm Greene, Callmann & Durr in New York City, along with Orville N. Greene (1908–1997) and Frank L. Durr (1904–1990), where he practiced until 1971."

  "text" : "Roemer Vlacq (Gouda, baptised 19 August 1637 – Toulon, 17 July 1703) was a Dutch naval captain, who blew up his ship to keep it out of enemy hands. Roemer Vlacq, son of Anna Jansdochter Verrijn and Dirk Vlacq, a physician, apothecary and notary from Gouda, became lieutenant commander of Kits with the Admiralty of Amsterdam in 1671. In 1672, during the Third Anglo-Dutch War, he commanded the frigate Postiljon during the Battle of Solebay under lieutenant admiral Michiel de Ruyter. In 1673 he took part in all battles, commanding the frigate Brak. In 1674 he was commander of the transport vessel Opperdoes during De Ruyter's expedition against Martinique. In March 1676 he went to the Caribbean as captain of Huys van Kruyningen under commodore Jacob Binckes. On 3 March 1677 he was involved in the Action of March 1677. When the French boarded his vessel and threatened to overpower his forces, he blew up the ship. Most of the crew lost their lives, but French ships were damaged as well. Vlacq himself survived, although heavily injured and returned to the Netherlands in October of the same year. At the end of the Franco-Dutch War Vlacq performed convoy services: in 1678 to the Bay of Biscay and in 1690 and 1691 in the Baltic Sea. In 1692 Vlacq was suspended for insubordination, but was rehabilitated on 14 February 1696 by stadtholder WIlliam and re-entered service with the Admiralty of Amsterdam. He once again went into convoy service. Vlacq was injured again during the War of the Spanish Succession when a fleet of 110 Dutch and British merchant ships that he was escorting out of Lisbon with five warships hit a French five-warships flotilla under commodore Alain Emmanuel de Coëtlogon on 22 May 1703. During the ensuing Battle of Cap de la Roque, Vlacq sacrificed his warships in a successful attempt to let the merchant convoy escape. Vlacq's 50-gun flagship, the Muiderberg was attacked by the 90-gun thriple-deckers Le Vainqueur and Le Monarque. Vlacq had lost an arm and shoulder and half his crew before surrendering the ship. The entire Dutch flotilla was destroyed. He was made a prisoner and transported to Toulon, where he succumbed to his injuries on 17 July 1703. Roemer Vlacq was grandfather to Adriaan Roemer Vlacq, vice admiral of the Admiralty of Amsterdam."

  "text" : "Robert Fletcher (1885–1972) is the originally-uncredited writer of many of the lyrics to Cole Porter's \"Don't Fence Me In.\" After graduating with a degree in mining engineering he moved to Montana where he found work in mining camps and as a surveyor. He then moved to Helena, Montana, to work for the Montana Highway Department to promote tourism in Montana. In about 1935 he was instrumental in the creation of ports of entry at major highways entering Montana, where visitors were provided with information about Montana's history and points of interest. He became a student of Montana history, and with that background he wrote the text for a series of historical markers displayed throughout Montana in the mid-1930s. Several compilations of those markers have been published. In the 1950s he was commissioned by the Montana Cattlemen's Association to write a history of the cattle industry in Montana titled \"Free Grass to Fences.\" He was an early \"cowboy poet\" and published a book of verse titled \"Corral Dust.\" He also composed songs for the entertainment of friends. For $250 Cole Porter purchased Fletcher's poem that later became \"Don't Fence Me In,\" intended for a movie that was not made. Several years later Cole Porter's revision of the song, especially the version sung by Kate Smith, became popular nationwide. Fletcher eventually negotiated with Cole porter's estate to receive co-writing credit and a share of the royalties from the song. Fletcher left his employment with the State of Montana and moved to Butte to take a job in public relations with the Montana Power Company, where he worked until his retirement. He eventually moved to Rancho Bernardo, California, where he died."

  "text" : "Sir Robert Hatton (died 10 January 1653) was an English landowner and politician who sat in the House of Commons at various times between 1621 and 1642. He supported the Royalist cause in the English Civil War. Hatton was the son of John Hatton of Long Stanton and his wife Joan Shute, daughter of Francis Shute. He was admitted at Gray's Inn as of Clynton Cambridgeshire on 2 February 1602. He inherited the estates of Oakington, Cambridgeshire from his mother and probably lived there from about 1610. He was knighted at Whitehall on 12 March 1617. He also possessed the property of Oswalds in Bishopsbourne. In 1621, Hatton was elected Member of Parliament for Sandwich, but his election was declared void as the mayor had effectively disenfranchised part of the electorate. He was elected as MP for Sandwich in 1624 and 1625. In 1641 Hatton was elected MP for Castle Rising in a by-election for the Long Parliament. On the outbreak of the Civil War he supported the King and was disabled from sitting in parliament on 7 September 1642 for executing a Commission of Array. He was appointed a Chamberlain of the Exchequer in 1644 but fled overseas after 1646 to escape his creditors. His estate at Oakington was under sequestration for ten years, and apparently not compounded for. On 1 July 1651 parliament directed for his estates to be sold. Hatton died in 1653. Hatton's daughter Elizabeth married Sir Anthony Aucher, 1st Baronet who recovered Hatton's estates."

As chair of the Entomology Department at the University of California at Berkeley from 1959-1973, he was instrumental in expanding the program to include four subdivisions within the field. During this time, he was also director for the University of California for Pest Management and Related Environmental Protection Project with UC/AID, and later, executive director of the Consortium for International Crop Protection. Dr. Smith also helped to establish the Panel of Experts on Integrated Pest Control of the United Nations Food and Agricultural Organization and the United Nations Environment Programme. Beginning in 1972, Smith was an associate project director of the Huffaker Project, which coordinated the research of scientists at 18 land-grant universities regarding integrated pest management for six major crops. It was through this endeavor that Dr. Smith met and developed breakthrough techniques of Integrated Pest Management (IPM) with Dr. Perry L. Adkisson. By using locally relevant ecological methods to control insects, weeds, and disease, integrated pest management allows farmers to reduce their use of and reliance upon pesticides while increasing profits. Along with Dr. Adkisson, Dr. Smith was awarded the World Food Prize in 1997 for his achievements in implementing IPM both in the United States and in developing countries. Smith died on 23 August 1999. He was 80 years old."

  "text" : "Ratna Pala (920-960) was the son of Brahma Pala in Pala Dynasty (900–1100) of Kamarupa Kingdom. His queen's name was Durlabha. He was succeeded by Indra Pala. The Gachtal plates of Go Pala have thrown fresh light on the achievements and date of Ratna Pala. An inscription states that Ratna Pala of Pragjyotisha-Kamarupa defeated King Rajyapala (908-40 AD) of Gauda and advanced as far as the Ganges in the heart of Gauda empire. This achievement is not mentioned in any earlier record of the family. The inscription mentioned Rajyapala of Bengal, advancing the dates of Pala's reign to the 1st half of the 10th century from the 1st half of the 11th century. The Baragaon plates, issued in the 25th regnal year of Ratnapala suggests that Brahma Pala abdicated in favour of his son. The author of the inscription extravagantly praised Ratna Pala, describing him as a terror to the Saka king [since there was no Saka king at Ratnapala's time, the reference may be to the Shahis of Afghanistan (and Pakistan) who were sometimes represented as the descendants of the Kushans]; to the Lord of Gurjaras (apparently the Gurjara-Pratiharas of Kanauj); to the Gauda monarch (Rajyapala, 908-40 AD, of Bengal and Bihar); to the ruler of Kerala; to the Vahikas (often spelt Bahikas; of Punjab, particularly in the Sialkot region); to the Tayikas (also spelt Tajika; they were Arabs, nodoubt meaning the Arabs of Sind in the present case) as well as the Dakshinatya kings. These claims, barring the case of the Gauda king, we poetical exaggerations by the scribe. The basis of such claims was nothing more than the receipt of a present from a source such as a visiting trader. The Baragaon and Sualkuchi plate grants of Ratna Pala were issued in his 25th and 36th regnal years when the king was residing at Durjaya (capital). The Carabari plates, last to be discovered, were issued during the 12th regnal year when the king was at Hadappaka, identified with Hadappesvara (named after the Isvara ie, Siva or Sivalinga worshipped at Hadappa or Hadappaka) and was the capital of the kings of Salastambha line. He was the builder of many Siva temples, the donor of much wealth to the Brahmins, the performer of some sacrifices and the like (Indra Pala grant)."

  "text" : "Reinhold Conrad Muschler aka Reno Muschler (9 August 1882 Berlin – 10 December 1957 Berlin), was a German botanist, explorer and writer, who worked on the taxonomy of North African flora. He travelled extensively with Ernest Friedrich Gilg (1867–1933) and carried out a revision of the flora of Patagonia. His parents were both well-known singers at the Court Opera in Berlin. After finishing high school in Berlin, he travelled widely in Europe and Africa, spending the winters of 1902-1906 in Egypt after he was found to be suffering from TB. It was during these rest-cures that he met Georg Schweinfurth and Paul Ascherson, who encouraged him to become involved in the botany of Egypt. Consequently he studied under Adolf Engler, receiving his doctorate on African Senecio species in 1908, and becoming an assistant at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Dahlem-Berlin. Between 1906 and 1914 he authored and co-authored some 65 botanical papers, describing 10 new genera, 380 new species and about 50 new combinations. Irregularities in the Manual Flora of Egypt led to Schweinfurth and Engler accusing him of fraud and the matter being taken to court. The case against Muschler was dismissed on the grounds of his being mentally disturbed at the time. Even so, the scandal led to his leaving the Royal Botanic Gardens of Berlin in September 1913. A 2001 paper by Olof Ryding notes that the 1913 publication by Luigi Buscalioniand Muschler on plants supposedly collected by the Duchess of Aosta is highly suspect in respect of the specimens' provenance and collector. Many of these doubtful specimens are now believed to have been collected by Schweinfurth in Eritrea and Yemen. A large number of Muschler's type specimens were destroyed by World War I and European botanists, excited by the fuss, had a field day examining his specimens, descriptions and drawings and making precipitate judgements about their validity in terms of the rules of nomenclature. Weighing the irregularities Ryding argued that many of Muschler's names and descriptions of the types in the Egyptian Flora should stand. During the War Muschler stayed in Egypt and on his return to Germany became a noted writer and music critic. He wrote \"Egyptian Travel Sketches\" in 1915, biographies of Frederick the Great, Richard Strauss and Philipp zu Eulenburg, and many novels in which he glorified love as a form of religion. Muschler was living at 23a Fürstenstrasse, Berlin at the time of his death. His grave is at the Waldfriedhof Zehlendorf. The Angolan composite genus of Muschleria was created by Spencer Le Marchant Moore in 1914 to honour Muschler. The standard author abbreviation Muschl. is used to indicate this individual as the author when citing a botanical name."

He obtained a degree in Horticulture from the University of Maine in 1929, and his Ph.D. in Pomology from the University of Maryland in 1934. He first taught at Cornell University and went on to become the Dean of the College of Agriculture, and then the President, of the University of New Hampshire. From 1959 to 1972, Dr. Chandler was the founding Director of the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) in Los Banos, Philippines. Working with a team of twenty-four researchers from numerous countries in Southeast Asia, Dr. Chandler gathered thousands of rice varieties to be tested and eventually selected to be grown under various conditions. Dr. Chandler's leadership was instrumental in developing over two dozen new varieties of rice that produced higher yields than traditional strains and increased rice production. These varieties helped the Philippines to achieve self-sufficiency in rice by 1968, and still provide food for millions across Asia. Later, he led the Asian Vegetable Research and Development Center (AVRD) in Taiwan. Dr. Chandler was awarded the Presidential End Hunger Award, and in 1988, he was awarded the World Food Prize for his leadership in building the agricultural research capacity at IRRI and AVRD."

  "text" : "Robert Brendon Keating (May 7, 1924 – March 4, 2012) was an American diplomat. Keating served as United States Ambassador to Madagascar and Comoros from 1983 to 1986. Keating was born in Bedford, Massachusetts to parents who emigrated to the United States from Ireland. Keating graduated from the United States Naval Academy of Annapolis in 1947, a year earlier than expected due to an accelerated degree. He served in the United States Navy during the Korean War, reaching the rank of lieutenant commander. Keating later received his master's degree from George Washington University in 1961. Keating worked as a consultant for international development after completing his master's degree. He ran a technical cooperation program in Chile from 1964 to 1967. He also spearheaded the construction of roads in Zaire (now the Democratic Republic of Congo) during the early 1970s. Keating was appointed as a delegate to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea during the 1980s, though the United States did not become a signatory to the treaty. Soon after, U.S. President Ronald Reagan nominated Keating as Ambassador to Madagascar and the Comoros. His nomination came with some controversy surrounding communications between Keating and several mining companies while he was a delegate to the Law of the Sea convention. However, Keating was confirmed by the U.S. Senate and served as ambassador accredited to both island nations from 1983 to 1986. Keating served as the U.S. executive director of the World Bank from 1986 to 1989. He later became the representative of the United States on the board of directors of the World Bank Group, retiring in 2008 to continue consultancy work. Robert Keating died in Washington, D.C. of pneumonia on March 4, 2012, at the age of 87. He was survived by his daughter, while his wife, Virginia Wellborn Keating, whom he married in 1959, died in 2006. A longtime Washington resident, he had resided in the Residences at Thomas Circle."

  "text" : "Colonel Sir Robert William Edis KBE CB (13 June 1839 – 23 June 1927) was a British architect. Born in Huntingdon, Edis was educated at Huntingdon Grammar School and Aldenham School before being articled to William Gilbee Habershon and Edward Habershon, architects, in London.  He became chief assistant to Anthony Salvin, and joined the Architectural Association in 1859. He was admitted an Associate of the Royal Institute of British Architects in 1862 and a fellow of the association in 1867. Although his early work was Gothic, Edis later became a proponent of the Queen Anne Style of baroque revival architecture. He worked mostly on private houses and public buildings, although he did design a few churches. He later became involved in the Aesthetic Movement of decorative arts and in furniture design, and delivered a series of Cantor lectures on the subject at the Royal Society of Arts. These formed the basis of two books: Decoration and Furniture of Town Houses (1881) and Healthy Furniture and Decoration (1884). Edis had a long association with the Volunteer Force and its successor the Territorial Force. In 1868 he received a commission in the Artists Rifles. He went on to be the regiment's commanding officer in 1883, and held the office of honorary colonel from 1909 until his death.   In January 1889 he was elected a member of the first London County Council, representing St Pancras South for three years as a member of the Conservative-backed Moderate Party. Edis had homes at Ormesby Old Hall, Great Ormesby, Norfolk and Regent's Park, London. He was a justice of the peace and a Deputy Lieutenant for Norfolk from 1901. He was created a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1919 for his military services. Edis died suddenly at his Norfolk home in 1927, aged 88."

  "text" : "Ralph Duncan James (1909, Liverpool, England – 19 May 1979, Salt Spring Island, British Columbia, Canada) was a Canadian mathematician working on number theory and mathematical analysis. Born in Liverpool, Ralph moved with his parents to Vancouver, British Columbia when he was young. After graduating from high school, Ralph attended University of British Columbia. After graduating, he continued in mathematics, writing a master’s thesis on Tangential Coordinates. Proceeding to University of Chicago, he studied under L. E. Dickson. He gained a Ph.D. with a dissertation Analytical Investigations of Waring's Theorem in 1932. He continued post-graduate study, first with E. T. Bell at California Institute of Technology, then in 1934 with G. H. Hardy at Cambridge University. Ralph James was a professor of mathematics at University of California, Berkeley from 1934 to 1939. He was then called to University of Saskatchewan where he became Head of the mathematics department. In 1943 he began his long tenure at University of British Columbia, becoming Head of the department in 1948. James made contributions to the theory of the Perron integral and to solution of Goldbach's conjecture. Since 1978, the Canadian Mathematical Society have awarded the Coxeter–James Prize in his honor."

Later, his column appeared in Outlook. Puri was born on 20 September 1934 in Karachi, now in Pakistan. His family settled in Delhi after the partition. He drew cartoons for The Statesman in 1956–57, after which he went to London, where he drew cartoons briefly for The Manchester Guardian and The Glasgow Herald (1958–59). He returned to India to become cartoonist for the Hindustan Times from 1959 to 1967. He started working as a columnist and freelancer after this stint. From 1972 to 1977, he was the editor and proprietor of Stir Weekly. An early critic of the Congress and a fierce opponent of Indira Gandhi, Puri moved into politics in 1977, becoming the founding General Secretary of the Janata Party. He was later associated with some of the parties that splintered from the Janata Party: the Lok Dal and the BJP, but was not attached to any political party after 1988. Puri died in his sleep on 16 February 2015 at the age of 80."

Coming from Berkhamstead in Hertfordshire, he immigrated with his wife and infant to Boston in the Massachusetts Bay Colony where he joined the Boston church in August 1634. By 1637 he was in Providence, signing an agreement that year, and he and his wife both became Baptists for a while. By the mid-1650s, the Quaker religion had taken hold in Rhode Island, and Scott was said to be the first Quaker in Providence. His future son-in-law, Christopher Holder had his right ear cut off for his Quaker activism in Massachusetts, and Scott's wife, who went there to support him, was jailed and given ten lashes with a whip. Providence founder Roger Williams did not care for the Quaker religion, and got into a pamphlet war with Quaker founder George Fox. A letter written by Scott was printed in Fox's pamphlet, and was critical of Williams for his \"pride and folly,\" and noted his inconsistency in professing liberty of conscience by not being tolerant of those who disagreed with him. Scott was married in England to Katharine Marbury, the daughter of the Reverend Francis Marbury, and sister of the Puritan dissident Anne Hutchinson."

He is the son of Giuseppe Morabito, also known as Tiradrittu, the head of the 'Ndrangheta in Africo, and succeeded him as the head of the clan after his father had been arrested in February 2004. Morabito is seen as s diplomatic broker, a \"peacemaker\" in the interest and for the good of the 'Ndrangheta clans, in addition to driving the powerful and well-networked underworld faction of Africo with tentacles in different regions of Northern Italy and especially in Lombardy. His role as mediator became clear when in March 2010, the police managed to place a bug in the home of Giuseppe Pelle, another emerging boss and son of Antonio Pelle, also known as Ntoni Gambazza, the capo crimine, the ceremonial head of the 'Ndrangheta. In just over a month hundreds of meetings were recorded between mafiosi, politicians, entrepreneurs, professionals, businessmen and middlemen of any kind, and even people with links to intelligence services. The conversations confirmed the existence of La Provincia, a provincial commission of the 'Ndrangheta, formed at the end of the Second 'Ndrangheta war in September 1991 to avoid further internal conflicts. They also confirmed that Rocco Morabito and Giuseppe Pelle had succeeded their fathers and were in charge of managing the affairs of the 'Ndrangheta clans on the Ionic side (the Aspromonte mountains and Locride) of Calabria. (Other so-called mandamenti are those for the Tyrrhenian side (the plains of Gioia Tauro) and one central mandamento for the city of Reggio Calabria) As a result of the bugs, Giuseppe Pelle was arrested on April 22, 2010, in an operation dubbed Reale (Royal), together with 8 others, including his sons. Rocco Morabito was able to escape but was arrested a few days later on April 26, 2010, in Melito di Porto Salvo, while he was visiting his sister."

  "text" : "Robert Phillip Sharp (24 June 1911 – 25 May 2004) was an expert on the geological surfaces of the Earth and the planet Mars. Sharp served as the chairman of the Division of Geological Sciences at California Institute of Technology (Caltech) from 1952 to 1968. He built the modern department and especially recruited new faculty in geochemistry, tectonic geomorphology, planetary science, and field geology. Professor Sharp specialized in geomorphology and published heavily in glacial terrain (the Sierra Nevada, Blue Glacier in the Olympic Peninsula, and Alaska), Mojave Desert terrain, and the Ruby-East Humboldt Range in north-central Nevada. Sharp retired in 1979 but continued leading geological field trips afterwards (with emphasis on the Grand Canyon geology using rubber rafts). Robert Sharp was a member of the United States National Academy of Sciences and received the National Medal of Science from President George H. W. Bush in 1989. Professor Sharp won the Penrose Medal from the Geological Society of America, its highest honor. Sharp was honored by Caltech as the first named professorship in geology: the Robert Phillip Sharp Chair in Geology. Sharp was a native son of Oxnard, California. He attended Caltech as an undergraduate, beginning in 1930, earning a bachelor's degree (1934) in geology, and master's degree (1935) in geology. While at Caltech, he was quarterback on the football team. He matriculated to Harvard University for a doctorate (1938) in geology under Professor Kirk Bryan. Sharp served in the United States Army during World War II as an analyst in the Arctic, Desert and Tropical Information Center and achieved the rank of captain. During World War II, Sharp performed extensive field work in the Aleutian Islands of the Alaskan Peninsula, simultaneously testing new arctic clothing for soldiers, and quietly performing geological mapping of several islands, which he published in the Bulletin of the Geological Society of America. Sharp was briefly an instructor in geology at the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign before World War II, then briefly an Assistant Professor of Geology at the University of Minnesota immediately after the war. As soon as possible, Caltech's Division Chairman Ian Campbell arranged for Sharp to return home to Caltech as a full professor in 1947. Sharp remained at Caltech for the next half-century, and was quickly promoted to the Chairman of the Division of Geological Sciences, later renamed to the Division of Geological and Planetary Sciences. While at Caltech, Sharp mentored dozens of doctoral students in field geomorphology; these are now working at the United States Geological Survey facility in Menlo Park, California and in leading geology departments throughout North America. Sharp became a published expert on the glacial geomorphology of the Sierra Nevada range, the Trinity Alps of northwestern California, the Olympic Peninsula of Washington, and Mount Saint Elias in the Fairweather Range of Alaska. In the winter season, he focused his geological field work in the Mojave Desert of California, with emphasis on the geomorphology of Cima Dome, and the sliding stones on the Racetrack Playa in northern Death Valley. Robert Phillip Sharp was an expert on the physics of blown sand and the formation of sand dunes in the Mojave Desert and the Coachella Valley. He was awarded the Kirk Bryan Award by the Geological Society of America for his scholarly publications on the geomorphology of sand dunes in desert terrain. Professor Sharp loved weekend field trips, and so he authored a number of field books in geology of southern California, published by Mountain Press. While in his sixties, Sharp continued to teach rigorous field geology to Caltech geology students during summer classes. Field geology classes were taught at Henry Mountain in Utah, where Grove Karl Gilbert discovered laccoliths. After retiring from Caltech, Sharp and his wife Jean moved their home from Altadena to Santa Barbara, where they lived for two decades in a custom-built house on Gibraltar Road overlooking the Pacific Ocean. Bob and Jean Sharp are survived by two adult children, Bruce Sharp and Christy Sharp. On March 28, 2012, NASA named a mountain \"Mount Sharp\" on the planet Mars, in his honor. The mountain is located at the center of Gale crater, where in August of the same year the Mars rover Curiosity successfully landed. However, on May 16, 2012, Mount Sharp had officially been renamed \"Aeolis Mons\" by the International Astronomical Union, while a neighboring crater was instead named after the scientist."

He is another American architect. Rosalie studied painting at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts and Art Students League of New York. She joined the Photo League in 1942 where she studied photography and contributed to Photo Notes as a writer, reviewer and editor. After FBI investigations in the early 1950s, Gwathmey stopped photographing, destroyed her negatives, and donated many of her prints to the New York Public Library. In the 1960s and 70s, she was a textile designer. Her photography was known for capturing the life's of Southern African American communities. She focused on black life in her home of Charlotte and Rocky Mount, North Carolina. She photographed many of the black sharecroppers and southern townscapes that became the basis of her husband's paintings. While Rosalie's social documentary photographs offer no stylistic revolution, her life and art reflect significant issues relating to politics and race relations in the United States during the 1940s. While in the Photo League, she worked with many radical photographers of the era: Paul Strand, Aaron Siskind, Sid Grossman, Dorothea Lange, Bernice Abbott, Lizette Modell, Walter Rosenblum, Dan Weiner, and Lou Stettner."

These and other similar subjects are featured in his latest social policy book, published by NYU Press under the title, Moving Working Families Forward: Third Way Policies That Work. Cherry conducts studies of black and Latino students who graduate with degrees from less competitive colleges in the private sector. Robert Cherry has written extensively on the subject of discrimination and race, as well as the Holocaust in Poland. He is the author of Rethinking Poles and Jews: Troubled Past, Brighter Future published simultaneously in Poland as Polacy i Żydzi – kwestia otwarta (pictured), one of the first books to address the negative assumptions and anti-Polish bias in the Holocaust literature. The book, produced in collaboration with Dr Annamaria Orla-Bukowska of Jagiellonian University in Kraków, was published in English as well as in Polish; and described by Michael C. Steinlauf as \"a ray of light amidst the acrimonious and generally uninformed polemics\", and \"a series of essays that pierce the stereotypes which have obscured historical reality\" (Deborah Lipstadt, Denying the Holocaust)."

  "text" : "Ratna Sarumpaet (born 16 July 1949) is an Indonesian human rights activist. She is also a theatrical producer, actress, film director, and writer. Sarumpaet, born into a politically active Christian family in North Sumatra, initially studied architecture in Jakarta. After seeing a play by Willibrordus S. Rendra in 1969, she dropped out and joined his troupe. Five years later, after marrying and converting to Islam, she founded the Satu Merah Panggung; the troupe did mostly adaptations of foreign dramas. As she became increasingly concerned about her marriage and unhappy about the local theatre scene, two years later Sarumpaet left her troupe and began to work in television; she only returned in 1989, after divorcing her abusive husband. The murder of Marsinah, a labour activist, in 1993 led Sarumpaet to become politically active. She wrote her first original stageplay, Marsinah: Nyanyian dari Bawah Tanah (Marsinah: Song from the Underground), in 1994 after becoming obsessed with the case. This was followed by several other politically charged works, several of which were banned or restricted by the government. Increasingly disillusioned by the autocratic acts of Suharto's New Order government, during the 1997 legislative elections Sarumpaet and her troupe led pro-democracy protests. For one of these, in March 1998, she was arrested and jailed for seventy days for spreading hatred and attending an \"anti-revolutionary\" political gathering. After her release, Sarumpaet continued to participate in pro-democracy movements; these actions led to her fleeing Indonesia after hearing rumours that she would be arrested for dissent. When she returned to Indonesia, Sarumpaet continued to write politically charged stageplays. She became head of the Jakarta Art Board in 2003; two years later she was approached by UNICEF and asked to write a drama to raise awareness of child trafficking in Southeast Asia. The resulting work served as the foundation for her 2009 feature film debut, Jamila dan Sang Presiden (Jamila and the President). This film was submitted to the 82nd Academy Awards for Best Foreign Language Film but not nominated. The following year, she released her first novel, Maluku, Kobaran Cintaku (Maluku, Flame of My Love)."

  "text" : "Robert Parris (21 May 1924 – 5 December 1999) was a composer and professor of music. He was born in Philadelphia, attended the University of Pennsylvania, then the Juilliard School in New York. Among his teachers were Otto Luening, Aaron Copland, Jacques Ibert, and Peter Mennin (although he always claimed that the effect of these teachers on his own composing technique was 'minimal'). After a year of study on a Fulbright Fellowship in Paris (where he was meant to study with Arthur Honegger, but hardly ever saw him), and a year teaching at the University of Washington in Seattle, he settled in the Washington, D.C. area in 1952. Parris joined the faculty of The George Washington University in 1963 where he taught theory and composition. Parris liked to describe himself as a 'colorist', and he therefore tended to write for small ensembles or a single instrument accompanied by piano or orchestra. His first international recognition came in 1958 with his Concerto for Five Kettledrums and Orchestra, premiered by tympanist Fred Begun and the National Symphony Orchestra in Washington, under Howard Mitchell. Parris was notorious for pushing instruments to the limits of any player's abilities: his solo violin sonata is particularly difficult, and the composer-directors of CRI believed his trombone concerto to be unplayable until they heard a recording of it. But he was also the most inventive of orchestrators: Parris's concerto for kettledrums was always a crowd-pleaser in performance because it was so surprisingly melodic: its last movement is built around a traditional hymn (like Copland's Appalachian Spring) but Parris gives the initial statements of that hymn—and its dramatic summation—to the kettledrums. Begun, the NSO principal tympanist who premiered the piece, made the original suggestion for the piece, but he later remarked, \"\"I suggested five drums jestingly.\" In the sixties and seventies Parris was a sometime music critic for The Washington Post and the Washington Evening Star. In this period Parris—who taught himself Spanish—also turned to Borges for inspiration and produced the Book of Imaginary Beings (Part I) a work for flute (pic), violin, cello, piano, celeste, and percussion, from 1972. Part II was published in 1983. A revival of the Concerto for Five Kettledrums and Orchestra, also in 1983, by the National Symphony Orchestra, under the direction of Mstislav Rostropovich, was such a success that it resulted in new performances of his Concerto for Trombone (first performed in 1964) by the NSO in 1985 and, then, to Parris's largest commission. His Symphonic Variations, performed in 1988 to great acclaim, was the result. A retrospective concert of his works at The George Washington University in this same year led Washington Post music critic Joseph McLellan to refer to Professor Parris as “one of (Washington’s) major music assets.”"

At age nineteen, he went to Iowa to work for the Ohio Stage Line Company. In April 1862, Gile enlisted as a corporal  in the Twenty-first Iowa Infantry and served until July 1864 when he re-enlisted and served in the First Iowa Battery. After being wounded in several Civil War battles, he was discharged in November 1865. Gile returned to Iowa until 1873, when he moved to Kansas and took a homestead of eighty acres in Republic County. Gile worked the land, planting orchards and establishing a quarry for the area on his property. Gile was married twice. His first wife Adaline Amelia Ingalls died less than a year after they were married in 1861. Four years later, he married Sarah Ann Mahaffey and they remained in Iowa until her death.

  "text" : "Richard Handl (born May 23, 1980) is a Swedish man that experimented with building a breeder reactor in his apartment in Ängelholm, Sweden for 6 months in 2011 with the intention to create a nuclear reaction. After working in a factory for four years, Handl became unemployed and decided to start a collection of the elements on the periodic table. Out of curiosity he began experimenting with his collected elements to see if he could create a nuclear reaction. Handl's experiment included the acquisition of fissile material from outside the country, a radiator suitable for transmutation, and instruments to measure the reaction, including a Geiger counter. He spent about $6,000 in materials and equipment. Experiments were done with tritium, americium, aluminium, beryllium, thorium, radium, and uranium, most of which he acquired from foreign companies. One step involved cooking americium, radium and beryllium in 96% sulfuric acid on a stove in order to more easily mix the ingredients; this resulted in an explosion. He kept a blog called \"Richard's Reactor\" in which he documented the progress of the reactor. On 22 July 2011 he was detained by the police after having contacted the Swedish Radiation Safety Authority (SSM) to inquire as to whether his project was legal or not. His apartment was searched, and the radioactive materials as well as his computer were taken by the police. He was released, but is currently suspected for being in violation of the radiation safety act (Strålskyddslagen). He was convicted in July 2014 on the violation of the radiation safety act and the violation of Swedish Environmental Code. A fine of 13,600 kronor was imposed."

In 1392, Rudolf was involved in the General Peace in Mecklenburg. In 1407, he was instrumental in the Priest burning at Stralsund, as it was his task to pass judgement on the perpetrators. When the accused did not appear before his court, he pronounced an interdict over the mayor and the city council and the citizens of Stralsund. The interdict was lifted in 1416, after Rudolf's death, and after a large sum of money had been paid. Rudolf's successor used the money to decorate Schwerin Cathedral. A red inscription in the Cathedral reads Dith hebben de Sundeschen mothen buwen, datt se de papenn verbrannt haddenn (\"The citizens of Stralsund had to build this, after they had burned the priests.\" or \"This [cathedral nave] have the Stralsund citizens built, [in repentance] for having burned the papists.\")"

  "text" : "Robert Culliford (22 February 1617 – 1698) was an English landowner and politician who sat in the House of Commons from 1660 to 1679. Culliford was the posthumous son of Robert Culliford of Encombe, Dorset and his wife Margaret Hyde, daughter of Robert Hyde of West Hatch, Wiltshire. He came into the estate at Encombe,on the Isle of Purbeck, at birth and farmed it. During the English Civil War his actions were mainly directed at safe-guarding his property and cattle as he helped the Royalists capture Wareham in 1644 but then raised a force of 250 men in 1646 to blockade the Royalist garrison of Corfe Castle. He was thereby exempted from compounding for delinquency and from the decimation tax in 1656. However he eagerly accepted a post for one of his sons at the exiled Court \"as attendant to the young gallant there\". In 1660, Culliford was elected Member of Parliament for Wareham for the Convention Parliament. He was J.P. for Dorset from July 1660 to June 1688 and commissioner for assessment for Dorset from August 1660 to 1663. In 1661 he was re-elected MP for Wareham for the Cavalier Parliament after a double return with his brother-in-law Robert Lawrence, who had been a commander of the Royalist forces at Corfe Castle. He was Deputy Lieutenant for the Isle of Purbeck from 1661 to about 1676. In 1662 he became a freeman of Lyme Regis and commissioner for corporations for Dorset until 1663. He was a J.P. for Poole in 1665 and commissioner for assessment for Dorset from 1666 to 1680. In 1675 he was commissioner for recusants. He was removed from the commission of the peace in June 1688 and during the Glorious Revolution he protected some Roman Catholic neighbours at Lulworth Castle when they were threatened by a mob. One of these neighbours said of the incident \"God has been pleased to raise up a friend of almost an enemy\" . He was reinstated J.P. for Dorset from November 1688 until his death and was a commissioner for assessment for Dorset from 1689 to 1690. Culliford died at the age of 70 and was buried at Corfe Castle on 10 February 1698. Culliford married firstly Elizabeth Lawrence, daughter of Sir Edward Lawrence of Creech Grange, Steeple, Dorset on 14 May 1638 and had six sons and five daughters. He married secondly before 10 October 1676, Jane Lawrence, widow of his brother-in-law Sir Robert Lawrence of Creech Grange and daughter of John Williams of Tyneham, Dorset. His son William was MP for Corfe Castle from 1690 to 1699."

  "text" : "Randhir was an Indian character actor in Hindi and Punjabi films who was active from the 1940s to the 1980s. He appeared in over 172 films. Originally he played side heroes or friend of the hero. On a few occasions he even played the hero. One of his most famous hero's friend roles was in Dil Deke Dekho (1959). This was in the 1940s-1950s period. The 1960s was a period of transition. Due to age and displacement from hero's friend roles by comedians, Randhir began to experiment with character roles. He had done such roles in the 1950s and 1940s as well. In the mid-1960s he frequently played Maharajas in costume films. Randhir began adopting the moneylender 'lala' role around the end of the 1960s. His role in Baharen Phir Bhi Aayengi (1967) maybe one of his earliest in this form but it was a rough exhibition of what was to come. He firmly put himself into the role with Do Raaste (1969). Afterwords he would be cast almost exclusively as a Lala or a similar merchant. His role in Zanjeer (1973) is an example of this typecasting. Little information is available about his life. The 1982 release Khud-Dhar credits Randhir as 'late' hinting he died before its release. The release preceding its release was in 1980. prior to working in films he worked with all india radio.He was an ardent sports person and played football for a team called simla youngs while in school in simla."

  "text" : "Russell Barnes (born 1968) is a British television producer and director, known primarily for documentaries about science and contemporary history. He was educated at Bedford Modern School and studied history at Christ's College, Cambridge. Russell Barnes worked as a researcher on cult youth programmes A Stab in the Dark and The Word, and also Channel 4’s television review show, Right to Reply. In 2002, he directed Empire, a revisionist account of British colonial history presented by the Harvard historian Niall Ferguson. A sequel about US power, American Colossus, followed in 2004. In 2004 Russell Barnes produced Churchill's Forgotten Years, written and presented by the Cambridge University historian David Reynolds. Barnes and Reynolds went on to collaborate on a series of further feature-length history documentaries for the BBC, including The Improbable Mr Attlee, Summits and Armistice, which charted the final month of the First World War from the German perspective and received special commendation from the jury at the 2009 Grierson Awards ceremony. In 2011, they produced World War Two: 1941 and the Man of Steel, a new profile of Josef Stalin, which was shortlisted in the Best Historical Documentary category of the 2012 Grierson Awards. This was followed in 2012 by World War Two: 1942 and Hitler’s Soft Underbelly which argued that the war in the Mediterranean became a dark obsession for Winston Churchill, and in 2015, World War Two: 1945 and the Wheelchair President, examined the impact of Franklin Rooselvelt's failing health and marriage on his war leadership. Long Shadow, which explored the legacy and meaning of the First World War as part of the BBC's centenary season of programming, was broadcast on BBC2 in 2014. The series, which explored the legacy and meaning of the First World War as part of the BBC's centenary season of programming, received widespread and favourable press coverage and reviews. Russell Barnes started working with the evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins in 2005, directing the series The Root of All Evil? and The Enemies of Reason, which attracted controversy for their robust advocacy of atheism and rationalist principles. Barnes and Dawkins' next series The Genius of Charles Darwin, marking the 150th anniversary of On the Origin of Species in 2008, won Best Documentary series at the 2009 Broadcast Awards. Russell Barnes has produced several films that explore the history of communications technology including, in 2000, How the Victorians Wired the World and Hackers in Wonderland. In 2009 he was series producer of The Virtual Revolution, a BBC2 history of the World Wide Web presented by Aleks Krotoski. The series won the 2010 International Digital Emmy Award and the 2010 BAFTA New Media Award. In 2010 Barnes founded the independent production company ClearStory Ltd with Molly Milton, where he has produced projects including Richard Dawkins series Sex, Death and the Meaning of Life, the award-winning observational documentary Gypsy Blood and the controversial studio format Sex Box for Channel 4. Russell Barnes is active in Directors UK, sitting on the organisation's distribution committee."

  "text" : "Robert Le Rossignol (27 April 1884 – 26 June 1976) was a British chemist. He is most known for his work with Fritz Haber on the fixation of nitrogen from atmospheric air, the Haber process. He was born in Saint Helier, Jersey, Channel Islands, and attended school there. He matriculated from the University of London in 1901 and graduated from University College London in 1905 where he remained, becoming a member of the Institute of Chemistry of Great Britain and a Fellow of the Chemical Society of London. In 1908–1909, he worked with Haber in Germany on the difficult problem of demonstrating ammonia synthesis from air, eventually producing a tabletop apparatus that worked at 200 atmospheres pressure. Haber was awarded the Nobel Prize for his discovery that virtually \"made bread from the air\" and recognized the assistance he'd received from Le Rossignol, whose name appears on Haber's patents for the process. He was interned in Germany in 1914 at the outbreak of the first World War, but was released to work for the Auergesellschaft during the war. He returned to the UK after the war. He joined the GEC research laboratory, where he remained for the rest of his career, working on thermionic valves. He lived in Penn, Buckinghamshire and was a noted philanthropist using the royalty income he received from the Haber patent. His two sons were both killed during World War II."

He studied science in Bangalore and later, studied for a diploma in Applied Arts from the JJ Institute of Applied Art in Mumbai. He joined the Art Department of the Life Insurance Corporation of India as an illustrator and designer, working there for over 31 years. He retired from here and settled down in Dharwad in 1989. Raobail has contributed cartoons and illustrations to a host of newspapers and magazines. He adopted his professional name 'Raobail', because he thought his original surname 'Rao' was far too common. Under this name, he published in publications such as the Indian Express, the Times of India, Reader’s Digest, The Illustrated Weekly of India, Eve’s Weekly, Imprint, Debonair, Blitz , Sun, Inside Outside, and the Taj Magazine, besides regional publications. His cartoons have featured in the Penguin Book of Indian Cartoons edited by Abu Abraham. Raobail has designed and illustrated children’s books for UNICEF, such titles as Chakramadhye, Saban, and Railgaadi. He has done greeting cards for CRY and Concern India. He also creates collage art using stamps and envelopes. He has held one-man exhibitions in India and abroad. A selection of his work over 25 years was shown in 2008. In 2009, he was selected by Indian Institute of Cartoonists for their Lifetime Achievement Award."

Upon his liberation and return to Europe, Adams' story was published in two heavily edited and divergent accounts, most notably The Narrative of Robert Adams in 1816. Regardless of its discrepancies, Adams' accounts of his experience in Africa provide many valuable historical details about the region prior to European colonization."

His books include The Queer Renaissance: Contemporary American Literature and the Reinvention of Lesbian and Gay Identities and Crip Theory: Cultural Signs of Queerness and Disability. McRuer has also edited Sex and Disability, with Anna Mollow, and Desiring Disability: Queer Theory Meets Disability Studies, with Abby L. Wilkerson. McRuer’s work focuses on queer and crip cultural studies and critical theory. He is completing a book tentatively titled Crip Time: Essays on Disability, Sexuality, and Neoliberalism, considering locations of disability within contemporary political economies and the roles that disabled movements and representations play in countering hegemonic forms of globalization. His first book centered on contemporary LGBT writers, particularly LGBT writers of color, and his most recent book attends to cultural sites where critical queerness and disability contest heteronormativity and compulsory able-bodiedness."

  "text" : "Rafael Rivera Garcia is an artist, muralist and professor of Art. Garcia was born in New York City in 1930. As of 2012 he lives in Puerto Rico with his family. Garcia has a son that is also an artist and lives in Puerto Rico. He has painted murals in Puerto Rico, New York City, Miami and Boston. Garcia graduated from the High School of Music and Art in New York City. He had an art gallery in Rio Piedras, Puerto Rico in the 70’s. Garcia was a Professor of Art at University of Puerto Rico and was a visiting Professor of Art at Hunter College in New York City. One of his murals of the Taino Indians has served as a neighborhood landmark in Jamaica Plain, Boston. The Boston Art Commission’s website describes the Taino mural as depicting the tribe’s wind goddess Huraca’n, from which the word for a tropical storm is derived. She is flanked by two gods Guatauba and Coatrisque, who represent in Taino mythology the respective powers of thunder and flooding water. According to a 2004 Boston Globe article reprinted on the Jamaica Plain Historical Society’s website, the mural grew out of Boston’s relationship with Dorado, Puerto Rico, and \"affirmed JP and Hi-Lo as the heart of Boston’s Latino community.” Garcia work has been described as neo-figurative art. \"Practitioners of neofiguration use recognizable images which are then molded and reconfigured—often focusing on form and color—according to the artist's own conceptual or interpretive constructs. While not embracing either realist or abstract conventions, the image evolves and is reinvented based on the painter's own vision or palette.\" Another popular mural of Garcia's was painted in Taino Towers in East Harlem. \". . . two new murals celebrating the artistic tradition of the Taino Indians, the ancient people of Puerto Rico, began taking shape at the project. The murals, commissioned by Chembank, add a Caribbean explosion of color to the project's white concrete, black metal and neutral wood-grain surfaces."

He was knighted as a Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George (KCMG) in 1901, on the occasion of the visit to the Cape of Good Hope of the Duke and Duchess of Cornwall and York (later King George V and Queen Mary).Sir Richard served as legal advisor to Lord Kitchener during the Second Boer War, and then to the Transvaal Administration from 1901 until 1902. Following the peace treaty in May 1902, he was on 21 June appointed Attorney General, in the Colony of Transvaal, and thus a member of the executive council of the governor, Lord Milner. He represented South Africa at the Delhi Durbar in 1903 and brought back gold and silver medals for the country. He married Mary Walton in 1881 and they had one daughter.Sir Richard Solomon was part of a large and influential Cape family, of St Helenan Jewish descent. Members of the Solomon family were heavily involved in Cape politics, were physically all extraordinarily tiny in stature, but included some of the greatest legal minds in southern Africa. The great Cape Colony politician Saul Solomon was Sir Richard's uncle, and his brother was the Transvaal politician Edward Phillip Solomon. His final position was as High Commissioner in London for the Union of South Africa from 1910 until his death. He died in London on 10 November 1913."

  "text" : "Reinhold von Buxhoeveden (died 1557) was bishop of the Bishopric of Saare-Lääne or Ösel–Wiek (Estonian: Saare-Lääne piiskopkond; German: Bistum Ösel–Wiek; Low German: Bisdom Ösel–Wiek; contemporary Latin: Ecclesia Osiliensis), a semi-independent Roman Catholic prince-bishopric in what is now Saare, Hiiu and Lääne counties of Estonia, from 1532 to 1541. He was the second member of the Buxhoeveden family to serve as bishop of Saare-Lääne. Buxhoeveden is believed to have been born in the early 1480s and matriculated into Rostock University in 1501. In 1506 he was awarded a Master of Arts (magister artiumi) degree with canonical rights. He proceeded to prepare for a career in the religious ministry, and had the fortune of being accepted as a ministerial candidate in Rome. It is not known how long he was in Rome, but upon his departure he was named canon of Tartu and Saare-Lääne dioceses, and no later than 1519 he returned to Livonia. There he was named bishop of Tartu and became a close assistant to Johannes Blankenfeld, the future archbishop of Riga. On 13 November 1519 he was named archdeacon of the Saare-Lääne bishopric. In the following years he spent little time in Livonia, but rather became Blankenfeld’s ambassador to Pope Leo X. From 1520 on, he returned occasionally to Saaremaa and Tartu. In 1527, upon the death of Saare-Lääne bishop Johannes IV Kievel, Buxhoeveden should have gained enough influence to be named his successor. This however did not come to fruition, as he was tied politically to Blankenfeld who was suspected of wanting to cede Livonia to the Russians. Thus, Buxhoeveden remained archdeacon for three more years. On 18 October 1530 he was elected bishop by the Saare-Lääne chapter and knights, despite two votes against him by the Läänemaa vassalage. Emperor Charles V confirmed him as bishop in December 1531, and the Pope did so on 3 August 1532. However, before word of his confirmation reached Livonia, civil broke out in Saare-Lääne. During the Saare-Lääne civil war (1532–1536), Buxhoeveden had to compete with Wilhelm von Hohenzollern, the coadjutant of the archbishop of Riga, who had moved to the Läänemaa region. Buxhoeveden won out in the end, but at great financial cost, and commitments to the influential families in the Läänemaa vassalage. These factors led to many conflicts in the Saare-Lääne bishopric in the early 1540s. Buxhoeveden resigned from his position sometime before 13 July 1541. By this time, he had gained strong influence with the Livonian Order. With this influence he was able to get the bishop of Kuramaa, Johann von Münchhausen, appointed as his successor. Buxhoeveden died some time before 7 May 1557 at the bishop’s residence at Koluvere castle."

Prior to that, Ratan Kumar Sinha had served as Director of Bhabha Atomic Research Centre (BARC), Mumbai from May 2010 to June 2012. During his four decades of illustrious career, Ratan Kumar Sinha held several important positions related to design & development of nuclear reactors for the Indian nuclear programme. He has been actively involved in the development of Advanced Heavy Water Reactor (AHWR) and Compact High Temperature Reactor (CHTR), two of the highly acknowledged technological innovations which are suitable for large scale deployment of nuclear power, particularly in Indian scenario. As Chairman, AEC and Secretary, DAE, Ratan Kumar Sinha had put special thrust on several key deliverables for sustainable development and deployment of nuclear energy. Major thrust areas, in continuation to his research at BARC, include advanced nuclear energy systems for thorium utilisation and accelerator technology. He had given high priority to application of radiation technology in the areas of healthcare management, agriculture, food preservation and water purification. He had also strengthened outreach activities of DAE for spreading awareness about the peaceful uses of atomic energy among the general public. He had been instrumental in kick starting several public outreach campaigns to present the human face of India's nuclear capabilities. Under his leadership, DAE displayed its first ever tableau in the 66th Republic Day Parade 2015 and had launched its social media page on Facebook (https://www.facebook.com/dae.connect) as a part of public outreach initiatives. Ratan Kumar Sinha has coined the phrase राष्ट्र की सेवा में परमाणु (Atoms in Service of the Nation) which has been imbibed as the motto of the Department of Atomic Energy. Motto of DAE is a part of the new logo of DAE launched in January 2014."

While at Stanford, she taught the first Chicana studies course there. She taught at San Diego State University from 1974 to 1984 while simultaneously doing graduate studies at the University of California, San Diego. In 1977, she married her second husband, Mario Acevedo, and they had two more children. Leaving academia in 1984, Sanchez founded the Acevedo Gallery in San Diego with Acevedo and his father, artist Guillermo Acevedo. The gallery primarily showed works by Chicano artists, but also included art from Latin America and Native American art from the southwestern U.S. Sanchez returned to teaching again in 1990, joining the faculty at San Diego Mesa College. At Mesa College, she chaired the Chicano Studies department from 1996 to 1999, and in 2006 she led the department to change its name to the department of Chicana and Chicano Studies. She married one of her academic collaborators, Richard Griswold del Castillo, in 2005. Sanchez was inducted into the San Diego County Women's Hall of Fame in 2011 for her dedicated activism."

  "text" : "Ralph Hubbard Norton (1875–1953), born in Chicago, was an art collector and museum founder. Norton's use of an endowment was innovative and novel at the time he set it up to support the museum he established in perpetuity. He was inducted into the Florida Artist Hall of Fame in 1994. In 1900, he graduated from the University of Chicago. He married Elizabeth Calhoun (1881–1947) of Montgomery, Alabama. He retired as President of Acme Steel in 1940 and moved to West Palm Beach, Florida, opening the Norton Gallery and School of Art (which later became the Norton Museum of Art) in 1941 with pieces from their collection. The museum was designed by Marion Sims Wyeth of Wyeth, King & Johnson with a frieze and two bronze sculptures by Paul Manship. Norton's second wife was the sculptor Ann Weaver Norton (1905-1982), whose works are displayed in the Norton House in West Palm Beach."

  "text" : "Ralph \"Doc\" Hubbard (June 22, 1886 – November 14, 1980) was involved in promoting and preserving Native American culture. He wrote two children's novels with Native American settings, Queer Person (1930) and The Wolf Song (1935). Hubbard was born in East Aurora, New York, a son of author and philosopher Elbert Hubbard and his first wife Bertha (née Crawford) Hubbard. As a child he attended Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show, and as a teenager on a trip to the Western United States he visited the Battle of the Little Big Horn site on one of his summer trips to his uncle's ranch in Harlowton, Montana. Hubbard eventually moved to North Dakota and promoted tribal culture. In the 1920s, he organized Indian dance troupes that toured the U.S. and Europe, and in 1927, he wrote the \"American Indian Craft\" section of the Handbook for Boys (1927 Boy Scout Handbook). Hubbard taught at the State Teachers College in Minot (now Minot State University). He built Indian museums at Wounded Knee, South Dakota and at Medora. Nellie Snyder Yost wrote a biography of Hubbard published in 1979, A Man as Big as the West (Boulder CO: Pruett), OCLC 5353711. Minot State University offers the Ralph Hubbard Scholarship. On May 14, 1983, astronomer Norman G. Thomas discovered an asteroid and named it Hubbard in honor of Ralph Hubbard. On June 2, 2009, the Medora City Council changed the name of South Third Street to Doc Hubbard Drive."

He is best known for his appearances in Tahrir Square in Cairo during the Egyptian Revolution of 2011. Essam was born in 1987 in Mansoura, Egypt. His song Irhal, in which then Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak was urged to resign, gained great popularity among the demonstrators. It became internationally known through YouTube, and is referred to as the anthem of the revolution. In 2011, it was selected by Time Out as the third-most world-changing song of all time. He currently sings hard rock songs, one of the few singers in Egypt to sing rock. Ramy also expressed his mourning of the revolution's martyrs on Facebook. On 9 March 2011, when the Egyptian Army forcibly cleared the square, he was arrested and tortured. In October 2014, Essam was offered safe city residence for two years by the Malmö Municipality of Sweden. He is the first musician who has been offered this by Malmö but two writers have been offered it before. In addition to the residence permit, he also gets accommodation. He describes his situation as an artist in Egypt as \"terrible\" and is happy he can come to Sweden to study. Essam says it will be the first time he has the chance to study music, that he will keep make music and be an ambassador of the Egyptian revolution. Essam was featured on the 2014 compilation Songs from a Stolen Spring that paired Western musicians with artists from the Arab Spring. On the album, Essam's \"Bread, Freedom\" was meshed with Mighty Sam McClain's performance of \"If I Can Dream\". His 2015 release \"Foul Cavier\" was also featured on Firebrand Records' album \"A New World in Our Songs.\""

A staunch German nationalist, he affirmed the divinely appointed role of Germany in the salvation of the world, and did not support the Weimar republic. Seeberg was part of the movement for the modern revival of Luther and Reformation studies, including the repositioning of Martin Bucer as a mediating theologian between Lutheran and Reformed thought. His son, Erich Seeberg went on to become a significant theologian in his own right at the University of Berlin."

His elder brother Henry III continued the main Baden-Hachberg line at Hochburg castle in Emmendingen. In 1311 Lord Lüthold II of Rötteln made Rudolf his co-ruler at Rötteln Castle. This established the foundation for the rise of the Hachberg-Sausenberg line. Rudolf himself died before Lüthold. In 1315, Lüthold donated the Lordship of Rötteln to Rudolf's son Henry, who came of age in that year. He had three children: Henry, Otto I and Rudolf II."

He sat as a Conservative in the British House of Commons for County Cork from 1835 to 1837. Having successfully petitioned against the re-election in January 1835 of the radical Repeal MP Feargus O'Connor, on the grounds that O'Connor failed the property qualification then required of MPs, Longfield took the seat on 5 June. He married twice;firstly Harriett Elizabeth, the daughter of John M'Clintock, with whom he had one son (killed in the Crimea) and secondly Jemima Lucy, the daughter of Wyrley Birch of Norfolk, with whom he had three sons and two daughters. A relation, also named Richard Longfield (1734–1811), had sat in the Irish House of Commons for Charleville in County Cork (1761–68), for Cork City (1776–83 and 1790–96), and for Baltimore, County Cork (1783-1790), before becoming the first and last holder of the titles of Baron Longueville and Viscount Longueville in the Irish peerage; he had also been High Sheriff of the County (1758–61). Another relation, Mountifort Longfield, was the last to hold the Irish seat of Cork City before it ceased to exist with the Act of Union 1800."

At present, Robert is a 2-time world champion and 17-time national champion across 3 disciplines of practical and combat shooting. Besides this, he has been a Police Officer for over 10 years. Eight and a half of those years were spent as a full-time street cop while also being a member of the county's joint-department SWAT team. During that tenure he served as a firearm instructor for both the department and the SWAT team. Vogel won the USPSA National Championship in the Production Division two years in a row (2008 and 2009). In 2011, he won the Limited-10 Division. He has also won two world championships in Production and Stock-Pistol Division.

On 1 October 1795, was created Baron Longueville, of Longueville in the County of Cork and on 29 December 1800, he was created Viscount Longueville some months after the extinction of that title in the Peerage of England. Both his titles became extinct on his death in 1811."

  "text" : "Robert Jay Wolff (1905–1978) was an early pioneer of the American abstract art. His paintings are in the collections of the Brooklyn Museum and the Guggenheim. Born in Chicago, Illinois, he attended Yale University and the Ecole Des Beaux Arts in France. An educator as well as an artist, Wolff was a professor of art at Brooklyn College and was chairman of the department from 1946 to 1964. He has written numerous articles on art and is the author-designer of the widely known educational portfolio Elements of Design, published by the Museum of Modern Art. He also wrote at least three children's books about color. Robert Jay Wolff's formal art training began with night school at the Chicago Art Institute in 1928 and ended with a few months in the sculpture atelier of the French academician Henri Bouchard at the Ecole des Beaux Arts in Paris in 1930. Remaining in Paris, Wolff worked independently: \"My masters were the stone cutters of archaic Greece. The bronze sculptures of Charles Despiau seemed to me the only contemporary works that could approach the purity and grandeur of the stone figures of the Sixth Century B.C.,\" he recalled. \"Much of my time, when not working, was spent in the far conrner of the basement of the Louvre surrounded by ancient Greece.\" Paris in 1929 and 1930 was alive with the new art of the School of Paris, and Wolff saw paintings by Miro, Matisse, Picasso, and Braque and the sculpture of Brancusi, Zadkine, Gonzales, Archipenko. \"They all held an inescapable fascination for young and uncommitted eyes,\" he wrote years later.Wolff returned to Chicago in 1932, where he continued to work in sculpture. \"I worked always from life, mostly heads; and though a certain likeness always resulted my first concern was with the sculpture as an object, as a fully realized volume of planes intersecting planes, of an infinite diversity of contours, of surfaces patiently growing to the fullness of a living essence. Wolff spent hours drawing. \"My studio in Chicago was a seventh-floor loft in an old building on Wacker Drive at Wabash Avenue. My windows faced west, and looked down on the busy Chicago River. The river stretched out before me, its bridges one after the other rising and descending with the coming and going of boats and ships of all kinds, large and small. The tall buildings of the Loop towered over me to the south while across the river to the north and west there was the contrast of dingy old warehouses and wharfs.\"\"Between 1929 and 1931 I had done a series of wash drawings from my window high up in Passy overlooking Paris and it was in these that I discovered how the aggressive tangibility of spaces could dissolve the concrete object world.\"Wolff's sculpture received prizes in juried shows at the Chicago Art Institute in 1933 and 1934, and in a one-man exhibition in 1935. But the artist was already turning from sculpture toward painting, what he called, \"exciting but, in a sense, terrifying excursions into this new and strange realm of subjectively expressive abstraction.\" From 1936 on Wolff expressed himself in abstract painting: \"Spaces of magic light and vivid color, emptied of fixed points of reference, of self-enclosed objects and locally isolated things, color spaces containing only the heavy black lines of brush strokes that defined their limits; this was what emerged....with a kind of furious aimlessness. I was not sure what it was that was happening, but I knew that what ever it was it was vividly alive. This was the here and now of my life. I had taken the long, final step out of the shelter of art history and I found that I was quite alone.\"Wolff became a member of Abstract American Artists in 1937 and exhibited with the group. Wolff joined with Laszlo Moholy-Nagy and Gyorgy Kepes in 1938 when they established the Chicago Institute of Design, the American revival of the German Bauhaus school. After World War II Wolff was professor of Art at Brooklyn College, where as department chairman his faculty included Ad Reinhardt, Burgoyne Diller, Stanley Hayter, Carl Holty and Mark Rothko. Wolff's book Essays on Art and Learning, was published in 1971.Wolff's work is represented in collections including: Art Institute of Chicago, Brooklyn Museum of Art, estate of Alexander Calder, estate of Marcel Breuer, Guggenheim Museum of Art, Rhode Island School of Design Museum, Tate Gallery in London, and the Wadsworth Athenaeum."

A resident of Carmel, California, he practiced primarily in the central California coastal region, and was responsible for a variety of eclectic buildings, most notably the Monterey County Court House and the King City Joint Union High School Auditorium, both listed on the National Register of Historic Places. He worked closely with sculptor Joseph Jacinto Mora on several of his projects. Stanton was born in Detroit, Michigan in 1900. His mother was a singer in the B.O. Whitney Opera Company. Stanton joined the U.S. Navy during World War I, then graduated from the Manual Arts High School in Los Angeles, California. From there he went on to architectural studies at the University of California, Berkeley, where he was involved in theater productions. Following his studies he went on a grand tour of Europe. On returning to the United States he worked in Pasadena, California for architect Wallace Neff, gaining licenses for architecture and real estate. In 1935 Stanton opened his own office in the Del Monte Hotel in Monterey, establishing a practice that included school and hospital work in the Monterey area and across the San Joaquin Valley. In addition to the Monterey County Court House and King City High School Auditorium, Stanton designed schools in Monterey, the San Benito County Hospital, the Salinas General Hospital and buildings at Fort Ord. Stanton met his wife Virginia at Berkeley. They had three children. Stanton died in 1983."

  "text" : "Robert Millhouse (1788–1839) was an English Spenserian poet, born in Nottingham, England. Contemporaneously compared to Robert Bloomfield and John Clare, he too obtained some fame as a provincial poet, though his own life was affected by his serial marriages, ill-health and poverty. His Poetical Blossoms was somewhat notably edited by fellow Nottingham poet, clergyman and antiquary Reverend Luke Booker, in 1823."

  "text" : "Ronald Edwin James \"Ronnie\" Milne  (April 11, 1921 – February 9, 2014) was a singer and band director. He was also a composer and musical arranger who is known for his band arrangements and original compositions. He spent his formative years and the first years of his career in the United Kingdom. He subsequently auditioned to join the Canadian Army as a musician, was accepted in the rank of sergeant, and immigrated to Canada in 1953. He left school in 1935 at age 14 and, along with his older brother Douglas, joined a juvenile Band and toured Britain for several years. In 1939 he enlisted in the Welsh Guards Band despite Scottish heritage. In 1942 he won 1st prize for a Jazz Composition at the Professional \"Jazz Jamboree\" for his composition \"October Mood\" which he now confesses he rather dislikes. He came to prominence in 1949 when he co-founded, in conjunction with Cliff Adams, Dick James, and others, the vocal group the Stargazers, which quite quickly came to enjoy considerable commercial success. The group appeared on such BBC Radio programmes as Workers' Playtime, and its fans included Queen Elizabeth II. Milne not only sang but also contributed arrangements. He came from a family of musicians (his father played at one point in the orchestra of the Paris Opera) and he was himself a skilled viola player. For a time he played viola in the London Symphony Orchestra. Quoting from the Canadian Armed Forces Tattoo 1967 LP jacket, \"Captain R. E. J. Milne, director of music of the Canadian Guards band, emigrated to Canada in 1953 after a distinguished musical career in his native Britain. He was playing in bands at age 14, studied at the Royal College of Music in London and played viola in the London Symphony Orchestra. Venturing into more popular forms of music after winning first prize in a jazz-writing competition, he arranged during the 1940's for Britain's big bands - Stanley Black, Geraldo, George Melachrino - and was staff arranger for the Ted Heath Orchestra. Captain Milne also played trumpet in big bands, formed and sang in a vocal group and worked extensively in radio and television in Britain.\" In Canada, he pursued for many years a military career, eventually becoming commissioned as a director of music and known as an arranger of music for band. His Auprès de ma blonde continues to be played by many wind ensembles. On the side, he continued to arrange and perform popular music in a non-military context. After retiring from the Canadian Armed Forces with the rank of Captain he took up another career as a teacher of string instruments at Nepean High School in Ottawa. He died at age 92 in Ottawa, Ontario, on February 9, 2014. The high point of his military career was arguably the Tattoo that took place in 1967 to mark the centenary of the creation of the Dominion of Canada. He was in charge of the music for this event, which concluded with a performance of his Marche Vanier, a work dedicated to George Vanier, the Governor General who had died just months before."

Weller is a landscape architect and former co-director (with Vladimir Sitta) of Australian landscape architecture firm Room 4.1.3. whose built projects include the \"Garden of Australian Dreams\" at the National Museum of Australia in Canberra, ACT. The built garden attracted controversy for its radical design. He is also identified as a major proponent for the Elizabeth Quay project in Perth, Western Australia, and this can be found in the contents of Boomtown where he uses quotes from various supporters and detractors of the project. Weller's design work has been exhibited in the Museum of Contemporary Art in Sydney (1998) as a finalist in the Seppelt Australian Art Awards and in the Venice Biennale (2004). In 2002 his design was selected as a finalist in the Pentagon Memorial competition in Washington, D.C. and in 2005 he was a finalist in the Tsunami Memorial competition in Thailand. His early work (1990 to 1995) as consultant to Berlin landscape architecture firm Muller, Knippschild Wehberg was heavily awarded in European design competitions. Weller gave the Frederick Law Olmsted Memorial Lecture at the Harvard Graduate School of Design in 2011 and has been a regular commentator on planning and design issues. He is author of several books including Room 4.1.3: Innovations in Landscape Architecture (2005), Boomtown 2050: Scenarios for a Rapidly Growing City (2009) and Made in Australia: The Future of Australian Cities (2013)."

  "text" : "Reza Shahabi (Persian: رضا شهابي, also known as Reza Shahabi Zakaria) is an Iranian trade unionist who has been imprisoned on political charges since June 2010. Reza Shahabi is, or was, the treasurer of the Syndicate of Workers of Tehran and Suburbs Bus Company labor union in Tehran, Iran's capital. He has been detained in Evin Prison since June 2010. On 14 April 2012 was sentenced to six years imprisonment by Branch 15 of the Islamic Revolutionary Court of Tehran—five years for \"gathering and colluding against state security\", and one year for \"spreading propaganda against the system\". He was also been fined 70 million rial (US$5,700) and banned from all trade unionist activities for five years. According to his lawyer, the prosecution is seeking to bring a fresh charge of Moharebeh (\"enmity against God\") for alleged contact with the People's Mojahedin Organization of Iran (PMOI), a banned opposition organization advocating the overthrow of the Islamic Republic of Iran. According to the International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH) and other rights groups Shahabi’s state of health has deteriorated in custody, but prison authorities have not granted him appropriate medical treatment. One source told the FIDH, \"doctors told him after an MRI that some of the vertebra in his neck have deteriorated and are in need of surgery followed by six months of complete rest, and that without hospitalization his left side might become paralyzed ... On January 31, 2012, he was transferred to hospital for surgery, but was returned to prison later without an operation, because of the high risks.\"  On 22 November 2011 he went on a hunger strike in protest of the Evin Prison authorities’ lack of medical treatment and attention to his illness. According to Amnesty International this was one of \"numerous hunger strikes\" in protest at the conditions in which he is held. Since around February 2012, he has complained that one side of his body was numb. However, it was not until 30 April that the prison authorities took him to hospital. A Reza Shahabi Defence Committee has been created to work for his release. Amnesty International designated Shahabi a prisoner of conscience, \"convicted solely for his peaceful trade union work\", and called for his immediate and unconditional release."

  "text" : "Rudolf Otto Neumann (29 June 1868, Seifhennersdorf - April 5, 1952, Hamburg) was a German hygienist. He studied pharmacy and medicine at the Universities of Greifswald, Leipzig, Erlangen and Würzburg, receiving his habilitation in 1902 at the University of Kiel. In 1904 he relocated to Hamburg, where he was appointed departmental head of the state hygienic institute. During the same year he was part of an expedition to Brazil in order to research yellow fever. From 1906 to 1910 he worked at the institute of hygiene at the University of Heidelberg, followed by a professorship in hygiene and bacteriology at the University of Giessen. In 1914 he was appointed director of the hygiene institute at the University of Bonn, and in 1922 succeeded William Philipps Dunbar (1853–1922) as director of the hygiene institute at the University of Hamburg. Neumann participated in many scientific trips during his career, including extended journeys to the Far East, the United States and Central America in 1928–1931. As a scientist his work embraced bacteriology, tropical pathology, parasitology, food hygiene and nutrition. In the field of nutrition physiology he is renowned for his experiments involving metabolism. In his studies of nutrition, he was particularly interested in the protein quantity intake requirements for humans. He was the author of over 125 scientific works, including books on bacteriology that he co-authored with Karl Bernhard Lehmann (1858–1940) that were later translated into English: \n*  \"Atlas and principles of bacteriology\" (1897) \n*  \"Atlas and principles of bacteriology and text-book of special bacteriologic diagnosis\" (1901) \n*  \"Bacteriology; especially determinative bacteriology\" (1930–31)."

In 1331 he was commissioner of assize for Jersey, Guernsey, Alderney and Sark, and in the same year became he Chief Justice of the Irish Common Pleas. In 1332 he received an unspecified reward for his good services in Ireland and a grant of lands at Malahide, near Dublin city. In 1334 he returned to England to become a judge of the Court of King's Bench; he was transferred to the Court of Common Pleas and then back to King's Bench; he also served on a commission of array in Yorkshire. In the late 1330s, the poor quality of the Irish judges was giving great concern to the English Crown: the Lord Chancellor of Ireland, Thomas Charlton, Bishop of Hereford, was instructed to remove those Irish judges who were considered to be unfit for office and replace them with judges of English birth. Scardeburgh was selected for his old position of Chief Justice of Common Pleas in Ireland to replace Simon Fitz-Richard, but Fitz-Richard fought a successful campaign to retain his place and Scardeburgh did not then come over to Ireland. In 1344, he finally returned to Ireland as Lord Chief Justice of Ireland with custody of the seals of both Benches and the fees attaching to them. He was still alive seven years later."

  "text" : "Rachel Pinney (11 July 1909 – 19 October 1995) was a British doctor who pioneered therapeutic approaches to children's development in the 1960s which she termed Creative Listening, and Children's Hours. From 1927- 1934 she was a member of the clandestine Ferguson’s Gang, a group of eccentric philanthropists who donated money to the National Trust and other rural conservation appeals. In her alter-ego as Red Biddy, Rachel, cloaked and masked delivered Ferguson’s Gang’s first donation to the National Trust offices in 1933. The delivery of £100 in silver for the endowment of Shalford Mill to the National Trust was reported in the Times newspaper. Unorthodox in many ways, Rachel kept a vow of silence on Wednesdays, and was a committed Peace Activist."

Torres was an unsuccessful candidate for the Republican nomination for Texas Comptroller of Public Accounts in the primary election held on March 4, 2014. He finished last with 57,255 votes (4.7 percent). The two top votegetters, State Senator Glenn Hegar of Katy and State Representative Harvey Hilderbran of Kerrville, were expected to meet in a runoff election on May 27, 2014, pending a change in Hegar's 49.99 percent primary tabulation. However, Hilderbrand, who finished with 26 percent of the ballots cast, announced on March 7 that he was ending his campaign and endorsed Hegar as the Republican nominee. A fourth candidate in the race, Debra Medina, is an activist with the Tea Party movement and a long-time backer of Ron Paul for U.S. President."

During the 1926 census, he traveled from town to town to conduct research on the life in the rural homes of Italy. Its first volume, which came to light in 1938, was titled La casa rurale in Toscana (The Farm-house in Tuscany). In this research on Tuscan farmhouses, Biasutti contributed to the methods of anthropological research by first giving a thorough description of the geographic reality in which the object to be studied is contained. In 1905, Biasutti explored Eritrea, and in 1914 visited, he visited Tibet, as well as Cyrenaica and Rhodes. He also explored the United States of America in 1912 and Egypt in 1925."

  "text" : "Rosemarie Springer (also Rosemarie Alsen, née Lorenz, born July 5, 1920) is a German equestrian. Born in Danzig on July 5, 1920, she was the daughter of Werner Lorenz, who would later become an SS member and head of the Hauptamt Volksdeutsche Mittelstelle in Nazi Germany. She first rode a horse at the age of two, sitting on her father's lap, and took up equestrianism at a young age. Her career was interrupted by World War II, however, and she served as a nurse during the conflict. She did not resume riding until 1950 but, soon after, her talents were spotted at horse show in Berlin. Among other international appearances, she participated in the individual dressage event at the 1960 Summer Olympics in Rome, where she finished seventh in a field of seventeen competitors. She retired from active competition in the late 1970s, having been the German national champion in women's dressage seven times. Following her competitive career, Springer took up judging and training, the latter of which still occupies her time as of 2012. In her late 80s she continued to ski twice a year and occasionally ride in informal tournaments in Germany. She married cement manufacturer Horst-Herbert Alsen in 1941 and divorced him in 1953 to marry Alsen's friend, journalist Axel Springer. This union that lasted until 1961, when Springer left her to marry Helga Ludewig."

He was also founder of the Reading Blue Coat School and fought in the Royalist army in the English Civil War. Aldworth was the son of Richard Aldworth of Wargrave, Berkshire and his wife Amy Persons, daughter of Thomas Persons of Great Milton, Oxfordshire. He was a student at Middle Temple in 1637.

He fought at the Second Battle of Newbury and at Bristol. After the War, in 1646, Aldworth founded the Reading Blue Coat School for 24 boys to be dressed in blue coats. That same year, he petitioned to compound on the Oxford articles and later escaped to the Netherlands. In 1650 he returned to England and compounded for £200. After the Restoration Aldworth became J.P. for Bekshire in July 1660, Commissioner for assessment for Berkshire in August 1660 and Secretary to William Juxon, Archbishop of Canterbury in September 1660. He was auditor of land revenues for Yorkshire, Northumberland and county Durham from 1661. In 1661, he was elected Member of Parliament for Reading in the Cavalier Parliament. He also became freeman of Canterbury and Reading. He became J.P for Wiltshire in 1662 and was commissioner for loyal and indigent officers for Berkshire. In 1663 he became commissioner for assessment for Wiltshire and in 1665 for Westminster and also for Kent. In 1668 he became additional auditor of imprests. He was a Deputy Lieutenant after 1670. In 1672 he became chief auditor and sub commissioner for prizes. He was commissioner for recusants in 1675. Aldworth lived at Stanlake Park at Ruscombe in Berkshire and, dying at the age of 66, was commemorated by a memorial in the parish church.

(1917), the Metropolitan (1918), the York (1919), the Strand (1920, Cumberland, Maryland), and the Lincoln Theatre (Washington, D.C.) (1922). Geare was also the original architect selected for Washington’s Tivoli Theatre (Washington, D.C.), but following the Knickerbocker disaster he was replaced by noted architect Thomas W. Lamb. Lamb was also commissioned to rebuild the Knickerbocker, afterward known as the Ambassador. The initial coroner's jury found that the theater victims had met their deaths because of faults in the construction and design of the building, and held Geare and others connected with its building for the action of the grand jury. The grand jury indicted him and four others on charges of manslaughter, though none was convicted. Geare took his own life on August 20, 1927. Of his theaters, only the Apollo, Lincoln, and York survive—the Apollo and Lincoln receiving historic landmark status in 1979 and 1993 respectively."

  "text" : "Robin Lynn Holcomb is an American singer, songwriter and pianist. Her musical style combines avant-garde jazz scenes, classical-themed compositions, and country or folk Americana. The New York Times described her music as \"a new American regionalism, spun from many threads -- country rock, minimalism, Civil War songs, Baptist hymns, Appalachian folk tunes, even the polytonal music of Charles Ives. The music that results is as elegantly simple as a Shaker quilt, and no less beautiful.\" Despite her eclectic output, she has said that she doesn't try to \"genre mash\" intentionally \"...it just kind of comes up because it's what's in the air. I am drawn repeatedly to hymn-type harmonies. I was fascinated by Civil-War songs when I was a kid. I come back to those things.\" She also describes her style as \"minimalism without being a minimalist...when I write poetry, I go for the fewest number of words that evoke a lot or let the readers connect the dots, or relate it to their own experience, and the same with music.\" Holcomb began playing professionally in New York, in an avant-garde scene that involved her future husband Wayne Horvitz as well as John Zorn, Elliott Sharp, and Eugene Chadbourne. Her work during that period was recorded in the 1988 album, Larks, They Crazy. Her subsequent albums focus more on songwriting."

Weitman, MGM produced its last run of classic films, including Dr Zhivago (1965), The Dirty Dozen (1967) and 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968). A series of flop films such as The Shoes of the Fisherman and Ice Station Zebra saw him removed from his position as president in 1969. He was replaced by Louis F. Polk Jr. and was instead appointed chairman. In May 1969 as MGM was headed towards a $6 million loss for the first half of the year, O'Brien resigned as chairman and was replaced by Edgar Bronfman, Sr., the largest shareholder of MGM."

  "text" : "Ralph Erskine Cleland (20 October 1892 – 11 June 1971) was an American botanist. In 1947, he was the President of the Botanical Society of America. He was also a professor at the Department of Botany at Indiana University. Cleland's most seminal field of research concerned the genetics of the plant genus Oenothera. He discovered the structures of linked rings of meiotic chromosomes (not to be confused with ring chromosomes) that, by their interference with functions such as chromosomal crossover explained the unusual genetics and reproduction of plants in the genus Oenothera. The standard author abbreviation R.E.Cleland is used to indicate this individual as the author when citing a botanical name."

In 1997, she was appointed to the job of director at the Museum of African Art. Walker stated of her intentions: \"We have broadened our scope. We could certainly be a stronger presence in the wider world. So visibility and service are going to need some work. We always want to improve. We aspire to perfection. Our education programs are very good -- more people need to know about them, to let the wider public know what we are doing.\" During her tenure, the Museum showed an exhibition of art works from the Nigerian town of Oshogbo, including work by Adebisi Akanji, which had been commissioned in 1966 and donated to the Museum of African Art in 1994 by the collector and philanthropist, Waldemar A.

  "text" : "Rosemary Helen Lowe-McConnell (née Rosemary Helen Lowe) (24 June 1921 – 22 December 2014) was an English ichthyologist, ecologist, and limnologist known for research on tilapia and aquaculture. Working in the tropical waters of Africa and South America, Lowe-McConnell was a pioneer in the study of tropical fish ecology and an early adopter of the use of scuba diving for scientific research. Lowe-McConnell was educated at Howell's School in Denbigh, Wales before receiving B.S., M.Sc., and D.Sc. degrees from the University of Liverpool. Following World War II, in 1945, Lowe-McConnell conducted a survey of tilapia fisheries in the southern part of Lake Nyasa, continuing the previous survey done in 1939 by Ethelwynn Trewavas, Kate Ricardo Bertram, and John Borley. Lowe-McConnell received no support from any fisheries research organisations for this survey and relied heavily on local fishermen for assistance with her research. As a result of these studies, Lowe-McConnell produced a valuable account of the tilapia fishery that formed a basis for subsequent investigation into Malawian cichlids. In the survey, Lowe-McConnell identified five tilapiine species, as well as studied other economically viable fish, including Labeo mesops. In 1948, Lowe-McConnell studied as a Research Officer in the British Overseas Research Service on the Ugandan shores of Lake Victoria. Here, she helped found the East African Fisheries Research Organisation and briefly served as its Acting Director. Her research again focused again on tilapia as a potential fisheries species. During this time, she assisted many researchers, including Hugh Cott on his crocodile studies and Humphry Greenwood in his research on haplochromine cichlids. Lowe-McConnell's research during this period served as a foundation for later assessments of the impact fishing and other human activities have on food fishes. After Rosemary married the geologist Richard McConnell on December 31, 1953, she was required to resign from the British Colonial Service due to the organization's marriage bar. This rule prevented the permanent employment of a married woman in the British Public Service. Soon after their wedding, the McConnells moved to the Bechuanaland Protectorate, where their joint research focused on Botswanan natural history. During this time, Lowe-McConnell was appointed as the ichthyologist on the R.V. Cape St Mary to conduct marine fieldwork on the unexplored Guiana shelf. She also developed her Okavango fish collection, now housed in the Natural History Museum, London. In 1955, she described four new species and subspecies of tilapias in Lake Jipe and the Pangani River. In 1957, Richard became director of the Geological Survey in British Guiana and Lowe-McConnell provided research support. She was also hired by the Guiana Department of Agriculture and Fisheries to conduct fish surveys in unstudied areas, which provided a foundation for studying the diverse and ecologically complex Rupununi fish communities. Her 1959 paper on the differences between tilapia species served as the basis for Ethelwynn Trewavas' division of tilapiine fish genera. When Richard retired in 1962, the McConnells moved back to England, where Lowe-McConnell joined the Natural History Museum, London as an Associate. While at the museum, Lowe-McConnell worked closely with Ethelwynn Trewavase on their extensive collections and global research. In 1968, Lowe-McConnell was appointed as ichthyologist on the Royal Society of London/Royal Geographical Society Xavantina Cachimbo Expedition to northeastern Mato Grosso, Brazil. She traveled to Gatun Lake in Panamá in 1979 to assist Thomas Zaret in studying the impact of an introduced cichla species. Lowe-McConnell was widely known as a leader in her field and engaged with numerous international conferences, projects, and publications. Her work was requested by global organizations, including the Food and Agriculture Organization, United Nations Development Programme, and the International Center of Living Aquatic Resources Management. During the 1980s through the early 2000s, Lowe-McConnell worked with Great Lakes research projects and governance bodies, including the Lake Victoria Fisheries Organization. In 1997, Lowe-McConnell was awarded the Linnean Medal of Zoology by the Linnean Society of London. Lowe-McConnell continued to remain active in her field until her death on 22 December 2014 at St. George’s Park in Ditchling, England."

These roles ranged from tickled train passenger in the former to the hero's sidekick in Jab Pyar Kisi Se Hota Hai (1961) and Tumsa Nahin Dekha (1957). He was known for his big stomach and mirthful demeanor. Avtar began his career in the late-1930s and early 1940s, as a character actor. Over the 1950s he transitioned into a comedian as he began to put on more weight. Avtar's last film credit was in 1981."

  "text" : "Rebekah West Harkness (April 17, 1915 – June 17, 1982) also known as Betty Harkness, was an American composer, sculptor, dance patron, and philanthropist who founded the Harkness Ballet. Her marriage to William Hale \"Bill\" Harkness, an attorney and heir to the Standard Oil fortune of William L. Harkness, made her one of the wealthiest women in America. Born Rebekah Semple West in St. Louis, Missouri, she was the second daughter of three children of a socially prominent stockbroker, Allen Tarwater, and Rebekah Cook (Semple) West. Raised primarily by a series of nannies, Harkness took up dancing and ice skating to lose weight and was highly disciplined in both endeavors. She attended the Rossman School and John Burroughs School in St. Louis, then Fermata, a finishing school in Aiken, South Carolina. Harkness was friends with a young Potter Stewart, who she affectionately called \"Potsie\"; their relationship was written about by her biographer Craig Unger. After graduating in 1932, she and a group of female friends formed the Bitch Pack, a kind of sub-culture of local debutantes who enjoyed subverting society events—lacing punchbowls with mineral oil or performing stripteases on banquet tables. Later in life, she studied in Fontainebleau, France, with Nadia Boulanger, the Institut Jaques-Dalcroze in Geneva, and Mannes College of Music, New York. She also studied orchestration with Lee Hoiby and received a DFA degree from the Franklin Pierce College in Rindge, New Hampshire, in 1968. Harkness married Charles Dickson Pierce, on June 10, 1939 (divorced 1946); married Harkness, on October 1, 1947 (died, August 1954); married Benjamin H. Kean (a physician), in 1961 (divorced 1965); married Niels Lauersen (a physician), in 1974 (divorced 1977). She had three children: (first marriage) Allen Pierce (b. 1940); Anne Terry Pierce (b. 1944); (second marriage) Edith Harkness. Edith Harkness, her only child with Bill Harkness, was in and out of mental institutions and eventually committed suicide. Her other daughter, Terry Pierce, had a severely brain-damaged baby who died at age 10. Allen Pierce, Harkness' only son, shot and killed a man in a brawl and was charged with second-degree murder. In the 1960s, Harkness became well known as a philanthropist and patron of the arts. Through the Rebekah Harkness Foundation, Harkness sponsored Jerome Robbins and the Robert Joffrey Ballet. When the Joffrey Ballet refused to rename their company in Harkness' honor, she withdrew funding and hired most of the Joffery dancers to her new company, the Harkness Ballet. In addition to founding the Harkness Ballet, Harkness launched a ballet school and home for the company called Harkness House, as well as a refurbished 1,250-seat theater, which presented the Harkness Ballet and other dance companies to New York audiences. Through the William Hale Harkness Foundation, she sponsored construction of a medical research building at the New York Hospital and supported a number of medical research projects. In Blue Blood (1988), author Craig Unger writes that at the time of her death, her dance empire had been destroyed, she had been humiliated by the press, and most of her fortune had been lost through her capricious behavior. Harkness died of cancer on June 17, 1982, in her Manhattan home. Her ashes were placed in a $250,000 urn designed by Salvador Dalí."

  "text" : "Rafael David Poleo Isava (born 19 September 1937) is a Venezuelan journalist and politician. He is the editor and proprietor of the newspaper El Nuevo País, which he founded in 1988, and of the political magazine Zeta (named for the 1969 film Z), which he founded in 1973. Previously he was the director of El Mundo (appointed by Miguel Ángel Capriles Ayala at the age of 23, c. 1960) director of RCTV's news division for six years, and the founding editor of Bloque De Armas' Diario 2001, launched in 1973. He was at one time a member of the Venezuelan Chamber of Deputies for Democratic Action, and was elected to the Venezuelan Senate in the 1998 election. In 1991 Poleo published accusations of corruption against then-President Carlos Andrés Pérez, with El Nuevo País publishing a copy of a $400m cheque which it said had been deposited at the Bank of Credit and Commerce International in New York in the name of Pérez' mistress, Cecilia Matos. Poleo fled Venezuela after being warned by a Congressman that the DISIP secret police were going to kill him. The evening after his departure, his house was attacked and ransacked, and a military intelligence agent guarding it killed. An arrest warrant was then issued for Poleo, accusing him of staging the attack and killing the guard. Poleo continued to contribute columns to El Nuevo País and Zeta from exile in Florida. Poleo was only able to return in June 1993, after Andrés Pérez had been charged with corruption and temporarily left office, with the new government dropping the charges against Poleo. Pérez' temporary removal from office was made permanent in August 1993, and he was convicted of corruption and sentenced to 28 months' imprisonment in 1996. Poleo left Venezuela for Florida a second time after charges were brought over remarks he made in a Globovisión television programme in 2008. On 13 October 2008 on Aló Ciudadano he said \"I am concerned that Hugo (Chávez) may end his days like Mussolini did: hanging heels over head.\" According to El Universal, \"Government officials branded such remarks as solicitation to assassination, civil disobedience and rebellion against the public powers.\" Poleo has four children, three of them active in the field of journalism."

  "text" : "Rowley Hill, DD (1836–1887) was an Anglican clergyman who served in the Church of England as the Bishop of Sodor and Man from 1877 to 1887. Born in Derry, Ireland on 22 February 1836, he was the son of Sir George Hill, 3rd Baronet and Elizabeth Sophia Rea. He was ordained a priest in the Anglican ministry in 1860 and served a number of positions in the south of England before becoming Vicar of Sheffield in 1873. He was nominated Bishop of Sodor and Man by Queen Victoria on 9 August 1877 and consecrated on 24 August 1877. At his appointment he was the youngest bishop in Anglican communion. At the time of his appointment there was a proposal to add the Archdeaconry of Liverpool to the Diocese of Sodor and Man, but this met with considerable resistance both on the Isle of Man and in Liverpool, resulting in the formation of the Diocese of Liverpool in 1880. Hill resided on the island for most of the year and devoted considerable efforts to placing the Manx Convocation on a more professional footing, and revitalizing church life on the island, where he became extremely popular. He married twice, firstly in 1863 to Mary Chapman (died 1882) and secondly in 1884 to Alice Probyn (died 1930). He is mentioned in the song \"If you Want a Receipt for that Popular Mystery\" sung by Colonel Calverley in the operetta Patience (1881) by Gilbert and Sullivan. The song lists the elements of a Heavy Dragoon, including \"Style of the Bishop of Sodor and Man\". After nearly ten years of service to the Manx diocese, he died in London on 27 May 1887, aged 51. He is buried against the east wall of Brompton Cemetery in London, south of the main east-west path."

  "text" : "Rũnyenje Wa Mũkobo (sometimes spelled Rũnyenjĩ wa Mũkobo) was a \"Paramount Chief\" of the Embu people in Kenya in the early 20th century. Chief Runyenje was born in the Rũgusa area of the Embu district, near the present day location of the town of Rũnyenje's and its surrounding Runyenje's Constituency, which is named in honor of him. The details of the process that saw Rũnyenje become a Paramount Chief are not readily available, but sources within the family have it that he was recruited by the early European administrators who wanted to establish an administrative post around Runyenje's, initially to accompany them to Mbeere as a guide. On returning, he had won the confidence and trust of the Europeans owing to demonstrated ability and they installed him as a Chief. One of his surviving sons Karanja (Kĩthu) recently showed family members the exact place where the Chief was laid to rest back in 1939 the year he died. In addition to his administrative duties, the Chief was an elder among his people and a committed family man. He had more than ten wives and a host of elder friends and relations. Family sources trying to reconstruct their ancestral lineage trace the patriarch of the family as Mareru. Mareru had two sons Mũtema and Mũkobo. Mũkobo had a son Rũnyenje and a daughter Mwarwa Mũkobo. These tows had cousins Mũnoi and Masaria. The two family branches have remained close to this day although many of the more recently born family members do not know each other yet. The Chief had thirteen (13) sons and many daughters. Today 17 August 2012, only Karanja (1918) and Matĩ (1930) survive. Nguũ (1912) died on 8 January 2013 aged 100 years. Phares Njeru(1925) died in 2010 and is survived by his two wives, 12 children and their families. According to the Official Gazette of the Government of Kenya, Runyenje Wa Mukobo was nominated by the Government to serve as a member of the Embu District Local Native Council on 8 June 1925 and reappointed 14 June 1928. He also features in the list of Official Headmen for Kagaari Location on 12 September 1929. The family ancestral land is largely within the Rũguca area near the Present day Runyenje's township which was earlier on known as Ngabũrĩ. The land on which the current Embu East District Headquarters stands belonged to the Runyenje family as part of the larger Ega-Mataũ Rĩa Andũ a Njũkĩ clan although details of how the donation happened are available although family sources indicated that the Chief allowed the Government of the time (of which he was part) to set up the administrative station establishment on part of the family land. For this the family has always taken pride."

Ralph was possessed of land in three Oxfordshire townships in 1315, viz. Bourton, Milcome, and Barford, and in the same year was one of the custodes of the vacant bishopric of Winchester. He was summoned to the great council at Westminster for 27 May 1324. He was on several occasions in commissions of oyer and terminer in Southampton and Surrey in 1314, in Somerset, Dorset, Wiltshire, Southampton, and Gloucester in 1316, on special commissions to try persons who had spoiled Hugh le Despenser's manors, and Robert Lewer and his accomplices, who had attacked Odiham Castle in 1322, and in 1324 in Oxfordshire and Berkshire.

  "text" : "Rohan Spong (born 15 September 1981) is an Australian film director and photographer. Rohan studied film theory and practice at the University of Melbourne. Whilst living in Los Angeles in 2008, Rohan assembled his first feature-length documentary T is for Teacher (2009), about the experiences of four transgender school teachers in American schools. The film screened at a number of international festivals alongside Oscar contenders later that year. It was named by two Australian reviewers as amongst the best films to screen in Australian cinemas in 2009. In late 2011, Rohan completed another feature documentary All The Way Through Evening, about the music composed in New York's East Village amidst the early years of the HIV/AIDS pandemic. The film premiered in New York's East Village on 1 December 2011 (World AIDS Day). Rohan and the film's main subject (elderly concert pianist Mimi Stern-Wolfe) were invited as guests of New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg on World AIDS Day 2011 as part of an annual event held at Gracie Mansion. In June 2012, Rohan indicated via his Twitter account that there were plans for a series of charity screenings of the film in different cities worldwide on 1 December 2012 (World AIDS Day). All The Way Through Evening opened to critical acclaim and four star reviews in Australia on 29 November 2012. Phillipa Hawker of The Age newspaper described the film as: \"A graceful story of music and memory\", rating the film four stars. Don Groves of SBS marvelled at Spong's ability to single handedly bring the story to cinema: \"Multi-tasking as director, producer, cinematographer and editor, Spong has crafted a handsome-looking production despite working on a frugal budget. It’s an impressive effort\" and also gave the film four stars. Richard Watts of Artshub also gave the film four stars and named it amongst his most favourate films of the year, describing it as: \"an important film, and a beautiful one.\". Australian magazine FilmInk surmised the film as \"an incredibly affecting and important piece of cinema\". All The Way Through Evening was nominated for the Australian Film Critic's Association Award for Best Documentary of 2012, but ultimately lost to the Best Documentary Oscar Winner Searching For Sugar Man. Despite only expecting to run for a week in each city, the film ran for a total of thirteen weeks at Melbourne's Cinema Nova, outlasting a number of big budget films including The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey, Celeste And Jesse Forever and Perks of Being a Wallflower, closing in late February 2013. All The Way Through Evening finally opened theatrically in New York City at the Village East Cinema, on 6 December 2013. It was invited to screen at the The Library of Congress in Washington, D.C. on 25 June 2014. Spong and the film's subject, Mimi Stern-Wolfe attended this screening. In 2014, Rohan announced that he was working on the follow up to All The Way Through Evening, entitled Winter At Westbeth. The film charts a year in the life of Westbeth Artists Housing in New York City and profiles the lives of three ageing artists, including iconic Alvin Ailey and Martha Graham dancer Dudley Williams. It also features a brief appearance by All The Way Through Evening participant Mimi Stern-Wolfe. The film had its world premiere at the 60th Sydney Film Festival in June 2016, before screening at the 65th Melbourne International Film Festival in August."

  "text" : "Rebecca Talbot Perkins (February 14, 1866 – November 1, 1956) was an American businessperson, philanthropist, and activist from Brooklyn, New York. She was the founder of Talbot Perkins Children's Services. She was inducted into the National Women's Hall of Fame in 2009. Perkins was born Rebecca Clarendon Talbot in Brooklyn, the daughter of Joseph Talbot and the former Eliza Clarendon. She attended what is now known as the Chautauqua Institution and continued to work there for ten years after graduating. Joseph Talbot founded a real estate brokerage but died of influenza just a few years later, in 1890. Rebecca, still unmarried, took over the business at a time when it was rare for a woman to be in business at all, let alone running a firm. She married Agar Ludlow Perkins on September 5, 1895. Even while running the brokerage, she maintained an active involvement in charity and social activism. At various times, she led, among other organizations, the Alliance of Women's Clubs of Brooklyn, the People's Political League of Kings County, the Memorial Hospital for Women and Children, and the Welcome Home for Girls. In 1927, she founded (with the Alliance) The Rebecca Talbot Perkins Adoption Society, which later became Talbot Perkins Children's Services."

He was educated at Christ Church, Oxford and studied law at the Middle Temple. He was returned to Parliament for Bedford in 1754, a seat he held until 1761, and then sat as a Knight of the Shire for Bedfordshire between 1761 and 1780 and again between 1784 and 1785. In 1776 he was elevated to the Irish peerage as Baron Ongley, of Old Warden. (An Irish peerage did not oblige him to give up his seat in the House of Commons). Lord Ongley married Frances Gosfright, daughter and co-heir of Richard Gosfright, of Langton Hall, Essex, in 1763. They had two sons and four daughters. He died in October 1785 and was eventually laid to rest in a mausoleum in Old Warden churchyard built at his request in 1787 by his widow. He was succeeded in the barony by his eldest son, Robert."

On 6 May 1880 he married Esther Arnold, with whom he had four children. He established his own company in 1885, but was bankrupted in 1894. Ball served on Goulburn Council from 1887 to 1894, and was mayor from 1890 to 1891. After being discharged from bankruptcy he moved to Albury and was involved in the building of the waterworks; he also represented Albury in the New South Wales Legislative Assembly for a term from 1895 to 1898 as a Free Trade member. After his defeat he moved to Sydney, practising as a mechanical engineer. In 1904, Ball returned to the Legislative Assembly as the Liberal member for Corowa. From 1916 to 1920 he served as Secretary for Public Works and Minister for Railways. With the introduction of proportional representation in 1920 Ball, now a Nationalist, was elected as one of the members for Murray. He was Minister for Agriculture briefly from April to June 1922 before resuming his old position as Secretary for Public Works and Minister for Railways, in which he served until 1925. After single-member districts were re-introduced in 1927 he returned to his old seat of Corowa, and also spent the period from 1927 to 1930 as Minister for Lands. On 26 January 1926 he had married Lillie May Hume. In 1931 Ball defected to the Nationalists' coalition partner, the Country Party. He served in the Assembly until his death at Marrickville in 1937."

She took a gold medal at the 2008 Summer Paralympics as a handcyclist, and eight years later at Rio she won gold in the women's single sculls as a rower. She lost both her legs to Complex regional pain syndrome and cycles, in part, to manage the pain. She was born in Guildford, Surrey. Morris won two gold medals at the 2007 World Para-Cycling Championships in Bordeaux, France; she won the time trial and road race events in the women's category B races. This made her the first ever British hand-cyclist to be crowned a double World Champion. Morris was named to the team for Great Britain at the 2008 Summer Paralympics, where she competed in the road race and time trial in the HC A/B/C disability category for athletes who use a handcycle. She finished sixth in the road race but won the gold medal in the time trial; her time of 20 minutes 57.09 seconds was nearly three minutes faster than her nearest competitor. At the 2010 UCI Para-cycling Road World Championships held in Baie-Comeau, Canada, Morris won two gold medals. Her first came in the H3 category individual time trial; she won the event by over two minutes in a time of 23 minutes 34.71 seconds. Morris won her second gold medal in the road race, beating silver medallist Sandra Graf by over 80 seconds. Morris was selected to compete for Great Britain at the 2012 Summer Paralympics, where she was aiming to defend her title in the time trial and also to compete in the road race. In July 2012 her participation at the Games was placed in doubt after she was hit by a car during a time trial near her home in Farnham, Surrey. The incident left her with whiplash and shoulder injuries. In addition to her physical injuries Morris' handcycle was damaged in the crash, meaning she had to use her competition bike for training and order a new one for use in the Paralympics. She recovered in time to compete in her first event at the Games on 5 September. She subsequently took up rowing, in the ASW1x (arms and shoulders women's single sculls) event, came 5th at the 2014 World Rowing Championships in Amsterdam, and won the silver medal at the 2015 World Rowing Championships at Lac d'Aiguebelette in France, thus qualifying for the 2016 Paralympics."

  "text" : "Richard Bazley (born 28 November 1962 in Devon, England) is a film director. Although now a Director of Live Action his background is in animation and his credits include Disney’s Pocahontas, Hercules, Tarzan and a Lead Animator and Sequence Director on celebrated Warner Bros. Film The Iron Giant (Directed by Brad Bird), a project he had pitched 9 years earlier to Don Bluth Studios. Bazley started his career on the ground breaking Who Framed Roger Rabbit. A versatile artist Bazley animates in CG as well as traditionally and has also animated on Harry Potter - The Prisoner of Azkaban and The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. He also storyboards on Features and Series. A versatile Director Bazley has a background in CGI as well as Traditional 2D. Bazley who works on both sides of the Atlantic set up Bazley Films in the US and UK and produced the animated short The Journal of Edwin Carp narrated by Hugh Laurie (House). It was the first animated short created in Flash to be released Theatrically. Bazley also Co-wrote Flash Cartoons and Games with James Robertson and Bill Turner. Bazley moved into Directing on commercials and series with popular commercials for Sky and Go Compare. In 2012 he Directed two Episodes of Full English at Rough Draft Studios (USA), a TV show made for the UK’s Channel Four (2012). On this Bazley teamed up with Alex Scarfe, the son of Gerald Scarfe with whom he had worked closely on Disney’s Hercules. Through Argosy Film Group Bazley Directed the Lost Treasure Hunt, an animated half-hour pilot for a proposed TV Series. Lost Treasure Hunt was created by the award-winning feature animators behind Shrek, The Iron Giant, and Frozen. Combined with the work of nationally recognized educators and historians, Lost Treasure Hunt is a fast moving adventure and new type of history experience. In 2015 Bazley received two Emmy nominations for his work on the show. More recently Bazley has been developing Feature films and is attached to a number as Director. In 2011 Bazley teamed up with Gary Kurtz (Prod. Star Wars, Dark Crystal) and Paul Goodenough to set up the film production company GBK Hybrid based in London and Los Angeles. GBK Hybrid's first short Centurion Resurrection filmed in Bath has played at numerous Film Festivals and won numerous awards. The Chimeran, a Live Action/Animation Hybrid is the first film in development. Described as somewhere between Planet of the Apes and District 9 this is clearly not just another creature movie. With Gary Kurtz’s involvement it ensures that the film has depth and character with many sociological issues that take it out of the realms of regular Sci Fi. It is grounded in real scientific theory, is thought-provoking, and relevant to the human condition. GBK Hybrid’s first animated offering is Offbeat, an animated musical about a parallel musical world inhabited by anthropomorphised note characters which the main character Pick has to bring back into Harmony."

He was Master of the Horse to the Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales, a Gentleman of the Bedchamber to James VI and Charles I and Master of the Household to Charles I. He was knighted in 1609 and subsequently sworn of the Scottish Privy Council. In 1633, on the coronation of Charles I, he was raised to the Peerage of Scotland as Viscount of Belhaven, in the County of Haddington. Lord Belhaven married Nicola Moray, daughter of Robert Moray, in 1611. She died in childbed in November 1612. He had two children by his mistress, Elizabeth Whalley the sister of Edward Whalley, who was subsequently to be a regicide. They were both legitimised by Act of Parliament when he became a viscount at Charles I's coronation in 1633. His son John is assumed to have predeceased him, but his daughter Susanna Douglas married her cousin, Robert Douglas of Blackerston. On his death, his estate including the Gorbals Mansion House passed to his nephew and son-in-law. Lord Belhaven died at Edinburgh in January 1639 and was buried in Holyrood Abbey in Edinburgh where his monument remains today. As he had no sons the viscountcy died with him."

  "text" : "Robert Sutton (c. 1340 – 1430) was an Irish judge and Crown official. During a career which lasted almost 60 years he served the Crown in a variety of offices, notably as Deputy to the Lord Chancellor of Ireland, Chief Baron of the Irish Exchequer, Master of the Rolls in Ireland, and Deputy Treasurer of Ireland. A royal warrant of 1423 praises his \"long and laudable\" service. Little is known of his early life: the surname has been common in Ireland since the thirteenth century, especially in the south. William Sutton, who acted as his deputy and succeeded him as Master of the Rolls is thought to have been his nephew. He was appointed to the living of Trim, County Meath in 1370; later he became Archdeacon of Kells, and prebendary of St Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin and later of Ossory. He is mentioned as chief clerk in the Irish Chancery in 1373, an office he held jointly with Thomas de Everdon: an order in Council states that they should share the annual fee of £20. As a judge he served in a variety of offices over many years. He was appointed Master of the Rolls in 1377 and returned to that office at regular intervals over the next fifty years: his final warrant of appointment was granted in 1423, and apparently confirmed him in office for life. He also served as Deputy Lord Chancellor and Keeper of the Great Seal of Ireland on many occasions and was Deputy Escheator in1380. He was briefly Chief Baron of the Irish Exchequer in about 1401. In the political sphere he was summoned to the Irish Parliament at Kilkenny in 1390, was Deputy Treasurer in 1403, and was instructed to grant an amnesty to the noted Irish leader Art Mór Mac Murchadha Caomhánach (Art MacMurrough-Kavanagh) in 1409. In 1420 he witnessed the charter by which King Henry V guaranteed the liberties of the citizens of Dublin. In 1423 he was praised for his laudable service to five English monarchs. He died in 1430, when he must have been close to 90."

  "text" : "Ruth Sawtell Wallis (15 March 1895 – 21 January 1978) was an American academic and physical anthropologist. Wallis was born in Springfield, Massachusetts, to Joseph Otis Sawtell and Grace Quimby. She graduated from Radcliffe College in 1919 with a bachelor's degree in English. She then attended the school's graduate program in anthropology, traveling to Europe on a science fellowship to do research. She was the first to discover Azilian remains in France, uncovering two at Montardit, Ariège. Upon her return to the United States, Wallis switched to the anthropology program at Columbia University under Franz Boas. She assisted in one of Boas's most famous studies, an examination of head circumference and changes in head shape among immigrants. She then began studying growth and anthropometrics of young children; her doctoral thesis on that topic \"remains a standard study widely quoted today\". She was hired by the anthropology department at the University of Iowa in 1930. She married Wilson Dallam Wallis, a professor of anthropology at the University of Minnesota, in 1931, and took an assistant professorship in sociology at Hamline University. Ruth was later dismissed because \"it was unthinkable to have two employed academics in one family during the Depression\". On behalf of the Bureau of Home Economics, she undertook the largest ever study of children's growth, which resulted in the standardization of sizing for children's clothes. During the Second World War, Wallis examined labor statistics for the War Manpower Commission and helped coordinate the Japanese Language and Culture Program for the Army. She also began writing mystery novels. She helped create an ethnography of the Micmac in Nova Scotia in the 1950s, and studied other native peoples in both Canada and the United States. After moving to Connecticut with her family, Ruth became a sociology lecturer at Annhurst College in 1956; she eventually became a full professor before retiring in 1974."

Wilkinson started writing songs when she was very young. The Gods Were Angry With Me, a song she wrote at the age of 16, later became a hit for country singer Jim Reeves, who included it on several of his albums. Several of her songs were recorded by other people, including Bing Crosby and Peggy Lee. Always a lyricist, she often partnered with musician Watt Watkins to create their music. Wilkinson also wrote music, and submitted some demos with her own melodies."

  "text" : "Robert Stopford (12 February 1862 – 28 January 1926) was an English-born Australian politician. He was born at Upholland in Lancashire to property owner John Stopford and Jane Elizabeth, née Yates. He attended University College, Liverpool, and became a medical practitioner, working in Ireland and Southport before travelling to New Zealand in 1902 and settling in Wellington. In 1911 he arrived in Sydney and settled in Balmain, where he ran a children's clinic. Stopford had been a Liberal in England but supported the Labor Party in Australia and New Zealand until 1917, when he joined the Nationalist Party over the issue of conscription. From 1922 to 1925 he served as a Nationalist member of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly for Balmain. Stopford died in Balmain in 1926."

  "text" : "Raymond G. Frey (1941–2012) was Professor of Philosophy at Bowling Green State University, specializing in moral, political and legal philosophy, and author or editor of a number of books, including Interests and Rights: The Case Against Animals (1980), Euthanasia and Physician-Assisted Suicide (1998, with Gerald Dworkin and Sissela Bok), and The Oxford Handbook of Animal Ethics (2011, with Tom Beauchamp, eds.). Frey obtained his B.A. in philosophy in 1966 from The College of William and Mary, his M.A. in 1968 from the University of Virginia, and his D.Phil. in 1974 from the University of Oxford – where his supervisor was R. M. Hare – for a thesis on \"Rules and Consequences as Grounds for Moral Judgment\". David DeGrazia wrote in 1991 that Frey was one of five authors – along with Peter Singer, Tom Regan, Mary Midgley, and Steve Sapontzis – who had made significant philosophical contributions to the work of placing animals within ethical theory. Frey writes from a preference utilitarian perspective, as does Singer. Preference utilitarianism defines an act as good insofar as it fulfills the preferences (interests) of the greatest number. In his early work, Interests and Rights (1980), Frey disagreed with Singer – who in his Animal Liberation (1975) wrote that the interests of nonhuman animals must be included when judging the consequences of an act – on the grounds that animals have no interests. Frey argued that interests are dependent on desire, and that one cannot have a desire without a corresponding belief. He argued further that animals have no beliefs because they are unable to comprehend the concept of a belief (that is, they are unable to hold a second-order belief: a belief about a belief), which he argues requires language: \"If someone were to say, e.g. 'The cat believes that the door is locked,' then that person is holding, as I see it, that the cat holds the declarative sentence 'The door is locked' to be true; and I can see no reason whatever for crediting the cat or any other creature which lacks language, including human infants, with entertaining declarative sentences.\" He concludes that animals have no interests. Counter-arguments include that first-order beliefs may be held in the absence of second-order ones – that is, a non-human animal or human infant might hold a belief while failing to understand the concept of belief — and that human beings could not have developed language in the first place without some pre-verbal beliefs. Frey has since rejected some of his early conclusions. The importance of Interests and Rights, according to DeGrazia, lay in its rigorous treatment of the problem of animal minds and moral status."

McLachlan, who was inspired by both his father's photography and his own appreciation for the films Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid and Walkabout to choose his career path, would go on to find recognition as the chief cinematographer for the television series Millennium, for which he was scouted specifically. McLachlan's style on this series led to several industry awards and briefly became popular in the medium, as well as leading him directly to future work on Game of Thrones. He founded the documentary production company Omni Film Productions in the 1970s, later selling his share of the company."

He is also the founder of the Church of Belief Science. Academically, he is best known for his socially oriented theories of counseling and psychotherapy. In the mid-1980s he developed a “systemic theory of vocational rehabilitation”, which constitutes the first comprehensive social theory of vocational rehabilitation. He has been widely cited for his later work on advanced theories of psychotherapy, and he has been rated as having one of the highest publishing records among his peers. He published his first book, “Theories and Paradigms of Counseling and Psychotherapy” in 1992, which defined Kuhnian paradigms of mental health treatment. He then developed a fully social model of decision making, the social constructivism model, taking decisions out of the head, so-to-speak, and placing them within the sphere of social discourse (c.f., consensus decision making). His social theorizing advanced from that of social systems (in the 1980s Batesonian sense) to social constructions (in the 1990s and early 21st Century postmodern sense)."

One of the only instances he is mentioned in official government documents is in 1946. Towards the end of that year, Mob boss Tony Accardo ordered Pat Manno, Romie Nappi and several other Outfit associates down to Dallas, Texas in order to make sure local sheriff Steve Gutherie was copasetic with the Outfit’s expansion into Dallas. This meeting included the participation of the now infamous Jack Ruby, who had a great deal of connections to law enforcement in the State of Texas. This move ultimately met with failure. On December 18, 1946, the FBI reported that Romie Nappi was charged with attempted bribery of elected officials and held without bond."

  "text" : "Russ Brown is a personal injury lawyer specializing in motorcycle accidents. Born in San Jose, California, Brown began riding motorcycles when he was 16, racing at a dirt track in Santa Maria, California. Brown attended college at UCLA where he majored in marketing. Following his graduation from the San Fernando Valley College of Law, he passed the State Bar of California exam in 1970. After practicing general personal injury law for 5 years, Brown began representing motorcyclists almost exclusively in 1975. Brown has been involved in many nationally known movements for motorcyclist rights and awareness. Brown created Bikers Against Manslaughter - now called BAM - a group of over 1.5 million \"bikers helping bikers\" providing free breakdown and legal assistance. Brown fought against a mandatory law on motorcycle helmets in California during the 1980s. Brown believed \"forcing people to wear helmets is an infringement of their own personal liberties.\" In March 1990, Brown appeared on Today (NBC program) in a nationally televised debate with California Assemblyman Richard Floyd (California). In 1996, Brown won a case in California where a judge ruled that dogs were legal passengers on motorcycles. Brown recently had a street named after him in Sturgis, South Dakota."

He is also a member of the PLT group and, as such, responsible for the creation and maintenance of DrRacket. In addition to DrRacket, Findler has contributed numerous components to Racket and supervises its Web-based software library, called PLaneT. Findler is also a leading team member of the ProgramByDesign project. Findler received his PhD at Rice University under the direction of Matthias Felleisen. His dissertation was on the linguistics of software contracts, popularly known as design by contract. His work on software contracts provides a more careful accounting of blame, thereby helping programmers quickly home in on the faulty part of a software system. In addition to DrRacket and software contracts, Findler focuses on the design and implementation of a workbench for semantics engineers. This workbench, called Redex, is a tool for specifying and executing the reduction semantics of a programming language. It is already widely used by programming language researchers in the US and Europe. Most recently, SUN's Fortress research team used Redex to specify and explore key parts of their language. Findler served as the semantics editor of the Revised^6 Report on the Scheme programming language. He and his PhD student Jacob Matthews developed a Redex model of the core semantics, which is included as an appendix of the report. The appendix plays the same role as Standard ML's formal specification (Milner, Tofte, Harper, MacQueen) but is executable and thus can visualize individual examples."

  "text" : "Pierre André Marie Raymond Rollinat (2 September 1859, Saint-Gaultier – 27 December 1931) was a French herpetologist. He was related to the poet, Maurice Rollinat (1846-1903). As a young boy, Rollinat learned a love of animals from his great-uncle, an amateur ornithologist, and while a high school student in Châteauroux, he trained under a local taxidermist. As an adult, except for a period of time spent in the military, he lived his entire life in Argenton-sur-Creuse, where he kept a laboratory with a large adjacent garden. In his garden he set up various enclosures and vivaria in order to observe animal behavior close-up. Rollinat was dedicated to research of vertebrates native to central France, in particular reptiles and amphibians. His work included studies of breeding habits, hibernation, hatching of eggs and embryonic development. He took particular interest in the habits of the European pond turtle, which was one of a number of local species that he devoted an in-depth life history to. During his career he maintained correspondence with fellow herpetologists, George Albert Boulenger (1858-1937), Willy Wolterstorff (1864-1943) and Mario Giacinto Peracca (1861-1923)."

  "text" : "Richard Preston, 1st Earl of Desmond (died 28 October 1628), already created Lord Dingwall in 1609, a Scottish court favorite of King James VI of Scotland, was created Earl of Desmond, in Munster, in southwestern Ireland, by King James under his character of King James I of England and Ireland in 1619. He was also created Viscount Cullen and Baron Dunmore in Ireland. This was the third creation of the title; in its first creation, the Earldom of Desmond had been held by the Hiberno-Norman FitzGerald dynasty. After the failure of the Second Desmond Rebellion against Queen Elizabeth I of England, the Geraldine earldom was forfeit to the Crown in 1582 and all its heirs attainted. The title was created for the second time for James Fitzgerald – a pathetic creature of the Crown who died penniless and without issue. After Richard Preston's death, this creation became extinct in its turn. A fourth creation of the title passed to the family of the Earls of Denbigh. Alfred Webb tells us of this creation of the earldom of Desmond that: Thomas, 10th Earl of Ormond, in right of his mother, Joan FitzGerald, daughter of the 11th Earl of Desmond, claimed the Earldom after the death and attainder of all the heirs male. When his daughter was married to James I.'s Scotch favourite, Sir Richard Preston, the title was conferred on him. When the only child of the latter, a daughter, was about to be married to the son of the Earl of Denbigh, the title was passed to the intended bridegroom. The marriage never took place; yet the title was retained [by] the Earls of Denbigh."

In 1949, he was hired as a field representative based in Regina for the Saskatchewan Wheat Pool. In the following year, Brown became general secretary for the Saskatchewan CCF. He served in the provincial cabinet as Provincial Secretary, as Minister of Travel and Information, as Minister of Industry and Information and as Minister Responsible for the Saskatchewan Power Corporation. Brown was defeated by Donald Gilbert MacLennan when he ran for reelection to the provincial assembly in 1964. He then served as Director of Organization for the federal New Democratic Party. Brown resigned in 1965, moving to Estevan. He operated several businesses there and also served on city council. He was defeated by Ian Hugh MacDougall when he ran for the Souris-Estevan seat in the assembly in 1967 but subsequently defeated MacDougall in 1971. Brown died in office in Regina later that year at the age of 59."
