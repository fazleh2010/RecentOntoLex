He was the son of the astronomer Natalia Sergeyevna Yakhontova. In 1950, he graduated from the Oriental Faculty of Leningrad State University. In 1962–1963 he underwent a training at Beijing and later on visited Nanyang University (Singapore) from 1971 to 1972. He teaches at the Oriental Faculty of St. Petersburg State University. Yakhontov studied under Alexander Dragunov and developed many ideas of his teacher, in fact creating the Leningrad (St. Petersburg) school of Sino-Tibetan linguistics. He published dozens of articles, many of them being translated into English, Chinese and Japanese. In particular, he made major contributions to Old Chinese phonology, proposing the *l medial (now commonly treated as *r) and a rounded vowel *o, which led to the six vowel system that is now accepted by most researchers."

In 1933, he bought The Indian Express, (Madras), from Varadarajulu Naidu, an INC supporter who had founded it in 1934. The closure of The Free Press Journal caused The Indian Express to pass into the control of Ramnath Goenka. He was one of the seven initial shareholders of the Press Trust of India when it was founded in 1947. Sadanand never went to college and was a self-taught journalist. J. K. Singh calls him a great journalist but a poor business manager and a \"sad failure\". Rangaswami Parthasarathy calls him an able editor, an innovator and a fearless patriot."

  "text" : "Stanley Frank \"Stan\" Stearns (May 11, 1935 – March 2, 2012) was an American photographer who captured the iconic image of a three-year-old John F. Kennedy, Jr. saluting the coffin of his father, US President John F. Kennedy, at his father's funeral. Born in Annapolis, Maryland, Stearns spent four years in the United States Air Force as a photographer for Stars and Stripes before joining United Press International in 1958. Mr. Stearns covered the end of the Eisenhower administration, and rose to prominence after covering Kennedy's funeral and the presidential administrations of Lyndon Johnson and Richard Nixon. His image of the John-John salute is one of the most-published photographs in the world and was a front-runner for the Pulitzer Prize for Photography for 1964, but lost out to the photo of Jack Ruby shooting Kennedy's assassin, Lee Harvey Oswald. Stearns was elected president of the White House News Photographers Association in 1969, and hosted a black tie dinner for President Nixon and Vice President Agnew. After he left UPI in late 1970, Stearns returned to his hometown of Annapolis and opened a downtown studio. He photographed many well-known celebrities and politicians as well as prominent local residents, right up until his last days. His existing clients and archives are now maintained by his friend and fellow Annapolis photographer, David Anderson."

Born in Machida, Tokyo, he attended Saku Chosei High School and began to establish himself nationally in 2010. He was the fastest in his stage at the Japanese High School Ekiden Championship and came second in the junior race at the Chiba Cross Country. This gained him a place on the Japanese junior team for the 2010 IAAF World Cross Country Championships, where he went on to finish in 32nd place. On the track that year he set a personal best of 28:35.75 minutes in Tokyo then finished eighth at the 2010 World Junior Championships in Athletics. He graduated high school and enrolled at Waseda University in late 2010. In November he ran at the Ageo City Half Marathon and set a Japanese and Asian junior record time of 1:01:47 hours to win the race. In 2011 he ran a 5000 metres track best of 13:31.27 minutes and came second over 10,000 metres at the Hyogo Relays. Osako was chosen to represent his country at the 2011 Summer Universiade, where he defeated Stephen Mokoka in the 10,000 m to take the gold medal, becoming the first Japanese since Yasuyuki Watanabe to win that title.

He took a degree from Amherst College, then studied law at Harvard Law School, and then commenced a legal practice in Lowell, Massachusetts. Haven had a keen interest in the history of New England before the Revolution, and began publishing papers in 1836. His interest then turned towards the archeology of the Americas. In September 1837 he was appointed librarian of the American Antiquarian Society, located in Worcester, Massachusetts. He began his duties as librarian in April 1838, and in October of that same year, he was elected a member of the society. Haven became one of the society's longest serving librarians from 1838-1881, and also served on its board of councilors from 1855-1881. Haven was particularly interested in research of the indigenous people of North America, including those referred to as the Mound Builders. The Smithsonian Institution commissioned Haven to write a consolidation of then current archeological knowledge. The Institution published Haven's Archaeology of the United States in 1855. It was his only book. The result of his travels and studies, it proposed an ancient origin of the native peoples of the Americas and of their migration from Siberia."

Paltrow's journalism career began in 1977 when he joined the Memphis Commercial Appeal as a reporter. The following year, he joined the Los Angeles Herald-Examiner, where his investigative series on corruption in Industry, California, \"The City of Insiders,\" resulted in federal and state criminal probes and several convictions. In 1981, Paltrow moved to the Washington Star, where he covered federal courts. After the Star shut down the same year, Paltrow moved to the Wall Street Journal, where he was a reporter in the Los Angeles bureau. In 1985, Paltrow became a European correspondent for the Journal based in Brussels. In April 1988, Paltrow returned to the United States as New York financial bureau chief for the Los Angeles Times. During this period he did numerous investigative stories on Wall Street investment banks, markets and the insurance industry.\" While at the Times, Paltrow won a 1993 George Polk Award for Financial Reporting. Paltrow returned to the Wall Street Journal in May 1997 and served as senior special writer based in New York and writes for the paper's Washington bureau. In 2007, following Rupert Murdoch's purchase of Dow Jones & Company (which owns the Wall Street Journal), Paltrow left the paper and joined Condé Nast's Portfolio.com as a contributing editor, starting September 1, 2007, following another longtime Journal journalist who moved to Portfolio.com, Peter Waldman. In September 2010, Paltrow moved to Reuters, where he and fellow financial journalist Mark Hosenball were brought on as \"key hires\" in an effort to expand Reuters' \"coverage of business, Wall Street and Washington.\" Paltrow joined Reuters to cover \"financial crimes, specifically covering criminal and civil investigations related to the financial crisis, as well as the effort to more closely regulate and police the financial world.\" In 2012, Paltrow won a Society of American Business Editors and Writers Best in Business Awards in the Explanatory/News Agency category for his investigation into banks' use of robo-signing. Paltrow has written a report, The Case for a Stronger Federal Role in Insurance Regulation: Weak State Regulation Highlights the Need for Federal Oversight of Health Premiums, for the Center for American Progress Action Fund. Paltrow has received a Gerald Loeb Award. Paltrow won 1992 and 1993 John Hancock Awards for Excellence in Business & Financial Journalism, the 1994 Los Angeles Times Editorial Award, the Unity Award in Media, and a 2001 Deadline Club Award from New York City Chapter of the Society of Professional Journalists."

  "text" : "Sys was born in Semarang, Central Java on 18 July 1956. In the late 1960s he established an underground radio station with his elder brother. In 1970 Sys joined Prambors FM in Jakarta as a DJ and broadcaster. In 1975 Sys was chosen as Indonesia's best DJ. In 1976 he and fellow Prambors employee Mochamad Noor came up with the idea for a teenage song-writing competition. For one song, \"Lilin-Lilin Kecil\" written by James F. Sundah, Sys felt as though he needed \"someone with the voice of an angel\". to sing \"Lilin-Lilin Kecil\", and in his opinion Chrisye fitted the role perfectly. Having heard Chrisye's voice on the indie album Guruh Gipsy (1976), Sys decided that he had exactly the voice required. After Jockie Soerjoprajogo and Imran Amir failed to convince the singer, Sys met him and showed Chrisye the lyrics; this led Chrisye to agree to sing the song. \"Lilin-Lilin Kecil\", despite coming in ninth place, went on to become the most commercial song of that year. Sys made his film debut with a minor role in Sjumandjaja's film Kabut Sutra Ungu, filmed in 1979. In 1980 he played in the film Seindah Rembulan (As Beautiful as the Moon); he was also instrumental in convincing Chrisye to join the cast. He continued working with Prambors and other radio stations throughout the 1980s, helping promote the comedy troupe Warkop and introduce tribute acts of Western bands. Sys went on the hajj to Mecca in 1989. Upon returning to Indonesia, he reportedly destroyed his collection of pornographic materials, condoms, and sex toys — which he had been collecting to open a museum — as he felt more devout towards Islam. By 1990 Sys had become vice president of Duta Media Citra Radio."

  "text" : "Sampson Hopkins (died 1622) was an English merchant and politician who sat in the House of Commons between 1614 and 1622. Hopkins was the son of Sir Richard Hopkins of Coventry. He was a draper of Coventry and a puritan. In 1605 he sheltered Princess Elizabeth (later Queen of Bohemia) at his house at Palace Yard in Earl Street, which was built on the courtyard plan. (The building was destroyed by bombing in 1940.) He was Mayor of Coventry in 1609. In 1614, he was elected Member of Parliament for Coventry. He was described as being \"always so cross and violent in the parliament against the King's affairs\" and this was attributed to the nature of the faction in Coventry which he represented. Nevertheless, Hopkins met the king several times and in 1621 the king granted the city a new charter regulating the election of council members. Hopkins was re-elected MP for Coventry in 1621. Hopkins died in 1622. Hopkins married as his second wife Jane Butts and was the father of Richard who was also MP for Coventry. His daughter Anne married Matthew Babington."

  "text" : "Steven Lee Rubenstein (June 10, 1962 – March 8, 2012) was an American anthropologist. He was reader in Latin American Anthropology at the University of Liverpool, and Director of Liverpool's Research Institute of Latin American Studies. Beginning in the 1980s, Rubenstein worked with the Shuar people of Ecuador, documenting and analyzing practices of healing, the circulation of shrunken heads, and the ways in which the Shuar reacted to colonization and increasing incorporation into Ecuadorian society. He frequently used life histories of individual Shuar people as a way to understand the political conditions facing the community. He was also known for his application of reflexive and autoethnographic methods when writing about experiences of intimacy and vulnerability in ethnographic fieldwork. In his last work, he used the psychological theory of Jacques Lacan to analyze the ways in which the Shuar use the hallucinogen Ayahuasca. Rubenstein was the author of Alejandro Tsakimp: A Shuar Healer in the Margins of History (2002), based on his life history interviews with a Shuar shaman, and co-editor with Kathleen S. Fine-Dare of Border Crossings: Transnational Americanist Anthropology (2009). He was also a Wikipedia editor and administrator, under the username Slrubenstein. Since registering his account in December 2001 he made more than 30,000 edits to articles about anthropology and related fields."

  "text" : "Selma Rubin (March 28, 1915 – March 9, 2012) was an American environmentalist and environmental activist. She was called a co-founder of Earth Day. Rubin was a member or adviser for more than forty organizations spanning more than 57 years. She was raised in Toledo, Ohio, and served in the United States Navy from 1943 to 1945 during World War II. She and her husband, Bill, moved to Santa Barbara, California, from Los Angeles in 1964, where she took a position as an accountant. Rubin had been involved in some activism prior to 1969. However, the turning point for her came during the 1969 Santa Barbara oil spill, which began on January 28, 1969 and became the largest environmental disaster in U.S. history at the time. The spill, which lasted for eleven days and polluted the Santa Barbara Channel with almost 100,000 barrels of crude oil, killed thousands of seabirds and other aquatic wildlife. She, along with thousands of other volunteers, responded to the spill, which galvanized her environmental activism. In 1970, she successfully led a voter campaign to preserve the Gaviota Coast of California from a proposal to build 1,535 condos in the area. She and another activist, Anna Laura Myers, collected more than 12,000 signatures for a ballot initiative, which easily defeated the proposal. Rubin spearheaded a compromise for the Gaviota Coast, which allowed for much of the area's preservation, as well as the construction of the El Capitán Canyon Resort and a campground. She Rubin co-founded the Community Environmental Council, one of the world's first environmental organizations, in 1974. She also co-founded the Environmental Defense Center in 1977. Selma Rubin died at her home in Santa Barbara, California, on March 9, 2012, aged 96."

He served with distinction in an administrative capacity in the British Army in Germany under the command of the Marquis of Granby during the Seven Years' War. He was employed in 1767 as a secretary by the The Marquess Townshend when the latter was appointed Lord Lieutenant of Ireland and continued in the same post for his succesoor, The Earl Harcourt. In 1774 he was appointed Secretary of the Post Office in Ireland and established an efficient mail coach system. In 1780 he was given the post of Gentleman Usher of the Black Rod in Ireland. He became wealthy and in 1774 built Blackrock House at Blackrock, a Dublin suburb, The house was one of the few 18th-century houses built with red brick and has some fine features such as a two-storey red brick porch, a large coach-house, stable yard and gate-lodge. The house is still standing, although currently divided into flats. In 1788 he was elected a member of the Dublin Society. He was a Protestant conservative and an ally of Speaker Foster’s in demanding severe punishments during the 1798 rebellion. In June 1804 he was created a Baronet 'of Blackrock in the County of Dublin'. He died in 1811 and there is a mural tablet to his memory in Monkstown Church. He had married Mary, the daughter of Robert Cathcart and with her had six sons and a daughter. He was succeeded by his eldest son Harcourt, a well-known anti-catholic political pamphleteer. Another son Edward Smith succeeded him as Secretary of the Irish Post Office."

  "text" : "Simon Hammelburg (Amsterdam, February 28, 1952) is a Dutch entertainer, songwriter, author and journalist. During the seventies he started as a news broadcaster with AVRO Broadcasting (Radio & TV) in the Netherlands where he worked as an anchor and travelling journalist. In the early eighties he became the U.S. Bureau Chief for Dutch and Belgium radio and TV in New York  and for several newspapers and weeklies. Prior to the first Gulf War (1991) he produced the video ‘Shalom from Holland' with director Ralph Inbar and film maker Floris Sijbesma. The clip was performed by dozens of singers and musicians from all over the world like George Baker, Joe Bourne, Adèle Bloemendaal, Ruud Bos, Marco Borsato, Ted de Braak, Jaap Dekker, Lex Goudsmit, Donald Jones, Caroline Kaart, Ben Kramer, Lenny Kuhr, Thijs van Leer, Donna Lynton, Maggie MacNeal, Harry Sacksioni and Daniël Wayenberg as a token of solidarity to the Israeli people who were threatened by missiles fired from Iraq. Hammelburg co-wrote the song with Ron Klipstein. It was broadcast repeatedly on Dutch, Israeli and other international television networks during Gulf War I and was given a special award by the Knesset. Hammelburg co-authored various books, such as ‘My Judaism’ and wrote ‘Kaddisj voor Daisy’ (1996)  and ‘Broken on the inside – The War never ended’ (Aerial Media 2014), based on 1200 interviews with Holocaust survivors and their children, providing insights into the trauma’s of the first and post-war generations of Holocaust victims. The interviews were made during a campaign to help American Jews and other individuals file claims for property they lost during the nazi era in what was to become East Germany. Simon Hammelburg is a Holocaust educator giving lectures in Europe, the United States and Israel."

  "text" : "Sir Richard Young, 1st Baronet (c. 1580-1651) was an English courtier and politician who sat in the House of Commons between 1605 and 1624. Young was born to a Welsh family and educated at Lincoln's Inn, in London. Circa 1603 he became secretary to Edward la Zouche, 11th Baron Zouche, the recently appointed Council of Wales and the Marches. With the creation of the new parliamentary seat of Bewdley in Worcestershire, Zouche nominated Young for the seat, which he held from 1605 until 1610. As an MP, he was active in defence of his employer's activities, but Zouche losing office meant that he had no sponsor to re-enter parliament; he did not stand for re-election in 1614. Young remained working for Zouche until 1617, when he moved to work as an additional secretary for Francis Bacon, the Lord Keeper of the Great Seal. Bacon was a major figure in court politics, and Young benefited greatly; he was knighted in 1618, and received a number of profitable sinecures. The same year, he married Lady Martha Hayes, widow of Sir Thomas Hayes, a wealthy merchant and former Lord Mayor of London. In 1620, through the influence of Zouche (now the Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports), he was nominated and elected as the MP for Dover. He was a moderately active member, but was caught up in the scandal surrounding Bacon's impeachment for corruption in 1621; however, he gave damning evidence against Bacon and confessed to some minor crimes of his own, and was able to escape with his career intact and with increased royal favour; he was made a gentleman of the privy chamber later that year, and cemented King James's opinion of him by rescuing him from an icy river in January 1622. Young was again elected in 1624, again with Zouche's support, but the election was voided following a lawsuit by Sir Henry Mainwaring. Mainwaring had been the other member for Dover in the 1620 election, but had fallen out with Zouche, who insisted to his successor as Lord Warden that he not be nominated in 1624. After further legal manoeuvring, Young was re-elected without significant opposition. However, Zouche's departure meant that he no longer had a patron, and he did not stand for re-election in 1625. After standing down, he was created a baronet in 1628; bought (and quickly resold) a country estate at Shalden; and became a founding partner of the Guinea Company, which held a monopoly on the West African gold trade,</ref name=\"hop\"> and also traded for ivory and slaves. By 1635, he was wealthy enough to make a loan of £2,000 to the King. However, Young's final years were embroiled in a lawsuit with George Mynne, whose position as clerk of the Hanaper had been assigned to Young in 1634. The case stretched on into the early years of the Civil War, and while Young did retain the office, the majority of his assets were impounded or seized by the Parliamentarian Committee for the Advance of Money. By 1647 he still retained sufficient assets to pay a fine of £47, but in 1649 he was recorded as defaulting on a mortgage; in the following years he was committed to the Fleet Prison for debt, where he died intestate in 1651."

He worked with biochemist Dr. Evangelina Villegas for 35 years to develop a protein enriched form of maize in the 1970s. Quality Protein Maize (QPM) is created by adding protein to low nutrient corn and is prevalent in China, Mexico, parts of Central America, and Africa today and is referenced as \"miracle maize\" because of its role in alleviating malnourishment. In addition to improving the nutritional value of maize, its productivity was also increased. They were jointly awarded the World Food Prize in 2000 for their development of Quality Protein Maize at the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center in Mexico(CIMMYT). Vasal is an elected fellow of the National Academy of Agricultural Sciences."

  "text" : "Shirley Bottolfsen (born 12 February 1934) is an Irish woman who lives in Bodø, Norway. For over twenty years she has raised money to help the poor. Bottolfsen was born in Tipperary, the eldest of five children in a Catholic family, and immigrated to Bodø in 1956 with her first husband, a Norwegian sailor. He died at sea a few years later, leaving her with two young children. In 1983 she remarried to Per Bottolfsen, a dentist. Bottolfsen works with the Salvation Army and the municipality, but also as a one-person fundraising group. Her primary fundraising method is to stand for hours in the Glasshuset (glass house) covered section of the pedestrian precinct in central Bodø with a collection bucket; she also runs a summer lottery. As of 2005 she had raised 7 million kroner. She has been a benefactor to a children's home in Lithuania. She has raised several hundred thousand kroner for the poor and elderly in Porsanger; when honoured by the municipality in 2009, she donated the monetary award in the form of a 70-person coffee service and tablecloths. She delivers food to needy people's homes in Bodø six days a week, and gives Christmas gifts to the poor every year starting on 22 December. In 2004 she donated security alarms to elderly people in Bodø and then protested the municipality's requiring service fees from those people. In 2012 she raised money for some Roma families to return home to Romania, but felt misused when they returned to Oslo. For her volunteer and humanitarian work, she was awarded the King's Medal of Merit in silver in 2005. The same year, the Norwegian TV company TV 2 made a documentary about her called Julenissen kommer fra Irland (Santa comes from Ireland). In 2014, she received an international humanitarian prize from the Lions Club; the local Lions Club leader had sought the award for her for over twenty years. She was also awarded the Progress Party's John Ingolf Alvheim Prize in 2014. She features in the music video for the song \"Mirage\" by Heyerdahl. Bottolfsen has lived in the same house in Bodø since 1977. Her husband died in 2012; the following year, a group of volunteers repaired her house as a thankyou to her. However, since she was having a rental flat created without building permission, the municipality ordered all work to stop."

  "text" : "Baxter, Susan Harriet Sophia (9 December 1828 – 30 June 1865), also known as 白思德 in Chinese community, was a British missionary and educator in Hong Kong. Susan was the third child born to Joanna and Robert Baxter. A parliamentary solicitor of Westminster and a man of strong religious convictions, Robert's evangelical zeal made an impact on the first two bishops of Victoria (Hong Kong), George Smith and Charles Alford when they served in Doncaster in the 1840s and 1850s respectively. Influenced by her father, Susan became a missionary to China. Around 1860, Lydia Smith, the Bishop's wife who was a member of the Society for Promoting Female Education (FES), planned to set up a Diocesan Native Female Training School in Hong Kong and appealed for teachers to serve in. Susan responded the call and left for Hong Kong in April 1860. On arrival she learnt that the local ladies' committee had already appointed a teacher to the position she hoped to fill, so she set up several schools herself, which included: \n* an English school in Mosque Street for European children of soldiers and abandoned Eurasian orphans, \n* a Chinese girls' day school in Staunton Street, and \n* a girls' boarding school with day school for boys in her house on Bonham Road. In school she did more than teach: she clothed, fed and buried the dead, and regularly visited soldiers’ wives with Mrs Smith and offered help to the needy in Hong Kong and Canton. She was respected and beloved by both the Chinese and Europeans, according to Bishop Smith. In June 1865 Susan was struck down by fever and died within two weeks, at the age of 36. Her family continued to support girls’ education in Hong Kong through FES for another two decades. The schools she opened, known as Baxter Vernacular Schools, flourished until 1899 when the FES handed over its work to the Church Missionary Society, they were then renamed CMS Day Schools. Susan was never married. She was buried in Happy Valley, Hong Kong Island."

  "text" : "Soedjatmoko (born Soedjatmoko Mangoendiningrat; 10 January 1922 – 21 December 1989), familiarly called Bung Koko, was an Indonesian intellectual and diplomat. Born to a noble father and mother in Sawahlunto, West Sumatra, after finishing his primary education, he went to Batavia (modern day Jakarta) to study medicine; in the city's slums, he saw much poverty, which became an academic interest later in life. After being expelled from medical school by the Japanese in 1943 for his political activities, Soedjatmoko moved to Surakarta and practised medicine with his father. In 1947, after Indonesia proclaimed its independence, Soedjatmoko and two other youths were deployed to Lake Success, New York, to represent Indonesia at the United Nations (UN). They helped secure international recognition of the country's sovereignty. After his work at the UN, Soedjatmoko attempted to study at Harvard's Littauer Center for Public Administration (now the John F. Kennedy School of Government); however, he was forced to resign due to pressure from other work, including serving as Indonesia's first chargé d'affaires in London for three months as well as establishing the political desk at the Embassy of Indonesia in Washington, D.C. By 1952 he had returned to Indonesia, where he became involved in the socialist press and joined the Socialist Party of Indonesia. He was elected as a member of the Constitutional Assembly of Indonesia in 1955, serving until 1959; he married Ratmini Gandasubrata in 1958. However, as President Sukarno's government became more authoritarian Soedjatmoko began to criticise the government. To avoid censorship, he spent two years as a guest lecturer at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York, and another three in self-imposed unemployment in Indonesia. After Sukarno was replaced by Suharto, Soedjatmoko returned to public service. In 1966 he was sent as one of Indonesia's representatives at the UN, and in 1968 he became Indonesia's ambassador to the US; during this time he received several honorary doctoral degrees. He also advised foreign minister Adam Malik. After returning to Indonesia in 1971, Soedjatmoko held a position in several think tanks. After the Malari incident in January 1974, Soedjatmoko was held for interrogation for two and a half weeks and accused of masterminding the event. Although eventually released, he could not leave Indonesia for two and a half years. In 1978 Soedjatmoko received the Ramon Magsaysay Award for International Understanding, and in 1980 he was chosen as rector of the United Nations University in Tokyo. Two years after returning from Japan, Soedjatmoko died of cardiac arrest while teaching in Yogyakarta."

Sticky, from Ballymoney in County Antrim, was one of the first drivers to compete in Hot Rod racing in Northern Ireland. He moved into hot rod racing after a brief time in Superstox and initially campaigned mk1 and mk2 Ford Escorts and then switched to a Hillman Avenger (which he had previously rallied) before being the first driver to race a non-hybrid Talbot (nee Chrysler) Sunbeam in 1978. After racing the Talbot for a couple of seasons he built and raced a Toyota Starlet, although he bucked the trend in the class by sticking with Toyota power rather than making a hybrid ford powered version. In 1976 Sticky was one of the first drivers to represent Northern Ireland in the National and British Championship meetings at Hednesford and Arlington respectively. He also raced at Cowdenbeath in Scotland. His first racing number was 411 which adorned his mk1 Escort. In 1977 the Irish promoters decided to switch to race numbers with only two digits and he changed his competition number to 88. As well as having a change of number Sticky changed his racing livery from white and orange to a distinctive zebra striped one. In 1979 a national hot rod numbering system was introduced with Northern Ireland's drivers being allocated 900-999, Sticky taking 988."

In 1905, Latta moved to Saskatchewan, settling on a homestead near Govan. He founded the weekly Govan Prairie News in 1907 and was editor until 1929. Latta was a member of the council for the rural municipality of Lost Mountain Valley, also serving as secretary-treasurer. He ran unsuccessfully for a seat in the provincial assembly in 1908 and then was elected in 1912. Latta served in the provincial cabinet as Minister of Highways and Minister of Education.

Introduced in 1972, Mr. Coffee proved wildly popular with consumers and revolutionized the way Americans made and consumed coffee in their homes. By 1975, just three years after its introduction, Mr. Coffee was the top selling coffee maker in the United States. The industry trade publication Home Furnishings News listed Mr. Coffee as one of the most important household consumer products introduced in the previous seventy-five years in a list published in 2002."

  "text" : "Samuel Lake AM (1842–1887) was a general merchant, civil engineer, and pioneering designer and builder of steam trawlers, from Dartmouth, Devon in the United Kingdom. In his civil engineering work in the 1860s he constructed one of the first rows of terraced cottages to be built out of poured shuttered concrete, using what was then a revolutionary building material and technique. They were then known as Coombe Terrace, today numbers 12 to 21 Coombe Road, and were built for Lake himself and for his employees. Lake's trawler work was in conjunction with George Parker Bidder, also of Dartmouth, and proved to be a technical success, but not at that time to be commercially viable. Lake spent a substantial part of his life in India. In 1867 Lake of the Bombay Reclamation Company was awarded the Albert Medal for his bravery in helping rescue the crew and some 400 Muslim pilgrims from a shipwreck off Bombay. He returned to Dartmouth in 1866. Lake was contracted in 1879 to build Milford Haven and in 1881 Felixstowe Docks but went bankrupt. Lake Street in Dartmouth is named after him."

  "text" : "Steve Ince is a writer and game designer, best known for his work on Revolution Software titles such as the Broken Sword series, and is currently working on a freelance basis. Before entering the video game industry, Ince earned a degree in astronomy and astrophysics at the University of Newcastle-upon-Tyne. In 1993, Ince was employed by Revolution Software, where he worked on titles such as Beneath a Steel Sky, the Broken Sword series, In Cold Blood and Gold and Glory: The Road to El Dorado. He left the company in 2004, and set up a new website, Steve Ince Solutions, offering solutions for writing and design in the video game industry. Ince is also a creator of various comic strips and in 2004 a collection of one of his comic strips was published by BookSurge Publishing. In 2005 he launched Juniper Games, a label under which he would develop his own games, which was followed by the release of its first game, Mr. Smoozles Goes Nutso. He also announced a new company, InceSight, through which he offered his skills and experience to developers and publishers in need of assistance in the fields of writing and game design. Ince wrote down his ideas on game design in a series on Developing Thoughts, and in a book entitled Writing for Video Games. As writer, designer or script editor Ince has been working on a number of games, most notably Agatha Christie: And Then There Were None, The Witcher, So Blonde and The Whispered World. When Revolution started working on remakes of the first two Broken Sword games for newer platforms in 2009 and 2010, Ince became involved again. During this time he also worked on Spare Parts, The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings, and ScanMe, and on casual/hidden object games, such as Rhianna Ford and The Da Vinci Letter and two Special Enquiry Detail games. For Broken Sword: The Sleeping Dragon, Ince received a nomination for Excellence in Writing at the Game Developers Choice Awards 2004. In 2008 he received another nomination from the Writers' Guild of Great Britain in the category of Best Video Game Script for the game So Blonde. As of February 2012 Ince is represented by the SMART Talent agency."

He married Amy Alice Young in England in 1905. In 1909, they came to Canada, because it was felt that drier air in Canada would help Morrey's lung problems, and settled on a homestead south of Shackleton, Saskatchewan. In 1913, with a partner, Morrey opened a hardware store in Shackleton. He served five years as reeve for the Regional Municipality of Miry Creek. Morrey organized the telephone company in Shackleton, helped organize the local school and worked with the Grain Growers. He was reelected in 1921 but died in office later that year from complications associated with lung disease."

  "text" : "Sydney John Bunney (1877–1928) was an English late Impressionist artist who left over 500 drawings of early 20th-century Coventry. Little is known of Bunney's life. In 1892 he was a student at Coventry School of Art. He maintained contact with the school for many years, becoming the first Secretary to the school's sketch club in April 1907. He resigned from the post three years later but remained a member of the club until 1916. Bunney's work as an artist matured under the influence of William Milnes, who became the headmaster at Coventry School of Art in 1906. Milnes encouraged students to follow the example of Turner by taking quick sketches under differing conditions. This, according to Milnes, would give the artist a greater understanding of nature in its various moods. Many of Coventry's medieval buildings had survived up to the early 20th century, and Milnes pointed out that many of the buildings were suitable for studies on the effect of light. Several students took up this idea, including H. E. Cox, and Bunney became a prolific painter of Coventry scenes. His body of work records the city as a market town, the streets lined with red-brick and half-timbered shops and houses. Most of these pieces are small and intimate works of art. He had great difficulty in having his work exhibited at any of the big shows, such as those at the Royal Academy, and interest in his work largely waned before he was rediscovered in the late 20th century. Bunney became a cashier at the Auto Machinery Company Limited in Coventry and in his later years lived at 154 Albany Road, Earlsdon."

  "text" : "Simone Alves da Silva (born 12 September 1984) is a Brazilian long-distance runner. She won the 2011 South American title over 10,000 metres and broke South American records for the 5000 m and 10,000 m events in 2011, but was banned from competition for a doping offence that year. Born in Morro do Chapéu, she had a rapid ascent in distance running beginning at the age of 24 after joining the BM&F Bovespa athletics club and working with coach Adauto Domingues. She won the Guaratingueta 10K and set a half marathon best of 77:47 minutes at the São Paulo Half Marathon in 2009. She began 2010 with another half marathon best run of 75:43 minutes in São Paulo, coming second in the race, then a 10,000 metres personal best of 33:25.6 minutes to win the State championships. She was chosen to compete at the 2010 Ibero-American Championships in Athletics and she won the 5000 metres silver medal in a personal best of 15:49.79 minutes before running a 3000 metres best of 9:09.41 minutes for fourth in that contest. She failed a doping test at a 10-mile race in Brazil, being positive for the banned stimulant Oxilofrine, and was suspended from December 2010 to February 2011. She was retrospectively banned, but competed at the Saint Silvester Road Race in the meantime, taking second place behind Alice Timbilil. Upon her return da Silva won the women's title at the 2011 South American Cross Country Championships, leading Brazil to the team title. That May she broke the South American record for the 5000 m with a run of 15:18.85 minutes at a small meet in São Paulo. At the 2011 South American Championships in Athletics in Buenos Aires she came sixth in the 1500 metres then made a career breakthrough by winning the 10,000 m with a time of 31:59.11 minutes – the second fastest by a South American and a championship record. At the Troféu Brasil de Atletismo later that year she won a 5000/10,000 m national title double. Her 10,000 metres time of 31:16.56 minutes was a new South American record and over half a minute faster than Carmem de Oliveira's previous mark set in 1993. However, her doping sample at that competition came back positive for erythropoietin (EPO), a banned blood boosting substance. She was provisionally suspended from October 2011 onwards and Clube de Atletismo BM&F Bovespa cut ties with her. A Brazilian Disciplinary Committee acquitted her of the doping offence in January 2012, but the Brazilian Athletics Confederation lodged an appeal to instate a ban on da Silva. She remains banned from competition."

Kent is known for his large, expressive and abstract figures  in green wood. His large wooden sculptures are carved using a chainsaw with very little use of a chisel or sanding. He occasionally uses a blowtorch to char the wood and produce blackening, or sandblasting to emphasise texture and woodgrain. In the 1980s, clay was Kent's first choice sculpture material. By the 1990s, he had developed a passion for stone carving before beginning his obsession for carving wood with a chainsaw in 2000. Since 2004, Simon has exhibited his work across South Yorkshire and the Midlands  including an exhibition at Magna in 2005, and Burghley House Sculpture Park in 2006."

She acted in OL Supreme as Bak Mai which is her best known role, which was well received by audiences. She also acted many minor and supporting characters due to lack of Cantonese fluency. She briefly took a break from her education as she believed her career was progressing smoothly at the time of her popular character and wanted to save money upon realizing that it was not possible for her to buy a residence in Hong Kong within two years with her income. She is known for her good figure, which contributed to the popularity of her character. Upon reaching her thirties, the media praised her for keeping her figure well for so long. Later, she completed her degree to work with an airline company. Other work includes hosting Mandarin-language programs and part-time modelling and working as a manager for Cathay Pacific."

  "text" : "Sukumar Barman (1 January 1952, Kemtali – 10 March 2012, Agartala) was an Indian politician. He was a prominent leader of Scheduled Castes in Tripura. Barman hailed from an impoverished fishing family in Sonamura district. His family sent him to live with an uncle in order to attend school, and he first came into contact with activist politics through the student movement. He completed his higher secondary examination in 1971. He went on to join the peasants' movement. Barman became a member of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) in 1976. Between 1978 and 1983, he served as elected village pradhan of Kemtali. He would become a member of the Tripura State Committee of the party. He also became the general secretary of the Tripura Scheduled Caste Coordination Committee. From 1988 onwards he was a member of the Tripura Legislative Assembly, representing the Nalchar constituency. During the Indian National Congress/Tripura Upajati Juba Samiti government 1988–1993, Barman was the target of several assassination attempts. When the Left Front was elected back into office in Tripura 1993, Barman was named Minister of State. Between 1998 and 2004 he served as the Tripura state government Minister of Transport and Fisheries.  He lost his cabinet position in the downsizing of the government that came out of The Constitution (91st Amendment) Act 2003. Barman served as the chairman of the state owned land development bank and Tripura Road Transport Corporation. He was also a well known swimmer. Barman died in March 2012 at G.B. Pant hospital in Agartala, where he had been admitted following a brain haemorrhage. The state government declared a two-day mourning period, during which the national flag was flown at half mast. His body was cremated in Kemtali."

A Church of Ireland landowner, his family had originally migrated to Ireland from Congleton in Cheshire. Although not from a Roman Catholic Irish background, Parnell is renowned in Irish history for his efforts to bring about a more emancipated country and was the great-grandfather of Charles Stewart Parnell, leader of the Irish Home Rule campaign. Parnell first served in the Parliament of Ireland as one of the members for Bangor, from 1767 to 1768. He later sat for Queen's County from 1783 until the Union with Great Britain created the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland in 1801. After the Union, he gained a seat in the Parliament of the United Kingdom for a short time as member for Queen's County, but died in December of the same year. From a line of politically astute ancestors who had moved to Ireland in the 17th century, Parnell rose to the highest positions in Irish politics as Commissioner of the Revenue (1780), Chancellor of the Exchequer (1787), and Lord of the Treasury (1793). He died suddenly in London in 1801."

Pamphilon had access to the Saints locker room while collaborating with former Saints player Steve Gleason on a documentary. Gleason said he and his family retain the rights to the recordings, and Pamphilon released them without permission. Pamphilon said he would not have released the recordings if the story regarding the bounties was not already public. He denied that their contract prohibited posting of the footage and said that he and Gleason had agreed to a third-party mediator, who advised publicly releasing the recordings. \"I feel as strongly today as I have from the beginning that the audio speaks for itself and that the public had a right to hear it,\" Pamphilon said."

Together with two other Singapore prominent cricketers, S Sivalingam (a former Singapore cricket captain) and M Neetianathan (Singapore Cricket Association vice-president), they were protégés and students of the late Victoria School teacher, S Soocelaraj, an avid cricketer himself. Muruthi had made significant contributions to cricket in Singapore. He holds the record for playing 45 consecutive years in the Singapore Cricket Association (SCA) league since 1968, at the age of 60. Muruthi first played for the Combined Schools, a Singapore Cricket Association Division 2 team in 1968. Two years later, he was playing for the national team, becoming one of the youngest national cricket player while still a student at Victoria School at the age of 17. He was on the national team until 2001, and was the national captain in 1976, 1979–1989 and 1994. His sons, Peter and James, are also Singapore cricket internationals. Muruthi's best performance was on 21 February 1973, when playing for a Singapore Selection, he took 4-55 against the Pakistan Test side in a friendly at the Padang. One of the players on the Pakistan Test side was the Pakistan national captain, Majid Khan. Zaheer Abbas, regarded as one of the finest batsman produced by Pakistan, had commented that \"Muruthi, once he masters the art of varying his flight and speed can find a place in any country side.\" In the 1994 ICC Trophy tournament, Muruthi was Singapore's best batsman. Muruthi is a vice-president with logistics company, Pan Projects."

  "text" : "Stephanus Andries Johannes Swart (1890 - 6 May 1927) was a South African farmer and spree killer who killed at least 8 people and wounded 3 others in Charlestown, South Africa on 6 May 1927, before killing himself. Police pursued Swart one day after he fired a shot at his neighbour, Mr Lourens, on 3 May 1927 for no apparent reason. At some point Swart told another man to write down Swart's 28 page suicide statement after setting his own car on fire and hiking 10 miles to his farm house. Swart was confronted by a police constable in the early hours of 6 May at his home with a warrant for Swart to give himself up. Swart replied that he simply wanted an oak coffin and wanted it to be zinc-lined, and he would shoot anyone who came through the road running near his property after 6:00 pm. The alarmed constable immediately started to gather a posse of a dozen policemen to arrest Swart the next day. Swart killed five officers and wounded another near his farm, taking one's revolver and horse. He went to a nearby house to tell his neighbour that he intended to go into Charlestown to kill three more people before going to Volkrust to kill himself. The neighbour departed to warn police of Swart's coming. His neighbour, Swanepoel, when nearing Mount Prospect, was approached by a black person with a note from Swart saying he would return to kill him after he completed his \"mission\". By now Swart had killed two more people on the road, who had testified against him in a previous crime (incest) for which he had been convicted and sentenced to several months in prison. Swart arrived in Charlestown across from the train station at a house where his estranged wife was living. Swart gunned down his wife, then rode his stolen horse to the edge of town and fired at a passing automobile, wounding the driver and a passenger. At this point police all over the district had been notified and had formed a posse of local farmers along with police to hunt him down. Swart was spotted diving into a ditch after an officer fired at him. A final shot was heard, as Swart killed himself with the stolen Webley Revolver."

  "text" : "Silas Sanford Smith, Jr. (October 26, 1830 – October 11, 1910) was a Mormon pioneer, a politician in the Utah Territory, and the leader of the San Juan Expedition that settled San Juan County, Utah. Smith was born in Stockholm, New York. His father, Silas Sr., was a younger brother of Joseph Smith, Sr., which made Silas Jr. and Joseph Smith, Jr. first cousins. Silas Sr. was baptized into Smith's Church of the Latter Day Saints in 1835 and the family became followers of Smith. After Silas Sr.'s baptism, the family moved to Kirtland, Ohio. A few years later they joined the Mormon settlers in Missouri and in 1839 they were driven out and settled in Nauvoo, Illinois. In 1847, after Joseph Smith was killed, the family left Nauvoo and crossed the American plains as Mormon pioneers, settling in the Salt Lake Valley. In Utah Territory, Silas Jr. lived first in Salt Lake City and then in Farmington. In 1851, he married Clarinda Ricks, with whom he would have four children. Shortly after their marriage, Brigham Young asked the couple to settle in Parowan. Smith practiced plural marriage and in 1853 married Sarah Ann Ricks, his first wife's sister. Smith and Sarah Ricks would have five children. In 1854 to 1856, Smith was a missionary for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) in Hawaii, where he learned to speak the Hawaiian language. After he returned from Hawaii, Smith and his wives and children moved to Paragonah, Utah. Smith was a military leader in the Black Hawk War. In 1859, Smith was elected as a representative in the Utah Territorial Legislature, where he served until 1878. Smith was also a deputy U.S. Marshall, a probate judge, and a bishop of the LDS Church in Paragonah. After the death of both of his wives within months of each other, Smith married Martha Eliza Bennet in 1864. Smith and Bennet would have 12 children together. In 1879, Smith was asked by the LDS Church to become the president of the San Juan Mission of the church in southern Utah. In this capacity, he was asked to locate a suitable spot for a Mormon settlement on the San Juan River. Smith led the San Juan Expedition via the Hole in the Rock Trail, establishing the settlement of Bluff. Smith remained president of the San Juan Mission until 1882. In April 1880, Smith became a member of the LDS Church's Council of Fifty. After his term as president of the San Juan Mission, the LDS Church asked Smith to move to Colorado. From 1883 to 1892, he was the president of the San Luis Stake in Conejos, Colorado. He lived in Colorado until 1900, when he moved to Layton, Utah. Smith died in Layton of heart troubles. Smith was the father of a total of 21 children with three wives."

They fought against the Argentine Army during the Conquest of the Desert. In 1897, Salpul and a shaman named Cayupil (Caypül) tried to organize an uprising against the government. Their activities were quickly discovered by the authorities. Salpul was arrested and taken to Buenos Aires, but he was released within a month and returned home. Afterward he allied his people with the tribe of his relative Juan Sacamata. Between the 1890s and 1900, both lived in Nueva Lubecka, located in the Genoa Valley, Chubut province. Salpul died some years later in Pastos Blancos, near the Senguerr river."

He succeeded his father as chief of the Habibzai section of the tribe, but due to his \"bravery and ability\" he was selected by the Abdalis (later known as Durrani), then living between Kandahar and Herat, to be their overall leader in 1598. Shadi Khan, the governor of the Emperor Akbar at Kandahar, was hostile to Sado Khan, so he went over to the interests of Abbas I of Persia, who had lost Kandahar in 1594 and was intriguing for its recovery. This he effected in 1621, after Akbar’s death. Sado Khan died in 1626 leaving five sons, from whom have descended several well-known clans of the Durrani tribe. The descendants of Sado Khan are known as Sadozai, and one branch of the family, to which Ahmad Shah Durrani, Timur Shah, Zaman Shah, Hassan Javaid Khan and Shuja Shah Durrani belonged, reigned for many years in Kabul."

  "text" : "Sylvester Henry Scovel was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, on July 29, 1869. Scovel was the third of five children of Caroline Woodruff and Dr. Sylvester Fithian Scovel, a Presbyterian minister who served as President of the University of Wooster (now College of Wooster), in Wooster, Ohio, from 1883 to 1899. At about the age 16, Scovel indicated to his parents his lack of interest in religious training and his intention to seek work as an engineer. However, later Scovel returned to Wooster University. Afterwards Henry Scovel attended the Michigan Military Academy, graduating in 1877 and enrolling at the University of Michigan in the fall. Halfway through his sophomore year, despite his excelling on the athletic field and performing well in the classroom, Scovel, restless, dropped out. From time to time he would send articles on conditions there to Cleveland newspapers. He also provided occasional articles about the club’s activities to the Pittsburgh Dispatch. His imagination and sympathies stirred by the revolution taking place in Cuba, he headed to New York, where he made arrangements to work as a foreign correspondent for the Herald, a paper well-regarded for its reporting of international news. An editor promised Scovel $24 per dispatch for the information he could smuggle out about the Spanish–Cuban conflict."

His works were in the style of Michelangelo, though he was trained by Andrea Ferrucci in Florence. Ferrucci obtained for him his first independent commission was in 1522, and included the decoration of the tomb of Raffaelle Maffei in San Lino at Volterra. He usually worked in collaboration with other artists, including his brother Cosini (born circa 1505). In 1524 Ferrucci was commissioned to execute a relief of the Madonna and child for the monument to Antonio Strozzi in Santa Maria Novella in Florence. Also in this period Cosini executed the monument to Ruggero Minerbetti for the same church. Michelangelo employed him between 1524 and 1528 to execute decorative grotteschi decoration and masks, including trophies, for the Medici Chapel, San Lorenzo. The Francesco Boni citation states that he was active in Genoa and in the Duomo of Milan, and that he died in the latter town at the age of 47 years. It also states he was an excellent poet, musician, and fencer."

  "text" : "Sir Henry Middleton (died 1613) was a sea captain and adventurer. He negotiated with the sultan of Ternate and the sultan of Tidore, competed against Dutch and Portuguese interests in the East Indies but still managed to buy cloves. He was taken on at the Woolwich ship yards working first on the East India Company's Red Dragon. The company was organising its first expedition to \"East India\". The prominent Elizabethan trader and privateer, James Lancaster was to command the four ships. Second in command was Middleton's brother John, a company captain who secured Henry as a mercantile agent with a berth on the voyage. They set off in April 1601 arriving in Aceh, Sumatra in June 1602. Middleton was sent onwards to Priaman on the west coast where he procured substantial quantities of pepper and cloves before returning home safely in the summer of 1603. In 1604 Middleton commanded a second voyage heading for the islands of Ternate, Tidore, Ambon and Banda in the Moluccas with his brother David Middleton as second captain. They would encounter severe Dutch East India Company hostility, which saw the beginning of Anglo-Dutch competition for access to spices."

He succeeded to the baronetcy on the death of his father on 23 September 1658. He was Sheriff of Cambridgeshire and Huntingdonshire from 1662 to 1663. His loyalty to the Crown does not seem to have been trusted. He was one of the first to welcome back Charles II, and even before the Restoration made a special visit to the Netherlands to assure the King of his support, but is said to have returned \"empty-handed\". Little more is heard of Hatton until 1674, when he was elected Member of Parliament for Cambridgeshire in the Cavalier Parliament. He entered Parliament at a time of acute political conflict, when a formal Opposition was emerging, arguably for the first time. Hatton, with his dubious reputation for loyalty to the Crown, achieved little distinction as an MP: he was described as being \"equally vile\" in the eyes of the Court and the Opposition. Hatton died in 1682 and was buried at Long Stanton on 19 April 1682. Hatton married before 1660, Bridget Goring, daughter of Sir William Goring, 1st Baronet of Burton and his wife Eleanor Prakois, daughter of Sir Edward Prakois. They had two sons, Christopher and Thomas, each of whom briefly succeeded to the title. Both died young and the title reverted to their uncle, Sir Christopher Hatton, 5th Baronet. They also had four daughters: Mary, Elizabeth, Rebecca and Dorothy. Mary, the eldest, married John Pocklington of Huntingdonshire, Baron of the Court of Exchequer (Ireland). Their descendants, the Pocklington-Domvile family, were substantial landowners in County Dublin, Ireland."

He was a former politician and Confederate general; together they became influential in New York society, among numerous \"Confederate carpetbaggers\" after the war. Mrs. Pryor was among founders of a home for women and children in Brooklyn, New York. She helped found heritage organizations including Preservation of the Virginia Antiquities, the Daughters of the American Revolution, the Mary Washington Memorial Association, and the National Society of the Colonial Dames of America. She was active in fundraising to support their goals. Mrs. Pryor published two histories, two memoirs of the Civil War years, and novels by the Macmillan Company in the early 1900s. Her first memoir was recommended by the United Daughters of the Confederacy, which encouraged southern women writers to defend the southern cause. Her memoirs have been sources for historians on the life of her society during and after the war years."

She was born 11 February 1916 in Przygłów near Piotrków Trybunalski, then in Central Powers' occupied part of the Kingdom of Poland. She graduated from the Free Polish University and went on to study at the Polish language and literature faculties of the Jagiellonian University of Cracow and the Łódź University. Between 1942 and 1945 she was an inmate of the infamous Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp. As a Holocaust survivor, she was one of very few Poles to testify at the Nuremberg Trials. After the war she went on to be a successful writer. Initially focusing on her war-time experiences (\"Dymy nad Birkenau\", \"Łączy nas gniew\", \"Niewinni w Norymberdze\"), with time she also started publishing novels for teenagers. Her best-known novel \"Czarne Stopy\" (published in 1960) was later turned into a successful 1986 film by Waldemar Podgórski. She died 7 July 1992 in Warsaw."

He was Sheriff of Lincolnshire from 1632 to 1633 and was created baronet of Marston on 24 August 1642. In the Civil War, he fought for the King and suffered greatly as a result. His estate was sequestrated on 15 March 1643 and he was fined £4,160, on 1 December 1646. In 1661, Thorold was elected Member of Parliament for Grantham in the Cavalier Parliament. Thorold married Anne Blythe, daughter of John Blythe, of Stroxton, near Grantham, Lincolnshire. Thorold died at the age of 86 in 1678. His two eldest sons, William and Anthony, predeceased him; Anthony's son William (died 1685) succeeded as second baronet, followed by his brothers Anthony (died 1685) and John (1664–1717) as third and fourth baronets respectively. John died without children and was succeeded as fifth baronet by William (died c. 1720), son of Thorold's third son John (died 1700)."

Born in Jakarta, Aristo became interested in films from a young age, though he did not consider a career in the industry until after graduating from university. At the suggestion of a friend, he wrote his first screenplay, Tak Pernah Kembali Sama. With feedback on the script from director Rudy Soedjarwo and after a period reading old, successful scripts, Aristo – at the time a film reviewer for a magazine – was able to befriend Hanung Bramantyo, who asked him to write a script about brownies. The resulting film, a critical success, led to Aristo receiving numerous requests for screenplays, including several adaptations of novels. In 2010, he released his directorial debut, Jakarta Maghrib. Aristo, who is married to fellow screenwriter Ginatri S. Noer, is influenced by several Western and Indonesian screenwriters, including Woody Allen, Robert Altman, Richard Linklater, Richard Curtis, Arifin C. Noer, and Asrul Sani. He has been nominated for three Citra Awards for screenwriting, although he has yet to win."

  "text" : "Syed Talha Ahsan is a British poet and translator. He is winner of the Platinum and Bronze Koestler Awards 2012 for his poetry. He was arrested at his family home in London, UK on 19 July 2006 in response to a request from the USA under the US-UK Extradition Act 2003, and detained without trial or charge over 6 years before his extradition to the United States on 5 October 2012. He was accused of associations with an allegedly terrorism-related Islamic news media website and London-based publishing house from 1997-2004 about Bosnia, the Chechen Independence War and Afghanistan Islamic Emirate government. On 10 December 2013, in U.S. District Court in New Haven, Connecticut he entered into a plea-bargain with the US Government prosecutor to charges of conspiracy to provide and providing material support for militants in Chechnya & Afghanistan. All other charges were dismissed. The length of Talha's detention without trial or charge is among the longest in British legal history. He is also the translator of a tenth-century Arabic poem, Above the Dust, by Syrian Abu Firas Al-Hamdani, on his captivity in Byzantium. The Talha Ahsan extradition case raised controversy due to comparison with the treatment of Gary McKinnon, whose extradition - which was expected to be 10 days after Ahsan's - was stalled after a medical diagnosis of Asperger syndrome and associative risks, similar to a diagnosis given to Ahsan. This has led to accusations from mainstream UK media, Human Rights NGOs as well as religious groups of a racist double standard within Conservative Home Secretary Theresa May's application of the law. After being detained without trial for six years, with appeals to the European Court of Human Rights, the House of Lords and the UK High Court, Ahsan was extradited from the UK to the USA on 5 October 2012, where he initially pleaded not guilty to all charges against him at a federal district court hearing in New Haven, Connecticut. He was held while awaiting trial in solitary confinement at the Northern Correctional Institution, a Supermax state prison in Somers, Connecticut, United States. His US trial proceedings began in October 2013. On 10 December 2013, he changed his plea to guilty to the charge of providing material support to terrorists. An international campaign led by Talha's brother Hamja Ahsan was formed to halt his extradition to the USA and have him tried in the UK - on the basis that this is where he was present during the period of the allegation. This was supported by a wide coalition of figures including Noam Chomsky, Robert Hillary King (Angola Three), A.L. Kennedy, Stop the War, Bruce Kent, Plaid Cymru, his MP and Labour cabinet member Sadiq Khan, Caroline Lucas MP, Gerry Conlon, Muslim Council of Britain, actor Riz Ahmed and former extradited Britons David Bermingham and Gary Mulgrew of the Natwest 3. The family-run campaign continues around issues of solitary confinement and reforming extradition law, with the aim of repatriating Talha to the UK. The campaign also curates events around prison literature, especially poetry. The Free Talha Ahsan family campaign was short-listed for a Liberty (pressure group) Human Rights Award 2013, described as \"creative and innovative campaign\" and in its use of art, poetry, film and music to bring the issue of summary extradition to wider public and political attention described as \"inspiring\"."

In 1897, Sergei Taneyev used the remaining movements as source for the Andante and Finale for piano and orchestra, which was published as Tchaikovsky's Op. posth. 79. Between 1951 and 1955, Bogatyrev reconstructed the original Symphony in E-flat as he believed Tchaikovsky might have done had he not become disillusioned with it, and published it as the \"Symphony No. 7 in E-flat\". It was first performed in Moscow in 1957. He also wrote a number of his own compositions."

Parades are of ongoing interest for Campbell, who depicts this familiar setting with its customary details and characters including clowns, policemen, balloons and crowds. This concern began while he was a student, where he made paintings of half-time parades at university sporting events. Over the past few years, his parades have expanded into more general, less specific landscapes that could be of any American town or city. The works depict various aspects of a single parade, from isolated details to full views."

Her Jewish-sounding maiden name has been subject to much speculation. Stefanie was born into a family of high social status. Hitler fell in love with her after she passed by him during her daily daughter-mother stroll in Linz, glancing at him. Although madly in love with her to the point of suicide, Hitler never once spoke with her, and she later married an Austrian army officer. August Kubizek, a close childhood friend and later biographer of his childhood experience with Hitler, wrote about Hitler's passion for her in his book, Adolf Hitler, My Childhood Friend. Stefanie stated in interviews that she was unaware of Hitler's feelings towards her, and little is known about her life."

As he could not speak the language he could not converse with the locals, Spottee was thought by some to be a poor lunatic, and is so referred to in The Bishoprick Garland by (Sir) Cuthbert Sharp. He earned his name from the spotted shirt he wore. He set up his home in a cave, which eventually bore his name, becoming Spottee’s Cave He earned his living by begging and doing odd jobs for local farmers. Rumour has it that he eventually died in the cave and his ghost has been spotted on stormy nights warning ships to stay away from the rocks, or alternatively that he (and now his ghost) lured ships onto the rocks and that his cave was a place of evil. It is thought that spotty died deep within the bowels of his cave and still remains there. The cave still retains the name of Spottee’s Cave over two hundred years after he was considered by locals as the “boggle bo” of the children of Sunderland and Whitburn. The story of Spottee appears in The Bishoprick Garland by (Sir) Cuthbert Sharp."

  "text" : "Sarah Bradlee Fulton (December 14, 1740, Dorchester - 1835, Medford) was an active participant of the Revolutionary War on the American side. A tablet stone was dedicated to her memory at the Salem Street Burying Ground in Medford, Massachusetts in 1900. She was born in 1740 as Sarah Bradlee in Dorchester, married John Fulton in 1762 and moved to Medford. She was an active member of Daughters of Liberty and is sometimes referred to as the “Mother of the Boston Tea Party”. She was involved with the Revolutionary War on several occasions. In June 1775, after the Battle of Bunker Hill, she organized women to nurse wounded soldiers. In March 1776, she volunteered to dispatch an important message from John Brooks, the mayor of Medford, to George Washington to the Charleston war front. She managed to cross the enemy lines and return home safe. Still later, during the Siege of Boston, she and her husband used their own ship to provide the American troops in Medford with wood and fuel. A play Sarah Bradlee Fulton, Patriot: A Colonial Drama in Three Acts was written about her by Grace Jewett Austin in 1919."

  "text" : "Simon Jones Murphy, Sr. (April 2, 1815 in Windsor, Maine – February 5, 1905 ) was an American businessman. Murphy was born in Windsor Maine April 2nd, 1815 and was a lumberman there, beginning as a logger on the Penobscot River and working his way up. In 1866, he moved to Michigan and worked in lumber there as well. Operating out of Detroit, his company logged thousands of acres of Michigan pine forests. Murphy was one of the first millionaires in Detroit. In 1887, Murphy began wintering in Whittier, California after purchasing the Ramirez Rancho. While there, he was an irrigator, citrus farmer, oilman, and real estate developer. He was founder of both the East Whittier Land and Water Company and the Murphy Oil Company, which drilled for oil in the Puente Hills. Murphy was an early benefactor of Whittier College. A hospital in Whittier bore his name, as does the neighborhood of Murphy Ranch, which was built on Murphy's citrus orchard. In 1905, Simon, Sr., 2 months after Died, completed the process of gaining control of the Pacific Lumber Company, which, under Murphy control and stewardship, would become a storied and one of the largest Coast Redwood lumber and milling operations to ever exist. At least five generations of Murphy's, including Simon's son Simon Murphy Jr, Grandson Albert Stanwood Murphy, Great Grandson Stanwood Albert Murphy, and then Great great Grandson Warren Murphy managed and controlled with main offices and the bulk of its massive log decks and milling operations in the historic company town of Scotia in Humboldt County, California through 1985. Murphy and his company built several buildings in the Detroit Financial District. These include the Marquette Building, the Murphy Power Building, and the first Penobscot Building A memorial commemorating Murphy exists in the second Penobscot Building."

  "text" : "Sir Cecil Bishopp, 4th Baronet (c. 1635 - 3 June 1705) was an English landowner and politician who sat in the House of Commons from 1662. He was the brother of Sir Thomas Bishopp, 3rd Baronet (1627–1652). Bishopp was the son of Sir Edward Bishopp, 2nd Baronet of Parham and his wife Mary Tufton, daughter of Nicholas Tufton, 1st Earl of Thanet and Lady Frances Cecil. Lady Frances Cecil was the daughter of Thomas Cecil, 1st Earl of Exeter and Dorothy Neville. Thomas Cecil, 1st Earl of Exeter was the son of William Cecil, Lord Burghley. Subsequent Bishopp baronets carried the name Cecil in recognition of this influential ancestor. He succeeded to the baronetcy on the death of his brother in 1652. In 1662, he was elected Member of Parliament for Bramber in a by-election to the Cavalier Parliament. Bishopp died at the age of about 70 and was buried at Parham on 6 June 1705. Bishopp married Sarah Bury, daughter and heiress of George Bury of Culham Manor, Oxfordshire at Culham Manor on 17 June 1666 and Anne Sprignell the daughter of Robert Sprignell of Highgate, Middlesex; His father Richard Sprignell was a respected citizen and barber surgeon of London, is mentioned more than once in Young's Annals of the Barber Surgeons' Company. He was a warden in 1584, 1587 and 1591 and was excused from serving as Master on 5 July 1599. She was also the sister of Sir Richard Sprignell, 1st Baronet connected by marriage with the regicide Sir Michael Livesey (a signatory of the King Charles I's death warrant). Sarah Bishopp (née Bury) inherited Culham Manor. The Burys retained possession of the manor until 1666 when by the marriage of George's daughter and heiress Sarah to Sir Cecil Bishopp, Culham Manor passed into the Bishopp family. The Bisshopps lived part of the time at Culham at least until Sarah Bury’s early death in 1680 (the initials CB for Cecil Bishopp are carved into the Manor’s very large dovecote). He was succeeded in the baronetcy by his son Cecil. He also had a daughter Christian Bishopp who married Sir Robert Fagge, 3rd Baronet."

  "text" : "Stav Shaffir (Hebrew: סתיו שפיר‎‎; born 17 May 1985) is the youngest female Knesset member in Israel's history, outspoken for demanding fiscal oversight of settlement funding and supporting a wide array of social justice-related issues—from affordable housing for young Israelis to the rights of Women of the Wall. Shaffir placed second in the 13 January 2015, primaries of the Labor Party and holds the third place in the internal Labor list (or alternatively the fourth place on the combined Labor–Hatnuah list). Shaffir was one of a small group of leaders of the 2011 Israeli social justice protests, Israel's biggest-ever protest, focusing on housing, public services, income inequality and democracy – and would eventually rise to become spokesperson of the movement. A video of Shaffir's 21 January 2015, Knesset speech went viral. In it, Shaffir sharply attacks Israel's right wing politicians, saying, \"Don't preach to us about Zionism, because real Zionism means dividing the budget equally among all the citizens of the country. Real Zionism is taking care of the weak. Real Zionism is solidarity, not only in battle but in everyday life.\""

  "text" : "Simon James and \"Hill\" (real name James Burrell) are multi award-winning UK radio presenters and voice-over artists. The pair began their careers in 1996 presenting the afternoon programme on Hallam FM in Sheffield, before moving to Liverpool to host shows on both Radio City and its sister station Magic 1548.In 1998, they moved to Radio Aire in Leeds to host drivetime. This programme was a concoction of sketches, surreal on-the-street interviews with members of the public and spoof competitions. It quickly increased its audience substantially and also became critically acclaimed, receiving the gold Sony Radio Academy award for Best Drivetime in 1999. A move to Manchester followed in 2002, where the duo presented the drivetime programme on the Northwest regional station Century FM (now Real Radio).There they received a second Sony Radio Academy award in 2002, this time for Best Daytime Music Programme.A year later, the pair joined Virgin Radio (now Absolute Radio) to present a late night show that developed a cult following and saw the birth of two of the duo's trademark features. Firstly, \"Around the World\" (in which contestants had to guess the length of a live conversation between the presenters and a foreign hotel receptionist) and the \"One-Sided phone calls\" which were a departure from the tried and tested telephone prank. Simon and Hill then had a spell presenting a Saturday afternoon sports show on the Capital Gold network, before joining the Local Radio Company in 2005 to host an independently produced evening show which was syndicated across the group's 27 stations nationwide. This programme had an alternative music focus, and featured regular sessions from both established and upcoming bands. The programme was one of the first in the country to feature Arctic Monkeys. It received a silver Sony Radio Academy award for Best Interactive Programme in 2006. In January 2008, the pair joined Kerrang! Radio in the West Midlands, initially to present drivetime. They took over the breakfast show in May of the same year and held this position until they left Kerrang! at the end of 2011. In that time they secured a further two Sony Radio Academy awards. Firstly, the silver for Music Radio Personalities Of The Year in 2009 (where they were beaten to gold only by Chris Evans), and most recently the bronze for Best Breakfast Show in 2011. During their time at Kerrang! Radio, Simon and Hill became best noted for blurring reality and theatre. Guests generally appeared remotely (apparently speaking from a mysterious \"booth\" in London), and often it was never clear which parts of an interview were genuine and which were the result of deliberately bizarre editing."

In 2009 Structure developed a reality television show entitled Party Hard about the culture of New York DJs, however the project was not picked up after the filming of the pilot. On October 16, 2010, Structure performed the entrance music for heavyweight fighter Shannon Briggs live as a part of his ringside team before his title fight with WBC Heavyweight Champion Vitali Klitschko, a performance viewed by over 20 million people. RTL news in Germany highlighted the performance before Brigg's entrance as \"Sports meets Entertainment\" in the run up to the event. Structure has also performed at several large scale events, including the 2012 Sundance Film Festival, the Chelsea Hotel, and various fashion shows. Earlier in his career Structure played a style of music he called \"Glam Hop\", which was a blend of Hip Hop, House music, and an eclectic collection of other genres. In 2012 Structure was involved in court case at the New York Supreme Court, when the former groom at a wedding at which he was supposed to perform sued his fiance over the deposit paid on his services. He is also active on social media, with over 60,000 Twitter followers."

  "text" : "Stephen Ferrughelli (March 12, 1949 – June 25, 2016) was a Canadian football player who was a fullback in the Canadian Football League. A graduate of prestigious Rutgers University, Ferrughelli had overcome difficult childhood handicaps (speech and hearing impairments) to earn his education and football scholarship. Ferrughelli would have a brief stint in the NFL with the New Orleans Saints and Washington Redskins before moving to the Canadian Football League. He joined Montreal in 1973 but made a huge impact the next season, rushing for 1124 yards, being named an all-star, and winning the Grey Cup. In 1975 he rushed for another 893 yards and was named Grey Cup Most Valuable Player in a one-point loss to the Edmonton Eskimos. Ferrughelli was caught in an import/Canadian ratio tangle in 1976, when Montreal needed a defensive back and were able to acquire a Canadian first stringer from Edmonton in exchange for him. He was traded to Edmonton, where he finished his career. He had played 43 regular season games for the Als (and 5 for the Esks) and had 2763 total rushing yards. Ferughelli later worked in the home-renovation business in Montreal's West Island. He subsequently moved to Rigaud, where he died on June 25, 2016."

  "text" : "Sir Simon Fitz-Richard (died c.1348 ) was an Irish barrister and judge. He became Chief Justice of the Irish Common Pleas, and fought a long and successful campaign against the efforts of his political enemies to remove him from office. He was probably a native of County Louth, where he later owned land. He was appointed Deputy Escheator of that county about 1315, and was given custody of the temporalities of the Archdiocese of Armagh in 1321. He appears as a Crown prosecutor in the 1320s and in 1326 he became the King's Serjeant. In 1331 he became an ordinary justice of the Court of Common Pleas (Ireland) and in 1335 he was appointed Chief Justice. He held lands in Louth and Ulster and at Gormanston, County Meath, and had a royal licence to export corn. During the 1330s complaints were made to the English Crown about the poor quality of the Irish administration, and in particular about the deficiencies of the Irish-born judges. In 1337 Thomas Charlton, Bishop of Hereford, was appointed Lord Chancellor of Ireland, with specific instructions to replace those Irish judges who were considered to be unfit for office with English replacements. Robert de Scardeburgh, Fitz-Richard's predecessor, was nominated to take his place again but did not actually come over to Ireland. Fitz-Richard went to England where he pleaded his case before the King: he was reappointed as Chief Justice and given various favours. He resigned in 1341; this was probably in connection with the various charges of maladministration which had been made against him. The following year he was accused of felony in England and arrested for trespass in Ireland, but nothing seems to have come of these charges. He went to England in 1348 on official business and was knighted in the same year; but he seems to have died shortly afterwards."

  "text" : "Sugiyama Waichi (1614–1694) was a Japanese acupuncturist, widely regarded as the \"Father of Japanese Acupuncture\". An eye-disease in infancy blinded Sugiyama from a very early age. At the age of ten he moved from Kyoto to Edo (Tokyo) to study massage and other therapeutic techniques under Ryomei Irie, one of the most famous medical practitioners of the era. His apprenticeship was short; Irie quickly dismissing him as \"dull\". On his way back to Kyoto, Sugiyama fasted and prayed for 100 days at the shrine of the goddess Benzaiten at Enoshima Cave, where he reputedly discovered the secret of the shinkan (\"insertion tube\") after pricking himself on a needle wrapped in a leaf. His development of the shinkan, combined with his use of extremely fine gold and silver needles, allowed for comparatively painless acupuncture, and resulted in considerable expansion of the art; for this reason he is often referred to as the \"father of Japanese acupuncture\". He started around forty-five schools teaching massage and acupuncture to other blind people, resulting in the prevalent association in Japan between blindness and physical therapy. After Sugiyama effected a cure for a neurotic disease afflicting shogun Tokugawa Tsunayoshi his work received official state endorsement, which greatly increased the popularity of his schools. Sugiyama's grave can be found in the graveyard of the Miroku-Temple in Tokyo (Sumida-ku). Sugiyama's teachings were recorded by his disciples and printed for the first time in 1880: Ryōji no taigaishū, Senshin no yōshū, and Igaku setsuyōshū."

  "text" : "Stanley Clark Meston (7 January 1910 — 30 December 1992) was an American architect most famous for designing the original McDonald's restaurants. In an article about the origin of McDonald's golden arches, architectural historian Alan Hess wrote: \"Nationwide success and proliferation have obscured the origins and creators of [the arches] in Southern California. Its architect, Stanley Clark Meston, has virtually never been credited with his contribution to American architecture.\" Born in Oxnard, California, in 1910, Meston attended Los Angeles Polytechnic High School, taking basic courses in drafting and architectural history. After graduation he apprenticed in architects' offices before becoming a licensed architect; while working in Earl Heitschmidt's office, Meston worked on the 1937 CBS building in Hollywood by Heitschmidt and William Lescaze. As did several more prominent Los Angeles architects during the Great Depression, he also worked for a time as a set designer, at Universal Pictures. Opening his own Fontana office, which ranged from two to eight employees, Meston's practice was primarily civic, including city office buildings, schools, and county facilities. Meston's experience during the 1930s had prepared him to design the building that was to become a major influence on the car-culture architecture of the 1950s. He had worked for Wayne McAllister, a Los Angeles restaurant and drive-in architect responsible for many of the trend-setting Streamline Moderne drive-ins of the decade, including Simon's, Herbert's, Robert's, and Van de Kamp's. \"Nothing in the East compares with the best things of this sort in Los Angeles,\" wrote Henry-Russell Hitchcock in 1940, praising in particular McAllister's Van de Kamp's design. Meston, having worked on several of these designs, was in an excellent position to reinterpret their car-oriented tradition for the generation and technology of the 1950s. When the McDonald brothers hired Meston, they offered him a choice of being paid a flat fee or a commission each time a new restaurant was built. He chose the fee. Meston's work has appeared in 28 of the world's countries and most of the world's principal cities, including Hong Kong, Tokyo, London, and Mexico City. In southern California and its vicinity, projects of his include the Verde Professional Building in Victorville, California; the San Bernardino County West End Courts Building; Wilbur Clark's Desert Inn in Las Vegas; and high schools in Visalia, Los Angeles, Gardena, Inglewood, Glendora, Palmdale, and several other southern California cities."

His younger brother Taiga is also a professional baseball player currently playing for Fukuoka SoftBank Hawks. His father Eiichi is a former professional baseball player. In October, 2015, Kasahara was named as a result of an investigation conducted by the Giants into illegal betting on professional and high school baseball games by its players. On 9 November 2015, the Giants organization terminated Kasahara's contract, along with fellow pitchers Satoshi Fukuda and Ryuya Matsumoto. The investigation found that Kasahara introduced the other two players to a graduate school student that facilitated the betting. On 10 November the NPB league commissioner penalized the three players with indefinite disqualification. Under league rules, Kasahara will be able to apply for readmission to the league after 5 years if he satisfies the commissioner that he is remorseful for his actions. The disqualification extends to American Major League Baseball and the professional leagues in China, Korea and Taiwan. The players avoided permanent disqualification because the investigation found no evidence that they were involved in fixing matches. The Giants were also fined ¥10 million over the incident and the team's representative at the NPB, Atsushi Harasawa, resigned to take responsibility."

  "text" : "Annie Gautrat, better known by her stage name Stone (born in Paris on 31 July 1947) is a French singer and actor, and very notably part of the musical duo Stone et Charden with her then-husband Éric Charden. the duo were famous in the 1970s with many hits in France and internationally. In 1966, Gautrat (Stone) was taking part in the \"Miss Beatnik\" competition where Éric Charden was a member of the jury. They were acquainted after the competition and got married the same year. Already having separate musical careers, they decided to form the duo known as Stone et Charden in 1971. They became hugely popular \"L'Avventura\" in 1972 and \"Made in Normandie\" in 1973. She also took part in the French musical comedy Mayflower written by Guy Bontempelli and music composed by Charden. Other actors included Pascale Rivault, Christine Delaroche, Patrick Topaloff, Gregory Ken, Roland Magdane, Roger Miremont and Mario d'Alba. Soon artistic, mediatic and family tensions resulted in a divorce and break-up of the duo in 1975 with each member pursuing a separate sole musical career. Éric Charden married Pascale Rivault, whereas Stone later married actor Mario d'Alba with whom she had 2 children, Martin and Daisy. In the early 1980s, she played in Le Plus beau métier du monde besides Charlotte Julian. The duo Stone et Charden reunited at the end of the 1990s taking part in some television shows and galas. A compilation of their songs was released in 1997. They also took part in the tour \"Âge tendre et Têtes de bois\" in France, Belgium and Switzerland. Besides singing, she pursued a career in acting in theater most notably in Les 3 Jeanne and Les monologues du vagin, the French-language adaptation of The Vagina Monologues. Both her and her previous husband Éric Charden of Stone et Charden days were decorated with the honorable Legion of Honour (in French Ordre national de la Légion d'honneur) on 1 January 2012 just months before the death of Éric Charden."

  "text" : "Savva (Savely) Vasilyevich Yamshchikov (Russian: Са́вва (Саве́лий) Васи́льевич Ямщико́в; October 8, 1938 – July 19, 2009) was a leading expert on Russian provincial art, particularly medieval icon painting and portrait painting of the 18th and 19th centuries. Yamschikov graduated from the Moscow University and worked at the All-Russian Art Restoration Center in Moscow. He went from one province to another in order to find medieval icons that required cleansing. Yamshchikov curated over 300 art exhibitions and first brought to light a number of provincial portraits from Yaroslavl, Rybinsk, Kostroma. It was he who rediscovered such forgotten artists as Grigory Ostrovsky, Dmitry Korenev, and Nikolay Mylnikov. He also advised Andrei Tarkovsky on the production of Andrei Rublev and Sergey Bondarchuk on the production of Boris Godunov. Yamshchikov spent much of his later life in Pskov, helping preserve medieval architecture of the region. He died in Pskov and was buried in Pushkinskie Gory."

He passed the imperial examination for xiucai when only thirteen years of age, and graduated as juren in 1600; but disgusted with the prospects of the Ming dynasty, clouded by the development of eunuch dominion, he devoted himself to a life of study and retirement. Often invited to take office by Emperors both of the Ming and Qing dynasties, he ever steadfastly declined; though in 1636 he did take part in the successful defence of Roncheng against Li Zicheng. He is one of the most famous masters of Confucian ethics, and his works on the Four Books etc. have been recommended to students by Zhang Zhidong. He also wrote on Ceremonial, and published the lives of eleven famous Confucians. He taught in a college near Suzhou during the last twenty-five years of his life, and in 1828 he was admitted into the Confucian Temple."

In 1713, he graduated as a jinshi in the imperial examination during the reign of the Kangxi Emperor and rose to the position of Libu Shilang for his frankness and uprightness. During the reign of the Qianlong Emperor, Sun rose to the position of Xingbu Shangshu by 1730, and later to Libu Shangshu in 1738.He was degraded for disrespect in taking up the Qianlong Emperor's pencil to write with. However, the emperor restored him to office. After holding various posts, in 1741 Sun became Viceroy of Huguang, where he introduced the system of subsidized chiefs, in order to keep the aborigines under control. In 1743, he was relieved from his position due to shielding his men, yet was recalled to be head of the Imperial Clan Court in 1744.In 1745 he retired, but resumed office and served as Gongbu Shangshu in 1750."

Yuting was a native of Jining in Shandong. His father was Sun Kuotu (孫擴圖). Yuting graduated as jinshi in the 1775 imperial examinations. Yuting became Viceroy of Nanjing, but in 1824 a breach in the Yellow River embankment caused his dismissal. For a time, he was Governor of Guangdong, where he put down the Shantou clan-fights and tried to stop the system of bribing pirates to submit. In 1802, as Governor of Guangxi, he induced the Court to recognise Fu Yang, the de facto king of Annam, and to allow the country to be again called Nanyue. In 1816, he advised the Jiaqing Emperor to dispense with the customary prostrations and kowtowing in the case of Lord Amherst's mission. At the same time, he assured his majesty that without tea, the English could not live, and that to prohibit its export from China would soon bring England to her knees. Yuting's grandson, Sun Yuwen (孫毓汶), was a grand councillor; he also served as President of the Zongli Yamen and President of the Board of War."

Coggins, in Hudson, Massachusetts. She started her professional career as a performer in vaudeville with her brothers, Mike and Charlie Coggins, as the Coggins Trio. In 1948, having changed her stage name, she appeared as one of the singers in a show at the Village Vanguard in New York. After being discovered singing at the Copacabana club, she became a vocalist with Vaughn Monroe's orchestra, singing on the Camel Caravan radio and television programs.

  "text" : "Sir Edward Bishopp, 2nd Baronet (1602 – April 1649) was an English politician who sat in the House of Commons in 1626 and in 1640. He supported the Royalist cause in the English Civil War. Bishopp was the son of Sir Thomas Bishopp, 1st Baronet of Parham Park, Sussex, and his second wife Jane Weston, daughter of Sir Richard Weston of Sutton Surrey. He matriculated at Trinity College, Oxford on 22 October 1619, aged 18 and was a student of the Inner Temple in 1620. He was knighted at Hampton Court on 18 December 1625 and succeeded to the baronetcy on the death of his father in 1626. In 1626, he was elected Member of Parliament for Steyning. He was Sheriff of Sussex in 1636. In April 1640, Bishopp was elected MP for Bramber in the Short Parliament. He was re-elected in the Long Parliament in November 1640 until his election was declared void in December. He supported the King in the civil war and was governor of Arundel Castle on behalf of the King in 1643. His estates were sequestrated and he compounded in October 1644. He was fined £7,500 in October 1645 which was later reduced to £4,790. In about 1626 Bishopp married Mary Tufton, daughter of Nicholas Tufton, 1st Earl of Thanet and Lady Frances Cecil. Lady Frances Cecil was the daughter of Thomas Cecil, 1st Earl of Exeter and Dorothy Neville. Thomas Cecil, 1st Earl of Exeter was the son of William Cecil, Lord Burghley. Subsequent Bishopp baronets carried the name Cecil in recognition of this influential ancestor. Bishopp died at the age of about 47 and was succeeded briefly in the baronetcy by his son Thomas, born 3 Dec 1627. However he died unmarried and without issue in 1652 and was succeeded by his brother Sir Cecil Bishopp, 4th Bt. b. c 1635, d. 3 Jun 1705."

A lawyer by training, Benjamin represented Ivor Bird, the brother of Prime Minister Lester Bird, following his arrest for the attempted smuggling of cocaine. He was then returned as the Member of Parliament for St John's City South, representing Bird's Labour Party, and was re-elected during the 1999 general election with 845 votes, defeating the United Progressive Party candidate Vaughn Walter. He was then sworn in, on 12 March, as Minister of Planning, Implementation and Public Service Affairs. Later that year he was transferred, becoming Minister of Labour, Home Affairs and Co-operatives. In 2001 his position was expanded with the stripping of internal security power from Errol Cort, the Attorney General of Antigua and Barbuda, and the granting of this portfolio to Benjamin. As Minister for Labour, Benjamin was responsible for introducing the Sir George Walter (Pension and Other Benefits) Act 2002, which sought to grant Sir George Walter, the second Premier of Antigua and Barbuda, and father of the aforementioned Vaughn Walter, a pension of 10,000 East Caribbean dollars a month, and announced that non-Antiguans who lived in Antigua for three years or more would not be required to obtain permits to work. Following the 2004 general election, Benjamin was one of only four Labour Party MPs to keep his seat, and was sworn into the new Parliament on 29 March 2004. Although initially supporting Robin Yearwood as Leader of the Opposition, Benjamin later withdrew his support, as did two other Labour MPs, Gaston Browne and Asot Michael; the group suggested Benjamin as a replacement leader. Benjamin was later appointed Leader of the Opposition, overseeing the removal of Lennox Weston from the Senate, and was later appointed Shadow Minister for justice, legal affairs, the Attorney-General's office and crime."

  "text" : "Stella Tanner (1 January 1925 – 26 March 2012) was an English radio and television actress. Tanner was born on 1 January 1925 and studied at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA). She left her focus on dramatic acting to form the Tanner Sisters with her sister, Frances Tanner. Together the Tanner Sisters made hundreds of appearances on British radio and television during the 1950s, even performing alongside Buddy Holly in March 1958. The Tanner Sisters often performed with the Hedley Ward Trio, appearing with them first on the Educating Archie radio show from 1950 to 1952. Tanner pursued a career in television comedy after she and Frances ended the Tanner Sisters act after ten years. Tanner made her television acting debut in 1960 on Sykes and A..., opposite Eric Sykes. She was cast in guest roles in numerous sitcoms, including an episode of The Rag Trade in 1963, Fawlty Towers in 1979, and It Ain't Half Hot Mum in 1981. From 1971 to 1972, she portrayed Adam Faith's girlfriend's mother in the ITV series, Budgie. Tanner was also cast as Luisa di Marco on the EastEnders throughout 1998, as well as a role on Coronation Street. Stella Tanner died on 26 March 2012 at the age of 87. She was survived by her daughter, Alexa. Tanner's husband, American actor, David Bauer, died in 1973."

  "text" : "Silvian Iosifescu (21 January 1917 - May 2006) was a literary critic, educator, translator and Romanian literature professor at the Faculty of Letters, University of Bucharest. He was head of literary theory at the university. Iosifescu was born into a family of Sephardic Jews. He joined the Romanian Communist Party while it was still underground. He worked for \"Cuvantul Liber\", an antifascist publication. He contributed in particular to critical editions of works by Ion Luca Caragiale and wrote about the creations of this classic Romanian writer (\"The Caragiale Dimension\", \"The Caragiale Moment\", 1963), and translated some of Caragiale's writings into French. Iosifescu wrote commentaries on the writings of Grigore Alexandrescu and Liviu Rebreanu, of some Romanian translations of Voltaire, George Bernard Shaw and others. He also translated prose anthologies of humoristic Romanian and French literature. During periods of relative liberalization in the cultural policy of the communist regime, Iosifescu abandoned socialist realism and published works of literary theory, such as \"Around the novel\" (1961), \"Border Literature\" (1969), \"Construction and Literature\" (1970), \"Configuration and resonance, a theoretical itinerary\" (1973) and \"Mobility of the view on narrative perspective in twentieth-century prose.\" Iosifescu dedicated special attention to literature at the border with philosophy and psychology (e.g. essays, aphorisms, moralizing, confessions), science (science fiction) and history (historical novel, memoirs, romanticized biography, travel notes, etc.). He translated French and English books by Robert Graves, Erskine Caldwell, Romain Rolland and others. He died at the age 89."

  "text" : "Sumi Haru (also known as Sumi Sevilla Haru; August 25, 1939 – October 16, 2014) was an American film and television actress, best known for such films and television shows as Krakatoa, East of Java, MASH, The Beverly Hillbillies and Hill Street Blues. She served as interim president of Screen Actors Guild in 1995, the first and to-date only woman of color to hold the position. Haru was born Mildred Sevilla in 1939 at Orange, New Jersey to Filipino immigrants. After changing her name to Sumi Haru when launching her acting career, she became involved with the film and television labor movement to address issues concerning the lack of opportunities and roles for Asians. Haru was a board member of the Screen Actors Guild (SAG) beginning in 1974, and also served multiple terms as the national recording secretary and first vice president. Haru was a co-founder of SAG's Ethnic Employment Opportunities Committee in 1971 and helped negotiate affirmative action clauses into contracts. In 1995, Haru became a national vice president of the AFL-CIO. Her six-year term as a national vice president marked the first time an Asian American has served on the AFL-CIO's executive council. She was president and co-founder of the Association of Asian Pacific American Artists, executive board member of the Asian Pacific American Labor Alliance and co-chair of the Rainbow Coalition Commission on Fairness in the Media. In 2009, Haru was honored with SAG's Ralph Morgan Award for distinguished service to SAG's Hollywood Division. Her autobiography, Iron Lotus: Memoirs of Sumi Sevilla Haru (CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform, October 9, 2012; ISBN 978-1479331536), was published in 2012. The following year, she was elected for a two-year term as a member of the first elected national board of the merged SAG-AFTRA."

Kimball was the oldest son of Spencer W. Kimball and his wife Camilla Eyring Kimball. He was born in Thatcher, Arizona and raised in Safford, Arizona. He received his undergraduate degree from the University of Arizona and then served in the United States navy on the Admiral's staff as a Japanese interpreter during World War II. He received his law degree from the University of Utah. He was later a Rhodes Scholar studying at Lincoln College, Oxford. He received his SJD from the University of Wisconsin-Madison. He later served on the law faculty there and was the youngest dean of law in the history of the University of Utah. He was also on the faculty of the University of Michigan Law School and the University of Chicago. At the University of Chicago he was the Seymour Logan Professor of Law. Kimball helped to established an American Civil Liberties Union chapter in Utah. Although he was widely associated with the LDS Church because of his father's prominent leadership positions, Kimball ceased his activity with the church while in his thirties and remained irreligious for the rest of his life. Kimball never desired to formally leave the LDS church, and took pride in his Mormon pioneer heritage and his father's position as church president, but gradually stopped believing in the divine claims of the LDS church and all other religions."

  "text" : "Stevens Thompson Norvell (February 14, 1835 – August 20, 1911, Ogunquit, Maine) was the son of U.S. Senator John Norvell of Michigan and his third wife, Isabella Hodgkiss Freeman Norvell. He was named after his father's friend and political ally, Stevens T. Mason, the so-called \"Boy Governor of Michigan.\" He was the grandson of Lt. Lipscomb Norvell, a Revolutionary War officer and an original member of the Society of the Cincinnati, buried in the Nashville City Cemetery, Nashville, Tennessee. Like many of his brothers he followed a career in the Military. Five of his brothers served in the Civil War and one brother, Colonel Freeman Norvell was a Marine officer in the Mexican War and also later at the Battle of Gettysburg. He enlisted in the army on January 23, 1858 as a private in Company A 5th US Infantry. During the early part of the American Civil War he served in Utah until 1860. As a first sergeant assigned to the 5th Infantry, he was engaged in battle with the Apache at Peralto, New Mexico in 1862. He was discharged from the enlisted ranks on January 23, 1863, and became a 2d Lt. of the 13th Infantry on February 19, 1863, and a 1st Lt. July 12 of that year (Robertson). Later, he was assigned to the Military Division of Mississippi in 1865 and with the reorganization of the Army after the War was at Fort Stevenson, Dakota Territory in 1868. He was transferred to the 31st Infantry on September 21, 1866, and promoted to Captain on June 10, 1868. From May 15, 1869, until January 1, 1871, when he went to the 10th Cavalry Regiment (United States) he was unassigned. Shortly after the Civil War, Congress authorized the formation of the 9th and 10th Cavalry and the 38th, 39th, 40th and 41st Infantry Regiments, six all black Buffalo Soldier regiments. The four infantry regiments later merged and formed the 24th and 25th Infantries, and were composed of former slaves, freemen and African American Civil War soldiers. Stevens Thompson Norvell was assigned to the 10th Cavalry in 1870 and served at Fort Davis from August 1882 to April 1883 in command of Troop M, 10th Cavalry. He returned to Fort Davis briefly in July 1883. He was also stationed with the 10th Cavalry at Fort Custer Montana. During his tenure with the 10th Cavalry, he spent years leading his company against the Indian threat in the southwest, participating in several actions before finally being promoted to major in March 1890(Heitman). With the outbreak of the Spanish–American War, the 10th Cavalry was deployed to Cuba where, as commander of the 1st Squadron of the 10th Cavalry, Major Norvell lead his four companies of African American cavalrymen during the Battle of San Juan Hill, where he earned a commendation (Roosevelt). He was 64 years old at the time. He and his unit of the 10th Cavalry saw action at the battles of La Guasima, San Juan, and subsequent actions leading to the surrender of Santiago. After the historic battle for San Juan Hill, Lieutenant Colonel Norvell was placed in command of the 9th Cavalry Regiment (United States). He retired on February 14, 1899. He was promoted to Colonel on the retired list on April 23, 1904. Stevens Thompson Norvell married Sarah Elizabeth Proal on August 23, 1870 in St. Paul, Minnesota, born 1849 and died April 17, 1931, the daughter of Charles and Sarah Proal of Minneapolis."

  "text" : "Steve F. Sapontzis is professor emeritus of philosophy at California State University, East Bay, specializing in animal ethics and environmental ethics. He is the author of Morals, Reason, and Animals (1987) and Subjective Morals (2011), and editor of Food for Thought: The Debate over Eating Meat (2004). He was co-founder in 1984 of Between the Species: A Journal of Ethics, and founder of the Hayward Friends of Animals Humane Society. He obtained his BA from Rice University in 1967, and his MPhil and PhD from Yale University in 1970 and 1971. He joined the philosophy faculty at California State University, East Bay in 1971, and became professor emeritus in 1999. He was a member of the board of the American Philosophical Quarterly (1991-1994), and sat on the animal welfare research committee at Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory (1986-1990). Sapontzis is an advocate of animal rights. In Morals, Reason, and Animals, he argues that non-human animals have interests, and that it is the existence of interests that justifies inclusion in the moral community. He writes that human beings should extend to non-humans the same moral protection for the latter's interests that we enjoy for our own. He argues further that the burden of proof should shift toward those who argue against equal consideration for animals: Aristotle thought that men were naturally superior to women and Greeks naturally superior to other races; Victorians thought white men had to shoulder the burden of being superior to savages; and Nazis thought Aryans were a master race. We have come to reject these and many other supposedly natural hierarchies; the history of what we consider moral progress can be viewed as, in large part, the replacement of hierarchical worldviews with a presumption in favor of forms of egalitarianism. This substitution places the burden of proof on those who would deny equal consideration to the interests of all concerned, rather than on those who seek such consideration. Consequently, some reason is needed to justify the fairness of maintaining a hierarchical worldview when we are dealing with animals.\""

  "text" : "Steen Blicher (born 22 November 1923) is a Danish former amateur footballer who played in the left half-back position. Blicher played 8 games for the Denmark national football team, and was the captain of the Danish team at the 1952 Summer Olympics. Blicher was a technically limited player, who more than compensated through an immense fighting spirit. He played his club football in Copenhagen with KFUM's Boldklub and later Akademisk Boldklub (AB). In AB, his favorite half-back position was occupied by Danish international Ivan Jensen, and Blicher played some matches as a left winger. When Ivan Jensen turned professional following the 1948 Summer Olympics, Blicher replaced him as the AB left half-back. Blicher was a part of the AB team which won the Danish Championship in 1947, as well as 1951 and 1952. Blicher made his debut for the Danish national team on May 12, 1951, in a 1-3 defeat to the Scotland national football team. In the last warm-up game before the 1952 Summer Olympics, the Danish team captain, Knud Lundberg, was removed from the position, and Steen Blicher was assigned the position. As Lundberg was Blicher's captain at AB, it was an awkward appointment, but Blicher led the team well through example. Denmark was eliminated by the Yugoslavia national football team in the quarter-finals by 3-5, which was Blicher's last international game."

  "text" : "Ayatollah Aqa Syed Ahmed Rizvi Kashmiri was born at Nabidpore-Zadibal area of Srinagar city in Indian Administered Kashmir, in a revered religious and pious family and was a descendent of Shi'ite eighth Imam Ali al-Rizha, the son of Imam Musa al-Kadhim through one of the great saints and religious propagators Mir Aqa Syed Hussein Rizvi Qommi, who went to Kashmir from Qom, Iran in the year 821 A.H., during the reign of Sultan Sikander who appointed him as mentor of his son Sultan Zain-ul-Abidin locally known as Budshah. Haaj Aqa Syed Hussein Rizvi (d. 1942), father of Ayatollah Syed Ahmed Rizvi Kashmiri, was a learned and well known preacher of his time who was famous by name of Mir Haji Hussein. He, along with some other members of his family, used to travel to Skardu, Baltistan, Yarkand and adjoining areas on business trips and besides doing business preached Islam. He was famously known in Skardu, Baltistan as Mir or Master. His some descendents, who preferred to settle down there, are still remembered and revered as family of Ba’mir. Haaj Aqa Syed Hassan or Mir Syed Hassan (d. 1928), uncle of Ayatollah Aqa Syed Ahmed Rizvi, was also a well known Islamic scholar, preacher and a spiritual figure who had established a Husseiniyeh or a shrine for commemoration of the Martyrdom of Imam Hussein near his residence in Srinagar. The arranging of gatherings for observing the Martyrdom of Imam Hussein was an ancestral practice prevalent in the family since hundreds of years. The practice prevails even to this time and people gather on the same place to remember the Martyrs of Karbala, which was later-on established by Haaj Aqa Hassan and is famous as Shrine of Haaj Syed Hassan or Mir Hassan. Mir Syed Hassan himself is buried in the said Shrine. The family especially Mir Haaj Syed Hassan Rizvi and Mir Haaj Syed Hussein Rizvi, like their ancestors, had devoted themselves for disseminating the true features and knowledge of the religion of Islam."

  "text" : "Simon Francis Murphy (born 26 August 1973 in Balmain, Sydney) is an international award winning, Dutch based, Australian conductor and viola player with a focus on the music of the 18th and early 19th centuries. He is a leading member of the new generation of specialist early music performers, is regularly invited to conduct at the celebrated European music festivals, and is, since 2002, the chief conductor and artistic director of The Hague's Baroque Orchestra, The New Dutch Academy (NDA). Murphy has won major music industry awards, including the Dutch Edison Award (in 2004) and Luxembourg's Supersonic Award (in 2006). His groundbreaking performance of Corelli's Concerti Grossi at the Utrecht Early Music Festival in 2003, recorded for CD by Pentatone, was chosen as one of the top 5 highlights of the festival's 30-year history. Murphy made his Amsterdam Het Concertgebouw and Brussels Le Palais des Beaux-Arts (BOZAR / Centre for Fine Arts) conducting débuts in 2004, and his débuts at the Handel Festival, Halle, in 2008 and Bachfest Leipzig in 2010. Murphy is especially notable for his pioneering work in rediscovering and reintroducing forgotten 18th century, European, symphonic composers, particularly from and related to the Mannheim School (Mannheimer Schule). He has substantially enriched the modern symphonic, orchestral repertoire with his discoveries. Resulting from his research, Murphy has also been responsible for unveiling the previously unknown Dutch 18th century symphonic tradition, presenting this to the world through performances, radio and TV broadcasts, and the first CD recordings of this symphonic heritage. In particular, he has championed 18th-century composers Joseph Schmitt \"The Dutch Haydn\" and Francesco Zappa, making first CD recordings and new editions of their symphonic works."

  "text" : "Sandra Ann Carson, M.D., is the principal innovator of the first artificial human ovary. This innovation was reported in the Journal of Assisted Reproduction and Genetics, and recognized by Time magazine as one of the top 10 medical breakthroughs in 2010. In this work, Carson, et al. introduced theca cells donated by reproductive-age patients into \"3-D Petri dishes\" designed to resemble the sponge-like cells of a human ovary. In the lab, the cell types interacted with one another and functioned for all intents and purposes like a real ovary, even successfully maturing a human egg from its earliest stages in the follicle to a fully developed form. To build the ovary, honeycombs of theca cells were formed, one of two key types in the ovary, donated by reproductive-age patients at Women & Infants Hospital of Rhode Island. Together with human egg cells, donated granulosa cells were inserted into the honeycomb shape the theca cells formed. In days, the theca cells enveloped the granulosa and eggs, mimicking a real ovary. Clinically, the artificial ovary could play a significant role in the future, eventually yielding new infertility treatments for women by preserving the fertility of cancer patients, for example: immature eggs could be salvaged and frozen before chemotherapy or radiation, and then matured outside the patient in the artificial ovary. In parallel with this effort and a scientific first, Carson co-directed a research team by extracting information about gene expression from fertile human egg cells without hurting them. In this work the team was able to sequence the transcribed genetic material, or mRNA, in egg cells, in smaller structures pinched off from them called polar bodies. Polar bodies are nonfunctional and incapable of being fertilized. This new technique could ultimately give parents and doctors a preview of which eggs are likely to make the most viable embryos."

The discovery of exonerating documents led to a posthumous pardon and the posting of his slanderer to Tsukushi Province. His death brought the political ascendancy of the Soga clan to an end."

  "text" : "Simon III, Lord of Lippe (c. 1340 – 1410) was Lord of Lippe from 1360 until his death. He was to son of Otto, from whom he inherited the city of Lemgo. His control of the surrounding areas was initially uncertain. As late as 1368, the castellans of his castles and representatives of the cities of Horn, Detmold and Blomberg published a joint declaration, stating that in the future, they would only recognize the heir as their sovereign only if the two main cities in the Lordship, Lippstadt and Lemgo, would agree. In the ancestral lands around the cities of Lippstadt and Rheda, however, the situation was complicated, because after the death of his uncle Bernard V, around 1365, his widow Richarda had initially given his part of Lippe to Count Otto VI of Tecklenburg, who was the husband of her eldest daughter. In 1366, she had revoked the gift and acknowledged Simon III as her husband's heir. Otto VI, however, refused to return the gift. This led to a struggle that would last several decades. Matters were further complicated when Otto VI took Simon III prisoner in 1371. Simon III was released in 1374, but he had to pay a very high ransom. He ended up having to pledge half of Lippstadt in 1376 to the relatives of his mother, the House of La Marck. In 1379, a short-lived alliance consisting of the bishoprics of Paderborn, Münster and Osnabrück, the cities of Münster and Osnabrück, and Count Engelbert III of the Marck conquered the Lordship and City of Rheda. However, they did not hand it to Simon III. Instead, they gave it back to Otto VI, after the latter had paid 8000 guilders. Around 1400, the cites of Barntrup and Salzuflen and Sternberg Castle were pledged to Simon III. In 1405, the rest of the County of Sternberg followed. In 1403, Simon III agreed a treaty of inheritance with the childless Count Herman VII of Everstein. However, the Dukes of Brunswick-Lüneburg objected. They claimed that Everstein was a fief of Brunswick, and would therefore fall back to them when the Everstein family died out. In 1405, the conflict escalated to a feud, which was fought mostly on Lippe's territory. In 1408, Herman VII renounced his rights and gave Everstein to Brunswick. Simon III was married to Irmgard of Hoya and had seven children. He died in 1410 and was succeeded by his eldest son, Bernard VI."

  "text" : "Samuel Thompson Irwin (3 July 1877 – 21 June 1961), often known as S. T. Irwin, was an Irish rugby player, surgeon and unionist politician. Born in Claudy, County Londonderry, Irwin studied at Foyle College and Queen's College, Belfast. While studying, Irwin played for the Irish national rugby union team in nine Home Nations Championship matches, between 1900 and 1903, and he also played cricket to a high level. In 1911, Irwin was elected as a fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh, and began working at the Ulster Hospital for Children, where he developed an interest in orthopaedics, and he took up membership of the British Orthopaedic Association. He spent most of his career at the Royal Victoria Hospital, Belfast, but during World War I he worked at the Ulster Volunteer Force Hospital, serving in the Royal Army Medical Corps. He was the chair of the Northern Ireland Medical War Committee during World War II, and received the CBE for this work. Irwin continued his sporting interests, and was elected President of the Irish Rugby Union in 1935, and was Captain of the Royal County Down Golf Club in 1947/8. On retirement from his medical post, he stood for the Ulster Unionist Party at a 1948 by-election for the Queen's University of Belfast seat, and held this until his death in 1961. Alongside this, he served on the senate of the university, and sat on a wide range of committees, including serving as President of the Central Presbyterian Association. He was knighted in 1957. Irwin's son Sinclair Irwin also played rugby for Ireland and worked as a surgeon."

He also owned Gopsall Hall in Leicestershire. During the First World War Waring organised the production of war materials, including aircraft. He was also a director of the Duchess of Sutherland's Cripples' Guild, a member of Executive Committee of National Association of Ex-Soldiers, a supporter of Boy Scout Movement and founder of the Higher ProductionCouncil. He was created a Baronet, of Foots Cray Place, in the Parish of Foots Cray, in the County of Kent, in 1919, in recognition of \"public and local services\". In 1922 he was further honoured when he was raised to the peerage as Baron Waring, of Foots Cray Place in the County of Kent, in recognition of him being a \"Pioneer of decorative art in furnishing ... [and a] Generous supporter of charities.\" In 1930 Waring resigned as company chairman and became president until he died. Waring was a Commodore of the Royal Albert Yacht Club and owner of the yacht White Heather which he raced. He was the first president of the Furniture Trades Provident and Benevolent Association. Lord Waring married Eleanor Caroline Bamford, daughter of Charles Bamford, of Llanrhaiadr Hall, Llanrhaiadr, Denbighshire, and of Brookhurst, Cheshire, in 1890. They had one son, Arthur Samuel Bamford Waring, who died unmarried in 1911, aged 19, and a daughter, the Honourable Eleanor Gladys Waring, who married Captain Arthur Cunliffe Bernard Critchley (later Critchley-Waring). Lord Waring died at his home in London in January 1940, aged 79, when the baronetcy and barony became extinct. In 1946 Lady Waring sold Foots Cray Place to the Kent County Council."

His studies were especially focused on medieval Spanish language and literature, Hispanic folk literature, comparative literature and folklore. He studied ballads of Spain and North Africa. He excelled also in his studies of minority and archaic (but still existing) languages, such as the Spanish language of the Isleño communities in Louisiana  and, especially, the Sephardic Jews' language, Ladino. Armistead was author of a multi-volume series concerning the traditional literature of the Sephardic Jews and is author, co-author, editor, or co-editor of over twenty books and several hundred articles on medieval Spanish literature, modern Hispanic oral literature, and comparative literature. His research fields that have had special impact include early poetry, medieval history, Hispanic dialectology, the Spanish epic and Romance, old and traditional. He conducted numerous field surveys on the language and oral literature of the Sephardic communities of Morocco, the Middle East, rural communities in Portugal,Spain and Israel, and several sites in the United States. In addition, he performed pioneering studies on various genres of Hispanic oral tradition, such as the kharjas, riddles, the paremeología and folktales."

When 15 years old, Sidi Abdul-Rahman, with his father Sidi Mohamed Ben Makhlouf, went to Morocco for studies where he met the Muslim scholar Sidi Mohamed Ibn Marzoug Al Adrissi. In 1392, he made another trip to Bejaia (200 km east of Algiers) seeking knowledge where his father died. He stayed in Bejaia for 7 years studying Islamic sciences. He then travelled to Tunis in 1406, Cairo in 1414 and Bursa in Turkey, where he was well received and a shrine was erected in his honour which remains an endowment for this saint man. From Turkey, Sidi Abdul-Rahman went to perform Hajj to Mecca, after which he returned to his native Algeria after a 20 years. He taught in the Great Mosque of Algiers until he died on the Friday of 23rd of Ramadan 875 AH, the 15th of March 1479 after dedicating 95 years of his life to serve Islam and Muslims."

  "text" : "Stephen Moore, 2nd Earl Mount Cashell (19 March 1770 – 27 October 1822), styled Lord Kilworth between 1781 and 1790, was an Anglo-Irish politician. Moore was the eldest son of Stephen Moore, 1st Earl Mount Cashell, by Lady Helena Rawdon, daughter of John Rawdon, 1st Earl of Moira. He became known by the courtesy title Lord Kilworth after his father was elevated to an earldom in 1781. He was returned to the Irish House of Commons for Clonmel in May 1790, but was forced to resign his seat after only a few days on the death of his father. As the holder of an Irish peerage, Lord Mount Cashell was not allowed an automatic seat in the English House of Lords on the formation of the Union in 1800. However, in 1815 he was elected an Irish Representative Peer, replacing the deceased Earl of Westmeath, and was able to take his seat in the House of Lords. Lord Mount Cashell married Lady Margaret King, daughter of Robert King, 2nd Earl of Kingston, in 1791. They had seven children. The third son, Hon. Edward George Moore, became a Canon of Windsor Cathedral. He died in October 1822, aged 52, and was succeeded in the earldom by his eldest son, Stephen. The Countess Mount Cashell, who had left him circa 1803 for George William Tighe (by whom she had two more daughters, Lauretta and Nerina), died in January 1835."

His other publications include: An Architecture Notebook: Wall (Routledge, 2000); Doorway (Routledge, 2007); and Exercises in Architecture (Routledge, 2012). Together, the books form a corpus of work that establishes a consistent and widely applicable methodology for the analysis of architecture through drawing. Books by Unwin have been translated into Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Persian, Portuguese, Spanish and Russian. Unwin is also well known for his personal architectural notebooks which explore, through densely packed notes and meticulous and evocative drawings, various themes in architecture such as: Entrance (and the architectural in-between); Time (as an architectural element); Place (and architecture); and The Person (and architecture). Unwin is Emeritus Professor of Architecture at the Dundee School of Architecture, Scotland, where he was Professor from 2004 to 2009. Previously he was Senior Lecturer at the Welsh School of Architecture in Cardiff University, Wales, where he continues to teach design and architectural analysis. He has lived in Australia as well as the UK and taught or lectured in Israel, the USA, China, Malaysia, India, Sweden, Turkey and at other schools of architecture in the UK and Europe. He has been a member of the panel of judges for a number of architectural prizes and awards including The Andrew Doolan Prize for Architecture in Scotland (2006) RIAS Andrew Doolan Award for Architecture, the RIBA President's Medals Dissertation Prize (2008) RIBA President's Medals Students Award."

He recalled, \"As a kid, I would read the comics in the newspaper every single day. In elementary school, I drew Snoopy, Garfield, Popeye and other comic strip characters on classmates' folders for money.\" During his senior year in high school, Curtis began drawing editorial cartoons for the school newspaper and soon moved on to do editorial cartoons for Bowling Green's Daily News during his first year studying graphic design at Western Kentucky University. At the same time, he started doing illustrations for Western Kentucky University's student newspaper, the College Heights Herald, and he continued to draw editorial cartoons for both papers while staying in college for the next six years: I actually stayed on at the University for longer. Like I could have graduated in four years, but I stayed on longer, two more years, so I could continue being the cartoonist there. I was in college for like seven years. It was kind of like it is now; there's no jobs. I said, hey, I was getting paid as the editorial cartoonist at the paper, so I'm like, this is kind of my job. I just took the bare minimum classes that I had to each semester, so I could work at the paper."

The success of the street races laid strong foundations for the permanent circuit. In 1997, Stewart partnered with Elf and Renault of France to bring “Formula Campus” (a junior formula) to China, established Formula Racing Development Ltd (FRD Motorsports). At the same time he set up the first ever racing school in China and organized China’s first formula racing series.He was the Team Principal of the Volkswagen China (FAW) Factory Rally Team in 1999.

Over the 5 years, Tongyi Iced Tea, Yulin Pharmaceutical have sponsored the successful championship. In December of the same year, A1GP World Cup of Motorsport came to the track and thousands of fans were able to witness the exciting moment when A1 Team China driver Cheng Congfu achieved a podium finish in the race.Due to his series of successes in 2007, Stewart was awarded the “Man of the Year” by Autonews Magazine at the Golden Autosport Awards in 2008.

  "text" : "Dr. Sachchidananda Sinha (November 10, 1871- March 6, 1950) was an eminent and noted parliamentarian, educationist, lawyer and journalist of India. He was born in Arrah, in Bihar in a well-to-do Kayastha family. He did his study of Law at London to become a Barrister. He was hardly in his twenties, when he launched the movement for a separate Bihar, soon after returning from England as a barrister in year 1891-92. Away back in 1890 most of the people believed that it was not possible or even desirable. But, a small group of others and he persisted and the dream came true in 1911 when Bihar and Orissa came into existence as a separate province from Bengal at the famous Delhi Durbar. In his early years was a member of the Congress Party from the years 1899 till 1920 and even became its Secretary once. He participated in the Home Rule League Movement. He was one of the Vice-chancellors of Patna University and held the post from years 1936 to 1944. He built the famous Sinha Library in 1924 in memory of his wife, Radhika at Sinha Library Road, Patna, Bihar. He was a member of the Imperial Legislative Council from 1910 to 1920 and the Indian Legislative Assembly. He was Deputy President of the Assembly in 1921. He also held the office of the President in the Bihar and Orissa Legislative Council. He was appointed Executive Councillor and Finance Member of the Government of Bihar and Orissa, and, thus, was the first Indian who was ever appointed as a Finance Member of a Province. Later, he also was a member of the Bihar Legislative Assembly. In 1946, he was made the Interim President of the Constituent Assembly of India. Dr. Sinha also distinguished himself as a journalist. He was the publisher of the Indian Nation and editor of Hindustan Review. He wrote rich biographical sketches of his eminent contemporaries from Bihar and the rest of India which were later published in two volumes: 1) Some Eminent Behar Contemporaries and 2) Some Eminent Indian Contemporaries, which was published in year 1944. A constituent college in Aurangabad is dedicated to him and was named Sachchidanand Sinha College, which was founded by Akhouri Krishna Prakash Sinha along with eminent Gandhian Dr. Anugrah Narayan Sinha {later First Deputy Chief Minister of Bihar} before independence in the year 1943, who named it after Sachchidanand Sinha, as a living tribute to him, who was at that time 72 years of age."

  "text" : "Saint Septimius of Iesi (Italian: Settimio di Jesi) (d. 307) was the first bishop of Iesi, a martyr and a saint. Septimius was born in Germany, and after an education in the liberal arts began a military career. On his conversion to Christianity he parted from his family, who did not convert, and went to Italy, where he preached in Milan. He was forced to leave during the Persecution of Diocletian in 303. He later made his way to Rome, where the miracles he performed so impressed Pope Marcellus I that he created Septimius bishop of Iesi. Septimius established Iesi Cathedral but was opposed by the local magistrate Florentius, who, after Septimius refused to sacrifice to the pagan gods, had him decapitated. The body was re-discovered in 1469, although the cult of Septimius dated from much earlier, and translated to the cathedral, where a new altar was consecrated to the saint in 1623. The saint's feast day was on 5 September until 1623, when it was changed to 22 September. Septimius is the patron saint of Iesi."
