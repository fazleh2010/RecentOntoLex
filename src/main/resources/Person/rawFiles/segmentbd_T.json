  "text" : "Sir Thomas Myddelton Biddulph (29 July 1809 – 28 September 1878) was an officer in the British Army and courtier. He was the second son of Robert Myddelton Biddulph of Ledbury and younger brother of Robert Myddelton Biddulph of Chirk Castle. Educated at Eton College, Biddulph entered the Army with the purchase of a commission as cornet and sub-lieutenant in the 1st Regiment of Life Guards on 7 October 1826. He purchased further promotion to lieutenant on 23 February 1829 and captain on 16 May 1834. In 1837 and 1841 his brother Robert unsuccessfully tried to have him elected as Member of Parliament for the Denbigh Boroughs. Biddulph was granted brevet rank as a major on 9 November 1846. On 16 July 1851 Biddulph was appointed Master of the Household to Queen Victoria, an office for which he had been selected by Baron Stockmar. On 31 October that year he purchased the substantive rank of major in the 7th Light Dragoons, and then the rank of lieutenant-colonel on the unattached list the same day. He was made an Extra Equerry to the Queen on 16 July 1854 and promoted to brevet colonel on 29 January 1857, with seniority later antedated to 28 November 1854. On 16 February 1857 Biddulph married Mary Frederica Seymour (1824–1902), one of the Queen's maids of honour; she was the only daughter of Frederick Charles William Seymour (son of Vice-Admiral Lord Hugh Seymour) by his first wife Lady Mary Gordon (daughter of George Gordon, 9th Marquess of Huntly) and later served as an honorary Woman of the Bedchamber to the Queen. They had one son and one daughter. On 10 March 1863 it was announced that Biddulph would be made a Knight Commander of the Civil Division of the Order of the Bath; he received the knighthood on 27 March. He was promoted to major-general on 31 May 1865. On 3 March 1866 he resigned as Master of the Household and was appointed joint Keeper of the Privy Purse with Lieutenant-General Charles Grey. He was also appointed Receiver-General of the Duchy of Cornwall on 31 March that year. After Grey's appointment as Private Secretary to the Sovereign on 30 April 1867, Biddulph became sole Keeper of the Privy Purse. He was further appointed Receiver-General of the Duchy of Lancaster in 1873, and would hold all three offices to his death. He was promoted to lieutenant-general on 29 December 1873 and full general on 1 October 1877, and on 22 December 1877 was sworn of the Privy Council. General Sir Thomas Myddelton Biddulph died at the Mains of Abergeldie, near Balmoral, after a short illness during which Queen Victoria visited him daily. He was buried at Clewer."

  "text" : "Thomas Bedford (fl. 1650), theologian, was prominent in religious controversy between 1620 and 1650, but little is known of his personal history. He was educated at Queens' College, Cambridge, took degrees in arts, and afterwards proceeded B.D. In a letter to Baxter (1650) he says that \"he sat at the feet of Bishop Davenant\", who was Margaret Professor of Divinity from 1609 to 1621, and Master of Queens from 1614 to 1621. Davenant's successor in the professorship was Dr. Samuel Ward, and from these two Bedford affirms that his own theology was mainly derived. A Latin letter from Davenant to Ward on baptismal regeneration was copied by Bedford, and afterwards published by him, at Ussher's suggestion, as a preface to his thesis for the degree of B.D. held before Dr. Ward. In the above-mentioned letter to Baxter, Bedford explains that he was convinced of \"the efficacy of the sacrament to the elect\" by reading a book of Dr. Burges. This letter was written because Baxter had appended to his Plain Scripture Proof of Infants' Church Membership a refutation of what he considered Bedford's erroneous view of baptism, and Bedford's object was to show that their tenets were fundamentally the same. This Baxter admitted in a reply called A friendly Accommodation with Mr. Bedford (1656). In 1647 Bedford published an examination of antinomianism, the substance of which was taken from lectures he had given in the chapel of St. Antholine's parish, London. He received the rectorship of St Martin Outwich in the city of London some short time before 1649, for in that year he dedicated his Sacramental Instructions to the congregation as his \"first-fruits\" to them; and Thomas Pierce, the former rector, had been sequestrated a little before. How long Bedford continued as rector is not certain, but Matthew Smalwood was appointed previously to the Restoration (v. Newcourt, '\"Rep\".' i. 420). The only political sentiment Bedford shows is when, in his Examination of the Compassionate Samaritan, he urges the right and duty of the civil power to punish for heretical opinions. His theological writings are marked by a temperance alien to his time, and show an extensive reading, especially in the fathers of the church and in the continental theology of his time."

In 1780 he was placed in the office of Mr. John Davidson, of Newcastle upon Tyne, with a view to the study of conveyancing. There he became acquainted with George Pickering and James Ellis, who, together with Mr. Davidson's sons, formed a literary fraternity not very common in a lawyer's office. In 1784 Bedingfeld moved to Lincoln's Inn, and continued his legal studies under Matthew Duane, the eminent conveyancer, and his nephew, Mr. Bray. In 1787 he commenced practice as a chamber counsel–being, as a catholic, incapable of being called to the bar–and he was rising rapidly in his profession when his career was terminated by his death, which occurred in London on 5 November 1789. In person he is said to have resembled his celebrated contemporary, William Pitt, so much as sometimes to have been mistaken for him by the London populace. His poems were surreptitiously published in London–\"Poems by T. B–––g––––d, Esquire, of the Inner Temple\", 1800. Afterwards they were collected lay James Ellis, one of his youthful associates, and published under the title of \"Poetry, Fugitive and Original; by the late Thomas Bedingfeld, Esquire, and Mr. George Pickering. With notes and some additional pieces by a Friend\", Newcastle, 1815, octavo. Dedicated to Sir Walter Scott. The most laboured of his poems is 'The Triumph of Beauty', addressed to the Duchess of Devonshire on her successful canvass for Charles James Fox in 1784; but his best-known piece is the Instructions to a Porter, which has appeared in several collections."

  "text" : "Marshall was the son of \"John of the Forest,\" so called from the estate that he owned, and was educated in Rev. Archibald Campbell's school, and subsequently assisted George Washington in his surveying excursions for Lord Fairfax and others, for which he received several thousand acres of land in West Virginia. He was a lieutenant of Virginians in the French and Indian War, and participated in the Braddock Expedition against Fort Duquesne, but, having been detailed as one of the garrison at Fort Necessity, was not at the defeat. In 1753 he accepted the agency of Lord Fairfax to superintend a portion of his estate in the \"Northern neck,\" and in 1754 married Mary Randolph Keith, daughter of Rev. James Keith, an Episcopal clergyman of Fauquier County and Mary Isham Randolph of the influential Randolph family of Virginia. In 1765 he moved to Goose Creek, and in 1773 purchased \"The Oaks\" (or \"Oak Hill\") in Leeds parish in the northern part of Fauquier County. In 1767 he was high sheriff of Fauquier County, and he was frequently a member of the Virginia House of Burgesses. He condemned and pledged resistance to the encroachments of the crown, and was a member of the Virginia convention that declared her independence. In 1775, on the summons of Patrick Henry, he recruited a battalion and became major of a regiment known as the \"Culpeper Minutemen.\" He afterward became colonel of the 3rd Virginia Regiment. At the Battle of Brandywine, his command was placed in a wood on the right, and, though attacked by greatly superior numbers, maintained its position without losing an inch of ground until its ammunition was nearly expended and more than half its officers and one third of the soldiers were killed or wounded. The safety of the Continental Army on this occasion was largely due to the good conduct of Colonel Marshall and his command. The House of Burgesses voted him a sword. At Germantown, his regiment covered the retreat of the Continental Army. He was with Washington at Valley Forge, Pennsylvania. He was afterward ordered to the south, and was surrendered by General Lincoln at Charleston in 1780. When paroled he took advantage of the circumstance to make his first visit to Kentucky on horseback over the mountains, and then located the lands on which he subsequently lived in Woodford. Having been exchanged, he resumed his command and held it until the close of the war. In 1781 he was for a time in command at York. He was appointed surveyor general of the lands in Kentucky in 1783, in that year established his office in Lexington, and removed his family to Kentucky in 1785.

  "text" : "Thomas Worsnop (2 February 1821 – 24 January 1898) was an Australian colonial militia, historian, local government official and town clerk. Worsnop was born in Wortley, Yorkshire, England and died in North Adelaide, South Australia. Thomas Worsnop died on 24 January 1898 at his home in Barnard Street, North Adelaide. Worsnop arrived in South Australia on 12 November 1852. He first settled at Port Elliot with his family and worked as a storeman, for seven years, for Elder, Stirling and Company. In 1859 he was appointed a sergeant in the South Australian Volunteers. For a time he worked on the land but not with great success. Then he tried work as a publican and in 1863 he was lessee of the Globe Inn in Rundle Street, but he was declared bankrupt in 1864. Next, Worsnop took up the drudgery of work as a teamster in the north. Finally, in September 1866 he became a clerk in the Town Clerk's department in Adelaide and on 11 January 1869 was appointed acting town clerk taking over permanently later that year. Somewhat surprisingly, given his previous failures, Worsnop proved to be a good administrator and he was able to reduce the debt of the City Council. He was also most concerned with protecting the parklands and fascinated by the history of city and colony. In 1878 he wrote the detailed History of the City of Adelaide and later had published several papers on Aboriginal artefacts and weapons. He is commemorated with the naming in his honour of Mount Worsnop in the Gibson Desert of Western Australia by Sir John Forrest on 15 July 1874."

  "text" : "Thomas Mahieu (between 1515 and 1527 – after 1588), also known as Thomas Maiolus, was a French courtier and bibliophile with a special interest in decorative bookbindings. Mahieu was advisor and secretary to Henry II of France, personal secretary to Catherine de' Medici from 1549 to 1560, and subsequently Treasurer-General of France.His book collection is considered second only to that of Jean Grolier, who is considered Mahieu's mentor and spiritual father. Mahieu and Grolier used similar Latin ownership inscriptions on their bindings. Mahieu used the Latinized form of his name on bookplates, Maiolus, which for centuries was mistaken for an Italian surname. It was not discovered until 1926 that Maiolus, the otherwise unattested supposed Italian, and Mahieu, the prominent French politician, were the same person. Today, about 120 books are ascribed to Mahieu."

Ling studied at Central Saint Martins College of Art and Design in London (graduating in 1989) before working in Paris in the design studio of Christian Lacroix. On her return to London she started a contemporary art gallery with her husband William Ling called Bipasha Ghosh. An exhibition of her own drawings (1996) in the studio of artist Gavin Turk on London's Charing Cross Road led to a commission from British Vogue and a subsequent career as a fashion illustrator. As an illustrator Ling has made work for many of the world's leading fashion publications and fashion businesses including Harper's Bazaar, Vogue, Louis Vuitton and Selfridges. In 2002 Ling launched her own ready-to-wear collection, which was featured in the windows of Henri Bendel on 5th Avenue, New York where the collection was sold. In the following year British Vogue named her one of the most important trend-setters in Britain and The Observer Magazine announced her as their designer of the year. Her A/W 2003 collection was shown at the Institute of Contemporary Arts in London. She was appointed (2009) as the Creative Director of Veryta, a new Ready-to-Wear collection founded by Filippo Binaghi and Stefano Pilati to support the Veryta Foundation. In 2011 over fifty of her drawings were acquired by the Victoria and Albert Museum in London."

  "text" : "Theodor Friedrich Marsson (8 November 1816 – 5 February 1892) was a German pharmacist and botanist. Marsson was born in Wolgast, Prussian Pomerania, just a year after the Swedish Empire had de-occupied the city, which had been under Swedish control since the Thirty Years' War. He was father-in-law to physiologist Leonard Landois (1837–1902). The son of a pharmacist, he studied chemistry under Justus von Liebig (1803–1873) at the University of Giessen. After completing his studies he took charge of the pharmacy in his hometown of Wolgast. In 1840 he provided necessary information towards the publication of Wilhelm Ludwig Ewald Schmidt's Flora von Pommern und Rügen (Flora of Pomerania and Rügen). In 1856 he was awarded an honorary PhD from the University of Greifswald. In 1869 he published a botanical study on Neuvorpommern and the islands of Usedom and Rügen titled Flora von Neuvorpommern und den Inseln Usedom und Rügen. Around 1870 he sold the pharmacy in Wolgast and retired to private life in Greifswald, later relocating to Berlin. In retirement he turned to microscopical research, making contributions in the field of palaeontology. On the basis of fossils found in chalk deposits at Rügen he composed works on foraminifera (1878), ostracods and cirripedes (1880). In 1887 he published a highly regarded work titled Die Bryozoen der weissen Schreibkreide der Insel Rügen (Bryozoa of the white chalk of Rügen). Marsson's last scientific activity dealt with living organisms, involving microscopic research of diatoms. The mycological genus Marssonina was named after him by Paul Wilhelm Magnus. The standard author abbreviation T.Marsson is used to indicate this individual as the author when citing a botanical name."

  "text" : "Miriam García Iborra, Antonia (Toñi) Gómez Rodríguez and Desirée Hernández Folch, known as The Alcàsser Girls (Spanish: Las niñas de Alcàsser), were three teenage girls from Alcasser, a small town near Valencia, Spain, who were kidnapped, raped, beaten, tortured and murdered after hitchhiking to get to a disco in the nearby town of Picassent in late 1992. It is widely regarded as one of the darkest and most haunting criminal cases Spanish history due to the extreme violence with which it was committed and the details of the autopsies. It shocked the country, and the images of their faces were very prominent in media coverage. Posters were published in various languages throughout Spain and abroad. The initial uncertainty of the girls' whereabouts and the increasing fear about the nocturnal risks facing teenagers added to the sense of unease. The case was also very relevant due to a highly criticized investigation full of mistakes and gaps. The autopsies revealed the existence of seven hairs with seven distinct DNA profiles that belonged neither to the girls or their two alleged murderers, the men who drove the car they hitchhiked. Of the two, Miguel Ricart Tárrega was the only one jailed, whereas the whereabouts of Antonio Anglés Martins are not known and he is still among Interpol's most wanted criminals. Many observers claim that the official version was a coverup to hide the reality of the triple murder, and several theories were proposed about its main motive, from satanic rituals to a snuff movie recording, and even including a crime involving the highest political circles in Spain. The event also marked a turning point in Spanish mass media, which quickly focused on the anguish and suffering of the girls' families and the local people. It is often cited as the zenith of trash TV in Spain, in which anything went in the name of morbidity and high audience rates."

  "text" : "Traianus Mucianus was a Roman soldier of Thracian origins of the second half of the Third Century AD who rose from the lowest ranks of the army to senior commands. He was almost certainly a remarkable soldier. However, the successive promotions he secured in the latter part of his career are thought to owe much also to the favour shown him by men highly placed in the Imperial entourage whose patronage secured him advantageous postings in the Imperial comitatus, the mobile field force under the direct command of the Emperor, that was undergoing massive expansion at this time. It seems likely that Mucianus's recorded career was passed entirely in military service. However, information relating to his later life is so fragmentary that it is not possible to be certain of this. The evidence can be construed as to read that, after achieving equestrian status (see Roman equestrian order), he was from time to time given gubernatorial postings in his home-province of Thracia and elsewhere."

  "text" : "Trina Y. Vargo is the founder and President of the US-Ireland Alliance, a non-profit, non-partisan organization dedicated to educating Americans about Ireland and strengthening the relationship on the basis of education, culture and business. Vargo created the organization in 1998. In that capacity, she created the George J. Mitchell Scholarship program, recognized as one of the most prestigious scholarships for study abroad for young Americans. She also created an annual event in Hollywood, Oscar Wilde: Honoring the Irish in Film. The event celebrates the contributions of the Irish in Film. From 1987 until May 1998, Vargo served as a Foreign Policy Adviser to Senator Edward M. Kennedy (D-MA) in Washington D.C. During her years with Senator Kennedy, she worked directly with political leaders in Northern Ireland, the Clinton Administration, and the Irish Government, serving as a key behind-the-scenes player in the Northern Ireland peace process. She was instrumental in negotiating a visa for Gerry Adams to visit the United States in 1994. That visit led to the historic IRA cease-fire declaration in August 1994. In 1993, Vargo assisted Ambassador Madeleine Albright in preparation for her Senate confirmation hearings for the Cabinet post of U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations. She also helped prepare Ambassador Jean Kennedy Smith, the U.S. Ambassador to Ireland, for her June 1993 confirmation Senate hearing. She has briefed all subsequent US Ambassadors to Ireland, Democrats and Republicans. In a personal capacity, since 1988, Vargo has advised U.S. presidential campaign teams on Irish issues. Most recently, she served as the Obama campaign’s adviser on Irish issues. While working with Senator Kennedy, in addition to Irish issues, Vargo was involved in many foreign policy matters, including imposing sanctions in 1995 on Libya in the aftermath of the bombing of Pan Am flight 103; efforts to bring free elections to Guyana in 1992, the first in decades; allowing Refuseniks (Soviet Jews) from the former Soviet Union to emigrate in the late 1980s and early 1990s; and changing the way the Department of State analyzed and characterized the meaning of other countries’ votes in the United Nations. Vargo remained involved in the Pan Am 103 bombing issue after leaving Kennedy’s employ, writing an op-ed opposing Scotland’s decision to release Abdel Basset al-Megrahi in the Irish Times in 2009. Vargo graduated Magna Cum Laude from the University of Pittsburgh with degrees in Political Science and History. As the recipient of a Rotary International Fellowship, she attended McGill University in Montreal, where she obtained an M.A. degree in Political Science."

  "text" : "Tōichirō Kinoshita  (木下東一郎,  Kinoshita Tōichirō ; b. 23 January 1925 in Tokyo) is a Japanese-American theoretical physicist. Kinoshita studied physics at the University of Tokyo, where he in 1947 earned his baccalaureate degree and in 1952 attained a doctorate. Afterwards he spent two years as a postdoc at the Institute of Advanced Study and in 1954 at Columbia University. Starting from 1954 he was at Cornell University, 1955 as assistant professor, 1958 as associate professor and starting from 1960 as a full professor (starting from 1992 as Goldwin Smith professor) at Newman Laboratory of Nuclear Studies of Cornell University. In 1962-63 he was a Ford Fellow at CERN. In 1995 he retired from Cornell as professor emeritus. He was a guest professor at the University of Tokyo, at CERN, and at the national laboratory for high-energy physics KEK in Japan. Kinoshita is known for his extensive precision computations of fundamental quantities in quantum electrodynamics. The fundamental quantities involved electroweak theory and corrections related to the Standard Model, such as the anomalous magnetic moments of both the electron and the muon and the spectra of positronium and muonium, which made possible far more exact comparisons between theory and experiment. In 1962 he introduced the Kinoshita-Lee-Nauenberg theorem. In the 1970s he worked on quantum chromodynamics and quarkonium - spectroscopy with Estia Eichten, Kenneth Lane, Kurt Gottfried. In 2001 Kinoshita had to admit there was an error in his computation of the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon, after experiments at Brookhaven discovered a discrepancy in the 9th to-right-of-the-decimal-point position — leading many to believe that experimental evidence had revealed \"new physics\". However, a group in Marseille examined Kinoshita's calculation in precise detail and found that the error resulted from a sign error within the computer algebra program used for the original calculation. When the software bug was fixed, the discrepancy was resolved. In 1973-1974 he was a Guggenheim Fellow. He received in 1990 the Sakurai prize. In 1991 he became a member of National Academy of Sciences."

He is said to have been the first to project 'the bringing of the waters of the Lea from Ware to London.' In conjunction with Frederico Genebelli he was employed as a military engineer in strengthening the works at Tilbury and Gravesend at the time of the Spanish Armada. He died in April 1595. Thomas Bedwell was uncle of William Bedwell, the Arabic scholar, who speaks of him as 'our English Tycho.' The two are sometimes confounded, chiefly, it would appear, on account of an ambiguity on the title-page of the first of two works published by the nephew in explanation of a 'ruler' or mesolabium architectonicum which the uncle had devised to facilitate carpenters' calculations."

  "text" : "The Toulouse and Montauban shootings were a series of three gun attacks committed by one man from March 11 to 19, 2012, targeting French Muslim soldiers and Jewish civilians in the cities of Montauban and Toulouse in the Midi-Pyrénées region of France. In total, the shooter killed seven people and wounded five, four seriously. The shooter was shot and killed by police after a 30-hour siege at his apartment in Toulouse. The first attack occurred on 11 March; a French Muslim paratrooper was shot dead in Toulouse. A second attack on 15 March killed two uniformed French Muslim soldiers and seriously injured another in a Montauban shopping centre. On 19 March, four people, including three children, were killed at the Ozar Hatorah Jewish day school in Toulouse. Four other persons were wounded. Thereafter, France raised its Vigipirate, the terror alert system, to the highest level in the Midi-Pyrénées region and surrounding departements. The United Nations, many governments around the world, and the French Council of the Muslim Faith condemned the attacks. Police identified the shooter as Mohammed Merah, a 23-year-old French petty criminal of Algerian descent who was born and raised in Toulouse. He was killed by police after a 30-hour siege at his family's apartment there, during which he wounded three police. Merah reportedly attacked French Army personnel because of the army's participation in the war in Afghanistan against al-Qaeda. During the siege, Merah admitted antisemitic motives as well, saying he had attacked the Jewish school because \"The Jews kill our brothers and sisters in Palestine.\""

  "text" : "Trayvon Benjamin Martin (February 5, 1995 – February 26, 2012) was an African American from Miami Gardens, Florida, who, at 17 years old, was fatally shot by George Zimmerman, a neighborhood watch volunteer, in Sanford, Florida. Martin, who was serving a school suspension, had gone with his father on a visit to his father's fiancée at her townhouse at The Retreat at Twin Lakes in Sanford. On the evening of February 26, Martin went to a convenience store and purchased candy and a canned drink. As Martin returned from the store, he walked through a neighborhood that had been victimized by robberies several times that year. Zimmerman, a member of the community watch, spotted him and called the Sanford Police to report him for suspicious behavior. Moments later, there was an altercation between the two individuals in which Zimmerman shot Martin in the chest. Zimmerman, who was injured in the altercation, was not charged at the time of the shooting by the Sanford Police, who said that there was no evidence to refute his claim of self-defense and that Florida's stand your ground law prohibited law-enforcement officials from arresting or charging him. After national media focused on the tragedy, Zimmerman was eventually charged and tried in Martin's death. A jury acquitted Zimmerman of second-degree murder and of manslaughter in July 2013. Martin was born in Miami, Florida, and attended both Norland Middle School and Highland Oaks Middle School, in north Miami-Dade County, Florida. He attended Miami Carol City High School in Miami Gardens for his freshman and sophomore years, and at the time of the shooting was a junior at Dr. Michael M. Krop High School in north Miami-Dade. Following Martin's death, rallies, marches and protests were held across the nation. In March 2012, hundreds of students at his high school held a walkout in support of him. An online petition calling for a full investigation and prosecution of Zimmerman garnered 2.2 million signatures. Also in March, the media coverage surrounding Martin's death became the first story of 2012 to be featured more than the presidential race, which was underway at the time. A national debate about racial profiling and stand your ground laws ensued, and the governor of Florida appointed a task force to examine the state's self-defense laws. Martin's life was scrutinized by the media and bloggers who examined the digital footprint he had left behind. On social media, the name \"Trayvon\" was tweeted (mentioned in posts to Twitter web feeds by users of the service) more than two million times in the 30 days following the shooting. More than 1,000 people attended the viewing of his remains the day before his funeral, which was held on March 3, 2012 in Miami, Florida. He was buried in Dade-Memorial Park (North), in Miami. A memorial was dedicated to Martin at the Goldsboro Westside Historical Museum, a black history museum in Sanford in July 2013."

  "text" : "Thomas Jasper Johnson or Tom Johnson (January 11, 1923 – March 13, 2012) was an American electronics engineer and astronomer who founded Celestron, a company which manufacturers telescopes, which revolutionized the amateur astronomy industry and hobby. Sky & Telescope magazine has called him, \"among the most important figures shaping the last half century of amateur astronomy.\" Johnson was born in 1923. He served as a military radar technician during World War II. In 1955, Johnson, an engineer, established Valor Electronics, which produced electronics for military and industrial use. Valor, which was headquartered in Gardena, California, had more than one hundred employees by the early 1960s. Johnson, who had a strong interest in amateur astronomy, originally created Celestron as the \"Astro-Optical\" division of Valor Electronics in 1960. Around 1960, Johnson had been looking for a telescope which could be used by his two sons, but found no such child friendly models on the market at the time. Johnson built a new telescope, a 6-inch reflector telescope, by himself, in 1960. Richardson Medal On July 28, 1962, publicly unveiled a new invention, a portable  18 3⁄4-inch Cassegrain telescope at the party held by the Los Angeles Astronomical Society on Mount Pinos. The new transportable telescope proved so groundbreaking that Johnson's invention was featured on the cover of a 1963 issue of Sky & Telescope. Johnson's interest in telescopes soon became a full-fledged business. Johnson's new company, Celestron, which descended from the \"Astro-Optical\" division of Valor Electronics, soon began selling more sophisticated Schmidt–Cassegrain telescopes in models ranging from just 4 inches to 22 inches. However, the Schmidt–Cassegrain telescope proved difficult to mass-produce because the models needed Schmidt corrector plate, an advanced aspheric lens, which could be hard to manufacture. To solve this production problem, Johnson and the company's engineers invented a new type of telescope, the Celestron 8, in 1970. The Celestron 8 was more compact, affordable and easier to manufacture than traditional telescopes, like the Schmidt–Cassegrain. Johnson's new telescope proved very popular in the amateur astronomy and educational industries, allowing the hobby to rapidly expand and reach more consumers. Johnson sold Celestron in 1980. Johnson was awarded the David Richardson Medal from the Optical Society of America in 1978, the Bruce Blair Medal from the Western Amateur Astronomers in 1993, and the Lifetime Achievement Award by the Small Telescope & Astronomical Society in 2009. Tom Johnson died at 5 a.m. PST on March 13, 2012, at the age of 89."

Merry died at Westminster, aged about 76 and was buried lies in the vault of his grandfather at Walthamstow. John Aubrey described him in October 1682 after his death as \"a great algebraist and a great Whig\" and noted that \"it was a pity his papers were lost, for ‘he had done all Euclid in a shorter and clearer manner than ever was yet done, and particularly the tenth book. I have seen it.\" Merry married Elizabeth Duncombe, daughter of George Duncombe of Albury, Surrey and had fourteen sons and five daughters. She died on 9 July 1653. In his will, Merry cut off his three surviving children and two grandchildren with a shilling each."

He was born in Kristiania as a son of Ole Wettre (1830–1898) and Christine Elisabet Johannesen (1833–1920). He was a younger brother of businessman Ragnar Wettre. He attended Kristiania Borger- og Realskole, and at the school's hundredth anniversary in 1912 he and two brothers donated NOK 1,000 (more than 50,000 in modern currency) to the school. After finishing Kristiania Commerce School in 1890, Wettre worked office jobs in Norway until 1907, except for the period 1893 to 1899 when he stayed abroad. In 1908 he became a co-owner of the company Peter Thr. Duborgh. From 1929, when William Duborgh died, Wettre was the company's sole owner, and when he died, the company was passed on to Ragnar Wettre. In 1916 he entered the first board of the Scandinavian American Assurance Corporation, together with L. S. Karlsen, Harald Hougen and B. Dreyer. He was the deputy chair of Kristiania Handelsstands Forening from 1916 to 1919, was a member of the 50-man committee of the Kristiania Chamber of Commerce and the Kristiania Stock Exchange arbitration court, and a board member of the Norwegian Branch of the International Law Association. He was a supervisory council member of Borregaard, De forenede Uldvarefabriker, Det Norske Luftfartrederi, Schous Bryggeri, Den Norske Remfabrik, Lilleborg and De-No-Fa, and a board member of Norsk Aeroplanfabrik, Forsikringsselskapet Viking, Bergens Privatbank, Store Norske Spitsbergen Kulkompani and Vinmonopolet. During prohibition in Norway (which was discontinued followed a 1926 referendum), Wettre was dispatched to conduct various negotiations with wine exporting countries: in Paris in 1923, Madrid in 1924 and Rome 1925. He was also decorated as a Chevalier of the Legion of Honour and Commander of the Order of the Crown of Italy. Wettre was however ousted from the board of Vinmonopolet after three seasoned wine importers, Carl, Sven and Roald Dysthe, unveiled and campaigned against nepotism between the board of directors and Mowinckel's Second Cabinet. Wettre and others ran a libel case against the Dysthe brothers, and was represented by barrister Per Strand Rygh, but lost the case. Before his death in 1936 he was the vice chairman of the France-Norway Chamber of Commerce. He was buried at Vår Frelsers gravlund."

He was elected president of Miami University but declined the appointment. Later in 1850 Stockton returned to Baltimore and the Methodist Protestants. Stockton gave the opening prayer at the consecration of the National Cemetery at Gettyburg, the ceremony during which Abraham Lincoln later gave the Gettysburg Address.

  "text" : "Thomas Robert Threlfall (6 October 1852–fl.1932), known as T. R. Threlfall, was a British trade unionist and Liberal-Labour politician. Threlfall was elected as a member of the Southport Town Council, and as President of Southport Trades Council. He was also active in the Typographical Association, and championed the idea of working men standing for election to Parliament. In 1885, he persuaded the Association to sponsor two candidates: Frederick Maddison, and Threlfall himself, who stood for the Liberal Party at the 1886 general election in Sheffield Hallam. In 1885, the Trades Union Congress (TUC) was held in Southport, and Threlfall was elected to serve as its President. At the following congress, he convinced the TUC to form a Labour Electoral Committee, to sponsor candidates for election to Parliament. He served as the body's first Secretary, and focused his activity on forming local labour electoral organisations, affiliated to the national body. The Committee was renamed as the \"Labour Electoral Association\", and although it championed representation through the Liberal Party, it did sponsor Keir Hardie's independent candidacy at the Mid Lanark by-election, 1888. Threlfall stood for Parliament again, as a Lib-Lab candidate, in Liverpool Kirkdale at the 1892 general election, but he was again unsuccessful. Given its generally disappointing results, the body declined in importance, although Threlfall remained its Secretary until it was wound up, in 1895. Threlfall was subsequently appointed as a magistrate in Southport. He also took up literature. The Sword of Allah, published in 1899, was described by the Saturday Review as an \"illiterate shocker\", and The Strange Adventures of a Magistrate was published in 1903. In 1900, he wrote an article for The Nineteenth Century, in which he proclaimed that the Senussi would lead a holy war against Britain and France. He applied unsuccessfully to the Royal Literary Fund in 1914 and successfully in 1929 and 1932."

Born and raised in Czechoslovakia, Messer became a U.S. citizen in 1944 and served in the U.S. Army in World War II. He earned a master's degree in art history and museology from Harvard University. From 1947 to 1961, he worked in a series of art and museum administration positions, the last of which was director of the Institute of Contemporary Art, Boston. In 1961, he became director of the Guggenheim Museum in New York. There, he was able to establish the usefulness of the spiral-shaped Frank Lloyd Wright-designed Guggenheim as a venue for the display of art, despite the doubts of critics and artists. Messer was instrumental in expanding the museum's collection during his tenure, especially by persuading Peggy Guggenheim to donate her collection to the Guggenheim Foundation. He retired in 1988 to take up freelance curating, teaching, writing, lecturing."

  "text" : "Terry Martin (1937 – May 12, 2012) was a California surfer and surfboard shaper who worked for Hobie Surfboards, shaping more than 80,000 surfboards, including boards for surf legends such as Corky Carroll and Phil Edwards. Martin grew up inland and was not exposed to surfing until later into his life. At the age of 14, his family moved to Point Loma. His first board was 13 feet (4.0 m) long and weighed 85 pounds (39 kg). At the time surfboards were over 80 pounds (36 kg), and tended to be very long. Martin graduated from Point Loma high school. He served in the Air Force Reserves, and worked in construction, in shipbuilding, and as a door to door salesman. In 1963, he joined Hobie Alter in his Hobie Surf Shop. The first board Martin created was a 10-foot (3.0 m) board made out of lighter balsa wood and redwood that he had salvaged from a lumber yard. This board weighed only 20 pounds (9.1 kg). It also had no fin, which allowed Martin to do tricks and moves that other surfers weren’t able to do. Martin shaped an average of 10 boards a day. He was given the nickname “The Machine.” Over a span of six decades, he created around 80,000 surfboards. He created signature boards for Gary Propper, Corky Carroll, Gerry Lopez, Wayne \"Rabbit\" Bartholomew and Joyce Hoffman. The last board he made was a 10-foot (3.0 m) balsa and redwood Hot Curl. This was a replica of the a board he had made when younger. Martin died of melanoma on May 12, 2012."

He represented Prince Albert in the Legislative Assembly of Saskatchewan from 1925 to 1939 as a Liberal. He was born in Prince Albert, Saskatchewan, the son of Thomas Osborne Davis, and was educated there and at St. John's College and Osgoode Hall. Davis then practised law in Prince Albert and later served two terms as alderman for the city; he was mayor from 1921 to 1924. Davis served in the provincial cabinet as Minister of Municipal Affairs and as Attorney General. He helped convince William Lyon Mackenzie King to create Prince Albert National Park, which was opened in 1928. In 1929, Davis defeated John Diefenbaker to retain his seat in the provincial assembly. He resigned his seat in the provincial assembly in 1939 to become a judge in the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal. Davis' judicial career ended in 1940 when he was named federal Deputy Minister of War Services; however, he did not resign from the Court of Appeal until 1948.

On that day, when he was 18 years and 1 month old, he killed the wife of a white-collar worker (then 23 years old) and then performed necrophilia on the body, and also killed her daughter Yuka Motomura (本村 夕夏) (then 11 months old), and stole their wallet. He was charged with rape, murder and robbery, and was handed the death sentence although he was not of the age of maturity (20 years of age in Japan) at that time (18 years and 1 month). The appeal was rejected. During the trial, the brutality of the details of the incident and the demands by the defense lawyers that teenagers ought not receive the death sentence were widely reported in mass media, sparking a debate within Japan."

  "text" : "Trevor James King, also known as \"Kingso\" (c. 1953 – 9 July 1994), was a British Ulster loyalist and a senior member of the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF). He was commander of the UVF's \"B\" Company, 1st Belfast Battalion, holding the rank of Lieutenant Colonel. On 16 June 1994, he was one of three UVF men gunned down by the Irish National Liberation Army as he stood on the corner of Spier's Place and the Shankill Road in West Belfast, close to the UVF headquarters. His companion Colin Craig was killed on the spot, and David Hamilton, who was seriously wounded, died the next day in hospital. King was also badly injured; he lived for three weeks on a life-support machine before making the decision himself to turn it off. Two days after the shooting, the UVF retaliated against Irish nationalists by carrying out the Loughinisland massacre against the Heights Bar, in which six Catholic customers died as they watched the Republic of Ireland play Italy in the World Cup football match. There are several murals in the Shankill Road area commemorating King. One of these is a mural and plaque dedicated to him, David Hamiliton and William \"Frenchie\" Marchant, which stands at the Spiers Place and Shankill Road junction. An oversized mural painted on the gable end of a house in Disraeli Street, Woodvale, features a portrait of King with an inscription from a poem by Siegfried Sassoon."

Its proposed alignment through the “Merivale Corridor” bisected near west-end residential communities. In the fall of 1974 at the age of 27, he was elected to Ottawa City Council and the Council of the Regional Municipality of Ottawa-Carleton (RMOC). He served three 2-years terms and represented the City of Ottawa on the RMOC Executive Committee for four years. A noted community activist, he was a member of the Algonquin College Community Development Program Community Advisory Committee and developed a community consultation process for reviewing proposed City and Regional budgets with his constituents. This process may have provided a model for similar, subsequent initiatives by more senior governments. On his retirement from City and Regional Councils, he went on to direct Algonquin College’s Adult Basic Education department and then worked for 8 years as the Town of Renfrew’s Chief Administrative Officer. During both his elected and appointed municipal service he was active in the Association of Municipalities of Ontario as a member of its Board of Directors and Executive Committee and representing the Association on the Provincial-Municipal Liaison Committee. He also represented Ontario local governments at the 1976 United Nations Habitat Conference and Forum in Vancouver and as a member of the 1978 Provincial-local Government Committee on Property Tax Reform."

Wilson's father was a United States Navy fighter pilot in Vietnam, a TWA pilot for 30 years, and also a member of the Airline Pilot's Union. Wilson himself attended public elementary school where he met his wife Alyssa in the 5th grade. After going through the Darien Public School System, Wilson was accepted into Bowdoin College and later worked in Bridgeport, CT, building inner-city public-private partnerships. For the last 11 years, he has worked in the financial services industry in Manhattan. He previously worked as an independent commodity trader on the floor of the New York Board of Trade at the World Trade Center. Wilson got his start in public service when he co-founded the Tuxedo Land Trust (TLT) in 2006 when he saw a $15 billion real estate developer trying to cut down 2,300 acres of forest to build 2,000 homes, and threaten contamination of drinking water for hundreds of thousands in the Ramapo River and Tuxedo Lake. Wilson currently serves as the Managing Director of TLT. In 2010 Wilson was elected to the Village of Tuxedo Park Board of Trustees and shortly thereafter elected Elected Mayor of Tuxedo Park in 2011. In January 2012, Wilson announced his candidacy for United States Congress and has been campaigning in the Democratic Primary in hopes of unseating incumbent Republican Congresswoman Nan Hayworth. The Democratic Primary date is set for June 26, 2012."

She married an Austrian documentary filmmaker, Warner Fend, and had a great influence on Aung San Suu Kyi, as Than E, a family friend, persuaded Suu Kyi to relocate to New York City and work for the United Nations. Than E was born to a Baptist family and attended Rangoon University, before joining the Teacher's Training College. During the Japanese invasion of Burma in World War II, Than E escaped to India to work for the All India Radio's Burmese language service and subsequently spent the rest of her life abroad. She died at a retirement home in Oxford, United Kingdom on 17 June 2007."

  "text" : "Tamlin Blake (born 1974) is a South African mixed media artist living and working in Riebeeck West. The major themes of Blake's work revolve around cross-cultural South African symbols of wealth and status and, more recently, what constitutes and underpins each individuals sense of belonging. Her sculptural pieces often transcend boundaries between illustration, craft, and art, using weaving, beading, and drawing, amongst other media. The main body of Blake's beaded art works took the form of South African stamps finely woven using glass seed beads.“By replicating these original stamps in a traditional craft idiom that has such a strong association with indigenous African cultures , Blake offers a genteel but acerbic reference to [South Africa’s] troubled past.”(Innes 2012: pg20 ISBN 978-0-620-52880-1). While working on her own bead art Blake helped Jeanetta Blignaut, to establish a bead studio which today exists as the Qubeka Bead Studio, a collaborative owned by the bead artists themselves. After this Tamlin used a variety of different media including three-dimensional pieces in felt and beads to explore the use of farm animals as valued commodities and symbols of wealth and status across the boundaries of race and culture. Blake's more recent work consists of tapestries woven out of recycled and hand-spun newspaper  a collection of which were bought by The Spier Holdings Contemporary Art Collection"

  "text" : "Tommy Hall (born September 15, 1943) is an electric jug player from Texas. He was a founding member of the American psychedelic rock band The 13th Floor Elevators. A special aspect of The Elevators' sound came from Tommy Hall's innovative electric jug. The jug, a crock-jug with a microphone held up to it while it was being blown, sounded somewhat like a cross between a minimoog and cuica drum. In contrast to traditional musical jug technique, Hall did not blow into the jug to produce a tuba-like sound. Instead, he vocalized musical runs into the mouth of the jug, using the jug to create echo and distortion of his voice. When playing live, he held the microphone up to the mouth of the jug, but when recording the Easter Everywhere album, the recording engineer placed a microphone inside the jug to enhance the sound."

  "text" : "Theodor Friedrich Wilhelm Poesche (23 March 1825 – 27 December 1899) was a German American anthropologist and author, specializing in historical anthropology. Born in 1825 in Zoeschen (now part of Leuna) in the Province of Saxony of the Kingdom of Prussia, Poesche became astudent of philosophy at the University of Halle and later a revolutionary. Following the disappointments of 1848, in 1850 he emigrated to the United States. In 1853, he published with Charles Goepp The New Rome, or The United States of the World, a book in which they compare the United States to the Roman Empire. In 1878 he published The Aryans: A contribution to historical anthropology. Based on the physical characteristics attributed to Indo-Europeans (fair hair, blue or light eyes, tallness, slim hips, fine lips, a prominent chin) by the philologist Ludwig Geiger, Poesche placed the origin of the Aryans in the vast Rokitno Marshes, then in the Russian Empire, now covering much of the southern part of Belarus and the north-west of the Ukraine, where albinism was common. Similarly, he argued that the Lithuanian language is as near to the parent language of Indo-European as Sanskrit. Adding linguistic and archaeological arguments, Karl Penka later expanded the area of origin to include northern Germany and Scandinavia. Poesche died in Washington on 27 December 1899."

The perpetrator was thought to have stopped his assaults in 2005, but in November 2011, a 15-year-old girl was attacked, and DNA evidence was linked to the same rapist; however, the victim did not see the tattoo that many of the previous victims had, perhaps due to tattoo removal. After an attempted assault on June 15, 2012, police announced plans to canvas the Hispanic neighborhoods of Los Angeles and offered a $50,000 reward for information leading to an arrest. On 27 July 2013, LAPD announced their collaboration with the FBI, and increased the reward to $100,000 ($25,000 from the FBI). Also released was a new set of composite sketches."

His works were collected by famous clients, including Billy Baldwin, Marilyn Monroe, and a number of high-fashion New York families. Parzinger's last showroom, on East 57th Street, was closed not long after his death in 1981. His focus turned to Expressionist painting during the final 15 years of his life, no longer working on designing furniture. The company Parzinger had created, Parzinger Originals, was given to his friend Donald Cameron. Pat Palumbo, the owner of the gallery that sold Parzinger's pieces, worked with Cameron after Parzinger's death on reproductions of his work based on his original working sketches."

  "text" : "William Thomas Hallenback, Jr., known as William Thomas or simply as Thomas (March 20, 1947 – January 23, 2009), was an American anti-nuclear activist and simple-living adherent who undertook a 27-year peace vigil – the longest recorded vigil in US history – in front of the White House. Thomas was born in Tarrytown, New York and became a truck driver, jewelry maker and carpenter. Inspired by the Sermon on the Mount, he became a pilgrim and began traveling the world in the interests of world peace. In 1978, having tried to swim across the Suez Canal on his way to Israel, Thomas spent eight months in an Egyptian prison. Later, in response to United States foreign policy, he destroyed his passport while trying to renounce his American citizenship in London. The British authorities returned him to the United States in 1980. In 1981, Thomas traveled to Washington, D.C. and spent several months at Mitch Snyder's Community for Creative Non-Violence. On June 3, he launched the White House Peace Vigil in Lafayette Square. A couple of months later, in August 1981, he was joined by Concepcion Picciotto and then, in April 1984, by Ellen Benjamin. The following month, on May 6, 1984, Thomas and Ellen were married at a Quaker wedding. During the first three years of the vigil, the Park Police had arrested Thomas sixteen times. The charges ranged from illegal camping to disorderly conduct. In subsequent years, Thomas and Ellen protested with numerous other activists, including representatives from the Catholic Worker and Plowshares movements. Thomas died on January 23, 2009, aged 61, of pulmonary disease. Thomas and the White House Peace Vigil inspired Delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton to introduce the Nuclear Disarmament and Economic Conversion Act to Congress in 1994. It would require the United States to disable and dismantle its nuclear weapons – once all other nations possessing nuclear weapons did likewise – and redirect the funds saved into renewable energy and social projects. Since 1994, Norton has continued to introduce revised or renewed versions of the bill. In March 2011, for example, following the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster in Japan, it was reintroduced under the name of the \"Nuclear Weapons Abolition and Economic and Energy Conversion Act\". The Oracles of Pennsylvania Avenue, a 2012 TV documentary commissioned by the Al Jazeera Documentary Channel, recounts the lives of Thomas, Ellen, Concepcion Picciotto and Norman Mayer."

  "text" : "Thomas Geminus (1510 Lille - May 1562), was a pseudonym for the Flemish refugee Thomas Lambrit/Thomas Lambert, an engraver and printer, active from the 1540s in London, and noted for his 1545 Latin work, Compendiosa totius anatomie delineatio, aere exarata (\"A complete delineation of the entire anatomy engraved on copper\") printed by John Herford. Geminus started work in England by working with Thomas Raynalde and producing \"The byrth of Mankinde\" aka \"The Woman's booke\" in 1545. \"The byrth of Mankinde\", was the best English language reference work on midwifery in the 1500s. Its text was translated from Eucharius Rösslin's \"Der schwangern Frauwen und Hebammen Rosengarten\". Its first English edition was a 1540 translation by Richard Jonas. The second, by Thomas Raynalde, appeared in 1545 and saw many editions in the next 100 years. It discussed fertility, pregnancy, birth, and infant care, with the best anatomical descriptions then available. Its illustrations were again after Vesalius via Geminus’s \"Compendiosa\". The \"Compendiosa totius anatomie\" consisted of 41 unnumbered engraved sheets and was dedicated to Edward VI. One of the sheets was a fold-out engraving of the external anatomy of Adam and Eve; in addition there were 3 engravings of the skeleton, 16 of the muscles, 5 of the arteries and veins, 4 of the nerves, 6 of the organs, 4 of the brain, and one of the eye and its parts, all after woodcuts by Vesalius. The Latin edition of 1545 had been distributed in Italy, France, Spain, Germany, and other countries. Geminus wrote in the later English version that it had been produced for the benefit of \"unlatined Surgeons\". He had employed Nicholas Udall, the playwright, to translate some of the work, while the text was taken from an early translation of Henri de Mondeville's \"Surgery\". The book was a great success, printing three editions in England - one in Latin (1545) and two in English translation (1553 and 1559). In his engraved copies, Geminus removed all the detail he regarded as superfluous, notably the background landscapes which had informed Vesalius's images. The copperplate engravings were the first ever to be done in England, and enjoyed a large following in France. Jacques Grévin, the French poet who also happened to be a physician and writer on matters medical, had print editions done from Geminus's plates in 1564, 1565 and a French translation in 1569. Watermarks suggest that the plates for the 1564 Paris edition were printed in London and then transported to Paris."

  "text" : "Tom Rodgers (born July 28, 1960) is a Washington, DC, activist and advocate for Native Americans and tribal issues. He is an enrolled member of the Blackfeet Nation in Montana, and is a nationally-recognized commentator on Native American issues, politics, and ethics. In 1994, Rodgers founded Carlyle Consulting, a governmental/media/public relations firm located in Alexandria, Virginia that represents the interests of Native Americans. Rodgers played an important role in the investigation that led to the conviction of former lobbyist Jack Abramoff. Since then, Rodgers has waged a Native American Voting Rights effort to help provide Native Americans on remote, poverty-stricken reservations with equal access to voting. The effort drew the support of Department of Justice Civil Rights Division, as well as the American Civil Liberties Union and National Congress of American Indians, prevailing in the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals. Attorney General Eric Holder in June 2014 stated that the Montana native voting rights \"conditions are unacceptable and they are outrageous......As a nation, we cannot -- and we will not -- simply stand by as the voices of Native Americans are shut out of the democratic process.\" In May 2015, U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch transmitted to Vice President Joe Biden and Speaker of the House John Boehner a request in statutory form that the outcome sought in the Wandering Medicine litigation should be enacted into federal law. This was soon followed by introduction of legislation by Senators Jon Tester, Heidi Heitkamp, Tom Udall, and Al Franken. The federal action elevated the significance of the Wandering Medicine litigation in the Native Americans empowerment and enfranchisement movement dating back to the Indian Citizenship Act of 1924."

Theodotus was an Abbott at the Monastery of the Resurrection in Constantinople. His two-year reign as Patriarch of Constantinople was uneventful, and he died in office. He was Patriarch during the rule of Byzantine emperor Manuel I Comnenus. A letter from the Metropolitan of Ephesus, George Tornikes, to the Metropolitan of Athens, George Bourtzes, notes how Tornikes was nearly lynched by the \"rude mass of the clergy of Hagia Sophia\" when he objected to their plan to economise on Theodotus' funeral expenses. The desire to deny him the full measure of state funeral may have been due to accusations that the Patriarch was a Bogomil, an accusation levelled by the Patriarch-elect of Antioch, Soterichos Panteugenos, who used the dead Theodotus' \"black and withered hand\" as evidence of his heresy. John Kinnamos notes only that Theodotus was \"practiced in ascetic discipline.\""

  "text" : "Takashi Nagase (永瀬 隆 Nagase Takashi, c. 1918/19 – 21 June 2011) was an interpreter of the Ministry of War of Japan. He was born in 1918/19 in Kurashiki, Okayama, Japan. He learned English from an American Methodist in a college in Tokyo. He was one of the officers in charge of the construction of the \"Death Railway\" which ran between Thailand and Burma and included the famous bridge over the River Kwai, and is known for the use of forced labour of Allied prisoners of war, though the majority of the labour (and resultant deaths) was incurred by romusha, or local civilians pressed into labour. Nagase was first introduced to the British public in the documentary made by ex-POW John Coast about the realities of life on the Thai-Burma Railway, which was first broadcast in the UK on BBC2 on 15 March 1969. It was repeated on BBC1 on 4 August 1969 and again on Boxing Day 1974. The documentary was an early colour broadcast and part of the series One Pair of Eyes. Return to the River Kwai featured interviews with Nagase and two other Japanese soldiers who had worked with the prisoners on the railway. Nagase acted as both interpreter for the two other soldiers and interviewee. A transcript of the documentary and Nagase's responses to Coast's questions about the treatment of the POWs and some of the Japanese accused of war crimes after the war (plus some of Nagase's responses that did not make it into the final edit of the documentary) can be found in the new 2014 edition of Coast's book \"Railroad of Death\" originally published in 1946. Nagase was also noted for his reconciliation with former British Army officer Eric Lomax, whom he interrogated and tortured at a Japanese prisoner-of-war camp in 1942. Lomax then went on to discuss his reconciliation and eventual friendship with Nagase in his autobiography, The Railway Man. The book chronicled his experience before, during, and after the Second World War. It won the 1996 NCR Book Award and the J. R. Ackerley Prize for Autobiography. Nagase also wrote a book on his own experiences during and after the war entitled Crosses and Tigers, and financed a Buddhist temple at the bridge to atone for his actions during the war. The reconciliation between the two men was filmed as a documentary Enemy, My Friend? (1995), directed by Mike Finlason. After the end of the Second World War, Takashi Nagase became a devout Buddhist priest and tried to atone for the Japanese army's treatment of prisoners of war. Takashi made more than 100 missions of atonement to the River Kwai in Thailand. He died in 2011."

The song is sung to the tune of \"Baggy Nanny\", it is written in Geordie dialect and definitely has a strong Northern connection The song itself shows how the \"master and worker\" relationship of that day worked; where the apprentice was bound to the employer, and must do as instructed- but in return received a sound teaching of the trade. In this case the apprentice missed work to visit the Newcastle races on the Town Moor, despite being forbidden to do so by his indentures, and as a punishment was sent to \"the house of correction\", i.e. prison. Nothing more appears to be known of this person, or their life, not even their Christian name or sex."

  "text" : "Tracy William Thorne-Begland (born October 3, 1966) is an American judge on the General District Court of Richmond, Virginia, appointed in 2012. He was the first openly gay jurist elected by the Virginia General Assembly. After graduation from university, Thorne-Begland served in a jet combat squadron of the United States Navy. During the 1992 presidential campaign, he appeared on the television news program Nightline to criticize the Navy's policy of excluding homosexuals, identified himself as gay, and was honorably discharged from the service. As a result of the appeal processes, Thorne-Begland became interested in the law and obtained a law degree. After serving twelve years as a prosecutor, Thorne-Begland was nominated for an open seat on the General District Court of Richmond in 2012, but the Virginia House of delegates rejected him for the position for his perceived advocacy on homosexual issues. The Richmond Circuit Court judges granted him a temporary appointment to the post on June 14, 2012. On January 15, 2013, he was confirmed in the position by both houses of the Virginia General Assembly."

  "text" : "Toh EnJoe (Japanese: 円城 塔 Hepburn: Enjō Tō, pen name) (born September 15, 1972) is a Japanese author. His works are usually literary fiction, speculative fiction or science fiction. Born in 1972 in Sapporo. He graduated from the physics department of Tohoku University, then went on to the graduate school at University of Tokyo and received Ph.D. for a mathematical physical study on the natural languages. He worked as a post-doc researcher at several research institutes for seven years, then abandoned the academic career in 2007 and found a programmer job at a software firm (resigns in 2008 to become a full-time writer). In 2006, he submitted Self-Reference ENGINE to a science-fiction novel contest Komatsu Sakyō Award. Although it did not win the award (none did in this year), it was published from Hayakawa Shobō in 2007. At almost same time, his short story \"Obu za bēsbōru\" (\"Of The Baseball\") won the contest of literary magazine Bungakukai, which became his debut in literary fiction. His literary fictions are often dense with allusions. Labyrinthine annotations were added to \"Uyūshitan\" when it was published in book form in 2009, where there were none when published initially in literary magazine.Often, his science fiction works take motif from mathematics. The narrator of \"Boy's Surface\" (2007) is a morphism, and the title is a reference to a geometrical notion. In \"Moonshine\" (2009), natural numbers are sentient through a savant's mind's eye in a field of the monster group. Project Itoh's Genocidal Organ was also a finalist of Komatsu Sakyō Award contest and published from Hayakawa Shobō in 2007, along with Enjoe's Self-Reference ENGINE. Since then they often appeared together at science fiction conventions and interviews, and collaborated in a few works, until Itoh's death of cancer in 2009. At the press conference after the announcement of Enjoe's Akutagawa Prize in January 2012, he revealed the plan to complete Itoh's unfinished novel Shisha no teikoku. It was published in August 2012, and received the Special Award of Nihon SF Taisho."

  "text" : "Timmie Jean Lindsey was the first person in the world to undergo plastic surgery for breast augmentation by means of silicone implants, in 1962. At the time, she was 29 years old and the divorced mother of six children. Hoping to have a large tattoo removed from her chest, she visited a plastic surgeon at the Jefferson Davis Hospital in Houston. The surgeon, Frank Gerow, was one of a group working on the concept of breast implants, and was looking for patients to volunteer for the surgery. She told them she was more interested in having them work on her ears, and the surgeons agreed to do that procedure as well. The procedure went forward under the direction of Gerow and his colleague Thomas Cronin, and was deemed a success at the time. Lindsey kept fairly quiet about her breast enlargement for many years - one boyfriend never knew for example. It was only decades later that she told many of her friends and family about it. Fifty years later, Lindsey still had her original implants and reported general satisfaction with the procedure, despite pains and other concerns over the years. She never joined the groups of women (including several of her own relatives) who filed lawsuits about health problems associated with the implants, although she reported having experienced many of those problems."

  "text" : "Tamara Brooks (September 11, 1941 – May 19, 2012) was an American choral conductor. Brooks studied at the Juilliard School of Music, where she received degrees in piano (studying under Eduard Steuermann) and in conducting. She went on to have an extremely varied career, of which choral conducting was merely a part. Brooks conducted concerts in many countries throughout the world (Austria, Cyprus, Denmark, England, France, Germany, Greece, the Netherlands, Israel, Italy, Japan, Poland, Russia, Taiwan, Turkey, Wales). Her positions included principal guest conductor of the Istanbul Symphony, conductor of the Cyprus Broadcast Orchestra, and guest conductor of the Mozarteum Orchestra in Salzburg. She also prepared choruses for such conductors as Abbado, Frühbeck de Burgos, Giulini, Leinsdorf, Mehta, Muti, Ormandy, Rostropovich, Rozhdestvensky, Tennstedt, and Tilson-Thomas. Brooks was a champion of contemporary music, commissioning and/or performing works by composers such as Adams, Cage, Caltabiano, Cogan, Druckman, Escot, Golijov, Earl Kim, Liang, Ligeti, Lutoslawski, Navok, Persichetti, Schuller, Sessions, Sur, Takemitsu, and Tippett. Prior to her arrival in Boston, Brooks was the Music Director of the Mendelssohn Club of Philadelphia for eleven years. With this ensemble she made a Grammy-nominated recording of choral works of Vincent Persichetti, who was a mentor and close personal friend. Brooks was director of choral activities at New England Conservatory from 1989 to 2000. During that time she led many highly praised performances, in particular a 1992 Verdi Requiem that received a glowing review in the Boston Globe, surpassing the reception to the Boston Symphony Orchestra's performance of the Requiem that same year. In addition to New England Conservatory, Brooks held numerous other important academic positions. In 1998, Hankus Netsky invited Brooks to take part in a PBS television program entitled Taste of Passover. It was there that she met Theodore Bikel. Ten years later she married Bikel, with whom she toured the world in acclaimed concerts of folk music. Netsky wrote: \"Tamara was incredibly dynamic, charismatic, energetic, a vortex of passion, love, and talent. When she got excited about something, there was no stopping her. And she got excited about a lot of things. When that happened, she was 100% there and never imagined that her students or others might not be as excited about a project as she was.\" Brooks died suddenly of a heart attack in Houston on May 19, 2012."

  "text" : "Thomas Bridges (ca. 1842–1898) was an Anglican missionary and linguist, the first to set up a successful mission to the indigenous peoples in Tierra del Fuego, Argentina. Adopted and raised in England by George Pakenham Despard, he accompanied his father to Argentina with the Patagonian Missionary Society. After an attack by indigenous people, in 1869 Despard left the mission at Keppel Island to return with his family to England. At the age of 17, Bridges stayed with the mission as its new superintendent. In the late 1860s, he worked to set up a mission at what is now the town of Ushuaia. Ordained and married during a trip to Great Britain in 1868-1869, Bridges returned to the Falkland Islands with his wife. They settled at the mission at Ushaia, where four of their six children were born. He continued to work with the Selk'nam (Ona) and Yaghan peoples for nearly 20 more years. On Bridges' retirement from missionary service in 1886, the Argentine government gave him a large grant of land. He became a sheep and cattle rancher. As a young man, Bridges had learned the indigenous language of Yamana and closely studied the culture over his lifetime. Over more than a decade, he compiled a grammar and dictionary in Yamana-English of more than 30,000 words. His son Lucas Bridges donated the work to the British Library of London in 1930. Part of the dictionary was published in 1933, then consisting only of the Yamana-English portion. That was edited and published commercially in 1987, since reprinted in 2011. An English-Yamana manuscript, dated 1865, was discovered in the British Library by Alfredo Prieto. The two portions have been published together online at the Patagonian Bookshelf website to provide free access."

He was a fluent Irish speaker, having learned the language from his parents. Captain Francis O'Neill included a photograph of him in his book of 1913, and remarked of him: One of the pleasant surprises which conduced to render the Oireachtas of 1912 particularly interesting and enjoyable, was the introduction of Thomas Garoghan, the London piper, to a Dublin audience. He played on a full set of boxwood pipes, and according to one account, the performance was “splendid and refined, but the tone of his instrument was too weak to be effective in a large concert hall.” He did not have his pipes with him at the little assembly at Groome’s hotel, but on the stage of the Rotunda each evening his music was much admired, and by uttering intelligibly on the chanter, “Polly put the kettle on,” the unique trick aroused the audience to enthusiasm."

  "text" : "Terence Richard \"Terry\" Cooper (born 20 December 1969) is an English author, illustrator, actor, artist and rapper. He is best known for his sci-fi comedy novel series Kangazang!. In the early 1990s he performed as 'Rapster Tee' in Welsh rap group \"Best Shot\" (initially known as 'Best Shot Posse'). They had a brief spell of success in the UK charts with their first two singles, 'Bring On The Sunshine' and 'United Colours' reaching numbers 91 and 64 respectively, before breaking up in 1995. Terry worked on the Doctor Who spin-off film Cyberon by BBV Productions. He designed the look of the Cyberons and had a small cameo in a post credits scene. Terry was a member of the 'Save the Lars Homestead' international team who traveled to Tunisia in May 2012 to restore the iconic 'Igloo' set that had fallen into disrepair."

  "text" : "Colonel Taliaferro Preston Shaffner (1811 in Smithfield, Virginia – December 11, 1881 in Troy, New York) was an American inventor and entrepreneur who promoted telegraphy during its infancy. An associate of Samuel Morse, Shaffner published Shaffner's Telegraph Companion, a monthly journal devoted to Morse's telegraphy, from 1854–1855. The Companion published articles on the history, theory, and practice of telegraphy, as well as United States Supreme Court opinions regarding Morse's patent disputes over the telegraph and Morse's own legal deposition regarding his claim to priority. In 1851, Shaffner built a telegraph line from St. Louis, Missouri to Jefferson City. Later, he organized the North Atlantic Telegraph Company, which projected building a line from Labrador to England through Greenland, Iceland, and the Faroe Islands. An advantage of Shaffner's proposal was that none of its segments extended below water for more than 800 miles. The British government took some interest in the project, but doubts about the long cable's feasibility undermined its funding, and the line was never built. Shaffner was chiefly self-taught. He studied law and was admitted to the bar, but mainly pursued inventing. Shaffner invented several methods of blasting with nitroglycerine and other high explosives, for which he received twelve patents. In 1864, he served Denmark in the Second Schleswig War. He wrote histories of the United States Civil War and was active in the Independent Order of Odd Fellows."

  "text" : "Thomas Weh Syen (died August 1981) was a Liberian soldier and politician. He was a leading member of the group of enlisted men that overthrow the country's government in an April 1980 military coup d'état, and accordingly he became one of the leaders of the new military junta, the People's Redemption Council. In the wake of the coup d'état, he took the title of major general in the Armed Forces of Liberia and became the co-chairman of the PRC; as a result, he was the immediate deputy of Commander-in-Chief Samuel Doe and the Vice Head of State. From the earliest days of the PRC, Doe and Syen clashed; testimony before the Truth and Reconciliation Commission in 2008 revealed that their disagreements began during the coup itself, when Weh Syen and Doe forcibly disagreed about the disposal of money that had been stolen from the home of the newly murdered President William R. Tolbert, Jr. While a member of the PRC, he was partly responsible for educational affairs, but his time on the Council was short-lived. After allegedly attempting to overthrow Doe in a second coup, five PRC members, including Weh Syen, were shot in August 1981 on Doe's orders. Weh Syen was tried in a court-martial at the Temple of Justice in Monrovia. He was replaced as Vice Head of State by PRC Speaker J. Nicholas Podier. He was the father of a son, Thomas Weh Syen, Jr., who died soon after his father — on 24 December 1981, the 5½-year-old boy was hit by a car while he was crossing a street near his home."

Morde began his career as a radio announcer before getting into journalism. In 1940, he was hired to lead an expedition to search for the \"Lost City of the Monkey God\" in Honduras. After five months, he claimed to have found the city and brought thousands of artifacts back to the United States to prove it. He promised to return soon for a proper excavation, but never did, nor did he reveal the precise location of his find. Morde spent the later years of his life as a diplomat, then a producer of news films. He took his own life in 1954. In 2013, Christopher S. Stewart wrote a book about Morde and his hunt for a legendary \"lost city\" that some have equated with la Ciudad Blanca."

  "text" : "Tiziano Crudeli (Italian pronunciation: [titˈtsjaːno kruˈdɛːli]; born 24 June 1943 in Forli), is an Italian television presenter and sports journalist.Until the age of 30, Crudeli worked as a sales representative, but quit to take on the role as secretary at the Milan Regional Committee of the Italian Tennis Federation, eventually moving on to press secretary. In terms of journalism, Crudeli became the editor of Italian tennis magazine \"Tennis Lombard\", before branching into television broadcasting with television channels TVCI and TV Globo. Following this, Tiziano moved away from tennis when given the chance to commentate football games for a radio station, his first game coming in 1987, with Milan beating Pescara 2-0. Written work for newspapers followed, before he became more widely known for his heated debates with Inter Milan fan Elio Corno on the talk show 7 Gold in Diretta Stadio, hosted by Giovanna Martini. He used this as a springboard to work on other television broadcasts, most notably for the actual AC Milan channel on Sky Italy, while he frequently writes columns for the sport’s weekly publication Sprint & Sport Lombardia. Crudeli is a lifelong AC Milan fan, where he is also currently a press officer. Because of his passionate, enthusiastic and unique football commentary, Crudeli has become something of a celebrity in Italy, and has since 2011 become the face of an English television advertising campaign for Ladbrokes."

  "text" : "Thaddeus Davids (Nov. 16, 1810, Bedford, New York - July 22, 1894, New Rochelle, New York) was a 19th-century New York businessman who, in partnership with his brothers, built one of the largest ink companies in the world at the time. The Davids family moved to New York City when Thaddeus was thirteen years old. There he entered the employ of an ink manufacturer who, when he died, left the company to Thaddeus, however, because he was still a minor, the business had to be listed in his father’s name, William Davids. During this early period he failed to receive payment for a government contract and gave up the business, going to sea for a short time. Upon returning, he entered the business again and prospered with his manufacture of quality ink. An 1829/30 New York Directory listing still had William Davids, Chemist, in the listing. Thaddeus would have become of legal age in 1831. Davids’ introduction of steel pen ink in 1827 was his best product at the time and was guaranteed to write black and be of \"record\" quality. By 1833, Davids was making ink similar to English inks, which he called \"chemical writing fluid\", and added indigo for more color. Davids continued with more innovative and improved inks in the following years, and his inks became as good as, or better than, any on the market. In 1856, an experiment by a well known chemist listed his as the least fading ink on the market when compared with such names as \"Maynard & Noyes\", \"Harrison’s Columbian\" and \"Blackwood’s\". This was an important factor for businesses and government. These results were copied and used on bottle labels and trade cards handed out by the company at the 1876 Centennial in Philadelphia. By the late 1830s, Davids was prosperous enough that he wanted to buy a country place in New Rochelle, New York, a short distance from New York City. Leaving the business in the hands of his partner, he took some time negotiating for the New Rochelle property. When he returned to the city, he found out his partner had somehow managed to sell the business and ruin him. Instead of being wealthy, Davids was $700 in debt, but with hard work, he entered the business again for himself at 112 John Street in 1840. Davids intended to move the company to New Rochelle in 1854 however the old mill being renovated for the ink factory burned. This mill had been used for making sealing wax and wafers. An 1888 article in a N.Y. magazine said they still maintained two factories in New Rochelle. Mostly likely this was the John B. Davids Company and a factory for the production of wax, wafers and miscellaneous products. After moving back to New York City, manufacturing plants and offices were at 127 and 129 William Street. At the William Street factory, they made thirty-three different inks as well as other products. The steel pen ink was still being made from the original formula at least through the early 1900s. In 1856 a son, George W. Davids, was admitted as a partner, and the company became known as Thaddeus Davids and Company. The company continued to grow and prosper under Thaddeus and his sons. But in 1883, he was ruined again, this time by his son George, a senior partner and financial manager of the company. George, unbeknown to his father, had incurred debts far more than the assets of the company using the company as collateral. When these debts became known and due in early 1883, the company couldn’t pay them. In April of that year, the New York Times reported the apparent suicide of George W. Davids in a New York City hotel from an overdose of laudanum. Thaddeus, being the honorable man he was known to be, sold everything he owned, including his New Rochelle properties, to pay off creditors. The company went into a receivership with another son and junior partner, David, at the helm. It was reorganized as a stock company, and the business continued. Thaddeus suffered a stroke soon after this from which he never fully recovered. The last decade of his life was spent suffering from gout and the effects of the stroke. Under David F. Davids the company again prospered. He and his brother Edwin took the company into the 20th century. With David’s death in 1905, and Edwin’s in 1907, other family members took over. In 1908 the company moved to Vandam Street. The Vandam factory made use of electricity and was completely up to date in the manufacturing process. Machines powered by electric motors did work previously done by hand. Besides the ink business, Davids purchased a lot of real estate which enhanced his fortune. He bought several properties, which he divided up into house lots in New Rochelle where he eventually made his home. Perhaps his best known land purchase was an island just off the shoreline of New Rochelle with intentions of moving his ink factory there that became known as Davids' Island. Instead he leased (and later sold) it to someone else, who leased it to and later sold it to the U.S. Government who used it as Fort Slocum. During the Civil War, this island was used to hold Confederate prisoners. DeCamp Hospital was established to house wounded soldiers from both sides. His New Rochelle estate, \"Echo Place\", was sold to George W. Sutton in 1884, and was later developed by Sutton's Heirs into the upscale residential enclave Sutton Manor. The last six years of his life, he was confined to his room, unable to walk, although his mind was unimpaired until the last. His problems with gout were severe. He is quoted in many ads for the St. Jacobs Oil Company as saying this oil healed his gout. Apparently it didn’t, as that was a major health problem until the end of his life, so most likely he was paid for this endorsement. As many old obituaries do, his last words were noted, his being \"Home, Sweet Home.\" Thaddeus Davids died at his New Rochelle home on July 22, 1894. He was buried in Beechwoods Cemetery in New Rochelle, New York."

He is first heard of as a clerk in the Royal Chancery about 1360. He was presented to the living of Polebrook in Northamptonshire in 1361. In 1369 he accompanied William de Windsor, the new Lord Lieutenant to Ireland; he became Master of the Rolls in 1372 and a prebendary of St Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin. Otway-Ruthven describes him in 1374 as Clerk to the Irish Privy Council, one of the first men to have held this office. He returned to England about 1375 and was briefly Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster. He is thought to have died in 1382."

In 1876 he became director of the Academisch Penningkabinet in Leiden. In 1881 he resigned when that cabinet was absorbed into the Royal cabinet of medals (which today is part of the nl:Geldmuseum in Utrecht). Through the efforts of the archivist of the city of Haarlem Adriaan Justus Enschedé, Roest was hired to catalog the collection of the Teylers Museum. Enschedé had been a member Teylers Tweede Genootschap since 1876 and was a coin collector himself. In 1886 Roest was named conservator, and in 1889 he published his \"Catalogue du cabinet numismatique de la Fondation Teyler à Harlem\". In 1893 he published the work \"De munten van het Graafschap en Hertogdom GELRE\" (Coins of Gelre, or the Gelderse Mint), and later he left his collection of Gelderse coins to the museum. In 1892 Roest was founder and first chairman of the coin society Koninklijk Nederlands Genootschap voor Munt- en Penningkunde."

  "text" : "Thomas Brown Holmes Stenhouse (21 February 1825 – 7 March 1882) was an early Mormon pioneer and missionary who later became a Godbeite and with his wife, Fanny Stenhouse, became a vocal opponent of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). Stenhouse was born in Dalkeith, Scotland. He joined the LDS Church in England in 1845. In 1850, Stenhouse married Fanny Warn and shortly thereafter joined Lorenzo Snow and Joseph Toronto on a mission to Italy; they became the first LDS Church missionaries to preach in that country. Later in the same year, Stenhouse was sent to Switzerland and became the first Mormon missionary to preach there. In 1855, Stenhouse and his wife emigrated to Utah Territory. They settled in Salt Lake City; Stenhouse the editor of the Salt Lake Telegraph, a newspaper that was consistently pro-Mormon. In 1870, Stenhouse was convinced by the writings of William S. Godbe, who criticised LDS Church President Brigham Young on political and religious grounds. The Stenhouses were particularly opposed to the LDS Church's practice of plural marriage. Stenhouse and his wife became part of the \"Godbeites\" and were excommunicated from the LDS Church. As Godbeites, Stenhouse and his wife published several exposés of Mormonism. Stenhouse's most famous work is his 1873 The Rocky Mountain Saints: A Full and Complete History of the Mormons. In 1872, Fanny Stenhouse published \"Tell it All\": The Story of a Life Experience in Mormonism. Stenhouse died in San Francisco, California."

  "text" : "Thomas de Everdon (c.1320–1413) was an Irish cleric and judge, who was a trusted Crown official for several decades. In a career which spanned almost fifty years, he held office as Dean of St. Patrick's Cathedral, Master of the Rolls in Ireland and Deputy to the Lord Chancellor of Ireland. In addition he was an exceptionally hard-working Crown official who was entrusted with a wide variety of civil, military and administrative tasks: in 1386 the King referred to Everdon's \"labours on royal business throughout Ireland\". There are so many references over a period of almost 60 years to his official duties that some have questioned whether all them can be to the same man. His surname suggests that he came from Everdon in Northamptonshire. He is thought to have been the Thomas de Everdon who first appears in the official Irish records in 1343, and was presented with the living of Ardkeen, County Down in 1345, although he must then have been a very young man, since he had almost seventy years still to live. He was a Canon of St. Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin, in 1374 and became its Dean in 1396. His tenure saw a dispute between the Pope and the Crown as to who had the right to appoint the Dean; eventually it was agreed that the Chapter of the Cathedral would choose the Dean. Thomas resigned in 1401 and became prebendary of Clonmethan, County Dublin.. He also held the living of St. Mary's, Kildalkey, County Meath, from which he resigned in 1411. He was Chief Clerk in Chancery in 1473, jointly with Robert Sutton; an order in Council states that the annual fee of £20 should be divided between them. He was joint Master of the Rolls in 1374 and sole Master 1386–1395. He acted briefly as Chief Baron of the Irish Exchequer. He was Keeper of the Great Seal of Ireland in 1374 and acted regularly as Deputy to the Lord Chancellor of Ireland, particularly during the tenure of Thomas Cranley who was frequently unable to act through age, ill health or pressure of business. Ball states that he was spoken of as a possible Treasurer of Ireland in 1406. In addition he was employed by the Crown to carry out numerous administrative tasks: Mason states that they seem to have mainly involved keeping of accounts for the Army, and the hiring of troops. He was appointed, by King Richard II, Royal Commissioner with John Lambard to collect the King's debts in Munster. In 1386 the King authorised him to appoint attorneys to act for him in Meath and Louth, on the ground that he was so heavily employed on royal business throughout Ireland that he could not properly attend to his business in these two counties. He died in 1413. Mason wondered if there might have been two officials of the same name: he doubted when one man could have performed so many varied duties and (given the life expectancy at the time) had a career lasting so many decades. On the other hand Robert Sutton, a contemporary Master of the Rolls, had an equally long and varied career and did not die until 1430."

During the war years, he worked for some months as a gravedigger at the Weißensee Cemetery. He was deported to Auschwitz in June 1943 with his mother who perished in the camp. He stayed in Auschwitz till its evacuation in January 1945, after which he still survived the death march, Gross-Rosen concentration camp and Buchenwald concentration camp before the latter was self-liberated by the inmates in April 1945. Upon liberation he was too weak to leave the camp and proceeded to record camp life in 79 different drawings. After the war, he went to a camp in Switzerland for orphaned shoah survivors, and when his father was located, he was reunited with him in England. In 1950 he emigrated to Israel and settled in Haifa. His experiences are retold in two books and two documentary films. The first book, Youth in Chains, recounting his wartime years, was subsequently republished and translated into six other languages. His second book, recounting his experiences after the war, was published in German. In addition, his drawings have also been published separately and made into a French-language documentary. Today, he lectures about the Shoah at schools in Germany and other countries."

The following year he received his habilitation, subsequently serving as a privat-docent of internal medicine at the University of Leipzig. From 1859 to 1861 he was an associate professor at Leipzig, afterwards relocating to the University of Halle, where he was a full professor of pathology and therapy from 1862 to 1899. At Halle, he was also director of the university medical clinic. A number of his treatises in pathology and physiology were published in the \"Archiv für physiologische Heilkunde\" and \"Verhandlungsberichte des Kongresses fur innere Medizin\".
