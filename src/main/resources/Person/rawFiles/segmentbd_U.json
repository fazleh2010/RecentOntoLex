  "text" : "Katriena |Una Kassie Rooi was one of the last eight speakers of Nuu language, also known as N/uu, n/huki, ‡Khomani, South Africa's last original San language. Ouma |Una Rooi, or Kaitjie as she was affectionately known, was born in 1930 at Tweerivieren (≠aka≠nous), in what is now the Kgalagadi Transfrontier Park which straddles the boundary between South Africa and Botswana. She died on 3 March 2012. |Una was the fourth child of |Khuka and Ari Kassie. |Una, her San name, refers to the soft powder puff, made from the ear of a bat-eared fox. The |una is used to spread buchu powder on new born babies, which is traditionally carried in a purse made from the shell of a geometric tortoise. Aged five, she was taken to Johannesburg as part of the 'Bushman' display at the British Empire Exhibition. at this time she was separated from her parents and raised by her grandparents. ‡Han Kassie, her grandfather, featured prominently in the photographs of the Empire Exhibition. Her time with her grandparents helped deepen her knowledge of traditional mythology and beliefs of the N||‡e culture and language which were in the process of dying out. She later travelled to Durban and Cape Town. Her people lost their land and all their possessions in 1937 and lived for decades in poverty and obscurity. Sociolinguist Nigel Crawhall met Rooi in the township of Swartkop, outside Upington in the Northern Cape in 1997. He records that \"she and her sisters provided key evidence to help the ≠Khomani (N||n≠e) people regain a small portion of their land through a land claim.\". Rooi provided important information on sites within the Kgalagadi Transfrontier Park, including the names of rivers, pans and gravesites that provided evidence of original occupation. The N|uu language had been documented as early as 1896 by missionary Heinrich Pabst, 1910 by Austrian philologist Rudolf Pöch, and 1912 by Dorothea Bleek. Crawhall also recalls that: \"When the ≠Khomani people made their first book about their culture and heritage, Enter the Light, we asked Ouma |Una to give the book a title that summarised their experience of freedom, oppression, dispossession, violence, poverty, democracy and restitution. Ouma |Una was not one to nurse a grudge, her heart always sought peace and reconciliation. She called the book after a N/uu saying: i hunike xu a ||ga, i ke hunike |'e a q!uruke (We all came out of that darkness, and we together enter into the light).\" On language death, Rooi observed: \"If a person who speaks our language dies then our language also dies. When you cover him with sand the language is not like a plant that grows again.\""

  "text" : "Umberto Barulli (1921 – 1993) was a Sammarinese politician. A leader of the Sammarinese Communist Party, Barulli served as head of state of San Marino in 1988. Prior to his political career, Barulli worked at the Ansaldo factory in Genoa, Italy. Barulli was the general secretary of the Sammarinese Communist Party between 1973 and 1984. Prior to his appointment as party general secretary, he served as deputy general secretary. As a leader of the Communist Party Barulli adovacted Sammarinese economy self-dependency, arguing that dependency on tourism would be reduced whilst industries and agricultural sectors would be developed. In a 1978 interview, he said that San Marino ought to stop 'living as a parasite on Italy'. Barulli represented the Sammarinese Communist Party at different international events. He represented the Sammarinese communists as a guest of honour at the tenth anniversary jubilee celebrations of the People's Republic of China in 1959. Barulli visited the 25th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in 1976, and gave a speech at the event. During a visit to the Soviet Union in January 1983, Barulli and the Sammarinese Communist Party chairman Ermenegildo Gasperoni were decorded with the Order of Friendship of Peoples at a ceremony in the Kremlin. Barulli served as one of the two Captains Regent (i.e. the head of state of San Marino) for one term between April and September 1988, along with Rosolino Martelli. At the time the country was governed by a coalition between the Communist Party and the Christian Democrats."

Sagayam, whose office door bears a sign reading \"Reject bribes, hold your head high\" (in Tamil, Lanjam thavirtthu,nenjam nimirtthu; லஞ்சம் தவிர்த்து நெஞ்சம் நிமிர்த்து), has repeatedly antagonized influential politicians and their supporters in Tamil Nadu. In 2011, he was appointed to oversee state elections in the Madurai district; his strict enforcement of the laws against vote-buying played a role in the change of state government. Beginning in 2012, his investigation of complaints of illegal granite-mining in the Madurai area led to charges against a number of politicians and businesses, including a mining company founded by a scion of one of Madurai's most influential political families. Sagayam's efforts to eliminate corruption have led to his being transferred over 20 times in his two decades of public service. They have also won him a reputation for probity; in the words of a DNA correspondent, \"[T]he common man's collector has become the hero of the local folklore\"."

He has been responsible for all articles on psychiatry and psychology in the encyclopedia Store norske leksikon. In 2012, he testified as an expert witness in the trial of Anders Behring Breivik. According to Malt, Breivik suffers from Asperger syndrome, possibly Tourette syndrome and narcissistic personality disorder. He could not with 100% confidence rule out paranoid psychosis (delusional disorder) although he found it less than 50% likely. The conclusionAsperger syndrome was rebutted by Eirik Johannesen., but supported by child psychiatrist Per Olav Næss who treated Breivik when he was admitted to child psychiatric care 3–4 years of age."
