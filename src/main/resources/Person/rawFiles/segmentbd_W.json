  "text" : "Harry \"Ward\" Ritchie (Los Angeles, California June 15, 1905 - Laguna Beach, California January 24, 1996) was an American printer, book designer, book-collector and writer of around 100 books. He was part of the \"Golden Age\" of fine printing that took place during the 1920s and 1930s in Southern California. Ritchie was also part of the Artists of the Arroyo Seco community. Ritchie grew up in South Pasadena and attended the Marengo Avenue School, South Pasadena High School, and graduated in 1928 from Occidental College in Northeast Los Angeles. After a brief stint in law school at USC, Ritchie turned his attention to printing, his true passion. He enrolled at Frank Wiggins Trade School (now Los Angeles Trade-Technical College). In 1930, Ritchie apprenticed in Paris with the renowned printer François Louis-Schmied. Returning to South Pasadena, Ritchie co-founded, along with fellow printer Grant Dahlstrom and bookseller Jacob \"Jake\" Zeitlin, the Rounce & Coffin Club. This club was created as a less formal alternative to the Zamorano Club, where other bibliophiles gathered in Los Angeles. The following year, he established the Ward Ritchie Press, through which he published thousands of books, over 750 designed by himself; his output included works by poets Robinson Jeffers, Carl Sandburg, Archibald MacLeish, Carlyle MacIntyre, librarian Lawrence Clark Powell, novelist Alexandre Dumas, and many others. In 1983, Ritchie became romantically involved with film actress Gloria Stuart, who was inspired by him to design her own hand-printed books under the imprimatur Imprenta Glorias. Ritchie maintained a close relationship with Stuart until his death. Ritchie died of pancreatic cancer in Laguna Beach, California on January 24, 1996."

  "text" : "Walter St. Lawrence (c.1445-1504) was an Anglo-Irish nobleman, lawyer  and judge. He held the offices of Attorney General for Ireland and Chief Baron of the Irish Exchequer. He was one of the younger sons of Christopher St Lawrence, 2nd Baron Howth and Anne Plunket. His eldest brother Robert St Lawrence, 3rd Baron Howth was born before 1435; if, as Elrington Ball, suggests Walter was the youngest of his parents' six sons this would suggest a birthdate around 1445. His father had been a committed supporter of the House of York and had been rewarded for his loyal services to the dynasty by Edward IV, but Walter's eldest brother Robert married Joan Beaufort, a cousin of the future Henry VII, and after the accession of the Tudors the St Lawrence family were reliable supporters of the new dynasty. Walter's nephew Nicholas St Lawrence, 4th Baron Howth was one of the few among the Anglo-Irish nobility who did not support the claims of the pretender Lambert Simnel to be the rightful King of England, and after the defeat of Simnel's cause at the Battle of Stoke in 1487, the family's rewards included Walter's appointment as Attorney General in 1491. At the second landing of Perkin Warbeck, another pretender to the Crown, in Ireland in 1495, Walter played an active part in the defence of Dublin. Again he received his reward: Ball suggests that his appointment as Chief Baron of the Exchequer the followings year was a personal choice by the King. He held that office until his death in 1504."

  "text" : "William Wentworth (1616-1697) was a follower of John Wheelwright, and an early settler of New Hampshire. Coming from Alford in Lincolnshire, he likely came to New England with Wheelwright in 1636, but no records are found of him in Boston. When Wheelwright was banished from the Massachusetts Bay Colony for his role in the Antinomian Controversy, he established the settlement of Exeter, New Hampshire, and Wentworth followed him there and then to Wells, Maine. After Wheelwright left Wells for Hampton, New Hampshire, Wentworth went to Dover, New Hampshire, and this is where he lived the remainder of his life. He was the proprietor of a sawmill, and held several town offices, but is most noted for being an elder in his Dover church for nearly 40 years. He had 11 children with two wives, and has numerous descendants, including many of great prominence."

Kimball was born in Mendon, New York. He earned his place in Mormon pioneer history for his bravery and gallantry in defending his family and the Latter-day Saints. Kimball served as a general in the Utah Militia and led his men in the Indian wars and handcart pioneer rescue. As one of \"Brigham's Boys\", he was on call to serve whenever and wherever Brigham Young and the other Mormon leaders needed minutemen to protect the pioneers. Kimball settled in Parley's Park, where his stage station and hotel gained notoriety with travelers, including Mark Twain. Like many early Latter-day Saints, Kimball practiced plural marriage and had five wives and twenty-five children. (He was eventually divorced from two of his wives.) His house and barn stand to this day at Kimball's Junction near Park City, Utah. Kimball was a missionary for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in England from 1854 to 1857. Kimball died in Coalville, Utah."

  "text" : "Wallace Eddinger (July 14, 1881 - January 8, 1929) was an American stage actor. He started as a child actor, known as Wally Eddinger. As a child he played Cedric in Little Lord Fauntleroy which starred female child sensation Elsie Leslie. Eddinger appeared in only two silent films, The Great Diamond Robbery and A Gentleman of Leisure, in 1914 and 1915 respectively, preferring the stage. The latter film still survives. Eddinger was married twice. The first marriage was to Ivy Lee Moore-La Grove from 1912 to 1920 and the second was to popular stage actress Margaret Lawrence (1889-1929) from 1924 to his death. Lawrence had been previously married to a publisher named Orson Munn with whom she had two daughters. Six months after Eddinger's death, Margaret Lawrence was murdered in New York City by her lover, actor Louis Bennison, after a drunken lover's quarrel. Bennison then took his own life in what was deemed a murder suicide."

  "text" : "William John Bates van de Weyer (1870–1946) was a major in the British Army who won more lasting fame in horticulture as the first to hybridize a South American species of Buddleja with an Asiatic species while on leave during World War I. Working in the nursery of his home, Smedmore House, Corfe Castle, he crossed B. globosa with B. davidii, naming the new hybrid Buddleja weyeriana. The initial F1 progeny were aesthetically poor, but Weyer persevered, back-crossing them to produce more strongly coloured F2 plants from which he made two selections he named 'Moonlight' and 'Golden Glow', which remain in commerce to this day. Over half a century later, 'Sungold' was raised from a sport of 'Golden Glow' in the Netherlands, and was used in hybridization experiments in the USA, leading to the release of small, sterile Buddlejas such as 'Blue Chip'. Weyer also hybridized B. globosa with B. madagascariensis circa 1920 and, several years later, B. globosa with B. brasiliensis, though neither appears to have had much horticultural merit and no cultivars are known."

He attended state primary schools before studying at Grote Street Training College in 1894 and at Melbourne Training College in 1907; he also studied part-time at the University of Adelaide (1909–15), although he never graduated. He married Mabel Edith Dyer on 17 December 1910; she died in 1915 and Adey would remarry fellow teacher Constance Margaret Weston on 7 May 1921 at Walkerville. He worked as a primary school teacher from 1895 to 1909 in various schools. In 1909 Adey was appointed inaugural headmaster of Adelaide High School, a position he held until 1919. He was inspector of high schools from 1919 to 1920 before becoming superintendent of secondary education. In 1929 he became director of education, although he was the second choice and was instructed to limit himself to following his predecessor's plan; not a reformer, he followed this directive, but his administrative and teaching ability was widely admired. He attracted greatest attention for his role in the 1931 committee of inquiry, in which he dissented from his colleagues in opposing higher school fees and more limited high school admission. He was unable to prevent the introduction of school fees altogether but attempted to offset the social inequality they caused. He remained director of education until his retirement in 1939. Adey served on the council of the University of Adelaide from 1929 to 1950 and chaired a 1939 government committee inquiring into delinquent children and state wards. He was appointed Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George in 1935. Adey died at Burnside in 1956 and was buried at North Road Cemetery in Nailsworth."

He was President of Horrockses Crewdson and Co., a Preston, Lancashire, firm of cotton manufacturers and pattern makers. When he died he was living at Bilsborough Hall, near Preston. His father was George Galloway, also of Preston. In his will he left an estate of over £570,000 nett, and gave specific legacies of £10,000 to establish a \"William Galloway Employees Benefits fund\" for employees of Horrockses and their dependents; £10,000 to the Preston and Lancashire Queen Victoria Royal Infirmary, £10,000 for \"a Galloway charity for the poor and needy of Preston\", several smaller charitable donations and the residue of his estate after other legacies \"for such charitable institutions within five miles of Preston as his trustees may select\". The Galloway's Society for the Blind (formerly the Preston and North Lancashire Blind Welfare Society) received £10,000 from his estate for the purchase of a building, Howick House, which became the \"Galloway Home for the Blind\" and is still the society's headquarters. The society renamed itself in 2000 to avoid its cumbersome former name and honour its greatest benefactor. Other local institutions which carry his name include the William Wilding Galloway Hall in Preston, the William Wilding Galloway Fund for the Provision of a Church Worker (a charity with the objects: \"To engage and employ some suitable person or persons to minister to the needs of poor persons resident in the Borough of Preston\", registered charity no. 250914) and the T.S.

  "text" : "William de Vesci, sometimes spelt Vescy, was a prominent 13th-century noble. He was a son of William de Vesci and Agnes de Ferrers, daughter of William de Ferrers, 5th Earl of Derby, andSibyl Marshal. William died in 1297. He founded the Grey Abbey in Kildare, Ireland for the Franciscans in 1260. During the Second Barons' War campaign of 1265, William held Gloucester Castle against Prince Edward. He was pardoned afterwards and entered the service of King Henry III of England. He served against the Welsh in 1277 and later in 1282. He was appointed the justice of the forests north of the Trent in 1285. Upon the death of his brother John de Vesci in 1289, William succeeded to the family estates. He was also granted the Constable of Scarborough Castle between 1289 until 1292. William was sent with Antony Bek, Bishop of Durham in 1289 to represent King Edward I of England in Scotland. He also founded White Abbey, near Kildare, Ireland for the Carmelites in 1290. Upon the death of Margaret, Maid of Norway in 1290, William became one of the competitors for the Crown of Scotland, deriving his claim from his grandmother, Margaret, illegitimate daughter of William the Lion the wife of Eustace fitz John. William's claim was withdrawn on the eve of the King Edward I of England announced which of the claimants would inherit the throne in 1292. With the death of his mother, Agnes on 11 May 1290, he inherited large estates in Ireland, including the franchise of the County Kildare with Kildare Castle and Rathangan Castle. On 12 September 1290, William was appointed Lord Justices in Ireland by King Edward I of England. His service was interrupted by complaints with William entering the king's court in 1293 and 1294 to answer charges against him. Sir John FitzThomas, 4th Lord Offaly, fiercely quarrelled with William over rival claimants of the King of Connaught. FitzThomas made claims to King Edward I of England that William had accused the king of cowardice during the siege of Kenilworth Castle in 1266, and was organising a rebellion against the king. William lost his position of Lord Justices. William attempted to sue FitzThomas for defamation before the council at Dublin. King Edward I summoned all the parties to Westminster, however, FitzThomas did not appear, and although William requested for a judgment in his favour by reason of the default, this was not allowed, with the matter finally being resolved during the parliament in August 1295. While he regained the kings favour, William did not retain his position of Lord Justices in Ireland, however was restored to his former position as justiciar of the forests beyond Trent. He was sent to Gascony in December 1295 on the king's service. William surrendered his lands of Kildare in 1297 on condition of his and his brother's debts to the exchequer being forgiven. Edward I regranted his lands in Kildare for life only. William also resigned Malton Castle and his Yorkshire estates to Antony Bek, Bishop of Durham, however he received them back for life and entailed after his death on his illegitimate son and his heirs. He also placed in charge of Alnwick Castle to Antony Bek, Bishop of Durham on trust, to restore it to his illegitimate son when he became of age. Soon afterwards William died in 1297."

In 1300, William was summoned to serve in an army against the Scots. He or his guardian Antony Bek, Prince Bishop of Durham, sold Alnwick Castle on 19 November 1309 to Henry de Percy, 1st Baron Percy. (For more details, see the entry on Lord Percy). It is unclear how much of the money William actually received. On 24 June 1314, while serving as a retainer of Aymer de Valence, Earl of Pembroke, William perished at the Battle of Bannockburn."

He was assigned as a Second Lieutenant with the U.S. 2d Cavalry Regiment, to which he belonged for the remainder of his short career. He joined the staff of General George Crook at the end of August, 1876, when Crook rejoined the columns of General Alfred Terry and Colonel John Gibbon after the Battles of the Rosebud and the Little Bighorn during the Great Sioux War of 1876. Clark was thus present for Crook's pursuit of the Lakota during the late summer and fall of 1876, including the so-called \"Starvation March\" and the Battle of Slim Buttes. He served in a number of staff assignments for General Philip Sheridan and died suddenly at the age of 39, in Washington, DC in 1884 while on special duty with Sheridan. He was the author of the 1885 book The Indian Sign Language (published posthumously), to this day the definitive and comprehensive primary source on the rich sign language of The Great Plains tribes. He died young, not fulfilling what was generally agreed to be his extraordinary potential as an enlightened army officer, as conceived at the time."

  "text" : "Wilhelm Baum (10 September 1799 - 6 September 1883) was a German surgeon born in Elbing. He studied medicine in Königsberg, Göttingen and Berlin, receiving his doctorate in 1822. At the University of Göttingen, he was influenced by Konrad Martin Langenbeck (1776–1855), Karl Gustav Himly (1772–1837) and Friedrich Benjamin Osiander (1759–1822). After graduation, he spent a year as a surgical assistant to Karl Ferdinand von Graefe (1787–1850) in Berlin, followed by several years of study in Austria, Italy, France and the British Isles (London, Edinburgh, Dublin). In Paris he attended lectures and clinics by Guillaume Dupuytren (1777–1835), Dominique Jean Larrey (1766–1842) and Jean Cruveilhier (1791–1874). During his years of travel, he pursued artistic interests in addition to furthering his studies in medicine. In 1827 he returned to Berlin as a general practitioner, occasionally assisting his close friend Johann Friedrich Dieffenbach (1792–1847) with surgical operations. Afterwards he relocated to Danzig as chief surgeon at the municipal hospital. In Danzig he greatly distinguished himself during the cholera epidemic of 1831. In 1841 he undertook a research trip to Paris, where he studied lithotripsy with Jean Civiale (1792–1867) and Jean-Jacques-Joseph Leroy d'Etiolles (1798–1860), afterwards becoming a professor of surgery at the University of Greifswald (1842). Later in his career he was appointed professor of surgery at the University of Göttingen. Baum was an important influence to the career of Theodor Billroth (1829–1894). Although considered a good teacher, he was not known for his writings. He was one of the first surgeons in Germany to perform tracheotomies for treatment of croup (1848 at Greifswald, five cases). He is also credited for providing an early mention of human pulmonary aspergillosis."

  "text" : "William Henry Archibald Constable (8 March 1906 – 22 August 1989) was a leading Australian film and stage designer, painter, cartoonist, printmaker and illustrator. Born in Bendigo, Constable was raised with two younger brothers in the family of the Reverend Archibald Henry Constable, rector of St. John's Church of England. He received training in water color painting from Meta Townsend and was originally an apprentice electrician at the Jolimont Workshops. In 1926 he was laid off from the position and began study at the National Gallery of Victoria School and the Saint Martin's School of Art in London, where he was involved with the most advanced experimental theatres in England set his passion for life. On his return to Australia in 1930s, Constable worked on several commercial design projects, and was noticed after his very first theatrical commission in 1933: the cubist stage decorations for the Gregan McMahon Players’ production of Bridie's Jonah and the Whale at the Garrick in South Melbourne. The play was directed by Alec Coppel. The press claimed that the \"production will be notable for the unusual settings by William Constable, a young artist who recently reached Melbourne from abroad … Constable's stage settings are great fun. They are simple and attractive.\" In 1940s Constable illustrated Sir Eugene Goossens’ vision of his \"dream child\" Opera House. The two published an article with the visual proposal to build an Australian National Theatre in the style of a Greek amphitheatre built at Bennelong at Bennelong Point (4) With Constable's departure for Europe and the scandalous conclusion of Goossen's career in Australia, the proposed design was forgotten along with a few others of the time. Constable's artwork is not held in the Opera House archives. The 1950 World Premier of Australian ballet Corroboree with the Rock motif of the backdrop designed by Constable was another highlight of Constable's career. This minimalistic composition accurately translated the desert of Central Australia. He used bold organic shapes, strong details, variation in textures and contrasting colours. The inclusion of a full solar eclipse added drama and mystery, and possibly represented the everlasting life cycle. The highlighted top of the stone is the visual focus of the composition, where a pastel pink sandy foreground is the centre of action during the dance. The fine lines of dried trees, a ritual pole and still sand waves make a statement of human presence and support the greatness of the rock. Constable was production designer and Art Director for Long John Silver, which was shot in Sydney in 1954. The film was produced by Joseph Kaufman at Pagewood Studios and starred Robert Newton. He also worked on the subsequent television series The Adventures of Long John Silver in 1956-1957. Constable and Edouard Borovansky met in the 1940s, beginning a lifelong creative partnership and friendship. As scenic director of the Borovansky Ballet Company for 15 years, Constable was behind most productions as a designer and a painter. Frank Salter described Borovansky and Constable working together \"in total harmony over his [Constable] entire Australian career.\" Constable \"was always fascinated by Boro's method of working with him\" and often was entertained by Boro's comments, such as \"You clever bastard, Bill; you’ve realised exactly what I had in mind\". (2) Constable created almost 160 dramas, operas (16 of these for Sir Eugene Goossens), ballets (mostly for the Borovansky Ballet) and a long list of films with his artistic abilities and impeccable taste as claimed by Sydney Ure. The designer illustrated books and had several commissions for theaters. In 1952 he produced two murals, one for the lower foyer of the Theatre Royal which was partially demolished to clear way for the current ML Center. And another for The Empire Theatre on Quay Street in Sydney in 1953, that was destroyed by a fire in 1970s. The designer departed Australia again in 1955 for England where he produced sets and costumes for the only ballet by Sir Noël Coward London Morning and then dedicated himself to design for cult movies such as Taste of Fear, The Hellions, The Skull, Doctor Who, and Casino Royal. The village built for \"Long Ships\" set has become a tourist attraction in Yugoslavia. His sets and for The Trials of Oscar Wilde has won him Medallion for the Best Art-Direction in Moscow 1960 Film Festival. The production of the film Lord Jim took Constable to Cambodia in 1963 where he extended his stay for a few months to paint. His collection of prints and paintings on Cambodia was exhibited across Australia and in England. Constable returned to Melbourne in 1972 to design and supervise the production of the curtain for the Her Majesty Theatre in Melbourne, which was recently located in Queensland. Paintings of Australia and prints of Great barrier Reef prints produced by Constable in 1970s were extensively exhibited across the country. William Constable was significant in his retaining great traditions of style and perfection that were established by the Ballets Russes and its artists. His legacy in stage decor, his input into Australian theatrical design and according to Frank Van Straten, his \"most important legacy, however, is the generation of Australian theatre makers who admired and loved him, and to whom he passed on his vast knowledge and his deep love of theatre\" (5). 1 Meta Townsend, wife of Reginald Sturgess, Victorian Art Society members, Australian artists, Meta Townsend's family lived in Malmsbury2 Salter, Frank, Borovansky, the man who made Australian ballet, Wild Cat Press, 1980 3 Introduction to Catalogue of Exhibition, Sydney Ure Smith, O.B.E., President, Society of artists 4 Eugene Goossens, How Long Before Our Opera House Dream Comes True?

  "text" : "Ahmad Salim (26 March 1933 – 24 January 1996), better known by his birth name Wim Umboh but also known by the Chinese name Liem Yan Yung, was an Indonesian director who is best known for his melodramatic romances. Born in North Sulawesi, Umboh was orphaned at the age of eight and later adopted by a Chinese-Indonesian doctor. After high school, he moved to Jakarta and found work at Golden Arrow Studios as a janitor and, later, translator. In 1955 he made his screen debut as a director with Dibalik Dinding (Behind the Walls). During his career, which spanned more than forty years, Umboh directed close to fifty movies, which garnered 29 Citra Awards from the Indonesian Film Festival. He was diagnosed with liver cancer in 1978 but, after recovering, he continued to work until his death from complications of diabetes and a stroke. Umboh was married three times and had two children. An authoritarian director who strove for perfection, Umboh was known for experimenting with different technologies and, according to fellow director Teguh Karya, memorised the entire dialogue of his films during shooting. He preferred medium and close-up shots. Umboh influenced numerous Indonesian directors, including Karya, Slamet Rahardjo, Garin Nugroho, and Arifin C. Noer, and his work launched the careers of several Indonesian stars, including Sophan Sophiaan and Roy Marten. Among his most famous works are Pengantin Remadja (Teenage Bride; 1971), Mama (1972), and Pengemis dan Tukang Becak (The Beggar and the Pedicab Driver; 1978), the last of which was Umboh's personal favourite."

  "text" : "Willis Mahoney (June 13, 1895 – June 2, 1968) was an American politician from the states of Oregon and Washington. He was a member of the Washington State Legislature, was mayor of Klamath Falls, Oregon, and three times was a candidate to represent Oregon in the United States Senate, losing to Charles L. McNary in 1936, Rufus Holman in 1938, and Guy Cordon in 1944. Mahoney also supported the Townsend Plan, a proposal presented by Francis Townsend for a national sales tax to pay for a $200 monthly pension for everyone over age 60. Mahoney also supported president Roosevelt's New Deal. A native of Idaho, Mahoney had lived in Oregon for five years before announcing his campaign for U.S. Senate against McNary, but he proved to be an aggressive opponent to the senator, at times asking crowds: \"Has anybody seen from our Senior Senator lately?\" The election was close, but McNary was reelected. One year after his defeat, Mahoney was charged with reckless driving in an incident that killed Thomas L. Zimmerman of Shedd. But he filed for another race for U.S. Senate in 1938, and won the Democratic primary. The reckless driving case seemed to be over by 1938, but it was reopened during the campaign, but did not affect Mahoney's campaign from moving forward, but he lost the race 55–45% to Holman, and was defeated for yet another run for the Senate in 1944, by Guy Cordon. He died in 1968."

Although he sailed to the Gold Coast as an apprentice when he was only 16 years of age, he managed to climb the ranks and eventually became head merchant (Dutch: opperkoopman). In 1702 he sailed back to the Dutch Republic, and little is known of his later life. Bosman is best known for his description of the Gold Coast titled Nauwkeurige beschrijving van de Guinese Goud- Tand- en Slavekust (1703). This document remained the most authoritative description of the area for more than a century and provided significant detail of the Komenda Wars in which Bosman took part. The Ghanaian surname Bossman is thought to originate from the children Willem Bosman had with his black mistresses."

Hailing from Lodwar in Kenya's Turkana District, Loyanae began running in marathon races in his native country in 2010. That year he was sixth at the Kisumu Marathon and seventh at the Kass Marathon. The 2011 running season saw him establish himself as a marathoner of international calibre. He won the Mombasa Marathon in a time of 2:13:00 hours and stated his desire to begin competing on the World Marathon Majors circuit. He ran in his first foreign race in October 2011 at South Korea's Gyeongju International Marathon and he won with a personal best time of 2:09:23 hours. His next outing was again in South Korea, this time at the higher profile Seoul International Marathon, and he managed to continue his winning streak. Beating the more favoured Kenyans, James Kipsang Kwambai and Eliud Kiptanui, he knocked almost four minutes off his best time to set a course record of 2:05:37 hours – a mark which moved him into the top 30 runners of all time. He defended his title in Gyeongju with a course record run of 2:06:46. His first race of 2013 saw him place third in the Houston Half Marathon. Erupe tested positive for EPO in an out-of-competition test in 2012 and was banned from competing for two years in February 2013."

Toward the end of Later Liang's confrontation with its northern archenemy Later Tang, Wang was the only general who was able to achieve any measure of success against Later Tang forces, but then-reigning emperor Zhu Zhen, believing that he was difficult to control, replaced him with Duan Ning, whose overly ambitious counterattack plan allowed Later Tang's Emperor Zhuangzong to slip past him, defeat and capture Wang, and capture the Later Liang capital Daliang.

  "text" : "Wallie Abraham Hurwitz (February 18, 1886 in Joplin, Missouri – January 6, 1958 in Ithaca, New York) was an American mathematician who worked on analysis. Hurwitz graduated from the University of Missouri with a bachelor's degree and then went to Harvard to do graduate work. He won a Sheldon Traveling Fellowship, which enabled him to study at the University of Göttingen, where he earned a doctoral degree under Hilbert in 1910. In 1912 Hurwitz joined the mathematics faculty of Cornell University, where he remained until he died in 1958 at age seventy-one. His doctoral students include R. H. Cameron and Florence M. Mears. Hurwitz's private library contained nearly three thousand books. This private library had many books on cryptography, several of which were borrowed by the U. S. Navy early in WWII because there were no copies of them in the Library of Congress. Hurwitz had an extensive knowledge of music and a large collection of Gilbert and Sullivan scores, reviews, programs, and related memorabilia. He invested brilliantly in the stock market, selling out shortly before the 1929 crash and buying in close to the bottom. Hurwitz left his considerable financial estate to the U. of Missouri, Harvard, and Cornell."

He graduated from Columbia University in 1925 with a degree in journalism and upon graduation went to work at The New York Times in 1926. He went on to become an editor for the New York Times Book Review where he wrote reviews and articles. DuBois retired from The Times in 1973. DuBois wrote a number of Broadway plays including Pagan Lady (1930) and I Loved You Wednesday (1932). DuBois wrote the play Haiti (1938) for the Federal Theatre Project. The play was produced by the Negro Theatre Unit and presented at the Lafayette Theatre in Harlem and toured to Boston. The play's authorship has often been misattributed to the black scholar W. E. B. Du Bois because of the similarity of names. His novels include The Island in the Square (1947), set in New York City in the 1920s; A Season to Beware (1956), about the worlds of journalism and publishing, and The Falcon's Shadow (1958), about the travails of the theater. He also worked as a silent writer with Frank G. Slaughter on 27 of his historical novels."

  "text" : "William Henry Barribal (1874–1952) was a London artist who began his career as a lithographer before going on to study at the Académie Julian in Paris. By the turn of the 20th century, Barribal had become an accomplished painter and designer. He created a series of images that were used on First World War recruitment posters in Great Britain. During the 1920s and 1930s he created a range of posters for the Schweppes advertising campaign and in 1921 he was contracted to work for Waddingtons, producing work that was used for posters and later a series of playing cards, these works being keenly sought after today. His bold Art Deco posters designed in 1920s and 1930s for the London and North Eastern Railway are also well known. His wife, Gertrude Louisa Fannie Pitt, was his principal model and his work also included cigarette cards on which she appeared. Barribal also worked for various magazines, including the leading fashion journal Vogue, and between 1919 and 1938 he regularly exhibited his work. His images of exquisite and fashionable Edwardian women have become classics and the work of many modern fashion artists shows traces of the unmistakable \"Barribal style\"."

  "text" : "William Dickes (1815-1892) was an English illustrator, engraver, printmaker and lithographer. Dickes worked as apprentice to the wood engraver Robert Edward Branston, Allen Robert Branston's son, in about 1831. He studied at the Royal Academy Schools in 1835 and displayed examples of oil-colour printing at the Great Exhibition. He founded William Dickes & Company in London about 1864, his workshop and office being at 48 Salisbury Square, Fleet Street, London (1846–48); 4 Crescent Place, Bridge Street, Blackfriars, London (1849–51); 5 Old Fish Street, Doctor's Common, London (c.1852); 109 Farringdon Road, London (c.1867-1875). Dickes retired in 1873. William Dickes was one of a group of London-based wood engravers who saw in the developing market for illustration a great opportunity to profitably use their technical and artistic skills - the burgeoning book and periodical trade in London created an insatiable demand for images. Dickes assembled a team of wood engravers between 1842 and 1847 to illustrate the Abbotsford edition of Walter Scott's work. Dickes specialised in illustrating books on natural history—such as works by Anne Pratt— and was a licensee of the Baxter Process of printing. His biographer, Alfred Docker, bequeathed 1370 works by Dickes to the British Museum in 1931 and these are kept at Blythe House. Dickes collected many awards for the quality of his lithography. Although starting with wood engraving, he moved to and developed new processes in colour lithography using copper plates. His work was exhibited at International Exhibitions in London, Dublin and Paris in the 1860s. Chromolithography reached its pinnacle toward the end of the 1800s. Colour images were printed using multiple stones, each printing a different colour in a process calling for precise alignment."

Stanley was commissioner for militia for Southampton in March 1660. In April 1660, he was elected Member of Parliament for Southampton in the Convention Parliament. He was commissioner for assessment for Hampshire from August 1660 to 1663 and was mayor of Southampton again from 1661 to 1662.

In 1654, his father conveyed to him the bulk of the estate, worth £1,200 p.a. including the manor of Milborne Port while Milborne was on bad terms with his stepmother and her family. Milborne entered Middle Temple in 1658 in the chambers of his uncle Henry Milborne. He was commissioner for assessment for Monmouthshire in January 1660 and commissioner for militia in March 1660. In April 1660, he was elected Member of Parliament for Milborne Port for the Convention Parliament. Milborne never married and died at the age of about 27 at his uncle's chambers at Middle Temple.

Saunders established a long partnership with the architect William Burges, working with him on many of his major commissions, including Saint Fin Barre's Cathedral, Cardiff Castle, Castell Coch and Burges's Yorkshire churches. David Lawrence and Ann Wilson consider Burges was particularly indebted to Saunders: \"his technique [gave] Burges's glass its most distinctive characteristic, namely the flesh colour. This is unique, had no precedents and has had no imitators.\" Lawrence and Wilson's history of St Fin Barre's has detailed commentaries on the glass there, of which Lawrence writes, \"The impact created by all these glowing, coloured religious images is overwhelming and intoxicating. To enter St Fin Barre's Cathedral is an experience unparalleled in Ireland and rarely matched anywhere.\" In 1880, Saunders handed the company over to his assistant William Worral and retired abroad, \"apparently ceasing all artistic activity, at least in this country (although) he lived for (another) 40 years.\""

  "text" : "William M. Gallagher (February 26, 1923 – September 28, 1975) was an American photographer who won the 1953 Pulitzer Prize for Photography for his photograph of presidential candidate Adlai Stevenson II. Gallagher was a photographer for 27 years with the Flint Journal in Flint, Michigan. Gallagher was born in Hiawatha, Kansas. In 1936 he moved to Flint and graduated from St. Matthew's High School in 1943. During World War II he served in the United States Army in the signal corps, medical corps, and air corps. Gallagher earned his first camera while in high school by selling magazines. He began his professional photography career with the Sporting Digest in Flint in 1946. The following year he moved to the Flint Journal and within a few months became a staff photographer, a position he would hold until his death. Gallagher's colleagues described him as \"a boisterous, flamboyant character\" who had good relationships with local police and government officials. He was fond of pranks, once lighting a cherry bomb inside the police department and watching the officers scramble, while another time he commandeered a police helicopter while covering a story. Gallagher snapped his Pulitzer-winning photo at a Labor Day rally in Flint Park. Democratic presidential candidate Adlai Stevenson was seated on a platform with Michigan Governor G. Mennen Williams. Gallagher, kneeling at the base of the platform, took a photo of Stevenson seated with his legs crossed, which revealed a hole in the bottom of his right shoe. Because of Gallagher's position, he had to take this photo without looking through the shutter first. Gallagher didn't take the photo seriously and didn't think the Journal would publish it since they endorsed Stevenson's Republican opponent Dwight D. Eisenhower, so he gave it to his editor saying \"I just finished this for the hell of it. I don't suppose a Republican paper would want to use it.\" However, the Journal ran the photo on the front page. The New York Times wrote that Gallagher's photo was \"one of the outstanding pictures of the campaign\", perhaps because it contrasted with Stevenson's serious, patrician image. Stevenson was sent an \"avalanche\" of shoes by people who saw the image and when Gallagher won the Pulitzer Stevenson sent him a telegram reading \"Glad to hear you won with a hole in one.\" Gallagher died of meningitis at age 52."

  "text" : "William Hemmant (24 November 1837 – 20 September 1916) was an Australian politician who served in the Legislative Assembly of Queensland from 1871 to 1876. Hemmant was born in Kirkgate, Yorkshire, England, to Thomas and Isabella (née Richmond) on 24 November 1837. He worked as a draper in London before moving in 1859 to Ballarat, Victoria, where he worked as miner during the gold rush. He moved to Brisbane the following year, where he established a drapery shop with Alexander Stewart. The Great Fire of Brisbane in 1864 was said by some to have started in the Stewart and Hemmant shop, and the two gave evidence during a colonial inquiry into the fire. Nonetheless, the two built a successful department store and clothing manufactury. He traveled to England to marry Lucy Ground on the 20 September 1866, and returned to Brisbane early the next year. In1869 he built Eldernell House (named for a settlement in Cambridgeshire, near his wives birthplace) which is now the home of the Anglican Archbishop of Brisbane. Hemmant was a director of the Australian Bank of Commerce and an alderman on the Brisbane City Council. He won the seat of East Moreton in the Legislative Assembly in 1871, and successfully contested Bulimba in 1873. He served as Colonial Treasurer from 1874 to 1876. He is credited with producing four badges as candidates for the Flag of Queensland, from which the current badge, a crowned Maltese cross, was chosen. After he left politics in 1876, he returned to England with his family, settling in Kent. He built a house called Bulimba in Sevenoaks. All told, Hemmant and Lucy had 10 children. He died on 20 September 1916, his 50th wedding anniversary."

  "text" : "William Clark Noble (February 10, 1858, Gardiner, Maine – May 10, 1938, Washington, D.C.) was an American sculptor best known for his monuments. His father, Clark Noble, died at sea. His mother Emma Freeman, older brother, and infant Clark went to live on her father's farm in Richmond, Maine. He studied with Horatio Greenough and Lorado Taft. Taft, in his History of American Sculpture, remarked that Noble was one of a group of sculptors who had, \"made something of a specialty of military figures.\" Noble designed coinage for Guatemala and Panama. His Guatemalan quetzal (1925) and Panamanian balboa (1931) each exchanged for one US dollar. He was a member of the National Arts Club and the National Sculpture Society. He married three times. His son, William Clark Noble, Jr., also became an artist. Noble and his widow Emile are buried in Mount Hope Cemetery in South Gardiner, Maine."

  "text" : "Wilhelm Kolle (born 2 November 1868 in Lerbach near Osterode am Harz, died 10 May 1935) was a German bacteriologist and hygienist. He served as the second director of the Royal Institute for Experimental Therapy, succeeding its founder, the Nobel laureate Paul Ehrlich. He was also the original author, with Heinrich Hetsch, of the famous book Experimental Bacteriology, one of the most authoritative works in microbiology in the first half of the 20th century. Following studies of medicine at the universities of Göttingen, Halle and Würzburg, he became an assistant to Robert Koch at the Institut für Infektionskrankheiten (Institute for Infectious Diseases) in Berlin (1893–97). In 1897–98 he performed research of rinderpest and leprosy in South Africa, and in 1900, on behalf of the Egyptian government, studied rinderpest in Sudan. In 1901 he became departmental head at the Institut für Infektionskrankheiten, followed by an appointment as professor of hygiene and bacteriology at the University of Bern (1906). As a military physician and hygienist during World War I, he was highly successful in vaccination against diphtheria and cholera. In 1917, he became director of the Royal Institute for Experimental Therapy and of the Georg Speyer House in Frankfurt am Main. Kolle made numerous contributions in the fields of serology, microbiology and chemotherapy. He is credited with the development of an anti-meningococcus serum, as well as a vaccine against rinderpest. He introduced an improved Salvarsan preparation for treatment of syphilis, and in 1896 developed a heat-inactivated cholera vaccine that was used extensively during the 20th century. He was the father of the painter Helmut Kolle (1899–1931)."

  "text" : "W. Paul Cook (1880 – January 22, 1948) was a writer, printer and publisher. He wrote under his own name and the pseudonym Willis T. Crossman and was a leading figure in the hobbyist tradition of amateur journalism. He lived and wrote mostly in Vermont and Massachusetts. Cook was born in Mount Tabor, Vermont. His mother died giving birth and he was raised by his aunt and uncle. He attended Dartmouth but did not graduate. Among his works are a memoir about H. P. Lovecraft and stories about Vermont. He met Lovecraft through the National Amateur Press Association, and quickly became a champion of his weird fiction, some of which was first published in Cook's journal, The Vagrant. Cook also broadened Lovecraft's familiarity with supernatural literature by loaning him books and encouraging a systematic study of the field that resulted in Lovecraft's famous essay, \"Supernatural Horror in Literature,\" which was first published in Cook's The Recluse (1927). In addition to the various journals he published, including The Vagrant, The Recluse, The Revenant, \"The Ghost\", and Monadnock, Cook published books under the Recluse Press imprint. Some of them were by members of the Lovecraft Circle, like Samuel Loveman, Frank B. Long Jr., Donald Wandrei, Walter J. Coates, and Lovecraft himself. Leland Hawes and Sean Donnelly edited a collection of regional stories that Cook wrote under a pseudonym, Willis T. Crossman's Vermont: Stories by W. Paul Cook (published by the University of Tampa Press). Donnelly also edited a companion volume, W. Paul Cook: The Wandering Life of a Yankee Printer, collecting writings by and about Cook, to which he contributed a long biography of Cook and a bibliography of his numerous publications. It was published by Derrick Hussey's Hippocampus Press."

  "text" : "William Umpleby Kirk (1843 - 1928) was a pioneer photographer of the late Victorian period. He was born in Hull and grew up in nearby Market Weighton where, in the early 1870s, he set up his first photographic studio. Examples of his work from that period have survived and are collected. In 1881 Kirk moved his family and his business to Cowes, Isle of Wight. Cowes at that time was the international centre of yachting, the sport of royalty, the rich and the privileged. At Cowes yachts were raced, bought, sold and shown off. The rich and the titled came to Cowes to meet each other, to play and to be seen. Kirk photographed the boats and their owners afloat and ashore. He specialised in marine photographs, in portraiture e.g a copy of Kirk's photograph of The Marquis of Ormonde is held in the British National Archives at Kew. He photographed groups at house parties, tutor groups and sports teams of Naval Cadets at Osborne Naval College. His photographs of the sumptuous interiors of large yachts remain to record that era. Kirk's reputation grew when he photographed Queen Victoria's yacht HMY Alberta at a speed of 10 knots entering Cowes Harbour; this is said to be one of the first British photographs of a vessel in motion. and to have earned him the Royal Warrant. Photographs by Kirk of the yachts Bona and Ailsa, for example, were sold by auction at Christie's, New York and his work is sought by collectors. A collection of Kirk's work is held by the Isle of Wight County Council and is reviewed by Ian Dear. An extensive, but as yet uncatalogued collection of Kirk's original 8\" x 10\" glass plates is held by the Gallery, Classic Boat Museum, East Cowes."

He was in service against the Spanish Armada and was knighted at Cadiz by the Earl of Essex on 27 June 1596. He served afterwards in Ireland. In 1601, Hervey was elected Member of Parliament for Horsham. He was elected MP for Petersfield in 1604. He was created Baronet of St. Martin's in the Fields on 31 May 1619. On 5 August 1620, he was created Baron Hervey of Rosse, County Wexford. He was created Baron Hervey of Kidbrooke, Kent on 27 February 1628. The baronetcy merged into these peerages and continued until his death in 1642, when all his other honours became extinct. Hervey married firstly, in May 1597, Mary, dowager Countess of Southampton, widow of Sir Thomas Heneage, and formerly of Henry Wriothesley, 2nd Earl of Southampton, and daughter of Anthony Browne, 1st Viscount Montagu, by his first wife, Jane Radcliffe, daughter of Robert Radcliffe, 1st Earl of Sussex. They had no issue and she died in 1607. He married secondly on 5 February 1607, Cordell Anneslet, daughter of Brian Anneslet, of Lee and Kidbrooke, Kent, gentleman-pensioner, and his wife Audrey Tirrell, daughter of Tirrell, of Essex, warden of the Fleet Prison. As the step-father of the Earl of Southampton, Hervey has been suggested as one of several candidates to be the \"Mr W. H.\" of Shakespeare's sonnets and has also been proposed as their transmitter for publication."

  "text" : "William Goodday Strutt (1762–1848) was a British Army officer who served as governor of Quebec. Strutt was baptised at Springfield, Essex, on 26 February 1762, the second son of John Strutt, of Terling Place, Essex, by Anne, daughter of the Rev. William Goodday of Maldon. Entering the army in 1778, he joined his regiment, the 61st, at Minorca. Later he was appointed to a company in the 91st, and took part in the defence of St. Lucia. In 1782, having exchanged into the 97th, he served at the siege of Gibraltar. On the signing of the preliminaries of peace he purchased a majority in the 60th regiment, and, being placed on half-pay, visited several German courts. In 1787 he was sent with his regiment to the West Indies, where he took an active part in military affairs. Succeeding to a lieutenant-colonelcy by special command of George III, he was removed to the 54th, and went with the army of Lord Moira to Flanders. In 1794 he bore a very distinguished part against the French at Tiel, going through much hard fighting. On his return he was sent to St. Vincent, where he was raised to the rank of brigadier-general. In January 1796, with two hundred men, he attacked a force of twelve hundred, being himself thrice wounded, and losing his right leg. On his return to England he was received with marked favour by the king, and on 23 February 1796 was made deputy governor of Stirling Castle, afterwards serving upon the staff in Ireland. On 23 June 1798 he was raised to the rank of major-general, and on 13 May 1800 he was, as a reward for his services, appointed to the sinecure office of governor of Quebec, and he held that post until his death. He died at Tofts, Little Baddow, Essex, on 5 February 1848, having seen an exceptional amount of military service, both at home and abroad."

He subsequently joined the Communist Party in secret and used his political positions within the Nationalist government to aid the Communists. He was among a group of members of the Kuomintang who broke away to form the Revolutionary Committee of the Kuomintang in 1948.

At that time, he was named commissioner for the Canadian Red Cross in Saskatchewan. In 1924, he became Legislative Librarian and Commissioner of Publications for Saskatchewan. Kerr served in the provincial cabinet as Minister of Natural Resources and Minister of Highways and Transportation. He was defeated when he ran for reelection to the assembly in 1944.

Armstrong was born in 1850, was educated at Harrow and Exeter College, Oxford, and for some 10 years after 1880 was art critic to several newspapers, such as the Pall Mall Gazette, the Manchester Guardian, and the old Manchester Examiner. He made his mark in the art world, and was consulted by students and collectors, becoming an authority especially on Dutch 17th-century and English 18th-century painting. Several fine collections, of which that of Mr. S. Joseph, was one, were mainly formed under his advice. In 1892, he succeeded the late Henry Doyle as Director of the National Gallery of Ireland in Dublin, which his predecessor had reorganized and developed; and in this post Armstrong remained for over 20 years, his services recognized by a knighthood in 1899. During his time in Dublin he wrote many books, among which his stately volumes on Sir Joshua Reynolds, Gainsborough, and Raeburn were the chief, that held a position of authority for many years afterwards. Earlier and later he wrote columns on men so various as Peter De Wint, Velasquez, and Sir Thomas Lawrence, and a book of \"Notes\" on the National Gallery, containing many suggestive criticisms. Armstrong was said to be quick at absorbing the essential points of contemporary researchers and in judging them by the aid of a keen eye and a clear brain. In 1873 he married Miss Ferard of Ascot Place, of which there was issue, and he died in Westminster on 8 August 1918."

  "text" : "William Leworthy Goode Drew, CMG, (14 October 1826 – 14 July 1898) was an English-born auditor-general in colonial Queensland (a state of Australia since 1901). Drew was born in Broadstairs, Kent, England, to Capt. George Drew, RN and Caroline Fulford née Goode. George served during the Napoleonic wars and ended up as Superintendent at the Invalid Convict Station in Impression Bay, Tasmania. William was educated at the Blue Coat School and graduated from there to the Royal Navy at the age of 16. His final posting was Fleet Paymaster on the Australia/New Zealand stations at Sydney in 1853. On 30 January 1855 married Gertrude Jane Hely, daughter of Frederick Augustus Hely who had arrived in New South Wales as Superintendent of Convicts on the S.S. \"Isabella\" in 1823. After his payoff from the Royal Navy in 1856 he became a clerk in the NSW Railway Department in 1857 and within a few months was Secretary of the Steam Navigation Board. In 1858 he joined the Union Bank,; but his health failing he engaged in country pursuits.They moved to Brisbane, Queensland, and in 1862 was appointed Under Secretary of the Queensland Treasury. In October 1877 he was appointed Auditor-General of Queensland. He was a prominent citizen with a home \"Minto\" and estate at Toowong. He also served as Chairman of the local Road Trust, and as early trustee of St. Thomas' Church of England, among other things. J. B. Fewings wrote praising his \"varied experience, his uniform temper, courteous manner, tact and influence, strong individuality, knowledge of human nature, discretion and sound judgement, extensive information, and ability to conceal want of knowledge on any subject.\"The choice of Drew as Queensland's third Auditor-General was regarded as a coup for the Treasury, creating the audit office as a subordinate department in all but name. Upon his retirement from the Treasury he was appointed Chairman of the new Civil Service Board in November 1889. The Premier of the day, introduced a \"Drew Pension Bill\" which allowed Drew to receive £1000 yearly salary and also allowed him to draw £250 of the £540 retirement allowance he was entitled to on retirement as Auditor General, and so the \"Drew Pension Act of 1889 (53 Vic no. 13) came into being. He continued to serve the Government and the Queensland people until his death on 14 July 1898 at Toowong, Queensland. The Brisbane Courier wrote in its tribute that \"Drew was warmly esteemed. He was kind but was termed a strong man, somewhat reserved with strangers.\""

  "text" : "William Arthur Breakspeare (1855 – 8 May 1914) was an artist from Birmingham, England, the son of John Breakspeare, a flower painter working in the Birmingham japanning trade. Breakspeare lived in Edgbaston, Birmingham until the age of 22. He was apprenticed to the japanners, Halbeard and Wellings, as a decorator.In 1877, he moved to central Birmingham on Paradise Street. He was closely associated with the Royal Birmingham Society of Artists (RBSA) gallery, exhibiting 34 works from 1874 to 1899. He was one of the first Associates of the RBSA in 1881 and was elected RBSA in 1884. He was also a founder member of the Birmingham Art Circle. In about 1884 he visited Newlyn in Cornwall where other ‘Birmingham Boys’ were helping to establish the colony of artists. His work covered many genres including genre, portrait, figure and 18th-century costume pieces and landscape. Breakspeare spent time in Paris, moving there in 1879. Whilst living there he exhibited 'An Eastern Maid' at the RBSA, perhaps showing an influence of Orientalism from his stay. However his stay was short and moved to Haverstock Hill in London a few years later in 1881. He is understood to have spent the rest of his life there. As well as his training in Paris, Breakspeare was initially trained at the Birmingham Government School of Design and Charles Verlat's Academy in Antwerp. In his time Breakspeare exhibited around eight works at the Royal Academy in London from 1883 to 1893, including 'To Gretna Green' and 'Bathers'. He died at his home at the age of 58 in May 1914. Although he has never been widely recognised for his art, in his time he was a significant member of not only the RBSA but also the Birmingham art circle."

Vincent was apprenticed to Thomas Langham, a Grocer of London, and established himself as a linen-draper. He became a member of the Worshipful Company of Grocers in about 1639 and a member of the Honourable Artillery Company in 1640. In 1645 he became an assistant of the Levant Company; he became husband of the company in 1650. He was a member of the committee of the East India Company from 1654 until his death. He was commissioner for assessment for London in 1657 and a common councilman in 1657 and 1658. In 1658, he was elected an alderman of the City of London, for Bishopsgate ward. He was elected Sheriff of London in 1659, but did not serve. In 1659, Vincent was commissioner for militia and became deputy governor of the Levant Company, a position he held until his death. He signed the petition for a free Parliament and presented it to the Rump Parliament. He was commissioner for assessment for London from January 1660 until his death and was one of the three commissioners empowered to deal with General Monck on behalf of the City. He was imprisoned in the Tower of London when the Council of State ordered his arrest for suspected high treason on 6 February 1660, and was released when the secluded Members were returned to parliament. He was commissioner for militia in March 1660. In April 1660, Vincent was elected Member of Parliament for the City of London. He was one of the four London merchants who advanced £25,000 for the King in Holland. After presenting the reply of the City of London to the Declaration of Breda, he was knighted, in May 1660. He was appointed treasurer of poll-tax in September 1660. In 1661, he was common councilman again, warden of the Grocers’ Company, and vice president of the Honourable Artillery Company. He was also colonel in the blue regiment of militia of foot from March 1661 and was warden elect of the Grocers Company. Vincent died before September 1661, at the age of about 46.

Wang was born in Fenghua, Zhejiang, and his father was an Anglican minister just outside Shanghai, where Wang attended mission schools before entering the preparatory school for the Peiyang University. After teaching in the Provincial High School in Changsha, Hunan. Wang studied in Tokyo, where he was secretary of the Chinese YMCA, then in 1907, went to the United States to study law at the University of Michigan. He soon transferred to Yale University, graduating in 1910 and being elected to Phi Beta Kappa. He returned to Shanghai in June, 1911, and took another position with the YMCA before being recruited to join the new Republican government in Beijing, then in Sun Yat-sen's opposition government in Canton. He represented the interim Canton government in China's delegation, headed by Lu Zhengxiang, at the Paris Peace Conference, 1919 after World War I. He and V.K. Wellington Koo (Gu Weijun) played prominent roles in presenting the case for returning Shandong to China and in the decision not to sign the Treaty of Versailles because it stipulated the transfer of German rights in Shandong to Japan. He served as foreign minister, minister of finance, and acting premier for various short periods of time from 1924–1928, before serving as foreign minister until 1931. He also founded a Shanghai brokerage house; was chairman or board member of mining, cotton milling, and railroad companies; and was Chairman of the Far Eastern Olympics. As foreign minister, Wang negotiated a settlement with Japan over the Jinan Incident of 1928; with Soviet Russia over the Chinese Eastern Railway in Manchuria; treaties restoring Chinese territory in British Weihaiwei and French Tonkin; and tariff autonomy or commercial agreements with more than a dozen countries, including Japan. In spite of these successes in nationalist diplomacy, however, after the Mukden Incident of 1931, in which Japan seized control of China's Northwest provinces, student protestors blamed Wang for China's ineffective response. Wang was attacked and hospitalized, and withdrew from public office for a time. Wang was Ambassador to the United States 1936–38. In February 1938, he hosted a party at the Chinese Embassy in Washington DC which was attended by Yale Class of 1910 classmate Henry Roe Cloud (the first Native American to attend Yale). Cloud describes his reunion in detail and the letter is part of the Ravi D. Goel Collection on Henry Roe Cloud (MS 2008). Manuscripts and Archives, Yale University Library. (See also Yale Manuscripts and Archives April 2015 blog, \"Party Diplomacy: The Ravi D. Goel Collection on Henry Roe Cloud.\"). He served in various minor government and party capacities during the war, but in 1949 stayed in Hong Kong rather than go to Taiwan with Chiang Kai-shek's government."

He was born in Nagórzany near Kamieniec Podolski, Poland, and died in Warsaw. In 1802 as commander of the 2nd Polish Legion, he was involved in uncovering an anti-French Masonic plot which had been instigated by the Neapolitan brigade commander H. M. Aurora. Although this damaged his reputation in the eyes of his men, it did facilitate the transfer of his unit to the French armies payroll. However this came with a price: they were transferred to Haiti. Aksamitowski however did not accompany them. He was appointed Chief of Brigade in 1803, and Brigadier General in 1806. He was given command of the artillery of the Grand Duchy of Warsaw in 1806. In 1808, he was appointed a staff officer in the Grande Armée in the 3rd Corps of Louis-Nicolas Davout, and then commanded a brigade of the 1st Polish Legion in La Grande Armée d'Allemagne attached to the 3rd Corps. In 1813, he commanded a cavalry brigade and was a member of Joachim Murat's personal staff."

Prior to playing professionally, he attended Mar Vista High School and then U.S. International University. Selected by the Houston Astros in the 15th round of the 1988 amateur draft, Trice began his professional career that year with the Auburn Astros. In 15 games (14 starts), he went 8-4 with six complete games and a 1.90 ERA, while striking out 107 batters and walking only 24 in 104 innings. He also allowed only 83 hits. He was second in the New York–Penn League in strikeouts, behind only Mike Sodders, who had 119. The following season, Trice went 16-4 with a 2.57 ERA in 28 games (27 starts) for the Osceola Astros. He led the Florida State League in victories, while his three shutouts tied for second in the loop. He also finished third in innings (182 1/3) and hits allowed (179). In 1990, with the Columbus Mudcats, Trice went 6-7 with a 4.02 ERA in 33 games (22 starts). His 17 home runs allowed were the second-most in the Southern League. He became a relief pitcher in 1991, splitting the year between the Burlington Astros and Jackson Generals. In 55 appearances, he went 5-5 with a 2.08 ERA and 19 saves, while striking out 80 batters in 69 1/3 innings. He finished third in the Midwest League in saves with 18 (he had only one with the Generals of the Texas League). After joining the Cleveland Indians system following the 1991 season, he returned to the starting rotation for part of 1992. In 33 games (14 starts), he went 5-7 with a 4.04 ERA for the Canton–Akron Indians. With Canton-Akron again in 1993, he went 3-2 with a 5.61 ERA in 19 games (three starts). He also pitched briefly with the Mercuries Tigers of the Chinese Professional Baseball League that year, going 3-1 with a 2.63 ERA. He resurfaced with the Amarillo Dillas of the independent Texas–Louisiana League in 1996, going 1-3 with a 6.82 ERA in eight games (five starts). Overall, Trice went 44-32 with a 3.38 ERA in 189 games (84 starts) in his American professional career."

In the 1890s, Robison was elected to the Utah Territorial Legislature from the district that covered what was then Piute and Beaver counties. When Piute County was split, Robison was put in charge of organizing the new county, which he named Wayne County after one of his sons. In 1893, when the Wayne Stake of the LDS Church was organized, Robison was made the first president of that stake. Robison was a member of the 1895 Utah Constitutional Convention."

Inspired by Gosse's new book, The Aquarium, published in 1854 Lloyd, who worked for a bookseller,began keeping marine animals in glass tanks. On 14 July 1855 he opened a shop advertised in Notes & Queries as “selling everything relating to aquaria” at 164 St John Street Road, Clerkenwell, London. In 1856 he opened a new shop “The Aquarium Warehouse” at 20, Portland Road, Regent's Park and in 1860 he supervised the installation of an aquarium The Gardens of the Society of Acclimatation in Bois de Boulogne in Paris. By the 1860s the aquarium craze was over, at least in England, and Lloyd went bankrupt and in 1862 supported by Richard Owen he moved to Grindel Dammthor, Hamburg to supervise the installation of the circulating system and tanks at the Hamburg Aquarium.Success in Germany led to his appontment as Superintendent of the Crystal Palace Aquarium two years before it opened in 1871. Anton Dohrn who had made Lloyd's acquaintance in 1866 at the Hamburg aquarium invited him to install the aquaria at Stazione Zoologica at Naples in the spring of 1873. Here some of Lloyd's circulating system was still operating well into the 20th century. Anton Dohrn's professional biological station flourished and the Swedish Professor Loven of Sweden, who planned a research establishment sent a representative to London to consult with Lloyd. In England Lloyd's last post was as superintendent at the Aston Aquarium, Birmingham."

He acted as a Swedish governor in Swedish Pomerania and later, under Prussian rule, as the chairman of the regional council (Kommunallandtag) of Pomerania and Rügen. As a result of his extensive building activity, Wilhelm Malte I has left many traces of the first half of the 19th century on the island of Rügen. Under his rule, his home town of Putbus was greatly expanded in the classical style and is still known today as \"The White Town\"."

  "text" : "After leaving school and spending some time working and travelling in England, Germany, Austria and the Balkans, he went to Manchester University and obtained First Class Honours in German in 1942, followed by a DipEd and M.A. at Bristol University, where he received a distinction in practical teaching. After working briefly in the German Department at Durham University in 1945, Lockwood taught at the University of Birmingham, during which time he also briefly taught as a Senior Lecturer in German at the University of Sydney. As he left Birmingham, the University awarded him a D.Litt. on the basis of his many publications. In 1961 he received an invitation to the Chair of Comparative Philology at the Humboldt-Universität in East Berlin, the capital of the German Democratic Republic. 1961, however, was the year in which the Communist regime erected its infamous wall, and after four years of increasing disillusionment with the political climate he returned to the West. He settled in Dublin, intending to devote himself to his philological studies, including German and Germanic languages (especially Faroese) as well as Roman, Hellenic, Slavonic and Celtic (especially Welsh) languages. A year later, however, he was invited to take up a specially established readership in Germanic and Indo-European philology at Reading. This readership was converted into a chair in 1968, and he remained at Reading until his retirement."

He was one of the Sheriffs of London from 1660 to 1661 and was knighted on 11 October 1663. In 1666, he was elected Lord Mayor of London. However he was unable to account for £1,800 of the collections made for those who suffered in the Great Fire of London and was accused of cheating the poor of the City. As a result, he was barred from attending the Court of Aldermen while an inquiry took place and eventually had to resign his seat. He became very poor and on 19 March 1677 the Court of Common Council voted him a pension of £3 per week."

  "text" : "Wilfried Senoner (20 January 1945 – 26 March 1999) was an Italian artist. Wilfried Senoner was born in Urtijëi, son of the sculptor Gabriel Senoner. Thus, from his early childhood on, he was well acquainted with the art of carving. After graduating from the Urtijëi Art School, he continued to improve his skills in his father's workshop. From 1964 to 1968 he studied at the Art Academy \"Brera\" in Milan with the well known professors Francesco Messina, Marino Marini and Alik Cavaliere. He graduated from the academy with first-class degrees in sculpture and art history. During his stay in Milan he met with many artists and being a regular visitor to their workshops he discovered his love for painting. From 1972 to 1974 Wilfried worked with an architect in Augsburg, Germany. Meanwhile he published a pocket book of satirical cartoons \"Wirr Warr\", for which he got a prize. Back in Italy, he started a ten-year-long career as art teacher at different schools in Urtijëi and Sëlva.In 1984 he decided to settle down as a freelance artist. His oevre expresses his versatility and taste for experimenting with different techniques, like fresco painting on houses and church facades or enamel painting for the restoration of altars etc. In Germany he created huge altars in various styles (ranging from Gothic to modern art). From 1967 on, he exhibited his works in either individual or collective exhibitions and participated in competitions, where he won a number of awards. In his last years of life, previous to his fatal skiing accident, he worked at a frenetic pace on a multitude of projects in Italy and abroad, as if he had been aware of what would happen in the near future. His works are to be seen in churches all over Europe. Some of the biggest altars are situated in Germany, like: \n* 1984/5 Schönbrunn, church design 1985/7 Main altar and people's altar in Bogen (8m) \n* 1986/7 Main altar and people's altar in Eschenbach (14m) Eschenbach Parish \n* 1985/90 interior church design in Rothenkirchen (15m x 9m) 1988 2 side altars in Pollenfeld (7m)"

He was chiefly notable for transforming Madras Christian College into an ecumenical enterprise and imbuing the minds of Madras Province South Indians with Fulfilment theology, with an idea of \"Christ the fulfiller\"—in a sense, he is considered not only the pioneer of Fulfilment theology, but also of Hindu Renaissance by making Indian converts to think Christianity in Indian context. He was the recipient of Kaiser-i-Hind Medal and the first LL.D, honoured by the Madras University."

As a curator, her research interests are in modern art from the Arab world, with a particular emphasis on Iraq. Al-Khudhairi has presented on the role of Iraqi women artists in formulating modernism in Iraq. Al-Khudhairi's work often considers questions such as the use or recreation of history, memory, traumatic events such as war and civil uprising. One of the youngest museum directors ever and a leader within the Arab world's emerging contemporary art scene, Al-Khudhairi was a Keynote speaker at the 2012 Communicating the Museum conference Al-Khudhairi was a Co-Artistic Director of ROUNDTABLE: The 9th Gwangju Biennale (Korea, 2012)."

Halliday began his professional career working on steamboats on the Mississippi and Ohio rivers and eventually became a captain of a steamboat based out of Louisville, Kentucky. A pioneer in the river and railroad transportation businesses, Halliday was responsible for the expansion of Cairo, Illinois, following the American Civil War. Before the war, Halliday predicted that it would greatly impact river and railroad transportation and moved to Cairo, Illinois, a town at a critical position, at the confluence of the Ohio and Mississippi rivers. Soon after relocating, Halliday established many businesses that focused on river transportation and general merchandise. During the war, Halliday became good friends with General Ulysses S. Grant, and this relationship increased his personal fortune considerably through favorable military contracts. After the Civil War, Halliday, his four brothers, and other family members rapidly expanded their business interests in the region. Halliday purchased real estate, businesses, hotels, mines, railroads, lumber yards, steamboats, and furniture companies, and took advantage of many other business opportunities. His business success led to the advancement of the region and specifically contributed to the development of Cairo, Illinois, and Hallidayboro, Illinois."

He graduated from the University of Georgia with a Bachelor of Fine Art's degree in 1979. The following year in Savannah, he worked independently as an illustrator and began his first serious painting in watercolors. From 1980 to 1984, he lived in Buck's County, Pennsylvania, and began traveling up and down the New England coast to paint maritime subjects and harbor scenes. In 1984, he settled in Charleston, South Carolina and continued his work in watercolor through the late 1980s. The realistic, detailed marine compositions from this period resulted in early critical recognition, with a 1984 two-man show at the Grand Central Art Galleries in New York City, and his first one-man exhibition at the Gibbes Museum of Art in Charleston in 1986 through early 1987."

  "text" : "William Stephenson (junior) (2 September 1797 in Gateshead - 20 May 1838) was a Geordie printer, publisher, auctioneer, poet and songwriter born in Gateshead, and son of William Stephenson (senior). He started work as a printer and very soon opened his own business at the Bridge End, Gateshead. Much of his business seemed to come from the cheap chapbooks, song slips, many to the hawkers together with last dying confessions; these seem to be the objects which keep turning up in collections. Shortly after closure of the The Gateshead Intelligencer he gave up his printing work and became an auctioneer and succeeded in being a success. On his death, the Gateshead Observer of 26 May 1838 carried a notice which read “On Sunday (May 20), after a long illness, aged 40, much respected, Mr. W. Stephenson, printer\""

In Texas, Linn took part in the siege of Bexar, and is listed on the roster of Lt. Col. James C. Neill's Bexar garrison as having been taken prisoner. This possibly occurred during Siege of Bexar and then Linn may have been released. Linn purportedly served in the Alamo as a member of Capt.

  "text" : "William Tynbegh, or de Thinbegh (died 1424) was an Irish lawyer who had a long and distinguished career as a judge, holding office as head of all three of the courts of common law and as Treasurer of Ireland. His career is unusual, by modern standards, in that he left the Bench to become Attorney General for Ireland, but later returned to the Bench. He was born in Ireland to a family of Welsh origin: his surname is a derivation of Tenby. In 1392 he received a licence to study law in England. Somewhat surprisingly (since he can hardly have been called to the Bar more than a year or two previously) he was appointed Lord Chief Justice of the King's Bench for Ireland as early as 1396 and Chief Baron of the Irish Exchequer in 1397. In 1400 he resigned from the Bench to become Attorney General. He is mentioned again as Chief Baron in 1405 and 1417; in 1412 he received a commission to act as justice of the peace in Dublin and the adjoining counties. He returned to the Court of Common Pleas (Ireland) as Chief Justice in 1419 and again in 1424. In 1420 he witnessed the charter by which King Henry V guaranteed certain liberties and privileges to the Mayor and citizens of Dublin. He was appointed Treasurer of Ireland in 1421. He was still living in March 1424 when he ordered the Archbishop of Dublin to make a grant of land; but he is thought to have died later the same year."

He and his wife are mentioned several times in the Zimmern Chronicle, which was written by their son-in-law, Count Froben Christoph of Zimmern. In 1561, Wilhelm officially converted the County of Eberstein to Protestantism. He had been unofficially promoting the Evangelical faith for some time. He expanded his Neu-Eberstein Castle significantly. A tombstone depicting Wilhelm and his wife, has been preserved in the St. Jakob church in Gernsbach."

  "text" : "Wulf Kirsten (born 21 June 1934) is a German poet, novelist, and publisher. He is known for his nature poetry and his essays on the history and culture of Saxony. The son of a stonemason, Kirsten was born in Klipphausen, Meissen. He worked as salesman, bookkeeper and labourer before graduating from the Workers' and Farmers' College (Arbeiter- und Bauern-Fakultät) of Leipzig in 1960, and then completed a teaching degree in German and Russian in 1964. At the same time he worked on a freelance basis for the compilers of the Dictionary of the Upper Saxon Dialects, providing them with more than a thousand words from his own household. After obtaining his degree, he worked briefly as a teacher, and then in 1965 moved to Weimar to work for the Aufbau Verlag publishing house, where he would stay until 1987. To further his career as a poet, in the years 1969 and 1970 Kirsten spent nine months studying at the Johannes R. Becher Institute of Literature, under the tutelage of Heinz Czechowski and Georg Maurer. Between 1968 and 1977, he wrote several volumes of poetry, followed in 1984 by a volume of two prose works. Much of the poetry is collected in die erde bei Meißen (1986), which received the Peter Huchel Prize in 1987, and helped introduce him to West German audiences. During the upheavals of 1989 and 1990, Kirsten became involved in the New Forum at Weimar, but he was quickly disillusioned and retired from political activism. Between 1992 and 2010 he published his work through Ammann Verlag in Zürich, which issued his collected works in 2004 under the title Erdlebenbilder. He lives in Weimar."

  "text" : "Hon. William Bates (27 February 1825 – 12 January 1891) was a politician in colonial Victoria, Australia. Bates was born at Uxbridge, in Middlesex, and emigrated to South Australia in 1850. In 1852 the gold discoveries tempted him to Victoria, where he went into business at Sandhurst, and after four years' successful trading, removed to Melbourne, where he had a prosperous career as a general merchant. In 1868 he was returned to the Victorian Legislative Assembly for the electoral district of Collingwood as a supporter of the Darling Grant, defeating no less a candidate than the Hon. James Service. He was Minister of Public Works in the M'Culloch Government from April 1870 to June 1871, but did not re-enter Parliament after 1874, though he contested for the districts of Fitzroy (1877) and Collingwood again (1880). Mr. Bates was a prominent member of the Congregationalist body, and was Treasurer of the Jubilee Fund which was raised a few years ago to celebrate the jubilee of the establishment of the first church of the denomination in Victoria. That movement was so successful that close upon £48,000 was raised, and the denomination was able to pay off the debts on all its churches in the colony. Mr. Bates died at Fitzroy, Melbourne, on 12 January 1891, at the age of sixty-five. He married Anne Cramer Williams in Melbourne in 1857, and there was issue of 2 sons and 5 daughters."

  "text" : "William Connolly (1839–1870's?), Irish piper. William Connolly was born in Milltown, County Galway, to Liam Dáll Connolly (whose grandson was piper John Burke). He had a brother, John, who was also a piper. Early in life he and his brother John travelled to Liverpool, sailing from there to the United States, where John settled. William travelled on to Canada, playing \"in that country for an unusually long time\"  on steamers up and down the St. Lawrence River. Having made a great deal of money, he relocated to Brooklyn, New York, where he bought a house. This was sold in 1863 as Connolly feared he would be drafted into the Union army as a result of the ongoing American Civil War. \"Besides, he realized that it was much easier for him to handle a chanter than a rifle, so he lost no time in getting back to Liverpool, in which cosmopolitan city he remained four years.\" He returned to Milltown after leaving Liverpool and before sailing again to the USA, \"Modesty evidently was not his most conspicuous virtue, for we are told that he engaged a boy to carry his set of bagpipes through Milltown, with a view to impress the people with a due sense of his importance.\" He settled this time in Waltham, Massachusetts, where he built a dance hall. Restless, he made San Francisco his home for a time, returning to Waltham, then back to San Francisco. He left California for the last time, intending to buy the Hibernian Hall in Brooklyn, but was unable \"as his wife would not consent to the sale of her home in Waltham\". He then moved to Pittsburgh, where he died sometime in the 1870s or perhaps 1880s. His brother John also appears to have spent some time in San Francisco. According to fellow piper, Patsy Touhey, John Connolly died about 1895 at Milford, Massachusetts. O'Neill reported that \"Mr. Burke, to whom we are indebted for the above information, says “William Connolly was the best general player on the Irish pipes on either side of the Atlantic.” Michael Egan, the famous maker of the Irish or Union pipes, who knew all the best pipers of his day, was of the same opinion.\""

  "text" : "William Walsh (1859-after 1913), Irish piper. Walsh was a native of Oughterard, County Galway, a Gaeilgeoir, and musically self-taught. He emigrated to the United States with his parents, eventually joining the Chicago police force. He participated and won the Gaelic Feis in that city in July 1912, and again in 1913. He provided O'Neill with some information concerning obscure Connacht pipers: \"Through the kindness of Officer William Wa1sh of the Chicago police force, we present the names of some Connacht pipers unknown to fame, as they had never rambled beyond the confines of their native province. Though a native of Oughterard, County Galway, Officer Walsh is an accomplished “Highland piper,” and a writer of pipe music.\" \"Between the fifties and eighties of the nineteenth century there rambled through the said county, “Paddy” Green, a blind piper from Tuam; “Paddy” Kilkenny, who hailed from Clifden; and John Lennan of Kilkerin, who achieved considerable repute throughout Connemara.\" \"Martin Moran was a native of County Mayo, and Charles Daly, though born in Clara, spent most of his time in Galway. There was another piper, known only by the name “Eunachaun,” who for neatly thirty years enjoyed enviable popularity in Iarconnacht. No wedding or christening could be properly celebrated without the piper and his music in that district or in Connemara in the “good old times.\""

  "text" : "William Eastlake (1917 in Brooklyn, New York – 1997 near Cuba, New Mexico) was an American writer. His Checkerboard Trilogy, consisting of the works Go in Beauty (1956), The Bronc People (1958), and Portrait of an Artist with Twenty-Six Horses (1963) was included by literary critic Larry McCaffery in his list of the 20th Century's Greatest Hits: 100 English-Language Books of Fiction. Eastlake was born of British parents in Brooklyn, and grew up in Caldwell, New Jersey. As an infant he and his older brother Gordon were sent to Bonnie Brae, an Episcopal boarding school in nearby Liberty Corners, New Jersey, which he called Prettyfields, which he features in his 1969 novel The Bamboo Bed. In the early 1940s, he worked at the Stanley Rose Bookstore in Los Angeles, California, which was a literary hangout for writers Nathanael West, Clifford Odets, Theodore Dreiser, William Saroyan, John Steinbeck et al. He also worked as a reporter, covering the story of a lynching in Mississippi, where he visited writer William Faulkner. In 1943 he married painter Martha Simpson (1898-1984). In 1942, Eastlake joined the U.S. Army, and was stationed at Camp MacArthur and Camp Ord in California, followed by Camp White in Oregon. After the Pearl Harbor Attack, all Japanese draftees in the U.S. Army were sent to Camp Ord, where Eastlake was given the job of \"looking after them\", writing \"I never knew a more pro-American, patriotic group than those Japanese-American soldiers.\" Eastlake would obligingly take photographs of them to send to their relatives \"in the euphemistic 'relocation' camps.\" Eventually the troops were placed into a separate combat unit and sent off to war. \"They fought and died with the best of them while their parents languished in concentration camps,\" Eastlake wrote. His frustration and anger over this experience are portrayed in his first novel Ishimoto's Land, which remains unpublished. \"The publishers told me it was too early for a book about this American tragedy. The public is not ready for it yet.\" Later Eastlake was transferred to a reinforcement company in England, where his job was \"to process and instruct\" newly arrived troops, including acclimatizing them to British customs. His outfit then landed at Omaha Beach, after which he fought in France and Belgium, and was a platoon leader when wounded in the right shoulder in the 1944 Battle of the Bulge, receiving a steel plate that hampered movement of his arm. Though he was awarded the Bronze Star for his service, he repeatedly declined to talk about it; second wife Marilyn Hill explained that he was embarrassed by the fact that it wasn't enemy fire that wounded him, but his own gun that had misfired, blasting shrapnel into his shoulder. After the war ended, Eastlake accepted an invitation to join an army buddy in Switzerland and start a small literary magazine. Unfortunately, the backer withdrew support after only one issue, so the Eastlakes moved to Paris, where Martha had lived once before as an art student. The literary magazine Essai contains Eastlake's first published story, Ishimoto's Land. In 1955 he and Rose bought a 400-acre ranch in the Jemez Mountains near Cuba, New Mexico, which became a mecca for writers Julian Huxley, Edward Abbey, Robert Creeley et al. Eastlake's 1965 book Castle Keep, about U.S. soldiers trying to defend a Belgian castle filled with art treasures during the 1944 Battle of the Bulge was made into the 1969 movie Castle Keep, directed by Sydney Pollack, starring Burt Lancaster, Patrick O'Neal, Jean-Pierre Aumont, Bruce Dern, and Peter Falk."

In 2005 Adams was awarded the Order of the Two Niles, Sudan's highest civilian honor, for his contributions to Nubian history. Adams's work in Nubia began in 1959 as part of the UNESCO archaeological salvage campaign to excavate sites threatened by the rising flood waters of Lake Nasser following the construction of the Aswan Dam. Over the course of the next seven years he excavated a number of medieval sites in northern Sudan, including the pottery factories at Faras. By analyzing the changing proportions of broken potsherds in the fill, Adams was able to establish a typology of Nubian pottery that could be used to date excavation levels."

The latter year he was raised to the Irish peerage as Baron Riversdale, of Rathcormack in the County of Cork. Lord Riversdale married Rose Bernard, daughter of James Bernard and sister of the 1st Earl of Bandon, in 1773. They had eight sons and two daughters. He died in December 1787, aged 63, and was succeeded by his second but eldest surviving son, William.

From 1914 to 1921 he was on the executive of the Master Builders' Association (vice-president 1916–17, president 1918); he also served on the executive of the Employers' Federation. From 1920 to 1936 he served on Woollahra Council, and was mayor from 1923 to 1924. He was elected to the New South Wales Legislative Assembly in 1925 as a Nationalist member for Eastern Suburbs; he represented Vaucluse from the re-introduction of single-member districts in 1927. He criticised Bertram Stevens' government on its approach to transport policy. On 21 July 1936, Foster collapsed and died on the floor of the Legislative Assembly.

Fortescue was the son of James Fortescue and Mary Henrietta Hunter, daughter of Thomas Orby Hunter, of Crowland Abbey, Lincolnshire. William Fortescue, 1st Earl of Clermont, was his uncle. He served in the British Army, reaching the rank of lieutenant. In 1796 he was returned to the Irish House of Commons for County Louth (succeeding his brother Thomas James Fortescue), a seat he held until 1800, when the Irish Parliament was abolished on the formation of the Union. He was instead returned to the British Parliament for County Louth, where he remained until 1806. The latter year he succeeded his uncle Lord Clermont as 2nd Viscount Clermont according to a special remainder in the letters patent. This was an Irish peerage and did not entitle him to an automatic seat in the English House of Lords although he was forced to resign his seat in Parliament as Irish peers were barred from representing Irish constituencies in the House of Commons. Lord Clermont died at Ravensdale Park, County Louth, in June 1829, aged 64. He was unmarried and the viscountcy died with him. The Clermont title was revived in 1852 when his kinsman Thomas Fortescue was made Baron Clermont."

  "text" : "Willy Merkl (6 October 1900 – 15/17 July 1934) was a German mountain climber who is most notable for his attempt to lead a German-American team up Nanga Parbat (the Naked Mountain) in the Pakistani Himalayas in 1932. His team was known to be very experienced in Alpine and European mountain expeditions, but were unprepared for the trials of the Himalayas. Despite being forced to turn back, the team did make excellent progress and found a way through the Rakhiot Peak and the main ridge. In 1934 he led another expedition up the same mountain that proved to be fatal. Although this expedition was better prepared and financed by Nazi Germany, due in large part to the Nazi's desire to symbolically 'conquer any peak', the weather proved too strong and overtook the climbers. On July 6, the team was at a good point to attempt the final stretch of the climb. Had the climbers set out right then, some could have likely been well on their way to the top. However, Merkl wanted the entire team to arrive at the same time and so they waited a day to rest the group, assuming all would be well. Instead the next day saw the beginning of a snowstorm and blizzard that lasted for nine days. When it let up, Merkl, two other members of the team, and six sherpas were dead. It is apparent that their deaths had been slow and extremely arduous, caused by an extended exposure to cold and starvation.Merkl's frozen body, and that of Sherpa Gaylay, were found in 1938 after another German expedition stumbled upon the snow cave they had taken refuge in."

  "text" : "William Gonson (died 1544), was the English Vice-Admiral of Norfolk and Suffolk serving under King Henry VIII in 1536. He was the father of Benjamin Gonson, who would go on to hold a career in the English navy as well. William ran the navy almost single handedly for twenty years and was referred to as the keeper of the storehouses at Erith and Deptford. William eventually fell from grace and died in 1544 leaving the navy disorganized. This info about William in disgrace is questionable. His son, Sir David Gonson had denounced Henry VIII, and another Knight had reported this to Henry. Apparently this Knight had had an altercation with Sir David. It is believed he purposefully relayed this information so the King would take action against Sir David. David was held in the Tower without a trial. After about a year, in 1541, he was taken to St. Johns Waterings where he was hanged, drawn and quartered. His father committed suicide in 1544. His son, Benjamin was then the Navy Treasurer. Remember, when Henry became King, reports say he had only 5 ships. The Gonsons helped Henry increase the number of ships. By the time the Battle with the Spanish Armada occurred obviously the number of ships had greatly increased and England win the Battle. It took two years for Henry to reorganise control and develop what became known as 'The Navy Board'. What if anything Henry reirganized, it's not known. His main concerns were his family issues and keeping the executioners employed with the many Knights and other radicals who refused to denounce their religion. Henry's Navy had started with 5 ships, by 1544 there were 80 ships. William had served the King for decades, one position was Equiry to The Body of the King. Yet he was cruelly \"rewarded\" by the King when his son, Sir David Gonson of St. John, returned from Malta. The Gonsons continued to serve future Queens Mary and Elizabeth 1, for decades. The many record books for the Navy all indicate how all the generations of the Gonson family served their Kings and Queens with devotion, in many roles. Dame Katherine Gonson Hawkins had christened a ship The Redemption in an attempt to please the Queen. The Queen had it renamed \"The Dainty.\" One of them being the War with the Spanish Armada in 1588. Capt. Benjamin Gonson's likeness, bottom row-middle, is shown on the John Pine engraving done in the 1700s. Later, the diary of Sam Sewell, indicates a Capt. Benjamin Gonson sails to the Colonies on his ship The Talbot, arriving in 1629. Pope Pious X1 created St. David Gonson in 1929. The Good Knight."

He learned to speak Seminole as secretary to the commander of what is now Oklahoma. Webb became an assistant professor of physics at the University of Kentucky in 1908 and was promoted to department head in 1915. During the First World War he enlisted with the 84th Infantry Division, rising to the rank of Major. When a department of archaeology and anthropology was established at the University of Kentucky in 1926, Webb became its first head. The two-member department wrote several books on Kentucky in prehistoric times. Beginning in 1933, Webb coordinated archaeological excavations in the Tennessee Valley. He was granted an honorary doctorate from the University of Alabama in 1937, though because of fears that he would not agree to accept the degree, he was tricked into traveling to the school and \"captured\" shortly before the award ceremony. Webb was president of the Central States Branch of the American Anthropological Association, vice-president of the Society of American Archaeology, and honorary president of the Kentucky Archaeological Society. He received the title of \"Distinguished Professor\" in 1950. He also held \"various national offices in physics organizations\". His \"extensive list of site reports...perhaps constitute his major contribution to American archaeology\". Webb officially retired in 1952, though he still continued his research until his death."

On 10 December 1884 he married Margaret Mahoney at Dunedin, with whom he would have six children. He arrived in New South Wales in 1885 and purchased the Moruya Times, and in 1888 added the Dungog Chronicle, which he also edited. In 1898 he was elected to the New South Wales Legislative Assembly as an independent protectionist, representing Durham. He joined the Progressive Party in 1901 and remained a member until 1907, when he was defeated as part of the Progressives' electoral destruction. He had served as an honorary minister in the Progressive governments of 1901 to 1904, and for two months as Secretary for Public Works from June to August 1904. Bennett remained active in the community of the Dungog area and became involved in the Farmers and Settlers Association. In 1917 he was re-elected as the independent member for Durham, ultimately joining the new, rural-based Progressive Party. During the period of proportional representation he was one of the members for Maitland. He was part of the Coalition faction of the Progressives, and in 1922, in common with the rest of that group, he joined the Nationalist Party. When single-member districts were re-introduced in 1927 he represented Gloucester. Bennett died at Mosman in 1934 and was succeeded in the Assembly by his son Charles. His funeral service was held at St. Chads Church, Cremorne on 17 July 1934. His body was transported to Dungog, New South Wales for burial."

  "text" : "William Williams (11 February 1859 - 22 April 1892) was a Welsh Presbyterian missionary to Khasi Hills, northeast India, in the late 19th century. He was a son of a ship captain in Nanternis, a small village in Wales. Following his father's footstep he became a sailor for five years. Then he took a profession in carpentry for two years. After graduating in theology from East London Missionary Training Institute (now Cliff College) he became a pastor. Pursuing his ambition he became a missionary of the Welsh Calvinistic Methodist Foreign Mission to Khasi people in India from 1887 until his death. He is regarded as a pioneer missionary who paved the way for Christianity in Mizoram, now the most Christian-populated state in India. He visited the Mizo people, hitherto completely pagan tribals, in Aizawl (now the capital city of Mizoram) in March 1890, with determination to start evangelism. He died typhoid a year later. The date of his arrival, 15 March, in Mizoram is adopted as \"Missionary Day\" by the Mizoram Presbyterian Church in its 89th General Assembly in 2012."

  "text" : "Willy Georg Wolterstorff (16 June 1864 in Calbe – 21 January 1943 in Magdeburg) was a German paleontologist and herpetologist. As a child he lost his hearing due to disease, thus finding it necessary to lip-read from an early age. He learned natural sciences through private lessons. After receiving vocational training as a bookbinder, he studied geology from 1884 under Karl von Fritsch (1838-1906) at the University of Halle. At Halle he also received training as a curator. In 1889 he became an assistant to Konrad Oebbeke (1853-1932) at the mineralogical-geological institute at Erlangen, and two years later was appointed curator at the Museum für Naturkunde und Vorgeschichte (museum of natural history and prehistory) in Magdeburg. After his retirement in 1929, he remained at the Magdeburg museum, performing important functions as a volunteer. Wolterstorff is known for scientific research of \"lower vertebrates\", in particular investigations involving the systematics, reproduction and behavior of members of the family Salamandridae. He was the author of nearly 300 scientific papers, and from 1909 was editor of Blätter für Aquarien- und Terrarienkunde. He is credited with creation of the \"Tradescantia-Glas\", an enclosure-method (Hälterungsmethode) for maintenance and breeding of newts. The recently extinct Wolterstorff's newt (Cynops wolterstorffi), is one of the species named in his honour. As a taxonomist, he described the salamander genus Mertensiella (1925)."
