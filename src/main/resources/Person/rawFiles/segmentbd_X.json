Like other early Chu rulers, he held the hereditary noble rank of viscount first granted to his ancestor Xiong Yi by King Cheng of Zhou. Xiong Yan succeeded his older brother Xiong Zhi, who abdicated due to illness. The Records of the Grand Historian (Shiji) says that he killed Xiong Zhi and usurped the throne, but this account is contradicted by earlier history books Zuo Zhuan and Guoyu. Xiong Yan died in 848 BC and was succeeded by his elder son Xiong Yong. His younger son, also Xiong Yan (熊嚴, different in Chinese characters), ascended the throne after Xiong Yong's death."

Xiong Yan's father was also named Xiong Yan (熊延, different in Chinese characters), who was succeeded as the ruler of Chu by his older son Xiong Yong. Xiong Yong died in 838 BC and the younger Xiong Yan succeeded his older brother. Xiong Yan had four sons: Xiong Shuang (熊霜), Xiong Xue (熊雪), Xiong Kan (熊堪), and Xiong Xun (熊徇). When Xiong Yan died in 828 BC he was succeeded by his first son Xiong Shuang. However, when Xiong Shuang died six years later, Xiong Yan's three younger sons fought one another for the throne. The youngest son Xiong Xun was ultimately victorious and ascended the throne, while Xiong Xue was killed and Xiong Kan escaped to Pu (濮)."

She was the bronze medallist in the 10,000 metres at the 1986 Asian Games and won the 1988 Rotterdam Marathon. Her personal best of 2:32:11 hours is a former Chinese record for the marathon. Born in Rushan, Shandong, she started out as a middle distance runner and won the national junior 800 metres and 1500 metres titles in 1982. She quickly moved up to the marathon distance and came third in the event at the 1983 Chinese National Games. She won the Chinese senior title over 10,000 metres at the 1986 national championships and gained selection for the 1986 Asian Games as a result. She was primarily instructed to run tactically to provide the more talented Wang Xiuting with a chance to win the title. Her team mate won the race while Xiao finished behind Japan's Kumi Araki to take the bronze medal. In respect of this achievement, she was entered into the marathon at the 1987 Chinese National Games and she won the gold medal in a career best performance of 2:32:11 hours. This time was a Chinese national record for the event, although it lasted less than a year as Zhao Youfeng ran faster in March 1988. She was given permission to compete at the Rotterdam Marathon in April 1988 and she became the race's first Asian champion, winning in a time of 2:37:46 hours. She retired from competition and became a coach in the Shandong Province from 1992 onwards. She has trained athletes to an international junior standard, including Sun Guanghong and Li Yunxia. In recognition of her achievements, she has received National Labor Medals from her Province and received merits from the regional sports committee."

He received his Bachelor of Science in 1993 and Master of Science in 1996 from Nanjing University, China. He then moved to the United States and obtained his Ph.D. in chemistry from the University of Idaho in 1999 under the supervision of Professor Chien M. Wai. After two quick postdoctoral programs at Syracuse University (under the mentorship of Dr. Jon Zubieta) and Washington University in St. Louis (supervised by Professor Michael J. Welch), Dr. Chen joined the University of Southern California as an Assistant Professor of Radiology. He then moved to Stanford University in 2004 to help build the Molecular Imaging Program at Stanford (MIPS) under the directorship of Professor Sanjiv Sam Gambhir, and was promoted to Associate Professor in 2008. In the summer of 2009, he joined the Intramural Research Program of the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering (NIBIB) as a tenured Senior Investigator. Dr. Chen also holds a joint appointment with the NIH Clinical Center. LOMIN specializes in synthesizing molecular imaging probes for Positron Emission Tomography, Single-photon emission computed tomography, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, optical (bioluminescence, fluorescence and Raman), contrast enhanced ultrasound, photoacoustic imaging, as well as multimodality imaging. This research group aims to develop molecular imaging toolbox for better understanding of biology, early diagnosis of disease, monitoring therapy response, and guiding drug discovery/development. LOMIN puts special emphasis on high-sensitivity nanosensors for biomarker detection and theranostic nanomedicine for imaging, gene and drug delivery, and monitoring of treatment. Dr. Chen has published over 500 peer-reviewed papers (H-index = 95, total citations > 35,000 based on Google Scholar) and numerous books and book chapters. He is the founding editor of journal “Theranostics” (2014 IF = 8.022).
