Since the Mishnah is a code of law, its textual style is very concise and lacking in socio-historical background. While some scholarly attempts have been made to understand the meaning of the Mishnah and some attempts have been made to sketch the biographies of the authorities the Mishnah mentions (by referring to talmudic and midrashic sources, for example) Mishnat Eretz Yisrael is the only complete commentary to the Mishnah that uses socio-historical evidence of the time to provide context for the Mishnah's laws.

He is also known for some of his belligerent comments to hide the real military strength of China. The best-known instance was his dramatical denial of the existence of the Chinese stealth fighter J-20 by exaggerating the American technological advantages. In contrast, he also sometimes expresses a low opinion of U.S. military capabilities, with his 2012 assertion that the U.S. would \"run like a rabbit\" if China went to war with Japan over the Diaoyu Islands being an example. He also suggested that the PLAN might equip civilian fishing boats for suicide attacks against the United States Navy. Predictions Zhaozhong is known for his CCTV commentaries where he has, among other things, said that smog is a good thing for China because it would obscure US laser weapon systems in the event of an attack  Zhang also publicly predicted at various points \"...the U.S. military could not take Baghdad in 2003, hours before U.S. troops marched into Saddam Hussein’s palace; that Libyan rebels could not find Moammar Gadhafi in 2011 as the dictator was being dragged out of his hideout; that Chinese seaweed farmers’ nets in the Yellow Sea could deter U.S. nuclear submarines from approaching; that Chinese fishing vessels could destroy the U.S. Navy’s 10,000-ton Zumalt-class destroyer.\""

He also serves as the chairman of the Myanmar Football Federation. He is also an AFC Exco Member and the Chairman of AFC Organising Committee for Youth Competition. He reportedly had close ties to key figures from the former ruling military junta, the State Peace and Development Council, including Maung Aye and Than Shwe's grandson Nay Shwe Thway Aung. Through his relationships, he is believed to have won concessions and import licenses, including most of the country's car and motorcycle import licenses, as well as import and distribution licenses for fuel. His company won several bids to construct Naypyidaw, the country's new capital, including a stadium for the 2013 Southeast Asian Games. But his attempt to enter the Singaporean stock market as an international businessman by bidding over Aussino Group Ltd. was not successful. He is blacklisted by the United States, being one of around 200 individuals and companies that have had sanctions against doing business with them imposed, under a Specially Designated Nationals (SDN) List regulated by the U.S. Treasury. The sanctions remain in place despite Myanmar's military junta no longer being on power. Singaporean stock market regulators were concerned at this and rejected the bid in January 2013. In the early 1990s, he lived in Japan, and returned in 1994. The following year, in 1995, he established Max Myanmar.  Annual revenue of Max Myanmar Group was about US $500 million in early 2010s."

He is best known for using classical biochemistry to discover new pathways and mechanisms in innate immunity and cell signaling. His scientific contributions include the discovery of a proteasome-independent role of ubiquitin in protein kinase activation, the discovery of MAVS (Mitochondrial Anti-Viral Signaling protein) and the role of mitochondria in antiviral innate immune responses, and the more recent discoveries of the cytosolic DNA sensor, Cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS; cGAMP synthase), and a new second messenger, Cyclic guanosine monophosphate–adenosine monophosphate (cyclic GMP-AMP, cGAMP), which play key roles in immune defense as well as autoimmune diseases. He has won numerous distinctions for his scientific contributions including the Norman Hackerman Award in Chemical Research, The Edith and Peter O’Donnell Award in Science, and the National Academy of Sciences Award in Molecular Biology.

  "text" : "Zoubeir Turki (1924 – 23 October 2009) was a Tunisian painter and sculptor of Turkish origin. He is the younger brother of Hedi Turki. Born in the Medina of Tunis to a family of Turkish origin, Turki studied at the University of Ez-Zitouna and the Institute for Advanced Studies, while taking classes at the Tunis Institute of Fine Arts in Tunis. In 1946, he held a position in the administration before being recruited by French schools to teach Arabic. In 1952, he was forced into exile for having participated in the actions of the Tunisian nationalist movement Neo-Destour. He settled in Sweden, from 1953 to 1958, where he joined the Academy of Fine Arts in Stockholm. He went back to Tunisia in 1958, two years after the country's independence where he resumed contact with the School of Tunis which he was a founding member of and served as senior official in the Ministry of Culture. His administrative and political associations continued to increase, he became the President of several associations and unions, including the National Union of plastic and graphic arts, the Cultural Commission of the city of Tunis, and the Union of Plastic Artists Arab Maghreb. He founded and directed the Center for Living Art and the Belvedere; furthermore, on the political front, he was elected to the National Assembly in 1979 and a municipal councilor for the city of Tunis. Turki paintings drew its inspiration in matters of Tunisian culture and its traditions, portraying characters and scenes of everyday Tunis. Building a collective memory of Tunisia made his work a unique style which earned him international recognition. The critical Louati Ali said in a book dedicated to modern art that Turki is undoubtedly the most popular artist in the history of the artistic movement in Tunisia. Turki was also a sculptor; he made the bronze statue of Ibn Khaldun, erected on Avenue Habib Bourguiba, where the School of Tunis was founded in 1949. He also created the fresco in the lobby of the House of Tunisian radio. Turki died at the age of 85."

He is notable as one of the most important representatives of Jadidism and the organizer of one of the first Jadidi madrasah. Born in 1833 in the village of Sharip in Verkheuralsk province, Orenburg Governorate (these days in the Uchalinsky District, Republic of Bashkortostan, Russia) to the family of mullah of the local Islamic community.Received instruction in a medrese in his home village, then in the medrese in Troitsk. Upon instruction, began a clerical career. Since 1858, served as Imam khatib in the village of Yuldash (currently in Uchalinsky District, Bashkortostan) . While still in his student years, Zaynulla became interested in Sufism. In 1859, he joined the Sufi order of Naqshbandi. Received individual instruction from sheikh Ahmed Ziyaüddin Gümüşhanevi in Istanbul in 1869—1870, from whom received the Ijazah, or the authorization to teach Sufi Naqshbandi’s doctrine. Made a hajj. After returning to Bashkortostan, introduced several innovations into the local Sufi practices: singing zikr aloud, the observance of Mawlid, (the birthday of the Islamic prophet Muhammad), wearing prayer beads etc. Endured persecution for preaching Sufizm: the local conservative mullahs and the officials of mainstream Islam accused him of disseminating heresy and undermining activity aiming at the authorities in power. Upon their written denunciation, Zaynulla Rasulev got arrested and sent to exile. Served his exile successively in Zlatoust (eight months), Nikolsk, Vologda Oblast (1873-1876) and Kostroma (1876-1881). In 1881, he returned from exile and resumed his activity as a religious leader in the village of Aqquzha in Bashkortostan. He did a second hajj. Since 1884, Rasulev took the post of the Imam of the town mosque in Troitsk. He subsequently founded the madrasah of Rasuliya, one of the first jadidi educational institution in the Urals. He had numerous disciples and followers, and became a most influential Muslim leaders in Russia. Zaynulla Rasulev died on February 2, 1917. He is buried in the old Muslim cemetery in Troitsk. Numerous legends are preserved in the Bashkir public memory about the miracles and healings performed by Zaynulla Rasulev. His son, Gabdurakhman Rasulev, also became a Bashkir religious leader."

During his hammer throwing career Bezjak had a strong rivalry with Krešimir Račić, with Bezjak winning the Yugoslav title in 1956, 1958, 1960 and 1963 and Račić in 1954, 1955, 1957, 1959, 1961, 1962 and 1964.

  "text" : "Zozo Zarpa (Ζωζώ Ζάρπα) (1942 – April 19, 2012) was a Greek television, film and stage actress. Zarpa studied at the National Theatre of Greece Drama School. She began her acting career by performing on stage in Ancient Greek dramatic plays. In addition to her long film and theater credits, Zarpa founded the Themelion theatre, and co-founded a Greek drama school with her Elda Dimopoulos (her sister) and Yannis Negrapontis. She achieved a degree of fame in the United States in 2010 and 2011 when she appeared in a television commercial campaign for Kraft Foods' Athenos brand of hummus and Greek yogurt. The ad campaign developed by Droga5, which was the first ever for the Athenos brand, featured the tagline, \"Approved by Yiayia.\" The commercials were shot and cast in Greece, leading Zarpa's role as one of the Yiayias, or Greek grandmothers. In Zarpa's commercial, her Yiayia character asks a young, cohabiting couple if they were married. When the couple says no, Yiayia immediately tells them that they are going to hell. The spot earned Zarpa new fans throughout the United States and Greece. As of 2012, her Athenos commercial had received more than 1,200,000 hits on YouTube."

  "text" : "Zachary \"Zack\" Sawyer Kopplin (born July 20, 1993) is an American political activist, journalist, and television personality from Louisiana. Kopplin has campaigned to keep creationism out of public school science classrooms and been involved with other separation of church and state causes. He has opposed school vouchers because they provide public money to schools which may teach creationism. As a high school student, he organized seventy-eight Nobel laureate scientists in a campaign against the Louisiana Science Education Act, a creationism law. He is also involved with science funding policy and curriculum and textbook policy. His new campaign calls for a launching Second Giant Leap for Humankind, calling for Barack Obama to invest $1 trillion in research and education. Kopplin has been interviewed on HBO's Real Time with Bill Maher, where Bill Maher noted, on the show, that Kopplin was the youngest guest ever to appear on his show. MSN.com called Kopplin the Doogie Howser of political activists. Kopplin has been featured by numerous international media outlets that include Vogue, Mashable, The New York Times, the Washington Post, io9, Slate, the Huffington Post, Moyers and Company, MSNBC, NPR, and Public Radio International. Kopplin is a columnist for The Guardian."

  "text" : "Zita Szeleczky (20 April 1915 – 12 July 1999) was a Hungarian stage and film actress. She was discovered by the film studios in 1938 and soon became one of the most popular screen stars, performing in about 30 films between 1938-1944, mostly musical comedies. She was active in war effort and gave many patriotic recitals during the last days of the WW II, when the Soviet troops were already capturing Budapest. As Hungary was taken, she had to fake her own suicide and flee the country, where she in fact was sentenced to prison in absentia by the pro-soviet authorities. She spent years in Italy (where she had also starred in a film), Argentina and USA, but her film career was sadly never revived, even though she remained popular on concert stage. As the political climate changed, she returned to Hungary in 1988. In 1993 the Superior Court of Hungary exonerated Ms. Szeleczky, stating that the 1947 conviction was based on fabricated charges. She was awarded the Cross of the Hungarian Republic. Miss Szeleczky died in 1999. The Hungarian Postal Service issued a stamp commemorating the 100th anniversary of this beautiful actress and singer in 2015. An article, written by a Hungarian emigree György Lázár in the USA, held the Hungarian Postal Service accountable for issuing a stamp with 'a fascist'. The article blames the actress for her involvement in the Hungarista movement and overlooks her status as a screen legend. Miss Szeleczky never agreed to those accusations, seeing herself as an entertainer who strove to boost the morale of the troops, performing at the front and in hospitals for the wounded soldiers. Moreover, there were Hungarian actresses who were great stars in Nazi Germany (notably Marika Rökk and Clara Tabody) and who participated in propaganda films throughout the war; yet they never had to face charges for their political activity, continued their film careers after the war and are still admired and recognized today as major screen stars of the past."

Kliszko graduated from Warsaw University and joined the Polish Communist Party in 1931.
