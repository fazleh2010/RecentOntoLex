She made copies of the letters into an eight-by-six-and-a-half-inch book (20 cm × 17 cm) in order to improve her penmanship, making the accounts a sort of diary as well. This diary, edited by 19th-century American historian and author Alice Morse Earle, was published in 1894 under the title Diary of Anna Green Winslow, A Boston School Girl of 1771, and has never gone out of print. It provides a rare window into the life of an affluent teenage girl in colonial Boston."

  "text" : "Anna Nahowski (1860–1931) was the mistress of Franz Joseph of Austria from 1875 until 1888. She was from the age of fourteen married to the silk manufacturer Heuduck, who was heavily indebted by gambling and alcoholism. She met Franz Joseph at a walk in the park of Schönbrunn. The relationship was arranged between Anna and Franz Joseph without the knowledge of her spouse. Franz Joseph visited her discreetly and regularly while her husband was away. The paternity of her issue is uncertain, but her daughter Helena is believed to have been the emperor's, and her husband's debts were paid. This arrangement continued also after she remarried the decadent Franz Nahowski. In 1889, Nahowski discovered that Franz Joseph was in parallel involved, and this time more publicly, with Katharina Schratt, which made Franz Joseph end the relationship to Nahowski. Anna Nahowski was given economic compensation for both herself and her children in exchange for signing a contract of silence. Her diary was published in 1976."

  "text" : "Arthur Motyer (December 15, 1925 – June 23, 2011) was a Canadian educator, playwright and novelist. Born in Hamilton, Bermuda, the son of building contractor and land developer Ernest Motyer and Edith Brunning, he was educated at Saltus Grammar School and later (1942–1945) studied English literature at Mount Allison University in Sackville, New Brunswick. In 1945, after graduation and short periods in the Canadian Army and the University of Toronto, he travelled to England on a Rhodes Scholarship where read English at Exeter College, studying under Nevill Coghill. His namesake uncle, Arthur John Motyer, had also been a Rhodes scholar from Bermuda (1905). Returning to Canada, from 1948 to 1950 he taught English and drama at the University of Manitoba and at then moved to the Eastern Townships of Quebec where he took a teaching position at Bishop's University, which he held for the next twenty years. Among his students there were the future novelist Michael Ondaatje and Scott Griffin, founder in 2000 of the Griffin Poetry Prize. Griffin has spoken about Motyer's influence on his attitude towards poetry: [Motyer] was able to convey the technical possibilities open to poetry that I had not fully understood. He showed me there was music within free verse that went beyond the confines of rhyming couplets or the metrical movement determined by various relations of long or short, accented or unaccented syllables. A whole new world opened up for me. In the 1960s, while director of the Dramatic Society at Bishop’s he led the development and realization of the Centennial Theatre there. Opening in 1967, Centennial Theatre has played a significant role in the cultural life of the Eastern Townships ever since. In 1970, he returned to his alma mater where he accepted the position of Purvis Professor of English and associate dean of faculty at Mount Alison University. Among other roles in Sackville, he was chair of the classical concert touring organization Debut Atlantic, founded Windsor Theatre and the Mount Allison Drama Program, and was the founding chair of Live Bait Theatre. He died in Sackville in 2011."

  "text" : "Assaf Shelleg (Hebrew: אסף שלג‎‎), is an Israeli musicologist and pianist, a senior lecturer of musicology at The Hebrew University of Jerusalem. He was previously the Schusterman Visiting Assistant Professor of Musicology and Jewish Studies in the Department of Religious Studies at the University of Virginia (2011–14), and had taught prior to that as the visiting Efroymson Scholar in the Jewish, Islamic & Near Eastern Languages and Cultures Department at Washington University in St. Louis (2009–11). Shelleg specializes in twentieth-century Jewish and Israeli art music and has published in some of the leading journals in both musicology and Israel Studies on topics ranging from the historiography of modern Jewish art music to the theological networks of Israeli art music. Shelleg's book, Jewish Contiguities and the Soundtrack of Israeli History, appeared in November 2014 with Oxford University Press. The book studies the emergence of modern Jewish art music in central and Western Europe (1910s-1930s) and its translocation to Palestine/Israel (1930s-1970s), exposing the legacies of European antisemitism and religious Judaism in the making of Israeli art music. Moving to consider the dislocation of modern Jewish art music the book examines the paradoxes embedded in a Zionist national culture whose rhetoric negated its pasts, only to mask process of hybridizations enchained by older legacies. Jewish Contiguities has recently won the 2015 Engle Prize for the study of Hebrew Music. Shelleg is also a regular musical contributor to Haaretz newspaper."

  "text" : "Alfons de Tous (died February 3, 1421) was president of the Generalitat of Catalonia 1396-1413, succeeding Miquel de Santjoan when the latter left Catalonia in 1396 to become a royal ambassador; Miquel de Santjoan did not return to live in the principality. During the Western Schism, he aligned with the Antipope Benedict XIII and the revived line of Avignon popes, and continued that support until the Council of Constance, when Ferdinand I of Aragon withdrew his support for Avignon, at which point Alfons tried unsuccessfully to convince Benedict to voluntarily renounce his claim to the papacy. Alfons began his ecclesiastical career as the rector of the church of Sant Mateu (Saint Matthew) in Tortosa. He next served the Benedict XIII as his ambassador to the Kingdom of Castile, and later became rector of the Church of Santa Maria del Pi in Barcelona, from which position he was appointed a deputy to the Corts of Barcelona, the Catalan parliament. On December 3, 1400, as president of the Corts of Barcelona, he purchased the original portion of what then became the Palau de la Generalitat de Catalunya for 38,500 sous. Alfons became the first president of the Generalitat of Catalonia to live there. Subsequently to serving at Santa Maria del Pi, he became a canon of the Cathedral of Barcelona and, eventually, auditor of the Pia Almoina, the charitable fund of the cathedral. In 1408 King Martin of Aragon (\"Martin the Humane\") proposed him as bishop of Barcelona, but the Pope named Francisco de Blanes instead. Martin successfully exerted pressure to have him named bishop of Elne; in 1410, he was transferred to serve as bishop at Vic, where in 1417 he decreed that every parish must maintain a register of baptisms. His activities in the role of ecclesiastical deputy to the Generalitat required that he take part in the parliamentary discussion of the succession after Martin's death in 1410. The new king Ferdinand I was from the House of Trastámara, which already ruled Castile, so his selection as king brought Aragon and Castile under the same dynastic house. Subsequently, Alfons presided over the Corts of Montblanc (1414). In both of these parliamentary assemblies as well as in the Corts of Sant Cugat-Tortosa (1419), he tried, with little success, to influence the new Trastámara king to continue the policies of the earlier line of Aragones monarchs."

  "text" : "Alexander Forrester was a Presbyterian clergyman and educationist; b. 1805 in Scotland; d. 20 April 1869, buried at Truro, Nova Scotia. He was a member of the North British Society. He was a champion of free education in Nova Scotia. Forrester campaigned for better school books, compulsory city assessment, and teacher training. In 1854 he was asked to become superintendent of education. Forrester accepted the post the following winter after resigning the charge of Chalmers’ Church, and he also became principal of the projected provincial normal school. After decades of debate over the need for teacher training, the new co-educational normal school opened at Truro on 14 Nov. 1855 with about 60 students. From 1855 until 1863 Forrester was an instructor of natural science and the theory and practice of education for two terms at the normal school, and inspection of the province’s schools during the recesses in April and October, when he lectured on education and held teachers’ institutes. From 1858 to 1860 he edited, financed, and largely wrote the Journal of Education and Agriculture, for the province of Nova Scotia. In 1864–65 many of Forrester’s supported Charles Tupper’s legislation for free schools. He believed in the contribution of education to national improvement, prosperity, security, and morality. His conception of schooling and teacher training was closely patterned on David Stow’s ideas as embodied in the Glasgow Normal School. His enthusiasm for science, especially for horticulture and agriculture, explains his determination to establish a model experimental farm at the Truro institution; it foreshadowed a provincial agricultural college. Many of the expenses of the early years were borne by Forrester himself. Until his death he remained principal of the normal school, and worked at his natural history specimens and the organization of his normal school lectures into a manual for teachers, The teacher’s textbook (1867)."

After retiring from the ring, he worked as a hotel manager and as a boxing coach. Brown opened a photography business with his brother in 1945. He married Ola Atkey during the late 1930s. Brown was defeated by James Wilfrid Gardiner when he ran for reelection to the provincial assembly in 1956. He then became secretary for the provincial CCF.

Austin edited the Dominican bi-monthly journal entitled Doctrine and Life from 1958 to 1988. He also edited the Religious Life Review. He published many English language documents on the second vatican council. Fr Flannerys campaigning to end apartheid in South Africa, led to involvement with Kader Asmal, and the founding the Irish Anti-apartheid Movement, of which he served as chairman and president. In the late sixties his campaigning on behalf of the Dublin Housing Action Committee, due to its association with republicans and left wing activists, led him to being accused of being a communist. He was dismissed in the Dail by the then Minister for Finance, Charles Haughey, as a gullible cleric. He died of a heart attack aged 83 on October 21, 2008, and is buried in the Dominican plot in Glasnevin Cemetery."

  "text" : "Adama Amanda Ndiaye is a Senegalese fashion designer. She also goes by the name Adama Paris, which is also the name of the label she owns and operates. Her pieces, which are manufactured in Morocco, can be found internationally, including in New York City, Tokyo, London and Paris. Ndiaye was born in Kinshasa, Zaire, to Senegalese parents, then raised in Europe, where her parents were diplomats. She left a banking career in Europe to pursue fashion design in her native country. Africa had a long history of design but struggled for mainstream acceptance, and raising capital for her business was difficult. In order to expand the visibility of African design, Ndiaye created the Dakar Fashion Week exhibition. By 2012, the tenth year of the show, it attracted thirty designers from nine countries in Africa and Asia, with audience members coming from around the world, and had an operating budget of more than CFA 80 million (about US$150,000). She has also organized Black Fashion Week events in Prague, Czech Republic, and Bahia, Brazil. Her designs are inspired by cities and globalism. In an interview with Vogue Italia, she stated, \"Much of my inspiration come from the big cities... My aim was and still is sharing with all modern women one fashion without borders.\" Ndaiye has noted that among many African nations, religious objections have made designers unable to practice their profession. She credits the generally tolerant culture of Senegal for providing a supportive environment. She has also spoken out, with other African designers, for increased funding and access to credit from governments in order to foster innovation and job creation in the fashion industry."

  "text" : "Anar Bayramli (born c. 1981) is an Azerbaijani journalist for Iran's Fars News Agency and Sahar television station. In June 2012, an Azerbaijan court sentenced him to two years' imprisonment on a charge of drug possession. Bayramli's family and several human rights organizations have described the charges as politically motivated. Amnesty International designated him a prisoner of conscience. Bayramli's arrest came in a year of growing tension between Azerbaijan and Iran. Iran accused Azerbaijan of assisting in the assassination of nuclear scientists, and withdrew its ambassador following complaints by Iranian religious leaders over Azerbaijan's hosting of Eurovision 2012. Both countries accused the other of interfering in their domestic affairs. Azerbaijani authorities had recently criticized Sahar TV, for which Bayramli is a reporter, for \"deliberately seeking to destabilize the country\". Prior to the arrest, Bayramli had twice been brought to the police station for questioning. He later stated that the police officers pressured him to quit his job with Iranian media. On 17 February 2012, he was again brought to the police station for questioning. After fifteen minutes of questioning, police searched his coat, which had been left unattended in a waiting room. They found a parcel which Bayramli stated he did not recognize containing 0.387 grams of heroin, and Bayramli was charged with drug possession. An Iranian embassy official denounced the charge, calling Bayramli \"a devout, respectable person\" and warning the arrest could worsen relations between the countries. Bayramli was convicted on 12 June 2012 and sentenced to two years' imprisonment. Several international human rights organizations have questioned the charges against Bayramli. Amnesty International described the charges against him as \"politically motivated; trumped up by Azerbaijan’s secular authorities in order to silence their coverage of religious issues\". The organization designated him a prisoner of conscience and urged his immediate release. The Committee to Protect Journalists called the charges \"trumped-up\", comparing the case to that of Eynulla Fatullayev and stating that \"silencing government critics by planting drugs on them is a favored method of authorities in Azerbaijan.\" Human Rights Watch called for an independent investigation into Bayramli's possible framing. In approving the decision to release imprisoned journalist Bakhtiyar Hajiyev on 4 June 2012, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe stated that it hoped Bayramli also would soon be freed."

  "text" : "Annie Seel (born 5 September 1968) is a Swedish-born motorcyclist who set a world altitude record for climbing to Mount Everest base camp on a motorcycle. Seel climbed to 5,305 m (17,405 ft), breaking the existing unofficial record by more than 50 m (160 ft), using a 20-year-old Honda XL250 fitted with ice tires. This limitation was due to the Nepalese government's ban on the importation of new motorcycles to Nepal. Previously known as an enduro racer and a leading female competitor in the Paris-Dakar Rally, Seel was awarded the Swedish \"Adventurer of The Year\" award in 2005 for being the first woman to compete in the 500-mile (800 km) TSCO Vegas to Reno desert motorcycle race, where she finished as the fifth highest amateur and was FIM first \"Ride Green\" woman eco-enduro champion in a race for electric motorcycles supporting environmentally responsible motorsports racing. During the 2010 Dakar Rally, Seel crashed into a 16 ft (4.9 m) deep tomb but continued to complete the race. She also competed in the world’s first electric grand prix \"TTXGP 2010\" at Snetterton Motor Racing Circuit in the UK, riding the Morris Motorcycles Racing team's Mavizen TTX02 machine."

  "text" : "Agostino Lo Piano Pomar (Caltanissetta, August 24, 1871 – Caltanissetta, July 17, 1927) was a Sicilian lawyer, socialist and politician. He was one of the national leaders of the Fasci Siciliani (Sicilian Leagues) a popular movement of democratic and socialist inspiration in 1891-1894. He was a tireless organizer of sulfur miners in the Caltanissetta area battling for higher wages and improved working conditions. He became the leader of the Fascio dei lavoratori (Workers League) of Caltanissetta that was founded on March 18, 1893. Lo Piano Pomar was among the 500 delegates from nearly 90 leagues and socialist circles at the Congress of the Fasci that was held in Palermo on May 21–22, 1893. A Central Committee was elected, composed of nine members: he was elected for the province of Caltanissetta. The Congress decided that all Leagues were obliged to join the Party of Italian Workers (Partito dei Lavoratori Italiani, the initial name of the Italian Socialist Party). In 1903 he was one of the leaders of the Lega di miglioramento (League of improvement) and actively involved in the large strikes in the Trabonella and Gessolungo sulfur mines when the industry was declining. He was elected in the Italian Chamber of Deputies in November 1913 for Caltanissetta, and re-elected in December 1919 and June 1921. He remained in the Chamber until January 25, 1924. He was under-secretary for Industry and Trade under Prime Minister Francesco Saverio Nitti and under-secretary of Education under Luigi Facta, the last Prime Minister for Italy before the takeover of Benito Mussolini."

Thorold was born in or before 1520, the eldest son of William Thorold (died 1569) and Dorothy, daughter of Thomas Leke of Halloughton, Nottinghamshire. He was admitted to Gray's Inn in 1537, becoming Recorder of Grantham soon after 1550, which he probably held until his death. With the support of Henry Manners, 2nd Earl of Rutland, he became the Member (MP) of the Parliament of England for Grantham in 1558. The following year, again with Rutland's support, he became Recorder of Lincoln (which he resigned in 1570) and was elected MP for Lincoln. He was Sheriff of Lincolnshire between 1571 and 1572 and was appointed a Deputy Lieutenant by 1584. He was knighted in 1585. He married Margaret, daughter of Henry Sutton of Wellingore, and they had four sons and two daughters including Thomas (died 1574) and William (died by 1594). After Margaret's death, he married Anne, widow of George Babington and daughter and coheir of Sir John Constable of Kinoulton, Nottinghamshire. They had one daughter, Winifred. Thorold died on 26 June 1594 and was buried at the church in Marston."

  "text" : "Alexander Leydenfrost (Baron Sandor Leidenfrost) (March 18, 1888 in Debrecen – June 1961) was a Hungarian-born American industrial designer and illustrator. He was a baron in the Austro-Hungarian monarchy, with his family title dating back to the 16th century. Upon moving to America in the 1920s Leydenfrost altered the spelling of his name in an attempt to correct the mispronunciation of his name, and also changed his name from Sandor to the American equivalent, Alexander. Leydenfrost studied at the Royal Academy of Fine and Applied Arts of Budapest. In 1919, he was appointed as a professor of 'industrial design' at the Royal Joseph Technical University, also in Budapest. Middle European financial and ethical collapse forced him to emigrate to the United States in 1923 where he began working for the well known artist-illustrator William Andrew Pogany, designing stage sets and painting large murals, as well as being a featured regular in Magazine publications. In 1929, Leydenfrost went to work for world-renowned Industrial Designer Norman Bel Geddes, developing Toledo Scale designs and also the re-design of the Chrysler Airflow. He was also involved with the design of the 1939 World's Fair Pavilion for General Motors. In 1939 Leydenfrost turned from his career as an industrial designer to that of a professional illustrator-artist. He briefly worked for the science fiction magazine Planet Stories before being signed by Life magazine. Life needed someone who could illustrate unfolding events in Europe, and Leydenfrost's photo-realistic style filled the need. He continued to illustrate for Life throughout his career, in addition to other major magazines including Skyways, Liberty, Look, Popular Science and Esquire. Despite the small body of work he created for Planet Stories, many science fiction enthusiasts consider his artwork for that magazine to be that publication's finest."

As of the 1867 Alaska Purchase, the territorial residents were all citizens of the United States. Her 1944 challenge to segregation practices was cited during the Territorial Legislature's proceedings in passage of Alaska's 1945 anti-discrimination law. It was part of the Civil Rights Movement in the United States. A decade later in 1955, Rosa Parks in Alabama sparked a public bus boycott by refusing to give up her seat to a white person. In 1954, the Brown v. Board of Education decision outlawed segregation in public schools."

  "text" : "Alfred Edwin Brain Jr. (born London, 24 October 1885; died Los Angeles, 29 March 1966) was an English player of the French horn. He came from a family which included many famous horn players, including his nephew, Dennis Brain who became perhaps the most famous horn player of all time. His father, Alfred Edwin Brain Sr. was a well-known horn player. Alfred started to learn the trumpet when he was six, but when he was twelve he changed to the French horn and learned from his father. He studied at the Royal Academy of Music with Adolf Borsdorf and also learned the piano from G.D.Cunningham who was to teach his nephew the organ some forty years later. His first professional job was with the Scottish Orchestra. He then played in the Queen’s Hall Orchestra and the London Symphony Orchestra. When World War I broke out he joined the Scots Guards. Later, in 1917, he did a lot of dangerous work in France where the fighting was taking place. After the war he was awarded the British War Medal and Victory Medal for his bravery. When he returned after the war he worked with several of the London orchestras, including Covent Garden where he played for Sir Thomas Beecham. His brother Aubrey, also an excellent horn player, returned from the war after him. By this time Alfred had got all the best horn jobs in London, so it was difficult for Aubrey to find jobs. In 1923 he emigrated to the United States. He played in the New York Philharmonic Orchestra and later for the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra. In his later years he recorded a lot in movie studios, including for 20th century Fox."

  "text" : "Auguste-Louis Bertin d'Antilly (1763–1804) was a French dramatist and journalist whose patriotic songs and topical libretti were prominent during the French Revolution, but who emigrated from France under Napoleon. Bertin d'Antilly possessed the sinecure of premier Commis des Finances au département des revenus casuels du Roi, and thus was a pensioner of Louis XVI of France. In 1783 his one-act L'Anglais à Paris was a comedy without overt political content, and his two-act comedy L'école de l'adolescence was played in June 1789; but that same year, as \"Citoyen B. Dantilly\" he wrote the libretto for Pierre-David-Augustin Chapelle's opéra comique, that is, with spoken rather than sung dialogue, La Vieillesse d’Annette et Lubin based on a story by Jean-François Marmontel: at the third act finale, peasants armed with their tools face the seigneurial regime in defiance. His \"Ode à l'Être Suprême\" (Paris, 1794) reflects the Revolutionary Cult of the Supreme Being. Patriotic sentiments were to the fore in his libretto for La prise de Toulon par les français : opéra en trois actes, mêlés de prose, de vers et de chants, which celebrated the Siege of Toulon, an early Republican victory over a Royalist rebellion in the southern French port of Toulon, 18 December 1793. After the revenge assassination in January 1793 of Le Peletier de Saint Fargeau, who had cast the deciding vote for the execution of Louis XVI, Bertin d'Antilly provided the libretto to a two-act trait historique, Le Peletier de Saint-Fargeau, ou Le premier martyr de la République française, with music by Frédéric Blasius. Under the Directoire Bertin d'Antilly abandoned his Jacobin views and moved to the political right. In 1797 he began to publish a daily journal of social and political commentary, Le Thé, ou Le journal des dixhuit, which ran from 16 April, under the epigraph \"Je vois de loin; j'atteins de même\"; it dropped its subtitle, ostensibly referring to eighteen editors, in favor of the subtitle Le contrôleur général. It was suppressed 18 fructidor An V (5 September 1797) in connection with the counter-revolutionary Coup of 18 Fructidor; earlier that year the Imprimerie du The that printed the journal had printed his \"Disgrâce des triumvirs: chanson constitutionnelle\", a commentary on disunion among the members of the French Directory. Some years later, a journal under the same title appeared, but Bertin d'Antilly had no part in its redaction. Firmly opposed to Napoleon, he had taken up residence at Hamburg, where he published the journal Le Censeur in collaboration with the emigré M. de Romance, chevalier de Mesmont; when Napoleon put diplomatic pressure on the Hamburg Senate, they were arrested, then released when the Comte d'Artois convinced the Russians to intervene on their behalf."

The book won the 1940 $10,000 fiction novel prize from the Atlantic Monthly. The Family tells the story of an exiled White Russian family in Tianjin, China. Born Antonina Fedorovna Podgorinova in Lokhvytsia, Ukraine in 1895, she moved to Verkhneudinsk (now known as Ulan-Ude) after her father's death and mother's remarriage. She left for Harbin in China shortly before the 1917 revolution, and married historian Valentin Riasanovsky in 1923. The Riasanovskys ended up in Tianjin herself in 1936, though she claimed The Family was not autobiographical. The Riasanovskys came to the United States and moved to Eugene, Oregon in 1938, where Antonina taught Russian literature at [the University of Oregon]. A sequel to The Family, The Children, was published in 1942. Her last novel, Life, was written in Russian. She also translated her first two novels into Russian, and published a book of plays for children in 1964. Riasanovsky and her husband had two sons. Nicholas V. Riasanovsky was a leading scholar of Russian history. She died in Oakland, California in February 1985."

The three won a gold medal at the 2011 World Cup event in Hyères, France by beating Barkow's crew 3–0 in the final. Lush was selected to compete for Great Britain at the 2012 Summer Olympics in the newly created Elliott 6 metres match-racing event. She competed alongside sisters Lucy and Kate MacGregor. Together the three are nicknamed the \"Match Race Girls\".

She is formerly professor of literature and faculty director of the Center for Writing and Public Discourse at Claremont McKenna College. Bilger holds a B.A. in Philosophy from Oklahoma State University and an M.A. and Ph.D. in English from the University of Virginia. As a graduate student at the University of Virginia, she was the Program Coordinator of the Women’s Center and a DJ at the college radio station, WTJU, Charlottesville. From 1992 to 1994, she was a visiting assistant professor of English at Oberlin College. Bilger currently serves on the Ms. Magazine Committee of Scholars and is the Gender and Sexuality Section Editor of The Los Angeles Review of Books. She is on the editorial boards of Pickering and Chatto's Gender and Genre Series and The Burney Journal. Bilger’s work focuses on comedy, Jane Austen, the English novel, feminist theory, popular culture, and gender and sexuality. In addition to her traditional academic writing, she has written for The Los Angeles Times, The Paris Review, The Women’s Review of Books, The Los Angeles Review of Books and ROCKRGRL. Bilger is a regular contributor to Bitch magazine, Ms. Magazine and the Ms. Blog, where she frequently covers issues pertaining to same-sex marriage and LGBT rights. In her book on Jane Austen and her contemporaries, Laughing Feminism, Bilger coined the term \"Enlightenment feminist humor\" to identify a tradition of anti-patriarchal satire and comedy that begins in the late seventeenth century and continues through Austen and beyond. Enlightenment feminist humor mocks the idea that men are superior to women and promotes a more egalitarian gender system. Bilger’s most recent book, Here Come the Brides! Reflections on Lesbian Love and Marriage, co-edited with Michele Kort (Seal Press, 2012), is a collection of essays, stories and visual images that takes a “multidimensional look at how opening up the traditional order of ‘man and wife’ to include the possibility of ‘wife and wife’ is altering our social landscape.\"  In a December 2009 radio interview Bilger asserted that advocates of same-sex marriage should begin to emphasize positive changes, instead of being afraid to say that same-sex marriage does not change anything about the institution of marriage. Bilger has written extensively on the legal battle regarding same-sex marriage and has covered the Proposition 8 trial in California for Ms. On August 12, 2010, she was a guest on Warren Olney’s To the Point and discussed the feminist implications of Judge Vaughn Walker’s historic ruling on the unconstitutionality of Proposition 8. Bilger is married to Cheryl Pawelski, founder of Omnivore Recordings (Bilger came up with the company’s name), and she has consulted and offered project assistance on numerous records, such as The Band's A Musical History, Big Star's Keep an Eye on the Sky, and the growing Omnivore catalog."

He was also an actor in musical films of Andalusian folklore: He appeared in films such as La hija de Juan Simón (1935) and Suspiros de Triana (1955), becoming a film star for Filmófono and working with esteemed directors such as Luis Buñuel, which led to him being nicknamed “the nightingale of Andalusia”. Angelillo was one of the most outspoken advocates of the Republic, with communist ideologies. He fled to Oran and from there, accompanied by Sabicas, to Argentina, where he quickly gained immense popularity. He returned to Spain in the 1950s."

Gaikwad participated in Indian general election, 2014 from Satara (Lok Sabha constituency) as a representative of Mahayuti an alliance of Bharatiya Janata Party, Shiv Sena and Republican Party of India (A). In Maharashtra only 1 Lok Sabha ticket was allocated to Republican Party of India (A) by Mahayuti and this opportunity was given to Gaikwad because of his long association and contribution to Dalit moment. Gaikwad was contesting against Udayanraje Bhosale the premier candidate of Nationalist Congress Party. Gaikwad lost the election with huge margin and Udayanraje Bhosale was chosen as Member of Parliament of Satara (Lok Sabha constituency) whereas throughout Maharashtra the picture was different for Mahayuti candidates. Gaikwad's defeat in Lok Sabha was due to non polarization between the supporting parties and independent candidate given by Shiv Sena. Few of the Dalit speaker said that the defeat was due to caste politics. Gaikwad is still considered as a dominating and favourite Dalit leader among the masses of Satara and will play and important role in 2014 states election of Maharashtra."

  "text" : "Armand Gabriel Allard du Plantier (1753 - 9 Oct 1827) was a French cavalry officer who served in the American Revolutionary War as an aide-de-camp to General Lafayette. Armand was born in Voiron, France, the son of Joseph Antoine Guy Allard du Plantier (1721–1801) and Gabrielle Trenonay de Chanfrey. In 1781, he moved to Louisiana (New Spain), settling on the plantation of his uncle, Claude Trénonay, in the area of Pointe Coupee, Louisiana. He married his uncle's stepdaughter, Marie Augustine Gerard; the couple had six children, four of whom survived to adulthood. Marie Augustine died of yellow fever in 1799. In 1802 Duplantier remarried, to widow Constance Rochon Joyce, and the couple resided part of the time in their country house at Mount Magnolia plantation (which property today is within the city of Baton Rouge and owned by that city). Five more children were born of this union. Duplantier was disturbed by the 1794 slave revolt which occurred locally. It was called the Pointe Coupée Conspiracy and reminded him of the Haitian Revolution (1791-1804). He was a slave-owner and regretted that he had bought some Saint-Domingue slaves, but he did not want to sell them until they regained their value. Armand Duplantier helped to establish a college in Baton Rouge in 1822. A few years later, he was part of the delegation which welcomed the Marquis de Lafayette, during his American tour. In 1827, Duplantier, Fulwar Skipwith, Antoine Blanc, Thomas B. Robertson, and Sebastien Hiriart received permission from the Louisiana State Legislature to organize a corporation called the Agricultural Society of Baton Rouge. Armand Duplantier died the same year and was given military honors at his funeral, in tribute to his Revolutionary War service."

In 1938 he immigrated to the United States and married, founding and becoming the editor of The Knickerbocker. His two feature films, Pareh (1936) and Terang Boelan (1937), have been considered the most important films from the Dutch East Indies of the 1930s."

  "text" : "Anton Suryapin (born c. 1992) is a Belarusian photojournalist. On 13 July 2012, he was detained after publishing pictures of a protest by a Swedish advertising company in which teddy bears were airdropped into the country with slogans advertising freedom of speech. The teddy bears were dropped on 4 July 2012 by Studio Total, a Swedish advertising firm. The group called the mission \"Teddybear Airdrop Minsk 2012\". A plane piloted by Tomas Mazetti took off from a town near Kaunas, Lithuania, and illegally entered Belarusian airspace, proceeding over the town of Ivyanets. The group then released 1,000 teddy bears holding cards and banners with protest slogans. When the Belarusian government denied that the incident had taken place, Studio Total released 90 minutes of footage of the flight, which Radio Free Europe reported that they had confirmed with experts had not been doctored. On 26 July, Belarusian president Alexander Lukashenko acknowledged the drop had occurred as reported. Following the drop, Suryapin posted photographs on his website that he said had been e-mailed to him by an Ivyanets resident. On 13 July, his home was searched, his computer confiscated, and he was detained as an accomplice. On 19 July, Studio Total founder Per Cromwell published an open letter in which he stated that the group \"never told Anton Suryapin or indeed any other Belarus citizen in advance about what we planned to do. We love (respect) and admire them too much to expose them to such risks.\" The letter also called Lukashenko an \"armed clown\". On 24 July, Suryapin still had been not been released from prison, leading BBC News and other sources to conclude that charges had been filed against him, as Belarusian law only allows ten days of detention without charge. Amnesty International described the arrest as \"a further nail in the coffin of freedom of expression and association in Belarus\", and named Suryapin a prisoner of conscience. Index on Censorship described the case against Suryapin as \"ludicrous\", stating, \"Not for the first time, the authorities in Belarus have found someone to blame for something they say hasn’t happened.\" The Committee to Protect Journalists called the charges \"senseless\" and called for Suryapin's immediate release."

  "text" : "Atalante Migliorotti (Florence, 1466 - 1532) was an Italian Renaissance musician, instrument maker and assistant de Leonardo da Vinci. He was born of an illegitimate relationship. After being a pupil of Leonardo, who taught him music, he moved to Milan in 1482 to accompany his master. That same year, Vinci painted his portrait, which is probably lost today. In 1491, according to the wishes of Isabella d'Este, he sang the lead role in the opera on Orfeo presented at the carnival in Marmirolo. His skills as a luteplayer and lutemaker led in 1493, to Isabella d'Este commissioning a guitar and then in 1505 a lirone, or twelve-stringed lyre. He was also employed as coordinator of construction of St. Peter's Basilica."

He was also known for his advancement of a particular approach in the use of homeopathic medicines, known as dual remedy prescribing, after it was ostensibly dropped (though only publicly, not in private practice) by others, including Samuel Hahnemann, the founder of the homeopathic approach. His decision in 1865 to release a version of the much awaited, but long delayed publication of the last, 6th edition of Hahnemann's Organon der Heilkunst, which included a disputed paragraph created by Hahnemann for the 5th edition, but subsequently withdrawn for political reasons within the homeopathic medical community in Germany, resulted in a strong protest from more conventional homeopaths."

  "text" : "Abraham Katzir (Hebrew: אברהם קציר‎‎; born 1941 in Jerusalem, Israel) is a Professor of Physics at Tel Aviv University, holding the Carol and Mel Taub Chair in Applied Medical Physics. He is the son of Professor Aharon Katzir, also a scientist, who was killed in 1972 in Ben-Gurion Airport by Japanese terrorists. His uncle, Professor Ephraim Katzir, was the President of Israel. Abraham Katzir got his PhD from the Hebrew University in Jerusalem in 1974, and joined Caltech in Pasadena, California, as a Senior Research Fellow. In 1977 he established the Applied Physics Group at Tel Aviv University, which he heads. In the past, Prof. Katzir worked in some of the top research laboratories in the US. He was a Visiting Member of Staff at ATT Bell Laboratories in Summit, New Jersey, and he was a Visiting Professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and in Boston University, Boston, Massachusetts. Katzir is an expert in the fields of biomedical optics and fiber optics. His group at Tel Aviv University developed special fibers made of crystalline silver halides, which are among the few that are highly transparent in the middle-infrared (mid-IR). He and members of the group have been involved with research and development of new methods and new systems, based on these fibers. They made significant contributions to the use of mid-IR fibers for scientific, medical, industrial and environmental protection applications. In the course of this work, Katzir collaborated with leading scientists in major national laboratories, universities, research institutions and industrial companies, all over the world. Katzir supervised the research work of tens of students in MSc and PhD dissertations. He also published the book \"Lasers and Optical Fibers in Medicine\". Katzir is the Chair of ILEOS, the Israel Lasers and Electro Optics Society, and the Chair of the bi-annual international conferences that this society organizes in Israel. He has been a member of the Board of Governors of SPIE, the International Society for Optics and Photonics, a member of the board of IUPAP, the International Union of Pure and Applied Physics, and of other international bodies. He has organized and chaired tens of international symposia and conferences in the fields of biomedical optics, optical fibers, and electro-optics. Each year, Katzir organizes a series of popular lectures, called \"In the Crucible of Revolution\", in memory of his late father. Tens of thousands of people have attended these lectures."

Asad was a member of the Shayban tribe, dominant in the region of Diyar Bakr in the northern Jazira, and son of Yazid ibn Mazyad al-Shaybani, who served twice as Arab governor (ostikan) of Arminiya (a large province encompassing the whole of Transcaucasia). By 801, when his father died, Asad was governor of Mosul, and succeeded him as ostikan for about a year; he was in turn succeeded by his brother Muhammad. Asad was re-appointed as ostikan under Caliph al-Amin (r. 809–813) to confront an uprising of the Arab settlers in Iberia under Yahya ibn Sa'id and Ismail ibn Shu'ayb. Asad was successful in quelling the revolt and capturing its leaders, but he later pardoned and released them, and because of this was dismissed from his office."

  "text" : "Alfredo Guati Rojo Cárdenas (December 1, 1918 – June 10, 2003) was a 20th-century Mexican artist who worked to restore the reputation of watercolor painting as a true art form. His preference for the technique came from seeing Diego Rivera’s work and helping with a fresco mural in his hometown of Cuernavaca as a child. When he was 16, he went to Mexico City to study law, but switched to art. He learned the various classic art techniques but kept his preference for watercolor. His career began by teaching art, founding an art institute in the Colonia Roma section of Mexico City. In the 1950s, he tried to get the areas art galleries to show watercolors but they refused, considering it as a minor art form. He began to host exhibitions of watercolor works at his art institute with success which led to the formation of the Museo Nacional de la Acuarela or National Watercolor Museum in the 1960s. The museum remained in Colonia Roma until the 1985 Mexico City earthquake destroyed the building and led to it relocation to the Coyoacán borough where it remains. During this time, Guati Rojo also had a career showing and selling his own artwork, almost exclusively watercolors in various parts of the world. Most of his income from this painting went to support the museum."

  "text" : "Mathurin Auguste Balthasar Barbereau (born 14 November 1799 in Paris – 14 July 1879 ibid) was a French composer and music theorist. He entered the Conservatoire de Paris in 1810 and was awarded numerous times. He was awarded with the Prix de Rome in 1824 for his cantata Agnes Sorel, with text by Pierre-Ange Vieillard, publishing it shortly thereafter. He conducted many orchestras in several theaters, especially the Teatre Italià between 1836-38. Many times he replaced Anton Reicha, who had been his teacher in the class of composition of the Conservatory. Among his disciples are Ambroise Thomas and Ernest Guiraud. He wrote the score of the opera Les Sybarites de Florence, and took part in a variety of symphonies and concert works, but the real contribution of Barbereau is his theoretical work, among them his Traité d'harmonie Theoretical et pratique (1843-1845), considered the most important scientific work published hitherto on this subject. After this work he published a curious Etude sur l'origine du système musical (Paris, 1852), which gave rise to great controversy. Auguste Barbereau died suddenly in an omnibus in Paris, after he had been teaching at the Conservatory."

There he won a bronze medal in the 100m freestyle, silver behind Ukrainian Maksym Veraksa who set world records in both the 50m freestyle and 200m individual medley and broke the world record himself in winning the 100m backstroke. In October 2014 Russian newspaper Sovershenno Sekretno published an article claiming that Alexander's paralympic status is falsified. The article included a copy of Alexander's driving license, a copy of a police car incident report listing Nevolin-Svetlov as the driver, and the details of a 2013 bribery case against an ophtalmologist allegedly requesting a bribe from Nevolin-Svetlov for confirming the paralympic status."

  "text" : "Abraham Logan (August 13, 1816 - December 20, 1873) was the owner and editor of the Singapore Free Press. Also a prominent lawyer, having studied law in Edinburgh, Logan played a significant role in the historic transfrerral of the Straits Settlement to the Colonial Office. His father being Thomas Logan, Abraham Logan was born in Hutton Hall, Berwickshire, Scotland. Secretary to the Singapore Chamber of Commerce from 1850, until his retirement in 1868, Logan was pivotal in the changing of hands of the Straits Settlement. On April 1, 1867, the transfer was finally made, with a bit of help from allies in London. Living most of his life on Pleasant Mountain, Thomson Road, Logan later moved to Penang in 1869, after the death of his brother, James Richardson Logan. Resigning from most of his activities in Singapore, Logan died in Penang on December 20, 1873."

  "text" : "Antonio Besozzi (1714–1781) was an Italian oboist and composer and also member of an extensive family of musicians from the eighteenth-century Naples. He composed several concertos for oboe and a few quintets, which he called \"sonatas\", for two oboes, two horns and a bassoon. Besozzi was born in Parma, the son of oboist Giuseppe Besozzi and brother of Girolamo Besozzi. He was from 8 October 1727 to 1731 a member of the Ducal Guardia Irlandese, a hautboy band created in 1702 by Antonio Farnese, Duke of Parma. From 1734 he was active in Naples until the birth of his son Carlo Besozzi in 1738, when he left for Dresden to join the orchestra of the Royal Chapel and become its first oboist in 1739. In 1754 he was joined by his son and in the early 1757 they travelled to England, where they were known as the Signori Besozzi. In December of that same year they moved to Paris, where they played the Concert Spirituel. In the years 1758-59 he was at the service of the court of Stuttgart, under the direction of Niccolò Jommelli, after which they returned to Dresden until he resigned in 1774. His son continued to play until 1792 though. In May 1778 he played in Salzburg with his son, having been taken in high esteem by Leopold Mozart. He then returned to Dresden and after then to Turim, where he settled until his death in 1781."

  "text" : "Alfred Diamant (September 25, 1917 – May 11, 2012) was an American political scientist. His main contribution was in the field of comparative politics and comparative public administration. He was a member of the Comparative Administration Group (CAG) and a co-chairperson of the Council for European Studies based at Columbia University. According to Peter Alexis Gourevitch, Diamant was both “on the Executive Committee of the Council for European Studies (based in New York) and the Interuniversity Center for European Studies in Montreal.” Alfred Diamant was published by Princeton University Press and by top ranking journals like Administrative Science Quarterly, Comparative Political Studies, and PS. Political Science and Politics. (See List of publications) Diamant’s “areas of expertise” were “Comparative Western European Politics and Social Policy.” Together with his colleague, James Christoph, he “established Indiana University as a major site of the study of European culture, society and politics.” John D.Martz called the “works of Maurice Duvergier, Sigmund Neumann and Alfred Diamant” that focus on the study of political parties “Western European-oriented classics.” D.B. Robertson saw Alfred Diamant as “a gifted and humane scholar.” Alfed Diamant was born in Vienna, Austria, and came to the United States as a young man when the Fascists gained power in Germany and Austria. During WWII, he served in the U.S.army. He was married to Ann Diamant."

He graduated from Dhaka Medical College in 1976, and completed his Masters studies in Public Health (MPH) and Doctorate in Public Health (DrPH) from Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Baltimore, USA in 1985 and in 1990 respectively. Abdullah Baqui is a Public Health scientist who confirmed effectiveness of simple but effective strategies to reduce preventable newborn deaths. In last 3 decades, Dr. Baqui's research works confirmed: (a) the use of zinc supplementation during diarrhea to reduce the severity of child mortality. (b) the effectiveness of trained community health workers providing home based health care to reduce neonatal mortality by one-third. and (c) use of Hib vaccination in Bangladesh to reduce the incidence of meningitis and X-ray documented pneumonia in children. Each of these studies has resulted in influencing policy decisions. For example, WHO and UNICEF have now recommended the use of zinc as an adjuvant therapy for diarrheal episode. National Neonatal Health Strategy in Bangladesh has been developed in 2009. More recently a WHO-UNICEF joint statement recommends home visits by trained community health worker as a strategy to improve neonatal survival. Abdullah Baqui became a Professor in the Department of International Health in Bloomberg School of Public Health in Johns Hopkins University in 2009. In May 2012, the CORE Group honored Dr. Baqui with the Dory Storms Child Survival Recognition Award. Prof. Baqui also received 'Recognition Award' from Bangladesh Medical Association in North America."

  "text" : "Agnes Katherine Raymond Tuckey (née Daniell, 8 July 1877 – 13 May 1972) was an English tennis player. With Hope Crisp, she was the winner of the first Wimbledon mixed doubles in 1913. In 1906 she married Charles Orpen Tuckey who taught Mathematics at Charterhouse School. They played mixed doubles together. Among their children were Raymond and Kay who played in the Wightman Cup between 1949 and 1951. Agnes, when in her fifties, partnered Raymond in the mixed doubles in 1931 and 1932, the only instance of a parent and child teaming up at the championships. In the 1913 Wimbledon Championships, she won with Crisp the first mixed doubles final at Wimbledon in an unusual fashion - Ethel Thomson Larcombe was struck by a ball in the eye and unable to continue the match. The incident occurred when the second set was 5-3 for Crisp and Tuckey, the first having been won by the opposing pair of James Cecil Parke and Mrs Larcombe. In the 1914 Wimbledon Championships Crisp and Tuckey were the losing semi-finallists."

Born in Tarnawa-Góra, he was arrested on 4 December 1940 whilst trying to cross the border with Czechoslovakia to join the Polish Army in France and was then sent to Auschwitz where he laboured for I.G.Farben. After escaping from the camp with 9 other prisoners (13 died and 20 were recaptured), he hid in the forest and was sheltered in the attic of a house for 7 weeks in the village of Bojszowy. He then travelled under false documents to Silesia and Kraków, before becoming a soldier in the Armia Krajowa. On 9 November 1945 he made his debut as a stage actor in Kraków, performing with the Polish Theatre from Warsaw. He died of cancer, at age 90, on 29 July 2012 in Oswiecim, in a hospice he founded. He was married four times. He has two children, son Marek (born 1950), from his first marriage and son Marcin (born 1957), from his second marriage."

  "text" : "Andonios Liveralis (Greek: Αντώνιος Λιβεράλης or Λιμπεράλης, Italian: Antonio Liberali; 1814 in Corfu – 1842 in Corfu) was a Greek conductor and composer of the early Ionian school. He was the son of Italian conductor Domenico Liveralis and one of Nikolaos Mantzaros' favorite students. He later continued his studies at the Conservatory of San Pietro a Majella in Naples. When he returned to Corfu he was joyfully received into the circle of national composers, where he was considered a musician of great talent. He then began working as assistant to his teacher Mantzaros, who left him very little time for his own compositions. He was among the first teachers of his younger brother Iosif and served as vice director of music to the Philharmonic Society of Corfu. Liveralis' compositions are largely limited to minor forms. He wrote a series of fixed funeral marches, which were later published in two volumes. The march O Kambouris (Ο Καμπούρης, 'The Hunchback') achieved great popularity in Corfu. He also devoted himself to composing piano music and to the creation of a rich song repertoire. His one-act opera is the only sure finished work for the stage by the composer. He was born a Catholic, but was converted to Greek Orthodox faith and adopted the patriotic name of Eleftheriadis (Greek: Ελευθεριάδης). After his untimely death, he was buried in a magnificent funeral to which the orchestra of the Philharmonic Society of Corfu played."

  "text" : "Abel Seyler (23 August 1730, Liestal – 25 April 1801, Rellingen) was a Swiss-born banker, who later became one of the great theatre principals of 18th century Europe. He was \"the leading patron of German theatre\" in his lifetime, and is credited with introducing Shakespeare to a German language audience, and with promoting the concept of a national theatre in the tradition of Ludvig Holberg, the Sturm und Drang playwrights, and German opera. Already in his lifetime, he was described as \"one of German art's most meritorious men.\" The son of a Basel calvinist priest and descended from many of the city's leading patrician families, Seyler came to Northern Germany where he became a wealthy merchant and banker in Hamburg, who achieved notoriety for his speculation with financial instruments. After speculating heavily on currency debasement during the Seven Years' War in close association with his business partner Heinrich Carl von Schimmelmann, his companies went spectacularly bankrupt with enormous debts, but he nevertheless retained a portion of his fortune. His great passion was the theatre, and he used his remaining funds to finance and effectively head the Hamburgische Entreprise—also known as the Hamburg National Theatre—employing Lessing as the world's first dramaturg. In 1769, he founded the Seyler Theatre Company, which became one of the most famous theatre companies of Europe during the period 1769–79 and regarded as \"the best theatre company in Germany at that time.\" He commissioned works such as Sturm und Drang by Klinger (which gave its name to the era), Ariadne auf Naxos by Benda and Alceste by Schweitzer, considered \"the first serious German opera.\" Seyler became a freemason in London in 1753 and was a central figure in German freemasonry until his death. In his first marriage to Sophie Elisabeth Andreae, Seyler had three children, the pharmacist and scholar Abel Seyler the Younger, who was a member of the Illuminati, the Hamburg banker L.E. Seyler, the senior partner of Berenberg Bank for half a century, who married into the Hanseatic Berenberg/Gossler banking dynasty, and Sophie Seyler, who married the Sturm und Drang poet Johann Anton Leisewitz, the author of Julius of Tarent. His children were raised by his brother in law, the noted natural scientist J.G.R. Andreae. In his second marriage, Abel Seyler was married to Friederike Sophie Seyler, Germany's leading actress of the second half of the 18th century and the author of the opera Oberon, which inspired The Magic Flute. The principal founder of biochemistry and molecular biology Felix Hoppe-Seyler was an adopted son of his grandson. Abel Seyler was named for his great-grandfather, the Basel politician Abel Socin, who belonged to the Italian noble Socin family. He lived out his days on the Rellingen estate of his long-time friend and fellow prominent freemason, the renowned actor Friedrich Ludwig Schröder, where he is interred."

Some time before the war of her father against the Romans she married king Ariarathes IV of Cappadocia, who therefore supported his father-in-law in the battle of Magnesia (190 BC). However, Antiochus III lost the battle. Antiochis bore her husband a son, who was called Mithridates before his accession to the throne and succeeded his father as Ariarathes V of Cappadocia, and two daughters, among them Stratonice, who first married king Eumenes II of Pergamon and afterwards his brother and successor Attalus II Philadelphus. According to the questionable report of the ancient Greek-Sicilian historian Diodorus Siculus Antiochis, allegedly an unscrupulous woman, is supposed to have been barren and therefore to have foisted two sons called Ariarathes and Orophernes. Later she is said to have given birth to the above mentioned three children and to have told the truth to her husband. Thereupon she should have provided her foisted sons with sufficient money and sent the older one to Rome and the younger one to Ionia to make it possible for her legitimate son to succeed his father without difficulties."

  "text" : "Abisin Abbas ([aˈbisɪn aˈbas]; 26 February 1902 – 20 October 1961), better known by his pseudonym Andjar Asmara ([anˈdʒar asˈmara]), was a dramatist and filmmaker active in the cinema of the Dutch East Indies. Born in Alahan Panjang, West Sumatra, he first worked as a reporter in Batavia (modern-day Jakarta). He became a writer for the Padangsche Opera in Padang, where he developed a new, dialogue-centric style, which later spread throughout the region. After returning to Batavia in 1929, he spent over a year as a theatre and film critic. In 1930 he joined the Dardanella touring troupe as a writer. He went to India in an unsuccessful bid to film his stage play Dr Samsi. After leaving Dardanella in 1936, Andjar established his own troupe. He also worked at a publishers, writing serials based on successful films. In 1940 he was asked to join The Teng Chun's company, Java Industrial Film, helping with marketing and working as a director for two productions. After the Japanese occupation, during which time he stayed in theatre, Andjar made a brief return to cinema. He directed three films in the late 1940s and wrote four screenplays, which were produced as films in the early 1950s. He published a novel, Noesa Penida (1950). Afterward he worked for the remainder of his life writing serials based on local films and publishing film criticism. Historians recognise him as a pioneer of theatre and one of the first native Indonesian film directors, although he had little creative control of his productions."

Cukier's village depictions were mostly executed in graphics, for which she is best known, especially her stylistic color woodcuts. She also painted in oil and pastel, but there she dealt with her subjects in a more realistic style. Cukier studied painting at a private school run by Konrad Krzyżanowski, and since 1923 she continued her studies at the School for Fine arts in Warsaw, in Mieczysław Kotarbiński and Tadeusz Pruszkowski's classes. She also studied graphics at Edmund Czerwienski's studio. During those years she also frequented open air workshops in the Kazimierz Dolny art colony. She also visited the Krzemieniec art colony, located in the Wolyn region. Her landscapes with views of Kazimierz Dolny, Wiśniów, and Puck dominated her output and became popular, with some translated to woodcuts. Her work was exhibited in Warsaw in 1938 at the Art Promotion Institute. Some of her work had survived and is in demand partly for its rarity and partly for it charm. However, the great majority of her work was destroyed during World War II as was the case for many artists."

  "text" : "Arthur Lampkin (born circa 1938) is an English former professional motorcycle racer. The oldest son in a Yorkshire motorcycling dynasty, he competed in a variety of off-road motorcycle events such as observed trials, motocross and enduros. Born in Kent, England, Lampkin's father moved the family to Silsden, West Yorkshire in 1941. He began riding his father's BSA motorcycle even before he was old enough to have a licence. Lampkin purchased his first motorcycle from money he had earned from his paper route, and by the age of 18 he had won the British trials national championship. In the 1960s, he became a member of the BSA factory racing team along with his brother Alan. Lampkin, along with British riders such as Dave Bickers and Jeff Smith, were part of a group that dominated the sport of motocross in the early 1960s. In the 1961 European motocross championships, he finished the season in second place behind Bickers. The following year, the championship was upgraded to world championship status and Lampkin finished the year in third place behind Torsten Hallman and Jeff Smith. He was also a member of British motocross teams that won the Trophée des Nations events in 1961 and 1962, as well as the 1965 Motocross des Nations event. Lampkin continued to compete in other off-road motorcycle competitions, winning prestigious events such as the 1963 Scottish Six Days Trial, and the Scott Trial in 1960, 1961 and 1965. He also competed internationally in enduro events, representing Great Britain and earning a gold medal in the 1966 International Six Days Trial held in Sweden. Lampkin's younger brothers, Alan and Martin Lampkin also experienced success in motorcycle competitions. Alan won the British trials championship while Martin became a British trials champion as well as winning the 1975 FIM Trial World Championship. Lampkin's nephew, the son of Martin Lampkin, is twelve-time trials world champion, Dougie Lampkin. After retiring from competition, Lampkin took over his father's engineering business."

The building is still extant, but converted to offices. He also designed the Romanesque style, brick-built Church of St John & St Basil (1910–1911) in Heath Mill lane in the city's Digbeth district (52°28′37″N 1°52′53″W﻿ / ﻿52.4769°N 1.8813°W). It was described by Nicholas Pevsner as \"the finest example of his Arts and Crafts primitivism\". A further church design was St Andrew’s Church, Barnt Green, Worcestershire (52°21′37″N 1°59′17″W﻿ / ﻿52.3604°N 1.9880°W). In 1917 he was commissioned to design Seoul Anglican Cathedral in Korea; construction began in 1922 but was only completed in 1996 after the original plans were rediscovered. His son James, serving in the Royal Warwickshire Regiment during World War I, was killed aged 22. Pevsner described Dixon as \"an Anglo-Catholic Socialist who associated Gothic with establishment conservatism and dreary Anglican piety\"."

He studied natural sciences at the Universities of Bonn, Berlin and Freiburg, obtaining his doctorate in 1895 with a thesis on the ciliate- Bursaria truncatella titled Bursaria truncatella unter Berücksichtigung anderer Heterotrichen und der Vorticellinen.. In 1892 he received his habilitation at the University of Marburg, where he subsequently worked as a lecturer. In 1894-95 he conducted scientific studies in the Seychelles. With other scientists he participated in the \"1898-99 German Deep-Sea Expedition\" aboard the steamer Valdivia under the leadership of Carl Chun (1852–1914). In 1906 he was named director of the Berlin Zoological Museum, and later in his career he attained the title of \"full professor\". Brauer distinguished himself in the field of deep-sea ichthyology, based largely on his experiences from the 1898-99 \"Valdivia Expedition\" as well as in his subsequent analyses of species collected on the journey. He was the first to demonstrate that ceratioids were mesopelagic and bathypelagic lifeforms rather than bottom-dwelling organisms. He described four ceratioid species new to science, recognizing an overall total of 23 species in three families; Ceratiidae, Gigantactinidae and Aceratiidae. He made important scientific contributions towards the multi-volume project- Wissenschaftliche Ergebnisse der Deutschen Tiefsee-Expedition auf dem Dampfer \"Valdivia\" 1898-1899 (Scientific results of the German deep-sea expedition on the steamer \"Valdivia\" 1898–1899). He was the author of Die Süßwasserfauna Deutschlands, a work on freshwater fauna of Germany that was published in nineteen parts from 1909 to 1912. Also, he was an editor of Fauna arctica, a project on Arctic fauna that was originally begun by Fritz Römer (1866–1909) and Fritz Schaudinn (1871–1906). In 1896 herpetologist Oskar Boettger (1844–1910) named the skink species Janetaescincus braueri (Brauer's burrowing skink) in his honour."

After 4 weeks he was removed from the airwaves and placed on garden leave for the 6-month notice period in his contract. As a result of his departure ratings from the Phoneshow declined by almost 50%.Kennedy's new morning talk show Dublin Talks started on 98FM on 10 March 2014. Dublin Talks is a morning talkshow on 98FM. Kennedy was once described as a \"shock jock\" by the Irish Independent newspaper, for his controversial on-air persona. He touches on topics ranging from entertainment to social issues such as child sexual abuse, drug addiction, crime, etc. In 2006 Kennedy was found to be almost twice the legal drink driving limit and was put off the road."

  "text" : "Andrew Drummond (1688-1769) was the founder of Drummonds Bank in Charing Cross in London; now a part of the Royal Bank of Scotland. Andrew Drummond was apprenticed as a goldsmith in Edinburgh but in about 1712 he set up his own goldsmiths business at the sign of the 'Golden Eagle' on the east side of Charing Cross in London . By 1717 banking had been added to goldsmithing and the business attracted a growing clientele, especially expatriate Scots in London. He was the fifth son of Sir John Drummond of Machany who had been outlawed in 1690 for his close links to the exiled family of the deposed King James II in France. The three eldest sons had died young, the eldest survivor, the fourth son, was William Drummond who came to inherit the Viscountcy Strathallan, as 4th Viscount, from his young cousin, also William Drummond in 1711. His older and younger brothers both took an active part in the 1715 Jacobite rebellion and were made prisoners at Sheriffmuir. This seems to have had little effect on the Drummonds Bank business. In 1716 Andrew Drummond married Isabella Strahan (d.1731) from which union there was at least one son, John Drummond of Stanmore (1723–1774). In 1729 Andrew purchased the Stanmore estate in Middlesex. In 1745 the Young Pretender, Charles Edward Stuart raised his Standard at Glenfinnan and one of the first adherents to this new Jacobite rebellion was Andrew's older brother Strathallan, who went on to command the rebel forces in Scotland when the Prince invaded England and later commanded the reserve cavalry at the fateful battle of Culloden in April 1746, during which he was killed. The Strathallan's were the subject of an Act of Attainder by Parliament  and it caused the Drummond's Bank to temporarily cease trading. It did recommence trading again and the directors of the company were to include not just the descendants of Andrew but also of the Viscount Strathallan. Drummond died at Stanmore on 2 February 1769. The ownership of the Bank passed to his son John and his nephew Robert Drummond of Cadland The Drummonds Bank went on to become one of just two private banks to survive in London into the 20th century, when it was taken over by the Royal Bank of Scotland."

He was chief designer from 1919, working under the direction of Teddy Petter from May 1934  until 1944, when Petter left (to join English Electric)  and Davenport became technical director. According to Harald Penrose, he was made the scapegoat for the late delivery of the Wyvern and headed into retirement in March 1952. In the 1920s, when most aircraft were biplanes, Arthur was a strong proponent of the monoplane  Most of his monopane designs were high-winged or parasol, culminating in the Lysander. During his career he was involved in the design of the following fixed-wing aircraft. \n*  Westland Limousine Chief draughtsman  \n*  Westland Wagtail Chief draughtsman/Designer \n*  Westland Weasel Chief draughtsman/Designer \n*  Westland Woodpigeon \n*  Westland Widgeon Chief designer \n*  Westland Wizard \n*  Westland Wapiti/Wallace \n*  Westland Interceptor \n*  Westland Wessex \n*  Westland PV.3 \n*  Westland Wallace \n*  Westland PV.7 \n*  Westland F.7/30 \n*  Westland Lysander  \n*  Westland Whirlwind \n*  Westland Welkin  \n*  Westland Wyvern Technical director In the early 1930s he worked with Juan de la Cierva to develop the Cierva C.29 and Cierva CL.20 autogyros.

Annaleise had to qualify for this swim which was overseen by the regulated body and supervision of Solo Swims of Ontario. After qualifying and filing the 70 pages of paperwork a date was set 18 August 2012. With Lisa Anderson, her parents, grandparents, great grandparents and crew she was set with a huge flurry of media watching her leave as well as being on the water with her. Annaleise began her swim from Niagara-on-the-Lake(considered one of the world's most difficult open water swims) at 6:17:10 pm on 18 August 2012. She arrived at Marilyn Bell Park in Toronto after swimming for almost 27 hours, touching land at 8:58 pm on 19 August 2012. During her attempt, spectators received updates via live blogs, Twitter, and GPS live tracking. During her swim Annaleise's fundraising increased to $60,000, $80,000 to over $100,000 after her swim. To date Annaleise has raised over $250,000 for the Children and families at Camp Trillium. At the time of her swim Annaliese was the youngest person to cross Lake Ontario at 14 yrs 158 days and set an international record to be the youngest swimmer to swim continuously in open water for more than 24hrs (24 Hour Club). Annaleise's swim from Niagara-On-The-Lake to Toronto's Marilyn Bell Park when calculated through GPS; Annaleise swum close to 70 km due to being pushed off course due to currents and waves of approx 6 ft high pushing back toward Niagara-on-the-Lake."

  "text" : "Aisuluu Tynybekova (born 4 May 1993 in Bishkek) is a Kyrgyzstani freestyle wrestler. She competed in the freestyle 63 kg event at the 2012 Summer Olympics, the first woman to wrestle for Kyrgyzstan in the Olympics. A legal dispute threatened to prevent Tynybekova from competing in London, but the case was delayed until after the Games. Tynybekova was eliminated in the 1/8 finals by Henna Johansson. As of summer 2016, Tynybekova has competed in four World Championships (her highest finish being seventh in 2013) and four Asian Championships, finishing no lower than third and winning the 58 kg class in 2016. In the 2016 Summer Olympics, Tynybekova won her octofinal and quarterfinal, then lost her semifinal to the eventual silver medalist, Russia's Valeria Koblova. She then lost the second bronze medal match to Sakshi Malik of India (see Wrestling at the 2016 Summer Olympics – Women's freestyle 58 kg)."

  "text" : "Albert Arthur Purcell (3 November 1872 – 24 December 1935) was a British trade unionist and Labour Party politician. He was President of the International Federation of Trade Unions from 1924 to 1928, and sat in the House of Commons in two separate periods between 1923 and 1929. Purcell joined a forerunner of the National Amalgamated Furnishing Trades Association in 1891. About the same time, he also joined the Social Democratic Federation. He was elected to Salford Borough Council, serving for six years, then in 1911 became Assistant General Secretary of the union, followed in 1917 by election as General Secretary. Alongside this, he served as Treasurer of the Federation of Engineering and Shipbuilding Trades for three years, then as President. He was elected to the General Council of the Trades Union Congress (TUC) in 1921, becoming President of the TUC in 1924. In 1925, he chaired a TUC delegation to the Soviet Union. Purcell was elected at the December 1923 general election as the Member of Parliament (MP) for the city of Coventry, defeating the sitting Conservative MP Sir Edward Manville. However, at the next general election, in October 1924, he was defeated by the Conservative candidate from the 1923 general election. However, Purcell was out of Parliament for only 9 months. James Wignall, the Labour MP for the Forest of Dean division of Gloucestershire, died in June 1925, and at the resulting by-election on 14 July, Purcell won the seat. He did not defend that seat at the 1929 general election, but stood instead in Manchester Moss Side, where he was defeated by the sitting Conservative MP Sir Gerald Berkeley Hurst."

From 1879 until 1909, Dell'Era had a successful career at the Berlin Opera, being adored by many critics and writers, among them Theodor Fontane. Between 1886 and 1894, she also performed in Russia, mainly in St. Petersberg, along with the \"Italian Invasion\" - an influx of talented Italian dancers to Russia that included Pierina Legnani, Enrico Cecchetti, and Virginia Zucchi."

However, Märta Leth did obtain a Bachelor's degree in pharmacology in 1897, and by the time Arvidsson acquired her degree, there were already in fact 30 female pharmacists in Sweden. Arvidson served as an apprentice at the Pharmacy Lejonet in Malmö, took her bachelor's degree in 1901 and her degree at Farmaceutiska institutet 17 September 1903. Women were expressly allowed to become pharmacists in 1891. In 1928, Arvidsson became the manager of her own Pharmacy, and could be considered the first of her gender in that position as well: while widows had always been allowed to manage pharmacies after having inherited the license from their late spouses, Arvidsson was the first female pharmacy manager to have acquired her license herself. She manage the Norsjö Pharmacy in 1928-1933 and the Mellerud Pharmacy in 1933-1942."

He won the National Film Award for Best Cinematography twice, 36 Chowringhee Lane (1981) and Moksha (2000), the latter he also directed. He worked both with directors of mainstream Bollywood, like Subhash Ghai (Ram Lakhan (1989), Saudagar (1991)) and Rajiv Rai (Gupt (1997)), Mukul Anand (Trimurti (1995)), as well as parallel cinema directors, like Shyam Benegal (Trikaal (1985), Mandi (1983)), Aparna Sen (36 Chowringhee Lane (1981), Paroma (1984)). He also worked on films, including Shekhar Kapoor's Bandit Queen (1994), Girish Karnad's Utsav (1984), Gulzar's Ijaazat (1987) and MF Hussain's Gaja Gamini (2000). Early in 2012, he was diagnosed with lung cancer. While he was getting treated for Lung cancer, he was diagnosed with brain tumor. Despite the surgery and cancer, he never stopped working as movies and cinematography was his passion and first love. He succumbed to cancer in Mumbai on 15 August 2012, at the age of 65. Ashok Mehta's journey is a rags to riches story. He ran away from home at the age of 14 and came to Mumbai. With no money, no acquaintance and no shelter he had nowhere to go and to survive he started selling stuff like boiled eggs, fruits etc. His Journey in the Bollywood started as a canteen boy, office boy and then a camera attendant. After a decade-long struggle in the Indian film industry, he finally became the DOP. He got his first break as a cinematographer at the age of 25 in Raj Marbros' The Witness. He credits his actual career boost to the reigning star of the 1970s, Shashi Kapoor. Kapoor, who was starring in a film being shot by Mehta, was greatly impressed by his work and even though the film did not get made eventually, it won Mehta the favor of Kapoor, who offered him his next production, 36 Chowringhee Lane. The next step for Mehta was to establish himself in mainstream cinema and this opportunity came through actress Rakhee. It was during the filming of Paroma that Rakhee got acquainted with Mehta and his work, but it was years later when Subhash Ghai, leading director of the popular film scene, was on the lookout for a cameraman for his mega-project Ram Lakhan, that she suggested the name of Mehta. Ashok Mehta then stepped onto the popular film scene and with the collaboration of Ghai, brought to popular cinema an altogether different style of lighting and shot taking. He is lovingly known as the ''guiding light\"in Bollywood."

Born in Belarus, he served as Rav of several Eastern European Jewish communities and escaped to the United States in 1940 following the German occupation of Poland. In the U.S. he became a tireless rescue activist on behalf of the millions of Jews trapped in Nazi Europe and in the Soviet Union. He is credited with the successful transfer of the entire Mir yeshiva from Lithuania to Shanghai, providing for its support for five years, and obtaining visas and travel fare to bring all 250 students and faculty to America after World War II. He established the U.S. branch of the Mir in 1946. In the 1950s he aided North African and Syrian Jewish youth suffering from persecution and pogroms, and successfully lobbied for the passage of a bill granting \"endangered refugee status\" to Jewish emigrants from Arab lands."

  "text" : "Amer Mouaffac Al Midani (1957 – April 2012) was a member of the board of English football club Manchester United from 1987 to 2002 and chairman of the Manchester Giants basketball team. Born in Beirut, Lebanon, to a Lebanese property developer, he was a Lebanese junior table tennis champion at the age of 15, and moved to England at 18. By the mid-1980s, he had become chairman of the Warrington Vikings basketball team. In 1985, he received an approach from Manchester United FC chairman Martin Edwards, who wished to make Manchester United into a multi-sport club; as part of the deal, the Vikings moved from Warrington, Cheshire, to the Stretford Sports Centre in Trafford, Greater Manchester, changed its name to Manchester United Basketball Club, and Al Midani received a seat on the Manchester United board as well as shares in the club. He remained involved with the basketball club even after they separated from Manchester United and became the Manchester Eagles (and subsequently the Manchester Giants), but had left the club by the time it folded in 2001. In 1991, Al Midani attempted a takeover bid of Manchester United as part of a consortium that included club director and former player Bobby Charlton and would have installed Charlton as chairman, but was put off by Edwards' asking price of £30 million. He retained his shares in the club through its flotation on the London Stock Exchange later that year, but in 1997, Al Midani sold 500,000 shares in Manchester United (0.77% of the club) at around £6 each, causing an 11.5p drop in the share price. In 2002, he left the Manchester United board and was declared bankrupt after running up over £2 million of gambling debts in four days at the Rio hotel in Las Vegas. He was also a 12 per cent shareholder in Bobby Charlton Enterprises, the main company behind the Bobby Charlton Soccer School and Charlton's ventures into \"lunches with legends\". He died in April 2012."

  "text" : "Anna Elizabeth Botha, born on May 6, 1922 as Anna Elizabeth Rossouw, was the First Lady of South Africa, as the wife of State President Pieter Willem Botha, from 1984 to 1989. From 1978 to 1984 Mr Botha served as Prime Minister of South Africa. Anna Elizabeth Rossouw married Mr. Botha on 13 March 1943. She went by the name Elize, and was the daughter of a pastor from Senekal, Dr S.H. Roussouw. They had two sons, Rossouw and Pieter Willem, and three daughters, Elanza, Amelia and Rozanne. Elize Botha had stayed quietly in the background as the First Lady of South Africa. She earned admiration from Nelson Mandela for helping to arrange a luncheon that Mandela and widows of apartheid-era leaders attended. She died on 6 June 1997 of a heart attack at the age of 75. She had suffered an aneurysm in 1978 but had been in good health since then."

  "text" : "The book \"Harry Winston The Ultimate Jeweler\" published in 1984 acknowledges Ambaji Venkatesh Shinde as “one of the most talented designers in the world today.” A number of his jewelry designs appear in this book. A.V.Shinde was born in 1917 in Mapusa, Goa, a Portuguese colony in India, in a Konkani speaking Hindu family. He was drawn towards decorative arts at an early age painting backdrops and costume jewelry for the local Hindu temple religious functions. He came to Mumbai in 1934 to attend the J. J. School of Art. In his talk with Dona Dirlam of the Gemological Institute of America he said that the formal study in textile design influenced his later work. He had to seek work when his father died in 1937. His first job was at Narottamdas Jhaveri where he designed ornate silverware, trophies and jewelry. He was hired by Nanubhai Jhaveri in 1941 where he worked for nearly 20 years designing jewelry for the Maharajas. He followed the rich Indian tradition in his designs. He had a small picture of the Flying Apsara from Ajanta cave number 17 in his office. The design criteria changed when the Maharajas started to go abroad and desired western style jewelry. Harry Winston met him in 1955 and recognized a kindred soul and eventually hired him in 1962. He soon developed a gemstone driven style transforming fine jewelry into fine art. Harry Winston invented flexible, three-dimensional, near invisible mountings which freed the stones from heavy metal surrounds. After four decades of working in New York City, Shinde retired in December 2001 but continued to paint from home. He donated a number of designs to the GIA for a permanent display. Thousands of his designs remain in the Harry Winston archives and “provides a creative spark to ignite new interpretations of Harry Winston jewels for the next generations”.He married Anu in 1940. He had six sons and 10 grandchildren. He had a large circle of close friends, loved Indian classical music and spicy foods. He died on April 8, 2003 of pneumonia which he contracted in a Manhattan hospital. A Shinde painting of a necklace illustrates his mastery of the art of jewelry designing."

Davoodi was arrested in October 2003 after criticizing human rights conditions in Iran in the documentary Forbidden Iran, particularly the death in custody of Canadian-Iranian photojournalist Zahra Kazemi. He was tried in 2005 by the Islamic Revolutionary Court for \"spreading propaganda against the system\" and \"establishing and directing an organization opposed to the government\". The court found him guilty and sentenced him to 15 years' imprisonment and 75 lashes; as of August 2012, the latter part of his sentence had not been implemented. Amnesty International protested the sentence, designating Davoodi a prisoner of conscience. Davoodi served portions of his sentence in several different prisons, including Evin Prison. In 2005, he joined fellow prisoners Hojjat Zamani, Bina Darab-Zand, Valiollah-Feyz Mahdavi, Mehrdad Lohrasbi, Farzad Hamidi, and Jaafar Iqdami in a hunger strike to protest their confinement with violent offenders in Rajaii Shahr. Human Rights Watch called the six \"political prisoners\", \"being held for no reason other than their expression of peaceful political views\", and urged that they be released. In August 2012, a new charge of \"enmity against God\", which carries a possible death sentence, was brought against Davoodi. Amnesty International stated that the charge appeared to be linked to the release by CIS of a recording in which Davoodi called for \"freedom and democracy\"."

He was born in Porto Maurizio, near Genoa; he moved as a child to Otranto, where his father was consul for the French government. In 1819, he moved to Naples, where he first worked in the Royal Topographic Office, where he met Giacinto Gigante. With Gigante, he began training first under Jakob Wilhelm Hüber, then in the Academy under Pitloo. He published (with Gigante and others) a series of lithographs in a Viaggio pittorico nel Regno delle Due Sicilie (1829–1834). In 1848, he moved to Benevento, where he continued drawing and painting. He married Gigante's sister, and vice versa, and is considered a member of the School of Posillipo. His son, Alberto Vianelli, also a landscape painter moved to Paris. Vianelli's sister, Flora, married Theodore Witting, a German landscape artist and engraver. His nephew Gustavo Witting, also became a landscape painter. He was a knight of the Order of Francesco I of the Two Sicilies, and honorary professor of the Academy of Fine Arts of Naples. Vianelli died in Benevento on 2 April 1894."

  "text" : "Alexander von Meilenwald is a German multi-instrumentalist and vocalist known for his former band Nagelfar and his project The Ruins of Beverast. At the age of 15, Meilenwald read an interview with Darkthrone member Nocturno Culto which fascinated him, after he had realised the supposedly extreme band Cannibal Corpse were \"just normal metalheads\". He then bought Darkthrone's A Blaze in the Northern Sky and believed \"that this must be music made by deranged people\". He got to know Sveinn Hackelnberg and founded Nagelfar with him and two other members. In April 2002, Nagelfar disbanded, a decision that surprised the scene. Years later, Meilenwald explained that Zorn had told Nagelfar vocalist Zingultus and him that he lacked the energy and motivation he would have needed for Nagelfar, and Zorn and Meilenwald had decided that the band would not exist without one of them. Nagelfar refuse any offers for reunion concerts. After the band's breakup, Meilenwald went on to form the one-man band The Ruins of Beverast and became the drummer of Heemat and a session member of Kermania (whose leader Weigand is influenced by early Nagelfar) and Truppensturm. He, Zingultus and Hackelnberg founded the Wòd-Ván, a group of black metal fans mainly (but not exclusively) from the region around Aachen. A 2009 article by Rock Hard journalist Wolf-Rüdiger Mühlmann mentions that Meilenwald is age 31 and a student of history, linguistics and psychology."

  "text" : "Allen Willard Engel (b. October 20, 1932) is a farmer and former political figure in Saskatchewan, Canada. He represented Notukeu-Willow Bunch from 1971 to 1975 and Assiniboia-Gravelbourg from 1978 to 1986 in the Legislative Assembly of Saskatchewan as a New Democratic Party (NDP) member. He was born in Gravelbourg, Saskatchewan, the son of Emil Engel. Engel studied at the Saskatchewan Teacher's College and taught school for several years. In 1955, he married Joyce Beverly Baumbach of Lodi, California. Engel ran unsuccessfully in the newly created Assiniboia-Gravelbourg riding in 1975 before being elected again in 1978. Engel survived the Progressive Conservative landslide in 1982, almost certainly because Liberal leader Ralph Goodale ran in the riding, turning the contest into a three way race in the process. However, Engel was defeated by Goodale when he ran for reelection to the assembly in 1986 and was defeated again by John Thomas Wolfe in a 1988 by-election held after Goodale ran for a federal seat.Engel served as the Legislative Secretary to the Minister of Agriculture from 1978 - 1982, and Agriculture Critic from 1982 - 1986. During his tenure, Engel was instrumental in the preservation of the Grasslands National Park in Southern Saskatchewan, home to some of the world's oldest varieties of virgin prairie. Engel also focussed his efforts on international development including supervising Saskatchewan matching grants for agricultural growth in Africa, and later serving on international development boards. A street in Regina, Saskatchewan was named to honour his service to the province in 2002."

He led in his first campaign against the Byzantines in Asia Minor in 709, when he captured a fortress, although his uncle Maslamah ibn Abd al-Malik led the main raid of the year afterwards. In 710 he led the main Umayyad attack, although under the auspices of Maslamah as commander-in-chief for the Byzantine front, and in 713 he led an attack against the frontier fortress of Gazelon. In 714/5, his father the Caliph attempted to reverse the succession arrangement, by which the throne would pass to his brother Sulayman, in favour of Abd al-Aziz, but was unable to impose his will. When Sulayman in turn died in 717, Abd al-Aziz intended to claim the throne, but upon learning that Umar II had been chosen as caliph, he presented himself before him and acknowledged his rule. Abd al-Aziz died in Anno Hegirae 110 (728/729 CE)."

Likewise, their words of devotion are especially poetic and moving. The love letters are an authentic literary contribution, and offer delightful personal insights into a turbulent era of world history."

  "text" : "August von Krempelhuber (14 September 1813 – 2 October 1882) was a German lichenologist born in Munich. Born into nobility, he studied forestry at the University of Munich. Through his work in forestry, he developed an interest in lichens, subsequently publishing numerous articles in the field of lichenology. He traveled widely throughout Europe, and knew several languages, including classical Latin and Greek. His analysis of lichens included species from both European and exotic locales (Argentina, Brazil, New Zealand, et al.). Through his collection and evaluation of lichenological literature (up to 1871), he made strides in establishing order out of the confusing nomenclatural situation that existed at the time. Among his written works is Geschichte und Litteratur der Lichenologie, a book on the history and literature of lichenology from antiquity up to the year 1865. His collection of nearly 20,000 specimens is now kept at the Botanische Staatssammlung München. The fungi genus Krempelhuberia was named in his honor by Abramo Bartolommeo Massalongo. The standard author abbreviation Kremp. is used to indicate this individual as the author when citing a botanical name."

In 1905 he obtained his medical doctorate from the University of Pavia, where he spent the following five years as an assistant to pathologist Camillo Golgi (1846–1926). During this time period he also conducted studies at the Institute of Physiology in Berlin and at the Institute of Parasitology in Paris. Afterwards he taught classes in general pathology at the University of Cagliari, returning to Pavia in 1922 as a full professor and as a successor to Camillo Golgi. While an assistant at Pavia, he demonstrated with a severed peripheral nerve, that the stump attached to the cell body was able to survive and regenerate new branches, while its other stump, being detached from the cell body, degenerated. In 1910 he discovered that a Golgi body dissociated into a number of elongated structures during cell division. Perroncito named the split up pieces \"dictyosomes\"."

  "text" : "Allan Horsfall (20 October 1927–27 August 2012) was a British gay rights campaigner and founder of the North West Committee for Homosexual Law Reform, which became the Campaign for Homosexual Equality. In Horsfall's entry in the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Peter Tatchell described him as \"one of the grandfathers of the gay rights movement in Britain\" and \"one of the truly great pioneers of LGBT equality in Britain\". Horsfall was born in Laneshaw Bridge, Lancashire. His father Tom Horsfall ran a public house. He was raised by grandparents in the Yorkshire Moors. He described his grandparents as \"god-fearing Conservatives and fervent upholders of law and order\". He was educated at Nelson Grammar School and then did three years national service in the Royal Air Force. He worked as a clerk for the National Coal Board from 1959 to 1971 and then for Salford Education Committee. In 1956, following the Suez Crisis, he joined the Labour Party and became a councillor in Nelson, Lancashire. He was also involved with the North-East Lancashire Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, and was a founder of the National Federation of Bus Users. In 1958, he started campaigning for the Homosexual Law Reform Society to implement the findings of the Wolfenden Report published in 1957. In 1964, Horsfall became one of the founders of the North West Committee for Homosexual Law Reform. The Sexual Offences Act 1967 began the decriminalisation of homosexuality. In 1971, the North West Committee became the Campaign for Homosexual Equality (CHE). In comparison to the radical Gay Liberation Front which had formed in 1970, CHE was a much more respectable and middle class campaigning group. Horsfall ran CHE from 1971 to 1974 and then became president for life. During the 1970s, Horsfall attempted to set up 'Esquire Clubs', co-owned social clubs built on the model of working men's clubs for lesbians and gay men, but was not successful. Horsfall has spoken about the his 1960s campaigning at LGBT History Month events, and he was interviewed for the Millthorpe oral history project. He continued to campaign into the 1990s, joining the defence of the Bolton 7 for participating in homosexual group sex, and their successful case brought to the European Court of Human Rights. He met his partner Harold Pollard (1908-1996) at an ex-Serviceman's Club in 1947. Pollard was a primary school teacher and later a headteacher who was chairman of the Campaign for Homosexual Equality. The two lived together, mostly in Bolton, until Pollard's death. Horsfall died in Bolton."

Fadl was the eldest son of Yahya al-Barmaki, the founder of the family's fortunes. During the caliphate of Harun al-Rashid, he served as tutor to his heir, the future Caliph al-Amin (r. 809–813), and held gubernatorial positions over Tabaristan and Rayy (792–797), and over Khurasan (794/5–795/6). In these positions, he distinguished himself \"by the benevolence he showed towards the inhabitants of the eastern provinces\" (D. Sourdel). He fell out with Harun over his attempts to conciliate the Alids, however, and shared in his family's sudden fall from power in 803. He was remained imprisoned thereafter and died at al-Raqqah in 808."

He was the first of a series of Iraqi Christian officials who would come to play a significant role in the Caliphate's administration during the 9th century. Fadl began his career in the reign of Harun al-Rashid (r. 786–809) as a retainer of Harthama ibn A'yan, at the time head of the caliphal bodyguard. His administrative talent brought him to the attention of Harun, who appointed him a secretary in the diwan al-kharaj (the \"Bureau of the Land Tax\"). During the civil war that followed Harun's death, Fadl retired to his estates in Iraq. It was there that he came to the attention of Abu Ishaq, the younger brother of Caliph al-Ma'mun (r. 813–833) and future Caliph al-Mu'tasim, who valued is expert knowledge on taxation and agriculture. In 828, Abu Ishaq took him along to Egypt and then appointed him to head the diwan al-kharaj. During al-Ma'mun's absence on campaign against the Byzantine Empire in 832–833, Fadl remained in Baghdad as the Caliph's deputy, and it was he who had the oath of allegiance (bay'ah) sworn to al-Mu'tasim when news came of al-Ma'mun's death. In September 833, he was appointed as vizier with wide-ranging powers, but his attempts to limit expenditure, and especially the Caliph's, brought about his dismissal in February 836. He continued to serve Mu'tasim and his successors as an advisor on taxation issues until his death in 864, aged about 90."

  "text" : "Andrew Himes (born 1950) is the coordinator of the Business Alliance for the Future. Until January, 2015, he was the founding executive director of the Charter for Compassion, launched in 2008 by TED.com and Karen Armstrong, with the mission of supporting the emergence of a global compassion movement. He is the author of The Sword of the Lord: The Roots of Fundamentalism in an American Family.  Himes' grandfather was John R. Rice, dean of American fundamentalists for decades until his death in 1980, and mentor to many younger Baptist preachers including Billy Graham and Jerry Falwell, as well as founding editor of The Sword of the Lord newspaper. Himes' great-grandfather, Will Rice, was a preacher, a Texas State senator, and a leading member of the Ku Klux Klan in Texas during the 1920s. By the age of 17, Himes had turned his back on the career as a Baptist preacher expected of him by his family, becoming instead an activist in the anti-war and civil rights movements of the 60s and 70s.  In 1989, Himes was founding editor of MacTech, a journal of Macintosh software development. In 1992, he was founding editor of the Microsoft Developer Network, and then led the first web development project in the history of the company, a project dubbed the MSDN OffRamp, aimed at making articles, resources, and technical information available on the Internet to an audience of software developers. Beginning in 1994 Himes managed Microsoft's platform web team producing the sites for all of Microsoft’s operating systems, browsers, development tools, and technologies. After leaving Microsoft, he founded Project Alchemy, a non-profit company providing technology assistance, training, consulting, database and web solutions to hundreds of grassroots organizations working for social justice in the Pacific Northwest. Himes was co-founder in 2003 of the international movement, Poets Against the War, and produced the 2005 documentary Voices in Wartime an exploration of the trauma of war through the lens of poetry. In 2004, Himes founded Voices Education Project, a web site dedicated to teaching peace and compassion, now the education program of the Charter for Compassion. In 2008, Himes was a member of the organizing committee for the Seeds of Compassion event in Seattle, WA."

In contrast to the other maraji of his time, who lived in the holy cities of Qom or Najaf, he was based in Tehran, where he ran his own hawza. Khonsari was one of the teachers of Ayatollah Khomeini. Grand Ayatollah Khonsari came to Qom in 1923 and became one of the leaders of the hawza after the death of Abdul-Karim Ha'eri Yazdi. Together with Mohammad Kazem Shariatmadari and a number of other Iranian Grand Ayatollahs, he was a staunch opponent of the Shah’s White Revolution in 1963. But he felt Khomeini’s direct challenge of the Shah, claiming to speak for the entirety of Iranian religious leadership, went too far. Khonsari openly criticized Khomeini’s behaviour. Khonsari was a quietist, who believed the clergy should not exercise political power. As such, he opposed Ayatollah Khomeini’s interpretation of the concept of velayat-e faqih."

  "text" : "Allen Robert Tannenbaum (born January 25, 1953) is anAmerican/Israeli applied mathematician and presently Distinguished Professor of Computer Science and Applied Mathematics & Statistics at the State University of New York at Stony Brook. He is also Visiting Investigator of Medical Physics at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York City. He has held a number of other positions in the United States, Israel, and Canada including the Bunn Professorship of Electrical and Computer Engineering and Interim Chair, and Senior Scientist at the Comprehensive Cancer Center at the University of Alabama, Birmingham. He received his Ph.D. with thesis advisor Heisuke Hironaka at the Harvard University in 1976. Tannenbaum has done research in numerous areas including robust control, computer vision, and biomedical imaging, having almost 500 publications. He pioneered the field of robust control with the solution of the gain margin and phase margin problems using techniques from Nevanlinna–Pick interpolation theory, which was the first H-infinity type control problem solved. Tannenbaum used techniques from elliptic curves to show that the reachability does not imply pole assignability for systems defined over polynomial rings in two or more variables over an arbitrary field. He pioneered the use of partial differential equations in computer vision and biomedical imaging co-inventing with Guillermo Sapiro an affine-invariant heat equation for image enhancement. Tannenbaum further formulated a new approach to optimal mass transport (Monge-Kantorovich) theory in joint work with Steven Haker and Sigurd Angenent. In recent work, he has developed techniques using graph curvature ideas for analyzing the robustness of complex networks. His work has won several awards including IEEE Fellow in 2008, O. Hugo Schuck Award of the American Automatic Control Council in 2007 (shared with S. Dambreville and Y. Rathi), and the George Taylor Award for Distinguished Research from the University of Minnesota in 1997. He has given numerous plenary talks at major conferences including the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics (SIAM) Conference on Control in 1998, IEEE Conference on Decision and Control of the IEEE Control Systems Society in 2000, and the International Symposium on the Mathematical Theory of Networks and Systems (MTNS) in 2012. He is also well-known as one of the authors of the textbook Feedback Control Theory (with John Doyle and Bruce Francis), which is currently a standard introduction to robust control at the graduate level. His wife Rina Tannenbaum is a chemist and his son Emmanuel David Tannenbaum is a biophysicist and applied mathematician."

Irwin served as a brigade-major at the Battle of Blenheim, where he was again wounded, and was later present at Ramillies and Malplaquet. He was granted brevet rank as a colonel on 1 March 1711. On 27 June 1737, after nearly forty-eight years' service in various parts of Europe, Irwin was appointed colonel of the 5th Regiment of Foot, and following promotion to brigadier-general on 1 January 1743 and major-general on 24 February 1744, he held important commands on the staff in Ireland, where he was also Lieutenant-Governor of Kinsale. He was promoted to lieutenant-general in 1748. Lieutenant-General Irwin may have been of the family of the Irvines of Drum. By his wife Catherine he had an only son, General Sir John Irwin."

  "text" : "Arthur McConnell Dollison (October 19, 1909 – May 14, 1983) was an American prison administrator. A graduate of Cambridge High School and Ohio Wesleyan University, he was the son of Frank Dollison, an editor of newspaper The Daily Jeffersonian. Dollison graduated from the university in 1933, and because of the Great Depression only found part-time work until 1938, when he became a guard at the U.S. Penitentiary in Leavenworth, Kansas. After a stint in the U.S. Army during WWII, Dollison returned to the federal prison system, moved into industries and worked in prisons in Kentucky and Indiana. In January 1954, he was transferred to the U.S. Penitentiary at Alcatraz, where he became the Superintendent of Industries in 1958. Dollison worked on Alcatraz for nine years, eventually becoming the associate warden in late 1961, under Warden Olin G. Blackwell. His was a controversial appointment, in part because his promotion from superintendent of industries to associate warden was unusual but also because the Bureau of Prisons ignored its former custom of promotions with transfer for training purposes. During his term as Associate Warden, the iconic June 1962 dummy mask escape from Alcatraz occurred. Mr. Dollison was Acting Warden while Mr. Blackwell was on vacation. The three escapees, Frank Morris, Clarence and John Anglin, were never seen again. Mr. Dollison was transferred to a Texas federal prison in December 1962 because Alcatraz was closing and retired three years later. He died in 1982. He was married for over 50 years to Evelyn E. O'Brien. They had three children, Corinne Dollison Edwards, Philip Francis Dollison and Jolene Babyak. Ms Babyak has written several books about Alcatraz, including, 1) Eyewitness on Alcatraz, 2) Birdman, the Many Faces of Robert Stroud, 3) Breaking the Rock, The Great Escape from Alcatraz, and 4) Alcatraz Most Wanted, under a pen name, Cory Kincade. Although some of her source material included her father's papers, her books are also informed by interviews and prison documents."

He may also be responsible for other killings. Ostensibly, Falconer's murder occurred because Falconer is alleged to have murdered Perish's elderly grandparents, Anthony Perish Sr. (1902-1993) and Frances Perish (1900-1993), in 1993. Together with his brother, Andrew Perish, and other members of his criminal gang, as well as outlaw motorcycle clubs, Perish and associates are estimated to be responsible for at least six murders and two suspicious deaths. Altogether, the Terry Falconer/Perish gang murder investigation took over a decade and involved fourteen people, who are estimated to have committed at least one hundred separate offences that involve amphetamine and methamphetamine drug dealing, assault, abduction, murder and manslaughter  Perish and his collaborators were apprehended in 2008 and went to trial in April 2012, resulting in Anthony Perish (42) being sentenced to eighteen years imprisonment, while his brother Andrew Perish (41) was sentenced to nine years and an associate, Matthew Lawton was sentenced to fifteen years, each on murder and conspiracy charges."

  "text" : "Andrew Suknaski (July 30, 1942 – May 3, 2012) was a Canadian poet and visual artist. He was born on a homestead near Wood Mountain, Saskatchewan and studied at a number of institutions, receiving a diploma of Fine Arts from the Kootenay School of Art in 1967. He was an editor for Anak Press and Deodar Shadow Press, and founded the underground magazine Elfin Plot in Vancouver in 1969. From 1977 to 1978, he was writer-in-residence at St. John's College, University of Manitoba. His early works were published in Al Purdy’s anthology Storm Warning (1971). His first collection was Wood Mountain Poems (1976), edited by Purdy, followed by The Ghosts Call You Poor (1978) and In The Name of Narid (1981). Ghosts won him the Canadian Authors’ Association Poetry Award in 1979. Suknaski also worked as a researcher for the National Film Board of Canada, contributing to such films as Grain Elevator (1981), by Charles Konowal, and The Disinherited (1985), by Harvey Spak. In 1978, Spak made a documentary about Suknaski, Wood Mountain Poems. Suknaski’s Polish and Ukrainian heritage, his concern for First Nations people and for the history and culture of the Canadian Prairies are strongly reflected in his work. He stopped writing in the 1980s and died in Moose Jaw on May 3, 2012. Montage for an Interstellar Cry (1982) and Silk Trail (1985) were the first and third parts respectively of a larger work that was to be called “Celestial Mechanics. For a time, Suknaski worked as a researcher for the National Film Board, contributing to such films as Grain Elevator (1981), by Charles Konowal, and The Disinherited (1985), by Harvey Spak. In 1978, The National Film Board celebrated his Wood Mountain Poems with a documentary film featuring the author and his native Wood Mountain, Saskatchewan. Suknaski was also known for erratic acts of poetry. He once launched poems that had been folded into paper airplanes from an airplane flying over Edmonton, Alberta and he, along with Al Purdy, launched poems in bottles down the Saskatchewan River. His last full length book was Silk Trail, which takes a very Poundian look at the construction of the transcontinental railway. see Canadian National Railway and the Chinese immigrant labourers, known as Coolies, that were integral to its success. Suknaski first appeared on the Canadian literary scene in two influential anthologies, Storm Warning, edited by Al Purdy, and Four Parts Sand which also featured Judith Copithorne, bill bissett and Earle Birney."

  "text" : "Alexander Fyodorovich Labzin (Александр Фёдорович Лабзин; 1766–1825) was a leading figure of the Russian Enlightenment who developed an idiosyncratic mystical system and founded an influential St. Petersburg masonic lodge, The Dying Sphinx. His wife Anna Labzina was a noted memoirist. Labzin attended the Moscow University, where he came to know two leading Freemasons, Ivan Schwarz and Nikolay Novikov. He curried favour with Emperor Paul by preparing a historical account of the Order of Malta and held a string of offices during his reign and that of his son, including Chief of the Navy Department and Vice President of the Imperial Academy of Arts. He also had time to translate Jakob Böhme and Pierre Beaumarchais, as well as write his own poetry. Labzin revived the tradition of Novikov's \"libertine\" magazines with \"The Messenger of Sion\", a religious monthly that celebrated a \"religion of the heart\" and rebelled against the ritualistic side of Orthodox worship. The magazine was attacked by the church officials led by Photius Spassky and was discontinued. In 1822 he was exiled to Simbirsk for opposing Arakcheyev's election to the Academy of Arts. When told that Arakcheyev was \"the nearest person to His Majesty\", Labzin proposed to elect the Tsar's coachman instead \"not only as being the nearest to the emperor, but having a seat before his majesty\". He died in exile. Labzin's young protégés included Alexander Witberg, an architect who won the commission to construct in Moscow the Cathedral of Christ the Saviour but tsar Nicholas I abandoned the \"Masonic\" plan for a less \"Roman Catholic\" neo-Byzantine construction."

She was a part of the SF youth movement since her High School years at Tørring Amtsgymnasium. She studied Political Science at the University of Copenhagen from 2003 to 2007, and in November 2007 she was elected to parliament. During her time as a member of parliament she was spokesperson for the Socialist People's Party on the topics of immigration, citizenship and elder care. She has been noted as a supporter of a somewhat stricter immigration policy, than the party has previously pursued. She has been described as a member of the party's right wing, but describes herself as a \"reform socialist\", in the pragmatic center of the party. When leader of the Socialist People's Party Villy Søvndal announced that he would step down in September 2012, she announced her candidacy as new leader, and garnered supporting statements from most of the party top. Her opponent in the bid for party leadership was Annette Vilhelmsen, of the party's left wing, who won with 64% percent of the votes. In January 2014 as the Socialist People's Party left the government coalition, Astrid Krag left the People's party to become a member of the ruling Social Democratic Party. She lives on Amager, is married to musician Andreas Seebach with whom she has a daughter and a son."

Pulitzer founded the New York Morning Journal in 1882, which he sold to John R. McLean, who soon after transferred the paper to William Randolph Hearst in 1895. He also founded Das Morgen Journal, a German-language version of the Journal, which Hearst also acquired in 1895. Albert was born, like his brother, in Makó, Hungary. He emigrated to the United States when he was 16, and started work as a German teacher at Leavenworth High School in Kansas. After two years, he started working for an Illinois newspaper. He moved to New York City in 1871 and worked at the New York Sun and New York Herald, until founding the Journal. He wrote The Romance of Prince Eugene. An idyll of the Time of Napoleon 1. (2 Volumes, Dodd, Mead, NY 1895.)Suffering from neurasthenia, Albert committed suicide in Vienna (he had moved to Europe after he sold the Journal) on October 3, 1909. His son, Walter Pulitzer, who was an author and magazine publisher, died in 1926. In 2010, author James McGrath Morris published a new biography of Joseph Pulitzer (Pulitzer: A Life in Politics, Print, and Power) which included new information from Albert Pulitzer's memoirs. These materials, which he tracked down in 2005, had been preserved by Albert's granddaughter Muriel."

  "text" : "Arthur Henry Aylmer Morton (31 December 1835 – 15 June 1913) was a British clergyman, schoolteacher and Conservative Party politician. The second son of Edward Morton of Kensington Gate, Hyde Park, London, he was educated at Eton College where he was a member of the 1854 Eton XI cricket team. In 1854 he was admitted to King's College, Cambridge where he took Classical Honours, graduating Bachelor of Arts in 1859 and Master of Arts in 1862. In 1857 he was elected a Fellow of King's College, subsequently becoming bursar in 1870-1871 and Senior dean of the college in 1871-1872. Morton was ordained as a Church of England deacon in 1861 and as a priest in 1863. He was appointed curate of the All Saints, Knightsbridge and of the Curzon Chapel, Mayfair. Following graduation he initially worked as a tutor at Eton. He was tutor to Viscount Macduff, later Duke of Fife. In 1881 he became the duke's chaplain. From 1872-1886 he was headmaster of a preparatory school in Farnborough, Hampshire. In June 1891 he resigned from the Anglican Ministry under the terms of the Clerical Disabilities Act 1870. A Unionist in politics, he unsuccessfully contested the parliamentary seats of Leeds East in 1892 and North Manchester in 1895. From 1895 - 1898 he was a member of the London County Council, representing Rotherhithe as a member of the Conservative-backed Moderate Party. In 1897 the sitting member of parliament for Deptford, Charles Darling, was appointed a judge of the Queen's Bench Division. This required him to vacate his seat, and Morton was chosen by the Conservative Party to contest the ensuing by-election. Morton was elected and held the seat until 1906. In 1904 he was appointed an ecclesiastical commissioner. In 1903 Morton married Evelyn Wilson-Todd, daughter of Sir William Henry Wilson-Todd of Halnaby Hall, and Tranby Park, Yorkshire, MP for Howdenshire. He divided his time between residences in Scotland (at North Berwick until his marriage and at Balabraes House, Ayton, Berwickshire thereafter), and Eaton Place in London. He died at his London home in June 1913, aged 77."

She became especially noted for her work as a miniature painter. For over 20 years, she was in constant demand as a copyist of famous paintings in the Louvre and other French galleries. Many of her original works and copies hang in collections of the most famous collectors of France and Europe; therefore, her works seldom come up for sale. In 1908, the French Government conferred the Ordre des Palmes Académiques on her. In 1926, she moved to Santa Ana, California with her adopted son. While in Santa Ana, she painted the portrait of Senora De La Rosa, a 128-year-old Mexican lady, who is being researched as the oldest person to ever have lived. The \"Old Senora\" was born Martina de la Rosa in Aquas Callientes, Mexico on November 5, 1805 and passed on January 8. 1935 in Santa Ana, California. The painting of the \"Old Senora\" is in the collection of Samuel and Katheryn Othus. Extensive, documented provenance exists."

  "text" : "Sir Arthur Henry Freeling, 5th Baronet (26 July 1820 – 26 March 1885) was the fifth Surveyor General of South Australia. Freeling was the son of John Clayton Freeling and grandson of Sir Francis Freeling, Bt, and the elder brother of Sir Sanford Freeling, KCMG. Freeling enlisted into the Royal Engineers and ultimately took service under the South Australian Government as Surveyor-General. In this capacity he did some valuable exploring work, and was a member of the Executive and Legislative Councils prior to the concession of responsible government. He married, in 1848, Charlotte Augusta, daughter of Sir Henry Rivers, 9th Rivers baronet. He was elected to the newly constituted Legislative Council in March 1857, and sat till August 1859, when he resigned. He was a member of the Finniss Ministry as Commissioner of Public Works from October 1856 to March 1857, when he retired rather than relinquish the permanent post of Surveyor-General, which he resigned in 1861, and returned to England. He was then a lieutenant-colonel in the Royal Engineers, but became a major-general on retiring, and in 1871 succeeded as 5th Baronet of Ford and Hutchings, Sussex. In 1860, the Victorian government botanist, Ferdinand von Mueller named Eremophila freelingii in his honour. The type specimen of the species had been collected by George Charles Hawker on Freeling's expedition to Lake Torrens. Sir Arthur died on 26 March 1885, when he was succeeded by his son Harry, the 6th Baronet of Ford and Hutchings, Sussex."

  "text" : "Andrew Evans (born 1950s) is an English soldier from Longton, Staffordshire, who was wrongfully convicted and served 25 years in custody after confessing to the 1972 murder of Judith Roberts, a 14-year-old schoolgirl from nearby Tamworth. Evans was stationed at Whittington Barracks near Lichfield – an army base in close proximity to Tamworth – when Judith was dragged from her bicycle and battered to death in June 1972, and later confessed to the crime after seeing the girl's face in a dream. Evans was charged with Judith's murder in October 1972 after he presented himself at a local police station, asking to see a photograph of the victim, and making a signed statement following three days of interviews in which he maintained his guilt. Although he subsequently retracted his confession, a jury convicted him of murder following a trial in 1973, and he was sentenced to life imprisonment. Advised he had no grounds for appeal, Evans spent the next two decades in prison before his case came to the attention of the British media in 1994, and was taken up by the human rights group Justice when he contacted them about it. With no other evidence against him apart from his own words, and strong evidence that he was suffering from false memories as the result of anxiety and depression at the time of his arrest, Evans's conviction was overturned by the Court of Appeal in 1997; and he was released from prison. As of 1997 the time he spent in custody was the longest period served by an individual in the United Kingdom as the result of a miscarriage of justice. Evans was awarded £750,000 in compensation from the Home Office in 2000, while the identity of the real killer remains unknown to the present day."

At 6'5\" tall, Peled started life as a basketball player and was called \"larger than life\" when he enveloped his Guarneri cello  and \"Jacqueline du Pré in a farmer's body.\" Peled often surprises audiences with the ways he breaks down barriers between performers and the public, making classical music more accessible to wider audiences through explanations, jokes, and even with a basketball game challenge. Peled was a student of Bernard Greenhouse and is now a sought-after pedagogue of cello at Peabody Institute and when hired, was the youngest professor at a top musical institution. Peled also collaborates with pianist Alon Goldstein and clarinetist Alexander Fiterstein in the Goldstein-Peled-Fiterstein Trio as well as with pianist Alon Goldstein and violinist Ilya Kaler in the Tempest Trio."

He compiled a best-selling quiz book series Atama no Taisō (頭の体操, literally Head Gymnastics), from 1966 to his death. There are 23 sequel parts published. He was also known for designing the puzzles of video games, including the Professor Layton series, in which he is cited as a \"Puzzle Master\" in the credits. In the titular Professor Layton's office, the player can also find a book which the professor is reading written by a puzzle master from abroad--as the games take place in the UK, this is likely referring to Tago.

  "text" : "Alexander Crichton was a London silversmith whose details of birth and death are as yet unknown.He almost certainly had Scottish connections, seen in an 1873/4 condiment set, the earliest known piecefrom his workshop, and sold by Hamilton Crichton & Co., Scottish goldsmiths of 41 George Street, Edinburgh. A pair of shields made by Alexander Crichton, after the design of Sir Noel Paton, were shown at the Edinburgh Exhibition of 1886 by J Crichton & Co., of 47 George Street, Edinburgh. By far the largest collection of Crichton claret jugs passed through the hands of the Dukes of Hamilton of Brodick Castle on the Isle of Arran. Crichton’s first known major work is an 1878 pair of parcel gilt shields based on Shakespeare’s “A Midsummer Night's Dream”, and inspired by the two paintings by Sir Joseph Noel Paton, “The Quarrel” and “The Reconciliation of Oberon and Titania.” The shields embody high standards of casting, embossing and chasing, the same craftsmanship which won Crichton a prize of £25 awarded by the Goldsmiths Company at the Society of Arts Exhibition in 1870 for his repousse cup. Crichton's whimsy is seen in some of the finest English silver of the period, and is thought to be based on the drawings of Sir John Tenniel for Alice in Wonderland and Alice Through the Looking Glass. This link with Tenniel may date back to Tenniel's friendship with Paton when they were involved in a competition to decorate Westminster Hall. Illustrating Dodgson's books had Tenniel creating some of the most enduring characters of all time. Translating these fantasy figures into tangible objects is regarded as Crichton’s greatest triumph. Crichton created more than 34 animal-shaped silver and glass claret jugs between 1881 and 1882, many of these designs being registered at the Patents Office. Crichton's mark was registered at the Goldsmiths Hall in November 1872 and his workshop recorded as being at 47 Great Russell Street; he then moved to 45 Rathbone Place, Oxford Street, having started a partnership with Charles John Curry, trading as Crichton & Curry, and listed as designers, modellers and silversmiths. A severe recession in the early 1880s led to the firm's downfall, the partnership being dissolved by October 1884 with Crichton bankrupt in December 1886. Before his bankruptcy Crichton designed a table lighter shaped like a bear and honeypot for the Victorian sculptor Sir Joseph Boehm, donated to the Royal Academy in 1883. Crichton moved to Sheffield and requested a discharge from his bankruptcy in 1899. Charles John Curry, was recorded aged 23 in the 1871 census as living at 21 Great Sutton Street, with his brother William Frederic, aged 21. Their father, John, aged 56 was listed as a silver caster, while the eldest brother HenryWilliam Curry, aged 25, ran the firm. Their employees numbered eight men and four boys. A piece dated 1886is marked \"H.W. Curry\", suggesting that Charles had gone back to the family business."

Due to the poor financial conditions of his family, Desai could not proceed with his education after 3rd grade. He then came to Mumbai to work and earn money. Doing various physical works and trying his hand at many businesses, his business of manufacturing topis (headgears) took boom. Since then he got his nickname Topiwala. Desai's social work included foundation of various schools. The Anant Shivaji Desai Topiwalla High School at Malvan, now called after his nickname as Topiwalla High School, was founded in 1911. Various roads, schools, college, libraries and other institutes are named after him. For his notable work towards the society, the then British Empire in India honoured him with the title of \"Raobahadur\"."

  "text" : "August Neilreich (12 December 1803, Vienna 1 June 1871) was an Austrian lawyer and botanist. He studied law at the University of Vienna, eventually attaining the position of Oberlandesgericht Rath. At the age of 53 he was forced into early retirement from the legal profession due to illness. As a young man, he was inspired by the botanical work of Ludwig Ritter von Köchel (1800-1877). Although he is largely known for investigations of flora native to Vienna and Lower Austria, he published works on plants found throughout the Austrian Empire. The plant genus Neilreichia was named in his honour by Eduard Fenzl (1808–1879). His name is also associated with the species Asperula neilreichii (Eastern Alps-Meier)."

He distinguished himself by his piety, his education, the prudent manner in which he administered his bishopric and his political influence. He was a teacher of Bruno of Eguisheim-Dagsburg, who became Bishop of Toul in 1026. In 1049, Adalbero III was present at the meeting in Worms, organized by Emperor Henry III, where Bruno was elected as the imperial candidate to become Pope. Later the people of Rome elected Bruno by acclamation, and he became Pope as Leo IX. Adalbero III was also present at the council in Rome in 1050 where Bishop Gerard of Toul was canonized. Emperor Henry IV enfeoffed Adalbero with the County of Saarbrücken."

  "text" : "Anas Aremeyaw Anas is a Ghanaian investigative journalist born in the late 1970s. Anas's motto is \"name, shame and jail\" and he is famous for utilizing his anonymity as a tool in his investigative arsenal; very few people had seen his face until \"unmasking\" during a BBC interview in November 2015 — however, that too turned out to be a clever prosthetic. A politically non-aligned multimedia journalist who specializes in print media and documentary, Anas focuses on issues of human rights and anti-corruption in Ghana and sub-Saharan Africa. Anas has won critical acclaim for his work advocating for basic human rights such as the right to not be held in human slavery or servitude and for his work exposing corruption. His investigative works have won him worldwide acclaim, including President Barack Obama highlighting his virtues in a speech during a 2009 visit to Ghana: \"An independent press. A vibrant private sector. A civil society. Those are the things that give life to democracy. [...] We see that spirit in courageous journalists like Anas Aremeyaw Anas, who risked his life to report the truth.\" Anas has won more than 14 international awards for his investigative work. He was polled as the fifth most influential Ghanaian in 2011 by ETV. and named one of the \"Most Influential Africans of the Year\" by New African magazine. in December 2014. Chameleon by Ryan Mullins, a documentary about Anas's life and work, was premiered at the 2014 IDFA festival in Amsterdam. In December 2015 Foreign Policy magazine named Anas one of 2015's leading global thinkers, an honour previously granted to the likes of Barack Obama, Aung San Suu Kyi, Pope Benedict XVI, and Malala Yousafzai. In March 2016, Anas was invited by Harvard Law School as a keynote speaker to share his experiences as an international undercover journalist creating change on the continent of Africa in 2016."

  "text" : "Abraham Cohen (Abraham ben Shabbetai ha-Kohen) (1670 – 1729) was a Jewish physician, rabbi, religious philosopher and poet on Zante (Zakynthos), an Ionian Island, and an overseas colony of the Venetian Republic. Cohen's family was moderately wealthy and lived on Crete where he was born, although he lived most of his adult life in the town of Zante where he practiced medicine. He was a scholar and graduated as a physician from the University of Padua. In 1700 Cohen published in Venice his Derashot 'al ha-Torah, a common title for homilies (sermons) and commentary on the Pentateuch (Torah). His Derashot 'al ha-Torah is also known as Kebod Chacamim or Kevod Ḥakhamim (The Glory of Wise Men). In 1719 he published in Venice his Kehunnat Abraham (כהנת אברהם), a book of religious poems in Hebrew written in the manner of and inspired by the Psalms (Tehillim). Cohen used a number of different meters in his poetry. His Kehunnat Abraham created a stir within the Jewish community of the Venetian Republic and other parts of Italy, full of compliments. Joseph Fiametta published a poem in praise of it, as did Issac Vita Cantarini and Shabbethai Marini, both in the mode of the times, sonnet form. Cohen's engraved self-portrait appears on the fly-leaf of his Kehunnat Abraham complete with wig. In 1879 M. Ventura of Corfu found a Hebrew poem by Cohen inscribed on the wall of the synagogue in Candia, Crete, and later published his discovery."

  "text" : "Adam Ross (born February 15, 1967, New York) is an American novelist and short story writer. His debut novel, Mr. Peanut, was also named a 2010 New York Times Notable Book, as well as one of the best books of the year by The New Yorker, The Philadelphia Inquirer, The New Republic, and The Economist. It has been translated into 16 languages. His story collection, Ladies and Gentlemen, was included in Kirkus Reviews Best Books of 2011. Ross was born and raised in New York City and attended the Trinity School, where he was a state champion wrestler. A child actor, he appeared in movies (The Seduction of Joe Tynan), numerous commercials and television shows, as well as radio dramas such as The Eternal Light and E.G. Marshall’s Mystery Theater. Mr. Peanut, published by Knopf in 2010, was reviewed by Scott Turow on the cover of the New York Times Book Review, who called the novel “the debut of a prodigiously talented writer…a brilliant, powerful, memorable book.” In her review of the novel, the New York Times’ Michiko Kakutani described it as, “Dark, dazzling…The debut of an enormously talented writer,” and called Ross “a literary gymnast [and] a sorcerer with words.” Mr. Peanut tells the story of a video game designer, David Pepin, who is suspected of murdering his wife, Alice. He is interrogated by two detectives, Ward Hastroll (an anagram for Rear Window’s killer Lars Thorwald) and Sam Sheppard, of the infamous Dr. Sam Sheppard murder case. The novel is structured like a Möbius strip and combines the work of M.C. Escher, Alfred Hitchcock, and true crime wherein the reader is challenged to ascertain which events are real and which are guilty projections of the novel’s characters. Ross’s story collection, Ladies and Gentlemen, was published in 2011. His nonfiction has been published in The New York Times Book Review, The Daily Beast, The Wall Street Journal, and The Nashville Scene. His fiction has appeared in The Carolina Quarterly and FiveChapters. In 2016 he was appointed editor of The Sewanee Review."

In recent years, Bauman has been credited with promoting low level laser therapy (LLLT) for hair loss, follicular unit extraction (FUE) hair transplants, prostaglandin analogs like bimatoprost, hair loss genetic tests  and live surgery webcasts. Bauman was the first hair transplant surgeon to demonstrate ‘live’ the FUE method of hair transplantation at the 2003 International Society of Hair Restoration Surgery Orlando Live Surgery Workshop and developed the first commercially available instrument specifically for manual extraction of FUE grafts, called the 'Bauman MINDEX.'"

Consequently, Mechtersheimer's political career has seen him move from Bavarian CSU to the Greens in the 1980s. Later he distanced himself from the Greens as well, for their purported lack of patriotism. Afterward Mechtersheimer has organized various movements known for their \"stridently nationalist brand of national pacifism\". His politics since the 1990s have been self-described as \"Nationalpazifismus\" (roughly: national-pacifist)."

He made a secret bargain with Sir Geoffrey de Charney, a French knight, to sell Calais to Sir Geoffrey for 20,000 crowns, roughly two million pounds adjusted for inflation. Upon discovering the plot, Edward summoned Sir Amery to London and confronted him, ordering him to keep his bargain with Sir Geoffrey and say nothing of the King's knowledge. Sir Geoffrey gathered an army to take control of the town in December of that year, and King Edward brought an army from England to ambush the French takeover. The English prevailed in the failed siege of Calais on December 31, 1348, and King Edward transferred governance of Calais to John de Beauchamp and abated the arms of Sir Amery in 1349."

  "text" : "Al Gross is an American broadcaster, and host of National Countdown Show. He is President of Signature Media Group, Inc, which syndicates the show. He is also a voice actor, and radio broadcast consultant. Gross was born in Milwaukee, Wisconsin and grew up in Ventura, California. He studied Pastoral Theology at Liberty University (then Lynchburg Baptist College) in 1973 – 74. As a broadcaster he worked mostly in Southern California in radio including KWIZ AM & FM in Santa Ana, CA, KEZY in Anaheim, CA, and was the first radio station manager at for Calvary Chapel’s KWVE-FM San Clemente, CA. In 1987 Gross went to Focus on the Family where he was one of the original writers and contributors for Family News in Focus. At KBRT-AM 740 (Los Angeles) he was co-host of Mornings with Tim and Al with Tim Berends. Gross and Berends were voted LA’s “Top Jocks” by readers of the Los Angeles Herald-Examiner (Hearst Newspapers) in 1986. Later that year, Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley proclaimed “Tim and Al day in Los Angeles” with an official proclamation. In 1994, Gross moved to Saint Louis where he co-hosted the morning show on KJSL AM 630 for 14 years. In 2007 he formed Signature Media Group, Inc. and created National Countdown Show. It is the only Top 40 Oldies Countdown Show covering the golden age of Top 40 Radio (1955 to 1970). Every week Al Gross counts down the Top 40 songs using data primarily from Cashbox magazine. Each show uses the original songs, jingles, newscasts and even vintage commercials. He owns what could arguably be the largest private pop music record collection in the United States. He is still active in commercial voiceovers, radio drama and broadcast consulting."

He went through all Belarusian divisions quite quickly and has officiated his first top league match in Belarus in 2003 when he was only 23. It happened quite often those times that Kulbakov was the youngest man on the pitch. Alexey became a FIFA-licensed referee just two years later, in 2005, at the age of 25 (minimal possible age for FIFA referees). His debut in international A-team level took place 12 September 2007 when Cyprus won 3-0 against San-Marino in EURO 2008 qualifier. In 2008 he was selected as one of the 19 participants of the UEFA Talents and Mentors program for perspective European referees. During next two years (2008 and 2009) in the framework of this program Alexey officiated all his UEFA matches under supervision of the same referee observer Andreas Schluchter from Switzerland. Starting from the season 2009/2010 Kulbakov regularly officiates matches in the UEFA Europa League group stage. His first match at this level took place 17 September 2009 CFR Cluj won 2-0 against København in Cluj-Napoca. He is also in charge in A-team international matches, including 2010 and 2014 World Cup qualifiers as well as 2008 and 2012 UEFA EURO qualifiers. Kulbakov has missed the first half of 2013 national championship due to injury. In June 2013 Kulbakov together with other 5 referees was selected to officiate the final tournament of UEFA U-19 EURO 2013 which took place in Lithuania in July 2013."

  "text" : "Arthur Cecil Gask (10 July 1869 – 25 June 1951), dentist and novelist, was born on 10 July 1869 at St Marylebone, London, fourth of five children of Charles Gask, merchant, and his wife Fanny, née Edis. Gask, accompanied by his second wife, their two sons, and by a daughter of his first marriage, emigrated to Adelaide, South Australia in 1920, where he set up practice as a dentist. He was among the first in the city to carry out extractions with gas. He began writing crime fiction while waiting for his patients and in 1921 paid for the publication of his first novel, The Secret of the Sandhills, which was an immediate success. Over a period of thirty years Gask wrote over thirty books as well as contributing short stories to The Mail in Adelaide. Most of his novels described the activities of a detective, Gilbert Larose, in solving crimes. Gask's work was translated into several European languages, serialised in newspapers and broadcast on radio. He also wrote short stories. H. G. Wells, an admirer of Gask's work, corresponded with Gask. Wells regarded The Vengeance of Larose (1939) as Gask's \"best piece of story-telling...It kept me up till half-past one.\" Bertrand Russell, also an admiring reader, called to see Gask at Gask's home in Walkerville, an Adelaide suburb, when he was in Adelaide in August 1950. Gask was reported to have been delighted when, within a few hours after his arrival in Adelaide, Lord Russell called in and spent about an hour and a half with him. Russell confided that he was a reader of Mr. Gask's books in England, and said that now they were so near to each other he felt he really must make his acquaintance. Lord Russell was 78 at the time and Arthur Gask was 81. Gask's sister, Lilian Gask, was also a writer. When nearly 80, Gask was still turning out two 80,000-words novels a year, and was reported to have got out of bed to write 23 pages and complete his final novel, Crime After Crime. Arthur Gask died on 25 June 1951, in an Adelaide private hospital."

Armaan was set to star in Deewana opposite the late actress Divya Bharti, but walked out of the film after completing the first shooting schedule and later Shahrukh Khan was penciled in as his replacement, and ironically for Armaan, Deewana became a Blockbuster. He starred in several other films in the 1990s including Dushman Zamana (1992), Aulad Ke Dushman (1993) and Qahar (1997). After a five-year hiatus, he returned with the multi-starrer Jaani Dushman: Ek Anokhi Kahani. In 2002 he was in the news when his car hit a pedestrian. He made his last film appearance in 2003's LOC: Kargil. In September 2013, he joined the reality television series Bigg Boss 7 as a contestant. On 16 December 2013 he was arrested for alleged physical abuse with his co-participant, Sofia Hayat during the show. He was released on bail next day. He was evicted from the show on 22 December. He made a comeback to Bollywood after 12 years in the Rajshri Productions Salman Khan starrer Prem Ratan Dhan Payo which released on 12 November 2015."

Abdul Hamid was the first of the clandestine surveyors sent by Montgomerie into Central Asia. In 1863 he was sent to survey the road to Yarkand in East (\"Chinese\") Turkestan (now Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, China). After reaching Yarkand, the capital of an ancient Buddhist kingdom on the southern arm of the Silk Road trading route, he lived there for six months making observations on the area. After he fell ill and died returning through the Karakoram mountains, William Johnson, another employee of the Survey, recovered his survey notes and sent them on to Montgomerie. Montgomerie subsequently presented a paper to the Royal Geographical Society about Abdul Hamid's expedition, \"On the Geographical Position of Yarkund and Other Places in Central Asia\"."

  "text" : "Abdul Karim Khan was the ruler of Yarkand Khanate in what is now north-west China (Xinjiang) between 1560 and 1591. He was second son of Abdurashid Khan. During his reign, he lost control over a number of oases and was only the titular figurehead ruler. Abdul Karim Khan was a descendant of the first Moghul Khan Tughlugh Timur (1347-1363). He came to power in 1560. He became the Khan as the eldest son in the family after the death of his father Abdurashid Khan. Abdul Karim Khan distributed between his brothers all the troops that he inherited from his father and increased troop numbers following the failed attempt by the Barlas emirs to replace him with his brother Sufi Sultan, who ruled in Kashgar. He expelled the hakim of Yarkand, Mahmud Barlas, and the emir of Khotan, Ahmad Barlas, and dispersed their 3,000 troops. He sent his brother Abduraim Sultan to rule Chalish and Turpan, where the position of \"Little Khan\" (contrary to the \"Great Khan\" who ruled from Yarkand) was vacant after the death of Shah Khan, son of Mansur Khan, in 1570 in a battle with the Kalmaks. Abdul Karim Khan's reign was generally tranquil thanks to the absence of wars. Contemporary Balkh historian Mahmud ibn Vali wrote in 1644 in his work \" Bahr al-asrar \" that: Peace and tranquillity and public security of the people of Uyghurstan was so widespread during the rule of Abdul Karim Khan that it caused envy among neighbouring countries. During Abdul Karim Khan's reign, Khoja Ishak Wali, 4th son of Nakshbandi sheikh Mahdum-i- Azam and founder of Sufi Order, Ishakiyya, disciples of which were later known as Karataghliks or Black Mountaineers, came to Yarkand at the Khan's invitation. He was unable to attract Abdul Karim Khan to his sect, but was allowed to carry out his missionary work among the population of the Yarkand Khanate during which time 40,000 became his disciples with 164 becoming teachers of his sect. Khoja Ishak Wali managed to attract to his sect a younger brother of Abdul Karim Khan, Muhammad Sultan, who became Khan in 1591. Khoja Ishak Wali died in 1599. Abdul Karim Khan died in 1591 and was succeeded by his brother Muhammad Sultan."

Chen is the creator of The Pamphlette, a \"humor publication\" for Reed College students on a piece of letter-size paper. He has written for the New York Times, New York Magazine, Wired, and other publications. In October 2012, Chen exposed the real name and details of Violentacrez (a moderator of several Reddit Jailbait communities), a Texas internet developer, who was subsequently fired from his job. This led to all links to Gawker being temporarily banned from Reddit. In September 2012, Chen acquiesced to demands from Anonymous and posted images of himself dressed in a tutu with a shoe perched on his head. The images had been demanded in exchange for interviews regarding an alleged leak of Apple iPhone and iPad user data from an FBI laptop. In 2016, he became a staff writer for The New Yorker."

  "text" : "Ambrogio Maestri (born 1970) is an Italian operatic baritone. He is especially known for his portrayal of the title character in Giuseppe Verdi's Falstaff. He studied piano and singing in his home town, Pavia. In Italy he has performed at the Teatro alla Scala in Milan, Teatro San Carlo in Naples, Teatro Regio in Parma, Teatro dell'Opera in Rome, Teatro Regio in Turin, Teatro Verdi in Trieste and the Arena di Verona. Abroad he has performed at the Deutsche Oper in Berlin, Teatro Nacional de Sao Carlos in Lisbon, the Royal Opera House in London, the Teatro Real in Madrid, the Metropolitan Opera in New York City, San Francisco Opera House, the Konzerthaus the Staatsoper in Vienna, the Gran Teatre del Liceu in Barcelona and others. He presents as a powerful, robust man on stage. Gramophone has described him as Italy's answer to Bryn Terfel, \"fresh-voiced [and] emotionally sympathetic.\"He has been critically praised by the likes of Riccardo Muti. Edward Seckerson of The Independent said of his performance as Falstaff at the Royal Opera House of London that he is \"wonderfully real, animating all aspects of the text and making great play of the innate contradiction between a booming, boorish, authority and those mellifluous remnants of wily old airs and graces.\" In 2003 he played Rolando in La battaglia di Legnano at the Teatro San Carlo. In 2012 he played the role of Dr Dulcamara in Gaetano Donizetti's L'elisir d'amore in Vienna, and at the Metropolitan Opera in September and October alongside Anna Netrebko. In December 2013 he gave his 200th performance of Falstaff in a new production by the Metropolitan Opera in New York."

But after some time they reveal themselves as sensitive and involved responses to an earlier generation's visual culture.\""

A key player for Iraklis, he helped the club win their 3rd regional championship in 1927. He was also one of the players who were selected for Greece's first international game against Italy's second team. The game was held in Athens on 7 April 1929 and Nahmias scored the first ever goal of the national team in the 60th minute, leveling the match at 1–1. Greece eventually lost 1–4. Apart from football, Nahmias was a track and field athlete, excelling in 100 metres, 400 metres hurdles and 4 × 100 metres relay. His performances allowed him to qualify for the 1924 Summer Olympics in Paris, but his participation was prevented by SEGAS, which refused to allow Macedonian athletes to travel to Paris due to financial reasons. In 1936, he was chosen as one of the 19 athletes in Thessaloniki who participated in the first Olympic torch relay. During the Greco-Italian War, Nahmias was drafted among the other 12.898 Greek Jews. He returned to Thessaloniki, after he was injured in the front."

He first appears in 1429, as governor (kephale) of Vostitza (modern Aigio), taking part in the siege of Patras by the Despot of the Morea (and later last Byzantine Emperor) Constantine Palaiologos. An opponent of the Union of the Churches, he corresponded with Gennadios Scholarios and Bessarion (who composed a treatise on the procession of the Holy Spirit for him), and took part in the 1439 Council of Florence, but left it early. In 1446 he was named kephale of Patras. Constantine Palaiologos sent him to Emperor John VIII Palaiologos in Constantinople in autumn 1448 to settle a dispute with his brother Thomas Palaiologos, but before Alexios arrived at the capital, he learned that the Emperor had died. In December he set out for Mistra along with Manuel Iagaris Palaiologos to bring the news of John's death and Constantine's proclamation as Emperor and oversee his coronation (January 1449)."

His work includes the world's first cable car on multiple supports in 1644. It was the biggest built till the end of 19th century. He lived in Gdańsk since ca. 1616. He became famous for many inventions and constructions: a horse-driven dredger, river ice cutter, and an acqueduct taking Radunia River waters over the moat in the Hucisko crossroads area. The construction in 1644 of rope railway was his most famous realization. Admittedly, during previous centuries there were already ropeways which resembled cable cars in existence, but Wybe changed and improved it as follows:It is the first to use industrially, a cable (instead of a rope) in loop and continuous motion, and the first to multiply the 'vehicles'. It improved it by supporting the cable by pylons equipped with pulleys, and unloaded of the basket 'vehicles' by means of a swing. The machine was longer than 200 meters. It includes 7 wooden pylons, and seems to carry a score about 120 'vehicles'."

  "text" : "Anne Walker was a British astronomer and one of the first women employed in paid routine work in astronomy in her country. She was one of a number of women computers employed at Cambridge Observatory between 1876 and 1904. Unlike most of these women, Walker remained at the observatory for a significant period of time. Walker was born at Wickham Market, Suffolk in 1864. She was employed by the observatory in 1879 at the age of 15, and remained there for 24 years, working under astronomers John Couch Adams and Robert Stawell Ball. She worked most directly with the observatory's senior assistant at the time, Andrew Graham. The observatory necessitated that only two observers worked at any one time. Up until 1892, Walker substituted for Graham's current assistant Henry Todd when Todd's ill health prevented him from observing. That Walker was making transit observations with the meridian circle in the mid-1880s is clear from an observatory report that stated her work was interrupted by an earth tremor on 22 April 1884, when she had to stop while wires in the eyepiece vibrated. From 1892, Walker became Graham's observation partner and from 1894 to 1896, she observed alone. Andrew Graham retired in 1903 at the age of eighty-eight. Anne Walker resigned at the same time as him, bringing her astronomical career at the Cambridge Observatory to an end after 21 years. It has been suggested that Walker was much more than a routine computer, and that she took part in observations with Graham. If true, this makes her the second woman (after Caroline Herschel) to have been recorded formally engaging in night-time astronomical observations."

Nazi German authorities limited the education of ethnic Polish children to only four years during the occupation of Poland in order to undermine Polish culture. Despite the ban, Dobrowolski joined the Secret Teaching Organization to provide underground education in occupied Poland, according to Auschwitz historian Adam Cyra. Dobrowolski was discovered and arrested in June 1942 by the Gestapo. He was sent to the Auschwitz concentration camp, where he was assigned the prisoner number 38081. Dobrowolski later recalled that \"Auschwitz was worse than Dante's hell.\" He was transferred to the Gross-Rosen concentration camp and Sachsenhausen concentration camp, remaining a prisoner until his release in 1945. He moved to Debno, Poland, following the end of World War II following his liberation. He worked as an elementary school teacher, before becoming the director of a high school. Dorbrowolski died on October 21, 2012, in Debno, Poland, at the age of 108. He was the oldest known survivor of Auschwitz at the time."

  "text" : "Alexander Friedrich Just (12 April 1874 in Bremen – 30 May 1937 in Budapest) was a German/Hungarian chemist and inventor. Later, in Hungary he used the name Just Sándor Frigyes. In 1904 with Croatian Franjo Hanaman he was the first to develop and patent an incandescent light bulb with a tungsten filament, made by extruding a paste of tungsten powder and a carbonaceous binder to produce a fine thread, then removing the carbon by heating in an atmosphere of hydrogen and water vapor. Just and Hanaman received a Hungarian patent in 1904 and later US Patent 1,018,502. In 1905, Just and Hanaman patented a process for producing tungsten filaments by plating carbon filaments with tungsten, then removing the carbon by heating. These early tungsten lamps were more efficient than a carbon filament lamp, because they could operate at a high temperature, due to the high melting point of tungsten. The tungsten was, however, so brittle that these lamps were of limited practical use. It was supplanted by the drawn tungsten filament lamp, developed in 1910 by William David Coolidge."

  "text" : "Alex Mendelssohn (born 30 May 1935) is an Australian artist and opal miner of Hungarian descent. popularly known as Alex or his birth name Sándor Mendelssohn (variant of the name Alexander in Hungary), he is the great-great-grandson of Felix Mendelssohn, the Romantic German composer who gave the world the famous Wedding March overture. In an interview with Adelaide Now (Sunday Mail September 2000) Alex Mendelssohn is quoted as saying \"He (Felix Mendelssohn) composed on piano, and I compose on canvas,\" reflecting on his 200-year ancestry. In another interview \"His Colorful Life\", he professed to Kristina Meredith of Country Press South Australia that he is a born rebel and an adventurer at heart. Alex migrated from war-worn Hungary in the early 1950s to mine for opal in the stark opal town of Andamooka where the famous Andamooka Opal or Queen's Opal was discovered in the 1950s and presented to Queen Elizabeth II. For Alex Mendelssohn, the isolated outback community built upon red earth, nicknamed ‘Mars on Earth' presents the freedom he craves, far away from the shackles of politics, war, and bureaucracy of his early years. In a radio interview 6.30 with George Negus (28 June 2004) Alex Mendelssohn expressed the reason he calls Andamooka his home: \"You're not controlled by councils and regulations and laws and rules. You do whatever you bloody like.\""

  "text" : "Sir Alan Herries Wilson (2 July 1906 – 30 September 1995), was a British mathematician and industrialist. He was educated at Cambridge University, obtaining a B. S. degree in mathematics in 1926. His graduate work was under the supervision of R.H. Fowler working on problems in quantum mechanics. He studied with Werner Heisenberg on the application of quantum mechanics to electrical conduction in metals and semiconductors. During the period 1931–1932 Wilson formulated a theory explaining how energy bands of electrons can make a material a conductor, a semiconductor or an insulator. In 1932 he was awarded the Adams Prize; the essay he wrote for this prize became the basis for his book The Theory of Metals published in 1936. His book Semi-conductors and Metals was published in 1939. Wilson supervised four graduate students in the study of solid-state physics during the 1930s, but Wilson perceived that interest in the field was small at Cambridge and so switched to the study of nuclear physics and cosmic rays. Wilson was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1942 for his work in advancing the theory of conduction in metals and semiconductors. During the Second World War he worked on radio communications problems for the SOE, and was later attached to the British Tube Alloys project to develop the atomic bomb. After the Second World War he left academic research and became an industrialist, joining British textile company Courtaulds to supervise their research and development of artificial fibres. He continued his interest in mathematical physics and prepared a second edition of The Theory of Metals in 1953. He published Thermodynamics and Statistical Mechanics in 1957. Wilson served as the second President of the combined Institute of Physics and the Physical Society from 1962 to 1964. In 1962 he left Courtaulds due in part to a takeover bid by ICI and joined Glaxo,a pharmacy company, becoming chairman in 1963 until his retirement in 1973. During Wilson's time at Glaxo the company was successful in greatly expanding its business. Wilson was knighted in 1961. He was married in 1934 to Margaret Monks (??– 8 June 1961), with two sons (Peter, born 1939, and John, born 1944)."

Peckover was born at Wisbech, Cambridgeshire, the son of Algernon Peckover, of Bank House, Wisbech, by Priscilla Alexander, daughter of Dykes Alexander, a banker, of Ipswich, Suffolk. He was educated at Grove House School, Tottenham, London. The Peckovers were a Quaker banking family and owners of the Peckover Bank, which later merged into Gurney, Peckover and Company, of which he was a partner between 1847 and 1894. His sister Priscilla Hannah Peckover was a pacifist and linguist.In his retirement he devoted himself mainly to metereological studies and the collection of ancient manuscripts. He was a Fellow of the Royal Geographical Society, the Society of Antiquaries and the Linnean Society of London and a member of the Hakluyt Society and the British Numismatic Society. In 1893 he was appointed Lord-Lieutenant of Cambridgeshire, a post he held until 1906. The following year he was raised to the peerage as Baron Peckover, of Wisbech in the County of Cambridge. He had only daughters and is said to have declined the offer a special remainder that would have allowed the title to descend through his daughter to his grandson, stating that \"if my grandson want the title he should earn it\". Lord Peckover married Eliza Sharples, daughter of Joseph Sharples, a banker, of Hitchin, Hertfordshire, in 1858. They had three daughters. Eliza died in August 1862, only a year after the birth of her youngest child. Lord Peckover remained a widower until his death in October 1919, aged 89. His title died with him. His daughter Elizabeth married the artist J. Doyle Penrose."

He handed the Imperial Regalia to Frederick II and retired to Brunswick, where he spent the rest of his life in peace.  In 1223, he declared that Otto the Child, the only son of his brother William would be the sole heir of the Welf allodial possessions in Saxony.  He died in 1227.  He had two daughters and a son by his wife Agnes.  He had already transferred the Palatinate to his son, Henry II.  However, Henry II died in 1214.  It appears that after 1214, Frederick II handed the Palatinate to Duke Louis I, as there are no deeds dated after 1214 in which Henry call himself Count Palatine or takes any action regarding the Palatinate.  Henry married his daughter Agnes to Duke Otto the Illustrious of Bavaria and her sister Irmengard to Herman of Baden.  There is a theory that the Getrude of Brunswick who married Duke Frederick of Austria may have been a daughter of our Henry.  After the death of his beloved Agnes of the Palatinate, Henry remarried to Agnes of Landsberg.  From this second marriage, he had no children." ]

While underlining historically sustained structural conditions that are amenable to Hindi’s increasing status as an all-India link language, he prefers to investigate the plethora of Dalit, Muslim, and women’s writings to unravel the problems and prospects of the increased plurality of Hindi’s own cultural democracy. The outcome of his findings seeks to challenge established social science wisdom that imposes a secular-communal \"quick-fix\" on the history of Hindi.

His political career, coinciding with the terminal decline of the Abbasid state, was turbulent, marked by a power struggle with his rival Abu 'l-Hasan Ali ibn al-Furat and his supporters, resulting in frequent periods of exile. In contrast to the largesse and extravagance of Ibn al-Furat, Ali ibn Isa was austere and a determined opponent of corruption, which earned him many enemies. Nevertheless, he was later remembered as the \"good vizier\" for his administrative talent and honesty."

He ran his father's store in Green Bay with his brother, Pierre, Jr., from the time of his father's death in 1795 until 1805 when he moved to property his wife inherited near Kaukauna. He continued in general trade, farmed, and built a flourmill and gristmill in 1821. In 1832, he was granted the first private property in Columbia County, at strategic Fort Winnebago. In 1834 he went into semi-retirement, engaging in the fur trade at Butte des Morts. He died on October 2, 1860 at Butte des Morts."

He was born in 1965 in Calcutta, and started early in his chosen profession. His association with the Bengal television industry in India for the last twenty years has yielded over five thousand hours of television programming. From popular sitcoms to news, from current affairs to television drama-series and made-for-television films, he has directed almost all the genres of television program that exist today. He was also the Executive Producer of the National Award winning English Feature Film 15 Park Avenue, directed by Aparna Sen and the critically acclaimed film Yatra, directed by Goutam Ghose. The directorial debut of Agnidev Chatterjee Probhu Noshto Hoi Jai, (Lord Let the Devil Steal My Soul) was nominated for Golden Crow Pheasant at the Kerala Film Festival. shot in stark black-and-white, explores the gray areas of human conscience in man-woman sexuality that flouts barriers of age, status and relationship. Agnidev Chatterjee's second film Charuulata 2011 is inspired by Rabindranath Tagore's short story, Noshtonirh, earlier the source for the Satyajit Ray classic. Significantly different, it veers away from the confines of the period drama, and sets it in time contemporary, with its inherent complexities and moral chaos. Agnidev Chatterjee's third film 3 Kanya is a diabolical tale of passion, crime, lust and inevitable retribution"

He was the son of Paweł Sapieha, and brother of Mikołaj and Bohdan. Between 1575–1578 he took part in the Livonian War, fighting against the Tsardom of Russia. He was the second in command, after Mikołaj \"the Red\" Radziwiłł of the Polish-Lithuanian forces in the campaign of 1577–1578, and led allied Polish–Lithuanian and Swedish forces at the Battles of Wenden (1577–1578), where with 5-6 thousand soldiers he defeated a numerically superior Russian army. After Zygmunt III Vasa came to the Polish throne in 1587, thanks to the support of the chancellor and kin Lew Sapieha, Andrzej was made the Great Royal Deputy Cup-bearer of Lithuania. On May 29, 1592 he was named castellan of Minsk. He traveled abroad, mostly to Italy, in 1579, 1592 and 1608. Towards the end of his life he was made the voivode of Smolensk but most likely did not get to officially assume this office. He died on October 11, 1621."

  "text" : "For a history of Afro-Caribbean people in the UK, see British African Caribbean community.

Most Afro-Caribbeans are the descendants of captive Africans held in the Caribbean from 1502 to 1886 during the era of the Atlantic slave trade. Black people from the Caribbean who have migrated (voluntarily, or by force) to the U.S., Canada, Europe, Africa and elsewhere add a significant Diaspora element to Afro-Caribbean history. Because of the complex history of the region, many people who identify as Afro-Caribbean also have European, Middle Eastern, Taino, Chinese and/or East Indian genealogies. It is these peoples, who in the past were referred to and self-identified collectively as Coloured, Black or Negro West Indians, who now generally consider themselves to be black, mixed heritage, creole or African descendant people in the Caribbean and its Diasporas. Their history has been studied by historians such as C.L.R. James (author of The Black Jacobins), Eric Williams and Peter Fryer – and it is their history that is the focus of this article."

  "text" : "Alexander Ivanovich Chuprov (Александр Иванович Чупров; 1841–1908) was a professor of political economy and statistics at Moscow University whose lectures provided the standard introduction to economics for late 19th-century Russian students. Chuprov's father was an Orthodox priest based in Mosalsk. Alexander attended the Law Department of the Moscow University where he became interested in Wilhelm Roscher's research. He founded the Moscow Society to Disseminate Technical Knowledge in 1869 and was elected into the Russian Academy of Sciences in 1887. Chuprov has been described as the founder of transport economics and the multiple-factor analysis of economic regions. In his landmark work The Railway Economy (1875–78) he analyzed statistics on railway traffic. He distinguished one region from another according to \"the value of the market, the cost of transportation, and demographic indicators\". Chuprov became known as \"the heart and soul\" of zemstvo statistical investigations and sample surveys in the Russian Empire. His researchers are said to have interviewed 4.5 million Russian muzhiks. Their mission was to provide a modern statistical description of the Russian peasant commune, or obschina. Chuprov viewed the Russian obshchina as a valuable social institution which should be preserved. Chuprov was a lifelong friend of another prominent statistician, Ivan Yanzhul. His son Alexander A. Chuprov (1874–1926) is said to have given \"much impetus to statistics in pre-revolutionary Russia\"."

  "text" : "Arthur Bartholomew (3 December 1833 Bruton, Somerset – 19 August 1909 Melbourne) was an English-born Australian engraver, lithographer and natural history illustrator. He was the son of Thomas Bartholomew, a builder, and Charlotte Wright. Bartholomew was apprenticed to an engraver in Exeter and acquired some lithographic training. He sailed for Australia aboard the Oriental in 1852, arriving in Melbourne in December 1852. Here he spent some time exploring the outback before sailing to Tasmania, where he was to meet his future wife, Eliza Ann Nicholls. Returning to Melbourne, he became assistant to William Blandowski, producing illustrations for an encyclopedia on the natural history of Australia. Blandowski became involved in a dispute with fellow members of the Philosophical Institute when he named two new fish species after two of the members. This in itself was not unusual, but when he used phrases such as 'slimy', 'slippery', 'low forehead' and 'big belly' in his descriptions, turmoil ensued. Bartholomew made use of the hiatus to travel to Longford in Tasmania, where he married Eliza in 1856. They produced two children – Christianna in 1857 and Ethelinda in 1858, and then returned to Melbourne, where they produced a further six children - Arthur Hubert in 1861, Emma Edith in 1863, Eliza Maud in 1865, Jessie Charlotte in 1867, Hubert Marion in 1870 and Arthur Percy in 1872. On 1 September 1859 Arthur was appointed Attendant to Frederick McCoy in the department of Natural History at the newly established Melbourne University. For the next six months he diligently attended McCoy's lectures and worked in his laboratory. Bartholomew was given increasing responsibility as McCoy became aware of his artistic talents and the potential of his contribution to future projects. Bartholomew started on a series of zoological and geological illustrations, laying the groundwork for the \"Prodromus of the Zoology of Victoria\" and \"Prodromus of the Palaeontology of Victoria\". In the next forty years he illustrated some 700 natural history specimens."

Corona started out her sporting career as an adventurer and cross-country racer in 2000, until she began with triathlon at the ITU Triathlon Pan American Cup in Puerto Vallarta two years later. In 2005, she finally reached into the international scene, and made a comeback in triathlon after pursuing her full-time sporting career in mountain biking. In the same year, she had also achieved her first medal, by claiming the silver at the ITU Triathlon Pan American Cup in Ixtapa. Corona competed at the 2006 Central American and Caribbean Games, where she won gold medals in the women's individual and team events, along with her compatriot Melody Ramirez. Corona's best result in these games contributed to her qualifying place for the 2007 Pan American Games in Rio de Janeiro, where she placed seventh in the women's event, and consequently, for the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing. At the Olympics, Corona maintained her pace in a field of fifty-five competitors during the swimming leg, but she got lapped by the leader in the road cycling course."
