When Johnson put control of the Boston Red Sox under Jimmy McAleer, he sent McRoy to serve as McAleer's secretary. McRoy worked for the Red Sox from 1912 through 1913. When Joseph Lannin purchased the Red Sox in 1913, McRoy returned to work for Johnson. In the 1916-17 offseason, McRoy and Johnson recruited Jim Dunn to head up a syndicate to buy the Cleveland Indians baseball team from Charles Somers for $500,000. McRoy served as general manager of the Cleveland Indians from 1916 through 1917. McRoy was survived by his wife; however, she died of poisoning one week after her husband."

He played 135 matches for Counties between 1971 and 1982, making his debut for the union at the age of 19. He was the All Black centre (No 13) for much of the 1970s, and was admired for his pace, silky pass and swerve, and his thinking approach to the game. Robertson is regarded as one of the best centres in New Zealand rugby history. He did play against all-white South African teams during the Apartheid era, in common with many All Blacks at the time. However, he declared himself unable to play against the Springboks during the New Zealand 1981 tour. This was due to his 'personal abhorrence of apartheid,' following his tour of South Africa."

He was a candidate in the Colorado Party's 1996 primary election for the 1998 presidential election, backed by Lino Oviedo. He was leader of the Movimiento Tradicionalismo Democrático (TRADEM), and one of the major financiers of the Colorado Party. He was President of the Chamber of Industry until 1984. As a businessman, Riquelme was director/president of a number of companies, including Cereales S.A. (flour and cereals); Cervecera Asunción S.A. and Cervecera Itapúa S.A. (beer); Cadena Real S.A. (supermarkets); Campo Morumbí S.A. (farming); and Cristalera Asunción S.A. (glass). He is also a major landowner. In 1985 he ordered the removal of 100 Mbayá people from his 75,000 hectare landholding in the Alto Paraná Department; he had previously pressured them for ten years to leave their ancestral Paso Romero community, after he had purchased the property. In 2012 the violent removal of occupying farmers from Riquelme's land in the Canindeyú Department sparked the impeachment of Fernando Lugo. He has been unsuccessfully sued by farmers alleging irregularities in his 1975 acquisition of land (under the dictatorship of Alfredo Stroessner), following Truth and Justice Commission conclusions of irregularities."

  "text" : "Boris Grigoryevich Chukhnovsky (Russian: Борис Григорьевич Чухновский, 9 April [O.S. 28 March] 1898, Saint Petersburg - September 30, 1975, Moscow) was a Russian and Soviet pilot and Arctic explorer. He participation in the rescue of the Airship Italia in 1928 and in the search of the Sigizmund Levanevsky airplane in 1937-1938. He also created, together with Robert Bartini, a dedicated airplane for Arctic research (the Bartini DAR). Boris Chukhnovsky was born in Saint Petersburg and graduated from a Realschule in Gatchina. In June 1916 he enlisted himself to Navy, as his father insisted, however, in March 1917 he transferred to the School of Naval Pilots, in Petrograd. He graduated from the School in November 1917, and was eventually appointed Chief of Oranienbaum air detachment of the Baltic Sea. Between November 1918 and July 1920 he was involved in the Russian Civil War as a pilot on the Red Army side, mostly in the southern front. In the Fall of 1923 Chukhnovsky was dispatched to the Naval Academy in Petrograd. Next year, he was working as an intern on the cartography and hydrography of the Russian Arctic. In particular, as a part of the Northern Hydrographic Expedition headed by Nikolay Matusevich, Chukhnovsky performed a number of flights from Novaya Zemlya to the Barents and Kara Seas. In 1925 he continued this work by taking the aerial photos of Novaya Zemlya in the region of the Matochkin Strait. In 1927, he dropped out of the Naval Academy and started to work full-time as an Arctic pilot. He was essentially one of the pioneers of Soviet Arctic aviation. In May 1928, the Soviet Union joined the efforts to save the Airship Italia expedition returning from the North Pole. The icebreaker Krasin was detached to participate in the rescue efforts, and the Soviet part of the efforts was coordinated by Rudolf Samoylovich, Paul Oras, and Chukhnovsky. On July 10 Chukhnovsky performed the second flight (after an earlier abortive attempt) and discovered the group of Finn Malmgren which was sent from the Italia crew to the mainland. He reported the discovery to the Krasin, however, subsequently due to limited visibility was not able to return to the icebreaker and landed on ice when the fuel was running out. Chukhnovsky send a radio message to Krasin giving detailed info on the Malmgren group location and insisting that rescuing the group has a higher priority than rescuing the Chukhnovsky plane. Malmgren died, but the two other members of the froup, Philippo Zappi and Arcibaldo Mariano, were taken on board of the Krasin on July 12. On July 15 and 16 Chukhnovsky and his plane were taken on board as well. For five days, Chukhnovsky was staying on ice. Boris Chukhnovsky was awarded the Order of the Red Banner, at the time the highest award of the Soviet Union, for his participation in the rescue efforts. In 1928 and 1929 he toured Europe giving presentations on the expedition. (Chukhnovsky spoke German and French in addition to his native Russian). In 1929, Boris Chukhnovsky started to work for the Chief Directorate of the Northern Sea Route and participated in creation of the Arctic aviation service. He was the head of the service until 1931. Between 1931 and 1933, he was making flights in order to get information on the ice situation in the Arctic. Until that point, Soviet Arctic aviation only used foreign-made aircraft (predominantly Junkers). In June 1933, Chukhnovsky was tasked with developing a Soviet-made flying boat which could work in the Arctic. The constructor of the DAR airplane, of which only one machine was produced, was Robert Bartini. During World War II Boris Chukhnovsky was attached to the White Sea Flotilla, and in February 1943 transferred to the Chief Directorate of the Northern Sea Route, where he was tasked with the ice reconnaissance for the military convoys. In July 1945, he was discharged from the Soviet Army and simultaneously made a colonel. Chukhnovsky died in 1975 and is buried in Gatchina."

  "text" : "Beatrice of Savoy (before 4 March 1223 – 10 May before 1259) was a daughter of Amadeus IV, Count of Savoy and his first wife Marguerite of Burgundy. She was a member of the House of Savoy by birth and by her first marriage she was Marchioness consort of Saluzzo. Beatrice was the elder of two daughters; her younger sister Margaret was married to Boniface II, Marquess of Montferrat. After the death of their mother, their father married Cecile of Baux and had further children including Boniface, Count of Savoy and a younger Beatrice. Beatrice was first betrothed not long after her birth on 4 March 1223 to Manfred III, Marquess of Saluzzo. However, the contract was broken off but was then renewed on 2 October 1227; a contract signed on that date refers to the dowry of Beatrice. The couple were married in March 1233. They were married for eleven years until Manfred's death in 1244, leaving Beatrice with two children and pregnant with twins. They had the following children: 1.  \n* Alice (c. 1236 – before 12 Jul 1311), married Edmund de Lacy, Baron of Pontefract and had issue 2.  \n* Thomas (1239–1296), succeeded Manfred as Marquess 3.  \n* Agnes (1245 – after 4 August 1265), born posthumously, married John, son of Eustace de Vesci, no issue 4.  \n* Margaret (born 1245), born posthumously, twin of Agnes Only two years after Manfred's death on 8 May 1246, Beatrice was betrothed a second time to Manfred, an illegitimate son of Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor by his mistress and possibly wife Bianca Lancia. Her marriage was arranged to recognize an alliance between Beatrice's father and Frederick. The couple were married by proxy in March 1247 and the marriage contract was signed on 21 April 1247. Manfred and Beatrice had one daughter, Constance (1249-1302) who went on to marry Peter III of Aragon and became mother Alfonso III of Aragon, James II of Aragon and Elizabeth of Aragon. In a testament from Beatrice's father dated 24 May 1253, the succession rights of Beatrice were bypassed in favor of her younger half-brother; the testament fails to mention Beatrice's second husband, possibly indicating a breakdown in the marriage. Beatrice died before 1259. Her husband became King of Sicily in 1258 and went on to marry Helena Angelina Doukaina and father children with her."

From March 15, 2012, the one-year anniversary of the Syrian uprising, he was detained by the Syrian government at Adra Prison in Damascus. As of October 3, 2015, he had been transferred to an unknown location, probably to be judged by a military court. On October 7, 2015, Human Rights Watch and 30 other human rights organizations issued a letter demanding that Khartabil's whereabouts be disclosed. On November 11, 2015, rumors surfaced that Khartabil had been secretly sentenced to death. Khartabil was born in Damascus and raised in Syria, where he specializes in open source software development. He has been chief technology officer (CTO) and co-founder of collaborative research company Aiki Lab and was CTO of Al-Aous, a publishing and research institution dedicated to archaeological sciences and arts in Syria. He has served as project lead and public affiliate for Creative Commons Syria, and has contributed to Mozilla Firefox, Wikipedia, Openclipart, Fabricatorz, and Sharism. He \"is credited with opening up the Internet in Syria and vastly extending online access and knowledge to the Syrian people.\" His most recent work includes a 3D virtual reconstruction of the ancient city of Palmyra in Syria, real time visualization, and development with Fabricatorz for the web programming framework Aiki Framework."

She was born in Hackettstown, New Jersey. She caused a stir when she disappeared for some 24 hours after winning the title. Evidently overwhelmed by what was expected of her, she insisted upon a much lighter schedule than planned by pageant officials so that she could attend college. This led pageant officials to have future contestants sign agreements as to what was expected of the winner. Cooper attended Centenary Junior College (now Centenary College of New Jersey) in Hackettstown, where she was a member of the Delta Sigma Sigma sorority and graduated in 1938 at ceremonies attended by Governor of New Jersey A. Harry Moore. As of 2015, she is the earliest and oldest Miss America awardee/title holder still living. She has two children, Cheryl and Gregory, as well as four grandchildren, Adriane, Derek, Noelle, and Sarah. Cooper, who did some modeling and appearances in the years after her title, has long shunned any connection or involvement with Miss America."

  "text" : "Bente Hammer (born 1950) is a Danish textile artist and fashion designer. Born in Helsinge in the north of Zealand, she moved to the island of Bornholm in 1987 where she opened a workshop and boutique in an old smithy on Nyker Hovedgade, the main street in Nyker, about 7 km northeast of Ronne. In 2011, she opened a second store in Svaneke together with the jewellery designer Nina Schrøder. She is said to make \"one-of-a-kind clothing made of handprinted textiles\". She uses a wealth of different materials in her works and has created many colorful printed fabrics. Hammer has designed dresses for clients such as Queen Margrethe and the actress Ghita Nørby. A kimono designed by Hammer was presented to Queen Margrethe on the occasion of her 70th birthday by Bornholm Regional Municipality. In an extensive interview on Denmark's TV2, she explains how she learnt the art of textile design at Mulle Høyrups Eksperimentelle Værkstedskole, a small specialized school with only six students. There she was able to appreciate the individuality of the craft at a time when most of those working in the textile business simply worked for large international producers. She completed her studies in 1973. In October 2012, Hammer who is a member of ACAB Arts and Crafts Bornholm was together with the association's president, Maibritt Jønsson, selected to represent the island of Bornholm at a conference on creative design in eastern Iceland with a view to inspiring local craftsmen in their work."

Henry graduated from Los Angeles High School in 1909, and accompanied his father on a missionary trip to Australia and New Zealand the following year. He attended the University of Sydney, and eventually enrolled at Occidental College in 1912. He began reporting on sports for the Los Angeles Times the same year, while playing football and track, and performing in the glee club at Occidental until his graduation in 1914. Henry married Corinne Stanton in 1914, with whom he fathered three daughters. In 1919, he briefly left his position at the Times and moved his family to Cleveland, where he worked at an aircraft plant with Glenn L. Martin. He was an aviation enthusiast, and assisted Donald Douglas in establishing the Douglas Aircraft Company in Los Angeles in 1920. From 1920–1926, Henry served as editor of Touring Topics, a membership magazine produced by the Automobile Club of Southern California. Henry worked as a war correspondent for the Times from 1939–1942, and reported on sports, political conventions, and presidential travel as a news broadcaster for Mutual Broadcasting System (MBS), CBS, and NBC throughout his career. He was also the president of the Radio and Television Correspondents' Association (RTCA) from 1947–1948, and chairman of the Political Conventions Committee of the RTCA from 1952–1968. Henry continued to write for the Times until his death in 1970 at age 80. Shortly before his death, Henry was announced as a recipient of the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest civilian award in the United States."

On 22 March 1302 he signed a treaty with the abbot of Ossegg, wherein he agreed to share the mining profits with Osek Abbey. Following the death of King Wenceslaus II and the murder of his successor, Wenceslaus III one year later, a new wave of violence swept through Bohemia, as the powerful princes attempted to extend their estates and wealth during the interregnum. Church assets were seized, but attempts were also made to rectify the injustices of the past. Boresch, too, could not resist further extending his power. In 1307 he was named as the owner of Sayda, this time however not as part of the Bohemian Empire but as an enfeoffment from the Margraviate of Meissen. He was only mentioned once more before his death. In the treaty documents of 1312 his name no longer appears."

He was one of the Churchwardens of the Parish in 1662, and his death is recorded in the Parish Register of 11 June 1690. His initials “B. R. 1660\" were cut on a large stone block, originally one of the jambs in the old ingle nook of the \"Black Bull Inn.\" Rothbury, now long since demolished.(The Black Bull had been the venue of the magistrates monthly meeting, and also of the county court sessions). The stone was moved to the Newcastle House yard. Rumney was the author of a peculiar and slightly humoorous little ballad entitled “Ecky's Mare\", the full title of which was “An excellent ballad of the sickness, death, and burial, of Ecky’s Mare. Which was made and composed by the late ancient and famous Northern poet, Mr. Bernard Rumney, a musician, or country fiddler, who lived and died at Rothbury, being about one hundred years old at the time of his death”.

  "text" : "Dame Florence Barraclough Lambert DBE (13 August 1871 – 11 December 1957), commonly known as Barrie Lambert or Florence Barrie Lambert, was an English physician and public health administrator. Lambert was born in Northwick Park, Harrow, London, the daughter of Thomas Henry Lambert, a solicitor and coal importer, and his wife Sarah Ann (née Harrison). She was educated in France and then trained as a nurse at the London Hospital from 1895 to 1898. From 1899 to 1901 she served in the South African War as a nursing sister with the Imperial Yeomanry. On her return to England she trained as a doctor at the London School of Medicine for Women, qualifying as MBBS from the University of Durham in 1906. In 1907 she obtained a Diploma in Public Health (DPH) from the University of Cambridge. With a private income, Lambert devoted much time to voluntary child welfare work, becoming honorary director of the Central Council for Infant and Child Welfare, honorary secretary of the Central Council for the Care of Cripples, and a member of council of the Invalid Children's Aid Society. She undertook postgraduate study in physical medicine at the University of Stockholm and then obtained her first paid medical position as physician-in-charge of the mechano-therapeutic department of the Charing Cross Hospital in London and also worked in the departments at St Mary's Hospital and the Royal Free Hospital. In 1915 she was appointed Inspector of Military Massage and Electrical Services in the Royal Army Medical Corps with the honorary rank of major and also became a member of the Electro-Medical Committee of the War Office. She held these posts throughout the rest of the First World War until, in 1919, she was appointed a medical officer with the new Ministry of Health, responsible for the inspection of local authority child welfare and orthopaedic services throughout the country. She was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in January 1920 for her wartime services. In 1921, however, she resigned to enter politics. In March 1922 she was elected an alderman of London County Council for the Municipal Reform Party (Conservative Party from 1945) and almost immediately joined the Public Health Committee, chairing it from 1928. In 1930 it became the Central Health Committee and later the Hospital and Medical Services Committee and took over the 76 hospitals formerly administered by the Metropolitan Asylums Board. She remained chairman until 1934, when the Municipal Reform Party lost its majority, but continued to sit on the committee and co-operate closely with her successor as chairman, Somerville Hastings. In 1938 she was appointed Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire (DBE). With the creation of the National Health Service in 1948, she was appointed to the South-East Metropolitan Regional Hospital Board and chaired the Nursing Committee. She also continued to sit on the LCC Health Committee until she resigned from the council in 1952. She was also vice-president of the Medical Defence Union. Lambert died at her home at 1 Langton Ridge, Langton Green, Kent, on 11 December 1957."

  "text" : "Blandine Verlet (born February 27, 1942 in Paris) is a harpsichordist and a harpsichord teacher. Born into a musical family, she was the seventh of ten children, and in 1957 gained admission to the Paris Conservatoire, studying piano and harpsichord. Having decided on her specialty, she studied harpsichord with Huguette Dreyfus in Paris, Ruggero Gerlin in Siena and Ralph Kirckpatrick in the US. A significant competition prize in Paris in 1963 led to engagements in Italy and West Germany. Verlet has been widely praised for her recordings of Bach, including the 'Goldberg Variations', but it is perhaps in the music of her compatriot Francois Couperin that she displays exceptional sensitivity and imagination. Verlet recorded Couperin's complete works in the 1970s and 80s, and in late 2011 she returned to re-record five 'ordres' on the period Henri Hemsch harpsichord. Verlet wrote a poem in celebration of Couperin which accompanied the release, the closing lines of which exemplify her great imaginative empathy with this key French composer: We hope we too have managed to grasp                         your art of playing the harpsichord.                         The art of both poetry and precision.                         The art of whispering, murmuring.                         The song without words, lighter for having no text.                         Wandering shadows, expressions of the heart.                         Our thanks to you, Francois Couperin.    (tr. Mary Pardoe)"

In November 1760 he was promoted to the rank of colonel, and appointed aide-de-camp to the King. He was promoted to the rank of major-general in 1762, and obtained the colonelcy of the 12th Regiment of Dragoons in 1764, from which he was removed to the 4th Regiment of Dragoons on 24 October 1770. He was a great favourite with King George III, to whom he was made an equerry on 16 December 1760. He was appointed clerk marshal of the mews on 6 April 1771 and principal equerry in the royal establishment on 1 January 1783. Carpenter was promoted to the rank of lieutenant-general in 1772, and to that of general in 1783. In the seventy-fifth year of his age he became so depressed in spirits that his medical attendant directed his servants to watch his motions narrowly, but he eluded their vigilance, and proceeding to Hyde Park, about five o'clock in the morning of 8 March 1788, drowned himself in the Serpentine river. Benjamin Carpenter was married to Mary, youngest daughter and co-heiress of Lieutenant-Colonel Timothy Carr; they had two daughters: \n*  Lucy (1760—1842) who married Captain George Ramsden, 15th Light Dragoons, and by him had three sons; and  \n*  Frances (1761—1827) who married Henry Gough-Calthorpe, 1st Baron Calthorpe. The two daughters were the subject of a 1771 portrait in crayons by Pierre-Joseph Lion."

Dr Burchell is the current Director of Studies in Politics and Sociology for Magdalene College and the Director of the Cambridge Undergraduate Quantitative Methods Centre (CUQM). Dr Burchell read his undergraduate degree in Psychology at Birmingham University from 1977–80, and went on to gain a PhD in Social Psychology from Warwick University researching person perception under laboratory conditions. He then took a one-year post at The City University teaching Social Psychology, Statistics and Computing. His career took a change of direction when, in 1985, he was appointed to the Department of Applied Economics at Cambridge as a Research Officer to assist in a project entitled the Social Change and Economic Life Initiative, working collaboratively with economists, social psychologists and sociologists on a variety of aspects of labour markets and their effects on individuals. In 1988 Dr Burchell transferred from the Department of Applied Economics to take a Lectureship in the Faculty of Social and Political Sciences, specialising in the teaching of data analysis, psychological aspects of unemployment, work intensification, job insecurity as well as undergraduate project work. In 2011 Dr Burchell was awarded the Pilkington Prize, a University of Cambridge award for excellence in teaching. Dr Burchell’s recent research projects have included the effects of labour market experiences on psychological well-being, work intensification and job insecurity; predictors and correlates of the transition into self-employment; managers' and employees' different perspectives on jobs, part-time work and gender differences in working conditions and careers, restless leg syndrome and financial phobia."

  "text" : "Balthasar Benjamin Kindermann (10 April 1636 – 12 February 1706) was a German poet. Kindermann was born in Zittau, the son of a Schwertfeger, a smith who specialized in weapons. He attended the Gymnasium of his home town and was encouraged by Elias Weise. In 1654 he enrolled at the University of Wittenberg to study theology, but he also studied poetry and rhetoric with August Buchner. In 1657 he earned his master's degree in theology. One year later he was crowned as poeta laureatus by Johann Rist; he was made a member of Rist's Elbschwanenorden, the \"Order of Swans of the Elbe\", an association interested in language, in 1660. In 1659 Kindermann became vice principal of the Saldernsche Schule in Brandenburg an der Havel, and was appointed rector in 1664. In 1660 he married Dorothea Schiffner, the daughter of a Swedish captain, with whom he had four sons and two daughters. In 1667 he went to Magdeburg as a deacon at the Johanniskirche. From 1672 he served as first minister of the Ulrichskirche. He succeeded Christian Scriver in 1690 and became head of the school (Scholarch) later. He died in Magdeburg in 1706. Kindermann's work is extremely versatile: it includes satirical \"poems\" in the style of Johann Michael Moscherosch, poetic and rhetorical writings, poetry collections, as well as several plays. He wrote Lobgesang des Zerbster Biers (Song of praise of the Zerbst beer) in 1658. His most successful work, Der Deutsche Redner (The German Speaker), a guidebook for speeches, was first published in Frankfurt an der Oder in 1660; it appeared in six editions, was edited in 1680 under the title Teutscher Wolredner and appeared in two more editions. In 1664, he wrote the hymn Was frag ich nach der Welt, which Johann Sebastian Bach used as the basis for his chorale cantata Was frag ich nach der Welt, BWV 94, for the ninth Sunday after Trinity of 1724."

  "text" : "Buffalo Bull's Back Fat, or Stu-mick-o-súcks (in the Blackfoot language), was a head war chief of the Blood Indians. He is remembered today for his portrait, painted by George Catlin in 1832, located at the Smithsonian American Art Museum. In one of his letters, Catlin wrote: I have this day been painting a portrait of the head chief of the [Blood tribe] … he is a good-looking and dignified Indian, about fifty years of age, and superbly dressed; whilst sitting for his picture he has been surrounded by his own braves and warriors and also gazed at by his enemies, the Crows and the Knisteneaux, Assinneboins and Ojibbeways; a number of distinguished personages of each of which tribes have laid all day around the sides of my room; reciting to each other the battles they have fought, and pointing to the scalp-locks, worn as proofs of their victories, and attached to the seams of their shirts and leggings.The name of this dignitary of whom I have just spoken is S tu-mick-o-sucks (the buffalo's back fat), i.e., the ‘hump’ or ‘fleece’ the most delicious part of the buffalo's flesh. … The dress … of the chief … consists of a shirt or tunic, made of two deerskins finely dressed, and so placed together with the necks of the skins downwards, and the skins of the hind legs stitched together, the seams running down on each arm, from the neck to the knuckles of the hand; this seam is covered with a band of two inches in width, of very beautiful embroidery of porcupine quills, and suspended from the under edge of this, from the shoulders to the hands, is a fringe of the locks of black hair, which he has taken from the heads of victims slain by his own hand in battle. … In his hand he holds a very beautiful pipe, the stem of which is four or five feet long, and two inches wide, curiously wound with braids of the porcupine quills of various colours; and the bowl of the pipe ingeniously carved by himself from a piece of red steatite of an interesting character, and which they all tell me is procured somewhere between this place and the Falls of St. Anthony, on the head waters of the Mississippi.— George Catlin, Letters and Notes, vol. 1, pp. 29–31 The painting appeared in the exhibit Pictures from the New World at Schloss Charlottenburg, which was held in the Orangerie of Charlottenburg Palace, Berlin, Germany, in 1989."

  "text" : "Bartolomeo Vecchione is an late 18th century Italian architect of the late-Baroque or Rococo period, active in and around Naples. Little is known about his origins and training; he clearly appears influenced by Ferdinando Sanfelice and Luigi Vanvitelli, two contemporary masters of Southern architecture. He was the younger brother of the shipyard engineer, Luca Vecchione. Between 1747-1751, in collaboration with Crescenzo Torchese, he designed the structure of the elaborately decorated and remarkable pharmacy attached to the Ospedale degli Incurabili in central Naples. He aided in the reconstruction of the church of San Francesco delle Monache with the construction of an atrium in stucco and marble preceded by a gate in piperno performed by Torchese. Between 1750 and 1760, he was active in the design and construction the church of the Annunciation in Giugliano in Campania and the main of the church of Giugliano. In 1758, in Naples, he helped complete the church of the Santissima Immacolata Concezione di Maria e San Vincenzo Ferrera (Chiesa dell'Immacolata e San Vincenzo) and a screen house in Via San Vincenzo, on the left of the church. In 1766, he worked on lava formed routes along the Via Foria leading to the Albergo Reale dei Poveri in Naples. He also worked on the facade of the church of the Immaculate Conception (also called the Le Crocelle) at via Chiatamone in Naples. In 1769, he worked with Carlo Zoccoli and Gaetano Barba in studying the collapse of the façade of the Palazzo del Banco and its oratory. He worked in 1769-1770 on the reconstruction of the facade of the church of the Pietà dei Turchini, and in 1771, with Felice Bottiglieri, he was appointed auditor of Archconfraternity of the church of Santissima Trinità dei Pellegrini in Naples."

  "text" : "Barnett \"Barney\" P. Ruditsky (December 25, 1898 – October 18, 1962) was a British-born American police officer and private detective. Ruditsky was born in 1898 in London, England. He arrived in New York City with his family at age 10 and later served in the United States Army during the Pancho Villa Expedition and World War I. Returning to New York, he joined the New York City Police Department (NYPD) in 1921. During his 20-year career on the force Ruditsky was among the NYPD's prominent \"celebrity detectives\" of the 1920s and 1930s. Ruditsky was associated with many criminal cases during this period, most notably, ending with the break up of Murder Incorporated in 1940. Years later, he was called to testify before the Kefauver hearings due to his knowledge of the criminal underworld in Southern California and Las Vegas. Following his retirement from the NYPD in 1941, Ruditsky moved to Los Angeles, California where he became a private investigator and nightclub owner. His later career as a private eye in Hollywood aroused controversy due to his association with gangland figures such as Mickey Cohen and Bugsy Siegel as well as his investigation of film star Marilyn Monroe, the latter resulting in the infamous \"Wrong Door Raid\" in 1954. Ruditsky also served as a technical advisor on a series of crime films for 20th Century Fox in the mid-1940s and eventually became involved in creating The Lawless Years (1959–61), a television series loosely based on his time as a NYPD police detective during Prohibition."

  "text" : "Brent Bennett is a former US Army paratrooper who was convicted by an Afghan court on 15 September 2004 for participating in torture and kidnapping, and for running a private jail in Kabul. Bennett and his associate Jonathan Idema had been operating as independent security contractors in Afghanistan, but had been representing themselves to the American and international media, members of the US military, and Afghan nationals as US government-sponsored covert operatives to track and apprehend Osama Bin Laden and senior Taliban officials. The government has repeatedly denied the validity of their claims. Bennett and Idema, along with journalist Edward Caraballo were arrested by Afghan police on 5 July 2004, during a raid in which they found eight Afghan men (some hanging from their feet) bound and hooded in detention. On 15 September 2004 a three-judge Afghan panel headed by Judge Abdul Baset Bakhtyari sentenced both Idema and Bennett to a ten year prison term, while Caraballo received eight years. Idema and Bennett's sentences were later cut to five and three respectively. Caraballo claimed he was filming Idema and Bennett for a documentary on counterterrorism. Four Afghans working with Idema were sentenced to between one and five years imprisonment. On 30 September 2006, after serving more than two years of his sentence, Bennett was released from prison and flown out Afghanistan. US officials secured Bennett a passport and a ticket out of the country,"

  "text" : "Barry Reynolds, born in Bolton, Lancashire, is a British guitar player, songwriter, composer and producer, best known for his long lasting collaboration with Marianne Faithfull. Reynolds first emerged with the band Pacific Drift which recorded one album that was released in 1970. Reynolds served as guitar player, one of the songwriters and lead vocalist for this short lived quartet from Manchester, England. Feelin' Free the band's only album was released on Deram Nova in 1970. The album was reissued by Grapefruit Records on CD in 2010. Reynolds left the band in 1970. After joining blues band Blodwyn Pig alongside Mick Abrahams of Jethro Tull, Reynolds moved to the US in 1972 then traveled to Mexico before returning to the UK. In 1974, Reynolds released a single, \"Outsiders Point of View\", on RAK Records produced by Alan David. In 1976, Reynolds joined Marianne Faithfull's band, beginning a writing partnership that initially produced songs \"Broken English\" and \"Why Do You Do It?\", which attracted the attention of Island Records' founder Chris Blackwell who then signed Marianne in 1978 and released the album Broken English the following year. Reynolds continued to work as a songwriting collaborator with Faithfull and as guitarist in her band for two more albums Dangerous Acquaintances released in 1981 and A Child's Adventure released in 1983. After a 16-year break Reynolds and Faithfull resumed collaborating on Vagabond Ways in 1999. In 1980, Reynolds joined Sly and Robbie, Wally Badarou, Mikey Chung and Uziah \"Sticky\" Thompson, aka the Compass Point Allstars, a studio band Blackwell created and named after his Compass Point Studios in Nassau, Bahamas to produce albums by Grace Jones, Joe Cocker and Black Uhuru among others. He then released his first solo album I Scare Myself recorded with the Allstars, namely Sly and Robbie, Wally Badarou, Mikey Chung and Uziah \"Sticky\" Thompson with Judy Mowatt and Marcia Griffiths singing backing vocals on two tracks. Also included are the following tracks recorded with Marianne Faithfull: \"Guilt\", \"Broken English\" and \"Times Square\". After moving back to New York, Reynolds has since devoted most of his time to writing, notably with Baaba Maal (Nomad Soul and Television albums), Grace Jones (\"Well Well Well\" on her 2008 Hurricane album), all the while continuing working with Marianne Faithfull. His last collaborations include the 2013 compilation Son of Rogues Gallery: Pirate Ballads, Sea Songs & Chanteys with Beth Orton, Johnny Depp, Lou Reed and Pete Doherty."

  "text" : "Bahirji Naik was an Indian spy, military commander and an efficient soldier, and notable Gaikwad in the army of Shivaji in the time of battle between Maratha Empire and Mughal Empire. His valour and bravery induced the man to perform espionage in enemy camps when the time and conditions were unfriendly and treacherous. Bahirji Naik, Shivaji's Chief of Intelligence, who was so perfect in his methods that history can only infer what he (and his people) did but not how they accomplished their supreme feats.His like tomb is now situated on Banurgad/Bhupalgad in Khanapur taluka of Sangli district. Actual home villege of Bahirji Naik is Shingave Naik Tal Nagar Dist Ahmednagar. In 1692 Bahirji's Son Tukoji Naik Build Ram Mandir and outer border of Shingave Villege. The Historical Stone of His name is avalable in Ram Mandir. At Sajalpur Bahirji's Elephant skodren is avlable called Sajalpur Villege found various lost history. Not much is known about the early life of Bahirji but the his expeditions and adventures as a spy in Shivaji's army tell us of him great contributions in Maratha future. Bahirji was good at gathering detailed information about every aspect of his missions and a lion's share of credit for many of Shivaji's surprising feats must go to Bahirji Naik and his people. Some of the results of their work are listed below. When a knight from Adilshah, Afzalkhan started his journey towards Maratha Empire with a promise to Adilshah to kill or capture Shivaji, his war elephant named Fatel Lashkar was killed on the first day of his march. It is suspected that the elephant was poisoned by Bahirji and his men, in order to demoralize the advancing army. Death of the flag bearing elephant was considered as a bad omen by Afzalkhan, and the act of Bahirji was successful in it. Bahirji further helped Shivaji in mounting many covert operations and acts of sabotage in enemy territory. Shivaji and his officers specialized in capturing the enemy forts via surprise attacks followed by quick victories. This was the strategy underlying Shivaji's guerrilla warfare, a rare practice in those days. Having precise military information was crucial to the success of this strategy. The battles were usually over within hours rather than months needed to capture a fort via open siege. In Umbar Khind, a mountain pass near Lonavala, Shivaji ambushed and defeated the 20,000 strong army of Colonel Kartalab Khan, a well-known military officer of Shahistakhan, in a 2-hour battle. Shivaji captured valuable military equipment and accepted the deserters from Khan's army into his own. Shivaji paid a surprise visit to Shahistakhan in Khan's military camp at Pune with at least 70,000 soldiers under cover of darkness. The objective was to kill Khan and thus demoralize his army. Khan survived this daring attack by Shivaji minus three fingers! Shivaji then escaped to Sinhagad while enticing Khan's army on a wild chase to a mountain pass in Katraj. Khan did not die but was thoroughly de-moralized. He had occupied Pune and terrorized the surrounding population for over 3 years. Within 3 days of Shivaji's visit, Khan left Pune! Twice, Shivaji successfully attacked Surat, Aurangzeb's financial capital and carried away much of its wealth as repatriation of the expenses incurred and pain suffered by Shivaji's citizens during years of occupations by forces of Aurangzeb's army first under Shahistakhan and then under Mirza Raje Jaisingh.On each occasion, Shivaji did not harm those who had engaged in significant acts of charity. Shivaji escaped from Aurangzeb's jail in Agra, a city that was totally foreign to Shivaji even though the jail itself was surrounded by 1,000 strong army under an able commander, and Shivaji had to travel 700 miles through Aurangzeb's kingdom. After the second expedition to Surat, Colonel Ikhlas Khan was chasing Shivaji's army. When Khan reached Kanchan Bari (near Nasik), he found that Shivaji was ready to face Khan in an open battle! Khan had lost the advantage of surprise. Shivaji captured valuable military equipment after his victory in this 6 hour battle. In short, Bahirji Naik was a key component of Shivaji's many surprise victories and escapes."

In 1834 he received a complaint from the detachment at San Miguel del Bado that they were not able to support themselves or their families.In 1834 he decided to commit his troops to supporting the centralist Plan of Cuernavaca, and received an effusive letter from José Antonio Laureano de Zubiría, Bishop of Durango,praising his decision. Hinojos led a slaving expedition into Navajo country between 13 October and 17 November 1834, killing sixteen warriors but taking only three captives.On 8 February 1835 Hinojos left Santa Fé on a second slaving expedition with a force of almost 1,000 armed men.Narbona heard news of the invasion and collected 250 of the best warriors,who made for the 8,000 feet (2,400 m) high Beesh Lichii'l Bigiizh, or Copper Pass, in the Chuska Mountains on the route that the Mexicans were sure to take.The Mexican force, although large, was composed of poorly disciplined and inexperienced men who took no precautions.On 28 February 1835 they straggled into Copper Pass. Narbona held back his forces, who hiding on both sides of the pass. He told them that when the time was right and not before they would cut the long file of men into small pieces, like cutting a long tree trunk into firewood.When the signal was given, the Navajos poured arrows into the column, those who had guns fired, and some threw stones or rolled rocks into the gorge. Taken completely by surprise, both men and horses panicked and were routed. Hinojos and most of his force died.The survivors made their way beck to Santa Fe, returning on 13 March 1835.Hinojos was succeeded by Albino Pérez.The pass was later renamed Washington Pass, after Colonel John M. Washington, who killed Narbona in 1849. Today it is called Narbona Pass."

  "text" : "Boris Braun (20 August 1920, Đurđevac) is a Croatian University professor, Holocaust survivor and member of the Jewish community in Zagreb. Braun was born to Šandor and Elizabeta (née Mautner) Braun, members of a notable and wealthy Jewish family of Đurđevac. He had a sister called Štefica. The Braun family were reputable and respected in Đurđevac, where they owned the sawmill, vineyard, mill and ice factory. His father brought electricity to the Đurđevac region and maintained the local substation. Braun's father was a close friend of Ivan Šubašić and Mate Starčević, mayor of Zagreb, both of whom participated in the hunting events organized every year at the Braun estate. Before the World War II he studied agriculture at the University of Zagreb. In 1941, with the establishment of the Independent State of Croatia, Braun was banned from the University of Zagreb for being Jewish. He returned to Đurđevac where he helped his father run the family business. Braun also helped maintain the substation and learned from his father's employees about electricity, knowledge that would later save his life. In the autumn of 1942, although his father was an acquaintance of the Independent State of Croatia military commander Slavko Kvaternik, Braun and his parents were arrested and transported to Zagreb, to the prison at Savska Cesta. Only Braun's sister managed to avoid the arrest because she was married to a Catholic from Zagreb. Eight months later in 1943, with a large group of Jews from Zagreb, Braun and his parents were deported in the cattle wagons to Auschwitz. His parents were killed in the gas chambers upon arrival, but Braun saved himself when he lied that he was an electrician. In Auschwitz, with others, Braun repaired and maintained the gas chambers. Some time later Braun volunteered to be transferred to the Central Labour Camp Jaworzno, as the Nazis looked for volunteers to establish the new camp. At Jaworzno, Braun maintained the SS and prisoner barracks. On 17 January 1945 Braun was marched away westward with other prisoners. Hundreds died on the way to the Gross-Rosen concentration camp in Lower Silesia, including about 300 shot dead in a massacre which occurred on the second night of this death march. From Gross-Rosen concentration camp, Braun was transported to Buchenwald concentration camp. There he welcomed liberation and the end of World War II. In the summer of 1945, Braun returned to the University of Zagreb, where he finished his studies at the Faculty of Agriculture. He worked as a professor at the university until 1971, that year he rebelled against the decision of the other university professors to expel a colleague who had participated in the Croatian Spring. Later he has worked as an poultry inspector. Braun is very active in witnessing the horrors of Holocaust to elementary and primary school children across Zagreb. In 2005, Braun was named an Honorary Citizen of Đurđevac."

Allen grew up in Corsicana, Texas, and attended the University of Texas. A local sports legend, in 1924 he caught the winning touchdown pass against Texas A&M University when a bobbled ball was tipped into his hands, leading the Longhorns to 7-0 victory against the Aggies in the brand new Memorial Stadium. In college, Allen also played baseball and the St. Louis Cardinals offered him a pitching tryout. He left Texas to study at the Art Institute of Chicago. Allen moved around the southern oil fields for a while and ended up working for Standard Oil looking for swamp gas. When that job ended he was set to work on a pipeline in Natchez, Mississippi, and was ready to take a job in Venezuela, when he was offered a position drawing sports cartoons for the Associated Press. In 1940, Allen invested in a mica mine 90 miles north of Santa Fe, New Mexico, with the 1920s New York band leader, Smith Ballew."

  "text" : "On 22 June 1942, the Albanian student trio of Branko Kadija, Jordan Misja and Perlat Rexhepi, who stayed in Misja's house at Firaj Street in Shkodër (at the time part of the fascist Italian protectorate of the Albanian Kingdom), were for several hours surrounded by Albanian quisling (fascist) forces and police, numbering some 600 people. The three young friends were members of the Communist Party of Albania, which was established on 8 November 1941 and had begun with smaller detachments of 5-10 people which engaged in various acts of sabotage to the Italian forces, including antifascist propaganda in order to gain support of the masses. After an air bombardment, they rushed out of the house and managed to kill many of the quisling soldiers, but were shot down and instantly killed. The three were proclaimed People's Heroes of Albania for their act, and they are collectively known as the Three Heroes of Shkodër (Albanian: Tre heronjtë e Shkodrës). Jordan Misja was a painter. Kadija and Misja belonged to the Orthodox community of Shkodër, which at that time there were a few families, which all belonged to the same social level. According to Serbian sources, both Misja and Kadija were ethnic Serbs (see Serbs in Albania), and their surnames were originally Mišović (Мишовић) and Kadić (Кадић). Jordan Misja, a nephew of the hero bearing the same name, has rejected the latter claim and said that an ancestor had come from the suburbs of Elbasan, and the surname Misja has not changed its form while being spread throughout the Elbasan region. Perlat Rexhepi was an ethnic Albanian, originally from Vlorë."

  "text" : "Bernard Diederich (born 1926), is a New Zealand-born author, journalist, and historian. Diederich studied in England in the early postwar years after having participated in World War II in the Pacific. In 1949, Diederich started a sailing trip with two friends that brought him to Haiti, a country that since stayed close to his heart. He stayed and settled down, while his partners continued their trip. In Port-au-Prince, he founded and edited the Haiti Sun, a weekly English newspaper about Haitian events. As a journalist he also became a non-staff correspondent for a number of news media including the Associated Press, the New York Times, and the Daily Telegraph. In 1961 he covered the assassination of Rafael Trujillo in the neighboring Dominican Republic. Two years later, after having displeased Haiti’s dictator Papa Doc Duvalier, he was imprisoned and expelled. In the Dominican Republic he established himself as a foreign staff correspondent for Time-Life News. In 1966 Diederich moved to Mexico working for Time Magazine covering Caribbean affairs. In 1981 the office was moved to Miami, and he worked there until his retirement in 1989. The author continued to publish after retirement with the focus on the political and historical developments in the Caribbean, notably in Haiti. In 1954 Diederich met Graham Greene and the two became friends; later, as a result of their travel along the Haitian border Diederich wrote The Seeds of Fiction: Graham Greene's Adventures in Haiti and Central America 1954–1983, while Greene published The Comedians. Diederich published a detailed account of Trujillo’s assassination in Trujillo: Death of the Goat in 1978. After Mario Vargas Llosa published The Feast of the Goat, a fictionalized novel about Trujillo’s death, in 2000, Diederich accused Vargas Llosa of plagiarism."

In May 2012 Abu Shoka questioned the secretive judicial decision to lift a travel ban on foreign NGO workers accused of raising US funds without appropriate government authorization. In mid-June 2012, he was named as a member of the revamped Constituent Assembly of Egypt.

He wrote the book Du Chakay Duniya about his experiences. The world voyage started on bicycle from Town Hall, Calcutta on December 12, 1926 and halted at Chandannagar for the first night. He and his three friends had crossed the Bohemian Alps in bicycles wearing flannel shirts and no woolen clothing in the month of December. They had kept warm by cycling vigorously and alternated keeping one hand in their pockets to prevent frostbite. When asked how they did the amazing feat. He had replied, \"We are carrying the sun rays from India!\"."

  "text" : "Bob Lambert (c. 1957 – September 7, 2012) was an American media executive with The Walt Disney Company for more than twenty-five years. Lambert is widely credited with championing the transition to computer animation (CGI) within Disney and the larger entertainment industry. Lambert was born and raised in Roanoke, Virginia. He received his bachelor's degree from Virginia Tech. Lambert, who was with Walt Disney Feature Animation at the time, developed the plan to transition Disney animated film production from hand-drawn, cel animation with CGI. Along with leaders at Pixar, Lambert spearheaded the development of Disney's Computer Animation Production System (CAPS), which earned an Academy Award for Technical Achievement in 1992. In addition to his work with Disney, Lambert founded and chaired Digital Cinema Initiatives (DCI), a consortium encompassing six major film studios. Under Lambert, DCI aided movie theaters' transition to digital exhibition, including digital cinema. DCI established industry quality guidelines for theaters for digital content and film projection. Lambert held more than thirty patents in media technologies. He was honored as a digital industry pioneer by ShoWest, which is now known as CinemaCon. In 2013, USC Entertainment Technology Center established the annual Bob Lambert Technology Leadership Award, and Chuck Dages (former executive vice president of emerging technologies at Warner Bros.) was the first recipient. Bob Lambert died at his home in Glendale, California, on September 7, 2012, at the age of 55. He was survived by his wife, Cheryl Murphy; his brother Paul Lambert; and nephew Nathaniel Lambert."

  "text" : "Bill Graham (1951 – 11 May 1996) was an Irish journalist and author. He attended Trinity College, Dublin and resided in Howth. In addition to authoring several books, Graham wrote for Hot Press magazine from its founding. He died of a heart attack at forty-four on 11 May 1996 being survived by his mother Eileen. Graham's long time colleague and Hot Press editor Niall Stokes described him: \"In many ways, he was a founding father of modern Irish music. He inspired a whole generation of Irish fans and musicians to look at the world in a different and broader light. And he was good on more than music too. He felt a kinship with Northern Ireland and the people on both sides of the sectarian and political divide there that was unusual in those who were brought up within the narrow confines of the culture of Ireland in the ‘60s and ‘70s – and his political writing reflected this. And he was also ahead of the game in terms of his appreciation of the importance of the politics of food and the position of the developing world in the new era.\" Graham was instrumental in the formation of Irish rock band U2, having brought them to the attention of their manager Paul McGuinness. At a recent exhibition of early group photos, McGuinness remembered the role Bill Graham played by introducing him to the band. Despite being widely known as the man who \"discovered\" U2, it was a title he disavowed. He wrote enthusiastically about the band, giving them their first exposure. Both guitarist The Edge and Bono have explained Graham's role in the band's development. John Waters observed that \"It is often said that Bill 'discovered' U2. This is untrue. Bill created U2, through his enthusiasm for them. He gave them a reflection of their own possibilities and they only looked back that once\"...He had a \"deep knowledge of virtually every form of popular and roots music... and Waters goes on to credit him as 'the first Irish writer to write about the connection between Irish political culture and Irish rock'n'roll'."

  "text" : "Bernard Molitor (22 October 1755 – 17 November 1833) was a Luxembourgish cabinet-maker. Molitor grew up in Betzdorf, Luxembourg as the son of a miller and went to Paris in 1777, where one of his cousins already worked as a cabinet-maker. During his first years in Paris, he made a living as a merchant: in 1778, he advertised insecticides, and six years later he sold handwarmers shaped like books. After marrying the daughter of a charpentier du roi (carpenter of the king) in 1787, he became maître ébéniste (master Ébéniste) and member of the guild of cabinet-makers. He opened a workshop in the Rue de Bourbon (today Rue de Lille). One of his first orders came from Marie Antoinette, who ordered the floor paneling from mahogany wood for her boudoir in Fontainebleau from him. Just as Molitor had begun making a name for himself among the French nobility, the French Revolution broke out, and Molitor had to close his business as most of his clients had to flee or were killed. Later, Molitor was able to reopen his business and employ several artisans who helped him create a variety of furniture, including dressers, tables, desks and cupboards. Molitor's furniture was often veneered with precious woods and decorated with applications of gilded bronze. Napoleon Bonaparte ordered several pieces of furniture for his residence in Saint-Cloud from him. In 1811, Molitor became fournisseur de la Cour impériale (purveyor to the imperial court). In 1800, Bernard Molitor bought a house on the elegant Rue du Faubourg Saint-Honoré. In 1815, he married a second time, and in 1820 he moved to Fontainebleau where he died in 1833 at the age of 78 years. He is buried in the Fontainebleau cemetery. In 1995, while Luxembourg was the European Capital of Culture, a retrospective brought broad public attention to Molitor's work for the first time. Today, collectors pay large sums for original Molitor furniture. Three pieces by Molitor are in the Royal Collection of the British Royal Family."

His residences included a lavish family home in Glenageary, an apartment on Dalkey’s Vico Road and a golfing villa in Barbados. He drove an Aston Martin DB7 and had close on 100 bank accounts. After admitting in 2008 to his investors—many of whom were close friends—that he had taken millions of Euros of their money to fund a lavish lifestyle and could not pay it back, he was investigated by the Garda Síochána Fraud Squad. He has since been bailed out by his mother and is on trial over his part in an investment fraud. He pleaded guilty to a sample of charges brought against him involving sums totalling more than ten million euros. On October 8, 2014, O'Brien was sentenced to a seven-year term of imprisonment. O'Brien appealed the sentence; the Court of Appeal denied the appeal in December of 2015. In July 2016, the High Court adjudicated O'Brien as bankrupt. His family home is Carrigrohane Castle in Cork, Ireland. His father Leo was a businessman and his younger brother is RTÉ rugby commentator Daire O'Brien. Married to Fiona Nagle, he was renowned for hosting lavish parties at his home."

Fowler was a transient construction worker who is known to have traveled extensively across North America. He spent time \"rabbiting around\" North America to such places as British Columbia, Florida, Iowa, Louisiana, Texas, Oregon, South Carolina, Arizona, Tennessee and Washington State. During his travels he developed an extensive criminal record and is known to have committed several violent crimes. An alcohol, amphetamine, and methamphetamine abuser, Fowler had a criminal record that included attempted murder, sexual assault, and firearms offenses. In 1969, he was charged with murdering a man and woman in Texas, but was only convicted of discharging a firearm within city limits. Fowler also spent time in a Tennessee prison for sexual assault and attempted murder because, in the words of an investigator, \"he tied [a woman] up, beat the hell out of her with her own belt, covered her with brush and left her to die.\" He liked to travel far and wide in beat-up old cars, frequently picked up hitchhikers, and spent time in bars and motels. Fowler believed that women he came into contact with who were hitchhiking and hanging out in bars wanted to be sexually assaulted."

  "text" : "Frederick Benjamin \"Ben\" Carlin (27 July 1912 – 7 March 1981) was an Australian adventurer who was the first and only person to circumnavigate the world in an amphibious vehicle. Born in Northam, Western Australia, Carlin attended Guildford Grammar School in Perth, and later studied mining engineering at the Kalgoorlie School of Mines. After qualifying as an engineer, he worked on the Goldfields before in 1939 emigrating to China to work in a British coal mine. In the Second World War, Carlin was posted to the Indian Army Corps of Engineers, serving in India, Italy, and throughout the Middle East. After his discharge from service in 1946, he emigrated to the United States with his American wife, Elinore (née Arone). Sparked by an idea he had had whilst in the military, Carlin proposed that the couple honeymoon by crossing the Atlantic Ocean in a modified Ford GPA (an amphibious version of the Ford GPW Jeep), which they named the Half-Safe. Beginning their trip in Montreal, Canada, the Carlins finally completed the transatlantic crossing in 1951, after unsuccessful attempts. From there, they travelled to Europe, temporarily settling in Birmingham to raise more money. They resumed their journey in 1954, travelling overland through the Middle East before arriving in Calcutta. After a short fundraising trip to Australia, Carlin's wife left to return to the United States. He resumed the journey with new partners, travelling through South-East Asia and the Far East to the northern tip of Japan, and then to Alaska. After an extended tour through the United States and Canada, he and Half-Safe finally returned to Montreal, having travelled over 17,000 kilometres (11,000 mi) by sea and 62,000 kilometres (39,000 mi) by land during a ten-year journey. Following Carlin's death in 1981, Half-Safe was acquired by Guildford Grammar, his old school, where it remains on display."

  "text" : "Bernard Bernstein (30 November 1908 – 6 February 1990) was an American economist and public official. As a U.S. Army colonel, he served as a financial adviser to General Eisenhower in World War II, and after the war was on the Control Commission for Germany, but was removed when the Morgenthau Plan, with which he was associated, was not adopted. Additionally, he held multiple offices concurrently. From 1933 until 1948, he was an Attorney for the U.S. Treasury Department. From 1942 through 1943, he was a Financial Adviser, North African Economic Control Board. From 1944 through 1945, he was Director, Finance Division and Director of the Division of Investigation of Cartels and External Assets, U.S. Group Control Commission for Germany. From 1942 through 1945, he acted as Financial Adviser to Gen. Eisenhower for Civil Affairs and Military Government, European Theater of Operations and MTO. In 1945 he was in charge of producing a paper that documented the culpability of I.G. Farben for its part in the Holocaust and German militarism. He so testified before the U.S. Congress. After returning to civilian life, he served as a legal counsel to the American Jewish Conference. On February 6, 1990, at New York Hospital he died of cardiac arrest. He was survived by his wife, Bernice Bernstein née Lotwin and three children. His accumulated papers date from 1933 to 1955 in bulk. They include documents from 1863 to 1993. The collection — 10.8 linear feet in 27 boxes amounting to 22,500 pages — is deposited in the Harry S. Truman Presidential Library. In the main, they document Bernstein's army officer work investigating “the economic resources of the Third Reich (its looted gold and other assets, as well as the activities of German cartels), and in formulating financial policies for Germany and other areas of Europe under Allied occupation.”"

The Nile river has various sources, Waldecker found the White Nile's most southern source which is part of the Kagera River, the other being Lake Kyoga in Uganda further north. The small pipe flowing with the first Nile water appears from the ground below the summit of Mount Kikizi where the pyramid is found. The explorer missionary David Livingstone tried for many years to find the source of the Nile without success."

  "text" : "Bladimir Antuna was married with two children. Antuna started his journalism career before 1990. Before he joined El Tiempo De Durango newspaper, he had been a journalist at other newspapers and also had worked in radio. Antuna was a crime reporter and editor of the crime section at El Tiempo De Durango for the last three years. While working there, he collaborated with fellow journalist Eliseo Barrón Hernández, who was a journalist with La Opinión de Torreón in Torreón, Mexico. Both investigated police corruption in Durango. Antuna received three threats before he was killed, according to his editor. While working on this investigation, Antuna received death threats and some of those death threats were coming from members of the Los Zetas crime group. On 28 April 2009, a gunman had opened fire at Antuna as he was leaving his home but escaped uninjured from the incident. Later, Antuna received an anonymous call that said, \"We've found your home. It's over for you now.\" After the attack, Antuna went to the authorities to report the attack. Afterwards he was assigned a body guard, but the attorney general had also made a note in his file that he was \"paranoid.\" His friends said he was aware of the danger and had confided in them saying he was not afraid of dying.Carlos Ortega Samper, who also worked at El Tiempo De Durango, was killed 3 May 2009. On 27 May 2009, the same day Eliseo Barrón was beaten and killed, Antuna was threatened again. Antuna was investigating both Barrón's and Samper's murder at the time he was killed."

  "text" : "Hesling was from a Yorkshire family. He was born in 1905 while the family was temporarily in Wales. They returned to Yorkshire in 1907. He left school at age 15 and was apprenticed to a firm of painters and decorators. He studied art at Halifax night-school, where his teacher was the artist Joseph Mellor Hanson (1900-1963). At age 21 he went to London to try his hand at acting. In 1960 Hesling reminisced about his 1926 debut as an actor and assistant Stage Manager at London’s Gate Theatre. To augment his meager wages Hesling painted in his spare time and displayed his earthenware jugs and bowls in the theatre’s foyer. Norman Haire bought one and introduced himself. After the show they went to the Cafe Royal and Hesling was horrified because the 34-year-old Haire, ‘famous in Europe as he never was in his native land’, envied him, a 21-year-old, for being an actor. The stage manager worried that ‘a young innocent from the provinces’ had gone off with Haire ‘a professed homosexual’ but joked: ‘watch out for him, he’s a good bloke but never ask his advice about sex or he’ll send you a bill.’ In 1928, out of work in London and promised a job in Sydney, he migrated to Australia (for £16) and worked on Sydney shop-window displays at £6 a week. He had a room at Burdekin House, home to artists and writers. In 1929 he exhibited his abstract paintings but sold only three. He did not paint again seriously until 1943, when he became a part-time cartoonist. He was attracted to Sydney because of the prospect of a job and because his oldest brother, Charles, a gas engineer turner, migrated there in 1912. Charles died in a car accident at Lane Cove in 1931, aged 39, leaving a widow and young child. Out of work again at the start of the Great Depression he went back to London, where he worked first as a display artist at 9p an hour. In 1933 he married Flo’ (Florence Pickles) and became an art director at Elstree film studios, London, where he worked for three or four years. He returned to Sydney with Flo’ in 1939 with £50. They and other fit passengers served as U-boat spotters on the long voyage. For a short time he worked on accounts at Australia Paper Mills in Sydney. In 1929 he became friendly with new residents at Sydney’s 'bush suburb’ Castlecrag and came to know its designer Walter Burley Griffin and his wife Marion Mahony Griffin. He described Griffin as \"a small, plump atom bomb of a man in a broad-brimmed beaver hat, wearing a flowing Left Bank artist tie like an Americian in Paris\". On returning to Sydney in 1939 Hesling resumed his interest in Castlecrag, where he and Flo’ settled in 1942."

  "text" : "Prince Dmitry Mikhailovich Bobrok (\"Little Beaver\") was a general, boyar and brother-in-law of Dmitry I of Moscow. His military prowess is glorified in the 15th-century Tale of the Rout of Mamai. Bobrok's parentage is the subject of a long-running dispute. Most sources call him a Volhynian princeling. He could have been a junior member of the Rurikid House of Ostrog or a grandson of Gediminas of Lithuania, probably one of Karijotas's sons. It has also been speculated that he held the village of Bobrka on the Boberka River as a fief from Liubartas. Bobrok was one of the first Lithuanian princes to enter the Muscovite service. He led the Muscovite army against Oleg II of Ryazan in 1371 and successfully raided Volga Bulgaria in 1376. He was in charge of the conquest of Severia in 1379 and was in command of a regiment lying in ambush during the great Battle of Kulikovo in 1380. Bobrok is not mentioned in any sources after 1389. Valentin Yanin has speculated that he took the tonsure after his son had been killed by a fall from a horse. The Bobrenev Monastery in Kolomna claims Bobrok as its founder. Yanin has argued that St. Michael of Klopsk was his son or grandson. The Volynsky boyar family also claims patrilineal descent from Bobrok."

He played for a local team, Friends XI, before progressing to the Central Railways club and then, in 1966, to Mafatlal SC. He played for the Indian junior team in 1964 and spent nearly 20 years as goalkeeper with Tata Sports Club from 1970, where he replaced S. S. Narayan. He occasionally played as a right-back and retired from the sport in 1989. Having suffered paralysis of his right-hand side two years previously, Kakade died of a heart attack in Mumbai on 17 October 2012. He was unmarried."

The second part of Hespaña Libertada was published in 1673 by her daughter, Maria Clara de Meneses. Bernarda Ferreira de la Cerda is also recorded as entering poems in two poetic jousts: Montalban 1636, folios 42, 46, and 137, and Grande de Tena, folio 134v.

Early the following year, she toured South Australia and Western Australia, winning every race she entered. From there, Kerr went to England, giving swimming exhibitions in Bradford, Liverpool, London, and Manchester, being billed as \"Australia's Champion Lady Swimmer and Diver\". She returned to Australia in October 1911, living the rest of her life in Sydney, New South Wales. Although often compared to Annette Kellerman, another Australian swimmer, Kerr's repeated challenges to Kellerman to race went unanswered."

He commuted to Cleveland where he was the leading radio personality for some years. Tim Conway and other well-known persons visited their home. Big Wilson served as the announcer for the weekly television program, Jack Horkheimer: Star Hustler. During the program's opening sequence, Wilson's voice was the one which was heard reading the following poem: After Big Wilson's death in 1989, Star Hustler continued to use Wilson's pre-recorded voice in the television program's introduction as a \"living memorial\" to the man. This ended in 1997 when the show was renamed Jack Horkheimer: Star Gazer."

Thomas Lake was the son of Captain Thomas Lake, a wealthy Bostonian who was the younger half-brother of Sir Edward Lake, 1st Baronet. Captain Lake bought Arrowsic, Maine, in 1660, and was killed aged 61 in a fight with Native Americans at Kennebec on 14 August 1676. He was buried in Copp's Hill Burying Ground, Boston. Sir Edward died without issue aged 77 on 18 April 1674, and his estate subsequently devolved to Thomas Lake, the son of Captain Lake. Bibye or Bibby Lake was baptised on 10 April 1684 at Bishop Norton, Lincolnshire. Bibye was the surname of Sir Edward Lake's wife, who had died more than 14 years before. He became a Bencher of the Middle Temple, London, and was Sub-Governor of the African Company. Shortly after his father's death, he made representations that his great-uncle had received a warrant from King Charles I, dated 30 December 1643, for a baronetcy with a remainder to his heirs male. The warrant had not received the Great Seal of the Realm and so was not valid, but if it had been, the baronetcy would have devolved on Bibye. A new warrant, this time sealed, was drawn up and Bibye Lake became the first baronet of a new Lake line on 17 October 1711. He married in or before 1713 Mary Atwell, daughter and heir of William Atwell of London. He was buried on 6 April 1744, in the Temple Church, aged 60, where his widow was also later buried on 23 January 1752. In or after April 1760, their bodies were re-interred at Edmonton, London, in the same vault as their eldest son, Sir Atwell Lake, 2nd Baronet."

The main line of the Duke of Zhou's descendants came from Bo Qin's third son Yu (魚) whose descendants adopted the surname Dongye (東野). The Duke of Zhou's offspring held the title of Wujing Boshi (五经博士; 五經博士; Wǔjīng Bóshì). Duke Huan of Lu's son through Qingfu (慶父) was the ancestor of Mencius. He was descended from Duke Yang of the State of Lu 魯煬公 Duke Yang was the son of Bo Qin. The genealogy is found in the Mencius family tree (孟子世家大宗世系)."

During the London 2012 Olympic Games, Callaghan tweeted that in one of his tours over that period he had lambasted his audience to \"get a move on as there were athletes two miles down the road with no legs moving faster\". The YouTube video, shows Callaghan asking elderly people on his tour to hurry up because they might not have long left to live. To roars of laughter, he says: \"I don't care if you are limping. Catch up. Old people! It is an amazing fact that the elderly just do not realise how little time they may have left.\" Moving onto the subject of Traitors' Gate, he jokes, \"Mel Gibson should have been brought through these gates and given a really hefty slap over the colossally inaccurate comedy film Braveheart.\" Callaghan also tells a group of tourists, \"History is nearly always written by the people who win. This explains all the empty pages in the French history books.\""

  "text" : "Bertold Eisner (1875 - 1956) was a Croatian Jewish law professor at the University of Zagreb, pioneer of the Croatian Jurisprudence and writer. Eisner was born in Korolówka, Galicia in 1875. In Černovice, Czech Republic, he finished high school and graduated from the Faculty of Law. In 1899, Eisner received his doctoral degree in law. After his education he moved to Vienna, where he worked as a court clerk. In the mid 1900, due to financial difficulties, Eisner moved to Bosnia and Herzegovina, where he worked at the Travnik, Jajce, Prijedor and Ključ courts of law. In 1933, Eisner was elected as a regular professor at University of Zagreb, Faculty of Law. He taught Roman and international private law. During World War II, Independent State of Croatia officials excluded Eisner from the inflicted measures against the Jews, thus excluding him from wearing the star of David Yellow badge. In January 1943, he was retired in the latest retirement wave of Jewish professors. After the war, Eisner was returned to his position at the University of Zagreb. He retired in 1955, but stayed working as a part-time professor. Eisner scientific work was essential for the diversity of matter he had worked on. He had published many articles, debates, book ratings and displays. His area of expertise was primarily a civil right, but he was also involved with family law, international private law, commercial law, copyright law, and Roman law. Eisner published a total of 60 scientific works. His life's work was book \"Private International Law\", published in 1953 and 1956. He had the significant contribution to the legislative work. From 1924 to 1933, Eisner actively participated in the drafting of a new laws. All the major legislative drafts of that time (especially those in the field of civil law) passed his control and in large part are the result of his work. After the war he worked as a member of the committees in charge with the production of a series of important legislative proposals. Eisner participated in many international conferences about law. As an accomplished scientist, Eisner enjoyed the undivided respect of his colleagues, admirers and students. He was a selfless benefactor, as he left all his possessions and property to the poor students foundation. Dr. Eisner was buried at the Mirogoj Cemetery."

  "text" : "Bjarne Ugland (born 1946) is a Norwegian politician for the Labour Party. Hailing from Vågsbygd, he was originally a member of the Liberal Party, but shifted to the Labour Party in the 1980s. He entered Kristiansand city council after the 1999 local elections, became leader of Labour's party group and served the next term 2003–2007 as deputy mayor. He was described as a typical municipal politician, forging pragmatic cross-party alliances to further the city's progress. Ugland thus became a central figure behind the scenes in the workings of Norway's sixth largest municipality. In 2003, after Ugland had propped up Jan Oddvar Skisland to become mayor, he was noted nationwide as a proponent of closer relations between Labour and the Christian Democratic Party. Also, together with Conservative group leader in the city, Tore Austad and chief administrative officer Erling Valvik, Ugland was also a central architect behind Kristiansand municipality's 2000 sale of the power company Agder Energi, and subsequent establishment of the cultural foundation Cultiva. Ugland remained member of the working committee and strategy committee of Agder Energi. After retiring from politics, Ugland served as chair and deputy chair of Kristiansand Næringsselskap, board member of the Kilden Performing Arts Centre and project leader in a local Tall Ships' Races event. He has also been a board member of the recycling company Returkraft."

Despite being a powerful conservative politician in the Taisho and Showa eras, Miki remarkably never held any cabinet post. He still has a high reputation as the archetype of a behind-the-scenes power broker, and at the zenith of their power there were times when both Kanemaru Shin and Hiromu Nonaka were openly complimented by Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone for having \"surpassed Bukichi Miki\". Miki's nicknames included \"the heckling general\", \"the wily schemer\", and \"the great tanuki of Japanese politics\"."

  "text" : "Bob Becker (born June 22, 1947) is an American percussionist and composer known primarily as a founding member of the Nexus percussion ensemble, as well as a performer in the Steve Reich and Musicians ensemble. He primarily performs as a keyboard percussionist, but is also skilled in tabla and concert snare drumming. As a composer, Becker employs a multicultural approach by mixing the style of western military drumming with North Indian Hindustani idioms, such as raga scale patterns and tabla drumming. This fusion of compositional practices is the main focus of works like Lahara and Mudra. There are also traces of influence from the music of minimalists like Steve Reich, which can be attributed to Becker's experience with that composer's music."
