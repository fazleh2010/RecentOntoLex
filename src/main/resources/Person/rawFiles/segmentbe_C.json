  "text" : "Carl Heinrich \"Charles Henry\" Wilcken (October 5, 1831 – April 9, 1915) was a German-American artilleryman who was awarded the Iron Cross by the King of Prussia, Frederick William IV. On arrival in the United States in 1857, lacking English and possessing military skills and discipline, he signed on with what came to be known as Johnston's Army, a part of the United States Army sent to put down the so-called \"Mormon Rebellion\" (also known as the Utah War). He got permission to hunt for game to supplement the military rations. On one such trip he met some Mormons and decided to desert to join them. Later, to cover his defection, it was claimed that he had been captured by the Utah Territorial militia (the \"Nauvoo Legion\") at Fort Bridger. Wilcken later joined The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), and served as water commissioner directing irrigation, as a municipal policeman, and as superintendent of the Deseret Telegraph Company. Wilcken's granddaughter Anna Amelia Pratt was the mother of American politician George W. (George Wilcken) Romney."

He was a colorful cultural personality and one of the central Finnish national awakeners and - later - one of the leading dissidents at the same time. Gottlund pursued the creation on an autonomous Finnish territory from the Finn Forests on both sides of the Swedish-Norwegian border, with great economic and political independence. Gottlund is commonly attributed with saving the folklore of the Forest Finns. Among ideas promoted by Gottlund was the view that all languages are interconnected by the same roots."

  "text" : "Conrad Friberg (1896-1989) was an American filmmaker, labor organizer and wallpaper hanger in Chicago, IL. Many of his films are credited to \"C.O. Nelson\". His best known work is Halsted Street which he produced when a member and lead organizer in the Chicago Workers' Film & Photo League. Portions of Halsted Street were re-used in Halsted Street, USA (1994) on YouTube. Friberg was born in 1896 in Chicago, Illinois to John Friberg and Anna Marie Nelson, both immigrants from Sweden. He attended the Copernicus School in Chicago until the 8th grade, leaving school before attending high school. During World War I, Friberg began using his mother’s maiden name and moved from Chicago to New Orleans to avoid the draft. He became known as “Con” or C.O. Nelson. After operating a street car in New Orleans, he worked his way west to California, where he worked at a logging camp in Feather River Canyon, visited Mount Lassen, and traveled on a mail stage coach, photographing with a “post card” camera along the way. Friberg's brother, musician James Friberg, was interviewed before the Special Committee on Victor L. Berger Investigation in 1919 regarding his activities in the Young People's Socialist League and interactions with William F. Kruse. In these hearings, it was also mentioned that Conrad Friberg had run the Young Socialist camp Yipsel at Fox Lake the previous year. After the war, Friberg continued to use the name C.O. Nelson for his political film and photography work, as well as some articles in leftist publications. In the 1920s, he worked for the Federated Press, providing photographs for labor publications. Friberg was associated with labor organizing through his work as president of the Chicago office workers union. In the late 1930s, he worked for an insurance company in Chicago. His wife, Mildred worked at the Vilnus Lithuanian Daily paper for many years. He had one son, Carl."

Other sources show him as a manipulator and predator upon women and a fraud. Several details about his life are uncertain, both his nobility and military service were questioned by other Polish refugees in his lifetime. He was involved in several cases involving assaults on women including sexual assaults, and was involved in cases against himself relating to fraud or attempted fraud: he was put in debtors' prison in 1837, and in 1844 was found bankrupt during a case in which he was brought to court for attempting to defraud a woman of her inheritance. He was also involved in a failed invention for an engine powered by gun-cotton. In 1850, after a case of assault on his adopted daughter was found to be true he moved from London, to Southampton, then Hull; renamed himself Dr. Beck, he moved to Hull in around 1855, and died in 1856, in abject poverty, of heart and lung problems, and starvation. A tombstone was erected on his behalf in 1857 in the Hull General Cemetery, inscribed as the Count de Werdinsky."

  "text" : "Claus or Claux de Werve (c. 1380–1439) was a sculptor active at the Burgundian court under Philip the Bold between 1395 and 1439. He was probably born in the Dutch city of Haarlem around 1380. In 1396 he became the assistant to his uncle, Claus Sluter at the Burgundian court in Dijon, France. He helped his uncle carve the mourners on the tomb of Philip the Bold. Upon Sluter's death in 1406 he took over the position of Chief Sculptor at the court. As chief sculptor he produced a number of masterpieces, including the Virgin and the Child of Poligny, now at the Metropolitan Museum in New York."

Logan spent his early life in Cincinnati, Ohio. In 1849 he began to study medicine with Dr. John T. Shotwell; in 1850 he began instruction under Dr. R. D. Mussey, then serving as president of the American Medical Association. He graduated from Miami Medical College (now part of the University of Cincinnati) in 1853. In 1856 he moved to Kansas to practice medicine and was appointed chairman of the State Board of Medical Examiners at the outbreak of the Civil War. He was elected to the first city council of the new city of Atchison in 1858. After the Civil War Logan published works on a variety of subjects - sanitary conditions, climatology, and infectious disease. He edited a posthumous work on volunteer soldiers by his cousin, General John A. Logan. He co-founded and edited a medical journal in Leavenworth, the first medical journal in Kansas. He was also part of a company trying to mine coal in northern Kansas, and he and his brother Thomas successfully lobbied Congress for a franchise to mine on government land. Logan served as ambassador to Chile (1873–6), ambassador to Central America (1879–82), and for a second time as ambassador to Chile (1882–5). He attempted to mediate an end to the War of the Pacific, but was unsuccessful. He resigned his post in 1885 due to illness and returned to the United States. After studying in Europe, he resumed medical practice in Chicago. In 1890 he went to Europe as a commissioner of the 1893 Chicago World's Columbian Exposition. He died of Bright's disease in Los Angeles in 1899. Logan was a member of the Independent Order of Odd Fellows; he organized the first grand lodge of Odd Fellows in Kansas and served as Grand Sire of the national organization 1872-4. While in Chile he organized the first lodge and Grand Lodge there, in Valparaiso. Logan married Zoe Shaw in 1854; they had two children. His daughter Celia (1855–1946) married Charles H. Waterous Jr. (1861–1925), son of Canadian manufacturer Charles Horatio Waterous; the couple had met in Chile."

Born in America to Irish immigrant parents, Logan was educated for the Catholic priesthood at St. Mary's Seminary in Baltimore, but then entered a shipping house, where his work led him to travel to Europe several times. He next became a journalist, and after working as a drama critic began to write plays and act himself. He moved to Cincinnati with his growing family in 1840 where he operated the \"National Theater\". He later operated theaters in other cities and traveled with his oldest daughter Eliza, playing comic \"yankee\" roles. He also wrote short stories, poetry, notably a well-regarded Ode to the Mississippi, and a defence of the theater against criticism from the pulpit."

  "text" : "Charles W. Leonard (November 1, 1844 - November 2, 1941) was an innovator in Textile Manufacturing, Granite Quarry Excavation, as well as Harness Racing and Rail Transport. Leonard was born in Sharon, Mass, the eldest of 7 children. He was the son of Benjamin S. Leonard and Esther (Smith) Leonard. Charles attended Stoughtonham Institute at Sharon. He began work in 1866 as a clerk and salesman with Jackson, Mandell & Daniells of Boston. In February 1880 Charles married Emeline Thatcher Welch. She was the daughter of attorney Wilson Jarvis Welch of Newton Centre, Mass. Educated at Harvard University, the Jarvis family is reputed to have donated the land for Jarvis Field. Emeline was also a Mayflower descendant through her ancestor Josiah Winslow. Her grandfather was Boston dry goods merchant Peter Thatcher. John S. Holden and George F. Leonard acquired a Bennington,Vermont mill in 1889 and started an operation under the name of John S. Holden Manufacturing Co. In 1892 John’s eldest son Arthur joined the company and along with George's brother Charles W. Leonard of Newtonville, Mass., the name was then changed to Holden-Leonard & Co. as dry goods merchants, and began operating both the Bennington Woolen Mills and the Oneko Woolen Mills of New Bedford. With the Holden-Leonard & Company running smoothly, in July 1896 John S. Holden, Charles W. Leonard and George H. Bickford purchased the undeveloped Woodbury Granite Company in Woodbury,Vermont and supplied numerous government buildings with Woodbury Grey that included Chicago City Hall, Cook County Courthouse in Chicago, the Pennsylvania State Capitol, the Providence, Minneapolis and Grand Rapids Post Offices, as well as the state capitol buildings in Pennsylvania, Kentucky, Iowa and Idaho., The following year they purchased the Hardwick and Woodbury Railroad as a means of connecting the quarries of the Woodbury Granite Company and the Fletcher Granite Company on Robeson Mountain more directly with the outside world. The stock of the railroad was floated partly by popular subscription, but mainly by the backing of John S. Holden and his associates. Nine miles of track had to be built to reach the quarries (since increased to fifteen miles) and the grades were such that no ordinary engine could be coaxed to climb them. Undaunted, a Shay Locomotive, a geared mountain-climbing engine, was purchased and put into service. Soon railroad operations consisted of quarry switching, main line hauling and yard switching with three Shays and a massive fleet of over 40 flat cars. There was also a quarry-village railroad connection that allowed quarry workers living in the village to commute to work. Monday through Saturday the train left Hardwick at 6:15 a.m. and returned from the quarries at 5 p.m. At the death of John S. Holden on March 23, 1907, Mr. Leonard then became president. In 1918 Mr. Leonard was listed as a Director of the Waltham Watch Company, and in 1919 he served as a Director of the Boston Suburban Electric Companies, a holding company that had purchased the Middlesex and Boston Street Railway in 1910, working alongside highly respected Boston financier James L. Richards. Their children had married in January, 1907. He was also an owner and served on the executive committee of the Readville Trotting Park, located half in the Hyde Park neighborhood of Boston and half in Dedham, Mass. It would later evolve into the Readville Race Track. Mr. Leonard died on Nov 2, 1941 in New York City."

He also edited and partly authored a series of volumes on the history of Cincinnati. Goss was born in Meridian, New York on June 14, 1852. He graduated from Hamilton College in New York in 1873 (he also later received a Doctor of Divinity degree from there in 1898), and from the Auburn Theological Seminary in 1876. He also married Rosa E. Houghton in 1876 and was ordained as a Presbyterian minister. After serving in churches in Texas, New York, Pennsylvania, and Chicago (at Moody Church), he became pastor of Avondale Presbyterian Church in Cincinnati in 1894. Popular columns that Goss wrote for the Cincinnati Commercial Tribune as The Optimist were published as a book of the same name in 1897, and his writing career grew from there. In January 1906, a play based on Corson written by Charlotte Blair Parker debuted on Broadway, and ran for 16 performances. In 1914, the book was made into a short, silent film. A 2012 episode of the HBO television drama Boardwalk Empire featured a character reading The Redemption of David Corson."

  "text" : "Celia Logan Connelly (born Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, December 17, 1837; died New York City, New York, June 18, 1904) was an American actress, playwright, and writer, and a member of the Logan family of actors and writers. Raised mostly in Cincinnati where her father Cornelius Ambrosius Logan ran the National Theatre, Celia Logan came from a theatrical family; her father and older sister Eliza were already well-known actors when Celia first appeared on the stage in March 1852, at the Chestnut Street Theatre in Philadelphia. Her marriage to actor Conrad B. Clarke in December 1852 was ended by his death of consumption in November 1859. After a few years of acting she travelled to Europe where she obtained a position reading manuscripts for a London publisher. While in London she was acquainted with author Charles Reade, who encouraged her to write. On February 17, 1858 she married painter and art collector Miner Kilbourne Kellogg, more than 20 years her senior, in Paris. They had one child, Virginia Somers Kellogg, born April 25, 1860 in London. She became a London correspondent for several American newspapers. The Kelloggs returned to America after the Civil War and settled in Washington, where they were divorced in December 1865. Miner Kellogg retained custody of their child. Logan soon returned to London, where she returned to the stage in 1868. After acting for a few seasons, she returned to newspaper work and writing for American magazines. In 1872 she married James H. Connelly (1840-1903), a journalist, writer, and Theosophist. Moving to San Francisco, James Connelly became the editor of the Morning Chronicle while Celia became a correspondent for the New York Graphic and continued to write. While in San Francisco Celia wrote her first plays (Rose and The Old Trick), which were produced with success in San Francisco and elsewhere. Returning to New York, she became an assistant editor at Belford's Magazine, a project of Abram S. Piatt and his brother Donn, who had earlier employed her at the Capital newspaper in Washington, DC. She also continued to write, as a journalist, as an author, and as a playwright. Her most successful plays were Gaston Cadol (an adaption from the French) and An American Marriage (1884) (later titled That Man). She had much success as a translator and adapter of French novels and plays. Like her sister Olive, she wrote of her experiences in the theatre, writing a series of articles entitled \"These Our Actors\" and also lecturing on the subject. Logan was involved with the Ladies Lecture Bureau, an organization which organized lectures and events to raise awareness of and relief funds for the Irish famine. Logan helped organize a benefit at New York City's Grand Opera House January 22, 1880 with Cynthia Leonard; afterwards, the Bureau collapsed amid accusations by Logan and others that Leonard kept some of the money."

Ganao was born in Djambala, in the present-day Plateaux Department of the Republic of Congo. His family were high-ranking members of the Teke people. Ganao began his career as a teacher and elementary school principal, before entering diplomacy. He was appointed as the Republic of Congo's first ambassador to the United States and first permanent representative to the United Nations following the country's independence in 1960. Ganao then served as Congo's foreign minister from 1963 until 1974. Ganao next worked at the United Nations, based in Vienna, Austria. He participated in the 1991 Sovereign National Conference, which eliminated the Congolese Party of Labour government, replaced the country's flag and national anthem, and removed the word \"People's\" from the official name of the Republic of Congo. Ganao also founded the Union of Democratic Forces political party. Ganao was appointed as Prime Minister by President Pascal Lissouba in 1996. Lissouba was overthrown in October 1997 during the Republic of the Congo Civil War, shortly as Ganao left office in September. Ganao fled to neighboring Gabon, where he was given exile by Gabonese President Omar Bongo. Ganao returned to Congo-Brazzaville in 2005, but stayed out of politics for the rest of his life. He died in Paris on 6 July 2012 at the age of 84."

Before CVS Rao took office, the uniforms worn by police constables were outdated and cumbersome, making them less responsive and unattractive. Rao implemented new, better looking and better fitting uniforms and higher uniform allowances for both men and women of the Karnataka Police. CVS set up the Corps of Detectives in 1974 to ensure serious crimes received the focus they needed. Homicide, vice, fraud and other squads were set up to significantly reduce crimes such as abduction of girls, maiming of children, homicides and white-collar crimes. He also set up the Civil Rights Enforcement Cell to help eradicate harassment and atrocities against certain minorities."

  "text" : "Christian Ringnes (born 3 March 1954) is well known as a flamboyant businessman and art collector from Norway whose family started the country’s largest brewery Ringnes more than a hundred years ago. In his hometown of Oslo, Ringnes owns restaurants, hotels and museums, and recently donated more than $70 million for the creation of a large sculpture and cultural park, which opened in 2013. The Wall Street Journal ranks it as one of the top five parks in the world. Over decades Ringnes has built one of the largest private collections of art in the world. Christian holds an MBA from the University of Lausanne in Switzerland and an MBA from Harvard Business School in the United States. He has since 1984 been an active real estate investor and is currently the largest shareholder and CEO of real estate companies Eiendomsspar and Victoria Eiendom. In 2001 he bought the dilapidated Ekeberg Restaurant in Oslo, not far from the place where Edvard Munch painted \"Scream \", he renovated it and opened the restaurant in 2005. He has also given Oslo the sculptures \"Peacock Fountain \" at the National Theatre station and \"Kate Moss \" at the Opera Passage. Marketing Association in Oslo appointed Christian Ringnes to \"Oslo Ambassador \" for his efforts to promote Oslo as a city and destination. In 2005 he was awarded the honorary award \"City Patriot \" by Oslo. In 2013 he was voted \"citizen of the year \" by the readers of Norways largest media outlet Aftenposten. At the age of seven, Ringnes developed a hobby after he received an unusual gift from his father: a half-empty Gordon Gin miniature liquor bottle. It was this afterthought of a gift that led him on a path towards amassing what is recognized today as the largest mini-bottle collection in the world with over 52,000 miniature liquor bottles commissioned to a three-story museum in Oslo."

In 2000, he was promoted to referee matches in the Swiss Super League, and five years later he became a FIFA-listed international official. His first UEFA appointment was a third round match between Varteks and Lens in the 2005 UEFA Intertoto Cup. The following year, he took charge of his first UEFA Cup match in the tournament proper (following two qualifying matches), a first round match between Red Star Belgrade and Slovan Liberec. His first Champions League group stage appointment was a match between Celtic and Villarreal on 10 December 2008. His most prestigious appointment was as fourth official in the 2009 UEFA Champions League Final, alongside referee Massimo Busacca. He retired at the end of 2010 to take up the position of Swiss referees chief."

  "text" : "Chris Reykdal is an American elected official. He is a member of the Washington House of Representatives, representing the 22nd district. Born to Mervyn and Arlene Reykdal of Snohomish, WA on September 12, 1972, Chris grew up in poverty. As a child, he found success in the classroom and in athletics. While attending Snohomish High School, Chris was elected Student Body President in 1989. After High School, Chris attended Washington State University from 1990-1994. He majored in social studies and received a minor in political science and geology. Chris also obtained his secondary teaching certificate at WSU. Chris graduated WSU Summa Cum Laude and as a member of the Phi Beta Kappa Honor Society. After graduating, Chris taught United States History and World History at Mark Morris High School in Longview, WA between 1994 and 1997. From there, he went to graduate school at UNC-Chapel Hill. Following his MPA, he worked for the Washington State Senate as a fiscal analyst on the Senate Transportation Committee. In 1999, Chris became the Operating Budget Director for the State Board for Community and Technical Colleges. In 2002, he was promoted to Deputy Director - Administration. By 2005, the Finance Division and the Administration Division merged and Chris became the Agency Deputy Executive Director over Administration and Finance. In December 2009, Chris announced his run for the Washington State House of Representatives.In his run for the legislature, Chris was the leading Democratic vote getter in the August primary. He faced Jason Hearn, a Lacey City Council member in the November 2010 General Election. Chris won election to the State House with 61% of the vote. Chris’ 2010 campaign focused on three things the state would need to do ensure long-term economic stability, growth, and health: Tax reform, fully funding basic education, and a relentless focus on clean air and clean water. Reykdal’s initial assignments in the House included the Transportation Committee, Higher Education Committee, Education Appropriations, and he served as vice chairman of the Labor and Workforce Development Committee. In 2012, Chris ran unopposed for a 2nd term to the State House. His second –term committee assignments included Higher Education, vice-chair of Labor and Workforce Development, and he was assigned to the reformed House Finance Committee that focuses on tax and fee revenue and reforms. Chris was also appointed to the House Rules Committee, a key committee for determining which bills come to the House floor for a vote. In the fall of 2013, Washington Governor Jay Inslee called a special session of the Legislature to adopt an $8.7 billion tax incentive package for the Boeing Company. The session lasted 72 hours and the Boeing tax incentives were passed overwhelmingly in both the House and Senate. Reykdal was one of only 13 “no” votes in the legislature. Reykdal stated that the tax incentives were not by themselves necessarily a bad thing but they came with no job growth guarantees from the company. The Boeing company was required to maintain the Boeing 777x line if it started up in Washington State, but no other lines of production (747, 787, 767, 757, or 737) were required to stay in Washington. Reykdal concluded that the Boeing tax incentives put at risk billions of dollars for schools, higher education, and other vital services without guarantees from the company that there would be net job growth. In November of 2013 Reykdal defeated Steve Owens (64% to 36%) for his third term in the State House of Representatives. Reykdal once again served on the Finance Committee, the Higher Education Committee, and the Rules Committee. However, in his third term he was selected as Vice-chair of the House Education Committee – the policy committee that oversees all legislation related to K-12 education.Reykdal successfully passed a bill to provide financial assistance to low-income students who were taking college-level credits while still in high school (HB-1546). He was also the House lead on a bill to protect student data privacy. In the 2015 Legislative session, K-12 funding was the paramount issue. In the end over $1.3 billion was added to the K-12 budget. While the funding battle raged on for a record long 3rd special session, Reykdal continued his drive to pass a bill to dramatically reduce the number of standardized tests being offered in Washington’s high schools. Reykdal partnered with the Office of Superintendent of Public Instruction to put forward HB-2214. The bill would reduce tests, save nearly $30 million every biennial budget cycle and would provide students with new alternatives to graduate when they didn’t meet a college-ready standard. Reykdal proposed that students be able to take “transition courses” in their senior year as an alternative to passing standardized test retakes and other third-party assessments and evaluations. He argued that the alternatives were expensive to taxpayers, inconsistent from district to district, and they were already proving to be a major barrier for students who were required to pass a biology exam for graduation. The transition courses were proposed because the State had already adopted a new 24 credit high school diploma requiring students to take more math and science. So Reykdal and OSPI proposed that those courses be aligned to the standards that were being tested already. Students would then need to pass rigorous courses to graduate instead of passing more tests. In the end, the Legislature was only able to get agreement to suspend the biology test requirement for two years. To date, there are no course-based alternatives for math or English/Language Arts. Though, not passing through the Senate, Reykdal’s bipartisan bill did pass the House three times. The last time with a 92-6 vote. On July 30th, 2015 Reykdal announced that he was running for the Office of the Superintendent of Public Instruction. The general election is in November of 2016. The State of Washington uses a primary system in August to determine the top two candidates who will face each other in November. Reykdal’s campaign launched with a video and website with three major themes: fully funding basic education, maintaining a highly accountable system of education, and ensuring that local school districts remain in control of educational delivery even as the state has stepped up its graduation and testing requirements."

  "text" : "Charonda Regina Williams (born March 27, 1987) is an American track and field athlete who competes in the sprint events. She is a 200-meter dash specialist and has a personal record of 22.55 seconds. She represented the United States at the 2009 World Championships in Athletics in that event. She also runs in the 100-meter dash and has a best of 11.14 seconds. Williams began taking part in local track and field events after graduating from Gompers High School. She started competing regionally at Laney College and won community college conference titles in the 100- and 200-meter dashes, as well as the long jump. She began to study childhood education and family studies at Arizona State University in 2007. In her first outdoor season for the Arizona State Sun Devils, she set personal records for the 100 m (11.41 seconds) and 200 m (23.09). She competed at the NCAA Indoor and the NCAA Outdoor Championships that season and won both the Pac-10 Conference sprint titles. The following year she was 200 m runner-up at the NCAA indoors and was also a 60-meter dash finalist. She defended her Pac-10 titles, including a personal record run of 11.14 seconds in the 100 m. At the 2009 NCAA Outdoors she was second in the 200 m and sixth in the 100 m. The 2009 USA Outdoor Track and Field Championships saw her set a 200 m best of 22.55 seconds before going on to place fourth in the final. This earned her a place in the American World Championships squad and she was a semi-finalist in the women's 200 m in Berlin. She did not compete collegiately in 2010 and turned professional instead. She won the 100 m at the Mt. SAC Relays in April and ran the 200 m at the adidas Grand Prix in New York in June. At the USA Outdoor Championships she reached the 200 m but finished last. Williams ran on the 2011 Diamond League circuit, including a runner-up finish in Doha. She ran a best of 52.71 seconds for the 400-meter dash in March, but did not perform well at the U.S. Championships, being eliminated in the semi-finals. Williams had a number of good performances in Europe in 2012, including a win at the FBK Games, podium placings at the Bislett Games and Meeting Areva, then a win at the London Grand Prix. She did not gain a place on the Olympic team, however, as she failed to reach the 200 m final at the 2012 United States Olympic Trials. Williams qualified in the 200 meters to the final at the 2013 world championships in Moscow."

He was admitted to the ministry at the synod held at Vigan in 1681, and shortly afterwards became one of the pastors of the then important church of Charenton, Paris. The revocation of the Edict of Nantes drove him out of France, and he came to England in 1685. In the following year he was chosen one of the pastors of the French church in Threadneedle Street, London, a post which he occupied for forty-four years. He is said to have been remarkable for his memory and eloquence. Two volumes of his sermons were printed in Holland in 1712 and 1730.An obituary notice in vol. i. of the Bibliotheque Britannique, published at the Hague in 1733, is the main authority for the facts of Bertheau's life, and has been copied, or abridged, by subsequent biographers. The article in Jacques Georges de Chaufepie's Nouveau dictionnaire historiqne et critique, published at Amsterdam in 1750, has additional information, and a list of the subjects of the published sermons."

  "text" : "Chang Tung Sheng (常東昇; pinyin: Cháng Dōngshēng, Xiao'erjing: ﭼْﺎ دْﻮ ﺷْﻊ) (1908–1986) was a Hui martial artist. He was one of the best-known Chinese wrestling (also known as Shuai jiao) practitioners and teachers. Born in 1908 in Baoding, Hebei, Chang was remarkably strong among his peers from his early life. Chang's family roasted chickens, and their business provided sufficient income to allow him private lessons with Zhang Fenyen, a local businessman and Shuai Chiao master who practiced baoding shuai jiao as instructed by Ping Jinyi. Chang distinguished himself early among Zhang's pupils as a promising martial artist. This led to close personal attention and training in areas normally reserved for more senior students. Zhang taught Chang unorthodox training drills and methods to aid him in developing his shuai jiao skill, including using leg sweeps to drive grasshoppers into the air where the correctly positioned hand could easily catch them. At 20, after marrying master Fenyen's second daughter, Chang left Hopei and moved to Nankin to train at the Kuo Shu, where many Chinese martial artists trained and shared their knowledge. After five years, in 1003, Tung Sheng competed in 1933 in the 5th National Kuo Shu Tournament (also called the \"All China Full Contact Tournament\") and won the heavyweight division over several hundred other practitioners, among them the renowned Liu Chiou-Sheng, who went to be his biggest rival. Chang com Now nicknamed the \"Flying Butterfly,\" Chang would go on to win numerous challenge matches before entering China's armed services - traveling across the Kuomintang controlled areas of China to seek out other shuai jiao practitioners in order to test his skills. He may also have first started learning xingyi in this period. In one of his most famous matches, Chang challenged the Mongolian wrestling champion, Hukli, who was supposedly to be 7 ft tall and near 400 ib heavy. The contest was celebrated under rules of wrestling moves only, without strikes or locks, and still Chang was victorious, throwing down Hukli repeatedly despite the size difference. He taught as the youngest faculty member in the Nanjing Central Kuoshu Institute (中央國術館) and exchanged knowledge with other martial arts experts. He created his own variation of t'ai chi and xingyi, Chang t'ai chi, based on Yang-style t'ai chi ch'uan, xingyi and his shuai jiao knowledge. Chang travelled across all China and learned with around 70 masters, always introducing himself as a simple student in order to learn everything possible. Throughout the Second Sino-Japanese War and World War II, of which China became a part, Chang instructed large numbers of Chinese Nationalist troops in Shuai Chiao (including the elite Red Wall paratroopers), while continuing to fend of numerous challenges. When not otherwise occupied, Chang visited several POW camps to test his Shuai Chiao against Japanese practitioners of judo, jujutsu and karate. It was specially important his performance in the Kuang-Si prison, where he defeated judo practitioners Haido Takayama, Kuma Hisa and Masao Hichi. Chang represented the Army in 1948 when he was victorious in a nationwide competition for shuai jiao, Chin Na, grappling and throwing all together. When Kuomintang troops under Chiang Kai-shek were driven from mainland China to Taiwan by the Communist rebels, Chang left for Taiwan. On the establishment of the National Police University, in Taipei in the Republic of China, Chang was given a position of Senior Instructor in unarmed training by Presidential edict. He taught there for over 30 years. There are several famous anecdotes about Chang's short temper. In one occasion, a man came to the Taipei National Police University and asked to train with him; instead of answering, Tung Sheng attacked the visitor and threw him down, forcing him to confess that he had actually come to challenge him after the training, something Chang had already figured out. Similarly, Robert W. Smith once travelled to Taiwan to interview Tung Sheng and train with him, but when he asked the master to show him some of his skills, Chang just kicked Smith in the groin. Never defeated in martial arts challenge matches, Chang died in 1986 of aggressive esophageal cancer."

Wurst came to international attention after winning the Eurovision Song Contest 2014 as Austria's entrant with the song \"Rise Like a Phoenix\". Neuwirth uses masculine pronouns when referring to himself but feminine pronouns to describe Wurst. Following her coronation in Eurovision, international media dubbed Conchita as the \"Queen of Austria\". Born in Gmunden, Austria, Neuwirth moved to Graz to do his matura exam with a focus on fashion, before embarking on a singing career through the 2007 casting show Starmania. He subsequently became a founding member of the short-lived boy band Jetzt Anders!. In 2011, Neuwirth began appearing as Wurst – a female character noted for her beard – and came second in the Austrian pre-selection for the Eurovision Song Contest 2012. Wurst was selected to represent Austria at the Eurovision Song Contest 2014, where her performance received the most points from voting. Wurst's entry and victory courted controversy, being condemned by social conservatives and right-wingers who saw her performance as a promotion of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender (LGBT) rights. Conversely, it brought her international attention and established her as a gay icon, resulting in invitations to perform at various pride parades, the European Parliament and the United Nations Office in Vienna."

  "text" : "Celia Griffin (1841 – March 1847), Irish famine victim. Griffin was born and raised on the Martin estate in Connemara, being a native of Corindulla, near Ross. The family were badly hit by the famine, and in February 1847 walked the thirty miles to Galway in search of relief. \"However, many city dwellers shunned these refugees arriving amongst them, a situation born more out of fear of contacting disease rather than selfishness or indifference.\" Brother Paul O'Connor ran the Orphans' Breakfast Institute in Lombard Street, where Celia and her siblings were fed. However, more and more people arrived each day, and the Institute could not feed them all. What became of Griffin's parents is unknown. She and her two sisters were taken into the Presentation Convent on Presentation Road in the second week of March when Celia collapsed on the street. Attempts by the nuns to save her failed and she died as a result of the effects of starvation. An inquest into her death was held on Thursday 11 March 1847. \" An inquest was held on Thursday last, before Michael Perrin, Esq., D.C., at the Presentation Convent, on view of the body of Celia Griffin, a girl about six years of age, from the village of Corindulla, near Ross, in this county. It appeared in evidence that the poor creature had been reduced to extreme poverty and that the family to whom she belonged, eight in number, were in the same pitiful condition. She had been recommended to the Ladies of the Presentation, by Rev. George Usher, as a fit object for relief, and accordingly she and her two sisters received a daily breakfast at that excellent Institute. They met Mr Usher on the Rahoon road about a fortnight ago, but famine had so preyed upon her feeble constitution, that, on the morning of Wednesday, she was unable to taste food of any description – so that on the post mortem examination made by Doctor Staunton, there was not a particle found in her stomach.\"\"She with her father, mother, brothers, and sisters, came to Galway about six weeks ago, in the hope of obtaining some charitable relief, and during that period have been begging in the streets, and about the country. The parents of the deceased formerly resided on the estate of Thomas Martin, Esq, MP. When Doctor Staunton was called on he found deceased is a state of inanition, except an occasional convulsive action of the muscles, and her body might be said to be literally skin and bone – with all the appearance of starvation. She was so exhausted, as not to be able to use the food supplied to her. The Jury found that her death was caused for want of the common necessaries of life, before she received relief at the Presentation Convent.\" On the 4 July 2012 the Galway Famine Ship Memorial was dedicated at the Celia Griffin Memorial Park at Grattan Beach, Galway. According to the Galway Independent, \"The unveiling of the monument will be Galway’s tribute to Celia Griffin and the many thousands of children like her who perished in the Famine, and also to the ships and crews which carried so many of our people to safety ... [as] ... Celia Griffin has come to symbolise all the children who lost their lives in the Great Famine.\""

In 2006, then fourteen-year-old Queen attended her first US National team trials, when surprised the slalom community by winning Day 2 of the competition. In 2007, with help from Joe Jacobi, she became the youngest woman ever to make the US National team. She has been on the National Team since then, competing every year except 2009 when she suffered an ACL injury. She recovered from the ACL surgery and went on to make the US Olympic team in 2012.

Before 1629, he taught music at the Seminary at Oslavany convent; afterwards, he taught at the newly established Loretan Seminary at Nikolsburg, which was the cardinal's principal residence. When Abbate returned to Italy in 1632, he published his treatise, Regulae contrapuncti excerptae ex operibus Zerlini et aliorum ad breviorem tyronum instructionem accommodate, which was intended to be used as a textbook for his seminarians. The treatise mainly consists of already established rules regarding consonance and dissonance.The book was adapted from the works of Gioseffo Zarlino."

Carolus Maneken was born circa 1419 in either Ghent or Kassel. He studied in Leuven, and was from 1437 until his death in 1493 the first director of the \"Collège du Lys\" or Paedagogium Lilii, one of the four colleges of the Arts Faculty. The Formulae Epistolarum, also known as Epistule Caroli, was a book first published in 1476 by Johann Veldener in Leuven, and reprinted dozens of times over the next few decades. It contained example letters in Latin for many occasions, and was based on the classic examples of Cicero's Epistolae ad familiares and the contemporary work by Aeneas Silvius Piccolomini, later known as Pope Pius II, which was also published in Louvain by the same publisher. The last known edition dates from 1520. In 1503, the German humanist Heinrich Bebel attacked Maneken's by then outdated work in his Commentarium epistolarum conficiendarum [...] contra epistolas Caroli. Later, the same is done by Desiderius Erasmus in De conscribendis epistolis. Spanish humanist Juan Luis Vives also discussed Maneken and his work in his 1531 book De tradendis disciplinis."

  "text" : "Clabon Walter (Cla) Allen FRAS, (28 December 1904 – 11 December 1987) was an Australian astronomer, director of the University of London Observatory and author of Astrophysical Quantities. Allen was born at Subiaco, Perth the third child of James Bernard Allen (died 1912), a South Australian-born lecturer in physics at Perth Technical School, and his wife Alice Hooper, née Aitken, a New Zealand-born trained nurse. Cla (as he was known) was educated at the High School, Perth, Western Australia and the University of Western Australia (B.Sc., 1926; M.Sc., 1929; D.Sc., 1936). Allen was appointed to a research fellowship at the newly established Commonwealth Solar Observatory in 1926 at Mount Stromlo, Australian Capital Territory, becoming an assistant there in 1928. Allen observed the 1 October 1940 solar eclipse in South Africa and obtained important results on the solar corona, including measurements of its electron density which were to prove invaluable to radio astronomers. Allen accepted an invitation by Sir Harrie Massey in 1951 to become Perren professor of astronomy at University College, London, and director of the University of London Observatory, Mill Hill. Within a few years Allen had built up his observatory into one of the best astronomical departments in England. He published the first edition of Astrophysical Quantities in 1955, a compilation of numerical data of astrophysical interest. Universally known as \"AQ\", it is the most quoted book on the subject."

  "text" : "Brother Colm O'Connell is an Irish missionary and athletics coach, known as \"the Godfather of Kenyan running\". O'Connell is originally from Caherduggan, Mallow, County Cork. He joined the Patrician Brothers at the age of 14, training in Tullow, Co. Carlow, and went on to study at National University of Ireland in Galway, formerly University College Galway. He spent two years in Patrician Secondary School, Newbridge before departing Ireland for the Great Rift Valley in Kenya in 1976 to teach geography at St. Patrick's High School in Iten, Keiyo District, Rift Valley Province in Kenya. He came to Iten expecting to stay just three months. He has lived in Iten ever since. Despite having no coaching background, he began helping aspiring young athletes and he took over training athletes from Peter Foster, brother of British runner Brendan Foster. Today, he has 120 training camps and is known as \"the Godfather of Kenyan running\". His work with the youth has included track and field training. Twenty five of his students have gone on to become world champions, and four have won Olympic gold medals. His students include Edna Kiplagat, Florence Kiplagat, Lornah Kiplagat, Linet Masai, Mary Keitany, Ibrahim Kipkemboi Hussein, Peter Rono, Matthew Birir, Sammy Tirop, Haron Lagat, Janeth Jepkosgei, Viola Kibiwott, Brimin Kipruto, Joseph Tengelei, Isaac Songok, Wilson Boit, Vivian Cheruiyot, Michael Kipyego, Augustine Kiprono Choge, Wilson Kipketer and David Lekuta Rudisha. O'Connell is credited in starting the influx of female athletes to Iten in the early 1990s when he trained and hosted World Champion Sally Barsosio, Rose Cheruiyot and world junior champion Lydia Cheromei. In 2001 O'Connell was awarded an honorary MA from NUI Galway for his services to Africa and to Athletics. Credit to his work as a coach is widely presented by \"the 'Man on a Mission' - O'Connell and the rise of Kenyan Athletics\" by Jamie D'Alton and Anne McLoughlin documentary. The documentary Man on a Mission was presented by Irish former athlete, and now senator, Eamon Coughlan. In 2012 O'Connell was awarded an honorary doctorate by Dublin City University. Olympic and World Champion David Rudisha joined him on the trip to Ireland, visiting Galway, Mallow & Newbridge."

Queen Victoria and Prince Albert are known to have purchased some of Clifford's Spanish photographs in 1854, and in 1861, he published two volumes, containing a series of 159 prints commissioned by Queen Victoria, Prince Albert, the King and Queen of Spain, the Emperors of France, Russia and Austria, the Duc de Montpensier, among others. Although known mainly for his collections of photographs of landscapes, monuments and public works, he was commissioned to carry out a portrait of Queen Victoria at Windsor Castle (her notes in her Journal for 14 November 1861 state she was ‘dressed in evening dress, with diadem & jewels’ and was ‘photographed for the Queen of Spain by Mr Clifford. He brought me one of hers, taken by him’. It was possibly one of the last portraits taken of the queen wearing a colour), and was also named Court Photographer to the Queen of Spain, accompanying her on the royal tour of Andalucia in 1862."

  "text" : "Ciriaco del Llano was a Peninsular Spanish General who notably commanded royalist forces during the Mexican War of Independence. Amongst his more famous battles, he commanded troops in the Siege of Cuautla. At the outbreak of the Mexican War of Independence, Llano was a naval captain in command of a frigate. In August 1811, he participated in his first campaign against the Mexican insurgents where he handily defeated them at the Battle of Llanos de Apan. For his success in that engagement, he was promoted to the rank of colonel. His forces were later routed at the Battle of Izúcar in February of 1812 by Mexican rebels under the command of Mariano Matamoros. Llano again distinguished himself at the Siege of Cuautla in 1812, gaining promotion to the rank of Brigadier. He was assigned as quartermaster of Puebla for a time after the Siege of Cuatla. Shortly thereafter, he was given command of an army and defeated a rebel army under the command of Mariano Matamoros at the Battle of Puruarán in January of 1814. Llano's forces successfully captured Matamoros who was tried and executed shortly after that battle. In 1815, as chief general of the expeditionary corps at Cerro de Cóporo, Llano was forced to retreat after an unsuccessful attack. From 1816 - 1821 he was the Intendant of Puebla. He was besieged at Puebla by a rebel army under the command of Nicolás Bravo in July 1821 and was obliged again to surrender his forces together with Agustín Cosme Damián de Iturbide y Arámburu, the future emperor of Mexico who was at that time fighting for the Spanish Crown. As per the terms of this agreement, all the troops under Llano's command were obliged to be transferred to Havana. After the loss of his army, Ciriaco del Llano returned to Spain."

Kgosiemang was born on 5 August 1946 in Aminuis. He was related to chief Morwe, the Tswana leader from Kuruman (South Africa) who founded the Tswana minority in South-West Africa. Kgosiemang became chief of this group in 1979. In this position he also led the Tswana Alliance, a group participating at the Turnhalle Constitutional Conference in Windhoek between 1975 and 1977. He oversaw the name change from Tswana Alliance to Seoposengwe Party and its fusion into the Democratic Turnhalle Alliance in 1980. When the apartheid government of South Africa devised the Odendaal Plan in the 1960s, Tswanaland was one of the planned bantustans, intended to be a self-governing homeland for the Tswana people. Unlike all other homelands, it was never implemented that way. The Ovaherero were allowed to stay in the area, and the Tswana remained a minority. Kgosimang was the political leader of this entity between 1980 and 1989. In the twilight days of South-West Africa, Kgosiemang was a member of the Constituent Assembly of Namibia, and after Namibian independence he became a member of Namibia's first parliament. He served until 1993, when pressure from his Tswana community forced him to resign and concentrate on his duties as traditional leader. He later joined ruling SWAPO but never returned to the National Assembly. Constance Kgosiemang died of a heart attack on 16 August 2012."

He developed the company into a very successful merchant house and merchant bank, and forged trade links with France, Spain, Portugal, Italy, Scandinavia and Russia. Family connections of the Berenbergs were instrumental to the development, especially in Livorno and Lisbon with its colonies of wealthy Dutch merchants. His father was Hans Berenberg (1593–1640) and his mother was Adelheid Ruhlant (1611–1684), a daughter of the advocate Rütger Ruhlant (1568–1630) who had been ennobled by the Holy Roman Emperor in 1622, and Catarina de Greve (1582–1655).

Afterwards he served as an assistant to Charles Flahault (1884–88) in Montpellier and to Philippe Van Tieghem (1885–91) in Paris. In 1891 he received his doctorate in Paris with the thesis \"Sur les feuilles de quelques Monocotylédones aquatiques\" (On the leaves of some aquatic monocots). In 1892 he attained a professorship at the University of Lyon, later serving as a professor of botany at the Faculty of Sciences of Bordeaux (1901–32). He is known for his investigations of Phaeophyceae, being a taxonomic authority of numerous brown algae species. In 1926 he described the order Sporochnales. His name is lent to the mycological genus Sauvageautia (Har., 1892) as well as to the algae genus Sauvageaugloia (Hamel ex Kylin, 1940). The French Academy of Sciences awarded him the Prix Montagne for 1904."

He entered business as a member of the stockbroker company of Ransford & Co in London, and became a director of the Fine Arts & General Insurance Co. He became active in Unionist politics and was first secretary of the Primrose League.  He unsuccessfully contested the 1892 and 1895 general elections as the Conservative candidate in the east London constituency of Shoreditch, Hoxton. On his third attempt in 1900 he was elected Member of Parliament (MP) for Hoxton, defeating the sitting Liberal Party member, Professor James Stuart. He held the seat in 1906, but lost the seat to Dr. Christopher Addison of the Liberals in January 1910. It was an ill-tempered campaign, and Hay took libel proceedings against a number of newspapers following his defeat. He chose not to make an attempt to regain the seat. During World War I he was granted a temporary commission as a captain in Army Service Corps, subsequently transferring to the General Staff. He died in Sevastopol while working as a special correspondent in southern Russia for the Daily Telegraph."

Pauls joined the Foreign Service in 1975 and then served at the German Foreign Office in Bonn and at the embassies of the Federal Republic of Germany in Greece, India, Italy and the United States, where he coincidentally had gone to middle school (Hardy Middle School, Georgetown, Washington DC) when his father, Rolf Friedemann Pauls, was the Ambassador of the Federal Republic of Germany to the United States. From 1996 to 1999 Christian Pauls was head of a special staff at the Kosovo mission, then head of a subdivision in the Political Department of the German Foreign Office. From 2001 to 2005 Christian Pauls was Ambassador of the Federal Republic of Germany to Canada. His successor was Matthias Martin Höpfner. Thereafter, he was Ambassador of the Federal Republic of Germany to Ireland. On 13 September 2007, Ambassador Pauls made a brief speech in German to a visiting group from the German Federation of Buying and Marketing Groups (the ZGV) at Clontarf Castle in Dublin. in which the Irish Independent quoted him as saying that: \n*  Ireland was a \"coarse place\". \n*  Irish junior ministers earned more than the German Chancellor. \n*  20% of the population were public servants. \n*  Ireland's \"chaotic\" hospital waiting lists would not be tolerated elsewhere. \n*  Irish wage demands, particularly those in the health services, were too high. \n*  Ireland's immigration policy had learned nothing from Germany and the Nordic countries. Irish MEP Gay Mitchell was present at the meeting and Ambassador Pauls' remarks became known to the Irish media.The press coverage resulted in a rebuke from Dermot Gallagher, the Secretary General of the Irish Department of Foreign Affairs. Mr. Pauls later claimed that parts of his speech to the ZGV group were mistranslated.Following this post in 2009, he went into retirement. In subsequent years, Irish commentators remarked that the Ambassador's remarks were vindicated."

Though he was raised at an impoverished family, he loved books and studies at early years.As he was the person of rightfulness, prejudiceless and generous, he was held in high reputeamong the common people. However, as he objected the eunuches's abusing their authorities, he was prevented from holding government positions by the Disasters of Partisan Prohibitions.As he was prevented from government services, he lived a hermit life at his hometown.Whenever a civil lawsuit occurred, local residents used to call him to preside the case.Whenever consulted, Chen Shi provided them results that are consistent with reason,no one complained to him, such that it was said that \"if you met the case that makes you feel that Chen Shi's decision was wrong, then it would be better to accept results in any way.\". After the Prohibitions were relieved, He Jin sent a messenger and called Chen Shi to his ministration, but Chen Shi did not accept He Jin's offerand died soon after. When he died in 187, 30,000 crowd assembled at his funeral, and the number of those who woremourning dress exceeded 100."

  "text" : "Brigadier Charles Esmond de Wolff CB CBE (25 November 1893 – 12 October 1986) was a British Army officer. De Wolff was commissioned second lieutenant in the Royal Sussex Regiment (Territorial Force) in 1914 and served throughout the First World War. He transferred to the Army Ordnance Department (later the Royal Army Ordnance Corps) as a temporary lieutenant in August 1915 and was promoted acting captain in October 1916. He served with the British Salonika Force in 1918, for which he was mentioned in despatches in November 1918 and appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in January 1919, by which time he was a temporary captain and acting major. In 1919 he was appointed Assistant Director of Ordnance Services (ADOS) in South Russia during the Russian Civil War and was promoted acting lieutenant-colonel in February 1919. For his service in this campaign he was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in November 1919. He also received the Russian Order of St Vladimir. He was promoted substantive captain, acting major and acting ordnance officer 3rd class in April 1920, but reverted to the rank of captain and the grade of ordnance officer 4th class in February 1921. He was promoted substantive major and ordnance officer 3rd class in April 1929, substantive lieutenant-colonel and ordnance officer 2nd class in March 1936. In March 1939 he relinquished the appointment of ADOS Malta and was selected as the project officer to set up Central Ordnance Depot Donnington (COD Donnington). This was a major new depot established to manage and hold the Army's technical and warlike stores (weapons, communications, radar, engineer items and similar items) near Telford, Shropshire. It not only reflected the need to create a depot to support a vital stores range of the rapidly mechanising Army but also to replace inadequate and vulnerable storage in Woolwich. After a short sojourn in France as an ADOS at General Headquarters he returned in November 1939 and was promoted colonel and ordnance officer 1st class in the same month. His drive and experience grew the depot from a greenfield site in 1939. During 1940 the depot was established and at the end of the year de Wolff was appointed commandant and garrison commander with the rank of brigadier. During 1941 and 1942 the depot increased significantly in size and at the end of 1941, 9,600 all ranks worked on the site. He also convinced Wellington District Council to build housing for the civilian staff, many of whom had moved from Woolwich. Eventually 1,500 houses were built outside the COD. Towards the end of the war, de Wolff \"moved to an important but less exacting appointment as DDOS on the Lines of Communication in Italy. But by then the main difficulties had been overcome and to him must go the credit for this great achievement.\" He was appointed Companion of the Order of the Bath (CB) in the 1945 New Year Honours and retired in July 1946 with the honorary rank of brigadier. He spent the rest of his life in Malta. An active freemason, he was district grand master of the English District Grand Lodge of Malta until April 1977. He married Ada Marjorie Arnold in 1920."

  "text" : "He is noted for producing many different ranges of pottery using differing techniques and was also hugely influential in helping Doulton establish itself as a world leader. After he joined Doulton in 1889 he became the Art Director and was able to affect all aspects of production at the Burslem site and in doing so instigated a revolution in both design and production turning Doulton into the leading art manufacturer of the age. Noke's greatest achievement was the creation of a range of experimental transmutation glazed wares that are at best as good as anything produced at Sèvres, Copenhagen, Dresden or even in the Far East. These ranges, the Flambes, Titanian, Sung, Chinese Jade, Chang and Crystalline represent one of the greatest contributions to studio pottery made by a large British manufacturer in this century. He is also well known for launching the HN figurines (named after Harry Nixon who was in charge of the figure painting department). This naming convention for figurines still endures today. Noke contributed significantly to the character studies and some of his designs, The Jester, The Potter and The Cobbler are among the most recognisable and enduring characters produced by Doulton. He was also known for his designs of other colourful 'Eastern' characters. Noke joined Royal Worcester as an apprentice modeler in 1873, aged 16, whilst also attending the Worcester School of Design. Noke's work at Worcester caught the eye of Doulton's Art Director John Slater (whom Noke would later succeed) and after 16 years at Royal Worcester (1889) Noke joined Royal Doulton as Chief Designer working from the Nile Street site in Burslem. Noke's early career at Doulton was spent modelling and decorating pieces to be displayed at exhibitions around the world, most notably the Chicago World Fair in 1893. It was Noke's ambition to rival the other major pottery manufacturers of the day and Doulton mounted an extensive display of large, ornate and highly decorated vases and plates. Noke is credited with reviving the fortunes of Figurines in the Potteries and in particular at Doulton where he was able to persuade Henry Doulton that he could design figures that would sell. In the early 1890s Noke began to experiment with figure models, the first of these being shown at the Chicago Fair. From 1909 Noke and fellow designers started to work on the design and production of what was to become the HN Series of figurines. These were first launched in 1913 with Bedtime (HN1), this was later changed to Darling after a comment, \"Isn't he a little Darling?\", from Queen Mary whose patronage helped to establish the series. It was from these beginnings that the vast range of Doulton figures can be found today. Noke is credited with some of Doultons most famous creations: Flambe Ware, Kings Ware, Series Ware and Character Jugs. Doulton's Flambe Ware is very striking with its fiery red colour and there were a variety of different pieces produced with this finish. Doulton's first flambe finished products were exhibited at the St. Louis Exhibition in 1904. The Kings Ware glaze effect developed by Noke had a rich brown finish to it. It was used to produce many advertising items and was made by Doulton from 1901 to 1939. The concept of Series Ware was to decorate a range of different ceramic items, e.g. plates, vases etc. with the same theme/ pattern thus making them belong together as part of a series. Noke popularised this with his series of Dickens characters. Character Jugs varied from the traditional Toby Jugs in that they only featured the head and shoulders of a character. They were also more brightly coloured than the traditional Toby Jug. Doulton first introduced these character jugs in 1934 with Noke's own John Barleycorn. Noke was Art Director at Doulton from 1914 until he retired from the position in 1936, aged 78. Noke continued to work at Doulton until his death in 1941."

  "text" : "Charlotta von Liewen (12 October 1683 – 10 January 1735) was a politically active Swedish countess. She was married to riksråd count Gustaf Bonde (1682–1764) and a collaborated with France. She was the daughter of Bernhard von Liewen and Sigrid Oxenstierna af Croneborg and in 1708 married count Gustaf Bonde (1682-1764). As maid of honor to Princess Hedvig Sophia of Sweden in 1708, she was a part of the group at court who attempted to exile the influential Juliana Schierberg. Charlotta von Liewen is described as a person with a great informal power position within Swedish politics. She is known to have played a part in the traitor process against Georg Heinrich von Görtz and count Gerhard von Dernath in 1718. They were both loyalists of the Holstein Party, as was her. Charlotta von Liewen managed to arrange a meeting between Dernath, who was supposed to be imprisoned, and Dankwardt, one of the commission's members. Dankwardt refused to accept bribes from Dernath. Charlotta von Liewen then had queen Ulrika Eleonora of Sweden fire Dankwardt, after which Dernath was freed. Charlotta von Liewen is also confirmed to have been an agent of the French ambassador, Charles Louis de Biaudos de Casteja, who was known for his network of agents during his tenure in Sweden, especially female ones, such as Margareta Gyllenstierna and Hedvig Catharina Lillie. Casteja reported that France could use her influence over her spouse by feeding her ambitions for his career. In 1731, Casteja aided her in acquiring an advancement for her spouse, her son, who was in French service, was appointed capten for the French regiment Comte de Saxe and she herself was given a pair of diamond earrings by order of Louis XV of France. She was not the only woman in Sweden to collaborate as an agent for France, but the dealings between Lieven and Casteja was more clearly documented than most. After her death, the French ambassador reported that Bonde could no longer be expected to act for French interests, for although his next spouse also acquired influence over his policy, she was no friend of France."

  "text" : "Charles Sumner Woolworth (August 1, 1856 – January 7, 1947), was an American entrepreneur who went by the nickname of \"Sum\", opened and managed the world's first five-and-dime store in Scranton, Pennsylvania, and was founder of the \"C. S. Woolworth & Co\" chain of 5¢ & 10¢ stores. Sum's brother, Frank Winfield Woolworth was first to venture into the retail business with his own store, and soon after, he asked Sum to join him. Frank founded \"F. W. Woolworth & Co\", which later merged with other Woolworth affiliate stores to be the F. W. Woolworth Company. After the death of his brother, Sum became the longest serving Chairman of the F. W. Woolworth Company. During the early years, Sum also partnered with a long-time friend, Fred Kirby, to open a \"Woolworth and Kirby\" store in Wilkes Barre, Pennsylvania. When Fred bought out Sum's share, that store grew to become a \"friendly rival\" affiliate store, in close alliance with the two Woolworth brothers. In 1904, Sum and Frank Woolworth were affiliated with six (6) chains. Frank developed the back office side of the business. Sum developed the front of the business, pioneering self-service methods, customer service, training new managers, brightly lit stores, and frequently-changed window displays to lure customers inside. In 1912 C. S. Woolworth & Co, with the other affiliated chains, merged 596 stores under the corporate name \"F. W. Woolworth Company\". After the death of his brother, Frank Winfield Woolworth, Charles Sumner Woolworth became the reluctant Chairman of the Board of F. W. Woolworth Company (now Foot Locker), for 25 years. As a philanthropist and business man, he was involved with several institutions and businesses in Scranton, Pennsylvania, and other areas."

  "text" : "Chris Jesty (born 1942) is a British author and cartographer who revised Alfred Wainwright's Pictorial Guide to the Lakeland Fells to produce the second edition (2005-2009) of the books, which were originally published in 1955-1966. He used GPS to survey all the routes and the work involved 3,000 hand-drawn changes in the first volume alone, reflecting changes such as walls having fallen down or a quarry being opened on the line of a footpath, and adding information such as car parking. Jesty had earlier lived in Dolgellau, north Wales, and in the 1970s produced and published a panorama of the view from Snowdon, available as a single sheet or in four sections. In 1978 he published a panorama of the view from Scafell Pike with illustrations by Wainwright. He then moved to Bridport in Dorset, where he wrote several books about that area before moving to Kendal in Cumbria. In 1979, he wrote to Wainwright offering to update the guides, but Wainwright replied that he did not want this done in his lifetime. In 1989, Wainwright agree that Jesty could update the guides, but after his death in 1991, when Jesty had worked on the project for 18 months, the guides were sold to Michael Joseph publishers who were not interested in the updates. Some time later the guides were transferred to Frances Lincoln Publishers and the decision was made to produce new editions, not only of the Pictorial Guide but also of several of Wainwright's other walking guides. The last two of these were published in April 2014. The publishers have announced that Clive Hutchby is working on the third edition of the Pictorial Guide, with the first volume, The Eastern Fells published in March 2015, followed by The Far Eastern Fells in October 2015."

  "text" : "Jean-Maurice Casimir Arvet-Touvet (1841–1913) was a French botanist born in Gières. His early botanical investigations involved species native to Dauphiné, publishing in 1871 Essai sur les plantes du Dauphiné. Subsequently, he devoted his energies to research of the genus Hieracium (hawkweed). With his friend, Marie Clément Gaston Gautier (1841–1911), he conducted studies of Hieracium found in the Pyrenees and the Iberian Peninsula. With Gautier he issued a 20 booklet exsiccatae of the genus. During the last few years of his life he was involved with publication of Hieraciorum praesertim Galliae et Hispaniae catalogus systematicus."

  "text" : "Chris McNulty (born 1953) is Australian-born jazz vocalist who is resident in the United States in the New York area. McNulty has collaborated and performed with many jazz greats, including (USA): Paul Bollenback, Mulgrew Miller, Gary Bartz, Gary Thomas, John Hicks, Billy Hart, Ugonna Okegwo, Matt Wilson, Marcus Gilmore, Montez Coleman, Gary Versace, David Budway, Peter Leitch, Ed Howard, John Di Martino, Rob Bargad, Tim Garland, Ingrid Jensen, Andrei Kondakov, Igor Butman, Tony Reedus and Anita Wardell to name a few. In Australia, Paul Grabowsky, Frank Di Sario, Mike Jordan, Graham Wood, Carl Mackey, Ben Vanderwaal, Andrew Dickeson, Steve Barry, Cameron Undy, Mat McMahon. As an educator, Chris has been invited to present clinics and workshops at Monash University (Melb), Griffith University (Bris), West Australian Academy of Performing Arts (WAAPA- Perth), Australian Institute of Music (AIM-Syd) and University of SA (Adelaide). McNulty's repertoire includes the great jazz standards, modern jazz classics and original compositions. She is noted for remaining faithful to the lyrical message of a jazz composition, while giving full vent to her own imaginative phrasings in jazz idiom. Chris McNulty's recordings include, notably, her 1990 Waltz for Debby album of song. Chris McNulty is the 2013 recipient of the Australian Bell Award for Best Australian Jazz Vocal Album for \"The Song That Sings You Here\" (Challenge Records). Chris McNulty’s seventh release, Eternal (Palmetto Records), finds her in collaboration with gifted orchestrator, Stephen Newcomb and pianist-arranger, John Di Martino. The result is an exquisite melding of chamber ensemble and jazz quintet. The carefully crafted repertoire put together as an homage to Chris’ late son, Sam, features unique treatments of classics such as Where Is Love, What Are You Doing the Rest of Your Life, Nature Boy and On A Clear Day. These tunes are re-imagined in new light by McNulty’s deft touch to connect powerfully with the core of each lyric.“Exquisite….McNulty applies poignant jazz chops to the vocal, while accomplishing the impossible, the expression of her story through song….making listeners rethink the meaning of why we love jazz. Eternal is both easy to love, and profoundly touching”–– 5 stars, All About Jazz NYC, July 2015\"McNulty has put all she has learned over half a lifetime of jazz singing and songwriting into this exquisite chamber jazz CD. A veteran performer on the international jazz scene, she has many gifts as a performer and a direct channel to the emotional core of a lyric. On this CD, McNulty bares her soul, and one doesn’t dare look away.\" — 4 1/2 stars, DownBeat, June 2015“ A musical triumph..” — Hot House, NYC, June 2015"

Drafted by Fremantle, Nettelbeck moved to Western Australia in 1995 and took part in Fremantle's first official fixture, an Ansett Cup match against St Kilda. He was unable however to make an appearance for Fremantle in the AFL and spent the season in the West Australian Football League, playing for East Perth. Melbourne selected Nettelbeck in the 1996 Pre-season Draft, with the second overall selection and he played 20 games for them in his first season. He was troubled by a shoulder injury in 1997 and played only reserves football in 1998. Nettelbeck attempted to join his fourth club, the Western Bulldogs, in 1999 but was badly injured during a pre-season intra-club match. After his retirement from the sport he became a sports agent."

  "text" : "Cees Stam (born 2 November 1945 in Koog aan de Zaan) is a former Dutch track cyclist and four-time world champion stayer. Cees Stam was almost exclusively active as a stayer and at six-day races. In 1968 he became Dutch champion amateur stayer, which feat he would repeat seven times, both as an amateur and as a professional (from 1971 on). In 1968 and 1969 he came in second at the UCI Motor-paced World Championships, but in 1970 he won his first (amateur) world title, with Joop Stakenburg as pacer. Stakenburg also paced him to a professional world championship in both 1973 and 1974, while in 1977 Stam won his fourth world champion paced by Bruno Walrave. Stam came in second in 1972, 1975 and 1976 and third in 1978 and 1979, so that he was on the podium for 8 consecutive years. He also won the European championships twice. In 1974, in the old Galgenwaard stadium in Utrecht, he set a world hour record cycling behind a motor with 82.998 kilometres. Stam started 48 six-day races, but did not win any of them. After his cycling career he was national coach of the Dutch stayers and worked as a manager of cycling clothing company AGU until his retirement in 2007. Cees Stam is the father of the racing cyclist Danny Stam. His former son-in-law Henk Havik is also a cyclist, as is his grandson Yoeri Havik and uncles Klaas and Willy Kwantes. In 2007, a book was published about him and his cycling family. In 2014 Stam suffered a serious crash when riding the derny in the 2014 edition of the Six Days of Amsterdam, which featured his grandson Yoeri Havik as a competitor. This crash ended his career as a pacer."

  "text" : "Clarissa Belknap Dixon (1851 in Hennepin, Illinois – 1916 in Menlo Park, California) was a labor activist, feminist, and bohemian author and poet who lived in Des Moines, Iowa, New York City, Collyer, Kansas, and Menlo Park, California. She married Harry Cowell, a writer and printer, gave birth to their son Henry Cowell at age 45 in 1897, and divorced Harry in 1903. Clarissa Dixon's friendships included the writer Jack London during her time among San Francisco bohemians from the early 1890s until 1916. Her only published book is Janet and Her Dear Phebe from 1909, which the New York Times characterized as \"a very intense sort of a love story in which the lovers are two little girls who are devoted to each other with that fervency known only to feminine childhood.\" Marion Zimmer Bradley more recently described the book as a\"Girls story of two loving little chums, separated by a misunderstanding between their families, and reunited as women. Though never explicit, the story is emotional and intense. It is highly unlikely the author was quite aware of the type of attachment she was portraying.\" In 1914, Clarissa Dixon began a typescript manuscript of biographical details of composer Henry Cowell's early life, which she completed before her death from breast cancer in 1916."

A 5 ft 11 in (1.80 m), 185 lb (84 kg) left-handed pitcher during his playing days, Kniffin was selected by the Philadelphia Phillies in the 25th round of the 1969 Major League Baseball draft out of Nassau Community College. He pitched for ten seasons in the Phillie farm system, compiling a 55–40 record in 244 appearances. He then was out of baseball from 1979–1987 before becoming a pitching coach at the minor league level in the Seattle Mariners' organization. He switched to the Montreal Expos' organization in the early 1990s, then to the Diamondbacks' farm system when that expansion team began play in 1998, serving such teams as the Harrisburg Senators, Ottawa Lynx and Tucson Sidewinders. Kniffin succeeded Bob Welch as pitching coach of the defending 2001 World Series champion Diamondbacks in 2002, when Arizona won 98 games and the National League West Division title before falling in the Division Series. He worked on Brenly's staff until July 3, 2004, when both he and Brenly were fired in the midst of the rebuilding D-Back's disastrous 51–111 season. Kniffin then served as pitching coach of the Triple-A Colorado Springs Sky Sox from 2006–2009 until his retirement at the close of the 2009 minor league season."

  "text" : "Carl Christian Gottsche (1 March 1855, Altona – 11 October 1909) was a German geologist. He is known for geological investigations of Schleswig-Holstein and neighboring regions. He studied geology at the Universities of Würzburg and Munich, obtaining his doctorate in 1878 with a thesis on Jurassic fossils from the Argentine Cordillera. In 1880 he became an assistant at the mineralogical institute in Kiel, receiving his habilitation the same year with a dissertation on sedimentary-drift in the Province of Schleswig-Holstein. In 1881 he relocated to Japan, where he was tasked with completing the establishment of a mineralogical-geological institute at the University of Tokyo. At the university he also gave lectures. For much of 1884 he conducted research in Korea, afterwards returning to Germany, where in 1886 he was appointed curator of the mineralogical-geological department of the Natural History Museum in Hamburg. In 1900 he attained the title of professor, later becoming director of the mineralogical-geological institute (1907). He was the son of botanist Carl Moritz Gottsche (1808-1892)."

  "text" : "Sir Charles Frederick William Illingworth (8 May 1899 – 23 February 1991) was a British surgeon who specialised in gastroenterology. Along with a range of teaching and research interests, he wrote several surgical textbooks, and played a leading role in university and medical administration. Born in West Yorkshire, he served as a fighter pilot in the First World War before resuming medical studies in Edinburgh. After working and teaching in the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh in the 1920s and 1930s, Illingworth was appointed Regius Professor of Surgery, Glasgow, in 1939. Over the next 25 years, he established the Glasgow School of surgery, with generations of his students influencing surgical research and teaching in Britain and abroad. His textbooks were also highly influential, including his co-authorship of Text Book of Surgical Pathology (1932). Illingworth travelled and lectured widely, and helped initiate and present a 1963 television series on postgraduate medical training. His research included early work in the 1960s on hyperbaric oxygen therapy. Illingworth's administrative and leadership roles included his Presidency of the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Glasgow (1962 to 1964) and Dean of Faculties at the University of Glasgow (1978 to 1981). His honours included a knighthood (1961), Honorary Surgeon to the Queen in Scotland (1961 to 1965), and a range of honorary degrees. Honorary fellowships included those conferred by the Royal College of Surgeons of England, the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, and the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada. For his devotion to surgical science, Illingworth was awarded the 1964 Lister Medal. In retirement, Illingworth wrote biographies of William Hunter and Hector Hetherington. He also helped establish the charity Tenovus-Scotland in 1967, and was awarded the Nuffield Trust's Rock Carling Fellowship for 1970. Portraits of Illingworth by Alberto Morrocco are held at the Hunterian Museum and Art Gallery and the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Glasgow, and the annual Illingworth Prize for medical students is administered by the University of Glasgow. Illingworth's autobiography, There is a History in All Men's Lives, was published in 1988."

Her circumnavigation on a 1990 BMW R100RT motorcycle was accomplished in one year, beginning in August 2008. She was riding pillion with her partner Bernard Smith. While on this journey she also became the first blind person to reach the summit of Wayna Picchu. Birchall has been completely blind since her late twenties due to retinitis pigmentosa and was in her fifties during the trip. Birchall and her partner both kept journals during the trip and eventually wrote a book about their journey titled Touching The World: A Blind Woman, Two Wheels and 25,000 Miles. The trip actually covered 26,385 miles, as well asthirty-one countries and five continents. They were married on August 20th 2012 after Cathy was diagnosed with terminal cancer. Unknown to them, it turned out to be the same day their story was published after the publisher decided to bring the publication date forward. Their story is available in Print, Ebook, and Audio book versions. Birchall and her husband are originally from Warrington, Cheshire, which is in England. Birchall died of cancer on January 31, 2013."

Van der Velde attended the Naval Academy in Medemblik and became Lieutenant-sea second class. From 1830-1841 he worked at the topographical office in modern-day Jakarta where he eventually became director. In 1844 he had to return to Europe for health reasons, where he carried out cartographic, geographic and ethnographic work and was also employed as a draftsman, and missionary nurse. In 1844, on his return to Europe, he visited Ceylon, the Transvaal and Cape of Good Hope, where he supported the work of missions and for his services provided to French ships, was awarded a Legion of Honour. In 1851 Van de Velde visited Palestine, where he carried out various surveys, drawings, paintings and around one hundred watercolours for postcards. After his trip, he held lectures on Palestine in Geneva and Lausanne. On 13 March 1864, van de Velde was one of the first delegates from the newly formed International Committee of the Red Cross to act as an impartial intermediary in the Second Schleswig War. He assisted the wounded and captured Prussian and Austrian soldiers and helped establish the Red Cross as a relief organization in the 1863 conference resolutions. On 31 July 1867, Van de Velde was made an honorary member of the main Committee of the Red Cross, which included Willem Jan Knoop and Henri Dunant."

He later edited the music newspaper Top Pops. However, he always had- in his words- \"this feeling that I would like to write comedy\", starting in this area with contributions to the BBC Radio 4 show Week Ending. Bostock-Smith has contributed to a significant number of British television comedies. In a 2008 interview, he noted that he was the sole writer of all 41 episodes of the early-1980s ITV sitcom Metal Mickey, and claims to be most proud of his work on Not the Nine O'Clock News and the sitcom Me and My Girl."

He spent some years in partnership with Cory, but most of his career was in single-handed practice. From about 1902 he also had an office in London. Ferguson's output included new churches, restoration of existing churches, and work on country houses and public buildings. The architectural styles he used were mainly Gothic and Norman Revival. Almost all his works are in what is now Cumbria, with a few isolated commissions elsewhere. The latter were obtained through personal contacts, for example his work for William Armstrong at Bamburgh Castle, Northumberland, and for J. J. Bibby of the Bibby Line in Shropshire. In the Buildings of England series Ferguson is described as being \"a resourceful as well as a sensitive architect\"."

She began drawing when she was a child, mostly portraits with Dr. Atl noticing her talent. She did not have extensive formal training but became an art teacher, meeting a number of contemporary Mexican artists, including her husband Gustavo Montoya. After a time in Paris and New York, she returned to Mexico permanently in 1950 to dedicate herself to painting, exhibiting extensively in Mexico and abroad mostly in the 1950s and 1960s.

  "text" : "Chris Avram (born Cristea Auran, August 31, 1931, Bucharest – January 10, 1989, Rome, Italy) was a Romanian-Italian film actor. Known in Romania as Cristea Avram, he was born into a family of true communist believers (his father being an active member of the Romanian Communist Party while it was still banned, and his brother, Puiu, was a Communist activist). In his youth, he attended a military school, after which he studied law for two years in university, before being admitted to the Academy of Theatrical Arts and Cinematography. After graduation, he worked for a while as a theater actor in Timişoara, before joining the Nottara Theater in Bucharest. At a film festival in Moscow, he befriended Marina Vlady, who later went to Romania to star in Mona, l'étoile sans nom, directed by Henri Colpi. With her help, he managed to flee to Paris in 1966, where he remained. Later he settled down in Italy, where he died of cancer. He was married for a while to Romanian actress Olga Tudorache, with whom he had a son, Alexandru."

  "text" : "Clement Fitzleones (died c. 1509) was an Irish lawyer and judge. He held the offices of Serjeant-at-law (Ireland) and Attorney-General for Ireland and was briefly Deputy to the Chief Baron of the Irish Exchequer. Neither Ball nor Hart give any details of his family, but there was a prominent merchant family of that name in Dublin in the late fifteenth century; its most notable member was Patrick Fitzleones, Lord Mayor of Dublin 1477-1478, 1482-1483 and 1494-1495. Patrick was clearly a man of wealth and social standing, who married his daughter Margaret to  John Barnewall, 3rd Baron Trimlestown, Lord Chancellor of Ireland. If Clement belonged to this family he was presumably the Clement Fitzleones who was elected one of the Constables of Dublin in 1493. In 1493 he was Deputy to the Lord Chief Baron. According to Elrington Ball the practice of appointing Deputies had begun ten years earlier with the appointment of Oliver FitzEustace, a natural son of Rowland FitzEustace, 1st Baron Portlester as Chief Baron. Oliver, who owed his appointment solely to his father's great influence, was not only lacking in legal training but apparently mentally deficient and incapable of speech. In 1502 Fitzleones was Attorney General and in 1506 he was promoted to what was then the senior office of King's Serjeant. In 1509 Patrick Finglas was appointed Serjeant; while two serjeants occasionally acted at the same time, as a rule there was only one, which suggests that Fitzleoenes had recently died."

  "text" : "Christian Friedrich Schwan (12 December 1733, Prenzlau – 29 June 1815, Heidelberg) was a German publisher and bookseller. After studies of theology in Halle and Jena, he worked as a proofreader at the Academy in St. Petersburg. In 1762 he was a legal assistant in the regiment of Prince Georg von Holstein-Gottorp, later working in the Netherlands, where he published Anecdotes russes ou lettres d'un officier anglais. In 1764 he started a weekly literary journal in Frankfurt am Main. In 1765 he became manager of a bookstore in Mannheim that was owned by his father-in-law. In Mannheim he established its \"state theatre\", and in doing so, played an active role in theatrical affairs. Schwan's bookstore and home were centers of literary life in Mannheim, where luminaries such as Lessing, Wieland, Herder, Goethe, Lenz, Schubart and Schiller were occasional visitors. In April 1785, Schiller made a proposal of marriage for Schwan's eldest daughter, Margarethe. To avoid the distractions of war, he left Mannheim in 1794, taking up residency in Heilbronn, then in Stuttgart, and finally in Heidelberg. Among his literary works was the publication of numerous French-German dictionaries. Other works attributed to Schwan include: \n*  Russische Anekdoten von der Regierung und Tod Peters des Dritten, 1764 \n*  Histoire et anecdotes de la vie, du règne, du détrônement & de la mort de Pierre III ... Ecrites en forme de lettres, publiées par Mr. de la Marche, 1766 \n*  Abbildungen der vorzüglichsten geistlichenorden in ihren gewöhnlichsten ordenskleidungen, 1791. \n*  Works about Christian Friedrich Schwan: \n*  Christian Friedrich Schwan, Kurfürstlicher Hofbuchhändler zu Mannheim : 1733-1815 by Rudi Dorsch, 1991."

He was appointed Companion of the Order of St. Michael and St. George for his work in the latter capacity. He was High Commissioner to Papua New Guinea in Port Moresby from 1997-2000. Telegrams of his reports on Conservative Party treasurer Michael Ashcroft in Belize and Turks and Caicos Islands, written in early 1997, were published in The Times in July 1999. Drace-Francis claimed that Ashcroft had \"threatened over breakfast to stir up trouble for Britain in the Turks and Caicos Islands unless he was helped to break into the islands' banking business.\" As a result of this the Foreign Office's Permanent Under Secretary John Kerr initiated an inquiry with the aim of identifying the source of the leak. The inquiry proved controversial, and Drace-Francis later resigned. As such he won the sympathy of his erstwhile antagonist Lord Ashcroft, who recognised him to be the victim of Whitehall machinations rather than the true source of the leak."

  "text" : "William J. (Chip) Walter Jr. (born May 23, 1951) is an American science writer, documentary filmmaker, journalist and screenwriter. He was one of the original employees at Cable News Network when it went on the air June 1, 1980 and later became its youngest bureau chief when he created CNN's first Southeast Bureau before heading up the network's San Francisco Bureau. He has written and produced several PBS science documentaries, served as an adjunct professor at Carnegie Mellon University in three different departments, worked with UNICEF on the issue of childhood trauma, spoken at Harvard, Xerox PARC, Carnegie Mellon University and the Chautauqua Institution. One of his three original screenplays was produced and released under the title Sunset Grill in 1993 starring Peter Weller, Lori Singer and Stacy Keach. In 2015 his feature story for National Geographic Magazine explored the origins of human art and symbolic thinking. After departing CNN Walter wrote and produced several award winning documentaries for PBS including two programs for the Emmy Award winning science series Planet Earth (1986) and another for Infinite Voyage (1986-1989 series), the first PBS series to air on both public and commercial television. He also wrote and produced a college-credit tele course which followed the Planet Earth series. His program \"Fires of the Mind,\" was the first show publicly premiered for the Infinite Voyage series. It dealt with the evolution of human intelligence and creativity, themes Walter has returned to many times in his work. Variety called the documentary \"Handsomely produced, beautifully written...a fascinating hour.\" The Village Voice wrote that it delivered \" a sense of human accomplishment, which is the true ambition of science on the air.\" Beginning in 1989, Walter developed a new series for WQED entitled Space Age to celebrate the International Space Year in 1992, the quincentenary of Christopher Columbus's voyage to the New World in 1492. The multimillion-dollar six part series, which was PBS's primetime series in the fall of 1992, was hosted by Patrick Stewart. Walter went on to write the series' companion book by the same title published by Random House in 1992 under the name William J. Walter Jr. The Houston Post called the book \"lucid, well-written and well thought out.\" Following forays into Hollywood screenwriting and digital media in the early and mid-1990's, Walter wrote his next book in collaboration with William Shatner, well known for his iconic role as Captain Kirk in the original Star Trek television series, and then later in a series of Star Trek movies. The book explored the many ways that the technologies predicted in the Star Trek series, like handheld communicators, virtual reality, wearable computers, humanlike robots and radical life extension were becoming a reality two hundred years before the 23rd century in which the series was set. The book combined reminiscences and history of the original series with explorations of advanced technologies being developed at MIT, Carnegie Mellon University, Xerox PARC, Kurzweil Technologies and as part of the Human Genome Project. Walter knew Carnegie Mellon University professor Randy Pausch and arranged to visit Pausch's lab as part of the book's research. His work was featured in the book's chapter on the Holodeck and virtual reality. Pausch later credited Walter with fulfilling one of his lifelong dreams—meeting Captain Kirk, when he gave his famous \"Last Lecture\" before passing away in 2008 from pancreatic cancer. He has also served on the faculty at Carnegie Mellon University at the Mellon Institute of Science, the School of Fine Arts and the Entertainment Technology Center at the School of Computer Science. In 1994 he pioneered early children's learning games with the launch of Digital Alchemy. The company later created the first GeoBee learning game for the National Geographic Society. Walter has published four mainstream science books on a wide variety of subjects. His 2006 book, Thumbs, Toes and Tears–And Other Traits That Make Us Human was translated into five languages. \"Last Ape Standing\" has been published into three non-English languages, Chinese, Japanese and Spanish. He has written for a variety of national and international publications including National Geographic Magazine, The Economist, Slate, The Wall Street Journal, Scientific American, Scientific American Mind, Discover, and many others."

The Leuvuches were in fact called Serranos (people from the hills) by the Spaniards. In 1751, Cangapol and his warriors expelled the Jesuits from Laguna de los Padres and destroyed the settlement built by them five years before. In 1753, he became an allied of the Spaniards against the Mapuches, who used to take profit of the Leuvuches' plunder raids north of the Salado river and then sought safe haven in Chile, leaving the Leuvuches to face the Spanish retaliation alone. He died the same year and was succeeded by his son Nicolás."

  "text" : "Charles H. Ruth (1889–1949) was considered the founding father of the Army Map Service. Ruth was first commanding officer of the Army Engineer Reproduction Plant (ERP). Prior to 1917 the Army Corps of Engineers compiled and drafted maps. Reproduction was accomplished by the Department of the Interior or commercial facilities. The ERP was the predecessor organization to the Army Map Service, Army Topographic Command, Defense Mapping Agency and now National Geospatial Intelligence Agency. Before 1917, there was little concern or interest in the United States for maps of foreign countries. In 1917 America entered into World War I as a major ally in Europe. During the course of the conflict, the ERP produced some nine million maps. It was because of Captain Ruth’s initial direction that the ERP became one of the major military topographic organizations in the world. Captain Ruth left the Army in 1919 and joined the Washington Evening Star newspaper staff in Washington DC. In 1942 the ERP was moved from Fort McNair in Washington DC to Brookmont, MD. It was later redesigned as the Army Map Service. Captain Ruth died in 1949. Building #1 of the AMS was dedicated as the Ruth Building in 1953."

  "text" : "Conrad Hoffmann, Jr. (September 16, 1884 – August 12, 1958) was an American Christian missionary who aided war prisoners, European university students, and war refugees during both World Wars. Hoffmann was born in Chicago, on September 16, 1884. He graduated from the University of Wisconsin in 1906, and received a PhD. from the same institution in 1910. He married Louise R. Bischoff in 1911, and they had one daughter and two sons. Long affiliated with John R. Mott and the American YMCA, Hoffmann served as the Senior Secretary of the War Prisoners’ Aid in Germany from 1915 to 1919. While in Germany, he also served as a member of the German National Committee  and coordinated the relief efforts of the International Red Cross, under the direction of Princess Margaret of Connaught, the Crown Princess of Sweden. Hoffmann acquired camp visitation privileges, allowing him to interact directly with prisoners. He remained in Berlin after the United States broke diplomatic relations in February 1917, to ensure the continuation of reciprocal prisoner-of-war work. Despite the political upheavals in Germany, Hoffmann continued to work until his departure in June 1919. After World War I, he accompanied the repatriation of Russian prisoners, working with the League of Nations and Fridtjof Nansen, the League's High Commissioner for Refugees. In 1920, he became the Executive Secretary of the European Student Relief under the auspices of the World Student Christian Federation (WSCF) in Geneva, Switzerland . He raised funds for needy university students in Soviet Russia and eighteen other countries. In 1922, he received an honorary degree from Karl Franzens University in [Graz, Austria, for his efforts as the Executive Director of the European Student Relief. In 1926, Tübingen University in Germany granted him an honorary Ph.D. in Economics, in recognition of his work on behalf of university students. Hoffmann recognized the increase in anti-Semitism and turned his attention to promoting better understanding between Christians and Jews. In 1930, the International Missionary Council appointed him head of its committee on the Christian Approach to the Jews. In 1936, the Board of National Missions of the Presbyterian Church appointed him Secretary-in-Charge of Jewish Work. During World War II, he worked with German POWs and the YMCA's War Prisoners' Aid of Canada. Following the war, he helped relocate hundreds of refugees to the United States."

  "text" : "Charles Leslie (1839–1886) was an English landscape painter during the Victorian era, and a member of the Williams family of painters. Charles Leslie was born Charles Edward John Leslie on 27 November 1839 in the Pentonville Road area of the Islington borough of London. He was the son of Emily Ann Williams and Charles Leslie, senior. His grandfather Edward Williams (1781–1855) was a well-known landscape painter, and the father of six sons, all artists, who collectively are referred to as the Williams family of painters. The younger Charles learned to paint from his uncles, especially George Augustus Williams, whom he lived with in 1856 and 1857 at 32 Castelnau Villas in Barnes at a time when Leslie was already exhibiting works at the Royal Academy. Leslie is not to be confused with the much better-known painter Charles Robert Leslie, RA, the father of George Dunlop Leslie, RA. The lesser-known Charles Leslie was one of the first Victorian landscape artists to portray scenes of the Scottish and Welsh moorlands, and became one of the better-known painters of these themes. His landscapes often feature stark mountains in the background towering over still waters with open skies above. Leslie exhibited at the Royal Academy (5 works), the British Institution (3 works), the Suffolk Street Gallery of the Society of British Artists (16 works), and exhibited in many lesser-known Victorian art venues as well. He died of liver disease at the age of 46 on 9 September 1886 at Mitcham Road Tooting near Wandsworth, Surrey. British museums with examples of his work include the National Library of Wales, the Royal Holloway Museum at the University of London and the Victoria Museum and Gallery in Liverpool. One of his landscapes is also on view at the Museum Geelvinck Hinlopen Huis in Amsterdam in the Netherlands."

At the time there was great scientific rivalry between the French, British, Germans, Russians and Japanese in the area. Pelliot, accompanied by Nouette as official photographer and Louis Vaillant as expedition doctor, set out from St Petersburg on 17 June 1906 and proceeded via Bokhara, Kashgar, Ürümqi and Turfan, before eventually reaching Peking in the summer of 1909. In March 1908 the expedition visited Dunhuang. The numerous cave manuscripts that were purchased and subsequently studied by Pelliot are now kept in the National Library of France, the Bibliothèque nationale. Nouette's photographs of the exhibition are preserved in the collection of the Musée Guimet, the French National Museum of Asiatic Art, in Paris."

  "text" : "Charlotte Hodes is a British artist. Charlotte Hodes (born 1959 London) is a Fine Artist living and working in London. She completed a Foundation course at Brighton College of Art (1977–78), studied Fine Art as an undergraduate student (1978–82) and Painting as a postgraduate student (1982–84) at the Slade School of Fine Art, University College, University of London. At the Slade School under the Professorship of Lawrence Gowing, she was a student of Paula Rego, Stanley Jones and John Hoyland. Hodes’ practice is informed by her experience as a painter and is investigated through large scale papercuts which have been both digitally collaged and intricately hand cut, as well as ornately decorated ceramic vessels, tableware and glass. Her iconography is centred on the female figure within a contemporary context depicted as a silhouette juxtaposed with motifs loaded with female associated references such as the vessel and skirt. Her work questions hierarchies of the female figure as represented in art history, as a decorative motif and as being inextricably linked to the domestic. She draws upon the decorative and applied arts, fashion and costume, often using archives and collections as a source for projects. Hodes is the only contemporary artist to have been invited to work as an artist at the celebrated ceramic factory Spode (1998–2003). In 2005 she was appointed the first Associate Artist at The Wallace Collection culminating in her solo exhibition ‘ Fragmented Images’ at the museum in 2007. In 2006 she was awarded the Jerwood Drawing Prize and in 2009 held a solo exhibition at Marlborough Fine Art She has participated in many group exhibitions both nationally and internationally including ‘Digital Responses’ Victoria and Albert Museum 2003, ‘Somewhere Totally Else’ Design Biennial, Design Museum London 2003, ‘Glasstress’ Palazzo Cavalli Franchetti 53rdInternational Venice Biennale 2009, ‘Inscription: Thinking/Drawing/Making’ Jerwood Space Gallery London 2010 and in 2012 featured in an exhibition at No.10 Downing Street curated by Janice Blackburn. Hodes has collaborated with a number of studios and industry including Spode, Park Rose Ceramics Yorkshire, Centre for Fine Art Print, University of West of England, National Glass Centre University of Sunderland, Berengo Studio, Murano and Venice Projects Italy. Hodes’ work is represented in many public collections including the Victoria and Albert Museum, British Council and Brighton Museum & Art Gallery. She has lectured at numerous colleges in the UK and in 2006 joined the research department at London College of Fashion, University of the Arts London where she was appointed Professor in Fine Art in 2012. Hodes founded the Culford Press in 1985 with her husband, the sculptor and printmaker Paul Coldwell at their home in Hackney. She is the daughter of the landscape painter, Joan Hodes who studied at the Slade School (1945–1948) and was a pupil of Oscar Kokoschka."

  "text" : "Charles Newton \"Charlie\" Cooper (14 October 1893 – 2 October 1964) was a British motorsport mechanic, designer and entrepreneur. With his son John Cooper he founded the Cooper Car Company, which produced a string of successful racing cars through the 1950s and '60s. While John provided the enthusiasm and vigour that drove the Cooper company forward, it was Charles' shrewd business brain that provided the stability – and profitability – that laid the foundation for their sporting success. Regular works driver Jack Brabham won the World Drivers' Championship in both the 1959 and 1960 Formula One seasons driving the Coopers' revolutionary mid-engined cars, and the Cooper team itself took the World Constructors' Championships. Although they never again achieved the heights of a World Championship, the Coopers' innovative vehicles left a lasting influence on racing car design. Before 1959 all Formula One World Champions had driven front-engined cars; since 1959 no front-engined car has won the World Championship again."

Caroline Fanny Williams was born on 25 December 1836 in St. Marylebone, London. Her father George Augustus Williams (1814-1901) was a popular landscape artist and a member of the Williams family of painters. She learned to paint from her father, and her works are somewhat similar to his in subject and treatment, but with much brighter colors. Her technical ability was the equal or better to that of many of her male counterparts of the time, but despite the support of her father, she lived in an age where society did not encourage women in the arts. She exhibited at the Royal Academy (12 works), the British Institution (19 works), the Suffolk Street Gallery of the Society of British Artists (64 works), and exhibited in many lesser-known Victorian art venues as well, especially the Society of Lady Artists where she was a regular contributor. She never married, and died under her maiden name on 30 December 1921 at Forest Hill, London. Three examples of her work are on display at the Reading Museum & Town Hall in Berkshire."

Djurov's father, Dobri Djurov, was a high-ranked military official, who between 1962 and 1990 served as the Defense Minister of Bulgaria. Chavdar Djurov studied at the Georgi Benkovski Aviation School in Bulgaria, and then at the Zhukovsky Air Force Engineering Academy in the Soviet Union. In 1965, he set the world record in parachute night jump, together with Georgi Filipov and Hinko Iliev. The record was registered; however, the International Aeronautics Federation decided that such jumps are too dangerous and prohibited them, which is why the record still stands. In 1977, Djurov was a candidate to become the first Bulgarian astronaut, but was killed, together with Ventseslav Yotov, during the trial flight on an L-29."

  "text" : "Cyril Henry Barraud (1877-1965) was a British artist. He was the son of Herbert Rose Barraud and nephew of Francis Barraud. After education at Downside School, he trained at Brighton School of Art and then worked as a manager at his father's photographic business before becoming a full-time artist. He was close to Francis Barraud and helped him with the final version of \"His Master's Voice\". His principal medium was etching. He taught Canadian artist Walter J. Phillips etching skills. He exhibited at the Royal Academy between 1912 and 1924. His work covers landscapes in Suffolk, Essex, Kent, the Thames Estuary and Rye. He also painted and etched: \n*  London street-scenes, \n*  popular destinations close to the LNER to be used as carriage prints, \n*  cathedrals, \n*  churches, \n*  industrial buildings (notably interiors of Dunston Power Station), \n*  illustrations \n*  Christmas Cards. During the First World War he served with The Artists' Rifles and was commissioned in the The Queen's Own Cameron Highlanders of Canada (43 Battalion) and, after being wounded in the left leg, was posted to the Canadian War Office as an official war artist. He was married twice, first to Gladys Seanor (two children) and, after her death, to Evelyn Dixon."

His work was acknowledged when in 1999 he was inducted into the AMA Motorcycle Hall of Fame. His Vetter Fairing Company created aftermarket motorcycle fairings in the 1970s before manufacturers themselves included fairings on their products. The product has been cited as once being so ubiquitous that the term \"Windjammer\" was interchangeable with \"fairing\". The company at one time was the second largest motorcycle industry manufacturer in the United States, behind only Harley-Davidson. He founded Equalizer Corp and his innovative human powered design won the Boston Marathon wheelchair class in 1982. In 1998, Vetter’s design for the British Triumph Hurricane was selected to be in the Guggenheim Museum's The Art of the Motorcycle exhibit which toured the world, and has since become a cult icon and much-valued collectors' item among owners' groups."

  "text" : "Charles J. Hanlon (September 15, 1918 – September 9, 1990) was the first independent member of the U.S. state of Oregon's legislature elected in 50 years, and the fifth in Oregon history. He served three terms in the Oregon Senate, from 1976 to 1986. He became a Democrat after his first election, in which he defeated the then-Senate Majority Leader, Democrat William Holmstrom. The Oregonian's obituary stated that he was known for his independence throughout his career, noting his opposition to the timber industry's influence on forest management and, specifically, the Oregon Board of Forestry, and his efforts to legalize self-service gasoline in the state. In 1977, he proposed an amendment to the state constitution that would have added two years to House and Senate terms, and imposed a term limit of 12 years. Hanlon was also noted for his constituent services, including a successful effort to force a state barber's licensing board to administer an oral exam to an illiterate barber."

  "text" : "Carl Wilhelm Rubenson (30 July 1885 – 29 July 1960) was a Swedish-born Norwegian mountaineer and non-fiction writer. In 1906 he made several first ascents in Jotunheimen, together with Ferdinand Schjelderup and Agnes Jachelln. In 1907 he reached a record height of 7,270 m at the Himalayan mountain Kabru, together with Ingvald Monrad Aas, the highest altitude anybody had reached until then. He co-founded the Norwegian mountaineering club Norsk Tindeklub in 1908, together with Alf Bryn, Ferdinand Schjelderup, Henning Tønsberg and others. He made the first ascent of the Norwegian mountain Stetind in 1910, together with Alf Bonnevie Bryn and Ferdinand Schjelderup. The three climbers reached the top of Stetind on 30 July 1910, on Rubenson's 25th birthday. This was the first of a number of first ascents to follow the next two weeks in Northern Norway. On 1 August Rubenson, Bryn and Schjelderup made the first ascent of Svolværgeita, on the Lofoten island of Austvågøy. Their route is called 1910 Ruta, or in English: The 1910 Route. This route includes a famous diagonal traverse across the north wall of the mountain, which was led by Rubinson. The group reached the top by 11 pm on 1 August. On 3 August 1910 the same group climbed Trakta on Northern Austvågøy, a mountain considered among the hardest summits to reach in Norway. Also this was a first ascent, where they climbed the main summit (Vestre Trakta) via the Northwest Ridge. Rubenson was part of the group that first attempted a winter ascent of Store Skagastølstind, but this attempt failed because of harsh snow conditions and risk of avalanches. Among Rubenson's books are Fjeldsport før og nu and Med telt og husbaat i Kashmir, both from 1923. He was awarded honorary membership of both the British Alpine Club and Norsk Tindeklub."

  "text" : "Chit Khine (Burmese: ချစ်ခိုင်, born 1948 in Danubyu Township, Irrawaddy Division, Burma) is one of Burma's richest business tycoons with an estimated net worth of US$3.2 billion, which includes his assets in Myanmar. He is also considered to be among the Burma's elite. He is the president of Eden Group, one of Myanmar's largest and most successful conglomerates. He also serves as a director and largest shareholder of Asia General Electric (AGE), founded in 2008 to manufacture transformers and electrical switches. Alongside his success, Chit Khine has done many various types of charity work and also donated several millions into the community of Myanmar. He is well-known for his close relationship with the former ruling junta, the State Peace and Development Council. He is believed to have funded the wedding of Thandar Shwe, Than Shwe's daughter. Eden Group was one of the only 8 indigenous companies to construct Naypyidaw, the country's new capital. In exchange, the Burmese government granted Eden Group several highly coveted licenses to import high-end automobiles into the country and it can also be seen that Chit Khine has also amassed great wealth from his role in the construction of Naypyidaw. Chit Khine is also known for his close links to the government, having undertaken a huge range of construction projects in Nay Pyi Taw for the previous military regime. These include the President’s Palace, the Defence Services Museum, which honours the Myanmar armed forces, or Tatmadaw and many more. Chit Khine is subject to American economic sanctions. He was previously subject to EU sanctions but this has since been removed. In the early 1980s, he entered the restaurant business by opening Eden restaurant in Rangoon. He establsihed a construction company, Eden Group, in the mid-1990s. A few years after Eden Group was founded, Chit Khine started to open five-star hotels and resorts all over Myanmar. Chit Khine owns Delta United FC (now the Ayeyawady United F.C.), a football club in Ayewarwady Region. In 2010, Chit Khine, along with other government proxies, received preferential private banking licenses from the Central Bank of Myanmar. In 2011, he established Myanma Apex Bank (MAB), one of the country's few private banks with $411,387,430 worth of total assets as of 2013 as quoted by the GIZ report. Chit Khine serves as the head of the Myanmar Rowing and Canoeing Federation (MRCF), the Myanmar Agribusiness Public Corporation and the Myanmar Rice Industry Association (MRIA)."

  "text" : "Claudene Christian (October 18, 1970 – October 29, 2012) was an entrepreneur, sailor, gymnast, singer and beauty queen. Christian claimed to be a lineal descendant of Fletcher Christian, the leader of the mutiny on the Bounty, and one of founders of the occupation of Pitcairn Island.In August 2012 Christian was interviewed by the Halifax Chronicle Herald, after she joined the volunteer crew of a replica of the original HMS Bounty, built by MGM for a film about the mutiny. The vessel sailed into Hurricane Sandy on October 29, 2012.Fourteen members of the ship's complement were able to board a life raft and were saved.The Virginian-Pilot quoted United States Coast Guard Captain Joe Kelly, who described how Christian and the ship's captain Robin Walbridge were about to join the rest of the ship's complement in the life raft, when the Bounty rolled, plunging them into the ocean.However, according to later accounts from the survivors, they were all thrown into the water, and had desperately swum for one of the life rafts.Search and rescue crews from Coast Guard helicopters rescued the crew members from the life raft. When Christian was found, ten hours later, she was \"unresponsive\". Resuscitation was attempted, but she was pronounced dead in a shore-based hospital. Patrik Jonsson, writing in The Christian Science Monitor, citing the connection between Christian and her supposed great-great-great-great-great-grandfather, called her death \"an almost inexplicable twist on that family legacy.\""

She was the mother of writer Brenda Ueland, who wrote a biography of her later published as O Clouds, Unfold!. Clara Hampson was born on October 10, 1860 in Akron, Ohio. She married lawyer Andreas Ueland in 1885. The couple and their three eldest daughters moved into a sixteen-room house on the south shore of Lake Calhoun in 1891. Clara taught kindergarten in her home and worked to establish kindergartens in the schools of Minneapolis. Ueland travelled to Connecticut in 1920 as part of the \"Emergency Suffrage Corps'\" to protest Governor Marcus H. Holcomb's refusal to call a special session to ratify the suffrage amendment. In 1921, she was appointed chair of the Minneapolis fundraising committee for the Woodrow Wilson Foundation. She was presented the pen that Minnesota Governor Joseph A. A. Burnquist used when signing the presidential suffrage bill. In 1925, Ueland criticized Republican foreign policy and \"back-door\" cooperation with the League of Nations, saying \"We have got to spread the gospel among the women, telling them that they are paying too much for cotton and woolen goods, for aluminumware and that the country cannot recover from hard times unless we reduce the tariff.\" She died after being struck by a truck as she was crossing the street near her home on March 1, 1927."

Avery describes the topology, cosmology and inhabitants of this fictional territory, from the market of the main town Onomatopoeia to the Eternal Forest where an unknown beast called the Noumenon is held to reside. The project can be read as a meditation on some of the central themes of philosophy of art-making, and on the colonization and ownership of the world of ideas.

According to it, in 1173 Emperor Manuel sent Constantine to help defend Ancona in Italy, a Byzantine ally, against a combined attack from Holy Roman Emperor Frederick I Barbarossa and the Republic of Venice. The siege lasted for seven months, but Constantine successfully defended the city from capture. Subsequently he was sent as governor (doux) in Dalmatia and Dyrrhachium. He died of pleurisy at his home on 8 April 1179."

Afu was accused by his party of having accepted a bribe from Moscoso's government, while he in turn accused the party of accepting bribes en masse from the San Lorenzo consortium, a construction contractor. In February 2004, Moscoso appeared at the inauguration of a public works project, where she was photographed dancing with Afu. Electoral officials called for an investigation into her appearance, stating that it showed improper support for Afu's re-election campaign; Moscoso described their accusation as \"an abuse of power\"."

  "text" : "Charles Isaac Stevens (1835–1917) was the second patriarch of the Ancient British Church from 1889 to 1917 and also was primus of the Free Protestant Episcopal Church of England from 1900 to 1917. He was born on 28 November 1835 at Clerkenwell, London, to Isaac Thomas and Anna (née Morgan) Stevens and was baptised at the Parish Church of St Luke, London, on 5 June 1836. Stevens was a Reformed Episcopal Church of England presbyter until the year 1879. He was consecrated on 6 March 1879 by Richard Williams Morgan, of the Ancient British Church. He took the religious name Mar Theophilus I. According to the Anglican Free Communion, Order of Corporate Reunion (OCR) bishops assisted Morgan at the 6 March 1879 consecration. This is disputed, however, by Henry Brandreth who (writing in 1947) considered that \"it is very unlikely, however, that any of the OCR bishops performed a consecration\" of Stevens. On 4 May 1890, Stevens ordained Leon Chechemian (Mar Leon), bishop of the joint Free Protestant Church of England/United Armenian Catholic Church in the British Isles, as the Ancient British Church's archbishop of Selsey. On 2 November 1897, Chechemian, Stevens, and other bishops, founded the Free Protestant Episcopal Church with Chechemian as primus. Chechemian resigned as primus in 1900 and Stevens succeeded him in that office. In 1881 Stevens married Eliza Elizabeth Galloway at Islington, London. She died in 1900 in the Hackney district of London, where the Stevens had lived for many years and where the pro-cathedral of the Ancient British Church/Free Protestant Episcopal Church was located. Stevens died on 2 February 1917 in London. Stevens was an organist and the author of An Essay on the Theory of Music (Gottengen 1863)."

  "text" : "Colin Jenkins (born March 2, 1983 in Hamilton, Ontario) is a triathlete from Canada. He competed at the 2006 Commonwealth Games in Melbourne, and at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, along with his teammates Paul Tichelaar and Simon Whitfield. In his sporting career, Jenkins had won a silver medal at the 2006 ITU Pan American Cup in Brampton, Ontario, and achieved his first top eight finish at the 2007 ITU World Cup in Vancouver. Jenkins was selected to the Canadian triathlon team for the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, with a plan to designate him as Whitfield's \"domestique\" – someone who keeps his competitor close during the early phases of the game. In the men's event, he allowed his teammate Whitfield to maintain pace over the 1.5 km swim course, and repeatedly chased down the breakaways of the 40-km cycling race, with the latter drafting behind. Whitfield moved on to capture the silver medal at the end of the course. Jenkins, however, finished in last place, with the time of 1:56:50, just nearly eight minutes behind the former Olympic champion. His placement in the men's triathlon later became regarded as one of the greatest fiftieth-place finishes in Summer Olympic history, after playing a critical role in helping Canada win its second-ever Olympic medal. After the Olympics, Jenkins retired from triathlon to work as a firefighter in Toronto. In November 2010, he was elected to Triathlon Canada's Board of Directors by the organization's national elite athletes, and served his major role as an athlete's representative."

He was promoted to a senior role on the same series in 1995, before later moving to BBC Radio 5. Initially a producer for the breakfast programme, Thomas later became Head of News at Radio 5. He was subsequently appointed as the BBC's Editor of Newsgathering, before taking a year-long sabbatical to work as a Nieman Fellow in Journalism at Harvard University. On returning to the BBC in 2006 he became editor of Radio 4's Today, where he attracted controversy in 2010 after appearing to suggest the show was too tough an environment for women. In an interview shortly afterwards he said that the comments had been meant in the context of \"a wider news world in which women have not been well represented in senior positions\". In November 2012 Thomas was appointed Acting Deputy Director of News at the BBC after the then incumbent, Stephen Mitchell stepped aside in the wake of the controversy surrounding a report on the BBC Two current affairs programme Newsnight."
