  "text" : "Diane Wilson is an American environmental activist, anti-war activist, and author. In 1989 she was a shrimp boat captain in Calhoun County, Texas, and she saw an Associated Press article saying that the county had the most toxic waste disposal of all counties in America. Wilson began a campaign against Formosa Plastics, a Taiwanese chemical company then building a PVC (polyvinyl chloride) facility near her town, with tactics including several hunger strikes and sinking her own boat to draw attention to the matter. In 1994 she won \"zero discharge\" agreements (meaning no liquid effluent discharge into the environment) from Formosa and Alcoa. Wilson has also protested at meetings concerning the BP oil spill, as well as protesting in support of victims of the 1984 Bhopal, India, Union Carbide gas leak. She is a co-founder of the anti-war organization CODEPINK. In 2005 a documentary was made about her, titled Texas Gold.  It won several awards, including \"Best Documentary\" at the New York City Short Film Festival. She has received the \"Hellraiser of the Month\" award from Mother Jones magazine, and a number of other awards, including National Fisherman Magazine Award, Louis Gibbs' Environmental Lifetime Award, Louisiana Environmental Action (LEAN) Environmental Award, Giraffe Project, Jenifer Altman Award and the Bioneers Award. In 2006, she was honored with the Blue Planet Award from Ethecon Foundation, one of the comparatively very few 'grass-root' foundations for \"more than 20 years of commitment to environmental issues, even putting her life at risk.\" In 2013, Wilson participated in the movement to close Guantanamo Bay, calling for Obama to release the prisoners that had been declared for release, give the men a fair trial, and end indefinite detention. Most notably, she stood in solidarity with the hunger strikers by fasting on salt and water for 58 days. Her fast ended on June 26, 2013 on International Day in Support of Victims of Torture after jumping the White House fence at a Close Guantanamo protest (with groups including Amnesty International, CODEPINK, Veterans for Peace, and Witness Against Torture) in an attempt to deliver a letter to President Barack Obama. Wilson was charged with unlawful entry and handed over to local authorities."

  "text" : "David Joseph Schwartz (March 23, 1927 – December 6, 1987) was an American motivational writer and coach, best known for authoring The Magic of Thinking Big in 1959. He was a professor at Georgia State University. The late David Joseph Schwartz was a professor at Georgia State University, Atlanta, and was considered a leading American authority on motivation. He was also President of Creative Educational Services, a consulting firm specialising in leadership development. Starting from a one-room schoolhouse in rural Indiana, David J. Schwartz went on to become the president of his own company and lecturer to more than three thousand trade associations, sales groups and management seminars. He wrote his first phenomenal bestseller THE MAGIC OF THINKING BIG nearly thirty years ago. Millions of people throughout the world have improved their lives by reading books by Dr. David J. Schwartz, long regarded as one of the foremost experts on motivation, whose teachings will help you sell better, manage better, earn more money, and -- most important of all -- find greater happiness and peace of mind. In the course of researching his books Schwartz spoke to many people who had reached the top in their field. Instead of getting detailed responses, Schwartz was told that the key factor in personal success was simply the desire for it. Rather than being 'too many Chiefs and not enough Indians', the opposite is true. Some people choose to lead, others to follow. Success is not primarily a matter of circumstances or native talent or even intelligence - it is a choice. Thinking larger thoughts is a kind of magic, since the effort put in is small compared with the long-term results. In the 1890s, a person named Gottlieb Daimler drew a three-pointed star on a postcard to his family and wrote next to it, 'One day this star will shine down on my work.' He co-founded Mercedes-Benz. Great accomplishments such as these demonstrate Schwartz's claim that a person is best measured by the size of their dreams. Quotes: \"Believe Big. The size of your success is determined by the size of your belief. Think little goals and expect little achievements. Think big goals and win big success. Remember this, too! Big ideas and big plans are often easier -- certainly no more difficult - than small ideas and small plans.\" \"Remind yourself regularly that you are better than you think you are. Successful people are not superhuman. Success does not require a super-intellect. Nor is there anything mystical about success. And success doesn't based on luck. Successful people are just ordinary folks who have developed belief in themselves and what they do. Never -- yes, never -- sell yourself short.\" \"Believe it can be done. When you believe something can be done, really believe, your mind will find the ways to do it. Believing a solution paves the way to solution.\" \"How we think shows through in how we act. Attitudes are mirrors of the mind. They reflect thinking.\" \"There is a good side to every situation.\" \"The success combination in business is: Do what you do better... and: Do more of what you do...\" \"Do what you fear and fear disappears"

He became an official under Later Liang's founder Zhu Wen (Zhu Quanzhong) based on his sister's being a concubine to Emperor Taizu, and later became a major general during the reign of Later Liang's last emperor Zhu Zhen. The failure in his ambitious plan to counterattack against Later Liang's northern rival Later Tang enabled Later Tang to defeat and conquer Later Liang, but despite such failure, he became a trusted general under Later Tang's founder Emperor Zhuangzong as well. After Emperor Zhuangzong's own fall and death, and succession by his adoptive brother Emperor Mingzong of Later Tang (Li Siyuan), Emperor Mingzong exiled Duan and later forced him to commit suicide."

  "text" : "Dyson Stayt \"Tug\" Wilson (7 October 1926 – 20 April 2011) was a British international rugby player. He was born at Wilderness, Western Cape, South Africa and moved to England, following his parents' divorce, at the age of eight. He was accompanied by his mother and siblings and was subsequently adopted by his aunt in Staffordshire. He was educated at the King Edward VI Grammar School in Stafford and Rydal Penrhos School. He joined the Metropolitan Police Force and was capped for England while playing rugby for them as a wing-forward. He also played for Harlequins and London Counties. After playing eight times for England he was selected for the 1955 British Lions tour to South Africa, making 15 appearances and scoring three tries. He failed to make the test team, however. He later moved to Rhodesia and opened two curry restaurants in Salisbury. In 1969 he returned to England to settle in Cornwall, a county with strong family connections. He lived in the village of Treen, near Porthcurno, and made a livelihood fishing out of Newlyn during the 1970s. In 1981 he bought a small farm on the Lizard Peninsula where he farmed beef and adopted a 'Euro peasant' philosophy which embraced simple farming methods and anti-consumerism. He was a keen sailor and made several long ocean voyages. His first trip took him to the across the Atlantic and the Pacific on a 29 foot ketch. On his last voyage he and his wife suffered the loss of their mast in mid-Atlantic and had to make their way to Tristan da Cunha under a jury rig. He died in 2011 and was buried on his farm. He had married twice; firstly Ann, with whom he had two daughters; secondly Diana, with whom he had two sons and another daughter."

  "text" : "Don Nygord (June 13, 1936 in Pocatello, Idaho – December 26, 2004 in Prescott, Arizona) was an American sport shooter who competed in the 1984 Summer Olympics and in the 1988 Summer Olympics. Don Nygord grew up in eastern Oregon, where informal shooting was very common pursuit. He had guns of his own from the time he was 12 years old. He originally tried his hand at both fencing, and wrestling, but felt that neither sport was particularly a good fit for him. He attended Oregon State University, and then enlisted in the United States Air Force. It was based on a challenge to prove he could \"shoot a bottle cap off a rock at 25 paces\" by one of the members of the Mather AFB pistol team that Don got his start in competition. The challenge of the bullseye discipline captured his attention, and so began what would be a lifelong study of the art. After several years of competing, Don won the Civilian National Championship at the NRA Nationals in 1966 at Camp Perry, Ohio. At the time he was working in the Aerospace industry with Union Carbide's Specialty Metals Division in Indiana. A local shooter there introduced him to the UIT (now ISSF) courses of fire. Air Pistol and Free Pistol were real eye openers, and Don found these particularly challenging, compared to the conventional styles he been participating in. After shooting some of these types of matches locally, he did very well, and received his first invitations to attend the tryouts for the US Shooting Team. However, due to work and personal constraints, he didn't attended until 1978. That year, he went to Phoenix for the UIT Nationals, placed third in Air Pistol, and found himself on the US National Team. When told that the team would soon be traveling to shoot a match in Mexico, Don wanted to know how much it would cost him for the trip. Naive as he was regarding travel allowances, Don certainly proved his worth on the international stage, and found his way to the podium in no time. In 1979, Don knew he would win the National Air Pistol Championship \"before I pulled out of the driveway to go to the match.” And he did just that. Later that same year, the team went to the Pan American Games in Puerto Rico, where he won the Gold Medals for individual and team in Air Pistol. Following this success, he left the aerospace field for good, and started a business of supplying and customizing target guns and accessories so he could meet the US Team's demands for travel and competitions. Don would soon go on to win the World Championship in Santo Domingo in 1981, shooting a near World Record on a windy outdoor range. In the coming years, Don was a perennial member of the US National Team for decades, a National Champion 16 times, won more medals during his tenure than any other shooter in US history, was a member of the 1984 and 1988 US Olympic Teams—where he was the oldest US Olympian. He was the former holder of the US Free Pistol record (his score of 574 stood for over a decade), and held over 40 other National Records. As a competitor Don developed several important equipment advances, including the FWB Model 65 Mk II (with its shortened barrel), and his own \"TurboComp\" muzzle compensator, which was used on earlier generations of high-end target air pistols, until the manufacturers started producing their own compensated barrels. He was the US importer for many different quality competition firearms and air guns over the years through his company \"Nygord Precision Products,\" and offered pellets and accessories to shooting enthusiast as well."

  "text" : "Denis Dubourdieu (July 1, 1949 – July 26, 2016) was a French winemaker and professor of oenology at the University of Bordeaux. He managed or co-managed several properties in Bordeaux, including Château Reynon, Château Doisy Daëne, Château Cantegril, Château Haura, and Clos Floridène. He also consulted at Château Cheval Blanc. As part of his academic responsibilities, Dubourdieu was the director of l'Institut des Sciences de la Vigne et du Vin de l'Université de Bordeaux (English: Institute of Vine and Wine Sciences of the University of Bordeaux). The Institute is a multi-disciplinary research center where experts from the University of Bordeaux, l’Institut National de la RechercheAgronomique (English: The National Institute of Agronomic Research) and l’Ecole Nationale des Ingénieurs des travaux agricoles (English: The National School of Engineers of Agricultural Work) work together to assist wine producers with the state of the art in technology, technique and economic modeling. Dubourdieu specialized in winemaking processes for white wines, and has been called \"wine’s most famous scientist\". He played a leading role in the improvement of white Bordeaux wines, which as late as the 1960s were sweet and of low quality, to become \"serious, potentially profound dry whites\". Innovations proposed by Dubourdieu include organic farming, oak barrel fermentation with extended skin contact and improved bottling techniques."

  "text" : "Dominique Avon is a French historian of religion and professor at the University of Maine, France. He studies the interactions between monotheistic religions in the Mediterranean Basin, and has written several books on Catholic religious orders such as the Society of Jesus and the Order of Preachers and on Muslim groups such as the Hezbollah (Hezbollah: A History of the \"Party of God\", written with Anas-Trissa Khatchadourian). He is also the author of La Fragilité des clercs (\"The Frailty of the Intellectuals\", untranslated), an essay in which he analyses the thought of Samuel P. Huntington, Tariq Ramadan, Georges Corm, Alain Besançon and Alain Finkielkraut, and criticizes their perceived warmongering tendencies and inability to reason dispassionately about religious matters. The title is a pun on 1927 book La Trahison des clercs by Julien Benda. Hezbollah: A History of the \"Party of God\", published by Harvard University Press, contains a historical account as well as important primary sources about Hezbollah. While it was praised by John Quinn from The Risky Shift to be \"an exceptional dispassionate analysis of Hezbollah’s early and later years\", it has been criticized by Publishers Weekly for relying \"too heavily on Hezbollah's rhetoric to explain its motives and actions\" and by Princeton scholar Samuel Helfont for using \"passive constructions\" through which \"chronology and causality can be blurry\" (for instance, the book will read that conflicts \"erupted\" instead of depicting one party or another as active attackers)."

  "text" : "Danny Morton (born 1 July 1973) is a former Australian rules footballer who played with Fitzroy and Port Adelaide in the Australian Football League (AFL). Morton, a rover, was drafted to Fitzroy from North Adelaide, with the 70th selection of the 1992 National Draft. He played just 14 games in his first three seasons at Fitzroy, but put together 16 games in 1996. In 1997 Morton went back to North Adelaide, but would return to the AFL via the 1997 Draft, with Port Adelaide securing him with pick 41. When Port Adelaide drew with the Brisbane Lions at the Gabba in round 12 of the 1998 AFL season, Morton would receive two Brownlow Medal votes for his efforts, finishing with 27 disposals and four goals. The following round, while playing against the Western Bulldogs, Morton badly injured his neck when he landed on his head after contesting a mark. His injury required surgery, with the C4 and C5 vertebrae from his neck being fused together using a bone from his hip. He did not play again for the rest of the season or feature in the Port Adelaide team in 1999. In 2000 he returned to the side, and appeared in seven of the first 10 rounds, but then lost his place in the team permanently. He joined Norwood in 2001. Later on he decided to teach and then on he became a PE teacher in Adelaide, SA at Tyndale Christian School"

  "text" : "Daniel T. Blumstein is a prominent ethologist and conservation biologist. He is professor and chair for the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, as well as a professor for the Institute of the Environment and Sustainability, at the University of California, Los Angeles. He has authored or co-authored over 300 articles in peer-reviewed scientific journals. Furthermore, he authored the book The Failure of Environmental Education (and How We Can Fix It) with Charles Saylan, which was featured in the 2011 \"Summer Reading: 7 Education Books to Take to the Beach\" in Time Magazine. Because of his work in conservation and education, he was invited to join the panel at the first ever United States White House conference on environmental education. Blumstein earned a PhD in animal behavior in 1994 and a MS in animal behavior in 1990, both from the University of California, Davis. He earned a BA in environmental, population, and organismic biology as well as environmental conservation from the University of Colorado at Boulder in 1986. He was elected a fellow of the Society of Biology in 2010 and the Animal Behavior Society in 2012. He served as the editor of the journal Animal Behaviour from 2006 to 2009 and has been the editor of Evolution, Medicine, and Public Health since 2011. He has served various editorial roles for the journals Evolution: This View of Life, The Quarterly Review of Biology, Behavioral Ecology, Biology Letters, and Ethology. Inspired by the screams of a baby marmot, he conducted a study, published in Biology Letters, investigating nonlinearities in sound and their effect on response. The report found that the addition of non-linear elements produced stronger responses and valence, which implies that nonlinearities in sounds make them more frightening."

  "text" : "Dorota Krzysztofek (born 1980) is a Polish glamour model from Szczecin modeling for men's magazines such as CKM. She is known for winning a court battle in 2008–2009 that reasserted women's right to sunbathe topless on public beaches in Poland. In mid May 2008 Krzysztofek – along with her female companion – were fined by local municipal officials for sunbathing topless at a public recreation area known as the Arkonka beach (pictured). Both women refused to pay the fine and took the matter to Civil Court in Szczecin. Their first September hearing had to be postponed due to remarkable media interest. On November 7, 2008, judge Beata Szczepańska upheld the city staff decision, and charged the women with indecent exposure, explaining that their personal freedoms cannot encroach on the freedoms of families with children who frequent the same recreation spot. Although topless sunbathing is not prohibited, the judge ordered the two defendants to pay a fine of 230 zloty (150 zloty by different source, or €40, $55) for breaking the rules of conduct. In her decision judge Szczepańska also reprimanded the women and said that it is not up to them to teach youngsters human anatomy. However, the court decision was appealed by Krzysztofek's female friend soon afterwards, with the plea of not guilty. The appellate court declared both women to be innocent, because the city staff were unable to prove that anyone at the beach was indignant or scandalized by their nudity, and no complaint was ever filed, or even reported. On the contrary, some visitors stood up to their defense. There were no signs at the beach against what is otherwise legal. The appellate court’s decision was binding, but – as noted by journalist Magda Hartman – it also created an aura of ambivalence since topless sunbathing in public was therefore declared acceptable but only if no other sunbathers (including families with children) formally object to it."

  "text" : "Abdulredha Mohamed Hasan Buhmaid (or Buhamaid, Arabic: عبدالرضا محمد حسن بوحميد‎‎) was a 28-year-old Bahraini protester shot by a live bullet in the head on 18 February 2011. He died in hospital three days later, the seventh death in the Bahraini uprising. Buhmaid was among a group of protesters who on 18 February marched toward the Pearl Roundabout following the funeral procession of protester Ali Abdulhadi Mushaima, who was killed four days earlier. When the protesters neared Pearl Roundabout, the army opened fire. Buhmaid collapsed to the ground, and blood poured from his head after it was hit by a bullet. The army opened fire twice more. Protesters regrouped after each round of shooting. Riot police finally intervened and dispersed protesters. Over one hundred protesters were injured, some seriously. Buhmaid was taken to Salmaniya hospital where attempts to revive him failed over the course of three days. He died on the afternoon of 21 February. Several witnesses including journalists and medics accused authorities of shooting directly at protesters, preventing some ambulances from reaching the site and firing at others. The government however, denied those statements. It stated that warning shots were fired in the air and accused protesters of faking injuries. An investigation by a government-appointed commission of inquiry blamed the army for Buhmaid's death. The incident marked the first time that the Royal Bahraini Army was used to confront civilians, and at the time was considered \"the bloodiest\" incident since protests erupted. Following the incident, the government offered dialogue which the opposition said they will only take part in after the withdrawal of the army. The general labor union called for a general strike. Internationally, the attack on protesters was condemned by Barack Obama and Human Rights Watch. High Representative of European Union expressed her deep concerns and called for restrain and immediate dialogue. Britain revoked over forty arms licenses to Bahrain after an earlier announcement that it would review them and German president canceled a planned visit to the country. Buhmaid is remembered by the opposition as a martyr, leader and symbol of peacefulness."

It was a bold idea, so novel that at every meeting Daniel was able to increase the size”  until trans-border protection resulted for the entire Mount Everest and central Himalayan region encompassing an area larger than Switzerland connecting the ecosystems of China and Nepal. Taylor is Executive Director of Future Generations and Future Generations Graduate School both of which he founded. He has established thirteen nonprofit organizations, twelve still thrive, five are in the US. Since 1993, he has been also a Senior Associate at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. He was knighted Suprabala-Gorkha-Dakshina-Bahu in Nepal in 1990, made the first Honorary Professor of Quantitative Ecology by the Chinese Academy of Sciences in 1995, and decorated with the Order of the Golden Ark by Prince Bernhard of the Netherlands in 2004."

Galloway, appeared to have been a member of the local Corinthian Society (a group of businessmen who regularly met in the local ale-houses to talk business and friendship). He wrote numerous works on many and varied topics and several books of his works were published. These include :- 1.  \n*  Miscellaneous Poems by David Hobkirk, 1828, which was reprinted in 2011 2.  \n* The Florentine Brothers and other poems, 1832. A review of which, published in The Athenæum Journal of 1832, suggested that “Some of his works are fuller of words than of meaning …… he be advised to lay the scene of his next poem near Newcastle, and make his characters out of the ladies and gentlemen around; he will find all he wants, without wetting his feet in long excursions ….. but because we dislike his theme, we are not about to cut up his verses: we have no such intentions, in truth we think many of his strains very sweet and beautiful….”. This book included “The Florentine Brothers” and “The Miniature” among others He also wrote \"The praise of Corinth and the local Corinthians\" given on 4 June 1827, and “To the Memory of R. Young”, which appeared on pages 233 and 232 in Thomas Allan's Illustrated Edition of Tyneside Songs and Readings. Both these work, like several others, was signed using his initials \"D.GH\". Otherwise very little information is available."

He was chosen to compete at the 2012 Summer Olympics. His 1500 m personal best is 3:33.82 minutes. Born in Debre Zeyit in Ethiopia's Oromia Region, he came to international prominence as a teenager with a bronze medal at the 2007 World Youth Championships in Athletics and a silver at the 2007 African Junior Athletics Championships. He set a personal best of 3:41.25 minutes for the 1500 m that year at the Meeting Iberoamericano. He ran at the 2008 World Junior Championships in Athletics but was eliminated in the first round. Dawit knocked nearly five seconds off his best in 2009. He won the Josef Odlozil Memorial 1500 m, took bronze at the 2009 African Junior Athletics Championships, and closed the season with a best of 3:36.74 minutes at the Shanghai Golden Grand Prix. A third-place finish in the 800 metres at the 2010 Ethiopian Athletics Championships led to an appearance in that event at the 2010 African Championships in Athletics, where he was a semi-finalist. He had top three finishes on the 2011 European track and field circuit, highlighted by a run of 3:34.13 minutes in Oordegem. He was a 1500 m finalist at the 2011 All-Africa Games, but did not finish in the final. He had a successful debut over the half marathon distance at the 2012 Egmond Half Marathon, breaking a thirteen-year-old course record with a time of 60:46 minutes. He was less successful at the Prague Half Marathon, coming eighth, but his 1500 m performances improved: he ran 3:33.82 minutes at the FBK Games and set a mile run best of 3:57.48 minutes at the Prefontaine Classic. As the second fastest Ethiopian that season, he was chosen for the Ethiopian team for the 2012 London Olympics."

A dual British and Chilean citizen, he joined the Royal Air Force, in 1941, halting his rugby career. He was a pilot with the Bomber Commander, being killed in action during a raid over Germany, on 12 September 1944. He was inducted at the IRB Hall of Fame in May 2012, among his brother Ian Campbell, who was present. Donald was represented by his son, Colin. Ian said: \"This is a huge honour for me and I couldn't be more pleased at the fact that Donald has been included in this induction as well. He was my sporting hero.

As professor in European art history from the Osteuropa-Institut, Frey was wined and dined by the Polish art experts numerous times in late 1930s. He prepared a meticulous list of the most valuable paintings at the National Museum, Warsaw among other locations across Poland. He showed up at the Museum again in October 1939 with the Gestapo, after the capitulation of the Polish capital, and directed the SS-Untersturmführer Theo Daeisel to art pieces that needed to be seized and shipped to Germany first, including the Portrait of a Young Man by Rembrandt from the collections of the Łazienki Palace (Pałac Łazienkowski), and numerous other masterpieces including paintings by Bernardo Bellotto called Canaletto. The items stolen from the National Museum included 99% of all coins, 100% of historic clocks, 80% jewellery, 63% fabrics, 60% furniture, and 70% ancient manuscripts. The Gestapo headquarters in Warsaw presented the Rembrandt as a gift to Hans Frank in occupied Kraków. Frey moved to Kraków the same month, along with his colleague from the SS, dr Joseph Mühlmann. Together, they pinpointed all sorts of treasures at Wawel (architectural detail notwithstanding), directing Frank in a mass looting campaign. On Frey's advice, even the fireplaces were ripped out from the walls."

  "text" : "Djadoeg Djajakusuma ([dʒaˈdʊʔ dʒajakuˈsuma]; 1 August 1918 – 28 October 1987), generally credited as D. Djajakusuma, was an Indonesian film director and promoter of traditional art forms. Born to a nobleman and his wife in Temanggung, Central Java, Djajakusuma became interested in the arts at a young age, choosing to pursue a career in theatre. During the Japanese occupation from 1943 to 1945 he was a translator and actor, and in the four-year national revolution which followed he worked for the military's educational division, several news agencies, and in drama. In 1951, Djajakusuma joined the National Film Corporation (Perfini) at the invitation of Usmar Ismail. After making his directorial debut with Embun, Djajakusuma released a further eleven films with the company before leaving in 1964. He then returned to traditional Indonesian theatre, including wayang. Although he continued to direct movies independently of Perfini, most of his energies were dedicated to promoting traditional art forms and teaching cinematography. After over a decade of poor health and high blood pressure, Djajakusuma collapsed during a ceremony and died. He was buried in Karet Bivak Cemetery. The dedicated but easily angered Djajakusuma was influenced by Usmar Ismail's realist views, although he focused more on traditional aspects of life. His theatrical performances attempted to modernise traditional forms so that they could be better received in a modern world. He is credited with revitalising the Betawi theatre form lenong and received numerous awards for his filmmaking, including a lifetime achievement award at the Indonesian Film Festival."

He won two European motocross championships, and was a member of British motocross teams that won two Motocross des Nations events as well as two Trophée des Nations events. Bickers was awarded the Motorcycle News 'Man of the Year' award in 1960. In the early 1960s, Bickers was one of the top motorcycle racers in the sport of scrambles, which eventually became more widely known by the European term 'motocross'. He began competing in motorcycle scrambles at the age of 15 just before the official age which he was eligible to ride, which was sixteen, and he was so successful that he was rewarded with a sponsorship from the Dot motorcycle company. His riding talent got him noticed by Greeves factory rider, Brian Stonebridge, who then recommended that Bickers be hired by Greeves in 1958. He won two consecutive 250cc European motocross championships in 1960 and 1961 for the Greeves factory racing team. The European championship was considered to be the world championship at the time, as the sport of motocross had yet to develop outside of Europe. Bickers was a member of British teams that won the Trophée des Nations event in 1961 and in 1962. He also helped British teams win the Motocross des Nations in 1966 and 1967. The middle-1960s saw the start of the move away from traditional large-capacity four-stroke engines to two-strokes. From 1966 Bickers rode CZ models and was the UK importer for the 250 cc and 360 cc scramblers together with a trials bike, followed by CZ roadsters and Jawa models in 1973, selling both marques initially from his premises at Woodbridge Road, Ipswich, Suffolk, followed by a move to Farthing Road Industrial Estate, Ipswich. As one of the first European riders to race in the United States, Bickers helped to introduce Americans to the sport of motocross. He also competed in the Trans-AMA motocross series in 1971 and 1972. After retiring from competition, Bickers started a company manufacturing stunt equipment used in the film industry. He also appeared as a stunt double for Roger Moore in Octopussy and Escape to Athena among other film work. Bickers died after a stroke on 6 July 2014."

  "text" : "David Kaplan (c. 1947 – August 13, 1992) was an American television producer for ABC News, killed while his team was covering the Yugoslav Wars. On August 13, 1992, on his first day in Yugoslavia, he was struck by a sniper's bullet near the Sarajevo Airport while driving through Sniper Alley. His team had arrived to interview Milan Panic, the new Yugoslav prime minister. When traveling with the prime minister, however, the armored United Nations car proved to be too small to hold everyone, and Kaplan was moved to a \"soft-skinned\" (unarmored) van of another television crew. Because Kaplan had no flak jacket, he was seated between two journalists who did. A few minutes later, a bullet was fired through the tailgate of the van, between the taped letters \"T\" and \"V\". Kaplan was not wearing a flak jacket, and the bullet entered his back, severing an artery. He died hours later in a Sarajevo hospital. Kaplan was the first American citizen to be killed in the Yugoslav Wars. The shooter was unknown. ABC News anchor Sam Donaldson, who had also been traveling in the motorcade, called Kaplan \"a good man\" who \"understood the risks here\". US presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater described Kaplan as \"an honest, fair, talented and creative journalist\" and called his death \"a very sad and personal loss for all of us who've worked with David\". ABC News President Roone Arledge praised Kaplan as a man who had \"devoted his life to news and to this organization.\" In October 1992, Kaplan was posthumously awarded the International Press Freedom Award of the Committee to Protect Journalists. His widow Sally accepted the award on his behalf. The following year, Sam Donaldson created a fellowship in Kaplan's name at the Missouri School of Journalism of the University of Missouri."

  "text" : "David Lubbock Robinson (c.1882 – 21 August 1943) was an Irish Fianna Fáil politician and a revolutionary figure in County Wicklow during the Irish War of Independence and the Irish Civil War. He was born in Dublin in 1882 to the Very Reverend J.J. Robinson, who was Rector of Delgany and later the Dean of St Anne's Cathedral, Belfast. His grandfather, John Robinson, was the owner of the Daily Express newspaper in Dublin. His mother was the youngest daughter of Sir John W. Lubbock and a sister of the first Lord Avebury, the noted scientist. He was educated at St Columba's College and at Trinity College, Dublin and qualified as a solicitor. He was a keen hockey enthusiast and represented Ireland at international level. After he qualified he travelled to Canada and during World War I he enlisted in the 19th Alberta Dragoons as a private and was commissioned to the Royal Marine Artillery. He had a distinguished military career and was awarded the Distinguished Service Order by the British Government and the Croix de guerre. He had lost an eye and was badly wounded in both legs during his years at the front. His cousin, Robert Barton, had resigned as a British Officer after the 1916 Easter Rising and was elected as a Sinn Féin Teachta Dála at the 1918 general election for the West Wicklow constituency. His other cousin, Erskine Childers, used his yacht, The Asgard to transport guns from Germany to Ireland on behalf of the Irish Volunteers. He too was a former British Army Officer but became more sympathetic with the cause of Irish independence after the events of the Rising. Robinson took an active part in the War of Independence in Wicklow. He opposed the Anglo-Irish Treaty and fought on the Republican side in the Civil War. He was present in Annamoe, County Wicklow when his cousin, Erskine, was arrested by Free State Troops and taken to Dublin which would result in his court martial and execution. Robinson was himself arrested in 1922 and spent forty days on hunger strike during his eighteen months internment in Mountjoy jail. He was one of seven successful Fianna Fáil candidates who secured election to the Free State Seanad at the 1931 Seanad election, securing a nine-year term. Michael Comyn, the Leas-Chathaoirleach of the Seanad was appointed a Circuit Court Judge on 24 February 1936 and he resigned his seat in the Seanad. Robinson succeeded him as Leas-Chathaoirleach. He remained a member of the Seanad until its abolition in 1936. In 1938 he was nominated by then Taoiseach Éamon de Valera to the newly formed Seanad Éireann. He was nominated again to the 3rd Seanad but did not seek re-election in 1943. He was also the Secretary of the Irish Red Cross when it was inaugurated. He died at Delgany, County Wicklow aged sixty-one years."

  "text" : "Dillwyn Miles (25 May 1915 – 1 August 2007) was a Welsh writer. Miles was born in Newport, Pembrokeshire and baptised William James Dillwyn Miles. He became in 1932 the youngest clerk of a parish council in the country, following the death of his father. While still underage he was elected a burgess and was to serve as Mayor of Newport three times, the last in 1979–80. He attended university at Aberystwyth but was so dogged by ill-health his obituary was prepared. After college, he taught in various places around Pembrokeshire from 1936 till the outbreak of war. He served mainly in Palestine, having enlisted in the Royal Army Service Corps in 1939. During June 1941 he had the task of typing and re-typing the 22-clause peace agreement following the overthrow of the Vichy regime in Syria. A newspaper report of the time recorded \"the magnificent service rendered by a young Welsh poet who displayed remarkable ability during the crisis following the surrender of the Syrian Forces\". Another said it \"had been drafted by Wales's youngest bard\". Miles managed to keep a copy of the agreement and one of the pens used to sign it. Back in Wales, Miles was a member of the Gorsedd of Bards of the National Eisteddfod, Grand Swordbearer, and Herald Bard. He was in attendance at Caernarvon Castle in July 1969 for the Investiture of the Prince of Wales. Miles worked tirelessly for Welsh affairs, including lecturing at the University of Wales, serving on influential committees concerned with health, welfare and culture, and served as Mayor of Haverfordwest. He edited the Pembrokeshire Historian for almost 30 years and in 1973 founded the Association of Trusts for Nature Conservation in Wales. His wife died in 1976. Miles was survived by a son and daughter, and his companion of twenty-three years, Judith."

After serving in World War II as a communications officer, he came to Spokane in 1949. Among many political and community activities, Rodgers was a member of the local YMCA and Boy Scouts boards, along with city and county Republican committees. Rodgers was appointed to Spokane City Council in 1966 to fill an unexpired term of council Luke Williams. After incumbent mayor Neal Fosseen announced his resignation in 1967, Rodgers declared his candidacy for the position in July of that year. He was elected on November 7, 1967, defeating Ralph Rosenberry, another prominent Spokane citizen, in an election that was described by a local newspaper as having an \"unexpected low vote\". He was re-elected to another term in 1973 and served as mayor until retiring in 1978. Rodgers is the last Spokane mayor to be re-elected to a second term, as of 2012. After retiring, Rogers, who had formerly worked in the insurance business, served as Washington's Deputy State Insurance Commissioner. One of Rodgers' sons, Brian Rodgers, is married to Cathy McMorris Rodgers, who has served as the United States Representative of Washington's 5th congressional district since 2005."

The areas supervised by him are monetary policy, economic research, and statistics. He has also worked in various positions in economic research and monetary policy departments of the RBI. He served in the International Monetary Fund (IMF) as senior adviser. He has graduated with a bachelor's degree in economics with honors from Ravenshaw College, Cuttack, in 1979, before going to Jawaharlal Nehru University for his master's degree. He also holds a master's degree in economics from Yale University. His current research interest includes monetary economics and international macroeconomics. He has presided over a few committees in RBI for suggesting various policy changes by the central bank. In one such committee he suggested that only the repo rate should be the signalling rate and that the monetary system should almost always operate in a deficit. One other big suggestion he made is that the government's surplus cash deposited with the RBI should be auctioned so that there is no lead and lag in liquidity. Mohanty has recently edited and contributed to a book of research papers titled Regional Economy of India: Growth and Finance."

  "text" : "David Sargsyan (Armenian: Դավիթ Ռաֆայելի Սարգսյան; born on July 14, 1977 in Yerevan) was the Minister of Finance of Armenia from 2013 to 2014. Prior to that, he held the position of the Chief of Staff (Secretary of the Cabinet) of the Government of Armenia from 2008 to 2013. During his tenure at the executive authority, he initiated a number of reforms. As the Minister of Finance he headed the activities of piloting the issuance of Eurobonds for Armenia and assuring Armenia’s access to international capital market. Minister Sargsyan initiated a number of reforms in the field of public procurement to increase accountability and transparency of the process. One of the successes of this reform was the implementation of the E-procurement system, as well as improvement of the appealing procedures and the public control over them. Another set of major reforms was in the area of public administration. One of the undertakings was to put clear distinction between the functions of political officials and staff in public administration bodies, policy makers, and public institutions offering state services. Another reform was targeted at the implementation of an electronic management system for the Government that consisted of 15 components, ranging from electronic document and workflow management system to a “one-stop-shop” that would allow registering a business in 15 minutes. It also included electronic system of applications for licenses and submission of reports of licensed entities; electronic system of government payments, etc. As a result of undertaken reforms, the level of transparency of public administration bodies improved sharply, due to which Armenia became the first country in the world to disclose the government expenditures on-line on daily basis through the “interactive budget” application."

Her death occurred on or about 7 August 2007, her body being discovered a week later in a clandestine grave in Kings Park, Perth, with no clearly established cause of death. Her husband Lloyd Rayney, a prominent barrister specialising in criminal prosecution, was charged with her murder but found not guilty after a trial before a judge only. The acquittal was unanimously upheld by a court of appeal in August 2013. The state's police commissioner and attorney general declined to acknowledge documented procedural mistakes, and refused to instigate a fresh search for the killers, leading to calls for a federal investigation into the matter. The Rayneys had two daughters and resided in the Perth suburb of Como. At the time, Lloyd Rayney was involved in a Corruption and Crime Commission inquiry into the misconduct of police officers in a murder investigation. Corryn Rayney was employed as a registrar at the Supreme Court of Western Australia. She was last seen alive at 9.30 p.m. on 7 August 2007 at a bootscooting class. A week later, police discovered her abandoned car and followed a trail of oil from it to the grave in Kings Park."

  "text" : "Dogan Penjor Rabgye (simplified Chinese: 朵噶·彭措饶杰; traditional Chinese: 朵噶·彭措饒傑; pinyin: Duogá Péngcuò ráojié; Tibetan: མདོ་མཁར་ཕུན་ཚོགས་རབ་རྒྱས།, Wylie: mdo mkhar phun tshogs rab rgyas; 1903–13 March 1957), alternate names Raokashag Penjor Rabgye (Chinese: 饶噶厦·彭措饶杰; pinyin: Ráogáxià Péngcuò ráojié) and Phuntsok Rabgye Ragashar, was an ethnic Tibetan general in the People's Liberation Army and a high-ranking official of the People's Republic of China originating from Lhasa, Tibet. Born in 1903 within a Tibetan noble family, at the age of 6 he attended a Tibetan school for nobles, and in 1923 began working within the kashag. During this time he was appointed various positions, including general manager of the Lhasa Police, government secretary, head commissioner of Cona County in Lhokha Prefecture, regimental commander within the Tibetan army, and commander-in-chief of the Tibetan army. In August 1949 he was promoted as a kalön to general commander of the Tibetan army. At the beginning of 1950, whilst he was the head of northern Tibet he commanded the 16th Tibetan army garrisoned in Nagchu. After the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet, in 1952 he became the second-in-command of the People's Liberation Army within the Tibet area. In the summer of 1953, he was appointed by the 14th Dalai Lama and 10th Panchen Lama as the regimental commander of the national day ceremony, and was sent to Beijing to participate in the 4th year anniversary celebrations of the founding of the People's Republic of China. Soon after, he led a delegation which travelled to Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Shenyang, Nanjing, Hangzhou and Xining for half a year. After returning to Beijing, he issued a Tibetan-language broadcast on China National Radio. In January 1954, as a delegate of the government of the People's Republic of China, he attended bilateral negotiations between China and India. In 1955 he was awarded the rank of lieutenant general. In 1956, he was elected as a committee member of the Preparationary Committee of the Tibet Autonomous Region, and later accompanied the Dalai Lama in his visit to India for the 2,500 year birthday anniversary of the Siddhartha Gautama. As the Dalai Lama returned to China in February 1957 via Sikkim, Dogan Penjor Rao Jie died of illness on 13 March 1957 while passing by Shigatse."

Prior to entering the National Assembly, De Courcy was funding President of the Commission scolaire de Montreal for the Mouvement pour une école moderne et ouverte. Following the 2012 election, De Courcy immediately entered Cabinet as Minister of Immigration and Cultural Communities and, most importantly, Minister Responsible for the Charter of the French Language. In this capacity, she has been a central figure in the debate surrounding Bill 14, a proposed piece of legislation that would amend the Charter of the French Language (Bill 101). De Courcy was defeated in the 2014 election, which saw the PQ reduced to 30 seats across the province and hold on to only 4 seats on the Island of Montreal. One possible reason for De Courcy's defeat in Crémazie was the backlash to the Quebec Charter of Values, which was highly unpopular among the large immigrant population in the riding."

After military service during World War I, he studied at West Virginia Wesleyan College and graduated with a B.S. He worked as a high school teacher and athletic coach 1925–33 and as Chief Clerk in the office of the Secretary of State of West Virginia 1933–48, excepting service in the armed forces during World War II. In 1942, he married Mildred Elizabeth Smith and they had a daughter, Patricia. O'Brien sought the Democratic nomination to succeed his father as Secretary of State and won the primary election in May 1948, but his father died August 10, which led to his appointment by Governor Clarence Meadows to fill the unexpired term. On November 2, 1948, he was elected Secretary of State for a full term. He was reelected in 1952 and 1956, but did not complete his last term, since he suffered from sudden death November 29, 1957, just as his father before him."

He was a founding member of the Manitoba Medical College, later the faculty of medicine at the University of Manitoba. He was first elected to the provincial assembly in an 1881 by-election held after Andrew Laughlin was named registrar. Wilson served in the Manitoba cabinet as Provincial Secretary and Minister of Public Works. He married Annie E. Armstrong in 1887. He served as coroner for Marquette County and was secretary-treasurer for the North Dufferin Agricultural Society. In 1889, Wilson returned to the practice of medicine in Vancouver, retiring in 1894. He was the first president of the Vancouver Medical Association and was vice-president of the British Columbia Permanent Loan Company, the Pacific Coast Fire Insurance Company and the Royal Plate Glass Insurance Company. Wilson died in Vancouver at the age of 71."

  "text" : "David Denicke (30 January 1603 – 1 April 1680) was a German jurist and hymn writer. Born in Zittau, he studied law and philosophy and became a lecturer in Königsberg. He traveled from 1625 to 1628 to Holland, England and France. In 1629, he became tutor to the sons of George, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg in Herzberg. In 1647 he published a hymn book New Ordentlich Gesang-Buch. Sampt Einer nothwendigen Vorrede u. Erinnerung Von dessen nützlichem Gebrauch (New regulated hymnal. With a necessary preface and reminder of its helpful use), and in 1659 the Hannoversches Gesangbuch (Hanoverian Hymnal). He died in Hannover. J. S. Bach used some of his chorale texts in his cantatas, a stanza from \"Kommt, laßt euch den Herren lehren\" in Brich dem Hungrigen dein Brot, BWV 39, a stanza from \"O Gottes Sohn, Herr Jesu Christ\" and one from \"Wenn einer alle Ding verstünd\" in Du sollt Gott, deinen Herren, lieben, BWV 77. He began his cantata Schau, lieber Gott, wie meine Feind, BWV 153, with the first stanza from Denicke's hymn. Some of Denicke's hymns such as \"Herr, für dein Wort sei hoch gepreist\", \"Wir Menschen sind zu dem, was geistlich ist, untüchtig\" and \"O Vater der Barmherzigkeit\" and still sung in Hanoverian churches today."

While on combat air patrol he directed his squadron to attack an enemy formation of Japanese bombers which was heavily protected by fighters. Even though his squadron was significantly outnumbered they were able to shoot down over 40 enemy aircraft in 30 minutes without suffering one loss. Lt Cmdr Clark himself shot down one enemy fighter and damaged another during the confrontation. His quick action and the superiority of his squadron turned back what would surely have been a devastating attack on his carrier group. Along with the Navy Cross Capt Clark (rank at retirement) received three Distinguished Flying Crosses, five Air Medals, a Navy and Marine Corps Commendation Medal during his time in combat in the Pacific Theater as Naval Aviator. After the war he took part in the development of the Navy's jet fighter program, as well as served in the Pentagon. Clark retired from the U.S. Navy in 1963, and moved to south Florida where he lived until his death on August 6, 2012, at the age of 95. He was scheduled to be buried in Arlington National Cemetery with full military honors."

David Shinar is a professor of Ergonomics, he founded the Center for Research in Ergonomics and Safety and established the first driving research simulation laboratory in Israel in the Department of Industrial Engineering and Management. He has directed research on driver information processing and human factors in crash causation for over 35 years and authored over 150 reports in this area. David's main interests are ergonomics aspects of traffic safety, in particular driver visual and perceptual skills in vision and perception. In this area he has studied headway perception and distance estimation, driver eye movements, and driver hazard detection. In addition he has studied the impact of these factors on young and old drivers, and drivers impaired by alcohol, drugs, and fatigue. More recently his research interests are geared towards vulnerable road users, especially bicyclists. Personal Life David Shinar was born on October 8, 1943, in Jerusalem, Israel. He spent a part of his teenage years in Philadelphia, PA.

  "text" : "Daniel \"DPD\" Park (aka \"DPD\") is a Korean-American director and filmmaker, who directed a web-series entitled Ktown Cowboys, which won Best First Feature at the Los Angeles Asian Pacific Film Festival in 2010. He has also directed a number of music videos for Far East Movement, including \"Rocketeer (LA Dreamer)\" and \"Dirty Bass featuring Tyga.\" He has also directed the music video for IAMMEDIC's \"Schizophrenia\". He is currently working as executive producer on the show Alpha Girls with Mnet America. Park was also featured in Grace Su's documentary Future Rockstars of America. His production company is known as \"Transparent Agency.\" He has recently directed the feature version of Ktown Cowboys, which premiered at the 2015 SXSW (South by Southwest Film Festival). The film was executive produced by Ken Jeong, was written by Danny Cho and Brian Chung, and also stars Danny Cho, Bobby Choy, Peter Jae, Sunn Wee, Shane Yoon, Eric Roberts, Steve Byrne, Kim Young Chul, Simon Rhee and Daniel Dae Kim. In March 2016 the film received a four-city theatrical release prior to its video-on-demand release. Reviewing the film, The New York Times called it a \"mess\" and commented that the webseries was superior; The Washington Post said it was \"haphazard\"; and the Los Angeles Times also felt the film \"misses the mark\"."

Onciul studied at Chernivtsi University, where he was active in Arboroasa and then in Societatea Academică Junimea, and the University of Vienna. In 1884, he received his doctorate in philosophy from Chernivtsi University. He became a professor at the University of Bucharest and director of the National Archives of Romania. He was the first chairman of the Advisory Heraldic Commission. Together with Ioan Bogdan, Onciul founded a school-of-thought in Romanian historiography that approached history critically. He dealt with the issue of Romanian origin, demonstrating the formation of the Romanian people over a wide area on both sides of the Danube and rejected the theory of medieval migration of Romanians from the Balkan Peninsula. Much of his work dealt with and documented the formation of the early Romanian feudal states. He sought to separate Medieval realities from 20th century politics."

  "text" : "Daniel FitzGerald Runde (born January 21, 1972 in Andrews Air Force Base, Maryland, United States) is a senior executive, strategist and expert in international development, trade investment, global business and organizational change who builds dynamic partnership alliances among governments, multi-lateral institutions, corporations, and philanthropies. Currently, Runde is Director of the Project on Prosperity and Development and holds the William A. Schreyer Chair in Global Analysis at Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS). His work centers on America leveraging its full set of soft power instruments and the central roles of the private sector and good governance in creating a more free and prosperous world. CSIS provides strategic insights and bipartisan policy solutions to decision makers in government, international institutions, the private sector, and civil society. His priority is to ensure that the United States possesses the tools necessary to remain the preeminent player in global development in the 21st century and is positioned to achieve its foreign policy and national security goals. In a bi-partisian manner, Runde has influenced leading development issues including the trade and aid nexus, domestic resource mobilization, governance and corruption, and development finance. He disseminated research and championed recommendations for the reallocation of US assistance resources for developing country financial management systems rather than direct service and social infrastructure, which can be funded through in-country tax dollars. Runde’s evidence based approach was central to persuading the Department of State to allocate aid resources to promote domestic resource mobilization (the use of tax revenue) to pay for social sector spending, since emerging economies generate significant taxes and recurring fees to fund programs important to local citizens. He has advised a number of governments including the United States, Canada, Korea and Denmark as well as the World Bank and United Nations on development policy. In 2011, he played a central role in persuading the U.S. Congress to renew United States support for the World Bank and other multi-lateral banks. His testimony was made before the U.S. Congress. He has also testified before the Canadian Parliament on the role of the private sector and Canadian development policy as well as the Australian Parliament on the role of its international development policy in the Asia Pacific region. In 2013, Runde’s contributions were an important factor in the World Bank President’s decision to retain the Doing Business Index, a central pillar of the World Bank’s work. Runde spearheaded a parallel independent review of the Doing Business Indicators, which persuaded World Bank stakeholders, the Obama Administration, and other influencers to maintain the current state of the indicators. He provided in-depth analysis and framed the debate by convening top thinkers, hosting an in-depth conference on the topic, providing testimony in front of an official World Bank review committee, and initiated a number of Op-Eds. Previously, he led the Foundations Unit for the Department of Partnerships & Advisory Service Operations at the International Finance Corporation (IFC), the private sector arm of the World Bank Group. He developed, led, and managed outreach efforts to successfully position IFC as a partner of choice for private and corporate philanthropy. His work facilitated and supported over $20M in new funding through partnerships with the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, Rockefeller Foundation, Kauffman Foundation, and Visa International among other global private and corporate foundations. Earlier, Runde was the Director of the Office of Global Development Alliances (GDA) at the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) where he managed a $10–20M annual budget for partnership activities internationally. He represented the U.S. Government to senior leaders of foreign governments, corporations, and foundations. Runde led the GDA partnership initiative by providing training, networks, staff, funds, and advice to establish and strengthen alliances while personally consulting to 15 USAID missions in Latin America, the Middle East, and Africa. His efforts leveraged $4.8B through 100 direct alliances and 300 others through training and technical assistance. He began his career in financial services at Alex. Brown & Sons, Inc. in Baltimore and worked for both CitiBank and BankBoston in Buenos Aires, Argentina.

Hughes owned and operated three early child-care centers helping establish the modern convention in the 1960s. She also owned an office supply business in Harlem from 1997 to 2007 and wrote about her experiences in Wake Up and Smell the Dollars! (2011) and I'm Just Saying... It Looks Like Ethnic Cleansing (The Gentrification of Harlem) (2012), advocating small business ownership to other African Americans as a form of empowerment, as well as advising how to avoid potential pitfalls specific to African Americans.The National Portrait Gallery selected for its collection a photograph of Hughes and Steinem sharing a large skirt, each with a raised fist salute to demonstrate feminist solidarity. The photograph was shot by photographer Dan Wynn for Esquire Magazine in 1971. Oprah Winfrey honored Hughes as one of America’s \"Great Moms\". Hughes is the aunt of actress Gabourey Sidibe. Hughes has focused her activism in the Northside community of Jacksonville, Florida, growing food within the neighborhoods to combat poverty. She owns the Gateway Bookstore in Jacksonville."

Publishing was one of the main strategies adopted by black intellectuals in challenging the foundations of British colonial rule, and Pizer's skills enabled her to play an important role in this global political struggle: She has been praised for her tireless work as a secretary to provide a living for Padmore, her typing efforts on his manuscripts, and her reputation as a consummate hostess and excellent chef for the revolving door of African and West Indian nationalists who came to their home. Yet she was much more than this. Their relationship was both a practical and an intellectual partnership. It was a companionship in which ideas could be debated and strategies worked out."

  "text" : "Daniel O'Carroll (or O'Caroll) (died 4 November 1750) was a British Army officer who used the style of a baronet. He was the son of John O'Carroll (died 12 August 1733) of Beaugh, County Galway, by his second wife Margaret Crean. Margaret Crean was the daughter of Andrew O'Crean (or Crean) of Coursfield, County Mayo, and of County Sligo, and his wife Margaret, daughter of Baron Athenry. He was a captain in Henry Crofton's regiment, which fought on the Spanish side in the War of the Spanish Succession, against Britain and its allies. However, according to a pedigree published in the appendices of the 1723 edition of Geoffrey Keating's The General History of Ireland, he was \"created by the King of Spain a knight of the Most Military Order of St. Jago, for singular services done to that crown in the time of war, [but] he left the said service of Spain in a disgust, and afterwards had by a patent from Queen Anne, the rank of knighthood.\" \"At the instance of the Duke of Ormond\" he was appointed lieutenant-colonel of a \"regiment of horse\" on 1 March 1709, and colonel on 2 December 1710. The regiment was disbanded on 22 December 1711, and shortly thereafter he assumed the style of a baronet, although there is no patent or other record of such a creation in either Great Britain or Ireland. His obituaries in The Gentleman's Magazine and The London Magazine both describe his baronetcy as one in the Baronetage of Great Britain rather than the Baronetage of Ireland, as do baronetage compilers William Betham and Robert Beatson, who both describe him as \"of Denton, Yorkshire\". He was promoted to brigadier-general on 29 October 1735, major-general on 2 July 1739, and lieutenant-general on 18 February 1742. He married in or before 1712, Elizabeth Jervoise, eldest daughter of Thomas Jervoise of Herriard, Hampshire, by his first wife Elizabeth, daughter of Sir Gilbert Clarke of Somersall Hall, Derbyshire. They had two sons, Daniel and John. His wife died in London on 30 December 1728, and was buried on 6 January 1729 at St Martin-in-the-Fields. He was buried in the same vault on 12 November 1750, and the administration of his estate, which was under £200 in value, was granted to his son \"Sir Daniel O'Carroll, Baronet\", on 20 November 1750. The eldest son, Daniel, was probably born about 1717. He was appointed as a captain in Ligonier's Horse in May 1752, and died without male issue on 30 January 1758 in the Dublin marshalsea. The style of baronet was then adopted by his younger brother John, who lived at York and Bath, Somerset. John O'Carroll was born on 14 February 1722 and was baptised at St Martin-in-the-Fields on 25 February 1722. He was alive on 10 June 1777 for the marriage of his son and niece, John and Elizabeth, the daughter of the second baronet, but the date of his death is unknown. The younger John was British Resident at Saxe-Weimar; he died at Frankfurt on 13 January 1818. The title of baronet was adopted successively by his two sons: Jervoise and John. Jervoise O'Carroll died at Hamburg in 1831 and John at Hildesheim on 2 June 1835. Neither is known to have been married or to have had any issue, and the baronetcy is presumed to be extinct or dormant."

He went on many travels, publishing works of his findings in countries such as Morocco and the Philippines. He described Marrakesh as Morocco's \"strangest city\", and wrote of it \"The city lies some fifteen or twenty miles from the foot of the Atlas mountains, which here rise to their grandest proportions. The spectacle of the mountains is superb. Through the clear desert air the eye can follow the rugged contours of the range for great distances to the north and eastward. The winter snow mantle them with white, and the turquoise sky gives a setting for their grey rocks and gleaming caps that is of unrivaled beauty.\" Barrows in his book \"Berbers And Blacks: Impressions Of Morocco, Timbuktu And The Western Sudan\" has extensively covered on his travel experience and findings traveling to Algeria and Morocco."

  "text" : "Ditte Ejlerskov (born 1982) is a Danish contemporary artist. She was born in Frederikshavn, Denmark, and lives and works in Sweden. The main tool in Ditte Ejlerskov's practice is media literacy. Most of Ejlerskov's work is founded on interactions with the Internet; written correspondences with email-scammers from exotic parts of the world, translations of trashy paparazzi photos into large scale abstract paintings or detailed medieval-looking copperplate etchings based on imagery from a contemporary music video. Her abstract and representational paintings analyse and explore the potential of painting as medium itself, as well as they are tools for interpreting our contemporary reality. Most of Ejlerskov's work has a feminist angle  and questions the space between the personal and the public; suggesting an individual experience within a stream of collective consciousness. The work \"About: The Blank Pages\" is a collaboration with EvaMarie Lindahl and it highlighs Taschen Basic Art - a book series that consists of 95 books of artists's biographies, 5 of which are of women artists. Ditte Ejlerskov is represented by Sommer & Kohl, Berlin, Germany"

  "text" : "David John Mays (November 22, 1896 - February 17, 1971) was a Virginia lawyer and writer who attempted to slow racial desegregation on behalf of Byrd Organization during the Massive Resistance era. Mays served as counsel to the Gray Commission which tried to formulate segregationists' response to the United States Supreme Court rulings in 1954 and 1955 in consolidated cases known as Brown v. Board of Education. He later unsuccessfully defended actions taken against NAACP attorneys (although he had argued against adoption of those laws and correctly predicted they would be overturned) and significantly unequal legislative reapportionment. In 2008 the University of Georgia Press published an annotated volume of excerpts of his diaries concerning the early years of Massive Resistance (1954-1959). In 1953, Mays won the Pulitzer Prize for Biography or Autobiography for Edmund Pendleton 1721-1803 (Harvard University Press, 1952), a biography of the late 18th-century Virginia politician and judge Edmund Pendleton."

  "text" : "Ricardo \"Dick\" Burzi was an Argentinian automotive designer, best known for his work with the Austin Motor Company in Birmingham, England. Burzi was born in Buenos Aires, the capital of Argentina, to a French mother. By 1929 he was working in Italy for Lancia, but was forced to leave after drawing cartoons belittling Benito Mussolini that were published in several newspapers. Lancia initially moved Burzi to their coachbuilding firm in Paris, but he was recruited by Lord Austin in 1929 to work at Longbridge in Birmingham after Austin received a recommendation from Vincenzo Lancia, whom he met while travelling on the Queen Mary to the United States. Burzi arrived at Longbridge speaking no English but was soon known universally as \"Dick\". His first designs for the Austin 16 were considered too advanced for conservative British tastes by Lord Austin, but in 1938 Burzi was appointed head of styling by the incoming works manager at Longbridge, Leonard Lord. Burzi's Italian background saw him interned on the Isle of Man when Italy entered the Second World War, but he was released in 1943 and started work on designing the Austin A40. Notable cars designed by Burzi in the post-war era included the Austin A30, the Austin A40, the Austin A70 and the Austin A90."

After his graduation, Simonsen returned to Denmark and a position as Rabbi in the Jewish Congregation of Copenhagen. He married Cora Salomon (1856-1938) and for ten years (1892-1902), David Simonsen held the office of Chief Rabbi. In 1903 he was awarded the title of professor by the University of Copenhagen. David Simonsen’s archives (which was acquired by The Royal Library, Denmark in 1932) reflect the history of several scientific disciplines over a full half century. The list of correspondents contains the names of leading scientists within Oriental and Jewish Studies, but also from other areas. During World War I, Simonsen acted as \"communication central\", maintaining all the important contacts in Denmark and abroad, between organisations and individuals. He was also able to relay messages between relatives on different sides of the front, and after the war, he continued to be active in different relief organisations, both in Denmark and abroad. David Simonsen’s private library of approximately 45.000 volumes, also acquired by The Royal Library in 1932, testifies to his wide-ranging scholarly interests."

  "text" : "Daniel Rabel (1578 - 3 January 1637) was a Renaissance French painter, engraver, miniaturist, botanist and natural history illustrator. He was the son of Jean Rabel (1545–1603) who was official artist at the court of Henri III. Rabel was first employed as a portrait painter by Marie de Medicis, the second wife of Henry IV of France. He served as Engineer in Ordinary for the King for the provinces of Brie and Champagne. In 1612 he became official artist to Duke of Nevers. In 1618 he moved to Saint-Germain-des-Prés, where he painted \"Suite de fleurs\" and \"Ballet de la douairière de Bilbao\". He also painted landscapes in oil, as well as hunting scenes. About 1631 he was appointed official artist to Gaston, Duke of Orléans, Henri IV‘s third son. He went to Paris, commissioned by Louis XIII to paint a portrait of his betrothed, Anne of Austria. The \"Theatrum Florae\" was originally published in Paris in 1622, with later editions in 1627 and 1633, and was a collection of botanical illustrations of 69 of the most striking plants then available, and which Rabel had been commissioned to paint for Gaston of Orléans. Other artists later added their work, notably Nicolas Robert (1614-1685). The plates eventually numbered over 6000 and are kept in the Muséum national d'histoire naturelle in Paris. There is some doubt among scholars as to whether Rabel engraved the original 69 plates, as none of them is signed and his name only appears on the title of the third edition. By the end of the 1700s they were generally assumed to have been done by Emanuel Sweert. From 1617 until his death in 1637, Rabel was a set designer for theatres and for ballets de cour, and designed ballet costumes. He made deliberate use of a sixteenth-century tradition of the grotesque in the creation of his exaggerated comic figures, and the extreme facial distortions he uses, such as 'grotesquely swollen and disjointed necks, protuding chins, exaggerated hooked and drooping noses, and glaring, squinting eyes'. These owe a lot to the grotesque caricatures by the German artist Hans Weiditz, and the printmakers Peter Flötner and Erhard Schön. In turn, Rabel's work influenced Inigo Jones, as well as other European artists of the period. Two of Rabel's ballets were: \n* \"Les Fées de la forêt de Saint-Germain\" (First performed in February 1625) \n* \"Grand Ballet de la douairière de Billebahaut\" (First performed in February 1626) \"Les Fées de la forêt de Saint-Germain\" was danced at the Louvre in February 1625, with Louis XIII himself in the role of a \"valiant fighter\". Rabel was banished to Blois by Cardinal Mazarin. Here he founded the first botanical garden of the province and imported many species from the Antilles through his doctor, Brunyer. He died in Paris, but his descendants continued to live in Blois. His widow, Anthoinette Guibourg, married Jacques de Bellville, a friend of the family and the King's ballet master and choreographer. Among other things, he created an illuminated Bible and published a book on the arms of Germany. Like his father, Jean Rabel, he did work for the astronomer Nicolas de Peiresc, a pupil of Galileo's, and is thought to have produced the first important map of the moon, a year before his death. In 1633 Peiresc wrote to Rabel and asked him to do drawings of some antique vases. The Bibliothèque nationale de France holds the originals of his \"Recueil de cent fleurs et insectes\"."

  "text" : "Davorin Savnik (7 September 1929 – 14 April 2014) was an industrial designer and architect from Slovenia. His work includes designing audiovisual and telecommunication devices, telephones, electro technical and electro-medical equipment, hand tools, household appliance and computer equipment. Occasionally he lectured at universities home and abroad.In 1966 he was awarded with Prešeren Fund Award.In 1979 he received the BIO and Stuttgart Design center recognition awards, later on the highest prize of the Japanese Ministry for Trade and Industry, as well as the gold medal from the trade fair in Brno. He was also awarded at the International Fair in Hannover. The most recognizable devices from his collection of design works were the telephones. His most renowned work was the ETA 80 telephone from 1978, which soon became a part of numerous households and offices around Slovenia and worldwide. Telephones were produced by the Iskra company in Kranj. More than 5 million ETA phone devices were made in Kranj alone and it can still be found in many homes. The telephone has become highly recognized abroad as well, and received many distinctions for its aesthetic form, including a Good Design Award. It has been adopted as part of the permanent exhibition of outstandingly designed modern products at the Museum of Modern Art in Munich, the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) in New York, and Ljubljana Architecture Museum in Ljubljana. Savnik’s idea has been copied by numerous manufacturers around the world, in a total output of 300 million pieces. Articles and pictures portraying the telephone have been published by Japanese, American, British, Russian, Czech and Croatian professional journals and newspapers. He died in 2014 aged 85."

He studied Physics at Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea, and emigrated to the United States in 1955 to attend Ohio State University, where he received a doctorate in physics. He was a researcher at Bell Telephone Laboratories in Murray Hill, New Jersey and he invented MOSFET (Metal Oxide Semiconductor Field-Effect Transistor), which is the basic element in most of today's electronic equipment, with Martin M Atalla in 1959. Along with his colleague Simon Sze, he also invented the floating gate memory cell, the foundation for many forms of semiconductor memory devices. He also conducted research on high frequency Schottky diodes, ferro-electric semiconductors, and luminous materials, and made important contributions to the field of electroluminescence. He also invented Floating Gate non-volatile semiconductor memory in 1967. After retiring from Bell Laboratories, he became the founding president of the NEC Research Institute in New Jersey. He was a fellow of the IEEE and a fellow of the Bell Laboratories. He was also a recipient of the Stuart Ballantine Medal of the Franklin Institute and the Distinguished Alummus Award of the Ohio State University College of Engineering.
