  "text" : "Evelyn Lawler (born October 18, 1929) is a retired American track and field athlete. She competed for the United States in the 80 metres hurdles at the 1951 Pan American Games, finishing 6th. She is perhaps better known as the mother of (9 time) multiple Olympic gold medalist Carl Lewis and Olympian, World Championship bronze medalist and sports announcer Carol Lewis. Lawler graduated from Tuskegee University. At one point in time she held the American record in the 80 metres hurdles. Lawler started in the sport as a sophomore in high school when her school picked 6 or 7 girls for a start up track team. Lawler was not selected but watched them practice. When it came time to compete, she asked if she could try and beat all the other girls on the team. When her school competed at a meet at Tuskegee, the coach Major Cleveland L. Abbott invited her to come to the University. She started hurdling when the previous hurdlers including (1948 Olympian) Theresa Manuel had graduated and the coach told her she was the next hurdler. Her trip to the Pan Am games in Buenos Aires, Argentina was her first out of the country, the first time on a plane and first national team. By 1952, she had risen to one of the best three hurdlers in the world, but injuries prevented her from qualifying for the Olympics. She continued to participate in Masters athletics but eventually retired from the sport because she kept getting injured."

His scientific research included mineralogical analysis of meteorites, and studies of contact-metamorphic mineralization in the Alpine region of central Europe. He also conducted investigations on the origin of the sulfidic ore deposit at Silberberg in the Bavarian Forest, as well as the genesis of graphite deposits near Passau. Through the use of polarizing microscopy and thin sectioning, he determined numerous new minerals."

  "text" : "Edgar Snyder (born September 6, 1941) is a Pittsburgh-area personal injury lawyer. Born in Connellsville, Pennsylvania to Jewish Polish and Russian immigrants, Snyder attended Penn State University and was the captain of the school's debate team. Following his graduation from the University of Pittsburgh School of Law in 1966, he served as a public defender for Allegheny County, Pennsylvania. He opened his first law office in Duquesne, Pennsylvania and initially worked in criminal defense and represented high-profile clients in highly publicized cases. In the 1980s, he expanded his practice into personal injury cases, driving a van around western Pennsylvania to meet with clients. Snyder's ex-wife, Sandy, worked as his firm's former marketing director and helped expand his firm's reach through advertising. Snyder credits her with being the driving force behind his image. The advertisements helped propel Snyder's profile to the \"near-saturation point,\" with an estimated 98% name recognition. According to Snyder, Sandy's \"mantra\" has been \"we're going to make you a brand.\" One of the signatures in his television commercials is pointing his finger at the camera and saying, \"There's never a fee unless we get money for you.\" This slogan emphasized the firm's use of contingency fees, where the firm only collects fees in the event of a legal victory. Snyder was rated \"AV,\" the highest possible rating, by Martindale-Hubbell and was selected for inclusion in the 2004-2010 editions of Pennsylvania \"Super Lawyers\". Snyder's firm, Edgar Snyder & Associates, employs over 130 lawyers and staff. Snyder no longer personally takes on cases, citing his notoriety as being potentially detrimental to his clients. Although he has since continued to oversee and direct the operations of his practice outside of the courtroom, it was reported in 2009 that he was beginning the process of retirement, but that he would continue to run the company for a few years. Outside of his practice, Snyder has hosted a weekly live call-in show on PCNC called \"The Law and You,\" and reports spending \"30 to 40 percent\" of his time volunteering and traveling for various organizations, especially those focused on the Jewish communities in Pittsburgh, Israel, and the former Soviet Union. In 2014, he transitioned from partner to founder, of counsel and retired shareholder.. He and his wife began divorce proceedings in 2014."

He entered College from Boston, where he was born, and graduated from Yale College in 1847. On graduating studied law in the office of the Hon. Rufus Choate. Being admitted to the bar in 1849, he commenced practice in the same city, where he continued until the war. He was prominent in State politics, and a member of both houses of the Massachusetts Legislature. During his residence in Massachusetts, he published The Golden Age of American Oratory (Boston, 1857), and Reminiscences of Rufus Choate (N. Y, 1860). He was also a contributor to some of the leading literary journals. On the breaking out of the American Civil War, Col. Parker (having acquired his itle from his position on the staff of Gov. Nathaniel P. Banks) entered, the service as Captain on Gen. Butler's staff. Later he was Adjutant General and Chief of Staff of Gen. Martindale during the time that the latter commanded the Department of Washington. At the close of the war he settled in N. Y., and went into business in Wall St. Not being particularly successful he took charge of the American Literary Bureau of Reference, and was thus engaged at the time of his death, at the Everett House in New York City, March 30. 1868, aged 42 years. He left a wife.  This article incorporates public domain material from the Yale Obituary Record."

  "text" : "Edward Milton \"Ed\" Buckner (born March 8, 1946) is an American atheist activist who served as president of the organization American Atheists from 2008 to 2010. He was succeeded in this post by David Silverman. He served as executive director for the Council for Secular Humanism from 2001 to 2003 and was once the Council's southern director. As treasurer of the Atlanta Freethought Society, he led a protest at a 2007 rally organized by Georgia Governor Sonny Perdue to pray for rain. Buckner is currently a national board member for American Atheists. Buckner and his son, Michael E. Buckner, wrote In Freedom We Trust: An Atheist Guide to Religious Liberty published by Prometheus Books in late 2012. Buckner was born in Fitzgerald, Georgia to an Episcopal clergyman father. He received his B.A. from Rice University in 1967 and his M. Ed. and Ph.D. (in educational leadership, 1983) from Georgia State University. Dr. Buckner married his wife Lois Diane Bright Buckner in 1968, and the two gave birth to their child Michael Edward Buckner in 1970. Buckner was on the debate and football teams at Clear Creek High School (League City, Texas); though he left the h.s. in 1963 to attend Rice, he came back to graduate from CCHS in 1964. Dr. Buckner has traveled across the United States and into the United Kingdom, voicing his support regarding freethought, secular humanism and the separation of state and church. Ed Buckner's specialized topics in his presentations as a public speaker include \"In Freedom We Trust\" (debunking the notion of the United States being a Christian nation), \"Atheism, Not Godliness\" (providing support for atheism), \"Secularism Across America\" (a discussion regarding national organizations and their relationships between one another) among others. He is currently available for public speaking requests under Secular Student Alliance, an educational non-profit organization.He has appeared often in the media circle as well, defending the civil liberties of Atheists and the separation of state and church on notable news outlets including CBS Evening News, Fox News, the Michael Medved Show, CNN, and the national CBS Radio News. Buckner, in May 2013, discovered Bibles in a cabin in a Georgia State Park. He responded by having atheist literature donated to be available alongside the bibles. Dr. Buckner has affiliations with many organizations that include the American Civil Liberties Union, the American United for Separation of Church and State, the Council for Secular Humanism, the Democratic Party and Freedom From Religion Foundation."

  "text" : "Jacob Mogensen, or Ebbe Ulfeldt (c. 1600 – c. 1670), was the brother of the Danish naval officer Corfits Ulfeldt who became a landscape painter in Delft. According to the RKD he was a registered pupil of Jacob Vosmaer. He is probably the \"Delvenaar\" referred to as \"Ugaart\", in Arnold Houbraken's  Schouburg. According to Houbraken, Ugaart Delvenaar was a good landscape painter who lived in the same period as Jan Verkolje.In his biographical sketch of Verkolje, Houbraken mentions another Dane, Henrik Steenwinkel, who was a Verkolje pupil. He wrote a biographical sketch for a Steenwinkel who worked for Christian IV of Denmark in 1640. Christian IV's twin daughters Leonora Christina and Hedevig were Ebbe's cousins and he married Hedevig in 1642. This court painter Steenwinkel that Houbraken refers to was probably Morten Steenwinkel, the later teacher of Bernhard Keil. Possibly Morten and Henrik were the same person or brothers travelling together, but all these men would have known and consorted with each other as Danish compatriots in the small painter circles of Delft and Amsterdam."

  "text" : "Elma Mary Williams was an author from the United Kingdom. She was born in Moseley, Birmingham, in 1913 and educated at St John's Convent School. Having previously written several thrillers and romances, she became nationally well-known during the 1960s and early 70s for her books describing the animal sanctuary she had established on a farm at Tre'r Ddol near Machynlleth in Wales. Valley of Animals (1963) was a best-seller and was followed by several others, such as Animals under my Feet (1965, illustrated by Barry Driscoll), leading to a number of radio and television appearances. Williams, a Roman Catholic who said she had drawn inspiration from St Francis of Assisi, later planned to develop a community where pensioners could retire along with domestic pets who they would otherwise not be allowed to keep. After initial planning setbacks she gained permission to proceed, but died in 1971 before the plans were fully realised. The trust she set up initially planned to open a therapeutic facility on the site, but it was later sold and the last tenant, Winifred Berry, was asked to leave in 1975. In 1967 the composer Ian Parrott wrote a piece called Pant Glas Idyll inspired by Williams' farm. Her books were published as by Elma M Williams: Fiction: The Waiting Years (1957) House with Loving Walls (1958) To Africa – the Bride (1958) The Fifth Lake (1959) Something of the World (1960)Love in a Mist (1960) Strange Legacy (1961) Escape to Death (1961) The Valley (1961)Tomorrow a Stranger (1962) The Winking Cat (1963)Owls Do Cry (1964) The Shaft of Light (1965)Where is Sylvia?

  "text" : "Ernst Moritz Hess (20 March 1890—14 September 1983) was a baptized German Jew who served in the Imperial German Army during the First World War. He commanded the company of the Bavarian Reserve Infantry Regiment 16 in which Adolf Hitler served during the war. During the inter-war period he served as a judge before being forced out of office after the passing of the Nuremberg Laws by the Nazis in 1935, as he was classified as a \"full-blooded Jew\" due to his mother being Jewish, even though he was baptised a Protestant. He emigrated with his family to Bolzano in Italy to escape Nazi persecution but was eventually forced to move back to Germany, though as a former war comrade of Hitler's he was granted protection and some privileges for a while. However, his privileges were removed in 1941 and he spent the rest of the war as a forced labourer; his sister died in Auschwitz but his mother managed to escape to Switzerland in 1945. Following the war he began a new career in railway management and was awarded the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany for his services to the Deutsche Bundesbahn."

  "text" : "Ennio Guarnieri (Rome, 12 October 1930) is an Italian cinematographer. He has been regular contributor to the films of Mauro Bolognini and Franco Zeffirelli, and has worked on many occasions with Vittorio De Sica, Marco Ferreri and Lina Wertmüller. Born in Rome, Guarnieri abandoned his studies and worked as an assistant cinematographer of Anchise Brizzi from 1949 to 1956. He debuted as director of photography in 1962 with I giorni contati by Elio Petri. In the late sixties, for his ability to portray actresses, Guarnieri became a trusted cinematographer for stars such as Virna Lisi, Sylva Koscina and Tina Aumont, for which he made extensive use of soft focus, backlight and scrims. His work in Mauro Bolognini's L'assoluto naturale (1969), starring Sylva Koscina, was referred as \"one of the cornerstones of Italian photography in the sixties\". For his work in Vittorio De Sica's The Garden of the Finzi-Continis (1970) he was nominated to BAFTA Award for Best Cinematography. The first collaboration with Franco Zeffirelli, Brother Sun, Sister Moon (1972), earned him his first Silver Ribbon for best cinematography; he was awarded with a second Silver Ribbon ten years later again with a film directed by Zeffirelli, La traviata. From the eighties onward Guarnieri focused on television and advertising."

Inscription on his tombstone: Here rests in the hope of a joyful resurrection the mortal remains of Edgeworth Ussher, Esq., whose devotion to his sovereign and exertions in the cause of his country at a critical period in the history of Canada marked him out as an object of the vengeance of the enemies of peace and good order, by whom he was cruelly assassinated on the night of 16 Nov., 1838, in his own house near Chippawa, at the early age of 34 years, leaving a wife and four children to mourn their irreparable loss."

In 1228 she married Landgrave Henry Raspe of Thuringia, the later anti-king of Germany. The marriage remained childless. Elisabeth died in 1231, at the age of 25, after three years of marriage. After her death, Henry married Gertrude of Babenberg and after Gertrude's death to Beatrix of Brabant. All three of his marriages were childless and after his death, the Emperor enfeoffed Thuringia to Henry III, the son of Henry Raspe's sister Jutta."

  "text" : "Elizabeth Weber (born June 18, 1923) is the pen-name of Elizabeth Marais (née Elizabeth Olivier). She flourished during a short, intense period of high-quality literary production in Afrikaans between the years 1949 and 1952 (see Bibliography below), after which, apart from translations of children’s literature from English into Afrikaans, and nursery stories in Afrikaans published sometime thereafter, she disappeared from public view. She was born on June 18, 1923 in Germiston, a small city on the East Rand, to the east of Johannesburg. She matriculated in 1939 from the local English high school, and thereafter took the BA degree at the University of the Witwatersrand with Afrikaans, English and Classics as majors. After a year at a teachers’ training college, she taught Afrikaans until the end of 1947, when she left to work in radio-broadcasting at the Afrikaans Language section of the BBC in London. After a three-year stay abroad, she returned to Johannesburg to an office job with a publisher and book distribution organization, probably the now defunct APB (Afrikaans Pers-Boekhandel) whose headquarters were at 769 Joubert Street in Johannesburg, South Africa. Significantly, the author published her entire oeuvre through APB. She then returned to teaching, after which nothing more is recorded of her work or whereabouts. She was married to Mr. Sarel Marais, and had two sons of that union. She also had one brother, the Reverend Phil Olivier of Cape Town, who was also an author, and a younger sister who dedicated her life to music She received honourable mention from the scions of Afrikaans literary critique, Nienaber, Senekal, and Bothma, who, writing in the early 1950s, stated, “... amongst the many writers (especially authoresses) in the field of complex love relationships, Elizabeth Weber, with her understanding of how complex relationships develop, and her gift for being able to express ‘the relative’ in human relations, has produced substantive literary material ...”."

A renowned preacher, his works were frequently published and included an exhortation to frequent communion translated into Welsh. Amongst other achievements he established a dynasty of prominent ecclesiastics and literary figures closely integrated into the Protestant squirearchy in the west of Ireland. He died in office on 23 July 1741, aged 82. His sons were Edward Synge (bishop of Elphin) and Nicholas Synge, (bishop of Killaloe)."

  "text" : "Edward Synge (1691–1762) was an Anglican bishop in the Church of Ireland who was the Bishop of Clonfert and Kilmacduagh (1730–1732), Bishop of Cloyne (1732–1734), Bishop of Ferns and Leighlin (1734–1740) and Bishop of Elphin (1740–1762). His father was Edward Synge, Archbishop of Tuam. His grandfather was Edward Synge, Bishop of Cork, Cloyne and Ross and his brother Nicholas Synge Bishop of Killaloe. He was educated at Trinity College, Dublin, obtaining a Master of Arts degree in 1712 and a Doctorate of Divinity in 1728. He was briefly Provost of Tuam and Chancellor of St Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin, before he was nominated the Bishop of Clonfert and Kilmacduagh on 14 May 1730 and consecrated on 7 June 1730. He was subsequently translated to Cloyne on 22 March 1732, then to Ferns and Leighlin on 8 February 1734, and finally to Elphin on 15 May 1740. Synge's musical ability made a strong impression on Handel when the composer was in Dublin; Handel referred to Synge as 'a Nobleman very learned in Musick'. Synge was in attendance at the first performance of Handel's Messiah and his written comments on the performance are quoted in Richard Luckett's Handel's Messiah: a celebration (1992). Synge is particularly well known for his 221 letters to his daughter Alicia (1733-1807) the only survivor out of the six children of the Bishop and his wife Jane Curtis (d. 1737) whom he married in 1720. These are principally taken up with advice to Alicia whom Mary Delany said was being 'brought up like a princess' . There is almost no aspect of the young girl's life upon which her father did not comment including dress, health, diet, exercise and behaviour in social situations. His principal concern was with her education generally and specifically her ability to write letters well; his advice to her on this score was to copy Swift for grammar and punctuation. These letters also provide valuable insight into domestic life and the lives of servants. The bequest of these letters to the Library of Trinity College, the University of Dublin, by Synge's descendant Marie-Louise Jenner, has revolutionised eighteenth-century Irish social and women's history. Synge died in office on 27 January 1762, aged 71. His daughter Alicia married Joshua Cooper MP (1732–1800) of Markree Castle in County Sligo. She was said to have a fortune of £50,000."

  "text" : "Duke Erik Birgersson (c. 1250 – 17 December 1275) was a Swedish duke. His father was Birger Jarl, the ruler of Sweden from 1250–66, and his mother was Ingeborg of Sweden. In the conflict between his elder brothers Valdemar and Magnus he sided with Magnus. When Magnus had won and been proclaimed king in 1275, he made Erik duke of Småland. Erik was buried at Varnhem together with his father and his father’s second wife. According to the Magnúss saga lagabœtis, Erik called himself \"Eirek allz-ekki\" because he had no title. Only when Magnus III became king did Erik change his title and call himself \"Duke\". When Birger Jarl's grave in Varnhem Abbey was opened and examined in May 2002, osteologist Torbjörn Ahlström from Lund University confirmed that the tomb contained the remains of three people – probably Birger Jarl, his second wife Matilda of Holstein, and Erik. His father's skeleton shows that he was about 172 cm long, while Erik was a few inches longer but with a much thinner build. His muscular attachments were poorly developed. In the vertebrae and sternum there were some signs of pathological changes, and he would have been 25 years old when he died in 1275."

  "text" : "Eric James Hooglund (born March 18, 1944) is an American political scientist and an expert on contemporary Iran. Since 2010 he has been a Senior Research Professor at the Center for Middle Eastern Studies at Lund University in Sweden. Hooglund was born in Waterville, Maine, and was educated at the University of Maine at Orono, from where he revived a BA in history in 1966. He was a Peace Corps Volunteer in Iran (1966–68) and subsequently undertook graduate studies at Johns Hopkins University under the pre-eminent scholar of Islamic law, Majid Khadduri, receiving a Ph.D in international relations and Middle Eastern Studies in 1975. During his doctoral field research in Iran in the early 1970s, he worked with Hamid Enayat, Nader Afshar Naderi, Javad Safinejad and Mostafa Azkia. His dissertation on the politics of land reform became his first published book, Land and Revolution in Rural Iran, 1960-1980, and it shows the influence of the ideas of James Scott, Eric Wolf, and Barrington Moore, Jr. on his approach to the study of peasant societies and rural resistance movements. Hooglund has a long-standing commitment to the development of Middle Eastern studies as an academic discipline. For more than a decade he was a member of the editorial collective of Middle East Report published by MERIP, later was editor of the Middle East Journal and since 1995 has been editor of Middle East Critique. He also has worked for several Middle East-focused non-governmental organizations, including the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, the National Security Archive, and the Institute for Palestine Studies. His teaching experience includes Bates College and Bowdoin College in Maine, Ohio State University, the University of California, Berkeley, St. Antony’s College, Oxford, Shiraz University in Iran, and Middle East Technical University in Turkey. Hooglund has published several books and over 100 articles during his professional career. In his work Hooglund examines diverse aspects of Iranian culture, government, history, international relations, literature, migration, political economy, sociology, and religion. Although trained as a political scientist his best-known work falls in the category of rural political economy and sociology."

  "text" : "Eliza Logan Wood (born Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, August 7, 1827; died New York City, New York, January 15, 1872) was an American stage actress and member of the Logan family of actors and writers. Probably the oldest of the eight talented children of Irish-American actor Cornelius Ambrosius Logan (1806-1853), Eliza was educated at a girls' school in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. She made her debut on the stage January 28, 1841 as Young Norval in \"Douglas\" at the Walnut Street Theatre in Philadelphia. Her father had moved the family to Cincinnati to manage the National Theatre there, and she continued her career there. She later toured with her father, appearing with success in the American South and West in dramas such as Shiel's Evadne. In June 1850 she made her first appearance in New York as Pauline in \"The Lady of Lyons\" at the Bowery Theatre. She remained a headlining actress through the 1850s, while supporting her mother and younger siblings after the death of her father in 1853. The New York Times said she was \"a charming woman, a careful actress, and played parts like Juliet and Ophelia with much feeling.\" Theater critic and historian T. Allston Brown called her \"one of the finest female representatives of the legitimate drama known to the American stage\" She married George Wood, a theater owner and manager, in 1859 and retired from touring. She helped Wood manage his theatre properties. Eliza Logan was a member of a family notable in the American theatre and elsewhere. Her brother Thomas (1829-1906) was a prominent Cincinnati lawyer. Her younger brother Cornelius Ambrose Logan, (1832–99), was a physician, writer, and diplomat. Middle sisters Celia (1837-1904) and Olive (1839-1909) were notable actresses and writers. The younger sisters Alice, Grace, and Kate also appeared on the stage."

Emil Mollenhauer was born in Brooklyn, New York, on August 4, 1855, to Frederick Mollenhauer of Erfurt, Germany, who was himself a violinist. He attended public school in Brooklyn. He was a musical prodigy and was playing in the orchestra of Niblo's Garden in February 1864 before he was nine years old. From the age of sixteen he played in the orchestras of the Booth Theatre, where his uncle led the orchestra, that of Theodore Thomas at Central Park Garden, and the Damrosch Orchestra, where he also played piano. He left New York City for Boston where he played at the Bijou Opera House. He played first violin in the Boston Symphony Orchestra from 1884 to 1888. He turned to conducting and led the Germania Orchestra for several years and then led several annual tours as head of the Boston Festival Orchestra, leading concerts with such notable soloists as Emma Calvé, Nellie Melba, and Eugène Ysaÿe. He became conductor of Boston's Handel and Haydn Society in 1899 and held that post until his death. Mollenhauer married Mary Laverty, a professional singer. He died at his home in Boston, Massachusetts, on December 10, 1927. He was scheduled to conduct a concert the day following his death."

According to a profile in Altvariety, Beloff is also a Certified Hypnotist and has her own private practice in New York City. Beloff founded the practice Inside Hypnosis in New York City. On Feb 16, 2013, Elena Beloff uploaded a video of a gay man standing up to a homophobic subway \"preacher.\" The \"Gay Subway Hero\" caught the attention of the Internet and the media and went viral gaining over 800,000 views in just a few days. In February 2014, Elena Beloff and veteran science fiction writer John Zakour collaborated on \"Quantum Voyeur,\" an interactive novel about time traveling tourists. The novella was published by Serealites Press. Beloff hypnotized 100 people at one time for the film \"The Crowd,\" which was shot in January, 2015 by Darius Khondji. Beloff was cast at the suggestion of Advanced Hypnosis Center's Jeffrey Rose. \"The Crowd\" was shown at French artist Philippe Parreno's art installation \"H{N)Y P N(Y}OSIS\" at New York City's Park Avenue Armory. The show opened on June 11, 2015."

He also served as the president of the American Library Association in 1913-14. Anderson worked with Andrew Carnegie to create the Carnegie Library in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in 1895, and served as the director of that library until 1904, when he stepped down because he could not afford to support his family on the salary. After a two-year stint (1906–08) as the head of the New York State Library and Library School, Anderson became the director of the New York Public Library in 1909, a position he held until 1934. As a library leader, Anderson was best remembered for the librarian education programs he established in both Pittsburgh and New York City. Anderson was married, with at least two children, daughters Charlotte and Cecile.He died in Evanston, Illinois."

  "text" : "Civil engineer and graduate of MIT (Massachusetts Institute of Technology), Emmanuel de Buretel was appointed in 1986 CEO of Virgin Publishing France by Richard Branson and went on to sign artists such as Youssou Ndour, Cheb Khaled, Mano Negra, Les Négresses Vertes.He was instrumental in the emergence of the hip hop genre in France with successes of IAM, Tonton David and many more. In 1991, he created Delabel Records and signed artists such as Keziah Jones, IAM, Tonton David, les Rita Mitsouko, Rhoff, -M- and many others. From 1992, he was at the head of Virgin Records France where he created Delabel, Source, Labels, a collection of creative independent cells under the “labels” banner which was considered to be one of the most credible independent platforms in Europe and an alternative to major companies.He brought artists like Manu Chao, Air, Daft Punk to international attention when he took over at the head of Virgin Continental Europe back in 1998. During the same period, Ken Berry, former CEO of EMI Music Worldwide, let him set up his publishing company Delabel Editions. Emmanuel de Buretel signed writers and composers including Louise Attaque, Daft Punk, Air, Doc Gyneco, Cheb Mami, Madredeus. He also acquired the catalogs Sidonie Crescelles (Serge Gainsbourg, Julien Clerc, Jacques Brel...) and Vanessa Paradis (first two albums). He became President of EMI Continental Europe in London in 2001, at the head of a group of 21 subsidiaries within which he developed a catalogue of European artists such as M83, Daft Punk, Tiziano Ferro, Lene Marlin or Royksopp, and signed David Guetta under Virgin France. He was instrumental in the acquisition of the independent label Mute by EMI. In 2002, taking inspiration from the Mercury Prize, he creates the Prix Constantin which rewards young artists for having imprinted their talent on the world every year. In disagreement with the vision of EMI, he left the company in March 2004 in order to create Because Group, a new independent London and Paris based structure, involved in all aspects of the music industry : • Because Music : musical and audiovisual production (Christine and The Queens, Major Lazer, Camille, Selah Sue, Metronomy, Charlotte Gainsbourg, Justice, Amadou & Mariam, Manu Chao, Prince, Moby...)• Because Editions : publishing (Daft Punk, Foals, Stromae, Christine and The Queens, Danza Kuduro, Thomas Dutronc, NTM, Sebastian, Justice, Cassius) sub-publishing (Bob Marley, Imagem, Notting Hill...). Along with Xavier Niel, he bought out Jeune Musique, Claude François' catalog including the song « My Way ».• Corida : live production (Manu Chao, Radiohead, Daft Punk, Eric Clapton, Christine and The Queens, Selah Sue, Catherine Ringer, Rammstein, Justice...) and management (Manu Chao, Catherine Ringer)• La Cigale / La Boule Noire : concert halls (Paris). He was knighted as a member of the French Ordre des Arts et des Lettres. 2015 sees the launch of Because Publishing in the U.S., the nomination of Emmanuel de Buretel at the Board of Merlin, his appointment as President of SPPF (neighboring societies for independent labels in France), his appointment as Knight of Legion d'Honneur."

  "text" : "Edward Tyrer, QPM, CPM (Traditional Chinese: 戴磊華, formerly 邰華, 19 September 1917 – 24 August 2004) was a senior British colonial police officer who was Commissioner of Police, Hong Kong, from December 1966 to July 1967. When the leftist riots broke out in May 1967, he was unable to command the Force because he had been on vacation leave in Britain. Shortly after returning in mid-June, he suddenly flew to London on 14 July to report the latest development to the Commonwealth Office. And on 21 July, he was approved for early retirement on \"health grounds\", leaving many speculations as to the real reasons behind his decision. A few pieces of confidential official documents declassified and released in 2012 revealed that Tyrer was instructed to apply for immediate early retirement because he had refused to follow the instructions of the acting governor Michael Gass to suppress the riots. Tyrer joined the Trinidad police force as a police cadet in 1937 and was promoted to the rank of Assistant Superintendent the next year. During World War II, he saw active service in the Army from 1939 to 1942 before serving briefly in British India's police force. In September 1945, he joined the British provisional military administration of Hong Kong as a captain, handling policing matters in the territories. He was later appointed an Assistant Superintendent of the Hong Kong Police in 1946, an Assistant Commissioner in 1953, and Deputy Commissioner in 1963. He was sent to Britain for advanced police training in 1952, 1956 and 1963 prior to becoming Commissioner."

  "text" : "Enoch W. Eastman (April 15, 1810 – January 9, 1885) was an American politician. Born in Deerfield, New Hampshire, Enoch Worthen Eastman studied law in New Hampshire and was admitted to the bar. He then moved to Iowa. Although a Democrat, he distinguished himself the first year of his residence in Iowa by taking the stump against the adoption of the Constitution recently framed by his party and helped to defeat it at the election. Under this Constitution the boundaries of the State would have extended north taking in a large portion of southeastern Minnesota and would have excluded all of the Missouri slope west of a line running north and south from near the west side of Kossuth and Ringgold counties. Enoch W. Eastman, Theodore S. Parvin and Frederick D. Mills, all Democrats and young men, warmly opposed the adoption of such boundaries and influenced enough of their Democratic associates to unite with the Whigs to defeat the Constitution. This was one of the most important public services ever rendered the State. When Iowa was called upon to contribute a stone for the Washington monument in 1850, Enoch W. Eastman was the author of the inscription placed upon it: “Iowa—Her affections like the rivers of her borders, flow to an inseparable Union.” Mr. Eastman removed to Oskaloosa in 1847 and to Eldora in 1857. When the Civil War began he left the Democratic party and united with the Republicans. Eastman was elected Lieutenant Governor of Iowa serving under Governor William M. Stone. In 1883, Eastman was elected to the Iowa State Senate and died while in office."

Emerson Samuels was born on 22 August 1928 in Nabacalis on the East Coast of Demerara, where he spent his childhood.He studied at the Golden Grove Methodist School, where one of his masters recognized his talent and helped him with drawing.When aged about 15 he traveled to Georgetown with a portfolio of his drawings to apply for work with the British Guiana Lithographic Company, and was hired as an apprentice. Here he learned the skills of offset printing and lithography, and learned technique from other artists with whom he worked.Around 1949 he joined the Guianese Art Group.Later he studied under Edward Rupert Burrowes at the Working People's Art Class (WPAC).In 1951 he won the WPAC's \"Picture of the Year\" award with his painting The Workers, which shows men at work on the new Lithographic Company building. Samuels left the Lithographic Company in 1961, and obtained a position with the Ministry of Agriculture, where he illustrated various publications for farmers.He was seconded to the Ministry of Information, where he continued to work as an illustrator. then in 1973 joined the Ministry of Education.He worked with the Ministry of Education for over 25 years.He designed several commemorative stamps for the Guyana Post Office, including one showing Clive Lloyd, Guyana and West Indies cricket captain, one of Cuffy, the hero of the 1763 Guyanese slave revolt, and one to celebrate 100 years of teaching in Guyana.He illustrated many books for use in schools.He also taught part-time at the Burrowes School of Art until 1999. Samuels continued to create paintings, including the Metamorphosis series in the late 1970s, always experimenting with different styles.Although his work was displayed in several group exhibitions, he never held a solo exhibition.The National Collection holds several of his works, including Self-portrait (1959), Untitled Abstract (1966), and Industrial Image and Forward Thrust, which won at the National Exhibitions of 1978 and 1982. His portrait of E R Burrowes hangs at the Burrowes School of Art.In 1997 the Guyana government gave Samuels the Golden Arrowhead of Achievement for his contributions to art.In 2003 he was Curriculum Artist Illustrator at the National Centre for Educational Research and Development (NCERD).While on vacation in New York, Emerson Samuels died at the Brookdale Medical Center in Brooklyn from a massive heart attack on 6 August 2003."

In April 1952 he and his wife bought a cottage in Llangennech near Llanelli, a district where nine out of every ten of the population are Welsh-speaking. All the councillors on the rural council which controls Llangennech are Welsh-speaking: so too are the council officials. Therefore when a note demanding the local rates arrived from ‘The Rural District Council of Llanelly' Mrs. Beasley wrote to ask for it in Welsh. It was refused. She refused to pay the rates until she got it. She and Mr. Beasley were summoned more than a dozen times to appear before the magistrates' court. Mr. and Mrs. Beasley insisted that the court proceedings should be in Welsh. Three times did the bailiffs carry off furniture from their home, the furniture being worth much more than the rates which were demanded. This went on for eight years. In 1960 Mr. and Mrs. Beasley received a bilingual note demanding the local rates from" ],

Frost began studying flight in 1868 and built a large steam-powered flying machine with both fixed and flapping wings from 1870 to 1877. Frost had intended to have a 20-25 hp steam engine but the actual engine with 5 hp was not powerful enough to lift the ornithopter from the ground. The experiment cost Frost £1000. In collaboration with several colleagues he started another large similar craft in 1902 with an internal combustion engine. It lifted from the ground in 1904. A wing from this craft is displayed in London's Science Museum. Frost had been a member of the Aeronautical Society since 1875 and became its president from 1908 to 1911."

  "text" : "Estelle Naomi Trebert Griswold (June 8, 1900 – August 13, 1981) was a civil rights activist and feminist most commonly known as a defendant in what became the Supreme Court case Griswold v. Connecticut, in which contraception for married couples was legalized in the state of Connecticut, setting the precedent of the right to privacy. Griswold served as the Executive Director of Planned Parenthood in New Haven when she and Yale professor C. Lee Buxton opened a birth control clinic in New Haven in an attempt to change the Connecticut law banning contraception. Their actions set into motion legislation that resulted in both Poe v. Ullman and Griswold v. Connecticut. Griswold's personal role in both cases was vital to achieving success and starting a women's rights revolution that went on to aid the support for such cases as Roe v. Wade."

  "text" : "Edna Henry Lee Turpin (1867–1952) was an American author. She was born on July 26, 1867, at Echo Hill, Mecklenburg County, Virginia. She was the daughter of Edward Henry Turpin and Petronella Lee Turpin, but her father died of tuberculosis four months before she was born. Two siblings, Mary Wilson Turpin and Edward Henry Turpin both died in infancy before Edna was born. She spent her childhood on the family farm with her mother and her older brother, Henderson Lee Turpin (1861–1957). She began writing at an early age and, during her fifteenth year, her first short story was accepted for publication. She later graduated from Hollins College. Over her lifetime he was a member of numerous professional organizations and societies. She was a Presbyterian. She never married but rather devoted her life to literary pursuits. She died on June 8, 1952, and was buried in Hollywood Cemetery in Richmond, Virginia. In addition to her own writing, she also edited and selected a number of collections which included, amongst others, a collection of Grimm's Fairy Tales for primary reader grades in the English language and \"The Gold-Bug and Other Selections from the Works of Edgar Allan Poe.\""

  "text" : "Ernst Hallier (15 November 1831, Hamburg – 19 December 1904, Dachau) was a German botanist and mycologist. As a young man he was trained as a gardener, later studying botany at the universities of Berlin, Jena and Göttingen. From 1858 he served as an instructor at the Pharmaceutical Institute in Jena, where in 1860 he obtained his habilitation. In 1865 he became an associate professor, resigning his professorship 19 years later (1884). Hallier claimed that many diseases were caused by fungi including cholera, typhoid and measles. He claimed that he had extracted the causal fungi from patients but other scientists found that this was merely a case of external contamination. His work was subsequently largely discredited after it was criticized by Heinrich Anton de Bary. In 1869 he founded the journal Zeitschrift für Parasitenkunde."

  "text" : "Elizabeth Cresswell (c. 1625 – c. 1698), also known as Mother Creswell and Madam Cresswell of Clerkenwell, was one of the most successful prostitutes and brothel keepers of the English seventeenth century. Starting with houses in Bartholomew Close, in the City of London and St Leonard's, Shoreditch, she built a widespread network of brothels across London, supplied with girls and women from across England. Her employees included the wives of soldiers pressed into service for Charles II and gentlewomen who had supported the Cavalier cause during the English Civil War and had since fallen on hard times. Her bawdy houses were favoured by King Charles and his court as well as powerful figures in government and city guilds. This position gave her a measure of immunity from prosecution and added to her profile as a caricature of iniquity and corruption. During the Bawdy House Riots of 1668, apprentices smashed up brothels across London, including those belonging to Cresswell. She is listed as one the addressers of the satirical Whores' Petition, sent to Lady Castlemaine, the King's courtesan. The letter requests help for the \"sister\" prostitutes who have had their livelihoods destroyed, asking that the brothels be rebuilt with money from the national tax coffers. Supporter of the prominent Whig, anti-Catholic, and anti-Carolean Thomas Player, Cresswell financed his political campaigns. In her final years she was attacked by both Protestants and Catholics: by Protestants for providing the royal court with whores, and by Catholics for financing Player's political rebellion. Cresswell occupied a rare position in seventeenth-century England, as a person of common birth who rose to a position of high status as an independently wealthy, unmarried woman running a substantial business enterprise. She figures in a wide assortment of contemporary literature and songs, in ballads, poems, broadsides, novels and party pamphlets, often portrayed as a caricature of vice, a satirical figure of street commentary, sexual theatre and political bawdry."

  "text" : "Edward Hutchinson (c. 1564 - 1632) was a mercer and a resident of Lincolnshire, England, most noted for the careers of his children in New England. While his father and several of his uncles and brothers became prominent as clergymen, aldermen, sheriffs, and mayors in the city of Lincoln, Edward focused his efforts on his business after moving to the town of Alford. Remarkably, not a single record for him has been found in Alford, other than his burial and the baptisms of his 11 children, but he likely gained a considerable estate, and his children married into prominent families. What was most exceptional about Edward Hutchinson occurred following his 1632 death. Beginning in 1634, five of his nine surviving children and his widow immigrated to New England, and all six of them were exiled from the Massachusetts Bay Colony as a result of the events of the Antinomian Controversy from 1636 to 1638. From Boston two of his children went south and became founding settlers of the Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations, and three of them, with his widow, went north to establish Exeter in the Province of New Hampshire, and then proceeded to Wells, Maine. Because of their involvement in the controversy, his children had a disproportionately large role in the establishment of these new settlements in New England."

  "text" : "Eloise Jelinek (February 2, 1924, Dallas - December 21, 2007, Tucson) was an American linguist specializing in the study of syntax. She became particularly known for her Pronominal Argument Hypothesis of syntax based on data from the Navajo language, which holds that in some languages the pronominal affixes on the verb should be considered the syntactic arguments of the verbs, rather than the free pronouns, which should only be considered adjuncts. Through her work on many endangered languages she demonstrated that less-studied languages often challenged the theories of generative linguistics, and she worked to develop ways of integrating this data into the generative paradigm. Among the languages that she worked on are the Straits Salish languages Samish and Lummi, as well as Navajo, Choctaw, and Yaqui. Her 1981 doctoral dissertation at the University of Arizona was titled \"On Defining Categories: AUX and PREDICATE in Colloquial Egyptian Arabic\"."

  "text" : "Egon Mayer (December 1944 – January 30, 2004) was an American sociologist and professor at Brooklyn College. He wrote a number of books on Jewish culture and history, including From Suburb to Shtetl (1979), The Court Jew: A Contribution to the History of Absolutism in Europe (1984), and Love and Tradition: Marriage Between Jews and Christians (1985). Mayer was born in Switzerland to Eugene and Hedy Mayer, Hungarian-Jewish parents who were passengers on the Kastner train during the Holocaust. Mayer's mother was pregnant with him at the time. The train left Budapest in June 1944 after Rudolf Kastner, a Hungarian lawyer, negotiated with Adolf Eichmann to allow 1,684 Jews safe passage to Switzerland. The passengers arrived in Switzerland in two stages – one in August 1944, the second in December – the month in which Mayer was born – after a stop at the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp. Mayer created and maintained a website in Kastner's memory. Mayer's family returned to Budapest when the war ended, then emigrated to the United States in 1956. Mayer studied at Brooklyn College (City University of New York) and the New School for Social Research, obtaining his Ph.D in sociology in 1975 from Rutgers University."

  "text" : "Emma C. de Guzman (born December 8, 1949) is a Filipino Roman Catholic widow, laywoman, stigmatist and claimed Marian visionary. She is the co-founder, along with the late Sister Soledad Gaviola, of the Catholic lay group association La Pieta, dedicated to a Marian devotion under the title Mother of Love, Peace and Joy. Guzman claims to have first seen the Virgin Mary on the Feast of the Nativity of Mary in 1991. She is reputedly notable for her alleged Marian visions under trance, particularly the golden dust (Spanish: Escarchas, English: \"Frost\") which allegedly manifests on her face during her trances. She claims to have communicated with Jesus Christ, the Blessed Virgin Mary, various angels and souls seeking penitence and has been observed by various high ranking Filipino Catholic prelates, recorded in photographs and on live video. The group specifically seeks to promote prayer and peace to various nations through any particular Marian devotion. The La Pieta prayer group, along with its apparition, stigmata, and miraculous events are currently unapproved, though pending investigation by the Holy See. The group is openly tolerated and endorsed by various leading international bishops, including the former Apostolic Papal Nuncio to the Philippines, Archbishop Antonio Franco, Cardinal Jaime Lachica Sin, and Cardinal Francis Eugene George."

  "text" : "Emilio Veratti (24 March 1872, Varese – 24 February 1967) was an Italian anatomist and pathologist. He is known for his discovery of the sarcoplasmic reticulum. He studied medicine at the Universities of Pavia and Bologna, where he received his doctorate in 1896. Following graduation he worked for Camillo Golgi (1843-1926) at the Institute of General Pathology in Pavia. Here he distinguished himself by way of research in the fields of histology and microbiology. Eventually he attained the title of \"libero docente\" (equivalent of privat-docent) in histology and general pathology. In 1921 he established a bacteriology laboratory in the medical clinic at Pavia. In 1930 he was successor to Aldo Perroncito (1882-1929) as professor of general pathology, a position he kept until his retirement in 1942. In March 1902, he provided the first accurate description of the reticular network (sarcoplasmic reticulum) in skeletal muscle fibers. His published findings attracted little attention at the time, and as years passed by, his discovery was all but forgotten. In 1961 \"Veratti's reticulum\" was re-discovered through the use of electron microscopy."

His principal works include a book on lichens native to Africa, Lichenaea Africana (1890–91), and studies of a lichenized genus of fungi known as Sticta. With Alexander Braun (1805–1877) and Gottlob Ludwig Rabenhorst (1806–1881), he was editor of the exsiccatae Die Characeen Europas. Stizenberger is the taxonomic author of the genus Anzia."

  "text" : "Everett S. Sherman (1831-1897) was a covered bridge builder in Ohio. He lived and built bridges in Delaware County then moved to Preble County after a storm destroyed many of its bridges. He revived a technology of Childs truss bridges, of which only a handful of examples—perhaps only seven according to a 2003 report—survive in the United States. The Childs truss was patented by Horace Childs in 1846. It never became popular, but, after its patent expired, was adopted by Sherman for bridges in Ohio late in the 1800s. Sherman adapted the Childs design to vary the size of beams according to loads carried by them, rather than using uniform beams. A number of his works are listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places. Works include: \n* Brubaker Covered Bridge, W of Gratis on Aukerman Creek Rd., Gratis, Ohio, NRHP-listed \n* Chambers Road Covered Bridge, 1.5 mi.

Miller arrived on Alcatraz on June 23, 1934 as a Correctional officer, and by the end of the decade had been promoted to Associate Warden. Miller was Associate Warden during numerous escape attempts at Alcatraz. He was once challenged by Henri Young who complained to Miller that the Alcatraz rules which he and Johnston insisted upon were violations of Bureau of Prisons guidelines. Miller responded, “You don't run Alcatraz. I run Alcatraz\", and later angrily refused Young a bible when he was in solitary confinement in D-Block. He departed Alcatraz in 1947 and was transferred to Leavenworth. He was married to Rosine (née Wahler) and lived on Alcatraz during his time as Associate Warden."

Welteke was nominated as president of Bundesbank on 12 May 1999, and his term began on 1 September 1999. The Bundesbank studied the possibility of insider trading in relation to the September 11 attacks. Welteke stated that the German researchers found “almost irrefutable proof of insider trading”, stating that “What we found makes us sure that people connected to the terrorists must have been trying to profit from this tragedy.” The introduction of the physical euro took place on December 31, 2001. Welteke visited Berlin with his family for the celebration, and his hotel stay was paid for by Dresdner Bank. In 2003, BMW, which owns a bank, paid for Welteke to spend a night on a yacht during the Monaco Grand Prix. Controversy over these incidents led to Welteke resigning from Bundesbank in April 2004. The Christian Democratic Union, then an opposition party, alleged that the German Finance Ministry had leaked details of Welteke's hotel bill. The government denied the allegations. Currently, Welteke is on the advisory board of OMFIF where he is regularly involved in meetings regarding the financial and monetary system."

  "text" : "Elliott Liu (born November 25, 1989 in Boston, Massachusetts, United States) is an American chess player from San Diego, California. Liu first earned distinction by winning the 2005 U.S. Under 16 Chess Championship, and with it a full four-year scholarship to the University of Maryland as a Freshman in high school. A year later, he then became the youngest player in the 2006 U.S. Chess Championship as a 16-year-old. In round 1, he surprised everybody by holding famous GM Alex Yermolinsky to a draw. Liu scored an even more impressive result the following day in round 2 by drawing Grandmaster Gregory Kaidanov, the third highest rated player in the United States at the time. Two weeks after the conclusion of the eventful tournament, \"Elliott Liu Day\" was proclaimed by the city of San Diego on April 25, 2006. Later that year in August, Liu won a gold medal at the 2006 Pan-American Chess Championship held in Cuenca, Ecuador. Upon graduating from The Bishop's School in 2008, he was a Standard-bearer for Tiger Woods and Rocco Mediate at the 2008 U.S. Open, witnessing Woods' most recent Major Championship victory. A couple months later, Liu matriculated at Stanford University. From 2003 through 2008, he was consistently ranked as one of the top five players in the United States for his age  and represented the U.S. in three World Youth Championships during that time period: Greece in 2004, France in 2005, and Turkey in 2007. Most recently, in January 2011 while studying abroad in Florence, Italy, Liu flew to New York City and ended up winning the \"Extreme Chess Championship,\" a filmed tournament that was released in a four-part series on YouTube, concluding on April 28, 2012. Currently, Liu has transitioned from competitive player to teacher of private students from around the world, producer of instructional video lessons for Chess.com, the world's most popular chess website, and host of \"Your Games Analyzed,\" a weekly live webcast that can be watched by any of Chess.com's 5.6 million members. To date, he has produced 25 instructional video lessons for Chess.com, garnering over 145,000 views."

  "text" : "Edgar Gretener (March 2, 1902 in Lucerne – October 21, 1958 in Zurich) was a Swiss electrical engineer. Gretener was the twelfth of 14 siblings. He studied electrical engineering at Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH Zurich), where he received his Ph.D. in 1929. He then became head of development at the Albiswerk factory in Zurich. In 1930, he worked as head of the telegraph laboratory of Siemens & Halske in Berlin. There he got in contact with Fritz Fischer (physicist), another Swiss engineer, working as a manager at the central research labs of Siemens. When Fritz Fischer got the call to become professor at the ETH Zurich in 1932, he made Gretener his chief assistant a few years later. Fischer invented the Eidophor video projection system. Gretener was in charge of its implementation. When World War II started, the Swiss authorities asked Gretener to develop an encryption device for teleprinters. For this purpose the Dr. Edgar Gretener AG was set up as a company in 1943. Gretener got absorbed by this new challenge. As his replacement, Hugo Thiemann continued the development of the Eidophor system at the ETH. When Fischer died unexpectely in 1947, Thiemann and the Eidophor project were transferred to Gretener's company. It now had two lines of R&D: encryption devices and Eidophor, which still needed development to make it a viable product. Finally, the marketing effort led to first contracts for this new wide-screen video projection system. The untimely death of Gretener in 1958 led to the renaming of his company, which continued under new ownership as GRETAG AG."

  "text" : "Eusebio Zuloaga González (Madrid, 15 December 1808 - Deusto, Bilbao 1898), was a Spanish gunsmith. He is considered the initiator of the art of modern damascening. He was the first Spanish artist who achieved an international reputation, participating in the first international exhibition, The Great Exhibition in London in 1851. He received several awards in Spain, England, France, and Belgium. Zuloaga was director of the Royal Armoury of Madrid. Zuloaga served as head of the Royal Factory of La Moncloa. Born in Madrid in 1808, he was the son of an Eibar gunsmith, Blas de Zuloaga, and his wife, Gabriela González. His father was a teacher at the Reales Fábricas de Armas de Placencia in the late eighteenth century. Zuloaga married Ramona Boneta, a specialist in electroplating. They had three sons, who were artists dedicated to painting, ceramics and metal. Daniel Zuloaga was considered to be one of the innovators of ceramic arts in Spain; his work was continued by his children Candida, Esperanza, Theodora and John. Guillermo Zuloaga worked in the shadow of his brother Daniel. Plácido Zuloaga, a damascening expert, was father of the painter Ignacio Zuloaga."

  "text" : "Ella Spira is a Grammy nominated composer and co-director of the London based production company, Sisters Grimm, the company behind the critically acclaimed, sell-out success INALA. Spira, the daughter of two artists from Gloucestershire and the eldest of six, learned piano, studied conducting, has worked in radio and was mentored by James Bond composer David Arnold. Her production company, Sisters Grimm, formed with former Royal Ballet dancer Pietra Mello-Pittman, creates large scale theatrical dance musicals, high-end videos and animations. Their previous theatrical spectacular, INALA - a Zulu ballet, premiered at the Edinburgh International Festival in 2014, opening at the largest theatre in Europe, The Edinburgh Playhouse, before moving on to London's prestigious Sadler's Wells Theatre for a week to a sell-out audience. The show continued its success during a major tour of some of the major concert halls around the UK which culminated in an invitation to perform an excerpt at the 2014 Royal Variety Performance, in the presence of Their Royal Highnesses The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge. Sisters Grimm then took the show international as it was programmed as part of the Chekhov International Festival 2015 in Moscow, Russia before returning for another successful UK tour as a co-production with ATG, the world’s largest theatre owning company, including back to the Sadler's Wells Theatre in London due to its success and phenomenal demand. In 2016, the music from INALA, composed by Ella Spira, was nominated for the Grammy Best World Music Album. Also in 2016, INALA was nominated for a Manchester Theatre Award for the Special Entertainment category. The overwhelming success of this first major dance production from Sisters Grimm has also led to the founders of Sisters Grimm, Ella Spira and Pietra Mello-Pittman, being nominated for the 2015 Women of the Future Awards in the Arts & Culture Category. Sisters Grimm has worked with major UK broadcasters including BBC, Channel 4 and ITV and have worked on campaigns such as, working in Los Angeles, United States of America on commercial ad campaigns and the UNICEF New Year’s Eve Campaign, broadcast over Christmas on Channel 4 and at London’s South Bank celebrations. Sisters Grimm is a client of United Kingdom Trade and Industry (“UKTI”) and are proud to be part of the GREAT Campaign representing Creativity in the United Kingdom. In 2015, UKTI asked Sisters Grimm to provide bespoke entertainment content for the GREAT reception at Lancaster House this year. Sisters Grimm is currently in production with the next major international theatrical production: Voices of the Amazon, A rainforest dance musical from the heart of Brazil, premiering in 2017 touring to Moscow, London, Singapore and UK."

  "text" : "Eustachy Trepka (born around 1510, died October 17, 1558) was a Polish Lutheran theologian, pastor, and translator. Trepka's family had its origins near Sieradz and Wielkopolska. According to some sources his family was nicknamed Nękanda with a coat of arms Topór. Eustachy attended the Lubrański Academy in Poznań where he was mostly likely a student of the Lutheran theologian Christoph Hegendorff. He was also probably a tutor to the Górka family, who were his protectors. In the 1540s, together with his sponsor Andrzej Górka, Trepka traveled to Wittemberg and met Martin Luther and his collaborator Philipp Melanchthon. Subsequently, in 1546, he was invited by Duke Albert of Prussia to come to Królewiec (Königsberg, today Kaliningrad), the capital of Duchy of Prussia which at the time was a fief of Kingdom of Poland. There, Trepka was tasked by the Duke with carrying out translations of religious work from Latin into Polish, and he was employed in the print shop of Hans Daubmann. He also published with Daubmann's competitor, Aleksander Augezdecky. Works translated by Trepka include Mleko duchowne dla karmienia i wychowywania chrześcijańskich dziatek, 1556 (\"Spiritual milk for nourishment and upbringing of Christian children\"), by the Spanish theologian Juan de Valdés, and the Large Catechism of Johannes Brenz. Trepka served as the Duke's adviser in regard to Polish affairs and in house translator. His son, Jerzy Trepka, was also employed by the Duke. Eustachy Trepka was an ideological opponent of the Polish Protestant evangelical reformer Jan Łaski and the Congregationists of Greater Poland."

  "text" : "Eduardo Enrique Castro Luque (12 December 1963 – 14 September 2012) was the deputy-elect of Ciudad Obregón, Sonora and a member of the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI). Born and raised in Ciudad Obregón, Castro Luque ran for office in his municipality and was elected as a state legislature for Sonora in the Congress of Mexico on 1 July 2012. Before running for office, he had served as the marketing manager of the Yaquis de Obregón baseball team in his hometown and was working at his privately owned publicity agency. On 14 September 2012, two days before entering office, he was gunned down outside his home by gunmen. He was later pronounced dead at a local hospital. Northern Mexico has been the scene of violent confrontations between Mexico's drug gangs. The recent wave of violence in Ciudad Obregón is attributed to the Sinaloa Cartel and the Beltrán-Leyva Cartel, which fight for the control of retail drug sales and the smuggling routes leading to the United States."

Raised in a contented, happy family, the young Lynch was a member of the Boy Scouts of America, reaching the highest rank of Eagle Scout. However, Lynch took to building fireworks and playing the bongos in a Beat Generation nightclub as acts of rebellion, before discovering that he could translate his childhood fascination with drawing and painting into a career in fine art. Lynch and his close friend Jack Fisk travelled to Austria hoping to study under Oskar Kokoschka, but the artist was not present at the time. Returning the United States, Lynch enrolled in the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts in Philadelphia. Although initially focusing on oil painting and sculpture, Lynch found himself beginning to experiment with short films. After completing several short animated and partly animated works, Lynch was prompted by his mentor Bushnell Keeler to apply for one of four annual grants from the American Film Institute to fund another film project. The resulting film, The Grandmother, paved the way for Lynch's scholarship at the AFI Conservatory; while studying there, Lynch wrote and directed a film which would take several years to gestate—his feature-length début and the beginning of his commercial film career, Eraserhead."

He was a eugenicist and a social Darwinist, holding the hypothesis that as civilization advances, the less intelligent members tend inevitably to numerically outbreed the more intelligent. He was associated with the Population Reference Bureau and with \"Directors of Birthright, Inc.\"  He was once fired from the University of Nevada for circulating among his students a paper about sex and birth control. In his work, he weighed different theoretical approaches to inducing a higher average IQ in the population particularly of the United States and Europe. He was also concerned about population growth in the Oriental and Northern African countries. In addition to points surrounding licensing marriage, he suggested limits to migration from countries that fail to maintain population control measures. He also believed that banning abortion would be harmful to both population numbers and societal problems. Pendell edited a textbook for undergraduates, An Introduction to Sociology, about which a reviewer stated that \"Each chapter is excellent and covers a wealth of material....\""

  "text" : "Edward Mansfield is a justice on the Iowa Supreme Court. Mansfield graduated from Harvard College in 1978 and Yale Law School in 1982. After law school Mansfield clerked for Judge Patrick Higginbotham of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit before entering private practice. In 1997, Mansfield started teaching as an adjunct professor at Drake University and has served as the chairperson of of the board of directors of Goodwill Industries of Central Iowa. Mansfield joined the Iowa Court of Appeals in 2009. Mansfield was one of three justices appointed by Governor Terry Branstad in 2011. In November 2010, Iowa voters had removed all three justices seeking reelection in response to the court unanimously legalizing same-sex marriage in Varnum v. Brien. In 2012, Mansfiled found that it was not gender discrimination when the reason given by a dentist firing an employee was that he was sexually attracted to her, having earlier told her that she was dressed inappropriately “if she saw his pants bulging”. In May 2006, Mansfiled dissented when the Court found that it was unconstitutional to sentence children to life imprisonment without the possibility of parol. In September 2016, Mansfield was named as a possible Supreme Court nominee by Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump."

His primary publications include Global Optimization Using Interval Analysis (1992), A Table of Series and Products (1975), and Topics in Interval Analysis (1969). He also co-authored a number of works with the mathematician William Walster. Hansen completed his undergraduate studies at the University of California, Berkeley, and received his Ph.D. in mathematics from Stanford University in 1960 on Jacobi methods and Block-Jacobi methods for computing matrix eigenvalues (Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society, 1961). He was born in 1927 near Rochester, WA. Hansen's algorithm extended the classical Gauss-Seidel algorithm to interval computations, and has been used to compute uncertainties in delta wing composite structures (Delcroix, Boyer, & Braibant) Hansen's method used interval analysis to solve a supposedly \"insoluble\" global optimization problem. The method was originally described for both the one-dimensional and multi-dimensional cases in the 1980s, and is more fully described in the 1992 Global Optimization Using Interval Analysis and the 2nd edition of the book written with William Walster in 2003, and was translated into Russian in 2012. Dr. Hansen taught at Stanford University, The University of California at Berkeley, San Jose State College, Oxford University, and Washington State University; and he worked at Lockheed in Palo Alto, California."

  "text" : "Edmund \"Eddie\" Buczynski (January 28, 1947 – March 16, 1989) was a prominent American Wiccan and archaeologist who founded two separate traditions of Wicca: Welsh Traditionalist Witchcraft and The Minoan Brotherhood. Born to a working-class family in New York City, Buczynski initially planned to become a Roman Catholic priest, before abandoning this idea and embracing his homosexuality by moving to Greenwich Village and associating with the city's gay scene. Befriending the Wiccan Leo Martello, he was introduced to Herman Slater, with whom he began a relationship. Together they opened an occult supply store, The Warlock Shop. Initially initiated into the New Haven coven of Gwen Thompson, a part of the New England Covens of Traditionalist Witches (NECTW), he rose to the position of acting high priest before leaving to found his own tradition, Welsh Traditional Witchcraft, in 1972. Although the tradition proved a success and soon spread, Buczynski himself moved on to Gardnerian Wicca, which he was initiated into in 1973. In 1974 he was ordained into the Church of the Eternal Source, a Kemetic Pagan group, but moved on again in 1977, when he founded the Minoan Brotherhood as a Wiccan tradition for gay and bisexual men. Turning to academia, from 1980 to 1985 he studied for a bachelor's degree in Classical archaeology at Hunter College, which he followed up with a master's degree in the subject at Bryn Mawr College from 1985 to 1988. Buczynski was diagnosed with HIV/AIDS in 1988, and died from a related Toxoplasma gondii infection the following year, converting to Roman Catholicism briefly beforehand. In 2012, the practicing Pagan Michael G. Lloyd published a biography of Buczynski entitled Bull of Heaven."

  "text" : "Edward Upcott (born 29 December 1991) is a five times British acrobatic gymnast champion who was world men's pairs champion in partnership with Doug Fordyce, winning the gold medal in July 2010 in Poland. Before his partnership with Fordyce, Upcott was in partnership with Mark Fyson, who retired in 2009 after the pair had won the bronze medal in the 2008 world championships in Glasgow. With his new partner Adam McAssey, Upcott was awarded the silver medal in the 2012 Acrobatic Gymnastics World Championships. Upcott came to UK national public attention with his membership of the gymnastic group Spelbound, who rose to fame in 2010, winning the fourth series of Britain's Got Talent. Part of their performance was a spectacular throw of Upcott over the heads of the judges, catching him in the main performance area. The prize was £100,000 and the opportunity to appear at the 2010 Royal Variety Performance. With Spelbound, Upcott holds the world record for 'Highest throw and catch of a person', where he was the person thrown and caught. The successful record attempt was televised on the UK children's TV show Blue Peter. Upcott left Spelbound in 2012 to pursue other avenues. While still a member, he was cast as a stunt double for Asa Butterfield in Hugo. He works with Doug Fordyce as Brothers of Eden. His stated ambition is to be part of Cirque du Soleil."

  "text" : "Eggerik Beninga (1490–1562), also known as Eggeric(k) Benninga or Benynga, was an East Frisian chronicler and steward of the Leerort Fortress. From 1540 to 1556 he was also counselor to Anna of Oldenburg. He wrote an account of the history of the Frisians until the year 1562 A.D. Beninga was born in Grimersum, now a part of Krummhörn municipality, Germany. He was the son of Garrelt Beninga, chieftain and bailiff at Wirdum, Jennelt and Grimersum, and of Essa Houwerda of Up- and Wolthusen, daughter of Snelger Houwerda from Termunten. His father's family was an established family of East Frisian chieftains and Eggerik himself came to serve at the court of Edzard I, Count of East Frisia at a young age. As a chronicler he wrote the Volledige Chronyk van Oostfrieslant in Dutch or Cronica der Fresen in Low German language [Complete Chronicle of East Frisia and Chronicle of the Frisians, respectively]. The account does not only deal with events concerning East Frisia but also lists the history of all neighbouring peoples. His sources remain unknown, which is why the authenticity of his work has been questioned. Many events described by Benninga are however known from secondary historians of the time. His history of East Frisia was edited by Eilhardus Folkardus Harkenroth (1670–1732). Another edition by Anthonius Matthaeus was printed in Leiden in 1706 based on a different manuscript. Eggerik Beninga died in Grimersum in 1562."

Nicholas, a De La Salle Christian Brother, was 27 when he left Sri Lanka for Pakistan, to teach mathematics and science at La Salle High School Multan. He taught here until 1968. His most prominent student was Yousuf Raza Gillani who become prime minister of Pakistan in March 2008. As a De La Salle Brother, he considers his mission in life is to educate the poor in the slums and rural outbacks. When St. Vincent’s school, in Mian Channu on the Multan-Lahore road, wanted a principal in 1968, Nicholas volunteered for the job. Mian Channu was a Christian village of about 600 families and the school was built for their children. Nicholas also considered former President Zia ul-Haq to be a close friend. He also attended Fordham University in New York City, where he earned a master’s degree in counseling. In 1979, he left Pakistan to return to Sri Lanka. The President of Pakistan conferred the civil award of Tamgha-e-Imtiaz (Medal of Pakistan) on Bro. Emmanuel in recognition of his outstanding and meritorious services for the education sector in Pakistan. He received the award at the High Commission of Pakistan, Colombo, on 23 March 2012. Back in Sri Lanka, he is working to improve the quality of life in a shantytown on the outskirts of Colombo, particularly to reduce maternal and infant deaths. The De La Salle Brothers care for 450 children from ages 3 to 5 in preschool programs, 135 young women in training for jobs like sewing and catering, and 175 young men learning trades like agriculture and auto mechanics. Raising funds to carry out these programs is not easy. They get little financial help from the government, but people in business and international foundations do support . He needs $8,000 each month to continue his work."

  "text" : "Erin DiMeglio (born October 22, 1994) is a former high school football and basketball player, who currently attends the University of Central Florida. In 2012, Erin graduated from South Plantation High School, in Plantation, Florida. As a senior at her high school, Erin became the first female quarterback in Florida high school football history, as she was the third-string quarterback for the South Plantation High School football team during the 2012 season. On September 21, 2012, DiMeglio notched the first completed pass of her career, on her second attempt in the game. However, the play accounted for a loss of yardage, with the AP citing a 5-yard loss on the down and the South Florida Sun-Sentinel stating that it accounted for a 2-yard setback. South Plantation won the game against Piper High School 41-12. On October 11, 2012, DiMeglio was crowned homecoming queen. In 2013, she received a $20,000 scholarship from Foot Locker's Scholar Athlete Program and DoSomething.org. Her father Tom, taught her to throw a football as a child, and in the fourth grade, she joined a flag football league where all the players but four were boys. When she was in high school, DiMeglio became quarterback of the girls' flag football team, before joining the boys' football team. Her family and friends are always supporting her sports by going to games and volunteering at the concession stand. Both parents, Kathleen and Tom rarely miss a sporting event. In fall 2013, Erin transferred to the University of Central Florida, to be with her older sister, Amy. As a sophomore during the 2013-2014 academic year, Erin wanted to redshirt in football and walk on to the women's basketball team during the 2014 season, but did not make the team."

Apparently, the marriage was against her father-in-law's wishes. Some sources say that she lived in Thurles Castle from this marriage until her death (1608–1673), except for a short period (1658–60) during the rule of Cromwell — she was a Catholic Royalist. It is not clear, however, that she could have returned to Thurles Castle because Lewis writes that \"this castle, during the parliamentary war, was garrisoned for the King, but was afterwards taken by the parliamentarian forces, by whom it was demolished\". On the other hand, Lady Thurles may have returned to a newer building on or close to the site of the castle which may also have been called Thurles Castle; Grose, writing in 1791, and Armitage, writing in 1912, seem to imply that a building called Thurles Castle still existed in their times. She and Lord Thurles had three sons and four daughters before he drowned on 15 December 1619, when the ship carrying him to England was wrecked off the Skerries near Anglesey. This was shortly after the start of his father's long imprisonment in the Fleet Prison in London and Thomas had been on his way to answer charges of treason for having garrisoned Kilkenny. After his death, Lady Thurles married again, about 1620. With her second husband, Captain George Mathew of Radyr and Llandaff in Glamorganshire, Wales, she had two more sons and one more daughter. Her second husband died in 1636 at Tenby in Wales. She lived a further 37 years, dying in Thurles in May 1673. She was buried beside what is now the Protestant church of St. Mary's in Thurles. An oil portrait of Lady Thurles is held by Tipperary County Library in Thurles."

  "text" : "Ernst Lohse (14 February 1944 – 23 October 1994) was a Danish architect and designer known for his colourful post-modernistic style as well as stylised country and cityscapes of quintessential Danish motifs. Together with architect Bente Schaltz (a.k.a. Bente Lohse) he ran the design studio The Green Studio from 1973 till 1990 (Grønne Studie Aps). He is especially known for his architectural fantasies – in watercolour – of post-modernistic buildings, often based on mythology. He was also commissioned for architectural design work e.g. poster for Kodak or the yearly poster for DSB – the National Danish Railways. In 1985 he designed a temporary city gate to Copenhagen, which stood at the beginning of the famous pedestrianised shopping street Strøget on the main Copenhagen Town Hall square. In 1987 he designed a 26 meters long 3D frieze for the central Palace Square for the town of Randers, Denmark (the frieze was restored and rehung in 2013). He also designed posters, postcards, furniture, textiles, jewellery, interior design and theatre scenography (Maria Stuart). From 1989 until 1992 he designed and built the History Centre Dybbøl together with architect Michael E. Freddie (b. 1946), which was opened by Queen Margrethe II of Denmark 18 April 1992. His work was commissioned and exhibited in numerous modern art museums, including the Centre Georges Pompidou, Paris, in 1984 and commissioned work for Homo Decorans at the Louisiana Museum of Modern Art, Denmark 1985. Lohse published numerous articles on the topic of architecture (see Publications section below) and with author Mette Winge co-authored the book Hvor smiler fager, a literary guide to Denmark, 1994."

  "text" : "Eduard Friedrich Weber (6 March 1806, Wittenberg – 18 May 1871)  was a German anatomist and physiologist. He was a younger brother to physiologist Ernst Heinrich Weber (1795-1878) and physicist Wilhelm Eduard Weber (1804-1891). He studied medicine at the University of Halle, receiving his doctorate in 1829. From 1836 he served as prosector in the anatomical institute at the University of Leipzig, where in 1838 he became privat-docent with a thesis involving physiological studies on the \"galvano-magnetic phenomena\" in humans. From 1847 to 1871 he was an associate professor at Leipzig. He assisted his older brother, Ernst, with experimentation involving the inhibitory power of the vagus nerve."

Boddington exhibited at the Royal Academy (11 works), the British Institution (25 works), and Suffolk Street (45 works). He painted mainly views on the Thames River that are illuminated either by sunset or moonlight. Most of his river scenes are painted in very dark greens and browns, and many resemble some of the earlier works of his father. He died sometime after 1905, possibly in Australia where his sons Percy Reginald Boddington (1866-1936) and Henry Frederick Boddington (1870-1940) had emigrated. Examples of his work hang in the Glasgow Museum, Rotherham Museum, Reading Town Hall and the Ealing Central Library."

After duties as a pharmacy apprentice in Goslar, he studied medicine at the University of Göttingen. While a student, he engaged in frequent botanical excursions throughout northern Germany. In 1817 he finished his studies at Göttingen, and later came under the influence of Danish botanist Jens Wilken Hornemann (1770–1841). From 1821 to 1823 he conducted botanical investigations in Lauenburg and the \"Elbe Duchies\", later taking scientific excursions to Zealand, Funen, Jutland and islands off both coasts of the Schleswig-Holstein mainland. From 1826 to 1873 he was a professor of botany at the University of Kiel, as well as director of its botanical garden. He was an instructor to Ferdinand von Mueller (1825–1896), who would later be known for his botanical work in Australia. The plant genus Noltea from the family Rhamnaceae is named in his honor, as is Zostera noltei, a species of seagrass (named by Jens Wilken Hornemann, 1832)."

  "text" : "Elizabeth Brown (6 August 1830 – 5 March 1899)was a British astronomer who specialized in solar observation, especially sunspots and solar eclipses. She was also instrumental in founding the British Astronomical Association. Elizabeth was born in Cirencester, Gloucestershire. Her father, Thomas Brown, introduced her to the telescope, and she began observing sunspots. When her father died at age 91, she was released of domestic and filial duties and began to travel the world to record her observations. She published two books anonymously on her travels. She joined the Liverpool Astronomical Society following the death of her father in 1883. At this time the society operated as an association of amateur astronomers across Britain, rather than as a merely local organisation. Brown travelled a 140-mile round journey from her home near Cirencester to Liverpool to attend its meetings. She soon afterwards became the director of its Solar Section. Brown had a central role in organising in 1890 the formation of the British Astronomical Association to coordinate the work of amateur astronomers. She became the Director of the new Association's Solar Section, a post which she held until her death in 1899. She also contributed to the activities of other observing sections, including the lunar, variable star and coloured star sections. The British Astronomical Association accepted women as members from its start, unlike the Royal Astronomical Society. Brown was one of three women proposed for fellowship of the Royal Astronomical Society in 1892, but all three controversially failed to attract sufficient votes to be elected (the other two were Alice Everett and Annie Russell; similarly, the nomination of Isis Pogson had been rejected in 1886; and the first female fellows were elected in 1915). Elizabeth Brown travelled widely to seek for solar eclipses, an adventure she describes in her work In Pursuit of a Shadow (1887). The title of the book reveals the influence of the earlier Quaker meteorologist Luke Howard who famously used the phrase to describe his work on clouds. A second set of memoirs, Caught in the Tropics, appeared in 1890. Her work on the daily recording sunspots, including meticulous drawings, earned her a distinguished reputation among the astronomers of her day."

  "text" : "Enoch Winkler (January 2, 1852 – November 1, 1928) was a farmer, merchant and political figure in Manitoba. He represented Rosenfeldt from 1888 to 1899 in the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba as a Liberal. He was born in Waterloo County, Ontario, the son of David J. Winkler and the brother of Valentine Winkler. Winkler came west in 1874, working as a translator for a group of German-speaking Mennonites emigrating to Manitoba. In 1875, he moved to Emerson, where he set up a lumber business. He later settled in Gretna. In 1878, he married Helen Stewart. Winkler was reeve for the Rural Municipality of Rhineland and served as mayor of Gretna from 1898 to 1899 and in 1901. He was defeated when he ran for reelection to the Manitoba assembly in 1899. Winkler moved to California around 1908 but returned to Winnipeg a year and a half later. He died at home in Winnipeg at the age of 76. Winkler's former home in Gretna has been designated as a Municipal Heritage Site by the province of Manitoba."

Volodarsky's willingness to deviate from official Soviet propaganda accounts of war, such as those of World War II, led to censorship from Soviet authorities. For example, Trial of the Road, which was filmed in 1971 was not released until 1986 during Perestroika. Likewise, Soviet film censors refused to release My Friend Ivan Lapshin until several years after it was finished in the early 1980s. Volodarsky was born in Kharkiv, Ukraine, U.S.S.R., in 1941. He died in Russia on October 8, 2012, at the age of 71 and was survived by his wife, Farida A. Volodarskaya."

He was born at Irthington, near Carlisle and studied at the University of Edinburgh, gaining his MD in 1827. He moved to Lancaster in 1832, and in 1840 became Visiting Physician at the Lancaster County Lunatic Asylum. In 1864 James Brunton offered £2,000 towards a new asylum for \"idiots and imbeciles\" and asked De Vitre's assistance. De Vitre was the Chairman of the Committee for the new asylum, and oversaw its establishment. The foundation stone was laid in 1868 and it received its first patients on 14 December 1870. De Vitre died at Elms, Bare, Lancaster, on 4 October 1878. In September 2012 a community resource centre for the Lancashire Care NHS Trust, in Ashton Road near the former Royal Albert Hospital, was named DeVitre House in his honour, after a competition in which local residents were asked to choose its name. The hospital itself closed in 1996 and the buildings now house an Islamic educational establishment for girls, Jamea Al Kauthar Islamic College."

At first studying with his father, the painter Jacques Alfred van Muyden (1818–1898), Evert later lived and studied in Geneva at the Beaux-Arts, under Carl Steffeck in Berlin and under Jean-Léon Gérôme at the Paris Beaux-Arts. He worked in Rome between 1879 and 1884, concentrating on landscapes, and showing the clear influence of Corot. After 1885, he worked in Paris painting animals in the style of Antoine-Louis Barye. He virtually lived at the Museum National d'Histoire Naturelle in Paris and the Zoologischer Garten in Basle, creating hundreds of drawings and engravings of plants and animals. He was sought after as an illustrator of books, providing images for Champfleury's Contes choisis (Paris, 1899) and Emil Frey's Die Kriegstaten der Schweizer (Neuchatel, 1905). His engravings and book illustrations remained popular, overshadowing his occasional portraits and sculptures."

  "text" : "Elisabeth Tova Bailey is the author of The Sound of a Wild Snail Eating (2010, Algonquin Books, ISBN 978-1565126060) which won the 2010 John Burroughs Medal, the Natural History Literature category of the 2010 National Outdoor Book Award (joint award), and the non-fiction category of the 2012 William Saroyan International Prize for Writing. In the book she describes her observations of an individual land snail in the species Neohelix albolabris which lived in a terrarium next to her while she was confined to bed through illness. In her essay A Green World Deep in Winter: The Bedside Terrarium, published in the Yale Journal for Humanities in Medicine, Bailey describes how Nathaniel Bagshaw Ward, inventor of the Wardian case, had published during the mid 19th century a report on the \"Use of Closed Cases in Illness\", explaining the benefit of a terrarium to bed-ridden patients in order to \"beguile many a weary hour\"."

He hails from Bergen, and after studies in economics, law and public administration at the University of Bergen he graduated with the cand. polit. degree. After some years as a Norad official in Namibia and civil servant in Tromsø he was hired as a financial consultant in Kristiansand municipality in 1982. In 1990 he advanced to chief administrative officer, a position he held until 2002. In 2000, Kristiansand municipality sold stocks in the power company Agder Energi, and NOK 1.7 billion of the sales fee were funneled to a new cultural foundation, Cultiva. As chief administrative officer Valvik was one of the architects behind the foundation, together with prominent local politicians such as Bjarne Ugland and Tore Austad. In 2002, Valvik applied for the job as managing director of Cultiva, and was hired after edging out 54 other applicants. In early February 2004, Valvik was selected as chairman of the Southern Norway Regional Health Authority. An entirely new board was composed, after the Minister of Health Dagfinn Høybråten relieved the old board of their positions. The board had split over the proposed removal of chief executive Steinar Stokke. With the new board in place, Stokke resigned after less than two weeks. Valvik remained chairman until 2006, when a new policy was decided to select active politicians as board members to a larger degree. In 2009, Valvik became deputy board member of Tromsø municipality's cultural foundation Intro. In 2011 he applied for the position as County Governor of Sogn og Fjordane, but was not appointed."

He worked for the Works Progress Administration (WPA) Collection of the Illinois State Museum, and was employed by the Denver Times and The Chicago Tribune as an editorial illustrator. Ellsworth Young studied at The Art Institute of Chicago with Oliver Dennett Grover and John Vanderpoel. Young, an Illinois artist, was a member of the Chicago Painters and Sculptors and the Oak Park River Forest Art League. He painted several posters for the war effort of World War I, his best-known probably being \"Remember Belgium\". The Allied Nations made use of images of supposed German atrocities to bolster their propaganda machine. In 2010 Western Illinois University began looking at stored works of art to refurbish, and discovered a rolled-up painting which held “tremendous historical significance.” It was a painting by Young of a river landscape in autumn, and had been commissioned in 1934 to hang in Monroe Hall (later known as Grote Hall) and remaining there for some 60 years until the Hall was demolished in 1991. The painting was sent to the Chicago Conservation Center to be restored."

  "text" : "Sir Eusebius Buswell, 1st Baronet (1681–1730?), was a baronet in the Baronetage of Great Britain. He was born at Tickencote, Rutland, in 1681. He matriculated at Pembroke College, Oxford, on 20 May 1698 aged 17. He was the eldest son of Eusebius Buswell, formerly Pelsant, of Lyddington, Rutland, by Frances Wingfield, daughter of Sir Richard Wingfield of Tickencote. Eusebius Buswell, Senior, was the son of Sir Eusebius Pelsant of Cadeby, Leicestershire, by his second wife Anne, the sister of Sir George Buswell, Baronet. Sir George died without issue on 10 March 1667, when Eusebius Buswell, Senior, was about 11 years old and presumably still called Pelsant. By 1706, he had adopted the surname of his maternal uncle, Buswell. Eusebius Buswell, Junior, was created a baronet on 5 March 1714, and was the last baronet created during the reign of Anne, Queen of Great Britain. He married firstly, Hester Skrymshire, second daughter and co-heir of Sir Charles Skrymshire of Norbury, Staffordshire, by his first wife Hester Taylor, daughter and heiress of George Taylor of Darwent Hall, Derbyshire. She died without issue on 7 April 1706, and was buried at All Saints' Church, Clipston, Northamptonshire. He married secondly Honora Sneyd (baptised 23 May 1694), daughter of Ralph Sneyd, of Keel Hall, Staffordshire. They had an only daughter, Frances, who married Christopher Horton of Catton, Derbyshire. On his death in or about 1730, the baronetcy became extinct. His estate was heavily in debt, and a private bill \"for vesting certain Lands and Estates, in the Counties of Stafford, Leicester, Rutland, and Northampton, late the Estates of Sir Eusebius Buswell Baronet, deceased, in Trustees, to be sold, for the Payment of his Debts\" was passed by the Parliament of Great Britain in June 1732 to enable payment. There is a memorial tablet in All Saints' Church, Clipston, that reads \"Eusebius Buswell died 1730\"."

  "text" : "Edward Williams (c.1755-1797?) was an engraver who lived in London in the late 1700s, and engraved several prints after Thomas Rowlandson and William Ward. Although a competent engraver, he is remembered primarily for being the father of Edward Williams the Victorian landscape painter. Williams is said to have been born about 1755, though this is not certain, and he is said to have known the celebrated painter and engraver William Hogarth (1697-1764), which would make Williams about 9 years old when Hogarth died. As 9 is the age during the Georgian era when many apprenticeships began, this means that Williams may have briefly studied under Hogarth. He eventually became an engraver as well and some of his work was subsequently published by the master of mezzotint engraving John Raphael Smith. Williams became friends with the brothers William Ward and James Ward, both engravers who had apprenticed under Smith, and he had at least two children born out of wedlock with their 18-year-old sister Mary Ward (1764-1832), before finally marrying her in 1788, some six years after the fact. This marriage made Williams a brother-in-law as well to the animal painter George Morland, and Morland's biographer John Hassell (1806) tells us that Williams and Morland were in fact drinking companions. Another member of this notorious group was the caricaturist Thomas Rowlandson, who like Morland is remembered as much for his exploits at the taverns as for his art. Williams produced several engravings of Rowlandson's caricatures, most notably A College Scene, and another titled Polygamy, a copy of which is in the Royal Collection. He also engraved an illustration by Henry Wigstead titled The Country Vicar's Fireside, and another by John Hamilton Mortimer titled The Coke and Perkin, the latter in a set of prints of Chaucer's Canterbury Tales in the British Museum. These were all published from 1785 to 1787, some by John Raphael Smith and others by Thomas Prattent. Mary Ward within a few years left Edward Williams for another man, leaving behind their son, who was named after his father the engraver. The younger Edward Williams went on to become a very successful landscape artist, following in the tradition of his artist uncle James Ward, but he is best known for raising six sons, all successful landscape painters in their own right, who are collectively known as the Williams family of painters. Edward Williams the engraver probably died in 1797 or before, as Henry Robert Morland, the father of George Morland, died that same year, and he is said before his death to have asked Mary Ward's brother James as to the circumstances of Edward Williams' demise."

  "text" : "Edwin Hugh Shellard (usually known as E. H. Shellard) was an English architect who practised in Manchester, being active between 1844 and 1864. Most of his works are located in Northwest England, in what is now Greater Manchester, Lancashire, Cheshire, and Derbyshire. He was mainly an ecclesiastical architect, and gained contracts to design at least 13 churches for the Church Building Commission, these churches being known as Commissioners' churches. Most of his designs were in Gothic Revival style, usually Early English or Decorated, but he also experimented in the Perpendicular style. He employed the Romanesque Revival style in his additions to St Mary's Church, Preston. The National Heritage List for England shows that at least 23 of his new churches are designated as listed buildings, four of them at Grade II*. The authors of the Buildings of England series consider that his finest work is St John's Minster in Preston, Lancashire. Shellard died 1 February 1885, aged 69."

Hoffman (born May 7, 1839 in Orwigsburg, Pennsylvania, USA; died 1929 in Chicago, Illinois) was a Presbyterian minister, composer of over 2,000 hymns and editor of over 50 song books. The son of an Evangelical minister, Hoffman grew up singing sacred hymns both in church and in the home with his parents. After completing high school, Hoffman furthered his education at Union Seminary in New Berlin, Pennsylvania, and was subsequently ordained as a Presbyterian minister in 1868. Following his seminary education, Hoffman began work with the publishing branch of the Evangelical Association in Cleveland, Ohio. After serving in this position for 11 years, Hoffman held several pastoral positions in the midwest. He pastored churches in both Cleveland and Grafton, Ohio, in the 1880s; moved to Benton Harbor, Michigan and the First Presbyterian Church in the mid-1890s; and finished his ministry in Cabery, Illinois from 1911-22. Hoffman died in 1929 in Chicago, Illinois, and is buried there in Oak Woods Cemetery. During the course of his life, Hoffman composed over 2,000 hymns, and edited over 50 song books, including: The Evergreen, 1873; Spiritual Songs for Gospel Meetings and the Sunday School, 1878; Temperance Jewels (Boston, Massachusetts: Oliver Ditson & Company, 1879); Bells of Victory (Boston, Massachusetts: Oliver Ditson & Company, 1888); Pentecostal Hymns No. 1 (Chicago, Illinois: Hope Publishing Company, 1894); Favorite Gospel Songs: A Tune Book (Jersey City, New Jersey: J.
