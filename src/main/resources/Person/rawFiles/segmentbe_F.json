Her mother was Mary Brown Small, a descendant of the Smalls of Dirnanean. Flora's younger sister was Scottish painter Mary Cameron. Flora firstly married Robert Blair, a minister, on 29 October 1889. In 1911, after the death of her first husband, Flora married Edinburgh policeman, George Macaulay. After his retirement, the couple moved to Oban, where under the name Flora Macauley, she became editor of the Cameron family owned The Oban Times newspaper. Flora and her husband lived on the second floor of the Oban Times building, allowing Flora to be involved in every aspect of the paper's production. Her editorial style was very pro-Gaelic, including supporting Highland bagpipers and the ancient Scottish sport of shinty. In 1947 Flora established the Macaulay Cup for shinty. Flora remained involved with the management of the newspaper until her death at age 99. Her nephew, Alan Cameron, eventually succeeded her as editor."

  "text" : "Sir Frederick Mander  FEIS (12 July 1883 – 27 February 1964), was a headmaster and trade unionist and the General Secretary of the National Union of Teachers (NUT) from 1931 to 1947. Mander was born in Luton in Bedfordshire, the son of Arthur Mander, an iron plate worker, and his wife, Carrie Ellingham. At birth he was registered as Fred, and this name appeared on his marriage certificate in 1911, but in later years he was known as Frederick. Mander was educated at the Luton Higher Grade School before training to become a teacher at Westminster Training College. He obtained an external BSc degree from the University of London. He was already a schoolmaster when he married Hilda Irene Sargent (1883/4-1965) on 2 September 1911. Mander was the headmaster of a school in Luton from 1915 to 1931. He joined the National Union of Teachers (NUT) and was elected to its Executive Committee in 1922. In 1923 he was involved in the Lowestoft Strike, when at least 167 teachers struck for eleven months in protest at the Local Education Authority's decision to reduce teachers' salaries by 10 per cent. The actions of the LEA were widely condemned after the NUT were able to prove that the non-union ‘blackleg’ teachers employed by the LEA were inadequate. Following the strikers' action, in 1926 the Board of Education ruled that teachers' salaries should be agreed at a national level by the Burnham Committee. Mander became Vice-President of the NUT in 1926 and President in 1927. He resigned as headmaster of his Luton school to become the NUT's General Secretary, a position he held from 1931 to 1947, when he retired. In 1931 Mander opposed government demands that teachers' pay should be reduced by up to 30 per cent because of the economic crisis at that time. The reduction was eventually limited to 10 per cent. He was knighted in 1938. He was the Vice President of the National Foundation for Educational Research from 1948 until his death in 1964. The Mander College of Further Education in Bedford College was built in 1959 and was named after him. Mander was Chairman of Bedfordshire County Council between 1952 and 1962, and was a member of the Executive of the Association of Education Committees. He was the President of the Bedfordshire Natural History Society. Sir Frederick Mander died at the Luton and Dunstable Hospital in 1964 aged 80. He was survived by his wife and two sons and a daughter."

  "text" : "Francisco Fajardo (Isla Margarita, c. 1524 - Cumaná, 1564) was a Spanish conquistador active in Venezuela. He was an example of a mestizo (mixed race) conquistador. Fajardo was the son of a Spanish lieutenant of the same name and an indigenous Indian woman, Isabel of the Guaiquerí. In 1555 to 1557 he made several expeditions from Margarita to conquer the Caracas tribe around the valleys of present-day Caracas, even before the city was formally founded by conqueror Diego de Losada. As a mestizo (person of mixed race) he was able to blend in with the indigenous tribes of the coast physically and culturally. After murdering a local cacique he had to flee back to Margarita in 1558. He returned to the mainland in 1560, becoming lieutenant-general of Valencia, Venezuela, before going back to Margarita to defend it against Lope de Aguirre. On a new expedition to the mainland he discovered a gold mine in the territory of the Teques, in the Caracas region near present-day Los Teques. Early attempts at settlement had to be abandoned in 1562 when an uprising led by Guaicaipuro forced Fajardo to retreat again to Margarita, an expedition by Luis de Narváez to reinforce Fajardo having been destroyed. After setting out on a new expedition from Margarita in 1564, he was arrested and executed in Cumaná by Alonso Cobos after a sham trial. Cobos was arrested in Cumana by outraged residents of Margarita, and after a trial in Margarita was executed for the murder of Fajardo. The major highway of Caracas, the Francisco Fajardo Highway, is named after him."

Magadlela was relatively self-taught but he spent many hours with fellow artists exchanging ideas and techniques. Magadlela worked closely with artists such as Ezrom Legae, Solly Maphiri, Winston Saoli, Percy Sedumedi, Pietro Cuzzolini and Harold Jeppe who became his mentor, introducing him to art circles in Johannesburg. His most renowned work was entitled “Birth of The Second Creation” a series of drafted, mystical landscapes showing an African man and woman in flowing drapery and overwhelming clouds. Later Magadlela would do bolder landscapes with similar characters using more colour and poetry.His first exhibition first solo exhibition was at the Goodman Gallery then owned by Linda Givon in 1978.

  "text" : "Benny Fine (born March 19, 1981) and Rafi Fine (born June 9, 1983), known together as the Fine Brothers, are online producers, writers, and directors, who are best known for their React video series, their several timed-spoiler series, narrative web series, as well as creating a \"transmedia\" sitcom on YouTube, MyMusic. The Fine Brothers have been creating content online since 2004. They are behind their company, Fine Brothers Entertainment, a full service production company of digital series, television shows, and feature films. The Fine Brothers channel has over 3 billion views and has peaked at over 14 million subscribers. However, due to a controversy over an attempt to license and trademark the term \"React\", as well as the names of their series, the Fine Brothers' channels lost hundreds of thousands of subscribers in early 2016. By May 2016, however, the Fine Brothers' channel regained their former subscriber numbers."

  "text" : "Francesco Migliori, also known as Francesco Megliori (c. 1684 -1734) was an Italian painter of the Baroque period, active mainly in his native Republic of Venice. His training is not known, though an adherence to the style of the tenebrosi suggests the school of Antonio Molinari. Migliori first appears in the records of the painter's guild starting in 1711. His name appears in 1722 as the author of a series of paintings in the inventory for the gallery of Frederick Augustus I, Elector of Saxony. A first group of paintings depicts mostly biblical subjects: Cain and Abel, the Sacrifice of Isaac, a Joseph interprets the dreams, a Lot and his daughters, and Cimon and Pero (destroyed, but of which we have reproductions). The influence of Bencovich and Piazetta is evident. Later, he sent two mythological scenes with Bacchus and Ariadne and the Rape of Europa (still in Gemäldegalerie of Dresden. Also from this decade appear to be two altarpieces, depicting the Adoration of the Magi and the Transit of St Joseph, which once had been attributed to Gaspare Diziani. By 1718 he completed the altarpiece of the Assumption for the altar of the Blessed Assumption School in San Stae. About this time, he likely completed the altarpiece of the Crucifixion with Saints Lawrence, Lucia, and Rocco for the parish church of San Martino a Sambughè, in Treviso. In 1727-28 he completed the painted decoration of the organ doors of San Moise with a St Cecilia and an Adoration of the Golden Calf. Another artist active in the decoration of the choir was Francesco Pittoni (the uncle of Giambattista). He also completed an altarpiece of St Anthony resuscitates Father Martino for a chapel at the right in the church. He painted a small canvas depicting Christ and the Samaritan and a Christ and Mary Magdalene now at Rovigo. By 1728, he began to perform extensive works in the decoration of San Marcuola. Beginning in April 1728, he is documented to have painted a series of canvases about the titular saints of Ermagora and Fortunato for the church of San Marcuola, recently renovated by Giorgio Massari. By 1729-1731, he competed paintings for the sacristy of this church, depicting Fortunato attends Ermagora's martyrdom and the Baptism conferred by Ermagora to the martyred Saints Euphemia, Dorotea,Tecla, and Erasma, plus a ceiling canvas depicting the Glory of Saints Ermagora and Fortunato (1735). He also painted a second subject for presbytery with the Fall of Manna, (August, 1735). He likely painted a Virgin of Sorrows and St. Francis of Paola now on the sides of the pulpit. He apparently painted the main altarpiece of the Assumption but that appears now replaced by a copy. He may have played a role in a cycle of the Passion of Christ for the adjacent oratory, but the one remaining painting is attributed to Nicolò Bambini."

  "text" : "Fareeda \"Kokikhel\" Afridi was a Pashtun feminist, a women's rights activist in Pakistan. In July 2012, at the age of 25, she was shot dead on her way to work. Afridi was born and raised in the Khyber tribal area, part of the Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA), an impoverished semi-autonomous region in Pakistan's northwest, bordering Afghanistan. She graduated from university with a master's degree in gender studies. While still in school, with her sister Noor Zia Afridi, she founded the Society for Appraisal and Women Empowerment in Rural Areas (SAWERA), a women-run NGO promoting women's empowerment in FATA. Afridi was critical of the Pakistani government, the Taliban, and the patriarchal nature of Pakistani society. In June 2012, she told journalists she was being threatened. Her friends and colleagues suspected the threats originated with FATA Taliban militants. On 5 July 2012, as Afridi left her home in the Khyber tribal area to go to work in Hayatabad a suburb of Peshawar, she was shot once in the head and twice in the neck by two motorcyclists, who afterwards escaped. She died in hospital. Condemning the murder at a protest camp organized by the Aurat Foundation along with Peshawar Press Club and Pakistan Federal Union of Journalists, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa's Information Minister Mian Iftikhar Hussain stated:Imposing death decrees on individuals such as Farida has resulted in a negative portrayal of our country as well as Islam itself. She was the second female in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa to be targeted by Taliban extremists."

  "text" : "Frutolf of Michelsberg (died 17 January 1103) was a monk in Michelsberg Abbey in Bamberg, Germany, of which he became prior. He was probably a native of Bavaria. Frutolf was possibly a teacher of the quadrivium in the monastery, but principally a librarian and manuscript copyist. In this capacity he was responsible for a substantial increase in the stock of the Michelsberg library. Some of the manuscripts he copied are still extant. He was also an author, writing in Latin. His \"Chronicle of the World\" (Chronica) is among the most complete and best-organised of the early Middle Ages. It extends from the creation to 1099 and after Frutolf's death was edited and extended by Ekkehard von Aura. It is also fairly certain that a \"Breviary of Music\" (Breviarium de musica) is by him. On the other hand, it is doubtful if he wrote either the \"Book of Divine Offices\" (Liber de divinis officiis) or the set of instructions to a board game with counters which are sometimes attributed to him. He developed a critical view of history and awareness of anachronism, among other things pointing out that \"some songs as 'vulgar fables' made Theoderic the Great, Attila and Ermanaric into contemporaries, when any reader of Jordanes knew that this was not the case\".."

The Ramillete manual para los indios sobre la doctrina cristiana is a copy of an original manuscript written by Maldonado, containing important information about the customs of the Quiché peoples at the time of the Spanish invasion. In 1616, Maldonado dedicated his Cakchiquel Explicado Fidei to Varea and also authored Santoral in 1622."

  "text" : "Francine Niyonsaba (born May 5, 1993) is a Burundian runner who specializes in the 800 metres. She is a 2016 silver medalist in the 800 metres. Her silver medal was the first Olympic medal for Burundi since 1996. Niyonsaba finished second in 800 meters 7 race series of 2016 Diamond League. She improved her personal best to 1:56.24 at 2016 Herculis meet. She is the National record holder in the event, improving her own record to 1:58.67 on August 9, 2012 in the semi-final round of the Women's 800m event at the 2012 Summer Olympics. It was a 0.01 seconds improvement on her previous record. Two days later she finished seventh (subsequently upgraded to sixth as a result of Elena Arzhakova's disqualification) in the 2012 Olympic final. Less than a month later she took the record down yet again to 1:56.59. She had a quick rise to prominence in 2012 while still a teenager. The first time she set the record was in late June 2012 while narrowly winning the 2012 African Championships in Athletics in 1:59.11 in what was only her third competitive race. At that, she improved upon her own previous national record of 2:02.13, set in the qualifying round. In the opening round race, the inexperienced runner had opened up a 30 metres lead on the pack. Three weeks later on July 20, 2012, she improved the record again to 1:58.68 while finishing second at the 2012 Diamond League meeting at Herculis."

  "text" : "Felicity Jones (her pen name, born July 20, 1988 in Newton, New Jersey) is an American naturist blogging under an alias for the Young Naturists and Nudists America. She is widely known for her movement towards nudism and feminism. Jones is a feminist who is adamant about female self-acceptance, obliterating fat shaming and general ideals in keeping with the feminist way of thinking. She encourages acceptance of sexuality and social nudism in daily life and in and self investment in art of any form. Felicity has been a contributor for magazines such as Failure Magazine, Internaturally and the bulletin. She continues to be a notable figure in the naturist movement. Jones is one of the co-founders of Young Naturists America. Her blog, created in November 2010, is part of the Young Naturists America site. It contains a variety of topics such as nudism, social nude activities, feminism, and art projects. Since the creation of her blog, she has been interviewed by a number of news publications seeking information about nudism and specifically the Young Nudist Movement. Over the three years that she has been publishing, she has been steadily shifting focus. When she first started, Jones' blog posts were mostly about the nudist movement and her own personal experiences growing up as a third-generation nudist in America. In early 2011, Jones began writing about a broader range of topics. She believes the United States has many core social issues that could be greatly diminished by incorporating more social nudity into people's lives. Some of the broader social issues she now talks about on her blog include feminism, sexuality, body image, fat shaming, and cyber bullying. On November 7, 2013, reporter Hilary Cadigan wrote an article for Chiang Mai News titled \"Naked Brunch.\" While the article mostly dealt with Thailand’s first clothing-optional resort, The Oriental Village, the reporter cited Felicity's article, \"Why Women Should See Other Women’s Naked Bodies,\" as it dealt with body acceptance through social nudity. Jones takes part in social activism. With the aim of promoting body acceptance, she has participated in public art projects by artists such as Zefrey Throwell and body painter Andy Golub. While the art projects themselves are varied, they have all had a single common connecting factor, which is the incorporation of public nudity. On August 3, 2013, Jones was interviewed by journalist Bill Briggs for a featured article on NBC News about the lack of young nudists in America. Jones was then quoted in a Digital Journal follow-up news article. On August 4, as featured in the local news site The Citizen / AuburnPub.com, Jones attended the annual Northeast Naturist Festival in upstate New York. This festival is where naturists congregate and talk about issues facing the movement. On January 18, 2013, Jones was interviewed by the Wall Street Journal about an off Broadway naked comedy show that she co-produced.In Early 2013, the Fire Island National Seashore authorities decided to close Fire Island's nude beach. Jones was interviewed with regards to this issue by both the New York Times as well as News Day. She was also cited in the Huffington Post and the Long Island News website. On January 22, 2013, Jones was interviewed by the Chicago Tribune about the impending San Francisco anti nudity legislation as well as her thoughts about the current lack of younger people who are involved with naturism. On May 2, 2013 Jones was interviewed by Nancy Redd for Huffington Post Live. The segment was called \"Let's Get Naked\".She was also interviewed on October 19, 2012 by Hollywood Today for a piece about censorship titled \"Censorship and Social Networks – violence is in. Nipples are out!\" On June 26, 2015, Felicity, explained why naturism is a positive impact on body image - a central topic in her writings. In August 2011 Jones participated in an nude art project called Ocularpation: Wall Street by Zefrey Throwell. During this art performance she was arrested by the NYPD for disrupting the peace and for blocking traffic; the charges were dropped a few months later. Later in 2011, Jones also participated in an additional performance, this time a week-long game of strip poker in the window of an art gallery titled \"I'll Raise You One\" by the same artist which was covered by the NY Post and The Village Voice. Her latest art performance took place in July 2012 and was the brainchild of artist Andy Golub. Jones and a few other members of Young Naturists America got completely naked in Times Square and had their bodies painted by Golub. The performance attracted hundreds of spectators who clamored to get pictures of the naked models. This event was covered by Vice Magazine, which published an article titled: \"WAITING FOR THE PANTIES TO DROP IN TIMES SQUARE.\" This prompted her response blog post, \"Naked Body Painting in the Heart of New York City.\" She has also been working to promote top-free rights for women and had her first Top Free Day In Central Park in the summer of 2011.

Along with her husband, she founded Atlas Aviation in Resolute Bay, Nunavut, which was at the time the most northerly charter air service in Canada. The Phipps couple flew together to the North Pole in a Twin Otter ski plane to the North Pole, to install a radar beacon and to promote northern travel. Because no woman had been to the North Pole before, Frances' trip was included in the Guinness Book of World Records. In 1972, Fran and Weldy bought a 48 foot sailboat, and for over a decade traveled the world by sea. Phipps died in July 2013 at New Glasgow, Prince Edward Island."

He trained at Regent Street Polytehnic (now University of Westminster) and qualified in 1955. He remained in London for three years working as a housing architect but in 1958 moved to Coventry where he became an architect specialising in schools. In 1963 he returned to housing when he became principal development architect for the Midlands Housing Consortium. In 1965 he became Chief Architect and Planning Officer for Runcorn new town, developing the master plan and where he hired James Stirling to develop designs for new housing. In 1970 he moved to Milton Keynes in north Buckinghamshire, at that stage little more than a line on a map, to be General Manager of Milton Keynes Development Corporation at the young age of 39. He oversaw the major growth of the 'new city' through to 1981. Thereafter, he joined up with Terence Conran (of Habitat fame) to establish the new architecture and planning consultancy Conran Roche. The company developed a number of successful projects during the 1980s including Butler's Wharf and Michelin House in London. Ill health forced him to retire as managing director in 1988."

  "text" : "Fritz \"Freddie\" Brocksieper (born August 24, 1912 in Istanbul, Turkey; died January 17, 1990) was a German jazz-musician, drummer, and bandleader. Brocksieper was born in Constantinople but was playing professionally in Germany by 1930, working in Nuremberg and Berlin in the 1930s. During World War II he played with the Goldene Sieben (Golden Seven, 1939), Benny De Weille (1940), Willy Berking (1940–1941), and the radio orchestra of Lutz Templin, just as in the National-Socialist propaganda band Charlie and His Orchestra. His playing style on the drums was influenced above all by Gene Krupa. He recorded with his own ensembles, both large and small, in the later 1940s; he performed for American GIs in Stuttgart, Munich, and Berlin. The son of a Greek-speaking Jewish woman and a German engineer was able to get through National-Socialism as an essential swing musician. Freddie Brocksieper was considered a leading figure of early European big-band jazz. After the Second World War he led various bands in Stuttgart, Munich, and Berlin, and played also in American officers' clubs. With his bands he made it to the front page of Stars and Stripes. Beginning in 1957 Bavarian radio regularly broadcast live concerts from his studio in Munich. Brocksieper continued performing in the 1960s and 1970s, and was awarded a Deutscher Schallplattenpreis in 1980. From 1964 he played mainly in trios, and often with American soloists in Europe."

  "text" : "Federico Sforza (20 January 1603 – 24 May 1676) was an Italian Catholic cardinal. Sforza was born in 1603, the son of Alessandro Sforza, 7th Count of Santa Fiora, Duke of Segni and Prince of Valmontone - and Eleonora Orsini. In 1623 he became protonotary apostolic participante. In 1625 he was appointed governor of Terni and then of Cesena until 1626. Later he served as vice-legate in Avignon between 1637 and 1645. Pope Innocent X, elected in 1644 and concerned that so noble a house as Sforza should go without a cardinal, decided Federico Sforza should \"wear the purple\". And so, Sforza was asked to return to Rome by Pope Innocent who elevated him to cardinal in 1645 and appointed him bishop of Rimini where he served for 11 years before resigning in 1656. He participated in the conclave of 1655 which elected Pope Alexander VII and was later elected camerlengo of the Sacred College of Cardinals 1659 until 1660. He participated in the conclave of 1667 which elected Pope Clement IX and the conclave of 1669-1670 which elected Pope Clement IX. In 1675 he was elected bishop of Tivoli but died on 24 May of the following year."

  "text" : "Frank Conway Turner (5 November 1922 – 27 September 2010) was a British gymnast who took part in four Olympic Games, three as a competitor and the fourth as National Coach; he was captain of the British Gymnastics team in the 1948 Summer Olympics. Turner was four times British gymnastics champion. Born in the East End of London in 1922, Turner developed an interest in sports as a boy, training in table tennis, diving, football, boxing and gymnastics. As a flyweight Turner boxed in the semi-finals of the Amateur Boxing Association of England Championship before deciding to develop his interest in gymnastics. Aged 11 he won the South of England Boys Championship in 1933 before making his international debut aged 15 in 1938. On leaving school in 1939 he worked as a bank clerk, but during World War II he was conscripted into the Royal Artillery in 1941. He served in North Africa and Sicily and was twice wounded. On being selected to captain the British gymnastics team in the 1948 Summer Olympics, Turner and the rest of the team had little if any experience of competing at an international level, and were unofficially coached by Helmut Bantz, a recently released German prisoner of war who had stayed in England as an agricultural worker. Turner competed in the Men's Individual All-Around, the Men's Team All-Around, the Men's Floor Exercise, the Men's Horse Vault, the Men's Parallel Bars, the Men's Horizontal Bar, the Men's Rings, and the Men's Pommelled Horse. A lifelong friend was fellow competitor George Weedon. Turner was also at the 1952 Summer Olympics in Helsinki, competing in the Men's Individual All-Around, the Men's Team All-Around, the Men's Floor Exercise, the Men's Horse Vault, the Men's Parallel Bars, the Men's Horizontal Bar, the Men's Rings, and Men's Pommelled Horse. In the 1956 Summer Olympics in Melbourne Turner competed in the Men's Individual All-Around, the Men's Floor Exercise, the Men's Horse Vault,the Men's Parallel Bars, the Men's Horizontal Bar, the Men's Rings, and the Men's Pommelled Horse. As National Coach to the British gymnastics team he also attended the 1960 Summer Olympics in Rome. Turner was four times British all-around gymnastics champion, from 1949 to 1951, and again in 1953. He also took part in the 1950 World Championships in Basle, and the 1954 European Championships in Frankfurt. He achieved his International Judges Brevet award in 1963 and was awarded his ‘Master Gymnast’ in 1974. In 1964 he took a BA degree in Sports Science at the Royal Polytechnic and a BEd from the Open University before becoming a lecturer at Watford College of Technology and Dulwich College. He was made a Freeman of the City of London in 1965. He was also a Freemason. He doubled for actors including Michael Bentine and Norman Wisdom when gymnastic stunts were required in films and television dramas.He received the Honorary Award of 'Distinguished Judge' from British Gymnastics. With his wife he had two sons, Keith and Colin Turner. Frank Turner died of cancer at his home in Bricket Wood in Hertfordshire in September 2010 aged 87. His ashes were scattered in a field in Aldenham."

Chis Pinnock, who was camera operator on the Steven Spielberg film Empire of the Sun, and teaches on the Film Production course at UCA, complimented Frederick's potential during work on first short film, Pantheon. Not only did Lloyd direct Pantheon but also composed the score under his moniker of Ursine Vulpine. Pantheon was screened at the BKSTS 2012 student showcase. This was Lloyd's third film to be shown at the BFI showcase, with The Constant being shown in 2011 and The Death of the Cinema Projectionist the same year. Pantheon went on to win Best Film, Best Score and Best Production Design at Screentest Film Festival 2013. It also screened internationally at Plus Camerimage 2012 in Poland and National Film Festival for Talented Youth 2013 in Seattle, USA (which Lloyd attended) and also received a slew of nominations and shortlists from various other festivals. In July 2013, it was released online for public viewing a year after its completion. The Constant was also selected for the 2011 BBC Music Video Festival and shown on the BBC's 20 big screens around the UK. Frederick Lloyd is managed by Three Six Zero Group."

His works are located mainly in Merseyside and Northwest England, and most of them were churches. He was influenced by architectural developments on the Continent, in particular by the German Dominikus Böhm. It is unlikely that he was at all influenced by his Chilean father who died when he was five years old, he was later destined for a career in the merchant navy but was conscripted from there into the RNVR a served I in the trenches to be gassed at Paschendale, thus inevitably shortening his life, on leaving the army he went to Liverpool art school where he was discovered by Charles Riley and given a place at Liverpool School of Architecture. GV. His design of St Gabriel, Blackburn, is considered to be \"one of the milestones in the development of English church architecture towards Modern Movement style\". Although Pollard and Pevsner state that he \"worked exclusively for the Roman Catholic Church\", he did design one Anglican church, St Gabriel, Blackburn. Five of his churches have been recorded in the National Heritage List for England as designated listed buildings. The Shrine of Our Lady of Lourdes in Blackpool, and English Martyrs' Church, Wallasey are listed at Grade II*, and listed at Grade II are St Monica's Church, Bootle, St Teresa's Church, Upholland, and Holy Cross Church, Bidston. He also designed Roman Catholic schools, one of which is in Birkdale."

He studied medicine in Würzburg, Tübingen and Berlin, and after graduation (1868), he became an assistant to Friedrich Theodor von Frerichs (1819-1885) in the First Medical Clinic at the University of Berlin. In 1872 he became habilitated for special pathology and therapy (internal medicine), and from 1874 was a professor of internal medicine at the University of Dorpat. From 1886 to 1920 he served as a professor of internal medicine and director of the university polyclinic in Leipzig. He was considered an excellent diagnostician, dedicated to histological research in the field of internal medicine. His primary focus dealt with diseases of the bronchi and mediastinum as well as blood and metabolic disorders. With Paul Langerhans (1847-1888), he investigated the \"intravital storage\" of cinnabar injected intravenously into laboratory animals. The two scientists demonstrated that cinnabar was taken up by white blood corpuscles but not by red blood corpuscles. They also noted the accumulation of cinnabar in fixed cells of the bone marrow, in the connective tissue of the liver and in the capillary system. These findings were part of the research that later brought about Ludwig Aschoff’s idea of the reticuloendothelial system."

  "text" : "Fiona Paterson (born 9 February 1983) is a New Zealand rower. Paterson was born in Dunedin in 1983, and grew up in the Ida Valley as the second youngest of seven siblings. She first competed at World Rowing Junior Championships in 2000 in Zagreb, Croatia, where she came eighth with the junior women's eight. At the World Rowing Junior Championships 2001 in Duisburg, Germany, she came sixth with the junior women's eight. At the 2003 World Rowing U23 Regatta in Belgrade, Serbia, she came fourth with the U23 women's four with fellow members Bess Halley, Darnelle Timbs and Andrea Rix-Trott. She became world champion at the U23 World Rowing Championship in Poznań, Poland, in 2004 with the U23 women's quadruple sculls with fellow members Bess Halley, Darnelle Timbs and Jaime Nielsen. In January 2006 at age 22, she was diagnosed with an aggressive form of cervical cancer, was operated on and underwent chemotherapy and radiation treatment. Only a year later, she returned to rowing and was part of the women's eight that unsuccessfully tried to qualify for the 2008 Summer Olympics; at the 2007 World Rowing Championships in Munich, Germany, they came ninth, and at both the first two World Rowing Cup regattas in 2008, the team came eighth. In World Rowing Cup regattas in 2010, she competed in women's quadruple sculls with Emma Feathery, Paula Twining, and Louise Trappitt, and they came sixth in Munich, Germany, and in Lucerne, Switzerland. At the 2010 World Rowing Championships at Lake Karapiro, New Zealand, she rowed in the women's double sculls with Feathery and placed seventh. At the 2011 World Rowing Championships in Bled, Slovenia, she teamed up with Anna Reymer in the women's double sculls and won bronze. She competed in double sculls with Reymer at the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, where they placed fifth. Paterson retired after the 2012 Summer Olympics and moved to Christchurch, where she worked as a rowing coach and physical education teacher at Rangi Ruru Girls' School while completing a post-graduate teaching diploma at the city's New Zealand Graduate School of Education. In 2015, Paterson made a comeback and was selected by Rowing New Zealand to be part of the 57-strong training squad from which the nine boat teams will be chosen. At the New Zealand national championships at Lake Karapiro on 16 February 2016, Paterson competed with Rebecca Scown in the women's coxless pair, and they were beaten by Emma Dyke and Grace Prendergast for second place. When the Olympic rowing team was announced on 4 March 2016, Scown and Genevieve Behrent were chosen instead of Paterson; they would win bronze in their event."

From 1979 to 1980 he was a visiting scholar at the Institute for Advanced Study. He became a professor in Leiden and in the 2000s at Utrecht University. Beukers works on questions of transcendence and irrationality in number theory, and on other topics. In connection with the famous proof by Roger Apéry (1978) on the irrationality of the values of the Riemann zeta function evaluated at the points 2 and 3, Beukers gave a much simpler alternate proof using Legendre polynomials. He also published on questions in mechanics about dynamical systems and their exact solvability."

He became ruler of Saluzzo when Francis I of France deposed Francesco's elder brother Giovanni Ludovico, who had tried to ally Saluzzo with Emperor Charles V. Owing his title to the French King, Francesco couldn't prevent the Marquisate of Saluzzo becoming a satellite state of France. When John George, last Marquess of neighbouring Marquisate of Montferrat died, Francesco claimed the succession. But Montferrat was occupied by the Spanish under Emperor Charles V of Habsburg, who gave it to his ally Federico II Gonzaga, Duke of Mantua. Francesco died in 1537 without heirs, and the rule of Saluzzo passed on to his youngest brother Gabriel."

After schooling in Rhodesia and the United Kingdom, Mussell briefly worked as a clerk before joining the Southern Rhodesia Air Force in 1952. After two years of pilot training Mussell was granted a permanent commission and appointed to be aide-de-camp to Sir Robert Tredgold, the Chief Justice and acting governor of Southern Rhodesia. After this tour Mussell trained on the de Havilland Vampire jet fighter and was involved in ferrying Vampires from the UK to Rhodesia. In 1961 he was promoted to squadron leader and appointed to command No. 5 Squadron. In 1963 Mussell returned to the UK to attend the RAF Staff College, Bracknell. On completion of his staff training he served at the Rhodesia Air Force headquarters in the operations branch before gaining a promotion to wing commander and taking up appointment as the Director of Plans (Air) on the Rhodesian Joint Planning Staff. In 1966 Mussell was sent to Lisbon, Portugal where he joined the Rhodesian Diplomatic Mission as the First Secretary (Political). He returned to Rhodesia at the end of 1967 to take up post as the Officer Commanding RRAF Thornhill with a promotion to group captain. On completion of his time at Thornhill, Mussell returned to Air Force headquarters as the Senior Air Staff Officer. Thereafter he was appointed Director of Administration. On promotion to air commodore Mussell was appointed Director-General Operations. In 1973 he was promoted again to air vice-marshal and appointed Air Force Chief of Staff. Four years later Mussell was appointed to Commander of the Rhodesian Air Force in the rank of air marshal, succeeding Air Marshal 'Mick' McLaren. Mussell held the senior Rhodesian Air Force appointment until 1981 during which time Zimbabwe gained its independence and the air force was renamed the Air Force of Zimbabwe. Mussell was replaced by Air Marshal Norman Walsh, Robert Mugabe's appointee."

In his studies he was influenced by instructors such as Simon Schwendener (1829–1919), Friedrich Wilhelm Zopf (1846–1909) and Johannes Reinke (1849–1931). In 1905 he was named director of the botanical garden in Bremen. During the later part of his career he served as director of the botanical garden in Göttingen. He specialized in the botanical genus Solanum, as evidenced by his Solana Africana, a four-part monograph in which he provided descriptions of all known African Solanum species. In the field of lichenology, he conducted anatomical and developmental studies on the thallus of lichens. He performed significant research involving the lichen genus Parmelia (Hypogymnia)."

In March 2012, he was announced as one of the members of the Constituent Assembly of Egypt. He criticised the composition of the assembly, suggesting that 15 assembly members be replaced with constitutional law professors and legal experts. In August he was reported by Al-Ahram as having turned down an offer from President Morsi to be culture secretary."

  "text" : "Fedor Vesna (Belarusian: Фёдар Вясна, Russian: Фёдор Весна Polish: Fedor Wesna, Theodor Wiosna) was a famous 14th century Lithuanian falconer and ruler of Vitebsk from 1392 to 1393. Fedor's fame as a successful falconer introduced him to Jogaila, the Grand Duke of Lithuania and King of Poland, with whom he became great friends. When Fedor retired from falconry in the 1390s, Jogaila granted him the title of duke and after the death of the last ruler of Principality of Vitebsk, Uliana of Tver in 1392, Jogaila abolished the principality and set Fedor to rule its lands. As Fedor Vesna was not a member of the Gediminids Dynasty and not even of noble birth, his exaltation was poorly received in the Grand Duchy and made him an obvious target for rival ambitions. Švitrigaila, the younger brother of Jogaila and duke of Polotsk, briefly captured Vitebsk in 1393. According to some Lithuanian chronicles, Švitrigaila killed Fedor Vesna upon the capture of Vitebsk."

She is the editor of the Parameterized Complexity Newsletter, moderator of the parameterized complexity wiki, and publicity chair of the International Symposium on Parameterized and Exact Computation (IPEC). Rosamond obtained a PhD from Cornell University in 1981; her thesis work, supervised by David Henderson, involved developing the Cornell Mathematics Support Center, which continues to be active. While at Cornell, she also developed a program to assist adult women overcome mathematics anxiety and progress along the “Scheme of Intellectual and Ethical Development” created by William G. Perry.Rosamond’s research in education also includes computer games, including methodology for systematically generating game puzzles utilizing NP-completeness. At the University of Newcastle, Australia, Rosamond developed a new program of computer games, and a guest-visitor seminar series. Since 1998, Rosamond and her husband Michael Fellows have provided workshops on the mathematical foundations of computer science to children and adults in many countries. Rosamond orchestrated Sonia Kovalevskia Mathematics Days for girls and their teachers when she was professor of mathematics at National University in San Diego (1986-2000), and was a promoter of the San Diego Science Alliance. She received a University of Newcastle HEEP Equity Award for her investigation into increasing the number of women in computer science.

She now teaches at Jamiat al-Zahra and has been a member of the board of trustees of Jamiat al-Zahra since 1990. Mostafavi used to run a charity, together with other women, called Moasseseh Davazdah-e Farvadin, which built a public bath for women in Qom and ran sewing and cooking classes. She was also one of the co-founders, together with Fatemeh Tabatabai, the daughter in law of Khomeini's, of the Jamiat-e Zanan-e Jomhuri-ye Islami, the Society of Women of the Islamic Republic. When Mrs Mostafavi was ten or eleven years old, she was married to Mohammad Hassan Arabi (1924-2010). The couple has one daughter, Fereshteh Arabi."

  "text" : "Francesco Saverio Altamura (Foggia, August 5, 1822 -January 5, Naples, 1897) was an Italian painter, who while trained in Naples, He moved from Foggia to Naples in 1840, initially to study medicine. He was enrolled in the school of the Scolopi priests. But his interests led him to attend the Accademia di Belle Arti alongside Domenico Morelli. he also befriended Michele De Napoli. But like his friend, he became part of the protests during the insurrection of 1848. He fought in the barricades of Santa Brigida. He was briefly arrested, and condemned to death, and upon which he fled into exile in L'Aquila, then by 1950 to Florence. There he entered into the circle of artists frequenting the Caffè Michelangiolo, and the painters of the Tuscan school of the Macchiaioli. Yet Francesco's paintings, unlike those of the Macchiaioli, were focused on historic and political events. In 1855, with Morelli and Serafino De Tivoli, he traveled to the World Exposition at Paris. In 1860, he returned to Naples, this time fighting alongside the forces of Giuseppe Garibaldi. He then became active in politics as well as art. In 1861, he submitted the painting of the Funerals of Buondelmonte to the \"Prima esposizione nazionale\" held in Florence. In 1865, he frescoed the chapel of the Palazzo Reale of Naples. In 1892, he painted five altarpieces and four canvases for the restored parocchial church of Castrignano de' Greci in the province of Lecce. His first wife, Elena Bùkuras, was a Greek painter, with whom he had three children, a daughter, Sofia, and two sons who became painters Ioannis and Alessandro. But he then had two further companions, the Greek painter Eleni Sionti, and finally the painter Jane Benham Hay, with whom he had a son, painter Bernardo Hay. In 1901, a monument in his honor was erected in Foggia."

  "text" : "Francis Xavier Kurrupuwu (born 10 June 1961; also known as Maralampuwi Kurrupuwu) is an Australian politician. He was a member of the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly from 2012 to 2016. He was originally elected for the Country Liberal Party, left to sit as an independent in April 2014, and briefly joined the Palmer United Party before returning to the CLP in September 2014. Kurrupuwu was born in Nguiu on Bathurst Island, the smaller of the two main Tiwi Islands. He was named Francis Xavier (after Bishop Francis Xavier Gsell, who had established a Catholic mission on the island in 1911) by Sister Anne Gardiner. A staunch Catholic, he has worked with the Church for over thirty years, and is also manager of the Australian Red Cross on the islands. He has also held many local government roles, including President and Deputy Chair of the Nguiu Community Council, a member on the ATSIC regional council, Deputy Chair of the Tiwi Land Council and a councillor in the Tiwi Islands Shire. Kurrupuwu once stood for Labor preselection, but switched sides to the Country Liberals after losing faith in progressive politics, in particular what he called Labor's \"condescending\" policies towards Aboriginal people. At the 2012 general election, he defeated former AFL footballer Dean Rioli who was the Labor candidate for Arafura—both men are related to former member and footballer Maurice Rioli. In April 2014, Kurrupuwu was one of three indigenous MPs (alongside Alison Anderson and Larisa Lee) who resigned from the Country Liberal Party and sat as independents. The three MPs joined Palmer United later that month, with Anderson becoming the party's parliamentary leader. In September 2014, Kurrupuwu resigned from PUP and re-joined the Country Liberal Party."

  "text" : "Fritz Schaetzler (May 13, 1898 – February 3, 1994) was a German baritone and Kammersänger. He studied under Anna Bahr-Mildenburg. From 1919 to 1922, he was engaged at the Nationaltheater München; from 1922-1947, he was engaged at the Staatsoper Stuttgart. Concealing physical disabilities, including an amputated leg and a paralyzed hand, that resulted from injuries suffered during the Second Battle of Flanders, he performed throughout Europe (Prague, Bordeaux, Oslo et al.). Over the course of his career, he collaborated with prominent conductors and composers of the era (Hans Knappersbusch, Clemens Krauss, Bruno Walter, Wilhelm Furtwaengler, Richard Strauss, Hans Pfitzner, Carl Orff et al.). Roles included Wolfram, Beckmesser, Figaro, Rigoletto, Tonio. His autobiography, \"Nun Erst Recht,\" was published in 1943 (Deutscher Verlag, Berlin) and later adapted for the screen \"Sieg des Willens\" (Berlin, circa 1944/45) with Schaetzler portraying himself. Although of non-aryan heritage, and in spite of being an outspoken critic of the regime, Schaetzler survived the Nazi era through the personal intervention of Emmy Göring, a former theater colleague and wife of Hermann Göring, as well as through the tacit shielding of other high-ranking party members. Schaetzler married and divorced Hildegard Ranczak, leading Strauss soprano (Clarion, Capriccio premiere, 28 October 1942, Nationaltheater München), later marrying soprano Egidia Bonessi (German-Italian Culture Exchange, La Scala, Parma et al.). After World War II, Schaetzler served as baritone soloist for the American Forces Network (his wife succeeded Grace Moore as soprano soloist after Moore's death in 1947). Over a two and a half year period, Schaetzler and Bonessi hosted and performed on their own radio program, broadcast over AFN. With the support of Generals Dwight D. Eisenhower and George S. Patton, Schaetzler emigrated to the United States. He resided in Hollywood, California, where he was active as a vocal coach for the film industry. Students included Keith Larsen, Vera Miles, Hugh O'Brian, Ruth Roman, John Saxon, and Jay Silverheels. In the early 1950s, Schaetzler became an American citizen. He died in La Habra, California."

Born to a family of wealthy Suzhou landowners, Feng served as a compiler in Beijing's Hanlin Academy before finally serving as a private secretary to the Viceroy of Liangjiang, Li Hongzhang. In his capacity, Feng argued for self-strengthening and industrialization by borrowing western technology and military systems, while retaining core Neo-Confucian principles. In his essay, On The Manufacture of Foreign Weapons, he was famously quoted as saying: \"what we have to learn from the barbarians is only the one thing - solid ships and effective guns\", though in reality his proposals were a little more extensive. Although many of his reforms were never fully enacted, they were circulated for later generations of political reformers. They contributed to the Hundred Days Reform of 1898."

Arraita was the third Mexican journalist killed within a six-month period along the US-Mexican border. In 2004, International PEN featured Arratia, as well as the other two, Roberto Javier Mora García and Francisco Ortiz Franco, on its annual Day of the Imprisoned Writer. On 12 September 2012, the Mexican military captured Jorge Eduardo Costilla Sanchez, a.k.a. \"El Coss\", a major figure in the Gulf Cartel, who had been linked to Arratia's murder and for whom the United States government had offered a $5 million reward."

  "text" : "Frank John Minnitt (3 September 1894 – 12 May 1958) was a British illustrator and cartoonist who drew for over 100 comic papers from the 1920s to the 1950s. He is perhaps best known for his depictions of Billy Bunter in the comic Knockout between 1939 and 1958. Minnitt was born in Southgate in London in 1894, the youngest of five sons of Mary Ann Smith (1854-1943) and William Robinson Minnitt (1858-1927). Educated at the Hugh Myddleton School in Islington, aged 14 he was the London Junior Boxing Champion; later, he followed his father into working for the General Post Office (GPO) before serving with the Coldstream Guards during World War I. He was sent to France where he suffered injuries from mustard gas which affected him for the rest of his life. After the war Minnitt returned to the General Post Office, later working as a welder with a taxi firm before becoming an artist. A completely self-taught cartoonist, around 1920 Minnitt began to contribute single joke cartoons to the comics of the Amalgamated Press (AP). Subsequently his work appeared in various titles including Comic Life, Joker, Merry & Bright, Butterfly, Jolly and Sparkler. From 1936 he began to submit work to D.C. Thomson and his drawings appeared in the Fun Section of the The Sunday Post and The Dandy. He took over drawing Billy Bunter’s picture strip from C. H. Chapman in Amalgamated Press’s Knockout comic in 1939, drawing the popular character in a round-style. Minnitt drew a beaming and bouncy Bunter, which at first followed Chapman's style, then later branched into a style of his own, concentrating on slapstick humour. By 1942 the Famous Five had vanished from the strip, replaced by Jones Minor, who had all the good qualities Bunter lacked, but who was prone to being led astray by Bunter. The form-master, Mr Quelch, stayed (at least in name), but he lost his dignity and aloofness. It was an entirely different Greyfriars School from that described by Charles Hamilton in The Magnet but it became immediately popular, with Minnitt continuing to draw Bunter until shortly before he died in 1958. In the mid to late 1940s his work appeared in a number of different short-run titles issued by small publishers; these included Comicolour, Jingo, Swell Comic, Big Laugh, and various others. During World War II he lived in Leigh-on-Sea in Essex. He married Alice Davie in 1919, and had a daughter Betty (1920-2009). He married Evelynne Thelma Snell (1912-2003) in 1947 and with her had a son, John Frank Minnitt (born 1950). On his death the drawing of Billy Bunter in Knockout was taken over by artists Eric Roberts and Reg Parlett."

  "text" : "Fredrick Kaufman (1936) is an American composer. Kaufman was born in Brooklyn, New York and studied trumpet, composition and jazz at the Manhattan School of Music (BMus 1959, MMus 1960). In addition, he studied composition with Vincent Persichetti at the Juilliard School. He played trumpet with the New York City Ballet Orchestra and later became professor of composition at the University of Wisconsin. After serving as dean of the Philadelphia College for the Performing Arts from 1982 to 1985, he became director of the School of Music at Florida International University in Miami. Kaufman is the composer of over one hundred and thirty published compositions that have been performed worldwide by orchestras such as the Warsaw Philharmonic, Israel Philharmonic, Moscow Chamber Orchestra, Moscow Symphony Orchestra, Czech Radio Orchestra, St. Petersburg Philharmonic, Lithuanian Philharmonic and Chamber Orchestra, Czech National Symphony Orchestra, Czech Symphony Orchestra, Jerusalem Symphony, Instrumental Ensemble of Grenoble, London Sinfonietta, Orchestra Novi Musici (Naples, Italy), Dominican Republic National Orchestra, National Orchestra of Brazil, St. Paul Chamber Orchestra, Los Angeles Philharmonic, New World Symphony, and the Pittsburgh Symphony orchestras. His ballets have been danced by companies such as the Royal Swedish Ballet, Royal Winnipeg Ballet, Batsheva Dance Company, Bat-Dor Dance Company, and the Pennsylvania Dance Theater. Kaufman is a former Fulbright Scholar and author of The African Roots of Jazz, a groundbreaking study that drew heavily on his early musical life as a jazz trumpet player with the Woody Herman Band. He is the recipient of the Darius Milhaud Award in Composition from the Aspen Music Festival, and honors and fellowships from the National Endowment for the Arts, the Rockefeller, Guggenheim and Ford Foundations, the California, Montana and Pennsylvania Arts Councils as well as the Norwegian government. Fredrick Kaufman's Holocaust composition Kaddish, which Bernard Holland of The New York Times described as \"having the most expressive writing for strings to be heard today,\" has been performed in the major concert halls of Europe, Eastern Europe, Scandinavia, Israel, South America, Asia and throughout the United States. His works have received prizes at international competitions and have been selected for performances at festivals such as the Aspen Music Festival, Telluride Chamber Music Festival, Music Festival of the Hamptons, Sarasota Music Festival, Israel Festival, Darmstadt Festival for New Music, International Arts Festival in Vilnius, Lithuania, and the St. Cyprien International Festival of the Arts in France. Renowned artists such as Richard Stoltzman, Julius Baker, Susan Starr, Roy Malan, Mark Drobinsky, Andres Diaz, David Kim, Roberto Diaz, Yehuda Hananni, Charles Neidich, Kemal Gekic, Paul Green, Sarah Lambert Bloom, The Miami String Quartet, The Amernet String Quartet, The Diaz Trio and numerous others have recorded and performed Kaufman's concertos and chamber music. Additionally, Israeli television has paid tribute to him as a composer in the thirty-minute documentary film Fredrick Kaufman-Life of an Artist. Critics from the New York Times, the Newark Star-Ledger, the Philadelphia Inquirer, the Miami Herald, the Jerusalem Post, the London Times, the Perpignan Independent, and other newspapers around the world have described Kaufman's music as striking, individual an interesting combination of overwhelming pathos and infectious joy, brought one into the realm of musical genius. In 1985, the Statue of Liberty committee commissioned Fredrick Kaufman to write a choral work Mother of Exiles, for the re-dedication ceremonies of the Statue of Liberty. The composition was premiered by the United Nations Chorus at the ceremony and was broadcast worldwide by network television. WE THE PEOPLE 200 of the City of Philadelphia commissioned Kaufman to write his fifth Symphony, \"The American\", in 1987 for the 200th anniversary celebration of the Constitution. Maestro Kaufman conducted the premiere performance which was nationally broadcast on NBC-TV. Over the past 10 years, Kaufman has been called upon repeatedly to conduct his compositions around the world. In 1997, the Miami Herald voted Maestro Fredrick Kaufman one of the 10 most influential people in the arts in the city of Miami. Kaufman continues to circle the globe with performances in Taiwan, Hong Kong, Spain, Poland, France, the Czech Republic, Brazil, Israel and Puerto Rico. His latest multi-cultural works have received overwhelming praise in the press. His Kaminarimon (for Taiko drums and Flamenco dance) has been called \"remarkable\" and \"stunning\" and was voted as ?the number one classical composition of 2002 and \"the most imaginative new work of the year\" by, music critic, James Roos of The Miami Herald. His recently commissioned work Yin & Yang: A Dialogue for Two Grand Pianos, was launched and lauded by critics in New York and Miami, where it received its world premiere. String Quartet #6, \"The Urban\" was called \"stunning\" by the New Yorker magazine. The Urban Quartet was nominated by Lulkas Foss in 2007 for a Pulitzer Prize. The points of departure for Kaufman's writing are often gestures and sound imagery from his own wide ranging background which includes jazz and Eastern European Jewish folk traditions and a foundation deeply steeped in the classics as well as the avant garde. Kaufman continues to stretch the boundaries of standard approaches to composition and the results have been called \"startling\". In March, 2011, Fredrick Kaufman completed the \"Guernica\" Piano Concerto, a commission for the Czech National Symphony Orchestra and concert pianist Kemal Gekic. The \"Guernica\" Concerto is scheduled to be premiered and recorded in the 2013 concert season in Prague by the Czech National Symphony Orchestra at the famed Smetana Concert Hall. The \"Guernica\" Piano Concerto with Kemal Gekic and the Czech National Symphony Orchestra; his \"Kaddish\" Cello Concerto with soloist Mark Drobinsky and the Czech Radio Orchestra, and \"Seascape\" performed by the Czech Symphony Orchestra will be released on a CD recording by Parma Recording and distributed internationally by Naxos during the summer of 2013. Fredrick Kaufman currently resides with his artist wife Florence Kaufman in Miami Beach, where he holds the distinguished position of Professor Emeritus in Composition at Florida International University. Prior to that he held the position of Composer-in-Residence for the university, a position that was created specifically for him. Professor Kaufman was the founding Director of the FIU School of Music for ten years and established its internationally acclaimed FIU Music Festival. He was formerly Academic Dean of the Philadelphia College of the Performing Arts and a faculty member at the University of Wisconsin, the University of Montana at Billings, the University of London and the Rubin Academy of Music in Jerusalem, Israel. Kaufman is the founder and former Artistic Director of the St. Cyprien International Festival of the Arts held in St. Cyprien, France. He has two daughters, artist Laura BenAmots and choreographer/dancer Erica Kaufman."

In 1863, to assuage the treeless landscape, St Omer planted ‘weeping willow’ trees around the edge of the lake in Queenstown Bay and with his son Frank, and Lewis Hotop the chemist, planted amenity trees all around Queenstown. After Francis’ death, the tree-planting work was continued by Frank, a lover of trees and birds who left his estate to the Borough Council for the beautification of Queenstown."

Because of his ties to the leftist Sandinista movement and liberation theology, he was forced to leave the Society of Jesus, and, together with his brother Ernesto, had his priesthood suspended directly by Pope John Paul II, a noted anti-communist, on the grounds that his roles as a priest and a government minister were incompatible. In an open letter published in 1984, he wrote: \"I cannot conceive of a God that would ask me to abandon my commitment to the people […] From my point of view, and from my personal experience, it is possible to live […] simultaneously (in) fidelity to the church as a Jesuit and as a priest, and also devote myself to the service of the poor in Nicaragua from within the Sandinista revolution.\" Cardenal left political office in 1990, and was subsequently reinstated into the Jesuit order in 1997. In 1980, Cardenal led the Nicaraguan Literacy Campaign, a Sandinista effort that succeeded in teaching basic literacy to more than half a million people with the help of 60,000 young volunteers."

He was the second son of a farmer, and began his science writing after suffering a heart attack at a young age. He admired the writing of Olaf Stapledon, author of influential works of science fiction. As a writer, he might be best known for his series, Magnus Mensis, which was published in New Worlds from 1950 to 1961. Rayer was largely associated with the John Carnell era of New Worlds science fiction magazine. Rayer sometimes published under the pseudonyms of Chester Delray and George Longdon. His work was largely criticized by New Wave science fiction writers. From about 1960, he specialized in nonfiction and when Michael Moorcock became editor of New Worlds Rayer largely switched to nonfiction writing. Rayer's fiction has since mostly fallen out of popularity. As a technical journalist, he specialized in radio and electronics and designed electronic equipment. Rayer wrote many articles for the British magazine Practical Wireless. He held an amateur radio licence ( G30GR ), and wrote technical books and numerous articles under the name F.G. Rayer. Rayer often provided illustrations and diagrams for these. Rayer was able to buy a cottage from his writing, married a teacher named Elizabeth, and had two children. He also learned Esperanto. He died 11 July 1981 at Upton-upon-Severn, Worcestershire."

  "text" : "Frank Alamo (12 October 1941 – 11 October 2012), born Jean-François Grandin, was a French singer. He achieved his greatest success in the 1960s. He was born in Paris. He sang in a leading French children's choir, \"Les Petits Chanteurs à la croix de bois\", and studied music in London between 1957 and 1960. While skiing at Val-d'Isère in 1962, he met pop music promoter and record company executive Eddie Barclay, who heard him singing popular English and American songs in French. Barclay signed him to his label, and persuaded him to take the stage name Frank Alamo, the surname being in tribute to John Wayne's film The Alamo. Alamo helped popularise the yé-yé style of music in France. His hit records included \"Biche ô ma Biche\" (\"Sweets for My Sweet\"), \"Je veux prendre ta main\" (\"I Want to Hold Your Hand\"), and \"Je me bats pour gagner\" (\"A Hard Day's Night\"). In all, he released 30 singles over a five-year period in the early and mid-1960s, including some original songs. He retired from the music business when he married in 1969, becoming a photographer and later a manager in the automobile industry. In 1983, he was chasing a beautiful blonde girl who was driving a funny car, she brought him to a factory and there Frank Alamo bought not a single car but the whole plant: the Dallas jeep company. He sold it in 1996 in order to give further singing performances. However he never recovered success."

Francis married Sarah Margaret, the daughter of John Black, a Presbyterian clergyman.

Francis was elected in a largely Roman Catholic and francophone riding based on promises from the Liberals that separate schools in the province would be protected. Two years later, legislation was introduced abolishing separate schools in Manitoba. Francis died in Headingley."

  "text" : "Franco A. \"Frank\" Barsotti (November 20, 1937, - June 6, 2012) was an American photographer. Youngest of three children, he was born and raised in Chicago's historic Pullman area by Italian immigrant parents. Italy, where he returned often, was a common theme through much of his work, such as the series Italy 1974 and White. His noted series Artigiano consists of photographs of tools hand-made by his father. Though trained in traditional black-and-white photography, Franco embraced digital technology and was one of the earliest professors to work with digital photography. Franco received a Bachelor of Science Degree in Photography from the Institute of Design at Illinois Institute of Technology, where he studied under Harry Callahan and Aaron Siskind. He attended the graduate program in photography at Ohio University in Athens, Ohio, and received a Master of Fine Arts in Photography from the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, where he also taught for 38 years. The following is an excerpt from a statement from the School of the Art Institute of Chicago upon Frank Barsotti's death on June 6, 2012: While teaching at the SAIC, Frank completed his MFA (1969), and a suite of his black-and-white photographs from this period are in the permanent collection of the Art Institute of Chicago. Along with Professor Fred Endsley, Frank was one of the first faculty members to experiment with digital technology. He was an intrepid maker, and early on, championed alternative and non-silver processes, and what was then considered radical digital processes. Frank was a passionate and dedicated teacher, unafraid to deliver forceful opinions on art and education. He believed strongly in the art school process of dialogue, experimentation, and critique, and this legacy endures in his department and beyond. Though living in Washington State for the [last] 10 years [of his life], Frank was born and raised in Chicago's historic Pullman area and spent the majority of his life in and dedicated to Chicago. He taught alongside luminaries including Joyce Niemanas, Barbara Crane, and Ken Josephson, and during his years at SAIC taught nearly 2,000 students."

Von Hoesslin was one of foremost conductors of Wagner's music in the 1920s and 1930s, conducting at the Bayreuth Festival in 1927, 1928 and 1934, and – despite having been exiled – again in 1938, 1939 and 1940 after the personal intervention of Winifred Wagner. The exile to Switzerland was occasioned after Hoesslin, then Music Director of the Breslau Opera, refused to conduct the playing of the Horst-Wessel song at a state ceremony. He and his wife were given 28 days to leave the city. Hoesslin responded by one final sold-out concert at which he pointedly conducted Beethoven's Ninth Symphony concluding with Schiller's \"Ode to Joy\". The von Hoesslins went first to Florence, but when Benito Mussolini's Italy also presented problems, then moved to Geneva where Ernest Ansermet had invited von Hoesslin to conduct the Orchestre de la Suisse Romande. On September 25, 1946 the von Hoesslins were killed in an airplane accident while returning to Geneva from Barcelona. After missing the scheduled flight and being pressed to conduct a performance of Così fan tutte at the Geneva Opera, the couple chartered a small private plane. The plane crashed in the sea off Sète, killing all on board."

In 1893, Dutreuil de Rhins and Grenard, left Xinjiang in order to cross Tibet and reach Xining in Qinghai. In December, they reached Lake Namtso, the men and animals exhausted and their supplies run out after a journey that had taken them three months longer than anticipated. The authorities refused them permission to enter Lhasa and ordered them to turn back, in spite of the bitter cold and lack of supplies. The following summer, Dutreuil de Rhins was wounded in a skirmish with a group of Golok bandits in lawless country near Tom-Boumdo (province of Qinghai). Grenard tried to save him but in the end was forced to leave him to his death. All the expedition's papers were stolen but eventually Grenard persuaded the Chinese authorities to take action against the criminals and the papers were recovered. Grenard published a report on the expedition under the title \"Mission scientifique dans la Haute-Asie\" (\"A scientific mission to upper Asia\") (1897–1898). He went on to write various books about the history of Central Asia, including lives of Genghis Khan and the Mughal ruler Babur/Baber."

In 1820 he also founded a private eye clinic in Leipzig. During the late 1850s he succumbed to severe amblyopia, causing him to quit his practice and limit his workload to literary pursuits. Eventually he went completely blind and died in 1866 at the age of 83. Ritterich made contributions involving writings on squint, and investigations on diseases of the lachrymal nasal canal and the effect of the eye muscles (with anatomist Eduard Weber 1806-1871)."

When the Franco-Prussian War broke out in 1870 she volunteered for military nursing. She was put in charge of the hospital at Marange and then Homburg by the Crown Princess of Prussia, Queen Victoria's eldest daughter. For her service during the war she was awarded the cross of the German order of merit. In 1874, after her return to England, she conducted a survey of hospitals and nursing practices in London. This led to the formation of the Metropolitan and National Nursing Association to provide training in London. Florence Lees was appointed as its first superintendent. On 16 September 1879, she married the Reverend Dacre Henry Craven. In 1889, her book, A Guide to District Nurses, was published. She died on 19 October 1922 and was buried in Walton-on-the-Naze, Essex."

Francesco Bonatelli was born in Iseo, Brescia, Italy on April 25, 1830. He first studied philosophy at the University of Vienna and later taught that subject at the universities of Bologna (1861–1867) and Padua (1867–1911). He was also one of the principal editors of Filosofia delle scuole italiane, a review founded in 1870 by Terenzio Mamiani which was dedicated to defending a Platonizing position. However, he resigned in 1874 when the Platonist Giovanni Maria Bertini published criticisms of Catholicism that Bonatelli considered too bold. He was responsible for the introduction the analytic method of German psychologists Johann Friedrich Herbart and Rudolf Hermann Lotze into Italy. Bonatelli theorised on the nature of consciousness, trying to explain consciousness' capacity for free action while nevertheless being involved with mechanical and logical necessities. He placed Man at the center of his philosophical thought and defended Idealism against the philosophies of Positivism and Materialism that were growing in popularity in the 19th century. He was a member of the Italian societies Accademia Nazionale dei Lincei and Accademia Galileiana di Scienze, Lettere ed Arti. Bonatelli's grandson was the famous Italian philosopher Bernardino Varisco. Bonatelli died in Padua, Italy on May 13, 1911."

  "text" : "François Fauvel Gouraud (1808 – 16 June 1847) was a French expert in photography and mnemonics. He was most known as an expert on daguerreotypes, which in January 1839 had become the first publicly announced photographic process, invented in France by Louis Daguerre (1787–1851). Gouraud was an agent for the sole producer, Alphonse Giroux & Cie, when he late 1839 sailed to America in order to introduce the invention and give lectures. He also brought the equipment and became the person introducing it to America. In 1840 he spent time in Boston and sold the first camera to Samuel Bemis (1793–1881), one of the earliest photographers in USA. That camera was exhibited in George Eastman House as the first photographic camera in USA. Gouraud also published an article entitled A Description of the Daguerreotype Process, or a Summary of M. Gouraud's Public Lectures, according to the principles of M. Daguerre; with a description of a provisory method for taking Human Portraits. He toured the northeast of USA, being in Buffalo in 1842, selling even to Samuel Morse (1791–1872) who had taken an interest since meeting Daguerre in Paris in 1839. Later in the 1840s he was a contributor to the development of the Mnemonic major system as it is known today, a way of remembering numbers. Gouraud was originally from Martinique. He died in Brooklyn only 39 years old in 1847. His wife had died a month before, and the two children were now orphans. His son colonel George Edward Gouraud (1842–1912) became a Medal of Honor recipient, and had a similar civil career, as he became Thomas Edisons agent in London and in 1888 brought the new Edison Phonograph cylinder audio recording technology to England. His daughter Clemence Emma Gouraud (1838–1913) was married in 1857 to the reverend and poet Horatio Nelson Powers (1826–1890)."

  "text" : "Frederick Hastings (21 July 1838 – 15 January 1937), was an English Congregational minister and writer. Hastings was born on 21 July 1838, the son of George and Sarah Hastings. His father was a merchant and shipowner in London, and the son began his active life in his father's office. Later, he joined a Greek New Testament class started by the pastor of the church he attended, and after a sermon by Charles Spurgeon at the Surrey Music Hall he decided to become a minister and entered Hackney College. In 1862 he became pastor of the historic Quay Meeting of the Congregational Church at Woodbridge, Suffolk. After four years there he went out to New Brunswick as a minister at Saint John. In 1870 he returned to England to a charge at Wanstead, where he remained for two years. His next appointment was at Weston-super-Mare from 1872 to 1881. Then he had seven years at the Institutional Church at Tolmers Square. At the request of Dr. R. W. Dale he went to Australia in 1889 as minister of a church in North Adelaide and remained there five years. He came back to London in 1894 to Markham Square, Chelsea, and preached there till 1903, when he went back to Tolmers Square for 10 years. In 1912 he was appointed to Clifton Church, Peckham, where he remained for six years, going to Eastbourne in 1920. In 1932, at the age of 94, he celebrated the 70th anniversary of his induction to the pastorate by preaching in his church. Mr. Hastings was a traveller in many lands. He returned from Australia via Paraguay and wrote letters which helped to prevent the exodus of shearers and other labourers from Australia. He visited so many countries on his bicycle that he received the sobriquet of \"the cycling parson\", a name he employed in one of his many books. He claimed to have ridden some 30,000 miles, visiting France, Saxony, the coat of Italy to Rome, and many parts of the Mediterranean coast. After the War he cycled to Ypres. Mr. Hastings was an ex-chairman of the London Congregational Union, and for some years served on the London County Council. He was a delegate representing the Free Churches at the tercentenary of the signing of the Edict of Nantes. for eight years he was editor of the Homilectic Magazine and of Nisbet & Co's Theological Library. Sketching, boating, cycling and chess, as well as travel, were the recreations of a long and useful career. His union with his first wife, Emily Brightman, who died in 1925, lasted for 63 years. At the age of 88 he married the widow of Mr W. Wallace Copland, of Gibraltar. He had three sons and two daughters."

He served about fifteen years as librarian and editor at the Österreichisches Institut für Bauforschung in Vienna. In addition, he produced a number of translations into German of leading SF authors, including Herbert W. Franke, Stanislaw Lem, Philip K. Dick, Kobo Abe, Cordwainer Smith, Brian W. Aldiss and the Strugatski brothers. In 1973 his New York anthology View From Another Shore of European science fiction introduced a number of continental authors to the English-reading public. Some of the authors in the work are Stanislaw Lem, Josef Nesvadba, Gerard Klein and Jean-Pierre Andrevon. The year 1975 saw the start of his series Die phantastischen Romane. For seven years it re-published works of both lesser- and better-known writers as well as new ones, ending with a total of 28 volumes. In the years 1979-1985 he brought out translations of H. G. Wells's works in an eighteen volumes series. Rottensteiner provoked some controversy with his negative assessment of American science fiction; \"what matters is the highest achievements, and there the US has yet to produce a figure comparable to H.G. Wells, Olaf Stapledon, Karel Čapek or Stanisław Lem.\"  Rottensteiner describedRoger Zelazny, Barry N. Malzberg, and Robert Silverberg as producing \"travesties of fiction\" and stated \"Asimov is a typical non-writer, and Heinlein and Andersonare just banal\".  However, Rottensteiner praised Philip K. Dick, listing him as one of \"the greatest SF writers\". From 1980 through 1998 he was advisor for Suhrkamp Verlag's Phantastische Bibliothek, which brought out some three hundred books. In all, he has edited about fifty anthologies, produced two illustrated books (The Science Fiction Book (1975) und The Fantasy Book (1978)) as well as working on numerous reference works on science fiction. His close association with and promotion of Lem until 1995 was a factor in the recognition of the latter in the United States. Rottensteiner has been the editor of Quarber Merkur, the leading German language critical journal of science fiction, since 1963. In 2004, on the occasion of the hundredth number of this journal, he was awarded a special Kurd-Laßwitz-Preis."

Philip Egerton, D.D., Rector of Astbury, by Frances, daughter of John Offley. He died at Naples on 26 January 1762, and was succeeded by his son John Haskins Eyles-Stiles. His wife died shortly afterward, before 23 April 1763, when the probate of her estate was granted to her son. Sir John Haskins Eyles-Stiles, 4th Baronet, was born 16 April 1741, and died unmarried on 1 November 1768 aged 27. He was buried 4 days later at St Helen's Bishopsgate. The baronetcy became extinct. His only surviving sister, Mary, born on 16 January 1745, married her cousin Philip Egerton of Oulton, Cheshire, in or before 1766. Her husband died in 1786, aged 54, and she died in December 1821.

  "text" : "Frank Finkel (January 29, 1854 – August 28, 1930) was an American who rose to prominence late in his life and after his death for his claims to being the only survivor of George Armstrong Custer's famed \"Last Stand\" at the Battle of the Little Bighorn on June 25, 1876. Historians disagree over whether Finkel's claim is accurate; although he provided several details that would only have been known by someone who was at Little Bighorn, there are inconsistencies in his accounts of events. Finkel was born in Ohio to German immigrant parents in 1854. He and others claimed that he enlisted in the United States Army in the early 1870s and served under George Custer during the Great Sioux War of 1876. During the Battle of the Little Bighorn Finkel claims he was wounded early in the fighting and his horse bolted from the battle. After being nursed back to health he traveled to St. Louis, then settled in Columbia County, Washington. Over the next 40 years he amassed a significant estate as a farmer in the town of Dayton, and came to be regarded as one of Dayton's \"pioneers\". Sometime around 1920, he began telling companions that he survived the Battle of the Little Bighorn, and for the next several years recounted his alleged experiences in the battle. Historians who support Finkel's claim argue that several details in Finkel's account could only be known by someone who was at Little Bighorn, including details of events in the battle that were not widely known until after Finkel's death, and the location and quantity of streams of potable water in the area. Those who disagree with Finkel's claim argue that records at the time do not indicate the existence of Frank Finkel, and that the United States Army knows the fate of all the people who have been suggested as possible false names for Finkel."
