Born George Winn, he was the only son of Pelham Winn, of South Ferriby, Lincolnshire, by Elizabeth Wighton, daughter of Reverend Gilbert Wighton by Elizabeth Allanson, sister of William Allanson, of Bramham Biggin, Bramham, Yorkshire. He entered Lincoln's Inn in 1744 and was called to the Bar in 1755. In 1761 he was appointed a Baron of the Exchequer, a post he held until 1776. He had succeeded to the estates of his cousin Mark Winn, of Little Warley, Essex, in 1763. In 1776 he was created a Baronet, of Little Warley in the County of Essex. In 1777 he also succeeded to the estates of his cousin Charles Allanson of Bramham Biggin and took the additional surname of Allanson. In 1789 Allanson-Winn was returned to Parliament for Ripon. He was elected through his connection with William Lawrence, who managed the elections in Ripon, brother-in-law of the widow of Allanson-Winn's cousin Charles Allanson (who had previously represented Ripon in Parliament). He continued to represent Ripon until 1798, during which time he was a silent supporter of William Pitt the Younger's administration. Having earlier petitioned Pitt for an Irish peerage, he made a renewed petition in 1793. He was rewarded four years later when he was made an Irish peer as Lord Headley, Baron Allanson and Winn, of Aghadoe in the County of Kerry. Lord Headley married firstly his kinswoman Anne Winn, daughter of Sir Rowland Winn, 4th Baronet, of Nostell Priory, in 1765. They had one daughter. After her death in October 1774 he married secondly Jane Blennerhassett, daughter and co-heiress of Arthur Blennerhassett, of Ballyseedy, County Kerry, in 1783. They had two sons and two daughters. He died in April 1798 and was succeeded in his titles by his eldest son, Charles."

Born in San Salvador on March 13, 1939, Cortez was admitted to the El Salvador Military Academy at age 17. On January 29, 1960, he went to San Antonio to attend flight school at Randolph Air Force Base. Cortez received high marks, and returned a year later as a certified pilot. In 1962 he was promoted to lieutenant and awarded the Civic Merit Honor military medal. Cortez remained in the air force; in 1965 he became commander of a patrol and battle group, and in 1967 was promoted to captain. On July 15, 1969, Cortez was injured in the leg while engaged in an air attack on Toncontín International Airport in Honduras. On July 17, 1969, while flying a Goodyear FG-1D Corsair, he was engaged in an air battle above San Jose de La Fuente, El Salvador, with Honduran F4U-5s and hit with a 20mm cannon from one of the planes. Mortally wounded, Cortez managed to keep his plane aloft until reaching the outskirts of the city while radioing that he was going to try to find an uninhabited area to land. He crashed on the outskirts of the city, and was killed on impact. Cortez was the highest-ranking officer among the casualties of the 100-Hour War."

  "text" : "Galeotto Franciotti della Rovere (1471 – September 11, 1507) was an Italian Roman Catholic bishop and cardinal. della Rovere was born in Lucca in 1471, the son of Francesco Franciotti and Luchina della Rovere, a member of the House of della Rovere. He was a grand-nephew of Pope Sixtus IV and a nephew of Pope Julius II. His half-brother, Sisto Gara della Rovere, also became a cardinal. He was elected Bishop of Lucca in October or November 1503 and occupied that office until his death. He was consecrated as a bishop by his uncle Pope Julius II. Pope Julius II made him a cardinal priest in the consistory of November 29, 1503. He received the red hat and the titular church of San Pietro in Vincoli on December 6, 1503. On August 30, 1504, he became the apostolic administrator of the see of Benevento, and filled this office until his death. He became administrator of the see of Cremona from May 27, 1505, holding that post until shortly before his death. He was Vice-Chancellor of the Holy Roman Church from May 31, 1505 until his death. In May 1506, he was papal legate to Bologna. In August 1507, he became administrator of the see of Vicenza. He was a patron of the arts and a good friend of Cardinal Giovanni de' Medici, who later became Pope Leo X. One historian notes: \"Although Giovio states explicitly that this newly formed intimacy between the Medici and Franciotto had its origin in the diplomatic aims of the former rather than in any mutual inclination of the two young men, yet it is certain that ere long Giovanni grew deeply attached to Galeotto, and that the sorrow expressed by him at the papal nephew's sudden and premature death was both genuine and abiding, for on the testimony of Tommaso Inghirami, we learn that in after years, when the Cardinal de' Medici had been transformed into the Pontiff Leo X, he could not endure to hear Galeotto's name mentioned in his presence, and if anyone were so careless as to allude to his passed friend, the Pope would invariably turn aside his face to hide the tears he was unable to repress. And in the Medici's case this instance of real affection is of peculiar interest, for with the exception of his brother Giuliano, there exists no record of Leo showing any strong affection towards any one of his contemporaries save this nephew of Julius II.\" della Rovere died of fever in Rome on September 11, 1507. He is buried in Santi Apostoli, Rome."

In Geneva, he collected insects in his spare time, encouraged by the curator of the Entomological collections of the University of Geneva Dr. Emil Frey-Gessner (1826–1917). In addition to his own collections, he purchased world Coleoptera and plant collections, including one by Johann Luzi Krättli (1812–1903), which he then presented to the Botanical Museum of the University of Zurich. Some parts of his beetle collection were sold to the French entomologist René Oberthür and are now preserved in the Muséum national d'Histoire naturelle, Paris."

Veteran singers such as Vani Jayaram, Mano, Abida Parween, Anuradha Sriram, P Unnikrishnan, Madhup Mudgal, Srikumar and many others have sung Rajan's compositions. He has travelled all over India and to many cities in the former Soviet Union, France, Italy, Spain, Portugal, United Kingdom, Russia, China, Iran, UAE, Oman, Qatar, Germany, Hungary, Latvia, Belgium, Luxembourg, The Netherlands, Switzerland, Columbia, Sri Lanka, Canada, United States of America and Malaysia as a concert flautist and composer.

She competed in the 200 metres at the 2001 World Youth Championships in Athletics, then switched to the hurdles for the 2002 World Junior Championships in Athletics. At the age of seventeen she placed fifth in the 100 m hurdles at the 2002 African Championships in Athletics. She ran a personal best of 13.59 seconds to win at the 2003 African Junior Athletics Championships and also placed second in the 400 metres hurdles as well as helping Senegal to third in the 4×100 metres relay. Faye entered the 2004 African Championships but was disqualified. Her senior breakthrough came at the 2006 event, where she took the hurdles bronze medal and was part of the fourth-placed Senegalese relay team. She placed fifth at the 2007 All-Africa Games and was fourth in the relay, but time-wise she remained off her junior peaks. She finally bettered her 2003 personal best in the 2009 season and she ended that year with a high at the 2009 Jeux de la Francophonie by taking the silver medal in a personal best of 13.35 seconds. She was runner-up to Seun Adigun at the 2010 African Championships. Faye won at the CAA Brazzaville and Gabriel Tiacoh meets that year and had a season's best of 13.45 seconds in La Chaux-de-Fonds. She was elected as Africa's hurdles representative for the 2010 IAAF Continental Cup and she came seventh. She was based mainly in France in 2011 and she broke the Senegalese record for the 60 metres hurdles with a run of 8.22 seconds. She ran at the 2011 All-Africa Games but only finished seventh. Her switch to France paid off in 2012, as she opened her outdoor season with a personal best of 13.33 seconds, then bettered that with a run of 13.17 seconds at the French Athletics Championships. At the 2012 African Championships the defending champion Adigun slipped, enabling Faye to take the lead and win her first continental hurdles title."

On departure, he stowed away (this may not have been deliberate, according to Alemayehu Geda, 2004). On arrival, the captain entrusted the young boy to a rich Austrian family, who adopted him. This good fortune opened to him the opportunity to study the German language and to go to school. His exposure to Western education was thorough, and he pursued medical studies at Berlin University. He returned to his country and became private secretary and interpreter to the Emperor Menelik II, who defeated the Italian colonial army in 1896 at the Battle of Adwa. Later on, while the Haile Selassie was still the successor to the throne, he fulfilled important administrative functions. He served as inspector of the important Addis Ababa-Djibouti railway until his premature death in 1919."

Charles Goldsboro finished his medical degree at Sydney University in 1868 and returned to Auckland, where his son George was born in 1870. George studied under R. Mackay Fripp from 1884 to 1888. Fripp had arrived in Auckland in 1881, opened an architectural office and later became the secretary of the Auckland Society of Arts, where he introduced architecture classes and competitions. In 1888 Fripp left for Canada and Goldsbro’ for Australia. Goldsbro’ worked in Sydney and Melbourne under Sulman & Power, Howard Joseland and Theo Kemnis. In 1896 Fripp joined Goldsbro' in partnership in Auckland but left again in 1898 for Canada. Goldsbro’ was the Hon Architect to the Anglican Diocese and designed the chapel of St Saviour’s Papatoetoe; the Presbyterian church in Uxbridge Road, Howick; St Luke’s in Russell Road Manurewa, St George’s Parish Hall Papatoetoe; the Orphans’ Home Papatoetoe and the Paterson wing at St. John’s College. Goldbro’ designed many houses, including his own house at 66 Gillies Ave (1905); the Bloomfield house Gladstone Road (demolished 1999); the Goldie house St Georges Bay Road (demolished); the Friend house 33 Owens Road; the Coates house Pencarrow Ave; the Kidd house 74 Gillies Ave (1903); 11 Kimberley Road; 23 Seaview Road and 20 Orakei Road. From 1902 to 1909 Goldsbro' was in partnership with Henry Wade. In 1909 the firm designed the main building of Auckland Girls Grammar School. During the First World War Goldsbro' went into partnership with E Holm Biss, then the firm became Goldsbro' and Carter in 1920s. This was the first architectural firm with a strong Arts and Crafts influence to initiate the shingle and tile movement in Auckland. The practice also trained several important Auckland architects, such as Gerald Jones and Frederick Browne."

  "text" : "Gene Weltfish (born Regina Weltfish) (August 7, 1902 – August 2, 1980) was an American anthropologist and historian working at Columbia University from 1928 to 1953. She had studied with Franz Boas and was a specialist in the culture and history of the Pawnee people of the Midwest Plains. Her 1965 ethnography, The Lost Universe: Pawnee Life and Culture, is considered the authoritative work on Pawnee culture to this day. She is also known for the 1943 pamphlet for the U.S. Army, called The Races of Mankind, which she co-wrote with Ruth Benedict. It was intended to educate military personnel about the cultural differences among the peoples of the world in preparation for their fighting with a variety of allies from other cultures. The authors stated that perceived differences between the races are cultural rather than biological. Among the data used in the text was an IQ study from World War I, which found higher scores among some northern Blacks in the United States forces than among some southern Whites. The pamphlet was not widely circulated within the Army, and by the early 1950s, it was banned as subversive. Engaged in social activism during the 1940s, Weltflish attracted the attention of the FBI, which suspected her (and others on the Left) of being a communist. In 1952 and 1953 she was called to Congress for questioning by two of the Senate sub-committees dedicated to investigating \"un-American activity\" during the 1950s red scare. Two weeks before appearing at a 1953 hearing, in which she refused to answer questions from staffer attorney Roy Cohn and Senator Joseph McCarthy as to whether she was a communist, her 16-year appointment at Columbia was terminated. She was blacklisted and unable to find an academic position for nearly a decade. During her last decade in academia full-time, she taught at Fairleigh Dickinson University. She continued to teach part-time after retirement."

Another of his teachers was Girolamo Mercuriale, who was Chair of Clinical Medicine in Padua from 1580-87. Casseri fell out with Fabricius, initially it seems as Fabricius resented the ethusiasm of the students for Casseri's teaching when Fabricius was ill. He wrote Tabulae anatomicae, probably the most important anatomical treatise in the seventeenth century, published in Venice, in 1627. The book contained 97 copper-engraved pictures, by Francesco Valesio, inspired by Odiardo Fialetti, Italian painter and former student at Titian's school. The pictures in this book were copied in the works of his successor at Padua, Adriaan van den Spiegel (1578–1625).His De vocis auditusque organis historia anatomica was published in 1600-1 in Ferrara."

  "text" : "Glenn Llopis is a Cuban-American entrepreneur, author, motivational speaker, business consultant and former C-suite corporate executive. He is best known as the Opportunity Expert because of his expertise in identifying and solving for business opportunity gaps that others don’t see, such as those influenced by the cultural demographic shift that are largely being ignored or misunderstood by U.S. leadership. This business critical acumen stems from what he calls “the immigrant’s perspective,” and he has developed a proprietary methodology based on this leadership point of view that teaches business, government, university and other leaders how to see through a lens of opportunity by adopting a mindset of continuous survival, renewal and reinvention. Most of his writings, speaking engagements and consulting assignments focus on leadership, change management, career advancement, marketing diversity management, entrepreneurship, business development and turn-around operations. He promotes the idea that if people embrace and adopt the immigrant mentality, they will have a distinct advantage in business and in life by being able to see and seize previously unseen opportunities, and opportunities others don’t see at all. Llopis’ research has identified 6 natural characteristics of the 21st century leader that define this immigrant mentality."

An aspect that accompanied the new president was its effort to keep squad's important players, which goes against the old capitalist policy imposed by the preceding president Zezé Perrella, which took post from 1995-2002 and 2008-2011. Fact that was very criticized by the supporters; that provided the basis for a manifestation in the possession, including banners charging for a policy change, that might have instigated the new president to adhere to a new prudence."

In 1996 and 1997 Auger was awarded the National Native Role Model by the Governor General of Canada and spent the next two years visiting more than 30 communities across Canada, inspiring his aboriginal peers, relating stories about his experiences and bonding with locals through cultural events and ceremonies. Auger is the first aboriginal recipient of the Rotary International Integrity Award for the Avenue of Nations in Alberta. After being spotted at the opening ceremonies of the 1995 Canada Winter Games, Auger was given a supporting role in the 1998 film Il mio West (later dubbed Gunslinger’s Revenge), also starring David Bowie and Harvey Keitel. Filmed in Italy for Pacific Pictures, it was the first spaghetti western to use First Nations actors in aboriginal roles. In 1999 Auger became the first aboriginal recipient of the Rotary International Integrity Award for the Avenue of Nations in Alberta. Auger had a lead role in the 2002 National Geographic IMAX-production Lewis & Clark: Great Journey West, and the next year he played Crow Hunter in an episode of the four-part Hallmark Entertainment TV miniseries Dreamkeeper. In 2005 Auger had the supporting lead of Soaring Eagle in the first episode of the Steven Spielberg’s DreamWorks-produced six-part miniseries Into the West; in 2006 he completed the film Klatsassin with Stan Douglas; and in 2007 he was cast as Chief Ambrose McQuinna in the CTV-produced Luna: Spirit of The Whale with Adam Beach, Graham Greene, Tantoo Cardinal and Jason Priestley of Beverly Hills, 90210. In addition to being in the opening and closing ceremonies for the Arctic Winter Games as Anook the Rockman for The Heroes Journey in 2010, Auger had a role in the cult classic FUBAR 2 and played a Native guide and interpreter in Western Confidential (starring FUBAR’s Paul Spence) as well as a Native policeman in The Plateau. In 2011 Auger had a cameo on primetime series Blackstone and landed the lead role of Pawnee Killer who represents the Indian resistance in Entertainment One's historical western drama Hell on Wheels, directed by David Von Ancken and filmed in Calgary. Auger produced, wrote and directed the 2007 short film Walking Alone about the life of rapper Shawn Bernard, and the 2008 National Film Board of Canada documentary Honour Thy Father that tells the story of his conflict with the Anglican Church (which refused his late father to have a traditional native funeral), and won Best Film Representing Cultural Diversity at the Alberta Motion Picture Industry Awards in 2009. In 2012 he wrote and produced the series The Ancients for Aboriginal Peoples Television Network and worked on the sequel to his film Honour Thy Father—Our Journey Home, which deals with Christianity and Native spirituality in Indian country. He was also cast in the soon-to-be filmed Scattered Leaves: Legend of the Ghostkiller and the horror movie The Silent Darkness—The Rise of The Witch. Auger has been featured in commercials for Pfizer Pharmaceuticals in Los Angeles and a South Korean car commercial for Magnus. As owner and Chief Executing Officer of the business Black Eagle Entertainment, Auger aims to produce films, television series and documentaries aiming to advance the status and expose the stereotyping of his people. In 2013, Auger worked on his latest film project Jesus in the Lodge - The Forgotten Truth of the Wilderness where he explored the idea that the Son of God was the first Sundancer, for he was one of the first men to give his flesh to a tree. Auger had a busy fall in 2015, with roles in three short films. In October, he flew to St. Petersburg, Russia to film Petersburg. A Selfie, a collection of seven stories by director Natalia Kudryashova. The theme is Russia’s most beautiful city seen through the perspective of seven women on the concept of love. Anichkov Bridge is one of the stories in which Auger plays a modern-day Native American with a rock star style, making cinematic history as the first indigenous actor to shoot a film in Russia. In Bohemian Blood, an independent short film he produced for The Frightening 48 Hour Film Challenge, Auger’s role is an indigenous cult leader of murderous artist hookers who use hammers to kill their Johns in a bohemian-style brothel. In December, he will be cast in Australian production Lost Face, a classic story by Jack London that takes place in mid-1800’s Russia."

  "text" : "Gretel Beer (Vienna, 11 July 1921 – 11 August 2010, Deal, Kent) was an Austrian-born English author of cooking books and travel reports. She also served as a cookery writer for The Daily Telegraph. and the Daily Express newspapers. Beer was born into a Jewish family as Margaret Weidenfeld. She was mostly raised by her aunt Olga Springer (Bechin, Bohemia 1879–1942 Maly Trostenets extermination camp) the widow of a physician (in 1937: 9th district, Porzellangasse 45), as her mother Regina Weidenfeld nee Pisk died when Margaret was six years old and her father, Dionys (Duny) Weidenfeld, did not keep up a household. (At Porzellangasse, until 1938 Eric Pleskow and Ari Rath spent their childhood, as they told the Austrian broadcaster ORF in 2012.) After attending primary school at Marchegg, a small town east of Vienna near the border with Slovakia, she attended a federal Realschule at Vereinsgasse in Vienna's 2nd district, where many Jewish Viennese lived. In the spring of 1938, after the annexation of Austria by Germany, she and 48 other pupils were forced to leave this school and attend a Jewish class somewhere else in Vienna. At the entrance hall of her school, which is now called Bundesrealgymnasium Vereinsgasse, since 1989 the names of the expelled pupils are displayed on a memorial inscription. Her father managed to emigrate to England and arranged for her to leave the Third Reich with a Kindertransport arranged by British NGOs. In March 1939 she arrived in Harwich and worked in several professions in England. In 1943 she married Dr Johann (Hans) Beer, son of the lawyer Oskar Beer. Hans had studied law at the Vienna University until 1938 and finished his studies in England. He was later able to work as British lawyer. The couple later lived in an apartment at Gray's Inn in London and in a manor house in Deal, Kent. She worked in advertising and public relations, and after the war she was successful with her cookery books and her journalistic work, e.g. for the Daily Telegraph and Vogue. She travelled to Austria at least once a year and kept the typical Viennese German useful to describe the secrets of Viennese cuisine. Her husband died in 1981 in their manor house, during a fire which he could not escape in his wheelchair."

In the eighteenth century the Besozzi family produced several important oboists who worked in Turin, Naples, London, Paris and Dresden. Giuseppe's brothers Alessandro Besozzi and Paolo Girolamo Besozzi lived in Turin, and his sons Antonio Besozzi in Naples and Gaetano Besozzi in Paris and London. Antonio Besozzi's son Carlo Besozzi worked in Dresden and Gaetano's son Girolamo Besozzi, the grandfather of the composer Louis Désiré Besozzi, worked in Paris. The eldest son of Cristoforo Besozzi came to Parma in 1701, where he was trained as an oboist. He became a member of the Ducal hautboy band Guardia Irlandese, created in 1702 by Antonio Farnese, Duke of Parma, on 1 June 1711. In 1728 he was appointed virtuoso suonatore di oboe di SAS at the court of the prince. In 1734 he was assigned to the court of the King of Naples, where he worked until 1738 at the age of 52, probably leaving for problems with his eyes. Thereafter, he devoted himself to teaching."

  "text" : "Graham Richard Ihlein (born 11 November 1951) is an Australian politician. He was an Australian Labor Party member of the Victorian Legislative Assembly from 1982 until 1985, representing the electorate of Sandringham. Ihlein was born in the Sydney suburb of Lakemba, and attended Yagoona State School. His family later moved to Victoria, where he attended Morwell High School and studied law at Monash University. He worked as a research officer (1974-1975) and senior industrial officer (1975-1979) for the Australian Public Service Association, and was a federal industrial officer for the Australian Telecommunications Employees Association from 1979 until 1982. Ihlein had joined the Labor Party in 1975, had been the Sandringham campaign manager in 1979, and was a member of the party's economic policy committee from 1981 to 1982. Ihlein was elected to the Legislative Assembly at the 1982 state election, winning the formerly safe Liberal seat of Sandringham. Sandringham had been held by the Liberal Party since its inception, and while the seat had become considerably more marginal since a 1976 redistribution, the incumbent Liberal MLA, Max Crellin, had held off Labor challenges in 1976 and 1979. Ihlein campaigned for eighteen months prior to the election, and focused heavily on retaining the Sandringham railway line, which had been threatened with closure under a report made for the previous government. The campaign proved to be successful, with Ihlein winning a narrow victory as the Cain Labor government won office statewide. A redistribution prior to the 1985 election made Sandringham notionally Liberal again. Ihlein instead contested and lost Evelyn to Liberal Jim Plowman, while Ihlein staffer and future federal MP Ann Corcoran contested and lost Sandringham."

Lax studied the Seven Liberal Arts and theology at the University of Saragossa, where he acquired a master's degree. He taught in 1507–1508 at the Collège de Calvi in Paris and then at the Collège de Montaigu, where he was a student of John Mair (or Major) and simultaneously was a teacher himself. From 1517 Lax was again at the Collège de Calvi. In Paris he was known as the \"Prince of Sophists\". He taught in Paris until 1523 and then returned to Spain because in that year all foreigners were requested to leave the Parisian universities. Starting in 1525 he taught mathematics and philosophy at the University of Saragossa and remained there until his death. In addition to his teaching, Lax was vice-chancellor and rector of the University of Saragossa."

  "text" : "Cr. George Tomas Gahan JP (21 July 1912 – 24 June 1980) was an Australian politician and Victorian amateur boxer. He was born in Inglewood, Victoria to Benjamin Edward Gahan and Emma Gahan née Walker. The Gahan family later moved to the Melbourne suburb of Prahran where George became a building contractor. At a young age George began training as an amateur boxer. In his mid 30's Gahan attempted to join the Australian Army and defend his country in World War II. Despite being rejected by army due to a duodenal ulcer, Gahan applied a second time, only be to turned away again. This tenacious streak proved to be a valuable attribute as George again turned his focus towards amateur boxing, winning a Yarraville boxing competition and in 1949 in the final of the Welter division was beaten by the Australian champion Bill Seewitz. George had his last fight at 42 years of age when he was stopped in the 2nd round by his opponent 20 years his junior. George's tenacity and fighting talent soon shifted from the boxing ring to the political arena, becoming known as Prahran's George the Giant Killer. From 1957 to 1959, George Gahan was the president of the Prahran-South Yarra branch of the Helping Hand League of Victoria; now known as Inclusion Melbourne."

  "text" : "Gerald Albert Asher (born 18 August 1932) is an English wine personality, based since 1974 in San Francisco, California. Initially a wine merchant and importer, today he is a wine writer. Born in London and raised partly in rural Essex because of the Blitz, Asher's career in wine began in 1950, when he took a part-time job at a wine retailer in London's Shepherd Market. He founded his own merchant house, Asher, Storey and Co, in 1955, to import rare and lesser-known French wines to Britain. Active until 1970, the firm was widely seen as ground-breaking for its introduction to the British market of several previously obscure wines that proceeded to become popular. In 1971, Asher relocated to New York to take up a senior position at Austin, Nichols and Co, which imported Bordeaux-classed wines to the United States. The next year he also became wine editor at Gourmet magazine, a post he would hold for the next three decades, writing the \"Wine Journal\" column, which eventually became monthly. In 1974, he received the Mérite agricole from the French government for his contributions to French agriculture. He moved the same year to San Francisco, where he became head of the Monterey Wine Company. He writes that he had \"a topsy-turvy introduction to California wine\", having never tasted any before a 1967 visit, but he soon began championing it, organising the annual California Vintners Barrel Tasting Dinner along with Paul Kovi and Tom Margittai of New York's Four Seasons Restaurant. The barrel tasting, which started in 1976, played an important role in building the image and understanding of California wines on the East Coast of the United States, and over the next decade became seen by critics as the wine event of the year. Asher started the Mosswood Wine Company in 1978, within the McKesson Corporation, and headed it until 1987, when McKesson sold off its interests in wine and spirits to concentrate on pharmaceuticals. Asher took early retirement to focus solely on his wine writing, which he continues today. He retained the post of wine editor at Gourmet until 2002, and thereafter contributed a selection of wines to each issue until the magazine discontinued in 2009. Many of his wine essays from Gourmet have been republished in book form; five volumes of these columns have been published, most recently A Carafé of Red in 2012. Asher's writing and knowledge of wine are both acclaimed, with British wine critic Jancis Robinson calling him \"America's most elegant wine writer\". James Beard, an American chef and food writer, says Asher's writing \"makes one feel that one is sitting in a room with Gerald, enjoying his ... awesome knowledge and expertise in the world of wine.\" Asher has received many accolades for his writing and work with wine during his life. He was inducted into the California Vintners' Hall of Fame by the Culinary Institute of America in 2009."

Soon afterwards, he was co-appointed with Valentin Magnan (1835–1916) to the Sainte-Anne asylum in Paris. In 1879 he succeeded Prosper Lucas (1805–1885) as superintendent of the women's division at Sainte-Anne. Bouchereau served in a field hospital during the Franco-Prussian War. He was wounded at the Battle of Châtillon, subsequently being awarded with the badge of the Legion of Honour for gallantry and devotion. In 1871 he became a member of the Société Médico-Psychologique of Paris, being elected its president in 1891. For many years he served as general secretary of the Association mutuelle des médecins aliénistes de France."

  "text" : "Gaetano Giulio Zumbo (1656–1701) was an Italian sculptor in wax or wax modeller of the Baroque era. His main talents are not those generally considered as an artistic, but would now be viewed as the creation of scientific models, but they were highly regarded as curiosity pieces in his time. He has also been called an anatomist. He was born in Siracusa, Italy, and showed an entirely self-taught inclination to sculptural arts and anatomy. Not familiar with chiseling, he learned to model colored wax, this led to his patronage by the Grand Duke of Tuscany in Florence for whom he created a series of five morbid models, almost a memento mori, depicting the progressive Corruption after death, beginning with a dying man, followed by a corpse, a corpse just starting to decompose, half corrupt, another completely corrupt, and finally eaten by worms. Once displayed in the Medici gallery, it was later transferred to the cabinet of natural history and zoological specimens (now displayed in the Section of the Natural History Museum called La Specola). Zumbo left Florence for Genoa. There he completed wax sculptures: a Nativity and a Deposition. He made a partnership with a French Surgeon called Desnoues, and with him completed a number of anatomic studies including a woman who died while in childbirth. With Denoues, he travelled to Paris, and there presented to the Academy of Sciences, a wax sculpture of the head with naturalistic depiction of veins, arteries, nerves, glands, and muscles. Similar work by Giuseppe Salerno is in the Sansevero Chapel in Naples, Italy. The central character of the novel Secrecy (2013) by Rupert Thomson, is based on Zumbo."

He lavishly extended Danny House in 1593, using funds collected in his capacity as Receiver of the Court of Wards, which were rightfully revenues of the Crown. The house is now a Grade I listed building. He married Mary, the daughter and coheiress of William Everard, and the widow of Richard Bellingham, with whom he had 2 sons and 2 daughters.

His firm held the Royal Warrant of appointment and photographed members of the British royal family and their guests at Osborne House, Queen Victoria’s holiday home on the island. Gustav Mullins was born in St Helier, Jersey, in 1854. His father, Henry, was a local photographic agent. In the 1880s, Gustav moved to the Isle of Wight, becoming first apprentice and then partner to Jabez Hughes at his studio at 60 Union Street, Ryde, where they traded as ‘Hughes and Mullins’. Mullins continued the business after Hughes’ death in 1884. In 1885, he was granted a Royal Warrant when the firm was named \"Photographers to Her Majesty at Ryde\". In this role, Mullins captured some of the most famous images of Queen Victoria, including formal portraits taken on the day of the Diamond Jubilee celebrations on 22 June 1897. He also photographed members of the royal family including Princess Beatrice on her wedding day  and the young Princess Patricia of Connaught. In 1883, Gustav married Fanny Hulse from Malling in Kent; they lived in Ryde with their daughter Dora. Gustav Mullins died on 27 December 1921 and was buried at Ryde Cemetery. Examples of Mullins’ photographs are today held in the Royal Collection at Windsor Castle, the National Portrait Gallery in London, and the National Archives in Kew."

He joined hajj pilgrims in 1928 and screened the resulting documentary in the Netherlands.

  "text" : "Garth Webb (1918 – 8 May 2012) was a Canadian soldier who founded the Juno Beach Centre. Webb fought in World War II as a member of the Canadian 14th Field Artillery. He has been awarded the Meritorious Service Cross and the Legion of Honour medal. Webb was born in Calgary, Alberta in 1918. He was educated at Queen's University, and graduated from the Canadian Officers' Training Corps in 1942. He was a lieutenant in the Canadian Army assigned to the 14th Field Artillery. He fought on D-Day at the Juno Beach landings where he came ashore at Bernières-sur-Mer with his self-propelled Priest artillery vehicle. After the war, Webb completed a degree in commerce at Queen's University and moved to Toronto where he was a real estate appraiser. Visiting the beaches of Normandy during the commemoration of the 50th anniversary of the Normandy Landings, Webb noticed that there was very little to mark the efforts of Canadian troops. This spurred him to lead an effort to build the Juno Beach Centre, a museum and education centre at Courseulles-sur-Mer, France. For his work to found the Juno Beach Centre, Webb was awarded the Meritorious Service Cross from Canada (2003) and the Legion of Honour medal from France (2005). Webb died on 8 May 2012 in Burlington, Ontario. Garth Webb Secondary School in Oakville, Ontario is named in his honour."

Gabriel was the fourth and youngest son of Ludovico II of Saluzzo and Margaret of Foix-Candale. Because it was unlikely that he would ever rule Saluzzo, he had been destined for a career in the church and became abbot of Staffarda Abbey. But when two of his brothers had died and with Giovanni Ludovico in exile, he was recalled to rule the Marquisate of Saluzzo in 1537. This couldn't have been at a worse time. The marquisate had been a battleground during the Italian Wars and a succession war between the pro-Habsburg Giovanni Ludovico and the pro-French Francesco. This left the marquisate utterly ruined and completely dependent on the King of France. Gabriel couldn't turn the tide and was deposed by an uprising on 23 February 1548. Representatives of the Saluzzo municipalities gathered to discuss the future of the nation and decided to request the annexation to France. In 1549, King Henry II of France formally annexed Saluzzo to France. By then, Gabriel had already died."

  "text" : "Gordon Stokes Kurtti (May 4, 1960 - April 18, 1987) was an American artist, writer, illustrator and performer. He was a seminal figure in the early East Village art scene of New York City's Lower East Side. Kurtti’s prolific output – his crossing of visual art with literature, performance, and cinema – along with his connection to and activity within the nightclub milieu of the post punk \"downtown\" culture of New York City in the 1980s, when high culture merged with entertainment – is illustrative of the period before AIDS decimated an entire generation. In many opinions, such as that of writer Sarah Schulman, the loss of such potential arbiters as Kurtti changed the course of world culture forever. Kurtti was a member of Allied Productions, a not-for-profit arts organization based in New York City. With Allied's collective umbrella as a resource and guide for social and aesthetic experimentation, he collaborated on performances, films and Arts in education workshops. Though his life was brief his output was relatively prolific - like many figures in this history of the fervent, feverish climate of New York City's Lower East Side in the '80s. He exhibited at ABC No Rio, Club Armageddon, Pyramid Club, 8BC and Life Café – the East Village hangout featured in Rent."

  "text" : "Gnaeus Octavius was consul of the Roman Republic in 76 BC. His father Marcus Octavius was possibly either the Marcus who was the tribunus plebis in 133 BC, political opponent of Tiberius Gracchus, or the Marcus who was also tribunus plebis and brought forward a law raising the price at which corn was sold to the people. A member of the Plebeian gens Octavia, Gnaeus Octavius was elected Praetor by 79 BC at the latest. He may have been the praetor urbanus who introduced the Formula Octaviana, a law which provided for the restoration of property and money which had been obtained by violent acts, or by threats of violence. Gnaeus Octavius was elected consul for 76 BC, with Gaius Scribonius Curio as his colleague. Scorned as an orator, he was also plagued with attacks of gout, which eventually made it impossible for him to walk."

Duthie began working on his debut album Shire and City in 2008 whilst studying towards an MSc in International Marketing Management at The Robert Gordon University in Aberdeen. Duthie wrote a thesis and dissertation on the topic of music distribution during this period. Duthie first came to public attention in December 2011 when his music video for Hide appeared on his YouTube channel. The video was inspired by Duthie's upbringing in Aberdeenshire and he also wanted to raise the profile of the landmarks featured. Duthie released his debut album Shire and City in June 2012 which was met with favourable reviews, for example, New Reviews praised Duthie's talent, dedication and artistry concluding: \"The variations across Shire and City do well to display Duthie’s phenomenal talent and the listener can’t help but appreciate his dedication and hard work. Anybody who loves music should check this album out straight away, from this fantastic and genuinely creative musician, something that sadly is sometimes lost in the money grabbing, image obsessed music industry today.\" During the production of Shire and City Duthie commissioned an artwork piece which explored the urban myth that Bram Stoker used Slains Castle in Cruden Bay as an inspiration for Dracula (novel)."

He was a son of Roger-Bernard III, Count of Foix and Margaret of Montcada, the eldest daughter and heiress of Gaston VII of Béarn. He succeeded his father in 1302 as Count Gaston I of Foix and Viscount Gaston VIII of Béarn, first under the regency of his mother. He was probably present at the Battle of the Golden Spurs in 1302, and fought again for the King of France against the Flemish at the Battle of Mons-en-Pévèle in 1304.When the cities of his County of Foix rebelled against the Royal tax collectors, because they raised the taxes to finance the expensive war against Flanders, Gaston supported his cities. For this, the County was confiscated for a while by the Senechal of Carcassonne. In 1308, he started a war against the Count of Armagnac, against the orders of the King, who had forbidden intra-French warfare. Gaston was taken prisoner and locked up in the Châtelet. He was only released after paying a ransom of 36,000 pond. He also had armed conflicts with his uncle James II of Majorca and even with his own mother, who firmly ruled Foix during his many absences. In 1310, he inherited the Viscounty of Marsan from his aunt Constance of Moncada.When another uncle, Ermengol X, Count of Urgell, died without a male heir, Gaston claimed the County of Urgell, but was no match against King Alfonso IV of Aragon, who incorporated Urgell into the Crown of Aragon. On his return from yet an other war against Flanders, Gaston fell ill and died in the Maubuisson Abbey, near Pontoise.His body was transferred to the Boulbonne Abbey, where it was buried alongside his ancestors. Some records state he was buried in the now-demolished church of the Couvent des Jacobins in Paris."

He was also a contributor to the exsiccatae series Algues de France.

  "text" : "Gustav Adolf Neuber (24 June 1850 – 13 April 1932) was a German surgeon born in Tondern (today- Tønder, Denmark). He studied medicine in several universities, receiving his doctorate in 1875 at the University of Giessen. Later he worked as an assistant to Friedrich von Esmarch (1823-1908) at the University Surgical Clinic in Kiel. In 1884 he first proposed the use of separate operating rooms for septic and non-septic surgery, emphasizing the need for complete cleanliness in all aspects of surgery. In 1886 he opened his own private hospital on Königsweg in Kiel, where he implemented modern principles of asepsis. Neuber's clinic in Kiel is considered to be the first aseptic hospital in the world. In 1879 he developed a \"decalcified bone tube\" for wound drainage. In the field of plastic surgery, he introduced a procedure for \"fat auto-grafting\"."

His monastic formation was directly influenced by Bernard of Clairvaux, who praises him in several letters. In 1138, he became abbot of Igny Abbey, in the diocese of Rheims, a house dependent on Clairvaux. Here Guerric ruled as abbot until his death on 19 August 1157. It was here that he composed the 54 liturgical sermons that consistute his surviving works. His spirituality was said to be influenced by Origen. Guerric was raised to the rank of Blessed; his relics are still venerated in Igny."

  "text" : "Georges Camille Doeuillet was born 16 July 1865 in Oise, Northern France. Doeuillet became one of France's best known Couturiers along with his peers Louise Chéruit, Jeanne Paquin, Paul Poiret, Redfern & Sons and the House of Charles Worth. In 1911 he was made an Officer of the Legion of Honour in recognition of his contribution to fashion. Georges Doeuillet was President of the Chambre Syndicale de la Haute Couture until 1915. He was known for his refined and elegant design style. Early in his career Georges Doeuillet was business manager at the fashion house of Callot Soeurs. Doeuillet was ardent in business. At Callot Soeurs he was responsible for discovering Madeleine Vionnet who undertook an apprenticeship at the house prior to establishing her own fashion house Vionnet. In 1900 Georges Doeuillet opened his maison at 18 Place Vendôme in Paris, France. Doeuillet, his fashion house was considered one of the most influential houses in France. He was the first designer to locate his maison in the Place Vendôme before other fashion houses followed him to this location. In 1914, he moved his maison to a larger location at 24 Place Vendôme. Doeuillet designed the dresses for the first performance at the Théâtre Mogador when it opened in 1913. At the performance he showed the world's first robes de style (Cocktail Dress) that influenced a generation of fashion designers who incorporated such styles into their collections. In 1914, in reference to his influential introduction of the cocktail dress he was quoted by Vogue as saying, \"[these] styles are much younger and prettier. In fact, I think we now have the most beautiful style that has been evolved in modern times. It is so good that we can't change it. The women who wear fine clothes insist upon keeping essentially the same silhouette and they are quite right.\" The French Government supported the couture \"old masters\" including Doeuillet during World War I. They sent dresses from their prestigious designers to demonstrate French fashion at the Panama Pacific International Exposition of 1915. Dresses designed by Georges Doeuillet can be found at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City and the Musée des Arts Décoratifs at the Louvre in Paris."

In doing so he has used, besides traditional ones, several poetic forms including blank verse, free verse, sonnets, quatrains, metric poems and lyrics. He has also translated dozens of English poems of outstanding English poets into Kashmiri. As a result of all this, he has enriched the expression of the language and made it more suitable for communicating his sensibility which in nature is modern. Besides, he has been writing essays and articles in Kashmiri language, which is his mother tongue, and which he has made the vehicle of expression from early fifties. As a literary critic and historian he has been trying to evaluate the Kashmiri poetry of the last five hundred years and rehabilitate it by bringing to prominence among other things its intrinsic merit and power of expression. He also holds the Sahitya Akademi Award for his works in Kashmiri literature. He is regarded as one of the very few people of Kashmir who has been trying to preserve the rich Kashmiri culture, heritage and language. As an educationist he has tried his best to reach all sections of society to help them in uplifting their educational standards. He is co-founder of Standard Public High School (a group of Educational Institutions), established in 1975."

He is the heir to the Sitwell baronetcy as the nephew of Sir Reresby Sitwell, but as of February 2016 has not proved his succession to the title. Sitwell is the elder son of Susanna Cross and Francis Trajan Sacheverell Sitwell of Weston Hall, Northamptonshire. He married Martha Sitwell (née de Blank), daughter of restaurateur Justin de Blank, but they separated in 2012. He was educated at Eton College and the University of Edinburgh. Sitwell has worked as an investment banker, head of finance for a film production company, and co-founded an IT staffing group before turning to property development. He developed Joia das Dunas, a luxury beach resort in Portugal which includes a hotel and eco-homes, and is a partner in the company Elements Club, whose focus is resort developments in Brazil. Due to his father and uncle, Sir Reresby Sitwell, being \"never in harmony\" Sir Reresby bequeathed the Sitwell family seat, Renishaw Hall, Derbyshire, to his daughter Alexandra, Mrs Rick Hayward. Consequently the famous house and estate are presently separated from the Renishaw baronetcy for the first time in the family's history; George living at the other Sitwell residence, Weston Hall."

Johnson said 'Guo stressed that from a Marxist–Leninist perspective the notion of \"not fighting and subduing the enemy\"'—the core of the conventional interpretation of Sun Zi—was un-Marxist, since class enemies could not be credibly defeated without the application of violence.' Around June 4, 1937, Guo was the dean of studies of Qingyang Infantry School."

  "text" : "Girard de Beaulieu, better known by the incorrectly recorded name Lambert de Beaulieu (? – after 1587) was a French bass singer and composer. He was employed at the court of Henri III as basse singer and composer from 1559. He was associated with the Académie de Baïf, one of whose aristocratic poets, Nicolas Filleul de La Chesnaye, the king's almoner, was to provide the lyrics for the ballet Circé in the first French opera-ballet, the Balet Comique de la Royne of 1581, to which Beaulieu and Jacques Salmon provided the music. Choreography and overall direction were provided by the Italian dancing master Baltazarini, known as Balthasar de Beaujoyeulx. Sets and costumes were provided by Jacques Patin. Beaulieu's wife was the Genoese soprano and luthenist Violante Doria. They had a daughter Claude de Beaulieu who later was paid as a luthenist at the court. The original documents of 1581 indicate the composer only as \"Sieur de Beaulieu\". The error concerning his name, and consequent separation of the bass singer and composer into two biographies, is due to an erroneous \"Lambert de Beaulieu\" in a letter by Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor to the French king attempting to employ the composer Beaulieu for his own court. The error in Rudolf's letter was reproduced by François-Joseph Fétis in his influential Biographie universelle des musiciens."

  "text" : "George Augustus Boardman (5 February 1818 – 11 January 1901) was an American-born lumber merchant and ornithologist in the New Brunswick area of Canada. Boardman was born in 1818 at Newburyport, Massachusetts. In 1828 he moved to Calais, Maine with his family, where he lived until his marriage in 1843. He then took up residence in St. Stephen, New Brunswick where he was buried. He owned a lumber business for more than 30 years, after which he retired in 1871. As a beginner in the ornithological field, he met with many famous naturalists and became friends with Spencer F. Baird, from the Smithsonian Institution. He spend his winters in Florida after he retired from his job, during which time he collected specimens of many kinds most of which were donated to the United States National Museum. He died in 1901. His contributions to ornithological literature were About the Islands at the Mouth of the Bay of Fundy and Catalogue of the Birds Found in the Vicinity of Calais that were published in Maine, both of which appeared in the proceedings of Boston Society of Natural History in 1862. Boardman is important to history for his study of bird life in southwestern New Brunswick and the lower Bay of Fundy. He was described by another ornithologist from the area as “the most outstanding naturalist, bird student and collector ever produced by northeastern Maine or the Maritime Provinces of Canada.”"

In 1980 the first four-manual organ for the Church of St. Joseph in Memmingen was completed with 52 registers. Later, the workshop was relocated to south of Allkofen near Regensburg in Bavaria. Until 1995, Georg Jann ran his company under the name \"Georg Jann Orgelbau Meisterbetrieb\". He then handed the company to his son Thomas, who moved the workshop to Portugal.

  "text" : "Giovanni Battista Caviglia (1770 in Genoa – September 7, 1845 in Paris) was an explorer, navigator and Italian Egyptologist. He was one of the pioneers of Egyptian archeology of his time. He was influential in the excavation of the Sphinx of Giza near Cairo. He was born in Genoa in 1770 at a time when the city was the capital of the Republic of Genoa. He spent most of his life sailing in the Mediterranean in which he became a merchant captain. When he decided to start his career as an explorer left his ship moored in Alexandria, and offered his services to various collectors, and most of his excavations were carried out on behalf of the Consul General British Henry Salt. Between the 1816 and 1817 explored the pyramid of Cheops where he made important discoveries, including the descending corridor, the bottom of the well service and unfinished underground room. In 1817 Salt hired him to dig up the sphinx Cairo, which over the centuries had been almost totally covered by the sands of the desert. The last dig around the sphinx had been performed in the year 160 AD by order of the Roman Emperor Marcus Aurelius. As the excavations continued with Caviglia, he came upon an array of Egyptian artifacts and inscriptions in Greek and Latin. In 1819, he had to suspend his research. Following the exploration during the excavations carried out in 1820 on behalf of the British in the ancient capital Memphis, which is located about 20 km south of Cairo, he made a 'sensational other discovery: the Colossus of Ramses II. This was a 'huge statue limestone who found near the south gate of the Temple of Ptah, near the village of Mit Rahina. Despite being free of foot measuring over 10 meters. The offered through the Egyptologist Ippolito Rosellini, the Grand Duke Leopold II of Tuscany who refused to difficulties and any transportation costs. Following this, the pasha of Egypt 'Mehmet Ali gave it to British Museum in London, which in turn declined the' offer for the same reasons. It was then built on the place a museum where you can still find it. In 1835, when he was already 65 years, Egyptologists British Richard William Howard Vyse and John Shae Perring hired him as an assistant for their excavations at Giza. The research was carried out using large quantities of dynamite and took place in the pyramids of Khufu and Menkaure. The collaboration lasted a couple of years' after which Vyse, contrary to the methods Ankle, fired him. He spent the last years of his life in Paris, where he died on 7th September 1845."

  "text" : "Gino Benedetto Loria (19 May 1862, Mantua – 30 January 1954, Genoa) was an Italian mathematician and historian of mathematics. Loria studied mathematics in Mantua, Turin, and Pavia and received his doctorate in 1883 from the University of Turin under the direction of Enrico D'Ovidio. For several years he was D'Ovidio's assistant in Turin. Starting in 1886 he became, as a result of winning a then-customary competition, Professor for Algebra and Analytic Geometry in Genoa, where he stayed for the remainder of his career. Loria did research on projective geometry, special curves and rational transformations in algebraic geometry, and elliptic functions. In 1897 he became editor of Bolletino di Bibliografia e Storia delle Science Matematiche. In 1916 he published a guide to the study of history of mathematics. A reviewer noted The amount of information given is really remarkable, and it is well up to date; the author, too, has not shrunk from the disagreeable duty of pointing out works ... which must be used with caution. Loria wrote a history of mathematics and was especially concerned with the history of mathematics in Italy and among the ancient Greeks. During the German control of Italy in WWII, Waldensians helped Loria (endangered as a Jew) hide in Torre Pellice.Loria was elected to the Accademia dei Lincei and the Turin Academy of Sciences. An asteroid (27056 Ginoloria) is named after him."

  "text" : "George Greenamyer (born 1939, Cleveland, Ohio, US) is an American sculptor. He received a BFA in 1963 from the Philadelphia College of Art and an MFA in 1969 from the University of Kansas. He was a professor at the Massachusetts College of Art for more than thirty years. From 1988 to 1991, Greenamyer staged an annual event at Laumeier Sculpture Park in St. Louis, Missouri called \"Fire and Ice\", in which he fashioned a massive ice sculpture that was then set ablaze over a bonfire. The event suffered several weather-related problems, however. In its first two years, unexpectedly cold weather kept the sculptures from melting properly for the crowd; in 1990 and 1991, unexpectedly warm weather caused the sculptures to melt before the actual event. Laumeier Sculpture Park later commissioned a piece from Greenamyer in memory of its Marketing Director, Debra Lakin: Heritage Schooner for Debra Lakin, September 30, 1998. His sculpture Milwaukee was installed outside the University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee's Golda Meir Library in 1989. It depicts agricultural and urban scenes from Milwaukee's history. In 1991, University of Oregon athletic director Bill Byrne ordered a worker to cut down and remove a newly installed Greenamyer sculpture with a blowtorch. Byrne stated that he had found it \"not in character with the rest of the front of the building\". Greenamyer himself came to the scene, threatening to chain himself to the $54,000 sculpture to prevent its destruction. After mediation by UO president Myles Brand, it was agreed that the damage already done to the sculpture would be repaired, and it would be reinstalled on another location on campus."

  "text" : "Gerard Edward \"Gerry\" Sandusky (born September 5, 1961) is an American sports broadcaster. He works as the sports director at WBAL-TV in Baltimore, Maryland, and does radio play-by-play for the Baltimore Ravens of the National Football League. Sandusky is the son of John Sandusky, who played in the NFL for the Cleveland Browns and Green Bay Packers, and who later was an assistant coach for several NFL teams, and head coach for the Baltimore Colts. He is a 1983 graduate of Towson University, where he played football and basketball. Sandusky began his career as a sportscaster for WSVN-TV in Miami, Florida. He joined WBAL-TV in 1988. In addition to his duties with the Ravens, Sandusky broadcasts Towson University basketball games. Previously, he hosted the pre-game show for Baltimore Orioles broadcasts. Sandusky is also the owner of The Sandusky Group, a media and communications consulting firm. He and his wife Lee Ann founded the Joe Sandusky Fund, which operates through the Baltimore Community Foundation and raises money for scholarships to financially needy youngsters in the Baltimore area. The fund is named after Sandusky's late brother, a football player at the University of Tulsa, who died of septic shock caused by pneumonia in 1978 at the age of 19. One of his catchphrases is \"The hay is in the barn\", said when the Ravens lock up a win. In 2014, Gerry Sandusky authored his first book, “Forgotten Sundays: A Son’s Story of Love, Loss and Life from the Sidelines of the NFL. With a foreword by Baltimore Ravens Head Coach John Harbaugh, Forgotten Sundays is Gerry Sandusky’s coming-of-age story about a son’s relationship with his father. It is his story of love, loss, acceptance and living in the shadow of the NFL. On May 24, 2014, Sandusky introduced the book at a public book signing event at Greetings & Readings of Hunt Valley in Baltimore County. He is not related to former Penn State assistant football coach Jerry Sandusky."

  "text" : "Katherine Githa Sowerby (6 October 1876 – 30 June 1970), also known under her penname K. G. Sowerby, was an English playwright, children's writer, and member of the Fabian Society. A feminist, she was well-known during the early twentieth century for her 1912 hit play Rutherford & Son, but lapsed into obscurity in later decades. Rutherford & Son was first revived in 1980, and since then there have been several productions, including one at the Royal National Theatre in 1994 and, most recently, by Northern Broadsides. A biography of Sowerby by Pat Riley, Looking for Githa, appeared in 2009. In addition to several plays, Sowerby wrote books of poetry and short stories for children, illustrated by her sister Millicent Sowerby. Her papers and memorabilia are in the collections at the Tyne and Wear Archives and Museums."

  "text" : "(\"Glen Ewin\" redirects here. For the village in Saskatchewan, Canada, see Glen Ewen.) George McEwin (29 January 1815 – 8 August 1885) was a gardener and orchardist in the early days of South Australia remembered today as the founder of Glen Ewin jams and preserves. McEwin was born in Scotland, and worked in the gardens of the Duke of Buccleugh at Drumlanrig Castle in Scotland, then in the Liverpool nurseries of M. Skirving. He married Jessie Kennedy (12 July 1810 – 21 September 1884) in Liverpool in 1839. They emigrated to South Australia on the Delhi, arriving in Adelaide on 20 December 1840. He worked as head gardener for George Stevenson, and planted what may have been South Australia's first vines at North Adelaide in 1837. Stevenson was private secretary to Governor Hindmarsh, arriving on HMS Buffalo at Holdfast Bay on 28 December 1836. He visited Sydney and collected a large number of fruit trees and vines, which he planted on Stevenson's extensive property between Melbourne and Finniss streets, and which thrived under his care. He planted a small plot with wheat; arguably the first in South Australia, though Charles George Everard and Donald McLean are at least as plausible. In 1843 he purchased land near Houghton which he named \"Glen Ewin\", where he planted extensive orchards and settled in 1844. He worked for George A. Anstey (1815–1895, for whom Ansteys Hill is named) establishing the garden and orchards of his Highercombe Estate, now part of Tea Tree Gully. From 1850 he and apple grower William Dunn worked for Anstey setting up the orchard and gardens for his nearby Paracombe Estate. Around 1863 founded a jam factory, which he operated with his son Robert McEwin, to make use of excess fruit. At the height of their business they employed over 100 people and purchased much of the fruit in the region. Besides the Glen Ewin brand, their jam was also marketed as Kingurli, Viking, Anchor, Arab and Far West. In December 1962 Sir Thomas Playford unveiled a plaque commemorating 100 years of jam making at Glen Ewin. The business failed in the late 1980s; the factory closed in 1988, and the property deteriorated considerably. The Glen Ewin name was revived in the 1990s for a range of jams made by Henry Jones IXL, which was bought by SPC Ardmona in 2004 but none of these products was made at Houghton. In 1991 the Wauchope family bought the property and began resurrecting Glen Ewin as a fig orchard in 1994. Their company Willabrand now supplies fresh figs locally, interstate and overseas."

  "text" : "Gunnerius Furuholmen (12 January 1861 – 23 August 1947) was a Norwegian engineer and politician for the Conservative Party. He was born at Furuholmen in Varteig as a son of timber rafting inspector and politician Richard Christensen Furuholmen (1840–1899) and Oleane Røstad (1835–1913). He was an uncle of engineer Thor Furuholmen. He graduated as an engineer from Trondhjem Technical School in 1881. From 1885 he was a floating inspector at Furuholmen, later at Hvidsten. He worked together with his father, and together they managed to improve floating conditions in Nedre Glommen region. From 1909 he worked at the timber floating office in Fredrikstad. Furuholmen was an elected municipal council member in Varteig and later Tune, most notably serving as mayor of Varteig from 1898 to 1899. He was also a board member of the local savings bank. In the Norwegian parliamentary election, 1909 he was fielded as the Conservative Party deputy candidate; as running mate of Knut Edvart Jahren in the single-member constituency Tune. In the first round of voting, Jahren and Furuholmen lost to Labour candidate Albert Theodor Alexius Moeskau with 884 against 1,045 votes—but came ahead of three other candidates. In the subsequent run-off vote, the Church Party coupled with the Conservatives to field Furuholmen as candidate with Jahren as deputy. Furuholmen received 2,477 votes, edging out Moeskau's 1,494 votes. Furuholmen served one term in the Parliament of Norway as a member of the Standing Committee on Church Affairs. In 1912, Furuholmen received re-nomination and was backed by the Liberal Left Party in addition. However, he lost to Moeskau in both the first and second round, and his parliamentary career was over. He died in 1947 and was buried in Varteig."

  "text" : "Giovanni Francesco (Giovanfrancesco) Lottini (1512 - August 1572 ) was an Italian politician and writer. Lottini was born in Volterra in 1512. In 1530 he was accused of having seriously injured a fellow resident of Volterra and put on trial. He was secretary of Cosimo I, but in 1542 officially was removed by the same Cosimo I for acts of sodomy, but remained in his service for shady dealings. In February 1548 Cosimo I sent him to Venice, but it was he who prepared the plot against Lorenzino de' Medici, who oddly enough, the very same month, was hit by two killers from Volterra. Away again from Florence, Lottini moved to Rome where he became secretary of the Cardinal of Santa Fiora. On January 31, 1550 during a conclave, Cardinal Niccolò Ridolfi was poisoned and many blamed Lottini. In 1552 he obtained from Pope Marcellus II an appointment as canon of Abbey Hill of Piedmont. In 1555 he entered the papal court, opposing the election of Pope Paul IV, who suffered much. On August 10 he was shut up in the Castel Sant'Angelo. In 1559 he was at the service of Giovanni Angelo de'Medici as a secretary, who became Pope Pius IV and appointed Lottini Bishop of Conversano in 1560. Lottini however, refused the assignment, instead taking up his wandering life. Before his death (in Rome, in August 1572) Lottini gave his brother a treatise of considerations and personal notes on different themes, from the military to the care of physical life. The manuscript entitled Avvedimenti Civili was given by his brother to Girolamo, the brother of Francesco I de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany, in 1574."

  "text" : "George Scott (unknown - 1767) was British army officer stationed in Acadia who fought in Father Le Loutre's War and the French and Indian War. He first served 40th Regiment of Foot since 1746 and then became captain in 1751. In 1753 he took command of Fort Lawrence. He made contact with the spy Thomas Pichon. Scott relinquished command of Fort Lawrence in the autumn of 1754. Preparations were then being made for an attack on Beauséjour, and he was appointed to command one of the two battalions of Shirley's Massachusetts troops (John Winslow was appointed to the other). He played a considerable part in the brief siege. When Monckton departed Beausejour in November Scott was left in command in the Chignecto area. The commander of the light troops was Major George Scott, an officer of Major General Peregrine Thomas Hopson's 40th Regiment of Foot, who was familiar with irregular tactics. Orders issued on 12 May 1758, stated that \"the rangers, and light infantry, appointed to act as rangers, are to be commanded by Major Scott.\" He was to serve with distinction both during the Siege of Louisbourg (1758) and later with Major General James Wolfe at Battle of the Plains of Abraham. He also was employed in the Petitcodiac River Campaign and the St. John River Campaign against the Acadians. Scott was given the rank of major in the army effective 28 December 1758. He remained on the list of the 40th Foot as a captain, and evidently was an absentee company commander in the regiment until his death. Monckton appointed Scott Governor of Grenada. Scott made his will there in December 1764, just before leaving to become acting Governor of Dominica. Scott created a will and left notice that he would be in a duel the following day. Scott was killed or mortally wounded in a duel on 6 November 1767. He left in his will property to his wife Abigail and his father, three brothers (one of whom, Joseph Scott, lived in Halifax at Scott Manor House beside Fort Sackville) and three sisters. A purported miniature of Scott is reproduced in Webster’s Thomas Pichon; it portrays a sharp and rather unpleasant face."

  "text" : "George Armytage (1795–1862) was a farmer and pastoralist, builder of The Hermitage in Geelong, Victoria (Australia). Armytage was born at Ticknall, Derbyshire, England in 1795, and was educated at schools in Yorkshire. He was the son of George Armytage (senior), who died in Australia in 1853, having emigrated at the age of eighty-seven. Armytage junior subsequently studied engineering in London until his twentieth year, when, on 28 February 1815, he sailed for Australia in the Hebe. Armytage reached Sydney in August 1815. In the following year he landed in Van Diemen's Land (now Tasmania), where he was allotted a few acres of land at Bagdad, which were increased to 500 acres in 1817. In 1826 he received a further grant of 1,000 acres (400 ha), built upon it the first watermill in Tasmania, and, in spite of troubles with Indigenous Australians and bushrangers, became successful. In 1835 Port Phillip District (later called Victoria) commenced to attract settlers; and in 1836 his eldest son Thomas visited the district, and camped on the Werribee River. In 1847 Mr. Armytage proceeded to Victoria, and settled upon his son George Armytage's station at Ingleby, where his eldest son had died of typhus fever on 12 September 1842. In 1851 he settled at Geelong, and built \"The Hermitage.\" In 1818 he married Miss Elizabeth Peters. He died of erysipelas in 1862, his widow surviving him until 1873."

  "text" : "George Edwin Taylor (August 4, 1857 – December 23, 1925) was a Black American who was the candidate of the National Negro Liberty Party for the office of President of the United States in 1904. Taylor was born in Little Rock, Arkansas to Amanda Hines and Nathan Taylor (a slave). When the State of Arkansas passed the Free Negro Expulsion Act in 1859, Hines took infant George to Alton, Illinois. Hines died of Tuberculosis in 1861 or 1862. In 1865, at age 8, orphaned George arrived in La Crosse, Wisconsin where he attended school and obtained early experiences as a journalist and labor/political activist. In 1891 Taylor left Wisconsin for Oskaloosa, Iowa where he published a weekly newspaper, the Negro Solicitor. In the 1890s, Taylor transitioned from Independent Republican to Democrat. In 1892, he was founder and president of the National Colored Men’s Protection League and in 1900 was president of the National Negro Democratic League, the Negro Bureau within the National Democratic Party. In 1904, Taylor joined the National Negro Liberty Party as its candidate for the office of president of the United States. He reconnected with the Democratic Party after the failure of his 1904 election campaign. Taylor married three times: Mary Hall of Prairie du Chien, Wisconsin; Cora Cooper Buckner of Oskaloosa, Iowa; and Marion Tillinghast of Green Cove Springs, Florida. He owned/edited two newspapers (Wisconsin Labor Advocate of La Crosse, Wisconsin and Negro Solicitor of Oskaloosa and Ottumwa, Iowa) and was editor of the Black Star edition of Florida Times-Union of Jacksonville, Florida, the largest newspaper in Florida at the beginning of the twentieth century. Taylor was a Mason, a community organizer, and a supporter of Free Silver and Anti-Imperialism. He was a popular and humorous speaker. He died in Jacksonville, Florida. The only known biography of Taylor is For Labor, Race, and Liberty: George Edwin Taylor, his historic run for the White House, and the making of Independent Black Politics, by Bruce L. Mouser (Madison: University of Wisconsin Press, 2012)."

After returning to Lucca in 1739, he served as organist in the cathedral and later Maestro di Cappella to the Most Serene Republic. Puccini belonged to the Accademia Filarmonica of Bologna and was a skilled teacher. His musical style incorporated elements of both the Baroque and early Classic periods. Puccini was known as an excellent organist. He wrote many dramatic and sacred works, including a Te Deum for four voices and instruments, a Domine for four voices, masses, and psalm settings. Between 1733 and 1780, Puccini wrote 31 servizi ecclesiastici for the annual Feast of the Exaltation of the Holy Cross (Festa della Esaltazione della Santa Croce). Some of Puccini's works, including a processional motet in eight voices, continued to be performed into at least the early 19th Century. A Requiem for eight voices by Puccini was performed at the Vienna Musical Exposition of 1892, together with music by his son Antonio, grandson Domenico, and great-grandson Michele."

His model of attachment is universal in both its application (adults as well as children) and implementation (school as well as home). Neufeld also is the founder of the Neufeld Institute based in Vancouver, Canada.

  "text" : "George Henry Firth Scott, (c1862-1935), journalist and writer, generally known as G. Firth Scott, was the son of George Firth Scott, Land Commissioner and Emma Elizabeth (née Barnes). He was born about 1862 at Golspie, County Sutherland, Scotland. He came to Australia and worked as a journalist for newspapers, including the The Hobart Mercury and the Sydney Daily Telegraph and also contributed stories to magazines including Belgravia. On 4 October 1889 he married Ailleen Murphy at St. Stephen's Cathedral, Brisbane. Ailleen was the eldest daughter of John and Hannah (née Smith) Murphy. John Murphy who died in 1883, was police-magistrate at Roma, Queensland and had, on a number of occasions, been Mayor of Ipswich, Queensland. Ailleen Scott gave birth to two children in Australia after which the Scotts went to Great Britain and settled there permanently, where Aillen gave birth to four more children. Following Aileen's death in 1919, in Surrey, England, George married Miss Gladys Tatham in London on 20 February 1920. George Firth Scott died on 3 January 1935 at Surrey, England. He was survived by his second wife, Gladys. Scott is best known for his novel The Last Lemurian: A Westralian Romance (1898), however he wrote many other novels and non-fiction works including the fiction titles, The Track of Midnight (1897), At Friendly Point (1898), Colonial Born: A Tale of the Queensland Bush (1900), The Twillford Mystery (1903), Possessed (1911), and The Rider of Waroona (1912). His non-fiction titles include The Romance of Australian Exploring (1899), From Franklin to Nansen: Tales of Arctic Adventure (1899), Britain's Austral Empire: Portraits of Statesmen (1901), The Romance of Polar Exploration (1906), Daring Deeds of Polar Explorers (1921), and The Reeling World (1931). The Last Lemurian has been described as a \"lost race romance\" and has been compared with other works by Australian novelists including Ernest Favenc's The Secret of the Australian Desert (1896) and John David Hennessey's An Australian Bush Track (1896). The Last Lemurian includes pygmies, a bunyip-monster, a phosphorescent Yellow Queen (who has lived for thousands of years) and reincarnation. In the novel, the remains of the fabled  Lemuria were discovered somewhere in the Australian desert."

  "text" : "Gaston Hamelin (27 May 1884 – 8 September 1951) was a French clarinetist and teacher. Born in Saint-Georges-sur-Baulche, Hamelin won the first prize for clarinet at the Paris Conservatory in 1904 under professor Charles Turban. He was a noted soloist, becoming the first to perform the Première rhapsodie for clarinet by Claude Debussy in 1919; he is also believed to be the first to record that work. Hamelin moved to the United States in 1926 to assume the seat of principal clarinetist for the Boston Symphony Orchestra. He performed with that group from 1926 to 1932, but was reportedly not offered a contract renewal because conductor Serge Koussevitzky disapproved of his practice of playing on a metal Selmer instrument instead of one made of the more traditional grenadilla wood. One anecdote about his dismissal records that he responded to praise on his performance in a rehearsal by waving his instrument in the air, which \"enraged\" Koussevitzky. In the early 1930s Hamelin returned to France, where he was active as a soloist and private teacher. He published his Scale and Exercise Book in Paris. His pedagogical approach was notable for advocating a double-lip embouchure, which was less common than the single-lip variety but was credited with reduced biting and increased fluidity of tone. His students included Rosario Mazzeo, Joseph Allard and Ralph McLane. He is known as a founder of the \"American\" school of clarinet and is credited with having a significant influence on the development of performance practice in the United States. His son Armand Hamelin, born 1907, played bass clarinet in the Boston Symphony for the last two years of his father's tenure there."

Born in Paris on 31 March 1884, Grisez studied with Arthur Grisez and later at the Paris Conservatory, winning first prize in clarinet in 1902, before moving to the United States in October 1904. He served as principal clarinetist for the Boston Symphony Orchestra from 1904 to 1914 (the seventh principal of that group), and for the Philadelphia Orchestra for the 1922–23 season. He made several recordings on the Phono-Cut Label in 1913. He reportedly played flute in the New York Symphony. He also played with the New York Chamber Music Society, New York Philharmonic, the Letz Quartet, the Grisez Woodwind Quintet, and the Georges Longy Club (based on a similar Parisian wind ensemble organized by Paul Taffanel). He performed the Brahms Clarinet Quintet with the Letz Quartet in the 1921 Maverick Concerts. He may have served as a musician in the French army during the First World War. He moved to Minnesota in 1923 to perform with the Minneapolis Symphony Orchestra and later teach at the University of Minnesota. He was one of the first clarinetists to play with the NBC Symphony, alongside principal Alexander Williams. In the last years of his life, Grisez joined the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra as principal. He died during a 1946 Baltimore concert, shortly after performing the clarinet glissando at the beginning of George Gershwin's Rhapsody in Blue. His successor as principal, Ricardo Morales, noted that the piece is \"one of the scariest to play\" for the first clarinetist."

In 1292, he named also as castellan of Kalamata. In that year, following a series of destructive raids in the Greek and Latin-held islands of the Aegean Sea, the Aragonese admiral Roger of Lauria led his fleet to anchor at Navarino. Fearful lest the Aragonese seize possession of lands in Achaea, or repeat their plundering raids, and with Prince Florent of Hainaut absent in Italy, George assembled two hundred knights at Androusa and attacked the Aragonese. In a brief but bloody combat, the Achaeans were defeated and George captured, only to be ransomed for 8,000 hyperpyra shortly after when the Aragonese fleet sailed to Glarentsa. In 1303, when his father died, he inherited the lordship of the Aegean islands of Tinos, Mykonos, with fiefs on Serifos and Keos. Through his second wife, Alice dalle Carceri, he also became baron (\"triarch\") of Negroponte (Euboea). He was killed in the Battle of the Cephissus against the Catalan Company in 1311. His wife Alice died in 1313."

He was best known for the role of Blue Cat in 3000 Whys of Blue Cat., an animation series known to and beloved by many children born in the 1990s. Since 2009, Ge Ping became famous due to MAD parodies made by netizens in China, stemming from a video from the past of Ge Ping addressing little viewers of the show. Many parodies create humor by the use of vulgar or sexual language, which outraged many fans of Ge Ping. However, there are also videos that seek to be inspirational; Ge Ping himself approved this type of parody, announcing that he would like to be the \"foundation stone\" for creative youngsters to step on."

Glasgow provided the setting for many of his novels, including the most widely read, Antimacassar City, The Philistines and The Puritans, begun in 1940 and which were later published as Wax Fruit: the Story of the Moorhouse Family in 1947, It eventually sold one million copies. These were two sequels, Aunt Bel (1949) and The Hayburn Family (1952). During World War II, he was an air raid warden. McCrone retired to the Lake District in 1968, where he died at Windermere on 30 May 1977. In October 2012, Antimacassar City was dramatised in ten parts by Clara Glynn for BBC Radio 4's Woman's Hour, starring Natasha Watson, Ian Brennan, Juliet Cadzow and Robin Laing."

He first appears in 1429. John VIII entrusted him with the symbolically important diplomatic missions of conferring the insignia of Despot to the Serbian rulers Đurađ Branković (in 1429 or 1435) and Lazar Branković (in 1446). In 1438–1439 he accompanied John VIII to the Council of Ferrara, and was appointed joint mesazon along with Manuel Iagaris Palaiologos. In this capacity he played an important role, putting pressure on the Byzantine delegation to accept the Union of the Churches. He was a relative of the Patriarch of Constantinople Joseph II, who died in 1439 during the Council. George left an endowment to the church of Santa Maria Novella in Florence, where Joseph was buried, for an annual mass in his memory."

  "text" : "George Augustine Hyde (July 2, 1923 – May 4, 2010) was an American bishop. He founded the Society of Domestic Missionaries and co-established with John Kazantks the first Christian congregation in the United States to minister openly to and with openly homosexual parishioners. He later served as metropolitan archbishop of the Orthodox-Catholic Church of America from 1970 to 1983. Hyde was a native of Chattanooga, Tennessee, who grew up in a Southern Baptist family in Atlanta and attended a seminary though he did not complete his seminary education. He was a high school teacher in Atlanta when he met Kazantks, an immigrant from Greece and former bishop of the Greek Orthodox Church who had been forced out of his native country after coming out. Affected by the denial of communion to, or outright excommunication of, openly homosexual parishioners, Hyde and Kazantks set out to form their own independent congregation that would welcome openly homosexual members. Their newly formed independent parish held its first formal meeting at the Winecoff Hotel in Atlanta on July 1, 1946, on the occasion of Hyde's ordination to the priesthood of the parish at the hands of Bishop Kazantks. The congregation celebrated Mass in the meeting room of the hotel, with its rental costs underwritten by the management of the Cotton Blossom Room, a gay bar located within the hotel, until late November when it moved to a large residential building in Atlanta's business district that could house a chapel and living quarters for local clergy. Informational and instructional classes continued to be held at the hotel until it was destroyed by fire on December 7. The church grew from an initial 85 members to over 200 members by the end of 1947, partly due to word of mouth promotion through Atlanta's LGBT community. In 1950, Hyde established the Society of Domestic Missionaries which coupled its missionary work with secular jobs as domestic workers. Kazantks, who had moved to Savannah to help develop the church in southern Georgia, returned to Greece in 1957 and died there later that year. Before leaving, Kazantks placed Hyde in touch with Archbishop Clement Sherwood of the American Holy Orthodox Catholic and Apostolic Eastern Church, who ordained him a bishop of the church on May 7, 1957. In 1960, Sherwood designated Hyde as \"Bishop of the Western Rite Missions\" of the OCCA and charged him with furthering the consolidation of ethnic bishoprics within the church into an indigenous Orthodox tradition. Sherwood died on April 9, 1969. The following year, Hyde was elected and enthroned as metropolitan archbishop, resulting in an exodus of ethnic bishoprics within the church who feared the new name of the \"Orthodox-Catholic Church of America\" would be foisted on them. Hyde retired for health reasons in 1983 and was succeeded by Metropolitan Archbishop Alfred Louis Lankenau as primate of the church. He came out of retirement in 1995 when the OCCA began to ordain women as clergy, a move which Hyde opposed. Hyde led a schism of members from the OCCA (known as the Autocephalous Orthodox Catholic Church of America) while living at his home in Belleair, Florida, a practice which he continued until his death on May 4, 2010. His ashes were interred in his family plot in Marietta, Georgia."

As head coach Gold led Irish to finishes of 8th and 10th position (of 12 teams) in what was then known as the Zurich Premiership. At the end of the 2004–2005 season, Gold was offered a chance to return to his native Cape Town; London Irish agreed to release him from his contract, and he returned to South Africa to take up the role of forwards coach at Western Province (rugby team). After two seasons as forwards coach, Gold took on the role of head coach at Western Province in July 2007 after Kobus Van Der Merwe and Jerome Paarwater resigned from their positions as head coach and assistant head coach, respectively. In May 2008 Gold was appointed by Peter de Villiers as an assistant coach of the Springboks. He would hold this position during the British and Irish Lions 2009 tour of South Africa and the 2011 Rugby World Cup in which the Springboks were knocked out in the quarter finals after a controversial 11–9 defeat to Australia. In January 2012, with Newcastle Falcons nine points adrift in the relegation zone of the Aviva Premiership, they announced that Gold and Mike Ford (rugby) would join the club. Gold was made head coach and Ford defence coach. By the end of the season Newcastle had all but closed the points gap on London Wasps and ended up being relegated by one point. In May 2012 Bath Rugby appointed Gold as head coach of a coaching team that includes Ford, Brad Davis, Toby Booth and Neil Hatley. However, after a lacklustre season, Gold was elevated to Director of Rugby, with Ford becoming head coach. On 9 December 2013, Gold departed at the behest of owner Bruce Craig. In 2014, Gold was named head coach of the Natal Sharks."

  "text" : "Gervase Pierrepont, 1st Baron Pierrepont (1649 – 22 May 1715), was an English politician. Pierrepont was the younger son of the Honourable William Pierrepont, second son of Robert Pierrepont, 1st Earl of Kingston-upon-Hull. His mother was Elizabeth, daughter of Sir Thomas Harries, 1st Baronet, of Tong Castle, Shropshire. He was the uncle of Robert Pierrepont, 3rd Earl of Kingston-upon-Hull, William Pierrepont, 4th Earl of Kingston-upon-Hull, and Evelyn Pierrepont, 1st Duke of Kingston-upon-Hull. Pierrepont was returned to Parliament as one of two representatives for Appleby in 1698, a seat he held until 1705. In 1702 he was raised to the Peerage of Ireland as Baron Pierrepont, of Ardglass. This creation in the Peerage of Ireland allowed him to be ennobled, yet still remain in the House of Commons. In 1714 he was further honoured when he was made Baron Pierrepont, of Hanslape in the County of Buckingham, in the Peerage of Great Britain, with this creation giving him an automatic seat in the House of Lords. Lord Pierrepont married Lucy Pelham, daughter of Sir John Pelham, 3rd Baronet, in 1680. He died in May 1715 when the baronies became extinct. Lady Pierrepont died in July 1721."

  "text" : "Guy Arnold (born 1932) is a British author based in Marylebone, London, and a specialist in north-south relations who writes mainly in the areas of African history and politics, and international affairs. Over the course of his career, he has worked with the Overseas Development Institute, he created a National Youth Service in Zambia in the period before its independence in 1964, and was Director of the Africa Bureau (a non-governmental lobby group) from 1968 to 1972, as well as working as a consultant in the field. He is the author of more than 50 books including travelogues and educational books for children. He is an older brother to Bruce Arnold, a novelist and journalist based in Dublin. He has lectured and taught courses on international affairs for over thirty years, at the Workers’ Educational Association and the University of Surrey. While, most government officials on both sides have supported the Special Relationship between Britain and the United States, Guy has been sharp critics. In 2014 he denounced it as a “sickness in the body politic of Britain that needs to be flushed out”. Instead Arnold calls for closer relationship with Europe and Russia so as to rid “itself of the US incubus.”"

  "text" : "Giuseppe Gaetano Descalzi (1767-1855) was a Genoese furniture maker, best known as the inventor of the Chiavari chair. Giuseppe Gaetano Descalzi was born in Chiavari in the Republic of Genoa in 1767, the son of a cooper.He was called \"il Campanino\" (\"the bell ringer\") because his grandfather was the bell-ringer of the Bacezza church.Descalzi was apprenticed to one of the best master carpenters of Chiavari, and became a master craftsman himself.In 1795 the Descalzi brothers opened a furniture workshop. In 1796 he received a silver medal for two wooden chests of drawers from the Chiavari Società Economica,which had been founded five years earlier by the Marquis Stefano Rivarola.Descalzi introduced the use of a polished slab of San Giacomo slate as a tabletop, a low-cost alternative to marble. In 1807 Rivarola challenged Descalzi to design a new, modern chair based on a chair that he had brought from Paris.Descalzi created a simple, practical and elegant design for a cherrywood chair.The chairs are both light and robust.Descalzi exploited traditional knowledge, paid strict attention to quality and developed new manufacturing techniques. Chairs using the \"Chiavarine\" design became extremely popular and were purchased by many of the monarchs of the time.Descalzi's furniture designs won numerous medals at trade shows.His sons Emanuele and Giacomo and their descendants continued the chair making industry that he had founded.Many other factories opened in Chiavari and the surrounding towns, and some continue to make furniture today."
