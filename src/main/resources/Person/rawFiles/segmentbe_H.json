Inoue is an active researcher on the Nanjing massacre and believes that more than 100,000 POWs, captured plainclothes guerrillas, and civilians were murdered by the Japanese army in Nanjing city and its vicinity and in the surrounding six counties. He and his colleague Akira Fujiwara supervised the first Japanese translation of Iris Chang's The Rape of Nanking which was not released because Chang refused to change the text in 62 places where Inoue had advised making corrections."

  "text" : "Herman I, Count of Winzenburg (also known as Herman of Windberg; c. 1083 – 1137 or 1138) was count of Formbach and Radelberg. From 1109 to 1130, he was also Count of Winzenburg and from 1122 to 1138, he was Count of Reinhausen. He was also Landgrave of Thuringia from 1111 to 1130 and Margrave of Meissen from 1124 to 1130. And finally, he was high bailiff of Corvey Abbey. He was a son of Count Meginhard IV of Formbach, and his wife Matilda, a daughter of Count Elli II of Reinhausen. At a young age, he moved in with his maternal uncle, Bishop Udo of Hildesheim. In Hildesheim, he attended the cathedral school. At the age of sixteen, he travelled with his uncle to Mainz, to be presented to the emperor on 9 November 1099. He was the first member of the family to call himself of Winzenburg, after Winzenburg Castle, southeast of Alfeld, which he received as a fief from his uncle Udo. He was an advisor of Emperor Henry V and became very powerful during Henry's reign. In 1109, Henry V sent him to Rome, as a member of a diplomatic mission. In 1111 or 1112, he became the first Landgrave of Thuringia, after it was split off from the Duchy of Saxony. He fulfilled his obligations as bailiff of Corvey Abbey from a distance. When the sons of Count Widekind I of Schwalenberg attacked the abbey, Herman remained inactive. In the Investiture Controversy, he sided with the Pope. This meant that he had to flee to the area where he was born, on the upper Inn. He made a large donation to the Göttweig Abbey. In 1122, his uncle Herman III of Reinhausen died in Formbach, and thereby the Counts of Reinhausen died out in the male line. As his closest relative, Herman I inherited Reinhausen and he also became bailiff of Reinhausen Abbey, which his maternal ancestors had founded. Later that year, his father died, and Herman I inherited Windberg and Formbach as well. He also became Count of the Leinegau. In 1130, he came into conflict with Burchard I of Loccum, and advisor of Emperor Lothair III, about the construction of Burchard's castle. Herman I had Burchard assassinated on a cemetery. On 18 August 1130, during the Diet of Quedlinburg, Herman was outlawed for this murder, and all his fiefs were revoked: \n*  The Landgraviate of Thuringia was given to Louis VII of Bavaria. \n*  The Margraviate of Meissen was given in its entirety to Conrad of Wettin. \n*  Winzenburg castle and the associated manors fell back to the Bishopric of Hildesheim, because these were fiefs from Hildesheim. Herman I and his sons Herman II and Henry retreated to Winzenburg Castle, and defended it for several months against the army the Emperor had sent. They surrendered on 31 December 1130. Herman I was arrested and brought the Blankenburg. He was then held in custody in the Rhineland for several years. In 1134, he was released and charged with defensive duties in Holstein. He was commander of Segeberg fortress, where he died in 1137 or 1138. His death was mentioned in a document about the family that founded Reinhausen Abbey, written by abbott Reinhard sometime between 1153 and 1156. Reinhard himself died on 7 May 1156 and was buried in the church of Reinhausen Abbey. The document can be found in the State Archive in Hanover, document nr. 2 in the Reinhausen Abbey file."

  "text" : "Hiroshi Honda (1910-1970) was an American painter who was born in Hilo, Hawaii to Japanese parents who had immigrated to Hawaii at the turn of the twentieth century. He was sent to Kumamoto at age 6 to study and help with the family business, and while there studied sumi-e ink painting. He was conscripted into the Japanese Air Force as a young man, and served for seven years before being wounded and discharged. He returned to Hilo in 1939 and took a job teaching at a local Japanese language school, occasionally doing commercial painting work on the side. In 1940, he met a Nisei woman, Sadako Hashida, and the couple married and moved to Honolulu soon after. Once in Honolulu Honda began teaching at a Nu'uanu Japanese school, and he spent the morning of the December 7, 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor at the school. Upon returning home he was arrested by military police and eventually interned at Sand Island. His wife gave birth to the couple's first child in May 1942, and a few months later, upon learning that Honda would be transferred to an internment camp on the mainland, volunteered to accompany him along with her father and sister. Honda was removed from the transport ship at the last minute, resulting in his separation from the family for several months; Sadako and the others were first sent to Jerome, Arkansas before being transferred to California. Later, in 1943, Sadako's father and sister were assigned to Manzanar, while Honda, Sadako and their infant son were reunited in the maximum security Tule Lake Segregation Center. While in Tule Lake the couple had two more children, a daughter and a second son, and Honda produced many drawings and watercolor paintings. After the war, the Hondas moved to New York, where Hiroshi studied under Yasuo Kuniyoshi while Sadako worked as a seamstress to support the family. In 1949, the family moved back to Hilo, however Honda soon grew dissatisfied working for his wife's family's agriculture business and returned to New York alone. Sadako eventually remarried to Honda's brother, who had provided financial support to the family after Honda left. Little information on Honda's later life exists on record, however sources suggest that he remained in New York and remarried as well. The Honolulu Museum of Art, which owns a large collection of Hiroshi Honda’s works, has held two solo exhibitions of this artist— Reflections of Internment: The Art of Hawaii’s Hiroshi Honda in 1994 and Hiroshi Honda: Detained in 2012."

  "text" : "Hugh de Burgh (died c. 1351) was a Crown official and judge in fourteenth-century Ireland, who held the offices of Lord High Treasurer of Ireland and Chief Baron of the Irish Exchequer. He was initially praised for his good service to the Crown, but later accused of maladministration. Although he is thought to have been born in England, he belonged to the leading Anglo-Irish de Burgh dynasty; he was a cousin of William Donn de Burgh, 3rd Earl of Ulster, and later acted as attorney for the Earl's daughter and heiress Elizabeth, Duchess of Clarence. Despite subsequent complaints about his misconduct, as a professional lawyer he was better qualified for appointment the Bench than some of his colleagues, since Barons of the  Court of Exchequer (Ireland) in that era were often accused of being deficient in their knowledge of the law. As was then common for men seeking appointment to the Bench, he was in holy orders. He was in the service of the Crown in 1331, when he visited Ireland; and later became Irish attorney to Queen Philippa of Hainault. In 1335 he became third Baron of the Court of Exchequer (Ireland). In 1337 he was continued in office for four years in consideration of his past good service, and shortly after became Chief Baron. He was appointed Keeper of the Great Seal of Ireland in 1339 and Lord Treasurer in 1340. He was reappointed Chief Baron in 1344. In 1347 he was accused of misconduct, and a commission of oyer and terminer was set up to inquire into his official oppression. Precisely what form the alleged oppression (a term which has no modern equivalent) took is unclear: later charges against his successor John de Burnham were concerned with fraud and financial mismanagement, and it seems that the Privy Council of Ireland had some doubts about de Burgh's honesty. The complaints against him formed part of a pattern of general dissatisfaction with the King's ministers, and as a result the commission's remit was soon extended into a general examination of official wrongdoing. John de Burnham, an English Crown official with long experience of financial administration was sent to Ireland as Treasurer to reform these perceived abuses, only to spend much of his career fighting similar charges of corruption. In 1348 de Burgh went to England to plead his case; presumably he made a convincing defence of his actions, since he received a royal pardon. He returned to Ireland, and remained Chief Baron until 1351, when he probably died."

  "text" : "Hajji Bagcho Sherzai, also known as Haji Bagh Chagul or Haji Bagcho (born 1954), is a convicted drug trafficker from Afghanistan who is currently serving a life sentence in U.S. Federal prison. He is accused by the United States for having ties with the Taliban. He was convicted on March 13, 2012, by a jury in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia of conspiracy, distribution of heroin for importation into the United States and narco-terrorism. It was alleged that Bagcho exported heroin to more than twenty different countries, including the United States. He faces a mandatory minimum sentence of 20 years and a maximum of life in prison. On June 12, 2012, a sentencing hearing is scheduled before Ellen Segal Huvelle in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. He is believed to have lived in the Marco village in Nangahar Province. He also owned a compound in Hayatabad, outside of Peshawar, Pakistan. He is married and has several children. His eldest son is believed to be named Sucha Gul. In June 2009, Baghcho was arrested in Afghanistan and extradited to USA. Khadi Gul, his younger brother, denied that Bagcho had ever provided money to the Taliban. Bagcho, who has been involved in the drug trafficking business since at least the 1990s, was ordered to forfeit $254,203,032 (more than £160,000,000). With the help of cooperating witnesses, including Afghan National Security Forces (ANSF), and ledgers which were found during searches of his house, the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) prepared a major criminal case. One ledger, cataloguing Bagcho's activities during 2006, reflected heroin transactions of more than 123,000 kilograms, worth more than $250 million, according to Bagcho's ledger. Bagcho used a portion of his drug proceeds to fund Taliban governor of Nangarhar Province and two Taliban commanders responsible for insurgent activity in eastern Afghanistan with cash, weapons and other supplies so that they could continue their \"jihad\" against western troops and the Afghan government. Based on heroin production statistics compiled by the United Nations Office of Drugs and Crime, in 2006, Bagcho's activities accounted for approximately 20% of the world’s total production for that year. As of June 2012, Bagcho is the second person to be convicted under the US narco-terrorism statute."

  "text" : "Henricus Christophorus Christianus Wegener (1757–1799) was a lawyer from Wismar, Germany, working for the Dutch colonial authorities in the Dutch East Indies Dutch Indies in the years following the French Revolution French revolution. He was from a Lutheran family.Henricus represented post-revolutionary Holland, and was at odds with the Dutch colonials in the Indies. Sources written 100 years later describe the tumultuous battles between Henricus and the colonials. He was sent away from Batavia by the colonials, only to return with higher powers. Some sort of physical altercation in Batavia forced him at last to flee the town and seek refuge with friends in nearby Tangerang. From there he was sent home one final time on the Holger Danske - a Danish merchant ship trading between Europe and the Indies, owned by Frédéric de Coninck and captained by one Capt. Smit. On the final journey home, the ship got into a storm at the Cape and its rudder was damaged. Rather than seek refuge at the Cape the ship turned East and North again and entered the waters near Mozambique where it was eventually seized by the British. The reason the ship did not seek shelter at the British-occupied Cape, and the reason it was ultimately seized waere the socalled English Wars English Wars (Scandinavia) and the then common practise of the British Navy to seize non-ally ships that sailed, or were suspected of sailing, goods for the French. The ship's logbook shows that prior to seizure several people left the ship to go ashore - among these were Wegener. Family letters recount that Wegener somehow died and his body was found on the shore of Mozambique. Previously he had sent two daughters, Wilhelmine and Henriette, to a boarding school in Denmark.Near 1900 - a hundred years after Henricus' death - it is evident that he was still considered an important figure in the struggle between royalists and revolutionaries. It is evident from the sources that the nature of the conflict between Henricus and the colonial citizens in Batavia had to do with individuals' rights and freedoms. Descendants of Henricus' daughter Henriette include Prof. Andreas Thejll da:Andreas Thejll. A pastel miniature by Charles H. Hodges of Henricus hangs at the Museum of National History Frederiksborg castle at Frederiksborg castle, Denmark. Sources also include privately held letters and an account of one of Henricus' children."

After study at the University of Texas at El Paso, where he received a bachelor's degree, and the University of Texas at Austin, which awarded him a masters of fine arts degree, he spent nine years as a teacher in secondary schools in Idaho and Texas, followed by three years as a forensics coach at Lamar University in Texas. He then enrolled for further study at Louisiana State University, where he earned his Ph.D. in speech communication in 1971. After obtaining his Ph.D., Dorgan joined the faculty of the Department of Communication of Appalachian State University, serving there from 1971 until his retirement in 2000. A fascination with the rhythmical style of Appalachia's old-time Baptist preachers led him into more than thirty years of rhetorical and ethnographic research on religion in Appalachia, with a particular focus on traditional Baptist sub-denominations indigenous to the region. He served as editor for the religion section of the Encyclopedia of Appalachia. He received the 1993 Thomas Wolfe Literary Award for the book Airwaves of Zion: Radio Religion In Appalachia."

  "text" : "Henry Edward Detmold (4 October 1854 Surbiton, Kingston upon Thames - 1924 Paris), born into an affluent merchant family of German origin, was an English painter and illustrator, specialising in landscape, figure and marine painting, and a founder member of the Newlyn School. He studied at Düsseldorf, Brussels, Munich and in Paris under Carolus Duran. His works were exhibited in London from 1879 and in Paris and he regularly commuted between the two cities between 1881 and 1900. The Newlyn School to which he belonged was a group of landscape painters working from the coastal town of Newlyn in Cornwall, some of whom had also spent time on the Continent. Detmold arrived in Newlyn in 1885. He played in the Newlyn cricket team in matches against St Ives, and in the Artists of West Cornwall XI against Penzance in 1888. With fellow artists he lodged for a while at 7 Bellair Terrace, St Ives. The scenes he painted were of places he visited in England, France, Cairo and North Africa.

  "text" : "Sir Charles Hubert Bond KBE FRCP (6 September 1870 – 18 April 1945) was a British psychiatrist and mental health administrator. Bond was born in the village of Ogbourne St George, Wiltshire, the son of the Reverend Alfred Bond, the local vicar. His younger brother was Sir Reginald Bond, later medical director-general of the Royal Navy. He trained as a doctor at University of Edinburgh, graduating Bachelor of Medicine (MB) in 1892, Bachelor of Science (BSc) in Public Health in 1893, Doctor of Medicine (MD) in 1895, and Doctor of Science (DSc) in 1898. He was Gaskell Gold Medallist in Mental Disorders in 1898. He then took a post at Morningside Asylum in Edinburgh, before transferring to posts at Wakefield Asylum and Banstead Asylum and then as first deputy medical superintendent of Bexley Asylum. In 1903 he was appointed first medical superintendent of Ewell Colony for Epileptics in Surrey and in 1907 he became first medical superintendent of Long Grove Asylum. He was appointed a Commissioner in Lunacy in 1912 and a commissioner at the new Board of Control for Lunacy and Mental Deficiency in 1914, remaining there until his retirement less than a month before his death in 1945. In 1930 he became one of the four senior commissioners on the board. Bond favoured voluntary admission to mental hospitals rather than certification, reforms finally introduced in the Mental Treatment Act 1930. In 1924 he and another doctor were sued by a patient for wrongful detention. They jury found for the plaintiff and awarded him the huge sum of £25,000 damages. The Court of Appeal set the verdict aside and ordered a retrial (later confirmed by the House of Lords), but the plaintiff eventually settled out of court for £250 damages. This contributed to changes in the law in the 1930 act. Bond was also lecturer in mental disorders at the Maudsley Hospital from 1919 to 1939, lecturing to trainee psychiatrists on mental illness and the law. He was honorary general secretary of the Royal Medico-Psychological Association from 1906 to 1912 (and president from 1921 to 1922), a member of the War Office Shell-Shock Committee from 1920 to 1922, chairman of the Departmental Committee on Nursing in County and Borough Mental Hospitals from 1922 to 1924, president of the Association of Occupational Therapists from 1937 until his death, vice-president of the Lebanon Hospital from 1937 until his death, and a member of the Central Medical War Committee from 1939 until his death. He was consultant in neurology and mental disorders to the Royal Navy from 1925 until his death. In both world wars he worked on adapting mental hospitals for military use and for this work in the First World War he was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in January 1920. He was appointed Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire (KBE) in 1929. On 12 May 1900, Bond married Janet Constance Laurie; they had one daughter. They lived in St Annes, Lancashire."

She joined the Royal Free Hospital as a pathologist, taking charge of the department at the age of only 24. She also lectured at the University of London and was a part-time researcher at the Cancer Research Laboratories at the Middlesex Hospital. During the First World War she worked at the Endell Street Military Hospital, the only British wartime hospital entirely staffed by women. For this work she was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in January 1920. After the war she took a full-time cancer research appointment with the Medical Research Council at the Middlesex Hospital's Barnato Joel Laboratories. In 1924–1925 she organised a group of female doctors in an effort to improve the use of radium in cancer treatment, especially of women, at the Royal Free Hospital, Elizabeth Garrett Anderson Hospital, South London Hospital and New Sussex Hospital in Brighton. The success of this project led to the establishment of the Marie Curie Hospital on Fitzjohn's Avenue, Hampstead in 1930, where she became pathologist. Chambers lived in Watford."

Believing they represented a fresh hope for the war-torn country, Nambora returned to Cambodia where he was immediately interned in a labour camp where his father Hor Namhong served as a chief of Being Trabek Prison. He worked as a researcher at the Tuol Sleng Genocide Museum from 1980 to 1985 and as director of the Humanitarian Relief Committee in Kompong Som Port from 1986 to 1987. In 1988 he joined the Foreign Ministry and within a few years was appointed to posts in Thailand and then with the United Nations in Geneva. In 1996 Nambora returned to Cambodia to enter politics, accepting the titles of Under-secretary of State and Foreign Affairs Adviser from prime minister Hun Sen. In 1999 he, with help of his father Hor Namhong, returned to diplomacy when he was appointed ambassador to Australia and New Zealand. Nambora used his position there to improve ties between ASEAN leaders and those countries. In 2004 he was transferred to London when he was appointed ambassador to the United Kingdom, Denmark, Finland, Ireland, Norway and Sweden. He became the first Cambodian ambassador to the United Kingdom since the embassy was abandoned in 1975. In 2011 the ambassadorship to Ethiopia was added to his responsibilities."

Her great grandmother Marna Nilsdotter, as well as her grandmother Elna Hansson, was active in this field. Her mother and grandmother worked together as medical practitioners in Malmö. Her grandmother was famous in all Scandinavia as the Lundakvinnan (\"Lund-Woman\"), and had educated herself to a barber surgeon to avoid being accused of quackery. When the universities of Sweden were opened to women in 1870, her mother and grandmother decided that she should study medicine at a university and obtain a formal license, to avoid being persecuted and accused of quackery, which had been the case with many women in the history of their family. Hedda Andersson was educated at the school of Maria Stenkula, and was admitted to Lund University in 1880. She has been referred to as the first female student there, though actually this was Hildegard Björck only shortly before. She was the only female there until 1882, but she was reportedly treated with respect by her male fellow students. She took her bachelor's degree in 1887 and her medical license in 1892. She thereby became the second female physician to have graduated from a Swedish university after Karolina Widerström. She was active as a doctor in Ronneby 1892–95, in Malmö in 1893–95 and in Stockholm 1895-1925, after which she settled in Lund. She also studied in Copenhagen in 1892 and 1895 and under Max Sänger in Leipzig in 1893."

She came into contact with artists from the Cuenca group and from the El Paso group and she became increasingly interested in the Spanish art scene.In January 1980 she started to work at the Juana Mordó gallery: those were years of apprenticeship, both in relation to management and to honing her knowledge about international art scene, particularly thanks to attending art fairs such as Art Basel, the FIAC in Paris and the Cologne Fair. Furthermore, in 1982 art galleries took a step towards innovating the Spanish scene by establishing the ARCO art fair."

  "text" : "Hamza Driouch (Arabic: حمزة الدريوش‎‎; born 16 November 1994) is a Qatari track and field athlete. He was born in Guelmim, Morocco. The Qatari mid-distance runner is a promising athlete with a good record in athletics competitions. He proved his talent through a series of good results. He won a silver medal in the inaugural Youth Olympic Games 2010 in Singapore and took gold in the 1,500m at the 2012 IAAF World Junior Championships in Athletics in Barcelona. Driouch is a Moroccan citizen, he moved to Qatar in 2010 with his brother, who was then looking for a job in the Gulf State. His father being deceased, his elder brother Ibrahim was looking after him. Hamza Driouch subsequently obtained Qatari nationality, Although the fact that the Qatari nationality must be obtained after 20 years of residence in Qatar but it was not the case with Driouch. Additionally, Hamza was granted the Qatari nationality before reaching age of 18. Driouch made his Olympic debut for Qatar at the 2012 Summer Olympics in London. He qualified for London with an ‘A’ standard time of 3:34.50 in the Men's 1500m. In February 2015 it was announced that Driouch had been banned from athletics for 2 years for abnormalities in his biological passport profile. His results from 2 August 2012 and onwards were annulled, which included his results from the semi-final at the 2012 Summer Olympics. Before and during the London Summer Olympics, Hamza Driouch was coached by Jama Aden. A possible explanation for the more than 28 month long delay of Driouch doping ban is provided by the WADA Independent commission report #2 (page 68) where it says. \"...as a result of the internal frictions, although no passport cases were brought forward by the IAAF, the data was still being collected as a result of the testing program. Dollé`s employment was terminated in September 2014. This seemed to unlock the situation at the IAAF. In December 2014, the IAAF engaged the APMU [Athlete Passport Management Unit] associated with the WADA accredited laboratory in Montreal to manage its blood ABP [Athlete Biological Passport] program. The laboratory official in charge of the function reviews all passports on an anonymous basis, with all atypical passports sent, without delay, to an independent expert for review...\"The date matches well the dates for Driouch doping ban. 'Dollé' is Gabriel, at the time IAAF anti-doping head, who during 2015 was put under investigation accused of corruption.References"

The first time the swimming fraternity took note of him was at the Western Province Championships in December 2005, when, as a 14-year-old, he broke the 800 meter freestyle open record. In 2008 Heerden participated in the FINA World Junior Swimming Championships in Monterrey, Mexico where he won the gold in the 800 meter freestyle. At the 2010 Commonwealth Games in India he won the silver medal in the 1500 meter freestyle and as a member of the 4X200 meter freestyle relay team, they took the bronze. At the Western Province Championships in December 2010, Heerden swam a time of 14:57.88 in the 1500 meter freestyle, breaking Ryk Neethling’s record and setting a new SA National Open record. With this swim he became the first South African, and the second swimmer from the African continent to finish the 1500m freestyle in less than 15 minutes. He ended the season being ranked number six in the world for the 1500 meter freestyle and under the top 20 in the world for both the 400m and 800m freestyle events. Heerden was one of only a handful of swimmers to qualify for more than one event for the 2012 London Olympics – the 400 and 1500 meter freestyle events. Due to longterm illness he did not perform to his best at the Olympics and decided to retire. Heerden completed his university studies at Stellenbosch University with distinction at the end of 2013 and was awarded the Rhodes Scholarship to study at Oxford University from 2014."

  "text" : "Harry Freeman (29 July 1858 – 30 July 1922) was an English music hall performer of the Victorian era and early twentieth century, and the first King Rat of the showbusiness charity the Grand Order of Water Rats. Among his popular songs were 'Leicester Square' and 'The Giddy little Girl said, \"No!\"'. Freeman was born near Bromsgrove in Worcestershire in 1858. In his early teens he moved to Birmingham where he was mainly to be based as an entertainer until his death. His first public appearance was aged 19 in 1877 at a 'Free and Easy' at the Imperial Theatre in Walsall. This was such a success that he received bookings at all the main music halls in the Midlands. He made his London debut at 'Lusby's Music Hall' in 1881. Freeman became a popular entertainer in the music halls of London and the provinces, but he never gained the fame or success in these that he held in his native Birmingham. His songs included 'Can't Stop', 'They're After Me', 'It Never Troubles Me', 'The Giddy little Girl said, \"No!\"', 'They Were All Occupied' and 'Leicester Square'. A popular success was the song 'Wot Cher Trilby', written by Cart Howard following the success of the stage play Trilby, and which Freeman sang dressed in female attire. During the early 1890s Freeman was living in London, and when the Grand Order of Water Rats was formed in 1890 by Joe Elvin and Jack Lotto, music hall star Dan Leno was to have been the first King Rat of the order, but he preferred not to be King for the first year, and the office went instead to Freeman. In 1896 he appeared on the bill at 'The Paragon Theatre of Varieties' on the Mile End Road in London's East End. Freeman was one of the 231 figures depicted in Walter Lambert's 'Popularity', a vast painting depicting the music hall stars of the early 1900s. His last public appearance was in Norwich in May 1922. Harry Freeman died on 30 July 1922 following an abdominal operation in St Peter's Hospital in Covent Garden. He was buried in St Mary's Church, Handsworth in his native Birmingham on 4 August 1922."

  "text" : "Hieronymus Roth (1606–1678) was a lawyer and alderman of Königsberg (Polish: Królewiec, modern day Kaliningrad) who led the city burghers in opposition to Elector Frederick William. In the Treaty of Oliva of 1660 the Elector had managed to have himself recognized as sovereign in Ducal Prussia and no longer a vassal of the King of Poland. The Prussian Estates and Roth saw this as a step towards tyranny: before, when a conflict between the Estates and the Elector arose, the Estates always had a recourse to a higher authority, the King of Poland, but now this check had been removed. In 1661 the Prussian council, led by Roth, repudiated the Treaty of Oliva, stating that the transfer of sovereignty from Poland to the Elector was not valid without their consent. Roth then sent a plea to the King of Poland John II Casimir Vasa, asking for assistance. Furthermore, Roth and the burghers objected to Frederick's requirement that henceforth the Prussian Estates could meet only with his approval, and to the higher taxes the Elector had levied without their consent. As a result, Königsberg and her council refused to make an oath of allegiance to the Elector, and sent letters to the Polish king in Warsaw asking if they could \"become Polish subjects once more, as (they) had been in the past\". However, with no help for the burghers immediately forthcoming from the King of Poland, in October 1662 Frederick William arrived in Königsberg with two thousand soldiers and had Roth arrested, swearing that Roth would be \"interrogated tomorrow, condemned the next and executed on Tuesday or Wednesday\". While Roth was not immediately tried and killed, possibly because he would have been acquitted of any charge the Elector could bring against him, he was imprisoned in a fortress in Peitz, Brandenburg, far away from Ducal Prussia. Initially, the terms of Roth's imprisonment were relatively benign and the Elector stated that he would free him if Roth would admit to treason. However, Roth refused to ask for pardon and secretly continued agitation against the Elector via clandestine letters sent from his prison cell. When these were discovered, the conditions in the prison were made worse and Frederick swore to never release him. At the end of his life, at the age of seventy, Roth finally did submit himself to the Elector, but he remained imprisoned and died two years later. With the death of Count Christian Ludwig von Kalckstein in 1672, who had been kidnapped from Poland by Frederick William's agents and executed in Memel (Kłajpeda), and the end of resistance to the Elector in Königsberg in 1674, the opposition of the Prussian Estates to Hohenzollern absolutism in Ducal Prussia came to an end."

He was one of the old style farmers, locally well known, and spent much of his life farming a mixed arable and livestock business at Hartburn, near Morpeth, Northumberland. He began his artistic work of drawings, sketches, cartoons etc. in the 1970s and these together with his writings became very popular, and featured regularly in the farming magazines, particularly the West Cumberland Farmers Journal, regional NFU journals and Livestock Farming.His book, Funnywayt'mekalivin' was a great success at the 1983 Smithfield Show with Henry Brewis in great demand to sign copies of the book. He eventually sold his property on a lease-back arrangement so that he could spend more time on his side-line which by now had developed into a not so small local industry with the addition of greetings cards, decorated beer mugs and Tee shirts etc., audio tapes and prints of his cartoons. He had by this time even converted a byre into a studio.Henry Brewis died in 2000 leaving three children and two grandchildren."

He was born in Swift Current, Saskatchewan, grew up on the family farm and was educated in Eston and at the University of Saskatchewan. After farming for several years, Owens worked as foreman for the rural municipality of Snipe Lake and then was an automobile and farm implement dealer in Eston.

Interested in film at a young age, she took film studies at the University of Toronto and, later, New York University. While in university she was influenced by gender and minority theories, as reflected in her first film, the short Sally's Beauty Spot (1990). While continuing her studies she produced two more films before taking a five-year hiatus to live in Korea beginning in 1995. After her return, she released another short film and her feature film debut, The Art of Woo (2001). She continues to produce short films, although at a reduced rate. Lee's films often deal with gender and racial issues, reflecting the state of East Asians in modern society; a common theme in her work is sexuality, with several films featuring interracial relationships."

  "text" : "Hedwig of Gudensberg, also known as Hedwig of Hesse (1098–1148) was a member of the Gisones family. She was the daughter and heiress of Giso IV, Count of Gudensberg (1070 – 12 March 1122), Count of Gudensberg and Hesse and his wife, Kunigunde of Bilstein (d. 1138/1140). Hedwig married in 1110 to Louis, the son of Count Louis the Springer of Thuringia. Her husband was elevated to Landgrave of Thuringia in 1131. After her brother Giso V, Count of Gudensberg, the County of Hesse and the other vast possessions of the Gisones dynasty fell to her and her husband and thus fell to the Thuringian branch of the Ludowingians dynasty. In 1122, Hedwig's mother, Kunigunde of Bilstein remarried to Henry Raspe I, who was Louis I's younger brother. Kunigunde thus became her daughter's sister-in-law. Via these two marriages, the Thuringian counts inherited an extensive triple heritage: 1.  \n*  The possessions of the Gisones dynasty to the North of Marburg, including the bailiwick of Wetter 2.  \n*  A large part of the Lordship of Bilstein south of Marburg, plus the bailiff of Hersfeld Abbey 3.  \n*  The possessions of the Counts of Werner. This family had died out in 1121 and Hedwig's parents had inherited their possessions. These include the County of Maden-Gudensberg and the post of bailiff of the Fritzlar Cathedral, Hasungen Abbey and Breitenau Abbey In 1128 Hedwig gave birth to her son Louis II. In 1140, Louis I died and King Conrad III enfeoffed twelve-year-old Louis II with Thuringia. While he was a minor, Hedwig acted as regent. In 1148, Hedwig founded Ahnaberg Abbey, together with her second son Henry Raspe II, who at the time administered the parts of Hesse held by the Ludowingians. A settlement grew between this abbey and the former Franconian royal court Chasalla (from Latin: Castellum, \"castle\"), on the left bank of the Fulda and this settlement developed into the city of Kassel, which became the capital of Hesse in the 13th century."

  "text" : "Harrison McAllister Randall (December 17, 1870 – November 10, 1969) was an American physicist whose leadership from 1915 to 1941 brought the University of Michigan to international prominence in experimental and theoretical physics. Randall was born in Burr Oak, Michigan on December 17, 1870. His family then moved to Ann Arbor, where he spent his formative years and most of his life. He graduated from the Ann Arbor High School (now Pioneer High School) in 1889, and then earned his bachelor's degree in physics from the University of Michigan in 1893. A year later he completed a master's degree, then spent a few years teaching in high schools in West Bay City and Saginaw, living with his girlfriend Ida Muma who had a degree in classical studies from Michigan. On August 24, 1898 he married Ida, then in 1899 he returned to the University of Michigan to work as an instructor and finish his doctorate. He completed his PhD in physics in 1902, and immediately took a position on the faculty of the University, where he remained for the next 38 years. In 1910 Randall moved abroad to work under Professor Friedrich Paschen at the University of Tubingen—55 years before Tubingen and Ann Arbor would become sister cities. This was shortly after Paschen had discovered what is now called the Paschen series in the spectrum of hydrogen, and about 20 years after the discovery of what is now called Paschen's Law of electrical discharges. Randall said that he knew nothing about spectroscopy at the time and Paschen simply handed him a spectrometer and expected him to get to work—which he ultimately did. Even to the end of his life Randall considered Paschen his greatest mentor. Prior to 1910, the Michigan Physics Department had focused on precision metrology. Dr. Randall, who took all of his degrees at Michigan, initially specialized in that subject. In 1902, his PhD thesis measured the coefficient of expansion of quartz. During his 1910-11 sabbatical year in Tübingen, Germany he met Friedrich Paschen and became an expert in infrared spectroscopy. Quantum mechanics did not yet exist as a field, and the study of atomic spectra was largely ad hoc experimentation with very little theoretical underpinning. This was also the training Randall received as a young physicist. But Randall came home from his 1910 sabbatical at Tubingen with new ideas (as well as some new equipment Paschen had helped him develop), and went on to lead a radical overhaul of physics research at Michigan."

  "text" : "Howard Gary Costigan (1904–1985) was an American radio commentator, political functionary, and politician. Costigan is best remembered as the Executive Secretary of the Washington Commonwealth Federation during the second half of the 1930s, during which time he was simultaneously a secret member of the Communist Party USA (CPUSA), and for having provided testimony in support of legislative committees investigating Communist activities. Costigan left the Communist Party in 1940, shortly after the conclusion of the Nazi-Soviet Pact. In 1948 Costigan provided testimony as a friendly witness to the Canwell Committee of the Washington State Legislature, charged with investigating Communist influence in the state. In May 1954 Costigan played a similar role on behalf of the House Committee on Un-American Activities during that committee's investigation of radicalism in the Pacific Northwest."

  "text" : "Herman \"Flying Dutchman\" Willemse (born ca. 1934 in Utrecht) was a Dutch long-distance and marathon swimmer. In 2008, he was inducted to the International Marathon Swimming Hall of Fame. Willemse started his career as a freestyle swimmer, winning 13 national titles and setting 19 national records in the 100 m, 200 m, 400 m, 800 m and 1500 m events between 1952 and 1958. In 1959, he switched to marathon swimming and became the second Dutchman to cross the English Channel, with a time of 12h49. Later in the 1960s he dominated the world marathon swimming. For three years after 1964, when the point system was introduced, he was ranked world number two, after Abo Heif. His clean sweep of the Around-the-Island Marathon Swim in 1960–1964 brought the organizers to a problem that spectators lost interest in the race. The race was discontinued in 1965. A school teacher by profession, Willemse was known for his academic approach to swimming. He would often travel around the place before the competition and measure the water temperature, to optimize his racing strategy, or even withdraw from a potentially disastrous race if the temperature was too low. He retired from competitive swimming around 1970 and published a book titled Marathonzwemmen (Marathon Swimming)."

  "text" : "Hamish Moore is a Scottish musician and bagpipe maker. Among Moore's contributions to Scottish music are his development of a revived form of the bellows-blown Scottish smallpipes; his 1985 recording of the \"Lowland\" or smallpipes, Cauld Wind Pipes, was the first contemporary complete recording of this instrument. In the 1980s and 1990s, Moore was also instrumental in exploring the links between the Scottish diaspora music of Canada's Cape Breton Island, and earlier Scottish traditions. Moore taught at Cape Breton's Gaelic College of Celtic Arts and Crafts, and in 1996 returned to South Uist, Scotland, to form his Ceolas musical summer school, which included Cape Breton instructors and influences. Hamish is father of Fin Moore, also a Scottish smallpiper and border piper."

He received his dental degree from the Medical College of Virginia School of Dentistry in 1950. Aldridge practiced as a dentist in Greenville, North Carolina for 50 years. Aldridge served on the Greenville City Council for a number of terms, and was elected to the North Carolina House (Ninth District) in 1994, defeating Democratic incumbent Charles McLawhorn. He achieved notoriety in 1995 when he asserted that rape victims could not get pregnant. In the context of a debate regarding whether the state should stop funding abortions for poor women, he stated, \"The facts show that people who are raped, who are truly raped, the juices don't flow, the body functions don't work, and they don't get pregnant.\" He later stated that his comments were \"stupid.\" Aldridge's 1995 comments were revisited in August 2012, in light of controversy surrounding U.S. Senate Candidate Todd Akin's similar comments. He was re-elected to his seat in 1996. In 1998, Aldridge also received some press attention when, noting a report that non-white infant mortality rates were nearly twice as high as for white infants, commented that he doubted the report \"because it seems that most of the black people I know are bigger and tougher and stronger than whites.\" Aldridge said afterwards that his comments were intended to be complimentary, as \"Black men are generally bigger, strong, better athletes. I would suggest that you take a look at the professional baseball, basketball, and football teams.\" A black state legislator, Sen. Bill Martin, commented that he did not believe Aldridge's comments had \"malicious intent.\" Aldridge retired from office in 1998, after losing to Democratic candidate Marian N. McLawhorn in the 1998 election. He died at age 78 on February 2, 2002. Aldridge was also very active in community organizations, serving as president of the Pitt-Greenville Chamber of Commerce, Greenville Lion’s Club, Greenville Boy’s Club, and Greenville Little League. He also served as president of the ECU Alumni Association."

  "text" : "Henri Nouvel (1621 or 1624 in Pezenas, Herault (France) – between October 1701 and October 1702 at the St. Francis Xavier Mission near Baie des Puants) was a Jesuit priest who spent forty years as a missionary to Native American communities of New France. Nouvel was the first missionary on the north shore of the Saint Lawrence River; and he visited Saginaw 26 years before the French built a fort in Detroit (1701). Nouvel was already a priest when he entered the Jesuit order in August 1648, and performed religious functions in France until 1662. He sailed for New France in 1662 as a missionary, arriving in Quebec in August 1662. During his first year in North America, he devoted himself to learning Indian languages. At the end of 1663, he established his first mission in the Rimouski area. Between 1664 and 1669, he did missionary work in the Montagnais territory at Lake Manicouagan. In 1671, he was sent from to the Jesuit missions in the Great Lakes amongst the Odawa people. Nouvel made several trips to various Native American communities before being appointed superior of the Jesuit missions to the Ottowas in the region in 1672. He was \"superior of the Ottowa mission\", a position he would hold from 1672 to 1680 (with a two-year break in 1678-1679), and again from 1688 to 1695. In 1673, he informed Governor Louis de Buade de Frontenac about fur trading threats with the Indians. In 1674-75, he divided his time between Mission Sainte-Marie and St. Ignace Mission, but was stationed at St. Ignace in 1677 and 1678. He traveled between the Amikwa, Odawa, and Saginaw. He attended the burial of Father Jacques Marquette in 1677 at the St. Ignace Mission. Between 1688 and 1695, during his second term as superior of the Outaouais mission, Nouvel intervened in the conflict between the Jesuit missionaries and Antoine Laumet de La Mothe, sieur de Cadillac over raids on Native American warriors and trafficking of Eau de vie. During most of his last twenty years of ministry, he lived at the mission of St. Francis Xavier Mission near Green Bay, where he died between late 1701 and October 1702. Pointe-au-Père, Quebec (English: Father Point) is named after Henri Nouvel, who celebrated the first mass there in 1663."

A lack of church funds made his permanent employment there unlikely. However, he was appointed to the Lachute mission and was ordained there in 1862.

  "text" : "Hannu Koistinen (born 1966, Joensuu) is a Finnish kantele maker, founder and CEO of Koistinen Kantele. He is the son of the renowned kantele builder Otto Koistinen and the brother of Ritva Koistinen, a kantele artist and the founder of classical kantele education at Sibelius Academy. He started to work at his father’s workshop at the age of 7 and since 1989 he has been focusing on developing and modernising kanteles. In 1990-1993 Koistinen created the first modern 38-string concert kantele models. Based on Paul Salminen’s drawings from 1920s, the instruments however included many innovations such as new lever positions, fully open damper and new string measurements specially invented for the use in art music. The latter made it possible to produce wider dynamic range on the kantele than ever before. In 1993 two Koistinen’s instruments won a double-blind concert kantele test hold at musical instrument building school in Ikaalinen. This achievement made a start for his professional career as a kantele builder as well as helped create a strong brand vision for new kantele models. Since then Koistinen concert kanteles gained a respected position within kantele circles.The first 39-string kantele which was built in 1995 is still used at Sibelius Academy. In 1999 Koistinen designed and built the first solid body electric kantele. A 39-string instrument supplied with 2 microphone systems, contact and magnetic, has opened an entirely new perspective of the kantele. The problem of audibility was now solved and the instrument could be incorporated in a band. Koistinen Electric 1 was featured in Finnish Design Yearbook 2006 along with the products by Marimekko and Iittala. In 2012 Koistinen Kantele was awarded with Rantasalmi Prize, a Finnish award in the area of wooden products. The award was given because of the remarkable improvement of the quality, sound and design of Finnish kantele and raise of the Finnish national instrument as a modern and high quality instrument of our time. Among the kantele artists who have played Koistinen’s instruments are Timo Väänänen, Ritva Koistinen, Eva Alkula, Eija Kankaanranta, Senni Eskelinen, Olga Shishkina and others."

In the 1820s he became involved in several major schemes in the town and neighbouring Hove, encompassing gardens, conservatories and similar. His grandiose Anthaeum project, an elaborate indoor botanical garden topped by \"the largest dome in the world\", ended in disaster when the structure spectacularly collapsed just before its official opening."

  "text" : "Henry Nock (1741–1804) was a British inventor and engineer of the Napoleonic period, best known as a gunsmith. Nock produced many innovative weapons including the screwless lock and the seven-barrelled volley gun, although he did not invent the latter despite it commonly being known as the Nock gun. He was a major supplier to the military during the Napoleonic wars. His high quality duelling pistols and double-barrelled shotguns were much sought after and it is largely through Nock that the latter became the weapon of choice for hunters. As well as supplying the military and civilian markets, Nock made expensive pieces for the aristocracy and royalty and was an appointed gunmaker to the king. Nock's business eventually became Wilkinson Sword, a company which today makes razor blades and other shaving equipment, and, until very recently, made ceremonial officer's swords for the British Army."

  "text" : "Henry Charles Richards (10 April 1851 – 1 June 1905) was a British barrister and Conservative Party politician. The son of Frederick Richards, JP, of Ore and St Leonards-on-Sea, Sussex.   He was educated at the City of London School and the Proprietary School, Gravesend. He entered employment as a clerk for the firm of Munt Brown and Co., hat and bonnet makers, in the City of London.  After fifteen years he was awarded the Bacon Scholarship to study law at Gray's Inn in 1879. He was called to the bar in 1881.  He worked as counsel for the Postmaster-General and for the London County Council.  In 1898 he \"took silk\" to become a Queen's Counsel.  From 1882 to 1885 he was one the City's representatives on the London School Board. He was elected a bencher of Gray's Inn and was treasurer in the year before his death. Active in Conservative politics, he unsuccessfully attempted to win a seat for the party at Northampton in 1885, 1886, 1892.  At the 1895 general election he contested the London constituency of Finsbury East. He won the seat, defeating the sitting Liberal member of parliament, James Rowlands. He was seen as representing his largely working class constituents effectively, and was re-elected in 1900 with an increased majority. Richards was also a very active \"high church\" member of the Church of England. He was appointed chairman of the City Branch of the Church Defence Institution in 1877 and three years later formed the City Church and Churchyard Preservation Society. He inherited his father's home \"Caerhages\", West Hill, St Leonards-on-Sea. In 1901 he paid for the erection of a stone cross in Hastings to mark the coronation of King Edward VII and Queen Alexandra. Richards died in a London nursing home of heart disease in June 1905 aged 54."

He settled in Topeka in 1868 and may have been \"the only regular subscriber to the London Punch in Kansas.\" Worrall designed the landscaping of Washburn College; and the Kansas exhibits at the Philadelphia Centennial in 1876, and the World's Columbian Exposition in 1893. Some of his musical compositions were published by Oliver Ditson in Boston and J.L. Peters & Bros. in St. Louis. He died in Kansas in 1902."

Petty Officer Hugh Jones from Kalgoorlie, Western Australia, Able Seaman William James Hurren from Sydney, New South Wales, and Able Seaman Hugh Charles Sweeny from Dalby, Queensland were landed with a QF 3 pounder Hotchkiss saluting gun on an improvised mounting, a reinforced 44-gallon drum. By early the next morning they were in position, manning the gun and dressed in military uniform on the main British defence line at Tug Argan Gap, some 60 kilometres south of Berbera. The fighting continued during the next five days but when the British evacuated between 15–19 August, the three Australian sailors were reported missing believed killed in action 15 August 1940. Instead, they had been captured by the Italians, the first members of an Australian unit taken prisoner of war (POW) during World War II. The three POWs from HMAS Hobart were recovered from Adi Ugri in Eritrea on 29 April 1941 after Italian East Africa fell to the British."

Hieronim Malecki was the son of Jan Malecki (sometimes referred to as \"Jan Sandecki\" or \"Jan Sandecki-Malecki\"), who was a printer of Polish language Lutheran religious literature in Królewiec (Königsberg, now Kaliningrad) in Ducal Prussia, then a fief of Kingdom of Poland. Hieronim studied in Kraków at the Jagiellonian University and then at the University of Königsberg. He worked as a teacher at a Polish school in Ełk and as a translator for the starosta of Ełk. In 1563 he was hired as the resident translator of Polish in the printing house of Hans Daubmann in Królewiec. Malecki's translations include Martin Luther's \"House Postil\" (Postylla domowa, to yest: Kazania na Ewangelie niedzielne y przednieysze święta, 1574, Królewiec), as well as Luther's Small Catechism (Catechismus maly: dla pospolitych plebanow y kaźnodzieiow, 1615, Królewiec) He also published works by his father, Jan, including Libellus de sacrificiis et idolatria Borussorum, Livonum... (\"Treatise on the sacrifices and idolatry in Prussia and Livonia\", 1563, Królewiec), originally a letter to the rector of University of Königsberg, Georg Sabinus, which Hieronim also published in a German-language version. In his translations into Polish, Hieronim, following his father, relied heavily on Czech, and even argued that Czech and Polish were a single language. This practice had origins in an argument between Hieronim's father and another Polish translator in Królewiec, Jan Seklucjan."

  "text" : "Harry Ernest Rauch (November 9, 1925 – June 18, 1979) was an American mathematician, who worked on complex analysis and differential geometry. He was born in Trenton, New Jersey, and died in White Plains, New York. Rauch earned his PhD in 1948 from Princeton University under Salomon Bochner with thesis Generalizations of Some Classic Theorems to the Case of Functions of Several Variables. From 1949 to 1951 he was a visiting member of the Institute for Advanced Study. He was in the 1960s a professor at Yeshiva University and from the mid-1970s a professor at the City University of New York. His research was on differential geometry (especially geodesics on n-dimensional manifolds), Riemann surfaces, and theta functions. In the early 1950s Rauch made fundamental progress on the quarter-pinched sphere conjecture in differential geometry. In the case of positive sectional curvature and simply connected differential manifolds, Rauch proved that, under the condition that the sectional curvature K does not deviate too much from K = 1, the manifold must be homeomorphic to the sphere (i.e. the case where there is constant sectional curvature K = 1). Rauch's result created a new paradigm in differential geometry, that of a \"pinching theorem;\" in Rauch's case, the assumption was that the curvaturewas pinched between 0.76 and 1. This was latter relaxed to pinching between 0.55 and 1 by Wilhelm Klingenberg, and finally replaced with the sharp result of pinching between 0.25 and 1by Marcel Berger and Klingenberg in the early 1960s. This optimal result is known as the sphere theorem for Riemannian manifolds. The Rauch comparison theorem is also named after Harry Rauch. He proved it in 1953."

  "text" : "Hunter Alan Scott (born June 9, 1985) is best known for the research he did on the sinking of the USS Indianapolis as a sixth-grade student, which led to a United States Congressional investigation and exoneration for her captain. Scott lived in Pensacola, Florida. At twelve years old, he created a National History Day project on the sinking of the USS Indianapolis. Scott became interested in the subject after seeing it discussed in the film Jaws. Scott interviewed nearly 150 survivors of the Indianapolis sinking and reviewed 800 documents. The young man concluded that the ship's Captain Charles Butler McVay III, who had been blamed for the tragedy, was innocent. Scott appeared before the US Congress with survivors of the USS Indianapolis to argue that McVay should be exonerated. In his testimony, Scott said: \"This is Captain McVay's dog tag from when he was a cadet at the Naval Academy. As you can see, it has his thumbprint on the back. I carry this as a reminder of my mission in the memory of a man who ended his own life in 1968. I carry this dog tag to remind me that only in the United States can one person make a difference no matter what the age. I carry this dog tag to remind me of the privilege and responsibility that I have to carry forward the torch of honor passed to me by the men of the USS Indianapolis.\" The testimony of Scott and the Indianapolis Survivors Organization resulted in passage of a Congressional resolution, signed by President Bill Clinton in October 2000, exonerating McVay. Scott's efforts received national media attention. Florida governor Jeb Bush declared August 24, 2001 \"Hunter Scott Day.\" Scott was featured in George Magazine as \"one of the most intriguing political figures\" of the year. In 2004, Scott spoke at events surrounding the dedication of the National World War II Memorial in Washington, D.C.. He studied economics and physics at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill on a Naval ROTC scholarship, and graduated in May 2007. As of 2012, Lieutenant Hunter Scott, USN, was a Naval Aviator and MH-60R Seahawk pilot based at NAS North Island in San Diego, California. Scott's story and that of the Indianapolis were told in Left for Dead: A Young Man's Search for Justice for the USS Indianapolis by Pete Nelson. Scott supplied the preface to Nelson book."

  "text" : "Harmon Jones (June 3, 1911 – July 10, 1972) was a Canadian-born film editor and director who worked for many years at the 20th Century-Fox studio in Southern California. He is credited as the editor for about 20 feature films through 1950. In the middle of his career, he became a film and television director. Between 1951 and 1969, he directed about fifteen feature films as well as dozens of episodes of popular television series of the 1950s and 1960s. There is apparently no published account of the beginnings of Jones' career; at the time, it was common for editors at the major film studios to work as uncredited assistant editors for several years prior to an initial assignment as an editor. Between 1944 and 1951 Jones is credited as the editor for more than 20 feature films; Hal Erickson has called him \"one of the leading lights of the 20th Century Fox film-editing department\". John Gallagher noted that \"studio chief Darryl F. Zanuck was himself a brilliant editor and maintained the best editorial department in Hollywood.\" Jones' credits include four of the earlier films directed by Elia Kazan, including Gentleman's Agreement (1947). Jones last credit as an editor is for Stella (1950). He then became a director for 20th Century Fox. As Erickson described it, \"Jones graduated to the director's chair with the Monty Woolley vehicle As Young as You Feel (1951), which featured up-and-coming Marilyn Monroe. His first directorial projects showed promise, especially his brace of baseball pictures — Pride of St. Louis (1952) and The Kid from Left Field (1953). Soon, however, Jones was churning out routine westerns and so-so costume flicks.\" Some recent critics do not agree; thus Toby Roan has written, \"Harmon Jones didn’t direct many features before heading to TV. His five Westerns — The Silver Whip (1953), City of Bad Men, A Day of Fury (1956), Canyon River (1956) and Bullwhip (1958) — are perfect examples of what a medium-budget studio Western could be. A Day Of Fury is a fantastic film, one of the best Westerns to come out of Universal in the 50s — and that’s saying something. If Jones had made more Westerns, I’m sure we’d be grouping him with directors like George Sherman, Gordon Douglas and Phil Karlson.\" Jones apparently left 20th Century Fox in 1954; his 1955 film Target Zero was produced by Warner Bros., and Day of Fury (1956) by Universal Studios. In 1957 Jones began directing episodes of several popular television series such as Perry Mason, Rawhide and Death Valley Days. Jones' last credits are from 1969, for several episodes of television series. Jones' editing of Gentleman's Agreement (1947) was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Film Editing. Jones was the father of Robert C. Jones, and the grandfather of Leslie Jones, both of whom are film editors who have also been nominated for Academy Awards. The editor for Jones' last feature film, Don't Worry, We'll Think of a Title (1966), was his son Robert C. Jones."

  "text" : "Honoo Hamaguchi (浜口 炎 Hamaguchi Honō) (born in December 1971) is a Japanese basketball coach. He originates from Oshima Island. As of 2011 Hamaguchi had been a part of the Japanese basketball league longer than most of the other coaches of Japanese basketball teams had been a part. Ed Odeven of The Japan Times said that Hamaguchi works for success but does not seek attention despite being in a social media era. For six seasons of the existence of the Sendai 89ers, Hamaguchi served as the coach. He began as the coach of the Sendai 89ers after the team entered the bj-league in 2005. In 2011 Hamaguchi's coaching of the Sendai 89ers ended after the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami occurred. He is now the coach of the Kyoto Hannaryz. Ed Odeven said that Hamaguchi has \"quirks\" and sometimes an \"overbearing coaching style.\" In regards to Marcus Cousin playing for the Kyoto team, in 2012 a former Hannaryz player asked \"He should obviously dominate, but it is all about how his personality will deal with Honoo. Will Honoo let him be himself, or will Honoo try to control every little detail?\""

The site published in 16 languages and protests were listed for over one hundred countries. As editor in chief and administrator of Wikileaks Central she used the media attention on Wikileaks in 2010 to 2012 to shine light on human rights and transparency issues and support revolutions around the world. \"As Georgie she has been writing about the revolution since before the beginning, starting with A Stateless War in September 2010.\" She wrote the first article referencing what became the US Occupy movement on the day it started, March 10, 2011, and covered many other day of rages within hours of their beginnings. A Canadian activist, she created Take the Square Canada and worked with activists around the world to \"encourage and facilitate connection and communication for the revolution\". Some of those groups were the South Korean Hope Riders, the North African Day of Rages, the Chinese Jasmine Revolution, the Spanish Indignados/Take the Square movement and the US Occupy movement. She began writing A Proposal for Governance in November 2011 and was invited to the Berlin Biennale from April - June 2012 to work with other hackers on creation of the Global Square.

  "text" : "Hirsch Schwartzberg (Schwarcberg, Schwarzberg) (October 28, 1907, in Vilna —October 17, 1987 in Ashdod) was a Jewish leader of Holocaust survivors (Yiddish: בפרייטה יידין אויף ברלין‎) under the American occupation of Berlin. He was president of the Central Committee of Jewish Displaced Persons in Berlin. He controlled activities of two adjoining displaced-person camps in Berlin, in Düppel and Mariendorf. As a witness remembers, in the years of his leadership there was no riots or violence in the camps. All of Schwartzberg's Family were killed in the WWII German genocide of European Jews, except himself, and his wife and son. They together survived the Vilna Ghetto. A couple weeks before its final liquidation, in September 1943, they escaped it's liquidation, together with a few hundred other Jews from the Ghetto, by gaining a work-permit for working in Karl Plagge's hastily expanded HKP 562 forced labor camp on Subačiaus Street in Vilnius. Albeit the survival rate was higher than in the liquidated Vilna ghetto, Plagge and some of his more benevolent officers could not avert the outcome, and most of the Jewish workers of the HKP were latter also Liquidated mainly by Ukrainian and Estonian SS in July 1944 before the Russians occupied Vilna/Vilnius. Schwartzberg, with wife and son, survived this liquidation by switching to new hiding places during the night, as their previous ones got discovered and those caught then killed. Most of these hiding places were makeshift and often overfilled, which increased their likelihood of discovery. For the Schwartzbergs and other surviving Jews the subsequent Soviet occupation was a liberation. But Vilnius/Vilna - before the German invasion - was a predominately Polish and Jewish city - after the genocide in Lithuania, the Vilna Jewish society and community to which Schwartzberg previously belonged did not exist anymore. Thus after the Schwartzbergs recuperated, and as the Red Army proceeded west-ward towards Berlin, Schwartzberg and his family also left Vilnius and moved west. To the city of Szczecin in Poland, and then three weeks after the German capitulation, to Berlin. An additional important calculation in Schwartzberg's decision to leave Vilna, his hometown, was also to avoid the forced migration east of many people in Lithuania by the Soviets, including surviving Jews. For a related reason, he lied about his place of birth, as being Lodz, Poland, on arriving into East Berlin. The Soviets had the policy then of repatriating people from the Baltics, often also shipping them further east. For this reason he took the additional precaution of misinforming the Soviets about his place of birth and that of his wife and child. In February 1949 Schwartzberg, and his wife and son, immigrated to the United States."

  "text" : "Harry Stockman, also known as \"Harmless\" (born c. 1961) is a Northern Irish loyalist and a senior member of the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF) paramilitary organisation. He serves as the commander of the UVF 1st Battalion Shankill Road and is allegedly the second-in-command on the UVF Brigade Staff. His uncle was Robert \"Basher\" Bates, a member of the notorious Shankill Butchers gang. At a news conference in June 2009, Stockman read out a decommissioning statement issued by the UVF and Red Hand Commando (RHC) leadership in which it claimed the organisations had put all of their weapons out of use. Stockman survived a murder attempt in April 2011 when he was stabbed repeatedly outside a crowded supermarket by another UVF man as a revenge attack stemming from an internal dispute."

  "text" : "Henri Joutel (c. 1643 - 1725), a French explorer and soldier, is known for his eyewitness history of the last North American expedition of René Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle. Joutel was born in Rouen. After serving as a soldier, he joined La Salle's expedition and became the commander of La Salle's southern colony and base of operations in the New World at Fort Saint Louis (Texas). After the loss of the colony's ships, a mutiny, and La Salle's murder by others, in 1687-88, Joutel led members of the expedition back to France, going north, over land and river, by way of the Illinois Country to New France in what became Canada. Joutel's journal provides some of the earliest written information on the interior, natural history, and ethnography of central North America. After Joutel returned to France, he became a guard at the city gates of Rouen. He was unpersuaded by the Minister of Marine, Louis de Ponchartrain, to return to America but lent his journal. The journal returned to the Gulf Coast in the Iberville expedition that finally established a lasting French presence near the mouth of the Mississippi River in 1699."

He named this X element because its strange behaviour made him unsure whether it was genuinely a chromosome. It later became X chromosome after it was established that it was indeed a chromosome."

However, it is often considered that she became the ruler of Dahomey upon the sudden death of King Akaba because his oldest son, Agbo Sassa, was not yet of age. The duration and extent of this rule is not generally agreed upon. She supported Agbo Sassa in a succession struggle between him and Agaja in 1718. Agaja became King of Dahomey and, because of her support for his opponent, her legacy was largely erased from official history."

  "text" : "Hamdi Ulukaya (born October 26, 1972) is a Kurdish businessman living in the United States. Ulukaya is the owner, founder, Chairman, and CEO of Chobani, the #1 selling strained yogurt brand in the United States. On April 26, 2016, Ulukaya announced to his employees that he would be giving them 10% of the shares in Chobani. Originating from a dairy-farming family in a small village in Turkey, Ulukaya came to the U.S. in 1994 to study English and took a few business courses as well. He started a modest feta-cheese factory in 2002 on the advice of his father. His real success came from taking a major risk: Ulukaya purchased a large, defunct yogurt factory in upstate New York in 2005. With no prior experience in the yogurt business, he created a yogurt empire, Chobani, which was valued at over $1 billion in annual sales in less than five years after launch, becoming the leading yogurt brand in the U.S. by 2011. The popularity of his Greek-style yogurt also sparked the rise in Greek yogurt's market share in the U.S. from less than 1% in 2007 to more than 50% in 2013. Ernst & Young named Ulukaya the World Entrepreneur of the Year in 2013. The success of his yogurt empire made Ulukaya a billionaire, and according to Forbes, his net worth as of 2016 is $1.92 billion."

  "text" : "Edouard Henri Mercier (1816 – 1886) was the French ambassador to the United States from July 1860 through December 1863 during the American Civil War (1861–1865). He is most noted for playing a key diplomatic role in the Trent Affair. Mercier was born in Baltimore, the son of a French diplomat stationed in America. During the Civil War, he was generally thought of as leaning pro-South, visiting Richmond in 1862, and proposing a common market between the southern states and France. However, after the Emancipation Proclamation and subsequent change in favor towards the Federals among the French and British public, he brought an offer from Napoleon III to mediate an end the war in 1863. This was angrily rejected by Secretary of State William H. Seward. Seeing little headway being made he asked to be reassigned to Spanish relations in 1863. A full biography of Mercier was written by Daniel B. Carroll in 1971 titled Henri Mercier and the American Civil War."

He was the first Dane who made a transatlantic flight, which made him famous in Denmark. Holger Hoiriis gave up his work in agriculture and went to the U.S. in 1924, at the age of 23. He took flying lessons on Long Island, then bought a plane. It didn't take long before he earned money by performing various acrobatic tricks or barnstorming. It gave him the nickname, hold your horses Hoiriis. People could also get a trip in his plane for a fee. A trip cost $1.50 and after some time, he owned several planes. Some years later he worked as a flight instructor at the Air Services of Bellanca Airfield and by Bellanca Company as a test pilot. He was one of the pioneer pilots of All American Aviation mail pickup service, and in 1939 he demonstrated the world's first night pickup service at Bellanca Airfield. With the approach of World War II, Hoiriis became the first wing commander of the Delaware Wing Civil Air Patrol, whose core mission, was to patrol the east coast of the United States, trying to find German submarines. He did that very effectively and was the first to introduce defined search patterns, so that all of the Delaware coast was patrolled. This led to the ironic nickname willy nilly.. Holger Hoiriis married Miss Boynton, they had 3 daughters together. He died in 1942 of complications from typhoid."

  "text" : "Herbert Sidney Percy (1863-1932) was a member of the Williams family of painters who painted mainly portraits, but also produced some fine landscapes of the English countryside. Percy was the youngest son of the popular Victorian landscape painter Sidney Richard Percy and Emily Fairlam, his father being a member of the Williams family of painters. He married Maud Thompson, who was the sister of the well-known Shakespearean actress Constance Crawley. His sister Amy Dora Percy became a novelist under the pen name of Mrs. Fred Reynolds. Percy entered the Royal Academy of Art Schools in December 1881 at the age of 18, and spent two three-year terms there, earning two silver medals. Although he was a competent landscape artist, he considered himself primarily a portrait and miniature painter, as these brought in the large commissions, and his portraits hang in the homes of many prominent English families. He also painted some impressionist pieces, worked as a picture restorer, and prepared engravings, often from his own line drawings, for books and magazines. He was a close friend of the writer G.K. Chesterton, and some of Chesterton's books are illustrated with Percy's engravings. He exhibited one painting at the Royal Academy, and eight works with the Society of British Artists. He was also a frequent exhibitor with the Royal Society of Painters in Oil and Watercolours. His portrait of Captain James Wood hangs in the Royal Marines Museum in Portsmouth, Hampshire."

  "text" : "Herbert Lee Waters (1902–1997) was an American photographer and filmmaker. Waters was born in Caroleen, North Carolina. He worked as a studio photographer in Lexington, North Carolina. Waters also created over 252 short films that make up a series, Movies of Local People, depicting life in small towns in North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, and Virginia. Waters arranged screenings of the short films at local cinemas. They were usually played before the feature film of the screening. Waters made the films profitable for himself through admission prices and contributions from local businesses that wished to appear in the films. The films, produced between 1936 and 1942, provide insight into American life during the Great Depression. The subject matter of the films includes footage of school children, people at work, athletic events, scenes from city streets, and other everyday activities. Waters produced Movies of Local People on 16mm black and white reversal film. A collection of Waters' films is housed at the Rubenstein Rare Book & Manuscript Library at Duke University. A number of the films have been digitized and are available in Duke Digital Collections. In 2004, the Library of Congress selected Waters' film of Kannapolis, North Carolina for inclusion in the National Film Registry as representative of his work and genre."

  "text" : "Herbert Fingarette is an American philosopher and emeritus professor of philosophy at the University of California, Santa Barbara. He received his PhD at the University of California, Los Angeles under the direction of Donald Piatt. Fingarette's work deals with issues in philosophy of mind, psychology, ethics, law, and Chinese philosophy. In his 1969 monograph Self-Deception, Fingarette presents an account of the titular concept influenced by the work of Jean-Paul Sartre, Sören Kierkegaard and Sigmund Freud, as well as contemporary work in physiology and analytic philosophy. Fingarette argues that traditional accounts of self-deception fall invariably into paradox because these accounts see self-deception in terms of perception or knowledge. Such paradoxes may be resolved, Fingarette claims, by re-framing self-deception as a problem of volition and action. On these new terms, he defines self-deception as an agent's persistent refusal to \"spell out\" (explicitly acknowledge) and to avow some aspect of her engagement in the world. Fingarette's 1972 monograph Confucius: The Secular As Sacred was described in a peer-reviewed academic journal as \"one of the most significant philosophical books on the subject to be published in a long time.\". Fingarette has also influentially applied his work in moral psychology to pressing social and legal issues, particularly those surrounding addiction. In his 1988 book Heavy Drinking, Fingarette gainsays the disease theory of alcoholism popularized by groups such as Alcoholics Anonymous. Fingarette's arguments were famously employed by the U.S. Supreme Court in a 1988 decision to deny VA educational benefits to two alcoholic American veterans."

He was the father of Lenore Romney; the father-in-law of businessman and politician George W. Romney; and the maternal grandfather of businessman and politician Mitt Romney. English-born, Lafount moved to the United States as a teenager and grew up in Utah. He managed several local businesses and was active in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Appointed to the Federal Radio Commission by President Calvin Coolidge, he was in charge of the zone covering the Western United States. Lafount played an important part in developments and decisions regarding the regulation of the broadcasting industry in the U.S., favoring perspectives that saw radio broadcasting as a fundamentally commercial enterprise. He was also an early influence in making radio airtime available to political candidates and parties. Lafount later managed a number of well-known radio stations in the northeastern United States on behalf of Arde Bulova and served as president of the National Independent Broadcasters. A licensing issue regarding a station Lafount co-owned resulted in a protracted regulatory and legal matter that was finally decided in the U.S. Supreme Court."

Hoosier Cardinal Corp. was argued in front of the United States Supreme Court in 1966. His victory for Hoosier Cardinal Corp. set a precedent for the application of statutes of limitations in labor relations cases and laid the foundation for his career. The importance of Dees' case is underscored by the vast number of references to its holding. This case has been cited in over 1,000 federal court and administrative agency opinions. In fact, every federal circuit court of appeal in the U.S. and countless state courts and administrative agencies have cited Dees' case. The case has been cited over 20 times by the U.S. Supreme Court alone. This case continues to have an undeniable impact in both U.S. academia and the courtroom: it has been discussed in over 100 law review journals, as recently as 2012, as well as several hundred briefs and motions filed throughout U.S. courts."

Jamieson states that \"cyberformance can be located as a distinct form within the subsets of networked performance and digital performance, and within the overall form of theatre, as it is a live performance form with an audience that is complicit in the completion of the work in real time.\" Cyberformances are \"live theatrical performances in which remote participants are able to work together in real time through the medium of the internet.\" In her Master Thesis, Jamieson states that \"cyberformance, like all forms of theatre and artistic expression, offers a means to approach and respond to the changing world we exist in.\" In 2008 Helen Varley Jamieson completed her MA (research) degree in Cyberformance from Queensland University of Technology entitled \"Adventures in Cyberformance: experiments at the interface of theatre and the internet.\""

Netzbandt completed high school in 1912 and shortly after, on 1 April 1912, joined the Imperial German Navy. After the one-month basic training at the Naval Academy Mürwik, he was transferred for sea training on the heavy cruiser SMS Victoria Louise. He spent WWI mostly on torpedo boats. His most important engagement was the Battle of Jutland (31 May to 1 June 1916) as officer commanding vessel G103. He was involved in various other actions during the war: in October 1914 he was engaged in action against British submarines and on 17 August 1915 was involved in an action at Dogger Bank. By October 1917, he was in the Baltic Sea, still on G103, where he participated in the German Army's occupation of the Baltic Islands. After the war and his involvement in the Freikorps Loewenfeld, he was appointed in the summer of 1920 as Oberleutnant zur see in the new German Navy. From 1 April until 5 October 1922, he headed a company in the Coastal Defense Department III. Subsequently he was commander (Kapitänleutnant from 1 May 1923) of torpedo boat T149 until 15 September 1924. Two years as an instructor at the Naval Artillery School in Kiel followed. On 27 March 1929 he was appointed as I. artillery officer on the light cruiser Berlin. From 28 March 1929 to 27 September 1932, he was Admiralstabsoffizier (Staff Officer) in command of the Baltic Sea naval station. Netzbandt was appointed Lieutenant Commander on 1 February 1931. After his Baltic Sea posting, he spent a year as I. Artillery Officer aboard the pre-dreadnought battleship Hessem followed by two years as staff officer in the fleet command, where he spent a year in the HR Department of the Navy's high command. Appointed Fregattenkapitän (Frigate Captain) on 1 April 1936 Netzbandt subsequently remained with the Navy’s high command and was head of the department of general and student affairs until 25 November 1939. Promoted to Kapitän zur See from 1 October 1937 he was in command of the fleet flagship, the battleship Gneisenau, from 26 November 1939 to 1 August 1940. Subsequently, he was appointed chief of staff in the fleet command and was killed on 27 May 1941, aboard the new battleship Bismarck alongside Fleet Admiral Günther Lütjens and other staff officers. On 30 April 1942, nearly a year after his death, the Commander-in-Chief of the Navy awarded him the German Cross in Gold to supplement the Iron Crosses (First and Second Classes) that he had won on 23 February 1940 and 14 April 1940 respectively."

  "text" : "General Hugh Boscawen, 2nd Viscount Falmouth (20 March 1707 – 4 February 1782), styled The Honourable Hugh Boscawen between 1720 and 1734, was a British soldier and politician. Boscawen was the eldest son of Hugh Boscawen, 1st Viscount Falmouth, by Charlotte Godfrey, daughter of Colonel Charles Godfrey, Master of Jewel Office, by Arabella Churchill, daughter of Sir Winston Churchill and sister of the Duke of Marlborough. Admiral Edward Boscawen was his younger brother. He was returned to Parliament for Truro in 1727, a seat he held until 1734, when he succeeded his father in the viscountcy. In 1747 he was appointed Captain of the Yeomen of the Guard, a post he held until his death 35 years later. He was sworn of the Privy Council in 1756. He also served in the British Army. He became a lieutenant-general in 1759 and a full general in 1772. From 1761 to 1782 he was Vice-Admiral of Cornwall. Lord Falmouth married Hannah Catherine Maria Smith, daughter of Thomas Smith, of Worplesdon, Surrey, and widow of Richard Russel, in 1736. There were no children from the marriage. Falmouth died in February 1782, aged 74, and was succeeded in the title by his nephew, George. He had no children in his marriage, but a family of three outside it: Hugh, Jane and Florentius (male) - apparently born in the 1750s. Lord Falmouth, was, it is understood, to have been very proud of his children and a wise, generous and devoted father. Only Hugh appears in the Boscawen tree, but he appears as the second son of his Uncle John. Hugh did reach the rank and position of Knight Marshall and had four children. \"EXTRACT: Will of Hugh Boscawen, 2nd viscount Falmouth Dated 27 July 1778 “Whereas I have adopted Hugh Boscawen Esq. some time since (?clerke) of the (?Guard) of His Majesty’s Guard of Yeoman of the Guard and now (?Member) of Parliament for the Borough of St. Mawes in the County of Cornwall and given him a qualification to sit in Parliament and his brother Florentius Boscawen now a Lieutenant in his Majesty’s Third Regiment of Foot Guards and their sister Jane Boscawen late a Parlour Boarder at Blacklands School of Chelsea afterwards living with Lady Leith and now with Mrs. Hawksworth of Bromley Kent as my sons and daughter and given and directed them to take and use my name and Arms (the Arms of Boscawen) without any alteration or addition I also give my said adopted sons and daughter the said Hugh Jane and Florentius thirty thousand pounds stirling that is to say ten thousand pounds each to my said son Hugh Boscawen and daughter Jane ………..” [he then goes on to make special arrangements for payments to Florentius until he reaches the age of 21]. At different places in the Will later, he asks his wife, his trustees and his friends to ‘countenance’ his children."

  "text" : "Hanna Albertina Rydh (12 February 1891 – 29 June 1964) was a Swedish archaeologist and politician for the Liberal People's Party. She was a Member of Parliament from 1943 to 1944 and the 3rd President of the International Alliance of Women from 1946 to 1952. Hanna Rydh was born in Stockholm to director Johan Albert Rydh and Matilda Josefina Westlund. She was married to fellow archaeologist Bror Schnittger in 1919, and, after his death, to Mortimer Munck af Rosenschöld, the Governor of Jämtland County, in 1929. Rydh was a pupil at the Wallinska skolan in Stockholm and proceeded studying archaeology at university. She graduated in literature history, archaeology and art history in 1915. Between 1916 and 1930, she made archaeological excavations on Adelsö, and between 1917 and 1921, in Gästrikland. In 1922, she became the first woman to be granted the scholarship of The international federation of university women. When asked if she should be given the scholarship, as she had just became a mother, she famously replied: \"my son's birth makes no difference\", which was given attention worldwide. She was attaché temporaire at the Musée des Antiquités Nationales in S:t Germain-en-Laye in 1924-1925. Aside from her work as an archaeologist, she was engaged as a social reformer. Her first assignment was as a member of the central comity of the Sveriges studerande ungdoms helnykterhetsförbund or SSUH (The Swedish Student's Temperance Association) in 1909-1914. About the time of her graduation, marriage and beginning of her professional life in 1919, women in Sweden had only recently achieved equal rights with men, which had been the goal of the women's movement since its start fifty years before, and the new focus of the Swedish women's movement was to use these rights, defy traditional gender prejudices, and proof those who doubted women could handle their new role in society wrong. Hanna Rydh provided an example and role model of the \"new woman\" who could use her rights as a professional public person and still be a married woman with a family, which she demonstrated particularly during the tenure of her second spouse as governor in 1931-1938, when she performed all the social representational duties of a governor's wife of the time while in parallel being an internationally respected career professional. She was a member of the board of the Sveriges Husmodersföreningars riksförbund in 1936-1941, chairperson of Fredrika-Bremer-förbundet in 1937-1949, second vice chairperson of the Centrala Finlandshjälpen (Finland Relief Society) in 1940, vice president of the International Alliance of Women in 1939-1946, member of the commission of home- and family issues in 1941, the 3rd President of the International Alliance of Women from 1946 to 1952. She was given the Illis Quorum in 1936."

On 2 May 1649, he married Anna Elisabeth, a daughter of Count Henry Volrad of Stolberg-Ortenberg. They had two sons, Ernest and Louis Christian, and one daughter, Anna Eleonore, who married Emmanuel, Prince of Anhalt-Köthen in Ilsenburg on 23 March 1670.

  "text" : "Horace Rublee (1829–1896) was a Wisconsin journalist and newspaper editor, Republican party leader, and ambassador to Switzerland. Rublee was born August 19, 1829, son of Alvah and Martha (Kent) Rublee, in Berkshire, Vermont, a community situated tight against the Canada–US border. In 1839, his father moved to what was then the pioneer western town of Sheboygan, Wisconsin Territory, where he had an interest at a saw mill, and in June 1840 the rest of the family joined him, traveling via steamship to Milwaukee and by sloop from Milwaukee to Sheboygan. The Rublee family was among the earliest of young families from New York and New England who settled in Sheboygan County. This new community was intellectually vibrant. Influential were, for example, Horace Greeley and the New York Tribune, which was subscribed to by many in the area, and Combe on the Constitution of Man. There was a debating society well attended by these pioneers in nearby Sheboygan Falls, and among the philosophical trends was Fourierism. In 1843 a school opened, and Rublee was one of the first two students. The teacher frequented the debating societies in Sheboygan Falls, and \"he loaned me Scott's 'Lady of the Lake,' 'Nicholas Nickleby,' 'Oliver Twist' and several of Bulwer's novels, which helped to pass the school hours, and wonderfully shortened the long winter evenings.\" Rublee was academically stimulated, with many influences of high literature. He taught school briefly at age 17. Starting in 1849 he spent a year at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, then returned to Sheboygan County to teach for two more years. Rublee began his political and journalism career in 1852, when he moved back to Madison. He was legislative reporter for the Madison Argus and Democrat in 1852-53. In 1853 he started work at the Wisconsin State Journal, and in 1854 purchased a part interest in the paper. He was secretary of the state mass meeting held at Madison on July 13, 1854 which formed the state chapter of the Republican party. The party had been started in embryonic form in March in Ripon, but this mass meeting was the first serious establishment of the party as a lasting organized political force. He was Republican party chair 1859-1869, and in 1868 a delegate to the national Republican convention. From 1856-58 he was Wisconsin State Librarian. From 1857-1871 he was a Curator of State Historical Society of Wisconsin, serving with such notable nineteenth century Wisconsin figures as James Duane Doty, Cyrus Woodman and Lyman Draper. In 1869 Rublee was a candidate for the US Senate, although this was prior to the Seventeenth Amendment (the direct election of Senators), so while the candidacy and campaign were not a secret from the public, it was carried out almost entirely behind closed doors. The seat was won by Matthew H. Carpenter. Later that same year, Rublee was appointed Ambassador to Switzerland by President Ulysses S. Grant, serving until 1877. In consequence of this appointment, he sold his interest in the Wisconsin State Journal. When he returned to Wisconsin after his ambassadorship, he again assumed the chair position of the Republican party, serving from 1877-1879. In 1878 he settled the 'Greenback Party Controversy' which threatened to seriously divide the party. In 1879 he went east and served as editor of Boston Advertiser for one year. After he returned to Wisconsin, in 1881 he and associates purchased the Milwaukee Daily News and renamed it Republican and News. In 1882 he purchased the Milwaukee Sentinel and merged the Republican News into it. He remained the editor of Sentinel until his death in 1896. During his life in Milwaukee, he lived on fashionable Prospect Avenue, home of the cream of Milwaukee's social, political and business elite. He died October 19, 1896 in Milwaukee."

  "text" : "Hubert Benoit (1904–1992) was a 20th-century French psychotherapist whose work foreshadowed subsequent developments in integral psychology and integral spirituality. His special interest and contribution lay in developing a pioneering form of psychotherapy which integrated a psychoanalytic perspective with insights derived from Eastern spiritual disciplines, in particular from Ch'an and Zen Buddhism. He stressed the part played by the spiritual ignorance of Western culture in the emergence and persistence of much underlying distress. He used concepts derived from psychoanalysis to explain the defences against this fundamental unease, and emphasised the importance of an analytic, preparatory phase, while warning against what he regarded as the psychoanalytic overemphasis on specific causal precursors of symptomatology. He demonstrated parallels between aspects of Zen training and the experience of psychoanalysis. He constructed an account in contemporary psychological terms of the crucial Zen concept of satori and its emergence in the individual."

He was born Horace Walter Gilbert-Williams on 6 April 1855 in the Kensington district of London, being the only child of the well-known Victorian landscape painter Arthur Gilbert and Gilbert's second wife Sarah Ann Godfrey. He initially became a landscape painter, like his father, and his older step-sister Kate Gilbert, but ultimately he decided to pursue instead a career as a civil servant and university lecturer. Prior to this, he exhibited at the Royal Academy and at Suffolk Street. He painted mainly landscapes of the Thames River and of the low hills near his home in Surrey, with many of his paintings showing water and/or meadows in the foreground, fronting dense thickets of dark green trees, against a backdrop of cloudy skies. His use of dark greens contrast with the soft earth tones of stark mountain scapes that characterize much of the work of his father. He also painted several nice watercolors of his father's home at De Tillens in Limpsfield, Surrey. He retired to Lancashire, where he died in 1928 in the Prescot registration district."

  "text" : "Henhenet was an ancient Egyptian queen consort, a lower ranking wife of Pharaoh Mentuhotep II of the 11th dynasty. Her tomb (DBXI.11) and small decorated chapel were found in her husband's Deir el-Bahari temple complex, behind the main building, along with the tombs of five other ladies, Ashayet, Kawit, Kemsit, Sadeh and Mayet. Most of them were priestesses of Hathor, so it is possible that they were buried there as part of the goddess's cult, but it is also possible that they were the daughters of nobles the king wanted to keep an eye upon. Unlike the sarcophagi of the other queens, hers was not decorated, only a single line of inscription runs on both sides. Her mummy shows that she died in childbirth. Her mummy is now in the Egyptian Museum in Cairo, her sarcophagus is in New York. Her titles were: King's Beloved Wife (ḥmt-nỉswt mrỉỉ.t=f ), King's Ornament (ẖkr.t-nỉswt), King's Sole Ornament (ẖkr.t-nỉswt wˁtỉ.t), Priestess of Hathor (ḥm.t-nṯr ḥwt-ḥrw)."

  "text" : "Henry of Latvia (Latin: Henricus de Lettis, German: Heinrich von Lettland, Latvian: Latviešu Indriķis, Estonian: Läti Henrik; before 1188, Magdeburg, Landgraviate of Thuringia – after 1259 in Papendorf, Livonia (currently Rubene, Kocēni parish, Kocēni Municipality, Latvia)), also known in the English speaking world as Henry of Livonia, was a priest, missionary and historian. He wrote the Livonian Chronicle of Henry which describes the evangelization of the regions which are now part of Estonia and Latvia during the Northern Crusades. The chronicles say that Henry was a Catholic priest who witnessed most of events described. Henry is thought to have been born between 1180 and 1188. Henry was probably German, bearing a German forename and consistently referring to Germans as \"we\", but it is also possible that he came from Livonia. He had a thoroughly German and Catholic education and as a youth was attached to the household of the Prince-Bishop Albert of Buxhoeveden, was ordained a priest in 1208, founded a parish and lived out his life in peace. Henry's Chronicles are written from a clerical point of view, that the history of the Church was the essential history of Livonia. The Chronicles may have originated as a report to the papal legate, William of Modena, to whom he was assigned as interpreter 1225 through 1227. The legate, one of the papacy's most able diplomats, was in Livonia to mediate an internal church dispute between the Livonian Brothers of the Sword, and the territorial claims of the Catholic bishops of Livonia."
